[0:00] here tonight by the grace of
[0:02] God. I want to thank Malai. You know,
[0:04] Malachi moved the organ and piano Sunday
[0:08] just to try to help out Lydia a little
[0:09] bit. You know, she was born and with
[0:11] that sensitivity in her ears and
[0:13] everything probably because of the
[0:14] vaccines we gave her. You know, we
[0:16] didn't know
[0:18] better. So, we're just going to try
[0:20] that, see how that works, and hope
[0:21] that'll be a blessing. So, thank you,
[0:22] Malachi, for doing that. Thank you
[0:24] again, Haven, for putting up with me.
[0:26] And Quesa Malachi
[0:35] 1 Corinthians 11:23. This is part
[0:39] 16. Slowly making our way through here
[0:42] by the grace of the
[0:48] Lord. We'll just read uh verse
[0:52] 23. It should sound very familiar after
[0:54] all the years of taking uh communion. We
[0:57] just took it uh on April 6, Brother
[0:58] Ram's birthday. So, very uh familiar
[1:01] scripture
[1:02] here. But wasn't it nice to see last
[1:04] week, wasn't it nice to see how Paul had
[1:06] to deal with this and balance it out?
[1:07] And we'll see it even again here
[1:08] tonight. He talks about how many were
[1:10] getting drunk at the Lord's table. And
[1:11] he said there in verse 22 that it was
[1:13] such a shame for these people how they
[1:15] were treating the Lord's supper. They
[1:17] thought they could drink of the devil's
[1:19] cup and the Lord's cup. But may it good
[1:21] be a good reminder to us only to drink
[1:23] of the Lord's cup. Praise God. Good to
[1:26] see brother Mercy and Patrick and Claude
[1:28] tonight. God bless you, brothers. How
[1:30] was the weekend? Was a good weekend of
[1:31] uh service there by God's grace. Okay.
[1:34] Praise God. We appreciate that. Safe
[1:36] travel. Yes. Thank you, sir. God bless
[1:38] you. Hallelujah. Let's read verse 23 if
[1:41] we can. One, two, three. For I have
[1:44] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:48] delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus
[1:51] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:53] took bread. We'll stop right there. May
[1:55] God add his blessing to the reading of
[1:57] his word. You can be seated there by
[1:58] God's
[1:59] grace. I have some slides here so you
[2:02] whenever you're ready can pull that up
[2:03] there. Thank
[2:11] you. Okay. So, we read our text here and
[2:13] we're we're finishing up this sixth
[2:15] section here on the headship and the
[2:16] Lord's
[2:18] supper. And then next time, Lord
[2:21] willing, we'll get to the gifts of the
[2:22] Holy Spirit. revisit them uh by the
[2:24] grace of the Lord. Um as brother Chris
[2:26] and I were talking a few weeks ago,
[2:27] everybody has a gift of the Holy Spirit.
[2:30] And uh the way to know is see what you
[2:32] can do. See which of those nine you can
[2:34] do when the spirit of God is on you. Um
[2:38] and then uh you know the more you invest
[2:40] in that, the more you pray in that, God
[2:42] will uh bless you of course and bless
[2:45] those gifts by the grace of God. But
[2:47] there's also that idea where uh the Holy
[2:49] Ghost might anoint you for one time to
[2:51] use on a certain gift and then you might
[2:54] not use that gift the rest of your life.
[2:56] There's also that idea too. There's a
[2:58] truth to that. And you can see it kind
[3:00] of in the scripture. You know, even that
[3:02] little child, that little boy, he gives
[3:04] Jesus, you know, his uh his his
[3:05] breakfast, right? And uh probably never
[3:08] happened the rest of his life, you know,
[3:10] but that one moment he was able to give
[3:12] of himself to the Lord Jesus. and and if
[3:14] we're willing to sacrifice the Lord
[3:16] Jesus, Jesus will multiply. Praise God.
[3:19] So, we can see it, you know, in
[3:20] different uh stories in the scriptures.
[3:22] So, we'll move on to that. And then, of
[3:23] course, the the main I think the main
[3:25] chapter of this whole book is charity
[3:27] because without charity doesn't profit
[3:29] us anything. No matter what we try to do
[3:30] for God, right? No matter how many
[3:32] testimonies we have of miracles, no
[3:34] matter how much we know about the Bible,
[3:36] all the mysteries, no matter how much we
[3:38] give money to the poor, none of it
[3:40] matters unless it's done with the love
[3:42] of Jesus Christ. Praise God. So, we want
[3:44] to just revisit that, of course, again
[3:46] here by the grace of God. So, we looked
[3:48] at verses 1-6 last Wednesday and and
[3:50] then we looked at verses
[3:52] 17 through 22. Uh, the disorders at the
[3:55] Lord's table were rebuked. So, tonight
[3:57] we're just going over this familiar
[3:59] text. So, I'll try to bring in some um
[4:01] additional thoughts here. By the grace
[4:03] of the Lord,
[4:05] um we stopped at verse 23. So, we'll
[4:06] pick up there. We read 23 tonight. And
[4:08] then verse 24, very familiar. And when
[4:10] he given thanks, he broke it and said,
[4:12] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[4:14] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[4:17] of me." Hallelujah. And uh I don't know
[4:21] if you remember, but the very last
[4:22] recording we have of brother Brandham
[4:24] was his thoughts on communion. It's not
[4:27] it's not even his sermon. Uh it's
[4:29] recorded from uh Arizona, Tucson,
[4:32] Arizona. It was recorded uh he was
[4:35] preaching right before communion was
[4:37] given but it was after brother Perry
[4:39] Green had preached the morning service.
[4:42] So the very last recording of our
[4:43] prophet. Isn't it wonderful? It's on
[4:45] communion. Hallelujah. And I'll say
[4:47] this. Remember the church age book. What
[4:48] does brother Ram say in the beginning?
[4:50] Uh I'm sorry. What does he say at the
[4:52] end? He says the one goal I have for my
[4:54] life is not to start a new movement or
[4:56] start a church. My one goal in life is
[4:59] to create a true relationship between
[5:01] God and man. And that's what I know this
[5:04] message has done. It has created a true
[5:07] relationship between myself and the Lord
[5:09] Jesus Christ. Amen. So I know brother's
[5:11] purpose was accomplished because now I
[5:13] know Jesus better than I ever have
[5:15] before. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[5:18] So the very last recording was about
[5:20] communion. But first, as I mentioned a
[5:22] few weeks ago, I want to read bring this
[5:23] to you again. Uh, I don't think I showed
[5:25] you the quotes, but brother Adam said,
[5:27] "Comunion does not pertain to
[5:29] salvation." Okay? So, whether you take
[5:32] communion or don't, that doesn't mean
[5:33] you're saved. Now, should you do it? Of
[5:36] course you should. But some people make
[5:38] it uh uh life and death, such as the
[5:41] Catholic Church. I'm sure you've heard
[5:42] of it. Catholic people, they really want
[5:45] to have their communion before they die.
[5:47] They call it the last rights. Some of
[5:49] them are so dogmatic on it, they've got
[5:51] to have it from the priest. If not, then
[5:53] they think they're going to get more
[5:54] time in purgatory or they be be lost.
[5:57] Like it is such an important thing for
[5:59] them. But we know that God doesn't save
[6:01] by our works. God saves by his works.
[6:04] Amen. God saves by grace.
[6:08] Hallelujah. But I just thought I'd bring
[6:09] this quote to you, you know, because I
[6:11] mentioned it. I'd like you to see it.
[6:13] Now, the communion is not air. It's not
[6:15] given for the purpose that many think it
[6:16] is. It's taught by certain denominations
[6:18] of the church that communion is called
[6:20] the last rights that it pertains to
[6:22] salvation. Communion does not pertain to
[6:25] salvation. Communion does not give you
[6:29] salvation whether you take it in your
[6:31] death or what it does not have nothing
[6:33] to do with your salvation. It's a
[6:36] commemoration or a remembrance as uh
[6:39] Paul says here. You do it to remember
[6:42] the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus said in the
[6:45] gospel, he said, "This do in remembrance
[6:46] of me." Not it leaning or pointing to
[6:50] salvation, but it's in commemoration of
[6:53] a finished work that's been done in you
[6:56] by the Holy Spirit. It's a
[6:59] commemoration. Praise God. So, we look
[7:01] back when we take communion, we look
[7:03] back and say, "Thank you, Lord. You were
[7:04] broken for me. Your blood was poured out
[7:06] upon me, and now I'm a finished
[7:09] product." Hallelujah. Amen. He's
[7:12] finished. He's taken away all my sin,
[7:14] right? He's washed. He paid for all my
[7:16] sin. I'm guaranteed to go to heaven
[7:18] because I have faith in Jesus Christ as
[7:20] a gift from Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[7:23] Not by works, not that I earned it, but
[7:27] that he was uh so gracious and kind
[7:29] enough to open my eyes to it that I
[7:31] could receive it. Praise God. And then
[7:33] he even had he even had to give me the
[7:35] gift of faith to be saved. Praise God.
[7:38] It wasn't what wasn't even just maybe
[7:40] because I wanted it. It was by
[7:41] predestination. Hallelujah. By the
[7:43] election of God. Hallelujah. And then
[7:45] that he the Bible said the goodness of
[7:47] God then he led me to repentance. Right.
[7:50] Hallelujah. I would not have wanted it
[7:52] unless he would uh moved on my heart to
[7:56] want it by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[7:58] Because it's all by his design. Right?
[8:00] The potter has power over the clay.
[8:02] Hallelujah. Making one to honor, one to
[8:04] dishonor. Praise God. Now he says, now
[8:06] there's many that take the communion is
[8:08] not saved. Now here's the other side of
[8:10] it, right?
[8:12] Many people take communion, they're not
[8:13] even saved. Just like brother said or
[8:16] just like the Bible says many ate the
[8:18] pascal lamb in the days of Moses and the
[8:21] Bible said many of them perish in the
[8:24] wilderness, right? Uh it was estimated,
[8:28] brother Chris, two million people came
[8:29] out of Egypt through Moses. It was
[8:31] estimated. But everyone that was not 20
[8:35] and under died. So, everybody 21 and
[8:37] over died except for uh Caleb and
[8:41] Joshua. Everybody died. Uh they died in
[8:45] the wilderness because they they had a
[8:47] fear that they couldn't take the
[8:48] promised land. And God punished them
[8:50] because they fear to take the promised
[8:52] land. So, out of those two million
[8:54] people, we don't even know how many
[8:56] actually made it in the promised land.
[8:58] God let the younger generation go in and
[9:00] then Caleb and Joshua because Caleb and
[9:02] Joshua had a different spirit that
[9:04] represents the Holy Spirit. Praise God.
[9:07] Hallelujah. But most of them died in the
[9:09] wilderness. Even though they saw the
[9:10] miracles, they saw the pillar of fire,
[9:12] they saw the water divide, the Red Sea.
[9:14] So, and even though they had communion,
[9:16] it didn't mean they were going to be
[9:18] saved. See, so it it goes to show uh and
[9:22] brother Bam says it there, you know, all
[9:24] the routines and all the rituals of the
[9:25] church, all the good commandments of the
[9:27] church, all the things we should do,
[9:28] they're all good, but it all boils down
[9:31] to do we have saving faith in Jesus
[9:33] Christ. Hallelujah. It boils down to
[9:35] that. Hallelujah. And brother said, "And
[9:38] many take the communion today that will
[9:40] never see God." And those words kind of
[9:42] jumped at me today as I was studying.
[9:43] They'll never see God as far as in a
[9:47] friendship or role of of Christ and the
[9:51] church. They're going to see Jesus at
[9:53] the white throne judgment, but they're
[9:55] not going to see him uh through the eyes
[9:57] of love.
[9:59] Hallelujah. And we'll see that, of
[10:00] course, it's in the scripture. He said,
[10:02] 'But you cannot be a partaker of
[10:04] salvation and not see him because
[10:06] salvation is a gift of God and communion
[10:09] is a com commemoration of the great
[10:12] allsufficient sacrifice that was made
[10:14] for that salvation. It's to let people
[10:17] see that we believe in the death,
[10:19] burial, and resurrection of the Lord
[10:21] Jesus. It represents a finished work. So
[10:25] here we get the idea where Jesus says he
[10:27] says do some works in private, right? He
[10:29] said fast, pray, give alms in private.
[10:32] He said, "But then do these things
[10:33] publicly." These three things we're
[10:35] going to look at here tonight, right? Uh
[10:37] water baptism, feet washing, and
[10:39] communion. Do those things publicly
[10:42] because you're a city on a hill that
[10:43] cannot be hidden. Hallelujah. So, some
[10:46] things do in private, but some things do
[10:48] in public so everybody knows which side
[10:50] you're on. Amen. Okay. And it lets them
[10:54] know when you take communion, it lets
[10:56] everybody know I'm remembering the death
[10:58] of Jesus and the resurrection. Amen.
[11:00] It's a finished work. I'm a believer.
[11:02] Praise God. But then when you when you
[11:05] serve God with prayer, fasting, giving
[11:06] alms, that's in private. So you have a
[11:08] public Christian life, but then you're
[11:10] supposed to have a private Christian
[11:11] life as well.
[11:14] Hallelujah. Now, which one is the devil
[11:16] going to fight you on the most? The
[11:17] private one, right? Because we all come
[11:20] to church, act like everything's okay,
[11:22] and most of the time it is okay. Right?
[11:25] But there's times it's not okay. And the
[11:28] enemy is always mo normally with the
[11:30] believer, the true believer, he's
[11:31] fighting him on his private Christian
[11:33] life.
[11:35] But see, we're still called to do public
[11:37] ministry by the grace of God. Okay? It
[11:39] represents a finished work. Now, see,
[11:41] those words stood out like where I said,
[11:43] uh, there's a lot of people that take
[11:45] communion that will never see God. And
[11:46] so, that made me think of this. Blessed
[11:48] are the pure in heart, for they shall
[11:50] see God. Hallelujah. Now, what does this
[11:53] remind me of? Then it then it leads me
[11:55] to Matthew 7 where uh they say, "Lord,
[11:57] Lord, did we not prophesy? Did we not
[11:59] cast out devils? Did we not do many
[12:01] wonderful works?" And Jesus says, Jesus
[12:02] is going to say, "I never knew you.
[12:04] You're a work of iniquity." Now, did
[12:06] they see Jesus?
[12:08] Yes. But they didn't see him with eyes
[12:11] of grace. They saw him with eyes of fire
[12:13] and of judgment. Hallelujah. Can
[12:16] everybody see that? That's right. See,
[12:19] so uh we we must understand there's two
[12:22] types of way Jesus is going to see you.
[12:24] Either through grace or judgment. How
[12:26] many want the grace of Christ?
[12:27] Hallelujah. I want him to look at me
[12:29] through grace.
[12:31] And so what do I do? I I I I I daily
[12:35] seek after the Lord. Hallelujah. I daily
[12:36] seek God. I die daily as Paul said. So I
[12:39] want to be a worker of righteousness,
[12:41] not a worker of iniquity.
[12:44] Glory, church. We don't want to live
[12:46] double lives.
[12:48] Hallelujah. Now, and church, if if we
[12:51] make mistakes, let's be honest. Let's
[12:53] confess it to the person we sinned
[12:54] against. Let's just get it right.
[12:57] And church, I found out too, you can
[12:59] only keep things in so long. And you can
[13:01] only lose so many battles so long before
[13:03] you should tell somebody.
[13:06] Right? If you keep struggling inside and
[13:08] can't get the victory, come talk to me.
[13:10] Come talk to somebody. Talk to a trusted
[13:12] sister, a trusted brother, someone who's
[13:14] real mature in the Lord that you know
[13:15] won't won't share it about share it out.
[13:18] Don't suffer there in and just completed
[13:21] uh just completed repetitious uh slavery
[13:25] to sin. Tell somebody about it. The
[13:26] Bible said confess your sins.
[13:28] Hallelujah.
[13:30] Hallelujah.
[13:32] You know, sometimes people just need
[13:33] accountability, which is it's a great
[13:34] help. Praise
[13:36] God. Tell somebody. Pray. They'll pray
[13:38] for you. They'll give you some wisdom.
[13:40] They'll give you some insight.
[13:41] Hallelujah.
[13:43] I'm talking about when they I'm talking
[13:44] about when you're caught in a snare like
[13:46] second Timothy says and you can't get
[13:48] out of the snare and you need help, go
[13:51] to somebody. Reach out to somebody. God
[13:53] will bless you for that. Praise God.
[13:55] Because you're trying to get out of the
[13:56] snare. Hallelujah. And if you can't get
[13:59] out, reach out to somebody for help. And
[14:00] the church said,
[14:02] now in most cases, if you sin and you're
[14:04] in sin, it's because you've sinned
[14:06] against somebody else. You should go
[14:07] tell the person you've sinned against
[14:08] them. That's right. So, don't live a
[14:12] double life. Don't just always serve God
[14:15] with all your heart. Live a single life.
[14:18] Yes, we're all going to fall short.
[14:19] We're going to make mistakes. But Jesus
[14:21] will bless you if you confess your sins.
[14:23] Praise God. And then, church, God sees,
[14:26] of course, the motives and intents of
[14:27] our heart. Now, I just I thought I'd
[14:29] show you this. Look at what pure means.
[14:31] Now, these are this is physical. This is
[14:33] Levitical, but this this would be us.
[14:36] Ethically, we're free from corrupt
[14:38] desires. Now, we have the desires of the
[14:40] flesh every single
[14:41] day. So, this must mean we crucify those
[14:45] desires as much as possible because none
[14:48] of us will ever get the sinless
[14:50] perfection, right? But we can, the Bible
[14:53] says we can have a pure heart. We'll be
[14:56] blessed if we strive with all of our
[14:58] striving, with all of our strength, with
[15:00] all of our diligence. We'll be blessed
[15:02] if we strive to have a pure heart.
[15:07] None of us will ever be totally free
[15:09] from sin. But we must be crucifying
[15:12] those corrupt desires, the sin and the
[15:15] guilt. Be live as close as we can free
[15:19] from every ad mixture of what is false.
[15:21] Do you know I was talking to brother Rod
[15:22] on the way down there and church it
[15:23] reminded me there was a movement
[15:25] actually it was the Wesleyan movement of
[15:27] uh John Wesley and then they brought it
[15:30] into the Pentecostals. You know what the
[15:31] movement was? The movement it was called
[15:33] total sanctification. Which means they
[15:36] preached you had to constantly live
[15:37] sanctified. You had to live every day
[15:39] sin-free or you would lose your
[15:41] salvation. Church, guess what? That
[15:43] revival didn't last very long. Because
[15:45] the people found out, I can't go just a
[15:48] couple days without making a mistake.
[15:51] Hallelujah. So imagine walking in them.
[15:53] The preacher say, "If you sin today,
[15:55] you're going to hell. You better get to
[15:56] the altar." Now, how many services is it
[15:58] going to have to go to where that's just
[15:59] going to get it's going to get old?
[16:01] Well, I failed again. You get
[16:02] discouraged. Think how Satan beat them
[16:04] up. so much. Now, I don't want to go so
[16:07] far where it's okay where you everybody
[16:08] here feels it's okay to sin every day.
[16:11] It's it's not it shouldn't be okay to
[16:13] sin every day, right? It shouldn't be
[16:15] okay to remain in sin, but you also
[16:18] can't go too far and try to preach
[16:19] something so high you'll never attain to
[16:21] it. We ought to preach as high as we can
[16:23] attain to. Praise God. In other words,
[16:26] die daily. Have a pure heart. Uh but I
[16:29] was reminded of that that was in history
[16:31] and it it only lasted so long.
[16:35] And so it it takes this uh sincerity
[16:38] here uh to recognize here the Lord and
[16:41] ask ourselves, Lord, am I really serving
[16:43] you with a pure
[16:44] heart? Is my motive pure for being in
[16:47] service here
[16:48] tonight? Am I pure around my children?
[16:52] Am I pure with my wife? Hallelujah. Am I
[16:55] pure at work? That's what God wants us
[16:57] to see. And then God will bless our
[17:00] efforts to be pure. Amen. God's not
[17:02] asking for total uh sinlessness. It's
[17:05] impossible. Hallelujah. As Paul taught
[17:08] us in Matthew chapter I'm sorry, Romans
[17:09] chapter 7. He said, "When I want to do
[17:11] good, sin's right there and I do what I
[17:13] hate." He said, "But how does he end it?
[17:15] But thanks be to God who gives me the
[17:17] victory through Lord Jesus Christ."
[17:19] Hallelujah.
[17:20] So, I like what Albert Barnes said this.
[17:22] I think he was a Baptist preacher in the
[17:24] 1800s. Brother B mentioned him in the
[17:26] church age book. He says, uh, "Pure in
[17:28] heart. Those whose minds, motives, and
[17:30] principles are pure, who seek not only
[17:32] to have the external actions correct, I
[17:34] like that. But who desire to be holy in
[17:37] heart and who are so. Man looks on the
[17:41] outward appearance, but God looks on the
[17:44] heart. Hallelujah. That was referring,
[17:46] of course, to
[17:47] David. You know, that's what God that's
[17:50] what God told uh Samuel. Uh they thought
[17:52] all the big tall guys were the pure in
[17:54] heart, but God said, "No, David's the
[17:55] one who's got a pure heart." The church,
[17:57] how do we know he's pure? When he was
[17:58] caught in sin, he remember he was caught
[18:00] in adultery. What did he do? Did he
[18:02] fight back? No. He said, "You're right.
[18:04] I've sinned." And he went and sat in the
[18:06] church and cried and pleaded for God to
[18:09] spare the boy. That's a pure heart. So,
[18:13] see, he got caught in a snare. He got
[18:15] caught and he was living in sin for a
[18:16] while. But what did a pure heart do once
[18:18] it got identified? It repented and went
[18:21] to the house of God and pleaded for
[18:22] mercy. And the church said, "We're all
[18:26] going to go through difficult seasons.
[18:27] We're all going to make mistakes. We're
[18:28] all going to be ashamed of ourselves.
[18:30] But pick yourself up. Go back to the
[18:32] house of God. Confess your sin. Start
[18:34] Aresh. You'll feel God's spirit come on
[18:36] you. Aresh. He'll restore the joy of
[18:39] your salvation. You didn't lose your
[18:41] salvation. You just lost the joy of it.
[18:43] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[18:46] Blessed are the pure in heart. So,
[18:48] people take communion without a pure
[18:50] heart. In other words, they can they
[18:52] live in continual works of iniquity.
[18:54] They're addicted to sin. and they're
[18:55] living in in uh uh living snared
[18:58] constantly in uh uh addiction to sin.
[19:03] And those are the ones that are not
[19:04] living with a pure heart. And then he
[19:07] says they shall see God. See, there's a
[19:09] sense in which all will see God. What
[19:11] doesn't Revelation 17 says that? Yeah,
[19:13] let me read that. Revelation 17. The
[19:14] Bible said, "Every eye will see
[19:16] him." So that's the great balance,
[19:18] church. Yes. Behold, he cometh with
[19:20] clouds, and every eye shall see him, and
[19:22] they also which pierce him, and all the
[19:23] kings of the earth shall wail because of
[19:25] him. Even so, amen. So, blessed are the
[19:28] pure in heart. They shall see God.
[19:30] Everybody's going to see God, but only
[19:32] the sheep, right? And the bride are
[19:33] going to see him with eyes of
[19:35] love. Every other eye that sees him is
[19:38] going to see him with a eye of judgment,
[19:41] right? Because they failed to repent of
[19:43] their sins. So, everyone's going to see
[19:45] him. I'll say like this. Who wants to
[19:46] see him in the millennium? Oh, amen.
[19:49] That's who I want to I want to see Jesus
[19:51] in the millennium. Praise God. That
[19:52] means I'm on the earth. That means I'm
[19:54] ruling on the earth. If I see Jesus in
[19:56] the millennium. Praise God.
[19:59] Hallelujah. See, that is they'll behold
[20:02] him as a
[20:04] judge, not as a friend. That's in
[20:06] Revelation 17. It's seeing him as a
[20:08] judge, not a friend. In this place, it
[20:11] is spoken of as a special favor. Blessed
[20:13] are the pure in heart for they shall see
[20:15] God. It's a a special blessing to them.
[20:18] So also Revelation 22:4, "And they shall
[20:20] see his face." Hallelujah. Those who are
[20:22] in the future home, the new Jerusalem,
[20:25] to see the face of one or to be in the
[20:27] presence of anyone were terms among the
[20:29] Jews expressed of great favor. It was
[20:31] regarded as a high honor to be in the
[20:33] presence of kings and princes and to be
[20:34] permitted to see them. Proverbs 22 29,
[20:38] he shall stand before kings. Now, isn't
[20:40] that true today? You get to see the
[20:42] president of the United States or even
[20:44] the president of a company, right? get
[20:46] to see somebody of high regard. Oh, and
[20:49] you start cleaning yourself
[20:50] up. How do I look? You know, you're
[20:53] going to see somebody. You're going to
[20:55] see somebody really important. Oh my
[20:57] goodness. I'm going to go meet the
[20:59] governor today. I'm going to I'm going
[21:00] to go see the mayor. He wants to see me.
[21:02] She wants to see me. You know, in the
[21:05] even the Bible days, that was so
[21:07] important. If you saw somebody's face,
[21:09] it's either good or bad. Same today.
[21:11] Hallelujah.
[21:16] He says uh 2 Kings 25:19, "Those that
[21:19] stood in the king's presence in the
[21:20] Hebrew, those that saw the face of the
[21:22] king, that is who were his favorites and
[21:24] his friends." And church, don't forget,
[21:26] you are God's beloved. And the church
[21:28] said, "Amen." That means his favorites.
[21:31] That's what the Greek
[21:33] means. Hallelujah. In other words,
[21:35] you're his children, chosen before the
[21:37] foundation of the world. So here to see
[21:39] God means to see I'm sorry to be his
[21:42] friends and favorites and to dwell with
[21:44] him in his kingdom. Blessed are the pure
[21:47] in heart. They shall see God. Blessed
[21:49] are the people who take of the the cup
[21:52] and drink the bread with a pure heart.
[21:54] Oh God, I remember. Thank you for
[21:55] shedding your blood for me. Thank you
[21:57] for letting your body be ripped in
[21:58] shreds so I could be saved. Do it with a
[22:01] pure heart. Not like, "Oh, I'm just
[22:04] going because I I don't want anybody to
[22:05] think I'm backsliding or I'll just do
[22:07] it. I can't wait to get out of here
[22:08] after feet washing. Oh, do I have to
[22:09] wash brother Jesse's feet again, you
[22:11] know, just uh, you know, you got to take
[22:14] it and that's and brother boils it down
[22:15] to this. You we must take it with
[22:17] sincerity."
[22:19] Brother, you'll see here in just a
[22:20] moment, Brother brings it down. Uh,
[22:22] brothers, brothers, last recording was
[22:24] about communion. I'm going to hit the
[22:25] highlights. I don't have them up here,
[22:26] but I'm just going to hit the
[22:27] highlights.
[22:32] Uh, let me just skip down
[22:35] here just for the sake of time. I
[22:37] already feel like I'm gone gone long. I
[22:39] already got 25 minutes in here. 20
[22:41] minutes
[22:42] in. So, brother starts this recording,
[22:45] his last recording by saying uh that he
[22:48] met a brother who believed you only take
[22:51] spiritual communion, not literal
[22:53] communion. Now, I never heard that till
[22:55] I listen to brother Ram's tapes. There
[22:56] are some churches that believe we don't
[22:59] they actually don't partake of the bread
[23:01] and wine or wash feet because they
[23:03] believe it's all
[23:04] spiritual. And so I just thought it was
[23:06] interesting if you never heard it
[23:08] before. This will give you some
[23:09] ammunition or this will help sharpen
[23:11] your sword if you talk to him online.
[23:12] Brother Chris on
[23:14] Facebook. Brother said I was called a
[23:16] few days ago by some very fine Christian
[23:19] gentlemen that never had this communion
[23:22] and he understood we only taken
[23:23] communion literally.
[23:26] They take it, they call spiritual
[23:28] communion. He says, "But communion means
[23:31] to talk to." How many know that the word
[23:32] communion means to talk to? So when we
[23:34] take communion, we're talking to the
[23:36] Lord, saying, "Thank you, Lord. I
[23:38] remember what you did. Thank you for
[23:40] dying for me. Thank you for shedding
[23:41] your blood for me, and let me talk it
[23:43] over. Let me treat the body the right
[23:45] way. Make sure, Lord, purify my heart.
[23:47] Uh I'm examining myself, Lord. Help me,
[23:50] Lord, to treat your body the right way
[23:51] so I don't bring a curse upon me."
[23:54] That's right.
[23:56] Now, brother says, "The reason I'm
[23:57] saying this is because the man
[23:59] said,"Now, don't we take the word of
[24:01] God? Isn't that God that we're taking?"
[24:03] Now, look at his argument. I believe the
[24:06] word. I believe the preaching and don't
[24:08] we take it spiritually? And brother Ram
[24:10] said, "That's exactly right, sir." Did
[24:13] you know you can have communion
[24:15] tonight? And I don't have any bread
[24:16] ready for you, but you can have
[24:17] communion tonight. In fact, that's the
[24:19] whole point of coming tonight, so you
[24:21] can have communion with Jesus Christ.
[24:22] Amen. But look what brother says. You're
[24:24] exactly right, sir. True. But we read
[24:27] here that they actually took the literal
[24:30] Lord's supper, Paul says. So, Brother
[24:33] Ram says, "Yeah, you got a certain
[24:34] amount of truth, but actually, look what
[24:36] Paul did. They actually took the bread
[24:38] and the wine as
[24:39] well." Okay, so see what are they doing?
[24:42] They're only taking part of the word.
[24:43] They're actually cutting out some of the
[24:45] word. They're taking away from the word.
[24:47] But the Bible said, "Don't add or take
[24:49] away. Do all the word."
[24:52] Brother Ram says that he said this to in
[24:55] remembrance of me as Jesus said so
[24:58] oft remembrance of me you show forth the
[25:01] Lord's death till he comes. See now we
[25:03] are to take
[25:04] it. And then he says
[25:07] uh now we only have three physical
[25:10] divine orders left of us. One of them is
[25:12] communion, feet washing, water baptis
[25:14] baptism. That's the only three things.
[25:16] That's the perfection of the three. See
[25:18] I looked over the threes last week.
[25:19] Remember we looked at number three.
[25:20] Three is perfection.
[25:23] He says, "And that's the only three
[25:24] orders we have." We realize that was the
[25:26] issue given by St. Paul in the New
[25:28] Testament. Now, if we would say the
[25:30] communion should be just taking the
[25:31] word, I don't believe anyone has a right
[25:33] to take the Lord's supper until he's
[25:35] taken the word of the Lord into his
[25:36] heart. So, Brother Ram goes with him a
[25:38] little bit. Yes, you've got to take the
[25:40] spiritual word first, then you can have
[25:42] communion. Okay?
[25:45] He says, "But on the same basis, we
[25:47] could absolutely justify the Salvation
[25:49] Army because they do not believe in any
[25:52] form of water baptism because they say
[25:54] we're already baptized spiritually. So
[25:56] why do we get baptized
[25:58] naturally?" So, Brother Bam's dealing
[26:00] with two two churches that both say,
[26:03] "Well, we do communion spiritually. We
[26:05] do water baptism spiritually. Why should
[26:07] we do it naturally?" And brother Bram's
[26:09] main emphasis is the Bible says we
[26:12] should.
[26:15] He says,
[26:16] "Now they say the water can't save you.
[26:19] The blood saves you." Brother says, "I
[26:21] agree with that." So see, they got a
[26:24] partial truth, but not a full truth.
[26:26] Praise
[26:27] God. Brother says, "But we must take the
[26:30] water as a outward emotion and that an
[26:33] inward work of grace has been done."
[26:35] See, we must do the same on communion.
[26:38] Praise God.
[26:39] So, brother says with these three
[26:41] symbols, we must do them spiritually and
[26:44] we must do them
[26:45] physically. Hallelujah.
[26:48] Right? So, we just looked at
[26:50] uh we just looked at communion and water
[26:52] baptism. We just read first Peter 3,
[26:54] remember on Sunday, what does the Bible
[26:56] say? Does the water save you, brother
[26:57] Patrick? Did the water save you last
[26:59] summer? No. It was the answer of your
[27:01] good conscience toward God, brother
[27:03] Claude. When you said, "Yes, Lord, I
[27:06] accept the blood of Jesus Christ and
[27:07] forgive me. I'm going to heaven. That's
[27:09] when you were saved. Praise God. You
[27:11] were saved before you went down the
[27:13] water.
[27:14] Hallelujah. That's what saved you, not
[27:16] the water. But see, the the Salvation
[27:18] Army goes so far on that side. Well,
[27:20] see, I got a good conscience. What do I
[27:21] need the water for? Well, then you go
[27:23] back to the book of Acts and Peter says,
[27:25] "You've got the Holy Ghost in your
[27:26] soul." Good. Now, I command you, go
[27:28] baptize your physical body, right?
[27:30] Hallelujah. Amen. So see these false
[27:34] doctrines what many times they just have
[27:36] a little bit of truth but not the rest
[27:38] of the truth of the Bible. Our beliefs
[27:40] brother Chris since he's newer here I'm
[27:42] letting him know our beliefs should
[27:43] agree with all the teachings of the
[27:44] Bible
[27:46] and that's what I believe they do by the
[27:48] grace of God. So brother deals with that
[27:50] first. He said it's more than spiritual
[27:52] communion. It's more than spiritual
[27:54] baptism. It's actually physical as well.
[27:59] Okay. Hallelujah. And then brother Ram
[28:02] says, of course, remember Paul is the
[28:04] one who taught this. And and then he
[28:05] goes to Galatians 1:8. He says, Paul
[28:07] said, if an angel from heaven comes and
[28:09] says, anything else, let him be
[28:11] accursed. So see, the same one that had
[28:13] them rebaptized in Acts 19 was Paul from
[28:16] the baptism of John to be baptized in
[28:18] the name of Jesus Christ. So look how
[28:19] brother dismantles their
[28:22] arguments. Amen. He says, "The man who
[28:25] wrote about Paul, he's an apostle. He
[28:27] was ordained by Jesus Christ. And even
[28:29] he baptized in physical water, not just
[28:32] spiritual baptism. And the same man that
[28:34] did that said, "If you change anything I
[28:36] wrote, you're cursed." He said, "Eat the
[28:38] bread and uh drink the wine." That's
[28:40] what Paul said. The man who helped start
[28:42] the Gentile church ages. That's
[28:45] right. All
[28:48] right. And here's what I like this quote
[28:50] here. He
[28:52] says, he says, "Now you say, well, the
[28:54] Salvation Army takes the point. Well,
[28:56] the dying thief when he died, he wasn't
[28:57] baptized yet. Jesus said he'd be in
[28:59] heaven. So, here's another argument they
[29:00] say. Well, I don't need to be baptized.
[29:02] The dying thief was saved and he was
[29:04] never baptized. Notice what brother
[29:06] says. That's that's right. That's
[29:07] exactly the truth. That's exactly right.
[29:09] He
[29:10] says, but you see, he only recognized
[29:13] Jesus right there in the hour he was
[29:16] dying. See, that's the only opportunity
[29:19] he had. He was a thief. He was away. He
[29:21] was out. And as soon as he seen the
[29:23] light, he recognized it and said, "Lord,
[29:25] remember me." And that was true. But to
[29:29] you and I who know that we should be
[29:30] baptized and refuse to do it, then
[29:32] that'll be between you and God. Same
[29:34] thing in communion.
[29:36] Hallelujah. So, brother dismantles both
[29:39] of their arguments. Praise God. Now,
[29:41] church, that saved thief on the cross,
[29:43] that's why we believe people could be
[29:45] dying on their bed and they could have
[29:46] done all evil things, but if they
[29:48] repented, they could be saved right
[29:49] there. Praise God. And they don't have
[29:51] to be baptized. Now, they'd want to, but
[29:53] if they don't have the chance, they can
[29:55] still be saved because Jesus Christ the
[29:56] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[29:58] forever. So, if he saved somebody in
[30:01] their last moments at the cross, he can
[30:03] save anybody their last moments any
[30:04] time. Praise God. Because he's the same
[30:06] yesterday, today, and forever. He
[30:08] doesn't change. Hallelujah. But if you
[30:10] have the chance, how could you deny
[30:12] being buried out of gratitude to the one
[30:15] who died for you and saved your soul?
[30:17] Praise God. Amen. Why would you be
[30:19] ashamed to go down under water to rem to
[30:22] recognize that Christ died for you and
[30:24] that you want to die with him and raised
[30:26] with him? Praise God. You wouldn't be
[30:28] ashamed. So, see, it's an evil spirit
[30:31] keeping people from getting the Holy
[30:32] Ghost. They don't even get baptized in
[30:35] physical water. Well, then you're how
[30:36] you going to get the Holy Ghost? And if
[30:38] you did, then you get baptized right
[30:39] away, like the book of Acts, chapter 10.
[30:42] So, see, and the Bible said God gives
[30:44] the Holy Ghost to them that obey him in
[30:46] Acts 5:32.
[30:48] All
[30:49] right. Now, that's a pretty good
[30:51] highlight to me. After the same manner,
[30:54] also he took the cup. This is going to
[30:56] be a lot of review. And when he had up,
[30:57] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[30:58] in my blood. This do ye as often as you
[31:00] drink it in remembrance of me. For as
[31:03] often as you eat this bread and drink
[31:05] this cup, you do show the Lord's death
[31:07] to you come." See, you show to other
[31:09] people. Oh, what are you doing this
[31:10] week? You got communion this weekend?
[31:12] Oh, what's that all about? Well, I'm
[31:14] remembering the death of Jesus Christ.
[31:16] Oh, you believe in the death? Oh, yes.
[31:18] Yes, I believe in the death and the
[31:19] resurrection. And he's resurrected. You
[31:21] ask me how how does he how you know he
[31:22] lives? He lives in my
[31:24] heart. You show his death until he
[31:28] returns. As often as you eat this bread,
[31:31] drink this cup. You do show the Lord's
[31:32] death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever
[31:34] shall eat this bread and drink the cup
[31:36] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[31:38] of the body and blood of the
[31:41] Lord. But let a man examine himself.
[31:44] That's why we do a moment of silence,
[31:45] Brother Chris. as you're familiar. And
[31:47] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[31:49] of that cup. So we must examine
[31:51] ourselves. Lord, am I living the right
[31:53] Christian life? For he that eateth and
[31:55] drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[31:56] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[31:58] discerning or judging the Lord's
[32:01] body. So the main thing here, even as
[32:03] we'll see in this chapter, they were uh
[32:05] they were mistreating each other. The
[32:07] rich Christians were mistreating the
[32:09] poor
[32:10] Christians. Remember that? And remember,
[32:13] some of them were suing the rich
[32:14] Christians were suing the poor
[32:16] ones. So, they were suing each other.
[32:18] Some of them had sexual sin, right? Uh
[32:21] some of them were getting drunk. Some of
[32:23] them were in division, speaking evil, uh
[32:26] thinking they're greater than other
[32:27] people in the church. And so, they
[32:29] weren't judging, they weren't discerning
[32:30] the Lord's people the right
[32:34] way. Now, look what happened. Now, this
[32:36] is pretty striking here, brother Chris.
[32:38] Because of all this sin, look, this
[32:39] church was dying fast. This this church
[32:41] had a lot of people that died and were
[32:44] sick. For this cause, many are weak and
[32:47] sickly among you, and many sleep. So,
[32:49] this church was big at first, but they
[32:51] were starting to quickly die out because
[32:53] of all the sins in the
[32:55] church. Now, Brother Chris, I've seen
[32:57] that one time, and I just told brother
[32:58] uh who which brother did I tell about
[33:01] it? I seen it one time in my mom's
[33:03] church back home. It's Assemblies of God
[33:05] Church. I was telling Brother Rod.
[33:07] There's a meeting when we first come in
[33:09] the message, brother Chris, about
[33:10] serpent seed and Simon and them uh my
[33:12] sister were
[33:13] there and they were standing up for
[33:15] brother Brandham and the serpent seed.
[33:17] Well, the the preacher, the Assemblies
[33:19] of God's uh pastor's wife got angry. She
[33:22] said, "Thus say the Lord, serpent seeds
[33:24] of the
[33:26] devil." And the next year, I think my
[33:28] mom said there was either 15 or 20
[33:30] funerals that struck the church. Healthy
[33:32] people uh just got sick and died. And
[33:36] then the uh the woman's husband came
[33:38] down with Parkinson's and it cut short
[33:41] of his ministry. He could barely
[33:43] whisper. He shakes all the time.
[33:46] Uh and and that that's an example. They
[33:50] weren't treating the Lord's body.
[33:51] They're actually bringing they were
[33:52] actually using the Lord's name to curse
[33:54] the revelation of the
[33:57] Lord. Hallelujah. And that's where
[33:59] that's the only time I've really seen
[34:02] that 15 or 20 in one year. here. I
[34:04] remember my mom telling me and she was
[34:05] so upset. I said, "Mom, I think it has
[34:07] something to do with what was
[34:10] said." So, this church was really big
[34:13] and then remember church remember they
[34:14] had all the gifts
[34:16] operating but they were doing too many
[34:18] tongues, too many interpretations, too
[34:20] many prophecies. Paul said just two or
[34:21] three. Okay, two or three. Limited two
[34:23] or three every service because if
[34:25] there's so much being said, how can you
[34:26] keep up with all that? Right? So Paul
[34:29] says keep it two or three. They had all
[34:31] those shouting, speaking tongues,
[34:33] prophesying. We have the church was
[34:35] dying out. Lots of people dying. Many,
[34:38] not not a few church. Let's all say
[34:39] many. Ready? Many people were dying and
[34:42] getting sick in the church because
[34:43] they're m they're suing each other,
[34:44] sleeping around, right? We went through
[34:46] that. Prideful
[34:49] divisions, getting
[34:50] drunk, all these things. And church,
[34:53] I've seen it just by a person speaking
[34:55] against the Lord. And it wasn't just
[34:57] that. I found out later the pastor was
[34:58] actually cussing at the people, using
[35:00] cuss words at the people, rebuking them
[35:03] for complaining from the pulpit. Cuss
[35:06] words. And there was other sins too.
[35:08] I'll just I'm let me just say there was
[35:10] obesity in the church. I'm talking about
[35:12] overeing in the
[35:15] church. There was sins in the church.
[35:17] Lust of the flesh and the church said,
[35:20] who knows what else was there. Maybe
[35:21] there was sexual sin. I don't know.
[35:22] That's just what I knew about. And I
[35:24] wasn't even a part of the church
[35:25] anymore. It's so important how we treat
[35:27] each other. Hallelujah.
[35:32] Now, before I get to the next one, let
[35:34] me let get your Bibles ready. Um, this
[35:37] was a these are different slides I used
[35:39] uh three years ago when I preached on
[35:41] blessings and cursings. I preached a
[35:42] short series on that and I'm sure Naomi
[35:44] Beatatric might remember. Malachi, I
[35:45] might remember. Um, but got your Bibles
[35:48] here. Um, now the thing that's a little
[35:51] bit hard for Christians sometimes is
[35:54] when we see these warnings, but we see
[35:56] people sin and they doesn't look like
[35:58] they
[35:59] suffer. But church, they are suffering
[36:01] whether they show it or not. It's thus
[36:04] sayeth the word they're suffering.
[36:06] They're suffering from having no peace
[36:08] in their
[36:10] life. Hallelujah. Think about that,
[36:12] church. Just you and I being able to go
[36:13] to bed at night and have peace in our
[36:15] hearts, that is such a valuable thing.
[36:17] Most people on this earth do not have
[36:19] it.
[36:21] That's why they do drugs. That's why
[36:22] they do porn, right? Or that's why they
[36:24] do uh uh sports. They do anything they
[36:28] can do to try to get distracted away
[36:29] from the the war against God that they
[36:32] feel on the inside. Look at it. Look at
[36:34] it. It's Isaiah
[36:36] 48:22. There is no peace, sayaith who,
[36:39] the preacher. No. Sayaith the Lord unto
[36:42] the
[36:43] wicked. I've seen famous people like Tom
[36:46] Brady. he's a football player and uh
[36:48] Brad Pitt, he's a famous actor and other
[36:50] women too, famous actresses. They've
[36:52] gone on interviews and uh and they
[36:54] asked, "Are you happy?" And they're
[36:56] like, "No, now that we're famous, we got
[36:57] to hide out and we just sit in our
[36:58] houses and we can't go out in public."
[37:00] They're now slaves. They got all that
[37:02] money in the They got all that money in
[37:04] the bank account and they said, "Then we
[37:05] spend it all. We have so much we can't
[37:06] even we we can't even spend it all. We
[37:09] There's not enough things to spend it
[37:10] on." And they're miserable because you
[37:13] know why? God's word is true.
[37:16] There is no peace to the wicked.
[37:20] Is that right? No matter how much they
[37:23] try to put on. Why do you think all
[37:24] those women go through all those facial
[37:26] surgeries?
[37:28] Why Why can't they just have peace with
[37:30] how they are? They're already famous.
[37:31] No, they got to get more fa more
[37:33] whatever more lustful, whatever they
[37:34] want to be. Why can't they just have
[37:36] peace? Why can't that man who's got m
[37:38] Why can't just say remain married to
[37:40] that wife? Why does he need more
[37:43] women? Why? because they have no
[37:47] peace. But what does the Bible say? We
[37:50] have a peace. He's got a name. He's a
[37:52] person. His name is Jesus Christ.
[37:53] Hallelujah.
[37:56] Right? Like we sing that song, uh, God
[37:58] gave us something the world can't take
[37:59] away. The world can't take away our
[38:01] peace. We have something they'll never
[38:03] know about. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[38:06] Amen. Thus sayaith the Lord, the wicked
[38:09] have no peace.
[38:12] Now, they look all happy and on the
[38:14] outside and they got the money. They're
[38:15] walking on the red carpets, but they're
[38:17] actually walking on the road to hell.
[38:18] The Bible says, especially adulterers,
[38:21] they're they're paving their way to
[38:22] hell, the Bible
[38:24] says. Now, remember this uh uh Asaf
[38:28] wrote about this in Psalm 73. Got your
[38:30] Bible? Psalm 73:3. This bothered him.
[38:32] And church, it can bother us sometimes,
[38:34] too. This person leaves a message, that
[38:36] person leaves a message, and seem like
[38:38] nothing bad happens. Church, they have
[38:39] no peace in their heart.
[38:42] You cannot break the word of
[38:44] God. The Bible says they that don't have
[38:47] the Holy Ghost, they have the spirit of
[38:49] the world. They cannot receive the
[38:51] spirit of truth. It's impossible for
[38:53] them to receive the Holy Ghost because
[38:55] they have the spirit of the
[38:57] world. Right? Psalm
[39:05] 73:3. I took a took a moment for me to
[39:07] get there.
[39:11] I didn't get a chance to put that one on
[39:12] the slides there.
[39:14] 733. So, I was studying. The scripture
[39:16] came to my mind. For I was envious at
[39:18] the foolish when I saw the prosperity of
[39:21] the wicked. So, Asaf sees all these
[39:24] wicked and it looks like they're
[39:26] prospering. My everything, they're
[39:27] getting rich and famous and they look
[39:29] healthy and all these things. Everything
[39:30] looks good for them. Well, at least
[39:32] right now.
[39:35] It looks good, but it's not good. The
[39:38] Bible said, remember, just like the
[39:39] Pharisees, they whitewash the outside,
[39:42] but inward they're full of dead men's
[39:44] bones.
[39:47] Hallelujah. Right? That's what the
[39:49] scripture says. Verse four, for there
[39:52] are no bands in their death, but their
[39:54] strength is firm, but they are not in
[39:56] trouble as other men, neither are they
[39:57] plagued like other men. How come as a
[39:59] Christian, I get all these problems and
[40:00] look like these people have no
[40:03] problems? Uh, don't fret, child. God's
[40:06] for you. Hallelujah. God's got a chasen
[40:08] every child that he loves.
[40:12] That's how God does it. He don't let you
[40:14] get away with things because he loves
[40:15] you. Hallelujah.
[40:18] Verse six. Therefore, pride compass them
[40:21] about as a chain. See, they're ch
[40:23] actually chained up. Looks like
[40:24] everything's going good, but they're
[40:26] chained up in their
[40:27] pride. Violence coverth them as a
[40:29] garment. See, they do violent things.
[40:31] Especially the politicians with all
[40:33] their money and their power. They get
[40:34] people killed and they uh you know how
[40:37] it is. I ain't got to say their names.
[40:39] Past presidents and so forth. Their eyes
[40:41] stand out with fatness. They have more
[40:44] than heart could wish, right? They got
[40:45] so much money they don't even have all
[40:48] these guys. They got so much money they
[40:50] don't know what to do with it. But the
[40:52] Bible said they're in chains to pride.
[40:54] They're corrupt and speak wickedly
[40:56] concerning oppression. They speak
[40:57] loftily. They set their mouth against
[40:59] the heavens and their tongue walketh
[41:01] through the earth. They even speak
[41:02] against God and Christ, right? Joe
[41:05] Rogan's got the greatest podcast, right?
[41:07] But he speaks against God. He don't
[41:08] believe in God. How can he still
[41:10] prosper? Nature. How can he still get
[41:11] better and better all the
[41:13] time? Because it's this. It's this. They
[41:16] prosper for a while, but let's see what
[41:19] Let's see what they're like at the end.
[41:21] Hallelujah. Now, I hope Joe Rogan get
[41:24] saved. Don't get me wrong. I hope all
[41:25] these people get saved, but a lot of
[41:27] them
[41:29] won't, right? He says this verse uh 10,
[41:33] therefore his people return hither, and
[41:35] waters of a full cup are rung out to
[41:37] them, and they say, "How do God know?
[41:39] And there is knowledge, and is there
[41:41] knowledge in the most high?" They're
[41:42] even questioning Almighty God. Behold,
[41:44] these are the ungodly who prosper in
[41:46] this world. They increase in riches. You
[41:48] would think, if you read, I've been
[41:50] reading Proverbs, you would think the
[41:52] holy people would get rich. Not
[41:54] always. Sometimes it's the sinners who
[41:56] get rich.
[41:59] Verily, I have cleansed my heart in
[42:00] vain. So, see, look, the devil's bound.
[42:02] Oh, see, you're you're living all this
[42:04] dedicated life in vain. You're not
[42:05] getting nothing out of it. Oh, yes you
[42:07] are, church. Your treasures just aren't
[42:09] here. Your treasures are up higher.
[42:12] Hallelujah. Praise God. Let them have
[42:15] all they want down here. It's going to
[42:16] be burnt anyway. Praise God. It's going
[42:19] to be burnt and then it's going to be
[42:20] all made new for you and I. Praise
[42:23] God. For a thousand
[42:26] years. Verse 14. All for all the day
[42:29] long have I been plagued and chasened
[42:31] every morning. I got a battle against
[42:33] sin, but from the time I get up, mercy
[42:35] to the time I go to bed, and looks like
[42:37] they got an easy
[42:38] life. Don't complain. God knows what
[42:40] he's
[42:42] doing. And if I say, I will speak thus,
[42:44] behold, I should offend against the
[42:46] generation of thy children. When I
[42:47] thought to know this, it was too painful
[42:49] for me. See, it was so painful. How come
[42:51] these people have such easy lives? It
[42:53] seems like they're so blessed, but my
[42:55] life is a struggle.
[42:57] And I don't get ahead like other
[43:00] people. It's a chastening of the
[43:03] Lord. And church, God, like brother
[43:06] said, God knew if I had that money, if I
[43:08] God knew if I had too much money, he
[43:10] probably couldn't trust me with
[43:11] it. Think about, church, think how
[43:14] faithful you are with the money you have
[43:15] now. What if you had a lot more? You'd
[43:18] still be unfaithful with it. Now, if
[43:21] you're faithful now, praise God, then
[43:22] you'll be ruled over much in the
[43:24] millennium, right? But that's what
[43:26] brother A said. Maybe uh you talking
[43:28] about the future home, right, of Or
[43:29] Roberts and all these future homes. He
[43:31] said, 'Lord, well maybe you just
[43:32] couldn't trust me with it. But the Lord
[43:34] said, "Look up. Your portion's in
[43:36] heaven.
[43:37] Your reward is in heaven." But see, Asa
[43:40] battled this. How come these sinners,
[43:43] they just get stronger and wiser, more
[43:46] masked like wiser, worldly worldly
[43:48] knowledge, they get richer all the
[43:50] time?
[43:52] Verse 17. It was too painful for me. It
[43:56] was so hard to see why the sinners and
[43:57] wicked people get blessed until I went
[44:00] to the sanctuary of God. Then I
[44:02] understood their
[44:04] end. Then I saw where they're going to
[44:07] end up at at the end of their
[44:11] life, right? Who really loves them? Do
[44:14] they really love God? Is they're going
[44:15] to have are they going to have any real
[44:16] lasting heavenly reward? Of course not.
[44:20] Now, could they be saved? The Bible said
[44:21] they can be saved, but they'll have no
[44:23] reward if they repent at the very
[44:25] end. Hallelujah. So, I went to church
[44:28] and I saw, well, it's all about the end.
[44:31] Hallelujah. It's all about where do you
[44:33] go at the moment where your spirit, God
[44:35] calls your spirit and soul, are you
[44:37] going up or down? May God help us to go
[44:39] up to paradise. Praise God. That's why
[44:42] he died. Hallelujah. That's why he sent
[44:44] his son Jesus.
[44:46] Verse 18. Surely thou deset them in the
[44:49] slippery places. Thou castest them down
[44:51] into destruction. So see, they're
[44:54] walking slippery slopes. Pretty soon
[44:56] they're going to fall in
[44:57] disgrace. How many famous sports stars
[45:00] have we seen fall and preachers even
[45:02] last year fall into sexual sin? That's
[45:04] the most slippery slope there is for
[45:07] men. How many fall? Just this week,
[45:09] another one. Uh that famous football
[45:11] player who's now he's an NF, he's a Hall
[45:13] of Famer and he's caught with all this
[45:16] wickedness. And you would think he's got
[45:18] 200 $300 million. Why couldn't you stay
[45:20] away from prostitutes or something like
[45:22] that? It's because the Bible said the
[45:25] eyes of lust are never satisfied. In
[45:27] other words, he has no peace. He can't
[45:30] have peace because he doesn't have
[45:31] Christ. Hallelujah. But if you've got
[45:33] Christ, you've got the peace of God.
[45:37] Yes.
[45:39] how they're brought to death desolation
[45:41] in a moment. Verse 19, they're utterly
[45:43] consumed with
[45:44] terrors. Now, that guy's going to have
[45:46] so many lawsuits. He's getting sued for
[45:48] now $50
[45:49] million because of his sexual sin with
[45:53] prostitutes. And now everybody's talking
[45:55] about him evil all over the internet.
[45:57] I'd rather stay off that. I just rather
[45:59] have I just rather talk to the angels
[46:00] myself. Praise God. Let me just talk to
[46:03] the angels and the saints of God.
[46:04] Hallelujah. That's right.
[46:07] Now look, go down to verse 22. So
[46:09] foolish was I and ignorant. I was as a
[46:11] beast before the look what he says. I
[46:13] was foolish to think that these people
[46:15] had a good life. They have an awful
[46:18] life. These rich people, these famous
[46:20] people, they have an awful life. I heard
[46:22] numerous boxers when they got famous,
[46:24] uh, you know, Tyson Fury, he said he was
[46:27] a Christian, but now it doesn't look
[46:28] like it now, but he said he regrets even
[46:31] being famous now because he can't go
[46:32] anywhere. Can't have any, he can't take
[46:34] his family anywhere. church, we we
[46:36] sometimes forget the blessings of just
[46:38] going to the park on
[46:40] Saturday because if you were famous, you
[46:42] couldn't go there. Everyone run up to
[46:44] you, sign it, sign it, sign
[46:46] it. They say getting famous is a trap.
[46:49] It's a snare. It's not even a good life
[46:52] to
[46:53] live because everybody wants you.
[46:55] Everybody wants something from you. How
[46:56] many How many of those famous people say
[46:58] people only call them to ask for money?
[47:03] So, if you're poor and people contact
[47:04] you and love you, that's a real good
[47:06] sign they love you. If they're not
[47:08] asking for money. Now, people that
[47:09] always ask for money, that's that's a
[47:10] problem. There's my 45
[47:14] minutes. But see, then you when you come
[47:16] rich, then you got problems like that.
[47:17] Everybody wants your money all the time.
[47:19] And then you got to invest it. Let's And
[47:21] how many people have been rich and they
[47:23] they they were told to invest it and
[47:24] they got scammed by the investor? Lots
[47:26] of
[47:28] people. And this writer Asf says, "So
[47:31] foolish was I to think money solves all
[47:33] our problems." Uh, being famous and
[47:36] popular solves all our problems. No, it
[47:38] creates more
[47:41] problems. Look at verse 24. Thou shalt
[47:43] guide me with thy counsel and afterward
[47:45] receive me to glory. I'm going to
[47:48] heaven. Hallelujah. That's where I'm
[47:51] going. Praise
[47:52] God. That's right. Whom have I in heaven
[47:56] but thee? Oh my. There's none beside
[47:57] thee on earth that I desire beside thee.
[48:00] Oh, and people desire to be famous. They
[48:02] desire that celebrity or that that that
[48:04] that accomplishment or that position.
[48:06] They desire these things. But Asap said,
[48:09] "The only thing I desire is Jesus."
[48:11] Hallelujah. In other words, the Christ,
[48:13] the
[48:14] anointing. That's right. Whom have I on
[48:17] earth beside thee? Whom in heaven but
[48:19] thee? We sing that song, pass me not, oh
[48:20] gentle savior. See where she got that
[48:22] from? My flesh and my heart faileth. All
[48:25] the the flesh and hearts of these famous
[48:27] people are going to fail. They all die.
[48:29] But God is the strength of my heart and
[48:31] my portion forever.
[48:33] Hallelujah. For lo, they that are far
[48:37] from thee shall perish. Thou hast
[48:39] destroyed all them that go a whoring
[48:41] from thee. But it is good for me to draw
[48:44] near to God. I have put my trust in the
[48:46] Lord and I that I may declare all thy
[48:49] works. In other words, all these rich
[48:51] people, listen, all these rich people
[48:53] are spiritual They go make love
[48:56] to the devil and the demons rather than
[48:58] giving their love to Jesus Christ.
[49:01] So what do you want to be? You want to
[49:02] be faithful to Jesus or do you want to
[49:03] be a I don't want to be a
[49:05] I want to be faithful to the Lord Jesus
[49:06] Christ. I know that's flat and plain,
[49:08] but look, that's the Bible truth. That's
[49:10] thus sayith the Lord. And then if we
[49:11] love Jesus and we're true to Jesus, then
[49:13] we have the peace of God that passes all
[49:15] understanding. Praise
[49:17] God. That's
[49:19] right. Hallelujah.
[49:22] So, like as I said, just because people
[49:23] leave our church or people leave the
[49:25] message or people even leave
[49:26] Christianity and it seems like
[49:28] everything's going well, it's
[49:29] impossible. They can't they can't have
[49:31] things go well. If they're living in
[49:33] disobedience, it cannot be well with
[49:35] them because they've disobeyed the word
[49:36] of
[49:37] God. Hallelujah. And they might prosper
[49:40] for a season. That's like the rich young
[49:42] ruler. He prospered for a long time, but
[49:44] then he unexpectedly lost his life. And
[49:46] then the Bible said he went down to
[49:48] hell. Now, let me bounce. I'll close
[49:51] with this
[49:53] bounce. Communion doesn't save
[49:56] you. But if you don't take it the right
[49:59] way, it will cause a curse on your
[50:03] life. Right? We just saw the curse. Many
[50:05] are weak and sickly, and many die
[50:08] because they don't judge the body of the
[50:10] Lord. They don't judge the church the
[50:12] right way. Okay? Now, I'm not going to
[50:14] go through that today. I did that back
[50:15] in that previous
[50:17] u previous series. So many are weak and
[50:20] sickly among you and many sleep. Brother
[50:22] Ram says, "What are you? You're a
[50:24] Christian. You live before everybody's a
[50:26] Christian." And if you take that
[50:27] communion and don't live as a Christian,
[50:28] you're not discerning the Lord's body.
[50:30] You're putting a stumbling block in
[50:32] somebody else's way. See, as they see
[50:34] you trying to do that and then not
[50:37] living what you're supposed to live.
[50:38] See, you're not discerning the Lord's
[50:39] body. Now, watch it. What the curse of
[50:41] it is.
[50:43] See, a lot of people forget Christians
[50:45] can be cursed in their spirits or bodies
[50:48] temporarily, right? Because it's a
[50:51] curse. God put a curse upon these people
[50:54] in the church of Corenth because they
[50:55] weren't judging the body the right way.
[50:57] They weren't treating the people the
[50:59] right way. So, God put a curse on their
[51:00] life. For this cause, many are weak and
[51:03] sickly among you and many are asleep.
[51:05] The right translation, Brother Perry, is
[51:07] dead. See, many are dead. Then he reads
[51:10] the rest of the scripture.
[51:12] I'll close with this. What do I got? Oh,
[51:15] I thought I would finish the
[51:18] chapter. Now, brother man's finishing
[51:20] up. Here's memory. Look, he's in Tucson.
[51:22] It's his last recorded words on
[51:25] tape. Now, in other words, don't just
[51:27] come as I said a while ago about the
[51:29] Jews. It was wonderful. It was given by
[51:31] God, but it got to place. They didn't do
[51:33] it in sincerity and reverence and in
[51:35] order. Then it just become a stench in
[51:37] his
[51:39] nose. Hallelujah.
[51:42] See church, we don't want to go through
[51:44] the
[51:46] motions. You just don't want to go
[51:48] through the motions. You got to get down
[51:50] in your heart and repent of any actual
[51:52] sin you know to make it fresh again. So
[51:55] the love of God is present in your
[51:58] worship.
[52:00] Hallelujah. Because if not, if you don't
[52:02] get your constant sincerity and
[52:05] reverence back, then it just becomes
[52:06] vain worship. It doesn't mean anything.
[52:09] Hallelujah.
[52:11] Then he says, "Since it got like that
[52:13] for Israel, it's the same thing by our
[52:16] coming to take the Lord's supper that we
[52:19] must come knowing what we are doing."
[52:21] Just like when you go to the water to be
[52:22] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[52:24] you know what you're doing. You're
[52:25] putting onto the church what God has put
[52:27] in you. Christ, you're showing Christ to
[52:30] the church because Christ is inside of
[52:33] me. When we take this, it shows to the
[52:35] church, I believe every word of God. So
[52:38] when we took communion, that's what it
[52:40] means. I believe every word of God.
[52:43] Hallelujah. I believe Jesus is the bread
[52:46] of life that come down from God out of
[52:48] heaven. I believe every word that he
[52:51] says is the truth. And church, I live it
[52:54] by the best of my knowledge. God is my
[52:58] judge. Therefore, being my brothers be
[53:01] before my sisters, before my brothers, I
[53:03] do not swear. I do not curse. I do not
[53:05] do these things because I love the Lord
[53:07] and the Lord knows it and bears me
[53:09] record. That's what I want. That's what
[53:12] you want. We want the Lord. We want to
[53:13] see the Lord bear record that re we're a
[53:16] real Christian.
[53:18] Praise
[53:19] God. Doesn't that make you feel good
[53:21] when someone says, "Oh, isn't isn't it
[53:23] good when you hear somebody tell you
[53:25] about something somebody else said about
[53:27] you that was good?"
[53:30] Isn't that great? When somebody tells
[53:33] you something that they heard about you
[53:34] and it was good, that means you're
[53:37] living the right Christian life.
[53:39] Hallelujah. God bear record. God bears
[53:42] record that you're living the Christian
[53:43] life. And everybody sees it and it gets
[53:46] back around you. That shows you're
[53:49] worshiping in sincerity and reverence
[53:51] before God. You believe every word of
[53:54] God to the best of my knowledge.
[53:57] Remember brother Brian praise she's done
[53:59] what she could. All that means I just
[54:02] did my best.
[54:05] Hallelujah. Let's do our best by the
[54:07] grace of
[54:08] God. I don't swear. I don't do these
[54:11] things because I love the Lord and the
[54:12] Lord knows it bears me record. Therefore
[54:15] before you I take this parcel of his
[54:16] body, the bread to know that I'm not
[54:18] condemned with the world. See there you
[54:19] are. Then it's a blessing. Praise
[54:23] God. Now let me finish this chapter. I'm
[54:26] just going to finish it because I only
[54:26] got a few more verses. And then I was
[54:28] talking with brother uh uh Patrick.
[54:31] We'll go over this on Sunday. Well, no,
[54:33] it's going to be a while now. Maybe next
[54:35] Wednesday. There's four at least four
[54:37] shadows, four foreshadows of communion
[54:39] in the Old Testament, but let me just
[54:40] finish with a chapter here. For if we
[54:42] would judge ourselves, we not be judged.
[54:44] But when we are judged, we are chasing
[54:46] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[54:47] with the world. Anybody just catch that?
[54:48] Judge ourselves. Spirit of
[54:51] judgment, right? Spirit of judgment and
[54:53] spirit of burning.
[54:55] That's what we need. Judge ourselves.
[54:57] Just be honest. Have I lost my
[55:00] sincerity? Have I let down somewhere and
[55:03] I'm not doing my best? All God wants is
[55:05] just your best.
[55:07] Are you doing your best? Am I doing my
[55:10] best? We want to give God our best
[55:11] tonight.
[55:14] See, just give him I got to give I just
[55:16] gave him my best song leading that I can
[55:18] do. And tonight it wasn't very good, but
[55:19] I know God's merciful. Praise God. I
[55:22] still got to give my best sermon that I
[55:24] can preach. Try to preach the truth so
[55:26] the saints will say, "Amen." And
[55:28] somebody will leave here closer to God
[55:30] than further away. Praise God.
[55:33] Whether people repent or not, whether a
[55:35] miracle happens or not, I got to give
[55:36] God my best. Hallelujah.
[55:40] Or else I get
[55:42] insincere and God doesn't receive my
[55:44] sacrifice anymore. And then a temporary
[55:46] curse could come upon me or come upon
[55:48] somebody else.
[55:51] When we are judged by the spirit of
[55:53] judgment, we are chasened to the Lord
[55:55] that we should not be condemned with the
[55:58] world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[56:00] come together to eat, tarry one for
[56:03] another, wait for one another, and if
[56:05] any man hunger, let him eat at home,
[56:07] that you come not together unto
[56:09] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[56:11] order when I come. Let's stand into our
[56:13] feet.
[56:17] So we see again here that when it comes
[56:19] to communion, they were not treating
[56:21] each other the right way in regards to
[56:24] communion. Can you believe
[56:27] that? Those rich people would uh they
[56:30] would come to the communion service,
[56:31] they would get drunk, eat all this food,
[56:33] and they'd see poor Christians and not
[56:35] even offer them any
[56:37] food. Now, my brothers are witnesses. If
[56:40] you don't have lunch, what's going to
[56:41] happen at our church? What's going to
[56:42] happen? If you don't have lunch, what's
[56:44] somebody going to do at our
[56:46] church? Yeah. And the church said,
[56:49] "Amen. If you don't have lunch here,
[56:51] someone's going to offer to you. And if
[56:53] not, you come tell me, I'll offer lunch
[56:54] to
[56:55] them." Hallelujah. But they would just
[56:58] walk in. All the rich people, they just,
[57:00] oh, just eating away, oh, drinking away,
[57:02] getting drunk, and they let these poor
[57:04] people go by, not even offer them
[57:06] food.
[57:08] Hallelujah. Is that right?
[57:11] And my brothers are witnesses. You
[57:12] brothers are witnesses. If somebody
[57:15] comes here knowing have food, you better
[57:16] offer to get them
[57:18] something. Do
[57:20] something. How can you have faith and
[57:22] see somebody hungry and not try to feed
[57:24] them? Now, if they're fasting, they'll
[57:26] let you know they're fasting. Then you
[57:28] don't got to get them
[57:29] food. And the church
[57:32] said, "If you see somebody that needs to
[57:35] give them that's hungry, give them food
[57:36] by the grace of God." Isn't that what
[57:39] real faith is? When was the last time we
[57:41] read James chap let's read James chapter
[57:42] 2 real quick here. I'm going to go do
[57:44] some
[57:44] overtime. I just feel
[57:48] led. And it's also to show our brethren
[57:50] that that's that's real faith. That's
[57:53] what you do if someone doesn't have
[57:56] food. See somebody cold, get them a
[58:00] coat. That's real
[58:04] faith. That's real Christianity.
[58:09] I love what James
[58:22] says. Verse 14, James 2:14. What does it
[58:26] profit my brethren? Though a man say he
[58:27] has faith and has not works, can faith
[58:29] save
[58:31] him? In other words, that's uh faith
[58:34] without faith without works. faith.
[58:36] That's just insincere
[58:39] faith. If a brother or sister be naked
[58:41] and destitute of food, and one of you
[58:43] say unto them, "Depart in peace. Be warm
[58:45] to be filled. Notwithstanding you give
[58:47] not them those things which are needful
[58:49] to the body." What does it profit? Even
[58:51] so, faith, if it hath not works, is dead
[58:54] being alone. Isn't that something? You
[58:56] can say all the nice words. Oh, God
[58:58] bless you. May God give you some food.
[59:00] May God warm you up. May God get you
[59:01] some nice shoes. I just trust may God
[59:03] give you a good coat someday. see
[59:06] you. You're you're you're dead. You're
[59:09] spiritually
[59:10] dead. You don't have any real
[59:13] faith.
[59:15] Hallelujah. And those Corinthians would
[59:17] sit there feasting right before
[59:18] communion. Man, this is some good meat
[59:21] right here. This is some good beef right
[59:23] here. Or some good lamb right here. Oh,
[59:25] now you know lamb is good. If you
[59:28] haven't had lamb lately, you're missing
[59:30] out. That's like fingerlicking good.
[59:34] But these rich people would well they'd
[59:36] have all their their fellowship and wa
[59:38] watch these poor people walk
[59:41] by. And Paul's got to rebuke him and
[59:43] said, "Hey, you're going to get sick and
[59:44] die. Awful things are going to happen to
[59:46] you if you don't clean up your life.
[59:48] Start looking at other people. Stop
[59:49] looking at yourself so
[59:52] much. Can't say you have faith and not
[59:55] look at other people's needs." Now, most
[59:57] of us got what we have need of here. But
[1:00:00] let this be a reminder that there might
[1:00:01] come a time where people do need things
[1:00:04] here and we need to step up and help.
[1:00:07] Praise God. Like you probably heard me
[1:00:09] say it before. If somebody asked you for
[1:00:11] $1,000, well, you don't got it. But can
[1:00:12] you give them
[1:00:15] five? Who here? No, don't. I'm not going
[1:00:17] to ask you. Raise your hand. I was going
[1:00:18] to say, who here has
[1:00:19] $5? Most people got five bucks. You
[1:00:22] could Yeah. So, in other words, let's
[1:00:24] soften our hearts to the Holy Spirit
[1:00:27] when we see people in need.
[1:00:30] See, we don't have faith. If we just
[1:00:31] say, "Oh, bless you. Bless you. Bless
[1:00:32] you." And don't do anything about it, it
[1:00:34] shows our faith isn't really
[1:00:37] strong. See, even so faith, verse 17, if
[1:00:40] it has not works, is dead being alone.
[1:00:42] Yay. A man may say, "Thou has faith and
[1:00:43] I have works. Show me thy faith without
[1:00:45] thy works, and I'll show thee my faith
[1:00:47] by my works. Thou believest that there's
[1:00:49] one God. Thou doest well." The de devils
[1:00:51] also believe and tremble. Well, I
[1:00:53] believe God sent a prophet. So does the
[1:00:55] devil, right? I believe God's one
[1:00:58] person. So does the devil.
[1:01:01] Hallelujah. See, people can say all
[1:01:03] these nice things, but your actions
[1:01:06] speak so much louder than your
[1:01:10] words.
[1:01:15] Hallelujah. But what will thou, oh vain
[1:01:18] man, that faith without works is dead?
[1:01:22] Hallelujah. Musicians can come. How many
[1:01:24] enjoyed the word tonight? Praise God.
[1:01:27] I'm happy tonight. I'm happy. God has
[1:01:29] been good to us. Praise
[1:01:31] God. So, we finished the chapter. I may
[1:01:34] go back, like I said, I may preach those
[1:01:35] foreshadow four foreshadowings of
[1:01:41] communion. Now, church, before we pray,
[1:01:44] let's examine our hearts. We're going to
[1:01:45] examine ourselves because you know what?
[1:01:47] Tonight's communion, too. But it's a
[1:01:49] spiritual communion.
[1:01:51] So in your heart, you should think in my
[1:01:53] heart, I'm going to walk up here
[1:01:54] spiritually, and I'm going to remember
[1:01:56] the I'm going to remember Jesus today.
[1:01:59] I'm going to remember that he died for
[1:02:00] my sins. He shed his blood to forgive
[1:02:02] me. And I'm going to talk it over with
[1:02:05] him. And I want to be right with the
[1:02:07] Lord. How many want to be right with the
[1:02:08] Lord tonight? Praise God. It's every
[1:02:11] time. It's it's every service type of
[1:02:13] thing.
[1:02:14] Every service is our chance to talk with
[1:02:16] the Lord. Get our sincerity back and
[1:02:19] remember the people that are hurting.
[1:02:21] Put our faith into action. Praise God.
[1:02:24] Now, with our heads
[1:02:26] bowed, let's ask ourselves, are we doing
[1:02:28] our best even for
[1:02:31] church? Are we giving God our best for
[1:02:34] church? That's the first
[1:02:37] thing. And church, only you can answer
[1:02:40] that. Uh, play that pass me not a gentle
[1:02:43] That was in our chapter Psalm 73. Whom
[1:02:47] have I on earth? Heaven
[1:02:49] whom have I in heaven but
[1:02:53] thee? Are we giving God our
[1:03:00] best? We want our worship to be sincere.
[1:03:03] We want to get something out of We want
[1:03:04] to be reverent before
[1:03:09] God. Examine your heart now. Am I giving
[1:03:12] God my best?
