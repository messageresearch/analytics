[0:00] so we had I think we had really good
[0:03] success by the grace of God thank you
[0:05] for your prayers your sacrifice or
[0:07] donations and everything worked out by
[0:10] the grace of God I went we went there
[0:12] were able to pretty much cover them in
[0:14] the majority of all the expenses for
[0:17] brother Ron for our interpreter he
[0:20] stayed in tyre two weeks with us so he
[0:23] sacrificed quite a bit we were able to
[0:25] give him a nice little
[0:26] [Music]
[0:28] donation I know Emma and Lydia had
[0:32] specifically set aside money and we took
[0:34] that there and we were able to don't we
[0:37] stayed with a man who runs an orphanage
[0:40] he's got 35 children under his reign
[0:43] there he's a pastor he deals with the
[0:46] akka tribe and he has put up three or
[0:50] four churches for the tribes of akka and
[0:53] their beautiful buildings and he's
[0:55] pretty much a one-man machine here in
[0:57] fact there's only one person who might
[0:58] be it was Bo Jesse the amount of things
[1:01] that he can do is just I'm in awe of
[1:04] what he done he did he built these
[1:06] churches he built the cross 1/4 of
[1:08] churches and
[1:10] everywhere we saw a white cross where
[1:12] there was red neon around it that was
[1:14] him and I saw him probably 10m just even
[1:18] just driving through town there's I said
[1:19] this probably was
[1:20] and he would donate he'd made these in
[1:23] donating to the churches and he put them
[1:24] all the Tricia's that akka tried
[1:26] but we got to share the word quite a bit
[1:30] and and i was thinking i was talking to
[1:33] my wife on the way here and i think man
[1:36] i wonder why God would send me here and
[1:39] and the only reason these people would
[1:42] even listen to me and accept
[1:44] what we're bringing forth is because we
[1:47] brought it straight from the Bible I
[1:49] didn't need any quotes I
[1:52] took them verse by verse by verse by
[1:56] verse and
[1:58] showed them out of their own Bible even
[2:01] though their translations off show them
[2:03] by their own Bible what the truth is and
[2:05] time and time again the pastor the
[2:08] interpreter says we can ask anything
[2:09] about against it because it's
[2:11] so the word is right we have to know our
[2:16] swords we have to keep our swords sharp
[2:18] we have to know the revelation behind
[2:20] them we have many invites for the round
[2:22] the end day I don't know if you remember
[2:23] my very first trip I come back and do
[2:26] the presentation right here or they were
[2:29] there I came here where was the end
[2:31] there was
[2:32] three generations a grandmother a mother
[2:35] and then a granddaughter and
[2:38] brother Ron was able to contact the
[2:41] granddaughter the young one she's
[2:42] married now and
[2:44] brother Ron wouldn't did a Bible stay
[2:46] with him and they fully see the entire
[2:48] message now they believe the Prophet
[2:50] they believe the church ages believe the
[2:52] messenger
[2:54] original sin all that so now they are
[2:56] hungry more for the word and keep it
[2:59] around in prayer he is moving to Kuwait
[3:01] to get closer to Thailand he is
[3:04] uprooting everything sold his cars house
[3:08] and he is moving to Kuwait to where
[3:11] you're not allowed to witness over there
[3:13] this Muslim so all chased they reckon
[3:17] they said brother all you can do is live
[3:18] a life answer only what is asked if
[3:21] someone asks you something than answer
[3:23] but they don't say
[3:24] because they don't play over there in
[3:27] dangerous territory so
[3:30] so I don't know when we'll be back we'll
[3:33] probably be soon and
[3:36] the Lord delivered my job back on the
[3:40] way and I
[3:42] was driving back from the airport I
[3:45] called my boss and said I said you want
[3:47] me to come back he said no there's no
[3:49] work for you you're done it with a howl
[3:51] of Allah and then an eagle swooped down
[3:52] by the car and I was like
[3:55] and then he goes hold on one minute well
[3:58] give me a day to think on it I said
[4:01] thank you Father
[4:03] Jehovah eagle is in control and so I had
[4:07] I had to take a day off there and
[4:09] waited and then the secretary called
[4:12] said oh we need you Friday and then the
[4:14] next day I kept waiting and then he's
[4:16] called in the next things that all right
[4:17] we need you Thursday so I didn't my last
[4:19] two days of work here so God is faithful
[4:21] he preserves everything I was fully
[4:24] ready to go sign the list but the Lord
[4:26] said no stay right here a little longer
[4:27] so I
[4:29] don't value a job any more or more than
[4:32] the gospel in fact this trip I did not
[4:34] want to go on because only three weeks
[4:37] notice and
[4:38] I told them original I said no rawness
[4:41] like thank you
[4:43] but I felt checked that's my desire
[4:46] that's my will I went in the prayer
[4:48] closet and I said Lord if you want me to
[4:51] go within two days I said this in my
[4:53] heart let something happen and on the
[4:56] flat Friday the second day it happened
[4:58] so but it seemed to happen I know I
[5:00] could go back on my word
[5:02] and went bought the ticket the next day
[5:04] and we're off so
[5:06] anyhow I want to keep you standing let's
[5:08] turn to
[5:10] like I said here I was not planning on
[5:16] on teaching tonight but God must have
[5:20] had his will I didn't have
[5:22] time to get around to sermon unfresh
[5:25] something fresh
[5:26] recently but off to give you something
[5:28] about a month and a half old but it's
[5:30] still good to me
[5:32] this is actually like a culmination of a
[5:35] couple years in the making this study
[5:37] and it's beautiful to see that God would
[5:40] continue to unfold his word and to place
[5:44] it I'm to the point
[5:49] I'm actually to the point Saints to
[5:52] where I love looking at one Scripture
[5:55] and I like looking at I like it dissect
[5:57] it but for me I'm to the point now where
[6:00] I'm I want to step back I'm gonna step
[6:03] back and I want to see the whole picture
[6:08] because as I taught in Thailand this is
[6:10] a mystery book Saints this is a mystery
[6:12] book and it's a puzzle book but if
[6:15] puzzle book the puzzle needs to be put
[6:17] together and we want to be able to place
[6:20] peace as a God gives you a piece here
[6:22] and a piece here you want to put
[6:23] together and a piece here and put
[6:25] together and then as you slowly adds
[6:27] revelational pieces together then we can
[6:30] have a greater understanding and see a
[6:34] greater meaning behind it a more clear
[6:39] nice precise vision of what was laid
[6:43] before what was given to us this was
[6:46] given to us so
[6:48] we want to teach by the grace of God
[6:51] let's turn to Luke 14 I
[6:57] don't want to have any pride or anything
[7:01] but seeing Malachi and Lydia up here I
[7:04] just I just think the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:07] for their gifts being manifested and
[7:09] their willingness their
[7:11] yielded vessels so it's exciting for an
[7:15] uncle to see those things they
[7:17] can't imagine how their mom and dad
[7:19] would feel it
[7:21] alright let's see if we can do here Oh
[7:23] Lorna
[7:30] let's see if we can get this to go there
[7:33] we go Luke 14 verse 16 we're gonna read
[7:37] two passages of Scripture we'll say a
[7:39] word of Prayer and then you can have
[7:41] receipts and we want to teach this
[7:42] hopefully this will be a blessing Saints
[7:44] uh
[7:45] you know you always want to know where
[7:47] we are in the Bible we want to know
[7:48] where we are in the scripture we want to
[7:51] know in the in the the time God's time
[7:54] clock where we at we're exactly
[7:56] precisely are where what are we dealing
[7:59] with here so and I and this one helped
[8:02] me out quite a bit here in Luke 6 14
[8:05] verse 16 then he said unto them a
[8:08] certain man made a great supper and made
[8:11] many and sent his servant at supper time
[8:14] what is this this is the wedding supper
[8:16] right this is the marriage supper of the
[8:18] Lamb
[8:20] God Jesus Christ had died resurrected he
[8:24] wave goodbye to his a early bride he
[8:27] said I'm going to prepare a place for
[8:28] you he prepared to place and now he's
[8:31] got the wedding table all set the food
[8:34] setting there and he's coming at his
[8:36] bride
[8:37] he says come for all things already in
[8:42] verse 18 and they all with one consent
[8:45] look there in 1 cor
[8:48] hmm began to make excuse the first
[8:51] symptom I have bought a piece some
[8:53] ground and I have needs go and see it I
[8:56] pray that you have me excused
[8:59] and another said I have brought I'm
[9:01] bought five yoke of oxen and go to prove
[9:04] them I pray they had me excused another
[9:06] said I married a wife and therefore I
[9:08] cannot come
[9:11] right
[9:13] let's jump now
[9:16] to
[9:17] [Music]
[9:19] Luke 17
[9:23] if you think on this portion of
[9:25] Scripture they came they made excuses
[9:28] now remember God is coming to his people
[9:31] right these had to have been Christian
[9:33] people he's not going to to a motorcycle
[9:37] gang or or he's not going to the clubs
[9:40] looking business but he's actually
[9:42] coming to these people and he's saying
[9:44] I'm ready for you will you come and they
[9:46] said no so the thought is who are they
[9:49] listening to why were I was like this
[9:52] why were their hearts and ease
[9:55] what was the read what caused them to
[9:58] become like this and at the end of the
[10:01] study you'll see why they were like this
[10:05] Luke 17 verse
[10:09] 26 just a couple pages further here
[10:17] but Luke 17 verse
[10:22] 26 now notice we read this something
[10:25] everybody's heard this a million times
[10:26] and as it was in the days of noe so
[10:29] shall it be also in the days of the Son
[10:31] of Man they did eat they drank they
[10:34] married wives they were given in
[10:36] marriage until the day that noe entered
[10:38] into the ark and the flood came and
[10:40] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[10:43] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[10:46] drank they bought they sold they planted
[10:48] they builded
[10:50] the same day that lot went enough went
[10:54] out of Sodom they rained fire and
[10:55] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[10:57] all let's say a word of Prayer
[11:01] dearly father Lord Jesus will we just
[11:04] Love You Lord we come hopping Oh Lord
[11:06] Lord you know this was not my plan Lord
[11:09] to be standing behind us a little pulpit
[11:13] here God and Lord Jesus Lord my lord it
[11:15] was in your mind it was in her your way
[11:17] O Lord for even for me to teach this
[11:18] study I was not going to teach this for
[11:20] this weekend Lord but Lord you you pre
[11:23] you arranged this in such a way in order
[11:25] we want to bring it Lord as humbly and
[11:27] reverently Lord and with love Lord where
[11:29] we just pray bless the people Lord hear
[11:31] this word our Lord blessed and keep them
[11:33] God Lord just keep us right straight in
[11:35] the narrow Lord in the name of Jesus
[11:37] Christ amen you may have your seats
[11:43] if you notice in both these passages in
[11:47] Luke 14
[11:50] Luke 17 they are they're busy in life
[11:55] they're accomplishing things in the
[11:58] natural the material realm is going very
[12:00] well for them they're doing pretty good
[12:03] you know it's a time of prosperity where
[12:06] they could actually buy these things
[12:07] they could they could go in and
[12:11] whatever their harps desire was they
[12:14] could go and accomplish it the
[12:17] opportunities were there there was
[12:18] nothing to hinder but all things were
[12:21] available sounds like the American Dream
[12:23] I wonder but but at this time of
[12:26] prosperity at the time where you could I
[12:28] just love to see these two
[12:29] brother-in-law sitting next to each
[12:31] other
[12:33] male faithful warriors and
[12:35] go see our brother back and
[12:39] all the saints of God's thing valiantly
[12:42] and on a Friday night you guys are here
[12:44] you guys can do anything you wanted
[12:47] aside to go out and take a nice cold
[12:49] walk but if you could be on your couch
[12:52] leveled up listening to a sermon or at
[12:54] listening tape or making something but
[12:56] you chose to be at the house of God that
[12:58] is a shows tremendous character so god
[13:02] bless your hearts so here at this time
[13:05] and let me give you a little a story
[13:10] here on why
[13:11] about six months ago we had a brother
[13:14] come and preach and he he pulled me
[13:17] aside and we were talking and he said
[13:19] brother and he said a certain something
[13:20] to me he said something I'll show I'll
[13:22] shared leader here he said something to
[13:24] me and I said why did he say that
[13:27] because you know the Bible says you know
[13:29] we got to try every spirit what was the
[13:32] reason for stating this to me he spoke
[13:34] this to me and for some reason this
[13:36] struck me odd you know there's a lot of
[13:38] times how many conversations do we go
[13:40] through day in and day out that never
[13:42] never retained with you that nothing
[13:45] nothing of oh this person said this but
[13:47] nothing's fixed you know you forget
[13:48] about it this that but there's some
[13:50] times when people say things to you and
[13:52] man that sticks to right in your heart
[13:54] and they'll be like hmm well I took that
[13:56] statement I put it on a shelf okay I
[13:59] took that statement and I put it right
[14:02] there and I just waited I waited on God
[14:06] so tonight I'd like to teach on in the
[14:10] days of the open book all right I hope
[14:14] this doesn't seem Antichrist but we want
[14:16] to you'll see by the Word of God we will
[14:19] dial this I want you to see the bigger
[14:21] picture of this okay I want you to see
[14:23] what we're trying to convey by the grace
[14:26] of God now here in Revelations 5 verse 1
[14:28] we see it interesting we know this that
[14:31] the Prophet said this is the most
[14:32] sublime portion of scripture here in
[14:35] Revelation 5 verse 1 and I saw in the
[14:37] right hand of him that sat on a throne a
[14:40] book written within and on the backside
[14:42] sealed with seven seals right here is
[14:45] the father on the throne he has the book
[14:48] of Redemption his hand into this sealed
[14:50] up and
[14:54] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[14:57] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[14:59] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[15:01] no man in heaven nor on earth nor
[15:03] neither under the earth was able to open
[15:06] the book neither to look thereon this is
[15:08] a very important book no Pope as the
[15:11] Prophet said was able to open it and
[15:13] I'll say today no message Pope is able
[15:16] to know it was able to open his book
[15:17] there was no one in heaven in heaven or
[15:20] on earth that was able to even not a
[15:23] born on this book right and when John
[15:26] said this he says and I wept the
[15:28] restorer much because no man was found
[15:31] worthy to open and to read the book
[15:33] neither to look thereon and one of the
[15:35] elders said unto me weep not behold the
[15:38] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[15:40] David hath prevailed to open the book
[15:42] and to loose the seven seals thereof and
[15:45] praise be to God right our Lord and
[15:48] Savior came down in his first coming he
[15:51] lived the perfect life he became the
[15:53] perfect sacrifice Saints a God in three
[15:55] she healed he did everything that could
[15:58] be done in fact everything that needed
[16:00] to be done was done right then they know
[16:02] if you mean healing tonight it was
[16:04] already done back land if you needed
[16:06] Liberty the provision anything you need
[16:08] was done 2,000 years ago amen and that's
[16:13] exactly right
[16:14] but when he came and did these sort of
[16:16] things what he did all those redemptive
[16:19] blessing those seven compound redemptive
[16:21] blessings there was I believe in Isaiah
[16:22] 53 or somewhere around there he did
[16:25] those two thousand years ago he was led
[16:29] by the Holy Ghost onto that cross that
[16:31] Roman curse I think that that Roman
[16:34] cross they cruised to find him and he
[16:36] died oh my goodness for our sins his
[16:39] blood it was shed for us he did
[16:41] something at you or I could never do
[16:43] they men
[16:46] and did he stand there no he rose again
[16:49] and proved that he was God he
[16:52] proved who he was and he not only proved
[16:57] it but he did it for our sakes
[17:00] so every service was for our Saints that
[17:05] what he did back there was just as
[17:06] important right now these little
[17:09] services here but that is for you
[17:13] but we find that same God our Lord and
[17:16] Savior Jesus Christ now he come and took
[17:19] this book and we know he broke the seven
[17:21] seals correct
[17:26] and then here in Revelations 10:1 now
[17:29] look at this let's get the let's get the
[17:32] timetables rolling here I did bring a
[17:34] piece of paper here this is kind of
[17:36] interesting I just want to throw these
[17:38] out here notice here and I saw another
[17:41] mighty angel dah 11 flows with the cloud
[17:43] right we know that was that cloud in
[17:47] 1963 correct this is the proper said
[17:51] that on February the 17th Noah went on
[17:55] the ark
[17:56] February 17th no one in the ark
[17:59] 1951 February the 8th William Upshaw was
[18:03] instantly healed in February February
[18:06] 1961 jr. Jackson has that dream of the
[18:09] pyramid
[18:11] February 11th 1961 Danny heavy Denny
[18:15] Henry or oh yeah Henry had that prophecy
[18:18] that ran that
[18:20] translation of that
[18:22] prophecy for Bella Branham now has
[18:25] chosen the correct way that was in
[18:26] February and then here in February 28th
[18:29] of 1963 we see this cloud come down
[18:32] notice the timing okay because remember
[18:34] oh I want to get a timetable here I want
[18:37] to places where we had in the scripture
[18:39] right now why were those people who had
[18:42] a wife or was building a house and this
[18:44] is the oxen what was what happened to
[18:46] them because that's in the timetables
[18:49] that's someone for our day that's for
[18:51] our day that was the marriage supper
[18:52] that's for our day that takes place at
[18:56] the end of Laodicea
[18:57] that is a pre rapture right there
[19:01] so we want to place these things and a
[19:04] rainbow was set upon his head in his
[19:06] face was where the Sun and his feet is
[19:08] filled of fire and he had in his right
[19:10] hand a little open book now he had come
[19:14] down the cloud was formed in 63 the
[19:18] open book and the what he preached the
[19:21] seals just a month later in March
[19:24] correct
[19:27] the seven thunders Robert but now look
[19:30] with this in verse revelations 10 six
[19:35] and I swear by him that liveth for ever
[19:38] and ever who created heaven and the
[19:40] things that are that re that there that
[19:42] there are then that therein are and the
[19:46] earth and the things that therein are
[19:47] and the sea and the things that are that
[19:50] are there in that time should be no
[19:52] longer
[19:55] when that happened in 62 63
[20:02] at that time time is at the end it is
[20:08] the end brother for 50-plus years we're
[20:12] 55 plus years down the road I'm telling
[20:15] you we're at the end
[20:19] okay I can't emphasize that enough we
[20:22] are at the end it is over
[20:27] now look at this next one
[20:31] we know these things right revelation 10
[20:33] 7 in the days of the voice of the
[20:35] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[20:37] sound the mystery of God to be finished
[20:38] as he had declared his servants the
[20:40] prophets right we know this and the
[20:43] voice which I heard from heavens bacon
[20:45] to me he said go and take the little
[20:47] book
[20:49] go and take the little book
[20:52] which is open in the hand of the angel
[20:55] which standeth upon the seed upon the
[20:57] earth I went unto the angel he said to
[20:59] me give me the little book and he's
[21:00] telling me take it and eat it up and it
[21:02] shall make thy belly bitter he shall be
[21:04] in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took
[21:07] the little book out of the Angels hand
[21:08] and I ate it up and it was in my mouth
[21:10] sweet as honey and as soon as I had
[21:12] eaten it it was in my belly my belly was
[21:15] bitter right and he said thou and he
[21:18] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[21:19] before many peoples nations tongues and
[21:23] kings correct
[21:26] this right here is the days of the open
[21:30] book
[21:31] okay the book is opened
[21:34] more and more revelation is coming out
[21:37] more and more nuggets more understanding
[21:40] more we're grasping the word we're
[21:43] seeing the sincere Word of God opening
[21:45] up continually now new thoughts are
[21:48] coming like this it's
[21:50] at a break breakneck speed it's coming
[21:54] just just off like that by just things
[21:56] at least for me it is
[21:59] as far as understanding I'll say like
[22:02] that now
[22:05] where do we go from here if we had to
[22:08] add or if we the can came from this area
[22:10] the open book has come down if we had to
[22:13] continue where are we jumped you from
[22:14] right here
[22:16] by the grace of God we will bring you
[22:20] right there at the days of the open book
[22:26] when I took I actually took a vacation
[22:28] first for in three years this year and
[22:32] but I went to Texas and I went and then
[22:35] brother Andy who was working the first
[22:36] couple days so I had some free time in
[22:38] the morning I woke up may it may imagine
[22:41] this all my vacation I woke up before
[22:43] seven before 6:30 every day with on my
[22:46] own so figure that out
[22:51] so the first day yeah I was up at yak
[22:54] crazy I was up at 6:30 and I'm like why
[22:58] the way it goes oh I'm going running so
[23:00] brother Andy lives just a couple blocks
[23:01] from a nice mile link it's a mile long
[23:04] and I ran around the mile thing twice
[23:07] and on the second mile there I started
[23:10] praising God and worshiping God and I
[23:12] looked down and on the concrete when
[23:14] they poured it someone wrote their name
[23:15] and their name was amber
[23:17] and I thought amber and I was just
[23:19] started worshiping God I said yes Lord
[23:21] you are that amber light if
[23:23] anybody that that that yellowish
[23:25] greenish that had that pie right there
[23:27] just going and you are that amber and my
[23:30] mind went right to
[23:32] Ezekiel
[23:33] and I went back and I started sitting
[23:36] down and I went back because I was up so
[23:38] early that I ran my 2.4 miles or
[23:42] whatever it was I opened my Bible I
[23:44] started reading in Ezekiel so we could
[23:47] let's go to Ezekiel here
[23:49] notice they had to eat the book correct
[23:52] notice in the days of the open book
[23:57] and
[23:58] when you eat something what should it do
[24:02] we were commissioned take the book
[24:06] but what did John say John said give it
[24:08] to me no that was not the Commission the
[24:10] Commission was to
[24:11] so John didn't even understand the way
[24:14] to get it anyhow you're supposed to take
[24:17] it and eat it and by eating it you will
[24:20] gain strength did you know they
[24:23] Ezequiel means God will strengthen
[24:28] I
[24:30] wonder if this plays into the days of
[24:32] the open book in Ezekiel 1 here and it
[24:37] came to pass that Ezekiel the heavens
[24:39] were opened I saw the visions of God and
[24:44] notice here it says God will the name is
[24:47] eco means God will strengthen right and
[24:50] in this last day we're gonna need so
[24:52] much spiritual strength for the journey
[24:57] right amen now notice here in Ezekiel 1
[25:00] and 4 and I looked and behold a
[25:02] whirlwind came out north and a great
[25:04] cloud
[25:06] the same cloud I bet all that was back
[25:10] in 1963 I wonder if that was something
[25:13] lighted but we see we heat we see here a
[25:15] cloud and a fire and pulling himself and
[25:17] the brightness was about it and I was
[25:19] amidst her up with the color of a mere
[25:20] out in the midst of the fire and this is
[25:22] this is the scripture I thought about
[25:24] when I ran past I saw the name Ambrose
[25:26] just worshiping God and boom amber I
[25:29] started reading
[25:33] and we noticed here in Ezekiel 1 as he's
[25:36] dealing with that the cloud and the
[25:38] amber light and he's seeing God that
[25:40] here comes the one he finds himself in
[25:43] the midst what of the four zooms we see
[25:46] the the man the ox the Eagle the lion
[25:49] all those he's find himself right up
[25:52] there right
[25:55] amen and this is what they you know they
[25:57] the artist conception of them is there
[26:00] one person with four hands and where
[26:03] they would never move to the right or
[26:04] left it always go forward what
[26:06] protecting God amen
[26:09] yeah a little close up there absolutely
[26:14] but notice in Ezekiel to
[26:18] notice and thou shalt speak my words
[26:21] unto them where was they will hear and
[26:23] whether they will forbear for they are
[26:25] most rebellious
[26:28] but thou son of man hear what I say into
[26:31] thee be not thou rebellious like the
[26:34] rebellious I'll open thy mouth and eat
[26:37] that I give thee
[26:39] we are coming to the days of the open
[26:42] book
[26:44] what cause what caused those at the
[26:49] marriage supper what caused those in
[26:50] Luke 17 to be out and about and doing
[26:53] everything prospering here listen as'
[26:55] and they were so relaxed in their heart
[26:59] there has to be a reason and we'll find
[27:03] it in the days of the open book
[27:06] he says he says be thou be that be not
[27:10] thou rebellious like that rebellious
[27:12] house open thy mouth and eat what I give
[27:14] thee why because God will strengthen you
[27:17] hey man if you read you word if you
[27:19] meditate on the Word of God you pray God
[27:21] will strengthen you beyond a
[27:24] certain sister was listening to a
[27:27] minister on the internet then she heard
[27:29] something wrong and she began to pray on
[27:32] it and the Holy Ghost said listen to my
[27:35] prophet only
[27:39] put them tapes on Saints because what
[27:42] the secret of the rapture is
[27:46] you want to hear things to open up you
[27:49] never heard things you listened to that
[27:50] tape a thousand times he hears something
[27:52] new every time boom this strikes this
[27:54] strikes another angle in verse 90s and
[27:56] when I look behold a hand was set unto
[27:58] me and lo a roll of a book was there on
[28:01] see here was an open book we're picking
[28:05] up from revelations 10 and he spread it
[28:08] before me and it was written within
[28:09] without notice it was not sealed yet it
[28:13] was open it was not sealed and what
[28:15] until Daniel
[28:19] so we see a time in history in
[28:22] description my book is open and
[28:26] he's allowed to read what's in it and he
[28:31] must perform certain things that are
[28:34] written within
[28:36] hey man are you with me and he spread it
[28:39] before me it was written within without
[28:41] and there was written there lamentations
[28:43] and mourning and woe right
[28:46] some hard things are written in there
[28:50] things are going to be revealed in there
[28:53] in ezekiel 3-1 morally suddenly we saw
[28:57] the man Eve without findeth
[28:59] whatever you find
[29:01] whatever God every time you jump in that
[29:04] word your pastor he must study
[29:06] constantly these pastors are amazing
[29:08] brothers a one time brother cam went on
[29:11] it went on a trip for I think it was two
[29:13] weeks and I to do for services you know
[29:15] what that's like you get done with one
[29:17] tourist you're like I got a service in
[29:19] three more days I got a prep I got a
[29:21] study back to the scriptures woohoo look
[29:23] at me and I got done with that service
[29:25] oh wait I got him study I got a sermon
[29:27] in three more days it's a never-ending
[29:30] pressure
[29:32] it's always on the calls always on the
[29:35] burners lift up your pastor strength
[29:37] your pastors they never stopped his
[29:41] motherhood hard yeah absolutely so his
[29:42] father her mother fatherhood
[29:44] [Laughter]
[29:47] oh my it says more money suddenly me
[29:51] Saturday Ethan our finest Jesus wrong go
[29:54] to the house of Israel you'll speak into
[29:56] the house of Israel so I open mouth and
[29:58] he calls me to eat that wrong he eat the
[30:01] open book and he said to me son of man
[30:04] cause thy belly to eat and fill thy
[30:07] bowels with this role that I give me
[30:08] that when I eat it then did I eat it and
[30:11] it was in my mouth as sweet as honey
[30:15] now what was this role supposed to do he
[30:19] ate the open book was delivered to the
[30:21] problem I'm God's it eat it and he ate
[30:24] it what was this supposed to produce
[30:29] in Ezekiel three four and he said to me
[30:32] son of man go and get thee to the house
[30:34] if those won't speak my words unto
[30:36] them
[30:38] whatever he finds in there notice he's
[30:42] not looking for anything specific but
[30:44] whatever he finds in there is the
[30:45] scripture says he must bring it for when
[30:49] when pastor Jesse digs in the Word of
[30:51] God whatever he finds he was bringing a
[30:53] poor boy whatever that's brother
[30:55] whatever that's brother whatever that's
[30:56] brother whatever fine you must bring it
[30:58] for whatever I buy I must bring it boil
[31:02] and it might be different for each one
[31:06] because we are different vessels this
[31:09] man is a warrior totally different than
[31:10] me this brother just brother there are
[31:13] different soldiers sisters different
[31:15] soldiers one from another
[31:17] deformations in life
[31:19] different situations battles roll it'll
[31:22] be different
[31:23] amen he says for thou are not sent to a
[31:27] people a strange speech and of a hard
[31:30] language but to the house of Israel
[31:33] to the true children of God right
[31:38] look at verse 8 behold I have made thy
[31:42] face strong against their faces and then
[31:45] for had strong against their forehead
[31:47] their foreheads and there's an adamant
[31:49] harder than flint if I made thy forehead
[31:51] fear them not neither be dismayed at
[31:54] their looks though they may be a
[31:55] rebellious house so whatever the prophet
[31:59] found in that book was going to be hard
[32:01] for other Christians to hear
[32:04] this was not going to denomination this
[32:08] was going to the house of the Living God
[32:12] hey man
[32:15] yes yes it was
[32:19] now what does this have to do with
[32:22] anything
[32:23] this is the days of the open book
[32:27] correct now in chapter 4 God commands
[32:31] Ezekiel do not shoot the zeeco to lay on
[32:33] one on a side so many days and prophesy
[32:36] remember we should prophesy again right
[32:38] but whatever we find notice in chapter 5
[32:42] it says a hints of the common
[32:44] destruction of Israelite but in our days
[32:48] it comes to a coming a rebuilding of the
[32:50] temple of Israel amen but there will be
[32:53] a destruction hit
[32:55] chapter 6 it shows judgment will be
[32:58] striking
[32:59] notice this is all in the days of the
[33:03] open book correct
[33:07] it started in
[33:08] 63-62 right around that time the open
[33:11] book came down where are we at why were
[33:14] those Laxton Lu
[33:18] notice here in Chapter 7 of Ezekiel more
[33:22] of the word of Lord can we say at last
[33:24] our son of man thus saith the Lord God
[33:26] our land of Israel and and the end is
[33:30] come upon the four corners of the land
[33:33] he says it's over
[33:36] it's over are we living like it's over
[33:41] like these are the last fleeting moments
[33:44] of history and any second la San
[33:48] Francisco go on
[33:50] let's fix of sevens vision he saw 1933
[33:54] could take place at any second
[33:57] look at lamentations they hunt our steps
[34:00] that we cannot go into our streets our
[34:02] end is near our days are fulfilled for
[34:05] end is come our persecutors are swifter
[34:08] than the Eagles of heaven they pursued
[34:11] us upon the mountains as they laid wait
[34:13] for us in the wilderness the promise
[34:15] said you wait till you see revelations
[34:17] 13 people fear
[34:20] persecution in America
[34:25] notice he deals with the four corner of
[34:27] the land it's the end if the end
[34:31] revelations tenis at the time shall be
[34:33] no more it's over
[34:36] just like here in the opening the sixth
[34:40] seal Revelation 7:1 and after these
[34:42] things I saw the four angels standing on
[34:44] the four corners of the earth holding
[34:45] the four winds the earth of the wind
[34:47] shall not blow the earth or the sea nor
[34:49] any tree destruction the for clergy
[34:51] earth a destruction now is being held
[34:56] back to his niko seven one seven three

[35:29] have pity but I work what will
[35:30] recompense thy ways upon D in thy
[35:33] abominations shall be in the myth he
[35:34] shall know that I am the Lord he says
[35:36] thus saith the Lord God and evil and
[35:39] only evil behold is come
[35:42] something is up the street here Saints

[36:36] that's something spiritual things
[36:40] amen I'm not trying to be hard I'm just
[36:43] I am lacing us I want to show you

[36:56] he see
[37:01] look at this we've had a lot of deaths
[37:03] lately but the Dames lost - we just lost
[37:07] the sister in our assembly I heard
[37:09] another brother from overseas that just
[37:11] passed look what happens here the
[37:14] righteous parathe perish with no man lay
[37:17] out of the heart and merciful men are
[37:19] taken away none considering that the
[37:20] righteous is taken away from the evil to
[37:22] come
[37:23] there are some Saints that God is taking
[37:27] away before this evil strike in the days
[37:30] of the open book
[37:34] well I thought the bride wouldn't see
[37:36] death yeah those at the time of his
[37:39] little come
[37:41] but time has went on sings the messenger
[37:45] is gone the majority of those who have
[37:46] seen the Prophet that is that they're
[37:48] all they're all there on them they're on
[37:50] the outside there they're Lully me
[37:51] they're passing away they're going to
[37:54] sleep now
[37:58] notice here at the Ezekiel 7 again verse
[38:02] 7 the morning has come unto thee
[38:04] although that dwells in the land that
[38:07] time has come the time the day of
[38:10] trouble is near and
[38:13] the problem to catch up in the church a
[38:15] new book said in the time and the
[38:16] temptation would come as follows
[38:19] the day of trouble jacob's trouble the
[38:22] day of the tribulation it's coming the
[38:25] time of the temptation to tax your souls
[38:27] we have to make choices soon but I
[38:29] believe saints of God you've already
[38:31] made your choice
[38:32] and you have the seal of the baptism of
[38:36] the Holy Ghost in your heart amen praise
[38:38] be to God when we left a nomination we
[38:41] said that's it we're never looking back
[38:42] when we sold all we had it is finished
[38:45] we have not looked back from there amen
[38:48] let me tell you something when the
[38:50] things of the world I went Italian
[38:52] didn't hear one customer for two weeks
[38:54] and I was on the phone with a man that
[38:57] works with me and in three words I heard
[39:00] certain words if 10 of them in 30
[39:03] seconds and I thought I and I was just
[39:06] going to work and I said should I just
[39:08] quit this job
[39:10] and just spurned me so bad
[39:16] but notice what does God find here
[39:19] Ezekiel 7
[39:22] verse 9 and my eye shall not he's what
[39:25] he's bringing some fury he's gonna bring
[39:28] some anger some judgment and my eye
[39:31] shall not spare neither will I have pity
[39:32] I work in pencil according to thy ways
[39:34] and 9 abomination ornamentally and you
[39:37] shall know that i am the lord the god
[39:38] that's mighty for just why is our last
[39:41] name Smith
[39:44] that means to smite and we are going to
[39:48] smite that image until it drops
[39:51] [Laughter]
[39:52] [Music]
[39:54] absolutely can't break your type
[40:00] your your name does a lot with you it
[40:03] sure does and we are going to hit the
[40:05] Antichrist here and we're going to slam
[40:08] the denomination with fear we're going
[40:10] to hit that organizational spirit until
[40:12] in his over a month until I can't smite
[40:16] no more I'm a praise God
[40:19] but look what Christ says here in verse
[40:22] 10 behold the day beholding his cousin
[40:25] pride hath button for or sorry pride has
[40:29] bunted instead of bringing forth the
[40:32] gifts of the Spirit or fighting some
[40:33] spiritual fruit on the tree but what
[40:36] they were in notice that's rod you know
[40:38] in the Ark of the Covenant imparted was
[40:39] enormous it brought forth the correct
[40:42] fruit but notice these this rod right
[40:45] here this branch is was saying what in
[40:48] God in a boy it brought forth
[40:52] crying
[40:55] what is that tie into
[40:58] one of the first scriptures God showed
[41:00] me about woe to the crown of pride to
[41:03] the drunkards of Ephraim whose glorious
[41:05] beauty as a flea is it them that are
[41:07] overcome with Revelation stimulation
[41:11] behold the LORD hath my in a strong
[41:13] which is as a tempest or hail over
[41:16] destroying storm and is a flood of
[41:18] mighty water passed down in the earth of
[41:20] the hand the crown of pride the
[41:22] drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden
[41:23] under feet it's done
[41:27] this was this study right here as a
[41:29] culmination of almost 5 years
[41:31] he's given me peace here peace here I
[41:34] don't even look for this time I said the
[41:36] Lord of Hosts be a crown for crown of
[41:39] glory for a and for a diadem of beauty
[41:42] themselves with pride and and there are
[41:45] Sun that will be crowned by the Holy
[41:47] Ghost amen what power demonstration of
[41:51] it what is resurrection a man here will
[41:54] display it and notice and for a spear a
[41:58] judgment to him that should have been
[41:59] judgment and for a strength to them that
[42:01] turned the battle to the gate amen but
[42:03] they but they have also aired through
[42:05] wider through strong drink or on the way
[42:06] the in the priest and a prophet of air
[42:09] through strong Greek they are swallowed
[42:11] up a wine they are out of the way
[42:13] through strong drink the air and vision
[42:15] they stumble in judgment for all tables
[42:17] are full of vomit vomit and filthiness
[42:20] and so there is no place
[42:24] sticking with the Word of God
[42:28] let me tell you something what the
[42:30] scriptures say why was that why did the
[42:32] man have come down from heaven the Bible
[42:34] says it was to try them
[42:37] for forty years the man who would come
[42:40] down they gather these little things and
[42:41] they make bread out of it and for forty
[42:45] years did anyone actually when the
[42:47] Israelites did they granted they they
[42:48] gather this bread this manna did they
[42:51] inject any lemon in it or do they eat it
[42:54] pure I wonder it was their injection
[42:57] going on
[42:58] were they were they dialing in with the
[43:01] the genetics of him changing into
[43:03] something else it tastes like it tastes
[43:04] a little bit different were they messing
[43:07] with it if the type is right
[43:09] but they was I
[43:12] don't know
[43:14] now
[43:16] notice for spirit of judgment and he's
[43:21] in June 1:14 notice the seventh from
[43:24] Adam was Enoch right and he was what he
[43:26] saw the Lord he prophesied saying behold
[43:29] the Lord cometh with ten thousand of
[43:30] Saints to execute judgment upon all
[43:32] right
[43:34] all these wrong preachers bringing all
[43:37] these things correct so we see in the
[43:40] days of the open book it's over the days
[43:44] are at hand but also notice in the days
[43:48] of the open book a certain revelation is
[43:51] supposed to be given to
[43:54] Ezekiel to strengthen him
[43:58] what is that revelation
[44:02] there is something that God wants to
[44:05] show Ezekiel in these jiae's God does
[44:09] not come down with an open whoops no
[44:10] look for long there is a reason for
[44:14] everything
[44:16] what was one of the biggest things he
[44:18] shows was the next chapter remember I
[44:20] taught on this a year and a half ago I
[44:22] believe here
[44:24] what does God showing here God finds
[44:28] comes down and he put a form of a hand
[44:32] and took me up by the lock on my head
[44:34] and in the spirit lifted me up between
[44:37] you heaven the earth and brought me to
[44:38] the vision of God of God to Jerusalem to
[44:41] the door the inner gate that looketh
[44:43] toward the north and there was a seat
[44:45] and there was the seat of the image of
[44:47] jealousy was provoked provoked at to
[44:49] jealousy
[44:50] he lifts the prophet up and says in this
[44:54] day you've eaten
[44:57] you're strong now and I'm going to show
[45:00] you something to prophesy against and he
[45:03] lifts him up into the revelation into
[45:06] the spirit and he places them into the
[45:08] house of God
[45:10] this is what Moses set up this is what
[45:14] Solomon set up
[45:16] he takes him to what where God is
[45:19] supposed to dwell
[45:21] to a holy place there's no place like it
[45:24] on the face of the earth
[45:26] there they crucified Him there they took
[45:32] him there
[45:34] hello rewind
[45:36] hey man and behold notice but there in
[45:40] that before the house the gates on the
[45:43] north side they had an image of jealousy
[45:46] right
[45:48] it doesn't say what it was but whatever
[45:51] was it made the heart of God jealous
[45:54] they must have been giving credit or
[45:57] worship to something else besides God
[46:00] come on I
[46:02] shared this here before do you want to
[46:04] see it again go with me to John 6
[46:09] everyone understand are you seeing where
[46:11] we're facing things why Road side why do
[46:15] you keep hammering on this why do you
[46:16] keep showing this now I see
[46:19] now I understand my god keep remember
[46:22] when I taught him to give me nights last
[46:24] time sure it was the very old testament
[46:27] type of the methylated spirit
[46:30] why am i why is he keep showing any
[46:33] things because we somebody's going to
[46:35] see it
[46:37] somebody they say he's supposed to see
[46:38] it
[46:40] in John 6 notice very powerful portion
[46:45] of scripture here in John 6
[46:55] notice this in verse 30 John 6 verse 30
[46:58] everybody there amen let's read this
[47:02] they said therefore to what signs show
[47:05] us now then that we may see and believe
[47:07] thee what does that work
[47:10] notice our fathers did eat manna in the
[47:14] wilderness as it is written they went
[47:16] right to the scripture they quoted
[47:19] something back from the Old Testament
[47:21] from Moses day they did not bury they
[47:25] kept line upon line word upon word every
[47:28] comma period was perfect when they
[47:30] quoted the scripture right you're gonna
[47:32] find this is a quote collected back in
[47:34] time of Exodus
[47:36] he gave them bread from heaven to eat
[47:42] they were telling Jesus
[47:45] what he did
[47:47] but the Bible says that in this day the
[47:51] Jesus Christ would have the gift of the
[47:53] Masonic sign on him and he would be able
[47:56] to discern the thoughts and intents of
[47:58] the heart to man and women a night and
[48:00] notice as these Jews are saying they
[48:03] were quarrying of scripture to the
[48:05] Living God in flesh incarnate God in
[48:08] flesh they quoted one scripture to him
[48:10] and little God did
[48:12] he just turned them
[48:15] then jesus said to him barely barely
[48:17] saying to you Moses gave you not that
[48:20] bread
[48:23] in their hearts when they used the
[48:27] scripture and they said he
[48:29] they did not mean God
[48:33] in their hearts in their minds they
[48:38] thought it was Moses
[48:41] they had interjected a man a prophet
[48:45] higher than God
[48:48] when they set a perfect scripture
[48:51] so close to deceive the very elect a
[48:55] Moses did this and Moses to death and
[48:58] brother branham did this and brother
[48:59] Brett let me tell you something the
[49:01] Prophet said I was only there I had
[49:04] nothing to do with this SEMA
[49:08] do you see it
[49:10] an image of jealousy
[49:15] Amen
[49:16] so here a God takes him to the house of
[49:19] God Ezekiel in Ezekiel 5 and he said to
[49:23] me son of man lift up thine eyes now
[49:25] towards the way of the north notice the
[49:27] North has always been what the Eagle Age
[49:29] the North if there's if you see a 7 it's
[49:32] a 7 Church ages Amen if you see a 5 is
[49:35] Grace if you see North it means what it
[49:38] means the north side it is the eagle's
[49:42] dance side it's the north side it's our
[49:44] side amen it's our age it's our gate so
[49:50] I lifted up my eyes the way towards in
[49:52] order to behold the northward of the
[49:53] game of the altar this image of jealousy
[49:56] in the entry notice in this age in the
[49:58] Eagle age there means something that
[50:00] made God jealous a that
[50:02] yes
[50:05] and what does God say see son of man you
[50:08] see this image it makes me jealous he
[50:09] says you want to see more I'll take a
[50:11] deeper into it in the days of the open
[50:14] book in the days of the open book let
[50:19] that see
[50:20] in this day we're 55 years exactly
[50:25] exactly
[50:27] the Bible types cannot lie
[50:33] there has to be an image of jealousy out
[50:36] there again on our age
[50:39] so but now God says you know what well
[50:42] it's not worry that he says he said but
[50:44] turn you again and he shall see greater
[50:46] abomination because it's an abomination
[50:51] but notice here
[50:53] notice if they set if they set an image
[50:58] of jealousy on the north side what
[51:01] spirit is behind them because the
[51:03] prophet go he says now man Michael and
[51:06] and just as you that Lucifer and haven't
[51:09] tried to exalt himself and just be a
[51:10] liar a little higher than his boss he
[51:12] said and he betrayed Michael and made
[51:14] himself a great Kingdom in the north
[51:18] so Satan will always go to the north
[51:20] side to set up a new kingdom set up a
[51:23] new kingdom of the north side in our age
[51:26] a man
[51:28] notice he remembers sin did not begin on
[51:30] earth sin began in heaven when Lucifer
[51:32] taking the main amuses I was in about a
[51:35] denomination make a great big thing went
[51:38] on the North Country and set up a bigger
[51:40] thing to Michael handy was kicked out of
[51:41] heaven
[51:43] shows the spirit that was on in the days
[51:45] of the open book
[51:49] Isaiah 14:12 Howard our fall from heaven
[51:52] o Lucifer son of the morning how old are
[51:54] cut down to the ground which in weaken
[51:56] the nation's for the I said in my heart
[51:58] I will ascend into heaven how exalt my
[52:00] throne above the song to God I was sit
[52:01] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[52:03] in the sides of the North
[52:07] once again always pointing to the north
[52:11] side Satan's setting up his kingdom
[52:13] but God says forget that image now I
[52:15] want to show you greater than in other
[52:17] words worse than this
[52:20] and he brought me to the door of the
[52:22] court and when I looked at me holding a
[52:24] hole in the wall they had completely
[52:27] lacked off the house of God it was
[52:29] barred up
[52:31] blacked up no one could get in except
[52:34] those that were allowed
[52:37] then he said to me son of man dig down
[52:40] in the wall and when I dig in the wall
[52:42] behold a door right
[52:45] what does this mean we've been to the I
[52:47] thought to see everybody here and have
[52:48] to go right remember what this means
[52:52] and he said to me go in and behold the
[52:56] wicked abominations that they do here in
[52:58] the days of the open book
[53:01] in our day in that through house of God
[53:05] so I went in and saw behold every form
[53:08] of creeping things and abominable beasts
[53:11] and all the idols of the house of Israel
[53:13] portrayed upon the wall roundabout
[53:15] notice says every form of creepy thing
[53:21] Genesis 1:25 that was the creeping
[53:24] things came on the sixth day
[53:28] Romans 1:23 notice if they reject the
[53:32] true revelation of judgment the to
[53:34] revelation of God had came down in
[53:36] revelations 1 and they rejected it and
[53:40] professing themselves to be in the bride
[53:43] wise they became fools and changed the
[53:46] glory of the uncorruptible God into the
[53:48] image making like a the corruptible man
[53:50] and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[53:51] of creepy things
[53:55] this is all tying in here
[54:00] now I'm going to read this portions will
[54:02] be reading here everybody ok still got
[54:03] strength you need wave your hands wave
[54:05] your hands a little bit and praise the
[54:07] Lord say thank you Lord Jesus a matter
[54:08] why because we find ourselves in the
[54:11] time of the open book and it behooves
[54:15] each one of us to enter now in we go
[54:18] home tonight for 10 15 20 minutes
[54:21] whatever open that word to the Lord what
[54:23] will you have your servant to know I'm
[54:26] going to take it and I'm gonna dig down
[54:28] into this word and I believe Lord I
[54:32] believe with all faith you'll reveal
[54:33] something true something
[54:35] that will strengthen you strengthen me
[54:37] shrink it all say van we need this
[54:40] strength we need to know that we have to
[54:42] discern their very spirit within we have
[54:45] to to that point where we don't have we
[54:46] don't even need to see in action as
[54:48] Christ then as they quoted the census
[54:50] said Moses okay God he gave us man of
[54:53] the king from heaven and they meant the
[54:55] product we need to have that kind of
[54:58] discernment in our midst we need to get
[55:01] all nine spiritual gifts right here
[55:03] operating tongues included
[55:05] interpretation included absolutely okay
[55:08] we have to get beside ourselves they
[55:09] might we have to get free of the Spirit
[55:11] John was in the spirit in the Lord today
[55:14] and the Prophet said the majority of
[55:16] people never receive the Holy Ghost
[55:18] because they don't get in the spirit we
[55:21] must be have brother when the Holy Ghost
[55:24] hits you you must not one thing what he
[55:27] thinks or what he thinks or she
[55:29] and we don't if you've ever been in a
[55:31] spirit you don't care
[55:33] it's just you and the husband what I
[55:36] don't want a man you just were she was
[55:38] loud if you wanted you want to show that
[55:40] you you love him amen I've been there a
[55:43] man absolutely where it doesn't matter
[55:45] you jump and shout and you're just
[55:47] running you thanking God for everything
[55:49] he done for you and the majority what
[55:51] you say is I love you I love you living
[55:53] a man that's the truth that if you've
[55:57] been there at this one fine
[55:59] you're in the holy place there God comes
[56:02] down and he says just worship yes
[56:07] then but then he always does he leaves
[56:10] will be like Oh merci you scored that
[56:12] little depression you
[56:15] know all right all right let's go this
[56:17] was what did he see in that first round
[56:19] he broke through that he opened the door
[56:21] he breaks through into the first chamber
[56:23] in the house of God and
[56:27] look what the Prophet says here this is
[56:29] only found in the church age book
[56:32] now as a well-known historical fact that
[56:35] when this era crept into the church when
[56:36] men began to vie for the office of the
[56:39] bishop he's dealing with the clergy with
[56:41] the result of that position was being
[56:43] given to the more educated materially
[56:46] progressive and politically minded men
[56:48] human knowledge and the program began to
[56:51] take over divine Windom wisdoms place
[56:53] and the Holy Spirit no longer controlled
[56:56] man was taking over the leadership of
[57:00] the Holy Ghost right this indeed was
[57:03] tragic a tragic evil for the bishops
[57:05] began to maintain there was no longer
[57:07] requiring a transparent Christian
[57:09] character to minister either the word or
[57:12] the right to the church was elements and
[57:13] Sarah that ceremony they counted this
[57:15] allowed evil man to do choose to Rend
[57:18] the flap right
[57:19] this is the first church age or right in
[57:22] that area with a man named dr. with the
[57:24] elevation of the deeds are the great
[57:28] ones of the day then oh don't don't help
[57:31] you could not say anything against what
[57:32] those brothers teachers because he's you
[57:34] no no no to the place that was not
[57:37] accorded them in Scripture the next step
[57:40] was handed out of graded titles that
[57:42] build up religion a religious hierarchy
[57:44] for soon there were Archbishop's bishops
[57:46] Cardinals Archbishop's always and poll
[57:49] just to the pot or to the to the Pope
[57:50] right with that nickel a attend doctrine
[57:53] and the egg remaining a lag collimation
[57:57] somebody
[57:59] amalgamation but thank you my wife
[58:04] amalgamation God if you could all you if
[58:07] you guys could always see what kind of
[58:08] school I got food oh Christianity with
[58:11] Babylonians I'm doing Nets results had
[58:13] to be what Ezekiel saw in
[58:16] 810 in the days of the open
[58:22] our day this is not pre 63
[58:28] this is not 33 when the the voice came
[58:31] down and program the 17th person no no
[58:34] this is when the cloud was formed 26
[58:39] miles high where no vapor can exist a
[58:45] month later the Prophet goes back to
[58:49] Jeffersonville seven days in a row the
[58:52] angel of God would come down and break
[58:54] every seal and
[58:56] now we're 50 years down the road and
[58:59] look what Ezekiel's finding here in the
[59:03] days of the open book
[59:05] thanks God you see how serious a time
[59:08] point we're at now
[59:09] now remember we're still coming back to
[59:12] the original scriptures in Luke 17 and
[59:13] 14 okay why were they so last
[59:18] November there were
[59:21] three deeds the Nicolaitans have three
[59:24] deeds when it comes to deeds
[59:26] number one they form groups
[59:29] number two they rank within the groups
[59:32] and number three pastors are traveling
[59:34] more than the arrow
[59:36] they use of authority over other and
[59:40] that's very scriptural that's very so I
[59:44] have a whole entire entire study on that
[59:46] so we see is the Nicolaitans I've taken
[59:49] over the house of God
[59:51] now they do it's culturally and there
[59:55] stood before them seventy men of the
[59:57] Ancients of Israel and the midst of them
[1:00:00] stood a man of prominent two prominent
[1:00:02] name the son of jazz and I are the son
[1:00:04] of a chef on chiffon with each man his
[1:00:07] censer in his hand in a thick cloud of
[1:00:09] incense went up notice they were praying
[1:00:11] long prayers very religious weren't a
[1:00:14] very religious hymn Jesus talked about
[1:00:17] long prayers incense he said those are
[1:00:19] prayers of saints right
[1:00:20] that Bertram's said that was the quote
[1:00:22] there's someone in scripture about that
[1:00:24] too
[1:00:24] but no lines back up with Exodus 1 1
[1:00:29] verse 5 and all the souls are youing of
[1:00:32] Scripture numbers
[1:00:35] 1116 and the Lord said to Moses gather
[1:00:37] unto me 70 men of the elder visitor whom
[1:00:40] thou has known to be the elders of the
[1:00:41] people and the officers over them and
[1:00:43] bring them to the tablet and
[1:00:44] congregation they shall stand with me
[1:00:46] there and I will come down and talk with
[1:00:48] you there now the spirit of them which
[1:00:51] is upon thee and put it upon that look
[1:00:52] they can go back to the Word of God and
[1:00:55] say look okay we formed a group so what
[1:00:57] we have all these abominations so what
[1:00:59] we're doing according to the scripture
[1:01:00] 70
[1:01:04] very close
[1:01:06] now
[1:01:08] in the days the open book when the
[1:01:11] revelation Phaeton's comes down
[1:01:15] and it is starting to be preached I
[1:01:20] took you to the end
[1:01:22] the open books here we've eaten it it's
[1:01:25] the end at the end god takes in the
[1:01:27] house of God
[1:01:29] what is net
[1:01:33] saints of God it is time now
[1:01:37] comes down is now time to sigh and cry
[1:01:40] for the abominations done the city this
[1:01:43] marched the time to pray for the latter
[1:01:47] rain this marks the last time we get a
[1:01:50] chance to pray is at this time I
[1:01:53] have been now teaching on the
[1:01:55] Nicolaitans for five years when it first
[1:01:58] was come to me and now now you see the
[1:02:01] time line where we're at I
[1:02:04] hope you can see this this is getting so
[1:02:07] clear to me
[1:02:10] sighing and crying for the abominations
[1:02:12] done in the city right
[1:02:15] why because judgment must hit the house
[1:02:18] of God first I
[1:02:21] want to ask you something at the angel
[1:02:24] of the came to the city which was the
[1:02:26] Holy Spirit dressed in white like to his
[1:02:28] purity if that angel came tight and went
[1:02:31] through the Pentecostal churches where
[1:02:33] in the world would he find men has sighs
[1:02:35] and cries and begs all night in the city
[1:02:37] who we mark who is he going to fight
[1:02:39] we're going to find out we've got the
[1:02:40] Holy Ghost priest soon
[1:02:43] yeah I'm not here to bring a flowery
[1:02:46] sermon I am here to show you what
[1:02:49] God did not want me to teach on what I
[1:02:52] wanted to teach on he had my pastor get
[1:02:54] sick he allowed my pastic is sick I did
[1:02:57] not have time to study for tomorrow's
[1:02:58] service and all the hair left was this
[1:03:01] so this is
[1:03:03] taking eat
[1:03:05] [Laughter]
[1:03:07] you're seeing the book unfolded before
[1:03:10] you this is not my doing
[1:03:12] this is what he showed
[1:03:16] now look at this
[1:03:20] where do we get the fire of God and he
[1:03:23] said you get that bunch of lukewarm
[1:03:25] church members down to the altar and let
[1:03:28] them pray through and
[1:03:31] what happens when you pray through in
[1:03:34] prayer or you break through in prayer
[1:03:36] till the Holy Ghost sets their soul of
[1:03:39] fire
[1:03:40] why did the fourth virgin not go on the
[1:03:43] rapture because they did not pray
[1:03:45] through and get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:50] here's a mystery
[1:03:54] x21
[1:03:56] what exactly took place in here before
[1:03:59] the mighty rushing wind comes in fills a
[1:04:02] place like a fire like a fire like a
[1:04:04] fire with fire
[1:04:06] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:04:09] come they were all in one Accord in one
[1:04:13] place
[1:04:15] does it ever say what they were doing in
[1:04:18] the scripture
[1:04:24] but on the day of Pentecost there came a
[1:04:27] sound from heaven like a mighty rushing
[1:04:29] wind and those views had been crying and
[1:04:32] signed for the abomination did in the
[1:04:35] city a man hallelujah they have just
[1:04:37] crucified their Lord and Savior Obama
[1:04:41] but they not only did they crucify him
[1:04:45] but he rose again and revealed himself
[1:04:47] to them
[1:04:51] and now
[1:04:53] Jesus has descended
[1:04:57] and they said look what they've done
[1:04:59] they've rejected the key
[1:05:01] and God said go or tarry in Jerusalem
[1:05:04] and they got so filled with
[1:05:07] sorrow they said Lord how old he's going
[1:05:11] to be saved how what are we gonna do for
[1:05:12] you what was the plan for us Lord reveal

[1:10:00] tonight
[1:10:01] I'm here to tell you what was told me
[1:10:04] six months ago
[1:10:08] and I waited on that Lord why did he say
[1:10:12] that I believe the man sincere I think
[1:10:14] there was some in
[1:10:17] because that doesn't sound like what I
[1:10:19] would think he would say
[1:10:23] now notice it is not near there's direct
[1:10:27] opposition to the word of the Prophet
[1:10:30] that is not sticking with the word of
[1:10:33] the law this is not what the Prophet
[1:10:35] said
[1:10:41] because this is what the Word of God
[1:10:44] said to the Prophet more of the world
[1:10:46] Lord telling me at last I was sent a man
[1:10:48] thus saith the Lord God of Israel and
[1:10:50] and the end is come upon the four
[1:10:54] corners of all the way over the land
[1:10:57] it's over
[1:11:02] God anoints Ezekiel
[1:11:05] to prophesy the end to this group here
[1:11:09] this group right here notice there's two
[1:11:12] men
[1:11:13] in Ezekiel if you read the rest of
[1:11:16] chapter is he go prophesized to him that
[1:11:18] no boy it's over
[1:11:22] look what happens and it came to pass
[1:11:25] when I prophesied that pilikia the son
[1:11:27] of Ania died
[1:11:29] why did he die
[1:11:32] because his name is Jehovah has
[1:11:34] delivered no he hasn't it's over
[1:11:38] destruction is coming
[1:11:42] he had Adelita prosperity gospel
[1:11:46] but God said it's over it's an ending
[1:11:48] don't put your things on your IRA than
[1:11:51] your stocks and bonds and all those
[1:11:53] things were there
[1:11:58] but what happened Balaam he's succeeding
[1:12:01] succeeded in weakening Israel what did
[1:12:04] he do he weakened their camp God let him
[1:12:08] go and weakened their capital oooh - the
[1:12:10] whole camp God let him do it he did not
[1:12:14] stop him he wanted to see who in Israel
[1:12:17] would stay with the word of dr.
[1:12:19] Haman who has been let the Spirit of God
[1:12:22] control their lives let them him lead
[1:12:25] him guiding into all truth I
[1:12:31] don't care what this ministers preaching
[1:12:34] I don't care what this ministers
[1:12:36] preaching big little who enemy
[1:12:39] what does the word of God reveal today
[1:12:43] in our day of the open book and
[1:12:48] when some doctrine starts
[1:12:51] that's not the Bible truth it pollutes
[1:12:55] the whole camp what was their message
[1:12:57] it is not here go build your big old
[1:12:59] houses
[1:13:01] go invest and be something big thing or
[1:13:03] make start some kind of be something and
[1:13:05] then finally when they listen to this
[1:13:08] false teacher coming among them and
[1:13:10] teach them wrong he weaken the camp and
[1:13:12] cross your mind oh my
[1:13:17] now
[1:13:20] let me show you what happened here
[1:13:26] notice he says they have they're not
[1:13:29] convinced that's all they don't believe
[1:13:31] it they just take their tradition what
[1:13:34] is their tradition all glowing of God
[1:13:36] Jesus is coming pretty soon you know
[1:13:39] that can become a tradition
[1:13:41] [Laughter]
[1:13:43] he says brother
[1:13:47] God is coming soon man why is your camp
[1:13:50] over here what's your what you want on
[1:13:52] vacation like in a week in like a month
[1:13:54] you want to go with us maybe in like a
[1:13:55] year let's plan a year ahead let's do
[1:13:57] this with that let's go do this this
[1:14:00] but Lord's the Lord's coming you it's
[1:14:02] okay it's gonna cost he'll just a tour
[1:14:05] or we gotta go do this or do that
[1:14:07] it has this become a tradition and
[1:14:11] there's nothing wrong with those things
[1:14:13] I'm see what I'm saying but when it
[1:14:15] comes to the coming of the Lord and you
[1:14:20] don't want to prepare yourself but
[1:14:22] invest in something else
[1:14:24] because there's a balance
[1:14:31] amen he says if you believe that there'd
[1:14:35] be the biggest cry in the city you ever
[1:14:37] heard
[1:14:39] it's a tradition it's not a reality to
[1:14:41] the people it doesn't it doesn't pan out
[1:14:45] it proves it doesn't they're not
[1:14:47] convinced that he's coming in the let me
[1:14:49] say this in the days of the open book ah
[1:14:55] I hope you're seeing this oh this is
[1:14:59] like transparent clear transparent gold
[1:15:02] one cleared
[1:15:04] hey men cuz I didn't come up with this
[1:15:07] now let's continue
[1:15:10] we're not very much on church buildings
[1:15:13] in these days because we truly believe
[1:15:15] with all our heart the Lord Jesus is
[1:15:16] coming soon the seventh church age
[1:15:20] messenger did not build a big old mega
[1:15:22] church and he could have filled it
[1:15:25] the biggest of anything you need to
[1:15:28] build he were filled in
[1:15:31] when Mission airs on the field preaching
[1:15:33] gospel oh shoot on eating a bun meal day
[1:15:35] how could a million dollar church in the
[1:15:36] face how can we build a million dollar
[1:15:38] church in the face of that that was back
[1:15:40] then
[1:15:41] and what about now
[1:15:47] now
[1:15:48] these men in chapter 10 were preaching
[1:15:52] it is not here build your houses well
[1:15:57] what does they have to do look at the
[1:15:59] effects of it
[1:16:03] Ezekiel 12
[1:16:07] and I'll scatter every scatter toward
[1:16:11] everyone all that are about him to help
[1:16:13] him in on being I'll draw out the sword
[1:16:15] after them and they shall know that I am
[1:16:17] the Lord and when I shall scatter them
[1:16:18] among the nations of this first time in
[1:16:20] the country's pieces but I will leave a
[1:16:22] few men of them from the sword and from
[1:16:26] the famine and from the pestilence that
[1:16:28] they may declare all their abominations
[1:16:30] among the heathen whether the comedy
[1:16:31] show know that I am the Lord there is
[1:16:33] your third pull for the bride there is a
[1:16:36] judgment coming there's a destruction
[1:16:38] coming it's the end and evil draws nigh
[1:16:41] but God says I'll leave up people Joel -
[1:16:43] harming people amen that was prophesied
[1:16:47] again
[1:16:48] people running the streets wives is
[1:16:50] taking place this is happening like what
[1:16:53] Olivia people things because you got
[1:16:55] wrong
[1:16:56] you wouldn't serve God you wouldn't rip
[1:16:59] Heather your sins but at that time it'll
[1:17:02] be too late
[1:17:05] now
[1:17:08] why and the word of Lord came to me
[1:17:11] saying son of man what is that proverb
[1:17:14] that you have in Atlanta notice they had
[1:17:16] preached these 25 men and preached this
[1:17:19] so much
[1:17:23] what is this proverb that you have in
[1:17:25] the land of it were saying the days are
[1:17:27] prolonged and every vision faileth these
[1:17:32] 25 men who stood at the east gate
[1:17:37] where Moses said that's where Moses
[1:17:40] camped in the Old Testament at the
[1:17:43] entrance of the east toward salvation
[1:17:46] towards the altar the brass ladder the
[1:17:50] holy place the holiest of Holies they
[1:17:52] started right at the entrance and they
[1:17:53] preached this and it affected the people
[1:17:55] so much it became a proverb
[1:18:00] it became a saying we got plenty of time
[1:18:04] okay
[1:18:06] doing great
[1:18:09] take ease
[1:18:12] it's okay those eyelids get a little
[1:18:15] heavy and just relax a little bit just
[1:18:17] calm down yourself
[1:18:20] God knows your heart it's gonna be okay
[1:18:23] hey
[1:18:26] you know what was said to me
[1:18:30] and he pulls it from a quote and he said
[1:18:33] you know brother
[1:18:39] and I said no it's not gonna be that
[1:18:42] and you didn't he didn't he didn't bite
[1:18:45] back I said no it's not gonna be that
[1:18:48] something as I said knows
[1:18:53] why is he trying to ease my spirit
[1:19:00] and I set that on a shelf from what six
[1:19:02] seven months until God brought this to
[1:19:05] me in Texas and I read until oh my
[1:19:08] goodness in the days of the open book
[1:19:12] there would be people trying to calm you
[1:19:16] down
[1:19:17] to take the fire off of you for lost
[1:19:21] souls to to pray all night to sigh and
[1:19:24] cry for the abominations in the city it
[1:19:27] wants you to just relax and
[1:19:31] focus all a week
[1:19:34] plenty of time fifty-five years this
[1:19:38] could go tundra you know brother man

[1:20:02] Lord take control and alter our 10-year
[1:20:05] goal our five-year goal if we do not ask
[1:20:09] the Lord why why did they fail in the

[1:21:21] and God heard my prayer I had faith that
[1:21:26] he heard my prayer and he heard it and
[1:21:28] he did not he chose not to speak to me
[1:21:31] but he had anointed another son here
[1:21:33] gifted I said call him and tell him what
[1:21:36] to do amen

[1:22:10] calm people down
[1:22:12] because we've got to be looking for
[1:22:14] right now notice the spirit in the
[1:22:17] Prophet was saying right
[1:22:21] but we don't know it could be possibly
[1:22:23] gonna hurt us now it could be 500 years
[1:22:26] a thousand ten thousand I don't know
[1:22:29] nobody knows but a Coquille he comes
[1:22:32] after the days of the open book in that
[1:22:36] generation to see that shall not perish
[1:22:39] till all things come to pass
[1:22:42] and God opens the book in that time
[1:22:45] period and the message is it's over
[1:22:51] saints of God I
[1:22:55] don't want you to get I don't want to
[1:22:58] take any fire from you things to be at
[1:23:01] ease from one second about the coming of
[1:23:03] the Lord

[1:23:48] ago I've heard it already heard this and
[1:23:51] they shall no more use it as a proverb
[1:23:54] in Israel but they shelled so but say

[1:24:22] vision for I am the Lord I will speak
[1:24:25] and the word that I shall speak shall
[1:24:27] come to pass and so it will be no longer
[1:24:29] prolonged see there was a time of
