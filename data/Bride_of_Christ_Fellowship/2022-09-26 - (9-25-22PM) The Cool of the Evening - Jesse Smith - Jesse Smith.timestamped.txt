[1:15] Garden in the cool of the day and Adam
[1:18] and his wife hid themselves from the
[1:21] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:23] Trees of the garden verse 9 and the Lord
[1:26] God called unto Adam

[3:24] not sure how long this will be this
[3:26] might not be a long sermon we'll kind of
[3:27] see how it goes
[3:28] I just want to take a little thought
[3:30] here for communion tonight
[3:32] the grace of God
[3:34] are we thankful for this morning's word
[3:36] that we heard praise God I was amen and
[3:38] I were talking about the blood and it's
[3:40] just so refreshing praise God I need
[3:42] that
[3:44] the enemy will come in and Whisper and
[3:46] he'll you know and I'll sin I'll make a
[3:47] mistake I'll feel awful then the word of
[3:50] God says if I confess my sins I am back
[3:53] in the light
[3:54] as he is in the light praise God and I
[3:56] can have Fellowship again so that's kind
[3:59] of what this message is about here
[4:00] tonight just a simple thought so I set a
[4:03] timer for half an hour we'll see
[4:05] struggle at least half an hour
[4:07] we'll see how it goes here you know just
[4:10] a few scriptures and there were you know
[4:11] mainly some quotes I was listening to
[4:12] brother Brandon yesterday and just had
[4:14] mainly some quotes I want to read I
[4:15] think there'll be just encouragement to
[4:17] you
[4:18] uh just to kind of how the brother man
[4:20] uses his imagination maybe it was
[4:21] prophetic Vision maybe it was
[4:23] imagination we were not he doesn't
[4:25] really tell us you know
[4:26] the ram said if it ever was uh uh from
[4:29] the Lord it would give it thus saith the
[4:30] Lord you know
[4:32] so not sure but I just want to start
[4:34] hearing Genesis 3 you know eight and
[4:36] nine and how the Lord come down in the
[4:38] cool of the day he was coming down for
[4:40] that Fellowship
[4:42] with his children praise God Adam and
[4:45] Eve and of course we know he found he
[4:47] found them in you know a sinful state
[4:52] uh but you know I just thought it was uh
[4:54] uh you know interesting and beautiful
[4:55] here how how God had would come down
[4:57] every day to meet with his his children
[5:00] and I just want to say you know just a
[5:02] general look at scripture you know a lot
[5:04] of great things happen in the evening
[5:05] time you know uh
[5:07] when when Noah let out the dub the Dove
[5:10] came back in the evening time so he so
[5:13] uh Noah got this reassurance that God is
[5:15] going to keep his promise and it came in
[5:18] the evening time and the dove represents
[5:19] the Holy Spirit
[5:22] Hallelujah of course that's one type of
[5:24] the Holy Spirit course the Holy Spirit
[5:25] fell at 9 A.M on the day of Pentecost
[5:27] morning time so God's spirit can come at
[5:30] any time of the day but I just want to
[5:32] take this one thought you know I'm going
[5:33] to go back to Genesis yeah
[5:37] um you know God can come anytime but
[5:38] there's just you know these special
[5:40] moments in scripture where God
[5:41] ministered in the evening time you know
[5:44] Ellie easer had made this long trip you
[5:46] know to get a bride for Isaac and he
[5:48] came to the uh the place of the camels
[5:50] the rest his camps there uh you know
[5:53] that Layman's place there and and uh the
[5:55] Bible said he rested in the evening time
[5:58] he came to the city the well at the
[6:01] evening time and the Bible said that
[6:02] evening time he let out a prayer and he
[6:04] said oh Lord God I pray thee send me
[6:07] good speed this day and show kindness
[6:09] unto my master Abraham
[6:12] remember Abraham had prayed that the
[6:14] angel Lord would go before Eliezer
[6:16] praise God
[6:18] the Sea church when everybody's praying
[6:19] together God is going to work out
[6:20] everything in your life praise God in
[6:22] other words pray before the trip
[6:24] all right we got an Amish strip coming
[6:25] up right pray before the trip pray
[6:28] during the trip praise God pray after
[6:30] the trip
[6:31] in other words keep that constant
[6:33] communion with the Lord praise God and
[6:35] that's what Elias are experienced he
[6:37] knew the prophet had prayed for him
[6:39] but when he got there and he really
[6:41] needed God to move he said a humble
[6:43] prayer and he said Lord let it be this
[6:45] way Lord if it be your will let it be
[6:47] this way kind of like get in he would
[6:49] have fleece before the Lord Lord If It
[6:50] Be Your Will would you please answer
[6:52] this way
[6:54] and I'd heard that you know there was
[6:55] over a hundred gallons of water that
[6:57] Rebecca I heard a preacher say you know
[6:59] he he researched how many gallons to to
[7:01] feed those uh camel 10 camels how much
[7:04] water would you need for 10 camels
[7:06] 100 gallons that we just carried I carry
[7:08] five gallons of milk every Wednesday to
[7:11] my family you know five's a lot I have a
[7:13] hard time carrying it you know in my two
[7:15] hands you know I kind of grip them like
[7:16] this you know and I can carry those
[7:18] those five gallons she made all those
[7:21] trips think about that 100 gallons all
[7:23] those trips and it was an answer to
[7:25] prayer
[7:26] you talk about a worker how about that
[7:28] 100 gallons of water
[7:30] he was praying Lord give me a clear sign
[7:32] that this Rebecca you know or this woman
[7:34] whoever it is is a real servant may she
[7:36] want to labor may she want to just be a
[7:39] servant tonight
[7:41] and bring water to all the camels
[7:44] and so Rebecca got anointed by the Holy
[7:46] Spirit she must have had at this now the
[7:48] thing about that evening time she worked
[7:49] all day
[7:51] some of you moms and dads work all day
[7:53] you know and coming to the evening and
[7:55] God will give you a special anointing
[7:57] praise God he'll just anoint you to
[7:59] fulfill the word of God hallelujah
[8:00] that's what I'm going to be like on
[8:01] Wednesday night I want to be even though
[8:03] I work all day I want to be anointed of
[8:04] the holy spirit so God can still hear
[8:06] your prayers so I can put my prayers
[8:08] with your prayers and the Holy Spirit
[8:10] can so speak to us on the Wednesday
[8:11] night or a Sunday night I just think
[8:13] it's beautiful that she was able to
[8:15] labor let's say 50 gallons 100 whatever
[8:18] it was all those gallons of water
[8:20] and being led by the Holy Spirit to do
[8:22] that and didn't even know she was
[8:24] watering her trip to meet her husband
[8:26] praise God she was she was doing her
[8:28] part Amen to allow herself to be able to
[8:32] to leave
[8:34] you know her I'll say like this her
[8:35] family behind and go to meet the
[8:37] bridegroom praise God just a beautiful
[8:38] story it came in the evening time so
[8:41] Assurance came in the evening time for
[8:42] Noah here Assurance comes in the evening
[8:44] time for Eliezer I know God heard my
[8:46] prayer Hallelujah I know God heard the
[8:49] prophet's prayer and then even connected
[8:52] to that you know uh Isaac when he was
[8:54] out meditating in the field the Bible
[8:56] said it was that Eventide
[8:58] event tied in uh Genesis 24th later on
[9:01] in that chapter
[9:02] verse 63 he went out to meditate in the
[9:06] field at even time don't you like that
[9:08] time where you can just you know the
[9:10] world calls it me time I just need some
[9:12] me time
[9:13] but really for us it's not me time it's
[9:16] us time
[9:17] Jesus and me praise God hallelujah is
[9:20] that how you feel when you want to talk
[9:22] with the Lord you know it's not it's not
[9:23] really meantime it's it's our time
[9:25] together Lord hallelujah
[9:27] and so Isaac went out to have a little
[9:29] Lord time he went to have some talk with
[9:31] his Heavenly Father praise God he went
[9:34] out there to meditate on the things of
[9:35] God and his prayer was answered in other
[9:38] words his faith became sight in the
[9:40] evening time
[9:41] praise God
[9:43] he lift up his eyes and saw and behold
[9:45] the camels were coming there was his
[9:47] bride Hallelujah you know he'd been
[9:49] heartbroken he lost his mother you know
[9:50] but here in the evening time here comes
[9:52] his bride praise God and we know the
[9:54] scripture now and I haven't studied this
[9:55] one real deep but the Bible does say in
[9:57] Zechariah in the evening time it shall
[9:59] be light praise God in other words in a
[10:01] time of Darkness there's going to come a
[10:04] great light praise God
[10:06] and that you know I think that scripture
[10:07] has actually multiple uh prophecies in
[10:10] it being fulfilled uh of course we know
[10:12] the Jews will receive Jesus Christ right
[10:15] in the middle or towards the you know
[10:17] the middle of the Great Tribulation a
[10:18] time of crazy Darkness Unthinkable
[10:21] Darkness but in even in the evening time
[10:23] it shall be light praise God Jesus
[10:26] Christ will come to them at a nation 144
[10:29] 000 will be born in one day Hallelujah
[10:32] amazing in the evening time it will
[10:34] still be light praise God
[10:36] some person told me try to say that oh
[10:38] we're we're in total darkness and they
[10:40] said well I've got quotes on this we're
[10:42] in total darkness I said you
[10:43] misunderstood the quotes
[10:44] I said the world's in total darkness but
[10:46] I said if you turn to the Rapture
[10:48] scripture in first Thessalonians 4 and 5
[10:49] the Bible said we are not children of
[10:52] the night we are children of the day
[10:53] praise God in other words even though
[10:55] the whole world is in darkness we've got
[10:57] a spiritual Shiloh we've got a place
[11:00] where God's light is clearly shining on
[11:02] our lives amen we're not walking in
[11:04] darkness we're not wondering and groping
[11:06] where am I what's we know we can see
[11:09] plainly that God is with us God is for
[11:11] us hallelujah we have fellowship with
[11:13] God we know where we're going Hallelujah
[11:15] we know where we're headed we know what
[11:16] we're living for praise God Amen we have
[11:19] light we're not just stumbling around
[11:20] can you imagine just stumbling around in
[11:22] the Darkness
[11:23] you know just trying to find your path
[11:25] that's not us
[11:27] the Bible says God's word is a lamp unto
[11:30] our feet amen and a light unto our path
[11:32] Hallelujah
[11:34] and so we have all these great promises
[11:36] you know in the scripture
[11:38] you know and like I said like I said
[11:40] there's many different types you could
[11:41] use for example you know we're talking
[11:43] about evening time right here with Adam
[11:45] and Eve and these different places but
[11:46] the Bible says the remember the parable
[11:48] of the wise and bluish virgins when did
[11:50] The Cry go out to meet him at midnight
[11:53] well that's way past the cool of the
[11:55] evening
[11:56] so see there's all these different and
[11:57] then brother man preaches Shalom and
[11:59] says we have a new day he said we
[12:01] started a new day
[12:02] the morning he said it's the morning
[12:04] time so that's why you know we don't I'm
[12:07] just we don't want to go too far on just
[12:09] one type you know what I mean because
[12:10] there's many types you can use we are
[12:12] children of the day
[12:14] you know so uh the beautiful part is we
[12:17] have we we can see we can see Christ in
[12:20] all these different types in the Bible
[12:21] so in one type it's midnight we're
[12:23] trimming our lamps praise God we're
[12:25] trimming our lamps getting all the uh uh
[12:27] all the all the dust out there and I
[12:29] should say dust but all the uh was the
[12:31] carbon getting all the carbon off our
[12:33] lamps you know getting it all trimmed so
[12:34] it can shine really bright
[12:36] another time and another type where
[12:38] right at the evening time the Sun is
[12:40] setting it's the end of the day praise
[12:42] God and another type we're in the we're
[12:45] in total daytime the Sun is bright and
[12:47] we're looking for Jesus to come praise
[12:49] God I mean there's all these different
[12:50] types in the scripture
[12:52] and they can be used for different
[12:54] purposes praise God but tonight is for
[12:57] communion by God's grace tonight is for
[12:58] a community so now with that said I just
[13:00] wanted to just that was just a brief
[13:02] review
[13:03] of just a few scriptures about the even
[13:05] tide but now let's go back to Genesis I
[13:07] want to just spend the majority of my
[13:08] time there reading a few quotes and you
[13:11] know looking at this scripture again
[13:13] you know we read no scripture but you'll
[13:15] see how brother Brown dramatizes this
[13:17] text that we read in a different way
[13:20] so we'll get to that in just a moment
[13:21] but
[13:22] um this first quote brother random says
[13:25] um God would come down every evening to
[13:27] talk to them
[13:28] uh this is from 1955. now in the
[13:30] beginning when God come down the evening
[13:32] and talk to Adam and Eve and the cool of
[13:33] the day his great voice whispered to
[13:36] them here we get a picture of God would
[13:38] come down and God would whisper to them
[13:40] at night time
[13:41] isn't that what you do when you get the
[13:43] kids ready for bed or they when you're
[13:44] really tired don't you just you shout
[13:46] and scream at nighttime
[13:48] no no you you whisper you kind of take
[13:50] your voice down it's evening time
[13:53] and they had Fellowship love one another
[13:55] how the moving of the spirit went
[13:58] through the bushes
[13:59] the lions come up the Tigers all of them
[14:02] and they Worship the Lord man was
[14:04] conscious at all times
[14:06] that his presence was with him so Adam
[14:10] and Eve would come to a spot and they
[14:11] could imagine all the tigers and lions
[14:13] all the animals gather out in Adam and
[14:15] Eve I wonder if they got down on their
[14:16] knees and said we love you Lord they
[14:19] just had a worship service I love you
[14:22] Lord
[14:24] and I
[14:25] live Bible and he would just whisper my
[14:28] brother brother man dramatized it how
[14:30] was your day in my garden today
[14:32] did you enjoy your day
[14:35] it was beautiful Lord we got to eat from
[14:37] this tree and took a ride on the lion
[14:40] hey Melissa one day where's he she wants
[14:42] to ride one day on the line and I said I
[14:44] think he will
[14:45] if the wolf will lay down by the lamb I
[14:48] think he'll ride a lion praise God
[14:50] in the Millennium too I mean even before
[14:52] the future home
[14:55] but brother Adam said the Lord would
[14:57] come down every evening and talk and
[14:59] Whisper
[15:00] you enjoy walking across the mountains
[15:03] did you enjoy that hike
[15:05] now look they didn't even sweat the
[15:06] whole time can you imagine you enjoy
[15:09] running around the hills did you well
[15:11] how was your run today
[15:14] oh yes Father
[15:16] we we had our arms around each other as
[15:18] we walked around the Lakes
[15:20] thank you for this wonderful day in your
[15:22] garden Lord
[15:26] order of Adam climbed up the giraffe's
[15:28] neck or something like that
[15:30] or the the T-Rex because they had all
[15:34] those dinosaurs oh yes Lord I got to
[15:36] ride the T-Rex today
[15:38] great ride
[15:41] he would just come down and Whisper
[15:43] brother man says that then again in 1957
[15:46] he says let's go back in our minds back
[15:49] to the Early times what a beautiful
[15:51] Fellowship it must have been when God
[15:52] called his children in the cool of the
[15:54] evening and communed with them
[15:56] he said then kissing them as it was on
[15:59] their cheese
[16:00] and laying them down to sleep for a
[16:02] night's rest
[16:03] and the wild beasts of the field he
[16:05] bedded down without any disturbance no
[16:08] no any any I'm sorry no harm no harm no
[16:11] death no sickness no trouble to awake on
[16:14] a new day to walk in the prince of their
[16:16] creator without sickness oh God our
[16:18] Spirits grown for that time again for
[16:21] that's what we were made
[16:23] oh my I was made that that I was just
[16:26] lay down and the Lord would kiss my
[16:28] cheek and say good night brother Jess
[16:31] and then all the animals would lay down
[16:33] each one by us
[16:35] it's going to be great one day Lord
[16:36] willing in the future you know in the
[16:37] Millennium brother will wake up

[17:06] 10 years here we got oh my just
[17:10] oh I feel so fresh today
[17:12] oh my God
[17:13] made this Earth for
[17:16] that we would have peace and
[17:19] perfect Fellowship perfect communion
[17:21] that's what it was made for
[17:24] now we get little moments of that you
[17:25] know we get little moments where we wake
[17:27] up and we feel refreshed and
[17:29] the morning just seems everything seems
[17:30] to go right
[17:32] of course then there's the chaotic level
[17:34] and there's the chaotic mornings you
[17:36] know where it doesn't go so well
[17:39] you're woken up you know in shock or or
[17:41] anger or fear or or
[17:44] sadness you know different times
[17:46] different ways to wake up but brother
[17:48] Ram says that that's you know that's
[17:50] what God would do he would come down and
[17:51] kiss them good night
[17:53] I hope you enjoyed your day in my garden
[17:57] I love you my children can you imagine
[17:58] if you say that I love you Lydia
[18:02] and they would hear his voice sweep down
[18:04] then they would hear his voice leave
[18:07] good night Dad
[18:09] love you
[18:10] let's go to sleep
[18:14] come on Tigress let's lay down try to go
[18:16] to bed
[18:19] brother may have said now man was born
[18:21] to have Fellowship
[18:22] man in the beginning back in the Garden
[18:24] of Eden he had wonderful Fellowship
[18:26] God come down in Fellowship
[18:29] with his company of men and women every
[18:31] evening in the cool of an evening God
[18:33] would come down under the big palm trees
[18:35] perhaps his sacred light as it was
[18:37] shining down on Adam and Eve
[18:39] in that great Cathedral
[18:41] fellowship with God had nothing to worry
[18:43] about as long as they were
[18:45] fellowshipping
[18:47] now you can picture again they would
[18:49] just wait there they would sing and
[18:51] pretty soon they would see the pillar of
[18:52] fire come down the light of God
[18:54] kind of like the dove descended right
[18:56] the spirit of God descended like a dove
[18:57] real real gentle
[19:00] that's how they just sing there until
[19:03] Spirit up the living
[19:11] and they'd see him descended oh Father
[19:13] come to Father come to you
[19:16] and he whispered talk about the day
[19:20] little Ram said that's what God loved to
[19:22] do God loved to come down and that was
[19:24] the voice of God
[19:25] walking with them in the cool
[19:28] that's when God come down evening time
[19:31] praise God
[19:33] well bam says but I love fellowship with
[19:35] men I like to go out and talk with
[19:38] people who loves the Lord
[19:40] and have fellowship with them because we
[19:43] see the same thing
[19:45] our motives are the same our ideals are
[19:49] the same I like to like to talk with
[19:51] people
[19:52] he said men that hunt and fish many
[19:55] times we have Fellowship together just
[19:56] sitting and talking around those things
[19:58] because we like those things but the
[20:00] greatest Fellowship any man ever had was
[20:02] when he had fellowship with God
[20:05] when God had gave himself open to man to
[20:08] Fellowship back and forth with his
[20:10] creature the Creator and his creature
[20:13] and God was fellowshipping with Adam in
[20:15] the garden of Edom Adam had nothing to
[20:17] worry about everything was smooth and
[20:19] right he'd have to worry about his
[20:21] clothes he'd have to worry about
[20:22] something to eat he didn't have to worry
[20:24] about sickness he'd have to worry about
[20:25] death or sorrow
[20:27] he knew nothing about them just the
[20:29] freedom like a child isn't that how the
[20:31] kid isn't that why we love the kids
[20:32] they're not worried about you know
[20:34] supper
[20:36] hungry they'll worry about
[20:37] worry about it they're not worried about
[20:38] it they're not worried about paying the
[20:40] bills they're not worried about any of
[20:42] the stresses of Life they're just loving
[20:44] life
[20:45] like I said one time they just go from
[20:46] one playing event to the next playing
[20:48] event
[20:49] a child's life is like one adventure to
[20:51] the next adventure until they get tired
[20:54] and cranky right
[20:56] but he said that's what Adam and Eve had
[20:58] freedom
[21:00] Adam had a heavenly father who watched
[21:02] over him in fellowship with him every
[21:04] day would it be marvelous if we could
[21:07] get back like that again
[21:09] foreign
[21:12] but do you know every redeemed soul
[21:15] today that's living under their
[21:18] privileges of that kind of fellowship
[21:19] with God
[21:21] he said do you believe that God will
[21:23] take care and provide everything that we
[21:25] have need of in this journey
[21:30] and at the end of the close of this old
[21:32] Mortal Tabernacle God's promise to give
[21:35] us another one of these fellowships amen
[21:39] says we can live similar to Adam and Eve
[21:41] we don't have to live with anxiousness
[21:45] we don't have to live with stress and
[21:47] worry or fear he said we can have some
[21:49] sort of that type of Fellowship like
[21:51] that if we want to how many want to have
[21:53] that today praise God
[21:54] just have a fellowship with God where
[21:56] you just talk with God
[21:58] and you hear his voice you he or you
[22:01] feel his presence just confirm something
[22:03] back in your soul oh that's so special
[22:04] praise God just he's going to take care
[22:06] of me I've thought this this week
[22:08] numerous times and over the years
[22:10] I just felt like Lord if you could just
[22:12] show me the end of my life and you can
[22:15] just show me how long I'm going to live
[22:16] and then I wouldn't even you know I wish
[22:18] I could just see it so I wouldn't worry
[22:19] about these next I wouldn't worry about
[22:21] any year
[22:22] like it I always think this how would I
[22:24] act if I could see the end of my life
[22:26] and know how many years I mean how much
[22:29] peace would I have like let's say I was
[22:30] going to die at 98 brother you know
[22:32] I hope so
[22:35] I hope I'm late to my funeral too
[22:38] but like let's say that let's say I was
[22:39] going to live to 98. it would just do me
[22:41] so much good like I wouldn't worry about
[22:43] these next few years
[22:44] I'm 41.
[22:47] 1 you know some 57 almost 50 years
[22:50] you know how would I live if I if I just
[22:52] had some some consolation you know
[22:56] now that's just a human natural thought
[22:58] but really spiritually we already have a
[23:01] guarantee of eternal life
[23:03] we already have a guarantee that he'll
[23:06] never leave us nor forsake us
[23:08] and I say that you know I say that
[23:10] um because I desire that but I also
[23:12] believe I should live higher I should
[23:14] live like God is going to provide all my
[23:17] needs I have nothing to worry about
[23:18] praise God
[23:19] and even if I do come up a little short
[23:21] I still have Jesus praise God
[23:24] like I worry about I'm not gonna have
[23:25] enough to feed the children like enough
[23:27] am I ever going to run out you know and
[23:29] not be able to pay the bills I worry
[23:30] about things like that but really I
[23:33] shouldn't worry about things like that I
[23:35] should have a fellowship with the Lord
[23:37] and I should just have a constant
[23:39] talking with him like the Lord I know
[23:40] you'll provide and even if you you don't
[23:42] you'll bring me through that test you
[23:44] you'll just be testing my faith
[23:46] and and I'll come out better like job or
[23:49] some type or some type of way or another
[23:50] I know my testimony will glorify you
[23:54] I shouldn't worry right I shouldn't
[23:56] worry I should just have fellowship with
[23:58] the Lord
[24:02] he said God will take care and provide
[24:04] everything that we have need of in this
[24:06] journey
[24:06] he says now here's why John 5 24 very
[24:10] very saying to you he that heareth my
[24:12] word and believeth on him that sent me
[24:13] half everlasting life and shall not come
[24:17] into condemnation
[24:18] but his past from Death unto life
[24:22] how many believe that scripture speaking
[24:23] of you
[24:24] you will not come into condemnation
[24:26] you've already passed death and you've
[24:28] already come into life
[24:30] Hallelujah Romans 5 verse 1 therefore
[24:32] being justified by faith we have peace
[24:35] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[24:38] by whom also we have access by faith
[24:41] into this grace wherein we stand so we
[24:44] are standing in the grace of God how
[24:46] many believe you're standing in God's
[24:47] grace I'm not standing in God's Wrath
[24:49] I'm actually standing in God's grace
[24:52] and we rejoice in Hope of the glory of
[24:55] God Amen Hallelujah so we're standing in
[24:57] Grace hoping and trusting that we know
[25:00] God's word will be backed up praise God
[25:02] God will keep his word God's word cannot
[25:06] fail us amen
[25:08] Romans 8 1 and 2. there is therefore now
[25:10] no condemnation to them which are in
[25:13] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[25:15] flesh but after the spirit
[25:17] for the law of the spirit of life in
[25:19] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[25:22] law of sin and death praise God are you
[25:24] walking after the spirit tonight praise
[25:25] God that's why you're here you're here
[25:27] to follow God's holy spirit as spoken
[25:30] Through the Bible and also through the
[25:32] inspired words of a Preacher through the
[25:34] inspiration that we get through songs
[25:36] and music praise God Amen
[25:39] Hallelujah
[25:41] like there's times you know brother amen
[25:42] would sing that that one song of my door
[25:45] is shut my eyes are closed I'm on my
[25:47] knees and my hands are up that that song
[25:49] brother would be with me all week
[25:51] there are times you sang songs and
[25:53] they're with me all week praise God it
[25:55] is God what is it it's God talking with
[25:57] me it's God fellowshipping with me
[25:59] praise God
[26:01] and those songs you know keep me in his
[26:03] presence they keep me talking to him
[26:04] they keep me praising him praise God
[26:07] I think that's beautiful
[26:09] Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing
[26:12] but in everything by prayer and
[26:14] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[26:16] requests be made known unto God and the
[26:19] peace of God sometimes we need rehearse
[26:20] on these don't we
[26:22] which passes all understanding shall
[26:24] keep your hearts and Minds through
[26:25] Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever
[26:28] things are true whatsoever things are
[26:30] honest whatsoever things are just
[26:31] whatever things are pure whatsoever
[26:33] things are lovely whatsoever things of a
[26:36] good report if there be any virtue if
[26:37] there be any praise think on these
[26:40] things
[26:40] in other words don't think on evil
[26:42] things don't think on the the bad things
[26:44] that are going to happen think on the
[26:45] things God has already freely given us
[26:48] amen hallelujah
[26:50] that's my desire the Lord help me not to
[26:52] be anxious help me to be careful for
[26:55] nothing help me to cast all my cares
[26:57] upon you
[26:58] Hallelujah
[27:01] I want to get back to a quote here in
[27:03] the beginning man used to walk in the
[27:04] early age with God in the Garden of Eden
[27:08] he said under the palm trees he and his
[27:10] wife with the cool of the evening come
[27:11] along they come out and worship God had
[27:13] a perfect Fellowship now look when he
[27:14] brings the news off God Longs for
[27:17] Fellowship
[27:19] he yearns
[27:21] he wants people to speak with him
[27:24] talk with him
[27:26] how many of the married people know that
[27:28] you yearn for your your spouse
[27:30] that's the reason you got married you
[27:32] you didn't want to be alone
[27:34] you wanted somebody that would love you
[27:36] right
[27:37] so it is with God God yearns for
[27:40] Fellowship he wants brother says he
[27:42] wants people to speak with him to talk
[27:44] with him
[27:45] he says you might sing too much I know I
[27:47] preached too much he says you might
[27:48] preach too much I know I do sometimes
[27:50] but there's one thing you'll never be
[27:53] able to overdo that's praying
[27:55] because Paul said I would that men pray
[27:58] everywhere lifting up holy hands
[28:01] see God wants you to lift up hands on
[28:02] your job
[28:04] God wants you to lift up hands at the
[28:06] church at your home God wants you to
[28:08] lift up and pray to him everywhere the
[28:10] Bible said let's all say everywhere
[28:12] every everywhere everywhere God wants
[28:14] you to pray you'll never pray you'll
[28:16] never overdo prayer
[28:18] because God loves when you talk and you
[28:20] express your heart to him even when
[28:22] you're wrong like David David and
[28:24] Jeremiah those are great examples
[28:25] Jeremiah said I would curse today I read
[28:28] that last week Jeremiah said I cursed
[28:30] the day I was born
[28:31] but then later he gets the fire of God
[28:33] shut up in his bones he gets a fresh he
[28:35] gets a Revival amen hallelujah you get a
[28:39] Revival Hallelujah
[28:42] that Fellowship God brings out God
[28:44] brings us back to that Fellowship
[28:46] you'll never be able to have two too
[28:48] much fellowship with God God Longs for
[28:50] his creature who created her who he
[28:53] created in His image to Fellowship
[28:55] with him
[28:58] wouldn't it you love to have lived in
[29:00] the time of that Great Fellowship God
[29:01] had with Adam and Eve in the garden he'd
[29:04] come down in the cool of the evening and
[29:05] talk with them and fellowship with him
[29:06] wouldn't that be marvelous we would all
[29:08] like to have that time but now I Believe
[29:11] by God's word I can prove that you to
[29:14] you that we can come right back on them
[29:16] terms again with God tonight right
[29:18] straight back to that kind of fellowship
[29:20] and of course those are the scriptures
[29:21] I've already given to you right and the
[29:23] scriptures from this morning
[29:25] right the blood the death of Jesus
[29:28] Christ makes us holy
[29:31] uh unreprovable unrebutable in his sight
[29:35] praise God isn't that what Adam and Eve
[29:38] had they had no sin weren't they holy
[29:41] did they have any accusers no
[29:44] did they have any thoughts no so see the
[29:47] blood of Jesus Christ brings our souls
[29:49] that's what we've got to know our souls
[29:51] not our flesh so much and not yet we've
[29:52] got to get a new body but Jesus brings
[29:54] our souls back to that same condition
[29:56] amen hallelujah in other words you're
[30:00] you're your greatest longings your
[30:01] greatest desires your very nature your
[30:04] your God nature that Holy Spirit nature
[30:07] that nature having fellowship with God
[30:09] it's just like the Garden of Eden again
[30:14] that's what I I think that's what every
[30:15] Christian knows that's what I know
[30:17] that's what you know when we have our
[30:18] most sincere prayers to God
[30:22] and we express the very deepest desire
[30:25] of our souls that's the same Fellowship
[30:28] that Adam and Eve had with God
[30:30] it has to be because it's God's nature
[30:31] in US communing with God
[30:35] right it's that it's the spiritual Gene
[30:37] seed that I am of God the spiritual part
[30:40] that I am of God you'll think about All
[30:41] God's Children I'm one of those seeds
[30:43] I'm one of those you are one of those
[30:45] Genesis of God but it's that it's that
[30:47] attribute of God having fellowship with
[30:49] his father
[30:52] and when we come to that spout when it's
[30:54] our souls fellowshipping with God
[30:57] then we're back to the Garden of Edom by
[30:59] the grace of God that's what brother man
[31:01] tells us he said I can prove to you by
[31:03] God's word we can have that same
[31:06] Fellowship
[31:07] here tonight praise God isn't that
[31:08] beautiful Hallelujah
[31:12] he says you do good deeds because you're
[31:14] a Believer but that but that uh but that
[31:17] doesn't do it by Good Deeds joining
[31:18] church is all right but that isn't what
[31:20] does it
[31:22] he says it's when you recognize you're a
[31:25] sinner lost and the only way God can see
[31:27] you righteous is through the blood of
[31:28] Jesus Christ
[31:30] and they said let me give you a
[31:31] scripture for this fellowship if you
[31:33] abide in me and my word in you you ask
[31:35] what you will and it shall be done unto
[31:37] you brother Adam said there's the secret
[31:39] of it there's a secret of the great life
[31:42] that's hid away in God see that knows no
[31:45] fear whether it's stormy whether the
[31:47] clouds are over or whether the moon's
[31:49] not shining or the sun's not shining
[31:51] they're still living in the Shekinah
[31:52] Glory there you are the
[31:56] so abiding Christ abiding in his
[31:59] promises
[32:00] as we said confessing your sins and
[32:02] knowing that once you confess them
[32:04] you're holy unreprovable unrebutable in
[32:07] his sight that's the same Fellowship
[32:09] Adam and Eve had in the beginning and
[32:11] church we can have the baptism the Holy
[32:13] Ghost in our souls they can never have
[32:14] it
[32:15] Adam and Eve could never have it but we
[32:17] can have something they never had now
[32:19] they had something we never had we never
[32:21] had a sinless state but we could have
[32:22] something they never had amen hallelujah
[32:25] so don't yeah I mean it's good it's okay
[32:27] it's okay to have Godly jealousy Paul
[32:29] says that I'm jealous over you with
[32:31] Godly jealousy right
[32:33] so it's okay to have some Godly jealousy
[32:35] but church we can have something that
[32:36] Adam never had praise God
[32:39] True Fellowship of the Soul where Christ
[32:42] lives in US praise God hallelujah
[32:46] he abides in our souls Christ in us the
[32:50] hope of glory
[32:52] Hallelujah Abraham said that's the
[32:54] secret of it that's the secret of it
[32:56] abide in me and my words abide in you
[32:59] confessing your sins first John 1 7 can
[33:02] you put up their Malachi if we walk in
[33:04] the light as he's in the light we have
[33:06] Fellowship one with another and the
[33:08] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[33:11] us from all sin
[33:13] just timeless timeless
[33:17] the blood of Jesus Christ gives us this
[33:20] Fellowship in the cool of the evening
[33:24] you know last last week I mentioned how
[33:26] God doesn't need anything on a Wednesday
[33:27] night remember that it's of Acts 17 God
[33:30] has need of nothing God doesn't need
[33:32] anything
[33:34] to exist he's just going to always exist
[33:36] he's always Eternal there's my half hour
[33:41] God doesn't need anything to exist
[33:43] according to acts 17. but he does have
[33:47] desires
[33:48] right the Bible said he would that all
[33:50] men be saved although we know not all
[33:52] men will be saved very few will be saved
[33:55] the Bible said God in Ezekiel 33 God
[33:57] does not Delight in the death of the
[33:58] wicked so God desires that they wouldn't
[34:01] be lost
[34:03] and the Bible said in Genesis 6 God's
[34:05] heart strove with men it was striving
[34:07] with men that they'd be saved that
[34:09] they'd that they'd instead of always
[34:11] imagining evil they would actually
[34:13] imagine the blessings of God and the
[34:15] righteousness of God
[34:16] and the Holiness Noah is preaching God
[34:19] was striving with them won't you accept
[34:20] my Prophet won't you accept won't you
[34:22] accept it God was striving with them
[34:25] so this statement is true God needs
[34:27] nothing but God does have desires
[34:33] your brother Adam said God Longs for our
[34:35] fellowship
[34:39] now here I want to read this quote
[34:40] brother remember gives us a different
[34:41] perspective about God coming down in
[34:44] Genesis 3 8 and 9 after the sin program
[34:48] gives us a different perspective I don't
[34:49] know if you've heard this before maybe
[34:51] he said God loves The Fellowship of this
[34:53] creature in the Garden of Eden we're
[34:55] told that when man walked in the
[34:57] uprightness of God God came down the
[34:58] cool of the evening and fellowship with
[34:59] his children but then one day a voice
[35:02] came up in the presence of God said your
[35:04] loved ones your children has fallen and
[35:06] they've sinned and have did that which
[35:08] was wrong
[35:09] so one day God of course God knew it was
[35:11] going to happen
[35:12] but one day that announcement came from
[35:14] the angels
[35:16] your children have fallen Adam and Eve
[35:18] have fallen and sinned
[35:20] and of course that would have been you
[35:22] know maybe the middle of the day the
[35:23] heat of the day
[35:25] well the ram said God didn't select some
[35:28] Angel to go down and look it over
[35:30] to see if it was so or not or a certain
[35:32] cherubim of the heavens
[35:34] he said but God came himself crying out
[35:37] Adam Where Art Thou
[35:40] God himself come down crying for his
[35:43] lost children
[35:44] so see we just read it we think God's
[35:46] like where are you Adam but man said he
[35:48] come down and cried Adam where are you
[35:50] now think about that God's spirit came
[35:52] down was walking he come up to have
[35:54] fellowship and his kids weren't there
[35:57] see that
[35:58] he come down oh he said uh he of course
[36:01] you know we know God was just you know
[36:04] putting on that right just like Jesus
[36:06] would put on that he was going to leave
[36:07] his disciples in Luke 24. but God came
[36:09] down to show his love for Adam and Eve
[36:11] he come down crying Adam where are you
[36:14] add where's my child don't you want to
[36:16] have Fellowship you come down to show
[36:18] Adam and Eve that he so much cared about
[36:20] you didn't send the angel after them he
[36:23] came himself
[36:24] he wanted to show them I love you and I
[36:26] miss your fellowship he's crying where
[36:28] are you where are you where are you
[36:30] that's how it is sometimes when people
[36:31] will leave our church like I'll just cry
[36:33] like when a Brother's leaves or sister
[36:35] leaves a church I'll just weep and cry I
[36:37] just miss their Fellowship
[36:39] wow what have I done like I'll search my
[36:41] heart sometimes I'll have trouble
[36:43] sleeping at night when people leave like
[36:45] what have I done where did I and my wife
[36:46] have to assure me no Jesse you preach
[36:48] the truth they just they don't want to
[36:50] obey the Bible and come to find out
[36:51] later that's usually what it is
[36:54] but that's the spirit of Christ in you
[36:56] you want to go out and you want to bring
[36:58] the lost one back
[37:01] and that's what God did I missed that
[37:03] Fellowship I missed fellowshipping with
[37:04] these brothers and sisters that you know
[37:06] that they just leave us we miss that
[37:09] because we at one time we had everything
[37:11] in common
[37:13] and we love talking about the things of
[37:14] God but in times sin got in there
[37:17] brother Masters the only thing that
[37:18] breaks Fellowship is sin the only way to
[37:20] get it back is the blood of Jesus Amen
[37:23] Hallelujah
[37:26] so it's God's love that came in and he
[37:28] was crying Adam where are you
[37:30] Eve where are you my daughter my son
[37:33] where are you of course he knew but he
[37:35] wanted his children to know that he
[37:38] missed the fellowship now Church don't
[37:39] you know God misses our fellowship but
[37:41] we don't fellowship with him
[37:43] does God understand of course
[37:45] God understands you know Wednesday night
[37:47] I preached so hard and we Fellowship so
[37:49] long
[37:50] I woke up and I didn't have a chance to
[37:52] read my Bible and pray and all day in my
[37:54] heart I didn't feel condemned
[37:57] felt empty like
[37:59] that
[38:03] because I made sure you know that on
[38:04] Friday morning I had that time with them
[38:06] all
[38:07] I miss talking with my father praise God
[38:11] so we want to
[38:12] remember that that God
[38:15] and that's what I wanted to be I want to
[38:16] be where I'm not condemned if I miss
[38:18] Fellowship
[38:19] but I'm sad
[38:22] because I missed I knew God's spirit
[38:24] would come down and meet me there when I
[38:25] missed that time with the moment I was
[38:28] so looking forward just having that time
[38:29] and if I don't get that time with the
[38:31] Lord I'm sad about it
[38:34] like the Bible says the next day I need
[38:36] to make my calling and elections sure
[38:39] and make sure I have that fellowship
[38:40] with my Lord with my father
[38:43] if not Church we're going to get into
[38:45] bad habits right and and habits are what
[38:47] evil spirits bad habits are evil spirit
[38:49] good habits are the Holy Spirit bad
[38:51] habits are the evil spirits
[38:55] LeBron says again in Fellowship 1960.
[38:59] he said uh
[39:01] he said Adam and Eve would come up and
[39:03] they would worship God they would have
[39:05] fellowship and commune one with another
[39:06] that's the very thing that caused us
[39:08] together like this he's talking to talk
[39:10] about the church in Middletown Ohio
[39:12] setting together in Heavenly places in
[39:14] Christ Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy
[39:16] Spirit no difference in us we're all one
[39:19] in Christ Jesus in that Perfect Harmony
[39:22] of Fellowship there's nothing like it
[39:24] I've ever found on Earth
[39:27] hallelujah it's to come together in
[39:29] Heavenly places and have communion
[39:31] fellowship with god with each other now
[39:33] that's what God intended in the Garden
[39:36] of Eden Hallelujah Church isn't that how
[39:39] you you know I saw how I look at brother
[39:40] William you know we get like six months
[39:42] with him like the last two years we get
[39:44] six months but that's how I see I don't
[39:45] see any difference between him and I
[39:47] because we're all one in Christ Jesus
[39:50] Jesus died for him just like Jesus died
[39:52] for me and I love when we can have
[39:54] fellowship and we can talk about things
[39:55] that we agree on right that's how we
[39:58] love it with all of each other's all of
[40:00] our all of our fellowship when we talk
[40:02] about things that we agree on the Bible
[40:04] says it's Heavenly places in Christ
[40:06] Jesus
[40:08] when God is speaking to us when God is
[40:11] using gifts in our lives to help one
[40:14] another to strengthen one another that
[40:16] is fellowship in Heavenly places we're
[40:18] experiencing the very highest blessings
[40:20] the very highest form of existence we're
[40:24] experiencing it when God is hearing our
[40:26] prayers and answering our requests right
[40:28] here praise God
[40:30] you know it I know it
[40:33] when we try to fellowship with worldly
[40:34] people it's just not the same
[40:36] right but we can fellowship with God's
[40:39] people around the truth of this message
[40:41] this Bible truth there's no greater
[40:43] Fellowship than that praise God
[40:45] Hallelujah
[40:47] like today even with you know communion
[40:49] with Austin and Jose you know we just
[40:51] got to praying and fellowshiping and
[40:53] we're all three of us crying there and
[40:55] I'm just I'm just holding their necks
[40:56] like this I'm like there's no better
[40:57] Fellowship
[40:58] they're just dealing with God's people
[41:01] that we're we're trusting in the blood
[41:03] we're all Sinners we all fall short of
[41:05] God God's glory but in our souls we're
[41:07] not sinners in our souls we're redeemed
[41:10] sons of God in our souls
[41:12] and we can have that the same Fellowship
[41:14] that Adam and Eve had in our souls
[41:18] that the Bible says the spirit Bears
[41:20] witness with our spirit that we are the
[41:22] sons of God
[41:23] think about it while the world they're
[41:25] out in the bars tonight or they're out
[41:26] shopping at Costco you know which is
[41:28] okay I guess you know but you know
[41:30] they're
[41:31] they're at the bar watching the Browns
[41:33] make sure the Browns win devoting three
[41:34] hours to the Browns and here today we've
[41:36] wrote a six eight hours to the Lord
[41:38] Jesus Christ what a blessing amen and
[41:40] what a fellowship what a joy Divine
[41:42] leaning on the Everlasting
[41:44] on this is real Fellowship in Heavenly
[41:46] places praise God
[41:48] let me share this I know my sister
[41:49] listens to I talked to my sister
[41:51] yesterday but you know Emma was with us
[41:53] for two weeks
[41:56] and she had told us the other night you
[41:58] know every night we the cool of the
[42:00] evening every night in the cool team we
[42:01] gather together for Bible time now I
[42:03] told everybody amen some of those nights
[42:04] I'm really tired I feel cranky
[42:07] not every night but some of those nights
[42:09] because I'm exhausted
[42:10] preaching teaching yelling all day you
[42:12] know preaching
[42:14] but
[42:15] you know after two weeks Emma just
[42:18] announced in front of everybody these
[42:20] are my favorite times of the day this is
[42:22] my favorite time of the day
[42:25] you remember that she said that like I
[42:27] didn't even have nobody cursed nobody
[42:28] asked her to say that she just announces
[42:30] these are the best times because we're
[42:31] laughing we're talking the girls are
[42:33] hugging on our little ones they're all
[42:35] kind of arguing who gets to hug him but
[42:37] you know
[42:38] yeah
[42:39] that's what I love about God that
[42:40] everybody can hug on God when we have
[42:42] fellowship at church here when Jesus
[42:43] comes we can all fellowship with him
[42:45] praise God amen doesn't have all of them
[42:47] Lydia doesn't we all can hug on Jesus I
[42:50] don't have all of Jesus we can all have
[42:51] Jesus amen
[42:53] I thought that was so special
[42:55] and she just told me yesterday she said
[42:57] you know what I want for my life brother
[42:59] or Uncle Jesse I was like no she's like
[43:00] I want to have eight kids and have a
[43:02] family like this
[43:04] that really blessed my heart you know
[43:07] really eight kids
[43:09] I said just be careful Emma a lot of it
[43:12] falls on love
[43:14] Dad gets a you know leave unless he's a
[43:16] farmer you know works from home on his
[43:18] computer
[43:19] which I wish I could do that
[43:21] I enjoyed that when we had that covered
[43:23] time that was a really good
[43:25] but yeah I thought was so special you
[43:27] know evening time when everybody gathers
[43:29] together that's just like Adam and Eve
[43:31] adamy would gather and I pray worship
[43:34] all the animals come all their all their
[43:36] animal children you know they'd come in
[43:38] they'd all just rejoice and sing before
[43:40] God
[43:42] we're so special that Emma could come to
[43:44] our house and she can feel the prince of
[43:46] God come down and just enjoy talking
[43:48] enjoy laughing enjoy singing asking
[43:51] questions about the Bible worshiping the
[43:53] Lord
[43:56] there's something in us that desires
[43:58] that
[44:01] I thought it was beautiful that our
[44:02] sister you know felt that same thing
[44:05] there's nothing like it I've ever found
[44:08] on Earth program since then
[44:09] fellowshipping with God's children
[44:13] where we all agree on the word of God we
[44:16] all love Jesus Christ we're all here for
[44:17] one purpose to go
[44:19] to Jesus
[44:21] to serve our heavenly father
[44:27] he says uh in my time of fellowship and
[44:30] communion that's where God speaks to me
[44:32] that's the way we want to get in the
[44:35] spirit of it
[44:36] he says do you like to pray through and
[44:39] get in the spirit brother Ram ask that
[44:41] that's the only way you can do it shut
[44:43] yourself off from the rest of the world
[44:45] and get along with God that's the reason
[44:47] that you like to do that because the
[44:49] first couple came on Earth Adam and Eve
[44:52] it's what they
[44:54] now notice brother Adam said getting a
[44:57] loan in fellowship with God but he
[44:58] included Adam and Eve when they
[45:00] Fellowship they weren't alone
[45:02] right it just wasn't Adam fellowshiping
[45:04] with God it was Adam and Eve
[45:07] but the reason church we like to get
[45:08] along with God and we like to sing and
[45:10] worship and get in the spirit is because
[45:12] that's what our parents did in the very
[45:15] beginning
[45:15] that's the reason we love evening time
[45:17] Fellowship that's the reason we love
[45:19] evening time communion because Adam and
[45:21] Eve and God used to do that
[45:23] that's the way God would come down he
[45:25] let them you know work all day or play
[45:27] all day
[45:29] but then he would before they went to
[45:30] bed he would come down
[45:33] and he would receive their worship he
[45:35] would talk with them ask them about
[45:36] their day kiss them on the cheek
[45:39] and then he would go back his Spirit
[45:41] would go back to Heaven as a pillar of
[45:42] Fire
[45:43] that's why we love the evening times
[45:48] Hallelujah he says God made one
[45:50] preparation for man to be restored back
[45:52] to fellowship blood was the way back for
[45:56] Fellowship
[45:57] Hallelujah
[45:59] said did you notice God come down the
[46:01] cool of the day the setting of the Sun
[46:04] there's something about when it starts
[46:06] to get night people think of church and
[46:09] of God and Christians
[46:12] you see the sun setting you realize that
[46:16] your son is said
[46:20] and in the cool of the evening he'd come
[46:21] down and commune with them and there he
[46:24] lost that Fellowship because sin would
[46:26] not let him do it and then he was made
[46:28] flesh and dwell Among Us in order that
[46:30] he could come back again to man and live
[46:33] in man and restore man to that state of
[46:34] communion with them again and give him
[46:37] back his god-given right that's what he
[46:41] did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[46:43] so now we're getting back to the Holy
[46:44] Ghost our fellowship I'm almost done
[46:46] here
[46:48] it's the father again God the Father
[46:50] dwelling in you working out his plans to
[46:53] finish his Plan of Redemption working
[46:56] through you making you a co-worker with
[46:58] him giving you a place giving you a part
[47:01] for your Fallen lost brother sister
[47:03] giving you his spirit and his love to go
[47:07] hunt The Lost Ones as he did in the
[47:09] Garden of Eden
[47:13] Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's what the
[47:15] Holy Spirit does to a man or woman when
[47:18] it strikes into their heart and takes a
[47:20] bow there's a thirst and a hunger for
[47:22] lost souls remember last Sunday we
[47:23] prayed for lost souls that's a wonderful
[47:25] service wasn't it
[47:26] pray for lost souls prayed for Revival
[47:30] he says that's what the Holy Ghost is
[47:32] there for in you to go after The Lost
[47:34] Ones to pray for the lost ones that's
[47:37] fellowshipping with God
[47:39] he said there's a hunger and thirst for
[47:41] lost souls that's what the that's what's
[47:43] the matter with meetings today there's
[47:44] not enough Spirit touching it to go for
[47:46] the lost and the dying it's more of a
[47:49] make a name or a church or a building or
[47:51] a denomination instead of a soul-winning
[47:54] program how pitiful he said we could
[47:56] stay on it much
[47:59] so I just thought you'd like that quote
[48:00] that was a beautiful quote
[48:02] the reason we like evening Services is
[48:05] because it reminds us our lives are
[48:07] going to have a setting to them one day
[48:10] and we are assured at the end of that
[48:11] we'll go to see Jesus praise God when
[48:14] our day closes we'll have a new day
[48:16] we'll have eternal life praise God a new
[48:19] body and now the holy spirit is in us
[48:21] today to try to go after lost souls
[48:24] that's why I love when you know Nina
[48:25] will come up for prayer for her family
[48:27] or her sister how many times have we
[48:28] prayed for your family just in tears
[48:30] right you know like last week got the
[48:31] prep here for Wesley in tears you know
[48:33] we got to pray up here for different
[48:34] ones I was crying for my dad
[48:37] you know that is eternal life in you
[48:39] that's you having fellowship with God
[48:41] that's you feeling what God felt when
[48:43] Adam and Eve were lost praise God
[48:46] and so you feel that same Fellowship
[48:48] that God had I want the fellowship back
[48:51] and when you desire to see your lost
[48:53] ones come in that's the same thing God
[48:54] desires for all those lost ones to come
[48:56] back it's the heart of God it's the
[48:58] heart of Christ amen it's the desire
[49:00] it's the longing of God you're longing
[49:02] for their Fellowship amen you're longing
[49:04] for real fellowship with them when they
[49:06] can Fellowship on the truth of God's
[49:08] word praise God when you can fellowship
[49:10] and agree on everything and you don't
[49:12] have to avoid talking about Jesus so I
[49:14] long for that day amen when I don't have
[49:17] to be the one to bring up Jesus with my
[49:19] dad you know or I'm not I don't have to
[49:21] be the one to bring up Jesus or the
[49:22] message with my mom or something or my
[49:25] mother-in-law or whoever may be but
[49:27] God's spirit can grab a hold of them if
[49:28] it be God's will amen hallelujah if God
[49:31] will answer my prayers if it's the will
[49:32] of God where they'll want to bring up
[49:34] the message they don't want to bring up
[49:36] the truth they'll win a fellowship then
[49:37] we can have real Fellowship then we can
[49:39] have a real conversation we can enjoy we
[49:42] can be in one Accord that's what God
[49:44] desires one Accord intimacy and that's
[49:46] what it means intimacy praise God
[49:50] Hallelujah
[49:52] so these evening Services remind us of
[49:54] Fellowship
[49:56] God's fellowship with his children
[49:58] praise God
[49:59] and I was reminded of Wednesday night's
[50:01] sermon Ephesians 3 9 to make all men see
[50:03] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[50:06] so Paul says the Revelation come to show
[50:09] us the fellowship what is the fellowship
[50:11] it's the intimacy of the mystery it's
[50:13] knowing god and making him known
[50:15] that is the fellowship we know God is
[50:17] not three persons we know God is one
[50:19] person praise God we know Jesus is God
[50:24] and our desire is to make all men see
[50:28] the intimacy or the personal
[50:30] relationship of this mystery of Christ
[50:33] in them the hope of glory
[50:37] now is there a part of suffering yes
[50:39] Philippians 3 10 to know him and the
[50:41] fellowship of his sufferings
[50:43] so part of Fellowship will mean
[50:45] suffering for Christ
[50:47] but part of the fellowship is also
[50:49] intimacy of his love the power of his
[50:52] resurrection we don't want a part of
[50:54] Jesus we want all of Jesus
[50:57] we want the suffering we want the power
[50:59] of the Resurrection we want the
[51:00] revelation we want fruits of the spirit
[51:02] we want all the fellowship Jesus has we
[51:05] want all of it part of it's going to be
[51:07] suffering The Fellowship of his
[51:09] sufferings
[51:12] yeah I'm almost done
[51:14] we read in Colossians 1 21 keep it up
[51:16] there Malachi
[51:17] the Bible said you were sometimes
[51:19] alienated the word alien in the Greek I
[51:21] just forgot to look it up this morning
[51:23] it means shut out a fellowship
[51:26] you were an alien you had no fellowship
[51:29] and you were shut out like Adam and Eve
[51:31] were shut out of the garden
[51:33] they were aliens now to the prince of
[51:35] God but Jesus when he when he took the
[51:38] veil the Bible said God rent The Veil
[51:40] from top to bottom you're no longer an
[51:42] alien come on into Fellowship he's
[51:44] saying come on in you can have an
[51:46] intimate walk you can hear my voice you
[51:48] can follow my leading praise God you can
[51:50] know my will you can know my heart
[51:52] praise God
[51:53] you know my heart
[51:55] my heart longs for other people to be as
[51:57] well
[51:59] you are not an alien
[52:01] you are not out of Fellowship as long as
[52:03] you confess your sin you have Fellowship
[52:05] you have intimacy with god oh it's a
[52:08] beautiful promise beautiful promise
[52:10] brother Ram gives a prayer for a sinner
[52:12] now look look how he prays
[52:16] he said if you've never accepted Christ
[52:17] say this I want to accept him now and be
[52:20] meek and gentle all my life
[52:22] instead of being angry and harsh and
[52:25] bitter
[52:26] that the Holy Spirit would talk to me in
[52:28] the cool of the evening when I lay down
[52:30] my pillow at night
[52:32] I raised up my hands to him now when was
[52:34] the last time you did this church on
[52:35] your pillow you're on your pillow and
[52:36] you raise your hand up
[52:39] and say dear heavenly father I so love
[52:42] you
[52:42] and to hear His Kind tender voice
[52:44] talking back to me and say child I'm so
[52:48] in love with you
[52:51] but remember I said that's what the
[52:52] whole the holy spirit will tell you I'm
[52:54] so in love with you
[52:57] I'm glad that you accepted me I wanted
[53:00] to love you so much when you were
[53:01] unlovable
[53:04] but you wouldn't let me love you but now
[53:06] you've made it right and I can love you
[53:08] and we can be friends together brother
[53:11] man says don't you want to do that
[53:14] isn't that beautiful I just thought that
[53:16] was so special
[53:17] in the cool of the evening you lay down
[53:19] I love you Lord and Jesus says I'm so in
[53:22] love with you brother sister I'm so in
[53:25] love with you you're my friend I am so
[53:27] glad we're no longer enemies we are now
[53:29] family
[53:31] that's what God would speak to us in the
[53:32] evening time
[53:34] that's why I love that song
[53:37] you take me just as I am you know what's
[53:39] the name
[53:40] the one you love
[53:41] that's why I love that song it's to me
[53:43] it's all about the joy of salvation
[53:45] God's proud of me God loves me he's so
[53:48] in love with me that's what the quote
[53:50] says so here's one time I can say let's
[53:51] say what the tape say right God is in
[53:54] love with us praise God God he's so in
[53:56] love with us he's so glad we opened our
[53:58] hearts to him
[53:59] he just wants to have this fellowship
[54:01] with him this communion with him
[54:04] and last uh
[54:07] that scripture uh John 17 24.
[54:14] little man said Jesus only asked for one
[54:16] thing in his prayer to the father you
[54:18] know what it was one thing after all of
[54:20] his sacrifice all he did here on Earth
[54:22] the life that he lived the path that he
[54:24] walked he asked for one thing that where
[54:27] I am they may be also he asked for our
[54:31] fellowship I'm sure brother Williams
[54:32] heard this hundreds of times throughout
[54:33] the years right things that are to be
[54:35] 1965.
[54:37] let's look at Jesus prayer father I will
[54:39] that they also whom thou has given me be
[54:42] with me where I am
[54:44] that I may be whole that they may behold
[54:47] my glory which thou has given me for
[54:49] thou loveth me before the foundation of
[54:52] the world so just leave that up there
[54:54] I'm praying
[54:56] that those you've given me can be with
[54:59] me where I am
[55:00] see Jesus knew he had a place Jesus Knew
[55:03] by God's promise he had a certain place
[55:05] he was going to be ruler of the world
[55:07] praise God
[55:08] he's going to rule the world with a rod
[55:09] of iron but his prayer was his father
[55:10] let those that you've given me let them
[55:13] be with me so I'm not alone let me have
[55:15] a bride amen that's my prayer my prayers
[55:19] let me have fellowship with this group
[55:20] that loves me let me have this
[55:22] fellowship with this group that you saw
[55:24] in your mind before the foundation of
[55:25] the world that you'd wash in their blood
[55:27] you'd make them holy unrebutable praise
[55:30] God unrebrewable praise God no faults no
[55:33] accusers this Blood wash group let them
[55:36] be with me where I am praise God
[55:39] Jesus was asking that you could be with
[55:41] him
[55:42] in eternity how many grateful for that
[55:45] and then he prayed for you in verse 20.
[55:47] neither pray I for these alone but for
[55:49] them also which Shall Believe on me
[55:51] through their word
[55:52] so not only did he pray for your
[55:54] fellowship he prayed that that by that
[55:56] you would hear the word of God and
[55:58] respond to the word of God
[56:00] all as I am Church all we are is an
[56:02] answer to Jesus prayer
[56:04] and our fellowship also with Christ is
[56:07] an answer to his requests as well
[56:09] praise God let's stay in our feet
[56:12] as the musicians are coming here we'll
[56:14] just sing a song and then we'll get
[56:15] ready for communion
[56:17] remember Christ The Mystery of God
[56:18] revealed brother Adam said there's
[56:19] threefold purpose to
[56:21] uh to Christ right
[56:23] preeminence God wanted preeminence in
[56:26] Jesus first second God pray one in
[56:29] preeminence in his church
[56:31] and third God would bring his children
[56:33] back
[56:34] to the Garden of Eating conditions and
[56:37] brother Adam said he said it a different
[56:38] way he said it thirdly to restore the
[56:40] kingdom to its rightly position
[56:43] that fell by sin by the first Adam back
[56:45] to where he walked in the cool of the
[56:47] evening with his people talk with them
[56:49] fellowship with them
[56:52] so after God gets preeminence in the
[56:54] bride we'll go back in the Millennium
[56:56] and also the future home we'll go back
[56:59] to the cool of the evening Fellowship
[57:03] where we can all gather together
[57:06] we can have the animals with us and the
[57:08] holy animals
[57:09] Hallelujah but none of that we'll have
[57:12] holy Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[57:13] Jesus
[57:15] and we'll all gather together and Christ
[57:17] will come down and meet with us in the
[57:19] cool of the eating we can have perfect
[57:21] Fellowship again
