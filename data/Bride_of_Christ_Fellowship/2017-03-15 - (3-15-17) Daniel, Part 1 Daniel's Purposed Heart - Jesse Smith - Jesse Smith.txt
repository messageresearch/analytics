let's go to Daniel chapter one I've been looking at uh doing a series on the Book of Daniel you know it's only 12 chapters so I'd like to start a series on that tonight Daniel chapter 1 we'll go to verse one by God's grace so we're going to keep doing the church ages we'll probably look at them on Sunday by God's grace but I like to do a couple different thoughts at the same time I'm still looking at the the the proof of God series I did one on that and i' been studying on that too and just waiting for the inspiration you know for each message and uh studying on that by God's grace but I want to go to Daniel chapter 1 tonight and we'll look at a purposed heart tonight that's a little subtitle Daniel chapter 1 a purposed heart Daniel's heart was purposed to obey the word of the Lord so we want to look at that that great attribute of that great man of God in Daniel chapter one I'm really uh quite inspired I think I've been looking at this for a few weeks want to look at Daniel um but I really I'm really inspired to go to the prophetic part at the end of the book like chapter 78 8 9 10 11 and 12 I really want to I want to just build my way up there by God's grace so we can get a good picture of the whole chapter and as we're working with of course Revelation I believe it all tied together by God's grace So Daniel chapter 1 we just um we'll just read uh well I said verse one but let's go to verse eight let's just read one verse tonight I want to just focus on verse eight well when we start preaching preach 1 through eight but I want to just read eight now the word purpose means directed or set upon So Daniel directed in his heart so he had a direction he had a he he had a goal he knew what he was doing in verse eight let's read this together just verse eight 1 two 3 but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself amen praise God how many want to keep themselves pure praise God and stay stay from being defiled amen let's just bow our heads on your heart just make it known unto God as we pray heavenly father as your Prophet said we are in the midst of a modern Babylon Daniel was here in physical Babylon but Lord we're in the midst of uh literal Babylon Lord a modern Babylon an age of Destruction and confusion and perversion and father we want to look at Daniel's life and we want to look at all the prophetic Lord but we want to look at his holy life Lord his purpose Heart Lord for that will mean a lot to us I believe as this series goes on we thank you Lord for this word that we've read help us to purpose in our hearts that we won't be defiled with anything from the world Grant it Lord Jesus as we give you glory tonight and help us to preach this Thy word help us all to believe your word with all of our hearts in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen God bless you to being seated praise God i' like to take this thought here tonight A A purposed heart we'll look at Daniel Mali I have a few slides here so you're ready bu can flip over so um I'll just show a little bit of a timeline I want to kind of do a little back background on Daniel tonight and preach maybe those first eight verses or so I think you'll be blessed and I got some quotes from brother brandom and everything like that so let's just start there I just found this one on the internet I like that one Daniel's kind of like telling him no we don't want the Kings meet you know so uh purpose heart uh let's look at Daniel here tonight so let's do a little background here on Daniel I'm going to read a little bit from the scoffield background here so they have like you know they have summaries you know before each book so I'm going to read a little bit out of here to get a little background on Daniel and let me uh while you're you know while I'm reading this let me skip ahead to here so you get an idea where we are in history okay so this is of course when Christ was born uh getting an idea this is where Solomon was Solomon was ruling about a thousand BC and so Daniel's born about 623 BC if my math is right because um the history says in 607 he was taken into Babylon at 16 years old that's that's what one historical article I said so um I just trust those guys and if they're they're probably not if they're wrong they're probably not too wrong they're probably pretty close because they've done a lot they've done their homework um so I just want to while you're looking at that I just like to read this here Daniel was like Ezekiel and was a Jewish captive in Babylon so Ezekiel was in the same spot he was in a different spot uh but still a captive Daniel was of royal or princely descent as we'll see so he he was of a family a rich family we'd say he was in a highly respected royal family so he wasn't some he wasn't a poor person or he wasn't a beggar or anything like that he was raised in we'd say wealth and privilege uh he was living a privileged life for his Rank and his comeliness he was trained for Palace service okay so when Babylon brought him over they knew he was a royal family and because he would lived such a maybe a blessed life they wanted to train him to be a servant in the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar now it says in the polluted atmosphere of an oriental Court he lived a life of singular piety or Holiness and separateness and usefulness so he's very holy and he's very useful to his employer don't you want to be like that don't you want your boss or your employer look at you and say my they're very useful to me because they they're so obedient they do exactly what I asked them to do he was a very good worker his long life extended from Nebuchadnezzar all the way to Cyrus he was a contemporary of Jeremiah so at the same time contemporary means ministering at the same time so while Daniel was uh serving right there in Babylon these men of God were also during his lifetime ministering which were Jeremiah just in different location Ezekiel and then Joshua the high priest of the restoration Ezra and zerubabel so Daniel during Daniel's Ministry in Babylon uh there was a revival going on in Israel they were rebuilding the temple under zerubabel and Nehemiah they're real reestablishing that so this also gives us courage to know that while God is blessing the Revival in Israel God's still with Daniel praise God Daniel no matter where you are Church no matter where you find yourself all alone or with the big crowd the big church or the small Church no matter where you find yourself God is with anybody who serves him amen anybody that will love him and keep his commands God will be with him Hallelujah so we see that it's all about the same time here now it says Daniel is distinctively the prophet of the times of the Gentiles so if you got your Bible let's go to Luke 21:24 I don't have it up there but uh I'll just I want you to see it Luke 21:24 some of you are familiar with this uh but let's read that Luke 21:24 I'll get it in my Bible he's the prophet of the times of the Gentiles and how many know we're still in the times of Gentiles amen right now we're still in the times of the Gentiles Gentiles have Grace Gentiles are grasped into the life of God the tree of God and and we're what not what what's now is growing is the bride tree praise God the Bride of Jesus Christ the Gentile bride she's gra that Branch was grafted in now she's becoming a a mature tree praise God looking to the coming of the Lord amen now verse 24 okay let's read 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled now let's back up to verse 20 can we just go to chapter 21 verse 20 let's back up a little bit now remember what did Jesus just say Jesus said that Israel would be carried away captive again right and they were they were again spread by who does anybody remember by Titus remember in 87 8070 Titus uh came to Jerusalem he destroyed the temple blood ran out of the temple like a river they said uh so many killings in there because they rejected their Messiah and so Jesus connects uh this this event here and he connects it to the times of the Gentiles let's go to verse 20 when you shall Jerusalem compass with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nine that was the armies of Titus of course then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter there into so don't come back into Jerusalem because uh Rome's going to take over verse 22 for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled W but woe unto them that are with child and them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people praise God then we get to the scripture we just read and they shall fall by the edge of the sword speaking of Israel and shall be led away captive in all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles into the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled okay praise God so I think everybody can see that uh by God's grace So Daniel is the prophet to the times of the the Gentiles which means he foretold when they would start and he foretold when they would finish amen by God's grace now no man knows the day of the hour but Daniel told all the events of the Daniel's 70 weeks right the 490 years and we still got three and a half years of those left amen three and a half years a half of the 70th week is still unfulfilled so the Jews still have that much time uh to serve the Lord and they'll get that under the ministry of God's two prophets Moses and Elijah so now let's go back to uh Daniel chapter 1 and uh let's look at verse one let's kind of build our way up here and we'll see how far we can get here so anyways I just put this slide up there that you know I was reading on the britanica and they said well Daniel had a lot of things wrong and uh Daniel had prophecies that were wrong and dates that were wrong and how many believe Daniel didn't have it wrong I believe Daniel had it right I believe britannica's got it wrong by God's grace because Jesus validated Daniel and we just read it we just read it now uh actually yeah let's we'll just read this up here uh Jesus mentions Daniel right here now this is spoken of the same scripture here that we referenced but it's just a parallel passage which means Luke 21 was speaking of the same thing we see in D or Matthew chapter 24 it's the same thing when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy Place who so readeth let him understand then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house so we get the same idea the same idea when the daily sacrifice was taken away when Titus came in uh history says that Christians left Jerusalem four years before Titus came the Holy Spirit had warned them to leave see God always keeps the Holy Spirit Filled from destruction God always protects his children but at at some point they surrounded Israel and then uh they basically starved Israel out it was one of the awfulest uh uh sieges ever recorded in history when Rome and Titus surrounded Jerusalem and starved them for four or five years and uh so much so they had no animals left and the daily sacrifice was taken away and Jesus mentioned it here uh that they would have to flee to the mountains and many of them that did uh some of them made it but many that didn't were slaughtered even though they tried to flee they were slaughtered but I want you to see that here that Jesus validated Daniel the Prophet like some people say oh Jonah how could Jonah be a true story how could there be such a fish how could there be a whale that size to swallow a fish but the fact is Jesus referenced Jonah GE Jesus said as Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights so the son of man must be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights how many you know that so a real believer looks at the words of Christ and said I'm either going to believe science or so-called science right science falsely so-called remember that when we preach on that it's science falsely socalled it's not really science amen uh just lot so many of them are lies but are we going to believe a lie from a scientific organization or we gonna believe Jesus Christ let's stand with Jesus Christ amen If he if he validated Jonah if he validated Daniel then he'll validate us as well because we believe it amen we're not believing anything that contradicts God's holy word amen so now let's go back to Daniel chapter 1 here now now we can go back there I just want to make sure I read that that Jesus validated uh Daniel the Prophet all right now as you read this the meaning of the name Daniel it means God is my judge which is an interesting uh meaning to his name there God is my judge I'll say like this he sure acted like God was going to judge him because he he watched his life amen not in a bad way but in a good way God was watching over his life and his name means God is my judge he's probably 16 years old when taken into captivity and brought to Babylon in 607 BC all right so I'm going to put it back up on that again so you can see that light that timeline there now let's go to Daniel chapter 1 verse one we'll start looking at the scriptures here in the third year of the reign of jeim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jeho Kim King of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of his God and the King spake unto aspan the master of his unic that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed and of the princes praise God so here's your scripture if you say well brother Jess where does it say the Bible said that Daniel was of the king's seed right here verse three certain of the king seed so he was somewhere down the lineage uh and one of the descendants of one of the Kings here now verse four children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science so these were scientific Jews they were very smart they understood science and such as had ability in them to stand the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chans So Daniel 16 and they look around and say well we're some good boys we're some strong smart men a young men that we can teach our wisdom and our understanding and they found some they found him they were in the King's family and Daniel was one of them so Daniel like we said he wasn't uh wasn't a poor boy he wasn't a cast out he was in the very one of the most highly favored of all the children so see God can use people out of the rich house as well right like we said now it's hard for a rich man to be saved but God can save a rich man right we've been looking at you know how in the samon church age how things are always God usually has poor people poor people poor people and he usually does but here's a time where he had a godly man who was actually of a well-favored home of a we'd say Royal seed verse five and the King appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king so look even the king had a little a time period where he wanted to train them up for three years so if he's 16 he have to be 19 right if it was three years if that was the actual date the king's got to prepare need a lot of training need a lot of understanding a lot of teaching have to learn all the customs of the Babylonians and so the king say well give me be three years uh before you stand before the king now verse six now among these were of the children of Judah Daniel haniah mishel and Azariah unto whom I'm sorry it's verse seven on whom the prince of the unic gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of belto shazar and to hananiah of Shadrach and unto mishel of meach and to Azariah Abednego verse eight here's what we like by God's grace but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the Unix amen by now I got some quotes where brother BR talks about this in just a minute um so we'll look at that shortly here I want to look something up real quick pardon [Music] me now let's look at verse uh 10 here verse 10 and the prince of the unic said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who ha appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort then shall you make me in danger my head to the king so the servant's like if you don't obey if I don't make you obey the King's Command he's going to take my head so you got to do what I ask you to do verse 11 then said Daniel to melzar whom the prince of the Unix had set over Daniel hananiah and mishel and Azariah prove thy servants I beseech thee 10 days so give us 10 days let us test this for 10 days and let uh them give us pulse to eat and water to drink then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat things me as thou seest deal with thy servants so he consented to them in this matter and prove them 10 days amen so I want you to notice Daniel's heart in verse eight he purposed in his heart he would not defile him self so he sent a direction even though I'm living in Babylon I've got a direction I've got a uh I've got a goal I've got a reach I cannot defile myself against the word of God I've got to keep God's word I've got to honor God's word I've got to live a Godly life even though very few people are going to live it amen in the midst of sinners in other words I've got to have that purpose I've got to be in other words I've got I've got to already have it decided I've already got to have an answer when someone comes up and offers me drugs I've already got to have it decided when someone comes up and offers me free tickets to the movies praise God I've already got to have it decided when someone says well don't you want to skip church and go somewhere this or that or don't you w to uh do this or that don't you want to go do this and go look at that and go that you've already got to have a purpose in your heart that I'm not going to do that because I'm not going to defile myself amen and at now church at 16 years old he had this how many wish you would have had at 16 I wish I would have I wish I got it about 19 that's when I really got my purpose in my heart to serve the Lord so I was about three years behind but Daniel was 16 years old and at the pressure of can you imagine like can you imagine being 16 years old in the White House okay and they say we got to eat Donald Trump's food you got to eat his diet you know that's kind of like the same thing you got to eat their diet and you gotta follow all the laws of the land right because that Nebuchadnezzar was uh the world ruler at that time he was even greater than Donald Trump was far as ruler and so forth like that so he said I've already got a purpose I've already got a direction I'm not going to follow myself not with the meat and not with the wine so what does he do he ask his boss for a request praise God so when your job asks you to do something contrary to God's word this is how you approach him you approach him with wisdom you make a request can I please now for sisters I've talked to numerous sisters on the phone phone this last year different ones that called me one from called me from New Jersey and said well what if my my employer says I can't wear skirts and I said well ask your employer if you can and she's like oh I never thought about that she just saw everybody wearing pants and I so she called me and said you know from New Jersey and said well I drive into New York City and work there every day you know I and I got to dress like all the people there I said well why don't you ask if you don't have to because that's what Daniel did Daniel just asked and he requested said would it be possible that I keep my convictions and still work here that's what we should do if your employer ask you to break God's word say please I I I appreciate this job I don't want to break God's word I want to keep God's word that's what Daniel did he didn't fight anybody he didn't Slaughter anybody he didn't try to kill anybody he just made a humble request 16 years old too he's not even a grown man we'd say as far as 21 years old so he makes a request I just want to keep myself pure and in verse n God had brought Daniel so during this time God brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the Unix now I want to go back to slide here maybe I didn't copy it oh I think I did here pardon me I did uh if you got your Bibles I think it's right here yeah go to Daniel 9:23 look at this Daniel 1 n and Daniel 123 kind of tie together I'm going to put this in here real quick did you catch that church that even the Sinners fell in love with Daniel everybody see that the unic started to love this guy just being around him a 16y old man they just started falling in love with Daniel well later we're going to find out why he had an excellent Spirit on he had the right Spirit on him now we know there's very aggressive men of God in the Bible like like Samson right he didn't try to make friends with the Philistines he whipped them so see God's got a variety how many you believe that God has the variety some people are more uh gung-ho you know some Believers are more take it like brother B said Bulldog faith and they're not GNA you know they're not going to take anything you know but look how look how G Daniel was he was a very gentle and careful uh and had an excellent spirit that means his Spirit wasn't contrary you know it wasn't wasn't an evil spirit it was the right Spirit he knew how to approach people he knew how to approach Sinners if the right Spirit on him amen he never exalted himself above the Sinners right he knew he was had a high calling but he treated them with respect how many want to show respect to all the Sinners I do want to respect all of them if Jesus called Judas friend we should call our enemies friends as well amen now Daniel 9:23 I'm not there anybody got that i' like to read that Daniel 9:23 brother Adam thank you sir at the beginning of the supplication the Commandments came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the the manner and consider the vision amen praise God now if you read in verse 21 who's speaking in Daniel here Gabriel Gabriel's an angel right he's an angel and Gabriel tells him Daniel your prayer was heard you're greatly beloved now if an angel told me I was greatly beloved I'd Rejoice amen because Angel is a messenger of God is that right so he's bringing God's message so God must have told Gabriel tell Daniel I love him greatly praise God and God loves us greatly amen the Bible said where with the great love he hath loved us amen but here it gets a personal note from God you're greatly loved so not only did God love him but even the Sinners Babylonians loved him I hope that can be your testimony I hope when you go out in the world I hope people fall in love with you because you're so sweet and kind praise God now not compromising with sin not laughing at adultery or not not laughing at dirty jokes or not joining in cussing or joining in that's not I'm talking about but just being kind and respectful and realizing in that that's a person that God created there's a soul behind that body and that soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen Daniel had an excellent Spirit not an argumentative Spirit not a critical spirit not a depressed Spirit he had an excellent Spirit Hallelujah now look at now Daniel 10:11 Daniel 1011 Daniel 10:11 there all right verse 11 and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved Hallelujah understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright For unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling ah praise God look at this great life that he lived amen what a wonderful man of God so I give you three witnesses there history says he was loved by by his co-workers praise God he was loved on the job Sinners loved him and not only that but more importantly God loved him amen and let me uh can I just look that up real quick I want to show because brother Austin's here tonight so happy to have him here tonight but let me look that up where a great love wherewith he loved us let me look that up real quick if I can there it is okay just so you got it you say where does the bible say God loves me right here he says it amen but God who's rich in Mercy for his great love where and he loved us does God love you church he does he does even we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved you didn't earn salvation Grace saved you amen unmar favor because his great love wherewith he loved us so not only did God love Daniel greatly he loved you greatly too praise God now the beautiful thing I want to show on that slide though what I found reading was that remember uh Daniel had intimate communion with God remember he prayed three times a day he prayed in the morning on his knees at noon and the evening time he played prayed at least three times a day he took time out of his work he go pray took time in the morning took time in the evening he prayed out three times a day how many want to do that by God's grace Hallelujah he was a dedicated man so like the Beloved disciple and the apocalyptic Seer of the New Testament John Daniel also is called a man greatly beloved and this is twice by the angel of the Lord amen hallelujah now did you catch that like brother brandom said did you catch that on Sunday Daniel was greatly beloved and so is St John how many know that they saw some of the same Visions anybody know that they saw some of the same Visions did you know that of the white Throne judgment John and Daniel saw the same vision of the white Throne judgment amen the very same thing and both of them are called greatly beloved of God Amen is't that interesting praise God and both of them wrote uh extremely important Prophecies of the future some of them we're still waiting on tonight by God's grace amen glory let's go back to Daniel chapter 1 please let's go back there and I think I'm gonna uh read this quote now I think I use this on uh few weeks ago yeah let's read this quote from 1953 God talked to Moses we read through this story where Daniel asked permission as a 16-year-old boy can I please not eat the meat can I please not drink the wine I've got a Kosher diet how many know the Jews have a Kosher diet they can't eat certain things right now we'll read this quote in just a moment I was looking I was trying to look up here the exact foods that they couldn't eat because I just thought of that I can't find a quick list so okay oh all right well I'll have to look again sorry this is the quote and Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's meat when you say you're going to do anything going to accept your healing or you're going to accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's when the devil flies on you with all four feet he said that's right when he got down there he said he W he said what he was going to do the king come around and seeing there was an excellent spirit in Daniel so he said now you put them fellows over there and feed him can you imagine being 16 years old and you're already trained up with excellent Spirit what would that be church that would be God's gift to you praise God God's Gift of certain uh gifts in your life how many know Daniel had gifts in his life to interpret dreams and Visions how many know he had that the brother B in the even says the gifts and callings of God are without repentance so he's born as a proper child he he can interpret visions and dreams and this gift is laying in his life all the time and then he's trained by his uh his Royal seed line and then he's brought to Babylon and he already starts gaining favor as a teenager at 16 years old my oh my I guess the doctor would come along and said now look they need plenty of vitamins so I tell you you got to give them some wine and some hard drinks and some fat things a whole lot of calories in it a lot of meat and a lot of stuff and the King said I'll feed them off my own table but when it come down to Old Daniel Amen they met somebody there that loved the Lord hallelujah so see what what's your motivation to stay pure your love for God Amen praise the Lord they met somebody that loved the Lord it was Daniel so I'm not going to drink your wine I'm not going to eat your meat because I love the Lord the guy that the guy that come in the audience he said now look here here's a dish that the king sent down said just how look how it looks a great big gobler full of whiskey sitting on it look whiskey so brother Braham tells us it's he kind of dramatized it for us he said now the king wants you to be happy so he's just going to give you some of this now keep you stimulated up my he said oh I just won't drink it he said oh I'm afraid for my life for yours remember he said either if you don't eat this I'm going to die it's my head he said I'll tell you what to do just give me pulse for 10 days and then look me over amen otherwise he said it was a little bit of lentil some cornpone whatever you want to call it he said just give me a little bit for 10 days and then examine me against the rest of them he said brother I'd rather have a little bit and be in the kingdom of God and doing what God's wants me to do than have a whole lot and be away from the kingdom of God I'd rather take my way with a bunch of little holy rollers and live in the presence of God than to belong to the biggest church in Chicago or akan and be out of the kingdom of God hallelujah So Daniel could have had all this food he could had the best food you could say like this he could have ate from what's the best restaurant around here he could have ate from kind of well tell me your taste if you shout something out uh Outback there yeah I like Outback too yeah you could either out eat from Outback every night or you got to eat a strict vegetarian diet and but see if you eat from out back you they' put some whiskey on there and they you know they put some whiskey in your glass and all these things like that and Daniel will say like that turn turn down out back he turned it down and he said I'll just take pulse which is just a vegetable diet bean diet lentils but in one place brother Bram said peas lentils and peas and beans can you imagine that that's all you eat that and water for 10 days but you could have Outback every night you could have Chipotle every night you could have all these things but he turns it down because the word said he shouldn't eat certain kinds of meats he shouldn't drink certain kinds of wine and if the word says it Daniel when the purpose in his heart I'm GNA stand with the word no matter what they try to get me to do I'm GNA stand with the word I want to tell you church if you can get your heart purpose right now it'll last you the rest of your life amen because Daniel's uh fast forward 60 years later and they try to get him to stop praying and what he turns it down because he said I'm purposed in my heart No One's Gonna Keep Me From My Prayer amen so we find him at 16 years old and 80 years old he's so purposed in his heart nobody can get him to compromise nobody can defile him why because he's in love with God Amen brother Bram said i' rather have a little bit and be in the kingdom of God than have everything and be out of the kingdom of God what's the matter with me tonight anyhow let me tell you my brother what we need is a good old old time St Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back in the church again they fed him this stuff for 10 days little old pot of peas if I go to eat I'm telling you right now I'm not buying Peas I can get peas at the Aldi I can I can get peas at home when I go out to eat I want to get something I usually don't get like I like nice fish dishes or something like that you know something nice that we don't maybe get all the time or uh something something something special well he just says I'll take this little pot of lentils and peas nothing in it to make you fat the first thing you know they brought Daniel up and the rest of them they looked all the boys over he says when they brought old Daniel up my his cheeks was Rosy he was just as Round And as fat as he could be oh my Hallelujah he said say I believe every time they set that little pot of peas down before Daniel that God just reached over look at this and got a bottle of vitamins and poured the whole thing into those peas he said Hallelujah he said he still got them in glory tonight if you'll keep his Commandments do his will follow after the baptism of the Holy Spirit and seek to serve God he said amen I feel good he said look brother God just fed Daniel with some kind of vitamin but I can see him standing there just as Round And as fat as he could be I can hear one of them say say that guy hasn't had too much to eat I just give him a corn pone every morning that's all he had but God said here I'll bless your bread and water so maybe it was bread maybe it was a vegetable bread diet but the point is it was scarce food right it wasn't the it wasn't the delicious it wasn't the delightful food it was the common food uh and he and uh that's all he just say with that that's the common food the the the pulse and water and he says it again I'd rather live for God and have bread and water then live for the devil and have fried chicken and ice cream three times a day would you sure yes sir Daniel just as fat and as round as he could be you know and his cheeks was just as rosy he walked up there and said yes sir your honor yes sir here I am looked him over and said my he's done out grow his clothes nearly in 10 days eating a a cornpone every morning my how God will bless somebody that doesn't want to be defiled listen brother don't desire the big things of this world don't be satisfied with what God's give you I'm sorry Mercy but be satisfied with what God's give you forgive me I put a word in there be satisfied with what God gives you the only thing to be is be sure you're in the will of God and the church said can you say amen amen so see God somehow put Supernatural vitamins inside of that pulse now you know today there's churches that follow this diet did you know that they'll go and research the Daniel diet it's oh it's big all over the Internet churches will follow some people made some big money on that because I've seen it on TV uh Church uh you know TV shows so what they'll do is they they sell the food they start they say oh you want to be successful like Daniel you want to be wise like Daniel eat his diet and then they sell you the food then they make all this money now I believe this too I believe if if you eat the right Foods I believe you'll be healthier don't you but the the motivation behind Daniel's diet was not to be more fit or more healthy or uh or to be more strong physically it was to stay pure to God's word now don't get me wrong God wants somebody who's healthy God wants somebody who's not gonna Gorge themselves and uh and eat too much and be a sloth and things like that and be lazy God don't want that but his motivation was not to be defiled by something that would break the word of God that was his main desire as brother Ram said because he loved God here and he wanted to be in the will of God praise the Lord now remember in verse 14 he gives in and say okay we'll try this for 10 days and let's see if you're better looking than all the other ones and the Bible said in verse 15 did we read that yet I don't think so at verse 15 and at the end of the 10 days their countenance appeared fair and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat so God made them healthier on the regular food on the scriptural food we'll say like that the scriptural food than the King's food right and let me say like this God will make you spiritual healthier on the King on on the God's food the scriptural food more than the denominational food are you with me the fancy food the worldly food God will make make you healthier on the word food amen hallelujah you'll be stronger spiritually you look more like a rugged Christian Soldier just eat on God's food just eat the words of life from the Bible amen verse 16 thus Mel melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse so see they passed the test that's what the Bible says remember God said about tithe and offerings he said test me God said try me pay your tithes and offerings and see if I will pour open the floodgates of heaven and bless you with blessings you can't even count God said try me put me to the test right and I'm a witness that that's the truth but brother brandom used that scripture for other scriptures brother Bram said would try me put God to the test with Divine Healing put God to the test with the desire of your heart put God to the test with winning souls put God to the test with any promise of God and see if God don't back up his word amen take him to take him out his word if the word says it believe it that's what faith in God's word does it grabs a hold of the word and it won't let go to God's word amen so see Daniel put God's word to the test and God's word won God's word was Victorious because he put God's word first amen look at verse 17 and as for these four children what did God do because they kept the Commandments God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams that's a mighty gift of God right there now look how many how many believe Daniel was an important person in the Bible how many believe that he was was a very extremely important person because of the prophecy especially surrounding Israel from the from the time he passed away to the time of Christ and even up to today his prophecy are we're still looking at them we're still understanding them we're still waiting upon God to bring something to pass he's an extremely important person so what did God uh how did God prepare Daniel God had him live a consecrated life you see if we want to be used like Daniel we gotta live a consecrated life like Daniel praise God how many believe they got gifts in their life how many believe that from God if You' got a gift of God in your life you got to be like Daniel you got a purpose in your heart I'm not going to let anything from the world Make Me Filthy in God's sight I'm just going to keep God's word that's my purpose and I'll request uh with everyone I meet I request that they'll help me and allow me to keep God's word amen I'm GNA sh I'm gonna share brother Adam's testimony with his job brother Adam got a te a job here in akan and he had told them no working on Sunday because of church right and they made him work on Sunday so he quit the the job and I was so blessed I'm like praise the Lord amen that's beautiful and then a few weeks later God gave him the job that he has now he never has to work a Saturday or Sunday is that right praise to me that's a modern-day Daniel right there can you say praise the Lord put put God to the test praise the Lord put take God at his word amen if God's word says it you believe it that settles it amen I think that's a just I thought that was a beautiful example of real Christian faith don't you always put God's words first amen because you got to go about it humbly look you got to go about it humbly we're not in today Old Testament where you can beat somebody up and you know hey I'm just like Samson those days are past Church aren the days of today today is a day of love where love conquers everything praise God Divine love love suffereth long love will never fail remember Paul said all those things today is the day of the Holy Spirit love conquering not violence Jesus said if you take the sword or if you take a a shotgun you'll die with a shotgun can I say it like that you fight with a shotgun you're gonna die with a shotgun whenever you take the battle that's what you're gonna you're gon that's what's gonna happen to you and I'll say like this I'll take the word to fight with amen and let the word fight for me hallelujah amen you see we should let God do our fighting for us let God fight our battles and not ourselves and so how do you approach it like Daniel Daniel said Daniel just gave a request Lord could I ple or Sorry boss could I please have this and God answered his God answered his prayer amen and then because of that in verse 17 God gave them knowledge which is remember understanding they understood and skill which are abilities actions so understanding and skills in all learning and wisdom so whatever they learned they had good understanding of it can you imagine that you imagine picking up a book you could read it and then you could do it you imagine that my imagine like building like a building like this can you imagine building a a house or something like that and doing all the work yourself this is Daniel and these they such a gift and a blessing from God they live so consecrated that whatever they learned God blessed them God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning all so astrology biology right ecology philosophy you start naming all these ologies and uh he whatever they learned God bless them that's what I want my life to be amen I want to not don't want to be defiled by the things of the world I want to live consecrated unto Christ amen and then Lord bless me let my gifts be blessed expand my understanding in all my gifts his gifts were visions and dreams so God expand my gifts in my life let them be used for your glory amen now look at Verse 18 now at the end of the days of that that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the Unix brought them in before neb Nezar and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like who Daniel haniah Michel and Azariah therefore they stood before the king wow what a beautiful beautiful quote there verse 20 and in all maners look again all you imagine every problem they brought to these guys every every test every course we'd say they mastered everything my goodness what a gift of God that was God's gift and yet God's got a Revival with two million Jews back there over with Nehemiah and Ezra and yeah zubal God's got a revival going here but he's got a witness in every place amen God has not left himself without a witness he's got witnesses in Aran tonight amen hallelujah though a 100,000 people won't serve him and fully and won't and will be defiled he's got a few that will remain undefiled amen and I'm one of them Hallelujah you should be one of them as well live undefiled Hallelujah let God give you complete blessings in all matters look at verse 20 all matters of wisdom understanding that the king inquired of them he found them 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were all I'm sorry that were in all his realm these are some gifted men here and Daniel continued even on the first year of King Cyrus I'm going to close a little bit because I've been preaching about an hour here I'm gonna close in just a little bit by God's grace but I just want to make sure I emphasize that again they were 10 times better than everyone else and M he was 16 years old imagine he was competing against 20 year olds you know 30 year olds uh later on there's susers there's uh All The Magicians and everything like that and he has made the master of all the musici or magicians actually not musicians magicians he's made the master of all the magicians those who have studied the uh the Arts I would say like that the Arts he's made the top of all them he's quite a man but what did he try to do he tried to live a consecrated walk with the Lord amen now I want to read this quote here it's going to be kind of small so I don't expect you to read it here I found it earlier today and I was really blessed here's a quote I just read but I'm skipping down to this part right here can I make that larger no sorry now sorry yeah that's so tiny yeah you don't have to look at that Daniel purpose in his heart brother said that he wouldn't defile himself with the world he was going to keep the tradition that God laid down the Commandments of God so he just said you know if God laid it if God wrote it in the Bible I'm Gonna Keep it yeah that's that's all I did he purposed in his heart I'm directing my heart this is my purpose on life is to say pure from the defilement of the world Amen like for example I was given a I've got two gift cards for $50 to go down to Regal Cinemas right down there and buy movie tickets well guess what I'm not letting those defile me one of these days I'm going to walk in there buy some popcorn and walk out with those gift cards uh or if they ever get a Christian movie in there you would probably never but every now and then the Christian guys will put out a documentary they might have it there but I'm not even looking at this point I'm given I'm given $50 of Temptation right it's just like Daniel the King's food is laid right there well why don't you go see Batman I used to like Rocky why don't you go see Rocky babo a new movie I used to love those movies when I was a sinner but you know what I won't be defiled with the king's meat amen they just sit there so I can use them I'm use them I want to use them with wisdom might go on Craigslist and sell them for $45 or something like that but you see so see a real Christian can have sin presented right before him and they'll turn it down amen I'm not wasting those money those families I'm going to use it with wisdom I'm not going to be defiled by a free pass for sin I'm going to live righteously before the Lord Jesus Christ when all my family leaves the other night a few Monday nights ago all my family left and I was home by myself for three hours guess what I did studied and prayed for three hours I didn't go on the you you or I didn't go on YouTube and watch the basketball game I didn't try to go over and watch a dirty movie for three hours I'm all by myself what do I do pray read the word of God worship listen to music why because I won't be defiled with the king's me amen because there's one thing I love that's Jesus Christ amen this body of course yes is tempted daily by everything but I understand that this guy is always GNA be fighting against me this guy's Never Satisfied you give him a little break he gets lazy on God you got to keep him in subjection to the word of God so we find ourselves when we're tempted and sin is laid right before us we must turn it down let me tell you brother Austin it gets easier all the time as you become a Christian how many can say Amen to that at first it was hard to turn down the cigarettes and the chew and now it's no problem at all at first it was hard not to go see Rocky five and six and seven but now it's not hard anymore because I'm stronger greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world the Christ in me is greater than the part of me that still lives in this world with these five senses my six sense is greater than My Five Senses amen hallelujah when the five senses want to go out and do something wrong or or get lazy on God the six sense says I'm stronger you listen to me you purpose in your heart to be a real servant of God God help each one of us to be a real servant of God tonight amen purpose in your heart so I've got a purpose not to be defiled with sin as we said on Sunday for sisters you have to purpose yourself not even to cut your split ends and how did I know that was a good discernment for some some some in the church I appreciate them let me know with their testimonies that was really wonderful and uh so see everybody gets tempted don't they we all get tempted we all go through hard times and tested and tempted and all these things like that but see the Holy Spirit knows exactly how to bring his word to you amen exactly right I showed you on Sunday night that the hair represents the Holy Spirit praise God Isaiah 30 verse one hair on a woman represents the holy spirit so when you cut off the hair represents the spirit's influence in your life you lose part of his influence praise God that's what it means brother Bram said it represents the leadership of the holy spirit so when you cut that off you're no longer led by the Holy Spirit you're saying I don't need your leadership I don't need this word my what a what a what a what an awful thing to do and brothers we get tempted like what it said with movies dirty jokes Evil songs business deals that might be off the word of God lustful thoughts right maybe thoughts of anger thoughts of Revenge thoughts of hatred right all these things thoughts of gossip and all these things like that and no matter what we're tempted with we can all be Overcomers we're all more than conquerors in Christ Jesus there is no excuse for sin right because in every trial God Will Make A Way of Escape amen there's always a way out praise God I was talking about awes there's certain sins I did before I got married and I just thought there was no way I could overcome them but as I started serving God and started realizing I found that if I would just hold out God would make a way out out of every Temptation for me if I would just hold out and just don't do that sin for a little longer just wait a little longer hold out on that sin God always made a way out amen Glory Hallelujah and then as you get Victory it becomes addictive praise God it becomes a uh it becomes your battlecry it just becomes your routine you're a Victor and so when Temptation comes before you you just conquer you just conqu conquer you just cast it down you just cast it down you tell Satan to get behind you you become more of a conqueror it's just like an army you get a victory you get on a roll it's hard to stop an army that's on a roll amen same thing in in life you get on a roll and you become a Victor praise God that becomes who you are let me read this last one here this is from Investments 1964 so see you might not have read this in the Bible but Daniel was making Investments to be to have eternal life when he would choose to eat pulse the the the veeg vegetarian when he was doing that he was actually investing in eternal life to be saved because he was keeping God's Commandments the Bible didn't say that itself but brother Ram says when you obey God's word it's making investment in eternal life hallelujah amen he said d purpose in his heart that he wasn't going to defile his investment Glory he purpose no matter what the world how rich the king gets and how much he tries to get me off in the things of the world I'm not going to do it I'm not going to defile my investment look at that church let me give you an example like the van we bought we almost got it paid off we bought that that's an investment right so what do you do with the investment you take care of it I'm not going to defile my investment I'm not going to take my van for a spin in the field to get it all mudded up like a lot of teenage boys do I'll say like that some teenage boys that are 30 and 40 too unfortunately I'm not going to try to squeeze it and park it in a spot where there's cars really close by that you know somebody's going to ding your your van when you get out I'm not going to go the whole winter without giving it a wash because the salt will eat away at the car and produce it to make it rust why because it's an investment I want it to last a long time and what do we want to last more longer than eternal life amen our walk with god what do we want what's more valuable or what's what greater investment do we have than our walk with Jesus Christ if I'll protect my car and I'll take it to get oil change every 5,000 miles not three this one's five which is nice I'm not defiling it they're free for the first 100,000 miles too which is a blessing but you see I'm not going to defile on can you imagine me skipping a few oil changes brother Adam and then wondering why is this van doing so bad it's been 15,000 miles since I got a oil change and oils and burning oils coming out the back and and the lights are on I'm just ignoring it like well I got to get to church I'll take care of it later that would show I have a really bad attitude towards my investment that I made that would show that I really don't value what I put into this van I don't value that monthly payment that I have to do I don't really value that I don't want this van to last forever but see our walk with God we want it to last forever amen that's why we value that's why we come get a oil change every Sunday night Sunday and Wednesday night Hallelujah I say oil change how oil fill up amen can I say like that your human spirit is what needs filled up not your Soul if you're born again your Soul's already sealed until the day of your Redemption but you need an oil change I need oil change in my mind because my mind gets some carbon in it my mind gets some uh defiling in it and it needs clean out praise God it gets tired my mind gets tired so when we come to church and we worship God we C we get all that wash all the trash and all the junk and the all the bad parts we get all that taken out and we get an oil change Hallelujah because that's our investment amen we're investing in eternal life tonight I know we're little number I know I can hardly sing I know that I know I'm not much of a Preacher but I know one thing I know this word brings eternal life amen I've seen it work on some of your lives some of you got saved under my Ministry and you've seen it work in the Ministries you got saved under is that right this word brings eternal life amen it's wor worth investing in hallelujah amen so that means you put your heart into it you put your time your resources your money uh your thoughts you put everything into God because it's the greatest investment you ever make amen Daniel said I'm not going to defile my investment oh Christian world don't defile yourself don't defile your investment that you've made in eternal life you'll pollute it right see cussing swearing watching dirty things saying dirty things any sin you can read in the Bible it will defile your Christian experience and we don't want to be polluted we want to be pure amen we're investing tonight in the greatest investment there could ever be made your 401k brother or sister my grow my that might be a great investment but the stock market May crash and you might lose some of that your investment will be polluted but I promise you there'll be no stock crashing of God's eternal life in heaven Hallelujah there'll be no crash of that it only grows exponentially with dividends and rewards amen hallelujah it always doubles amen remember five tals turns a 10 three turns a six one turns a two it'll always double what a percentage of investment that is amen it's guaranteed to double if you'll invest in it hallelujah amen Daniel purposed that he wouldn't do it I'm not going to be like the rest of the Babylonians I'm not going to be like the rest of the leans praise God like when they all dressed up for Halloween last Halloween I was the only one not in the picture with all the teachers all dressed up for Halloween I'm the only one that didn't I won't be defiled when they all go out to drink on the Friday nights guess who don't go I'm the only one that don't go probably as far as I know they all go drink they all go get a filed but they don't even ask me anymore to go out they used to when that but they used to ask me to go golfing I wouldn't because I know they're going to drink and smoke and cuss there I said I won't go golfing with you either pretty soon I'm not much of a friend anymore and now I'm isolated a lot I only got a few Christian friends because most of them know I will not be defiled with the king's meat amen I won't be defiled and church it's awesome like on Friday we're in there singing Lauren deago songs or we're there singing Mercy Me or some Christian song Amazing Grace and there's teachers in the hallway copying paper singing along saying how can it be amazing grace I look at them and say praise the Lord you know God they're serving the lord and one of them walked up one time and said I love Friday afternoons after school because I walk down the hallways and I hear you and the children praising God worshiping God there might be a few in there and uh there might be maybe a Shadrach n jacking AB to go but I want to be a Daniel at my school praise God don't you want to be a Daniel at your at your job or your home or where your school wherever you are don't you want to be a Daniel there don't pollute your investment stand like Daniel stood let's stand to our feet by God's grace Daniel purposed and I'm so sorry that's so small I thought it'd be I thought I could make it bigger but I can't yeah I can't for this for some reason I can't expand this one Daniel purposed that he wouldn't do it and look what brother said his invest paid off amen by Saving his life when he was thrown into a lion's den his investment really paid off amen hallelujah the church our investment might pay off when you get sick 10 years down the road five years down the road you lose your job 10 years down the road you lose your house your your child's sick or you're sick someone's in the hospital and when you need God the most Church you call upon his name and watch and see if your investment don't pay off but you got to believe with all your heart how many believe with all your heart amen he said it saved his life when he was put into the lion's den because when you invest in God God makes sure you get you reap the dividends of it amen how many thank God for that tonight amen let's bow our heads here heavenly father I thank you for tonight Lord we're looking at a purposed heart we're looking at Daniel's investment that he made at 16 young years old Lord God I remember being 16 now at 16 years old he said I'm purpose I have a direction I'm a young man and I think of brother Austin at 20 probably the youngest one here closest to that Lydia's 12 she's four years away they're both four years from it and there Daniel's at 16 and he stands up to we'd say like a Donald Trump Administration he stands up to the greatest government this government on the face of the entire Earth he stands up and requests can I please try something else I don't want to break God's word Lord and then the Bible said Lord that you blessed him you gave him all learning all knowledge all understanding and all dreams he was 10 times better than everybody else father we're not guaranteed to be 10 times better than Maybe the other worker on our job or the other person in our class or something but Lord we want to be this we want to be undefiled and we want others to look at us and say my there's a True Believer in the Commandments of God they have sin laying right in front of them but instead of indulging in it their purpose to live pure before God because Lord one day we know it might hurt now to sacrifice right now but one day we know this investment will really pay off in great dividends when we need you the most when Daniel needed you the most you came on the scene Lord Jesus and so Lord I thank you for that tonight because I know Lord you're not a respector of persons if you were there for Daniel you were there for Gideon you were there for the three Hebrew children when they needed you the most Ezekiel Jeremiah Lord all these men we can name St Paul Shipwrecked three times beat five times with 39 lashes I believe or three times and you were there for him every time he was in death often and you often delivered him because Lord his heart was purposed to serve you he didn't defile himself with the blaspheming Jews Lord God and Lord tonight I pray for each person here each person live streaming Lord may they purpose in their heart tonight that they'll not be defiled at work or in the home or at school but they can just live a consecrated holy life to you because they love you Lord you know in my heart I I remember being home that night for three hours I remember run up the stairs hurrying so I could eat a little bit and Rush down to study because I just value that time that quiet time I just love that time with you so much Lord to read your word Lord
