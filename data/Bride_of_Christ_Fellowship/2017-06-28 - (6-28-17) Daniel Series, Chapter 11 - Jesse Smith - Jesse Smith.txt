mauka he's got us over the course didn't you see the bright light shine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and we're only one chapter way from finishes by God's grace it's been a wonderful book you know I've always been a little nervous any book that's prophetic of course you knew and I know we just feel a little nervous about that but as we go back to grams quotes it makes everything clear so we're very thankful for that Daniel chapter 11 Trust has been made clear to you what we've gone over so far if not for anybody to go back over and listen to it again tonight is the chapter I have the least amount of clothes on so how about there's a lot of history behind it so we'll just be looking at the scriptures that we have a lot of clothes for to see how the Prophet interpreted this so this is the awesome the longest chapter I believe in the whole book if I'm not mistaken I think effort to might be a little bit longer after looking up let's go to Daniel chapter 11 that's just reverses one - by the grace of the Lord Daniel 11 one and two first one says also high in the first year of Darius the Mede even I stood to confirm and to strengthen him remember who's talking here that's not Daniel this is the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord standing to come to strengthen even King Darius where look at that tonight by God's grace verse 2 and now will I show thee the truths we can speak into Daniel you hold there so stand up yet three kings and Persia and the four shall be far richer than they are and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grisha my god is messenger rimas word may be seen on compilation Malachi is a live stream on them I'm sorry your mommy sent me text I didn't see it till now she says the live stream so I was gonna send a quick text I don't encourage Texas during the service America I'm doing it just for the kingdom of god sake you know so somebody can get the message I went over that years ago you know with technology and the service you know if you can is because it puts the phone on if you can you know put it on airport mode or just shut it off if someone's in the hospital or you're expecting an important call or some like that put on vibrate if you can't by God's grace I know a few times I missed it and it's going off so forgive me I never would've grieve the Holy Spirit always asked God to forgive me if I've ever done a mistake so thank God for His mercy it was love let's look at I got a lot of quotes so Malik I didn't want to switch over here you can look at the coupe's Joy chapter LED and hope your hope you're under expectation praise the Lord Amen that's what I do every time I go to trust that God raised my expectation no more it's helped me to understand everything that I can understand for this day he's remember a lot of this chapter was for the Jews because remember a lot of this book is for the Jews it's to Daniel's people as we've read through it and longer thigh people the people of the holy Covenant you know the people of Israel the Holy Land a lot of this is to the Jews but we must know it by God's grace and as you'll see in chapter 12 I'm sure you remember the angel said this book is going to be sealed up until the end time so now that the end time is here the book has been open to us because we have say the Lord on date night chapter 2 is the safety Lord program gave us the state the lorna on rome ruling at the end time interpreting daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and so that lines up with daniel seventy weeks which brother had preached in 1961 so it all lines up there by the grace of the lord everything else will be just falls into place but we've got the stated the Lord on the major theme role in the ruling at the end time so let's look at this tonight I trust you'll be blessed by the grace of the Lord Daniel chapter eleven now this chapter takes place in the same year as chapter 10 because you remember the end of chapter 10 the angel he keeps talking to about I got more to tell you I've got to leave it a little bit but I got more to tell you so chapter 11 actually picks up where chapter 10 ended off at the same year Daniel's about 84 years old now verses 2 to 35 according to the commentaries and things that I've read began to be fulfilled about six years later in 530 BC and continued to be fulfilled until around 167 BC so these are some amazing prophecies all given in 536 BC Daniel wrote them down and they're going to be fulfilled for the next 400 years that's a real prophecy amen that's a real man of God was Daniel now verses 36 to 45 I couldn't find any quotes of brother Branham on any of those scriptures so I'll be just be using some of the other quotes that talk about that they talk about Israel rather they seem to be solely about the future Antichrist which we believe to be the Pope not everybody believes that but we believe it to be the Pope because the woman rides the beast the woman Rises spirit of wrong who leads the woman right and who else would prophesy who else who's the one man that could be a false prophet that could prophesy things the whole world the over will believe it and yet he's false or this doctor that's got to be the Pope gotta you know now verse one now I got my songbook up here so you need to switch all right now first one to Ange the Lord stood to confirm and strengthen him the hint was Darius the Mede and he was the heathen ruler remember but this is during the time of the Medes and Persians remember the statue you had Babylon the head Medes and Persians for the chest down to the belly okay and then the loins area was ancient Greeks and then the legs and feet were Rome right so this is spoken during the time of the Medes or the chest of silver now to me as I read this it's amazing to see how active God is in the realm of politics and world powers and these are the examples we're looking at just briefly tonight we already see that God is strengthening God is giving strength to a heathen king there is the me he also some years later gives strength and inspiration to Cyrus the Meade who was also an even King and then Nebuchadnezzar this was of course earlier God he was a strength of Nebuchadnezzar used him as a tool and then of course we know before this Pharaoh the Egyptian king was used by God as well so gods in charge God is orchestrating all these things around the world now does he ever do anything evil no God doesn't have them do anything evil that they don't want to do but as you'll see mother Branham said God has to have somebody to fulfill his word and because these people reject his word they fall in line and have to fill fulfill the other word the example brigade was Mike Mike hi member Mike hi he was the Prophet the days of a hat and Jehoshaphat remember that and brother Anderson God needed somebody to fulfill that word about any heaven Jezebel being eaten by dogs remember that so Mike aya said he said they have said the Prophet ISA cause he does I hate this guy all she does is prophesy evil against me and he says but Joseph as said is there any other prophet that we have these 400 all agree that we should hope the rain Mount Gilead and you said is there anybody else and and mayhap said yeah there's that Holy Roller micaiah but he always besides evil gets me but go rat but like I said I'll tell you the shade the Lord amen he said I saw and I saw in heaven I saw the High God I on his throne lifted up and an evil spirit came out and said who God said who would the sea they have for me to go through and my Juliet and a lying spirit came up so let's see that's a good example but right here's that example God has to have somebody from those word so he allows evil spirits to annoy people right to do that he one things of God not about you and I with our desire should be to be filled with the true Holy Spirit amen and not evil spirits not lighting spirits but the Spirit of Truth a man and we could put build them good promises of God out of you one of those against the holy spirit holiday all the days of my life to fulfill the good word of God not the judgments and not the Eagle bent we say the curstyn Word of God but the blessing Word of God now here let's let's this prove this know your Cyrus everyone said in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia now this was 445 BC so this is about 90 years after Darius now the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia who stirred him up who got him motivated who got him inspired God got an even he inspired they know that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it writing saying thus saith I wrote the king of Persia the Lord go to heaven have given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he had me to build in the house in Jerusalem can you imagine that of heathen king saying I'm led by God to build the house of God God God has to use anybody is to use somebody that fulfills work now then he said who there among you who wants to travel across the desert I think it was 500 miles who wants to get on a camel and he suffer and go through the hot sweat who wants to travel and get sanctify to go back over the desert to go back and build the house of God which is leg in shambles and Ezra was one of those guys through mogul Amen all those Zadok the priest and Joshua the high priest all these men were willing and remember the temple was in shambles but they're willing to go back wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow full of shambles and dirt and and move it away and then we know Nehemiah came to started building the wall after that see God wants people that are laborers even if everything looks like it's this ass even if after it looks like a spiritual disaster I need somebody to build it up baby at least have some witnesses an actor to establish the real true Word of God I would be one of those men won't build it from the ground up things in which we have he stopped me to join somebody else's church we started from the bottom of a net because there's no church an actor and we want to be like same a the Bible set our Dane elders in every city raised the lowest that's what we're here to do just like them but see God usually heathen King just like he was going to use Darius remember God said to Jeremiah do what I've said and take the families of the north this is the Jewish families save the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant a heathen King right who believed in God an even king who go to Idol Daniel and I go worship her but yet God said he's my son why because everybody's a servant of God amen everybody has to fall in the plan of God amen he will force them to do it but because of their their spirit guy can work with him like we said with a hat God like to send a lying spirit in that because they don't want the truth so God has to give him over to a lie now remember Romans this is the scripture I searched for this morning and the Holy Spirit help me find it for the scripture says I'm the Pharaoh even for this same purpose I've raised the up that if I show my power me and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth see as he brought his armies to the Red Sea what was God a new show his power in Pharaoh had to use somebody so fara was another tool in the hand of God amen remember let's get to the u.s. now brother Branham says he drops this in and says I tell you Romanism is going to rule the word according to the Bible don't watch Iron Curtain is a bamboo currency so don't fight Russia so much in China but watch the purple curtain that's the one that's going to get you now this week did you see this week I hollow Catholic news servus it's a Catholic newspaper basically but their videos they put out every day did you see this week the Pope issued out a command for bishops to have apology services for all the molestation of children they've done and they had one right there I think in New York if I'm not mistaken and they're trying to make up and they're trying to show that a humility and apologize for some of these things and the other thing they did this week was they consecrated which I saw this is I can show it to you on youtube if you had it's right from Catholic News Service there's a move amongst the Catholic Church which is this is an act of deception they're having all these real women who are who are naturally merging women and they're married Jesus Christ and they're called the Virgin's of the church now look what the Catholic Church see how they're trying to mock the real thing and they're giving no words there and they have wedding dresses on I can show you the video these three women in America marry what was the principal one was a accountant he's three Catholic women in America and ever wedding dresses on and they're married Christ but the action what they're doing is marrying the Catholic Church because if they marry Christ Italy marry the word then they would have pray to marry then they would have pray to dead people right now look how shaken is what's he trying to do he's impersonating what's going on right now in a hat with the true Bride of Christ crisis washing us right and by our repentance that we become virgin to the word amen his brother branham said we were on our first I will says we were already married to sin we have a first husband none of us were pure right spiritually we all came into the world speaking live and programs or the Bible said that our first marriage had to die our first husband had to die and that was Satan that was sit in death we had to die to our sins but then Paul said that you might be married to somebody else amen and we got lose that we're married to Christ amen so see the washing of the water of the word makes us pure and virgin to Christ amen so CY said let's go brothers that's why I subscribe to them watch that Catholic Church watch what she's doing it'll show you what's going on amen perhaps the communist is nothing but a tool and playing right up don't fear is it don't fear about that that's something to throw you off the track of looking but Bible readers have many loved on stay with what the Bible said so see how there's a lot of attention on Isis and Iran and North Korea don't get me wrong they can do some real awful damage but if we get our ice off the Catholic Church well the random said that Satan's tactic to throw you off you won't see what your real I to be doing I have to close my ramps if you're going to meet the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church that's your true enemy he said why because they're enemies to the word I'm not the individuals are smelling we want to go fight them but we have to stand against them they're an enemy to true doctrine so again not to know it's not individual that's the center now it could be a verb not if there are predestinated be safe then it could be an individual but it's the spiritual wickedness behind an individual man may have said I said there's three isms that rose up not Nazism fascism communism three isms will revolve and come around to the one of the communism you watch on to to love God's hand they think they're against God they're working right into all the same don't know it he's just using the memo as a puppet uh-huh so I'm true in his hand like he didn't never can answer many the others see all these sinners are you know just a tool of the hand of God signs of his coming 62 he talks about the very Catholic President Kennedy as far as I know he's a man like anybody else it's not bad it wasn't a I mean it was a pretty good fella it was a jessebella hun and that's what was behind it that's the thing they've done the trouble it ain't Kennedy it's that jessabelle Church behind him praise God that's what's it doing it sure that's exactly so see now we're seeing how God is God is just pointing out on the Catholic Church came into our country there's an Iron Curtain blue purple brother don't you fear no the rest of a watch that purple curtain I'm gonna skip ahead talks about mister Kennedy getting he says not him it's that system behind him wait till she gets word into the cabinet remember I told you almost half of the Congress and Senate are Catholic now and brother Graham said in his day he said I think a half or a third or forth we're Pentecostal so see how the Catholic Church is moving in and everywhere she came in watch what happened watch what have done in other nations look what it's always done just a couple more of these ordered image to the beast exactly don't you fear a communist and you fear Catholicism now don't be scared but in other words respect and watch them watch their moves although they say we would come in like flatteries now we're look at the flatteries again in Chapter 11 in just a few minutes here it's a secret it's a look because it's time trade - the word time days ain't nothing but playing right at the hands of God he said now did you realize that do you ever think of that God has to make his word come to pass she's gotta have somebody fulfilled right and it's the people who rejected the truth any proxy don't stay with the word that's the reason I say today no matter how good it looks huh how many preachers are saying this or that I'm gonna take over the world throw it out don't you never try to fight communism fight Romanism for that thus saith the Lord look at that thus saith the lord the lord sent Romanism is going to rule not communism it's just a puppet that's why I must be careful organization an organizational spirit now let's get past that that just showing over the RAM said it's not my word it's the Word of God now I don't know if you saw this but you see this I think I've mentioned this about the Trump administration because Satan is working through the government right to make the Word of God come to pass you don't even know if my probably doesn't know it but God used it as a tool this was from a for 2017 I took a screenshot this morning from Washington Post Trump signs order seeking to allow churches to engage and more political activity here's actual words President Trump on Thursday this would make more signed executive order making it easier for churches to participate in politics and this was a campaign pledge apparently the order removes the financial threat so they used to be threatened by tax except churches from the IRS when pastors speak on behalf of potential candidates so what could they know now a pastor can support a candidate before they couldn't they get invited if there if there are nonprofit tax zette but now churches can start backing up certain candidates order brother grant say about the rapture and not the squeeze he said this is how it happens this ecumenical move it started - it seems like it's so beautiful purpose becomes so strong politically the churches get strong politically and now the churches are getting more political influence we're living in the midst of Scripture being fulfilled that she bears pressure upon the government to cause us all to join with her either directly or through adhere to the principles enacted into law that no leaf will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council and guess what if were still alive of this happens we're gonna lose our right to have this church right we don't have any property but they'll kick us out with all the might of organization the false church turns from any vestige of truth and with political night but man keeps repeating this over and over and over in the church Facebook reinforces herself with state backing and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer but just when she's about to accomplish her comedy pot the weed is Gavin into darkness the little seat churches involved in politics and Trump is like all the image uncle's would Pat them on the back Franklin Graham Billy Graham's son back above the back you name it Mike Huckabee a preacher all these guys they're so happy he's in their church I'm not I'm saying lies he might be anointed by God Trump was what I'm saying but over all his life lined up with the word not even a chance I'm married three times he'll strip clubs at this guy but just like Cyrus right just like Darius there under an anointing a commission by God what to fulfill the wrong word of God them the word of the judgement word I'm not saying you know they are I'm not saying I don't know who say but I know their lives are reminded with the work when they cuss and smoke and swear you know drinking all kinds of things like this and cursed people come on we know better net nut tree is known by its fruit it has the fall shirts with all cunning and diabolical power made up of what political force so the churches get strong with politics physical force and demons of Darkness come against the true by the truth vying with the fullness of the Spirit sees the force of Pentecost like we've been saying the fullness of the sphere of the word would be the very acts of power that Jesus did what I promised say that man that she nears her headstone becoming like a clue the word Jesus will come that the bride agreement we heard for every night is one you like that by God's making had none of you saw today this was part of it but I never time to get this but the Supreme Court ruled today that this church this Lutheran Church I think in Missouri can now get federal funding so see before church is going to get federal funding because you have to separate church and state but the Supreme Court ruled today that they can so now church is it starting to get federal funding now look at that church and if you know anything I work in a school if the school doesn't line up with the federal government's laws the money gets cut so every school follows in line with the law but now what about the churches if the churches are going to start getting money I don't know well they know but this church is getting money and all the money is for to pay from the parking lot instead of doing a missionary trip or you know feed the bar they just want money for the parking lot Oh God have mercy don't be wrong we need good parking lots I'm thankful upon your lap but what would I have a parking lot or a missionary trip let's end the mission in government money politics becoming the charges are with me you see how God is orchestrating all this the coming Lord might be next week it might be next year you might be in 50 years inviting a hundred years but we can clearly see that churches and politics have to get more involved and churches have to have more influence with politics and they're getting it all right now we don't have time now I don't have time to go through all this so I'm just leading the highlights because like I said I had the least amount of clothes on this chapter now there is a comment in the in the Holman commentary that says this chapter is some of the most detailed prophecy in the entire it's just like Jesus's crucifixion you know they mock and they spit on him you know male stars you see his bones remember all those prophecies my God my God my self forsaken me scholars have said this is some of the most specific prophecy in the entire Bible is chapter 11 so I want to make sure I will go every day now in verse 3 we read verse 1 to the mighty king that verse three has to be out into the grate and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great Dominion and do according to his will remember there are the meats of persons the Grecian Empire hasn't come yet but a mighty king has to rise up that's got to be that kind of the great because in verse skort his kingdom is broken right and when he so stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided towards the four winds of heaven and not to his possession not his posterity so what's the his family there was four kings that took over for rulers after him nor according to his Dominion which he ruled for his kingdom shall be up even for others beside those now in verses 4 to 6 it mentions the king of the north and the King of the South now the king of the south is the Egyptian ruler this is according to history and then the king of the north is the Grecian ruler which would have been now attending the great or the Grecian Empire let me show you what I mean here this is a map of the Greek Empire okay so member of I'm not mistaken yeah Daniels right throughout it right around here now the Greek Empire is going to take over the Medes of Persians at about 100 or so years right right around 150 years by God's grace once the Greek Empire took over here Jerusalem and Daniels rocket prophecies was not the holy people so the king of the south what south of Jerusalem that's a real King Egypt the great military force what would be the king of the north there is Greek over there the Greeks are they're Macedonian and they ruled all this Empire so the king of the north would have been the Grecian Empire the king of the south would have been the Egyptian Empire so hope you can see that does that help by God's grace now brother Graham tells us in our day the king of the north is rush in our day because look how big rush is like most of this up here is Russia which is a major huge part of the Asian capital the largest part so I hope that helps there's Israel king of the north would have to bend the Greeks in the South would have been Egypt they're a great military power now I'm going to skip verses as I said verses for all the way to 20 because this has been proven historically to be Egypt the King of the South and the king of the north was the king of that was the Grecian for Greece and King house and the great and then before Kings who came off with him and so forth like I said there's a lot of history behind that now I want to skip back to verse 21 let's go through verse 21 I'm gonna start getting some quotes here and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatters and that should sound premier who's me recently preached on that in Daniel chapter 8 we looked at the Grecian Empire as well to meet some Persians now verses 21 to 31 is a compound prophesy of Antiochus 2/4 which he already went over in chapter 8 was the little horn if I remember that in those been a while if you remember we breached up a little horn I got the notice here who would eat nothing he was the little horn according to history so this ruler is the little horn this random raises up this vile person and he types the future Antichrist that we preached out of Daniel 8 verses 9 to 12 and 23 to 25 that's Antiochus now this is common how many know it's common for God to use compound prophecy never know that for example when God said out of Egypt I called my son who's that referred to three people was referred to Jacob it was referred to Egypt when Moses brought out his people on the Egypt and referred to Christ when Joseph of Mary Bach Egypt that's a compound prophecy and how about the compilot prophecies of the spirit of Elijah right the spirit of Elijah dealt with five people see how its compound the spirit of Elijah rest on Elijah John the Baptist brother Branham and that's that prophet in revelation 11 alright now this is common God using a current world ruler to type another person because this was done with the king of Tyrus who was the king of Lebanon which is in the country north of Israel in Ezekiel 28 12 through 19 remember that God told his ego that this King type Lucifer the anointed cherub that covereth remember that by God's grace or anybody wouldn't read that and would read that would you remember that okay so he talked about the king of Tyre says don't worry once we said that you must remember that good but God uses Tyrus and he types him to Satan and said you were to eat in the garden of God and you were the anointed cherub and you had pipes that coverage remember that and you'll be brought down to hell and all the nations those blundering saying was this Amana to see the nation's oh my to see God can use compound prophecy that's why we can't get this by education it's got to be by revelation in other words we need a prophet to come and tell us say for the we're gonna mix it up we're gonna try to do build a Bible School you know we'll try to go to the phd's and all that we got to go to a prophet of God that's God's always way he's done now let's read verse 31 as folks brother Graham gives us specific quotes on these two scriptures in this chick in this section here 21 we already read take the kingdom by flatteries and then 31 it's only 3:31 for me and they show please amen now I'm gonna read two quotes I have to coach her brother Graham about verse 21 that we just read and then verse 31 that were added just okay so this gives us an idea and these two quotes will show us that brother Branham used this section about Antiochus I never named Antiochus that I found yet but he used both those scriptures as a foreshadowing of the future Antichrist and that's exactly what we saw in chapter 89 all those types were foreshadowing the future Antichrist and this is what scholars agree with like I said this scholar Holman here and all the commentaries I read they'd all agree this is foreshadowing off so of the Antichrist because both hated the Jews right the rome was going to pretend to like the Jews for the first half of the of the Covenant but then they're gonna break the covenant the Bible said in Daniel chapter 9 work through that they break the code now I'm trying little nervous tonight forgive me let me try slow down here forgive me the first seal Lorena talks about Daniel 11 21 so let's kind of get into his thought never first seal so I'm a white horse rider spear the Antichrist and this spirit eventually turns into what the person of the Antichrist now he become a man in the crowd give us the first vote read and notice or read rather how daniel said he would take over the church kingdom would you like to read it we have time to read it happily all right let's go to Daniel just a moment turn back to look at Daniel will read just a moment and we won't be made another 15 let's get Daniel 11 chapter let's take the 21st verse you just read it now here's the scripture and it is a station set of a mile vs. Rome events in Rome talking to whom they shall not get the heart of the kingdom now watch but each you're coming piece of lead coming peacefully and obtain the kingdom by flatteries Laurentian this is the Antichrist that's exactly what it does what Daniel said the Antichrist would do he would fit the people's place yes a bit there menu for this day for the churches for in this church age they don't want the word Christ but they want church why'd you come here tonight you get heard for the word today I don't come here just to come to church I could go to ensure there's a lot of churches closer to my house than this church I come here because this church stands on the way if it doesn't how do you reside and get somebody here that links the right thing I believe I'm preaching the genophage yeah nobody's corrected me so somebody crack me up on that I always want to be open to God's leadership god I try to bring somebody in or pulled me out I just want to be neutral to the will of God but I believe I'm preaching the truth the first thing they don't ask you you're a Christian how many times am I to talk to people they never asked them you Christians they say what denomination what church do you belong to my church they don't want Christ the word you tell them about the word comes straight up they don't want that they want something just live any way they want to and still belong to the church and obtain their testimony see he fits there many just exactly remember he was finally called sheet in the Bible and she was the prostitute that daughter's just fits the bill of the day what the people want there it is God has promised that what the worst refused and they turned to their desires let's read those lines again now second Thessalonians 2 9 through 11 it said they went turned out they reject the truth and be given over to a reprobate mind believe a lie and be damned by it now that's what the Holy Spirit said so that lets just apply that to ourselves we have to keep constantly staying humble the presence of God the Word of God ever reveals something need to walk into and you say God if I can't wear right now help me to a baby soon yeah but we cannot say I do not I could never do that we can if we do that then that will happen to us we become a stiff starchy cold church member we got to let the Holy Spirit lead us back where Japan economy the fullness of the Spirit and the fullness of Pentecost the Upstate the Lord's gonna be in the church the true church so see me you never can never turn that down like I've asked some people to come early and pray if you can or pray more at home that's wonderful with Holy Spirit leading us to more of that more more sacrifice grace God Father that I believe he is I believe so don't let me get cold we only had that you want to give ourselves a now isn't that design of the church today you try to tell them that to do this is that the to you right quick there Methodist press they don't have to paddle in your boat certainly they wanted and God said if they want it I'll just let them have it and I'll actually make them believe it's a truth because I'll give them a reprobate mind concerning the truth now here's the quote I read the last few services remember this the born-again experience will be rejected in favor of church join the depths of Satan had enter in that age so it's wonderful that we come to church and we're members were tied bears you know we're faithful that's wonderful but we got a listing and how the Holy Spirit amen I know that simple but it's emotional affair because it will prove if we're a true Bride of Christ and the true bride of christ jesus said will be guided into all truth and I know that our truth I need to walk into and I believe you did too by God's grace we've got to walk into those now that's the one quote I can find her brother Graham closed Daniel 11 21 there's only one that I could find I searched all those words in there about person the only time he mentioned it remember he said if I ever preach anything inspired it was the 17 of us because every morning he'd go before God the angel would reveal what that interpretation was of that Scripture did you know brother Graham said those seven seals were the most anointed series of sermons he ever preached and he preached to a hundred thousand people one time and it was more anointed to sit in a room and have God show him not say the Lord every morning that was more anointed he said than saying all the miracles and blind eyes open that's me that's amazing church but why was it because an angel of God would come to him he said I stand for an hour watching the vision once it Levi be worn out he's I spend the rest of they riding it down I just saw and then making sure lined up with the body because even Angels have to be taken back to the Word of God if it ain't because you Paul said if an angel or anyone else preach anything other what I teach let it be cursed see how the scripture brother and was he saw an angel and they said I got to take that angels word back to the word if an a just go back to word how about brother Branham we got to take this one back to the word right everybody's got me thinking back to the word except Christ because he is the word right all right now now I got one quote on Daniel 11:31 and this is America the Dome of the rock will stand until God returned to - so let's go let me rehearse 31 because it's a little less per minute it's an read to us he said an arm shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary what's that that's the Jewish sanctuary that's the sanctuary Daniel of Danish people and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall place the abomination to make it desolate okay so what does that mean well that's gonna tell us after the rapture the Jews have to rebuild the temple and they have to start sacrificing animals because member they don't receive Christ until after the three and a half years of the ministry those two prophets so they're going to be sacrificing animals for three half years and they're gonna have a daily sacrifice right but once the prophets get done and they get ratcheted up all but I would think the remnant rejoices and then Christ comes back and then they're going to board from one house to another but then they'll be bored one day 144,000 feet will be filled the Holy Ghost or the rain shower that would be amen they got 120 the day of Pentecost imagine 144,000 glory amen can you imagine that church Wow - brother grant us a 1961 directly about Daniel 11:31 that's why I'm happy to preach us tonight because it's not I thought it's the prophets top it's the best I can do as a preacher has to rightly divide the word that's what Paul told Timothy so I'm right trying to rightly divide the word to you that I've heard brother Branham in Daniel 11 a lot of it chapter 30 McPherson 31st verse teachers of the day taking away the daily sacrifice and the abomination of desolation would you please explain what these are yes but then please explain them to me I don't know oh this person inside their name okay this is my subject on next Sunday comes the Daniel 70 weeks but I might just say this to you my most precious brother inside here this very dear friend to all of us yes the abominations of baby desolation Jesus in Matthew 24 spoke of it the abomination means filthiness that make a desolation abomination that was the mosque of Omar that stood on the temple grounds where the holy place stood now I preached on this in 2015 I think Bo was there when I preached it not sure you guys were there on that Sunday when I preach it but brother man is actually talking about with the Dome of the rock the mosque of Omar's in a different location it's it's a real place but he's referring to the Dome of the rock because the Dome of the rock was built on the the temple site where Solomon's Temple used to be so I know what you get your words mixed up but just so you know this actually refers to the Dome of the rock in 1896 time is actually 80 70 Titus came and captured Jerusalem and burnt the temple and they built the mosque of Omar and she means Dome of the rock the Muhammad religion right on the temple grounds and still stands there to this day and it will stand there until God returns to the Jews again in other words that no one's going to be there until sometime right by the rapture so we see that dome going down that's another sign get ready but we shouldn't feel like a pull to get ready right now hey man that's right I'm glad you so what do you do right guess if you could repair that we never supposed to God as I know Brandon and loved the Lord as much as I can go to God now I want to make it myself ready no matter what I'm not waiting for those outside signs if I see them praise God but I'm already ready right now amen I've already confessed all myself I'm trying to live close to Christ and service people amen see some people ain't you oh when I see Lausanne just go down then already don't wait for that get ready right now yeah get ready right now God make me gracious and even they allow that to happen because we have thus hid the Lord on that he may allow that to happen before the rapture but we don't know he nail out of the tent the Dome of the rock to be destroyed we don't know but we do know this that all that the father's call will be made ready and Christ won't lose one day men and so we fool the flow now that's why we're here on Wednesday night you could be home asleep you be home somewhere else you could be other part to join this nice weather but I like the spiritual either anything this is more important I could be having a meal at Applebee's I have a meal at McDonald's or some but this is the best thing I could have right here the love of God amen yes it's exactly right amen he said Jesus referred to it and said let he that readeth understands he therefore he gives so many days from that time so high for the Prince and so many days and so forth would you get the next Sunday and I'll try to the best of my knowledge to get it in for you next Sunday but the foundation is that mosque of Omar that took the place the temple that when you see the abomination to make the desolation spoken by of by Daniel the prophet Daniel standing the holy place see standing where the temple stood in the mask of all month okay so verse 31 refers to the daily sacrifice that the Jews 144,000 after the rapture will start offering but the Antichrist will come in there and stop the daily sacrifice that's what it refers to all right now let's get ahead I did those okay yeah okay I just these are some of the key words I typed in in the message just so you know there's only one bow person there's 15 flattery some of them deal with the Antichrist just a few do exploit three - I'll get to that a little bit king of the south zero hits king of the north so but I've never interpret scheme the south that's why I had to go to history to find that and it seems to line up with history now let's look at a few flatteries quotes because there's more flattery scriptures one of verse 32 and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he crumped by flatteries to see the Antichrist is gonna corrupt through flatteries whoever's against the Jewish covenant he's going to corrupt the whole world they don't see everybody hates the Jews right now have you seen that recently last month they've had a meeting of the UN and everybody hates the Jews except in the u.s. almost everybody hates the Jews and jaesuk you know he's from the is from a Christian law Association he went into her to sit up for the Jews he said we're Christians when we stand up for the Jews in America bless that guy's heart they got it filled with power I don't know what he believes but he stood up for God's people God said anybody stands up for the Jew unless that but if you stand up against something you're cursed that's right now verse 32 I didn't finish it did I didn't know anything he struck my flatteries but the people that know their God shall be strong and do exploits now this could be referring to the Jews I believe it's referred to the Jews my man who often applies it to the Gentiles so he has a little carryover but I'm not sure so I mean I'll show you the quotes on the flatteries now this is a lot I'm not going to read all this because of time Graham talks about what we preached on the lion we preached on that in Daniel chapter 8 I'm not mistaken hey Rome in other words about Rome what has done it in the kindness as he said he come in with flatteries and what has he done he bring in the prize two ecumenical council the world churches the spirit of Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to slaughter because I'm just showing you the point but brother Adam talks about flatteries he's always talking about the Antichrist deceiving the false church okay he says it get in peace to the trumpets that's the same quote isn't it yeah I got to close up my partner this was different Sardis in church age look he says preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework banana Christ be system they will give it to the flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and people will follow these false shepherds right to the slaughter I know about you but I want to be a real preacher that doesn't bow to the pressures and money and done of it right but he said all the preachers know Hanson will give in to the flatteries of the Antichrist oh we love these uh Protestant people I'll be careful be careful that puts behind him that spirit of rome's behind him at conquering spirit can I check something real quick mm-hmm I thought I had on my device where the Pope was inviting all the Protestants back do you read that from a few years ago never remember that come on oh yeah I put it on here I thought I had it on my my videos maybe not this is where well famous preacher I'm not gonna cause damage you can read it a famous preacher called everybody that he's a very influential Protestant preacher he called everybody back and said we have so much in common with the Roman Catholic Church and doesn't even know what he's doing yeah he's gotta be blood he's tell me we need to unite why don't ya I was looking for the one where the boat gave it to the Pentecostals a few years ago I played it before me was I let me see my place real quick here okay humility Pope Francis is the perfect example of this his is doing everything right you see people who listen to what we say if they like what they see and he was very very symbolic in you know his first master people AIDS is is a kissing this warm man is Columbia children this authenticity this humility the caring for the poor this is what the whole world expects us Christians to do and when we when they go oh that's what a Christian does like in fact there's a headline here in Orange County that I love that like I say that it said if you love post Francis you don't love Jesus okay so see appearing to be so humble just like Jesus well Jesus also he was humble but he is also man of power he's also man opinion out the false things in the church and clean up the temple so I just want you to show that look how and this was right when he got elected a couple of years ago I don't have to get the other one you probably member it where he invited the Pentecostal said let's be brothers again come back and be brothers but I thought I had it on my device I'm sorry I know it's on their home computer I just looked at it the other day okay sorry okay let's go back flatteries humble look uh sweetie be careful yeah verses 32 to 35 in the Holman this refers to Antiochus the fourth again he was with almost awful miss treaty was one of most awful violent leaders towards the Jews ever now the exploits in verse 32 read that they didn't know their God shall be strong and do exploits the exploits seem to refer to Judah Maccabee and his faithful Jews who ultimately defeated the armies of Antiochus and rededicated the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in 164 BC establishing the festival of Hanukkah Grob that two weeks ago when we did chapter 80 but brother Brandon getting numerous quotes about exploits referring to the new tests in the church and there's only one verse I think in the Bible that deals it experts actually I'm gonna check it out make sure exploits report Church yeah there's two okay yes they're both in Daniel 11 Daniel 1120 1130 to talk about exploits with 32 is the one we're looking at and they that know their God should be strong and do exploits so whoever now this is talked about the day that Christ he comes in my flatteries but the people that know their God should be strongly to the exploits so see I believe since this talk about the Antichrist I believe this people is the Jews I just want to know that brother Graham said the pride who exploits - I could be wrong but member of the Antichrist isn't revealed until after the holy spirit is taken out of the way remember that let's read assbutt a second Thessalonians chapter 2 so we could be at that and that's all my video the video we made on the rapture 5 reason the rapture is pre-tribulation let's go 2nd thessalonians chapter 2 Emer the holy spirit will be taken out of the way now verse 4 who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember D not that when I was with yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in this time in other words Paul says some things are gonna be Holden until the hand of Christ is revealed he exhausted himself above all it's called God he sits in the temple of God saying that he is God so easy to sit the Jewish temple saying that he's got for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so see God's gonna let all these things just move on until he me take it away speaking on the Holy Spirit because look and then show that link it be revealed just see the Holy Spirit has to be taken away the church has to be taken away then the wicked ones revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan see his powers after the work of Satan with all power and signs and look we done lying wonders watch that boat if it's not in our day it's the next generation the Pope's can have live miracles he's gonna deceive the people with lying miracles never understand that hope that's okay all right so now you're not you're good on that now let me just read these quotes so you're aware of him look around there's there's numerous close recent Brian doing exploits and we know she will the ask mother grandma questions answers is the private have great miracles before the rapture he said they're going on right now he said the big things about the moon changing the blood and islands of mountains being thrown away that's for the Jews but the regular miracles for the Jen's house they're going on right now and they're not gonna stop until the rapture ain't that mean right that's exactly right now Moran said when the church puts forth another church it'll be a Pentecostal church with the science of the acts and the Apostles doing the same thing with the same Jesus working the same because he's the same yesterday today forever a Pentecostal branch filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders of the Resurrection great things taking place yeah I'm sorry then they you know their God in the last station exploits yes we're at the end tire so see brother branham picks up Daniel 11:32 and applies it to the bride I'm just letting you know to me I feel I could be a definite apply to the product but we'd have to be battling the satanic spirit not in the form of the Antichrist we're just in our regular satanic battles you can say Satan you know the regular battles we have a Satan you know and maybe the maybe the squeeze maybe that's it maybe it could be the squeeze Oh Pam says this he said supernatural power with supernatural science or a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God amen you talk about super-move supernatural God is a supernatural body and the natural people getting supernatural signs hallelujah a super race they they that know their God shall do exploits great exploits and show supernatural signs of people Abraham's seed a sign of a supernatural Christ risen from the dead supernaturally all right I think I got the quote on there twice yeah per me okay now let me give you another abomination and daily sacrifice quote because that is verse 31 then the Christ will take away the daily sacrifice here's another one and I'm almost done the most of my God's grace everything I'm trying to short my sermons a little bit here now notice the overspreading of the abomination to make Desilu desolation the overspreading of abominations what is the foundation filthiness see to make desolate what is that to do away with the overspreading of this to do away with that see the overspreading of that Roman power to conquer all the sleeping version virgins Jews evolved with all the enrollment or it'll be nothing he'll break his covenant in the middle of the week so that's what we're talking about here in verse 31 the breaking of the daily sacrifice Rome will stop the Jews from giving their daily sacrifice and it's the overspreading of the Roman power alright so season is the rolling pile of stopping the daily sacrifice that's an abomination right okay I got a few more quotes here to just bear with me then I'm down to let me just stop and check don't wear a video okay so one two three four five six seven you handle seven more okay do something more all right thank you now verses 36 245 the commentary I read believes all this is about the future Antichrist or Pope like I said I don't I can't find time about any quotes from brother Branham on these verses 36 all the way to 45 okay just so you know I'm Connie if you find someone that me not you happy reading but they seem to connect the second Thessalonians 2:1 to 13 we already read Lee versus four five and six in there because the verses 41 to 45 scenery okay I'll give that later let's read verse 36 so let's go to Daniel 11:36 I don't have that up there but Daniel 11:36 is the one that connects to this right here I hope it's not confusing like I said I'm trying to make this as simple as possible there's only having a few quotes I'll have a few quotes the puppet I was talking about this chapter now verse 30 says Daniel 11:36 it's all like to read that for me okay thank you sir the King shall do according to as well and he showed Saul himself and magnify himself above every God and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that is determined shall be done all right no I'm gonna use up here on the screen here we see that with the Bible say verse 36 he exalts himself and magnify himself above all gods doesn't that sound just like this let no man deceive you by any means for that nation outcome except there's a falling away of the church first and the man of sin be revealed the son of destruction gotta be the Antichrist who opposes and exalts see where sees the same word exalt exalts himself above all that is called God or that has to be worshipped so that he as God sitteth the temple of God showing himself that He is God so artists ain't one do anyone's exhaust himself above the got an early look at that last week and he wants to be worshipped so the Antichrist has to come to the Jewish temple take with his sacrifice he's got to exalt himself as God that's what the Bible says it's unjust oh I hope you understand I hope that's a blessing by God's grace I know we're dealing with no prophesying serveth all these things I don't have any clothes for so I'm just doing the best I can I actually look at verse 37 to 1137 are we dead Danny 1137 I appreciate your patience I know it's a tough thing to preach on there's not a lot of background knowledge on 1137 neither shall he regard the god of his father's nor the desire of women oh that's Christ Christ to the desired women because all the Jewish women wanted to see them aside all right a virgin shall conceive all the women one to see and who was that woman in Revelation 12 the woman that brought forth the manchild and rule the nations with a rod of iron that was Christ hey that's what the stake he tried to devour remember but he was carved to heaven in the God's throne today so Christ is the desired whipping all the women all the churches all the Jews they wanted Christ on the side to come to be resting so he won't regard Christ he won't regard the god of his father's nor regarded any God he shall magnify himself above all see that it's gotta be the Antichrist because that's what 2nd Thessalonians 2 said all right almost done 5 more sides there bear with me here I'm sorry now verses 40 to 45 these all seem to refer this is a really interesting portion of scripture if you have time I encourage you greeted it seems to be all about the invasion of the Antichrist into Israel now we already talked about that he comes the temple of God he takes my did a sacrifice but this actually gives literal scripture of the Antichrist coming in to Jerusalem it's pretty amazing especially verses 41 to 45 so let's read verse 40 so let me know you go there at 11:40 there's nobody's here you see at that time of the end you see then shall the King of the South I'm not sure at this point who the King of the South is I don't know it's going to be so many southern of Israel I gotta because North is Russia so he's up and the king of the north shall come against him like a woman I we believe that's Russia at this point with chariots with horsemen with many ships and he shall enter the the countries and shall overflow and pass over he shall enter also into the glorious land what land is glorious according to the Bible and according to an angel only Jerusalem only in Israel right well worth a visit and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand even Edom Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon uh so I'm not sure where those are right now modern-day I don't know what modern-day countries those are but they boast that they don't escape the Antichrist he's to stretch forth his hand upon the countries and the land of Egypt shall not escape that makes me think Egypt might not be the king of the south at this point I don't know but he should have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of Egypt and the Libyans and Ethiopians shukkeien is his steps did brother man I'm saying that the Antichrist alone will have all the rule of all the paper money and the gold and the bonds right verse 44 but tidings out of the east and out of the North shall trouble him therefore you should go aboard with great fury to destroy and utterly to make many of turn ship - to make away many here it is where's Mordecai and he shall plant the Tabernacles of his palace between the Seas in the glorious holy mountain what's the holy mountain Mount Sinai right that's where Jerusalem that's where the Dome of the rock is right now that's the holy mountain of God so here the Antichrist is Planet planta is kingdom right there in the Holy Land muhaha mercy yet he shall come to his head and none she'll help now again I'm just using quotes from an okay let's go west I got one two three five more quotes now Russia the king of the north is in Daniel 11 for he is part for her part and arm again I'm sorry okay so the king of the north at the end of the chapter of eleven has to be Russia because no map says thus saith the Lord the Russians King in the north now Daniel was given the assurance that at the end of the Gentile dispensation I'll read when you go home read tomorrow the 11th chapter you can see how the king of the north is coming down which is nothing else but Russia comes down against Jerusalem coming down to press against it like the world and we just read that and the great battle of Armageddon will be fought right there near the gates of Jerusalem because he said no camp it's the Antichrist from camp right not by the holy mountain of God look at that Church in the scripture and that beautiful to see that by God's grace ah I just just like the Bible is becoming more and more clear all the time amen this is not our thought it's a vindicating property everybody else you loves the Pope and so get their interpretations can't be right they don't have a property they don't have enough seats the Lord you've got it by God's pigs next quote now just a couple more for now this is from the church age book I think I preached on this the time already through the fourth church age for 3 and 1/2 years while the retributive wrath of God is poured out she will be in the great marriage supper then who is that we believe that sups the New Testament church then when then will he return leaving his bride in the father's house well he makes himself known to his brother at this very time the Antichrist covenant that the Jews have made with Rome will be broken roll and her allies then send their troops to destroy all the god-fearing word abiding Jews so we have the Antichrist camped out in Jerusalem and then the king of the north comes down to oh we're gonna top this church but as they come again the city what the Jewish City we just read it the holy city the glorious land right the holy mountain of God amen as they gonna get the city to destroy there will appear in the heavens the sign of the coming of the Son of Man and with his mighty armies to destroy that who have been destroying the earth with the enemy repulse Jesus then comes and presents himself to the 144,000 having seen his mighty acts of salvation they have come to know his power but also seeing his wounds annoying that they have rejected him even at that moment he even to that moment rather causes them to cry out in having him to tear and feared even as did their brethren of old when they stood before Joseph being so afraid that they would be killed but as Joseph said don't be angry with yourselves it's all right God was in it all he did it to preserve life even so will Jesus speak peace and love to them a man not that by God's grace but man taught us Rome is coming to Israel so is Russia and the Bible says it as well let us say to our feet I got two more quotes never I got two we have 2000 Laura's on on Israel two of them - here's the first one and so what we talked about briefly but man tells us we have less a DeLorean Gabrus instruction and Daniel a confederation of church will consolidate them together and bring the Jews in this Confederation and bring them back to their own temple worship again in the thus saith the Lord on the Bible and they will have their own church see there's got to be a Jewish temple built on that Temple Mount it's got to be rebuilt and they've got a daily sacrifice because the Antichrist has to take away the daily sacrifice and overspread his abomination over that temple that's what the Bible said they are what now I just taught it just no fresh there now a nation recognizes that right but they have not their temple worship yet and when they establish the temple worship the church will be gone oh my god we do anything deal with the Jews as the nation here's the last quote so bear with me thank you for your patience tonight and then I think we should have some prayer forever they let me believe that I think we just maybe they had some pray ask God strength that's what I'd won if I was hurt like him I want something great for me so just let's get ready for that he was instruction again that's why I tried to tell this brother sitting over here let's talk about going to Israel stay away from Israel you said about Gentiles going to Israel try to win souls stay away from them are you people I talk about converting the Jews before this message you'll see it thus saith the lord by word and by spirit Israel be converted over the whole nation in one night the Bible said some of the Gospels not even today program said thus say the Lord stay away from there because they'll get changed when Jesus reveals themselves now I'm number this though - there's a few renegades that's out there and then that's out there like that and committed and outside the main body of Jews coming to get safe that's true but at least there's Jews that are not Israel that will get saved in the bride but we're not to take the gospel to the Jews because the two witnesses are there to do that God even saw brother Branham from doing that right so he says it's us doesn't know they're gonna rebuild that temple and the state the Lord stay away let God's two prophets and let Christ reveal himself reported four thousand members well as how other nation that cannot be saved okay let's stop right there the Lord and I need a Mac amen appreciate that now chapter 12 is real short it's only 13 verses I don't know if we'll get to that Sunday or next week but are you joined Daniel I just I got all the quotes so if I need to go back and review it or add something if you all if you've all Leslie you listen to it take you next week and you find the court I miss share with me we'll put it right in there the Lord tarries for the next generation praise God because that's what we're doing we're storing up well Graham said if Christ don't govern our day we're supposed to leave footprints on the sands of time for the next generation to follow crazy land I'm 36 years old I might have 30 more years of reaching gospel if God terry's the end of God and it lets movie after that would be too old and if God carries that mob somebody else to preach the same revelation brother Branham preached to teach us the truth of God's Word and so what do we do is just throwing it up we're leaving the footprints perhaps in the Ramson I want to be a pastor he says God will raise up another pastor we got to leave these footprints in the sands of time aren't you glad amen I just trust God bless you for your patience and your and your attendance tonight by the grace of the board all right let's just sing a song here before we pray for our brother this pray for good god use which thank you sir
