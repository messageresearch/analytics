[5:30] that passes all understanding especially
[5:33] in this time a corona virus were
[5:34] thankful for the peace of Jesus Christ
[5:37] it's the only real peace in this world
[5:39] and thank God for the Holy Spirit that
[5:42] gives us that peace when lord winning
[5:45] tonight would like to look at part two
[5:47] little Bible study on the mystery of
[5:51] godliness restored a man so I just want
[5:58] to briefly review for a moment here what
[6:04] we covered on Wednesday just real real
[6:06] quick we'll try to be real careful with
[6:10] the time here tonight by God's grace so
[6:16] this mystery is talked about in first
[6:19] Timothy 3:16 that's the location of the
[6:22] mystery Paul calls it a great mystery
[6:25] this is a great mystery and then brother
[6:28] Graham tells us it's the mystery of
[6:30] godliness being restored to man
[6:32] so how man how sinful man can become
[6:36] godly like God the Greek definition was
[6:41] loyal faithful devoted so we want to be
[6:45] like God we want to be faithful like God
[6:47] and Jesus says we can be therefore
[6:51] perfect as our Father which is in heaven
[6:54] is perfect
[6:55] and so God makes a way for us to
[6:59] come into godliness and we found that
[7:03] the way to get there is through slow
[7:05] steady growth just like a plant just
[7:08] like a baby Jesus increased in wisdom
[7:14] and stature and in favor with God and
[7:18] man according to Luke chapter 2 so we
[7:21] saw a good example of that
[7:24] a perfect example and then we talked
[7:27] about the confusion with this mystery
[7:29] the confusion is how much human effort
[7:31] is required and is it is godliness even
[7:34] attainable and the answer is yes it
[7:38] isn't obtainable and the answer to how
[7:42] much human effort is all of it because
[7:45] it's based upon free more agency and so
[7:49] the proof of that is where Jesus gives
[7:50] the greatest commandment to love the
[7:53] Lord your God with all your heart soul
[7:54] mind and strength praise God and then
[7:58] love your neighbor as yourself and this
[8:03] is understood of course when you
[8:05] understand that all works are motivated
[8:08] by either worldly love or godly love and
[8:12] that's according to Jesus jesus said the
[8:17] condemnation has come because some men
[8:19] love darkness more than light so you
[8:21] either love light and gravitate toward
[8:23] light you do works because you love the
[8:26] light or you do works because you love
[8:28] darkness and based upon that choice
[8:31] God gives either person he God God gives
[8:34] each person either eternal life with him
[8:35] or eternal separation from him because
[8:41] if no if no effort is required that
[8:44] everybody would be saved and we know
[8:45] that's not the case
[8:47] humans have to decide they have to
[8:50] surrender their will they have to
[8:53] receive grace we know faith is a gift of
[8:57] God according to Ephesians chapter 2
[9:00] verses 8 to 10 it is a gift of God but
[9:03] just like with any gift you have to
[9:05] receive it if someone tries to give you
[9:07] a gift and you turn it down well that's
[9:08] you lost out on that that's your loss
[9:11] that was your choice
[9:12] so it's the same with God God gives us
[9:16] these these great gifts he offers these
[9:18] great gifts and we got to be willing to
[9:20] accept them with a humble heart and of
[9:24] course when we see God's goodness we see
[9:27] as gifts makes us fall in love with the
[9:29] Lord and serve the Lord with all of our
[9:32] hearts so it cannot there can be no
[9:37] accusation to legalism because legalism
[9:39] adds to the word and everything about
[9:41] becoming like God is in the word because
[9:46] we're not to add or take away and the
[9:49] Bible says when you really love God the
[9:50] love of God is shed in your heart or so
[9:53] God gives you his love to help you obey
[9:58] the Word of God which is a tremendous
[10:00] gift from the Lord and we ended
[10:03] Wednesday by looking at Peter and Paul
[10:08] admonishing us to be holy to strive for
[10:14] all godliness Paul said seek for all
[10:17] godliness
[10:18] so all maturity and then Peter says
[10:24] knowing that fire is coming so Peter
[10:26] gives us a fiery warning knowing that
[10:29] fire is coming we need to be living in
[10:32] all holy conversation and godliness okay
[10:35] and now we like to look at some teaching
[10:40] on mature godliness because we know
[10:43] there's two kinds of godliness just like
[10:45] there's two kinds of Christians just
[10:47] like there's two kinds of feelings of
[10:49] the Holy Ghost ones in the spirit the
[10:51] other ones in the soul there's two kinds
[10:56] of faith right so there's two kinds of
[11:00] godliness so st. Paul
[11:03] he gives us five yeah st. Paul gives us
[11:08] five texts on godliness which is quite a
[11:11] few and Lord willing we'll look at each
[11:14] one of those tonight I got some faithful
[11:16] Bible readers over here some of my
[11:18] disciples over here which I'm thankful
[11:22] my arrows they're my arrows over here my
[11:24] children
[11:25] so I'm thankful just trying to keep him
[11:27] sharp you know read the word keep him
[11:29] singing thank God for all that they do
[11:31] for sweet little arrows it's one day
[11:35] Lord willing we'll shoot them out and
[11:38] they'll overcome
[11:40] they'll overcome by God's grace no hit
[11:42] God's target so let's look at the five
[11:49] texts that Paul uses now this is for
[11:53] mature godliness
[11:56] then let me see if we'll get and if we
[11:59] have time maybe we'll start on Peters
[12:03] godliness before you're born again which
[12:06] that begins the look into the statue of
[12:09] a perfect man so Lord willing we'll do
[12:13] that tonight and we'll try to just go
[12:14] like we did last week until 5:00 so
[12:17] let's get our Bibles ready got your
[12:20] Bibles and let's start with Titus
[12:23] chapter one so Lydia when we start with
[12:26] you
[12:26] Liddy's gonna retighten one and then
[12:28] Malachi first Timothy 2:1 so Titus 1:1
[12:33] and first Timothy 2:1 acacia first
[12:36] Timothy 4:7 so Titus 1 1 first Timothy 2
[12:42] 1 and then first Timothy 4:7 so it's
[12:50] very it's very very fitting that Paul
[12:55] gives us the most teaching on godliness
[12:57] because he's the one that received the
[13:00] revelation from Jesus Christ that God
[13:02] was going to restore godliness to man
[13:04] great is the mystery of godliness and of
[13:09] course we see godliness through the life
[13:11] of Jesus Christ God slowly added more
[13:14] and more of his anointing more and more
[13:16] of his favor and of course Jesus Christ
[13:20] was the epitome of purity beauty
[13:25] holiness godliness anything desired was
[13:31] Jesus Christ our example praise God our
[13:36] Savior our high priest our all in all
[13:38] praise God so Lydia if just start with
[13:41] Titus 1 and we'll read verses 1 and 2
[13:45] [Music]
[13:54] God that cannot lie
[13:58] promise amen so Paul of course is
[14:02] writing to Titus a faithful pastor and
[14:06] pause saying he's a servant according to
[14:10] the faith of God's elect and the
[14:13] acknowledging according to the
[14:15] acknowledging of the truth which is
[14:17] after godliness okay so after means
[14:23] according to so the truth is according
[14:25] to godliness so the truth promotes
[14:30] godliness the Word of God promotes
[14:33] godliness so when you are living the
[14:37] truth and obeying the truth then you
[14:42] will live a godly life so there's only
[14:47] one path to godliness it's through the
[14:49] truth remember jesus said John 17 John 7
[14:53] 2000 17:17 sanctify them through thy
[14:56] truth thy Word is truth
[14:58] so it's acknowledging the truth which is
[15:01] according to godliness okay so let Mel
[15:08] Kai first Timothy 2 verses 1 2 & 3 made
[15:18] for all men for kings and for all that
[15:20] are in authority that we may lead a
[15:22] quiet and peaceable life in all
[15:23] godliness and honesty this is good
[15:28] praise God what a beautiful text Paul
[15:31] writes so Paul said it pleases God if we
[15:37] live a quiet and peaceable life in all
[15:42] godliness so we want to point that out
[15:46] all godliness is obtainable you know I
[15:49] was thinking right before we went online
[15:50] I was thinking about that
[15:51] all godliness is attainable I thought
[15:53] yeah that's right I said even the Old
[15:55] Testament you know as much godliness as
[15:57] was available in the Old Testament Moses
[16:00] had it he was living so godly that
[16:03] Pharaoh
[16:03] kicked him out of Egypt you know he was
[16:06] so obedient to the Holy Spirit and the
[16:09] ange of the Lord and brother Adam uses
[16:12] that you know why cry speak about Moses
[16:15] living so close to God in bromances we
[16:19] can live so close to God where a Satan
[16:22] doesn't know what to do with us and so
[16:25] that's one example there and obviously
[16:27] you know it's all based upon you know a
[16:31] person's dedication like it's possible
[16:34] for a young person to have all godliness
[16:36] because it's a it's a state of obedience
[16:39] and that's in Scripture remember Paul
[16:42] told Timothy he said let no man despise
[16:44] thy youth he said but be the example in
[16:49] faith and charity and love and all those
[16:53] spiritual attributes so Paul's telling
[16:55] Timothy you can be a you can be a
[17:00] Christian who walks in all godliness and
[17:07] so even in the context I want to just
[17:10] point out too when we live a life of
[17:12] godliness we pray for our leaders we
[17:15] should pray for the President the Vice
[17:16] President the Senators there were
[17:18] representatives and then our state
[17:20] governors especially during this time I
[17:22] mean my God's making it so clear we need
[17:25] to pray for these people and that
[17:28] pleases God I want to just show those
[17:31] two things it godliness is attainable
[17:33] within living godly and just praying for
[17:37] all men God sees that as such a godly
[17:42] life so we don't want to settle for a
[17:46] partial godliness right we don't want to
[17:48] setup for a partial so we know Paul says
[17:51] we can have all godliness so our whole
[17:54] lives can be you'll reverent to the Lord
[17:57] our whole lives can be loyal to the Lord
[18:00] our church is very blessed we have a
[18:02] very loyal church you know everybody's
[18:04] always there you know
[18:05] a lot of people livestream in here
[18:06] tonight and everybody's always there
[18:08] almost every Sunday such a loyalty and
[18:12] that's godly you know that's God's
[18:14] faithful to us right every morning Sun's
[18:16] up right it's hiding behind the clouds
[18:18] so we want to be faithful like God is
[18:22] faithful we want to be we want to be
[18:27] loyal we want to be obedient to the
[18:29] things of God
[18:30] it's obtainable so let's do it by God's
[18:32] grace let's continue to live that way
[18:36] all right
[18:38] next occations gonna read 1st timothy 4
[18:41] 7 and 8 for the third text on godliness
[18:57] [Music]
[19:05] [Music]
[19:07] heavy promise of the life that now is
[19:13] amen thank you sweetie what a beautiful
[19:17] text here from Paul my goodness it's so
[19:21] beautiful and remember this is a few
[19:22] just to shoot a few short verses after
[19:25] he defined the mystery of godliness and
[19:28] basically identified it for us we would
[19:31] not have known it so thank God he gave
[19:33] it to Paul but just a few verses after
[19:37] he talks about the mystery of godliness
[19:40] he explains how it's how its received
[19:44] and like we saw earlier how Jesus
[19:47] obtained a little bit at a time so Paul
[19:50] gives us another another clue and it's
[19:54] exercise I know everybody the church
[19:55] loves the exercise right yeah yeah my
[20:00] children knew they loved to run outside
[20:01] and exercise but Paul says spiritual
[20:04] exercise brings godliness so if you want
[20:11] to be healthy physically you got to
[20:13] exercise you want to be healthy
[20:14] spiritually you got to exercise your
[20:17] mind
[20:17] your mind
[20:19] on the things of God notice Paul heavily
[20:23] heavily rebukes exercising our minds in
[20:28] fiction okay because he says do not give
[20:35] yourself to profane and old wives fables
[20:38] so see see how important that is now
[20:42] Christian fiction will be okay because
[20:43] they teach you lessons like our kids
[20:45] like the Lamplighter series and there's
[20:47] other good fiction stories but Paul's
[20:51] saying profane so anything that has you
[20:54] know fornication murder you know
[20:58] abominations all those things anything
[21:01] you watched it's fiction or listen to be
[21:04] very very careful make sure it glorifies
[21:06] the Lord because people sometimes I say
[21:09] I want to break you know I need to just
[21:11] get my mind to break and so they listen
[21:13] to things they shouldn't be listening to
[21:17] or they'll watch things they shouldn't
[21:18] watch and Paul says don't give yourself
[21:22] to that because then you're you're
[21:23] you're not exercising you're getting
[21:25] weaker right you're getting spiritual
[21:29] atrophy I guess is the word to say right
[21:31] because if you don't use your muscles
[21:32] they get atrophy so they used to be
[21:35] strong but they get weaker so the same
[21:37] thing is with our mind if we don't watch
[21:40] the right things if we don't meditate on
[21:42] the right things we get weaker but Paul
[21:46] says spiritual exercise is the way to
[21:50] become godly beautiful scripture
[21:53] physical exercise prophets a little
[21:56] right that's why we don't give a whole
[21:59] lot of time to physical exercise and
[22:00] there's a little bit of a benefit but
[22:03] not too much so what's interesting is
[22:08] you know the way to exercise your mind
[22:10] is to do our memory verse right this
[22:12] sister Naomi gave us when you repeatedly
[22:16] think about good things true things
[22:18] honest things pure lovely virtuous and
[22:22] praiseworthy and then the Bible says you
[22:30] know you'll have the peace of God
[22:32] so that's how you set your affections on
[22:36] things above and then a final result is
[22:39] your spiritual transformation so if you
[22:41] want to be godly you got to exercise
[22:42] your mind you gotta work your mind to go
[22:45] to the right thing meditate on that's
[22:48] why I love writing books or writing
[22:49] scripts for YouTube videos I just love
[22:51] meditation want to meditate on it go
[22:53] over again and again and again that's
[22:55] spiritual exercise home by the way that
[23:00] video yesterday we released about
[23:01] William branham's absolute is doing
[23:04] really good we've already got like 36
[23:05] comments on it and people are very
[23:07] thankful for it they're sharing it with
[23:09] people I've had two or three people tell
[23:11] me they're gonna share with people that
[23:12] either go to Jeffersonville or you know
[23:17] know people that are kind of caught up
[23:18] in the false doctrine so that you know
[23:22] that video like all the other ones are
[23:23] just it's just a product of meditating
[23:25] you know your mind on and exercising it
[23:29] on the things that are true and pure and
[23:31] right and holy and then the result is
[23:35] spiritual transformation godliness
[23:37] praise God because you accept God's
[23:41] truth right you love God's truth so you
[23:44] just meditate on it and you slowly grow
[23:48] into a more godly life because you're
[23:52] exercising yourself in it okay I'll read
[23:56] the next one because it's the longest
[24:03] maybe not we'll see here I understand it
[24:10] may be the longest so first Timothy 6
[24:13] verses 3 to 12 yeah so I guess I wrote
[24:17] that this would this seemed to be the
[24:18] most the most thorough teaching on
[24:21] godliness which is interesting you know
[24:24] Paul identifies godliness in chapter 3
[24:27] verse 16 hits on it in first Timothy
[24:30] chapter 4 which in case you just read
[24:32] and then now he goes in this huge
[24:35] portion all on godliness
[24:37] so our spiritual here should be really
[24:41] tuned in to this context right here
[24:46] so just in these nine or ten verses
[24:48] first Timothy six three to twelve Paul
[24:52] mentions godliness four times so you can
[24:55] see this is the theme that Paul is
[24:59] focusing on so here again he says the
[25:04] doctrine of Jesus Christ is according to
[25:06] godliness so it's after godliness and
[25:11] then he warns of false teachers who are
[25:15] saying that financial gain is a sign of
[25:17] godliness
[25:18] that's a tough lesson for us in America
[25:22] many times but just because people get
[25:25] more money doesn't mean they're living
[25:27] more godly and Paul even had to warn
[25:29] them you know in these days just because
[25:33] people are getting richer doesn't mean
[25:35] they're living more godly remember
[25:39] godliness is member t.j.s
[25:43] so a lot of times you know we don't see
[25:45] people's daily lives right people we
[25:51] just sometimes see people on Sunday or
[25:52] Wednesday and my oh they're getting more
[25:54] money or they tell they got some better
[25:55] clothes or they got a better car we
[25:58] don't see their daily lives but God is
[26:01] the one who sees our daily lives and we
[26:05] want to live in such a way where we're
[26:06] always living in a in a genuine state
[26:09] you know people see our genuine love our
[26:11] genuine devotion for God you want to
[26:14] live that way but a lot of people are
[26:17] saying oh you know if your godly you're
[26:19] gonna you're gonna be real blessed
[26:21] financially now there's a truth like you
[26:24] know with ties and offerings you know
[26:25] God promise you God God says prove me
[26:28] see if I won't do it if you pay tithes
[26:31] and offerings I'll open up the windows
[26:32] of heaven and pour out a blessing which
[26:34] you can't receive I found that to be
[26:36] true I know that with all my heart and
[26:39] we go through seasons of less and more
[26:44] but the you know the prosperity gospel
[26:47] was popular obviously in Paul's day too
[26:49] people said oh if you're godly then you
[26:52] gotta have a lot of money remember
[26:54] that's one reason why demas I remembered
[26:56] it this time right Dimas left Paul
[27:00] because he had cares for the the present
[27:02] world so Paul tells us to withdraw
[27:08] ourselves from anyone who's preaching
[27:13] the prosperity gospel you know God does
[27:18] not promise riches to the godly because
[27:21] true Christians are seeking spiritual
[27:24] prosperity right godliness peace love
[27:27] patience all those spiritual attributes
[27:30] you can buy you just you can't buy you
[27:34] can't hide it at home right you know you
[27:36] got a where you got a you gotta have the
[27:38] real treasure gonna have treasure in
[27:40] earthen vessels right so Paul lays this
[27:48] out this is the portion that has the
[27:50] love of money is the root of all evil
[27:52] and people that try to get rich they
[27:56] pierced themselves through with many
[27:57] sorrows so people hurt themselves just
[28:04] like Paul you know was told by Jesus why
[28:06] are you kicking against the pricks why
[28:08] are you hurting your own spiritual state
[28:10] because he was persecuting Christians
[28:12] well here the same thing happens with
[28:14] the sin of loving money you Pierce
[28:19] yourselves through like they're doing
[28:20] damage to themselves they're hurting
[28:23] themselves we don't want to hurt
[28:24] ourselves we want to help ourselves
[28:26] right you want to let God help us
[28:29] because we know he does all things for
[28:31] our good only always as we saw this
[28:34] morning and Deuteronomy everything God
[28:36] plans for us and commands us to do we'll
[28:40] always be for our good so I guess I'll
[28:47] just read this cuz it's a longer portion
[28:49] godliness with contentment is great gain
[28:54] for we brought nothing in this world and
[28:56] a certain we can carry nothing out
[28:59] having Fugit food and raiment let us
[29:01] there with be content but they that will
[29:06] be rich fall into temptation and a snare
[29:08] into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[29:11] which drown men in destruction
[29:13] in addition so it's like a drowning so
[29:21] you know so an addiction is kind of like
[29:24] a drowning right people drown their
[29:25] sorrows you know an alcohol or even drug
[29:30] addiction for the love of money is the
[29:33] root of all evil while which while some
[29:35] coveted after they have erred from the
[29:37] faith and pierced themselves through
[29:40] with many sorrows but Thou O man of God
[29:43] flee these things so can I say this o
[29:46] man of God o daughter of God if you're
[29:48] listening flee from those things don't
[29:51] don't run to people that are lovers of
[29:57] money
[29:58] he said fight the good fight of faith
[30:03] obviously loving money is gonna hurt
[30:05] your faith because you're gonna trust in
[30:07] the money more than you trust in God to
[30:11] fight the good fight he said lay a hold
[30:12] of eternal life whereunto thou art also
[30:16] called and as professed a good
[30:18] profession before many witnesses so see
[30:24] when you live godly you live godly in
[30:27] front of everybody and so everybody that
[30:29] comes in contact with you sees your
[30:32] godliness they see your holiness and so
[30:37] then on the on the day of judgement you
[30:39] know one way able to rise up and say oh
[30:41] this person to do that you know unless
[30:44] of course you didn't have a chance to
[30:45] apologize remember Jesus when we confess
[30:49] that Jesus puts everything under the
[30:51] blood and we're forgiven of all our
[30:55] transgressions so in other words always
[31:00] remember that you're fighting to obtain
[31:03] godliness it's going to be a fight
[31:07] against your sin sin Nate you're right
[31:09] your human will it's gonna be a fight
[31:11] against your human will and sin nature
[31:17] so one way you know you're growing in
[31:19] godliness is you are content with the
[31:23] things that you have and you're not
[31:26] always long
[31:28] for the things of the world alright so
[31:31] our fifth teaching the last one is in
[31:34] Paul's last letter so it's second
[31:36] Timothy 3:1 217 second Timothy 3:1 217
[31:53] now of course we're not gonna read all
[31:55] this but I'll just read from my
[31:57] meditations here this was his final
[32:01] letter before he died as a martyr
[32:05] fulfilling his destiny you know what God
[32:07] called him to do that was his destiny to
[32:09] suffer great things for Christ's sake
[32:13] and so while he while he prophesized
[32:18] Paul he lists 18 sinful attributes that
[32:22] men will exhibit while having a form of
[32:26] godliness and these are in the days of
[32:30] perilous times which are dangerous
[32:32] spiritual conditions in the last days so
[32:38] let me read them again
[32:38] covetousness pride unthankfulness
[32:44] boastful and there's many more there's
[32:49] many more I didn't list all of them but
[32:51] then he said these striking words we
[32:53] need to catch this here he said they
[32:55] have a form of godliness and that means
[32:58] a shape of godliness the mere form or
[33:02] the mere outward image of something but
[33:05] not the inward image so see Satan Satan
[33:12] tricks the masses into having a hollow
[33:16] experience with God it's not a sin a
[33:19] real genuine solid experience with God
[33:22] because Paul calls it a form which is a
[33:24] hollow a hollow experience
[33:35] and he does this by training them to
[33:38] love sin rather than righteousness you
[33:44] know I just wrote some examples that
[33:45] people can see if you look at the life
[33:48] of the Pharisees they faithfully
[33:50] attended church on the Sabbath they
[33:52] faithfully paid their tithes and
[33:53] offerings right no doubt they spent a
[34:00] lot of time in their devotions they had
[34:03] their Mishnah which was a book about
[34:06] rabbi traditions and they they kept the
[34:09] tradition jesus said you made the
[34:11] traditions greater than the commandments
[34:14] of God and because of that you made the
[34:15] commandments of God a none effect so
[34:18] their own traditions they studied their
[34:20] own traditions more than the Word of God
[34:22] that's why we got to preach on
[34:24] Philippians right Ephesians Galatians
[34:27] and so I've got to preach on that so we
[34:29] know what Paul said so we don't make our
[34:33] own false idea what the gospel is but
[34:38] live the real apostolic doctrine and
[34:41] life so Jesus describes them they're
[34:51] beautiful on the outside but in word he
[34:53] says they're full of extortion excess
[34:57] hypocrisy and iniquity so modern day
[35:02] Pharisees are the same they have a form
[35:04] outwardly they might go to church pay
[35:07] their ties but inwardly they're not
[35:11] loyal as they should be they're not
[35:13] faithful and these are the same that I
[35:16] remember our coverage is pride
[35:17] unthankful unholy all those things that
[35:20] Paul mentioned this is a form of
[35:22] godliness so we don't want a hollow
[35:27] experience with God we don't want to be
[35:31] a hollow example we want to be a solid
[35:34] real example of Christianity and that
[35:39] what people see on the outside is really
[35:40] what we have on the inside
[35:52] and so remember Church this is what Paul
[35:55] tells us he said this is the last day so
[35:57] it specifically for our age a hollow
[36:01] godliness impulsive these preachers that
[36:03] are teaching this hollow godliness will
[36:07] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[36:11] deceived so this I think that's verse 13
[36:14] second Timothy 3:13 because of this
[36:19] these trouble is troublesome dangerous
[36:22] spiritual times the preachers will
[36:25] create more and more deception and it
[36:29] makes the people Hollow they don't have
[36:31] any real substance right faith is a
[36:34] substance there it is phrase God they
[36:36] don't really have the faith faith cometh
[36:38] by hearing the word so the preachers
[36:41] will inject their own thoughts instead
[36:43] of preaching the Word of God and so true
[36:51] godliness of course that is living
[36:53] selflessly not in Pride as he said not
[36:57] in covetousness not wanting what other
[36:59] people have not in unthankfulness but
[37:02] thankfulness you you're genuinely
[37:04] thankful for all that God has done for
[37:06] you and you're on your way to godliness
[37:08] praise God so Paul says if you live in
[37:12] these things and you continue in the
[37:14] Holy Scriptures they'll make you wise
[37:16] unto salvation which is through faith in
[37:19] Christ Jesus amen
[37:21] beautiful the member church now let me
[37:25] just say this I wrote this on my notes
[37:27] from Wednesday this is all after you're
[37:30] born again right this the same before
[37:33] you're born again this is but after
[37:35] you're born again so after you're born
[37:37] again you know children we're gonna in
[37:39] Saints we're gonna have to battle to not
[37:42] long for the things of the world and
[37:44] love money we're have to crucify those
[37:46] things and find real godliness with
[37:50] contentment to be great gain
[37:55] okay so we'll go to the next thought
[37:58] here I got about twenty minutes so we'll
[38:01] try to we'll get into Peter steps to
[38:04] godliness and Booth begin the stature of
[38:07] a perfect man looks like some of this
[38:13] will be review but it's really good to
[38:14] go over it and see it again so now we'll
[38:19] move on to Peter steps to the initial
[38:22] godliness so the first godliness before
[38:25] you're born again I guess we could call
[38:28] the first godliness in the second
[38:29] godliness I guess we could do that and
[38:34] the same would be true right with
[38:35] baptism only gauche you have the first
[38:37] filling the spirit and then the second
[38:39] is filling the soul I guess you could
[38:42] say that now notice after after Christ
[38:48] anoints Paul to give us the main text on
[38:51] godliness after you're born again you
[38:55] know God anoints Peter to give us the
[38:57] main text on godliness before you're
[38:59] born again and then it's beautiful as
[39:03] you know Christ gives Peter all the
[39:07] steps to get to godliness
[39:09] this is what I just believe is so
[39:10] beautiful about the statue of a perfect
[39:13] man like you can know where you are with
[39:15] God at any time just like the Israel
[39:19] could say we're by Kadesh Barnea or
[39:21] we're by we're on Mount Sinai just like
[39:25] Israel could say that or we're on the
[39:28] east side of Jordan like the half tribe
[39:31] of manasseh right they they want to be
[39:32] on the east side of Jordan rather than
[39:34] entering in they could know exactly
[39:37] where they stood right I don't because
[39:39] they're on a map or they knew the map
[39:41] the geography well so can we know
[39:44] spiritually where we are with the Lord
[39:46] because God gives us the steps coming to
[39:49] godliness and then born again and then
[39:52] as we go into godliness the mature
[39:56] godliness so this is found of course in
[40:00] 2nd Peter 1 1 to 15 there's or I'm sure
[40:07] there's 8 paper
[40:09] there's eight portions of spiritual
[40:13] character that we must mature into and
[40:18] godliness is the sixth one right because
[40:21] you have faith virtue knowledge
[40:23] temperance patience godliness to
[40:24] godliness is the sixth attribute of
[40:28] Christian character we want to manifest
[40:32] now this was a new thought I didn't have
[40:34] until I wrote this book and meditated on
[40:36] it Jesus gave Peter both the keys to the
[40:39] kingdom and the steps for godliness I
[40:42] thought that was pretty awesome so you
[40:47] know the book of Acts shows how Peter
[40:49] took the keys of the kingdom and opened
[40:51] up the baptism of the Holy Ghost to Jews
[40:53] Samaritans and Gentiles and then here
[40:59] you know God gives Peter the steps to
[41:01] get to the kingdom right the steps to
[41:04] the kingdom so he had the keys to get
[41:07] them into the kingdom that the baptism
[41:09] Holy Ghost but he also had the steps on
[41:11] to get them to the kingdom so I thought
[41:16] that was a beautiful beautiful thought
[41:19] you know and design that's a beautiful
[41:22] design by Jesus Christ to give Peter
[41:24] both of those the steps to the keys and
[41:28] then the keys to get them in to the
[41:30] kingdom of God okay so these eight steps
[41:35] are God adding a portion or measure of
[41:39] His divine nature to each Christians
[41:43] spiritual character because Peter says
[41:46] that he says you are partaker of the
[41:48] divine nature so let's read that let's
[41:51] go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 Lydia can you
[41:54] get Romans 12:3
[42:08] Alki feedings to eight so I'm gonna get
[42:15] second Peter chapter one that is gonna
[42:17] get Romans 12 Malachi is gonna get
[42:19] visions 2:8 so I want you to see this
[42:25] that to get to the first godliness the
[42:29] Lord has to give you a portion of his
[42:31] divine nature and you might say we might
[42:38] even say it's the daily bread right give
[42:40] us this day our daily bread a portion
[42:44] that we can take it and buy it we can
[42:49] grow up into something something greater
[42:53] in God's eyes okay so I'm gonna read
[42:58] verse 3 and 4 2nd Peter 1 3 and 4
[43:05] according at his as his divine power
[43:08] hath given unto us all things that
[43:11] pertain unto life and godliness through
[43:15] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[43:16] to glory and virtue so see there's
[43:22] another scripture that says we have no
[43:23] excuse why we can't get to godliness cuz
[43:26] he's given us all things that pertain to
[43:28] life and godliness verse 4 whereby are
[43:33] given unto us exceeding great and
[43:34] precious promises how do we get there
[43:36] the promise of God believing the promise
[43:40] that by these you might be partakers of
[43:43] the divine nature praise God having
[43:47] escaped the corruption that is in the
[43:49] world through lust
[43:51] so you've escaped the corruption of the
[43:54] world so that means you've come to the
[43:56] incorruptible Word of God as Peter he
[43:59] also says that and then God gives us a
[44:02] promise and we must believe it right
[44:05] just like with Abraham God gave him a
[44:06] promise but then he got to go act on it
[44:09] so God does the same for us he promises
[44:12] his faith and virtue and knowledge and
[44:14] baptism Holy Ghost but
[44:16] then we have to accept it and then act
[44:18] on it so what is the statue from man
[44:25] it's God giving you and I a portion of
[44:28] his nature and his character that we can
[44:33] become more like Christ and one of the
[44:36] sixth one is godliness but then after
[44:38] you're born again broadly kindness
[44:40] charity then after that you're
[44:42] constantly growing and grace and
[44:45] knowledge and loyalty to the Lord's that
[44:47] you can obtain a fully surrendered life
[44:50] a life in all godliness paul says okay
[44:54] so Lidia Romans 12:3 another word
[45:00] another phrase we might call this divine
[45:03] nature is a measure so this is what
[45:06] Lidia is gonna read for us now spiritual
[45:09] measure
[45:22] alright so Paul tells us to be sober and
[45:25] humble because each of us have a measure
[45:27] not we don't have an immeasurable amount
[45:29] of faith we have a measurable Christ
[45:33] would have had access to that right
[45:35] immeasurable faith but Paul says be
[45:39] humble you've got a certain measure
[45:41] right we can see it you know amongst
[45:42] ourselves and other churches you know
[45:44] some people have a measure of maybe
[45:47] maybe like a gift of the maybe a gift of
[45:51] the holy spirit you know for miracles
[45:54] maybe speaking in tongues or prophecy or
[45:56] faith they have a certain measure of it
[46:00] it's given by God right so Paul's the
[46:05] one who gives this idea of God giving
[46:08] man a measure of his own character then
[46:14] we saw that with Jesus he grew in grace
[46:16] and knowledge of the Lord and so Peter
[46:22] gives us the list we know faith is the
[46:25] first character and then Malachi can you
[46:27] read that um seasons 2 8
[46:30] for by grace are you saved through faith
[46:33] and that not of yourselves it is the
[46:36] gift of God okay so all of these are
[46:40] gifts where we got to be willing to
[46:42] receive them so it's not legalism gotta
[46:46] be willing to receive them God's not
[46:48] gonna force them upon us we have to as
[46:52] you said love the things of God we have
[46:56] to look at the cross and see what Jesus
[46:57] Christ has done and fall in love with
[47:00] him and know that he's taking our sin
[47:02] and taking our shame our guilt and wants
[47:05] to save us and heal us and redeem us and
[47:08] so we've got to reject the world and
[47:12] Satan's plans to kill steal destroy and
[47:16] we got to accept Christ's plans the way
[47:19] the truth of the life praise God
[47:22] so faith is the first measure you get a
[47:25] measure of faith you get a portion or a
[47:29] part of God's divine nature faith now
[47:35] like the word Peter uses he uses the
[47:37] word add he said add to your faith
[47:40] virtue now this word add means to supply
[47:43] or furnish or to present that's what it
[47:47] means in the Greek so this is how a man
[47:51] receives God's divine nature he gets a
[47:54] God supplies him with faith then God
[47:58] supplies you with virtue and God
[48:01] supplies you with knowledge I think it's
[48:05] a beautiful illustration of God
[48:07] faithfully supplying us with the portion
[48:13] of his anointing that we need for that
[48:17] season and I remember that scripture
[48:19] just came to my mind God's not gonna
[48:21] give you a trial that you can't overcome
[48:23] right he's always gonna make a way out
[48:26] I'm gonna make a way of escape so God is
[48:29] guaranteed I'm always gonna give you a
[48:31] portion of my power and my blessings
[48:35] that you can overcome any trial not
[48:39] going to give you a trial that you just
[48:41] don't have enough
[48:43] have enough strength to overcome it
[48:45] right he's not gonna do that
[48:47] he's always only gonna allow us to be
[48:50] tested in an area where he knows we can
[48:53] overcome because he's not gonna set us
[48:55] up for failure he set us up for success
[48:57] for his cot because he loved us right we
[49:00] saw it earlier this morning because he
[49:03] loved us he gave us his word and it's
[49:05] always for our good always his commands
[49:08] are always gonna be for our good we can
[49:10] trust him with our lives
[49:11] praise God our souls our hope our future
[49:14] our past present future we can trust
[49:16] Jesus Christ with everything amen
[49:18] hallelujah so see God gives us a step of
[49:24] his I'm sorry a portion of his character
[49:27] for every step of our journey just like
[49:29] with Jesus Jesus increased in wisdom and
[49:31] stature right and in favor with God and
[49:34] man so God increased Jesus's character
[49:39] as he grew okay about 10 more minutes by
[49:46] God's grace let's go to Ephesians 4
[49:49] acacia I'm gonna go with you Ephesians
[49:59] 4:8 now this is where we get the name
[50:02] the stature of a perfect man and we get
[50:06] the steps from Peter we get the name
[50:09] really from Paul so fusions 4:8
[50:28] now because of times sake we're really
[50:30] familiar with this portion because we've
[50:32] been preaching on
[50:33] we just finished Ephesians so I think
[50:36] we'll go down to the main text I want to
[50:40] get to oh yeah sorry
[50:55] case you will read 12 and 13 I'll help
[50:58] you Feeny Andy so we want to look at 12
[51:01] and 13 it's right after he talks about
[51:03] the fivefold ministry and remember those
[51:05] are God's dress where God hides behind
[51:07] the gift in the in the preachers life
[51:10] the preacher is just a coat as we saw
[51:13] last week that God puts on and he hides
[51:15] behind there when that man is anointed
[51:17] he's speaking God's Word that's God
[51:19] speaking to us so Keysha
[51:22] can you do 12 you know I'll do 13 you do
[51:25] 1213 amen there's five great things the
[51:38] fivefold ministry does I'll read those
[51:39] in just a minute but let's look at verse
[51:41] 13 till we all come in the unity of the
[51:44] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[51:47] God unto a perfect man that means
[51:50] complete not sinless but perfect or
[51:52] complete unto the measure there it is
[51:56] again see measure the measure of the
[52:00] stature of the fullness of Christ so the
[52:04] church has to come into that you know we
[52:08] know the whole the whole predestinated
[52:10] bride of Jesus Christ once they're all
[52:12] saved born-again for though the ghosts
[52:14] that finished as the body of Christ
[52:15] that's what he's talking about here the
[52:17] fullness of the body of Christ that's
[52:21] right the fullness of Christ so see God
[52:26] uses these five gifts to impart these
[52:28] eight character qualities because here's
[52:32] the five things they do they perfect the
[52:33] preaching perfects the Saints it's for
[52:36] the work of the ministry it F eyes and
[52:39] that's that mean builds up edify means
[52:41] build up
[52:42] to build up the body of Christ it brings
[52:46] a unity of faith and knowledge of the
[52:48] Son of God unto a perfect man and it
[52:51] brings maturity and doctrinal stability
[52:57] so that's why preaching is so important
[52:59] even like this keeps me in the word
[53:01] keeps you in the word keeps us
[53:03] meditating on the things of God and
[53:07] preaching imparts all this character to
[53:11] our lives when we receive it and we say
[53:13] yes lord thank you lord
[53:15] I'm gonna act upon that I'm gonna let
[53:17] this I'm gonna meditate on that word let
[53:19] that word transform my mind that I'll
[53:22] obey the Word of God next time and every
[53:26] time praise God
[53:29] all right yeah cuz Jesus said to come in
[53:34] the unity and the knowledge of the Son
[53:36] of God unto a perfect man see the
[53:38] stature of a perfect man
[53:40] praise God unto the measure of the
[53:44] stature of Christ so remember Paul said
[53:47] you have a measure of faith so here you
[53:50] can see Peter says add this add this
[53:54] supply this God is gonna supply you with
[53:57] a measure with a portion of his divine
[54:00] character until you come into the
[54:03] completeness right I think that that you
[54:07] allow God to do in your life remember
[54:13] this is all through preaching because
[54:14] it's it pleased God by the foolishness
[54:16] of preaching to save them that believe
[54:19] that's 1st Corinthians 1:21 so you have
[54:23] to believe the preaching of God's Word
[54:25] and church is very comforting to know
[54:30] like how did Paul how did Peter how did
[54:33] James reach you know such godliness
[54:36] through preaching how can we get there
[54:40] through preaching praise God it doesn't
[54:42] it's not something new it's not gonna be
[54:44] well a new machine or something like
[54:46] that or a new pill it's the Gospels
[54:49] praise god it's the preaching of God's
[54:52] Word God's Word can't change
[54:55] is his method to make people godly was
[55:01] through preaching and so it'll always be
[55:03] through preaching praise God hallelujah
[55:07] thank you Lord I'm gonna be something
[55:10] different it's gonna be the same because
[55:15] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[55:17] the Word of God okay so I think we'll
[55:23] stop right there by God's grace let me
[55:25] get a pen here
[55:28] you know Church I tell you this this
[55:31] message that where the RAM calls the
[55:33] message he calls it the Bible message
[55:36] and that is nothing but the truth
[55:38] brother Rams message is the Bible truths
[55:43] restored the hearts of the children us
[55:48] the last believers turned back to the
[55:51] Apostolic fathers I'll tell you you know
[55:54] in studying the stature of a man and any
[55:57] doctrine brother Graham you know it was
[55:58] given by God it is so it is so
[56:04] comforting to find all these things in
[56:07] the word like even the word stature a
[56:11] perfect man like everything comes out of
[56:14] the word like this is a total Word
[56:16] message a Bible message and we are just
[56:20] so blessed to be able to have this I am
[56:23] you know I'm just often overwhelmed and
[56:25] I'm still amazed I get still amazed to
[56:28] see how scriptural this message really
[56:30] is that's why I love writing and
[56:33] meditating on it because something new
[56:35] will come off the pages and I'll Wow a
[56:39] measure of faith a measure of virtue of
[56:41] measure of knowledge it's scriptural we
[56:43] have you know God is supplying each one
[56:46] of these virtues or characters or
[56:48] character qualities as a portion of his
[56:52] divine nature for you and I how great is
[56:55] our God that's seen that praise God
