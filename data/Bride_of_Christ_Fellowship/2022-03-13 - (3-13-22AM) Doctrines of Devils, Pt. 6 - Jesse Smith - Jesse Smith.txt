[Music] is [Music] thank you if you need anything and we can help out we'd like to do it by god's grace so god bless you good to see you today a few announcements here um i announced it on wednesday uh we i was invited down to preach in columbus but the day didn't work out so originally we were going to go the first week of april but the brother rescheduled so we won't be going to that can you switch over just for a moment here so as of right now we don't have a a date re rescheduled yet so i don't know if it'll get rescheduled or not he asked me to come on april 17th but for this reason up here i can't we're going to do another uh postcard outreach so in 2018 we sent out uh 2500 postcards and we had two people visit so it's like you send out a thousand you get one person and that responds so that's kind of like a formula or something but that's okay we said and now we're gonna send out five thousand so we get five people come i'll say thank you jesus um i just feel like everyone deserves a chance to hear the truth about jesus christ and and i've i've made a i've made a promise to god that i would do that so it's my personal promise it's something that i need to honor am i on here they asked me to turn this up okay yeah um so um now we're calling them bible mystery expos okay what happened here okay why are they switching up on me like that exposition just means an explanation so like we did last time we kind of showed we did five different services on it well i'm only gonna do three um just because i want to make sure we teach the children as well um so let you know lord willing if we get visitors next sunday night at 3 p.m we won't do the kids bible study so i'm sorry children you just have to you have to sacrifice that one bible study so other people get to hear the message and then i will take a one hour sermon and i'll preach from just three to four and i'll show how the mystery of god has been finished and then we'll have a prayer and if the people want pizza i'll go order pizza whatever you know just just just we want people to come and hear the word of god okay so now the reason we couldn't go down to um columbus on the 17th was because i'd already put on 5000 postcards that we're going to have a 3 p.m service on april 7 17 and i couldn't change it they're already printed already paid for so i just told the brother from columbus you know i'm sorry but i did tell them this i said if you want me to just come myself i'll preach i'll preach you know april 16th for them and the morning of april 17th and i'll drive back up here for the 3 p.m service i'm just letting you know okay but i told him i probably i'm probably not going to invite the whole church down at this time just because of that because i already put it on the postcard so i'm not going to invite everybody on april 17th and we're gonna i don't want everybody to rush down there to columbus and rush back up for the 3 p.m service i just i just felt like i feel compelled to the holy spirit to do these outreaches um so we're gonna do that and you know i got brother austin got a quote on there so i would also put a new quote i have sister naomi's quote from 2018 on there but brother austin said this church has opened my eyes and revealed the truth about the baptism of the holy ghost this is from brother austin the mysteries of god the ministry of our prophet william branham and has introduced me to the feeling of love and acceptance that i've never experienced before anywhere else let's give that round of applause amen hallelujah i could sum that up well and say i agree that's what happened to me too when i come in the message i've never felt god's love anywhere like i do with god's people and they have done uh anything i've needed god's people have helped me out now most most times god has used my own brothers to help me out simon and cam and different ones so anyways this is being mailed out starting tomorrow and it's mailed up in a little few miles north of here up on arlington road last time i mailed him to green well to me i'm like well they got a chance i'm going to go somewhere else i'm going to go up i'm going to go further north to where there's a little more poor population this is the more green is a very wealthy area it's a fluent area i mean look at their parks i mean we're at their parks last week they have the most beautiful parks around so just so you know that's one announcement and that this is why i couldn't do the columbus trip when he wanted me to come april 17th okay so any if you have any questions about that let me know like i said uh we're i'm just burdened to invite people to come worship who like to worship so i'm going to take it off there okay also we have a few prayer requests here today let's pray for the three miracles we're continually praying for simon pratt vivian pratt and benjamin vu let's remember them in prayer also lydia has an unspoken need for a co-worker so let's remember that in prayer does anybody else have any other needs on their heart they like remembered here sister faith amen thank god yes we'll pray for that anyone else haven't needed sister lena amen family member amen praise god anyone else have a need on their heart they like remember too all right well let's have a word of prayer and we have a song special this morning so we're excited about that and let's just go to the heavenly father in prayer gracious god in heaven we come before you lord we're thankful lord i'm blessed by the lyrics of that last song that i got to see up there lord god how great

praise god let's stand and take our bibles here today let's go to second peter chapter two i'd like to get back to the series on doctrines of devils of course we're exposing the wrong doctrine and we're rejoicing in the true doctrine ii peter chapter 2. i got a lot to preach today it might be a two-hour sermon so i'm just warning you up front by god's grace i got a lot to preach today a lot of quotes i want to show you and um but you never know we'll see how it goes maybe it's all up to the holy spirit praise god second peter 2 18-19 second peter 2 18-19 we're just using this as a text to show how devils teach false doctrines and they generally make great promises that people never attain to but like brother austin's beautiful quote there what we're trying to see here today is the revelation of jesus christ and feel his love that is a promise that we all can receive today praise god we can be amongst believers who love us who will who pray for us who will help us in any way they can praise god we can see the revelation of the bible all those things that our brother wrote that's exactly what we offer today and that's exactly what we've received praise god thank god so we're not promising something that you cannot receive we're promising what you can receive praise god ii peter 2 18 and 19. let's read this together it's a little bit lengthy but uh it's good for you to read it good for me too shows our unity let's read it together on three one two three for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escape from them who live in air while they promised them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto the lord and let's pray together for this this preaching of the word and any prayer requests that we have afterwards and let's pray for our visitors we're so grateful to have jason and mario again what a just what a blessing to have them here again today heavenly father we just come to you again lord we just uh pray because you taught us to pray lord god you told us to pray before we do everything lord god in all things we give thanks and all things we pray you said pray without ceasing so we're praying now lord as we've heard the word our hearts are moved i'm sorry we've heard the worship we've our hearts are moved through the songs lord god and we love you lord god and we've we've cried out jesus help us o god help us today to love like you help us to live like you help us to draw more near to you lord god such a beautiful humble simple song i say that's the core of christianity lord god just constantly asking jesus help me help me to live like you'd like me to live and do what you'd like me to do so lord that's our prayer today help us to live like you want us to live lord god and we will be grateful when we leave this place we'll be will be happy lord god and we'll be ready to live what you've showed us in your word so lord anoint me now anoint your people lord we all need a fresh anointing lord god we need it daily lord god you said we must die daily to the desires of our flesh lord and put on the lord jesus christ put on the anointing of the holy spirit today in our minds lord god and that lord we might bring in this objection our decisions in the flesh body lord god and bring it under subjection to the holy spirit so lord take these words that we've read now lord bless them to your people and i pray god you give us a heart to hear let us have ears to hear lord god let us have good grounds today lord good and honest hearts that the seeds of the word can fall upon and bring forth fruit lord god we thank you for these things in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i have some a lot of scriptures and quotes i want to show today lord willing if we'll have time for it um just one again thank everybody for all their prayers and support you know we can't have a church without each one of you praise god and everybody has a special part and place in it and we're thankful again for god's grace and before i forget uh brother jason and brother mario you know i we have free books out there and free bibles anything on that shelf except for those bottom two rows so any of the top three shelves you can have anything on there as many books as you want you know if you're not a reader maybe you may become one you know if you're not a reader we all all my books and all those sermons are online you can listen to them and that's that's that's where your faith will grow the bible says faith comes by hearing the word of god so obviously you're here because you want your faith to rise and it will rise by being here now during the week that's when you want to hear more sermons and you want your faith to rise and you'll see it you'll see that faith begin to move and operate in your life in a greater measure praise god so it doesn't matter if it's sunday or monday or wednesday god can move and do something great in your life praise god and you can help others you can god can help you there's just so many blessings you know that god has in the store um the bible said god has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness so like that song said yes and amen wonderful job on the song special by the way a wonderful job on all the songs brother we have access to all those spiritual blessings and that's what we're constantly seeking for we're constantly seeking for god's wisdom and god's strength and god's revelation and god's joy and god's victory we're constantly seeking for those things amen hallelujah so uh thank you again it's good to have our visitors here by god's grace uh so uh today hopefully we'll get to the eighth what i think is a doctrine of a devil now i know this is very serious if i'm a holy ghost person i'm calling something of the devil i really want to make sure i'm right about it because i would never want to blaspheme the holy spirit so before i preach these i've really prayed and i've studied and i've seen the fruits or the effects that some of these doctrines have upon people and so that's why i felt a burden to preach these i've never preached this series before it's the first time i've ever preached this series so i hope it's been a blessing to you but lord willing today we'll get to i still want to continue seven and go on into eight uh by the grace of god so the first three are clearly found in paul's writings uh mandatory celibacy was a doctrine of a devil but now it's we marry whoever you want that's a doctrine of a devil uh mandatory vegetarian diet uh but now it's eat whatever you want you don't have to fast that's actually a later one on but uh you know it's interesting church and i'm not i'm not saying this for any hard feelings but we i met a message believer two weeks ago and he said you are the first message believer who's not overweight and uh not taking care of your body and he's been in the message six years now i don't say that for a joke you know because we all battle different things but i just thought it was so striking because the bible says that the bible says if we're not careful our belly becomes our god especially in america all the all you can eat buffets you know this nation is overrun with diabetes and heart disease and all these diseases that could be easily avoided if some if we got the anointing of temperance it's the green one on there is that the green one kind of hard to see from here okay i kind of need a light shining on that one uh temperance is self-control of bodily passions so if if people had that anointing of the holy ghost then they would have more control over this but i just thought it was so interesting that that that i didn't even ask him to say that brother bang that's just something he brought up and he looked at my kids he said they all look healthy you know i said well i i preach that i preach that we have to overcome gluttony right and we all battle different things right some might battle gluttony some might battle lust some might battle fear like we preach on on wednesday right wednesday night different things we battle i name them all the time yours might be a a different battle more spiritual battle might be greed uh so so we i just thought that was interesting and so we want our in other words church let me say it like this your whole life is preaching you you i think i'm the only preacher here right so i'm the only preacher so but your life is preaching amen and it's better to live a person a sermon than preach them on amen hallelujah it's not so much what you say it's what you do amen and brother branham a prophet told us your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words on earth than your actions you know in other words in other words you want to think the right things right you you want uh uh you want your thoughts to become your actions praise god praise god now uh the fourth one is kind of related there they some some around are our sister churches say there's no need to fast but that's not true they say the lord returned i mean this is just outrageous but they believe the and i'm going to get in this in a moment church i just we have to understand the day we're living in every age had different battles they're going through and i'm just going to give some examples in a moment so don't be discouraged you know that there's so many false doctrines it's always been that way the way to salvation has always been a narrow road there's always been voices and there's always been fanatics every in every age there's always fanatics in fact that's satan's trick is trying to put fanatics around us and to try to distract us from the real thing amen but we got to stay what's we got to stay focused on the real thing amen the main thing amen and that's the holy ghost praise god that's living in obedience to the holy ghost praise god that's the main thing because the holy ghost will always point us back to the word the fifth one is one we see a lot too many not so much in message churches but in denominational churches once saved always saved everyone to go to heaven we know that's not true the bible said they would turn grace into lawlessness in other words oh you said a prayer you can live however you want you're still going to heaven that's a lie doctrine of a devil because if you don't believe that just briefly uh just read the book of hebrews there's so many if you do this if you do this if you believe to the end there's there's there's two places about how you can be anointed but then you can trample underfoot the son of god you can crucify the son of god afresh after once uh loving the son of god you can crucify the son of god i mean what a powerful book amen and then god always wants you healthy and wealthy we saw that two two sundays ago or if i'm not mistaken by god's grace maybe it was last sunday i can't remember things are just going so fast now um now in number seven i'm very careful to say presuming and exalting brother branham and his followers as the greatest people of all time i believe that's a doctrine of a devil i believe that's the spirit of pride because not even jesus would tell he didn't he didn't even know he didn't even know who would be on his right hand or left and think about this think about paul's list remember paul's list of sufferings he went through he went on three missionary trips and he didn't have a boeing 777 or 767. his missionary trips were real missionary trips like our boat might go down and a couple of times the boats did he was shipwrecked numerous times when was last time you know a missionary that would the plane crashed in the ocean they had to survive that plane's actually safer than a car right so our travel was actually safer much safer than they had but paul was whipped uh three times and each time 39 times he was in constant fasting constant uh perils robbers constantly being robbed he was constantly being mugged how many have you ever been mugged i've never been mugged my car's been broken into and when i was in college they smashed the window and took just a handful of quarters and it cost me a hundred dollars to fix the card they just wanted to record they just could have knocked on the door i would have gave him a hundred dollars i really would have honestly i would have if just a knock on the door don't destroy it i should have left a note on there i should have left the dog but it's my fault it's my fault i shouldn't leave money exposed in the car it's my fault but i'm just saying the point is it's just sad what people would do for a few dollars there might have been two dollars in there uh and i just think it's very prideful to assume and look at paul's life and paul said that jesus christ told him if anybody adds to anything that he wrote they're cursed amen and then paul said you'll be judged by my gospel amen now to me i think paul if i had an opinion my opinion is paul would be the greatest believer of all time now that'd be my humble opinion but i'm not i'm not saying it's it's right now these people go around these people go around and say brother bam is the greatest of all time the greatest person of all time prophet of all time and then you are the greatest people of all time i have a hard time believing that because of the bible because jesus tells us we'll get to that in a moment here now today lord willing after i get through a little more on number seven i want to go to number eight where people have basically said if you want rapturing faith in other words if you want to go in the rapture you're only going to get it by listening to tapes now i believe in listening to tapes i was listening to birth pains yesterday this day this scripture was fulfilled i was listening to that yesterday i believe in listening to tapes but i believe it's a doctrine of a devil to say that rapturing faith is literally on a tape or literally on my phone i have all program sermons on my phone i believe it's a sin to say rapturing faith is on my phone that's a sin i believe that it's worshipping a tape as sad is it to say it's worshiping a tape it's worshiping a man it's just a little slight uh difference than saying every word on the tape is thus saith the lord okay so but we're going to we want to show the scriptures about that and we will lord willing here as we go along now these and church i mean like can you imagine being a jason and mario they're they're coming in here hearing about jesus now we're hearing about tapes right you know and but when you came in what was going on when you came in right no matter what day you live there's always obstacles to that day like i just put a few notes on here you know god knew we'd battle these kind of doctrines of devils at these times and seasons imagine walking to timothy's church in ephesus and timothy's reading paul's words right we kind of went through this a few weeks ago and timothy would read and anyone who says you can't marry is a doctrine of a devil and everybody would turn a look at the preachers who preached that a few weeks ago and you would say we just we just want to see people go to heaven we just want to see people exalt jesus christ but the doctrines they were battling was people saying if you want to be holy you can't marry if you want to be a preacher that was this that was the battle they were facing in that day each day had a different battle to overcome imagine this one came to my mind if you were in herod's day when jesus was born and millions and maybe thousands of babies were being slaughtered that's what we have today with a modern-day abortion but it was more just it was just they'd rush into your house and end the life right there imagine living imagine living in fear you got a son brother bank i've got two imagine living in fear that government might come in at any time and end the life of that son see so each day has a different battle now our day by prophecy was evil seducers will wax worse and worse and outside of america christianity is the greatest persecuted group in the world so everywhere except america but look what happened in canada certain christians will raise up they'll take them to jail shut off their bank accounts so what is it it's getting closer church we all know that but we are not called to live in fear praise god we're called to live by faith the just the the ones that are holy the ones that are righteous will live by faith amen amen so we see it and it's slowly going that way satan works slowly right he's slowly going to work but every day have it ever you live in as a christian has its different battles that you'd face remember the early church they had to have the line anointing because they had to give their lives uh and they had to stand against all the all the wickedness of that day then the ox anointing then many had many more had to give their lives then the man anointed they had the wisdom of the holy spirit to understand about the reformation and back to the word of god but we're living in the eagle age praise god we're living in an age where we must watch and pray we must be able to rise up in heavenly places praise god we must be able to see a far ways off amen hallelujah we must be able to raise up and see we must not be contaminated by earthly things amen hallelujah we must have a prophetic vision and any prophetic vision must take us back to the word of god imagine john wesley's day when you lived in that he got kicked out when he first started preaching sanctification they kicked him out of the anglican church his dad was a preacher his brother was charles a beautiful songwriter amazing songs wrote thousands of songs but because of the persecution they were outside most of the time in the spring summer fall right because it gets cold and gets cold in that part of the world like it does here the churches said you can't preach in here so he said fine we'll go out in the pastures so imagine having service height did they have porta potts in those days just but just imagine this is what you live in we're rejected by the churches so we've got to have church out here in a pasture with animals every now and then you know you hear a moo and the children oh that's amen that cows amen in the word of god there you know just you know that that's what they have to live with that was and then the wintertime is so cold they might be outside maybe the sermons were a little shorter or maybe they just had to have small individual meetings in their homes that's the battle that they to live in right now ours now for us we're in america where we have the most freedom any nation's ever seen in the history of the world because our nation was founded on christ now it's not anymore because we've left the laws that we find in the word of god so we're living in uh we're living in an age we're living our country is off a reputation of being a christian nation but it's not a christian nation anymore now imagine if you lived in 1963 you knew the seals were going to be open you knew brother branham had discernments imagine living in that time and a struggle for you as you didn't live in jeffersonville and let's say you know the rich people could drive around the retired people old people could drive around and follow brother branham all these meetings but you couldn't and you knew there was a prophet in the land and you were sick or you needed a personal interview and you just wanted to be you knew that was god's prophet you would you would live under that pressure praise god and there was no internet and you had to wait till you got a postcard from the branham tabernacle saying when brother bram's meetings were going to be well you'd be really waiting for the mailman outside what time is it you should have been here at one o'clock it's already three o'clock yeah you could phone him a little bit you know he could phone too but that's what you you live under that pressure and stress and then imagine living in 1976 like brother loris and sister karen did they saw this they lived through it where brother had made the prediction he was calculating dates and he thought maybe 70 1977 would be the end and uh imagine living through that all the pressure leading up to it and then imagine living in the aftermath afterwards i thought he was a prophet i thought and the whole time it was never thus saith the lord it was just a human prediction just like you'd predict oh i think we're going to do this i think we're going to do that i think we're going to do that i think the lord might come in next year right we've all done it imagine living in that day and so imagine living in the 80s when the big movement in the 1980s around the message was the seven thunders and they were saying they had the revelation of the seven thunders and they were the only ones that were going to the rapture that sat under the late joseph coleman imagine that and church they had they had a motion those brothers would sit and jump in the front of the church they would jump the whole two three hours they would wave handkerchiefs and jump for two or three hours and they had miracles and you think oh is this the am i going to miss the rapture imagine living under that pressure but it turned out it was just man-made theology it was just human emotion work-up because later in life uh at the end of that the pastor's life there they let false prophets come in they prophesied of his healing and his resurrection from his death and it all failed the churches all split there was adultery uh there was a bank fraud money laundering all kinds of things your sins will find you out amen that's why i say let's get all the sin under the blood of jesus amen amen and it was all based upon what it goes what i've heard it's all based upon there was a certain video they took of joseph coleman preaching and a light flickered and everybody thought that was the pillar of fire but then brother perry green yeah that's right that's you sent that to me perry green said i have that same camera right and i was taking a picture or video and that same light flickered so it wasn't the pillar of fire it was a it was a mix-up on the video on the video camera it's just a light on the video camera and just so you know bro that brother was preaching those virtues over there but he said if you don't he said you don't have virtue until somebody touches you and you get instantly healed like jesus well that goes against the bible the bible says not all have gifts of healing amen but imagine living in that day and going through that trial how about living in the 1950s when brother branham would constantly talk about we could be destroyed in one hour by a russian bomb and now here that's what we got today it's right back but it was more serious there even in the schools they had practice for atomic bombs uh and safety drills remember that they'd hide under the desk well what that ain't gonna do any good if atomic bomb hits but they were under such pressure they wanted to do something they do anything to make themselves feel prepared for an atomic bomb imagine the 90s when the two souls movement which basically said anything you did in your past life like a marriage once you come to the truth of the message once you come to that uh you could divorce that first spouse and marry anyone you want because it was a two different souls but it's not you just have a soul that was unbelief and now the soul is quickened with the seed of god let's see it's false doctrine what about the perugia the perugia actually came out of ohio leave ale's church i'm calling names because he's passed on but he basically got away from the emotion he said the lord is here we don't need emotion we don't need fasting we don't need all that and it just became intellectualism so see that that combated the seven thunders they they saw the emotion the seventh under they knew that was wrong but then this guy gets off and said you don't need any of it but we know the route is you must be right down the middle of the road amen you need warmth in your soul the love of god in your soul emotion you need the love of god and you also need the wisdom and understanding on what the word says and how to live it praise god you need both both emotions and understanding amen now i i lived through this technically but it didn't impact me but in 2001 joseph branham put out the here i stand and that split up a lot of churches who can make tapes now and a lot of people lost friendships and family and associations who should make tapes we got to get the message out the whole world needs who should make it now look this this family's been causing problems for a long time not unity but division maybe unity to their false doctrine imagine living through that when your own brother your own sister would say oh no no only jeffersonville can make tapes no no no anybody can make a tape brother man let people make tapes imagine living through that losing friends over that we all have lived through this 2012 most of us the believe the sign movement and the falling away continues today all these questions right all these questions about brother man all these questions and it's i believe it's foolish to avoid those questions because if people have a question that means they want an answer and if anybody should have answers it should be us amen but see most most preachers hide away from those things they just ignore those things well that's that's fine they can do whatever they want but to me it shows a fear of a fear of questions but jesus never feared no question amen hallelujah and we won't have all the answers but the holy ghost will give us humble simple answers god is always revealed in simplicity hallelujah amen that's what we're living through now all these questions about william branham and his ministry we're living through that now and now we're in the the new tape church movement we start around 2015. i forgot to put that date up there and and that even seeps over into and these two kind of seep over into churches that believe in preachers see because the tape church movement says you can't correct god's prophet well that seeps over into message churches with preachers and they'll say you can't correct god's prophet but yet they'll do it in their own sermons so it shows there's a contradiction right you cannot correct thus saith the lord you can't do that but human opinions predictions yes the holy spirit can correct those and help us understand what was the truth of it praise god was it an opinion was it a thought was it a wish was it a desire see and then and again the holy ghost is not afraid of any question my bible says the holy ghost dissolves all doubts amen hallelujah amen my bible says always be ready to have an answer for the hope that you have within you praise god amen that's why we did that doing that podcast amen hallelujah it's brother william brother william sent an email yesterday and said he really he said he said i loved every word on that podcast i said well thank you brother you're so encouraging amen now let's go look a little further at this when they presume and exalt brother branham they're basically saying they're the goat that's a that's a funny that's a famous saying now in sports like who's the goat in football who's the goat in basketball and goat we know is like and unto a sinner sheep is like an unto god saints amen but see how this desire to be the goat the desire to be the greatest of all time see how it seeps over into the message and church remember the jesus own apostles battle that spirit of goat i'm the greatest preacher no no peter i remember god did this remember god did this in galilee remember when god did that through my ministry see so preachers that argue about who's the greatest brother of them said don't you never do that he said there's no great ones among us amen well yeah fivefold preachers will do that they'll call themselves generals they'll call themselves the most anointed preachers the greatest preachers of all time and that's wrong there's none of us great but god amen amen and if you think you're great let god say it not you my bible tells me the bible says the preachers are nothing the bible says they're waterers and there's planters but that doesn't give the increase only god gives the increase hey that's what my bible says let's read it first corinthians 3. it's not my notes but i'm going to read it because it just came to me first corinthians 3. see it's pride it's the spirit of the goat that rises up okay look at now the context we actually read this uh recently but look at the context verse five first corinthians three five who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to what every man that's why i think everybody will be responsible every man can at some point find a preacher now it's a lot easier with the internet today right but even then now verse six paul says who am i they're arguing who's the greatest well i'm of peter i'm of paul i'm of apollos verse six i have planted an apollos watered but god gave the increase praise god just think about your garden you can plant you can water but you can't make it grow the life of the seed has to make it grow with the sun and the water and the soil it all works together we just have a very small part in it but we don't give it life god gives it life amen imagine out on your garden saying oh look i'm the greatest seed planter in the world i'm the greatest water when you get out your hose imagine unraveling your host i'm the great i'm the most powerful waterer in all the gardens i'm a general gardener but if if god don't say let the sun shine your garden will be nothing amen if god doesn't send the sun if the sun doesn't visit you you have nothing the same is true today if the sun doesn't come down and bless our works we have nothing amen you can water it all day you can plant as many as you want all day but the sun doesn't come nothing's going to happen so god gets all the glory amen amen look at verse 7. so then neither is he that planteth anything so preachers are nothing we don't get any glory preachers should not get any glory and the church said i thought i'd get a good healthy amen on that one amen neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase so paul saw the arguments oh i go to apollo church i go to peter's church i i just follow jesus well you gotta you gotta have a pastor so that's the wrong thought too the bible says so so he says he says all this to say we are all working together we're all nothing yeah god will reward us but we don't worry about that now he says labor he said do your part but god will ultimately bless your works it is god who gives the increase it's god who gives life amen verse 8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor so let's look at verse 9 for we are laborers together with god see god gives you a part in this but the bible says you're nothing you have a part in it but you're nothing okay but then god's gonna even though you're nothing god's gonna still reward you for that let's not walk around saying i'm the greatest water there ever was i'm the greatest guard i'm the greatest planter of seed there ever was no the bible says you're nothing but see there's a spirit that everybody wants to be the greatest the greatest basketball the greatest football uh the greatest whatever they want to be the goat because they got the goat spirit i don't know about the preachers that's all up to them right i'm not calling anybody out by name i'm just saying that's a spirit and they've got to get away from that amen remember the bible said dare not any of you commend each other by comparing yourselves one to another don't lift up don't encourage yourself don't try to brag on yourself based upon well i know amen to this i know vang did that i know jose and did that oh i'm i must be so great i must be so much greater we must be the greatest people of all time now remember where all the blessings flow from all the blessings flow from heaven by god's grace amen now is there any proof that the laodicean saints would be admired or exalted more than the other saints the greatest group of all time i say no i don't see any bible for that go to matthew 20. in the parable of the laborers jesus gives a parable about labors in his vineyard or his kingdom now we're not going to read this whole thing for time's sake but let me just rehearse the story verse one for the kingdom of heaven is like unto man that isn't householder that which went out early in the morning to hire laborers in his vineyard into his vineyard and when he agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent them into the vineyard now i'm going to skip ahead in the third hour he goes back looking for more workers so there's people that went out to work the first thing in the morning the first hour of the day which would have been 6 a.m can you imagine getting up and sick brother austin again some of us can too you're out now you're out there in the field at 6 a.m you're there i'm clocking in at 6 00 a.m so at 9 00 9 00 am they go back out anyone else want to work at 12 they go out now the last one is 3 p.m because the day ends at 6 p.m when the sun goes down so imagine you've worked all those hours you've worked nine hours i'm sorry yeah you worked 11 i'm sorry yeah 11 hours and the and right at two o'clock i'm sorry no right at five o'clock the the the the worker out there you're labored all day it's 5 p.m you got there at 6 00 a.m the late the worker the boss goes out to find one more group to come in and that brother says was you and i we were the 11th hour workers the ones that were called in right before the harvest amen right before the end of the day the end of the age amen and then at the finally at the 12th hour the end of the day he calls all the workers in for their payment verse 9. and when they came that were hired about the 11th hour they received every man a penny so he gives each person a penny the 6 a.m workers the 9 a.m the 12 noon the 3 p.m and then you the 5 p.m do you get a different reward or the same reward hallelujah verse 11 and when they had received it they murmured against the good man of the house saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou has made them equal to us which have borne the burden and heat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong this thou not agree with me for a penny take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee isn't that lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is thine i evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first shall be last for many are called but few were chosen hallelujah so this is the only one i can see where we have people that have labored longer we have people that have done more but jesus gives the same reward he gives eternal life to all those who believe that's his promise today he's promising if you'll labor for his kingdom he'll give you eternal life amen how do you want to take them up on that offer hallelujah i'll work amen i work till jesus comes amen just give me an opportunity to labor in your kingdom i want to work for the master amen i know his business is right praise god and he'll reward us equally the bible says with eternal life so this is a parable about eternal life but does jesus say anything about these 11th hours being any greater than everybody else no in fact he actually uses the word equal that sounds like we just read in first corinthians 3 they that water and they that plant are nothing they're equal now of course jesus let the last go first so to me that looks like well the only thing that we get first would be the rapture like if we're changed if we're living on earth that's the only thing that we get first but actually the dead and christ rise first i'm not sure about that but we'd be the privileged ones not to live so not not not to die rather so jesus gave no more honor and no more uh i'm sorry uh no more honor to any of the laborers or the last time laborers needed the first time laborers now we know there's a 30 60 100 full reward right the reigning over 10 cities that's the highest reward i've found about reigning over cities plus you have jesus saying there's a hundredfold reward in the next life for those who are missionaries or leave their homes houses families there's a great reward for that but i can't find any proof in the bible that our age would get a greater reward we'd be the we'd be the uh the popular people in heaven that's the way it sounds like there's people that believe that they be like all the saints to come up and say you made it out of laodicea i'm gonna look at paul and say how did you make it how did you make it the bible the bible makes it sound like in corinthians he had to even wrestle lions the bible makes it sound like that i don't know for sure but remember the christians were tossed in the amphitheater they're tossed in the center many of them lost their lives to lions like the gladiators which one of us have been you know thrown to lions how did you make it out of that see when you really meditate on these things and think about the holy spirit and what god has brought us through it makes us grateful for the age we live in but it also makes us understand others have labor longer amen others have labored in hotter weather than we have amen hallelujah much hotter we get the end of the day so see that's why i believe it's a doctrine of a devil to worship and exalt brother branham and his followers above every other christian that ever was i believe that's wrong i believe that's a sin because even jesus wouldn't tell us who it was now i want to add this and this is closely related there's a quote where brother adam said when you're justified by jesus christ that means declared righteous it's as if you never did it in the first place now get your bibles ready let's go to revelation 5. now i believe that because of first john 3 8. now you go to revelation 5 but first john 3 8 says you cannot sin because the seed of god is within you so there's a part of your soul that once you're baptized with the holy ghost that part of you never sinned in the first place because that's god's spirit and god gave you part of his own life amen hallelujah praise god but some people preach this and over emphasize this until they don't even appreciate the sacrifice of christ anymore they've heard it so many times you never did in the first place now church if i preach that over and over again you think well then why do i even need jesus i never did it in the first place why do i even need a savior right and it makes people from my perspective in my opinion it makes people not appreciative of the cross or makes it too loose where they don't need to repent of their sins well i never did it in the first place why should i why should i repent if i never did in the first place and the church said you see where i'm getting on this see how these quotes can be taken it's a good quote but taken out of context and take it without a real bible teaching misunderstood a lazy attitude comes oh my god not an attitude of diligence and appreciation and love for god but a lazy attitude like oh i'm good i never did it in the first place i can just i i i don't have to i don't have to press on towards the mark of the high calling i can just kick back and relax because i never did in the first place well the reality of it is your soul didn't it but your human spirit and your body did amen now revelation 5 9-10 some of you are reading ahead and you're getting kind of a good jump on my sermon here so you are you know my main point before i get there so just say amen when we get there okay if you already know where i'm going yeah just give me an amen when you get there revelation 5 9. now how do these saints there's 24 elders in heaven how do they act when they're around jesus are they acting like hi jesus i really never did in the first place thanks for what you did but i never really did in the first place what are they what are they focusing on what is the focus of these worshipers amen this is the chapter where they said no one's worthy to loose the book no man was found in heaven amen no man was found in earth or under the earth no man was found who was worthy amen well i thought we never did in the first place well we did it in our soul but that's not the attitude we take that's not our focus is walking around saying well i'm perfect i never did it i've got a part of god in me i shouldn't be thankful i don't have to be thankful for the cross that's not the attitude of people who are in heaven right now amen who worship god and who are already saved and have new bodies their attitude is worship the worthy one because the worthy one redeemed them amen amen hallelujah glory see what satan does he'll take a quote and he'll take it so far and people will swallow it where it becomes uh that quote uh to them it becomes the idol itself i never did in the first place i don't apologize i never did in the first place i don't have to clean up my life i never did in the first place it's a lie the bible said perfect holiness in the fear of god amen be thankful that your soul never sin because it's god's spirit but you realize i'm not always obedient to god's spirit amen i don't always obey god's spirit i need help obeying god's spirit amen i don't always live the way god wants me to live so i need mercy i need forgiveness i need blood i need redemption hallelujah revelation 5 9 and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy wait did they sing we are worthy no they said thou art well you never sin in the first place aren't you worthy no you're not worthy because you have three parts to your being and two of your parts are not worthy hallelujah and the bible says you were even your soul was dead in sins amen before the holy ghost came amen even your soul was dead in sins but when the anointing came that's when the baptism holy ghost came that's when god's anointing came but before that the soul was dead in unbelief the bible said you were shaped iniquity born in sin come to the world speaking lies but then the grace of god appeared unto you amen hallelujah and he made you alive you died to sin and he made you alive in jesus christ hallelujah so how does paul and peter i'm sorry yeah how does paul peter james john how do they worship god now that they've got glorified bodies well thanks jesus what you did i never did in the first place though no the bible said they say there's one worthy it makes them so happy brother amen they sing a new song at church amen they sing a new song in heaven amen hallelujah amen when you really understand the cross of jesus christ it'll make you sing a new song amen hallelujah they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast what redeemed us see their focus church is redemption i am bought glory i am bought back to god amen i was in the pawn shop i was sold under sin but jesus paid the price and he brought me out of the pawnshop amen amen glory brother jose their song in heaven with a glorified body amen hallelujah that body glorified body never sin in the first place that theophany never sinned in the first place but somehow they can never get away from the fact that they were unworthy and they were sinful amen at one point they were sinful and they praise god and they worship the lamb and say you are worthy you've redeemed us amen and they fall down on their faces before jesus christ amen that's what we don't have today many message people falling on their faces worshiping jesus christ said they stand there and pride and i never did it in the first place i'm the greatest of all time that's a sin hallelujah hallelujah so in other words church when you get a glorified body when it's all perfect glory when you get a perfect body don't get tired anymore don't get hurt anymore when you get a perfect mind no more mind battles glory when you get a glorified body which is a perfect physical body again you will not be saying how great you are amen you will still recognize all this is possible because of one man amen no man was worthy except jesus christ amen even in a perfect body you'll still remember that you were redeemed amen do you see them walking around do you see the 12 here walking around saying hey hey manasseh i'm going to rule over you someday because i'm greater than you the bible said the apostles will rule over the 12 tribes of israel you see them arguing do you see any arguments now about who's the greatest no the bible said they fall down and cast their crowns at the feet of the nail scarred feet of jesus christ you've redeemed us to god by thy blood we're still thankful for the blood amen hallelujah there's only one great one that's christ amen and let me say it like that he was the goat glory those two goats on the day of atonement that was christ amen hallelujah one goat died for the sins the other goat was a scapegoat amen he is the greatest of all time our sins were laid upon him and now we'll sing in heaven blessed is that blood that has redeemed us unto god amen hallelujah he's the greatest of all time because he took our sins upon him died for them this perfect sinless sacrifice but rose for our justification amen hallelujah that didn't strike me till now he's the goat amen because he was both parts of the goat amen both rose the goat the goats fulfilled that was christ in both realms he was not a sinner but he took your sin and my sin upon him so our our focus won't be on look how sinless my soul is well thank god for that we'll thank god for a sinless soul but our songs will be about one person amen our songs will be about the redemption the bible says and church don't forget this is the seventh realm this is the seventh dimension there's no higher dimension in all the universe in this universe so in other words you're never going to go to a higher exalted state than this state right here praise god amen in other words this is the greatest worship brother bang that there ever will be singing a new song right an author of eternity singing songs to the lamb of god who takes away our sin amen hallelujah look at verse well i want to go uh i kind of preached this here but revelation 4 11 also says this thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created when preachers or anybody says we're the greatest of all time they're worshiping there it is they're worshiping the creature instead of the creator that's what the bible says in romans 1. that's what the homosexuals do they worship the creature more than the creator and that goes to show how the religious spirit is the worst one of all because they live some things right but then they get a religious spirit and they reject the word of god now go to revelation 7 you'll see a picture of yourself as well this is you now the other one was the 12 i'm sorry the 24 elders now before that i'm going to read where they cast their crowns here because i actually didn't read that when i wanted to get to that revelation 5. i didn't look up that verse but i like to read that here can anybody see that one real quick all right well we've got to break out the concordance nobody sees that maybe it's in chapter four must be chapter four keep looking if you can find it that would be a good help 410 thank you sister yeah there it is amen let's say praise the lord praise the lord there it is share me right in the face brother babe i miss it sit right in face 4 10. the four and 20 elders fall down before him that sat on the throne in worship and that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne amen saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created in other words church where did i get this crown i got it from you jesus well i can't even have this because you created me for your glory i just did what you told me to do so really jesus this is your crowd amen i'm only reigning because you you gave me grace to do it not because of how great i am but because how great you are amen because you've redeemed me see how the focus y'all the devil get the focus off the right thing he'll get it on just your soul you never did in the first place and forget about the fact that we're going to spend eternity thanking god for redeeming us redeeming our souls amen now revelation 7 14. now verses 1 through 8 is the 144 000 jews that are soon to be sealed maybe in our lifetime maybe maybe not after the rapture god goes back to the jews verses 9 through 17 is i believe the gentile bride there are seven quotes that say this is the bride one quote says the foolish virgin so i go with the seven because all and all of the details in here as well so verse nine after this i be held below a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands now look at verse 14 and i said unto him sir thou knowest he said who are these arrayed in white robes and he said unto me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb so church what is the emphasis all these multitudes are waving palm branches i imagine some of them are waving these palm branches too amen like we are this morning waving our palm branches before jesus amen and what are they thanking god for they're thanking god that jesus brought me through great tribulation the trials of my life i came through and while i was going through those trials brother bang i made mistakes but god gave me a blood to help me wash away the stains on my garments amen that's why we're singing that's why we're praising god it was his blood that washed me his blood that cleansed me his his blood that brought me through he gave me clean garments as i walked through the trials of life as i battled devils on every side as i battled persecution it was his blood there to wash me and make me worthy and so i'll sing to him all the days of eternity amen hallelujah now well thank you lord i never did in the first place i don't need to be washed see you see that my it's the attitude church they're not bragging about how their souls never sin in the first place they're not arguing about who's greater they're worshiping the worthy one all right let me just see if i have anything else here okay yeah we can move on now i'd like to it's eleven thirty nine we started at what ten thirty four okay so i've been about an hour right now okay so i'm just saying i may be another hour i'm just saying just saying okay well by god's grace the word is beautiful buddy the word is we can't that's what satan tried to get people's eyes off the word we got to keep our eyes right on the word of god this is what we find when we read the word of god now there's a move there's been a move for a while i've heard this many times since i've been the message that rapturing faith is literally on the tapes now james 5 7 let's read that about the latter reign it says be patient therefore brother and unto the coming of lord behold the husband and waited for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long wait for until we receive the early ladder rain so the bible says latter rain is like rain falling from heaven so the bible says the latter rain will come from heaven now joel 2 23-26 we've read that many times we're not going to read that but the bible says the latter rain falls like it did in the first month which means at first so the latter rain falls like it did at first on the day of pentecost and then it will provide us with wheat which is the word amen it will provide us with wine which is oil amen i'm sorry wine which is stimulation amen and it provides us with plenty of oil the bible says which is the baptism of the holy ghost and let me tell you all three are available for you today praise god come eat as much wheat as you want amen come drink the wine of the holy spirit come enjoy the oil of the baptism of the holy ghost the bible says we will have these things and we will not be ashamed of our testimonies amen hallelujah and church that one was thus saith the lord that's why i've always said church we're going to advance we're going to go through seasons and trials but we're going to advance where everybody by god's grace that's got the holy ghost in our church is going to have plenty of wheat plenty of oil and plenty of wine amen hallelujah everybody's going to be happy coming to church amen they'll not be ashamed of the gospel praise god we're advancing towards that hallelujah and zechariah 10 1 this scripture says you've got to pray for it well we already got the tapes do we have to pray for more tapes no we don't need more tapes now if we get them good but the bible says you pray for the rain to fall from heaven zechariah 10 1. now what does this do again this again this false doctrine exalts the tapes and it also exalts the self-righteous ones that say well i listen to more tapes so i'm going to definitely get the rapture in faith well what is that that's works-based rapture that's a works-based rapture but the rapture is based upon those who prepared right who had the oil they followed god's directions and got the oil the baptism of the holy ghost not how much they sat down and pressed play it's for those who got down to business with god got the baptism of the holy ghost received the baptism of the holy ghost and then followed with that holy ghost the rest of their days amen all right zechariah 10 1 ascii of the lord reign in the time of the latter remember when i preached on wednesday night was it maybe about a year ago i just felt the inspiration the holy ghost there's going to come a time church when we see the squeeze is on and the bible says here we have to pray for the latter rain in other words we will see the conditions and lord willing we might imagine we'd have to live with we would live through that what a blessing but also we'd have to recognize all these things are happening the laws are changing they're going to close our doors it's time to pray for la we're rapturing faith amen it's time to pray for it so see church you've got something to do don't let down on your prayer life because the bible said here you ask of the lord for the latter rain when it's time for the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds as you pray the clouds you'll start seeing the clouds you'll see the atmosphere change amen hallelujah as we pray for the latter rain the atmospheres will change and then we'll feel the refreshment of the rain glory to everyone grass in the field oh my all of god's plants amen god will water every single one amen he's so faithful god's anointing will fall on all the predestinated bride members amen now i don't know i've heard that before i think we talked about it bang or some somebody talk about will the latter rain fall on unbelievers i don't know i i just don't know how to understand that because that would mean rapturing faith falls on other people i don't believe so right now i look at uh i just i just i just don't understand that i'll just say it like that i don't understand that i kind of look at esther as my example you know the two wines the two wine banquets the former latter reign but i personally don't see how if they're anointed with the devil i don't see how exactly the rapturing faith is going to fall on them i just don't see that okay so i could be wrong if i stand here uh just sharing with all my heart praise god okay so my answer is no i don't believe it's literally on a tape because it's a holy ghost anointing located in heaven because god's gonna pour it out from heaven so i asked you this question last week was enoch's rapturing faith on a tape remember is jesus christ different today or is he the same he's the same yesterday today and forever amen did elijah have a tape or stone had rapturing faith was literally on that stone no it was anointing the bible said enoch walked with god as he walked with god that anointing got stronger and stronger amen hallelujah and he was under the blood of bulls and goats amen he wasn't under the blood of jesus christ that means he saw that sin conscious he knew he was a sinner and all these things and he just could never really get the victory but even despite that he would still try to overcome in his mind battles and it was just predestined amen it was just predestined that one day he would just take a step higher and then keep going higher because he walked with god his name means dedicated amen so he was as dedicated as he could be and when it was time when it was the season god sent the anointing and god took elijah i'm sorry enoch that he did not see death and then god took elijah a little differently praise god sent down a chariot from heaven amen hallelujah see that means church you can be raptured without the new testament that proves it's just an anointing praise god it's just an anointing from heaven because they got raptured without the baptism of the holy ghost so what is rapturing faith it's more of the holy ghost but the man said it's a refilling of the holy ghost he said this now again we've got to take this back to the word does that sound right yeah because remember in acts chapter 4 uh the the uh the the christians got in jail for one day right they let them out the next day and they went and they they went up to the upper room again or another upper room and then they lifted up their voices of god and said we're grateful to the suffer for the kingdom of god and the bible said the holy ghost shook that prayer meeting amen and the bible said they were all filled with the holy ghost amen that doesn't mean their soul gets it twice it means their mind gets a fresh filling of the holy ghost praise god like we believe christopher got hopefully he's been a new person if he got that anointing in the mind then he has a brand new mind he has a transformed mind amen the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body so christ and the church unite together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics of the holy spirit now these are my thoughts remember the prophet and the bride must already say what's in the word okay so in other words rapturing faith is talked about on the tapes but rapturing faith is also scripturally written in the bible so we should only say what the word says it's already in the word it's based upon the scriptures joel 2 23-26 it's a false teaching to emphasize the tapes more than the bible and the church said the tapes point us to the bible i love brother ramsey they point me to the bible praise god aren't you glad you got to listen to them amen they point you to the bible they make you go study the bible they prove that jesus christ is the same as he was in christ brother ramsey so he is in our days the same today they point us to the bible the absolute now we already read this one the latter reign is an answer to prayer not an answer to pressing play enough times like they say you got a it's on the tape so you just gotta tape tape play play play play play so if you press play enough you'll get in the rapture that's not true not true you can't do that you can't press play while limit while breaking what ephesians 4 says about preachers see pressing play makes that scripture preachers must be in season and out of season there it is right there amen pressing play makes you have i have an off season now i don't have to preach that take a lot of pressure off me if i didn't have to preach i could just press play all the time and we all i act like everything's okay right then i wouldn't have to be in season and out of season does everyone understand see the bible's got all the answers amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah the word of god rightly divides the word of truth amen the word of god in us rightly divide the word of truth now here's uh this was my reminder from yesterday so now the quote in question is this now you you read closely listen closely does brother ever say thus saith the lord rapturing faith is literally on the tapes just listen closely now this is at the end of a sermon i remember when christ swept down there in that big light standing yonder at the bottom of the river 1933 in june when he said as john the baptist was sent to four fourth and four on the first coming of christ i send you with a message to the world to form the second coming of christ and around the world she swept when revival fires have been built for 15 years on nearly every mountain divine healing across the nations and the power and the restoration now here it is anybody hear any thus say the lord's in here and now i believe she's ready this is in 1962. before the seals before marriage and divorce three years before he died i believe she's ready to strike that final climax that's what the rapturing that's what latter rain is it's the final climax of all the churches this is the final anointing god's gonna send amen to bring forth a faith that will rapture to the church and the glory but remember enoch had that same faith elijah had that same faith and she is laying in the messages he didn't even say tapes did everybody catch that we're really at the end time we've talked about in everything but the thing has moved upon us now yeah yes sir here is one that's right and that's it he just goes on to something else after that does anybody see literally rapturing faith is on the tapes in that quote i don't see it i just see him he's he's ready for the lord to come now look he's waiting for the lad to rain for the rapture but god still hasn't opened the seals amen hallelujah god still hasn't finished the mysteries of god amen because the seals haven't been opened hallelujah praise god is everybody with me he's just a man he's hoping this is the end and hope i'm looking for the uh ladder rain now to finish and go in the glory but the seals haven't been opened glory revelation 10 hasn't even been fulfilled brother revelation 10 7 had he fulfilled or revealed and he thinks this is the now time for the rapture you know trees grow quiet quietly too so it's okay if it's quiet you ever seen a tree shout or scream when it's growing i'm glad you're all thinking out there y'all contemplating the word of god yeah amen now notice this this quote was a day before he preached sirs this is the end time that's where i got the inspiration for my second book that sermon now i'm sorry to use all caps i know that's hard to read and it's like shouting at you i'm not shouting it i mean i'm shouting for jesus but i'm not shouting at you guys brotherham said the bride is laying in the messages he never said i have an extra never there thus saith the lord and brother abraham said if the lord gave him a word it would speak it it's thus saith the lord. so see preachers are making this quote sound like they're lit literally rapturing faith is listening to brother branham now you're going to get inspired it's by the holy ghost absolutely but rapturing faith comes from god it's not on a tape right the point the tapes point to now brother brown has a quote where the anointing files the tapes yes i believe that yes i believe when you listen to a tape of brother brown the anointing can come people have been healed this day today people have been healed listening brother ram on the tape but the same is true for any preacher you can be healed reading this bible too hallelujah you can get a revelation reading the bible amen see but they're making it like you have to press play enough in order to go in the rapture that self man made righteousness and the very next day brother branham he was presuming on revelation 10 7 he said revelation 10 7 was how to enter into rapturing faith so did enoch and elijah's rapturing faith make them leap over walls so look at the next quote but this one didn't come from the earth he come down from heaven we talk about revelation 10 because the mystery is all finished and when the mysteries finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven thunders throwed their voices out what if now everybody say what if ready this is a what if this is not a thus saith the lord can ever understand so the day before he says rapturing faith he said we want it it's length you gotta it says lay in the messages right the next day says what if the seven thunders are something to let us know how to enter into rapturing faith is it will we run leap over walls and is there something fixing to happen that these old marred vile bodies are going to be changed can i live to see it oh lord is it so close that i'll see it is this the generation now church was it his generation to be raptured no brother ram did not go it did not get a body change to go in the rapture like the shout voice trump the trump of god it's a what if he was doing his best to prepare the people for the coming of the lord amen just like we're doing today we're doing our best to prepare you to meet christ in the air amen but only god knows the day of the hour sir is my brother what time is it where are we at i don't know i don't know sir see it's i don't know i don't know i'm only honest how many how many appreciate honest people i don't know is it time is is the mystery all finished he hasn't even preached the seven seals church this is three months before he reached the seven seals and he's asking is the mystery finished he don't even know has the sounding all over is that really them seven thunders fixing to utter out something that little group that has gathered together will receive a rapturing faith to go into the rapture when he comes this is all questions this is all this is all saying we want to be ready for the rapture for we'll all be changed as quick as the angels come in a moment a twink of an eye shall be caught together with those that sleep to meet the lord in the air my prayer is this god if this be so i don't know lord in other words are those seven thunderers going to utter out mysteries that will give us rapturing faith to go in the rapture now at the end of brother and his life in the church age book what did he say the seven thunders were he said they were the revelations contained in the seven seals that means all the revelations about the four horse riders the jews in the fifth seal the tribulation and the seven seal the coming of the lord the rapture so at the end of his ministry he allows it to go into print that we've already got these revelations amen now here's some more just see i want to i want you to see the whole these are all the rapturing faith quotes in 1953 church look at this ten years before that he says give us rapturing faith tonight how many want rapturing faith tonight well let me tell you like this if you've got the holy ghost baptism you've already got rapturing faith amen it's just going to be more of that because see if brother abraham died does he still have rapturing faith yes hallelujah when the dead in christ rise he'll come up amen everything you have needed of is already in you for your earthly journey praise god and also for the afterwards so did he have rapturing faith yes we'd say in one sense he did because if you got the holy ghost the bible says first corinthians 12 hallelujah it says if the spirit of god quickened jesus and he was raised from the dead so shall the holy spirit that's within you quicken your mortal body there it is hallelujah praise god amen uh let's see a month later oh god grant today praying we can all come together and see all those nine spiritual gifts moving through the church operating the whole church body then we'll have the rapture now see this is why some preachers believe we got to have all the nine gifts operating well i don't know that's that was a prayer but it wasn't thus saith the lord that's why preachers will hammer the church come on get your gifts in order get your gifts in order well if you've done all you can do you've got them in order you're just waiting for god to use you like i said you can't take god in your pocket and say well here's my here's my healing gift here but hang here you're sick i'll heal you because i have control i have full control over these gifts no you don't have full control you have partial control over your gifts see but see brother sia see brian how people can major on one quote but you got to take it back to the word does anybody see that i believe these quotes i mean i i can agree with them but it depends how far you take it the way it looks like to me is that all the gifts are just in the body somewhere because remember jesus said in john 14 12 he said greater works than thee shall you do because i go to my father the works that i do shall you do also he's talking about the whole church you can't you and i cannot add one cubit to our stature so all we have to do in other words to operate gifts is just lay before god just pray before him all the time serve god confess your sins and when god wants to use you church he's going to come find you amen you are a tool in god's toolbox can i say it like that would i need a tool do i got one down here no i don't well i mean i got an adapter that's a tool when i need that tool i just pick it up plug it in boom it works that's what god does with your life when god wants to use you to answer somebody's prayer god will use you praise god and here's your proof church here's your proof when god wants to use you he's going to use you praise god right brother bang now you might have had a revelation that that was going to finish it i don't know but did you have a revelation that was going to finish it do you know he didn't know neither did i i didn't know god was going to use you like that but i was what were you just waiting for god to use you amen just waiting there humbly say god use me god i'm making i'm crying out to jesus help me jesus amen hallelujah see i believe it's the spirit of the enemy that would want to just take one quote and twist it to try to deceive god's people or give them complexes right see remember holy ghost field people can have complexes and that would be the enemy brother man said it haunts him when he when he had a complex it haunts him holy ghost-filled people can have complexes haunting them they can have spirits they allow in their minds and if they don't drive them out it will haunt them that's why we can call the doctor of a devil because if it creates a complex that worships brother branham or causes pride in your life it is of the devil i love everybody here by god's grace thank you for suffering with me i never wanted to be a long-winded preacher but there's some things i just want to lay in there so just like brother said when you put a hammer and you just don't just you know tap it in and then you walk away no you really want that drywall to hang up you bang it in there amen you just put it all the way in there i believe one day we'll all be grateful that we sat this long and hear the word of god i've never been i've never been sad i did i'll say it like that here he says oil on your lamp is rapturing faith now that's real good like brother brandon if he died and had the baptism the holy ghost when that when the dead in christ rise he'll come up because he had rapturing faith in him there's your five wise virgins who had oil in their lamps rapturing faith glory believing i don't believe all the signs i'm going to believe all the wonders all the prophecies how many believe everything god does i thank god for all he does and all the churches the message churches and even denominational he'll answer some of those prayers i thank god for all that but rapturing faith will come through being baptized with the holy ghost now here brother says the pouring out of god's spirit will bring rapturing faith to the people there it is pouring out he didn't say it's on the tape if you take it back to the bible it comes from heaven it doesn't come from just a tape right maybe this is why preachers exalt the tapes because they misunderstand rapturing faith being on the tapes they think the tape has a holy ghost right but the holy ghost has to come from heaven okay now here's it's a long sentence but i believe the age has come now they're miraculous the phenomena this is the 1953 church this is 10 years before the seals i believe the rapture in faith the baptist holy spirit this great pouring out of god's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring faith into the people that'll take a rapturing faith that'll take the church into glory i believe i believe that i believe that it's got to come from heaven god's got to send faith to rapture us from heaven now next year but just the same god's moving on bringing the bringing in the rapturing faith for his church i could say amen to that if saints are going to die before the rapture they got to get the baptism the holy ghost that will be the rapturing faith they need for the dead in christ to rise first in 1954 they had to have rapturing faith now look he says right away we got to have it right away well we know that wasn't for the the body change rapture for the those that are alive in christ that had to be for those who needed the baptism of the holy ghost 12 years before he passed i'm sorry 11 years before he passed away no i'm sorry that was nine years sorry nine years i forgot to switch the dates there satan you have held them captive so long but you've exposed tonight jesus is coming soon for his church and he's trying to give them rapturing faith 1958 the power of the rapture and faith will be there at the time of the rapture i love this one the power of the church see this is what we're praying for church right here he says we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment between give an eye now remember don't don't don't get scared enoch had it in other words god will bring you to it elijah had it and he thought he was only one left but he wasn't there were seven thousand that didn't bother me you've got but don't worry see that's all i said but don't worry ready but don't worry don't worry it'll be there it's something that's there for you it's a gift to you because you have the baptism of the holy ghost it'll be there and when the power of this church rises now i don't know if he's talking about the dead in christ like the church age or he's talking about like a church in africa like a ghana church or a church in america i don't know he doesn't tell us when the power of this church rises it'll bring its brethren the power of that church will bring the other and then there'll be a general resurrection we're looking forward to it that's why some people think it'll start at maybe brother cam's church come to our church or brother brooks church come to our church see they got different ideas but you don't really say so what's the thing to do love god with all your heart be ready rapturing faith was a move of the spirit not just listening to tapes 1963 he says how can we sit here lord this ought to bring a rapturing faith the power of god that would sweep this whole audience and lord into higher heights and the glory of god we ought to have it in 1963. the first seal now he again links that's why some churches believe the thunders are necessary for the the latter rain that's why this is why i believe i mean it could be that but if i got the whole that's all that matters glory if i just got the holy ghost it don't matter if i got the oil i'm going out to meet the bridegroom amen hallelujah that's all that's required i need the oil i need the holy ghost in my soul and if i've got extra oil i'm going out i'm not running to try to find it i got it now praise god see what the devil does he tries to bring some quotes and tries to bring a misunderstanding of the quotes to get people off the real thing the real thing is like jesus said you must be born again hallelujah amen and how do you get born again repent of your sins be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost hallelujah somebody asked me at work or one of the parents of the students at work asked me what's your favorite verse and at first i said john 14 6 jesus saith in them i am the way the truth and life but then i thought i changed i said acts 2 38 give me acts 2 38. that's the greatest verse to me not to me that's my favorite verse to me no you know why church not because it's maybe the most beautiful brother man said it's the creed of the church he said it was the creed of the apostles if they had a creed but you know why because that's the first scripture i memorized brother vang when i came in the message and i quoted that thing over i bought one of those tape recorders with tape on it and i would just drive to class and i would i would just say that over and over again listen until i memorize that verse and i've seen that verse change my life i have seen glory i've seen that that verse was made a promise to me brother rang by brother brooks and brother craig and that promise came to pass hallelujah amen they weren't promising me something way out there i could never attain but no this is a promise i could grab a hold of this is a promise that grabbed a hold of me praise god amen hallelujah amen thank god just hang on that promise brother austin hang on that promise acts 2 38 hallelujah after all these years in the message what's my favorite verse the same one at the beginning hallelujah now you could you could debate we could have a good debate about which one brother jesse you should have said this but you know that's just what i said so we could debate that later see then there's he says this is future he says there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith that's why that movement in the 70s with the the seven thunders was so attractive to people they took this quote and they thought oh well it's got to be another preacher rise up and he's got to preach to seven thunders and he's got to have vindication and then he's got this light that's a it's a camera mistake is everybody with me see how the devil can take a few quotes i fear christians do not operate by fear they operate by faith hallelujah and the devil's using these cell phones as i said on wednesday night to bring in all these new disorders in other words spirits of fear that get on people if you want to do something pray first i love that quote brother i said before you do anything pray every day ask father say father shall i do this amen pray about it first take these desires and these concerns and these pressures and these fears take them before god say god what do you say about it amen and then just wait a few days before you act on it and the church said and then in 2005 wormwood was supposed to become a star and the angel was supposed to be behind that and destroy us all uh that didn't happen that got preached from message pulpits i had i printed it out off the internet because i thought it was so real i did that at the university of akron i remember printing that out in 2008 the market crashed everyone thought now oh obama's going to come in i anti-christ we lived through that 2015 the blood moons the pope came it was it was crazy here we lived through that 2020 the preacher from kentucky had the dream after the uh the united nations and russians were going to invade right after the election remember i showed you that all these things shake us up because we're human but each time we got to pray about each and every one praise god and remember the one thing that i need to focus on is to have oil praise god if i have oil i'm going out to meet him amen hallelujah if i've got oil i'll go out praise god if i don't i'll be looking for it but the thing to do is prepare bring it have the oil know that god is coming know that the bridegroom's coming and when you hear the shout go yet to meet him then you'll go out praise god god in simplicity this is after the seals the first one after the seals no yeah yeah the first one after jesus we got a bible here that speaks of this the rapture and here he is to identify his church to give it rapturing faith to take it away how could a person sit still see don't sit still receive the baptism of the holy ghost miracles brother man said miracles oh that's a typo miracles miracles ought to give us rapturing faith he says he said we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies when we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a god who can take a cancer let's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to shrug the healthy strong man that ought to give us rapturing faith to the people okay praise god i agree if you're born again and you've got the holy ghost that i'll give you rapturing faith because you already got it inside of you here he prayed for a great move of the spirit that the church might receive rapturing rapturing faith now this is at the end of the sermon i was on my birthday yeah 17 years before i was born that's why 17 is kind of mixed with my life i was born on the 17th this sermon was seven appreciate my birthday 17 years i don't know i just look for little just little things like that to encourage you uh lord years i've wanted to see this happen maybe it will make see look maybe maybe maybe just once more lord one great move of the spirit one more time lord and the church might receive rapturing faith to go in so he's he's praying maybe this is the rapture that's okay we should pray the same thing maybe this is the rapture amen so let's get ready praise god let's pray let's eat god let's give god all we have amen now brother brahm believed rapturing faith yet he took time to teach sunday schools to adult congregations think about that that and if you listen to some of these sermons when he says i'm a teacher sunday school he hardly ever raises his voice he's just teaching the word of god and yet he believed rapturing faith he said i would not try to he said i just try to make this a sunday school lesson so that would clearly understand so he tried to go slow like i'm going real slow today real long today and i'm looking for a time a break forth of the spirit of god these last days we're not living in for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for rapturing faith just before it comes in other words i'm gonna i'm gonna just i know rapturing faith is coming but i'm gonna sit down and go real slow and teach the people the word of god next quote brother branham believed the third poll would start the rapturing faith but said the lord did not tell him this so see that's why but austin we get this a lot around our ranks the brother graham said the lord never told me that the third paul was going to cause now the third poll is just the opening of the word it's the it's the word and demonstration it's speaking things right speaking healing speaking whatever speaking squirrels whatever they need them that's the third poll it's the power of the revealed word okay that's what it is brother man identifies it in this sermon he said i can't say much about it he says because i don't want him to say much about it the angel told him not to he says this is my opinion everybody say opinion ready i don't say the lord tells me this but the third poll will be the thing that starts the rapturing faith for the going away i must lay quiet for just a little while now remember you listen to this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right now dropping back not going up dropping back he says it can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up when the time comes but it's thoroughly vindicated it's tightening and when that time comes and the press comes to a place that you're pressed out then watch so press out of what having church watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third poll then see it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church so when the the government starts tightening down on christians he says watch the third pole then but he says the lord don't tell me that he said that's what i think it is but see a lot of people are awesome make that thus say the lord but he says the lord didn't tell him that we're closer than it seems to be i don't know when it's real close i may be building a platform for somebody else to step on i may be taken before that time i don't know and that time maybe this week that the spirit will come it might bring jesus christ he might come next week he might come yet tonight i don't know when he come he doesn't tell us that now look but i believe we're so close i would never die with old age right so right now brother man was born in 1909 so 2009 would have been 100 years okay so 101 110 113. 112. no i'm sorry 113. sorry he'd be 113 years old today but he says i think the coming is so close i would never die of old age before the lord came but most people die before they get to 113 right he said i just believe that and i say i want to say this i've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 30 years ago he says everything has happened just exactly now look i may not do it now church this i'll encourage you but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world why are we sending out these videos why are we sending out the podcasts all the youtube videos why are we sending out these postcards so that this world can be introduced to jesus christ amen and how will they do it by meeting brother vain he's a representative of jesus christ by meeting brother amen sister who i can walk and i'm not gonna do it i can walk around and shake all your hands right because jesus said when you did it to the least of these my brethren the least amen the glory the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me hallelujah this message this revelation we have will introduce jesus christ to the world that's what i met when i met dave lewell and i met jesus christ the holy spirit anointing dave well i said this guy is either the biggest fraud or he's got really christian love turned out he had really christian love i'm glad he did because i got the same thing later hallelujah amen he said the holy ghost look the holy ghost gives us rapturing faith i'm trying to go fast now now i think the church has got to come to that to a rapturing faith i may not have the faith just now but i sure won't stand in the way of somebody that did have the faith and church that that's how when you have the really holy spirit when you really have the holy spirit that's how you feel i'm not going to get in anybody's way i have no i have no vendettas against any preachers i'm not going to stand in anybody's way but i'm seeking rapturing faith and i will not send in anyone's way who's going to get it because i want all god's people to go in the rapture and i know all the predestinated ones will okay you've been gracious with me thank you thanks for your patience there we go thank you sir appreciate that good good ears i didn't hear that good too much screaming shouting going on for me that's why i surprised but see i i just have a question about that because what about enoch you know what about enoch what about elijah do we need more rapturing faith than they had or is it the same rapturing faith now personally i would just think it's the same i just feel like it just takes the time and season of the rapture right it just takes the timing of it those who are privileged and called to it will receive it okay for time's sake let me read this one okay this is i'm gonna close with this i'll do one more scripture okay so quote scripture i'm done everybody take a deep breath free almost done i want to read this last week when all those rumors about russia you know and ukraine and the nuclear wars and everything brother branham said we feel like we're going through a great time of distress and trials how many can say amen to that perplexity of the time and distress between the nations but look brother said picture yourself like this when there's distress among nations all kinds of things happening sometimes i get engulfed how many i feel like you get engulfed and all the all the all the fear and all the perplexity of nations you get engulfed in it he said everywhere i look it he said it's like we're in a ship out on the sea right and we see these big waves of russia big waves of ukraine big waves of north korea uh iran now it's iran right iran was bombing the u.s something something in the u.s over there in iran it's all these waves these nuclear waves and nuclear war uh fears right they're just waves on when you're out on the sea and i've been given charge of the boat but the ramp says i feel like i'm given charge of the boat how are we gonna make it when there's all these waves on the boat brother bam said here comes a white cap it's a hundred times bigger than my ship let's be honest russia's nuclear power they have way more they have a hundred times more power than i got as far as myself i haven't i have no nuclear weapons myself right if i if i have one gun at home i hope the big brother's not listening but you know that you never know is my one gun more powerful than nuke all of russia's nuclear wars so it's like a wave i'm in this boat and there's a wave a hundred times taller than me how am i gonna make it the thing is don't trust in your guns trust in the lord of the sea amen trust in the lord of the ocean trust in the lord of hosts amen hallelujah trust in the god of the mountains the god of the valleys the god of the seas amen the god of all the earth trust in the lord who reigns over all of it amen how are we going to make it church he says we will crest every one of them we are more than conquerors or victors through christ the great captain jesus christ he has a hold of a string on the end of our ship and he's pulling us through the waves amen hallelujah in other words really i'm not in charge of the boat you're not in charge of the boat somebody's got a hold of our boat amen so it's wave after a wave will rush over don't worry that guy's the great god that great lamb of god will not let go of the string amen those are hands you can trust those are nail scarred hands amen and he'll pull you through this way just like he did the 2008 wave the 2015 wave the 2000 wave all these waves he's going to pull us through church if we'll trust in the living god if we'll trust in the chief captain amen amen let's stand this scripture while i was praying musician's going to come this scripture i was praying here at the author just come to my mind some people out of fear are trying to get ready for the rapture but the way we do it is we get ready for the rapture with the love of god so it's the same idea i was saying earlier as long as you got the oil as long as you've got the oil of the holy ghost you've got the love of god and paul said when christ comes all those think about this all those that love him will see him hallelujah church this means the foolish virgin won't see him this means a foolish virgin doesn't love him like a real christian loves them see they've foolishly they've loved other things right if they don't see him as appearing it's because they didn't love they were afraid of the rapture oh my god they got so afraid of the tribulation they got so afraid of these things they for they failed to love jesus christ they were foolish and chose to be fearful at the time of the rapture rather than full of god's love how many want to be full of god's love today amen church can i say like this we've got thus saith the holy bible if you love jesus christ hallelujah now if you love jesus christ now you will see him at his appearing amen so love again is christ love is god god is love and god is the holy ghost god is the baptism of the holy ghost let's bow heads for a moment just play that little hymn o love of god how rich and pure how marvelous and strong [Music] heavenly father thank you god for the inspiration for this sermon i trust the people who are blessed i trust lord that they were inspired [Music] it was long and lengthy the lord i just felt like you want to fill us up today hallelujah thank you jesus the lord the enemy as we saw would try to exalt preachers even inside the message the enemy would try to exalt the churches inside the message but lord we've learned from the scriptures we're not exalting anyone we are all nothing we all get the same wage we all get a penny oh god hallelujah but it's the lord of the harvest it's the the god who gives the increase he's the great one he's the greatest of all time because he was like a lamb but he became like a goat hallelujah thank you jesus he was cursed so we didn't have to thank you lord and lord as we close this message oh and again thank you lord that you sent us these bible revelations and we can see how your prophet was bringing us truth he was growing in his understanding and we can see it all boils down to this the love of god the baptism of the holy ghost lord may each person sorry fall more in love with you dear god the bible tells us there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord shall give us at that day and not to us only but to all those that love his appearing lord we battle fears and then when we hear the news the lord may we just take everything to you in prayer dear god and may we remember that the great captain of the ship has a hold on our destination he's going to make sure we're pulled through lord god yes we'll have to get hit with some waves yes we'll have to deal with some storms but our ultimate destiny is in your hands dear god and you'll help us crest every one of them we'll pull through by the grace of god because you're in control now lord may each person be decided in their heart lord that they will live for the love of god may each person follow acts 2 38 lord surely that promise as it was made real to me lord god in my own life as it was promised to me lord god one day when i wasn't even worried about it you'd come by and fill me with the holy ghost today after i got married i wasn't even worried about it i for kind of forgotten about it the lord is just like the wind it comes whenever we don't expect it it just comes when it's coming you just found me in a position i was ready so i want to say thank you lord god thank you for sending that holy ghost god made each person continue to serve you and trust that you will keep your promise and you will dear god we thank you for all your blessings from today's service in jesus christ's name the saint said let's sing this song if anyone desires prayer you you're more welcome to come join our faith with yourself lord [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] if we with ink let's see numbers on earth [Music] oh
