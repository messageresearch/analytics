[38:00] yes surly looking forward to this and so
[38:02] enjoyed this morning's message what a
[38:04] wonderful powerful message we're so
[38:07] grateful
[38:07] I just felt different leaving this place
[38:10] this morning so I'm very thankful for
[38:11] that
[38:12] that's why I went the Word of God to do
[38:14] to me every time praise the Lord changed
[38:16] my life more and more amen can't you see
[38:20] the bride Elijah it's just about
[38:25] hold

[40:09] this world is the will I'm ready for
[40:15] deliverance Lord in this all before
[40:26] amen
[40:28] praise the Lord there's something about
[40:32] going home amen you know the thing about
[40:35] going to heaven when we go to heaven
[40:39] we're not going to a place we've never
[40:41] in we're just going back home you know
[40:45] the Lord allows me to travel a little
[40:47] bit and been to a lot of places and met
[40:51] a lot of wonderful people but there's
[40:53] always something about the night before
[40:56] when it's time to go home
[40:58] you know you there's the many a
[41:00] sleepless night that thank you brother
[41:02] many sleepless night that afraid
[41:05] oversleep missed the plane you know
[41:07] inside you get up every two hours make
[41:10] sure you've not overslept and time you
[41:11] get on the plane you're about dead but
[41:13] you're going home you know and but the
[41:15] most wonderful thing about this trip
[41:17] home we don't have to worry about being
[41:18] late we'll be right on time amen amen
[41:23] and the thing you know we are we are
[41:26] consuming the vitamins for a body change
[41:29] a man and you know like Enoch walked
[41:33] with God and he was not because God took
[41:35] him and you know you think of all the
[41:38] times that Enoch walked with God I
[41:39] wonder what they talked about whatever
[41:42] it was they talked about it gave Enoch
[41:44] enough faith that when God said I I'm
[41:47] gonna go home me Knox he'll I'll just go
[41:49] with you
[41:49] amen and so he must have caught some
[41:52] kind of revelation that he had been a
[41:54] part of God to begin with man and so he
[41:56] just could go back to where he came from
[41:58] and so may the Lord reach the blush we
[42:00] certainly enjoyed being here first time
[42:02] we've been up this this part of Ohio
[42:03] before but we've we find it very warm
[42:06] and we appreciate all that was done for
[42:08] us the the food the room that was given
[42:10] that we could rest in and may God richly
[42:12] bless you be a prayer and we trust if we
[42:15] don't see you no more on this side it
[42:17] will be seeing you on the other side
[42:19] amen because I believe by by God's grace
[42:23] I'll be there
[42:24] amen only by His grace amen you know i
[42:28] someone Samia you know to pray for him
[42:33] son brother I'm sick will you pray for
[42:35] me you know and I just sit back and said
[42:36] His grace is sufficient and it is is
[42:39] that not right if we if we can find the
[42:41] grace of God for our lives that's
[42:43] sufficient for all that we have need of
[42:45] the grace of Almighty God if you have
[42:48] your Bibles this evening turn with us to
[42:50] the book of st. John and I think brother
[42:52] Smith told me last night that something
[42:54] folks have to travel and so we don't
[42:55] want to keep you long and oh you got to
[42:57] drive back this evening or and so we
[43:00] just have a simple little fault here
[43:01] that the Lord put on our hearts and we
[43:03] trusted to be a blessing to you we want
[43:05] to read from the book of st. John
[43:07] chapter 20 verse 21 and we just
[43:11] certainly wonderful to be here this
[43:13] afternoon amen
[43:15] sonna kind of goes long lives with what
[43:18] we looked at this morning and yet just a
[43:19] little bit different but we trusted to
[43:21] be a blessing to you something be said
[43:23] to help you and it courage you along the
[43:25] way
[43:26] amen the Bible says this in st. John
[43:32] 20:21 then said Jesus to them again
[43:36] peace be unto you as my father hath sent
[43:42] me even so send I you and when he had
[43:47] said this he breathed on them and said
[43:50] unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost amen
[43:55] let us bow our heads you said brother no
[43:58] that's not script that's not much
[44:00] Scripture but I believe it's enough amen
[44:03] amen
[44:04] Heavenly Father Lord once again we
[44:07] discounted such an honor together here
[44:09] with your people Lord and in your
[44:11] presence and we thank you dear God for
[44:13] the Liberty we felt here this morning to
[44:15] bring your word Lord knowing dear God
[44:18] that your word having its preeminence in
[44:20] our lives what would bring a subject to

[46:05] you you may be seated this afternoon I
[46:08] want to speak to you for a few minutes
[46:10] this evening on sent by the father sent
[46:14] by the father you know brother Branham
[46:18] told the story of the master violinist
[46:20] and I know we've all heard that story
[46:22] we've listened to it heard it on tapes
[46:24] but he talked about how that they had an
[46:26] old violin that there's gonna auction
[46:27] off and they wanted to sell him but
[46:29] nobody wanted this finally and it kind
[46:31] of had some scars on it a little bit
[46:33] dusty kind of out of tune and so the
[46:35] auctioneer he's gonna auction off this
[46:37] violin and so he held him up before the
[46:40] people and he said who'll give me $100
[46:42] and everybody just looked at him he said
[46:44] I'd he'll give me $50 and they just
[46:46] looked at him and $25 and they just
[46:49] looked at him and I thought you know
[46:50] I've preached in that church before it
[46:52] hurt of people just kind of look at you
[46:53] you know and and so he got on down he
[46:55] said $20 and $15 and $10 and nobody
[46:59] would make a bid on the valley and no
[47:01] body wanted the violin and so the
[47:04] auctioneer seemed that he wasn't going
[47:06] to get a bid on he said come on folks
[47:07] are you even looking at he said who
[47:09] would just give me a dollar would
[47:10] anybody just give me a dollar and nobody
[47:13] wanted to bid on the valley and the so
[47:15] he said well going once going twice
[47:17] before I take it off the market does
[47:19] anybody want it and finally the
[47:21] opposite in the back an old gray-haired
[47:23] man stood up and he stepped out of the
[47:27] audience and he said may I see the
[47:29] violin that he picked up the violin and
[47:32] he began to take a rag and he wiped all
[47:35] the dust off of it and he reached into
[47:37] his pocket and he pulled out some rosin
[47:40] and he Rosalind up the bow and he began
[47:42] to tune it up and he stuck it up under
[47:44] his chin and he began to strike across
[47:46] the strings that whole volley and begin
[47:48] to play down at the cross where my
[47:51] Savior died and as you begin to play the
[47:54] Spiller Lord begin to move into the
[47:55] building and people begin to cry their
[47:58] eyes begin to tear up and and the
[47:59] auctioneer caught the moment and he
[48:01] begin to say now who will give me $50
[48:03] and he'll give me $100 a 500 a thousand
[48:07] 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 and the Hulk the
[48:11] valley just kept going up and going up
[48:12] in value now what was that what was that
[48:16] what caused that violin from just a few
[48:20] minutes ago we have just been an old
[48:21] piece of wood that nobody wanted to all
[48:24] of a sudden becoming a priceless
[48:26] instrument what was it what done it what
[48:29] what moved the people like that and the
[48:32] prophet of God said what it was was the
[48:34] difference was this that the master the
[48:38] master the one who knew the volleying he
[48:41] said the one who had been the valley and
[48:43] he knew how to get out of it what was in
[48:46] it you see he was the creator of the
[48:48] violin hallelujah and he knew how to get
[48:52] out of this instrument what was in the
[48:54] instrument you see the violin was only
[48:56] the expression of the master who built
[48:59] it he had within himself this certain
[49:02] music he had within himself these
[49:05] certain sounds that he wanted to express
[49:07] that I bet he didn't have an instrument
[49:10] that would express it the piano couldn't
[49:12] do it the guitar couldn't do it the
[49:14] drugs could not make the sound that he
[49:17] wanted it to make it so he had this
[49:19] image he had this sound within him and
[49:21] so he he under inspiration he began to
[49:24] create an instrument that would express
[49:26] what was in him you see the violin
[49:30] became the very inspiration of the
[49:33] master the
[49:34] the heart the very fat passion of the
[49:37] violinists was expressed through that
[49:39] Valley a man he created himself this
[49:45] instrument that would Express the sound
[49:47] that was within you and with that in
[49:50] mind let me say this afternoon that God
[49:52] was in Christ doing what God was in
[49:56] Christ expressing himself to the world
[50:00] God was expressing himself to the world
[50:02] through Jesus Christ moment had seen the
[50:05] father in any time amen because the
[50:09] father was a spirit but only the
[50:12] begotten of the father had declared him
[50:14] Jesus declared he is here but not only
[50:18] did he declare that he's here he defined
[50:20] that he's in here and he made God was in
[50:24] Christ expressing himself to the world
[50:27] what his attitude was or his thought of
[50:30] the world was how he lived the world was
[50:33] all expressed through Jesus Christ
[50:35] he so loved the world that he laid down
[50:38] his own life for it and the only way
[50:40] that God could die as a mortal he had to
[50:42] become immortal so God was in Christ
[50:46] expressing his thoughts to the world as
[50:49] we read this morning Jeremiah 29:11 said
[50:51] I know the thoughts I think towards you
[50:54] saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[50:56] of evil to give you and expected in a
[50:59] man God said I have these thoughts
[51:02] towards you when I think of you I don't
[51:04] think of evil oh god I want to make you
[51:07] shout this afternoon I don't think of
[51:10] evil when I think of you I think of
[51:12] peace I think of dead thoughts oh man it
[51:17] meant sometimes you know we think a
[51:18] little bit about ourself we we see our
[51:20] weaknesses we see our failures we see
[51:23] our struggles and sometimes we don't
[51:25] think of myself exactly right but if we
[51:27] could ever cast them what I think about
[51:29] myself and take what God thinks about me
[51:32] amen sometimes we get undermined well if
[51:35] our church can be like this church or if
[51:37] our church was like that at church said
[51:39] we would have a better Church but God
[51:41] made us the way he wanted us to be
[51:44] nobody can take your place amen
[51:48] you know sometimes young people get in
[51:50] my will if I look like this person here
[51:52] I would be more popular if I had their
[51:54] color eyes or if I had their color hair
[51:56] but you see God made us exactly the way
[51:59] that he wanted us hey man he made you
[52:03] see us just started thinking well you
[52:05] know if we had a bigger crowd we could
[52:07] have a bigger service that's not true
[52:10] amen but the devil will make us think
[52:12] that way well we're just a small crowd
[52:14] so we can't really do anything for God
[52:16] God don't need a house for God just
[52:18] needs words so they've said have got to
[52:21] get one person in his head
[52:23] yeah turn the world upside to hell amen
[52:26] God said and I said I'm not thoughts are
[52:28] not your thoughts at the Lord neither
[52:30] are my ways your ways God said I don't
[52:32] think like you think amen
[52:36] my thoughts are not your thoughts what
[52:38] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[52:39] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[52:41] thoughts in your thoughts God made us
[52:43] just the way he wanted us to be there's
[52:45] a certain note there's a certain -
[52:47] there's a certain song that God wants to
[52:49] play out of our life that no one else
[52:51] can play God of notice the way he wants
[52:55] to use to say man
[52:56] God will bring us down a certain Road
[52:58] just show others say hey I can bring
[53:00] anybody from anywhere I could take a
[53:03] drunk and make a preacher out of told
[53:05] somebody I could take a failure and make
[53:07] them a success I am God the Creator I
[53:10] could do what I wanted him very much
[53:14] hallelujah glory be to God God made us
[53:17] just the way he wanted us today hey man
[53:21] Oh hallelujah you know you think well ha
[53:25] I brother down you just don't understand
[53:26] that
[53:27] I had these thoughts about myself well
[53:29] cast down our thoughts and take me or
[53:32] I'll destroy you one time that there was
[53:34] a homeless person laying on the street
[53:35] and an artist walked off you said sir
[53:38] I'd like to paint you I'll pay you gosh
[53:41] it sure ain't got no money
[53:43] paint me so the artist was painting knew
[53:45] he made me look over any minute painting
[53:48] and he got then he said here sir take
[53:50] this money and the guy said wait a
[53:52] minute
[53:52] if you painted me just let me see the
[53:55] painting he said oh sure
[53:58] and he turned it around now this was a
[53:59] bum laying in the street raggedy clothes
[54:01] but when he turned the picture around it
[54:04] was a fine well-dressed young man
[54:06] squares all six-pack abs you know just
[54:12] well-dressed well-groomed and that the
[54:16] homeless guy said who is that and the
[54:19] artist said that's you he said me that's
[54:23] me
[54:23] he said well you see that's the way I
[54:26] see you and the burglars ever said if
[54:34] that's the man you see then that's the
[54:37] man I'll be a man we live in ourselves
[54:39] as homeless sometimes why I got this if
[54:42] we can ever see yourself the way God
[54:44] sees us you know I was similar the other
[54:49] day I was looking at some work I did it
[54:52] impressed me at all I just be honest
[54:53] with you I looked at that I didn't see
[54:55] nothing you know they say art is in the
[54:57] eye of the beholder aha I must have had
[54:59] mine shut because this just looked like
[55:02] a butcher that's what it looked like my
[55:05] fault I looked at that the first thought
[55:07] came to my mind was my dog could paint
[55:09] better than that I'm being honest I
[55:12] looked at that I thought they look like
[55:14] some first grader had finger painted
[55:16] this picture I said what is that doing
[55:20] here and then I got to looking at it you
[55:22] know what it was worth
[55:24] 104 million dollars I thought my
[55:29] goodness isn't that lovely 104 million
[55:37] dollars I thought why is that picture
[55:40] worth so much money and then I look
[55:42] closer you know what it was a Picasso a
[55:47] Picasso you see it wasn't ho going to
[55:50] God it wasn't what the painting looked
[55:53] like it was the one who painted it we
[55:58] might not look like much to the world
[55:59] but what they failed to see is the
[56:02] signature that's on their name
[56:04] sons and daughters of the Most High God
[56:07] mrs. Jesus Christ the Bride of Christ
[56:10] where are my manners
[56:12] gonna make fun of us we may not look
[56:14] like much to them but the signature we
[56:17] have the name above all names very man
[56:21] oh yeah baby to God hallelujah you see
[56:30] God has signed his name to our life amen
[56:34] he made you the way he wanted you for
[56:38] the job that he wanted you to do we
[56:41] think sometimes why do we have such
[56:43] struggles why do we have such trials in
[56:45] her life you know Bevin talked about his
[56:47] little girl Sharon Rose and how she
[56:50] suffered before she died until her eyes
[56:53] crossed in her head but you see you
[56:57] think why why would a man of God have to
[57:00] experience something like that
[57:02] did you see it mo did something in the
[57:04] Prophet that the Prophet said from that
[57:07] time on that was never a cross-eyed
[57:09] child
[57:10] come on the platform but what he didn't
[57:12] think I was a little girl you see it put
[57:15] something in his heart that when he saw
[57:18] that he could you see you can't help
[57:20] somebody until you can for somebody
[57:23] you've got to have compassion for
[57:24] somebody that's what the world's dying
[57:27] for is that compassion and he said there
[57:32] wasn't a cross that job at one time
[57:34] across the platform but what God healed
[57:36] him without even the prayer why he was
[57:39] molded that way God moded him because
[57:42] God wanted to express that through him
[57:45] and he made him for the job that he
[57:47] needed to do amen so we got a choice the
[57:50] second we can either think our thoughts
[57:52] which are not very good most of the time
[57:55] or we can take his thoughts God said my
[57:59] thoughts are not your thoughts unless
[58:01] God's thoughts and your thoughts would
[58:04] be the same thoughts now God's gonna
[58:10] change his thoughts to fit you but he
[58:12] will change your thoughts to fit his
[58:14] [Applause]
[58:15] amen you said without killing man think
[58:19] God stops I think so I think the Bible
[58:22] tells us there let me show you what I
[58:25] mean who created the animals that's
[58:28] right it's not a trick question God did
[58:29] God created the animals it's funny yes
[58:33] question huh it's not a trick question
[58:38] God created the animals but who named
[58:42] them all of you now how did Adam know
[58:46] what to name that animal that God
[58:48] created because Adam had the same badge
[58:51] it's God be a man Oh Adam said you're a
[58:58] monkey you're a cheetah you're a bear
[59:00] you're an eagle and God said amen that's
[59:03] exactly what I was thinking you know God
[59:09] they say Adam come to come here son come
[59:11] here so you're doing a good job
[59:12] daddy's proud of me man just one little
[59:13] thing you called that right there an
[59:15] elephant that son that elephant that's a
[59:17] mouse now watch it and watch it he'd
[59:19] never done that he said you're a cheetah
[59:22] you're a monkey you're a barrier an
[59:23] eagle hey God said amen
[59:25] that's exactly what I was thinking and
[59:27] God had a middle son of God who stood in
[59:29] this day and he said I no longer call
[59:31] you Church I no longer call you
[59:33] Methodist I no longer call you bamboo
[59:35] but I call you the bride of Jesus Christ
[59:37] and God said that's exactly what I was
[59:40] thinking
[59:43] booyah hey man the Bible says in second
[59:49] Corinthians 5:19 to wit God was in
[59:52] Christ reconciling the world unto
[59:54] himself not imputing their trespasses
[59:56] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[59:59] word of reconciliation amen
[1:00:03] the Bible said God Himself dwelt in
[1:00:05] jesus christ jesus said the father
[1:00:07] dwells in me so if you can find out what
[1:00:10] God thinks about mankind you can find
[1:00:12] out what Jesus said about mankind and
[1:00:14] you know what the father thought about
[1:00:16] mankind because he was the expression of
[1:00:20] God's thoughts even the father himself
[1:00:22] on Mount Transfiguration what did he say
[1:00:25] this is my beloved son he
[1:00:28] there ye Tim don't hear nothing else
[1:00:33] don't listen to no other voice hear what
[1:00:36] he says here you didn't say hear you
[1:00:41] then hear um listen to no other voice
[1:00:48] not even your own if it's contrary to
[1:00:52] his words come on amen but you said this
[1:00:57] morning that the bride would be the
[1:00:59] final voice but you should hear him
[1:01:01] though here you live that's exactly
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:03] don't you understand what it is the
[1:01:05] voice of the last day in the bride it's
[1:01:06] his voice in her are you saying the same
[1:01:10] thing jesus said I'm the light of the
[1:01:12] world did he turn say you're in the
[1:01:14] light of the world
[1:01:14] so who's the light in the world Jesus
[1:01:16] are you did Jesus suffer from amnesia
[1:01:18] did he forget what he said no he was
[1:01:21] given us a revelation he said on the
[1:01:23] light of the world then he said no the
[1:01:24] light of the world what is it it's
[1:01:26] Christ in us a man reflected himself
[1:01:29] making himself let's say yesterday today
[1:01:32] and forever amen we can find out through
[1:01:35] the life of Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] what God's attitude was towards the
[1:01:38] sinner what is attitude worse towards
[1:01:41] the sick when his attitude was towards
[1:01:43] the prostitute to the gambler to the
[1:01:45] beggar we can find out God's permanent
[1:01:47] attitude towards these same matters
[1:01:49] today because he's the same yesterday
[1:01:51] today and forever
[1:01:53] so whatever God thought about that
[1:01:55] through Jesus Christ God thinks that
[1:01:58] same thoughts through his bride because
[1:02:01] Jesus Christ was God's thoughts
[1:02:03] expressed on the earth he was the
[1:02:06] expression of what God was thinking amen
[1:02:11] his attitude towards the sinner he
[1:02:13] forgave him his attitude towards the
[1:02:15] sick he'll do his attitude towards the
[1:02:19] prostitute he changed them his attitude
[1:02:22] towards the gambler he delivered them
[1:02:25] you know what I thought about these
[1:02:27] things look to Jesus Christ for he was
[1:02:30] the very heart of God expressed
[1:02:35] amen amen Jesus Christ was the
[1:02:38] expression of how God wanted man to live
[1:02:42] on the earth let me say that again Jesus
[1:02:45] Christ was the expression of how God
[1:02:48] wanted man to live on the earth when
[1:02:50] Adam fell in the garden he fell from the
[1:02:53] position that God intended for man to be
[1:02:55] on the earth what was course when he
[1:02:58] come to earth he was a god man that's
[1:03:01] exactly right
[1:03:02] he was a man when he stood at Lazarus
[1:03:04] grave and well but when he threw his
[1:03:06] shoulders back and said Lazarus come
[1:03:08] forth that was more than a man that was
[1:03:10] God speaking he was a man when he tried
[1:03:13] to rest from the boat cause he was tired
[1:03:14] but when he stood up and put his foot on
[1:03:16] the bow and stretched forth his hand and
[1:03:18] said peace be still that was more than a
[1:03:21] man that was God manifested in flesh God
[1:03:24] speaking to his creation and that's the
[1:03:27] way God intends for us to live upon the
[1:03:29] earth while as a man but as a god man a
[1:03:32] new race a super race of people right
[1:03:35] man with the spoken word of God but
[1:03:37] their Lord manifested by them say what
[1:03:40] you see done these things times in my
[1:03:41] ministry you'll see it done in the
[1:03:43] fullness of the blood very much Oh
[1:03:47] hallelujah
[1:03:49] hey man well Jesus came to Laodicea age
[1:03:53] of Israel he was so different from what
[1:03:57] they were used to but it wasn't the way
[1:03:59] he dressed he dressed like everybody
[1:04:02] else it was the way he lived
[1:04:05] amen if she was so different that they
[1:04:09] said what manner of man is this if
[1:04:14] you're looking up it's what tribe what
[1:04:16] nation what race a man who you you know
[1:04:26] I hate you smart I'm from Tennessee I'm
[1:04:27] a hillbilly but just one thing I know

[1:05:37] master had built Jesus was built by the
[1:05:42] word to express God's thoughts towards
[1:05:45] man what made him so different he was
[1:05:49] sent by the father to be that expression
[1:05:53] what did Jesus say himself I always do
[1:05:56] that which is pleasing to my father I
[1:05:58] got not to do my will but to do the will
[1:06:01] of him who sent me when did he tell Mary
[1:06:06] when she said to him just a young boy in
[1:06:07] the temple she said your father and I
[1:06:09] have sought you with tears but the world
[1:06:12] yet young corrected the error he said
[1:06:16] know ye not I must be about my father's
[1:06:18] business what was the father's business
[1:06:22] but then to take the Word of God
[1:06:24] oh then Isaiah said what Moses said he
[1:06:27] was the fulfillment of the words of the
[1:06:29] Prophet and he said I must be about my
[1:06:31] father's business that's the secret of
[1:06:34] the message now where is the bride to do
[1:06:36] in this last night we must be about the
[1:06:38] Father's business hallelujah to
[1:06:41] vindicate Malachi 4 route 1730

[1:07:05] father that sent Jesus came in him and

[1:07:10] can't believe me believe the works that
[1:07:12] I do for they will tell you who I am
[1:07:19] amen amen
[1:07:21] Jesus after his resurrection he appeared
[1:07:24] unto his disciples and he gave them the
[1:07:26] great commission Galliard all the world
[1:07:29] to every creature and these signs shall
[1:07:32] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:07:35] shall cast out Devils speak with new
[1:07:37] tongues take up serpents they shall
[1:07:38] drink deadly things and they will not
[1:07:40] harm them if they lay their hands on the
[1:07:42] sick they shall recover that's what he
[1:07:45] said here ye here then he said this as
[1:07:52] the father hath sent me even so send I
[1:07:56] you
[1:07:57] the father that sent the son went with
[1:07:59] the son and was in the Sun and the Jesus
[1:08:01] ascends us goes with us and is in us
[1:08:05] taking what making him to say yesterday
[1:08:08] today and forever amen he just changed
[1:08:13] his mask like a great pray what somebody
[1:08:19] would have four or five different parts
[1:08:20] it's the same person they just changed
[1:08:23] their masks and the god that was in the
[1:08:27] sun the dog that was in the group was
[1:08:30] now in the bride making them worn by the
[1:08:33] same word by the same spirit by the same
[1:08:36] life by the same gun a wood bone of my
[1:08:41] bone flesh of my flesh the groom and the
[1:08:44] bride uniting as one the same ministry
[1:08:48] amen Oh glory to God the Father sent me
[1:08:53] even so send I you
[1:08:55] amen even to the end of the world and
[1:08:58] the works that I do shall you do
[1:09:01] also and greater works than these
[1:09:06] greater works but message you can't do
[1:09:09] nothing greater and raise the dead
[1:09:10] put-put aizen's in somebody's head I
[1:09:12] didn't gotten alive
[1:09:13] but what it means is more works more
[1:09:17] what did the prophet of God say he's
[1:09:20] done more in my little ministry than he
[1:09:22] did in his own doing what fulfilling st.
[1:09:26] John 14:12 the works I do show you do
[1:09:28] also and greater works why because that
[1:09:31] the groom was one body but the bride is
[1:09:34] a mini membered body all over the world
[1:09:37] signs and wonders are being done what
[1:09:44] did Elijah have a double portion of the
[1:09:46] largest Eric what did Elijah say to him
[1:09:51] if you see me when I go you can have
[1:09:54] what you asked for what do you wanna
[1:09:56] last you you followed me all these years
[1:09:58] you follow me through all these pools
[1:10:00] what do you want
[1:10:01] he didn't even bat an eye he saw Elijah
[1:10:05] do great things he could have said I
[1:10:07] want a ministry just like yours but
[1:10:09] that's not what he said he said I want a
[1:10:11] double portion is that not true and did
[1:10:18] he get it did he get what he asked for
[1:10:20] yes because the Prophet said Elijah did
[1:10:22] four miracles and he lasted an eight oh
[1:10:27] boy to God that's another message for
[1:10:31] another time but who a man a man the
[1:10:35] last he lived he sent back to the church
[1:10:37] on the day of Pentecost and birth that
[1:10:39] church by his life the Spirit of God in
[1:10:42] his church one for what did he do it for

[1:10:50] have it you ever thought about that he's
[1:10:53] God he can do what he wants to sis

[1:11:00] else you go over there he's God who are
[1:11:03] we to tell God how to run his business
[1:11:05] the God didn't do that he didn't do that
[1:11:09] he said a son he bled and died for us he
[1:11:11] saved us of our sins he justified us not
[1:11:13] only the free works of grace No
[1:11:15] Fozzy Seca father's not only st. us he
[1:11:18] gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:20] which is his very life his spirit the
[1:11:22] pulsation of the Spirit of God
[1:11:23] hallelujah the Holy Ghost dog's life he
[1:11:29] gave me but why did he do that he didn't
[1:11:32] have to do it but he did why did he give
[1:11:35] us his life to continue his works to
[1:11:39] make him the same yesterday today and
[1:11:41] forever we don't have to point back to
[1:11:44] 65 to make God the same some of us
[1:11:48] wasn't even born I was but most of you
[1:11:50] wasn't born brother Jesse at 65 I know
[1:11:52] you wouldn't you're too young looking
[1:11:54] huh we don't have to go all the way back
[1:11:56] before Jesse was born to make God the
[1:11:58] same somebody needs to make him the same
[1:12:00] today he's the same today if we don't
[1:12:04] make Jesus Christ the same today we care
[1:12:07] our Commission a very Mario it's right
[1:12:11] here on brother Jesse's whoa Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:12:15] forever how are we making the same by
[1:12:20] continuous works today What did he say I
[1:12:24] always do that which pleases my father I
[1:12:26] come not to do my own will but the will
[1:12:28] of the Father who has sent me
[1:12:30] he sends his church the same way that
[1:12:33] God sent him the God that City went with
[1:12:38] him and was eating and Christ that since
[1:12:40] the church goes with the church and his
[1:12:42] in the church the very same works so
[1:12:44] then we see now that we are sent by the
[1:12:47] father sent by the father you are God's
[1:12:51] attitude you are God's thoughts
[1:12:54] expressed to a dying generation who see
[1:13:02] understand will not here by chance we're
[1:13:04] not even here as church members we are
[1:13:07] here as sons and daughters of God God
[1:13:11] placed us for such a time as this
[1:13:14] to be the expression of his thoughts for
[1:13:17] this age and you are God's attitude
[1:13:20] expressed you are God's thoughts on
[1:13:22] display to this dying generation

[1:14:15] the expression of God to Akron Ohio that
[1:14:21] they could say I saw God today I saw God

[1:15:17] than you would if you had a hundred it's
[1:15:19] not the amount we have it's the desire
[1:15:21] we have to do it sometimes all it takes

[1:20:43] see now you then do you realize you are
[1:20:46] a gift to Laodicea a gift God wrapped
[1:20:53] himself in humanity once again not the

[1:20:59] humanity of the body of the bride she's
[1:21:02] God's love gift to blonde I gotta see
[1:21:06] that the world would see Jesus you know
[1:21:14] in closing I heard a story it's always

[1:22:04] apples and they ran right over the top
[1:22:06] of her they knocked the card over
[1:22:08] knocked the girl off the students do
[1:22:10] with her apples went everywhere but they
[1:22:12] kept on running because they were late
[1:22:14] but when they got to the late gate one
[1:22:16] of them got the feeling bad and he told
[1:22:19] his buddy said hey you guys go on so I'm

[1:23:12] ones it was bruised he set him off to
[1:23:14] the side so she wouldn't sell a bad
[1:23:16] apple and all the ones that were good he
[1:23:17] cleaned him up with his handkerchief and
[1:23:19] stacked them back up he reached into his
[1:23:21] pocket he pulled out $20 and he laid it
[1:23:23] in her hand he said here's a $20 bill

[1:24:10] praying I said Jesus would you help me

[1:24:37] I couldn't see my wife wearing a dress
[1:24:42] if my neighbor was blind do I live such
[1:24:46] a life that my blind neighbor could
[1:24:51] still see Jesus as the father has sent
[1:24:56] me even so he was the heart of God
[1:25:03] expressed when God gave us Jesus Christ
[1:25:07] he gave us his very hard
[1:25:13] let us show his love his mercy His grace
[1:25:26] no God knows my heart if I was to die
[1:25:31] they rolled my body up here y'all had a
[1:25:33] funeral but just I don't care if he ever
[1:25:36] knows I ever preached interested in some
[1:25:39] time
[1:25:40] I don't care sister they ever know how
[1:25:43] many places I go to how many services a
[1:25:47] I thank God for everything allows me to
[1:25:51] do but that's not where the emphasis is
[1:25:55] but if I roll my body up here you know
[1:25:57] what I would won't say no for me not how
[1:26:00] much I travel not how many places not
[1:26:03] how many sermons have preached but that
[1:26:05] won't somebody to say hopefully my
[1:26:08] children or my wife
[1:26:11] that they would say oh Jesus Jesus can
[1:26:31] we live that life can we live such a
[1:26:33] life as that not within our cell friends
[1:26:36] there's no way we could ever do that
[1:26:37] within ourselves because he's not called
[1:26:40] us to reform so it's not well I want to
[1:26:43] try to do better there's only one way
[1:26:45] that that could ever live to us is for
[1:26:47] us to die to ourselves and be born again
[1:26:50] of his spirit that the world would see
[1:26:54] Jesus once again a man as the father has
[1:26:59] sent me even so send I you let the
[1:27:05] master this afternoon
[1:27:06] let him take us into his hands Betty
[1:27:09] motors and shapers wipe the dust of lay
[1:27:13] out of seal half of us oh we're going to
[1:27:15] have a few scars that just shows we've
[1:27:17] been in the battle but what about scars
[1:27:22] sometimes the scars it's what gives the
[1:27:25] furniture character but let our lives
[1:27:30] play Amazing Grace why would he do that
[1:27:35] for us because he looked down through
[1:27:38] Calvary and he said he was worth it
[1:27:43] he thought I was worth Savin so he came
[1:27:50] and changed my life
[1:27:52] he thought I was worth keeping so he
[1:27:57] cleaned me up inside he thought I was to
[1:28:00] die for
[1:28:02] so he sacrificed his life so I could be
[1:28:07] free so I could be oh so I could tell
[1:28:11] everyone I know he thought I was worth
[1:28:16] saving so he came and changed my life
[1:28:22] he thought I was worth keeping a cure so
[1:28:27] he cleaned me up inside he thought I was
[1:28:30] to die for
[1:28:33] so he sacrificed his life so I could be
[1:28:38] free so I could be oh so I could tell
[1:28:42] everyone I know he thought I was worth
[1:28:48] saving Oh Lord Jesus

[1:39:10] the chin of the master Lord all great
[1:39:13] Jehovah take us under your wing granny
[1:39:18] Lord God I remember years ago
[1:39:22] I come in from a meeting it was really
[1:39:24] late at night about 3:30 in the morning
[1:39:27] I knew my girls would be getting up in
[1:39:29] just a few hours to go to school and I
[1:39:30] didn't want to go upstairs and wake up
[1:39:32] my wife so I have an old green chair
[1:39:34] there and got me a cup of coffee set out
[1:39:38] in that chair just thought I'd wait to
[1:39:40] the Sun come up and don't ever forget
[1:39:42] this I begin to think about the service
[1:39:46] and we had a big prayer line that night
[1:39:47] and I was thinking about all the people
[1:39:48] that came through the prayer line and I
[1:39:50] was asking God once again to meet their
[1:39:53] need bless I was just different ones
[1:39:55] that come to my mind a different request
[1:39:57] sitting there watching the Sun begin to
[1:39:59] break up over the hills of Tennessee all
[1:40:02] at once I heard a noise upstairs
[1:40:04] it was my youngest one ally she come
[1:40:08] bouncing down the steps getting ready
[1:40:10] for school and getting ready for
[1:40:11] breakfast
[1:40:12] our little extended area of the kitchen
[1:40:16] like a little Dean was where I was
[1:40:17] sitting so she come running into the
[1:40:19] kitchen and she looked right at me she
[1:40:22] turned back the end of the kitchen and
[1:40:24] she don't it just dawned on her that I
[1:40:26] was sitting her she spun back around she
[1:40:28] said daddy she run and jumped up in my
[1:40:31] lap I said did you miss me
[1:40:36] she said uh-huh I said you've been good
[1:40:40] well and daddy was gone
[1:40:41] she's like first second Greg she said
[1:40:45] uh-huh uh-huh oh ask mama that question
[1:40:49] I said I love you she said I love you
[1:40:56] too daddy
[1:40:58] but then she just laid her head on my
[1:41:00] chest
[1:41:02] neither one ever said another word
[1:41:05] because love has its own language
[1:41:10] sometimes words getting away
[1:41:15] so she's laying on my chest and all of a
[1:41:17] sudden she said daddy I can hear your
[1:41:21] heartbeat said it's going don't don't
[1:41:24] don't don't don't don't
[1:41:27] I'd often thought about that friends but
[1:41:32] sometimes the world can be a little
[1:41:33] scary but while we're in this presence
[1:41:37] like we feel right now that's just come
[1:41:40] up and daddy's lap their head against
[1:41:44] his bosom like the violinist put the
[1:41:47] volume under his chin let's just draw up
