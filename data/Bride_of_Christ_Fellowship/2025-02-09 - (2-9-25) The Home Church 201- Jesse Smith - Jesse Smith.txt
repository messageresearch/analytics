TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter six we'll start there by God's gra so I want to take one more service here and look at the home church as we looked at on Wednesday night dealing with uh the home church and things that are going on so hopefully after today we can move on to the other series or just as the Lord would lead by the grace of God uh the first part will be live I'm going to put this on a live stream because some people follow our services they don't have a home church and uh they pay ties so I want them to hear the word of God um as far as what pertains that can be said publicly and then I'll share a few things privately as as I often do by God's grace I try to give um Grace you know U and I trust to be a helped to you by the grace of the Lord so I'm just going to call this the home Church 2011 Wednesday was home Church 101 so that's like the introduction and uh 2011 would be like the Second Step by God's grace so um but again I'm going to focus kind of on the situation here um Proverbs 6:16 this was the scripture brother Dennis McBride used on his Saturday night service the spirit of a tail Bearer this was one of the scriptures so if you haven't gone listen back the uh you're probably missing out and you want to go back and listen if you haven't listened to brother Den McBride's sermons Spirit of a terar barrow and the spirit of resentment if you haven't done it uh you're you're probably uh going to miss some things things uh things that are going on because it was given to us uh a man praying and fasting and feeling LED of the Holy Ghost so uh it was given to us important sermon there to help us understand uh where we are by God's grace so Proverbs Chapter 6 16 616 so we'll read 16 down to 20 and then I want to go back to Matthew 18 let's just read that for a little review there uh by the grace of God because that's even being played out today um Proverbs 6:16 I'll read this only these six things doth the Lord hate so these are hateful things to God and if God hates it we want to hate it if God loves it we want to love it 19 is where brother Dennis was emphasizing but let's read uh or let me read yay seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and that can mean also not telling the full truth it can mean misr misrepresenting the truth telling a Hal truth it just doesn't mean well you lied and said this was green and but it was orange it can be just slightly just not telling all the all the story and hands that shed innocent blood think of the abor pors in America and heart that devises Wicked imaginations so a heart that will devise Something Wicked uh against someone else feet that are Swift in running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies so look a lying tongue and a false witness that's so anyone that would join that lying that's another thing God hates to join a lie verse 19 and he that sth Discord among the Brethren and that's the scripture brother Dennis was empathizing with the Spear of a tail Bearer so gossiping uh pitting people dividing putting people against each other how many remember that by God's grace anybody remember that praise God okay Matthew 18:15 recently I had to talk with an individual about Matthew 18 and uh that individual was just amazed that I had to carry this out and he said he said I just want to thank you for obeying the word of God so we've tried to obey the word of God when other people see you obeying the word of God if they're a real believer if they're really right with God they'll appreciate someone who can fulfill the word of God Matthew 18:15 uh I'll read um 15 16 and then um we'll read 17 together moreover If thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou Hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established let's read verse 17 on three 1 2 3 and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as Heathen man and a Publican may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I'm going to read Verse 18 verily I say you look how much God backs this up if it's done the right way truly I say unto you whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven so whatever we decide in relation to people transgressing against us if we're in the right heaven will honor what we say of course it have to because we're led by the spirit of the Holy Ghost we're led by God spirit and whatsoever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven Hallelujah verse 19 again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven Hallelujah just bear with me here uh while you're waiting let's go back to uh um Proverbs 6:16 let's go back there while I'm getting a drink here so this was our brother's text here um and I keep bringing that up that would have been August 10th because it was incredibly Supernatural and again if you haven't listened to that I would encourage you please do it if not you're probably going to miss what's going on by God's grace and that's everyone's individual Choice everyone has that choice whether to do that or not Proverbs 6:16 uh these things the Lord hate so a lying tongue so uh now let's look at that scripture in relation to Matthew 18 if someone goes to someone and they fail to repent then that person is keeping a lie they're accepting a lie right they're accepting the the lie that well I'm innocent I didn't do anything right and the Lord hates lies Hallelujah now let's just not leave it on other people if we lie let's remember God hates our lies too I'm not trying to just put it on all on one or two people or three people whatever may be four five six whatever I'm talking about this is just us recognizing uh with situations where there's transgressions against others someone's telling the truth and someone's lying or both people are lying but God has given us the spirit of Truth to discern what is truth remember the remember Jesus said the world does not receive the spirit of Truth so we can't expect people if they don't have the Holy Ghost we can't expect them to accept the truth right now we know people can you get complexes you can be bornn again you can get complexes like Peter different ones we know in the scripture could have complexes uh and maybe miss a certain truth but if I believe if each person individually will pray and seek God they'll find the spirit of Truth in every situation and especially in local church matters because we all live together we all worship together hallelujah we're all around each other we should be able to detect the spirit of Truth versus the spirit of err okay and then the the last verse verse 19 he that s a Discord among the Brethren okay so Discord is any course any division so if someone would would uh would go to someone and speak evil against someone else unjustly right and with a a gossiping Spirit that's sowing Discord and God hates that so let's remember that by God's grace here's another verse brother Dennis used uh let's since we're here Pro let's go to Proverbs 13:10 now this I'm sorry this one wasn't he used this was just from our own studies um brother Nathaniel SAS preached this really good sermon at my house a couple years ago when the pipes froze here really good verse verse 10 only by Pride cometh contention so in other words if there's contention is caused by pride and uh contention is also Discord which means it all comes from the spirit of Pride that means God hates Pride brother mam said pride is an awful Spirit to have so let's be remain humbled by the grace of God that means we can be corrected we can recognize the truth we can speak the truth to people even though it may be hard we can tell them the truth okay so the only way there'll be trouble in a church and that's why I I'm thankful these young men are here you know they're going to grow up and they're the Next Generation our young sisters here you're the Next Generation uh that's why I told my family as we talked about this situation at home I said this is for your learning this is my fifth time going through this as far as being accused and people leaving the church that's totally fine people are entitled to their own opinion but somebody's right and somebody's wrong somebody's got the Holy Ghost and somebody's got an evil spirit as well by God's grace it's just the facts and how do you know like we saw last week you take everything back to the word everything has to go back to the that's brother man said that's the only way to know right and we can do that by God's grace and Jesus said you do it one at one oneon-one and then a group against one and then the whole church against one right that's how Jesus said to do it so we follow what Jesus said Hallelujah now here's the one brother Dennis did use Proverbs 26:20 Proverbs 26:20 where no wood is the fire goeth out so there is no ter Bearer The Strife seeus seeus sorry got the hard pronunciation at the end so gossiping or ta tail bearing or sowing Discord among Brethren is liken un wood and The Strife is the fire that comes from it right so uh I was looking back at my notes so from 20 about 2019 to 2024 we had no Strife in the church I'm thankful that was a good fiveyear run there by God's grace I'll take one year of Peace by God's grace but let alone five that's God's mercy on us hallelujah I believe that think all the dancing we had the joy the worship the the healings the the testimonies by God's grace what a season of Victory praise God but then we got to come around brother said Satan won't let you stay that in other words Satan will keep going up and accusing us and God will finally say okay you can do what you want just don't touch their lives Hallelujah he said oh Aran or bride of Christ they're just serving you because you give them five years a peace well we found out now we're serving because we love Jesus whether Good Times Hard Times Discord whatever may be we're serving Jesus because we love the word hallelujah that's right so uh we can see it here it's a spirit it's a spirit of PR and it tail bearss uh it uh it attacks right it it criticizes it tears down someone's reputation brother Ram said uh he said you don't have to shoot somebody to kill them you can just ruin their reputation by speaking bad about them right that's the reality of of what Jesus Jesus said in uh Matthew Chapter 5 remember Jesus said you know uh uh he he said uh Thou shalt not murder but then he says be careful he said because you can Mur in other words he said be careful you can murder with your words right if you call somebody a fool without reason he said you might be in danger of Hellfire right so we're thankful for God's word hallelujah now I thought Also let's go to numberers 16 because this is this was brother Dennis's uh main teaching from the Bible on the Sunday service the spirit of resentment this is of course Kora Dayan and the group so brother uh Dennis is sermon said the situation he said it's preventable so in August when it was preached to us it was preventable which means we didn't have to go through these last six months the way we've gone they could have been prevented by the word of God and this was the story brother Dennis used to show it was cor and Dayan rising up saying we want more power we want more Authority but we saw on Wednesday the Elder the bishop uh the overseer the pastor he has full Authority right and then whatever he' give out that's he gives out but it's based upon the bylaws the full Authority is in the bishop we saw that on Wednesday night that's brother R said look in the Bible and see if that isn't right I'm glad we looked in the Bible Hallelujah to see it right my wife also found a good verse uh keep your spot there but I think it was Titus 2 uh said uh said that let me uh says rebuke with all authority so let me pull that up here Cas you yeah Titus 21:15 thank you okay Paul's talking to Titus Titus was also uh from history remember he was a missionary he was a pastor Mission another word for missionaries Apostle and Paul told Titus you now ordain Elders in every city so he was a preacher he was an apostle and also a pastor what does he say these things speak and exhort and rebuke rebuke people with all the authority if they're sin Hallelujah he didn't say some Authority the pastor has all the authority let no man despise thee so if you're going to despise me uh if someone's going to despise a pastor me anyone they need to leave the church right don't let don't let someone despise you in the house of God and if you remember this it's just coming to my mind now brother Dennis showed how the spirit of resentment will act in a service he used the the story of brother wey right and brother wey was leaning over and and to his wife Whispering I resent what he said and brother Bram said God struck him dead right there in the service now I'm not brother brandham but I have had people these last six months I have had people whisper to themselves uh obviously not agreeing with me and I I explained it on Sunday by God's grace all the Motions of disrespect so the Bible says we're to rebuke with all authority and let no man despise a true servant of God whether it's brother Jim Shoemake brother Brooks brother Craig Bo whoever brother brother cam brother Simon you do not let people despise a true servant of God you give them double honor right that's the word of God so uh just say just so everybody can see it there the only full Authority is the local Elder the pastor he's also called the bishop Hallelujah in the scripture Hallelujah all right now back to number 16 I just want to pull a few things out of here I read this last Sunday night after everything uh that we had to say on a Sunday night and highlighted some highlights okay now these men are named in verse one in verse two they raised up before Moses and they were famous in the congregations these were not little known congregation members these were well-known congregation members people would know men of renown and what they do in verse three they gather themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and S to you take too much upon you so they were upset saying you have too much Authority we just read the pastor has all the authority but people started complaining in the church we don't have enough Authority and it was just so it wasn't one it wasn't one person they went around telling others about that sowing Discord against Moses and Aaron and this was preached to us the spirit of resentment as a warning to us and it was acknowledged by everyone involved that this was true that this was actually happening in people's lives it was acknowledged and they said fully it was their sin and they were fully responsible that's right so it was recognized by all he said you take too much upon you seeing the congregation Are Holy every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord so so the the the uh they're accusing Moses of Aaron oh you're lifting yourself up and so what does Moses do what's the first thing he do verse four and when Moses heard it he fell on his face last Sunday after service who fell on their face interceding ask Austin if you don't know ask Austin who is weeping and crying and interceding for Mercy praying and interceding to God hallelujah God knows God fights our battles Hallelujah verse 5 and he spake unto Kora and unto the company saying even tomorrow the Lord will show now I'm going to skip down to verse 9 Moses says to verse N9 he says the core and his group Seth it but a small thing unto you that the god of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the Tabernacle of Lord and to stand before the congregation to minister to them in other words do you feel like the the role you've had was too small shouldn't you be blessed that you had the role and Authority that you were given by God rather than complain that you need more don't in other words don't you know that God says if you have a gift it'll make room for itself Hallelujah you don't got to ask for more Authority the Holy Ghost will open up more authority to you Hallelujah that's what Jesus said if you're faithful with a little I'll make you ruler over much let's uh I'm going to read that verse here the gift makes room for I've mentioned it so many times I think I might have just as well um read it yeah Proverbs 18:16 a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men so I don't make room for my gift I don't have to push my gift into anybody's church God if God wants me to be there God will open it up there since God wanted me here he sent me across the state to be away from my family just to be a part of your family all my other family lives there they all get to see each other on Christmas Easter everything I don't get to see them but I get to see you you're my family you're my new family Hallelujah that's right how many times do I try to open up my home to you why because you're my family I got a small home so can't fit everybody maybe at the same time but by God's grace you're welcome when we can do it by the grace of God so look at that a gift will make room you don't have to make room for yourself you like cor and Dayan no one has to kind of uh argue or complain or or so Discord to get more Authority God will give it to you just be faithful with the what what you have right because didn't Jesus say we all either got five talents two talents or one Talent whatever your talent is uh it'll start multiplying and then people will see it and then doors will open in other words God will open doors for you amen like I told everybody that wanted to preach everyone that want to be a song leader I just told a brother who asked me about being a preacher recently I I must been one of those Brothers at the youth meeting but I sent him a message and I said the main thing to do is wait upon your ministry just wait and let God open up the door for you you'll never have to push your way into anything and yeah yeah that's right it's a brother from South Africa right now I'm remembering now and I said brother I said if you're really called you know and you approach the pastor and say you got a gift if he won't let you preach no problem if you're called to preach you'll go preach on the corner if or you'll make a YouTube Ministry or something or you you'll do something if you're called to preach you'll do it Hallelujah right because a real child of God will not bury their gift in the ground and say well I'm not doing nothing amen that's not a real child of God that's a child of God who get spanked right like like the the parable tells us Jesus says you Wicked and lazy servant why'd you bury your gift in the earth you should have least done something with it Hallelujah a gift makes room for itself Hallelujah now back to numbers is it a small thing that they had this uh they had this ministry if I'm not mistaken the sons of Kor they would just carry the instruments they would just pack it up and carry it they were just the Moving Team I'll say this they were the U-Haul team but they're like oh no I want to be a priest I want to take the censor I want to go in with the sensor to the presence of God God said no that's not your calling was it wasn't it good enough just to be around the house of God Church the Bible said to be a better to be in the house of God and just be a doorkeeper that'd be better to be a doorkeeper than be out with the tents of the wicked some some some people listen some people in the message or some people in Christianity their whole calling is just to open and close doors and they should be happy with it am you know why cuz I was happy with it when I was a deacon in line my Vang knows I have always help open the door my wife knows I love to open the door some of you I open the door for you this morning praise God because as a deacon I had to guard the door this morning because of circumstances that's my job I signed up for it I want to do it by God's grace am Hallelujah so we do what we do but the main thing is to wait on God find something to do that you know God has called me to do this and brother they asked brother how do I know I got the gift because you can do it amen hallelujah amen we were talking about you know our sister having a gift of discernment how do we know because we see it operating hallelujah how do you know brother Jesse can preach or teach or because you see it operating praise God so the main thing we want to do is use the talents that God has given to us and then it'll make room for us we'll have a place oh that's the brother that plays piano they're in akan right that's the sister that that that prays and fasts they in akine that's a sister who brings her her children Faithfully to church in akan that's that's the brother who brings his all of his younger siblings to church Hallelujah by the grace every Sunday Hallelujah and each one of you I can preach on you in a good way right you just you you find your gift you find your calling give yourself to it fully and then God will open the doors where he wants to take you I've heard Donnie Reagan and different one Tim pu and and they just started off as small churches and God just kept multiplying them till they had to build and praise God God bless them that that proves that's their calling in life they had such growth and explosion meet people moving in from around the world to be a part of that church and so and they didn't ask for it they never asked anybody to do it well if that's true well then then then God's a god of variety well there's going to be some churches that don't get that explosion they just slowly grow or stay about the same well listen church we started with seven people right brother van three of them are here today and look look how many adults we got now by God's grace it's a great it's a great explosion to me because I know I have enough understanding by God's grace he let us know if he wants us to be big we'll be big if he wants us to be small or medium we'll be small or medium it's God's Gift God is the one in charge of the gifts God will give the increase Hallelujah all we must do is water the seed plant the seed God gives the increase Hallelujah verse 10 number 161 and he hath brought thee near to him and all thy Brethren the sons of Levi seek ye the priesthood also so he's trying to reason with him why would you demand more Authority God's already brought you close you have a much closer Ministry than other people why you trying to invade into uh getting more Authority or have your own way when God has allow or God didn't ordain you to have your own way like that in other words wasn't it good enough with what God had given you that's the word now what's interesting in verse 12 Moses called them to come up and they would they refuse to meet up they refus to come up and this was preached To Us by brother Dennis right now and look they accus accus Moses in verse 13 oh you just brought us in the wilderness to kill us they're accusing him that's not what he did but see in their minds their Discord they they worked it out well he's got bad motives and objectives for me right they they'd all like Brother D they just created this complex and Moses didn't do that and oh then they say oh well you're making yourself to be a prince Over Us in verse 13 you're exalting yourself when Moses said I didn't I didn't ask to come down to Egypt God sent me down to Egypt Hallelujah so that made uh look verse 14 moreover thou has not brought us into land in other words we haven't received all the promises you're preaching well that's because your Disobedience and your Discord and also because you got to wait on God to receive some promises some of them you got to wait a while right Moses didn't say well thus sayith the Lord in this many days this many months you'll be in the promis land no it was just a promise to get there someday but see because of the circumstances and were not there yet they just found anything to nitpick on the servant of the Lord right Moses very angry verse 15 and again you know God I'm going to skip down God tells him to separate himself verse 20 the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that I may consume them in a moment and they fell on their faces notice twice twice the Servants of God fall on their faces to pray for the guilty ones okay and said oh God the god of the spirits of All Flesh shall one man sin and thou and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation okay now verse 22 again uh I'm sorry verse 26 now I want you to see this here now for our situation I'm not calling anyone who used to come to our church Wicked that's between them and God but I'm showing a spirit that would divide a spirit of Discord is hateful in the sight of God that should be clear we just read it in Proverbs 6 and Proverbs 26 and he spake unto the congregation saying depart I pray you from the tents of these wicked men that were giving the false accusations against Moses wanting more Authority and God hadn't ordained it and touch nothing of theirs lest you be consumed in all their sins so I'm just letting you see a spirit that won't repent uh Jesus said if they won't repent you got to make them like a heathen of Republic I'm sorry not a republican well it could be a republican we got a lot of naughty Republicans a lot of naughty Democrats too brother Bram said there's six of one half a dozen of another that's right did you see this week president Trump put Paula white as his leader of uh a new department for religious liberty that was an awful shame that was a huge mistake so again like brother William and I were emailing last week this Beast out of the land has got two horns civil well now who's in charge of the Civil Republican ecclesiastical the Civil put Paula White a woman preacher who's been married three or four times the the the Civil put this woman preacher in uh in charge of uh freedom of religion and trying to spread religion and she's got a lot more awful things than that but if you ever listened to her you would know Prosperity preacher deceiver false prophet so just so you know uh we got to rightly divide the truth on everything by God's grace politics ICS everything local church everything we must rightly divide the word of God now verse 28 and Moses said hereby you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do these works for I've not done them according to my own mind and just again the point here Moses didn't call himself to go down to Egypt God called him down there any real preacher Pastor anybody they're not doing these things because they want to do them they're doing what they're doing because God's word says so right not of our own mind we're trying to keep the word of God now after the judgment is poured out on Cor and Dayan look at verse 41 but on the tomorrow all the congregation of children murmured so look it was not only was it on these famous men but then it was also on the entire congregation the Judgment didn't even cause them to repent so again Moses has left just with a critical church now thank God we don't have that by God's grace but look Moses Church no wonder sometimes he was provoked no wonder he had all these problems he's like how do I deal with this and then his father-in-law is like well get 70 elders let God will put your spirit on them that helped out then he's got still all these complaining problems people accusing him of of trying to force himself upon everybody and force all the authority and his but he's like I didn't do this to myself God called me here hallelujah okay now okay and then God sent a plague because of all the murmuring now verse 49 now they that died in the plague were 14,7 100 died because of all the complaining against Moses and Aaron okay so that's uh clear so the question is who's going to fall on their faces which side in our church or any other Church which side falls on their faces in intercession for those who won't repent that's the question that you need to answer and I need to answer praise God that's right now I want to say this too uh 1 Timothy 5:24 and 25 hun you know this is a harsh story course uh cor and Dayan and uh we would never wish any harm on anyone nor do we want any harm on anyone um and I I brought this thought out I even shared it with my daughter uh let's see it was something unrelated to what's going on in the church if I'm not mistaken no it was related okay yes that's right it was related okay um so if in the case of Matthew 18 uh if we have to keep someone out of the church or they have chosen uh to allow themselves to be terminated from the assembly that's what our bylaws say you terminate yourself from the assembly if you won't repent after the church goes to you right now after that there God May pour out a judgment or God may not because of this and brother BR gives us an example we'll go through that too in just a moment some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment so we see all their sins right beforehand going to judgment and some men they follow after okay so it's not until after they're judged we see their sin likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand sometimes we see people's good works while they're alive other people we don't some people won't see their good works until we get to the other side right now the example is um the Rich Young Ruler so let's um let's read that Luke 12 yes Luke 12 Luke 12:18 brother abam uses this I think it's in is your life worthy the gospel 63 I could be wrong on that but I think that's what it was and this shows here um well this is the uh this is the end of the man yeah this is the end of man okay I'm going to go up to verse 16 Luke 12:16 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room to bestow my fruits and he said this will I do I will pull down my Barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods now say to my soul soul thou Hast much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be Mary but God said said unto him thou fool this night thou thy Soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou Hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God so brother R says this is the Rich Young Ruler that left Jesus okay so let's go look up that one uh he looked upon him and loved him I didn't have these ready to go just a moment here I'm just looking for the the verse here thank you for your patience yeah Mark 10 thank you Mark 10:21 so uh we know the Rich Young Ruler comes he comes running to him in verse 17 kneels down what may I do that I may inherit eternal life Jesus says says uh he quotes the Commandments and then he and then in Mark 10:20 says I've observed all these from my youth talk about A good rule follower now notice he had a had a good heart to follow the rules but he still had sin in his heart it was the Love of Money verse 10 then Jesus beholding him loved him and said to him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and take up thy cross and follow me now there's a good thought in here Jesus loves him but yet Jesus's own love for him isn't enough to help him repent and follow Jesus in other words God so loved the world God has love on all these Sinners thank God God has love on us but each one must surrender to the love of God hallelujah it's not just enough that Jesus loves me yes Jesus loves me yes I know for the Bible tells me so but the question is do you love Jesus Hallelujah that's the question we know God loves us look at what's verse 22 say and he went I'm sorry and he was sad at the saying and went away grieved for he had his great possessions so brother R gives us three steps this is the first step he walks away Jesus said follow me he turns his head and said I really like my money I really want to have my way even though Jesus Loves Me I want to have my way he walks away from the five-fold ministry right just making it for our day he walks away from the calling of God and then we see at the end of his life he gets so blessed and brother B said Satan will bless you even if even if you turn away from God Satan knows how to bless you brother B said he had barns he had his his plans to build all these barns he was so fruitful he was so uh so blessed that he had so much food and materials he had to he was planning to build all these barns brother said that was the same man who left Jesus behind so we can't say just because somebody disobeys and walks away from Christ or walks away from the word that doesn't mean they're going to be punished necessarily because some men's sins go before them some men's sins fou behind them and you know Luke 16 Luke 16 is where we get the end of this story Luke 16 but manam says this is the rich man in hell he lifted up his eyes and I'm not calling I'm not judging the destination of any person I'm just showing you that the Bible says someone can disobey the Lord Jesus Christ the truth of God's word walk away and they'll still be blessed afterward we don't know what God's going to do that's why we should fall in our faces amen and pray Hallelujah Glory we don't know what God and we should plead for Mercy Luke 16 Verse 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels in Abraham's bosom the rich man also died I didn't set a timer when did I start about I'll do 30 more minutes it was uh carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeing Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazar that he may dip the tip of his finger and water and cool my tongue for I'm tormented in this flame so uh hell is a place of Torment it's a prison house and but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thyy good things and likewise Lazareth evil things but now he's comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there's a great golf fixed so that they which would pass from then to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from then then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father's house for I have five Brethren so now he's interested in evangelizing that's the wrong time to be interested in evangelizing while you're alive that's the time to try to get your family saved amen right I'm going to tell this for Chris Chris a couple years ago um when Victoria was born we were still in that we were still having service in that big room down there I just felt this burden I've got to tell my family about brother Brandon right some of you might remember I printed out this letter I gave an update on everybody in the family Malachi likes dinosaurs and Lydia likes Lon witch in the wardrobe whatever likes reading talked about and in each and and so I only sent it to my mother's side because I'm only close with them I sent it to all my aunts and uncles on my mother's side inside they had and inside the book I put I'm sorry inside the letter I put the letter I put a church age book and a book by brother brandham and links to my website uh my my YouTube Ministry we had a snow day or something like that I just took a whole day a Friday and I just packed all those up sealed them up listen to brother Brandon while I'm you know okay mailed them all out I didn't hear back from one of them but I know they opened them right because I had tracking on them and the ones that didn't they came back to me there's a couple that came back to me and I've even oh yeah I know uh yes that's right my aunt one of my aunts who now lives in Florida she was very thankful she said thank you and thank you for the book and I don't think she read it but she she expressed gratitude and God will remember that see Now's the Time to do family evangelism why you got and so now I have a now the burd's been off my heart brother the burd's off my heart I gave them a chance they could go to my YouTube they go to our home Church website if they have any questions there's my cell phone number there's a book I mean it's it's the word of God it's the message of the hour delivered to your front door hallelujah amen that's a great use of money in my opinion because you know what I may never ever see them again and I know this they'll probably never step a foot inside that door but now there's no excuses and I think yes I think I did that right after preaching on Luke 16 in Hell CU I remember I was so fired up at the next day uh brother Patrick I was like at the gas station and the guy cross me I'm like uhh do you know Jesus I don't want you to go to hell he's like I know Jesus I'm like okay praise God I was all fired up because I didn't want I didn't want to see people lost now I want to get that back by God's grace as the Lord leads so now now see see the three steps turning away from Jesus not doing his will yet you're still blessed in the Second Step but then third step lost and go to hell see that so people that disobey the word or uh reject the calling of God we'd say the five-fold ministry that doesn't always mean they're going to be punished they might be blessed all you's going to do is wait all you can do is pray for mercy on people pray for God's grace on people brother raham said if you want anyone to go to hell he said you're probably not saved he said you need to come down to this Altar and make it right with God right Moses didn't want to see that happen to Cor Dayan so what'd he do he fell on his face twice God was going to destroy all of them all two million of them first he just want to destroy the the the small families there but then he's like I'm going to destroy all of them Moses said have mercy I'm throwing myself in the Gap like Jesus threw himself in the Gap that's right that's what you and I are called to do Hallelujah everybody can see that so you want you want to be real careful we want to be I want to watch my words you want to watch your words uh just because someone's disobedient doesn't mean they're going to get punished right away we we don't know bless you we just don't know we got to be cautious by the grace of God okay let me look I'm kind of uh trying to decide where to go here yeah let's go to Ephesians 4:26 again here uh dealing with the uh we'd say anger or resentment Ephesians 4:26 because that's what ultimately resentment creates right creates anger division let's see how that's supposed to be handled verse 26 be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath so if anybody's angry with anybody before the day ends they're supposed to go to that person face to face and try to work it out right now I didn't see it but let's go to ver I didn't see it till now verse 25 let's go back up I I want to read that wherefore put away lying so put away the tail bearing Spirit right put away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another like we said last week or Wednesday why would you neglect the infection on one arm if you're the other arm you wouldn't you would take care of of that arm you take care of the people in the church right you love them you speak good of them well I guess you know we might as well back go back up to 22 put off the O off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust so see what was cor and Dayan they were lusting after more position more Authority everybody see that that that's plain we see the same thing in the New Testament deceitful love they were deceived in thinking well we get we should we should do the uh we should do the priest Ministry too they're deceived into wanting more more Authority right and be renewed so here's how you overcome that you need a new a brand new mind that's the only way to overcome this you got to repent remember that's that's three parts to repentance remember that young people there's three parts to repentance you got to change your mind right you got to hate your sin and you got to make amends for your sin look it up in the Greek sometimes look it up so see if somebody really wants a true a new mind that's what they'll do they won't think they won't allow a harboring of any evil thoughts against that brother or sister anymore they'll think different I think different I'm not going to think that I'm not going to meditate on lies I'm not going to meditate on my complex or what I want I'm going to meditate on what's true what's right what's holy what's good what's just what's lovely Hallelujah I hope you're enjoying this review by God's grace it's 2011 so 101 one was the Freshman course this is the sophomore course here by God's grace going up the levels here and then you put on the new man verse 24 which after God is created in righteousness and true so true Holiness is having a pure mind right a pure mind A Renewed mind no not going after deceitful lust and then then now verse 26 be angry and sin not you're allowed to be angry but you need to go talk to that person before the day over over so you don't go to bed angry right probably not going to get a good night of sleep probably not if you don't repent then after that or get it right probably not going to have a good week of sleep right and of course that spirit is not going to stay the same it's going to grow if you don't cut it down that's that corrupt seed is going to be watered by your thoughts by things that happen and pretty soon it's going to grow you better cut it down the day you got it be angry sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath 2 s now here it is neither give place to the devil so in other words don't give the devil place in your mind like for a complex remember a complex is a stronghold Paul calls it a stronghold it's a castle it's a fortress that Satan has set up in a Christian's mind to attack other Christians Satan has actually taken some of the ground on a believer's life right invaded and taken ground and that Christian is now attacking other Christians part of the body of Christ and you've got to tear it down we got to tear it down by the grace of God right and the Bible said it's it's not hard to do because we have weapons that are Mighty to God through the pulling down of strongholds hallelujah it's not hard for God to pull down all those bricks that the people have build up week after week month after month right it's not hard the power of God can pull it right down Hallelujah that's right okay yeah neither give place to the devil and that also applies to Matthew 18 I just thought that now you can't let the de we can't let the devil have a place in our church if a person won't repent right Paul said it's like leav you got to get the leaven out so you can become a new church a new lump you can get the joy back Hallelujah right the joy of our Salvation that's right verse 28 let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands a thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth so the whole point of you working is not necessarily for you it's to help other people too verse 29 let no corrupt communication here we go tail bearing resentment gossip let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying so build each other up make each other stronger with your words not tear people down that it may Minister Grace give people Grace with your words Hallelujah and this is to everyone in the church right me included all of us and the church said everyone in the church and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness wrath anger clamor there it is evil speaking be put away from you with all mouth and see if people won't put it away out of their lives we have to remove those people out if they won't put it out of their lives because it's only going to impact us in a negative way look at verse 32 and be ye kind to one another tenderhearted not hard-hearted tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you Hallelujah God is so quick to forgive Hallelujah and so we want to be tender-hearted forgiving one another but in the cases where people trespass in the church we want to forgive them but they've got to seek forgiveness too right Jesus said they got to admit they're wrong they got to admit their trespasses they've got to ask for forgiveness too and if they won't then the Bible said put it out put them out right put them out all right got that that that okay let's go to 1 Timothy 5 5 1 Timothy 5 I'm going to end the live stream with this and then I'm going to go into some private things I just want to say here 1 Timothy 5 and church I hope this is the last time by God's grace we've had you know we have to deal with subject subjects like this you know like I said last time was 2019 I think if my calendar and my notes are right 1 Timothy 5:19 okay now verse 19 now this applies to all of our church right because there's one person in here that's being accused that's me I've said that plainly I've said it publicly and brother said if you want trouble or he said you want you want guns to pourn at you just say you got the Holy Ghost you're going to have trouble Satan points every gun at you as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost so or you you you take any service on of God here comes the accusers you try to do anything right for God that's why brother man say sometimes don't say what you're going to do for God out loud Satan will hear it and start working against you in other words when the Bible said when you get the Holy Ghost you put on the armor of God you get into the battle so as soon as you start doing something for God it's battle time so I knew I knew becoming a pastor it'd be a battle I knew I saw brother Brook's battle I'm just glad my battles haven't been that hard by the grace of God or like I told you of the chur a church an hour and a half away where they got to call the cops and they got to get restraining orders in the message I'm not saying that to down I'm just saying that's how bad sometimes evil spirits manifest and we haven't had that thank God thank God now 1 Timothy 5:19 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses so I just want to say anyone that thinks I might be guilty you really got to consider this verse you can't receive an accusation against an elder unless there's two public Witnesses or perhaps three and brother R said in that court I read on Wednesday they've got to swear to it swear to God and they got to have full proof of it right because just at the court if somebody took you to court you'd want them to actually have evidence before they accuse you right you don't want to be taken to court with no evidence so if someone if if anyone here has accepted an accusation against me you you've done it without the proper order the proper order is there's got to be two or three Witnesses for it publicly and prove it what am I what I'm saying is that if people have accepted against me they've broken the word because they're hasn't been two or three Witnesses against me and I was open to every meeting I put in the letter for the last three weeks I've been open to every meeting no one's reach out to me for a meeting I'm open right here I I'll take any witness I I'll take see see and what happens it just it doesn't come why because God knows there's a truth there Spirit of Truth and there's a spirit of error God backs up the truth hallelujah and this is all said with the love of God in my heart see because we got to follow the word of God we got to follow the rules that the Holy Ghost has given to us in the word of God all right now uh God bless the Liv streamers we love our people that support us thank you for your support by the grace of God I trust this message was a good help
