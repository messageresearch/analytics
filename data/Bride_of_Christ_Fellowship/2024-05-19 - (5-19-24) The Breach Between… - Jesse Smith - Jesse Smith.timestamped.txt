[0:00] and I heard recognizing your day serpent
[0:02] seed and perfect Faith the breach and
[0:04] the message of Grace and Lord I Thank
[0:06] thee you know that song brother William
[0:07] do you know that song okay so uh I
[0:09] preach through recognizing your day
[0:10] serpent seed perfect faith we preached
[0:12] on Wednesday night so today I want to
[0:14] look at the breach by God's grace the
[0:15] breach between the seven Church ages and
[0:17] the Seven Seals so Revelation 5 verse
[0:27] one Hallelujah Revelation 5 vers one
[0:30] brother Brandon reads 1 through 7 uh
[0:32] when he preaches
[0:41] this so I think uh I'll read 1 through
[0:44] four and then we can all read verse five
[0:45] by God's grace verse 5 is of course
[0:48] um where John gets some encouraging
[0:50] words Hallelujah Revelation 5 verse1 and
[0:53] I saw on the right hand of him that sat
[0:55] on the throne a book written within and
[0:57] on the backside seal with Seven Seals
[1:00] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:01] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:04] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:07] and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth nor
[1:09] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:11] book neither to look thereon couldn't
[1:14] even look at the
[1:16] book and I wept much because no man was
[1:18] found worthy to open and read the book
[1:21] neither to look thereon let's read verse
[1:24] five ready 1 two three and one of the
[1:26] elders saith unto me weep not Behold The
[1:30] Lion of the tribe of Judah and the root
[1:33] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:37] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof now
[1:40] I'll just keep reading a little bit and
[1:42] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:43] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:45] midst of the elders stood a lamb as had
[1:47] been slain having seven horns and seven
[1:51] eyes brother Ram says those seven horns
[1:53] are the seven Church ages brother Ram
[1:56] said it's the church who protects the
[1:58] gospel or defends the Gospel of Jesus
[2:00] Christ as a horn is a defense for an
[2:02] animal so the seven horns are the seven
[2:05] Church ages so Church see what we are in
[2:06] the eyes of God we're a horn Hallelujah
[2:09] we've got power Hallelujah the church is
[2:12] power when God leads us to the power
[2:14] Hallelujah brother man tells us the
[2:16] seven eyes of course are the seven
[2:17] spirits uh which run upon the face of
[2:20] the whole earth he even says there are
[2:21] seven seers in one place he calls them
[2:23] those are the seven Church age
[2:24] Messengers
[2:26] Hallelujah and uh now the the scripture
[2:28] goes on to say which are the seven
[2:30] spirits of God sent forth in all the
[2:31] Earth verse 7 and he came and took the
[2:33] book out of the right hand of him that
[2:35] sat upon the throne may God add his
[2:37] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[2:38] may be seated praise
[2:41] God well by God's grace this should be a
[2:43] happy sermon today Hallelujah you know
[2:44] summer more cutting and uh you know call
[2:47] bringing us to repentance and so forth
[2:49] and you as I told you you know I I often
[2:51] preach a lot of sanctification messages
[2:53] and how many know we need him by God's
[2:55] grace how many know in this leoan church
[2:57] age you know we need sanctification of
[2:59] the Holy Spirit constantly uh by the
[3:01] grace of the Lord but this should be a
[3:02] happy joyful message you know brother
[3:05] brandom I've listen to this numerous
[3:06] times now brother brandom says this is
[3:08] the most Sublime thing in the
[3:11] scripture did you know that I just read
[3:13] you the most we read together the most
[3:15] Sublime thing in the scripture praise
[3:18] God so of course Sublime means like a
[3:20] perfect like a state of just wonderful
[3:22] uh ecstasy you know blessing Paradise
[3:25] almost this is the most beautiful
[3:28] portion of scripture brother R say
[3:30] in the whole entire Bible and that's no
[3:32] doubt why the author put that song in
[3:34] there uh the breach and the message of
[3:36] Grace Lord I Thank you that I get to
[3:38] hear your word hallelujah and I can say
[3:41] you know being raised in denomination
[3:42] that's true this is the most suim place
[3:45] Hallelujah because we didn't know
[3:46] anything about the seven seal book this
[3:48] is all connected of course to the Seven
[3:50] Seals by the grace of the Lord
[3:53] hallelujah uh now uh this is a over
[3:56] 2hour and uh 36 minute sermon from
[3:59] brother Brandon preaches this um this is
[4:02] the second sermon of that week of of of
[4:05] the Seven Seals you know in the morning
[4:07] brother R preached God hiding himself in
[4:09] Simplicity that was the morning service
[4:11] this was the Sunday evening service on
[4:13] the week of preaching the Seven Seals of
[4:14] course Monday night would have been the
[4:16] first seal there in March of
[4:19] 1963 and the word breach uh means a gap
[4:22] now of course it means numerous other
[4:24] things too like you can breach a
[4:25] contract it means to break a contract
[4:28] and just it was just a strange choice of
[4:29] words here uh maybe to our understanding
[4:32] you know because God's not breaking
[4:33] anything in Revelation 4 and 5 uh but
[4:36] brother ram calls you know Revelation 4
[4:38] and 5 the breach between the church ages
[4:40] Revelation 2 and 3 and the Seven Seals
[4:44] Revelation 6 and then Revelation 8 by
[4:46] God's grace he calls it a breach so this
[4:48] is a gap there's a gap between the
[4:50] church ages and the Seven Seals
[4:53] Hallelujah and brother baham starts I
[4:55] like to read his opening prayer as
[4:56] before he takes his text he said now
[4:58] just before we approach the book let's
[5:00] talk to him he says with our head bows
[5:02] Lord Jesus we are altogether
[5:04] insufficient I love I love the humility
[5:06] of this prayer and we should feel that
[5:08] way every service hallelujah we're
[5:10] insufficient we need God to come we
[5:13] would not try by no means to approach
[5:14] this sacred book in this most holy hour
[5:18] which Souls hang in the destination of
[5:20] time without asking Lord that the only
[5:22] one that can reveal the book that he
[5:24] came forward now blessing the feeble
[5:26] efforts of thy
[5:28] servants bless the word as it goes forth
[5:31] May It Go in the power of the spirit and
[5:33] may the spiritual ground of those who
[5:35] are hungry and thirsting to know
[5:36] righteousness and to know the will of
[5:38] God may it fall in there and bring forth
[5:41] of its kind Hallelujah Grant it Lord all
[5:44] praise shall be thine May the hungry and
[5:47] the Thirsty find food and drink tonight
[5:49] from the word we ask it in Jesus name of
[5:52] whom the Revelation is of Amen then he
[5:55] says now we're going to Revelation 5
[5:57] this is not the Seven Seals it's the
[5:59] breach between the church ages and the
[6:01] Seven Seals he says now he said now in
[6:05] in the fourth chapter of Revelation he
[6:07] said it kind of reveals something that
[6:09] would take place after the church is
[6:11] going
[6:12] up he said that the church goes up on
[6:16] the third chapter of Revelation and does
[6:18] not return unto the ninth chapter of
[6:20] Revelation therefore the church misses
[6:23] the tribulation so I'll just pause there
[6:25] for a moment you know uh brother Ram
[6:27] taught that brother Bram taught that the
[6:28] church goes up in Revelation 41 so let's
[6:31] read that now I might have a I have a
[6:34] different idea on this you know as far
[6:35] as uh certain the order of events uh
[6:39] there's numerous scriptures I've got
[6:40] videos on it uh brother Ram sometimes
[6:42] thought that the book of re Revelation
[6:44] went
[6:45] chronologically and of course I believe
[6:47] he grew in Revelation and by the end he
[6:49] knew that was not exactly right uh the
[6:51] church wouldn't go through uh or the
[6:54] sorry the Revelation doesn't go through
[6:55] chronological order uh it's easy to see
[6:58] that uh you know you can look at uh
[7:00] Revelation chap 10 right Revelation 10:7
[7:03] is brother am's Ministry how many
[7:04] believe that by God's grace he finishes
[7:07] the mystery of God well that happens
[7:09] that happens there in Revelation 10 but
[7:11] if the Rapture is revelation 4 this is
[7:13] out of order brother Williams smiled
[7:16] because he's heard the word for all
[7:17] these decades see that's why I always
[7:19] look at him for confirmation is that
[7:20] right
[7:21] brother does that sound right with
[7:24] everything you've heard all these years
[7:26] so it's something brother Ram grew in he
[7:27] got that actually from Lin I have Lin's
[7:30] book my wife got it from my birthday a
[7:31] couple years ago and I I love that book
[7:33] I love the illustrations he does brother
[7:35] brand pulled numerous thoughts from Lin
[7:37] that were very helpful for the ministry
[7:38] but in that case you know Lin had it
[7:40] wrong he said the Book of Revelation was
[7:43] chronological now what I believe is
[7:45] revelation 4 is a type of the Bride
[7:48] going up after the leodan church age
[7:51] it's a type but it's not a
[7:53] literal not literal happening because if
[7:56] you if you place Revelation if you place
[7:58] the rapture Revelation 4:1 well then
[8:01] brother bram's Ministry hasn't even
[8:02] happened
[8:03] yet okay so I hope you're listening on
[8:07] spiritual levels no wonder we sing that
[8:08] song listen closely today Hallelujah
[8:11] Revelation 4 vers1 after this I looked
[8:13] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[8:15] and the first voice which I heard was as
[8:17] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[8:20] which said come up hither and I will
[8:22] show thee things which must be
[8:25] Hereafter and immediately I was in the
[8:27] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[8:29] heaven and one sat on the throne so here
[8:32] in Revelation 4:1 John is caught up up
[8:35] to the throne of
[8:37] God and so that's why it's a type of the
[8:40] Rapture because we go from Earth
[8:42] Hallelujah to the meeting in the air and
[8:44] then from that that place we go to the
[8:46] marriage supper of the Lamb
[8:48] Hallelujah in the highest Dimension it
[8:50] have to be the seventh Dimension praise
[8:52] God so we can see how this is a type of
[8:55] the Rapture but uh I I personally you
[8:58] know growing in understanding of brother
[8:59] Ram's Ministry I I don't believe it's
[9:01] the literal Rapture of the church
[9:04] Hallelujah so uh it's a beautiful
[9:06] portion of scripture but what what what
[9:08] is true as brother Ram taught us um you
[9:11] know we there's C there's a certain
[9:13] section in the Book of Revelation where
[9:15] we don't hear anything about the
[9:17] church right and so that proves the
[9:19] church misses the
[9:20] tribulation I've had a man uh reach out
[9:23] to me these last few weeks on Tex and
[9:24] boy is he ferocious and aggressive
[9:26] trying to tell me the Rapture is uh
[9:28] after the tribulation boy he's ferocious
[9:31] but uh I said brother I said uh you know
[9:34] if you look at the tribulation text the
[9:36] there's no mention of the church right
[9:39] so I'm just flipping over here uh in
[9:41] Revelation chapter
[9:43] 7 with 144,000 where you know uh the
[9:46] 144,000 have to be H sealed by the Holy
[9:49] Ghost before the Earth gets hurt by the
[9:50] plagues and the vials and so forth
[9:53] Hallelujah and then in Revelation
[9:54] chapter 8 after the Seven Seals open in
[9:57] the reality form brother Bram tells us
[9:59] he said uh then the trumpets are blown
[10:02] the the first four trumpets are blown in
[10:04] Revelation 8 there's no mention of the
[10:06] church in Revelation 9 you have the
[10:09] fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet
[10:10] there's no mention of the church
[10:13] Hallelujah so while the most awful
[10:15] judgments are coming upon the Earth
[10:17] there's no mention of the church right
[10:19] because she's already been raptured
[10:21] Hallelujah she's been taken out of
[10:23] Harm's Way by a snatch or a catching up
[10:26] Hallelujah of the church and then we get
[10:29] get to this uh proof where there's no
[10:31] chronological order right because
[10:32] Revelation 10 we see a mighty Angel come
[10:35] down he has the open book he reveals
[10:38] this to the seven Church age messenger
[10:40] and then there's a Ministry that must go
[10:42] forth to every Kindred tongue nation and
[10:44] people hallelujah so there we see
[10:46] there's still Ministry for the seven
[10:48] Church ages or the Gentiles but then
[10:51] Revelation 11 is the ministry to the
[10:53] Jews and of course this is during the
[10:55] time of the tribulation period because
[10:57] it's three and A2 years the Bible tells
[10:59] us there in Revelation 11 and Revelation
[11:03] 12 now the Beast out of the earth uh and
[11:06] anyone who knows the message in
[11:07] Revelation 13 the Beast out of the sea
[11:10] in Revelation 13 1-10 brother random
[11:12] said is papal Rome turning into papal
[11:15] Rome from five about 500 AD so you have
[11:19] that so that's not in the right order
[11:21] right as far as
[11:22] chronological and then if you know your
[11:24] bible really well and the message
[11:26] Revelation 13 the Beast out of the earth
[11:28] is the United States
[11:30] verses 11 to 18 in Revelation 13 so that
[11:32] wouldn't be in the right order if this
[11:34] is a chronological book Hallelujah then
[11:38] chapter 14 the 144,000 get sealed so
[11:41] that ties in closely with Revelation
[11:42] chapter 7 the 144,000 being sealed and
[11:46] Revelation 15 of course is the seven
[11:49] vials these are the last plagues poured
[11:52] out upon the Earth and thank God the
[11:53] bride won't be here hallelujah God
[11:56] promised us a a a uh uh a an escape from
[12:01] the wrath of God hallelujah God promised
[12:03] us to escape the wrath of God in 1
[12:05] Thessalonians chapter 5 and then we know
[12:08] uh chapter 16 of course is the seven
[12:10] vows poured out there and then 17 of
[12:12] course is the mystery Babylon Hallelujah
[12:15] 18 is Mystery Babylon and 19 we get back
[12:18] now to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[12:21] Hallelujah so we see how it cannot be
[12:23] chronological praise God it's just it's
[12:25] it's just it's just not right but God
[12:27] gives us Grace and God gives us Mercy it
[12:29] reminds me of Joel chapter 2 I don't
[12:31] know if we read that you read that
[12:32] recently brother William but even Joel
[12:33] chapter 1 and Joel CH chapter 2 have
[12:36] events that are out of order Joel chap
[12:38] Joel chapter 1 uh talks about when Jesus
[12:40] comes back to the Jews
[12:43] 144,000 that's Joel chapter 1 and the
[12:45] beginning of Joel chapter 2 it's the
[12:46] mighty Army right uh Jesus comes down to
[12:50] Mount Zion and then Joel chapter 2 the
[12:53] beginning uh I'm sorry the Joel chapter
[12:55] 2 the middle is the day of Pentecost
[12:57] which Peter quotes
[13:00] uh I'm sorry that's the middle I'm sorry
[13:02] the end of Joel chapter 2 is the day of
[13:03] Pentecost the middle of Joel chapter 2
[13:05] brother Bram tells us is rapturing Faith
[13:08] Joel 223 to 26 I'll restore all the
[13:12] years the cankerworm has eaten
[13:13] Hallelujah so even Joel 1 and two is
[13:16] completely out of order it's just it's
[13:19] God's hiding it from the eyes of the
[13:20] wise and prudent and revealing it unto
[13:22] babe such as we learn Hallelujah so we
[13:25] can see it plainly amen I didn't wasn't
[13:27] really in my notes but I just thought
[13:28] I'd lay that in there
[13:29] by God's grace my love what brother R
[13:31] says next the church misses the
[13:32] tribulation I know that's contrary to
[13:34] pretty near every teacher I talked to
[13:37] and church that's how we are we are
[13:39] contrary to every person almost that
[13:40] goes to other churches but look at
[13:42] brother man's attitude I love this he
[13:43] says and I don't mean to be disagreeable
[13:47] Hallelujah we don't mean to be
[13:48] disagreeable on these things I mean to
[13:50] be your brother and that's what I've
[13:52] tried to be right you've tried to be
[13:54] that you've tried to be a brother or a
[13:56] sister in Christ to people that we
[13:58] differ with with he said but I must
[14:01] teach it just as I can see it if I don't
[14:05] if I can't put it together you see now
[14:07] whether the church goes up before the
[14:09] tribulation or after the tribulation I
[14:11] want to go up with it that's the main
[14:15] thing praise God so I love brother
[14:18] raam's humility here and just being a
[14:20] Christian you know I want to be a
[14:21] brother to all these churches Hallelujah
[14:23] that that differ with us but the main
[14:25] thing is I want to go up in the Rapture
[14:27] Hallelujah
[14:29] now brother B reads uh as I said
[14:32] Revelation 5 1-7 here I'm get my text in
[14:38] and then immediately after reading this
[14:40] he goes to Revelation
[14:42] 10 Hallelujah a few months ago brother I
[14:45] preach on the seven Thunders as a kind
[14:46] of review he goes right to Revelation
[14:49] chapter 10 and this is Brother Man's
[14:51] first statement he says this seven
[14:53] sealed book is revealed at the time of
[14:57] the seven thunders of Revelation 10
[14:59] 10 if you're marking it down so thank
[15:02] God we marked it down Hallelujah we took
[15:05] down his quotes we searched the
[15:07] scriptures Hallelujah and of course I
[15:09] could be wrong in this but I believe
[15:10] when brother R preached each of the
[15:12] Seven Seals that was each seal was a
[15:14] thunder each Thunder was a voice of God
[15:17] speaking to us the true revelation of
[15:19] the Seven Seals and there's my quote
[15:22] that backs me up Hallelujah that's just
[15:24] one of them I think I showed you what I
[15:27] do I think I did 13 or 14 I can't
[15:28] remember now the number it's on the
[15:29] videos I put it out
[15:31] there but brother Adam says it he says
[15:33] notice the book is revealed at the time
[15:35] of the seven Thunders if you're marking
[15:37] it down and then he reads about the
[15:40] mighty Angel Revelation 10 he said if
[15:42] you notice that's Christ he said because
[15:45] he has the same attributes as Revelation
[15:48] chapter 1 Hallelujah now if I'm going to
[15:51] get anywhere I'm I just can't go through
[15:52] I just can't hit all these things
[15:54] brother man said you could spend a uh U
[15:56] you could spend a sermon on each one of
[15:57] these thoughts so there's no way I can
[15:59] get through this whole sermon uh just
[16:02] you just can't cover it but uh I'm just
[16:04] reading these because it supports what
[16:05] I've taught I've tried to wrly divide
[16:07] the word of God all these 18 years of
[16:09] ministry by God's grace he said brother
[16:12] said it's wrote mysterious because no
[16:14] man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus
[16:16] Christ it's a mysterious book it's a
[16:19] book of
[16:20] redemption we'll get into that in a
[16:22] little while and we now we know that
[16:25] this book of redemption will not be
[16:26] thoroughly understood isn't that the
[16:28] truth my goodness people just they don't
[16:31] thoroughly understand it it's it's a
[16:32] mystery to them it's been probed at
[16:34] through six Church ages but at the end
[16:37] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[16:39] his mystery he winds up all the Loose
[16:41] Ends that these fellows probed at and
[16:44] the Mysteries come down from God as the
[16:47] word of God and reveals the entire
[16:50] revelation of God and then the godhead
[16:53] and everything else is settled all the
[16:56] Mysteries serpent seed whatever more is
[16:58] is to reveal hallelujah amen oh I'm glad
[17:01] today that the Mysteries are settled in
[17:04] our hearts Hallelujah they've been
[17:06] settled for a long time that's why I
[17:07] started the YouTube channel in 2013 you
[17:10] know 2012 was a year that um the
[17:12] accusers of brother brandom really
[17:14] stepped out publicly and made it known
[17:15] and so in that year I was so bombarded
[17:18] you know with all these accusations and
[17:21] and lies and uh uh reviling and so forth
[17:24] and slander I said I just want to make a
[17:26] YouTube channel and I want to prove to
[17:29] everybody that what we believe is the
[17:31] Bible truth I'm not believing the Bible
[17:34] said I'm not believing false uh fa fairy
[17:37] tales and things I'm not saying the
[17:38] exact King James word but we're not
[17:40] given under we're not given under fables
[17:43] we're not given under wives tales we
[17:45] we've been given thus sayith the Lord
[17:47] hallelujah we've been given the word of
[17:49] God hallelujah the uh the the the
[17:52] ministry of Paul has been restored to us
[17:55] the message of Paul has been restored to
[17:57] the church hallelujah amen
[18:00] so brother R says all these things uh
[18:02] was brought down to the seventh angel
[18:05] and brother R said now you see I'm just
[18:07] not making that up how many appreciate
[18:08] preachers that don't make things
[18:11] up brother I'm not making that up this
[18:13] is thus sayith the Lord he says I'll
[18:16] read it to you out of the book it's the
[18:18] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[18:20] the mystery of God should be finished
[18:22] that's been declared by his holy
[18:23] prophets that's the prophets who's wrote
[18:25] the word at the sounding of the seventh
[18:28] Church age at the last Church age all
[18:30] the Loose Ends that through these Church
[18:32] ages has been probed at will be wound up
[18:36] together amen hallelujah so that's what
[18:39] we see now just so you're you're aware
[18:42] in Revelation
[18:44] five the lamb comes and takes the book
[18:47] in Revelation 6 the lamb breaks the six
[18:50] of the seals Hallelujah and then in
[18:54] Revelation 8 he breaks the seventh seal
[18:56] and then in Revelation 10 an angel comes
[18:58] down and a book is open Hallelujah and
[19:03] then it says all the mysteries of God
[19:04] are finished hallelujah praise God Amen
[19:08] so we can see how this book in heaven is
[19:12] a book of
[19:13] redemption and it's got to be broken by
[19:15] the lamb and then it's got to be brought
[19:17] to Earth and then it's got to be taken
[19:18] to the entire Earth Hallelujah and think
[19:21] church that think that you are one of
[19:23] the privileged ones that gets to feed on
[19:25] the open book hallelujah oh my
[19:28] Hallelujah you could be sitting in a
[19:29] Catholic church or 7day Adventist Church
[19:31] or Christian Missionary Alliance or
[19:33] Delta assembly of or Assembly of God
[19:35] Church that's my home church house raon
[19:37] uh you could be sitting in these
[19:38] churches this morning but God allowed
[19:40] you to sit and hear the open book The
[19:42] revelation of the Seven Seals
[19:45] hallelujah
[19:50] amen now I want you to uh listen to this
[19:53] quote brother B says and when the seals
[19:55] are broke and the Mysteries revealed
[19:58] down comes the angel the messenger
[20:01] Christ that's the mighty angel in
[20:03] Revelation 10 and he sets his foot upon
[20:06] the land and upon the sea with a rainbow
[20:10] over his head a covenant now remember
[20:12] this seventh angel is on the earth at
[20:15] the time of this coming Hallelujah did
[20:17] you catch that the seventh angel so
[20:20] brother random is on the earth at the
[20:22] time of Jesus coming down as a mighty
[20:25] Angel Hallelujah all right
[20:29] so now this is why some people and I
[20:31] want to this might this might uh Lydia
[20:34] told me stor this might play into
[20:35] Lydia's story that she told me
[20:37] here this is why some uh message people
[20:41] say the raptures already happened
[20:43] because of this
[20:44] quote because the mighty Angel comes
[20:48] down okay and so so in in a lot in some
[20:51] message churches Minds The Mighty angel
[20:54] came down revealed the revelation of
[20:56] brother brandham and now the mighty
[20:57] Angel's here here and so we the raptures
[21:00] already happen is what they
[21:03] say now that's not true right what
[21:06] happened was Christ came down glory in a
[21:09] son of man Ministry Hallelujah in
[21:12] brother man's Ministry to give the sign
[21:14] of the Messiah Hallelujah to discern the
[21:17] thoughts and intents of of these
[21:18] people's hearts
[21:20] Hallelujah that and and that that's why
[21:23] all these people even the his historical
[21:25] writers of uh of the 1940s 50s 60s
[21:29] that's why all these writers about the
[21:30] dictionaries of the Pentecostal churches
[21:32] they all can point back to brother
[21:34] brandom and say it all started with him
[21:36] because he had a gift of God that it
[21:39] remains
[21:40] unmatched nobody can match the gift of
[21:43] God and that's because this this Mighty
[21:45] angel came down and visited brother
[21:47] brandom hallelujah it's it's Christ amen
[21:51] Christ came down and was in brother's
[21:53] Ministry
[21:54] hallelujah
[21:55] hallelujah but see they'll take this
[21:58] quote and they'll say see the rapture's
[22:00] already happened the Bible said that
[22:02] destroys the faith of many and it's a
[22:04] canker when you say the resurrection's
[22:06] happened already or the raptures
[22:07] happened already the Bible said it
[22:09] causes a canker it destroys people's
[22:12] Faith see because now they're not
[22:14] looking for anything now they don't live
[22:16] as close to God as if they would if they
[22:19] felt he was
[22:20] coming church I say like this he's
[22:22] coming like a thief in the night we need
[22:24] to be ready hallelujah amen every other
[22:27] generation of Christians live their
[22:28] lives like he was coming in their life
[22:31] and the Bible said don't let anybody
[22:33] deceive you telling you he already came
[22:35] already he's coming like a thief in the
[22:38] night he's coming at the right time and
[22:41] we must be faithful and as a minister I
[22:43] must give the people the meat in due
[22:45] season Hallelujah that's what Jesus
[22:47] Commissioned I must feed you the meat in
[22:49] due season now how can I feed you unless
[22:52] God's feeding me hallelujah praise God
[22:54] that's why I love feeding on the word of
[22:56] God because what God shows me it's a
[22:58] proved unto God I can give it out to you
[23:00] hallelujah amen and if you receive it
[23:02] it'll bless you like it blesses me
[23:05] Hallelujah and of course that not just
[23:07] me that's all of the fivefold ministry
[23:09] coming in
[23:10] here whatever God shows them they bring
[23:13] it to us we receive it we feed on it and
[23:15] it blesses our soul it keeps us strong
[23:18] it gives us spiritual nourishment
[23:20] Hallelujah blessed are they which hunger
[23:22] and thirst after righteousness they
[23:23] shall be
[23:24] filled but I tell you the deception of
[23:27] today is church that we got to be
[23:28] bereans and if we don't do Berean work
[23:31] we're not going to stay on fire for God
[23:34] so go to acts 1711 just to remind
[23:38] you this ties in with the King and
[23:41] Priests unto God this struck me this
[23:43] week I think I was studying yesterday it
[23:45] kind of struck me like that's right you
[23:47] have got to study the word every day
[23:50] you've got to search the scriptures
[23:51] every day that's what Jesus told the
[23:53] Pharisees he said I just read this
[23:55] morning search you the scriptures for in
[23:57] them you think you have eternal life and
[23:59] they are they which testify of me
[24:02] Hallelujah right but if we're not
[24:05] careful we just let all the preachers do
[24:07] the studying for us but that's not how
[24:09] it was in the early church the bans were
[24:12] more noble than those in thessalonica in
[24:15] that they received the word of God with
[24:16] all Readiness of mind and search the
[24:19] scriptures daily whether these things
[24:21] were
[24:22] so see every day we got to search the
[24:25] scriptures don't just take my word for
[24:28] you go find it in fact I think it's in
[24:31] the previous sermon God hiding himself
[24:33] in Simplicity where brother Ram says uh
[24:35] you go listen this and listen to this
[24:37] tape in the quietness of your own home
[24:39] and see what God will reveal to
[24:41] you he wasn't saying well I'm the only
[24:44] one that can get Revelation he said you
[24:46] go study you go have some time with God
[24:48] and God will reveal something to you
[24:50] hallelujah amen
[24:52] amen and church if we're a book of Acts
[24:55] church this is what the book of Acts
[24:56] Church did right amen they search the
[24:59] scriptures every day
[25:01] Hallelujah see it's just plain and this
[25:04] is why people get deceived and they'll
[25:06] just take quotes instead of scriptures
[25:07] and so forth you know they'll what I
[25:09] mean is they'll Mis they'll Mis construe
[25:11] quotes they'll misunderstand quotes like
[25:13] this one remember the seventh Angels on
[25:16] the earth at the time of his coming so
[25:18] somebody told Lydia recently uh Lydia
[25:22] just forgive me if I get this wrong but
[25:24] the story was was Jesus isn't coming
[25:26] Jesus is here
[25:28] that's what they told Lydia Lydia was
[25:29] talking about the
[25:31] Rapture you'd be surprised the churches
[25:33] that teach
[25:34] this I'll tell you in the privateness of
[25:36] our fellowship on Sunday nights I'll
[25:39] tell you then if you want to know just
[25:41] you can have your your W your guard up
[25:44] always have your guard up with some of
[25:45] these message people some of them not
[25:46] all of them some of
[25:48] them but that's just a misunderstanding
[25:51] so Christ came down in Revelation 10 in
[25:53] brother's Ministry helps him finish the
[25:55] mystery of God then of course Christ
[25:56] goes back up but the holy ghost is still
[25:59] here I'm not the son of man you're not
[26:02] the son of man but the comforter is here
[26:04] the Holy Ghost is here amen Jesus said
[26:07] if I go away the comforter will come
[26:09] hallelujah amen and even Jesus came to
[26:11] brother Ram in the form of the comforter
[26:13] because it wasn't jesus' physical body
[26:15] it was the Holy Spirit praise God are
[26:18] you with me that's a little deeper there
[26:19] by God's grace if you can catch that it
[26:21] wasn't the Corporal body it was the Holy
[26:23] Spirit but it was the spirit of Jesus
[26:25] Hallelujah of course which is the Holy
[26:27] Spirit
[26:29] but it was in a special way where he had
[26:31] the gift to see to see visions and to
[26:33] prophesy and to foretell things in the
[26:35] name of the Lord
[26:36] hallelujah now here's one just to help
[26:38] out Lydia maybe we can maybe I can share
[26:40] this with your friend wink wink uh the
[26:42] last sermon brother B preached was
[26:44] leadership and he said we've turned a
[26:46] corner we're looking towards
[26:49] heaven not towards a building or
[26:51] something like that watching for his
[26:54] watching for the coming the cap on the
[26:56] pyramid as we would say he's coming back
[27:00] the church M Church Must Be resurrected
[27:02] soon and we must get ready
[27:04] Hallelujah so there lyia we can say
[27:06] brother Ram also said this well brother
[27:09] R said this brother Ram also said this
[27:12] hallelujah amen so I thought that might
[27:14] be a blessing there but that this is why
[27:17] uh this is why people get confused they
[27:20] don't search the
[27:21] scriptures there still has to be a
[27:23] literal Corporal body coming of Jesus
[27:26] Christ
[27:28] Hallelujah and really church I found
[27:30] this if somebody's really got the spirit
[27:31] of Christ they're humble enough to be
[27:34] corrected if they're wrong on something
[27:36] they won't fly off the handle and be
[27:38] aggressive towards
[27:40] you if they've got the spirit of Christ
[27:42] they're willing to Humble
[27:44] themselves and repent Hallelujah that's
[27:48] right now I spent a little bit of time
[27:50] on
[27:52] that now the next section brother BR
[27:54] after laboring there in Revelation 10 he
[27:57] goes to the idea of the book of
[27:59] redemption through a kinsman
[28:02] redeemer Hallelujah now we can see it's
[28:05] a book of redemption Casa would you pull
[28:06] up uh Revelation 59 Revelation 59 and
[28:10] they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[28:12] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[28:15] seals thereof for thou was slain and
[28:19] Hast what redeemed everybody say
[28:22] redeemed redeem that means to purchase
[28:25] and buy back as your own that's what
[28:27] Redemption means
[28:29] Hallelujah I purchased it and bought it
[28:32] back I think I read it a few months ago
[28:34] when I was preaching on the book of
[28:35] Romans redeemed it means to take out of
[28:37] the pawn shop or the slave market in
[28:41] would in those days it would have been a
[28:41] slave
[28:43] market to buy out of the slave market so
[28:46] if someone bought a slave which would be
[28:47] awful Wicked it's a wicked thing God in
[28:50] the Old Testament God said it was worthy
[28:51] of
[28:53] death but if someone like in the case of
[28:55] Hosea amen with his wife Hallelujah
[28:57] which represented Israel and God Amen
[29:00] God by God bought Israel back with the
[29:02] blood of Jesus Christ
[29:04] Hallelujah he redeemed her she was lost
[29:09] but she became his possession by a
[29:13] purchase he purchased her back and he
[29:16] could say I paid the price She's Mine
[29:20] Hallelujah she's redeemed amen the price
[29:23] has been paid amen she doesn't belong to
[29:25] anybody else She's Mine Hallelujah amen
[29:29] and that's what Christ did to us that's
[29:31] what Christ did to you Hallelujah you're
[29:34] his you're purchased you're bought
[29:37] nobody can take you out of his hands
[29:38] amen the price has already been paid
[29:41] you've already we've got God's receipt
[29:43] it's the resurrection hallelujah amen I
[29:46] feel like it's Easter time amen we've
[29:48] already got God's receipt it's the
[29:50] resurrection that Jesus Christ is alive
[29:53] and his spirit is here today in the
[29:55] church hallelujah amen
[29:59] it's a book of
[30:00] redemption this book that no man could
[30:03] even look at think about that couldn't
[30:04] even look at
[30:06] it what's so important to you that you
[30:08] wouldn't even let somebody look at it
[30:09] unless they had they were in the right
[30:11] conditions and God's like no one's even
[30:14] looking at this book except one only one
[30:17] can look at this
[30:18] book maybe I'll preach on Wednesday but
[30:20] brother said all the celebrity in heaven
[30:23] was there brother
[30:25] amen which is this is interesting
[30:27] thought but he said Elijah was standing
[30:29] there brother man said Moses was
[30:31] standing there all the celebrities in
[30:33] heaven were standing there and God said
[30:36] nobody can even look at
[30:38] it and that's why John wept brother R
[30:41] said John didn't just weep because he
[30:43] was unworthy brother said he he wept for
[30:45] more than that he wept because the whole
[30:47] creation was lost unless somebody was
[30:50] worthy to come and take this book of
[30:52] redemption
[30:54] Hallelujah in other words we'd be slave
[30:57] M we'd be slave to sin we'd have no hope
[31:00] we'd still be in the slave market if
[31:02] somebody doesn't come and take this book
[31:04] Hallelujah we'd have no future we be
[31:07] lost and go to hell unless somebody
[31:09] comes and prevails and takes the book of
[31:12] God
[31:13] hallelujah oh
[31:16] my and we're redeemed we're purchased
[31:18] what out of every
[31:20] blood so I don't care what blood you are
[31:22] I don't care what nation you come from
[31:24] Jesus purchased all of them Hallelujah
[31:29] heyen every Kindred tongue people and
[31:33] Nation
[31:35] Hallelujah every I love that word every
[31:38] every single one he paid the price for
[31:40] All Nations
[31:42] Hallelujah so the gospel is for every
[31:45] nation it's for every person
[31:48] Hallelujah the Bible also said in
[31:50] Galatians 3:13 Christ has redeemed us
[31:53] from the curse of the law so just some
[31:54] more verses about being redeemed
[31:58] we're redeemed from the curse of Law and
[32:00] now there's a book of
[32:03] redemption that's so
[32:05] important uh it was so important to John
[32:07] it was so important to all of
[32:10] us uh God of course also foretold the
[32:13] Redemption of Israel in Psalm
[32:16] 13624 and has redeemed us from our
[32:19] enemies for his mercy endureth forever
[32:21] and of course that was natural
[32:22] Redemption right as as Moses and David
[32:26] and different ones down through the the
[32:27] oldest they would have physical battles
[32:29] of natural Wars and they would rejoice
[32:31] and say God redeemed us right God
[32:34] delivered us God brought us out of Egypt
[32:36] God brought us out of bondage amen God
[32:38] brought us out of spiritual Egypt
[32:40] Hallelujah we've been baptized under
[32:42] Moses amen we've been baptized under
[32:44] Paul's gospel Hallelujah in our
[32:46] spiritual way Hallelujah and so we can
[32:49] see all throughout the Bible it's a book
[32:51] of
[32:52] redemption Nehemiah even said in in
[32:54] Nehemiah 5:8 and I said unto them we we
[32:58] after our ability have redeemed our
[33:00] Brethren the Jews which were sold unto
[33:02] the Heathen and will ye even sell your
[33:04] brethren or shall they be sold unto us
[33:06] then they held their peace and found
[33:08] nothing to answer so God had a way for
[33:11] even Israelites to
[33:13] redeem one another right if a brother
[33:17] man would say if a family got in in bad
[33:19] times and they made some bad Investments
[33:21] or there was a famine the family might
[33:22] have to sell themselves to be slaves or
[33:24] I'm sorry not slaves indentured servants
[33:27] they might have to sell themselves but
[33:29] then every seven years there' be a a
[33:32] there' be the seven-year
[33:33] release and then every 50 years it was a
[33:36] year Jubilee all properties go back to
[33:39] the original owners praise God God
[33:42] always had a way of redemption
[33:43] Hallelujah if something been lost God
[33:46] always had a way to get it back amen
[33:48] didn't cam preach on that
[33:49] Hallelujah the law of restoration last
[33:52] time that's right it's a law God always
[33:56] has a way to bring back back what's been
[33:58] taken
[34:02] Hallelujah now brother raham goes in
[34:04] this deep and long he spends most of his
[34:06] time on this idea of the kinsman
[34:09] redeemer I'm just going to read this is
[34:11] Brother R's uh summary of all these
[34:13] Bible verses I'm going to read in just a
[34:15] moment get ready okaya he said now the
[34:19] forfeited title deed is now in the hands
[34:21] of the original owner almighty God
[34:24] that's quite a statement so this book
[34:26] there Revelation five was a title deed
[34:30] right a title deed is you own something
[34:31] right we have we have the title to our
[34:33] cars thank God we finally got the title
[34:35] to our cars H only takes how long you
[34:39] know if you buy a used one you can have
[34:41] it right
[34:42] away he said the title deed is to the
[34:46] Earth and eternal life when Adam
[34:48] forfeited
[34:51] it so what was that brother Jesse that
[34:53] was Genesis 1:26 and 28 God gave
[34:56] Dominion to Adam and
[34:58] Eve that means they had control they had
[35:00] rule over the Earth and they had eternal
[35:03] life
[35:05] amen they had the title deed they had
[35:08] ownership over the Earth but we we know
[35:11] what happened Adam and Eve sinned and
[35:14] the Bible said pull up second Peter 2:19
[35:16] this is a very familiar verse uh well I
[35:18] should say very familiar but it's very
[35:19] helpful for this this
[35:21] teaching Adam had eternal
[35:23] life okay for of whom a man is overcome
[35:27] of the same as he brought into
[35:29] bondage Adam purposely sinned Eve was
[35:32] deceived into it but Adam purposely
[35:34] plunged the whole human race into sin
[35:38] and because he was overcome before he
[35:40] because he purposely gave into sin now
[35:43] the whole humanity is under the
[35:45] corruption of sin we're under the
[35:47] bondage to
[35:49] sin Church you know that if you can make
[35:51] it through a whole day without sinning
[35:52] it's about time to shout and praise God
[35:53] and have Revival Hallelujah of course
[35:56] you'd be having Revival if you didn't
[35:57] sin all day
[35:58] you know you made it through a day
[36:00] there's not many mind battles you like
[36:01] Hallelujah I'm walking on clouds amen
[36:04] amen or I'm really sitting Heavenly
[36:05] places Hallelujah because we because we
[36:08] know what it's like almost every day
[36:10] we're under
[36:11] bondage how can I get out of this where
[36:13] when can this end why does it have to be
[36:15] like this I don't lie I don't want any
[36:17] of this but yet it happens right Adam
[36:20] sold us under that but at first Adam had
[36:23] dominion and he had eternal life in
[36:26] other words he had the he had the rights
[36:28] to the Earth he had control of the Earth
[36:30] with eternal life but then he sold it
[36:33] out and brother R said then that book
[36:35] that title deed to the Earth and
[36:37] Dominion went back to
[36:39] God but then some of you know God let
[36:41] Satan become God of this world 2
[36:44] Corinthians
[36:45] 4:4 let's read that by God's grace and
[36:49] that just means a judge or ruler doesn't
[36:50] mean Satan's a God right there's only
[36:53] one God God we need to read Isaiah
[36:55] sometime and God says I don't see any
[36:57] other God beside me I'm the only
[36:59] one I made Heaven and Earth I was before
[37:02] the earth I was before all things I
[37:04] order the number of days I I'm Ancient
[37:05] of Days hallelujah praise God there's no
[37:08] one beside me if there is I don't know
[37:09] them Hallelujah he's being factious in
[37:13] whom the God of this world hath blinded
[37:14] the minds of them which believe not so
[37:17] when Adam lost his Dominion Satan took
[37:20] part of that Dominion right because he's
[37:22] got he's got influence now over them
[37:24] with sin he can tempt them and deceive
[37:27] them into sin so he's like a a ruler
[37:30] over the sin nature oh but we but he
[37:35] don't have to rule over us hallelujah
[37:37] because God gave us a different nature
[37:39] there it is amen the baptism of the Holy
[37:41] Ghost amen and that could only happen
[37:44] because Jesus was a new creation
[37:46] hallelujah amen he came a new creation
[37:50] and he lived such a life that when he
[37:52] died he raised and then he sent his life
[37:55] back upon the church amen he sent his
[37:58] Spirit deeper into the church not just
[38:00] the flesh not just the mind but into
[38:02] their very Soul
[38:08] Hallelujah so we can see this now
[38:11] brother Ram said but the whole title
[38:13] deed of it the ownership of it didn't go
[38:15] to Satan the ownership went back to God
[38:19] the book I don't know if there's a book
[38:21] on the earth or not I'm sure preachers
[38:22] have dramatized it and it'd be okay
[38:24] drama you know that'd be a fine drama to
[38:26] me it wouldn't father
[38:28] me because Adam did have dominion we can
[38:30] see it by the scripture but brother
[38:32] maram said when uh when God created
[38:35] Jesus the body to dwell in he was the
[38:37] fullness of the godhead bodily that's
[38:40] right Hallelujah and brother Adam said
[38:43] he was a son back in his rightful
[38:45] position like Adam was that's why when
[38:48] the storms come up Jesus could just talk
[38:50] to the storms amen hallelujah peace be
[38:54] still Hallelujah brother said that's
[38:56] what Adam and Eve originally
[38:59] had but Jesus now that he comes not now
[39:01] that he comes on the scene he has the
[39:04] authority and I just read this morning
[39:06] Jesus said I only do what the father
[39:08] shows me oh church if we could just do
[39:10] that amen if we could learn to do that
[39:13] just do what God tells us to do not what
[39:15] we want to do he says as I see I do it
[39:18] as I hear I judge as I hear I
[39:22] teach so in other words Jesus only
[39:24] relied on the father for every action
[39:27] that he ever did God help us to do that
[39:29] hallelujah oh so true so
[39:34] beautiful Hallelujah but there was a few
[39:37] things even though he was a full Son of
[39:38] God we'd say there's a few things he
[39:41] still had to conquer he had to possess
[39:44] every gate amen he had to possess every
[39:47] one of the enemy's Gates he had to
[39:50] possess
[39:51] Temptation he had to uh possess sickness
[39:54] and disease hallelujah praise God Amen
[39:56] depression
[39:58] he battled depression in the Garden of
[39:59] Eden he had to possess the Gate of anger
[40:02] sinful anger by not sinning when he was
[40:05] angry Hallelujah and brother R said he
[40:08] possessed every gate he conquered the
[40:10] sin of anger he conquered the sin of
[40:13] Temptation he conquered every single
[40:15] gate Hallelujah and the last gate
[40:17] brother amen he had to C conquer was
[40:19] death hallelujah oh but he went down to
[40:22] Hell and he conquered and took the keys
[40:24] of death and hell and then he said I
[40:26] live and I'm I'm alive forever more
[40:29] Hallelujah now I've got the keys of
[40:31] death hallelujah amen so straight Satan
[40:35] is stripped of his keys right you've
[40:37] heard preachers say it you know it's
[40:38] true Satan don't even have the keys of
[40:39] his own house he's the house of Hell
[40:42] he's the house of death and he don't
[40:43] have the keys Jesus has the keys
[40:47] Hallelujah he's he's got Dominion praise
[40:49] God he's a he's the true Son of God
[40:53] hallelujah the only begotten son of the
[40:55] Son of God hallelujah oh my so we can
[40:59] see what brother manam is trying to
[41:01] bring it to us he said when Adam
[41:04] forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands
[41:06] could not take it so it went back to the
[41:08] original owner God himself that dominion
[41:10] and eternal life couldn't go to Satan
[41:12] because he'd already sinned he can't
[41:13] have eternal life it's got to go back to
[41:15] God who gave it that's what that book
[41:18] represents eternal life and Dominion
[41:20] hallelujah praise God the full rights as
[41:23] a son or daughter of God Amen it's a
[41:26] book of brother Ram tells us amen all
[41:29] your rights are in that book
[41:31] hallelujah amen he says now there he
[41:34] sits on the
[41:35] throne with the book in his hand the
[41:38] title deed brother claps his hands twice
[41:41] oh that makes me feel religious the
[41:43] title deed to eternal life the abstract
[41:45] title deed to eternal life when Adam
[41:47] forfeited it for wisdom not not God's
[41:49] wisdom but sinful wisdom instead of
[41:52] faith it went back to the hands of the
[41:54] owner almighty God what a great thing he
[41:58] says he says what is it doing it's in
[42:00] the hands of God waiting for
[42:02] redemption's
[42:04] claims to claim Redemption he said he
[42:07] made a way of redemption he made a way
[42:09] back and someday the Redeemer is to take
[42:11] it back you see what we're getting at
[42:13] now we watch this fellow sitting upon
[42:15] the throne of course that's Jesus right
[42:17] all right waiting for redemptions claims
[42:20] its Redemption he says what is this book
[42:23] of redemption it's a title deed it's an
[42:25] abstract title deed what does abstract
[42:28] mean it means it searchs all the way
[42:30] back to its
[42:31] beginning Hallelujah so this book
[42:34] Hallelujah in heaven it has all the
[42:37] truths all the way back to the beginning
[42:39] amen amen that's right Hallelujah so it
[42:42] has all the rights that God gave to Adam
[42:44] and Eve at the beginning plus eternal
[42:46] life hallelujah it's got all that it
[42:49] goes all the way back to the beginning
[42:51] the position and the power of a son or
[42:54] daughter of God hallelujah oh my
[42:58] brother it's like that little drop of
[43:00] ink we preached this morning when the
[43:01] ink strikes the bleach it search all the
[43:04] way back to its original condition right
[43:06] goes back to its original uh molecules
[43:08] right he says and When sin has been
[43:11] confessed and fallen into the blood of
[43:14] Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract
[43:17] right straight back to the crater again
[43:19] you become a son or daughter of
[43:22] God he said an abstract title deed is
[43:25] held in the hands of all almighty God oh
[43:29] it's
[43:30] beautiful he said it's Redemption means
[43:32] all legal
[43:34] possession that was lost by Adam and Eve
[43:37] oh my we ought to do that he said what
[43:40] ought it do to a born again
[43:43] Christian so if Redemption brings back
[43:45] all the rights right what should it do
[43:48] to a born- again
[43:49] Christian
[43:51] Hallelujah it should make us enjoy and
[43:54] recognize the rights God has given to us
[43:56] like brother said it should make us live
[43:58] to our
[43:59] privileges how many enjoying those
[44:01] privileges Hallelujah I haven't got all
[44:03] of them brother Austin but I got a lot
[44:04] of privileges Hallelujah I've been
[44:05] enjoying them the last 20 some years by
[44:08] God's grace last 23 years amen I've
[44:11] enjoying the Privileges of being a Son
[44:13] of God a child of God hallelujah but I
[44:17] know there's more privileges for me
[44:19] hallelujah amen amen oh it's beautiful
[44:22] all that was
[44:23] lost he said it's a legal possession to
[44:26] that abstract deed title deed of eternal
[44:28] life that means you can possess
[44:30] everything that Adam and Eve lost of
[44:32] course but we have to balance that
[44:33] according to the will of God whatever
[44:35] God has for your life because remember 1
[44:38] Corinthians 12 do all are all Apostles
[44:40] are you sisters going to say well I got
[44:41] all the rights I can be an apostle now
[44:43] you just broke the you just broke the
[44:45] title deed Hallelujah right or brothers
[44:49] say well I'm going to be a prophet I
[44:51] know I can be a prophet and you weren't
[44:52] even called to be a prophet you don't
[44:53] dream dreams you don't see
[44:55] Visions uh sorry you just just broke the
[44:57] title deed you don't have those rights
[44:59] so we got to understand with that
[45:02] understanding all the rights that God
[45:04] has for my life God wants me to possess
[45:07] amen he's going to bring me back to them
[45:09] Hallelujah that's what this book
[45:11] represents the title deed the eternal
[45:13] life uh Hallelujah it represents the
[45:16] Dominion that Christians have and it
[45:18] represents that Jesus is giving us a
[45:20] portion of that
[45:21] now he gives us a portion but remember
[45:24] we don't get the fullness of the
[45:25] adoption until we get a body change
[45:28] hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah
[45:31] the body change amen that's when we get
[45:33] the fullness of this purchase possession
[45:36] Hallelujah
[45:37] am that's right no I'm really loud today
[45:40] I don't know why I'm so loud I guess I'm
[45:41] just stirred up by God's
[45:43] grace he said it's a legal possession
[45:46] it's the Eternal I'm sorry the title
[45:48] deed of eternal life it means you
[45:50] possess everything Adam and Eve lost
[45:52] sorry I'm reading that again what is it
[45:53] brother the possession of that deed that
[45:56] right
[45:57] or that
[45:58] decree
[46:00] sorry Adam could not meet the
[46:03] requirements of the
[46:05] Redemption after he found he lost it
[46:07] he'd sinned and he separated himself
[46:09] from God was on that side of the chasm
[46:11] so he could not redeem it he just
[46:14] couldn't do it because he needed
[46:16] Redemption himself so he could not do
[46:18] it so when a man falls to uh into
[46:22] bondage he can't redeem himself Glory
[46:27] think about your life you might have
[46:28] been in some addiction you might have
[46:30] been in some slavery to sin and you
[46:32] couldn't redeem yourself somebody had to
[46:34] redeem you hallelujah oh thank you Jesus
[46:36] amen for redeeming me Hallelujah and
[46:40] yeah I use brother Simon to do some of
[46:41] it too Hallelujah right Simon brought me
[46:43] the message Hallelujah but it was all
[46:46] Jesus amen Jesus sent Simon Hallelujah
[46:49] Jesus sent Cam and all the different
[46:51] ones that God placed in my life God sent
[46:52] different ones in your life
[46:54] Hallelujah but it was all Jesus
[46:56] Hallelujah bringing you back redeeming
[46:58] you back from what you lost hallelujah
[47:01] what Adam had lost and what you didn't
[47:02] even most of us didn't even realize he
[47:04] had those rights Hallelujah my goodness
[47:07] he said he Adam couldn't do it he needed
[47:08] someone to redeem
[47:10] himself he said but the law required a
[47:13] kinsman
[47:15] redeemer he said you want to mark that
[47:17] down he said
[47:20] Leviticus now other where's my
[47:22] scriptures
[47:25] here yes is Leviticus 25 we're not going
[47:28] to read all those but brother BR
[47:29] mentions it Leviticus 25 because I want
[47:31] to at least get to a certain spot before
[47:32] we have to close here by God's grace
[47:36] Hallelujah brother B says we won't have
[47:38] time to thoroughly search this because
[47:39] you know each text would take a night
[47:41] see now I love what he says next let's
[47:43] get in this kinsman redeemer and we'll
[47:45] finish with this thought by God's
[47:46] grace next few minutes here he says but
[47:50] God's law received a substitute for The
[47:54] Sinner now what if God had not offered
[47:56] to take a
[47:57] substitute think about that what if God
[47:59] didn't accept substitute how could you
[48:01] ever have you ever had a maybe two days
[48:03] in a row where you felt like you could
[48:04] have earned God's love you would have
[48:06] failed you you you just would have
[48:09] failed
[48:11] right so brother R says there's no way
[48:14] back there was no way for him to get
[48:17] back he was gone he said but love
[48:21] constrained God to make a way back amen
[48:26] humans couldn't bring themselves back
[48:28] they couldn't muster up enough strength
[48:30] or courage or discipline to obey all the
[48:33] word of God and earn it back so God in
[48:36] His Grace law I love this God's a god of
[48:39] contrast God has law but he also has
[48:42] Grace amen he's got male and female
[48:45] heaven and earth right complete balance
[48:46] in the universe right
[48:48] Maly right he's got all these night and
[48:51] day he's got male and female he's got
[48:52] all these great balances amen so many
[48:55] times we just see law but that's true
[48:57] God has love but God also has
[49:00] Grace amen yes God has judgment but he
[49:03] also has Mercy amen and brother said I'm
[49:06] not hoping in the Judgment of God I'm
[49:08] trusting in the mercy of God Amen
[49:12] Hallelujah because that law and that
[49:14] judgment would judge me every time I'd
[49:16] have no hope I couldn't be brought back
[49:18] I needed God to have another way to
[49:20] bring me back to him Hallelujah hey
[49:23] thank God he did Hallelujah
[49:29] what if God didn't have a substitute but
[49:31] love constrained him to do
[49:33] that but the grace of God met this
[49:36] kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus
[49:39] Christ law required it Grace met its
[49:44] requirements amen amen hallelujah in
[49:47] other words the law was demanding
[49:48] brother amen your soul is is uh you need
[49:51] to pay for the sins of of your soul
[49:54] right the law required it and a Amen to
[49:57] me we're like well we can't pay it we
[49:59] don't have any
[50:00] money I really don't have any money
[50:03] Hallelujah he's like I can't pay it but
[50:06] God had another way well there's another
[50:07] way somebody else can pay it for brother
[50:10] amen hallelujah oh I like that amen
[50:13] somebody who's got the money amen
[50:15] someone who's got the ability hallelujah
[50:18] hallelujah and then Jesus Christ comes
[50:20] himself as the Lamb of God
[50:23] Amen God had another way I know we
[50:26] couldn't for it we couldn't do it so God
[50:28] has a substitute and brings him in and
[50:30] Jesus drops the charges because he paid
[50:33] the charges amen he's both judge jury
[50:36] and attorney
[50:38] Hallelujah
[50:39] ah it's his legal system
[50:42] Hallelujah he's the one that set up
[50:44] kinsman
[50:45] redeemer he's the one that set up that
[50:47] somebody can bring you back amen you've
[50:50] been lost or you've gone astray but I've
[50:52] got a way to bring you back into the
[50:54] fold
[50:55] Hallelujah it's impossible for you to do
[50:57] it but I'll make a way where you can
[50:59] come back by a substitute
[51:03] Hallelujah Grace met the requirements of
[51:06] the law
[51:10] amen like that's why I like that song
[51:12] back to life because it's that second
[51:14] verse I just I shared it with you you
[51:15] know a few months ago when something
[51:17] says I'm not worthy I point to the price
[51:19] he
[51:20] paid what's the other line when
[51:22] something says I'm guilty I point to
[51:24] that empty grave oh
[51:27] Hallelujah that's my worthiness my
[51:29] worthiness is that somebody got me
[51:32] out I don't have any
[51:34] worthiness somebody stepped in and made
[51:36] a substitute and paid my fine Hallelujah
[51:40] that's my merits I have no merits the
[51:42] merits is that somebody paid my merits
[51:45] Hallelujah it wasn't
[51:47] me that's what I boasted that's what

[51:51] boast in the cross of Jesus Christ my

[56:23] want you to say that out loud say I'm
[56:24] not my own ready I'm not my own
[56:26] that means you belong to somebody oh if
[56:28] there's somebody I belong to God let it
[56:30] be Jesus amen hallelujah let it be Jesus
[56:33] amen amen hallelujah I don't want to
[56:35] belong to Satan I don't want to belong
[56:36] to anybody else and these uh politicians
[56:38] down here I don't want to belong to them
[56:40] I want to belong to one person the Son
[56:42] of God hallelujah that's who I want to
[56:45] belong to and the Bible said we do not
[56:47] belong to anyone else we belong to
[56:50] Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'm not my own I
[56:55] belong to Christ
[56:58] now what we heard it recently uh did we
[57:01] hear that where was that we heard that
[57:03] oh that that I it might have been at
[57:05] bible Club but we sing that song I Am My
[57:08] beloveds and he is mine His Banner Over
[57:11] Me Is Love but in the real reality of it
[57:15] church we are really his property praise
[57:18] God because you didn't pay a price to
[57:20] buy Jesus right Jesus Paid the price of
[57:23] his blood Hallelujah he shed his blood
[57:26] to purchase you and I and so we are
[57:28] bought with the price verse 20 you're
[57:32] bought with the price therefore glorify
[57:34] God in your body and your spirit which
[57:37] are Gods notice it didn't say soul
[57:40] because if you're born again you already
[57:41] glorified God in your soul because your
[57:44] soul is filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[57:47] hallelujah so that means the battle to
[57:50] glorified God is going to be in our body
[57:52] and in our minds our
[57:54] spirit that's where we got to say every
[57:55] day Lord help this day was it May 19th
[57:58] help this day to glorify you Jesus help
[58:01] me to remember today that you bought me
[58:04] I belong to you and today I'm going to
[58:06] glorify you today in my thoughts in my
[58:09] body thank God you're in my soul
[58:11] hallelujah praise God
[58:15] hallelujah you are not your own you have
[58:19] been bought with the price you've been
[58:20] bought by kinsman redeemer church amen
[58:24] hallelujah it's a beautiful example
[58:26] now I want to read uh what E's Bible
[58:29] dictionary says about the kinsman
[58:32] redeemer it means to
[58:34] redeem the kinsman redeemer was the
[58:37] nearest male blood relation
[58:41] alive okay so in the case of Ruth as
[58:45] we'll look at here her husband
[58:47] died so there was a nearer blood
[58:51] relation than even Boaz Boaz wasn't the
[58:53] nearest
[58:54] one there was another so her husband
[58:57] Rose uh husband who passed away must had
[58:59] a brother or some type of a relation
[59:02] that was nearer than
[59:04] Boaz
[59:06] right says certain important obligations
[59:10] devolved upon Him toward his next of
[59:13] kin so if you were a man and you had
[59:17] Brothers you know uh and sisters and so
[59:20] forth and they got in difficult
[59:21] situations if you were the closest one
[59:23] to them you could buy them out as long
[59:25] as you had the
[59:27] finances thank God Jesus had the
[59:29] finances Hallelujah he had the all the
[59:32] riches of Heaven amen he created the
[59:35] heavens and the Earth amen thank
[59:38] God
[59:41] by and it says if anyone from poverty
[59:44] was unable to redeem his inheritance it
[59:47] was the duty of the Kinsman to redeem it
[59:49] for him that's Leviticus put up oh she
[59:51] left okay that's
[59:54] fine Leviticus 25 25 we'll just read
[59:57] that one and 28 Leviticus 2025 Leviticus
[1:00:05] 2528 If thy brother be wax and poor and
[1:00:08] has sold away some of his possession and
[1:00:10] if any of his kin come to redeem it then
[1:00:12] shall he redeem that which his brother
[1:00:14] sold let's say he sold away today his
[1:00:17] car something well the nearest kin to
[1:00:20] you could come and buy it back I'll buy
[1:00:23] that back I'll redeem that back I'll pay
[1:00:26] the price for him since he can't afford
[1:00:27] it I'll pay it to bring it back now
[1:00:30] church this this is to magnify Jesus
[1:00:31] here now have to think about who can get
[1:00:33] me a whatever you
[1:00:35] know how can I get back that chair that
[1:00:38] I wanted I got to get back that couch
[1:00:41] that's not what we're talking about here
[1:00:42] we're talking about salvation
[1:00:45] Hallelujah Now read 28
[1:00:49] 2528 but if he be not able to restore it
[1:00:52] to him then that which is sold shall
[1:00:54] remain in the hand of him that hath
[1:00:55] bought it under the year of Jubilee
[1:00:56] until the year Jubilee so that wait 50
[1:00:57] years for this one and in the Jubilee it
[1:01:00] shall go out and he shall return unto
[1:01:01] his possession so he has to wait a long
[1:01:04] time but you're going to get it back
[1:01:05] eventually by God's grace hallelujah
[1:01:07] thank God thank God we'll get everything
[1:01:09] back eventually amen
[1:01:13] hallelujah I better not go there because
[1:01:16] that a little thought I don't want to go
[1:01:18] there also the Kinsman was required to
[1:01:21] redeem his relation Who Sold himself
[1:01:23] into slavery 254 48 Lydia
[1:01:28] 2548 and 49 28 25
[1:01:31] 4849 Glory so Church search can we see
[1:01:34] this is what Christ did for us Christ
[1:01:37] saw us we lost our possession we lost
[1:01:40] our rights right we lost our land we
[1:01:43] lost who we
[1:01:45] are but he said I can pay for it I can
[1:01:48] bring it back to them amen hallelujah
[1:01:51] that means God always knew I was going
[1:01:53] to be a pastor right and that's la land
[1:01:55] that I had lost long lost Hallelujah but
[1:01:59] God paid the price to bring me back to
[1:02:01] my possession and he brought me a gave
[1:02:03] me a wife my wife my family everything
[1:02:06] everything spiritual in my life God saw
[1:02:08] that and Jesus said I'm going to buy it
[1:02:10] back for him oh hallelujah amen it
[1:02:12] wasn't I I didn't do it it was God doing
[1:02:15] this Hallelujah each one of our lives
[1:02:17] whatever God's called us to be in in in
[1:02:20] in our in our our individual lives God
[1:02:22] has ordained that and he gives it back
[1:02:24] to us hallelujah
[1:02:26] Satan tries to steal those dreams away
[1:02:28] those hopes away but I'll tell you if
[1:02:29] that's a Bible dream if that's a
[1:02:31] promised dream of God you're going to
[1:02:33] get restored hallelujah amen oh
[1:02:37] my what it say 48 49 yes and after that
[1:02:40] he sold he may be redeemed again one of
[1:02:42] his Brethren May redeem him verse 49
[1:02:45] either his uncle or his Uncle son may
[1:02:47] redeem him or any that is nigh of kin
[1:02:49] unto him of his family may redeem him or
[1:02:51] if he be able he may redeem himself of
[1:02:55] course we know that's impossible for us
[1:02:56] I don't what's the type in there brother
[1:02:57] that's a good question what is the type
[1:02:58] in there how can a man redeem
[1:03:00] himself he can't but notice even an
[1:03:04] uncle so if that's the closest male
[1:03:06] relative you have and you've lost some
[1:03:08] possession even your uncle so your dad's
[1:03:10] brother or your mom's brother the
[1:03:13] nearest male to you can restore what
[1:03:16] you've
[1:03:17] lost Hallelujah now let's go to the Book
[1:03:20] of Ruth we'll try to finish up here how
[1:03:21] am I going to finish I gotta do it Ruth
[1:03:26] Ruth is right before Judges Ruth and
[1:03:36] judges now we see the first mention in
[1:03:38] in Ruth 2 verse 20 now if you got a
[1:03:41] scull field Bible I don't know how many
[1:03:42] you have this
[1:03:44] but brother brandom
[1:03:47] preached the kinsman redeemer in the 50s
[1:03:50] I forget which year it was and he
[1:03:51] preached right out of here he pulls
[1:03:52] these exact words right out of the right
[1:03:54] out of Scofield's uh
[1:03:56] outline here oh that's the wrong one
[1:03:59] Ruth and
[1:04:03] judges I was pointing to the wrong
[1:04:07] book there it
[1:04:09] is scoffield puts four steps or four
[1:04:12] stages in the Book of Ruth and brother R
[1:04:14] preaches all four stages I'm just going
[1:04:17] to preach it to you
[1:04:18] today brother Bram said the first step
[1:04:20] is Ruth deciding to follow Jehovah
[1:04:23] that's
[1:04:24] justification this second Ruth serving
[1:04:27] that's sanctification amen she got to
[1:04:29] serve out there in the hot Fields am
[1:04:32] where it's really Burns some on your
[1:04:33] flesh breaking all these bad habits
[1:04:36] Church said and third is Ruth resting
[1:04:40] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:41] amen you find rest for your soul amen
[1:04:45] and the fourth is Ruth reward of course
[1:04:47] that's eternal life right that's we get
[1:04:48] those rewards at the marriage supper of
[1:04:50] the Lamb oh but brother preaches these
[1:04:52] four stages of Ruth out of the right out
[1:04:54] of Scofield's notes Here
[1:04:56] am amen praise God and this is a
[1:04:59] beautiful type because Ruth was a Mobius
[1:05:02] Ruth was a gentile Ruth had no hope the
[1:05:05] Bible said no moias can enter into the
[1:05:08] congregation for 14 years remember we
[1:05:09] preached that a few weeks ago not one of
[1:05:11] them can enter in but no doubt God let
[1:05:13] Ruth in Hallelujah because she came in
[1:05:16] by marriage she came in by Blood she
[1:05:19] came in by the kinsman redeemer
[1:05:22] Hallelujah God's law amen God's law of
[1:05:25] Grace amen the law required moabites
[1:05:28] couldn't come in but Grace met the
[1:05:30] requirements hallelujah oh I feel good
[1:05:33] now amen I can preach for another two
[1:05:35] hours but I'm not going to
[1:05:37] Hallelujah I better not Ruth 220 I'd be
[1:05:40] in big trouble then i' think I'd be
[1:05:41] stranded here is what would happen
[1:05:43] that'd be that'd be I would be stranded
[1:05:44] here
[1:05:45] hallelujah verse 20 and Naomi said unto
[1:05:48] her daughter-in-law Blessed Be he of the
[1:05:50] Lord who ha not left off his kindness to
[1:05:52] the living and to the dead and no said
[1:05:55] unto her the man is near of kin unto us
[1:05:59] one of our next
[1:06:01] Kinsmen okay so so Naomi is telling Ruth
[1:06:05] you know this guy Boaz he's pretty close
[1:06:08] to our Kinsman you need to go you need
[1:06:10] to go see him that's what happens in
[1:06:11] chapter 3 right let's go go to chapter 3
[1:06:14] verse
[1:06:15] 10 now you know the story she goes down
[1:06:18] there she initiates it now look at this
[1:06:20] church she initiates this
[1:06:24] marriage but the only way she could do
[1:06:26] that is because the word of God
[1:06:28] initiated her to do that amen now don't
[1:06:31] don't start spreading the doctrine
[1:06:32] brother Jesse says sisters can start
[1:06:34] choosing husbands no no no I didn't say
[1:06:36] that I didn't say
[1:06:37] that I know you wouldn't say that I'm
[1:06:40] just talking about the internet people
[1:06:41] you know how crazy they
[1:06:45] are but look what he tells her she tells
[1:06:48] her Naomi says no you go lay down there
[1:06:50] and lay at his feet and when he make
[1:06:51] sure make sure he's eat and drank a lot
[1:06:53] make sure he feels real good
[1:06:56] he's had a lot to eat and a lot to drink
[1:06:58] make sure he's fully satisfied church I
[1:07:00] didn't know this till today but Boaz was
[1:07:01] 80 years
[1:07:03] old 80
[1:07:07] 80 remember they were healthier longer
[1:07:10] right so even though he's 80 I mean he
[1:07:12] still still had good life
[1:07:15] left now verse 10 what I say verse
[1:07:19] 10 well actually wakes up let's go to
[1:07:21] verse n and he said who art thou and she
[1:07:23] answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread
[1:07:25] therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid
[1:07:27] for thou art a near
[1:07:30] Kinsman so he B she basically says
[1:07:32] spread your skirt over me take me in to
[1:07:34] be your
[1:07:36] wife right what does he say and he said
[1:07:40] never you never ask me you know no
[1:07:41] that's not I'm just adding that to the
[1:07:43] Bible for a drama he said blessed be
[1:07:46] thou the Lord my daughter for thou has
[1:07:49] show more kindness in the latter end
[1:07:50] than that at the beginning in as much as
[1:07:53] thou Foust not young men whether rich or
[1:07:57] poor so instantly Boaz realized you
[1:08:00] could have ran off and got a more rich
[1:08:02] husband than me even but if you done
[1:08:05] that you would have broke the word of
[1:08:07] God you would have denied the kinsman
[1:08:09] redeemer law in other words you're a
[1:08:12] word woman you're a sister that keeps
[1:08:15] the word you believe the word that's
[1:08:18] right and you know God will back up his
[1:08:20] word amen hallelujah you're trusting in
[1:08:22] the word in other words you trusted the
[1:08:24] word back there in Moab Hallelujah you
[1:08:27] trusted the word to follow Naomi you
[1:08:30] trusted that and you trusted uh Naomi
[1:08:32] when you got here and you gleaned to my
[1:08:35] field Hallelujah you trusted her all the
[1:08:37] way and she represents the Old Testament
[1:08:39] Hallelujah she represents the word of
[1:08:41] God hallelujah and Boaz represents Jesus
[1:08:44] Christ hallelujah
[1:08:46] amen you're blessed because you followed
[1:08:50] God's provided way
[1:08:52] hallelujah oh my Hallelujah
[1:08:59] John Gil says this he says instead of
[1:09:01] calling her an immodest woman for laying
[1:09:03] herself down at his feet and a bold
[1:09:04] impudent woman she being poor to ask
[1:09:07] marriage of him instead of being angry
[1:09:09] with her and chiding and reproving her
[1:09:10] for disturbing disturbing and
[1:09:12] frightening him in the night how many
[1:09:14] you like to get W woken up in the night
[1:09:16] I don't we got woken up last night sadly
[1:09:18] but who likes to get woken up in the
[1:09:20] middle of the night
[1:09:22] nobody so this shows the spirit of God
[1:09:24] was on this man
[1:09:28] Hallelujah instead of being frightened
[1:09:31] He blesses her and prays to God to bless
[1:09:33] her bless this woman and prosper her in
[1:09:36] what she has engaged and in a kind and
[1:09:38] loving manner calls her his
[1:09:41] daughter for thou has showed more
[1:09:43] kindness in the latter and than the
[1:09:44] beginning that is she showed kindness to
[1:09:47] her husband's family so she's respecting
[1:09:50] her husband's family who died she's
[1:09:52] still respecting them see it would have
[1:09:53] been disrespect to go to some other man
[1:09:56] right she had to follow God's law
[1:09:58] because God wants that man's seed to be
[1:10:01] continued amen God wants to honor that
[1:10:04] family honor that seed line don't go
[1:10:06] chasing somebody else stay in the family
[1:10:07] God gave
[1:10:09] you so she he recognizes you showed
[1:10:12] kindness to your deceased
[1:10:15] husband and she'd shown much love to her
[1:10:17] husband living and dying and her
[1:10:20] mother-in-law she could have walked away
[1:10:21] like orpa but she stayed with the word
[1:10:24] of God hallelujah
[1:10:25] I love that she said where you live I'll
[1:10:27] live where you die I'll die amen that's
[1:10:29] real dedication right there I want to
[1:10:31] live with you I want to die with you
[1:10:34] hallelujah boy said you show great
[1:10:36] kindness to your family you show great
[1:10:38] kindness to your deceased husband and
[1:10:40] your
[1:10:40] mother-in-law this woman Ruth she left
[1:10:44] her country and Kindred to come with her
[1:10:46] into a strange country and labor to
[1:10:48] support her her mother-in-law as she had
[1:10:50] done all which was great
[1:10:52] kindness and she was a proelite as well
[1:10:56] she showed kindness toward God right she
[1:10:58] showed a good spirit toward God but the
[1:11:01] kindness she showed now exceeded all the
[1:11:03] former and that she was desirous
[1:11:05] according to God's law to build up her
[1:11:07] husband's family this is how much God
[1:11:10] respects marriages and
[1:11:13] families this was the greatest of all
[1:11:15] respects because she's going to build up
[1:11:17] her husband's family look at the
[1:11:18] headship right there my goodness
[1:11:19] Hallelujah she didn't run to a different
[1:11:21] headship she stayed under the same
[1:11:23] headship and the right says this was the
[1:11:26] greatest respect of all to honor the
[1:11:28] headship you were placed
[1:11:29] under
[1:11:32] H to Mary the next near Kinsman even
[1:11:35] though an old man to raise up seed to
[1:11:37] the name and reme and memory of her
[1:11:39] husband my so in doing this and trying
[1:11:42] to marry into her husband's family she's
[1:11:45] honoring her husband and she's going to
[1:11:47] ra up raise up seed Hallelujah and we
[1:11:50] all know what come out of Ruth
[1:11:52] Hallelujah ohed Jesse and then all the
[1:11:54] way down to David and out of that comes
[1:11:56] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen God
[1:12:00] was pleased with this decision to be a
[1:12:02] kinsman redeemer praise God
[1:12:07] hallelujah I got to close here so let me
[1:12:10] just read brother RS
[1:12:14] quote he says now the Book of Ruth gives
[1:12:16] a beautiful picture Boaz and Naomi had
[1:12:18] lost the estate you you know you heard
[1:12:20] me preach on it haven't you raised your
[1:12:22] hands if you heard me preach on it so
[1:12:22] you understand Boaz had to become a
[1:12:24] redeemer and he was the only one that
[1:12:26] could he had to be a Kinsman a near
[1:12:28] Kinsman and in redeeming Naomi he got
[1:12:30] Ruth that was Jesus Boaz typing Christ
[1:12:34] and when he redeemed Israel he got the
[1:12:36] Gentile
[1:12:37] bride so then you see so very beautiful
[1:12:40] we have it on tape I'm I'm sure here
[1:12:42] somewhere you'd like to have
[1:12:44] it
[1:12:47] amen oh that's
[1:12:49] wonderful Hallelujah now I'm going to
[1:12:52] read this last part and then we'll
[1:12:53] finish up here Boaz said in as much as
[1:12:56] thou didn't follow the young men whether
[1:12:58] rich or poor she didn't go after she
[1:13:01] didn't go after the The Young and the
[1:13:03] rich and the
[1:13:04] famous there's a lot of other younger
[1:13:06] men she could have stronger men but she
[1:13:08] chose to marry an old
[1:13:10] man why because of respect to her
[1:13:12] husband and her husband's
[1:13:15] family the phrase of following young men
[1:13:17] is not to be understood as just
[1:13:18] committing fornication but marriage to
[1:13:20] them she shunned their company and
[1:13:22] conversation and did not put herself in
[1:13:24] the the way of being caressed and
[1:13:26] addressed by those young rich men and
[1:13:28] she refused everything of that sort so
[1:13:30] she just stayed away from the world
[1:13:32] Hallelujah no matter how glamorous it
[1:13:34] looks no matter how much they got to
[1:13:36] offer me I'm going to stay away from
[1:13:38] that I'm going to stay with the word oh
[1:13:41] what a character of the Gentile bride
[1:13:42] Hallelujah I don't care how beautiful
[1:13:44] the church is I don't care how rich the
[1:13:46] church is I don't care how much

[1:15:56] blood of Jesus Christ Lord it's clearly
[1:15:59] seen Lord in our lives we can see it
[1:16:01] clearly now before we lived according to
[1:16:04] the prince and power of the heir the
[1:16:05] Bible says but now we live according to
[1:16:07] the power of the spirit you purchase us

[1:16:48] there was no man worthy no woman worthy
[1:16:51] to be our kinsman redeemer to bring us
[1:16:52] back
[1:16:55] so that's why God had to make a
[1:16:56] substitute God had to create a virgin
[1:16:59] born
[1:17:00] son to pay the price and to bring us
[1:17:03] back and Lord I can see in my life Lord

[1:17:39] now with spiritual eyes we can see Lord
[1:17:41] God we were deep in sin with no way out
[1:17:45] but Lord you sent a worthy substitute
[1:17:47] you sent a kinsman redeemer to bring us
[1:17:49] out Hallelujah so we thank you for that
