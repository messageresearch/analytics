[5:07] he gave him up to all the things that
[5:08] they're doing now and you know why the
[5:09] world hates you

[11:42] praise the lord
[11:45] amen how many of you can say i've been

[11:51] to be
[11:52] amen
[11:54] hey praise the lord
[11:55] [Applause]
[11:59] the scripture says it's impossible for
[12:00] those that were once enlightened and
[12:02] have tasted the good word of god to
[12:04] renew under repentance but we're not as
[12:06] such amen we tasted the good word of god
[12:08] and we're going to press forward we're
[12:10] going to go keep going amen praise the
[12:13] lord
[12:13] [Applause]
[12:16] amen
[12:17] thank you i appreciate
[12:19] i'm just impressed with with your
[12:21] brother malachi and sister lydia with
[12:23] your musical abilities and brother amen
[12:26] i'd sir i so enjoy it it's a it's a it's
[12:29] it's a
[12:31] a joy to hear you know even such a small
[12:33] space you know you don't feel like oh we
[12:35] don't have a lot of musicians but you
[12:36] know what you can feel the heart in it
[12:38] and the real inspiration and it and it
[12:40] fills the room by the grace of god and
[12:42] it it really brings the spirit of the
[12:44] lord down i believe he's pleased with
[12:45] those sacrifices so
[12:47] you know by the grace of god we'll just
[12:48] give our testimony this evening brother
[12:50] jesse had asked me to do it last time
[12:51] and i and i didn't feel led but last
[12:54] night kind of right after the service i
[12:56] just lord really impressed upon my heart
[12:57] like it'll be a good time to do it so
[13:00] you know we want to you know no matter
[13:01] what your intentions are unless you do
[13:02] something in the season god desires you
[13:04] to do it it'll never be as effective so
[13:07] we believe that you know as that song
[13:08] even said right now is the moment today
[13:10] is the day so we'll uh we'll do that by
[13:13] the grace of god but uh we'll turn into
[13:15] a couple scriptures here first
[13:18] if we can uh the first one we'll do uh
[13:21] proverbs 22
[13:24] and verse one
[13:26] and then we're after that we're going to
[13:27] turn to hosea chapter 11. so just kind
[13:29] of have that in mind
[13:31] how many feel good to be in the house of
[13:33] the lord this evening it's good to see
[13:35] everyone out here sister wendy good to
[13:37] see you again so soon i'm uh you've
[13:39] probably heard i mean if you're
[13:40] listening to service yesterday but i
[13:41] told the testimony about being able to
[13:43] see at the restaurant so it's good to
[13:45] see you again and all those that were
[13:47] able to make it out here and
[13:49] and uh
[13:51] we're just grateful to the lord jesus so
[13:53] uh proverbs chapter 22 verse 1
[13:57] says a good name is rather to be chosen
[13:59] than great riches
[14:00] and loving favor rather than silver and
[14:03] gold
[14:04] amen and then we'll turn over to hosea
[14:07] chapter 11.
[14:10] and if you read if you were to read this
[14:11] whole thing you'll find out that it's
[14:12] quite a rebuke actually on the children
[14:14] of israel but i just want to pull out
[14:16] one scripture here in particular because
[14:19] i believe for all of us we could say
[14:20] that this
[14:21] typifies the life that we've been given
[14:23] in christ and what he's done for us
[14:26] in uh verse chapter 11 verse 4
[14:30] the lord says i drew them with cords of
[14:32] a man with bands of love
[14:35] and i was to them as they that take off
[14:38] the yoke on their jaws and i laid unto
[14:40] them neat and i laid meat unto
[14:42] them amen i've always been so struck by
[14:46] that scripture i
[14:48] it's that he drew them with bands of
[14:50] love and i and i know he drew me with
[14:51] bands of love and
[14:53] and i think all of us could have that
[14:54] testimony so
[14:56] as we'll just have a word of prayer and
[14:57] then
[14:58] just ask the lord to lead us and guide
[15:00] us in the little service this evening
[15:02] heavenly father
[15:03] lord as we just come before you once
[15:05] again to fellowship around your word
[15:06] lord and as again it's fallen my lot to
[15:09] to be behind the sacred desk this
[15:11] evening lord and just to give my
[15:12] testimony of what you've done for me and
[15:15] lord as
[15:16] we've even heard before it said that if
[15:18] you can't tell anything just tell how
[15:19] the candle got lit lord
[15:21] lord we want to tell that lord and maybe
[15:23] even a little more of the things that
[15:24] you've done since that time and
[15:27] lord more than anything father and all
[15:29] these things we want to give you glory
[15:30] father for there's no one else worthy
[15:32] lord there's no one else that's holy
[15:34] lord there's no one else oh god that was
[15:36] worthy lord to
[15:38] take the book and to loose the seals
[15:40] thereon father lord and we glorify the
[15:43] name of the lord jesus christ this
[15:45] evening lord we lift you up and magnify
[15:48] your name lord lord and everything
[15:50] that's said and done may be a glory to
[15:52] you father may give all glory and honor
[15:54] and praise to you father may you just
[15:55] anoint the speaker anoint the here lord
[15:58] may you just be
[15:59] get glory unto thyself this evening
[16:01] father and may you just anoint us lord
[16:03] to draw closer unto you father we ask
[16:06] these things father right now in the
[16:07] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[16:09] amen amen you may have your seats
[16:13] so i've maybe never given my testimony
[16:15] in such a we'd say an official capacity
[16:18] you know up here but
[16:19] uh you just bear with me we'll just kind
[16:21] of talk and wherever the lord would go
[16:23] we'll go with that but uh for those of
[16:26] you that don't know me uh mj i believe
[16:28] your names good
[16:29] good to meet you good to see you and you
[16:32] know by the grace of god always good to
[16:33] see new faces pressing into the kingdom
[16:35] in this dark age you know
[16:37] you know the the light is a precious
[16:39] thing
[16:40] the light of the gospel is a precious
[16:42] thing in this age you know
[16:43] and the scripture said that in that day
[16:45] there'd be a famine not for food or
[16:47] drink but for of hearing of the word of
[16:49] god and we know you know there's it's
[16:52] such a we even spoke a little bit
[16:54] yesterday
[16:55] of the of the idea of a paradox and
[16:57] things that seem to be in complete
[17:00] contradiction to each other but are yet
[17:01] true and isn't it a paradox that you can
[17:04] go down the street and see a church on
[17:05] every corner but yet the scripture says
[17:08] that in the last day there'd be a famine
[17:10] for the word of god because the true
[17:12] word of god is a precious thing and
[17:14] we've seen how it's been perverted in so
[17:16] many ways and
[17:17] and those things and you know for those
[17:19] that don't know me i'm my name is
[17:21] randall scott verton
[17:22] you can call me brother randy you can
[17:24] just call me brother you can call me
[17:25] whatever you want to call me as long as
[17:27] as long as you as long as uh you know as
[17:29] long as i'm called in into the marriage
[17:30] suffer i think we'll be okay
[17:33] uh but i was uh just kind of i guess
[17:35] give you a background i was born
[17:36] december 28 1983 so i'm going to be 38
[17:40] years old
[17:41] this year
[17:42] 2021 83 yeah so 38 this year and uh
[17:47] you know uh
[17:48] i you know i we don't you know we don't
[17:50] necessarily believe in christmas as it
[17:53] were but the world you know we use that
[17:54] as kind of a marking stone on the
[17:56] calendar and i always told people i'm
[17:57] the best christmas gift my parents ever
[17:59] received and i and knowing and knowing
[18:01] the truth of the gospel and the truth of
[18:03] the word i can say that without
[18:04] condemnation because we know jesus
[18:05] wasn't born on christmas so
[18:07] so i could say i'm not i'm not
[18:09] overstepping the bounds of the word of
[18:11] god by saying i was the best christmas
[18:12] gift my parents ever received because we
[18:14] don't go with that so but
[18:16] but you know i was born i was born there
[18:18] i was actually
[18:20] you know i was born in germany i was
[18:22] actually born in a a city called
[18:24] wiesbaden
[18:26] that's in the state of hessen or i guess
[18:28] province i don't know how they say it
[18:29] over there in germany but my dad was in
[18:31] the military he was in the air force
[18:33] and uh
[18:36] you know uh i was only there i don't
[18:37] speak any german or anything and i
[18:39] didn't have german citizenship because i
[18:41] was technically i think i was born on an
[18:43] air force base which is officially
[18:45] considered
[18:46] uh american soil
[18:48] which is uh which is kind of a powerful
[18:49] thing because if you think about it even
[18:51] though we're born in satan's eden
[18:53] physically our spiritual birth is in the
[18:56] in in the body of christ and even though
[18:58] we're inside inside than earth that
[19:00] seems to be owned by the devil is that
[19:02] we were born on property that he can't
[19:04] touch so our citizenship is in heaven so
[19:08] that's a pretty good inspiration right
[19:09] there i think that makes me feel really
[19:10] good about that so
[19:12] uh you know i i pray you just it's
[19:14] probably gonna be informal this evening
[19:15] so i trust you just bear with me i'd
[19:17] maybe i forgive me if i maybe joke a
[19:19] little too much or say i i'm a nervous
[19:21] person by nature so i get really i'm
[19:23] definitely not a public speaker by any
[19:25] means but we want him to speak anyway so
[19:27] but you know i was born there so i don't
[19:29] speak any german i was only there i
[19:31] think if i remember correctly i was only
[19:33] or i don't remember because i wasn't i
[19:34] was too young but i think my my dad told
[19:37] me we i was maybe only nine months old
[19:38] when they left because you know air
[19:40] force they kind of move you around so
[19:42] but uh just even a quick testimony even
[19:44] on my birth you know when i was born
[19:46] uh
[19:47] i for you know a period it was kind of a
[19:49] normal birth as far as they knew and
[19:51] then after a short period of time within
[19:53] a few weeks i couldn't eat i would they
[19:55] would try to feed me you know feed me a
[19:57] bottle or breastfeed me i don't know you
[19:59] know how it was but i would i would puke
[20:01] it all up shortly after i couldn't hold
[20:03] anything down and it would be kind of
[20:04] projectile vomiting where i just
[20:06] couldn't eat and they couldn't figure
[20:07] out what was wrong and they went to the
[20:09] doctors and they couldn't figure it out
[20:10] and
[20:11] and uh so they see the devil try to kill
[20:13] me right there you know and come to find
[20:15] out
[20:16] my parents uh went to doctors tried to
[20:18] find out and finally they found a doctor
[20:20] who was able to kind of deduce what it
[20:21] was and it was a it was a
[20:24] problem they call pyloric stenosis which
[20:26] i guess is actually reasonably common in
[20:29] in sometimes in children but if you know
[20:31] anatomy the pyloric valves are the
[20:33] little uh the little valves that open up
[20:35] into different parts usually of your
[20:37] intestines and things and the pyloric
[20:40] one is the one that opens from your
[20:41] stomach into the small intestine to
[20:43] begin digestion well pyloric stenosis is
[20:45] basically that muscle is kind of jammed
[20:47] shut
[20:48] and so i would eat but it couldn't get
[20:50] matched to stomach and i would just i
[20:52] would puke it up and my parents were
[20:53] really worried so they were able to do
[20:55] by the grace of the lord you know i'm
[20:56] still here so they did a little surgery
[20:57] on me when i was a baby they actually
[20:59] had to cut my stomach open and i have a
[21:00] scar to this day and they had to go in
[21:03] there and release it and i always kind
[21:05] of joked with people ever since that
[21:06] moment i never stopped eating because i
[21:08] like but i like to eat
[21:10] i really like to eat i didn't stop but
[21:12] you know but you know i see even then
[21:14] you know how the lord had grace on me
[21:16] you know that they were to find that so
[21:19] uh you know so growing up uh we lived in
[21:22] san antonio texas from there and my uh i
[21:24] have two younger sisters my first uh
[21:26] sister whose name is chelsea she was
[21:29] born in santa
[21:30] too young and then from there we moved
[21:32] up to
[21:33] to uh selfridge michigan which is kind
[21:36] of right on the eastern side i think if
[21:37] you were to look at michigan i think
[21:39] from your perspective it would look like
[21:40] that with the thumb over here selfridge
[21:42] i think is kind of right in this area
[21:44] it's right near a lake uh called lake
[21:46] saint clair which is a little lake kind
[21:48] of between the canadian and uh united
[21:49] states border there and air force base
[21:51] there and my other sister was born there
[21:53] and
[21:53] and uh i kind of always that's always a
[21:55] moment i kind of remember that's one of
[21:57] my
[21:58] most i'd say striking memories of my
[22:00] youth i don't some people have really
[22:02] good memories of their youth and i i
[22:04] kind of don't have a lot of memories of
[22:05] that and i don't know if it's because
[22:07] our home life might have not always been
[22:09] the greatest or something i don't know
[22:10] you know psychologists would try to tell
[22:12] you one reason or another why those
[22:13] things might be but uh
[22:15] one one striking memory i have was being
[22:17] there at the time in 1991 when the the
[22:19] gulf the first gulf war began and i and
[22:22] i always remembered that because as a
[22:24] child i was still i mean i guess 91 i
[22:26] would have been eight years old and i
[22:27] just remember having a great fear at
[22:29] that time because we were going to war
[22:31] and knowing that my dad was in the
[22:32] military at the time and he was just
[22:34] actually i didn't know but he was just
[22:36] actually getting out of the military and
[22:38] to go into what he would do later but i
[22:40] remember having a great fear and
[22:41] watching the news when i was a child and
[22:43] seeing the tanks going into iraq and
[22:45] kuwait and these things i was like oh my
[22:47] and it was just kind of a one of those
[22:49] seminal moments of your childhood that
[22:51] always kind of stuck with me and
[22:53] but by the grace of god my dad didn't
[22:55] have to do that he was he had gotten out
[22:56] of the military and gotten another job
[22:58] as an air traffic controller and so we
[23:00] ended up moving down to ohio you know an
[23:02] hour an hour and a half south or so and
[23:06] you know from there
[23:07] uh we ended up in uh
[23:09] springfield ohio so over there kind of
[23:12] kind of actually we're near where we ate
[23:14] dinner dinner with sister wendy and then
[23:15] the other night uh
[23:17] when we moved there i was in uh i think
[23:19] first and second grade and
[23:20] and then from there uh we moved over to
[23:23] delta ohio which is where i spent the
[23:25] majority of my childhood and graduating
[23:27] high school from and i moved there in
[23:28] third grade
[23:29] and uh
[23:31] you know the the lord just has a way
[23:34] when you look back it's amazing how i
[23:36] believe you know uh
[23:38] even brother jesse you know as i'm
[23:40] reading i was began to read your book a
[23:41] little bit i told you i started to read
[23:43] your book and on the the 12 revealed
[23:45] mysteries that we have in this that
[23:47] we've been received in this age and and
[23:49] one of the scriptures that stuck out to
[23:51] me that i'm always impressed by is how
[23:53] it pleases god to hide things
[23:56] you know it it god gets pleasure in
[23:58] hiding things and then revealing things
[24:00] to those who he would desire to do it to
[24:02] and and i find even in our own lives he
[24:04] does that to us without us even knowing
[24:06] i believe in the book of job
[24:08] it says that god would even implant
[24:10] instruction in a man's dream
[24:12] and then he and
[24:13] and maybe it's just my own little idea
[24:15] that i have but i've often we have that
[24:16] idea of deja vu where you'll have an
[24:18] instance like i've been here before and
[24:20] how many of you had that where you've
[24:22] been in a situation and it's almost like
[24:24] you could
[24:25] almost feel like you could reach out and
[24:26] tell what was going to happen because
[24:28] you know you've been there before and to
[24:30] me that's always been a comforting thing
[24:31] because i think about that scripture and
[24:33] job how lord perhaps you you know you've
[24:36] maybe four ordained this moment for me
[24:38] to be here and now i'm i'm actually
[24:40] living out that instruction that you've
[24:41] given to me you know but you've hidden
[24:42] it you know many times i feel the lord
[24:44] has to hide things from us
[24:46] because if it were up to us we'd try to
[24:47] put our hands into it and and we would
[24:49] mess it up
[24:51] but i reminded also of the scripture
[24:53] where in the old testament when the lord
[24:55] commanded the children of israel he said
[24:56] if you were to build an altar unto me he
[24:58] said do not lift do not lift up your
[25:00] tool upon mine altar for you will
[25:02] pollute it and how often we take the
[25:05] tools of man and our own ideas and our
[25:07] own
[25:08] our own thoughts on something and we try
[25:09] to mess around with the things of god
[25:11] without even knowing it but we're
[25:12] polluting the things of god
[25:14] which is one of the reasons why we
[25:16] understand god despises denominations so
[25:18] much because man takes their tools of
[25:20] intellect and theology and their own
[25:23] intellectual ideas and they put their
[25:25] hands to the word of god and the lord is
[25:27] holy and those those unholy hands that
[25:30] would try to try to grab the word of god
[25:32] and do something with it that's
[25:33] unrighteous how dare we would do such a
[25:35] thing you know so
[25:36] i i'm just always i'm amazed by that and
[25:39] i and i say all that to say from from
[25:41] the point on you know all your life
[25:44] leading up to certain moments
[25:46] god hides it many times from us and it
[25:48] isn't until there's a reason why you
[25:50] know there's i'm always amazed at how
[25:52] even in our language in in the the way
[25:54] that we've heard things how things are
[25:57] hidden even in our language the truths
[25:59] of god
[26:00] you know one thing i've said you know
[26:02] people
[26:03] use this as an insult and i don't think
[26:04] they understand how much of an insult it
[26:06] is and how how deep and evil it goes but
[26:08] how many of you heard the phrase have
[26:10] you if someone would look at something
[26:11] that someone does something silly or you
[26:13] know what we would call that stupid or
[26:15] so i hate to use that word but oh that
[26:16] was a stupid thing to do and they said
[26:18] what were you born in a barn did you
[26:19] know that's a direct reference to jesus
[26:21] christ because jesus christ was born in
[26:23] a barn you know i've always thought
[26:25] that struck me one day and i said my how
[26:27] how much of an unrighteous even saying
[26:29] that is but even in that declaring the
[26:31] works of god and they don't even know it
[26:33] you know to say because they thought it
[26:34] was an unrighteous thing to be born in a
[26:36] barn and he had a bad name you know we
[26:37] read in the scripture in proverbs there
[26:39] you know a good name is to be chosen
[26:41] rather than riches and gold and all
[26:43] these things and yet jesus humbled
[26:45] himself to come underneath the bad name
[26:46] of what what the world thought was
[26:48] infidelity and being what they thought
[26:50] was a bastard child
[26:52] and yet he bore that reproach for you
[26:54] and me and i thank the lord jesus for it
[26:56] i mean we can't even comprehend those
[26:58] things but
[26:59] uh again
[27:00] and you forgive me i i know i sometimes
[27:02] maybe ramble but we're just trusting
[27:04] it's the lord i trust for saying
[27:05] something to bless you so but i think
[27:07] about that phrase often about hindsight
[27:09] being 20 20. you know it's always easier
[27:11] and it's clearer once you pass something
[27:13] to look back and say oh this could have
[27:16] been this and i should have done that
[27:17] and it is true in our lives and how
[27:19] often we've crossed a path and we look
[27:22] back and see what the lord has done
[27:23] after the fact and how much of a how
[27:25] much of a hand he had in our lives you
[27:27] know
[27:28] and so
[27:29] you know i we moved over there into
[27:31] delta ohio and you know my parents
[27:35] had gotten saved i believe
[27:38] while they were in san antonio there was
[27:40] a
[27:41] oh i can't think of his name now brother
[27:43] jesse may be able to remind me of it but
[27:45] he was a great
[27:47] denominational minister that was uh john
[27:49] hagee was that was headquartered i
[27:51] believe in san antonio or somewhere in
[27:53] that might have been houston in that
[27:54] area and i don't think they had directly
[27:57] gone to his services but maybe watching
[27:59] it on the tv or something at the time
[28:01] the lord convicted them and brought them
[28:03] under under that and and the lord
[28:05] brought them to salvation by the grace
[28:07] of god and you know they served the lord
[28:08] the best they could and when we when we
[28:10] moved into delta
[28:11] uh they were looking for a church and
[28:13] they just happened upon delta assembly
[28:14] of god and uh and many you maybe heard
[28:18] some of the testimonies from obviously
[28:19] brother jesse and brother simon and and
[28:22] different ones maybe brother cam and we
[28:24] all went to that church together you
[28:25] know and it was it's such a that's
[28:27] another uh hindsight being 20 20 thing
[28:29] you see how the lord is able to bring
[28:32] these
[28:32] seeds together into one place at a
[28:35] certain time to hear the word of god
[28:37] and we went there when i was pretty
[28:39] young so i would have been you know this
[28:41] would have been
[28:42] you know
[28:43] i guess 93 or so something along that
[28:46] lines i'm not really good with dates
[28:47] when it comes to remembrance but
[28:49] i would have been in third grade and we
[28:51] started going to this delta assembly of
[28:52] god church was a assembly of god
[28:54] denomination and
[28:56] and uh by the grace of god to have a
[28:58] church to go to and everything and i
[28:59] remember being just such a
[29:02] a nervous child and i was always very
[29:04] socially awkward with people and we
[29:06] would go into the church service and at
[29:08] the time they hadn't built a new
[29:09] building yet but they had uh they had
[29:12] the little building that they used that
[29:14] was in the middle of town and chris
[29:15] sister kristen you might remember that
[29:17] how small that was and and
[29:19] they would have the song services and
[29:21] things and then they would release the
[29:23] children to go to sunday school and you
[29:24] went downstairs basically it was like a
[29:26] kind of a dungeon area it was so dark
[29:28] and damp and dank and but i just
[29:30] remember i used to be so scared of of
[29:33] being around people that i would uh
[29:36] because brother jesse's mom taught a lot
[29:38] of the sunday schools for the children
[29:40] down there and it wasn't her in
[29:41] particular it was just being around
[29:43] people and being nervous i would go and
[29:45] hide in the bathroom and i would stay in
[29:46] the bathroom for the whole sunday school
[29:48] sometimes and just sit in the bathroom
[29:50] stall close the door and just sit there
[29:52] the whole time and just being like just
[29:54] such a nervous wreck and you know it's
[29:56] amazing now the lord has me up in front
[29:58] of people ministering the gospel and you
[30:00] know it but the lord you know that he
[30:02] takes the the weak things of this world
[30:04] to to confound the strong and the the
[30:06] base things to confound you know the
[30:09] things that the world calls great so i'm
[30:10] thankful for that and
[30:12] you know so we went to church and
[30:14] you know uh by the grace of the lord you
[30:16] know from a young age
[30:18] uh you know i felt
[30:19] you know i believed in god as much as i
[30:22] could because i was raised up that way
[30:23] my you know
[30:24] you know parents no parents perfect no
[30:26] person is perfect but my parents i
[30:28] believe did the best they could and you
[30:30] know we went to church and you know
[30:32] tried to serve the lord the best we
[30:33] could and uh you know from there i
[30:36] didn't know at the time you know when
[30:37] you're that young you know there's you
[30:39] know the age differences seem a lot
[30:41] greater at the time when you're really
[30:43] young so i didn't really know maybe
[30:44] brother jesse or brother cam and simon
[30:47] as well because they would have been
[30:48] well ahead in sunday school classes
[30:49] maybe in a different sunday school or
[30:51] something like that but
[30:52] we came to know each other much better
[30:53] later on
[30:54] but uh you know and i remember during
[30:57] that period they moved over to the new
[30:59] church that they had built
[31:00] the assembly of god and i don't remember
[31:02] the date but i remember i was probably
[31:04] 13 14 years old when i really gave my
[31:07] heart to the lord i remember being in
[31:08] the service and i don't remember who was
[31:10] preaching i know it was a visiting
[31:12] minister i think they were having
[31:13] revival meetings and i just remember
[31:14] having that tug on my heart that i
[31:17] really wanted to serve the lord and i
[31:18] really what you know you become aware of
[31:21] of your sins you know you become aware
[31:23] of what you are and that you need a
[31:25] savior
[31:26] you know
[31:27] you that line of accountability where
[31:29] there becomes a revelation to you of wow
[31:31] i need a savior you know it's one thing
[31:33] when you're a child and everything's
[31:34] just ooh i just do whatever i want i'm a
[31:36] child and and then you you become to
[31:38] that realization like lord there is a
[31:41] heaven there is a hell
[31:42] there there is right and there is wrong
[31:45] and there is there is more you you start
[31:47] to maybe don't even have a full
[31:49] revelation of you come to grasp with
[31:50] your own mortality as it were where you
[31:52] start to realize
[31:54] this life that i have is going to end
[31:57] and what happens at the end of it and
[31:59] the lord by his grace gave me a desire i
[32:02] remember being in the service and just
[32:03] you know they they did the simple thing
[32:05] then it's like if you'd like to give
[32:06] your heart to the lord just raise your
[32:07] hand while you had your head bowed and i
[32:09] remember raising my hand and and i
[32:11] remember i remember something like even
[32:13] my dad grabbing my hand and probably
[32:15] knowing that i had raised my hand and
[32:17] probably being rejoicing in that and i
[32:19] remember giving my heart to the lord and
[32:20] you know you did the best you could when
[32:22] you're a child you know and
[32:24] you know i remember trying you know
[32:25] reading my bible and praying as much as
[32:27] i could and
[32:29] that i knew as much as i knew and you
[32:30] know for what the revelation i had and
[32:33] so as time went on you serve the lord
[32:34] you get to high school and you know you
[32:36] start to do things
[32:38] you're going through school and i was
[32:40] always the nerdy
[32:41] geeky one i always you know i called
[32:43] myself i was i was the king of the nerds
[32:45] as it were because my uh my my senior
[32:47] year in high school i was president of
[32:49] the band president of the show choir and
[32:51] president of the national honor society
[32:53] so i had the nerd trifecta going on you
[32:55] know and uh
[32:57] so
[32:58] and uh but you know it's something you
[33:00] know how the lord
[33:02] you the lord uh
[33:04] he's so sovereign in his ways and
[33:06] and uh
[33:07] you think you have your life planned out
[33:09] you know from a young even from being
[33:11] young i suppose
[33:14] and uh again i kind of
[33:16] it's kind of
[33:17] fortuitous i guess i would say or or i
[33:19] believe of the lord that i've been
[33:20] reading your book brother jesse because
[33:22] you in the beginning of the book you
[33:23] talked about how as christians we we
[33:26] take a real uh heart it we really take
[33:29] to heart
[33:30] real true romance
[33:32] and the real idea of the romantic like
[33:35] of the the husband and a wife in a real
[33:37] true relationship in that way because
[33:39] there's something in us that you don't
[33:40] even explain and you can't even know
[33:42] until the revelation comes but there's
[33:44] something in you that's yearning for
[33:45] that in the spiritual even in the
[33:47] natural and even as a young person i
[33:50] remember having that desire of i wanted
[33:53] to get married and have children and
[33:54] have an awesome family
[33:56] you know that that was my desire was i
[33:58] always said lord i want to find someone
[34:00] i wanted to get married young i wanted
[34:02] to have children young because my maybe
[34:04] part of it was because my parents did my
[34:06] parents were my parents got married in
[34:08] january
[34:09] of 1983 when they were 18 and 19 years
[34:12] old and i was born that december so they
[34:14] had me very very young you know and
[34:17] and i always thought to myself like lord
[34:19] i always wanted that for myself that was
[34:21] always my personal desire was lord i
[34:22] wanted to get married i want to have
[34:24] children young said lord i want to be
[34:26] really young so i could play sports with
[34:27] them or do whatever else would be young
[34:29] with them you know and and the lord you
[34:31] know had other plans for me so but i i
[34:34] you know going through that but that was
[34:35] always in my mind and i and when i
[34:37] became a christian
[34:39] you know i started to realize like lord
[34:40] if i'm going to get married i need to
[34:41] marry a christian woman you know i want
[34:43] to marry someone and you know you don't
[34:45] have maybe the revelation
[34:47] at the time
[34:49] without the holy ghost or really having
[34:51] a full revelation of the truth of this
[34:53] hour
[34:54] how deep that really needs to go
[34:56] you know you just think when i was young
[34:58] that young maybe just getting into high
[34:59] school and starting to think that way as
[35:01] those changes are coming on and you're
[35:03] thinking about like oh i'd like to have
[35:04] a boyfriend or a girlfriend if you get
[35:06] married you know you start oh i would
[35:08] just like to have someone that's you
[35:10] know kind of in the church that seems to
[35:11] be a christian and i would just say to
[35:13] all the young people out there that may
[35:14] be getting to that point it goes deeper
[35:16] than just seeing someone in church it
[35:18] goes deeper than even just someone that
[35:20] may come to church seemingly faithfully
[35:22] or whatever but you make sure that that
[35:24] person is baptized and filled with the
[35:26] holy ghost because because it goes
[35:28] beyond just someone that would come to
[35:30] church or profess a christian christian
[35:32] life but it's got to be someone that's
[35:33] that's in that body it's got to be
[35:35] someone that's been baptized with the
[35:37] same baptism that you've received and if
[35:39] you haven't received it you need to
[35:40] receive it
[35:41] you know so i would just encourage and
[35:43] we have so many little young ones here
[35:45] and and ones that are even coming to
[35:47] those ages is you know don't don't just
[35:49] think you know when i was young we
[35:51] didn't i didn't know i could say by the
[35:52] grace of god i didn't know any i truly
[35:54] didn't know any better because i i only
[35:56] knew as much as our denomination taught
[35:58] you know was i believed in salvation and
[36:00] i and to be honest uh you know brother
[36:03] jesse would i'm sure agreed to this you
[36:05] know test testimony that to us the holy
[36:07] ghost was nothing more than just
[36:09] something
[36:11] i mean you know we talk about third
[36:12] person in a trinity but
[36:14] the trinity is such an evil concept
[36:16] anyway that it truly takes away a
[36:19] revelation of what the holy ghost is
[36:21] that it is god himself dwelling in his
[36:23] people
[36:25] but you're not taught that in
[36:26] denomination they don't have a concept
[36:28] of that you're just you know to them
[36:30] it's just a power you know at the very
[36:32] least i could say praise the lord that
[36:33] we were at least in a pentecostal church
[36:36] that at least believed in a power of god
[36:39] and didn't believe in just a dead letter
[36:40] or something along that lines but they
[36:42] took it definitely the wrong way you
[36:44] know and and were going well it was just
[36:46] basically a power the holy ghost comes
[36:47] on you speak in tongues and maybe you
[36:49] could do some miracles and maybe get
[36:51] slain in the spirit or wherever it was
[36:53] but that was about as far as it really
[36:54] went as far as they would understand
[36:56] that so
[36:57] i i so my understanding was lord i just
[37:00] i wanted a christian wife and
[37:02] you know and uh you know we'd go to the
[37:04] we'd go to the youth conventions and all
[37:06] the different things that you go to and
[37:08] oh my
[37:09] brothers and sisters looking back on it
[37:10] now i say lord thank you for your grace
[37:13] and mercy because
[37:14] oh my it's they you know brothers and
[37:16] sisters those of you that uh that maybe
[37:19] have been in the denominational ranks or
[37:21] if you've been blessed to not have seen
[37:23] that oh my it's nothing but idolatry
[37:26] it's nothing but
[37:28] frivolous and uh and uh and it's really
[37:31] and if i could almost use a term if i
[37:33] could say it this way it's almost it's
[37:34] spiritual debauchery
[37:36] because it's it because they're they're
[37:38] drunk but they're not even drunk with
[37:40] with the wine or the the the stimulation
[37:42] of revelation but they're just they're
[37:44] it's uh it's it's a
[37:46] looking back on it now i was even
[37:47] thinking as i was kind of getting ready
[37:49] to come to service and i started
[37:50] thinking back to a specific youth
[37:52] convention that i went to and i remember
[37:54] brother jesse you remember at the end of
[37:55] the youth conventions they would always
[37:57] do like a big concert at the end of the
[37:59] convention i remember this year i don't
[38:00] remember who it was i think it was like
[38:01] skillet or something like one of those
[38:03] one of those silly things and i remember
[38:05] being up there
[38:06] and seeing the people down because we
[38:08] were where we were sitting at was kind
[38:10] of like in the higher there's a huge
[38:11] stadium and i remember sitting up there
[38:13] and looking down below and they people
[38:15] were doing like weird dances and and it
[38:18] was just so strange and i even i
[38:19] remember seeing something along that
[38:21] like that lines later and it was just
[38:23] nothing but like a spirituality
[38:25] like kind of a rave what they would call
[38:26] a rave where they do drugs and get in
[38:28] there and do all kinds of crazy things
[38:30] and they were doing those things and you
[38:32] start to see my lord it's nothing but a
[38:34] brother it's nothing but a feast of baal
[38:36] poor
[38:36] there's nothing you start to see what it
[38:38] is i say oh my lord have mercy thank you
[38:40] lord for sparing me
[38:42] and for allowing me you know not to get
[38:44] too deep into those things and
[38:46] and uh
[38:48] and
[38:49] you know i remember at that time going
[38:52] through this and saying lord i really
[38:54] you know i had so many plans made for my
[38:56] own life you know growing up from a
[38:58] young child i wanted to be a fighter
[38:59] pilot
[39:00] that was my life's goal you know i had a
[39:03] i had a very short period of time in my
[39:05] life maybe when i was like 12 13 years
[39:07] old where i thought i want to be an
[39:08] architect
[39:10] and then i came back to my senses and
[39:11] said that's just really boring and i
[39:13] want to i still want to be a fighter
[39:14] pilot you know that and i but that was
[39:16] always my dream i think you know i
[39:18] always wanted to be in a i always wanted
[39:19] to be in a fighter jet blasting
[39:22] 2000 miles an hour and turning nine g's
[39:25] and and up there flying and soaring and
[39:27] and i did everything in my power once i
[39:29] started learning i you know i started i
[39:31] started being physically active i
[39:32] started i started doing uh 200 push-ups
[39:35] a day 200 sit-ups a day and running two
[39:37] and a half three miles a day because i
[39:39] was like i need to pass this physical
[39:40] fitness test to get into the air force
[39:42] academy and learn all these things i
[39:43] needed to be good in school and by the
[39:45] grace of the lord i've always been good
[39:47] at that i was really i didn't enjoy
[39:49] school but the lord let me be good at it
[39:50] so i i didn't you know by his grace i
[39:53] was able to do that and and i had this
[39:55] thing in my mind of lord i'm gonna i'm
[39:57] gonna i'm gonna get married i'm gonna be
[40:00] a fighter pilot and then when i get done
[40:02] with that i'm gonna get out of being in
[40:04] the military if i've been in the
[40:05] military for 20 years i'm going to i'm
[40:08] going to get out of the military and i'm
[40:09] going to fly passenger jets and make a
[40:10] bunch of money that was always that was
[40:12] i had a plan
[40:14] i had it laid out for me in my mind of
[40:16] what i was going to do because i that's
[40:18] just the way i was i you know and and
[40:19] brother brain and my you know brother
[40:21] branham i believe even told her sister
[40:22] they said you always cross bridges
[40:23] before you get to him and that's how we
[40:25] do sometimes is we always have it all
[40:27] set up but i praise the lord
[40:29] for his disrupting power
[40:32] because he has a way of he has a way of
[40:34] disrupting your life you know i think i
[40:36] think about think about the apostle paul
[40:39] and how paul no doubt had his life
[40:41] already mapped out for himself
[40:43] he was going to be a great man amongst
[40:45] the pharisees he had already risen
[40:46] through the ranks he had done all these
[40:48] taught under gamalia and and was raising
[40:51] through the ranks and was well respected
[40:53] and had all these i am gonna i'm gonna
[40:55] be zealous for my god for jehovah i'm
[40:58] gonna be zealous for jehovah within the
[41:00] ranks of the pharisees and even pulling
[41:02] them to prison he said hauling the
[41:03] saints off to prison with letters from
[41:05] damascus to haul him off the prison i
[41:07] mean he had a plan
[41:09] but praise god for the holy ghost that
[41:11] pillar of fire came and struck him down
[41:13] and
[41:14] disrupted his life
[41:17] for the better
[41:18] and so and i can say each one of us have
[41:21] that testimony of how god came and
[41:23] disrupted your life
[41:24] you thought you had something planned
[41:26] out or you thought you had it all
[41:27] together and then here comes god like a
[41:29] like a bowling ball to just knock over
[41:31] everything down and you know what he
[41:32] does you know i started to come to a
[41:35] revelation and and forgive me brother
[41:36] jesse if maybe this doesn't sound quite
[41:38] as right as maybe you teach it but this
[41:40] is the way at least the lord showed it
[41:41] to me i always wondered at that
[41:43] scripture where it said they said i lay
[41:45] now in zion uh uh
[41:47] stumbling stone in a rock of a fence and
[41:50] said whoever falls in it will she shall
[41:51] be broken but on whomsoever shall fall
[41:53] shall be ground a powder and i always
[41:55] wondered at that scripture and the lord
[41:57] seemed to speak to me of of how that
[42:00] if we don't fall upon that rock you will
[42:03] fall upon that rock and you will be
[42:04] broken
[42:05] but god binds the brokenhearted he puts
[42:08] the pieces back together but but if you
[42:10] wait and that stone falls upon you that
[42:12] judgment is going to be that's going to
[42:14] be a rough one
[42:15] and so i find
[42:17] that when the lord comes through and
[42:19] causes you to fall upon that rock
[42:21] you become a broken individual
[42:23] you become broken
[42:25] but i praise the lord that he's allowed
[42:26] me he allowed me to fall upon that rock
[42:29] and that even though i was broken he
[42:31] bound me back up he's made me whole in
[42:33] him and so
[42:35] i had all these plans and and i don't i
[42:37] really don't want to go long because we
[42:38] went so long yesterday but i'm just i
[42:40] guess this is the way the lord's leading
[42:41] me to go so but
[42:43] i had all these plans in my life and i
[42:45] had a i even had a girl that i knew i
[42:48] was sure to marry
[42:49] and she was in the church you know i i
[42:52] you know
[42:53] she was the only only girl for the
[42:55] longest time i had asked to date and i
[42:56] was so scared that i did it by a letter
[42:59] i wrote a letter and i and and but she
[43:01] rejected me you know
[43:03] and and i was really really sad about
[43:05] that i was really depressed about that
[43:07] and at that at that time as well my
[43:10] parents had my parents had gotten
[43:11] divorced
[43:12] and uh
[43:14] you know i was i want to say i was a
[43:16] sophomore in high school for maybe a
[43:17] freshman i'm like i said dates i'm
[43:19] always i'm really rough with dates and
[43:21] specific timings but my parents my
[43:23] parents got divorced
[43:25] and at that time that that girl had
[43:27] rejected me and i went through i was
[43:29] really just down and depressed and i
[43:31] that summer i had gone and lived with my
[43:33] aunt and uncle and my dad as he had
[43:35] moved out and gone up there to live in
[43:36] michigan just for the summer and went
[43:38] through high school and different things
[43:40] and
[43:41] and i kind of poured myself into you
[43:43] know uh
[43:45] trying to get ready to go to the air
[43:46] force academy so i had started to do
[43:48] those ex physical things and exercise i
[43:50] started trying to get you know in my
[43:51] first cup my first year or so in high
[43:53] school i didn't really do anything
[43:54] because i was such a nervous person
[43:56] didn't really want to get involved in
[43:57] anything and then i was like i found out
[43:59] that in order to be go into the air
[44:00] force academy they want to see a record
[44:03] of of things that you've done in school
[44:04] like being involved in things so i
[44:06] started i went out for track even though
[44:08] i couldn't run and i i've run like they
[44:11] put me in the 100 meter dash and
[44:13] and i was running like 13 seconds
[44:15] because i'm just i'm bottom heavy and
[44:16] i'm not built to run i'm just it's not
[44:18] the way i was built and
[44:20] and but i did those things just because
[44:21] i knew i needed to do it i started
[44:23] trying to get involved
[44:24] and uh and it was really interesting
[44:26] because you see how the lord will allow
[44:29] things to come along
[44:31] and and you'll build them up in a
[44:33] certain way thinking that this has got
[44:34] to be it this has got to be it because
[44:36] my between my junior and senior year
[44:38] high school
[44:40] the girl that i was sure i was going to
[44:42] marry
[44:43] we actually uh
[44:45] saw each other again at sam and sam and
[44:48] rachel's wedding and she came along and
[44:52] she wrote a little letter to me and was
[44:54] like i'm sorry i rejected you you're
[44:56] actually a really great guy you want to
[44:58] date or whatever and i was like
[45:00] yeah i was so happy you know
[45:02] and and and so we went through that
[45:05] period and and kind of you know doing
[45:08] whatever it was and i was so awkward i
[45:09] didn't even know how to date so i had
[45:11] with the world called dating i was just
[45:13] like oh this is great i don't know what
[45:15] i'm doing and i was still so nervous and
[45:17] all these things and
[45:18] uh
[45:20] and you know i i just say this to glo
[45:23] to give glory to god you know me being
[45:25] such an awkward person and so nervous he
[45:27] spared me from a lot of things brothers
[45:29] sisters because if it wasn't for the
[45:31] fact that when it came to social
[45:33] engagements of any kind whether it be
[45:35] interpersonal or otherwise i was so
[45:37] nervous
[45:38] that you know in high school and things
[45:40] you know
[45:41] people do a lot of things you know
[45:43] especially in this age but even back
[45:45] then i guess now
[45:46] sister kristen would think like we've
[45:47] been out of high school almost like 20
[45:49] years now right and my lord like 20 plus
[45:52] years and 20 plus years ago things were
[45:54] even so different back then the way we
[45:56] acted you know it may not have been
[45:57] righteous but it definitely didn't seem
[45:59] as insane as it is today
[46:01] and uh he just goes to show the the
[46:03] condition of the world right now
[46:05] but you know i was so nervous i couldn't
[46:07] even bring myself to hold her hand
[46:09] you know and the lord used that to spare
[46:11] me from a lot of things but uh you know
[46:14] i i you know i thought i had but i tell
[46:16] you what even though i that part made me
[46:18] really nervous i was so rejoicing in
[46:20] myself because i thought i had it all
[46:22] now i was like cool my dream girl was
[46:24] going to marry me for sure because you
[46:26] know i was already in my mind i was like
[46:29] we're already married we're having
[46:30] children she's gonna you're going to the
[46:32] you're going to go with me when i'm in
[46:33] the air force and this is i'm going to
[46:35] go be a fighter pilot and my dreams are
[46:36] coming to life you know
[46:38] i was so positive about it and then i
[46:40] remember uh right at the end of that
[46:42] school year
[46:43] uh everything just started to fall apart
[46:45] and this would have been in 2002
[46:47] and uh
[46:48] she broke up with me
[46:50] and i was depressed
[46:52] i was so down and and and i was like
[46:55] well you know okay i guess this is
[46:57] what's i guess this is happening and i
[46:59] you know didn't take to the rejection
[47:00] well and i was so down and you know
[47:02] you're immature at that age anyway and
[47:04] and it's even compounded by the fact
[47:06] that i was so awkward and didn't know
[47:07] how to do social interactions and and uh
[47:11] and then and then on top of that i
[47:12] received a letter from the air force
[47:14] saying that they rejected me from the
[47:15] air force academy
[47:17] and uh
[47:18] and because my eyesight was bad and i
[47:20] had really terrible eyesight at the time
[47:22] i had i think it was like something like
[47:23] 2200
[47:24] 20 over 200 eyesight like from here from
[47:27] me to you brother amen i wouldn't be
[47:29] able to i could only i would i would
[47:30] know you because i know your shape but
[47:32] you would just be a big blob you know my
[47:34] eyesight was that bad
[47:36] and uh oh brothers and sisters i was so
[47:38] depressed i was so all my dreams just
[47:40] got shattered
[47:42] and uh
[47:43] yeah and uh so
[47:46] i i'm i'll now reverse a little bit so
[47:49] during that time in the interim time
[47:51] there i as i'm getting older into high
[47:53] school i start to know brother cam and
[47:55] brother simon a little bit better and
[47:56] brother jesse and jesse was always so
[47:59] involved in so many extracurriculars at
[48:01] the time that i didn't really maybe know
[48:03] him as well at the time
[48:04] and uh and brother cam and brother simon
[48:07] were a little bit older than me
[48:09] but we always got along so well and and
[48:11] and them two also kind of being a little
[48:14] bit older kind of really dealt with more
[48:16] of the youth in the in the church that
[48:18] we were going to
[48:19] and so we got to know each other really
[48:21] well and fellowshipped a lot and i was
[48:22] really blessed by that we kind of had
[48:24] our little group that we fellowshipped
[48:26] with there
[48:27] at the assembly of god church
[48:29] and i just thought i had it all together
[48:31] at the time you know and
[48:33] and uh we fellowshipped in all those
[48:34] things and tried to serve the lord best
[48:36] we could
[48:37] and uh
[48:39] you know
[48:42] i remember
[48:43] all of a sudden now at this time that
[48:45] sort of in 2001
[48:46] brother simon stopped going to the
[48:48] church
[48:49] i didn't think anything of it because i
[48:50] was so busy you're so busy with your own
[48:52] life and i wasn't at the time as close
[48:55] with brother simon because the age
[48:56] difference was a little bit more he was
[48:58] quite a bit older and so
[49:01] i you know brother simon had stopped
[49:02] going to the church
[49:04] and i know i think
[49:05] and correct me if i'm wrong brother
[49:06] jesse but i think even before the met
[49:09] you come to the message you kind of left
[49:10] the assembly of god there so you had
[49:12] already kind of moved on and i didn't
[49:14] hadn't known brother jesse as well but i
[49:16] knew he had kind of moved on to another
[49:17] church i think it was in toledo or
[49:19] something if i remember right something
[49:20] along those lines and and then brother
[49:22] simon had kind of just kind of quietly
[49:24] just disappeared
[49:25] and i remember
[49:27] and i remember i'll always remember this
[49:29] because i remember uh this would have
[49:31] been in the summer so during this time
[49:34] now brother simon had already kind of
[49:36] left i didn't really think much of it
[49:38] didn't really ask anything about it and
[49:39] nobody really talked about it
[49:41] and uh
[49:43] and now i'm going through this situation
[49:45] where right before the end of the school
[49:47] year
[49:48] my girl of my dreams broke up with me
[49:51] and the air force rejected me from the
[49:53] air force academy
[49:55] and so i was like oh my all my dreams
[49:57] were gone i was just shattered
[49:59] and
[50:01] i had no plan i had no backup plan as
[50:03] far as you because i was like this is
[50:05] what's going to happen with my life
[50:07] and i had no idea what i was going to do
[50:09] so i just chose the first thing i could
[50:11] think of it was i was like well after
[50:13] high school you go to college so i'll go
[50:15] to bowling green state university
[50:17] because i knew a couple people a couple
[50:19] friends from high school that didn't go
[50:20] to my church but that was they were my
[50:22] closest friends outside of
[50:24] really the church there
[50:26] that i would uh was with and it was
[50:28] actually two brothers
[50:30] one was older than me by a grade and one
[50:32] was younger than me by a grade and we
[50:33] all got along really well and always
[50:35] hung out a lot
[50:36] and i was like well i'll just go to i'll
[50:37] go to
[50:38] college there because they gave me kind
[50:40] of a little mini scholarship like like a
[50:43] couple like 1500 or something and i was
[50:46] just so depressed i didn't care i really
[50:48] didn't i was just i'm going to go to
[50:49] college and i guess i'm just going to go
[50:51] all my dreams were shattered and i
[50:53] always remember right before like during
[50:55] the summer
[50:56] i was fellowshipping with brother cam
[50:59] you know we hang out all the time and
[51:00] brother simon hadn't been there anymore
[51:02] i'd see him every once in a while but i
[51:04] i just
[51:05] didn't think anything of it i remember
[51:07] being in brother cam's
[51:08] red f-150 that if you know over the cam
[51:10] you know at the time it was still
[51:12] looking pretty good it's not not so good
[51:14] anymore but it was looking pretty good
[51:15] at the time and i remember
[51:17] brother cam was dropping me off at my
[51:19] house
[51:20] and i remember asking him i said i said
[51:23] where is simon
[51:24] i just remember asking him that evening
[51:26] and i was like where where
[51:30] forever and he just looked at me says oh
[51:32] you know he uh yeah he's in some cult
[51:34] now and he believes he he believes in
[51:36] some creature about you know eve and the
[51:38] serpent and all these things and
[51:40] i didn't think anything of it i didn't
[51:42] know and i remember looking at him and i
[51:44] just remember kind of shrugging my
[51:45] shoulder said oh well i just said oh
[51:47] well i said i you know i hope like i
[51:50] hope things get better for him you know
[51:52] i i didn't know
[51:53] you know i didn't know i knew only what
[51:54] i knew you know and brother cam at the
[51:56] same time also knew only what he knew
[51:59] and uh
[52:00] and around and i know that was the time
[52:02] that brother jesse you know uh brother
[52:03] simon and brother jesse had come to the
[52:05] revealed word of this hour and the lord
[52:07] had begun revealing it and
[52:09] and so i went off i worked that summer
[52:11] at worthington industries worthington
[52:13] steel actually worked i got a summer job
[52:15] there and worked all summer
[52:17] and then i went off to college to
[52:18] bowling green which obviously wasn't
[52:20] that far away but i lived in the dorms
[52:21] there with uh with the older brother of
[52:23] the two friends that i had i lived with
[52:25] him because he had already been going
[52:26] there
[52:27] and uh
[52:28] oh my i was just i was in such a
[52:30] depressed state i just didn't i didn't
[52:32] care about
[52:34] uh
[52:34] school i didn't care about what i was
[52:36] doing because all my dreams were gone i
[52:38] was brokenhearted from that girl and and
[52:41] broken-hearted from my my dream of being
[52:43] a fighter pilot being shattered and i
[52:45] was just completely
[52:47] just wandering i was just aimless you
[52:49] know i went to the classes
[52:51] and uh and everything and
[52:54] i uh
[52:57] so
[52:58] i just
[52:59] you know wasn't really going to church
[53:00] either because i just kind of that we
[53:02] didn't have a church that i knew of
[53:04] right there and i just i just kind of
[53:05] stayed in the dorm
[53:07] played video games went to classes
[53:10] played some basketball when i'd go to
[53:11] the rec center and that was about it and
[53:14] i was i really and i say that because
[53:16] the lord has a way of breaking you
[53:18] and he has a way of getting you into
[53:20] position to receive
[53:22] what you need to receive
[53:24] he has a way of getting you to the spot
[53:26] where you can receive it and some of us
[53:28] it requires being more broken than
[53:30] others because of the natures that we
[53:32] have or the conditions that we are in
[53:34] but he knows how to do it
[53:36] and i give glory to god for all that i i
[53:38] just i have glory in my tribulations
[53:40] i'll glory in the things that i've gone
[53:41] through and i'm not ashamed of the
[53:43] gospel of christ and the things that
[53:45] he's done
[53:46] you know even with all of my failures
[53:48] and i've failed so many times
[53:50] but i remember just being so down and
[53:52] depressed and sad
[53:54] and this would have been in uh september
[53:57] either late september early october of
[53:59] 2002
[54:01] and i remember being in the dorm
[54:03] and i remember sitting there one night
[54:05] and just sitting there and
[54:07] and again you know i i give glory to the
[54:08] lord through all of this because you
[54:10] know many people in those situations
[54:13] might go out and party go out and drink
[54:15] and and just go out and do all kinds of
[54:17] things because
[54:19] they're they more social but i was so
[54:20] awkward
[54:21] and i knew enough about god to knew it
[54:23] was wrong
[54:25] that he kept me from those things even
[54:26] if i had wanted to do him i'd be so
[54:28] socially awkward i couldn't bring myself
[54:29] to go to a party yeah i never went to
[54:31] any amazingly and i and give glory to
[54:34] god all through high school i never went
[54:35] to a prom i never went to a homecoming
[54:38] because i just was too awkward and doing
[54:41] it and then the girlfriend that i had i
[54:42] was so ex i remember being so excited
[54:45] because i was going to go to my senior
[54:46] prom with the girl of my dreams and then
[54:49] she broke up with me a few weeks before
[54:50] that so the lord it just i give glory to
[54:54] god because it's all him and and uh
[54:58] but anyway and if you know and and i
[55:00] don't say that to condemn anybody
[55:01] because if you had done those things you
[55:03] know praise the lord for forgiveness and
[55:05] for his blood you know i just i say it
[55:08] for me because you know the lord made me
[55:10] in a way and you you start to realize
[55:12] the weaknesses of your flesh and i know
[55:15] in myself that in many ways i have an
[55:17] addictive personality
[55:19] that in my flesh i've have to struggle
[55:22] with because i've seen it
[55:24] and this is maybe jumping forward in
[55:25] time but i've seen it even in something
[55:27] as simple as food
[55:28] where i if there's something that i like
[55:30] i could eat it because there was a time
[55:31] brothers and sisters like just four or
[55:33] five years ago i was almost 300 pounds
[55:35] because i was just so addicted to food
[55:38] and i would just eat and eat and if any
[55:40] time i would get down if i would get sad
[55:42] or down that became my comfort blanket
[55:44] and i would go and eat i would go eat 25
[55:47] 30 worth of wendy's or mcdonald's at a
[55:49] time and just pound it down and and and
[55:54] i only say that to give glory to god
[55:55] because he helped me to lose weight and
[55:56] get healthier and and all those things
[55:58] and and but i i the lord will reveal to
[56:01] you you know maybe the thorn in your
[56:03] flesh are the weaknesses that you have
[56:04] because each one of us you think about
[56:06] the fourth 6 000 years of
[56:10] breeding
[56:12] that's gone in through the wickedness of
[56:14] the flesh that's gone in and all the
[56:15] traits that are handed down through
[56:17] generations that you have to struggle
[56:18] with that's in this flesh
[56:21] and lord knows by the holy ghost we can
[56:23] overcome this flesh but but the flesh is
[56:25] always with you and struggling against
[56:27] it so you have to know your enemy
[56:29] know your enemy you know many times we
[56:31] like to we like to just oh it's just
[56:33] nothing it's just nothing it's just that
[56:34] no know know the weaknesses that the
[56:38] that are in your life and the things
[56:39] that you have to fortify brother brandon
[56:41] even said that there's those that punch
[56:43] that the devil has that you need to
[56:45] fortify those positions and i know by
[56:47] the grace of god he spared me because i
[56:49] believe if he would have let me get into
[56:51] drugs or drinking or all these some of
[56:53] these different things i'd probably be
[56:54] dead already
[56:56] because i just know knowing the weakness
[56:58] of my flesh i would have been the person
[57:00] that probably would have killed himself
[57:01] by alcohol poisoning just because i like
[57:03] the taste of something i might have
[57:04] downed like five bottles of alcohol and
[57:06] died
[57:07] you know and i glory i say glory to god
[57:09] for sparing me from so much so much
[57:13] and and you know and that's why we give
[57:16] these testimonies because my testimony
[57:18] doesn't fit the circumstances for
[57:19] everybody and god i believe has pulled
[57:21] ones out of every single walk of life
[57:24] every circumstance because when we get
[57:26] there at the white throne because the
[57:27] saints shall judge the earth
[57:29] and when when someone would come up at
[57:30] the white throne and would say well i
[57:32] had this problem and i had that problem
[57:34] god will be able to point to brother
[57:35] jesse and say come here jesse smith and
[57:38] you'd be able to testify yes you had
[57:40] that problem but i can testify that the
[57:42] blood of jesus christ was able to
[57:44] overcome your problem so you don't have
[57:46] an excuse see and god will have ones
[57:48] that had every problem every
[57:50] circumstance every issue god will have
[57:52] one i believe that out of every one of
[57:54] those circumstances because there won't
[57:55] be one with an excuse because the blood
[57:57] of jesus christ is not slack to save
[58:01] so
[58:02] i i just give glory to the lord in those
[58:04] things and so anyway i was so down and
[58:07] sad and and things in college
[58:09] and i remember the one night
[58:11] and uh
[58:12] sitting there in the dorm and just
[58:14] thinking man
[58:15] you know i haven't
[58:17] i haven't talked to brother cam i
[58:18] haven't talked to can in a while i've
[58:19] been you know i've been in college for
[58:21] like a month a month and a half i hadn't
[58:23] talked to cam in a while because i just
[58:25] been in my own little shell just kind of
[58:26] really sad and and down i was like well
[58:29] i'll just give him a call you know i
[58:31] haven't talked to him in a while and
[58:33] and this was this was believe it or not
[58:35] this was before the age of cell phones
[58:38] being really widely available you know
[58:40] so i had we had the landline in the dorm
[58:42] i didn't have a cell phone at the time
[58:44] and uh and i think maybe brother cam cam
[58:47] had at the time maybe just the original
[58:49] flip phone
[58:50] you know and everything and
[58:52] and i remember i called him
[58:54] and i'll never forget
[58:55] the word i said hey cam how's it going
[58:57] man and he's like he's like dude you'll
[59:00] never believe i just got re-baptized in
[59:02] the name of jesus christ
[59:05] and and and the testimony on that that
[59:07] you it was all god because
[59:10] if you know anything and i don't know if
[59:11] brother cam's ever given his testimony
[59:13] or anything but uh just uh like a slight
[59:16] aside on that a very just a slight aside
[59:18] on that but brother cam you know when
[59:20] brother jesse and brother simon came to
[59:22] the knowledge of this word brother cam
[59:24] fought it
[59:25] he fought it solid for a year
[59:27] and and i mean like and when i mean
[59:29] fight i mean almost physically too in
[59:31] some points you know
[59:32] and it but that's how brothers are even
[59:34] in the natural brothers in the natural
[59:36] could get that way with each other you
[59:37] know i didn't have brothers but i have
[59:39] two sisters and i know even us would
[59:41] fight physically sometimes because
[59:42] that's just you that's your blood you
[59:43] know that's your kin yes they say so
[59:45] things are a little bit different
[59:46] sometimes you you don't hold back the
[59:48] punches physically even literally you
[59:50] know when you're with family but
[59:52] uh i you know he had fought it for a
[59:54] year and then when the lord brought that
[59:56] revelation and turned him around in an
[59:57] instant he had been going and trying to
[1:00:00] to go back all the people that he had
[1:00:02] chased away
[1:00:04] he had been going and trying to make it
[1:00:05] right and telling him hey this is the
[1:00:06] truth this is the truth this is the
[1:00:08] truth and that the the glor the grace of
[1:00:11] god for me
[1:00:12] that he had been trying to get in touch
[1:00:14] with me even though i didn't know much
[1:00:16] he had never said much to me about it
[1:00:17] because he had told me what i told you
[1:00:19] like oh he's just involved in this
[1:00:21] little thing and that was all he ever
[1:00:22] said
[1:00:23] but he had been trying to get a hold of
[1:00:24] me but he didn't have my phone number at
[1:00:26] the at the college
[1:00:28] and nobody knew it and he's and and he
[1:00:31] was trying to he had been trying to get
[1:00:32] in touch with me and god put it on my
[1:00:33] heart anointed me to call him at that
[1:00:36] season for that time
[1:00:38] and so i say glory to god he works on
[1:00:40] both ends
[1:00:41] he's able to bring those two together
[1:00:44] just when you you know you're not even
[1:00:45] looking and i wasn't looking for
[1:00:46] anything
[1:00:47] but so i you know he says this and i'm
[1:00:50] you know my interest is kind of pizza
[1:00:52] i'm like what do you mean i didn't you
[1:00:53] know i was like well he's like he's like
[1:00:55] brother he's like everything that simon
[1:00:58] was talking about that is the truth it
[1:01:00] is the word of god it is the truth and
[1:01:02] everything i was like oh okay and and uh
[1:01:04] you know the lord had been moving you
[1:01:06] know during this period of about i'd say
[1:01:08] two solid years two and a half solid
[1:01:11] years really beginning with uh and
[1:01:14] really even be
[1:01:16] on that maybe say three solid years
[1:01:18] beginning with brother craig booer and
[1:01:20] and different ones from there that kind
[1:01:21] of that chain reaction of how it
[1:01:22] extended out and over to brother simon
[1:01:24] and brother jesse and then to brother
[1:01:26] cam and
[1:01:27] and then to me and and whatnot and so
[1:01:31] he says yeah me and in this guy i didn't
[1:01:33] know him uh scott overmeyer are gonna be
[1:01:35] we're coming down because uh betsy
[1:01:38] brother jesse's sister was also going to
[1:01:39] bowling green as uh at the time and she
[1:01:42] was across on the other side of campus
[1:01:44] and um
[1:01:46] and he's like he's like we're coming
[1:01:47] down and we're going to give a bible
[1:01:48] study to betsy if you want to come you
[1:01:50] can and i was like all right i'll be
[1:01:52] there and so i we went i went there
[1:01:54] showed up walked in there and we were in
[1:01:56] uh in betsy's dorm room and and uh cam
[1:01:59] and and brother cam and scott were there
[1:02:01] and they didn't know anything
[1:02:03] they didn't know anything they gave they
[1:02:05] gave a bible study on on the baptism in
[1:02:07] the name of jesus christ and the serpent
[1:02:09] see and i think they used a total
[1:02:11] between the two of them like four or
[1:02:13] five scriptures
[1:02:14] it was like just a couple scriptures for
[1:02:16] each one but i tell you what brothers
[1:02:18] and sisters when the word when that
[1:02:19] light strikes the seed
[1:02:21] you can't you cannot help it it when
[1:02:24] it's the season for that seed to spring
[1:02:26] to life all the devil's in hell it
[1:02:28] doesn't matter you see you think your
[1:02:30] testimony doesn't mean anything because
[1:02:32] you think you can't say it in the right
[1:02:34] way or you you don't have all the
[1:02:36] intellectual knowledge you just share
[1:02:39] christ with them you just share the
[1:02:41] truth with them and if they're ordained
[1:02:43] to life and all the devils in hell that
[1:02:45] will pierce through all the all the
[1:02:47] layers of muck and grime just like that
[1:02:49] lily that's buried underneath the that
[1:02:51] underneath all the water underneath all
[1:02:53] the muck and grime but that light can
[1:02:55] penetrate down to that seed and make it
[1:02:57] grow
[1:02:58] because i tell you what
[1:03:00] they share just a few scriptures because
[1:03:02] they didn't they know nothing brother
[1:03:04] cam had just been baptized like right
[1:03:06] before or maybe he he had just been
[1:03:08] baptized right before that maybe a
[1:03:09] couple days before he didn't have time
[1:03:11] to know anything
[1:03:12] but he was given what he had
[1:03:14] and he that that spirit that was on him
[1:03:16] to testify of it and and and when that
[1:03:19] hit me i couldn't help but say my it's
[1:03:22] like my eyes were opened it's like wow
[1:03:24] this is this is true baptism in the name
[1:03:26] of the lord jesus christ
[1:03:28] something as simple as that to see what
[1:03:30] you've never seen before the lord could
[1:03:32] just open your eyes the scales fall off
[1:03:34] your eyes as it were praise the lord and
[1:03:37] so i went from there rejoicing
[1:03:40] and i went and and uh you know over the
[1:03:43] we went to uh i think that was sometime
[1:03:44] during the week and then we went to a
[1:03:46] bible study uh that they were having up
[1:03:48] there in florida ohio that uh brother
[1:03:50] craig booer was doing at the time and
[1:03:52] they would do the bibles what they would
[1:03:54] do is do the bible studies on the on the
[1:03:55] fri on the saturdays and then they would
[1:03:57] go down to lima on sundays for the
[1:04:00] church services
[1:04:01] and so i went up there
[1:04:03] and uh you know just had reason having
[1:04:05] these things in my mind and i'll be
[1:04:06] honest you know even though i've been in
[1:04:08] the church for years and years i really
[1:04:10] didn't know much you know i i didn't
[1:04:12] know much and i think you'd probably
[1:04:13] testify to that too i mean you could be
[1:04:14] in the church for years and years they
[1:04:16] don't
[1:04:16] i hate to you know it sounds like you're
[1:04:18] just maybe making fun or poking at
[1:04:20] something but the truth of the matter is
[1:04:22] brothers and sisters those denominations
[1:04:24] they can't teach you anything because
[1:04:26] they have nothing to give
[1:04:28] there's no life to partake of of there
[1:04:30] because it's dead it is complete god has
[1:04:32] left those moves
[1:04:34] you know and and god can work through
[1:04:36] that to an extent
[1:04:38] but in order to receive everything that
[1:04:40] he has we've got to come up higher you
[1:04:42] know and
[1:04:43] and so even for all those years you know
[1:04:44] i knew certain things here and there but
[1:04:46] i didn't really know anything and
[1:04:48] and i to to the to the fact of the
[1:04:50] matter is i had never even been baptized
[1:04:52] in the church
[1:04:53] at assembly of god i was never baptized
[1:04:55] in the name of father son holy ghost
[1:04:57] and uh and
[1:04:59] and so
[1:05:00] i remember i go to the to the bible
[1:05:02] study there and i remember sitting there
[1:05:03] before the before the bible study just
[1:05:06] sitting in there kind of reading my
[1:05:07] bible
[1:05:08] and uh
[1:05:10] i i don't have a lot of what you call
[1:05:12] supernatural experiences in the in like
[1:05:14] what we like that per that manifest in
[1:05:16] the natural but i remember sitting in
[1:05:18] there
[1:05:19] and uh just sitting there reading my
[1:05:20] bible kind of bent over you know on a
[1:05:22] chair how you'd be kind of bent over
[1:05:23] reading your bible and i remember a
[1:05:25] voice in my right ear
[1:05:27] so real that i felt the air on my ear
[1:05:29] whisper my name and literally just said
[1:05:31] randy
[1:05:33] just like that like audible i felt air
[1:05:35] on my ear
[1:05:37] and i remember i turned i heard that and
[1:05:39] i turned around and you know uh brother
[1:05:41] brooks's son jojo when he would have
[1:05:43] been really young there at the time he
[1:05:44] was sitting there was nobody behind me
[1:05:47] number one nobody there really knew me
[1:05:49] number two there was nobody behind me
[1:05:51] and i looked i remember turning around
[1:05:52] and looking and seeing jojo brother
[1:05:55] joseph one of brother isaiah brooks's
[1:05:57] young children he was really young he
[1:05:58] looked at me like what are you looking
[1:05:59] at you know and i remember
[1:06:02] what is this you know
[1:06:03] and uh i really believe that was just
[1:06:05] the lord calling me even audibly calling
[1:06:07] me and confirming
[1:06:09] and uh
[1:06:10] and
[1:06:11] and so we went through the uh had the
[1:06:13] service i don't even remember the
[1:06:14] service in particularly but i remember
[1:06:17] just being convinced after the service
[1:06:19] just like lord you know after that
[1:06:20] experiences like lord i gotta get
[1:06:21] baptized i gotta do this you know and
[1:06:24] i'm because i remember hearing if you
[1:06:25] know you're baptized you shall receive
[1:06:26] the gift of the holy ghost and i was
[1:06:28] like lord that's what i want i want to
[1:06:29] make a rapture you know i started
[1:06:31] hearing these things about how do you
[1:06:32] make a rapture you have to receive the
[1:06:34] holy ghost you know how do you receive
[1:06:36] the holy ghost repent and be baptized in
[1:06:38] the name of jesus christ for the
[1:06:39] remission of sins you shall receive the
[1:06:41] gifts of the holy and i remember just
[1:06:42] thinking lord okay this is what i got to
[1:06:44] do
[1:06:45] and uh and so i was like lord i'm gonna
[1:06:47] get baptized after the service there and
[1:06:50] and and after the service you know and
[1:06:52] you know as soon as you start to make
[1:06:54] these decisions the devil's right there
[1:06:55] to resist
[1:06:56] he is right there to resist you at every
[1:06:58] turn and i think about brother mj i
[1:07:00] heard i heard how you had a flat tire on
[1:07:02] the way here was it was it was it you
[1:07:04] had a flat tire or somebody or someone
[1:07:08] yeah and you see you know you see how
[1:07:10] the devil as soon as you start to make a
[1:07:12] move for god how how when you start to
[1:07:14] make a move towards truth that devil is
[1:07:16] going to resist you and you know there's
[1:07:18] going to be people that are going to sit
[1:07:19] there and say oh it's the other way
[1:07:21] god's trying to keep you from something
[1:07:22] i tell you what you you continue with
[1:07:25] the lord and you'll see what god will do
[1:07:27] because he'll vindicate it he will
[1:07:29] vindicate it to be the truth he'll
[1:07:30] vindicate it in this word he will show
[1:07:32] you truth
[1:07:34] he'll show you truth on the inward parts
[1:07:35] i tell you what he will show you he will
[1:07:38] expose the devil
[1:07:40] and i remember that's when the trials
[1:07:41] really started to begin
[1:07:43] the mental battles because
[1:07:45] right after that service
[1:07:46] you know and again i don't say any of
[1:07:49] these things to to lay anything on
[1:07:52] someone or make make someone out to be a
[1:07:54] bad person or or any of those things
[1:07:56] because i believe there's grace for all
[1:07:58] but everybody has their part to play in
[1:08:00] their times and seasons but i remember
[1:08:03] you know looking back on it now the
[1:08:04] whole time i had been
[1:08:06] at the college there i had never been
[1:08:08] reached out to by anybody from the
[1:08:10] church
[1:08:11] i had never been reached out to anybody
[1:08:13] but i remember as soon as i went to that
[1:08:15] service right after the service i
[1:08:17] received a call from our pastor's wife
[1:08:20] and she came in when she was telling me
[1:08:22] this is a this is a bad thing don't get
[1:08:24] baptized that way don't do this this is
[1:08:26] a this is a this is a cult that you're
[1:08:28] getting involved in this is a thing this
[1:08:30] isn't of god and all these things and i
[1:08:31] remember and i remember thinking by the
[1:08:33] grace of god and i did and i tell you i
[1:08:36] tell you the grace of god to to a to a
[1:08:38] believer to a son or daughter a god
[1:08:40] because i didn't know
[1:08:41] even though i'd been in the church i
[1:08:44] really didn't have a true knowledge
[1:08:45] because you can't have a true knowledge
[1:08:46] of god without the holy ghost
[1:08:48] because you can't to because when the
[1:08:50] scripture says he says depart from ye
[1:08:52] that work iniquity i never knew you when
[1:08:54] you understand that knowing it goes
[1:08:56] beyond it's not a carnal knowing
[1:08:59] it's not an intellectual knowing but
[1:09:00] it's a knowledge as of between a husband
[1:09:02] and a wife it's a knowledge of nature
[1:09:05] it's a knowledge of the true nature of
[1:09:08] god and you cannot know the nature of
[1:09:11] god without receiving the nature of god
[1:09:15] because what is the who knows the mind
[1:09:17] of god except the mind of god the spirit
[1:09:19] of god you cannot know those things and
[1:09:21] i say it had to be the grace of god
[1:09:23] because i even look back on it now to
[1:09:25] even have the insight to think this
[1:09:27] thought that god gave me
[1:09:29] that it had to be the holy ghost leading
[1:09:31] me because i wouldn't have known but i
[1:09:33] remember hanging up from that phone call
[1:09:36] and thinking if if people are fighting
[1:09:39] it this much then it has to be the truth
[1:09:42] and and
[1:09:43] and don't get me wrong i fought my
[1:09:44] battles i fought a lot of mind battles
[1:09:46] even after that and i fought and fought
[1:09:48] and fought and struggled because you
[1:09:49] wrestle with your salvation and you
[1:09:51] wrestle with those things and i thought
[1:09:53] and i remember and i remember hanging up
[1:09:55] that phone after she did that and i said
[1:09:57] i said i got to get baptized because the
[1:09:59] lord dropped that in my heart and said
[1:10:01] you know how how if they're fighting it
[1:10:03] this hard
[1:10:05] and but they're going they they're you
[1:10:07] know i'm they're trying to push me
[1:10:08] deeper into the word
[1:10:10] but it's being fought this hard
[1:10:12] it's got to be true
[1:10:14] you know and i and i so by the grace of
[1:10:17] god
[1:10:18] uh again time frames i don't know but
[1:10:20] within the next day or so uh we went and
[1:10:23] i was baptized in that little river that
[1:10:24] was over by florida ohio by brother
[1:10:26] isaiah and uh and baptized in the name
[1:10:29] of the lord jesus christ and
[1:10:31] and and from there you know you start to
[1:10:33] fight battles you know the battle
[1:10:35] doesn't begin until you really start to
[1:10:37] try to serve the lord according to the
[1:10:38] truth
[1:10:39] and fought a lot of battles mentally i'm
[1:10:42] you know uh at college there and was
[1:10:44] still really even then fighting with
[1:10:46] depression and uh you pray for me
[1:10:48] because that's uh that's the thing that
[1:10:49] i've had to fight i've had to fight that
[1:10:51] you know and i know i'm in good company
[1:10:52] because i know even elijah fought that i
[1:10:55] know even even jonah fought that you
[1:10:57] know after after he preached great
[1:10:58] sermons and all of nineveh had repented
[1:11:01] even so much that they said they put
[1:11:02] sackcloth on the animals
[1:11:04] and there goes there goes jonah even
[1:11:06] afterwards so depressed he said lord
[1:11:08] just let me die
[1:11:09] so i said lord i'm in good company but
[1:11:11] you just pray for me because it's
[1:11:12] something you know i've had to fight all
[1:11:14] my life really
[1:11:17] and uh you know i i don't mind you know
[1:11:18] i i people may say oh you're showing
[1:11:20] weakness and things but you know what i
[1:11:22] don't even i have why do i why should i
[1:11:24] have pride
[1:11:25] you know why why should i have i have
[1:11:27] nothing to have pride in
[1:11:29] the same blood that saves me is the same
[1:11:31] blood that saved you it's the same
[1:11:32] christ that died for you as the same one
[1:11:34] that died for me
[1:11:36] and you know i want
[1:11:38] i want all my sins to go before me when
[1:11:40] i come to the jordan if i tarry that
[1:11:42] long i believe by the grace of god he's
[1:11:44] giving me a revelation i'm destined for
[1:11:45] a rapture i'm destined for a body change
[1:11:47] but if i were if i were to go before
[1:11:50] that time and pass i want my sins to go
[1:11:52] before me i have no problem saying you
[1:11:54] pray for me on certain things that i
[1:11:56] maybe struggle with or something i i
[1:11:57] want to be open and transparent before
[1:11:59] you
[1:12:00] you know it's and there's a fine line to
[1:12:02] be there because we don't we don't just
[1:12:04] go delve into the things oh this is what
[1:12:06] i and try to go into detail we don't
[1:12:07] give glory to the devil that way you
[1:12:09] know there's a very fine line we confess
[1:12:10] our faults i don't want to confess my
[1:12:12] sins to you those are for god but i'll
[1:12:14] confess my faults to you and you pray
[1:12:17] for me i'll pray for you
[1:12:18] and you know if we could have true
[1:12:20] divine holy ghost love in our hearts we
[1:12:23] could truly confess our faults and have
[1:12:24] love enough one for another not to
[1:12:26] condemn a brother or sister but to pray
[1:12:28] really pray one for another so i believe
[1:12:31] i believe in that and i know brother
[1:12:32] jesse believes in that because
[1:12:34] we're here to be honest and sincere you
[1:12:36] know praise the lord for his deliverance
[1:12:38] that he's given me from depression and
[1:12:40] from from fighting with the addictions
[1:12:42] to food and different things i've had to
[1:12:43] fight with i give glory to god in that
[1:12:45] because that's a testimony that someone
[1:12:47] else might hear and take heart
[1:12:49] and say if he could do it for him he
[1:12:51] could do it for me
[1:12:52] you know and i'm not perfect you know as
[1:12:55] paul had said in the he said i don't say
[1:12:57] these things as though i've already
[1:12:58] attained he said but this one thing i do
[1:13:00] that i press towards the mark of the
[1:13:01] high calling in christ jesus so you pray
[1:13:04] for me i'll pray for you so you know we
[1:13:06] i you know and i struggled you know i
[1:13:09] served the lord we we came in you know
[1:13:11] go started going to brother isaiah
[1:13:12] brooks's church and and even i remember
[1:13:14] having fellowship with brother jesse
[1:13:16] there coming over to akron and
[1:13:17] fellowshipping and things at that time
[1:13:19] and just you know the lord you didn't
[1:13:22] see what you had
[1:13:23] until hindsight goes by and you see the
[1:13:25] move that god did
[1:13:27] you know when you're in when you're in
[1:13:28] it when you're swept up in it you know
[1:13:30] sister wendy coming along in those times
[1:13:32] and different ones coming along and
[1:13:35] you know you thank the lord for his
[1:13:37] mercy and grace and keeping us from so
[1:13:39] much and so much of the different you
[1:13:41] know even we learn different politics
[1:13:43] and different things that goes on and he
[1:13:45] spared us
[1:13:46] from so much and allowed us just to grow
[1:13:48] sheltered he truly you know i believe
[1:13:50] the devil probably almost looked at all
[1:13:52] of us probably like jobs and said how
[1:13:54] can i do anything with him because he
[1:13:55] got a hedge of protection around him you
[1:13:57] know and he truly had a hedge about us
[1:14:00] you know and you know we have our
[1:14:01] struggles and our battles and you look
[1:14:03] back and see how immature and foolish
[1:14:05] you were in certain things but that's
[1:14:07] what maturing's all about it's because
[1:14:09] becoming above those things and
[1:14:10] overcoming so
[1:14:12] um
[1:14:13] you know but i i don't want to keep us
[1:14:15] too much longer but i just want to go
[1:14:17] through and and maybe just even since i
[1:14:19] came to the knowledge of this truth you
[1:14:21] know just to just to show
[1:14:23] you know just because you come to the
[1:14:24] knowledge of it doesn't mean that you're
[1:14:26] not going to go through struggles and
[1:14:28] trials
[1:14:28] doesn't mean that you might not even
[1:14:30] backslide because i backslid
[1:14:32] you know i served the lord there uh you
[1:14:34] know by the grace of god as best i could
[1:14:36] you know and the lord really blessed and
[1:14:39] we were rejoicing in the holy ghost and
[1:14:41] and the knowledge of the truth and
[1:14:43] serving him as best as we could and
[1:14:45] you know in uh in the year in 2007
[1:14:49] was a time uh you know the lord had
[1:14:51] called
[1:14:52] brother isaiah to to go to des moines
[1:14:54] iowa to leave the church there in lima
[1:14:56] and go to des moines
[1:14:58] and uh during that time too in the in
[1:15:00] the year prior to that i had been uh
[1:15:02] starting to kind of uh court a sister
[1:15:05] from the church here actually at brother
[1:15:07] jesse's
[1:15:08] and uh and
[1:15:10] i think deep down i really believe deep
[1:15:12] down i knew that it wasn't supposed to
[1:15:14] be that way because i had been
[1:15:16] struggling with other certain things
[1:15:17] about it
[1:15:18] and even looking back on it now may not
[1:15:20] have been the things that i i needed to
[1:15:22] struggle with but uh you know i had my
[1:15:25] own ideas on certain things and i had my
[1:15:27] own thoughts and
[1:15:29] and things and and
[1:15:31] you know
[1:15:32] when you're a child
[1:15:34] you know paul said i speak as a child i
[1:15:36] thought as a child i acted as a child
[1:15:38] you know
[1:15:39] and
[1:15:40] and we even spoke on this a little bit
[1:15:41] yesterday but what's one of those things
[1:15:43] as a child sometimes when the lord says
[1:15:44] no you throw a little bit of a fit
[1:15:47] and uh
[1:15:48] you know i
[1:15:49] been
[1:15:50] the sis this uh sister at the time i've
[1:15:52] been talking to the lord had kinda it's
[1:15:54] like no i i don't think it's it's the
[1:15:56] thing to do and and then i kind of
[1:15:59] started to fight that depression thing
[1:16:00] again and
[1:16:01] and uh
[1:16:03] i did feel
[1:16:05] like the lord had called me at the time
[1:16:07] when brother isaiah had moved over to
[1:16:09] des moines i kind of felt a pull like i
[1:16:11] was supposed to go help him because he
[1:16:13] didn't really have anybody out there to
[1:16:14] help
[1:16:15] and i
[1:16:16] prayed about it and at that time too i
[1:16:19] just kind of felt like i needed a change
[1:16:21] in my life and you know i don't know
[1:16:24] looking back i don't know if that was
[1:16:25] necessarily
[1:16:27] god or not i i can be perfectly honest
[1:16:29] and say i don't know what was in that i
[1:16:32] felt you know i felt you know i've been
[1:16:33] trying to find work in different jobs
[1:16:35] i'd worked all kinds of different jobs
[1:16:37] and at the time i was working uh iron
[1:16:40] working i was an iron worker
[1:16:42] and a lot of the brothers now are still
[1:16:43] iron workers you know brother dave and
[1:16:45] brother bart over at brother cam's
[1:16:46] church they're still iron workers you
[1:16:48] know and i had gotten in i was one of
[1:16:50] the first ones to get into that you know
[1:16:52] at the time and and been working that
[1:16:54] job and my body was breaking down really
[1:16:56] fast i had carpal tunnel in both my
[1:16:58] hands i was miserable at the job i
[1:17:00] enjoyed the work itself but it made me
[1:17:03] physically miserable because i would
[1:17:04] wake up and my hands would be clenched
[1:17:06] shut they were so tight and i couldn't
[1:17:08] like i would sleep and my arms would go
[1:17:10] numb all the time and and i was just i
[1:17:12] was such in a place i was like lord what
[1:17:14] am i supposed to do i i i'm trying to
[1:17:16] find a job and i don't know where to go
[1:17:18] or what to do
[1:17:20] and uh and then brother brother isaiah
[1:17:22] brother brooks is getting ready to leave
[1:17:24] and i'm like lord what do i do i just
[1:17:25] don't know and
[1:17:27] and then i was like well maybe it's time
[1:17:28] to move on to something else and maybe
[1:17:30] you should go over and like move out to
[1:17:32] iowa with brother brother brooks and
[1:17:34] help out there and do something new and
[1:17:36] and uh and then i had this other poll
[1:17:39] from my dad because at the time my
[1:17:40] parents were divorced and my dad had
[1:17:42] moved out to denver colorado
[1:17:45] and he kind of put a pull on me too he
[1:17:47] said if you want you can come live with
[1:17:48] me you don't have to pay for nothing you
[1:17:49] don't need anything you know i have
[1:17:51] everything for you you know and he
[1:17:52] didn't believe the the truth that we
[1:17:54] believe you know i had witnessed to him
[1:17:56] a little bit and i remember
[1:17:58] witnessing to him and by his by god's
[1:18:00] grace he was able to recognize enough
[1:18:02] that he recognized the baptism
[1:18:04] uh because i remember specifically you
[1:18:06] know uh and you know lord i say lord
[1:18:09] forgive me for having this attitude but
[1:18:11] you know my family was always loud and
[1:18:12] boisterous and my parents would get into
[1:18:14] arguments and things and
[1:18:16] and uh
[1:18:17] uh
[1:18:18] you know my mom she's she's passed on
[1:18:20] now she passed away in 2012 but
[1:18:23] my uh i remember having an argument with
[1:18:25] them like and it was just it was a
[1:18:27] legitimate argument it wasn't it wasn't
[1:18:29] and i'd say that at all you know just
[1:18:31] confession it was an argument over the
[1:18:33] word of god and my my mom was saying
[1:18:36] this isn't right and this and that
[1:18:37] because at the time i had left college
[1:18:40] and uh
[1:18:41] and had gone back and lived with them
[1:18:42] and was working
[1:18:44] and just trying to find my way and all
[1:18:46] these different things and as far as the
[1:18:48] natural trying to find my way with work
[1:18:50] and things and had lived with them and
[1:18:52] and i remember just saying and kind of
[1:18:54] getting into it and like no this is the
[1:18:56] truth and all these things and and i
[1:18:58] remember i had kind of witnessed some of
[1:19:00] the things in the word as much as they
[1:19:02] would listen to my parents and the
[1:19:04] baptism in the name of jesus christ and
[1:19:06] i remember having that discussion and
[1:19:07] said i said and you can't say anything
[1:19:09] about this baptism because it's right in
[1:19:11] the word i remember looking at my dad
[1:19:12] and saying that right and he's like he's
[1:19:14] like yeah he's like i can't say anything
[1:19:16] against it you know and
[1:19:18] and so i pray you pray for him you know
[1:19:20] i believe i believe he'll he'll come
[1:19:22] around and you know he's actually been
[1:19:24] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:19:25] christ i just you know maybe sometimes i
[1:19:27] think maybe he hasn't fully repented of
[1:19:28] some things because i don't he doesn't
[1:19:30] have a revelation of sanctification and
[1:19:32] and certain things of that but you know
[1:19:33] i believe it you know the lord gave him
[1:19:35] enough grace to see that so that's one
[1:19:37] thing i say praise the lord for
[1:19:39] and um
[1:19:40] but anyway you know all those things and
[1:19:42] he had pulled on me and and even knowing
[1:19:45] i knew you know you know deep down in
[1:19:47] your heart what maybe is right and wrong
[1:19:49] but i had been trying to find a job in
[1:19:51] des moines to maybe i would could go
[1:19:53] over there and live and help and it
[1:19:55] didn't seem like it was going that way
[1:19:57] and so
[1:19:58] looking back at it now i chose the easy
[1:20:00] path which wasn't the right one you know
[1:20:02] and i went to where my dad was thinking
[1:20:04] that i would be able to just i would be
[1:20:06] able to overcome everything because uh
[1:20:08] you know i'm a christian and i have this
[1:20:10] truth in the holy ghost and you know
[1:20:12] thinking more of myself than maybe i
[1:20:13] ought to have at the time
[1:20:15] and not realizing that i was going to be
[1:20:17] fighting so many things and i went there
[1:20:19] and i i just be honest with you brothers
[1:20:20] and sisters i just backslid you know i i
[1:20:22] was just i just you know for a while i
[1:20:24] went to a church that was out there
[1:20:26] and uh and ministered the word with them
[1:20:29] and and the brothers were really sweet
[1:20:30] and sincere and uh
[1:20:33] and then just got to a place because of
[1:20:35] the situation that i'd had with that
[1:20:36] sister that i had been courting
[1:20:39] uh just it just that depression spirit
[1:20:41] really got me and i and i know it put me
[1:20:43] into a place
[1:20:45] of uh just real depression i stopped
[1:20:47] going to the church and
[1:20:48] and i was just i really i didn't enjoy
[1:20:50] the job i was working i was working at
[1:20:52] target
[1:20:53] it was the only job i could find i was
[1:20:54] try i tried to go back to college when i
[1:20:56] was out there with my dad living with my
[1:20:58] dad and i couldn't get into that i quit
[1:21:00] after half a semester again
[1:21:02] and um just it wasn't my heart wasn't in
[1:21:04] it
[1:21:05] and i'd go into the church and brother
[1:21:07] uriah you know brother uriah he was
[1:21:08] actually going to that church at the
[1:21:09] time and he was out there and
[1:21:11] but i was just such an in a place you
[1:21:14] know where i was just down i was really
[1:21:17] down i was in a dark place
[1:21:20] uh mentally and just really just really
[1:21:23] couldn't dig myself out of it so much so
[1:21:24] that even my dad confessed to me
[1:21:26] afterwards he said he used to just look
[1:21:28] at my look at me
[1:21:29] and he'd just say he just look at me and
[1:21:31] think like i don't know what i can do to
[1:21:33] help him because he said he could see i
[1:21:35] was just so down and no matter what he
[1:21:37] would do he couldn't get me out of it
[1:21:39] even in his way that he would and
[1:21:41] and and
[1:21:42] you know i just didn't talk to anybody
[1:21:44] for probably the space of two years
[1:21:46] at least two years i didn't talk to
[1:21:48] anybody like brother cam or simon or any
[1:21:50] of these ones i was just i was ashamed
[1:21:52] of myself i was depressed you know and
[1:21:55] even and then i give glory to god
[1:21:56] because i was even testifying in the
[1:21:58] back right before service to brother
[1:21:59] jesse there were many times i wanted to
[1:22:02] get on those dating sites and find a
[1:22:04] woman and just run off with her and do
[1:22:06] whatever and the lord made me so awkward
[1:22:08] i just couldn't do it he i couldn't do
[1:22:10] it it because and also i knew too much
[1:22:13] you know i knew too much i knew the
[1:22:15] truth of the word and and that this word
[1:22:17] was truth and the message of the hour
[1:22:19] the truth of it
[1:22:20] you know what once it's been if it's
[1:22:22] truly been revealed and if you've truly
[1:22:25] received it and you've truly been sealed
[1:22:28] away
[1:22:29] you can't get away from it
[1:22:30] it doesn't matter that's why i read the
[1:22:31] scripture in the beginning he drew with
[1:22:33] bands of love
[1:22:35] you can't once you've been latched
[1:22:37] brothers and sisters by this word once
[1:22:39] you've been once he's once he's gotten
[1:22:42] his hands on you and you've truly given
[1:22:45] it to him in your heart yes you know i
[1:22:47] believe brother brahm said a man could
[1:22:48] be totally insane yet filled with the
[1:22:50] holy ghost because it because
[1:22:52] that heart
[1:22:53] you know and that's why you know no
[1:22:55] matter what situations a person and you
[1:22:57] believe for that person because i've
[1:22:59] been there in a place where i could tell
[1:23:01] you i was i was totally insane because
[1:23:04] because i tell you i sat there and it's
[1:23:06] just confession because i i'm not
[1:23:08] ashamed of it because it was what god
[1:23:10] delivered me from brother i used to sit
[1:23:12] there and play video games for 12 to 16
[1:23:14] hours a day
[1:23:16] on my computer and just waste away my
[1:23:18] life waste away and i would be angry and
[1:23:21] upset and just depressed and i knew it
[1:23:23] was wrong but i just i at that point i
[1:23:25] had given up on myself
[1:23:27] i said lord i just i
[1:23:29] i don't care i just i'm so miserable i
[1:23:31] don't want anything to do with this i
[1:23:33] just lord i'd just rather you kill me
[1:23:34] i'd cry and ask the lord to kill me
[1:23:37] because i knew i couldn't do it myself i
[1:23:39] knew too much i knew too much to kill
[1:23:41] myself you know
[1:23:43] and and i hope this is all right brother
[1:23:45] jesse i'm just trying to be transparent
[1:23:46] you know and
[1:23:48] because i trust if someone's out there
[1:23:50] and if you listen to this little video
[1:23:52] or something god is still there for you
[1:23:55] god is able to reach down and we sing
[1:23:57] that song when he reached out his hand
[1:23:59] for me i was in the deepest depths of
[1:24:01] despair
[1:24:02] i knew the truth of this word you know i
[1:24:05] i knew that it was true and yet i'd
[1:24:07] found that i was just you know because
[1:24:09] maybe throwing my own childish fit you
[1:24:11] know didn't want to maybe submit fully
[1:24:13] to the lord in certain things here and
[1:24:15] there you know and and so
[1:24:18] uh
[1:24:19] i went through that for a couple years
[1:24:22] and
[1:24:25] i hadn't talked to anybody
[1:24:27] and
[1:24:28] just to show you how sovereign god will
[1:24:30] be when he comes and when when when he
[1:24:32] can turn a life around
[1:24:34] and how he can do it in an instant
[1:24:37] i remember i was sitting in the
[1:24:38] apartment that we lived in
[1:24:40] and the lord had started to work on me
[1:24:43] you know and he had been starting to
[1:24:44] work on me again and just started i
[1:24:46] started when he starts to do that he
[1:24:48] just starts bringing things to remember
[1:24:49] it's little by little you know it's just
[1:24:51] like remembering the former times you
[1:24:53] know i think of it almost in a way of
[1:24:55] like a samson you know and brother
[1:24:57] branham talked about how you'd be
[1:24:58] grinding in that mill that's kind of
[1:25:00] where i was i was just grinding in the
[1:25:02] mill
[1:25:03] you know and you start to reminisce on
[1:25:05] man i remember how the lord used to do
[1:25:07] this i remember how the lord you know
[1:25:10] used to do that and and and but he i t
[1:25:12] he can do it again
[1:25:14] he can do it again praise the lord
[1:25:17] and uh
[1:25:18] i remember just sitting there
[1:25:20] and i was too ashamed to talk to anybody
[1:25:24] because i was just uh
[1:25:26] i was i knew you know where i was and
[1:25:30] and and i was just ashamed of myself you
[1:25:31] know
[1:25:32] and
[1:25:33] but i remember
[1:25:35] getting on facebook
[1:25:37] i made a fake account just a fake
[1:25:39] no-name account so i could find people
[1:25:41] and kind of spy on them because i didn't
[1:25:43] want to talk to him but i just i i
[1:25:45] desired the fellowship but i was so
[1:25:47] ashamed i couldn't reach out you know
[1:25:49] the devil how he works how he was he the
[1:25:51] devil he's you look back and you're like
[1:25:53] lord i have mercy that's so silly but
[1:25:55] but you know that's how the devil works
[1:25:57] it's just the reality of the situation
[1:25:59] and i remember
[1:26:02] being being on there and and brother
[1:26:04] simon has a facebook thing and i know
[1:26:07] you know i i don't like facebook i don't
[1:26:09] like any of those things really but if
[1:26:11] the lord leads you to do it and you can
[1:26:13] do it righteously i believe it can be a
[1:26:14] tool because god uses it as a tool for
[1:26:16] me definitely 99.9 evil so if the lord
[1:26:19] better be sure you better be filled with
[1:26:21] the holy ghost and know what what's
[1:26:23] going on because there ain't nothing but
[1:26:24] wickedness on there anyway it's all evil
[1:26:26] but i remember getting on there and
[1:26:28] looking on brother simon's little thing
[1:26:29] and brother simon didn't even post very
[1:26:31] much but every once in a blue moon
[1:26:33] they'd say and i remember seeing a post
[1:26:35] they had just had a revival meeting at
[1:26:37] the church
[1:26:39] and he had made a little post that said
[1:26:40] just something as simple as like
[1:26:43] powerful meetings this weekend i just
[1:26:45] like never seen the spirit of the lord
[1:26:47] move like this or something along that
[1:26:48] lines i don't remember what it was and
[1:26:50] it's just like the lord flipped the
[1:26:51] switch
[1:26:52] and i remember the very thought that
[1:26:55] that the lord dropped in my heart was
[1:26:58] i started thinking about my life and
[1:27:00] what i was just wasting it
[1:27:02] and the lord just spoke that you're
[1:27:03] going to miss a rapture for this
[1:27:06] and right at that moment
[1:27:08] the
[1:27:09] repentance was done
[1:27:11] and i just remember just just crying out
[1:27:13] to the lord
[1:27:14] and saying oh god forgive me you know i
[1:27:16] just lord like that's he turned it
[1:27:19] around that is repentance turning it
[1:27:20] around
[1:27:22] and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:27:24] i could say he turned me around and i
[1:27:25] remember just that thought you're gonna
[1:27:27] miss a rapture
[1:27:29] for this filth
[1:27:30] for this for this this stuff
[1:27:33] that you know is wrong
[1:27:35] that you just that because because you
[1:27:38] think god's not powerful enough to
[1:27:39] overcome it and because you're ashamed
[1:27:42] you're so prideful you know shame is
[1:27:44] pride people don't realize that but
[1:27:47] shame actually comes from pride
[1:27:49] because shame is a thing when you're too
[1:27:51] prideful to admit that you're wrong but
[1:27:53] you know you're wrong
[1:27:55] but and you're not willing to admit it
[1:27:56] openly
[1:27:57] and that's why i don't want to be
[1:27:58] ashamed i don't want to be ashamed of
[1:28:00] that
[1:28:01] and so i said lord forgive me and i and
[1:28:04] and in that moment he restored
[1:28:06] he restored in a moment
[1:28:08] and and i say praise be to god for that
[1:28:11] and i remember reaching out and reaching
[1:28:13] out to brother simon in different ones
[1:28:15] and just apologizing and repenting say
[1:28:17] i'm so sorry i ignored you for this
[1:28:19] period of time and and went back to that
[1:28:21] you know and then the sovereign grace of
[1:28:23] god you know to to show
[1:28:25] how how he works and how how he does
[1:28:29] things you know i i went back
[1:28:32] you know and uh
[1:28:34] in my heart
[1:28:36] i had i felt
[1:28:38] lord
[1:28:39] i felt a pull to go to iowa to help
[1:28:41] brother brooks because that was the
[1:28:42] original poll i felt and it's you know
[1:28:44] uh you always say he he he's always
[1:28:47] right where you left him
[1:28:49] you'll find him right where you left him
[1:28:51] and i remember coming back to that point
[1:28:53] and being like lord i chose the wrong
[1:28:55] path i chose the easy one i chose the
[1:28:57] one that i thought was going to be easy
[1:28:58] because it was more certain i knew going
[1:29:01] with my dad i wasn't going to have to
[1:29:02] worry about financial things or living
[1:29:05] and all these things but going out to
[1:29:07] iowa i didn't have a job i didn't
[1:29:08] necessarily have a place to be here
[1:29:10] anything like that it was more uncertain
[1:29:12] and i remember coming back to that place
[1:29:14] and said lord i'm gonna go back to this
[1:29:15] brother the church that was there in
[1:29:17] denver and i say lord i'm gonna go and
[1:29:20] i'm gonna stay there as long as you
[1:29:22] would have me and then lord but i
[1:29:24] believe you called me to iowa but i
[1:29:26] don't know when you're going to do it
[1:29:27] but i'm going to try to be faithful to
[1:29:28] help this brother out because i'd left
[1:29:30] them it was a really small church
[1:29:32] smaller than this even maybe like 10 12
[1:29:34] people
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:36] i remember going back to the brother
[1:29:38] and and just apologized and said brother
[1:29:40] forgive me you know for just abandoning
[1:29:42] you and because i didn't talk to him i
[1:29:43] just kind of disappeared you know
[1:29:45] and uh
[1:29:46] and he's just you know he's a he's a
[1:29:48] sweet brother he's like oh that's all
[1:29:50] right brother that all is well and and
[1:29:52] and
[1:29:53] he uh
[1:29:55] but he was
[1:29:56] closed up the church
[1:29:57] he was actually leaving that weekend to
[1:30:01] go back to north carolina where he came
[1:30:02] from just to show you the sovereign the
[1:30:04] grace of god and how he he even lined it
[1:30:07] up just right so i was like lord okay i
[1:30:09] know that you've called me to go back to
[1:30:11] iowa and so i started going to this
[1:30:14] other church that was there in denver
[1:30:16] and
[1:30:17] and i don't want to really get too much
[1:30:18] into that but the details of that
[1:30:21] but i'll tell you this i knew there was
[1:30:22] something wrong with the church even
[1:30:24] though they confessed this message
[1:30:26] there was something in my spirit that
[1:30:27] knew there was something kind of wrong
[1:30:29] and uh
[1:30:31] but i couldn't put my finger on it
[1:30:32] because i didn't know a lot about the
[1:30:34] different things at the time
[1:30:36] and uh
[1:30:37] to show you how god is gracious you know
[1:30:40] i i had a job
[1:30:42] and it's almost as if the lord
[1:30:45] put me in a spot to give me a test again
[1:30:48] because it's almost like the lord you
[1:30:50] know like a school master you know
[1:30:52] because the holy ghost is your tutor and
[1:30:54] it's almost like the holy ghost came
[1:30:55] right back and said okay
[1:30:57] i gave you this test before and you
[1:30:59] chose the easy path
[1:31:00] now let's let's see can you pass the
[1:31:02] test again
[1:31:03] because i was living with my dad and and
[1:31:05] during this time
[1:31:07] as the lord was bringing me through he
[1:31:09] gave me the best job i ever had
[1:31:12] i had this job working for a company uh
[1:31:15] that i was doing mechanical work for
[1:31:17] this company and and doing things the
[1:31:19] lord had blessed me in this job gave me
[1:31:21] favor with the people there was moving
[1:31:23] me up in the job they are as a mechanic
[1:31:26] they had bought me a toolbox with all
[1:31:27] these tools spent a lot of money to buy
[1:31:30] me tools to learn how to do the job i've
[1:31:32] basically been an apprentice to some of
[1:31:34] the older guys
[1:31:35] and i remember i said lord i'm gonna i'm
[1:31:37] gonna go as long as you tell me to and
[1:31:39] when you tell me to leave i'm gonna
[1:31:40] leave
[1:31:40] and it came to a point where
[1:31:45] all those things that i couldn't put my
[1:31:47] finger on at that church the lord kind
[1:31:48] of exposed it in one service and i kind
[1:31:50] of found out they were kind of a perugia
[1:31:52] what we call perugia ministry in in
[1:31:55] certain things and i still don't even
[1:31:56] know all the details of it i just know
[1:31:58] what it was
[1:31:59] and the lord kind of expounded on that
[1:32:01] to me and really made it plain like yeah
[1:32:03] this is it and he revealed it and i said
[1:32:05] lord it's time to go
[1:32:06] and at the time i'd had a dream and and
[1:32:09] the lord kind of used it whether you
[1:32:11] know and i know the lord works in dreams
[1:32:12] and things and i remember having a dream
[1:32:15] of
[1:32:16] uh this dream and i you know brother
[1:32:17] brother stanley barnes and the lord kind
[1:32:20] of uses him sometimes and i guess like
[1:32:22] lord will show him maybe meanings of
[1:32:23] certain things like that that's what i
[1:32:25] had been told at least from brother
[1:32:26] isaiah brooke so i i felt led to tell
[1:32:29] him my dream and say maybe if the lord
[1:32:30] shows you something you can help me if
[1:32:32] the lord shows something to you and just
[1:32:35] the sovereignty of god of how he things
[1:32:37] worked
[1:32:39] he
[1:32:40] the the lord
[1:32:43] these things happen this service
[1:32:44] happened
[1:32:46] and things came to light
[1:32:48] and i was like lord have mercy my eyes
[1:32:49] were opened to what was going on i said
[1:32:51] lord i think maybe it's time for me to
[1:32:53] leave
[1:32:54] that very same after that service
[1:32:57] brother barnes brother stanley barnes
[1:32:59] called me back
[1:33:00] and he had no idea about any of this i
[1:33:02] just told him a dream that i had that
[1:33:04] seemed to have some kind of significance
[1:33:05] because there was a couple dreams that i
[1:33:07] had in this period of time after the
[1:33:09] lord restored me
[1:33:10] that
[1:33:11] that actually
[1:33:13] some things have come to pass and i
[1:33:14] believe some things are yet to come to
[1:33:16] pass and so much that i share a little
[1:33:18] piece of one with you
[1:33:19] um
[1:33:21] i had a dream that had to do with the
[1:33:23] cam but the cam's church and in the
[1:33:25] dream the church physically flipped and
[1:33:28] it was in a time that they actually were
[1:33:30] physically flipping the church to go
[1:33:32] from where they're at now when they
[1:33:33] faced one way to completely facing the
[1:33:35] other way and the lord was showing me
[1:33:36] certain things
[1:33:38] and after that service brother stanley
[1:33:40] barnes calls me back and just starts
[1:33:41] talking and he gets to a point where
[1:33:43] he's kind of talking about the dream and
[1:33:45] different things and
[1:33:46] and in part of the dream i'll just share
[1:33:48] it with you i feel like to share this
[1:33:50] little piece of it with you
[1:33:51] and it wasn't anything particular
[1:33:54] thing but i was in a dream where i was
[1:33:56] in a house and there was a bunch of
[1:33:57] women in the house all dressed in white
[1:33:59] brides
[1:34:01] all women that were dressed in white
[1:34:03] and and some things that happened there
[1:34:05] and
[1:34:06] and uh brother brother barnes had told
[1:34:08] me he said brother and i remember the
[1:34:09] way he said it too he said brother
[1:34:12] he said you'll come to a place to
[1:34:13] realize that not everybody that says
[1:34:15] they believed this message really
[1:34:16] believed this message
[1:34:18] and i and i was just lord and that was
[1:34:20] the lord right to the heart of the
[1:34:22] matter without him knowing i said
[1:34:23] brother you don't even know what just
[1:34:24] happened to me and that was a
[1:34:26] confirmation to me of lord it's time to
[1:34:28] move
[1:34:29] and the lord put me in that test with
[1:34:31] that job again because brothers and
[1:34:32] sisters i tell you i was nervous
[1:34:34] because this was the best job i ever had
[1:34:36] these people treated me so well but i
[1:34:38] remember i had told the lord i said lord
[1:34:41] if you
[1:34:42] if you will show me if this is the time
[1:34:45] i said lord i will put in my two weeks
[1:34:47] notice because that was on a sunday
[1:34:48] obviously for service i said i will put
[1:34:50] in my two weeks notice tomorrow and i
[1:34:52] will leave and he showed me and i and i
[1:34:55] went to work the next day
[1:34:57] and i took my boss aside i said i said
[1:34:59] look i appreciate everything you've ever
[1:35:01] done i said but the lord's calling me to
[1:35:03] leave and i gotta go
[1:35:05] and i said so i gotta put in my two
[1:35:06] weeks notice for you and i'm just
[1:35:08] thinking they're gonna be upset they'd
[1:35:09] invested all this money into me and he
[1:35:11] looked at me he said he said you know
[1:35:13] what he said you got to do what god
[1:35:15] tells you to do
[1:35:16] and i and and he he left he said he said
[1:35:19] and you know what he said you have my
[1:35:21] phone number he said if for some reason
[1:35:23] it doesn't work out he said you call me
[1:35:25] and he said and you'll have a job
[1:35:27] he said i said oh man it just humbled me
[1:35:30] so much of how the lord would just he
[1:35:32] just the lord is faithful
[1:35:34] to his children
[1:35:36] and so
[1:35:37] you know i you know i i'm grateful i
[1:35:40] don't know what time it is brother i
[1:35:41] don't want to keep us too long it's
[1:35:42] getting late um
[1:35:44] but
[1:35:45] he's faithful
[1:35:47] he's faithful you know and and and i'm
[1:35:49] going to share this other part of this
[1:35:50] testimony and i and i pray you take it
[1:35:53] in the way that it's meant well before i
[1:35:55] even get to that i find out later that
[1:35:58] even the how the lord will blind you to
[1:36:00] certain things for a season
[1:36:03] just to show you down the road how he
[1:36:05] how he kept you and had his hand on you
[1:36:08] because before i had even left lima
[1:36:10] sister karen sanders who many of you
[1:36:12] know
[1:36:13] had actually prophesied over me
[1:36:15] that i had totally forgotten but the
[1:36:17] lord through her had already said before
[1:36:20] this was back in 2007 before i even left
[1:36:22] that i was going to go through a dark
[1:36:24] valley in my life
[1:36:25] but that the lord would have his hand
[1:36:27] upon me and bring me out the other side
[1:36:29] and i had forgotten it and it wasn't
[1:36:31] until i'd come out on the other side
[1:36:34] that the lord
[1:36:36] had had brought that back to remembrance
[1:36:38] of different brothers and and sister
[1:36:40] karen and and different ones and to me
[1:36:42] and and i just give glory to god because
[1:36:44] he had a purpose in it you know to bring
[1:36:46] me to a deeper relationship with him to
[1:36:48] a deeper understanding and a deeper love
[1:36:50] because i love the lord more than i ever
[1:36:53] have
[1:36:54] you know more than i ever could have
[1:36:55] loved him you know and yes do i wish
[1:36:57] that maybe i made the right decision the
[1:36:59] first time absolutely i don't joy in
[1:37:02] making the wrong decisions but i glory
[1:37:04] in the fact that he's able to turn even
[1:37:06] the permissive will of god to his
[1:37:07] perfect will
[1:37:08] and to show it and to use it and and he
[1:37:11] i love the lord for that because just
[1:37:13] even when the devil thinks he's got
[1:37:14] everything wrapped up god can take the
[1:37:16] most wicked thing and turn it around for
[1:37:18] your good and god gets joy
[1:37:21] god gets joy in that he gets glory in
[1:37:23] that because even now in satan's eden
[1:37:26] god's able to take these living stones
[1:37:28] each one of you and to prove the devil
[1:37:30] wrong right in his playground
[1:37:33] and so i give glory to god for that
[1:37:35] and um
[1:37:36] and i i just thank him for that and and
[1:37:38] and what he's done for me and and i just
[1:37:40] want to back up because this one part of
[1:37:42] the the scripture that or a scripture
[1:37:45] i guess my testimony is kind of is part
[1:37:46] of scripture because we're all part of
[1:37:47] the word right but a part of my
[1:37:49] testimony that also encouraged me this
[1:37:52] is and forget lord forgive me for not
[1:37:54] telling in the right order
[1:37:56] but going back to leaving denver and
[1:37:58] going back to iowa the thing that really
[1:37:59] started it was i had listened been
[1:38:01] listening to a message
[1:38:04] sirs is this the sign of the end that
[1:38:06] brother branham preached
[1:38:07] and in that in that message
[1:38:10] brother branham
[1:38:11] talks about moving because he's getting
[1:38:13] ready to move to arizona and he says in
[1:38:16] that message
[1:38:17] he says i don't know where i'm going i
[1:38:19] don't know what i'm doing he says all i
[1:38:21] know is i feel like i'm like abraham
[1:38:23] just trying to follow the will of the
[1:38:24] lord and follow him wherever he would
[1:38:26] lead and i remember at this time of
[1:38:28] changing when the lord had restored me
[1:38:31] i was feeling that way and i remember
[1:38:32] reading that
[1:38:34] or hearing that and having that same
[1:38:36] feeling like lord i feel like abraham
[1:38:38] like you're calling me to leave i have
[1:38:39] no idea what i'm going to do or what i'm
[1:38:41] going to go
[1:38:42] and and the vindication came because
[1:38:44] then i had gone i had heard that
[1:38:47] and then i had gone on to the voice of
[1:38:49] god website
[1:38:51] where they have where they'll put up
[1:38:52] quotes and things sometimes and i
[1:38:54] remember going through their archives of
[1:38:56] different little things that they had
[1:38:58] and just randomly clicking
[1:38:59] on some different ones and when i
[1:39:01] clicked on the one to show the quote it
[1:39:03] was that exact same quote from that
[1:39:05] exact same message that confirmed it to
[1:39:07] me and that's where i that's where i
[1:39:09] kind of felt that's where i made that
[1:39:11] promise to the lord i said lord
[1:39:13] then i will give my two weeks notice
[1:39:16] to that to the work and everything and
[1:39:19] uh so i i did that and then the lord
[1:39:20] comes and confirms it by revealing that
[1:39:22] church what was going on there and then
[1:39:24] coming back with the dream and he just
[1:39:26] confirmation on confirmation to really
[1:39:28] embolden me and give really gave me
[1:39:30] grace to do that
[1:39:32] and so
[1:39:33] uh
[1:39:35] now
[1:39:36] i know there's a lot i don't want to
[1:39:38] wear you out i trust i'm not wearing any
[1:39:39] out but i want to go a little farther
[1:39:40] with this just to give glory to god for
[1:39:42] what he did and and this this the reason
[1:39:44] i say this next part is because i don't
[1:39:46] want anybody to think
[1:39:48] any ill of anybody or anything because
[1:39:50] i'm going to say something that some the
[1:39:51] devil could try to use certain things
[1:39:53] but i know it was god
[1:39:55] and because it was for me i know it was
[1:39:57] for me and the lord told me it was for
[1:39:58] me uh
[1:40:00] and so i decided okay lord i'm packing
[1:40:03] up everything i have and i'm moving to
[1:40:04] iowa i had no job
[1:40:06] i had a thousand dollars in the bank
[1:40:09] account maybe
[1:40:10] i had a little jeep liberty
[1:40:12] that i packed literally everything i
[1:40:14] owned into including my mattress so much
[1:40:16] so that when i was driving i had to
[1:40:18] drive like this because my mattress was
[1:40:20] over my head and the only thing i
[1:40:23] couldn't take with me was my dresser
[1:40:24] because it was just too big and my frame
[1:40:26] for my bed but i had everything else
[1:40:29] and i drove out there
[1:40:31] and i remember telling brother isaiah
[1:40:33] brooks i said brother so the lord told
[1:40:34] me to come out there and i remember
[1:40:38] the lord the lord told him
[1:40:40] that he said i said brother do you have
[1:40:41] a place for me to stay or anything i
[1:40:43] could stay and
[1:40:44] the lord told him that to that i wasn't
[1:40:46] to stay with him
[1:40:48] and i remember thinking my you know
[1:40:50] thing okay
[1:40:51] and i i didn't know you know and and
[1:40:54] lord forgive me i could have probably
[1:40:55] maybe asked someone else or found
[1:40:57] something else but i just remember
[1:40:58] feeling like oh lord okay
[1:41:00] but i knew here's the thing though but
[1:41:02] the devil couldn't take away from me
[1:41:03] even trying to use that you know the
[1:41:05] devil would try to use that and say oh
[1:41:06] you're not meant to go but i knew what
[1:41:08] the lord had told me so i said lord i i
[1:41:10] that that's not about that it's
[1:41:12] about me fulfilling the word of god no
[1:41:14] matter what it is on the other side
[1:41:17] and so i slept in a walmart parking lot
[1:41:19] for like a week you know and uh three it
[1:41:22] might have been less than a week but it
[1:41:23] was close to a week and it was in the
[1:41:25] summer too so it wasn't it wasn't cold
[1:41:27] it wasn't it wasn't comfortable um but
[1:41:29] brother brooks allowed me to keep my
[1:41:31] stuff at his house i would put in the
[1:41:32] garage and i slept in my jeep and
[1:41:35] and right when i got there it was around
[1:41:37] uh fourth of july it's and it's really
[1:41:39] amazing to me
[1:41:41] how the lord has used the fourth of july
[1:41:43] in my life a lot that period of time
[1:41:45] because i've experienced that actually
[1:41:47] even more recently in my life the fourth
[1:41:48] of july
[1:41:50] but
[1:41:50] uh
[1:41:51] the fourth of july they had some
[1:41:52] meetings at a church up there in
[1:41:54] minnesota and i heard about it so i went
[1:41:57] up there with them and had a wonderful
[1:41:59] time in the lord and
[1:42:00] and uh
[1:42:02] was i drove i'd ridden up there with
[1:42:04] brother brother brooks and and uh on the
[1:42:06] way back i guess the lord had laid it on
[1:42:08] someone's heart they'd heard about what
[1:42:11] the lord had done for me
[1:42:12] and how they called me to go out there
[1:42:14] and and they gave me like a thousand
[1:42:16] dollars or fifteen hundred dollars that
[1:42:18] led on their heart and i just remember
[1:42:19] weeping
[1:42:20] and just crying and said lord like he's
[1:42:22] just so merciful to me and i don't
[1:42:23] deserve any of it you know
[1:42:25] i'm the i'm the least among anybody you
[1:42:27] know and uh
[1:42:29] i just i rejoice so grateful to that and
[1:42:32] then the lord
[1:42:33] soon after
[1:42:34] the lord put on brother brooks's heart
[1:42:37] at the time they were staying in uh
[1:42:39] the church they they had was in a little
[1:42:41] office building that had a little out
[1:42:42] room a little extra office room and
[1:42:44] brother brooks allowed me to stay in
[1:42:46] there so i stayed in there for a couple
[1:42:48] weeks while i found a job and the lord
[1:42:50] allowed me to do that and but the reason
[1:42:52] i say that part
[1:42:54] and the reason i bring that was because
[1:42:55] the lord
[1:42:56] used sister karen again and the lord
[1:42:58] because i expressed it i remember
[1:42:59] talking on the phone with sister karen
[1:43:02] and uh and the lord spoke to her and and
[1:43:04] she spoke it back to me and said the
[1:43:05] lord had told her this and and i found
[1:43:07] it to be the truth because how the lord
[1:43:09] used it in my life and said that the
[1:43:10] lord allowed that
[1:43:12] to prove to me that it was he that had
[1:43:14] called me out there and that it wasn't
[1:43:16] any man
[1:43:17] that was doing the work you know that it
[1:43:19] wasn't any man that had drawn me out
[1:43:21] there or or you know to establish me in
[1:43:23] that place to show that it wasn't it
[1:43:26] wasn't because of the kindness of a man
[1:43:28] that they had prosecuted me to pull me
[1:43:29] over there or wasn't anything but god
[1:43:31] had done the work
[1:43:33] and that regardless of what it was the
[1:43:34] lord had stuck me through that and so i
[1:43:37] just rejoice in the lord for his grace
[1:43:39] you know and then so
[1:43:41] uh you know he gave me he gave me a job
[1:43:43] working at a landscape supply company
[1:43:46] and i wasn't making hardly any i was
[1:43:48] making decent i was making like 11.50 an
[1:43:50] hour which is pretty good for me i was
[1:43:51] feeling pretty good about that and i the
[1:43:53] lord gave me an apartment that i could
[1:43:55] walk to work so i didn't have to you
[1:43:57] know to deal with car stuff as much and
[1:44:00] and uh
[1:44:01] the lord just really blessed me blessed
[1:44:03] me in that way allowed me to pay off
[1:44:05] some debts and things that i had even
[1:44:06] though i wasn't making a lot of money
[1:44:08] you know i had some debts that were kind
[1:44:10] of left over for some stuff and allowed
[1:44:12] me at 11.50 an hour to pay off debts you
[1:44:14] know i was i was working so hard to pay
[1:44:16] off debts i applied for a credit card
[1:44:18] just because they said if you get this
[1:44:20] credit card we'll give you 300
[1:44:22] after you spend a hundred dollars and as
[1:44:24] soon as i spent the hundred dollars and
[1:44:25] got the 300 i canceled it and cut up the
[1:44:27] card and used it to pay off some debts i
[1:44:29] said praise the lord for the free offers
[1:44:31] you know and i i
[1:44:33] see it's like well you know not abusing
[1:44:34] this world but using it rather i was
[1:44:36] trying to use it to my advantage and the
[1:44:38] lord just really blessed me that way and
[1:44:40] so
[1:44:41] trying to so it kind of come into the
[1:44:43] end here
[1:44:44] you know just at the end of how the lord
[1:44:46] kind of led me to my wife and uh and
[1:44:49] things and you know again i come to the
[1:44:51] place like lord i want to get married
[1:44:53] and
[1:44:53] and trying to find out the will of the
[1:44:55] lord for that and uh
[1:44:57] and i remember
[1:44:59] i remember hearing a story and
[1:45:02] maybe it seems like it and lord forgive
[1:45:05] me if i was being even immature in this
[1:45:06] way but i remember hearing a story just
[1:45:08] in passing of probably hearsay from
[1:45:11] someone else about a sister
[1:45:13] that had wanted to get married so bad
[1:45:16] that she prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:45:17] and lord put it on her heart that she
[1:45:19] she bought a suit
[1:45:20] that would match exactly what she
[1:45:22] desired in a husband and she put that in
[1:45:24] her closet and prayed over it and things
[1:45:26] like that and i and as silly as that
[1:45:28] sounds that just kind of struck in my
[1:45:29] mind and i remember walking through a
[1:45:31] mall
[1:45:32] walking through the mall when malls were
[1:45:33] still a thing
[1:45:35] before the time that we live in now you
[1:45:36] know and walking through them all and
[1:45:38] just thinking i remember seeing uh
[1:45:41] i think it was that store forever 21 and
[1:45:43] they sold a lot of women stuff there but
[1:45:44] they actually sold long skirts there at
[1:45:47] the time and i remember seeing those and
[1:45:49] that came to my mind i said lord
[1:45:51] i said lord maybe it's silly but i went
[1:45:52] in there and i bought i thought about it
[1:45:54] i said lord i'm gonna buy this skirt
[1:45:57] i bought a skirt and i prayed to her i
[1:45:58] said lord i said lord whoever my wife is
[1:46:00] is going to fit this skirt just
[1:46:01] perfectly and i just put it in my closet
[1:46:04] i crumpled it up really small and
[1:46:05] stuffed it in the closet so if someone
[1:46:06] went in the closet they didn't think
[1:46:08] brother randy had a skirt for some
[1:46:09] random reason and i hit it and i and i
[1:46:11] just left it
[1:46:12] and then and that was all it was for a
[1:46:14] while i left it in there for it was
[1:46:15] probably at least a year or more
[1:46:17] and that may be silly and i don't
[1:46:19] encourage anyone to even do that but
[1:46:20] just i just did it you know and it was
[1:46:22] maybe my desperation looking for
[1:46:24] something maybe to latch onto in faith
[1:46:27] and just praying and
[1:46:29] you know and and trying and i had and i
[1:46:31] had tried different times throughout the
[1:46:33] the years
[1:46:34] even to like
[1:46:36] make moves to like see a sister or
[1:46:38] something that i thought well maybe the
[1:46:39] lord would lead that way and i'd get
[1:46:41] shut down here and lead this way and i'd
[1:46:43] get shut down there and even the parents
[1:46:44] would just shut me down sometimes and
[1:46:46] i'm like lord i don't know
[1:46:47] what's happening here and
[1:46:49] and then and then in 2011 my wife
[1:46:52] moved back to iowa
[1:46:54] and was staying with her parents
[1:46:56] and uh
[1:46:58] i just been praying and praying and i
[1:47:00] kind of left it alone left it alone and
[1:47:02] i kind of
[1:47:03] the lord i i'm not really perceptive
[1:47:06] when it comes to social things but i
[1:47:07] didn't even find i didn't even find out
[1:47:09] until after the fact you know because
[1:47:11] the church there in des moines you might
[1:47:12] know is pretty small and there's really
[1:47:14] nobody else that was there of my age
[1:47:17] that i could marry
[1:47:18] except for her
[1:47:20] and she had just really started serving
[1:47:22] the lord and really you know she had
[1:47:23] gone through some different times and
[1:47:25] the lord was working in her life and she
[1:47:27] was coming through
[1:47:28] and i had kind of maybe felt a little
[1:47:30] bit of a pull in that direction but i
[1:47:32] would kind of just put it off because i
[1:47:33] was like no i don't i can't be it that
[1:47:35] can't be this and that
[1:47:37] and uh
[1:47:38] and i'd kind of really push it off push
[1:47:39] it off push it off and then
[1:47:41] um i kind of went and then finally
[1:47:44] i was like all right i kind of we
[1:47:45] started talking a little bit just just
[1:47:47] talking and not even really
[1:47:51] seriously in a way but i was just kind
[1:47:52] of
[1:47:53] very very kind of like on the outskirts
[1:47:55] like lord let's see maybe maybe maybe
[1:47:58] not i don't know you know how it is you
[1:48:00] know
[1:48:00] you're just you really want to be sure
[1:48:02] you want to be positive you know you
[1:48:04] really want to have the mind of the lord
[1:48:06] and uh and so i was like well lord
[1:48:09] i said i'm just going to give her the
[1:48:10] test
[1:48:11] you know you know because i could see
[1:48:13] that the lord had been working in her
[1:48:14] life and i knew that she was serving the
[1:48:16] lord you know so that was the first
[1:48:18] thing first and foremost i'd seen the
[1:48:20] change the lord had made in her and
[1:48:23] and i could see you know and i remember
[1:48:25] thinking looking at the family
[1:48:28] i remember thinking in my heart of when
[1:48:30] you want to decide on a wife look at the
[1:48:32] mother because the scripture says as is
[1:48:34] the the daughter is so the as the mother
[1:48:36] is so is the daughter and i was looking
[1:48:38] at that character and i really
[1:48:40] appreciated her mother's character
[1:48:41] because i could see that she had such a
[1:48:43] heart for her children
[1:48:45] and she was a real mother to her
[1:48:46] children and had such a a heart for her
[1:48:49] children to serve god and how she really
[1:48:51] desired that and still does you know has
[1:48:53] that heart and such a motherly desire to
[1:48:56] to see her children serve god and i was
[1:48:57] like lord that's that you know that
[1:48:59] would be a good mother to children you
[1:49:00] know to have that kind of uh attitude
[1:49:02] and everything and
[1:49:04] and so i said well lord i'm just gonna
[1:49:06] i'm gonna go and and and do it i said
[1:49:09] lord i'm gonna give her the skirt
[1:49:11] i thought because i kind of forgot about
[1:49:13] it and i said lord i'm just gonna do it
[1:49:15] i said lord i'm gonna step out in faith
[1:49:17] and maybe it sounds silly to you but
[1:49:19] it's just where i was desperation-wise
[1:49:21] and uh again i'm not encouraging anybody
[1:49:23] to do these things this is my testimony
[1:49:25] of what the lord did for me so you know
[1:49:27] you follow your pastor you follow the
[1:49:29] leader of the holy ghost in your life
[1:49:30] okay because not every i i'll be the
[1:49:32] first to tell you not everything i do is
[1:49:34] always expedient or the smartest thing
[1:49:36] you know i i don't set myself to be of
[1:49:38] the best example but uh
[1:49:41] but i i said laura i guess you know i
[1:49:43] remembered it because i kind of forgot
[1:49:44] it slipped out of my memory i said oh
[1:49:45] yeah i have that skirt and i had prayed
[1:49:47] over that i said all right lord i said
[1:49:50] this may be crazy but i'm gonna do it
[1:49:53] and so i remember i texted her you know
[1:49:55] at this point we have cell phones now
[1:49:56] and i said i said after service i just
[1:49:59] have something to give you
[1:50:00] and and she said okay and she was kind
[1:50:02] of confused i'm sure and i gave it to
[1:50:04] her i said i said i have this skirt to
[1:50:05] give you i said when you get home tried
[1:50:07] on
[1:50:08] and tell me you know how it fit and and
[1:50:11] uh
[1:50:12] and i said i'd ask the lord i said it'll
[1:50:14] fit it'll fit perfectly it'll fit just
[1:50:16] right you know if it's of him and and i
[1:50:18] remember i
[1:50:19] called her afterwards i said so how was
[1:50:21] it and she said yeah it fit just right
[1:50:22] and everything and and i was like i said
[1:50:24] i said lord if i said if i'm going to do
[1:50:26] this i have to do it if i'm going to
[1:50:27] honor it i said that's what my thought
[1:50:29] was i said i told her i told her right
[1:50:31] there you know we'd only been really
[1:50:32] kind of talking to each other for
[1:50:36] six days and so people think i was crazy
[1:50:39] but i i said i
[1:50:42] i just i believe
[1:50:43] i believe if the lord shows you
[1:50:45] something in faith then you go by faith
[1:50:48] you know and so i i told her right there
[1:50:50] i said i said you may think i'm crazy
[1:50:52] and if you want to run away that's fine
[1:50:54] i said but i'm going to marry you
[1:50:57] i said because i said and i told i
[1:50:59] explained to her the testimony of it and
[1:51:01] you want to know what the crazy thing
[1:51:02] was
[1:51:03] she said okay she said okay i can
[1:51:05] believe that
[1:51:07] and and i i was shocked
[1:51:09] you know but it had to be god because i
[1:51:12] don't think anybody
[1:51:15] and i come to find out later that that
[1:51:18] the lord had been working on her heart
[1:51:19] the whole time
[1:51:20] and she had had a really pull towards me
[1:51:22] and i didn't even know it because i was
[1:51:23] too socially enough to even see any
[1:51:25] signs that she might have thought that
[1:51:27] way about me you know or even had those
[1:51:29] desires and and to see how the lord
[1:51:32] works on both ends and so but anyway i
[1:51:34] say that part of it to get to the part
[1:51:36] of how the lord really just confirmed it
[1:51:37] to me because
[1:51:38] now you if you ever do anything for the
[1:51:41] lord in faith the devil is going to be
[1:51:43] there to resist he is going to be right
[1:51:45] there to resist all the way and i tell
[1:51:47] you brothers and sisters as soon as that
[1:51:48] happened you know the lord
[1:51:51] the lord i had bought a ring and
[1:51:52] everything i was like i'm going to i'm
[1:51:53] going to do this. i told her that over
[1:51:55] the phone like i believe we're going to
[1:51:56] get married i really do believe that i
[1:51:58] didn't ask her at that point i just said
[1:52:00] i believe that i wasn't she didn't think
[1:52:02] now she didn't think it was going to
[1:52:03] happen as fast as it did but i was ready
[1:52:05] i had already been ready i purchased not
[1:52:07] only that i had already purchased a ring
[1:52:08] before all this
[1:52:10] and i purchased the ring not knowing her
[1:52:12] ring size or anything
[1:52:13] and um but i it she didn't know it
[1:52:16] but
[1:52:17] um so i had uh prepared and i said lord
[1:52:21] you open up a window and i'm gonna do
[1:52:22] i'm gonna ask her and so uh
[1:52:26] it was really kind of interesting
[1:52:27] because we had gone out with her family
[1:52:29] her and i and her family had gone out to
[1:52:30] eat some frozen yogurt after the service
[1:52:32] one night on a wednesday and she had to
[1:52:34] work the next morning and uh her family
[1:52:37] you know was kind of like okay we want
[1:52:38] to make sure you're home kind of early
[1:52:39] because you kind of have to get up early
[1:52:41] in the morning and i told her i didn't
[1:52:43] want to i didn't want to propose to her
[1:52:45] in the parking lot of a frozen yogurt
[1:52:47] place
[1:52:48] and i had no other place thought of
[1:52:49] because i don't plan far enough ahead
[1:52:51] for these things brothers and sisters i
[1:52:52] don't plan at all a lot of times and i
[1:52:55] just knew i was like lord this i just
[1:52:56] felt led that it was the time though
[1:52:58] and so i said well come with me back to
[1:53:00] the church i got something i have to do
[1:53:02] there real quick and she's like okay and
[1:53:03] she told me she after the fact she told
[1:53:05] me she was actually kind of frustrated
[1:53:07] because she's like she's like we only
[1:53:08] have a little bit of time to fellowship
[1:53:10] together and and hang out together a
[1:53:12] little bit and and you're gonna waste
[1:53:13] half of it driving over the church back
[1:53:15] again and and she's like and so she got
[1:53:18] out of the car and i knelt down and
[1:53:19] asked her to marry me and and she was so
[1:53:21] shocked the only word she could say was
[1:53:23] are you serious
[1:53:27] and i said brazil and she and then she
[1:53:28] said yes of course and i and i knew it
[1:53:30] was god just you know only god can do
[1:53:33] something like that
[1:53:34] to lead i mean because we i tell people
[1:53:36] i and i use it as a testimony for people
[1:53:38] that i work with and when they asked me
[1:53:39] about my wife i said yeah i said i said
[1:53:42] i proposed to her after we we dated and
[1:53:44] we weren't even dating according what
[1:53:45] the world calls it because we don't do
[1:53:46] that but i said we we courted her day i
[1:53:49] said i said i dated my wife for nine
[1:53:51] days before i proposed to her and they
[1:53:52] look at me like what in the world i said
[1:53:54] i said hey i said when the lord tells
[1:53:56] you to do something you do it and i tell
[1:53:58] him i said it's in the lord it was one
[1:54:01] of the best decisions i ever made
[1:54:02] because my wife has been faithful my
[1:54:04] wife have been by my side and she's been
[1:54:05] supportive of me and she's been she's
[1:54:08] been and i again i go back to the book
[1:54:10] brother jesse that you read uh that you
[1:54:12] wrote
[1:54:13] how it like she's been my correction you
[1:54:15] know she's been there to help to help
[1:54:17] push me on when when the devil's
[1:54:18] fighting me and i'm there to uplift her
[1:54:20] and it's always amazing to me and i've
[1:54:22] expressed even this to her of how it's
[1:54:25] amazing how the lord will work in that
[1:54:26] of how
[1:54:27] when i'm up she might be down and i can
[1:54:29] lift her up and then at times when i'm
[1:54:31] down she'll be up and she can lift me up
[1:54:34] and how the lord always brings a balance
[1:54:35] like that and so you know we pray i did
[1:54:38] that and and at that and uh well again i
[1:54:41] skip things and forgive me for skipping
[1:54:42] things but
[1:54:44] because the real testimony of the whole
[1:54:45] thing comes
[1:54:46] you know the devil really started
[1:54:47] fighting me after i told her these
[1:54:49] things of like i'm i'm i really believe
[1:54:51] we're going to get married because then
[1:54:52] i expressed to her those things and now
[1:54:54] the devil's fighting like did you really
[1:54:56] pray that prayer over that skirt and
[1:54:58] it's amazing how the devil will try to
[1:55:00] make you not even believe what's
[1:55:01] actually happened
[1:55:02] and it's amazing how how wicked the
[1:55:04] devil is in that because
[1:55:06] the dead and that you'll find the devil
[1:55:07] will do this in your life for anything
[1:55:09] that you have need of or are fighting
[1:55:10] with if you have need of something the
[1:55:12] devil will fight you and fight you and
[1:55:14] fight you
[1:55:16] to get to the blessing and then when you
[1:55:18] get to the blessing he'll try to tell
[1:55:20] you the blessing never happened
[1:55:22] and it's so interesting he'll fight you
[1:55:23] to keep you from the blessing
[1:55:25] because he knows the blessing's there
[1:55:27] but then when the blessings happen he'll
[1:55:28] try to he'll try to convince you that it
[1:55:29] didn't happen
[1:55:30] and and i find that's how the devil at
[1:55:32] least was working with me he's like oh
[1:55:34] you didn't pray this prayer and these
[1:55:35] things and i'm really battling in my
[1:55:37] mind because you know i was like lord
[1:55:39] this is a big decision but i believe
[1:55:41] you've led me this way but and i
[1:55:42] remember
[1:55:43] you know but i was like before i propose
[1:55:45] so i'm backing up a little bit again so
[1:55:47] forgive me i know it's jumbled i'm not a
[1:55:49] very good public speaker so forgive me
[1:55:50] but i remember thinking like
[1:55:52] lord
[1:55:54] i i want to ask her parents first i want
[1:55:56] to do this right like i told her what my
[1:55:58] intentions are i told
[1:56:00] sister lindsay i told her what my
[1:56:01] intentions were but i want to tell her
[1:56:03] parents before i actually make the move
[1:56:05] because i want to do it right you know i
[1:56:07] want to do this right i want to make
[1:56:08] sure they understand what's going on
[1:56:09] because i'm sure it might be a shock to
[1:56:11] them that i plan on doing this so early
[1:56:13] and so
[1:56:14] i had texted uh tech or maybe he left a
[1:56:17] voice message one of the two her father
[1:56:20] and uh
[1:56:22] sent a message to him or something and
[1:56:23] just said hey if you have opportunity i
[1:56:25] would really like to get together with
[1:56:27] you and sister kim who are my my
[1:56:28] father-in-law's brother dan and sister
[1:56:30] kim
[1:56:31] i said i really like to get together
[1:56:32] with you guys to discuss something and i
[1:56:34] know
[1:56:35] you know they they're intelligent enough
[1:56:37] can read enough into it that they
[1:56:38] probably know what's going to happen in
[1:56:40] that conversation maybe but at the same
[1:56:43] time i'm just like well we'll see what
[1:56:44] happens
[1:56:45] and um
[1:56:46] so
[1:56:47] but they didn't answer
[1:56:48] and and i just be honest with you i
[1:56:50] could feel my faith
[1:56:52] you know you when you get into the
[1:56:53] anointing and you have things happen and
[1:56:55] things happen you know your faith comes
[1:56:57] to a certain level sometimes and and
[1:56:59] maybe you'll be in a certain place where
[1:57:00] you're ready to receive it but then as
[1:57:02] time goes on that devil tries to wear on
[1:57:04] you and maybe can wear away and tries to
[1:57:07] remove faith from the situation and i
[1:57:09] know just me being the the person that i
[1:57:12] am
[1:57:12] you know in the age that we live in such
[1:57:14] an intellectual age you start to
[1:57:16] overthink things and i know my brain is
[1:57:18] just going and going did you really mean
[1:57:19] that did you really hear this did you
[1:57:21] really pray that did you really and i
[1:57:23] remember getting down before the lord
[1:57:25] and praying earnestly and crying before
[1:57:28] the lord that day
[1:57:29] because
[1:57:31] i knew myself
[1:57:33] and i knew the faith that i had was at
[1:57:35] that level and i remember praying before
[1:57:37] the lord because they weren't answering
[1:57:38] it was like half the day and i knew they
[1:57:40] had had to have gotten the message but
[1:57:41] they weren't answering me and i'm
[1:57:42] thinking are they going to reject me
[1:57:44] lord if if and i remember praying before
[1:57:46] the lord i said lord i know i have the
[1:57:47] faith right now that you've given me to
[1:57:49] do this. i said but lord if i'm not able
[1:57:52] to go move forward with it i said i i
[1:57:55] don't know if i will have the faith to
[1:57:56] do it if it lasts another week
[1:57:59] because you know how it is you just you
[1:58:01] sometimes you're just you haven't
[1:58:02] grasped it as much as you ought to you
[1:58:04] know and lord forgive i say lord i
[1:58:06] believe but help my own belief you know
[1:58:08] sometimes you go through those those
[1:58:09] periods
[1:58:11] and um
[1:58:12] i remember getting down and praying and
[1:58:13] i prayed for probably a solid hour and i
[1:58:16] cried i i cried tears i said lord just
[1:58:18] help me you know to to make the right
[1:58:20] decision and if this is the right thing
[1:58:22] and and if you'll do it you'll vindicate
[1:58:23] it for me just to help me i said lord i
[1:58:26] don't i don't want to ask for more
[1:58:27] vindication because you vindicated so
[1:58:29] much but maybe if you just vindicate it
[1:58:30] for me
[1:58:31] and i and i and i got i was really tired
[1:58:34] after i prayed and i was like i'm going
[1:58:35] to take a nap and we'll see we'll just
[1:58:37] see what happens you know i took a nap
[1:58:39] and i when i woke up the thing that woke
[1:58:41] me up was a text message from her father
[1:58:43] or i think my yeah from her father
[1:58:44] saying oh yeah we could if you want to
[1:58:45] come over right now we can talk and so
[1:58:48] and come to find out the lord worked on
[1:58:50] that end too because
[1:58:51] they had been out
[1:58:53] uh her parents had been out doing yard
[1:58:54] work
[1:58:56] and uh gotten the text message
[1:58:59] and they kind of knew what the text
[1:59:00] message was about but they were kind of
[1:59:02] putting it off and avoiding it and
[1:59:04] ignoring it because they were kind of
[1:59:05] you know they loved their daughter and
[1:59:07] they kind of knew what it was probably
[1:59:08] going to be about but they're kind of
[1:59:09] hesitant because hey here comes this guy
[1:59:11] in nine days he's gonna maybe do the
[1:59:13] propose and
[1:59:14] and uh they had confidence in me but at
[1:59:16] the same time as a parent you know you
[1:59:18] could understand how much of a
[1:59:20] faith that was you know my goodness
[1:59:22] but
[1:59:23] during the time after i prayed the lord
[1:59:26] had worked on her mother's heart
[1:59:28] to go back to her husband and say hey we
[1:59:30] need to get together with him
[1:59:32] and the lord moved even on their end to
[1:59:35] get so the lord heard my prayer and he's
[1:59:36] just so merciful to me like in all my
[1:59:39] ups and downs and everything he's so
[1:59:40] good to me and i don't deserve the least
[1:59:42] of his mercies but his his mercies are
[1:59:44] renewed every morning and thank the lord
[1:59:46] for it you know so
[1:59:49] so i i talked with them and they gave
[1:59:50] their blessing on and then we went and
[1:59:52] you know uh proposed and everything and
[1:59:54] and the lord is blessed and uh
[1:59:56] you know i uh
[1:59:58] you know and in closing i'll just tell
[2:00:00] one last little testimony you know you
[2:00:02] pray for us because you know we're we're
[2:00:04] looking to have children
[2:00:06] you know and uh i believe you know i
[2:00:08] believe you may be in a similar
[2:00:09] situation to you brother amen and you
[2:00:11] know my wife's had four miscarriages so
[2:00:13] far you know and none of them made it
[2:00:15] very very long you know they've and i'm
[2:00:17] and i'm just again being transparent so
[2:00:19] you know what you can maybe pray for us
[2:00:20] on you know
[2:00:21] and uh
[2:00:22] you know uh
[2:00:24] but just to give one last little
[2:00:25] testimony
[2:00:26] you know the lord's really blessed us
[2:00:28] and uh he's been so gracious to us you
[2:00:30] know when we first got married we were
[2:00:32] both working because i wasn't making a
[2:00:34] lot of money i was working at a factory
[2:00:36] and uh you know we didn't have any
[2:00:37] children yet so i was like well she's
[2:00:39] working at the hospital she was a
[2:00:40] receptionist at the hospital
[2:00:42] and it was good it was you know nice and
[2:00:44] everything it was pretty easy work for
[2:00:45] her to do and she was close to work and
[2:00:47] her mom had got blessed her with that
[2:00:49] job or she the lord the lord just to
[2:00:51] give you a testimony on that side
[2:00:53] when she was looking for a job the lord
[2:00:55] had given her such favor with the people
[2:00:57] there through her mom at the hospital
[2:00:59] that they actually created the position
[2:01:01] that she worked in specifically to give
[2:01:03] her a job
[2:01:04] and so it was just a blessing on that
[2:01:05] end and so i was working at this factory
[2:01:08] and uh you know i uh right after we had
[2:01:11] gotten engaged i had my hand almost
[2:01:13] chopped off my hand like a guillotine
[2:01:15] almost and chopped it all the way down
[2:01:16] to the bone and severed all the nerves
[2:01:18] and ligaments and everything and i had
[2:01:20] to have like six or seven hours of
[2:01:21] surgery um and that's another little
[2:01:23] mini testimony because uh you know by
[2:01:26] the grace of god i didn't lose my hand
[2:01:28] and just to show you even the grace of
[2:01:30] god in that moment i remember when it
[2:01:32] happened you know you think of how you'd
[2:01:34] react in a moment something like that so
[2:01:35] traumatic i remember the thing hit me
[2:01:38] and i knew it was bad from the instant
[2:01:40] it happened i mean it's just a shock to
[2:01:41] your system you know it's your body goes
[2:01:43] into shock and just pain and i never
[2:01:46] even looked at it i just grabbed it and
[2:01:48] i i remember just screaming and
[2:01:50] but i
[2:01:52] the holy ghost how it'll do things for
[2:01:53] you know
[2:01:55] because i remember
[2:01:56] being even amazed looking back at it i
[2:01:59] remember getting down on my knees in
[2:02:01] that moment
[2:02:02] and saying lord i remember just praying
[2:02:04] to the lord
[2:02:05] i said lord
[2:02:07] i said lord just give me grace to endure
[2:02:09] this
[2:02:11] and and my hand is literally half off
[2:02:13] like i never looked at it because i
[2:02:15] remember the one thing and i thank the
[2:02:16] lord for this i remember thinking if you
[2:02:17] look at it it's going to be a lot worse
[2:02:21] because i could and forgive me if it
[2:02:22] seems gruesome but i could in the moment
[2:02:25] before i grabbed it i could feel it
[2:02:26] slopping around because it had chopped
[2:02:29] everything
[2:02:30] and i remember just thinking lord
[2:02:32] going down on my knees in that moment
[2:02:34] and just praying and saying lord
[2:02:37] lord if this is part of what it takes
[2:02:38] for me to make a rapture just give me
[2:02:40] the grace to endure it
[2:02:42] and i know that's nothing but the grace
[2:02:43] of god because that's not a normal human
[2:02:45] action in that moment you know and the
[2:02:48] lord blessed because when we went to the
[2:02:49] doctor they had you know had to wait for
[2:02:51] the ambulance and everything and they
[2:02:52] came and they wrapped it up as best they
[2:02:53] could went to the doctor
[2:02:55] and when the doctor came in you know
[2:02:56] your ligaments here my fingers were
[2:02:58] sticking straight out because there was
[2:03:00] no bottom ligament to curl my fingers in
[2:03:02] and i couldn't move them because they
[2:03:03] had all gone up into my wrist and so
[2:03:05] they had put an oximeter
[2:03:07] to test your oxygen levels in my fingers
[2:03:10] because it had so severed everything i
[2:03:13] found out afterwards all of the blood
[2:03:14] vessels and everything that supplies
[2:03:16] blood to the fingers was cut the only
[2:03:19] thing that was supplying anything was
[2:03:20] the top little bit of skin that's on
[2:03:22] your hand and you know that ain't much
[2:03:23] there
[2:03:24] and so the doctor was actually pretty
[2:03:26] shocked to find when he put the oximeter
[2:03:29] on my fingers it was almost completely
[2:03:30] normal oxygen readings and they hadn't
[2:03:32] turned blue
[2:03:34] they hadn't any of those things and it
[2:03:36] was just the grace of god you know and
[2:03:38] and even something this small that maybe
[2:03:40] you don't think much of but i do
[2:03:41] remember going in for the surgery they
[2:03:43] put got ready to put me under
[2:03:45] and the my my dad's name is jeff and my
[2:03:47] name is randall or randy people call me
[2:03:49] randy
[2:03:50] the doctor that did my surgery was named
[2:03:52] jeff
[2:03:53] and my main nurse that did the
[2:03:55] dispersion was named randy
[2:03:57] i just thought you know i and i remember
[2:03:59] thinking about that even when i went
[2:04:00] into surgeries like the lord doesn't do
[2:04:02] anything by accident you know and i
[2:04:03] that's why i'm encouraged because i
[2:04:04] believe my my dad's coming you know the
[2:04:06] lord puts little things like that for me
[2:04:08] as little nuggets and little crumbs of
[2:04:10] encouragement
[2:04:11] and um
[2:04:12] you know from that moment i remember
[2:04:14] you know the lord by his grace they
[2:04:16] saved the hand and you could see i i
[2:04:18] can't maybe don't have the full use of
[2:04:19] it yet but i know it's coming because
[2:04:20] i've had i've had brothers that have had
[2:04:22] a brother that's had a dream about it i
[2:04:24] know i've had a dream about it playing
[2:04:25] the guitar fully because i played guitar
[2:04:27] and everything and by his grace and i
[2:04:29] know the healing's coming because he's
[2:04:30] he's he's vindicated that through
[2:04:32] different testimonies that people have
[2:04:34] given so you just pray for me that the
[2:04:36] lord will bring my faith to the place
[2:04:37] where i can receive it and you'll you'll
[2:04:39] all know when it happens because i'll be
[2:04:40] up here playing guitar and it's going to
[2:04:42] be it's going to be a it's going to be a
[2:04:44] testimony i'll give to the lord
[2:04:46] but during that time this will just be
[2:04:48] the last little bit as we close
[2:04:51] um you know i was working at that
[2:04:53] factory i was really blessed by it but
[2:04:54] though it seemed like in that moment
[2:04:56] when that happened things kind of turned
[2:04:58] and at the job they kind of treated me a
[2:05:00] little bit rough even after this injury
[2:05:02] happened and and i remember thinking
[2:05:04] like
[2:05:05] you know i don't i don't know you know
[2:05:07] they
[2:05:08] you know
[2:05:10] they hadn't really treated me as well as
[2:05:12] i thought they maybe should have during
[2:05:14] that period when i was recovering
[2:05:15] because i went back to work after two
[2:05:17] weeks after that and i couldn't really
[2:05:19] work work
[2:05:20] but they had me do they had me brother
[2:05:22] they brother and sister they had me in a
[2:05:23] room
[2:05:24] i worked in a factory so it's all manual
[2:05:26] labor and i couldn't do anything like
[2:05:27] that yet because i hadn't been cleared
[2:05:29] because my hand was in the cast and
[2:05:30] stuff to you know the surgery and so
[2:05:33] they put me in a room i remember they
[2:05:34] put me in a room and they lost it as it
[2:05:37] locked me in the room but i had to stay
[2:05:38] in that room for eight hours a night and
[2:05:39] watch videos safety videos and stuff all
[2:05:42] night long
[2:05:44] and i remember just thinking like why
[2:05:45] are they doing this to me it was like
[2:05:48] i mean it sounds it was it was kind of
[2:05:50] like torture i was exhausted i had to
[2:05:52] watch i had nothing else to do they you
[2:05:54] know i couldn't do anything else i
[2:05:55] wasn't allowed to they wouldn't let me
[2:05:57] in so much that the one time
[2:06:00] i got on my phone one time to text my
[2:06:02] wife because i was bored i had nothing
[2:06:03] to do i got on my phone one time to text
[2:06:06] my wife and a supervisor just happened
[2:06:08] to be looking through the window and
[2:06:09] they wrote me up for it and i remember
[2:06:10] in the room with them and i was like why
[2:06:12] i was like you guys have me in there i
[2:06:14] can't do anything i've watched all the
[2:06:15] videos 10 times
[2:06:17] i was like what do you want me to do
[2:06:18] you know and i was so i was really kind
[2:06:20] of frustrated and and and so the lord
[2:06:23] kind of my dad was an air traffic
[2:06:26] controller it was like hey they're
[2:06:27] having a bid an open bid to put in for
[2:06:29] air traffic controlling and i was so
[2:06:30] desperate at the time because i was kind
[2:06:32] of miserable at the job now because they
[2:06:34] had treated me this way and i put in for
[2:06:36] it not thinking i would ever get it
[2:06:37] because there were so many people that
[2:06:39] applied but god gave me the job you know
[2:06:41] he gave me the job and uh allowed me to
[2:06:44] get that job went to the air traffic
[2:06:46] control academy in oklahoma city and you
[2:06:48] know allowed me to excel i was top of my
[2:06:50] class
[2:06:52] there and because i was top of my class
[2:06:54] i had first choice of places that i
[2:06:55] could go when you graduate from there
[2:06:58] you either graduate from there you don't
[2:07:00] have a job so the lord allowed me to
[2:07:02] graduate from that thing it's like a
[2:07:03] four-month program and i had two choices
[2:07:05] i could either go to albuquerque new
[2:07:06] mexico i could go to dallas fort worth
[2:07:09] and i chose dallas fort worth because it
[2:07:11] was more money
[2:07:12] and i didn't
[2:07:13] know much about albuquerque i didn't
[2:07:15] really know much about any of them to be
[2:07:16] honest
[2:07:17] and uh
[2:07:18] you know i went down there
[2:07:20] and i knew that there was a church there
[2:07:22] but i didn't know where it was
[2:07:24] and uh but everything was happening so
[2:07:26] fast i didn't really even have time or
[2:07:28] even the mind it wasn't even in my mind
[2:07:30] to really look for the church at the
[2:07:31] time because everything was happening by
[2:07:32] the time you were done with the academy
[2:07:34] you had like a week to find a place to
[2:07:37] live get down there and get ready for
[2:07:38] work so i was just scrambling all over
[2:07:40] the place you know and uh but by the
[2:07:43] grace of god the grace of god to do it
[2:07:45] he put us our apartment was less than
[2:07:48] five minutes from the church that we go
[2:07:50] to now and so i just say praise god he
[2:07:53] opens he makes the way where there
[2:07:55] doesn't appear to be a way you know
[2:07:57] and so he's in
[2:07:59] you know he's just blessed us he's
[2:08:00] brought us farther he's brought me
[2:08:02] farther into the lord than i ever
[2:08:04] thought i deserved he's revealed his
[2:08:06] word to me he's filled me with the
[2:08:07] spirit and and uh
[2:08:10] like just giving me a hope of of a hope
[2:08:13] and a faith of a rapture and a
[2:08:14] resurrection you know that i believe
[2:08:16] he's given to to each one of us you know
[2:08:18] that he's given us that opportunity and
[2:08:20] so that's just kind of my testimony you
[2:08:22] know i hope it's an encouragement you
[2:08:24] know just remember like if you think
[2:08:27] you're in a spot where get your god
[2:08:28] can't
[2:08:29] god can't speak to you or god you're too
[2:08:31] far gone if you even have that little
[2:08:34] bit of desire
[2:08:35] there's god for you to have if there's
[2:08:38] if there's a desire still in your heart
[2:08:40] to serve god
[2:08:42] then there's a god out there who can
[2:08:43] receive you so don't ever think you've
[2:08:45] gone too far you know even if you come
[2:08:48] even if you've come to this message to
[2:08:51] this truth
[2:08:52] and then you've fallen away of some sort
[2:08:54] or fallen into hard hard place
[2:08:56] spiritually god is still there his blood
[2:08:59] is still
[2:09:00] on the mercy seat
[2:09:02] he's still there to receive you if you
[2:09:04] got a heart to repent
[2:09:06] come to real repentance and give it up
[2:09:08] to the lord and he is faithful and just
[2:09:11] and he will receive you
[2:09:13] i hope i hope that's all right for you
[2:09:15] tonight and i hope that's an
[2:09:16] encouragement to you because i've been
[2:09:17] there you know there's maybe not a lot
[2:09:19] of people i hear a lot of testimonies
[2:09:20] about people who can say well i grew up
[2:09:22] in this word and i grew up in this i
[2:09:23] didn't grow up in it and even after it
[2:09:25] was revealed to me i
[2:09:26] backslid for a season but you know what
[2:09:28] god is faithful
[2:09:30] he is more than able
[2:09:32] he's given brothers and sisters even
[2:09:34] naturally he's blessed me far and above
[2:09:37] anything that i could have ever thought
[2:09:38] and spiritually it's so far beyond that
[2:09:40] i can't even comprehend
[2:09:42] and i'm not worthy of it i'm not a good
[2:09:44] steward of it even naturally or
[2:09:45] spiritually i i hope pray for me that
[2:09:47] i'm a better steward of the things of
[2:09:49] god even when it comes to the word and
[2:09:51] even the natural things
[2:09:52] but i pray that the lord you know i
[2:09:55] thank the lord that he's at least given
[2:09:57] me a revelation of his mercy and grace
[2:09:59] that you can come back to him and repent
[2:10:01] and he's he's faithful and he's just to
[2:10:03] receive you
[2:10:05] don't ever lose sight of that and i know
[2:10:06] brother jesse even mentioned that
[2:10:08] yesterday it's that continual repenting
[2:10:10] we've lost that
[2:10:12] in this age people have become so hard
[2:10:13] and they've either become so hard to it
[2:10:16] and numb to it that they just don't care
[2:10:18] or they become so puffed up in their
[2:10:19] knowledge of the word that they just
[2:10:21] think that everything can just go by
[2:10:23] but god desires truth on the inward
[2:10:26] parts he desires a a a humble and
[2:10:28] contrite heart he won't despise
[2:10:31] so
[2:10:32] as we'd all stand i'll just invite your
[2:10:34] pastor back to close the service uh you
[2:10:36] know i know we kept you along again
[2:10:37] tonight but uh you know it's the first
[2:10:40] time i've ever given my testimony live
[2:10:42] so i you know i guess it was a long one
[2:10:44] i probably went maybe into too much
[2:10:45] detail but i i just want to give glory
[2:10:47] to the lord jesus
[2:10:49] you know he brought he brought me out of
[2:10:51] the miry clay he brought me from these
[2:10:53] things he brought me out of of of the
[2:10:56] trials and temptations and the things
[2:10:57] that i've struggled with and and he's
[2:10:59] still bringing me out to this day
[2:11:01] and one of these glorious days when he
[2:11:03] calls my name and i answer in this
[2:11:05] body's change he's going to bring us out
[2:11:06] for the last time
[2:11:08] he's going to bring us out of this old
[2:11:09] body of flesh in a moment we're going to
[2:11:11] cast off this mortal body
[2:11:13] and and be clothed upon with an eternal
[2:11:15] one
[2:11:16] by his grace
[2:11:18] so let's just bow our heads in a word of
[2:11:19] prayer and then we'll have if you have
[2:11:20] need of prayer we'll pray for you
[2:11:22] you know this may not have been a normal
[2:11:24] type of service but you know what god's
[2:11:25] still here
[2:11:26] because his word said he's still here
[2:11:28] and so
[2:11:29] we'll uh you know we're not we're not
[2:11:31] like those in the pentecostal ranks you
[2:11:33] know that me and brother jesse grew up
[2:11:34] in where we think that you have to be
[2:11:36] emotional to receive something from god
[2:11:38] or it has to be a
[2:11:39] super what we call hyped up service that
[2:11:42] you have to receive something from god
[2:11:43] there was a time where we maybe believed
[2:11:45] that when we were in pentecost and and i
[2:11:47] didn't say this necessarily but i
[2:11:49] remember that they would beat me
[2:11:51] literally beat you on the back and try
[2:11:52] to get you to speak in tongues and i
[2:11:54] remember pretending to speak in tongues
[2:11:56] thinking that was the way to get to god
[2:11:58] and i could be and i'll be honest and
[2:11:59] tell you i never spoke in tongues
[2:12:01] because i just faked it and did what
[2:12:02] they thought what i thought i should do
[2:12:04] but you know what not all the scripture
[2:12:05] says not do all speak with tongues well
[2:12:07] you know why paul said it because it's a
[2:12:09] rhetorical question because a rhetorical
[2:12:11] question means the answer is obvious no
[2:12:13] not all speak with tongues
[2:12:15] not all have every gift
[2:12:17] but i say i receive the gift of the holy
[2:12:19] ghost that leaves and what is it it
[2:12:21] leads you and guides you into all truth
[2:12:25] and he shall lead you and guide you into
[2:12:26] all truth he'll show you things that are
[2:12:28] and he'll show you things to come
[2:12:30] and he's doing it right now
[2:12:32] we're seeing it fulfilled before our
[2:12:34] very eyes we're seeing modern events
[2:12:36] made clear by prophecy even now
[2:12:38] so praise the lord for that heavenly
[2:12:40] father
[2:12:41] we just give you glory and praise and
[2:12:43] honor lord you are high and lifted up
[2:12:45] father your name is worthy to be praised
[2:12:47] the the matchless name of the lord jesus
[2:12:50] christ
[2:12:51] lord the world would try to split you
[2:12:53] into three persons many things would try
[2:12:55] to uplift ministers or ministries and
[2:12:58] different people up to different
[2:12:59] positions
[2:13:00] but lord we know that the scripture says
[2:13:02] that every knee shall bow and every
[2:13:05] tongue shall proclaim that jesus christ
[2:13:07] is lord to the glory of god the father
[2:13:10] lord you've only taken one vessel and
[2:13:12] exalted into that place and that was
[2:13:13] jesus christ
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:28] lord filled with the spirit
[2:13:34] of jesus
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:43] lord i can testify as i have over there
[2:13:47] lord i've had my skills i've had my
[2:13:56] trials we could ever have thought of
[2:14:00] lord you deserve all the poor you
[2:14:01] deserve all the praise
[2:14:03] lord and i and i'm not ashamed of my
[2:14:06] testimony in the gospel of christ father
[2:14:08] because i can glory in the fact that
[2:14:10] through all
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:21] lord not to glory in them
[2:14:23] but lord just to remember your faith
[2:14:35] but let us always be in remembrance of
[2:14:36] your
[2:14:39] lord that grace just bless each other
[2:14:40] for their patience
[2:14:44] bless each and every one lord if there
[2:14:45] be someone that this testimony of god
[2:14:49] has broken
[2:14:52] maybe not in the right
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:15:01] lord if they've got a desire in their
[2:15:03] heart to
[2:15:06] after righteousness serve be filled
[2:15:09] lord we're hungering for more of you
[2:15:11] lord even i've got my hands raised i'll
[2:15:13] raise him to your lord i desire more of
[2:15:15] you lord i don't have enough of you lord
[2:15:18] the more i get of you the more i realize
[2:15:20] i don't have enough of you more because
[2:15:22] it's just the more truth i receive the
[2:15:24] lord the more i realize your perfection
[2:15:26] in holiness is just beyond anything i
[2:15:28] can come to in myself
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:46] lord but as we talked about the
[2:15:48] beginning lord even though that
[2:15:49] scripture is real and cast it off as
[2:15:50] little responding won't let us not cast
[2:15:52] it off that way but then when we've been
[2:15:54] drawn by bands
[2:15:56] we cling forever to you jesus
[2:15:59] [Music]
[2:16:09] glorify you now lord
[2:16:18] um
