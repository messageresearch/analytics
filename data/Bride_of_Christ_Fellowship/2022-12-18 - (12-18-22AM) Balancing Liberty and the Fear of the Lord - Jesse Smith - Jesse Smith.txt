Hallelujah in love Lord God we need more of you today God bless us in your divine presence in Jesus Christ's name Satan amen God bless you let's stand and take our Bibles here take a little thought I kind of want to kind of build on the dancing sermons I preached and uh go a little bit further here let's go to First Corinthians chapter 14 I want to go start there like to call this one uh um balancing Liberty and the fear of the Lord so I just kind of want to something that we work on constantly but you know bouncing having Liberty of the Holy Spirit and the fear of God so we're always striving to do first Corinthians chapter 14 and verse 33 First Corinthians 14 33. foreign of course we're aware we're in the presence of the Lord today Jesus said wherever two or three gathered there I am in the midst so we know the Lord Jesus is here praise God and we want to hear his voice today Hallelujah and we want to hear the word of God hallelujah nothing more important than hearing the word of God today First Corinthians 14 33. we'll just read this one here and then we'll have you be seated maybe another word of Prayer verse 33 let's read this together if we can one two three for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all the churches of the Saints praise God let's have one more word of prayer here father God we thank you for today Lord God and we've sung your songs Lord God you're all we want Lord God hallelujah we want our souls to be United to your Holy Spirit Lord God quickened hallelujah Made Alive dear God transformed Hallelujah when our minds

so delighted to be able to give this entire day to you thank you for the Lord's Day in the natural Lord God thank you for a day we can just set aside and we can escape Lord all the all the pressures of work Lord we could just come into your house and worship Lord God and enjoy the presence of the Lord what a blessing and so father use me use each and every person Lord God as a body of Believers and we ask the Lord you be glorified in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you you're being seated praise God Hallelujah so I just want to start with this thought you know how God is not the author of confusion Hallelujah and I was actually looking for another verse yeah about how things should be done decently and in order yeah it's verse 40. there it is I want to go down there in the chapter and see if you have your bibles if you just go down to verse we read verse 33 but I'd like to read verse 40. this is of course the chapter on tongues you know I was listening to a few of my recordings this morning and when Lena's sisters were here sage and Jordan uh right before they left we did a bible study on this chapter of course we didn't read all the verses but we read a lot of them um but this is a beautiful chapter you know Church think about you know the day of Pentecost can you imagine you know just if we could just go back there a moment you know thousands of people gathered in Jerusalem thousands of people walk in the city streets at 9am in the morning and all of a sudden you hear these people screaming and shouting and praising the Lord and they come running out of the upper room and the Bible said they're declaring the wonderful works of God and and these people say they're drunk you know they're drunk and whatever it was brother Randolph said they jumped out of the windows now we don't know that they did but let's say they jumped out of the second floor windows then ran down the stairs and I don't think they jumped out of the windows and you know jumped all the way to the ground they probably would have broke a leg or something like that but in other words brother man said they had so much enthusiasm for Jesus they were so bold when the Holy Ghost fell on them praise God they didn't care who heard them praise the Lord they they just wanted to praise the Lord abandoned uh and I just want you to you know go back there when the church was born it was born in the day of Pentecost and everything was decent in order they were speaking in tongues the Bible said the spirit gave them utterance so they were speaking in Galilean but the people were hearing them in their own languages Hallelujah and it was all decent and in order and to the world it looked like they were drunk now a sinner now some of the I'm sorry some of them were Jews rather a lot of them were Jews visiting you know celebrating the Feast of Pentecost uh but these were staunch Jews and and they were no doubt more sober and more this is the worship day and this is the day of the two loaves and we're waving the two loaves and it was more solemn serious type of day but here are some Fanatics they'd say shouting and screaming and praising the Lord hallelujah rejoicing and declaring they're basically preaching on the streets right testifying on the streets praise God with a lot of emotion and that's the way the church was birthed praise God and uh and so you know Paul and this is 80 59. so I believe this is 29 years later Paul's still telling these holy ghost-filled Saints here now this is almost three decades later he's saying make sure you keep everything decent and in order praise God and of course if you read the chapter Paul says at the most two or three tongues and interpretations can go forth in a service now I've been in Services you know brother cam shirts where we had three that's the most I've ever seen now I told you though when I was growing up we had seven in one service or more because I prayed I prayed a prayer to the Lord I still remember this I said Lord I was a teenager I said Lord if you give seven tongues interpretations I'll go up and repent but I fail to do it because I was still ashamed so I broke my promise to God but God gave eight maybe nine maybe ten in that one service it was just a really highly anointed service you know kind of like Wednesday praise God except you know just different you know just a different It's A Channel Of God speaking the tongue and interpretation to the people it was of course of course all general you know it was all General uh but it was calling the people to serve God so that service was out of order when I was raised you know in the denomination but God showed me he was real even in that you know even even the fact they got out of order God was trying to prove his love to me bye um so you know we see we want to find this balance praise God and I believe we do it well but I I believe you know we've got to go towards the more of the Liberty side like Wednesday night you know we have to we have to have more of those you know in the past you've seen me dance around the church maybe a handful of times you know or something like that and that's okay you know like we said dancing in the spirit is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's evidence you got victory unless you're like brothers unless you're trying to put it on or something like that but we're not trying to put it on right we're we just want to be thankful for what God has done hallelujah um but you know we're like we kind of talked about with you know America is different from Ghana America is different from Africa you know uh just a different Nation you know different a culture and so you know we want to have a balance you know in our lives in America As Americans want to have a balance of having more Liberty because America is not so much of a we'd say a free place to have you know dancing and freedom for the lord it's just like they say in Canada too you know it's just not really that way you don't see a lot of people dancing in the North America I was out in South America honestly I honestly didn't see much dance in there either in South America when I've only been there four times I didn't see a lot of dancing there um but you know we wanna how many want to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord so we want to grow as Christians and that's definitely one area we can grow in is having more Liberty I'll say I just more Victory praise God or just maybe the freedom and liberty to express the victory that we enjoy Hallelujah and you know I believe personally too we can we can grow in the in the in the fear of the Lord as well definitely so you can switch over here I do have a few slides I like to show I didn't get all as many done as you know because of the coldness and things like that I didn't get as much time studying as I maybe I wanted to but God knows you know and he always works things out for his glory praise God he always works it out so I want to look at balancing Liberty and the fear Lord both heirs I feel like we can grow in I feel like every area we can grow it yeah I was telling you a few weeks ago like you know God is restoring the church back to the Pentecost of Acts 2. and we're we're on the road praise God we are on the road you know I would say our strengths you know uh as I was sharing with you there you know are with love you know a lot of people come to our church and they feel loved and then a lot of people come to our church and they say what a wonderful teaching this is you know they feel the teaching uh so those are two of our strengths you know we'd say we're we're really we're getting more and close to Pentecost all the time praise God but these are two areas where maybe they wouldn't be our biggest strengths but we want to see them grow Hallelujah we want to have more Liberty in the Holy Spirit and we also want to have more fear of the Lord because the Bible says when ananias and Sapphira died before the Lord the Bible said the fear of the Lord increase on the church in other words there's gonna but yet just months before that they were dancing and shouting in the streets you know so we've got to have a balance praise God in other words we got to recognize seasons of rejoicing but seasons of real sincerity praise God and yes we're sincere when we're rejoicing but there's just there are times of just kind of toning it down and real serious and humble before the Lord praise God and of course Church you know in those times you know uh the prayers will be different you know the prayers if it's in the fear of the Lord you know imagine what they were praying after anania since the fire died imagine what they were praying oh God give us sincere Hearts Let the church be pure amen bring us back to Purity praise God keep all the lies out of the church amen think of the prayers you know God keep us strong keep us in the faith you know uh but then you know think of the prayers we pray after we have rejoicing services oh God give us Soul saved amen hallelujah oh God just uh just pour out your blessings God and just do great things do signs miracles of Wonders you know we we feel so much Liberty to pray Hallelujah I know that's how I was praying at least you know this week by God's grace so you know we want to find this balance you know uh and that's kind of the topics we're looking at here uh by God's grace now a couple of these I didn't get to look up so uh go to First Peter chapter two if I'm not mistaken now these are for memory I didn't get a chance to kind of look at these actual verses up the Bible calls the house of the Lord the house of judgment yes verse 16. first Peter 4 16 please first Peter 4 16. so not only now we've been looking at dancing not only is this a House of Joy it's a house of judgment as well now to me I say like this if God judges me and forgives me then that makes me joyful right another like brother I said I want to be judged now praise God Hallelujah I want God to convince me of my sin I confess my sin he judges my sin now and so that I can rejoicing God again hallelujah amen so it depends how you look at the house of judgment God is in other words he's cleaning out our lives he's he's judging Our Lives now cleaning them out so then we're pure right but it judges The Sinner who leaves or the person that would walk away the make-believer who would walk away or the Judas that would walk away from the message or walk away from Christ and betray Christ the word not all people that leave the message are judases I hope you understand that not all people that they just they never had a revelation of it you know when I've talked to some people like that you know the word they use all the time is learn oh we learned about water baptism or we learned about modesty or we learned church it's more than learning it's a revelation you learn the ABCs right but you don't really get a revelation of the ABCs right right Church I mean but when you got a revelation of God's word there's no demon in hell that can talk you out of it praise God because Jesus said so praise God he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against Revelation amen someone can't leave the water back to the name of Lord Jesus Christ and say they had Revelation they never had it they just had they just had knowledge of it or learning of it but they didn't have a revelation because hell can't shake you from God's word amen the elect cannot be deceived amen Glory Now read this and read that verse for brother Chris in Matthew 16 but first Peter 4 16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on his behalfs anytime you suffer for being a Christian that's when you want to glorify God if you suffer for your own faults well it's hard to glorify God in that but yes you should still praise God in that but we want to we want to live such a life where we don't suffer for wrong so much where God helps us not to do so many wrongs God is teaching us to do what's right praise God Amen now here in verse 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel okay so judgment always begins at the house of the Lord God bless you brother Ray good to see you sir Hallelujah and so the Bible gives us a clue here people that come to church they're the ones that are closest to being saved right so Chris you come to the right place if you want to be saved brother this is the right place amen people are rarely going to be saved outside of a church because the Bible calls it the house of judgment this is where the judgment is given out this is right this is wrong and God you either accept God's word or you turn down God's word but one thing's for sure God's judgments will stand amen and the Bible says judge yourselves lest ye be not judge amen if you judge yourself now so you don't go to the white Throne judgment and God doesn't have to judge your life there it's already been judged amen I let Jesus judge my life every service praise God and Lead Me In Paths of righteousness for his name's sake Verse 18 and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful crater so when you're suffering for doing what's right or when your family persecutes you you just have to suffer through that that's why the Bible said God gives you long suffering praise God you haven't done nothing wrong but yet you're suffering you're being mistreated that's why God gives you long suffering it's the Holy Spirit praise God it's patience amen God gives you anointings who can get through it and you just say I don't know why I'm going through this but I'm committing it in God's hands it's on God's control I know God loves me so I'm going to trust God and I'm going to get through this because I'm committing it to God Amen that's all you can do God doesn't always tell us why we suffer but we just got to trust God and commit it to him and know that if he saved us then there's a purpose for us being saved and if we're still here there's a purpose of us still being here we can still win souls we can still be filled with the Holy Ghost we can still pray for the sick we can still do God's will amen we just don't want to complain we're all going to do it but we just want to keep from it by God's grace and let's say Lord Jesus help me to suffer in silence that's what we used to do in football we used to do all kinds of push-ups and exercises and the coaches like suffer in silence I don't want to hear the oh [Music] I could hear that I can kind of hear their voices right now all those practices that's so heavy he'd say suffer in silence and that's what we ought to do sometimes but then we ought to praise the Lord in suffering too amen like job go to the house of God and bless me in the name of the Lord God gives and God takes away blessed be the name of the Lord praise God so see that we want to find that balance now this scripture is more like the fear of the Lord right judgment begins the house of God then we also know there's joy in the house of the Lord praise God hallelujah there's a lot of that in David's life amen as we looked at on Wednesday night now let's go to Matthew 16. I want to show this for brother uh Chris here by God's grace I mentioned it numerous times twice now in this service here Matthew 16. what a chapter this is my Jesus talks about revelation he heals uh or he Rooks the blind Pharisees he gives the symbol of Leaven and he asked Peter his confession about the Messiah and then after all this then he stands there looks at Peter and says Satan get behind me the man together give the keys to the kingdom too got Anointed with the wrong spirit right of course he wasn't born again but we all know but we even know after he got born again he got the wrong Spirit one time right wouldn't eat with Gentiles so we all need God's grace amen we're all going to be tested we're all going to be tried but God will bring us through we're going to commit Our Lives into his hands Matthew 16. so brother uh Christopher 17 and Jesus answers unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah that means son of Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven so earlier a few verses above Jesus asked Peter who do men say that I am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ you're the Messiah you're the anointed one right you're you're the savior of the Jews right right and Jesus said blessed are your eyes he said because the father has revealed this unto you now look at verse 18. and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock of Revelation he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so Satan cannot stop amen when the father wants to give his child a revelation Satan cannot stop it amen Glory Hallelujah so God wanted to reveal to Chris that Jesus was the Messiah and Satan couldn't stop it hallelujah hallelujah and now brother you you got to take that as a a confirmation no matter what Trials come hell cannot Prevail against me I will always Prevail against the enemy because God set it up that way amen God in other words God gave you a power God Gave You weapons God Gave You tools God gave you a spirit that's more powerful than Satan and hell and darkness amen Amen brother it's helped me all these 22 years I've been serving the lord praise God God's word is true amen Gates of Hell will not Prevail against the revelation of the father hallelujah or you just say General Christianity Hallelujah amen now I want to look up that scripture let's go to I think it's first Timothy thou knowest ought to how to behave thyself like I said these are the couple I didn't get a chance to look up and get the actual reference on them I'm gonna find it here first Timothy yeah first Timothy 3. 15. First Timothy 3 15. I'm just taking my time here I may preach an hour and a half we'll kind of see how it goes by God's grace but like we saw a couple weeks ago it's not going to be four and a half hours like brother Brandon preached Hallelujah unless I'm gonna make a tape or something like that uh First Timothy 3 15. so remember in this chapter Paul lays out here's how here's how you find a pastor he has to do he has to meet all these requirements like the job descriptions like a resume this is what a pastor has to do and then he says here's what a deacon has to be right and then in verse 13 for uh now that's still on deacons let's go down to verse 14. these things right unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if I tarry along that thou mayest know how thou ought us to behave thyself In The House of the house of God which is which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth so Paul tells them here's how a pastor needs to act here's how deacons need to act and this is the conduct of the church praise God apost a pastor is supposed to be hospitable right welcoming you into my home well I do that now hallelujah it's a lot easier to do it now because we got the construction see God makes a way you know God he always makes a way praise God Pastor has to be apt to teach able to teach you right a Deacon's got to be a grave and sober praise God and have the the understanding of God hallelujah he's got to be married pastors got to be married with Children you know all these things and so if you keep this conduct Paul says this is how you'll learn how to behave in the house of the Lord the Bible said follow the faith of the leaders in the church so when I come in the message I follow brother Brooks and brother Samuel and brother Craig the elders in the church and I follow them and I I follow their example they did this and and I didn't know why they did it sometimes but eventually I found it in the Bible oh now I know why they do this oh okay that's the word of God now I understand praise God and so uh I want you to see this that that Paul told them you'll learn how to behave by following the example of the preachers right and the deacons now in our church I'm the pastor and I'm the Deacon so I don't do a whole lot of Deacon work you know other than uh I think the best way I can do it is you know when I'm not preaching I can go around I can help the kids I can open the doors I can I can whisper I can when I'm not preaching I can help people find a chair I've done that before um so uh that's you know kind of just the the kind of state we're in right now praise God so we think we're rejoice in that but we want to have this Liberty of the Holy Spirit praise God now we looked at this on Wednesday where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and then the Bible said if if we're in the spirit of the lord we will behold the glory of God and the glory of God will change us into the image of the word of God in other words the more we look in the Bible the more we'll live like the Bible and I found that to be true praise God the more I preach the message the more I see myself like the bible message praise God my life looks just like the bible message Hallelujah like Paul was a tent maker and yet he was teaching the Gentiles well I see I can go and work a job and I can still teach the people hallelujah I just see it praise God I see it you know everybody's got their certain calling in life you know and we see us growing in Grace and knowledge of the Lord I don't see us getting less like the Bible I see it's getting more like the Bible praise God amen so like my brother amen need a house to live come stay at my house when Austin needs a place to stay come stay at my house praise God when Matt hey I don't know if somebody remember Matt hey I let him come live at my house for a little while praise God that's how we should be we should be a family praise God uh yeah amen who I let sister Lina come and stay right see that's that's godliness praise God that's that's the right thing to do praise God we're a family I told brother Chris I said brother if you get persecution you can come stay with me for a while right because that's what we ought to do we're supposed to rescue our our Christian family from from uh from destruction right yeah yeah supposed to help them out praise God so we should see our lives being more conformed to the book of Acts all the time amen glory that's right amen because that's the message of the hours restoring the book of Acts Church praise God that's the message Hallelujah restoring the book of Acts now remember Liberty though was uh living as we ought to not as we please in other words when you're under Liberty you're free to do what God wants you to do and you're free to not be a slave to sin praise God you're free from your sin addictions amen that's what it is hallelujah that's that's being free in Christ I'm free to obey him I'm not bound by chains of addiction I'm not bound by bad habits I'm free from that now I'm in the spirit of Liberty because I'm free from sin praise God hallelujah thank God I have the Liberty to Omit things that have no relationship to the Bible that's my Liberty Hallelujah that's your Liberty praise God so in other words like I was talking with my brother Paul I said we have the power of no we don't have to do everything people ask us to do if it goes against the word of God just say no sorry I don't believe that praise God right because I'm I'm under Liberty I have the freedom to Omit that I don't have to go to that certain restaurant I have to go to that certain bar I certainly don't have to go to any sinful place there I have the Liberty say no that doesn't build up my faith that might be a temptation right we ask our Liberty to do what we ought to do instead of what we pleased to do like the flesh we're pleased to do now we looked at this again in the Liberty Roberto did you ever get that much Liberty to dance around the church praise God I know Austin got it praise God I know Chris got it one time amen do you ever get that haven God that praise God all those little girls got it Hallelujah got the Liberty the Holy Spirit praise God did you ever get that much Liberty praise God I think that's a great question amen hallelujah thank God and I like what I want to just want to read this you know what brother man said church when you got the holy ghost or you love God you ought to be exuberant about the gospel you ought to just be thankful Hallelujah God I could come to church and serve the Lord praise God see just as the world see the Christian ought to be Joseph Zuber and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights and its pleasures like last night I was getting gas at 10 pm because I had to come here to the church and do some work you know with the heat and everything but I was getting gas I looked over and I see it was called the dog pound van these people so this this person they decorate their entire van like they're going up to the Cleveland football game today and they're going to go sleep up there and they had uh they had a grill connected to the back of it I think and it's got Browns painted all over I thought well that is a whole Unholy roller right there but at least they're a fanatic for that's their pleasure they're all bundled up at night and they're getting ready to go up and travel up there and they're going to sleep at the stadium get up in the morning and they're going to grill all morning and the whole day is going to be to worshiping the Cleveland Browns ah but our whole day praise God hallelujah our whole day is given over to worship Jesus praise God and I get just I get more pleasure than they get in the house of God hallelujah and when we see Soul saved like brother Chris amen when we see hostelina return When God answers our prayers amen when God heals the sick and God does great things I'm I have even more joy than they have amen my Joy's lasting my Joy's real it's unspeakable and full of Glory praise God their Joy May fade Because by the time halftime comes they're going to lose the game but our team is never going to lose Malachi Jesus is always going to win amen whether we're halfway through the church age or in the fourth quarter Jesus is going to win brother Hallelujah and I'm always on the winning team amen hallelujah thank God Amen I'm always on the winning team thank you Jesus yeah we both got emotions there's one difference though my heart and emotion is on the Lord and his love and I do not satisfy the flesh Glory that's a great difference between us and the world they will satisfy the flesh they're cooking brats right now and cramering down Coronas and all these things and here I am I'm feasting on the word of God I'm getting drunk in the spirit praise God Amen thank God Amen Hallelujah I'm drinking my new wine as well praise God it was really it's old wine it's really an old wine from the day of Pentecost amen but you understand we're both we're both Fanatics amen glory and we ought to be just as excited about Jesus as they are about their worldly things [Laughter] ah thank God Amen thank you Jesus amen Hallelujah may I always be a fanatic for Christ amen help me to always be a fanatic for Christ a Holy Roller amen hallelujah praise God amen God help me not to get cold on you help me not to get starchy and stiff and cold and Afraid help me to be free amen help me to have faith help me to have confidence help me to give you glory that is due to your name help my spirit to be clean give me a clean heart brother that's a beautiful song give me a fresh spirit give me something real sober and serious yet full of the joy of the Lord that's just brother Branham says that's just the whole of the Christian Life right there when John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day brother said that's just the whole of the Christian Life right there being in the spirit Hallelujah and when we come to church that'll be the time we're in the spirit praise God Amen if we're bowing all week May God help us to get in the Holy Spirit while we're in the house of God Amen not to waste an opportunity but to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah or church like on Wednesday your worship takes over a stooped over individual and makes them prior makes them makes them thankful and makes them hopeful for the future the energy of the Holy Spirit or the love of God in the building take somebody who's cranky all the time and puts a smile on their face that's right that's just like the sunlight when the sunlight hits a flower when it's all drooped over what does it do it curls up it stands straight up that's what God is doing in his Vineyard today praise God hey man it's fresh hallelujah it's giving us life amen it's parking us up it's making a shot it's making us manifest the glory of God Amen Hallelujah I want to get to this eventually but I just want to read this over when brother Rams rededicating the Tabernacle he says of course somebody works from the Lord that's expected that's what it should be that's what you're here for is to Worship the Lord and if you and just if you feel like praising God or shouting just go right on Hallelujah you feel like shouting just go right on if you like screaming go right on if you like dancing go right on praise God because that's what you're here for you're not here to get beaten and bullied and you know that's not why you're here the holy spirit's here yes to correct you but then to give you hope for a future praise God to give you an expected End Amen Hallelujah because the Bible said God has so many thoughts toward you praise God you see then go right on because that's what you're here for is to Worship the Lord in your own way of worshiping see your your way doesn't have to be like mine you don't have to dance but I tell you sure we'll give you some victory praise God you're really missing out on some victory Hallelujah yes amen that's right you got to find your way to worship I tell you don't worship by being depressed that's not how we worship Nobody worships by being depressed Nobody worships by complaining hello Church Nobody worships by falling asleep I feel it now brother [Laughter] I feel it now right that's not how you worship you won't find that in the Bible on the day of Pentecost they all got one Accord and took a nap that's not what the Bible says the Bible said they declared oh they declared the wonderful works of God is in he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful he died for me he rose for me he saved my soul he Sanctified me fill me with the Holy Ghost isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful oh Nobody worships by sleeping Hallelujah now are you going to battle to sleep yeah you're going to battle but God made you to fight the good fight of Faith Hallelujah got to overcome that brother man said there's nobody worship so I pass the notes now he's talking to teenagers that would pass notes in his Services because that's in that's in the context of the quote he said when you're passing notes and distracting people from worshiping he says you're helping get somebody away from the worship of the Lord so you see we got to come to church say I'm going to worship God the way God made me to worship like I could try as hard as I want to get on the guitar and worship like brother amen it ain't going to happen I mean maybe I could learn Jesus loves me this I know maybe they take a couple years though but like he has a way to worship Church you have a way to worship too and we want to do everything we can to help other people worship God but don't come by worshiping is not criticizing people it's not being mad at amen because he didn't sing your song or mad at brother Jessica's he didn't preach what you wanted to hear preached that's that's not how you Worship the Lord that's not helping anybody worship right I'm not saying we do that I'm just giving examples you know let's give an example most people I look out and they're smiling at me most of the time you know I'm smiling at you most the time you know where's the family you know we go through ups and downs highs and lows mountains and valleys praise God but we're a family by God's grace and the blood makes us a family praise God forgives all of our trespasses praise God see and remember brother man dance in the sanctuary now I want to just remind you that he danced in his own sanctuary after calling it a disgrace so we also got to be open to this if my mind is wrong about something then Lord correct my thinking right correct me if I'm wrong help me not to sit in the seat of the scornful now I just wanted this real real briefly remember I preached two sermons on the fear of the Lord so what does the fear lord it's an anointing of the Holy Spirit it's your moral reverence in other words you honor God it's not cutting up or silliness or anything like that now the diff now it's kind of different right it's kind of close like silliness is kind of close to Joy right because in both cases we're laughing and praising Lord but it's not silly it's Joy right it's just oh thank you Jesus feels so wonderful I feel so free I want to praise God with my whole body Hallelujah but it's not like oh let's do a whirly dance or something like that right so it's both right it's we're bouncing Liberty and the fear of the Lord hallelujah fear of the Lord is your confidence in God when you're when you're obeying God you have confidence in God the fear of the Lord is your Refuge it's a prerequisite for wisdom which which the Bible says is the main thing get wisdom with all thy getting get wisdom fear the lord is your Fountain of Life amen it's your choice you have a choice to fear the lord or not today it's also your conclusion about your purpose in life now you know nobody here should go and say what's my purpose in life it's the fear God it's very simple fear God and keep the commands brother Chris that's what the Bible says it's the whole conclusion of of what your life's purpose is and as you fear God brother as we fear God as we morally reverence God God opens up all the doors of Our Lives he closes the wrong doors he opens the right doors as you walk with him we just have to fear Him respect his word honor his word and it'll open up every door fear the lord is your lesson to be learned it's your path to blessings and it's your path to praise oh thank God Amen see like I said you know a person who's who's guilty of sin and haven't hasn't confessed and how are they going to dance for the Lord that shows the nominations of dance they're probably already in sin it shows they're not really dancing with the fear of the Lord they're just dancing for actual physical pleasure and you can see in the way they dance sometimes they don't even dance they know these crazy dances like I tried I tried to show you on Wednesday but the Lord cut that off so it seem like I just want to give you some concrete examples but see as we fear God as we respect his word every day and say say Lord teach me today Lord I'm drawing closer to you today then God will give us the fear of the Lord and that will give us a reason to praise hallelujah it's your path to praise if you want to praise God if you want to worship God fear the Lord hallelujah keep his commands the fear of the Lord is to hate evil and depart from every Wicked way praise God see that's how you'll that's how you have enough joy to dance or praise the Lord or sing or shout or scream or whatever you want to do roll on the floor whatever you want to do praise God that's how you get the victory of it is confessing all your sin getting all sinned under the blood of Jesus and then you know in heaven you're totally forgiven praise God so we want to begin our services we want to begin our worship in the fear of the Lord and then we want to like this this service today we want to begin it in the fear of God and they want to see how the Holy Ghost is going to move is it going to bring us to a repentance service like a couple Wednesdays ago we had some good prayer up here for repentance you know people want to draw closer to God remember that that's like that the Holy Ghost we might have started happy and joyful but it moved to repentance it's actually when I preach on the fear of the Lord the first time and church I never know which way it's going to go that first time I was preaching on the fear Lord I thought man this is the heart this is a pretty hard service here I wonder if anybody's saying amen I wonder if anybody's like Lord did I miss your calling and then after the service like five or six people come up from prayer we're screaming praising and shouting giving God the glory it was just I just never really know I'm not God you know but we got to watch how the Holy Ghost is moving praise God everything must be done decently and in order and the fear of the Lord we're like how about rejoicing who would have thought last Wednesday would have been the greatest service our some of our girls had been in who would have thought it went a Wednesday night in December it's cold and we had the heat off see God just does things when he wants to do it praise God how about the healing service from Brother Johnny's foot got healed it was all swollen I can still see today so massive and he said the Lord revealed to him if I prayed for that and cursed that swelliness he'd be made well and the next day he was like 90 better by Tuesday it was 100 well now when I prayed for that I didn't have the same confidence because that Revelation wasn't mine but I had hope I didn't have a revelation he was going to get well because it wasn't revealed to me but I joined my faith that I had and my hope I joined that in there and God answered praise God it's also good to know too brother Brandon remember I think I told this to Naomi she asked about it in a Sunday School she asked about is it okay to have healing services and different yeah different services for different needs of course and I thought that's a great question brother bramwood he would he would literally ask the people if you heard on tape how many won a healing service and the hands would go up I mean there's a Congregation of 200 and there's like probably 100 people sick there you know think about our church that's a lot of sick people in the church yet they still came to church I'm not telling you to come spread your diseases I'm not coming to tell you to do that but you know maybe that different uh different infirmities but see you know next time like I think a member last brother amen got so sick you know with coven maybe we should add a healing service you know so I'm just like now going forward for the future right if we see Jose stay sick or God forbid but you know if we see people getting sick let's have it I'll just preach Divine Healing and then you know for people that can come you know if the sick people can't come we'll just pray for those who are here and they'll stand in for prayer you know so I think that's a good that's a good way to go see we just we start with the fear of God and which way is the holy spirit going to move today intercession remember we prayed for Lena's mom that's a great service Wednesday night again Satan get out Satan get out Jesus Jesus just a powerful service I didn't know it was going to end like that nobody knew but that was a we spent extra time prayer my hands are I was holding Austin's hands so hard and Lena's hands they heard after after the prayer it's like a 20 or 15 or 20 minute prayer my hands hurt Edwards because we're squeezing so hard praying it was intercession and Jesus came down and Vindicated that praise God so you never know how the spirit's going to move the other services there might be for boldness or for building your faith or I could name lots of them you're like any any attribute over there you know the Holy Spirit could bring someone to whatever they have need of for that service so we want to watch it we want to begin with the fear of God I want to read a couple quotes here I just like this one because I'm talking about getting Victory and brother random said I never saw dancing in the spirit get out of order okay oh you say I can't see these things I don't believe in shouting I don't believe in speaking in tongues I don't believe in Divine Healing it just shows you never got the victory that's why they don't believe in it because they've never been there they never seen tongues and they never seen uh shouting they never seen a reason to dance the reason they don't believe is because they never experience it if only they would yield and enjoy the experience of it praise God thank God we've had the experience praise God Hallelujah we can believe because we've experienced it praise God and God wants us to have those experiences just shows you never had it that's right but one time you get the victory then you got it that's right yes sir then you can shout you've seen one time I used to think about dancing in the spirit see somebody standing dance in the spirit now I've seen the mockery put on of it but I've seen the real thing see some people mock it like I was saying with denominations they dance for Jesus and they go home and the women cut their hair the men smoke and drink and commit adultery and watch porn that's that's wickedness that's a mockery of the Holy Spirit but brother Adam says if you dance and shout and you live right he said that's all right he said I believe in that praise God Amen Hallelujah that's the liberty of the Holy Spirit he said so I come to find out why people dance in the spirit or why could people dance in the spirit I've never seen one get out of the way I've never seen one act immorally I always see it just as decently and in order and sweetness and even Sinners run to the Altar and get saved when it's going on well I wondered why it was and I come to find out it's victory and we dance on Wednesday and that brother got saved and baptized on yesterday by God's grace I thought that's a good it's a good follow-up by God's grace he said David danced before the Lord when the ark was brought back to its resting place amen when David saw the word as it was then with the tables of stone brought back to its original Place David rejoiced and dance in the spirit around and around and around why he saw the word back in his place what the world or I'm sorry what uh what the word needs is not some old Seminary some theological mix-up but an old-fashioned godsend preacher behind the pulpit with the word of God seeing God vindicate it proof yes then David said glory to God this is it and around and around his little stuck up wife's set up over there being the King's Daughter said why he embarrasses me and David said you don't like that watch this and around and around he went again oh yes oh my what a time he had you know God looked down from heaven said David you're a man after my own heart see see what he had done lost all his bride he done lost all of his pride hallelujah amen hallelujah see now we see Sin Sin keeps us from dancing sin keeps us from honoring God with our entire body sin keeps you from raising your hands sin keeps you from shouting Pride keeps you those things but when you confess your pride and you're all humble God can use you however he wants to use you amen hahaha he looked down and said that's a man after my own heart praise God that's my boy right there Hallelujah he didn't look at Michael and say oh that's my starchy stiff stuck up daughter no he said I'm going to curse that woman right he said but I'm looking at the one who worshiped me with all their heart soul mind and strength That's My Boy amen Hallelujah he knowed he was acquainted with the possessor of heavens and earth Church and here was the word of God coming right back among them again and David was so happy he danced he just danced as hard as he could Hallelujah it goes into Miriam he said oh when she's seen the enemies that had tormented her see when you see your tormentors dead then she danced in the spirit that's right now see after the after the battles won the glory of God comes down amen amen like I said church if you got a testimony then you ought to come to church and share that testimony and then you ought to give God some type of expression of Thanksgiving like I said when I said when Austin gets out of debt I'm gonna dance around the church and I dance around the church praise God Hallelujah because I want to make sure God knows how much I appreciate what he's done for us praise God that's right the church the main thing I do is lose all of our pride that's the main thing Hallelujah the battle's won the glory of God comes down oh it's beautiful now I want to say brother Brown said in the Ephesian Church age when they left their first love there was going to become a subtle group of preachers that would take over with false doctrines I believe we don't have hardly any false Doctrine as far as I know I just want to be humble by saying that if I say I have all the true Doctrine well then I'm making myself God right if I say I've got all right Doctrine well I think I'm what am I Jesus or something like that of course not so all of us have room to grow brother man said bye brother said watch the man who says he's got all the answers I said because that guy he's prideful right that's right praise God and so brother man said there's going to come a group of preachers in and they're gonna uh they would exclude the people from any part of Holy Ghost spirit ministry that's why I'm glad so many people got involved on Wednesday night whether at your chair or here you know everybody's supposed to be a part of the Holy Spirit Worship but see evil preachers will limit the people and keep them from the real Liberty of the Holy Spirit now look even in brother Ramsay even today among those who claim to be free and for the Holy Spirit I mean how many free how many follow the Holy Spirit there's not too much freedom in the lady yet everybody says they're free right but he's talking about the churches in those days and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching how do you know it's inspired because it discerns the thoughts and Tents of your heart that's I know it's inspired it's a word and due season how pleasant it is praise God amen yeah that's why I know that sermon I preached on Wednesday was in due season because everybody got into it right it was the Holy Spirit but not every service is a dancing service you know that I know that so brother I said I see a few preachers who actually preach inspired while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it so see I don't want to be an absorber I don't want to be trying to absorb I actually want to be inspired I'm trying to understand no I don't want to be that I want to be I understand I'm inspired I'm free praise God I'm free and full of the spirit I'm not trying to be free I'm not trying to understand how do I get Deliverance or I want to be delivered praise God and then when I'm free that I can praise God hallelujah my God Amen this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the Leaning of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship this is see this is where we're going back to church this is where we're going back to everybody in the church has a leading of the Lord that's what Paul said if the whole church become together one place and all speak with tongues and they're coming those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that you're mad but if all prophesy and they're coming one that believes not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus listen the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth so that's what we desire and that church that's why we need to pray more for services when guests come like Chris or now these are part of the family of God or like jakori we when we see visitors here that's a time we really need to pray I mean we should pray it all the time but when you see someone who's new that's when we should pray and say God reveal their Seekers to them so they know you're here praise God that is just out of church service it's a meeting with God hallelujah Hallelujah it's exactly right that's what it was and in every in every situation you know God revealed uh the unknown handwriting on the wall to belshazzar revealing the secrets praise God Jesus with the gets a discernment revealing the thoughts and intents of Nathaniel's Heart Right the woman at the well praise God Peter's heart Jesus was constantly and that's a proof that Christ isn't the man say Amen oh thank God how many times have I seen him praise God all the time praise God and church you don't have to be me it can be you after the service going to pray for somebody remember brother Diggs testimony there was that woman in the back and she said God if you're really in this have brother Diggs come give me a high five she was in the very back and brother Diggs was in the front and bro dick said he was just moved by the Holy Spirit went back there and gave her a big high five and she started screaming and got the victory got Deliverance over some type of a bondage or something like that see that's a prayer she prayed in her heart nobody heard it except God Amen and then God answer that prayer praise God see that's what we want we want to we want the people to experience so much of God that they fall down and say God is in this place and then they'll keep coming back praise God just like you just like me praise God how is it then brother when you come together everyone you have to assume have the doctor and have the tongue half the Revelation hath interpretation let all things be done unto edify so see church this is what we can come we can come to church with a song we can come to church with a Doctrine right we can come to church with a tongue we can come to church with a revelation with interpretation we should all come to participate in the worship of God I'll never forget in here when I preached I've shared this before I was preaching on Saul and David years ago probably 2016 2017. we moved in here in late 2015. but there was this visitor I didn't no idea who he was I was just preaching on my regular notes I preached on the life of Saul and how he was backslidden and then he was uh uh he suffered all I just went through all of Saul's sufferings and the man was a grandfather a young grandfather but a man a grandfather nonetheless and after service in that parking lot he pulled me aside and said brother Jesse you preached my entire life I'm Saul everything you preach about Saul was me he said now I'm going to jail because I abused a certain certain person he said pray for me so I pray for him and later years later I saw him he finally got out of jail and he was trying to serve God again but that's that's the Holy Spirit I'm just in my regular routine of trying to finish a series but then God steps in there praise God how the hell you praise God or that five identifications when sister Marie was bleeding and I preached on the five identification of the true church one of them is these signs follow them that believe praise God as you come right up and God stop the bleeding right away praise God well the last time I preached on the fear of the Lord remember me shared that good testimony you know everything in the sermon was just exactly what you need to hear see that's how we know God is among us because God speaks to us God knows our troubles he knows our trials but he's here to deliver us amen ah so every one of us can come to church with some anointing remember when you struggled Lydia and then sister Naomi says to beat your sister who I prayed for you that was beautiful when you had that Revival brother when you had that Revival remember you come remember when you come up and laid hands on me I don't know if I share this with the church but I was really struggling that morning just with you know battles and unbelief and when you laid your hands on me I just it just set me free right there I was like what do I preach I didn't I didn't tell you yeah that's the first time I just thought of it now I didn't plan to say that you know I remember I was like man this guy's coming in here he's all crying he's my name is all on fire and I'm like Hallelujah it just broke me out of the thing I was battling praise God it's the anointing that breaks the yolks amen Hallelujah thank God I don't have to be a shouting anointing all the time I know I shout a lot you know I pay for it later don't don't you worry about that I pay for it later but you know many times we see it in sincerity but Amanda says you want to get closer to God he said be more sincere he said you must be more sincere in the third poll in other words the speaking of the word the revelation of the word gotta be more sincere so I try to be as sincere as I possibly can praise God now I've read this one before but how many would like to have a real Bible Church a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything make and manifest just exactly the way it should be wouldn't that be wonderful now you're going to have to sacrifice not money you're gonna have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're gonna have to sacrifice some time in prayer you're gonna have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility how much Jesus amen to break down in humility just say God help me just to do what the Bible says to do you're going to have the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily is that right how often do we have to sacrifice brother every day Paul said he died daily every day he died now Church there's no Bible verse that says we have to have all nine gifts of the Spirit I've seen all of them operate in one time or another but there's no Bible verse brother and believe they should be in every church but then if you go to 63 questions answers brother says we don't have all the gifts in the church and he doesn't make a big deal of it he doesn't rebuke the people because gifts are a major or minor ah you pass the test good job pass the first quiz the first question of the day you pass it gifts are a minor the major is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right salvation those are the majors praise God Divine Healing is a minor right but there's times the miners need to be played out right there's times we need Divine Healing Services there's times we need dancing services Hallelujah we need though we need all these praise God we need the whole Orchestra of God's word we need the whole uh sheet music of God's word to be beaten out praise God so why so we can say I'm one of them praise God I know what today in Pentecost is like I also know what you know uh the suffering of John was like I know the suffering of what Paul had but I also know the glory of the Resurrection amen hallelujah I know him in the powers resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings so we got to know both we got to have the balance right we've got to have Liberty and we got to have fear of the Lord we've got to have the resurrection power we also got to have suffering none of us went suffering but sorry you already signed up for it me too now honestly I didn't get a chance to go through too many of these scriptures here but I'm going to actually look for this file real quick this is the one kind of like a last minute thought I wanted to add in here so just bear with me uh here's there's two things that we want to do especially for brother Chris here as he's learning you know as a new Christian When We Gather rather there's two main things we want to set our mind on we're going to set our mind on the Saints in the church God's people and we want to set them on heaven because David said here's a man after God's Own Heart the same guy that danced around same guy that shouted with all his might dance with all of his might he said I have set my affection to the house of my God I have of my own proper good of gold and silver which I have given to the house of God in other words I paid my tithes and I'll tell you church he gave a lot of offerings now I'm not asking you for offerings I'm just telling you he was a man after God's Own Heart praise God and he wanted to build the house of God over and above all that I prepared for the Holy House in other words the more you have the more you give so his love was for the house of God our love is for the house of God because we want to provoke Chris as a new Christian also I want to provoke brother Vang and brother Austin and brother amen and brother where's brother Malachi he'll be back in here soon brother Ray I want to provoke Brother Ray I want to provoke all the brothers unto more love and good works in other words I want to stir them up am I talking to them I want to stir them up and just go do something for Jesus whatever God's called you to do you figure out what God you pray God God will open the door for you but I want that's we come together I love God's house because I want to go there and I want to help brother amen to be the best song leader he can be the best preacher he can be Hallelujah Glory see I love God's house because I want to go strengthen God's people and I'm not going to forsake the Saints the Bible said don't forsake there's something you ever seen so Chris don't let don't let anything ever get into your way from coming to church so if your car breaks down or something like that you call me I'll come pick you up Hallelujah we never want to miss church if possible unless we're sick and we feel led to stay home because the Bible says that's what the manner of Sinners is Right some is but we don't want to do that we want to exhort which means to speak positive words to build people up we want to exhort one another and so much the more as you see that day approaching oh thank God that's why we're having Church on Friday night praise God that's why we're gonna have church in two Saturdays on the New Year's Eve service Hallelujah we want to gather more as you see that day approaching we already gather together more than most churches we have three every week most people just have two a week but that's my faith and then we have Bible studies right brother sometimes we have Bible studies and that's wonderful there's Seasons where we go through that given more time to the house or we have fellowships on Saturdays or Hallelujah and we need to go gather more as we see Jesus's Rapture approaching so see we have we set our affections on the house of God and I love what brother Brown says here he says we set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the holy ghost coming among us overshadowing us empowering us with gifts signs wonders and miracles why it's the closest thing to Heaven There is on Earth amen that's why David loved going to church it was the closest thing he said I love to go I love to inquire of God I love to ask God I love to have God answer my questions I love to worship God it's the closest thing to Heaven you ever find is God's house amen Hallelujah think about it you've been so close to the houses of hell when you were a sinner right right because you felt Austin's the same name I say Amen there's times we've actually felt evil we felt demonic powers and we were so close to hell but here we come to the house of God and now by God's grace we're not far from God we're drawing closer to God and this is the closest we ever feel to Heaven is into the presence of Jesus Christ and Christ in his people praise God like there's been times of the past but Amy and I have had personal talks and we've been weeping and crying and that's like those are some of the most holy moments of Our Lives when we're totally sincere totally transparent or we're dancing like those are some of the happiest times of hey look your brother Chris is dancing awesome we're dancing it's just it's joyful or see when I saw Haven run around the church I thought yeah yeah Hallelujah there's joy in the house of the Lord praise God the closest thing there is to heaven on Earth is coming to church but then the Bible says also so set your affection on the house of God make sure you love God's worship more than anything else and then also set your mind on Heavenly things if you're risen in Christ Chris has now risen in Christ because he died in Christ baptism now he's risen in Christ if you're risen in Christ seek those things which are above what the commands from heaven where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above see we don't want to set our affections on things of the Earth because they'll disappoint us we want to set our affection on things above not on things on the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God Oh what a beautiful scripture now before we get to that get your Bible I want to read a couple more verses here I'll go to Psalm 5 verse 7. uh yeah because I don't I don't want to switch over so Psalm 5 verse 7. okay Psalm five or seven uh Lydia you want to read down amen so come to church remembering God's multitude of mercies toward you in other words come to church thankful that you can actually come and fear worship God in the fear that's why we start the services with the fear of the Lord God is here God is present Lord Jesus help me to honor your help me to respect your name help me to obey everything I come in the fear of the Lord go to Psalm 77 13 Psalm 77 13 and Emma when you're there you can read it sister Psalm 77 13. amen God's way in other words God's will for your life you'll find it right here in the house of God right don't listen all those Guru guys out there they might have a little bit of Truth you know I listen a lot of those productivity guys how to find your things you find God's way right here in the house of God yeah they can say nice things but nothing is above God's word go to Psalms 100 verse 4. Malachi can you read that Psalm 100 verse 4. that's why no matter the situation come into God's house and give Thanksgiving to God that's a part of our worship it's Malachi whenever you're ready amen praise God and so we do that by the grace of the Lord oh my there's so many good ones here um go to the New Testament uh Hebrews 13 15. Hebrews 13 15 and sister who would that be okay could you read that Hebrews 13 15. I see you do a good good job turning your Bible there Hallelujah 13 15. yeah whatever you're ready amen so see that's why you know as we sing say thank you Jesus praise the Lord that's why you'll see me say hallelujah praise the Lord hold that's why I'll say let's all say praise the Lord you know that's what we're commanded to do all right it's the word of God that's your sacrifice praise God right we don't praise him enough so I want to make sure we get here we get some extra Praises in praise God none of us praise him enough but we're going that way by God's grace we're trying to grow in that in the knowledge of the Lord now there's a couple more go back to the Old Testament I just want to do two more psalm 92. 13-14 Psalm 92 13-14 brother van could you read that buddy when you get that Psalm 92 13 and 14. there it is yes sir 92 13-14 whenever you're ready brother no rush amen Hallelujah do you want a fruitful life brother if you do then you gotta plant be planted in the house of God so the Bible gives two of those directions right you're either a planted here like that plant back there or you're a pillar like one of these walls right here right these studs in the walls right here the Bible calls them both in other words I'm always in the house of God Hallelujah I'm either a plant or I'm one of these pillars right here you kind of see them you can kind of see them here two before is there I want to be one of those in the house of God I want to be planted the house of God I want to be a pillar in the house of God now the last one before I move on is Psalms 89 7. Psalm 89 7. Haven you want to read that hun you're getting there Psalm 89 7. now here's where this is why when we come in I'm going to get into this now this church order and this will be the last thing I preach on here uh that's why we come in here we try not to talk when we come in here because we want to start in the fear of the Lord and making sure everything is on all of our thoughts are on God we're here to worship and then we'll see which Avenue the Holy Spirit takes us so even when you're ready Psalm 89 verse 7. amen greatly to be feared so we've got to go back to day of Pentecost or shortly after ananis and Sapphira died shortly thereafter because they lied to a preacher and we're supposed to be going back to that right and so we want to have that type of respect in other words I want to come to church and I want to say God forgive me of all my sins as I come in here and as a preacher I would say Lord if somebody didn't confess it anoint me to preach or anoint somebody else to expose sin so they can confess it praise God right because we don't want sin Among Us sin is like leaven it'll spread it's like a canker it's like a disease it's like cancer we don't want cancer we want a healthy spiritual body praise God now there's so much more there's a whole bible study on this brother we could do I got probably got 40 or 50 verses here I did this one years and years ago back in 2006 I did a whole bible study on this but let's read this here and we'll try to try to get ready to close after this it's a long quote but so now in the building I think that we ought to have this it's been dedicated or going to be dedicated a few minutes to the worship of God we should keep it that way we should never buy or sell in the building we should never do any business in this Auditorium here it should never be done in here that is such as permitting ministers that come in and sell books and everything no matter what it is there's other places to do that we shouldn't buy and sell in the house of the Lord it should be a place of worship wholly consecrated for that purpose and that's why brother Chris I don't sell any of those books they're all free just take whatever you want the thing to do is take them and read them praise God don't let them collect dust at your house read them praise God that's the thing to do see now he's given us a nice place let's dedicate to him and dedicate ourselves with it to him and now this may seem a little rude but it's not a place to visit it's a place of worship now this is pretty extreme here but you know everybody has their different leading we should never even murmur a word inside here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary right so little girls you know sometimes during second service or before second service you know the girls as we're up here you know sometimes we gotta whisper to find our seats but I was going to do I'm gonna do a Bible study I'm gonna do the full Bible study for our Sunday school girls we got to make sure like we don't talk too much right and why why are we doing that because we're calming our Spirits down so we can hear the voice of God so we can worship God so I'm not here uh to show Haven what I drew and I like Haven's drawings but I'm not here to see Haven's drawings give them to me and she gives them to me after church well she used to now she's getting a little older for that I should probably use Karis or definitely Victoria's really getting good at drawing where's she oh yeah I've got letters from you know virtue and nature too but see we should try not at the beginning of service we should try not even to whisper or anything unless we absolutely have to because we want to greatly fear God in the Assembly of the Saints see we should never rally around or never run through the building or let our children run through the building now that doesn't mean running in the spirit like we did I believe in that but it means just treating this like any old room it's not any old room God is greatly to be feared in the Assembly of the Saints therefore dedicating ourselves let's remember when we enter that Sanctuary keep still to one another and worship God if we want to visit each other there's places we may visit each other like that but never walking around where you can't hear yourself think and some person come in they just don't know what to do see it's so much noise in things it's just humanly see people are talking how are you going to pray and talk to God lord lord speak to me Lord just help me to set me free through the music you know how are we going to talk to God if everybody's talking around here you're not you're gonna be distracted what is he saying what happened yesterday that has nothing to do with God right now you know what you bought at Walmart has nothing to do with yesterday and I said that has nothing to do with today praise God it's worship you want to be in a spot where you can hear yourself talking to God and I've seen it in churches until it's made me feel real bad because we do not come into the sanctuary of the Lord to meet each other we come here to worship God then go to our homes this extra this Sanctuary is dedicated to worship stand outside talk anything you wish as long as it's right and holy go to one another's homes visit one other places but when you enter that door brother says be quiet because that's what the Bible says you come here to talk to him and I love this and let him talk back to you that's called communion Church the trouble of it is what does the church we do I do we all do too much talking and don't listen enough then when we come in here wait on him now in the old Tabernacle there might not been one person present this morning that was there on the day of the dedication when major Ulrich played the music and I stood behind three crosses here to dedicate this place I would not permit anybody now look here's how brother RAM used to run his church you know before the tapes the ushers stood at the door to see that nobody talked so if you talk somebody will walk up and say what if I did that I could do that because the Bible says we're supposed to fear God greatly in the Assembly of the Saints I could do that but I haven't chosen to do that I wasn't raised in that some people like brother Kevin Arnett he said they were raised that way in Peregrine's church so with Brother Ray George and Lorraine yes sir and so there's different there's different uh leadings they're different operations same Holy Spirit so my leadership has always been just lead by example somebody's talking in here and they're the only one talking pretty soon they're gonna be like why am I the only one talking why is everybody else praying but I could I have the right as a pastor just just tap everyone's shoulder and say no talking we don't talk in the house of the Lord if you desire here's our love if you desire to silently come to the Altar and pray silently now sometimes I pray out loud right you walk back to your seat open up your Bible what your neighbor done that's up to him so you shouldn't be sharing notes or hey look at this and look at that unless you've got thus saith the Lord or something like that you had nothing to say if you want to talk to him say I'll see you outside in here I'm here to Worship the Lord you read his word or set quietly and then the music sister Gertie I don't know whether she's here or not this morning sister gives the old piano I believe set back in the corner of the best of my remembrance and then she would play softly down at the cross where am I see and then some real sweet soft music and then until it came time for the service and the song leader got up and let a couple of congregational songs and then if you had some outstanding solo they would sing it but never just a bunch of carrying on and then the music continually played and then when I heard that I know that it was my time to come out as a pastor when a minister walks into the congregation of people praying in the anointing of the spirit you're bound to hear from Heaven praise God oh Hallelujah it's a reality that's what I want to walk when I open that door I want to walk out here and know that people been praying singing worshiping God and they're ready to hear God's word and I'm ready to preach it amen amen remember we're going to have some church praise God Amen Hallelujah well we could have it too you know we could have it all the time he said but if there's no there's no way to keep from it see because the Bible says if you draw an eye to God what he's going to draw an eye to you but if you walk into confusion then you're so confused the spirit's grieved we don't want that no we want to come here to worship we have lovely homes that I'm going to speak on in just a minute so forth at home where we listen we visit our friends and take them this is the house of the Lord and then many times teenage children sometimes adults will get to you know young people will pass notes or cut up something in church now you're old enough to know better than that you should know better than that you shouldn't come in here if you expect to be a real man someday and raise a family to the kingdom of God then start it off at the beginning you see and act right and do right now the Usher stands at the corners of the buildings and so forth and if any carried on they're ordained as their Duty and trustee sat here in the front that in case of someone get getting misbehaving their commissioned to ask the person to be quiet now earlier this year somebody uh I'm not going to say who in particular but somebody had a device that was kept going off and after it went off of three times I'm like okay well I gotta go talk to them I said your device is going off and they said well they didn't know how to set it and thankfully it was it was an Apple device so I knew how to turn it off you know if it was Android I'm not sure if I would have known how to do that but um but that was my job as the Deacon I wasn't preaching that morning or maybe I was I don't know I can't remember but the point was like if it goes off once okay that's but it keeps going off and then I've got to do something about it um the same thing with talking or you know silliness or anything like that right like in months past you know my children as they're growing up sometimes you know nobody else is here I'll be praying at the author and my children will be talking I'll they probably see my they probably see my uh see me twist my neck around like this and I'm like you know I gotta go back that's my way of being a deacon you know to my own children my gym but that's my way of lovingly doing it by the God's grace so we've got to keep a real reverence for God and then see then we see how the holy spirit is going to direct the service praise God now if they don't have respect the teenagers it'd be better that somebody else had their seat of course we don't have to worry about that so I'll skip past that of course some now here's what I read earlier somebody works for me Lord that's expected amen so he should expect somebody to shout every service you know I'm probably going to shout each service right but we should expect other people to shout too he said that's what you're here for to Worship the Lord amen and it's just like feel feel like praising God or shouting just go right on because that's what you're here for is to Worship the Lord in your own way of worshiping but there's nobody worships the Lord while you're talking and passing notes and helping somebody else get away from the worship of the Lord so you want to make sure everything we do is helping people get into the worship of the Lord so I thought after such a joyful service on Wednesday I'd bring some some reminders here some good real strict reminders amen because the Bible says God is greatly to be feared in the Assembly of the Saints and there are seasons for joyfulness in their seasons for soberness reflection repentance and I'm closing here now just so you know I've been in contact with different people that are questioning the message which is okay I you know I listen to both sides I listen to the side that leaves and the side that worships brother Brown I listen to both sides because that's my battle I believe that's what I was born for I was born to defend this message that's what I believe that's my own revelation that's God speaking to me but I was sharing with a different person or this sweet person who who's questioning the message um that God used brother Ram to restore the faith of the fathers right and so brother Brandon had to restore Church order brother man had to restore the right worship praise God dancing and shouting and praising God but also the fear of the Lord too even the prayer lines brother around he would be real serious and then he'd make a little joke to kind of feel human again he says and kind of let off the pressure and then we go back to real sincere Discerning Discerning of the Holy Spirit he said and then he said he would try to catch people's Spirits by making jokes so they loosen up and so that they'll trust him and listen to him but you know in defending brother Bam's Ministry you know it brought me back to this chapter that I wrote and I really believe the Holy Spirit had me write it where I defend brother Adam's Ministry brother random gave us over 30 thus saith the Lords now it'd be it'd be neat right now to go through and see how many thus say those we got from Jeremiah wouldn't that be neat or Ezekiel Hallelujah in this chapter there's over 30 thus saith the Lords about God restoring us back to the original Apostolic Church the doctrines the prophecies the healings we have so many thus saith the Lords and I believe Church it gives the balance on having Liberty of the Holy Spirit and also the fear of the Lord because we've been visited by a prophetic message with thus saith the Lord I want to say like this and if God ever gave me a revelation if I ever got a revelation for God it was those 12 New Testament Mysteries and God's Vindicated that Tim hume's witness to that uh other people have witnessed to that brother Brooks the church was a witness of that I believe our church is a witness of that too but it's scriptural Elijah before The Showdown Elijah had to bring 12 Stones not 11. sure not 10. 12. before The Showdown he had to play some back in order amen hallelujah thank God Amen Elijah did it praise God and then after getting a place back together and everything was in order and the worship was given then the fire fell praise God and that's the rapturing faith that's going to fall that's the latter rain that falls upon the church praise God hallelujah praise God Hallelujah and then of course it's tight by the 12 loaves of shoe bread Hallelujah 12 Stones 12 loaves of shoe bread these are the loaves the Bible calls him the bread of God's face Hallelujah so if you want to eat God's bread Church you got to understand these 12 New Testament Mysteries because they're all laying right there in the Bible Hallelujah this is God's word that we're talking about here God's word and there's there's the 12 Brothers you know there's 12 by these are Bible Mysteries the Bible calls them Mysteries and brother Ram gave us six of them with thus saith the Lord so that means we know that means we know we have God's revelation of what the Bible is saying to us we're not going to get in the Catholic church not going to get the Methodist Church they're going to hate it you know we're not going to get the Pentecostal Church they're going to hate it but we're going to get it where God's people are where God is greatly feared in the Assembly of the Saints praise God that's we're going to get it in there we're going to get God's food in God's house praise God Hallelujah you know and this I'm sorry this is what I meant too if God ever gave me a revelation it was that the Waters of Separation that brother Brandon preached the way to Fellowship the basis for fellowship if God ever gave me a revelation it was that because this is outer core so brother Chris is where you're at right here brother you're you just got baptized in water you're in the outer court now your next step is to go into the holiest I'm sorry in the Holy place that's your next step in there you have a Candlestick that's the seven Church ages I know it's hard to see brother because I didn't have a good picture here the Candlestick is that seven Church age book I gave you brother that red one it's the greatest book I've ever read outside of the Bible so I would encourage you read just five pages a day or set your timer read 10 minutes a day if you can oh yeah okay that's great that's great book too Same Spirit Rubble books I show brother Chris that uh The Testament I got back after I wrote the modesty book two women wrote me and said this book was as if Jesus Christ was talking to me himself because I told brother Chris I didn't write that book Jesus wrote that book no not every word as I say the Lord but the the revelations behind it are from God so brother in there so this is your next step brother get to know the church ages then you'll understand the Holy Ghost in every Church age and in our church amen hallelujah then there's also the shoe bread those are the 12 New Testament Mysteries I got yeah the 12 New Testament Mysteries I got a picture of that this is a little closer yeah this is a closer picture so you have the Candlestick you have the shoe bread and then the last one before you get the baptism the Holy Ghost is the altar of incense this is for anybody in the church who's seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost Church we've got to have a prayer life if we want to be born again we've got to understand the church ages Hallelujah that's why that series is such a beautiful series amen we have to understand how the oil flows in every generation Amen in every Church age the oil is the same it produces the same light same oil same experience praise God when you read that church age book you start seeing yourself in there as well you find your place in your in the church Hallelujah that's what I found I found my place as a preacher Hallelujah that's the first book I read after coming in the message was the seven Church ages absolutely phenomenal book and then God started showing me these Mysteries I didn't know I was feasting on them right got a feast on the bread of God the bread of God's face these Revelations one God Amen the Rapture of pre-tribulation rapture amen hallelujah the mother Harlot you have to have wisdom you have to have all these things and with this you come into the presence of God hallelujah and you come into there through prayer the last step before the before going into God's presence I'm gonna go back here so brother Chris this was God's presence there was three steps outer Court inner core holiest of holies that's that was in the Old Testament now there's three steps to be born again it's outer Court water baptism inner Court Church ages Mysteries prayer life you pray every day and the church said Hallelujah don't forget the church don't let it slip two days in a row don't let us live by two days you gotta get back in the presence of God and after that you go into the baptism Holy Ghost God will fill you with his love I just heard Brothers say it yesterday he said he said you're filled with God's love when you're born again that's exactly what happened to me amen thank God Amen hallelujah it's a three-step process just like that picture so we got to have a prayer life and it's incense right so these are this smoke represents the incense or prayer going up to God every day and it had to have fire on it amen and fire is the holy spirit praise God so we've got to pray with God's spirit Lord I feel you I feel you want me to pray for this and how do we know we'll be real passionate about it passionate prayers and that means brother praying for your family right passionate prayers God save them when you see Abominations out there the homosexual marriages or the abortions you cry about that say God help this to stop end this side the Bible says we sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city amen and you have a prayer life where you're sincere and you call it to God or God deliver me I'm struggling with this God deliver me God I know your word is powerful forgive me Lord help me to Love My Enemy praise God amen help me to love the unlovable a dying out to yourself but we gotta have a prayer life Hallelujah and there's another picture of it so the four horns just represent the power four is the number of the Earth so there's power on Earth to get to heaven amen through prayer Hallelujah Hallelujah power on this Earth to reach heaven the Bible says become boldly before the throne of grace that we can find Grace to help in the time of need is that it okay I finished with there okay so I'll stop right there musicians can come I think I'll stop right there there was something else I feel like I want to say a better stop right there we can stand here by God's grace Hallelujah go back to my title bouncing Liberty and the fear of the Lord praise God Hallelujah thank
