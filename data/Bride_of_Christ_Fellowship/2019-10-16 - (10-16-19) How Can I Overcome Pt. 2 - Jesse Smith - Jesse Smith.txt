remember her in prayer Lydia and Acacia I had to stay home to watch Genevieve so there with her but let's pray for a speedy recovery for my wife by the grace of the Lord also let's pray I mentioned a woman on Sunday I didn't get a chance to talk to her yet maybe I'll see you tomorrow but her name's Brenda and she looks like she's just found some pride there but let's just remember her in a word of Prayer here tonight I wanted to write that down and I didn't want to forget that also I heard back from Austin he had a good report he said thanks for your prayers he said it seems like God is doing supernatural things as far as getting him he said has to be divine intervention he was just sending me a text right before church he said I believe God is trying to answer all you and the girls prayers so he said weird things are happening I can only say they're divine intervention so he said I think I'll be home sooner than I thought so let's hope for that he said he's gotten some good favor with the court system there as he's going through some things some mistakes he made but hopefully he's learning for them so that was a good report today by God's grace also I talked with both Simon and he flew out yesterday to Thailand I haven't heard from him today but hopefully he arrives safely let's pray for him that he'll arrive safely he has two weeks there to preach and they got quite a few services lined up he said and he said the offerings we sent will be very helpful he said over there in Thailand people won't come to your service unless you feed them as well so he said it's gonna cost eight hundred dollars for one meal to get people to come so they can hear the preach and he said it's worth it and so thank the Lord for that I know that they do that in the Philippines as well they what they'll pay for the Philippine ministers denominational brothers to come and they'll feed them and then they'll sit there and listen to preaching but hundreds of churches have started because of that so let's let's pray that at least one church will start because of this by the grace of Lord so you know there's a there's a different number of elected every country you know we don't know how many lek there are but everybody deserves a chance to hear whether you pay for their food or not everybody deserves a chance to hear praise God so let's pray for those also this Sunday night we'll have communion at 4 o'clock we'll make the 4 p.m. service communion by God's grace and then I'm still working on the schedule I'd like to get the schedule for our special meetings

is behind the veil in heaven praise God amen the scripture proves that praise God let's take our Bibles here tonight I'd like to look at how can I overcome again I like to continue on that because I was studying on that by God's grace for our text let's just go to one of the text let's go to James 4:7 they're just a common text that we read there just to give us a foundation James 4:7 James 4:7 thank you sir thank you all right let's read ad together we'll just read that one verse this is part of overcoming praise God let's read that on three one two three submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you crazy let's have one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just making known to God here tonight Heavenly Father we love you lord thank you that our anchor holds lord god it just doesn't hold to a building or denomination Lord God or to any other person but Lord it holds to you Lord the eternal person and it's anchored behind the veil Lord God in heaven thank you Lord and we have representation in heaven or we came from you Lord and manifested here in time and Lord one day lord willing we'll go back to your Lord God we'll go back where we came from from your heart from your mind Lord God from your nature dear God from your great plan father we're thankful from the Lamb's Book of Life to your God thank you Jesus father were happy to be overcomers in this hour just take this moment Lord God speak to us here anoint me God and I can receive myself Lord and preach and let every person receive from thy great word Lord God the great treasure chest of those scriptures of God may we bring forth scriptures both new and old Lord God granite Lord as we minister to every heart Lord let your spear minister Lord to those livestreaming those present bless our faithful Saints that come out to the house of God tonight and Lord bless each and every person in Jesus Christ name and the Saint said amen god bless you bein seen the praise God so I told my wife I said well I'll preach 45 minutes honey okay so I can get home and try to help her out lord bless her she just had a lot of stomach pain in the last few weeks kind of off and on again kind of thing so we're just keep praying for her and trust God to do a great work in her life that's why I keep praying I said Lord just please honor her you know she done so much for me and my children I said Lord just please honor her faithfulness and her her faith just a true blessing where would I be without my wife amen I wouldn't have much of my life I'll tell you that so thank the Lord I wanted to start with something real quick brother amen had a good question for me on Sunday - Wednesdays ago I preached on the labors and the vineyard you remember that where each labor got the same reward you know and some in the parable the first the the the first our workers got kind of upset they murmur a little bit against God and so brother Amen said he had a good question he his wife we're talking about it and he just he was kind of wondering was that was that parable meaning everybody gets the same reward and and I said well it means the same reward as far as eternal life but remember Jesus talked about some rewards are thirty sixty hundred you know and brother Brahim said there's degrees in heaven so that was a great question I thought that was a really good question I just thought I'd share with everybody and I'm sorry I didn't say that when I preached it I should have said that that yes everybody gets the same reward eternal life but beyond that you know in the Millennium there'll be great rule greater rewards for different levels of faithfulness right so we know that you know some will be over five cities some ten cities that's probably millennium I don't know about the future home now maybe in the future home at some point God will send us out you know as this Holy Ghost filled Saints but it seems like we want to ever be with the Lord it seems like that's the whole purpose of salvation is so Jesus his bride can be with him hey but I don't know I like I said I don't we won't know Jesus will be revealing things to us throughout eternity program says that's the the Whitestone unknown thing program said that's the hidden manna that hidden stone there's a lot of hidden things that are gonna be a reward to us later on made known to us like the new name write the name of the Father and our new name and the name of the city you know there's all these new names we know and he hasn't revealed him yet but I thought that was a great question I just want to share that with you I didn't mean to mislead anybody or not say it right but yes the one reward we all get is eternal life but there are other rewards and to prove that Malachi pull up second John 1:8 2nd John 1:8 just has another proof John 1:8 I'm sorry 2nd John 1:8 I'm sorry too nice of you 2nd John money now here's the scripture I kind of came to my mind as I was meditating on his question look to yourselves that we lose not now CCP people can lose their reward right like Judas lost a huge reward he could have had a huge reward and we lose that those things which we have wrought but we receive a full reward so I think about like this brother William people that have left the message they they were building a good reward but they probably have lost it and the reason why is because they're trampling underfoot the things that they used to be sanctified by they say oh we don't need to wear seperate garments anymore sisters don't need to let their hair grow long anymore it's okay if men can smoke and drink and go to movies and joy rock and roll see they're they're trampling underfoot the very Saint the very word of God that sanctified them and so they they have to lose the reward of standing by the word because when they stood by the word they had reproach right they evil people spoke evil against and their family spoke evil against them and so they bore the reproach of that they went to a smaller church but now if they if they lose the thing if they leave the things of God now they have a bigger church now they're more popular now they have more friends supposedly friends but they're not true friends right so see they Paul or John says we want to receive a full reward praise God so that proves there will be different levels of reward some will receive different than others ok now go to 1st Corinthians 3 I just really want these to be embedded in our hearts that we can have a good understanding I'm gonna turn there in my Bible cuz I got a marked off here I'm just kind of going by memory at this point right now 1st Corinthians 3 about rewards yeah 1st Corinthians 3 so this is where yeah that's right brother good verse 8 yeah yep let's go to verse 8 now he Paul just got done rebuking them for them bragging about well I'm a Peter I'm of Apollo's I'm appalled some even say I'm a Peter I'm of Christ you know they even brag about being just I only follow Jesus I don't follow any man preacher but Paul rebukes him for that verse 8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor okay so we have an idea here we have an idea that everybody gets a different reward based upon their labor that's why I want to be laboring for Jesus no matter what praise God no matter who comes or who don't come no matter what I want to labor for Jesus amen like I was walking around in church today or they were either but you're before church I said Jesus this is all for you every every every square inch in here is all for the glory of Jesus I do this for Christ's glory not for any other glory but for Jesus praise God number verse 9 for we are labourers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I've laid the foundation and another man built it there on but then every man take heed how he buildeth thereon I do thought I thought there was more about oh yeah go down to verse 13 every man's work shall be made manifest I like that because God God will show everybody's sincerity were they really sincere in their ministries or not I like that because I want to be sincere for the day shall declare no no it's that day that's the Judgment Day Judgment Day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire because remember the Bible said he's a consuming fire and there will be a fire right there'll be the eternal fire the lake of fire and if your name's not found in it the fire you'll be tossing the fire so the fire reveals it because it's judgment and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he has built there on he shall receive a reward here's this is like a lot here if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire not so the fire will reveal your heart you know now we can apply this to today though to the trials of our faith the fiery trials we go through reveal what we're made of as well I believe that said that's a duel that's a compound scripture there where you have via both truce the fires of Judgment Day will judge the works but the fiery trials now because remember Paul said the false doctrines today are here the heresies are here to manifest who's true and who's not so doctrine is an important thing doctrine is a major important thing because when you get the wrong doctrine it manifests you're on the wrong side that's right it manifests the heresies praise God okay so now I just thought I'd lay that in there just to kind of go along with that question I thought that was a great question I thought well if brother amen and his who were his wife we're talking about that I think maybe other people might have been wondering about that so hope that was a blessing now let's get back here to this how can I overcome now we started off with Laodicea and how it was an individual call because he's outside the church and he says he that overcomes so he was calling to the individual not not she has in the whole church because the already kicked her she already kicked him out and then program called it a doe degeneration right a doe degeneration and he says and I want to go over this again he that knoweth to do good and do it and not to him it's in and brother madam said that's your ministry so each one of us need to know our ministry and then do our ministry it's a sin to neglect our ministry and that's why we're gonna get to the next hopefully Sunday I want to get to the gifts of the Spirit again Pat pass out a better sheet so you have more room to write on it and give more examples and I want to go through that more thoroughly but everyone needs to know their their ministry so they can devote themselves to that and we must know to do good and then do it if not then it's send to us praise God then he says strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of Christ and to be fruit-bearing so once you find your ministry you want to dedicate yourself to that so it bears fruit so people can look at your life and say my what a blessing brother William this has been such a blessing to me or sister so and so there's been a great blessing to me you want to see the fruits of your Labor's that's right and now Laodicea was a great age because brother Branham said this is the age of the full baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's striking that Christ is out of the church the very time he could he wants to fill every fiber of their being is the time they kicked him out Wow how sad that is but we invited him in praise God and we're gonna keep him in hallelujah amen that's right and then we looked at how brother and said the rapture is there's a foolish and wise and every day in every rapture Daniel was gonna stand with his lot and then only some of the saints or many of the Saints rose on the day on the resurrection not all and then brother and start talking about overcomers and we just got to Noah eight people that were saved and he said there's an ark and every day alright our Ark today is Jesus Christ and then brother BAM said we got after yield ourselves just like we yield are like a baby has to yield itself to its shirt right to put its arm in its shirt now I want to just read his next few coached now so this should be new things right here he said just yield to him say here Lord Here I am just be just be enough let me be nothing I yield put your hand in the right place that's victory that's the overcoming the thing to overcome is yourself your idea and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't I just want to take a moment on that he knows the way that you can overcome your battle right now many times Church many times I'll be honest I would have more victory if I knew how to overcome it right and so you'd probably say the same right if you knew the way to overcome it you would already overcome it right if you knew there was like if socially there's conflict in your family there's conflict with friends or like with our church conflict in the church if I knew there was a way to overcome that and and change people's minds I would do it right if I knew if I knew how the way to save someone so I would do it but I don't know it and that's part of our struggle right that's part of the the battle that we had say we want to be wise we want to be wise virgins because the Bible said he that winneth Souls is wise virgin we want to win souls but it's a difficult thing to do it's a great battle that we face we don't know how to do it but I want to just encourage you that he knows the way to do it we don't know the way alright and that's how it was like I told I gave that one example on Sunday I tried to witness to my wife my mother and it didn't go good at all how it was me trying to do it but then a few weeks later I witnessed the Tim Myers and now he's a full he's almost a full-time evangelist down in North Carolina for Tim Humes and Tim Humes was horse race and RAM church and so it it was so easy it was so hard with my mom because I was trying to do it but it was so easy with Tim Meyers because it was just God doing it was God putting my arm in the sleeve and and that's all it is we got a surrender but I tend to surrender I just my timing over there was Tim Meyers house and do a Bible study I've ever sit in his basement with three friends of his and two of them received it and the two rejected it but then later you know one of them fell away that rejected it they he don't he don't leave the message anymore either but Tim Meyers believes it praise God and I believe in amen you believe that's why we're here tonight amen we believe the message because it's God's revelation of his word that's right now he says but in Noah's sign there's eight eight overcomers that's all they were caught inside now he says the hours very late you might have a good intention he says but don't be caught outside be caught inside now don't struggle because it's not him that willeth I like that nor him that runneth but God that shows mercy praise God just let God just yield yourself to him and walk on with the perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he's able to perform stuff to God walk with Him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him amen so see like Enoch he walked with God Abraham was a friend of God amen Noah found grace in the sight of God amen so see we gotta just receive the revelation and now it's not our will it's gonna get us it's gonna be able to produce the rapture now let me balance out I did say Loretta did say if you wish to go you can go but it's not gonna be our willpower that does it it's gonna be our surrender that's gonna do it because when we surrender then God does it hey how they do yeah praise God so it's not him that willeth to go in the rapture it's not gonna be by our power that oh if I have enough power I'll change my atoms right and my and my glorified body if I just think about enough will swallow up this natural body that's not going to do it but it's us yielding and saying God I'm gonna walk today with you I'm gonna walk tomorrow with you and pretty soon we're walking into the rapture praise God that's what it's going to have to be yielding ourselves peaceful quiet not interrupted in other words enjoying life how many enjoy life see we enjoy it because we're walking in the P of God and if you don't it's you need to get around some people that don't have the peace of God then you'll see what a great life you have right you'll see what great blessings that you have in our lives I was yesterday where we were Akron up for practice and I was talking to one of the parents and she looked at me and she said you are always so positive and it's just a joy to talk to you and I said well I was she said she's a Mormon and her husband read my book and he hasn't said nothing about it other than he liked it you know but but she said I just love how you're always so Pot you're always such an awful uplift and I said you know what that's because of God has given us so much grace in this hour and I said I could either choose to complain or I could choose to be happy and I'm gonna be happy for what Jesus did for us and she said I like that she said that's good I said well I mean that's the choice we have every day as Christians and my man said if anybody should be happy it should be us who know the message ain't ahead because of what we know amen this revelation doesn't make us discourage or frustrated this message sets us free amen it gives us hope it makes us look up to the sky in the morning and say this could be the day man this might be the day this might be the year it might be 2020 we we don't know but it gives us hope to know that we we believe all this Bible Church we believe all of this amen we're not like denominations that cut parts often and we believe everything praise God and we just got to peacefully walk on with God and say God I don't know how I'm gonna overcome all this but I'm gonna overcome all of it by your grace as I surrender you know the way for me to overcome my trial so you will guide me in it you'll your word will be a light unto my feet and a light unto my path amen I don't know how I'm gonna overcome these but I know you know the way and as I yield to you you'll help me be an overcomer because it takes both member churches both remember after Pentecost the Bible says the Lord worked with them see we're working with the Holy Spirit today thank God amen we're not working at oh we're just not working with the brothers are working with the sisters we're working with the Holy One the divine one the eternal one the resurrected one oh the mighty one we're working with Jesus Christ amen and we got it we got to do our part and then he does his part and we got to yield ourselves to him and he'll make us overcome amen hallelujah but see the victory is our yielding that's the part that can't be pushed through a pipe Jesus can't force you to yield the part of you going through the pipe is you surrendering and saying yes Lord I'll stop trying to do it myself I'll let you do it I'll obey your word now when you surrender that that is your that's your victory right there and I've been studying on this this week I've been studying really hard I've been real hard this week about the soul let me just drop this in here the soul is the nature of the Spirit and brother and said the soul is the part that has free more agency amen praise God that's what he said I got a quote from 1965 my dad said that the soul is the part of the Spirit it's the part that has the power of choice he said as the power of free more agency and then I went back I remember when I preached on the revelation series last or earlier this year and brother am said before you get in the Holies of Holies he said the veil is hanging there and he said that's the veil of self-will amen see you got a medicine you got a rent in the veil and you got to say God not my will but thy will be done I'm taking down the veil of my will by resin and then the Holy Ghost can come live in your your place Amen your soul amen so I just thought that would that be a real help to you it's a bit of help to me I've been really trying to study on this so it's a great deep thing I'm gonna preach on that Lord maybe Sunday - by God's grace I want to preach on your purpose with the gifts but the soul this has been a tremendous study on the soul it's so deep that it's it's been a great I've been telling wife about has been a great challenge but also great benefits and there's lots of scripture on it just to understand the soul because the soul can be filled the soul can be sealed the soul can be immersed and there's so many more I wrote down five five or six of them the soul can be rest at rest there's so many different things about the soul there's so many ways we describe the soul can be circumcised there it is amen so this soul is a great deep teaching it's a great mystery right but the Bible said you're born again of the incorruptible seed and the seed of God doesn't even sin amen so the soul is a great deep thing and this is how we get the victory we yield ourselves our will say God I don't want my will to be done this church I want your will to be done this church I know what my will to be done in my life I want the will of Christ to be done in my life and when you really when you and I really get that victory that's when we finally die out and that's when we're born again by the Holy Ghost amen and now when we pray it's just like Christ now of course they'll never be as glorious as him or as perfect as his but we do pray that Lord let your will be done not my will be done and we can pray it in a way that denominational scant we can pray in ways that people foolish version that they can't pray it like we can we should be able to pray and mean it and God sees that we're sincere about it when we can change our the way we dress right and when we can change our beliefs and used to be tongues the evidence but now it's the word is the evidence living the word and God sees that we've surrendered all because we take every word of God we believe every word and we surrender all of our free more agency and now God God is in our soul God is our nature amen that's the word I was going for nature and the Bible said we're partakers of the divine nature amen hallelujah so it's the neh it's a nature changing there's so many different aspects about the soul it's so deep I want to dig into that and uh Lord here in the future he said just yield yourself peaceful quiet not interrupted I heard a good quote the other day brother Ram said ever since I got the Holy Ghost I've been drunk every day of my life now that's in his soul but then I heard other quotes where he said everyday I feel so much pressure I feel like my head's gonna come off you you can you relate to that Church in your soul when you when we come to church it's like my we feel like you know we finally started living from the solar or in other words were you saying touch more with the soul and we feel oh it feels so good I can be here singing I feel so great but you take me about three hours ago at work I was how do I say this yeah and it feels like my head's gonna explode right but then just change the atmosphere hey amen change the atmosphere start listening to the control tower right and pretty soon we start feeling real good real happy joyful we got the joy of the Lord amen oh that's it's a great mystery brother William isn't it it's a great mystery it was a great mystery in Paul's day how he could he could be so on he could do such great miracles in some places but other places he couldn't do miracles other times he'd be victorious doing miracles and other times he had his his eyes were good give him trouble other times the coppersmith run him out of town instead of him instead of smiting this one blind he this one run him out of town it was so humble being locked up in a prison for months and months on end you know just without a coat we said bring my coat bring my cloak you know think about that this the the paradox that a believer is they're sinful and they're in their body their mind isn't totally cleaned out but in their soul it is the nature of God amen it is a miracle of God that was unavailable in the Old Testament but now it was hid from ages but now it's been revealed Christ in you the hope of glory amen oh my gosh you to preach on the soul tonight amen yeah but man sir just yield to him but when I was talking to a man that had a mental breakdown now I've never had a mental breakdown has anybody here had a mental breakdown okay I know then the reason I say that's because I've known pastors about my age I've had mental breakdowns and they'll told me he said he was just a pastor now he would just cry for days on end because of all the pressure from church leaders and perturbed politics and I've never had a mental breakdown but Bertram's talking about overcoming and what he advised a man who had a mental breakdown he said just yield to him he's here he knowed what you have done and what caused your being and doing this way and all that he knows about you and now he's just told you back just what to do now I said only thing you have to do is just go do it that is that is forget all about the best walk live for the future in the glory and presence of God amen so this man had a breakdown about his past and my dad said go do this to make it right and then after you make a right after you obey the Holy Spirit walk forward and the glory of God amen forget about it don't let Satan just bring your past back to you but press on toward the mark of the high calling in Jesus after you make it right press on in the glory and that joy of the Lord amen because remember the breakdowns not in your soul the breakdowns in your mind amen and that's where it should be because that's the greatest battle ever fought is going on right there and sometimes we will struggle sometimes we may have a mental breakdown but see God allows it all for his glory now that pastors had a mental breakdown by the way him he can minister to somebody I can't all I can do is point you to this quote but I can't really tell you what it's like or how I overcome that but this man can right but I can't help somebody who's been addicted to drugs I can help you on that one I know what that's like okay or other addictions I can I can relax or some there but see God has a special ring for everybody's testimony praise God he's got a special sound to it he's got a special ring to it because we all overcome by the blood but we all got a word for our testimony praise God now I got 20 minutes so here that's that's a preached 45 now the next overcomer he names is Daniel so he goes from Noah to Daniel here's what he says about Daniel some some important things I want to read this now if you got your Bibles go to Hebrews 11 well let's read us while you turn there Hebrews 11:6 Malachi let me read about Daniel now in the time of Daniel there was only four over comers that could stand the test of fire and lion he says fire and lion what you know that's gonna be awesome we're gonna get to heaven who testify and say what did you overcome and they're gonna say I overcame lions Daniels gonna say I overcame lions Shadrach Meshach Abednego Oh tell us about how you overcame oh we overcame the fire a church what are we gonna overcome we're gonna overcome laio - CIA men riches and the spirit of greed and and and money and Mammon right we're gonna overcome all those things the Bible said if you overcome you'll sit with me on my throne amen hallelujah praise God we've got a great thing to overcome and I'll say like this even though we're not fighting natural lines we're fighting spiritual lines because Satan is like a roaring lion right seeking whom he may devour praise God so seeing God's sight we're all we're all fighting great battles praise God we've all got we're all being hunted down but we're all overcoming by the grace of God now he says there's only for overcomers now he says we are expected to be tested by the babson so I want to remind us of that sometimes we just just eat myself sometimes I get so weary with tested or with Tess then I start to feel sorry for myself because I go through different tests you know trials here are different here but Romero says take the other attitude that's what I need take the attitude like I'm expecting a test today in other words I know I'm gonna fight today I'm ready to fight and there are times I am like that I know we are we all are right there are times that we get up in the morning oh I'm ready to go pray I'm ready to go fight those demons amen other times we get weary of our battles right and we just wish they could it all be over and the church said right we always smile I just wish it could be done with and go on to heaven to have a perfect body can't wait to step into my a theophany ah we all feel like that but Moran said take this attitude like Daniel we're expected to be tested he said he that cometh to God must first be tested tested with what with the word that's God's test do you believe it he come he that cometh to God must be tested that only shows a true child then is he who's tested now here's a scripture that he's mentioning without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him see without faith see either coming to God must believe and the only way to believe is to overcome unbelief to be tested praise God if you would maokai go to Hebrews 12:5 this is a real beautiful scripture obviously now we all want to be overcomers right what program says you can't overcome unless you got a test give to you right we all want to be overcome we all want to sit on the throne with Jesus we all know we're a crown and then throw it at his feet and fall on our faces like the saints in heaven we already do that but we got to have a test first and we got to overcome it we got to get victory over it but Hebrews 12:5 you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chase honest and scourge every son whom he receives if you no chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father Jason's not amen now Jason there actually he literally means to spank or to whip or beat I'll never feel like God's beaten you don't raise your hand if you don't even but the by by that's the Bible says scourge there it's a scourge it is a physical pain so God is going to give us a strong whipping when we when we fall short of God's glory right because he knows that we want to do right he knows we want to overcome but we compromise and we get tired or we make excuses or we get we we follow the lust of the eyes or the lust of the flesh or the pride of life and so God has got to spank us to get us back in order amen he says you can't overcome unless you have a test given to you and he said the test is given to see if you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you hey man how many appreciate that quote I heard that for years I've heard that for years but we charge we got let it sink in and realize this is the greatest thing that ever happened to me whatever trial you know God allows me to go through whatever seems like a constant grind or a constant battle or constant frustration if we're trying to overcome it but haven't we got to look at it like brother Branham said this is the greatest thing that happened to me because it keeps me seeking God amen hallelujah the greatest thing that ever happened to me was the test so let's just a good brother Rams life a little bit so brother Branham falling falling and disobeying God at the beginning and following his mother-in-law I'm not going to Pentecostals and suffering the flood and then the loss of his family that was one of the greatest things ever happened to him because the next time he wouldn't compromise right program giving in to the ministers at South Africa where I got amoebas and almost died and nine months couldn't preach anymore that was one of the greatest things that ever happened to him ah Church think about your hardest times of your life if it was a the response of some failure did it really was one of the greatest things that ever happened to you because it taught you and train you to obey God's Word the next time and to overcome that temptation amen now brother improves it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you first Peter 1 verse 6 Malachi proved it brother Branham of course he will Peter says the trials are the greatest thing that ever happened to you and I can say like this you know some of my greatest trials have I told you the greatest trials I go through outside of my personal battles my mind battles is with church members that come to our church stay for a while then leave those are some of my greatest battles but I can look back and say they are the best thing that happened to me because they they take my roots deeper in the soil of God amen they make me dig deeper to find out what do I really believe what did brother Ram really say what does the Bible say about this and so my trials within the church actually make me put my roots down deeper help me to dig in and make sure I really know where I stand amen hallelujah they give me more of a backbone they give me more confidence that God's Word is right now I'm in the truth that I haven't denied the faith that I fought the good fight and I'll run the course amen hallelujah so trials are the greatest thing that ever happened to you 1st Peter 1:6 wherein you greatly rejoice there he says rejoice about it though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations they're going through awful and they were going through physical tribulation in Peters day that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so when's your payday for all these trials the rapture amen when you get paid back all these precious trials at the rapture that's what you get payback because you'll see him see you get you thought you found it if your your trials your victories are to the praise at the appearing of Jesus Christ much more precious than gold hallelujah amen more precious so he says I'll say it again the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you he said it's testing time it's one good evidence that God is with us when we're tested amen for all children of God are tested and tried hallelujah praise God that's beautiful so simple but yet so true and how many appreciate reminders like that I do I really appreciate that it's a real blessing to be assured of these things the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you now here's the finishing the quotes on Dan you've got a few more quotes and Daniel a man Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Daniel was the Prophet and that was the size of the church in that day I mean the bride talked about a little flock brother William my man we're massive compared to them I think I was counting on Sunday I forgot how many we had here like maybe 12 or 13 I thought man they only had four we have three times their church the bride and Daniel's day had four people in it in his City four and yet they overcome by believing the word and although the main way they overcome was by prayer and by not compromising because remember the three Hebrew children said even if God doesn't save us I'm not bowing to these homosexual agenda amen hallelujah I'm not bowing to this sports-loving Society praise God I'm not bowing this money loving money-grubbing Society they make me want to skip church to make more money I'm not bowing to anything and even if God doesn't deliver me I'll still bless His Holy Name Amen I'm not bowing to it he said he said I mean the bride so Daniel was the Old Testament bride member hallelujah he said there's lots of churches about two million them down there that was the size of the overcomer was four and then overcomers was put to the test and every overcomer has to be put to the test and when they said you take back what the word says or either be thrown the fire furnace they refuse anything but the word amen that's what you and I say in the same way we refuse any doctrine unless it's the Word of God hallelujah and when Daniel was given a test that he should take back what the word says that they should lean towards the temple a Solomon prayed and he would deliver them from all things God would hear from heaven if they look towards the temple and pray and said if any man prays within these amount of days and we Meads of Persians who cannot change or alter our laws that that man will be throwed in the lion's den no see I just want to bring this out again Daniel got the victory by praying it would have been a sin for him to not pray and see that's why some of us are over surprised you may be on Sunday but man says some people have the ministry to be a prayer warrior that's their ministry so if they're not praying to them at sin just like for me as a preacher if I didn't preach it'd be a sin for me not to but that's what Paul said woe unto me if I don't preach the gospel so what what about everybody else with their gifts woe to them if they don't invest in their gift of knowledge right woe to them if they don't invest in their prayer lives see we got to do our ministry that's how we overcome through the gifts and ministries that God's given to us and see the trials of life will push us to be devoted to those ministries amen well the choice like Daniel Daniel had a choice well I'm either gonna be thrown the line spit or me faithful to my prayer life I'm gonna be there were gonna be I'm not either gonna be killed or you know I could have an easy life or I'm gonna be killed and say with the word and so he chose to stay with the word that's right he said they set a trap form he said I believe the Prophet knew that Daniel knew is a trap right just like us we should expect the test we should expect so I shouldn't expect tomorrow someone's gonna try to trap me in something right say he's gonna try to catch me when I'm not aware of it he's gonna try to send someone to say evil about me or an in morally dressed woman or some deal to make extra money I should expect him tomorrow but I should be prayed up so I can be an overcomer amen that's right they set a trap for him he walked humbly when it came time for him to pray he known at the home place in Jerusalem there was a burning sacrifice on the altar Daniel wasn't afraid of them spies he raised up the shades threw back the shutters knelt down on his knees throwing up his hands of God and prayed why live or die he had the victory yeah praise God he knew sister Beatrice that they were going to watch and pray but he said watching if you don't like this watch this anyway I'm gonna pray anyway he expected the test and then he stood right in the midst of the tests and I'm gonna be faithful I'm gonna keep my post of duty I'm gonna invest in my talents and my gifts I'm gonna invest in them and watch god I'll be an overcomer amen glory now he says these last few statements but let me I want to say a few things here here's last about Daniel and Shadrach Meshach Meshach and Abednego you might remember this I'm sorry skip past there we go I'm gonna close with this cuz I got about okay I got about four minutes there on 45 minutes man thank the Lord see live or die Daniel had the victory and so therefore he has so much victory to the Lions couldn't eat him because he overcame oh thank you know I was so blessed to hear that when I listed that on Sunday I think I heard it today too I started the beginning he had so much victory the Lions couldn't eat him he said Shadrach Meshach Abednego has so much victory until the fire couldn't burn them he said you know victories a very hard thing to burn out or eat up or anything so they had it amen glory a church we should have so much victory until the Lions of the demons chasing us can't do anything about it amen because there's so much victory that the fire couldn't touch them the line couldn't touch him and search we know we have the victory when the temptations do not cause us to fall praise God that's when we know we got the victory when the temptations come and they can't grab a hold of us amen when when depression brother William tries to creep up on your shoulder say you're getting up there in age and you're not as strong as he used to be and you know you've got so much power when you just brush it off and say get behind me Satan amen I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen or when lust tries to climb up here and tries to whisper in your ear or how about this we see this a lot arrogance especially around the message we see a lot of that oh you're so much better than everybody else and everybody needs to listen to you say get behind me devil shut up i'ma I'm humble I'm gonna walk humbly peaceably quiet with my lord I will not be exalted there's no good thing in me except Christ amen not to make yourself a stuffed shirt right like we saw he didn't his name under there on the on the church ages because he said it make him a stuffed shirt he went to extra matters right to try to humble himself to keep himself a little and so you and I when we've got the victory we'll have so much victory to the temptations of this world cannot overcome us they men let's send our feet by God's grace told my wife I preached 45 minutes I did a good job right there my good grace to the Lord hallelujah yeah I only got the victory tonight praise God amen how many expecting to be tested tomorrow though Amen I am as we leave here let's sing hymn pray and worship and let's expect a battle tomorrow but let's be ready and have so much victory that that lion devil I mean like lol why ing although hero is like a li o n he's rolling around like a lion he's a lion devil he'll have no power to overcome us because we've got so much victory just like John John had so much victory the oil could have burned out his victory amen hallelujah praise God amen but man had so much victory that the complex couldn't take him off the field and make him move up in the mountains and leave his post of duty as a preacher Amen he had so much victory that a complex couldn't overcome him hallelujah amen Joseph has so much victory that even though the woman tried day after day come on let's go let's go let's go lay together let's he had so much victory that she had no power over him Amen hallelujah so much victory in church that's what we need today well when we got the victory we got the joy the Lord don't we amen we're expected to be tested if we're gonna be God's children we are gonna be tested but we got to overcome that's our part overcome yield and obey right and let God have his way in our lives praise God Malik I want you come up here Lord willing well I already said two things I'm a preacher on Sunday but when we can we catch up back up on this he goes over a lot next missus lot and then he goes to six over in the days of John the Baptist and then he talks he closes the by looking at Jesus's overcoming yeah praise the Lord let me read this again no true believer is any stronger and spiritual healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure Word of God amen you're only as strong as the word you obey if you're not obeying certain word you won't be a strong you have to adhere to the word and obey to the word and then will be an overcomer the milligram says this the only way to be an overcomer so the only way you know you're an overcomer is if you're overcoming he said because the word can't fail how to do you let's bow our heads here now what do you got to overcome tonight just in your mind think about that what do you got to overcome [Music] think about that this is a test that you should have expected this is the test I should have expected praise God God shouldn't expect to be tested that's the only way we can be overcomers but the father is there to help us the father will give us a test that we can't overcome father we love you tonight Heavenly Father Lord we're thinking about our our test your God it's the greatest thing that ever happened to us when you let these tests come into our minds where as I said earlier I see it most often in church trouble where Lord false things come in and I I get to see the Holy Spirit bring out some more convinced next week even though less people come or less people screaming it doesn't matter because I know we've got more of the truth no matter how much less the world takes of us people want to hear it doesn't matter cuz we got more of your word and we believe these tests are more precious a golden quarry and we will see them the praise and glory of them at the appearing of Christ Jesus babe that's what will get the reward amen to see Jesus face to face see our Lord in the air and said my bones he said if I die my bones will rise to meet Christ in the air holiday praise God hey what an overcomer even thank you Jesus [Music] thank you for these tests in life Lord and I pray right now in the church let's pray together spray for doesn't happen I pray
