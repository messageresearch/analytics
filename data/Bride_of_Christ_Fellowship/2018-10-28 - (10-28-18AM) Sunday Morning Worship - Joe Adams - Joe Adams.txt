Jesse for having us here coming and allowing us to be back with you this morning we we trust us something to be said in to be a blessing to you in the church back home brother Tim sends his greetings so we're just looking forward to a good time in the service today and just to kind of give you my my titles for this morning and for this evening so you can kind of see the direction we'll be going today I want to speak to you this morning on defend your position and this evening I want to speak to you and refuse to retreat so I think our brother opened up this morning the song with the battle is the Lord's so the battle is the Lord's but he's got hands and feet right here this morning you're the troops on the ground so be prepared to fight we'll take your Bibles this morning we'll look here in Psalms 18 if I can get just a little bit more volume up here so I can be helped out Psalms 18 and we're looking verse 31 a little bit more if you could Psalms 1831 that's better yeah thank you say Amen when you get there hey man well everybody's there let's get started the Bible says for who is God save the Lord and who is our rock save our God it is God that gird it's me with strength and he maketh my way perfect that word perfect there means to be complete unimpaired excuse me sound and whole he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and he said it's me upon my high places he teaches my hands to war so that a bow is still is broken by my arms I allow you to be seated this morning we've got a few other places arena I'll start well several scriptures this morning as we get into the meat of the word and as I said we're gonna look at this morning defend your position so bother title you can recognize that you have a position that we're going to speak about this morning and then we look here in verse 33 in Psalms 18 it says he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and he said it's me notice it's God that positions the believer and that word said it there means to stand erect upright or set its position so it's God that positions you upon your high places and he teaches David as saying he teaches my hands to war notice they were then learned his military tactics from some army or some Navy or some marine no he learned to fight because he learned to trust God in the same way that we his sons and daughters of God in this hour the way we learn to fight is the way we trust our God and God teaches our hands to war it many times we think it may be throwing a punch but war can be just like this he teaches our hands to fight he teaches our hands to war he teaches how to engage in conflict because realize you face the enemy each and every day of your life but the battle belongs to the Lord and it's not on want you to recognize church it's not a flesh and blood affair the battle that you face is a spiritual battle now the devil your enemy would love to get that spiritual battle into a natural are to a human battle to where you get into the flesh and once you get into the flesh you lose victory so recognize first and foremost the battle belongs to the Lord in us a spiritual battle but realize he sets us up in a position and if God set you in a position you can't fail as long as you remain in that position we look here in Psalms 18 and verse 47 he said it is God that avenges me and so do it the people under me he delivers me from my enemies yay they'll lift its me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man notice God's setting you up again it's God that's lifting you up is that's placing you it's god that's positioning you above those that rise up against you verse 49 therefore will I give thanks unto thee O Lord among the heathen I will sing praises unto thy name verse 50 great delivers giveth he to his King and he shows mercy to his anointed to David and to his seed for every morning how many year of the signal David a man verse Psalm 75 here verse 7 you're right - excuse me today I've been fighting a cold and coming on the end of it and so I was telling brother Jesse on the way here and always a text my throat so I'm by the grace of God we'd get through this service this morning Psalm 75 verse 7 says but God is the judge he put its one down and he set it up another so God pulls down one but he positions up another revelations three and verse 21 it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I am overcame and sat down with the father in his throne so notice - how many of you an overcomer this morning so if you're an overcomer this morning God has they positioned for you he's not on a pure red chair this morning but God has a place on the throne he's got a position waiting for you that's an overcomer this morning but I want you to know the devil is acting your position is that all right this morning we find that in Isaiah 14 in verse 12 it says how their fallen from heaven Oh from heaven Oh Lucifer son of the morning how are their cut down to the ground which did weakens the nation's for thou is set in the heart notice how the enemies thought process is notice what he is saying I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will also set upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I want to send above the heights of the cloud and I will be like the Most High the devil is holding your position this morning because whose position is to be be seated in heavenly places that's your position he says our so my throne above the stars of God and yet we've already just read in revelation 3:21 that that place belongs to you to the overcomer this morning I will sit on the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the cloud and I will be like the Most High let me tell you Church there's only one this morning that can be like the Most High and that's the God of the most high that's the one that's been called by the Most High that's the one that's been anointed by the Most High that's the bride of Jesus Christ she is born of his book power of his power fresh of his flesh she is him and brought before him this morning and Pat your position but the devil wants your position but you got to fight for it we found in Matthew 11 and verse 12 says from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence but the violent take it by force you know many times we think we got to be passive easygoing Christians and if we need to be passive easygoing Christians but when it comes to this word we got to be violent the Bible says from the days of John the Baptist until now this word that we serve this word that we live by it's under attack day in and day out but the violent take it by forth their word violent there means to be strong and powerful those that are passionate about the word those are not passionate about this message we don't just sit on the shelf know we're passionate about it and those that are voted for it they love it they had to hide it they tell you by force they grasp it with everything that's within us because it's right to the believer they take the word to the heart they take it to their bosom hey take it and a part in their home they put on the job it's the word that they live by we're not just passive Christians or anything don't come or go nowhere we're shards and we're daughters of God we're falling about the messes of the hour now they swear they were speaking on the staff in your position and the word defend their means to resist an attack made on something or someone it so means to protect from harm or danger so today you must resist the attack on your position and you must protect from harm and danger and the Bible tells us in Romans 8 verse 28 and we know the scripture very well but just allow me to build the black ground or build my platform this morning so we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God how many believe that whether it be good whether it be bad all things work together for the good at the end that that love God to them who are the called that word they're called means Divali selected the realize you've been divinely selected or not by happenstance but divinely selected and appointed according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate now we realize that people don't like the word predestination but God liked it God used it right to him he called he also what he foreknew in those he foreknew he also predestined ate it therefore he predetermined your destiny before you was ever born before he was ever formed in the womb God predetermined you're in because he knew the choice that you would make he knew that you had a desire to serve Him and based on in desire he could choose you and he would choose you and it would predestinate you to an eternal in so to whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren more whom he did predestinate them he also called and to whom he called them he also justified in the whom he justified them he also glorified now let me just read that in the amplified cuz I think it breaks it down a little bit more in our modern-day English is that okay we all english-speaking this morning I know I'm from the south and you're from Ohio and this is a North versus the South and the blue versus the gray but those are long gone right we're all one family this more right y'all got the win y'all won the battle but we're together today a mess good thing about being Christians there's no battlegrounds we're not no separation that last move Oh pick up here in verse 29 when we look at on the amplified let notice how it reads here says for those whom he foreknew or he had an awareness of any love beforehand he also destined from the beginning for ordaining them to be molded into the image of his son and they share inwardly his likeness that he might become the firstborn among many brethren now here's where I want to clue in on the verse 32 those who he does for dane he also called so if god for danger god's gonna call you and those that he called he justified otherwise he acquitted he made you righteous putting them into a right standing with himself notice positioning them into a right standing within himself and those who mean justified he also glorified there means raising him up to a heavenly dignity or condition or a state of being see God called you because he called you he justified you he declared you righteous there's nothing against you this morning there's no sin on your life there's no history in your life God justified you it's a credit and he positions you in a right standing this morning and not only does he position in the right standing but he raised all hallelujah he raises you up to a heavenly dignity this morning oh you're not just human fresh but you're the bride of Jesus Christ he has elevated you to a hostage to your house this morning church not everybody can be bribed not everybody can feel this position but the elected in the call and the justifier and the glorified they will fit this image God is speaking of here we find here in Ephesians 1 the Bible speaks about being predestinated to the adoption of sons can we read that this morning the piece is one of verse 1 says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus into the faith in Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings notice this morning you've been blessed with all spiritual blessings come on Church all spiritual blessings you have been blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame that word is faultless unblameable without spot before him in love having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself so he looked back in verse 3 and the Bible would tell us blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual busts in heavenly places now what does this word heavenly places believe the probably God will bring him down in the message Christ as a mystery of God revealed he says how many places just for a moment is the believers position in Christ I'm in your believer this morning then you've already been seated in heavenly places you've been predestinated into heavenly places that's the believers position in Christ where the believer stands in Christ is in heavenly places when did he choose you Church when you were born only on an altar note before the foundation of the world before you ever made one mistake before you ever coming in the first act of seeing God already cold you not only chose you ain't got only place you there in heavenly places he says see the great mystery he chose us in Christ before the foundation the world that we should be holy that we would be without blame don't you love that when you look in the mirror you see your faults you see your mistakes you see your shortcomings but when God looks upon you he sees you faultless he sees you blameless he sees you holy he sees you the way that he sees you so the word here means adoption the word means that it's the placing or the positioning of a son now when we think of adoption we're thinking going to an orphanage or to a hospital and we take somebody's baby that wasn't born in our family and we take that then we adopt it and we bring it into our family but that's not what the adoption is in the oriental custom the oriental custom was that this son was born into the family he was always a son he was born a son but he was not yet adopted in this this son will go through the act of being a tutor and in being trained and he would go through that to make sure he was in the right standing and if he passed all the course or he was found right in the father's eyes then he was place or he was an adopted son that means that he was placed into a position of authority and power that means that his name on the checkbook was just as good of the father's name that means he can run the affairs of the business the same way the father can run the affairs of the I'm going to tell you this morning Church you have been predestinated I said you have been predestination that sonship this morning you were born into the family but yeah your place into the family you are a position this morning of authority and power he predestinated there's the mystery he this okay this morning he before Christ or anything else was only earth you see his great mystery that he would choose the bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelief in the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to the word regardless of what the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to the word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ so each of you this morning how many of you are here this morning we got some of you they don't know if you're here right we are in the north it's cold everybody's mind head and defrosted yet happy we're not that cold yet he said coming in in the wintertime it'll be four or five months of snow around here I'd have no desire to come you know it's barely breaking 50 back home but each of us this morning have a predetermined position in the body God predetermined you for a specific age for a specific task for a specific place and for a specific purpose you don't really realize this morning you couldn't come in a prior age you look back and you think oh how glorious Martin's day was when he protested a Catholic Church would have been great to come in that date you couldn't already been great in Wesley's day when he was when he laid hands on his horse and it came back up and he was able to ride it on and you know and he carried the message of sanctification throughout the world he'd been great they've been a part of that day but you couldn't you know even in Azusa Street when their gifts begin to reveal restored to the people and to the end to the body of Christ and we find that you know their tongues and different things of that nature the spiritual gifts come back and yet you couldn't even have been found in that day God predetermined you don't live in this day this is the age Barbara don't want to god choose me for this day because he chose the strongest he chose the bravest he chose the mightiest warriors live out in his dark and evil a he chose those that were burned a lot of the word you can come in another age you came in this age because God had predetermined you to live in this hour somebody is going to defend the position or be in that word Bob ride somebody's going to live out the testimony but no matter what they do to it we refuse to bow we refuse to be it we refuse to give up we refuse to run away now we're sons and daughters of God God had chose you for this battle but you got to defend your position oh so now one of the most important wants to know the most important thing you can recognize I'm glad some of you're with me this morning hope the rest of you catch up one of the most important things that you can ever recognize in the battle that we're in is to recognize your position the part that you play the position that you hold see you can't afford to assume the position that doesn't belong to you I gave an example before as I appreciate said another church in San Diego you take a man who's a maybe he's just a enlistee in the Marines there's no formal training to be a general or a corporal or any of that nature and yet he tries to overtake the command post he doesn't know the military tactics he's young he's green he's just a GI you know knee and they are Corp are private is that's what the word they used and realized that if he was to take the leadership of the troops that he would get them in danger see you can't you suffer Authority that doesn't belong to your position that doesn't belong to you not everybody can be brother Jesse in the pastor of the church but see God has called us to a position and we must remain in the position that God has placed us in you said brother Joe you know I want to be a song leader or I don't know you'd ever want to be a song leader I want to be a preacher I don't know why you'd ever want to be a preacher so I just said right backers like God why am I even here because we feel so little we feel like we're not even able you know we think about how little we are but yet God begins to lift you up and God begins to bring an anointing down so we can't afford to assume a position that doesn't belong to us you may never a preach a sermon how many you may never preach a sermon that many of you especially ladies but yeah you have a position in the body you may never sing a special but yet you have a position in the body you may never play one of these systems but yet you have a position in the body you may never be the sole leader you may never be a deacon you never married see by the message but yet God has called you in this hour for a position so no matter who you are what you are you have been caught and you've got to stay faithful to that calling you say well I don't sing you know how we get in the flesh we get down I don't ever gift I don't have you got a gift to being part of this a lake lady and I'm talking about this morning is the gift because not everybody possesses that gift we think well we're not important to the body you are just important to the body of Christ his brother branham himself you're just important to the body of Christ is Martin Luther as Wesley is Columba many of those mean any Christian you put any famous Christian there from the days go by you're just important today here in Akron Ohio is any of those other former believers that we've ever had come down through time because God has placed you here don't belittle where God has placed you don't belittle position got to put you in God place you there because he knows if you're in that position that he can get greater use out of your life how many of you know the story of EF Hutton how many of y'all know who Hutton is several of he's a great financial mind back in the day is going by we have Hutton meaning you may not know but he wanted to be a missionary he had his heart desire to go out and being a missionary in a missionary field but yet he had a very bright mind and you know he went ahead and went to school and and he prayed the whole time he wanted to be a missionary one to be a missionary and he realized at some point in his schooling the God came down and spoke to him and he said look because I can do more for you here in this position than I can with you out there in that position and he was one of the greatest financial minds that this nation has ever seen because Walker's God put him in a place that he can use him and further the gospel and I'm going to tell you this morning you may never crease the word but God's place you in a position that you can further the gospel get behind the word and push the gospel forth church so you're just as important to the body is any of us other brothers that preach or anybody else that has a gift you're just as important to the body but the enemy is going to do everything he can to keep you from realizing who you are and keep you from realizing the power that God is giving you and keep you from realizing the authority that God has bestowed upon you and if he can keep you from realizing that then he can keep you defeated broke man will tell us in the message revelation of Jesus Christ the church age book he says now Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts excuse me and exposes Satan revealing his works as a tip to destruction of God's people and to discrediting of God's Word right now to the time that he has cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows referring to Satan though he knows that if the people get a true revelation or the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army oh do you recognise did you just hear what he said about you this morning if you can recognize who you are and by God's Spirit is our and we stand by the Antichrist spirit Satan would be definitely thought it today as if he was in that day church I'm telling you this morning you have a power that's not even been tapped into yet that you don't recognize who you are this morning and when you recognize that I am that broad I am that spiritual union with Christ I am that invincible or me I'm too powerful to be defeated I'm too powerful to be stopped ain't no Gabriel is standing here before me I'm not saying this about myself I'm saying what the world says about you know what is the COG declared Univ it's a whole army but you gotta recognize your place well brother Joe I don't feel like I don't feel like this invisible army well duh of course you don't because you're you're wrapped up in this thing called humanity but we're not going based on what this human manatee says or the flesh dish to us I'm reading what the word says about you she will be an invincible army too powerful to be defeated overcome that's who you are that's the position you put you have and when you ever catch this revelation of who you are that you are this in fact is invisible army then there's no gates of hell that can stand before you the gates of Hell will not shine I cannot prevail over here when you catch the revelation of who you actually are you believe that this morning see men cannot order yourself to a place see it's God that orders your place don't forget that God orders your place and we must never try to take somebody else's place don't try to be something that you're not and we find a lot of the issues in churches today and the issues of church splits is because me and take positions thirds are not called to take we find now we a lot of times that we in our own humanity try to question God and we try to you know come to terms want to God do this or want to God do that it's not our place to question the mind of God it's not our position to wonder God why'd you put this man here why did that man make that decision that's between him and God the word position here just so we can get a clarity means a place where someone or something is located or has been put so I've been speaking to you on defend your position where had put you and he's put you in a position called the bride of Jesus Christ do you believe that this morning so each of us here have a predestinated position as part of that a leg body but you realize in the Bible Jesus gave His disciples power right they could cast out the devil they can do this and they had the word and the Word was made flesh with them and he told him I give you power and he gave them the power but what they lack they lack the Fate to operate the power of the word but see Jesus realized who he was he realized that he was the word and he had faith in what the word declared him to be so he realized what he was he realized that knowing that he was a work and he had faith in God who made him the word and he was the word of God and that was in him and I give him faith because what he understood his position and if he understood his position because he looked back at what the word said about him now what about you and I'll this morning can we look back to what the word declares about us this morning as believers as sons and daughters of God as the predestinated of the Lord Jesus Christ so if he relies upon what God made him then why can't we rely upon what God has made us these signs shall follow them that believe see he has faith in what he was and if you are a believer how many of your believer this morning they can't we have faith in what he's declared us to be a believer see you got to recognize your position and if you abide in me and my word and you then asks what you will come on Church recognize your position in the scripture as a believer you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position and he could curse that tree and say no fruit will bear from you anymore no because just what's over us this morning in the father's name he said he'll give it to you whatsoever you ask don't just limit God's power just something small know whatever you have need of this morning God is here God is able God is willing whatever you asked this morning but you got to recognize your position that you've been placed there to ask God for whatever your need is and when you fully understand your position as a son and daughter of God then you will refuse to be taken advantage of you were refused to live below your god-given privileges you will stand up in the face of your adversary and say not today I'm not listening to your lies anymore I'm not taking your sickness anymore I'm not bowing down to you anymore I'm gonna be like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego if we got to go to the fire we're going to the fire because we're not bowing we refuse to bow we refuse to be in we refuse to give up we refuse to run we're sons and daughters of the Living God this morning Roman makes a statement he says now what Christ was then we have positionally the same powers today I don't think you come to Heather as then we positionally had the same powers today open the blind eyes oh not only open the blind eyes but make spit on the ground and put eyes into somebody's socket what he was in we positionally had the same powers today you say brother do you mean we can do that I'm just declaring what the word says he the same size the same wonders the same God he didn't quit being God when he left the shores of Galilee he's the same God to nature the Bible says as Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and tomorrow if he healed the suggestion a he can heal the sick today if he raised the dead yesterday he can raise the dead today the Bible says that he is the same Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever if he's the saying today as he was yesterday than I asked you where is he yet brother Jesse where's the F he's here right here oh he's not in the corporal body called Jesus Christ he's not in the body of his seventh angel and we find revelations 10-7 he's not there revealing the word opening mysteries of God to us that's all been done God has amore fade himself into another vessel God has changed his mass now he's no longer in in Jesus Christ the corporal corporal bought in a flesh body of the Incarnate God himself to being the invisible God being made visible through the new his son Jesus Christ he's no longer in that form he's no longer in the seven angels form but what form is he in Church he is in the form of his bride he is in the form of his Lord revealed brought that's where he said today he's the same God the same power the same side the same one the same anointing he's the same God he just changed his role and he's either this morning and you and how's this one his sons and daughters of God you say what brother Joe I need a scripture for that well I'm glad you do cautions one verse 26 he says even the mystery which has been hidden from generations notice it's been a mystery for ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you there it is Christ in you is the hope of glory see that's the position that he has today is it's in you it's Christ in Bride for so can't you see who you've been called to be well many times let me just he's no longer in the human flesh of Jesus Christ but I will say he's the same today he's the same today he's the same in power he's never digressed he's the same in word he's never lost any power the word will perform that which it was a it was purposed he's the same but it's just in a different body no longer he's in a one-man ministry now he's in a multi-member body called the bride of Jesus Christ in the message the deity of Jesus Christ the property God would say this he says now let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power God say it's Rome but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost I mean you got the Holy Ghost this morning let me just read that again for you that's got the Holy Ghost he said now let the people who deny the power of God say that it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're so little tower down something you're not your sons and daughters of God deity is not in heaven deity is in you this morning or did you hear that dislocating is not in heaven Danny's right here in this room this morning he's right here in you and I this morning we're looking off in the future for Dede to come we're looking off for a millennium where our bodies on our leg I'm going to tell you Krim looking off there why it's here right now don't miss what God is doing riding on this so he no positionally who he was and brother Bram says and if you new tonight he goes if you know position who you was and what you are tonight he says there wouldn't be one feeble person left in this building takes five minutes see that's right the thing of it is you're looking off into the millennium some something to happen when it's already here it's already here now we're sons of God not will be we are right now because if you only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer anything you had desire of our need of only thing you have to do is ask and receive so what sort of things you desire when you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it there's no question to it you got a need this morning he said ask you recognize who you are in the body you asked he's going to give it to you and he said whatsoever but many times we look at all mistakes you get up in the morning you get dressed you start brushing your teeth and you realize how lack see your breath is that's all right - laughs y'all crack a little smile I know we're in the frozen Chosin up here right we'll just I'm gonna quit down I'll never be invited back but we look in the mirror and we start seeing all our shortcomings how we failed and you know we failed yesterday and we woke up and you know we're being so condemned for for the life that we live or the choices that we made and you know all we can see is our failures all we can see is our mistakes and we're constantly being reminded of the enemy of our shortcomings how many am I just talking to myself I'm glad I got some people that share that this morning and we start thinking where there's no use God can't use me God won't use me I might as well give up I might as well quit let me just share some some people that God decided use in the Bible that's all right this morning how many I ever heard of the man called Noah no no no way he got all them all them animals two by two on that big oh Noah was a drunk and God chose Noah Abraham was old so don't tell me that you're old and you can't do this Abraham was old and notice he told lies and yet God chose to use Abraham Jacob was a shyster and a liar and yet God chose to use Abraham or Jacob matter Moses had a stuttering problem in a hot temper and yet God chose to use Moses Gideon was a coward a afraid and yet God chose to use Gideon Sampson had a problem with women and yet God chose Sampson Isaiah preach the gospel naked and yet God chose Isaiah Jonah ran from the Friends of God hey God changed owner Oh what about the women brothers Oh pray God chose me she was a prostitute and may God chose my hair Rahab a prostitute but in town and yet God saw fit to bring her in union with some Oh a general an Israelite army and their union grow for Boaz and Boaz marriage in town a lullaby by the name of Ruth and their Union brought forth obey and obey brought forth Jesse and Jesse brought forth Davis and daya with the very son he's a good son believes that Jesus Christ to come to the table is a man after God's own heart and yet he was a murder and yet he was an adulterer but yet through this line of dejected rejected people God chose us in his son through don't tell me God can you shoot don't tell me God won't use you I'm gonna tell you God is here to use you this morning God has positioned you if he can take a Rahab a prostitute and use her to bring forth to his promised son surely he can use you to bring forth the promised son hallelujah and the messages pergamene church Hays the Prophet Agabus was saying I just want to read this as as it were as it involves our concerns to church he says one night I was seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write and I grasped my pen to write and his spirit gave me a message for the church and I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride how many of your bride this morning all right says in the last days the true bride church Christ seed will come to the headstone she will be the super Church a super race as she nears him day and abroad will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God from a little group a true seed of the word God will present Christ with the beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she was a virgin because she knows no man's trees or dogmas but by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be manifest in a virgin the members of this virgin bride a virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials oh quit looking at your face and look at your potentials this morning for he is their head all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads he shows her now listen he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for it to see be planet and the water will raise it up again here's a secret of it the Lord is in the bride as it was in Mary and the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he was done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord notice what you have in your position or as your position you have this saith the Lord and when thus sayeth the Lord is spoken it will never return void but it will accomplish that which its purpose he said those in the broad will do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they had thus said the Lord all they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word that he did not complete all his work while he was here in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that her it was not yet time for him to do a certain thing but he must do now but now listen now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for a specific time so God is here in this age for a specific reason to a specific person or people I brought for a specific time to finish the work that he didn't complete back in the days gone by so God has a plan for our lives and God expects us to yield our lives to him to where we surrender our wheels to the will of the Father is that okay this morning but brother branham was saying like this one of the greatest curses of all the Full Gospel Church is not positionally knowing what they are in Christ so the greatest curse that we can have Church is not recognized in who we are not recognizing the position that we hold just alright he says now the devil is just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to push something somewhere else some of these days gone by listen what he says here he says you are now I want y'all catch this how many times he says the word now you are now now we're sons of God now we're seated together in heavenly places now we have all powers in heaven and earth we have it not in the Millennium we won't need it then we got it now right now we're sons and daughters of God Church quit looking at your failures good looking at your mistakes and look to what the word says right now I wish I had the voice to preach near your sons and daughters of God he says what you're here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else Oh church you're only doing here what he's already seen you doing there whatever you do when the sons are gone when the sons of God the stars shine a tweet oh that was you sobbing that was you worship it that was just praising God hallelujah well I wish I had more voice whoo this is what you are here is a reflection of what your somewhere else those that he called he just to find those that he just about he's already glorified excuse me already in the presence of the Father we have a gorfod body a body that's never seen it I bought it it don't get old I bought it don't get aches and pains about it it don't lose eyesight about it don't get stumped over no Church what we are here is what we are somewhere else I should give you enough reason this moment to rejoice at this saying everything is all cracked up to be this is not to eternal home church God's got something greater he says not go prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you to myself it wasn't so hallelujah Church they say your final resting place but is that somewhere greater for you as the bride if this loosely Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting we have another home a future home already waiting already prepared and for Joe Adams is about that tall maybe a few little pounds lighter I hope at least oh we got another home already there so what does it matter we have a position and there ain't enough Devils inhale can keep you from becoming what God's ordained you to become see the Bible says the beloved now we are the sons of God that's in first John 3 and verse 2 beloved now we are the sons of God and they're doing that yet appear what we shall be but we know when we when when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is notice I didn't make myself a son you didn't make yourself a son or a preacher didn't make you a son God made you a son to keep you from it so let the devil triger they can't stop you Church God made you what you are this morning God allowed you to hear this message this morning it's God's choosing as God's election Aries - predestination it's God's calling every bit of it has to do with God he said God predestinated us before the foundation of the world to the adoption of sons how you gonna stop it how you going to stop these and all the devils and hermanas will quit fussing about it it's gonna be there without spot without a wrinkle all talking about that bud this morning without a spot ain't no wriggle on your life church it's going to be what a bride church hallelujah God said so a bride church see you're not a Christian this may help some of you're not a Christian by your desires but you're a Christian by GaAs desire because no man can come to the Father less he draws you so you didn't make yourself this God made you this and not only are you a Christian not only are you the BA but we look in Revelation is one of verse six take your Bibles let's turn there let's say also notice who we are in the body well Jesse might to get you to give me one more cup of water trying to keep this throat the Bible says in Revelations 1:6 and he has made us y'all say that kings and priests how I don't feel like a king Oh Phil are you King bill - come on we're not going on how we feel we're going about what the word says about it and he has made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever what does it mean to be a king it means you have a Dominion you got rulership Church you ain't gotta do nothing calling you to be rude oh he who ruled over God called you don't rule over your enemy and not only did he make you a king but he made you a priest you're the intercessor you have access to you got access to the Father not everybody has access as a priest you get the opportunity trust they go into the Holy of Holies and present your sacrifice well once it was dead to go in now is that not to go in see God made you a king not to be ruled by the devil not to be ruled by lust or passion or fear our complexes are sickness but he made you to rule your enemy I said he made you to rule your enemy when that evening comes up and says I'm gonna take you down he said no you're not I'm King this morning I preach this morning I got a right to the throne I got a right to the trailer I got a right to total healing I'm not my position this morning notice David David was elected David was called and David was anointed and David was place when David went to face his Goliath he wasn't shaking in his boots Church some 14 15 year-old kid he knew his God he knew that he didn't called himself God called him from hurting and not only did he call him he elected him and then he anointed him what they are the oil what did he place David in a position to be the king Dave Ben knew that he was an honorable prophetic message to be the next king so it didn't matter what he faced he didn't matter how big the jaws were they've been knew he's going to get been seen in a promise he was the next king he was the next king I'll let me tell you Church this money you have been anointed by authentic message there'll be water king and a priest and it doesn't matter what W faces money ain't no devil stop you this morning why should we fear Church why should we fret God's Word is true you have been a made of King you have been positionally placed here to rule over your enemy he says now in the presence of the Almighty your name right now is in doubly indelible excuse-me wrote with the blood of Jesus Christ glorified in his presence indelibly can't be removed your name is already written there positionally placed here on earth for a purpose to do the will of God he says see your position Christian to do the will of God not only are you here as a king and a priest but you're also here as an ambassador you know what an ambassador is it's a representative and I love what the Bible says in Matthew 18 and verse 18 enough I wonder so many times if we don't we don't catch the grass or the hold of this he said verily I say to you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ho Church why are we living below our god-given privileges whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and we're serving you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven he says all powers of heaven is giving it to my head go and I will be with you whatsoever you borrow Oh in heaven and whatever you loose on earth I loose it in heaven Church that's the words that we have to live by this morning he goes or if the great holy church only realizes power to do these things but there's so much doubt there's so much fear and trembling wondering if it will if it could happen as long as that exists a church to never stand upright when every talk of fears vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control well the church and all fears are going and that church has no power and they have everything that heaven owns is behind back people Church 10 fasteners to the throne absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority has everything that Christ owes Bulow's to that ambassador and he would say like this if united states of this fair land here sent me over to Russia to be an ambassador to the nation of Russia then if they have officially sent me to Russia in all the power that United States has is behind me so if I was an ambassador of Russia and anything I said all the power of the United States would have to back up my word brother Jesse well and if God had made you an ambassador of his goodwill of that Kingdom and whatsoever you say alright heaven all the angels our Guardian is behind you this but does you recognize I am the bride of Jesus Christ this is all the power that's in heaven all that God is all the angels all power says behind our words if we are correctly and ordained sent messengers to the people God has to honor the word for he has solemnly written whatsoever you bind on earth I will bind it in heaven and whatever you loose on earth I'm gonna loose it in heaven just check it how long I've gone so you have a position see you might you might be called to be a housewife which you got a position in Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost the brother Brennan would say like this he's at the Ministry of the bride and the Ministry of the cry of cry is the same ministry so don't think you don't have a ministry you may never preach but you got a ministry because you got a position and God placed you there he says now the Ministry of Christ will be in the church that's exactly like him in the spirit when he comes to take the church to redeem the whole thing it goes up see in the beginning of the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of the revelations many others have spoke over the bride see it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom than it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him do you see who you are this morning you're him form and as a son and daughter of God you have mountain-moving power as a son and daughter of God you got this devil destroying authority come on church recognize who you are this morning you got devil destroying Authority you got mountain-moving power you got sick of mind throwing tree ability this morning if you can only recognize who you are and who you are and when you recognize who you are that you not just a son of somebody on this earth but you're the son of God and the daughter of God and you recognize who you are this morning and who you are this morning you're standing there taking or devil I'm going to show the God this morning I got rights to the Word of God I got rights to the Tree of Life I got my stew divine healing I got rights the saving grace I got the rights this morning says now the anointed man now the anointed people he was the anointed man in Jesus Christ but now he's the anointed people this morning anointed by what accepting what he turned down coming back with his anointing of the word because he my word his spear see anointed with the word one eat turned down he comes back and we accept I asked you this morning what did he turn down her position as the word bride well but he has come back in this day by the word and what we do we accept that word today and we accept our position as the word broadchurch l don't you see who you are now we are sons of God now we're daughters of God it's your personal property belongs to you it's God's gift to you nobody can take it away from you it's yours here's what we need tonight is somebody else who knows where they're at what we need tonight is men and women who knows their position in Jesus Christ that's what we need today Church it's men and women sons and daughters to recognize who you are this morning the Bible says in Romans 8 and verse 38 try and persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord said well Joe how can you be so persuaded because the words already declared I see myself in the word I know what I used to be I know what I used to do but I know what the word has made me I see my position that is a preacher but as a son of God he Joseph let me just get to help me start bringing this reppin this down to a close I've been riding in an hour he said he chose a bride knowing that Eve would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall they are predestinated predetermined God knew the choices that you would make before you ever came into existence he knew that you would have a desire to serve Him and based on that desire that you had God predetermined your future and he predestinated you to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to church for that great and glorious stand but see Satan wants your position but I like what he says in Isaiah 14 or Isaiah 14 verse 15 see Satan's all too clear and I'm gonna send into heaven I'm gonna be exalt my my congregation into the size of North I'm gonna be above the clock the heights of the cloud I'm gonna be like the Most High yet in verse 15 he says yet thou shalt be brought down to hell he can't have your position I said he can't have your position nobody can take your place Church God's got a purpose for you God got a position for you recognize who you all recognize the position that you hold as I ended on this story here we're all familiar with the Civil War correct y'all one oh we already declared that it's okay but in July 2nd 1863 on the border strip the other side of a southern Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg there was a battle that was about to take place in the Union Army was north to south lined up and there was two great big heels that they call big Round Top and Little Round Top whoever in Little Round Top was a further estanque or the very left the very extreme south side of this whoever controlled Little Round Top will control the countryside to the far west for miles and miles and mile and so as a inverse or converged on to Gettysburg here the Union Army realized that they didn't occupy Little Round Top so on July the second they begin to make a mass move to get people over there to get forces over their equipment and they they begin train and you had to 44th New York then you had to 83rd Pennsylvania and then you had to 20th Maine they were lined up from the very west of the very south or very left flank and the 20th Maine was led by a man by it was named as Joshua Chamberlain and he was just a misfit of me and 386 men and some of them committed mutiny and they should have been killed because they diverted or deserted their their previous posts and yet they they just kind of put this little group together at the last minute you know kind of much like God's done today just put this little group together at the last minute but yet you find these 386 men they were given strict orders on that day you defend this Hill at all cost if it cost you your life you don't retreat if it cost you your life you can't give up no matter what if this if this is Freight then the whole Union Army will be defeated and will lose the battle you've got to defend this position at all cost so if they ran they would be Tito if they stayed they may die it didn't matter in a day they were post the Confederate Army Tom and Tom and Tom but yeah then it was getting to the point where they were going out of ammunition and just wrote able to begin to survey the man and he's looking he realized that they don't have enough ammunition to counter one more attack and he said boys fix your bayonet sometimes we gotta throw our source church he said boys fix your bayonet and on my charge he run down there screaming you November here they come the Confederate Army was coming up the hill and Joshua chambers all right boys to heart and they come running down the hill very ferocious and the son of mommy just gave up because they were tired they were defeated and they won the great victory that day Church our ammunition but they had a result in that post and uncles they didn't retreat Hey Dude go back hey kid give up what is the same religion this morning we're not here this morning to finish a little rattle top no you're in the position of being the bride of Jesus Christ you don't let this great there's not another age there's not another messenger you're the last on the left and this little lamb out it's got a man through this morning somebody's gonna hold their position somebody's going to go true to the word if it cost you your life defend this position at all cost and like Joshua say fix your bayonets draw your swords impress the battle draw your sword if this mess is gonna live in the lives I mean and women are tomorrow it's gonna live in allow so many women today they refused to retreat they refused to give up they refused to divert no matter what the persecution no matter what the trials no matter what the situation is a lot they face we're determined we're gonna hold our fixed bayonets and fight to the finish god bless you let's pray father we bow our heads in prayer Lord we lord we're so thankful that you called us into a position or what a high and holy calling Lord to be the bride and know that the enemy is on the attack Lord to keep us from becoming who we've been called to be her Lord we recognized through the the preaching of the word this morning Lord no preacher put us in this place no man called us O God to this place you called us you placed us and you position us in order says you're calling you're placing your doing then there's no devil in hell can stand before it only may try to put a roadblock here and a roadblock there and they try to flank our left or extreme left God but we're here's a people this morning in Akron Ohio Lord we refuse to retreat what we're going to defend this position as being this elected body no matter what it costs us Oh God it may cost us Fame it may cost us prestige it may cost us fine it may cost whatever it does God we're here to serve notice on the enemy we're your children Lord we're sons and we're daughters of God not by our own choosing not bar own desires but by your desire father and I just pray this morning Lord you'll take this simple message father I wish I had more voice to be able to preach it Lord more strength this morning father but you know the way they did should go father and I just I pray that the world will accomplish that which he was purposed then they were dropping to the heart and to the life of the believer this morning well there go away Lord no longer said and no longer defeated Oh God but there go away strengthen this morning Lord recognizing that they have been called elected anointed and placed in position of power in position of authority in position of rulership so father I ask that you just to bless the people now let's brother Jesse in this little church Lord this morning may you continue to strengthen Lord in to to add to the fold here God we love you Lord we just give this messages into your hands this morning for we asking in Jesus name Amen brother Jesse hey man [Music] every person here has a purpose God made each one of us for a purpose we heard this morning that we are sons and daughters of God with a purpose in a position I think we all know too is our brother preach you go from elected to call it anoint into positions like to first offer prayer for anyone who doesn't know their position because you cannot operate in your position until you know your position so we're doing two to two opportunities for prayer if you don't know your position and you want God to show your position and God's here to answer that request but if you know your position but maybe not operating in it as you should as our brother said when you're in position you speak the word you bind you loose you intercede you take Dominion amen so you're your own groan one of those today right we're all on one of those days where they're wondering well what is my position I don't know what I'm supposed to do in the church I don't know what I'm supposed to do my family I don't know I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here or we know what we're called to do but we want to know God's will on what to do praise God perhaps you're sick though perhaps you're in need of other prayer perhaps you want to stand in for somebody that will be the second the second poll here so let's first let's bow our heads for a moment let's be honest before God God has sent our brother here to preach the word can't you feel the presence of the Lord can you feel God's presence and do you feel the sacredness of the word this morning hey buddy do you feel God's love too for you this morning I feel God's love for me this more I feel as presents I feel the the sincerity and power of the word I feel that let's go before the Lord Heavenly Father we want to take these two opportunities Lord as I'm listening and pulling and receiving thanking you for this word but I feel feel obligated Lord to first see who needs to know their position then also once Lord we know our position then we need your your will we need to know what to do in imposition dear God so lord I offer this prayer Lord before I call nor would you show everyone in our church their spiritual position in Christ their natural position in their home in their in their their personal life but also Lord show them their spiritual position whether it's in music weather and then everyone has one of the nine gifts Lord God for you show them that Lord if it's leadership like a deacon trust needs [Music] preacher one of the five code gifts if they're wondering what their gift is Lord I pray you'd show it to the Lord through a green together in prayer that we would not wander around and say what am I supposed to be doing where am I supposed to dwell spiritually what am I supposed to be doing father I praise grant everyone Lord who causes their home church to know their position so they can labor for the master father also I pray afterwards Lord if if those who know their position Lord need your grace you need your leadership Lord God to know the next step to speak or to pray or interceder a touch of healing lore whatever may be lord I pray you grant that for your glory to your God that's why you called Joshua to lead the people in and then position them naturally oh god we know Ephesians does the same today positions are spiritually dear God thank you lord thank you Jesus or position your people Lord and then empower your people need your people Lord may they defend their position in Jesus Christ name Amen if I would like I'd like to invite anyone up for prayer we have the oil here to pray for you Oh Joe's here to pray with you does anyone wonder what their position is in the body of Christ please come up to this side here I would want to make that request I feel light of the Lord to make that request here praise God what's the song we can see
