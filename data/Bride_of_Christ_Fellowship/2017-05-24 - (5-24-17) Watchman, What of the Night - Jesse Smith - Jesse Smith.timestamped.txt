[24:56] [Music]
[25:06] [Applause]
[25:12] like to look at this little thought I
[25:16] don't think ever preaches before I like
[25:19] to look at watchin one of the night and
[25:21] I can look at that program breaches
[25:23] message twice so Isaiah chapter 21 if
[25:25] you got your Bibles there by the grace
[25:27] of the Lord I was reading my Bible and
[25:30] come across I will look at a little bit
[25:34] 33 and then if anyone go this into
[25:38] another night a few weeks ago so I did
[25:41] listen to again this morning I read it
[25:44] actually read it this morning
[25:45] listen to this afternoon by God's grace
[25:47] and I think lesson to your help with the
[25:51] Lord kind of goes with what I'm
[25:54] increasing the last few weeks about
[25:55] begin to be papal to the house of God
[25:57] and all these things and try to warn the
[25:59] people you know Satan is trying to
[26:01] battle the church you know I think it'd
[26:04] be a good message to help us out your
[26:06] grace of the world so let's go to Isaiah
[26:09] chapter 21 and mother ran dry verses 1
[26:13] to 12 or just the tiniest and I just
[26:16] want to lead at 11 and 12 as a chapter
[26:27] 21 11 12
[26:32] [Music]
[26:36] the burden of Douma eikhoff to me out of
[26:41] Seir Watchmen one of the night watchmen
[26:44] what of the night watchman said the
[26:47] morning cometh and also the night if ye
[26:52] will inquire inquire ye returned come I
[26:58] go to zto chapter 3 this is where God
[27:08] calls Ezekiel or Watchmen as a prophet
[27:12] first you know watch me report in those
[27:15] days world's technology
[27:19] Zico 3:17 son of man I made thee a
[27:33] watchman unto the house of Israel
[27:35] therefore hear the word in my mouth
[27:38] gives em warning from me when I say unto
[27:42] the wicked thou shalt surely die and
[27:44] thou give us him not warning nor speak
[27:47] this to warn the wicked from his wicked
[27:48] way to save his life the same wicked man
[27:51] shall die in his iniquity but his blood
[27:53] will I require at thine hand yet if thou
[27:58] warn the wicked and he turned not from
[28:00] his wickedness nor from his wicked way
[28:02] he shall die in his iniquity but thou
[28:05] hast delivered thy soul amen the started
[28:10] for word of Prayer feeling you know your
[28:11] heart just may be known only to God yet
[28:12] as you look at watching what of the
[28:14] night father we love you here tonight
[28:17] over our heads lord thank you for the
[28:19] prayers on end of the short little
[28:21] worship Lord God on a teeny bit horse
[28:24] nor that I thank you for this time here
[28:27] I'll just pray by the holy spirit lord
[28:29] you begin ministering to us in light
[28:32] morning I've just felt that these last
[28:35] few services to give these warnings Lord
[28:38] how important every service is to get
[28:40] our mind and attention back on the word
[28:42] save is battling on every hand to get us
[28:45] thinking and planning everything
[28:48] outside of the word Lord and we were
[28:51] battling distraction traveling his
[28:53] devices before we thank you for this
[28:55] opportunity we can come to your house
[28:57] hear your word for faith cometh by
[29:00] hearing and hearing the Word of God the
[29:02] Lord speak to us here tonight we're
[29:04] grateful for them messages we've heard
[29:06] from your prophet Lord and help us to
[29:08] preach them and live them Lord you said
[29:11] fear not little flock this your father's
[29:14] good we live in the kingdom Lord and I
[29:16] thought of that promise here tonight nor
[29:18] with the key of the scripture Lord in
[29:21] the strong hand of faith I hold on that
[29:23] promise you'll give us the kingdom if we
[29:25] just fear not dear God you think it'll
[29:28] be less of each and every heart and soul
[29:30] that press their way out to the house of
[29:31] the Lord are you just Minister now by
[29:33] your Holy Spirit Jesus Christ knee
[29:36] turned said Amen god bless you'd be in
[29:38] series alone now if I didn't switch over
[29:41] research PC him use my iPhone and I was
[29:49] on without a workout okay all right
[29:50] praise Allah ice cream all right so then
[29:56] I never listen to watch me water the
[29:58] night before later listen okay well so
[30:01] he preaches their two sermons are really
[30:03] short that's why I can get through this
[30:04] morning assessment they're really short
[30:06] service but you know I found out I did a
[30:08] search on it too and the message and he
[30:10] he they'll just hit it you know Ram will
[30:13] hit it just kind of briefly throughout
[30:14] different messages like presuming 62 and
[30:17] some sermons in 1964 so I think you'll
[30:20] like it by the grace of the Lord that's
[30:23] a picture of favor watch and see he's
[30:24] not fall asleep he's at the post of duty
[30:26] praise God want to be how many want a
[30:30] faithful watching in the shop and said
[30:34] that God has them today faithful
[30:37] Watchmen and they're exactly I'm just
[30:39] one of them so we're betting pool that
[30:42] we want to be we all want to be watching
[30:43] right but we all want to be but those
[30:46] who whose God is called to preach the
[30:48] gospel
[30:49] our Watchmen as well watching over
[30:51] flocks and of course you can be a
[30:54] watchman you know on a personal level no
[30:56] doubt about that
[30:57] well you God gives you a word of warning
[30:59] to give to somebody you're watching
[31:01] their lives
[31:02] so let's look at this coffee here I
[31:03] think it will be a blessing to you
[31:05] tonight by God's grace before we go
[31:11] there on a face actually when there is
[31:13] any gospel trumpet the gospel trumpet
[31:16] isn't sounded look at all the enemies
[31:18] are brushed in he don't even hear he's
[31:20] so tired spiritually his eyes aren't
[31:22] even open his eyes aren't open his ears
[31:24] are open to hear Satan coming in to get
[31:26] a flock right
[31:27] he's just unfaithful we don't want that
[31:31] Church do you want to be faithful and
[31:32] I'd be like that fella right there under
[31:35] you right away
[31:36] looking up see if there is any Satan's
[31:39] device that would try to work against
[31:41] our church amen
[31:42] we want to want to be ready we don't
[31:44] want to be unfaithful we want to be
[31:47] faithful praise God so these are the two
[31:49] places he preached it in old objection
[31:51] bill and Lake Park California where
[31:54] preached up so we're going to look at a
[31:56] few highlights but let's turn your
[31:57] Bibles first to Ezekiel 33 we did a
[32:00] sequel three I'll start Ezekiel 33 like
[32:05] I said this noisy Coby came across in my
[32:07] reading I'm still reading through the
[32:09] Book of Ezekiel but I said a few weeks
[32:11] ago came across my reading and I like I
[32:13] always like to preach this on the
[32:15] watchman so if you're 33 goodness
[32:22] thinking at all process of God as we
[32:25] read in chapter 3 but it's just nice to
[32:27] read throughout the world Watchmen were
[32:33] such important workers in those days
[32:35] they were crucial to the survival of a
[32:39] people of a community Seiler City they
[32:43] were absolutely crucial workers so
[32:47] chapter 33 verse 1 again the word Lord
[32:49] came unto me saying son of man speak
[32:50] about people say to them when i bring
[32:53] the sword upon the land if the people
[32:55] the land take a man of their coasts and
[32:57] Senate for their watch I mean all this
[33:00] was coming on us they'll say the Lord
[33:04] told us if when he see the sword come
[33:08] upon the land he blow the trumpet and
[33:10] warn the people then whosoever hear the
[33:13] sound of a trumpet and take
[33:15] not warning of the sword come and take
[33:19] him away his blood shall be upon his own
[33:22] head he heard this out of the trumpet
[33:25] and took not warning his blood shall be
[33:29] upon him but he that taketh warning
[33:31] shall deliver his soul amen
[33:35] I think I had done two verse tonight so
[33:36] if you can that's just a little more
[33:38] verse six but if the Watchmen see the
[33:40] sword cut has blown out the trumpet and
[33:42] the people be not warned if the sword
[33:44] come and take any person from his from
[33:47] among them he's taken away in his
[33:49] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[33:51] the watchman's hand so the watchman's
[33:54] got to warn everybody if not the souls
[33:58] are on his hands he's guilty but if he
[34:01] warns them and the people as someone
[34:03] doesn't hear it the Bloods on their own
[34:05] head right verse seven so thou son of
[34:09] man I set the evil watchman unto the
[34:11] house of Israel therefore I shall hear
[34:13] the word at my mouth and warn them from
[34:15] me why does it God just come down and
[34:18] show himself himself would that be
[34:19] enough warning God found out people
[34:22] don't like that so he sent prophets in
[34:24] their place never is really like that
[34:26] they said don't give us God us prophets
[34:28] the people wouldn't listen even if God
[34:30] did come down they still wouldn't listen
[34:31] to him they laugh at his face they
[34:33] market all these things like that so God
[34:35] said I'll just send preachers I'll just
[34:37] send these products and if there's a
[34:39] real believer they'll hear that preached
[34:41] in a time exactly right they wouldn't
[34:43] hear God anyway now verse 8 when I say
[34:48] to the wicked o wicked man and thou
[34:50] shalt surely die if does not speak to
[34:52] warn the wicked from his way that wicked
[34:54] man shall die in his iniquity but his
[34:56] blood will I require at thine hand
[34:59] nevertheless if not one of the wicked of
[35:02] his way to turn from it if you do not
[35:04] turn from his way he shall die in his
[35:05] iniquity with eyes deliver my soul as
[35:09] you know church if you read through zpo
[35:11] lately it's a lot of warnings against
[35:13] Egypt and you know seer and all these
[35:17] all these kingdoms and Cyrus and all
[35:19] these rulers I mean ever so many
[35:20] warnings
[35:21] it's just a great book reward expen
[35:22] there's in there there's a little bit of
[35:24] hope as well like the dry
[35:25] Oh God promises I'll raise up those dry
[35:28] bones
[35:29] I'll speak life in those dry bones and
[35:31] I'll bring them back to my land amen
[35:33] stick you 144,000 you know the Jews
[35:36] right but also about blackens head unto
[35:38] the bride as well so there's a dual
[35:40] prophecy in there praise God so that's
[35:44] the main scripture that I got for the
[35:46] Watchmen now there's a few where David
[35:48] works with some watchman and come
[35:49] running and watching and see some
[35:51] messengers come running but I don't
[35:52] really get you had to study that so I
[35:54] just want to hit the highlights now on
[35:56] my notes here like I said I took notes
[35:58] because it's a nice short sermon as far
[36:01] as for my timing in this stage in my
[36:03] life but summer is almost here and I can
[36:06] study again or all day where all morning
[36:08] I can study if I like so I'm looking for
[36:10] to that got a little more week of work
[36:11] by yesterday's brother grandma begins
[36:16] with he starts this sermon by telling a
[36:18] story of just a given City a pride of
[36:20] Jewish city and he said what he said
[36:24] I'll watch me that morning had given out
[36:25] an alarm I'm sorry that evening had
[36:27] given out of alarm and he had heard
[36:29] chariots and horses coming from afar so
[36:32] he sounded the alarm he said but nobody
[36:35] took notice of he said women young women
[36:36] God the next morning he said and they
[36:39] were upset with the watchman for his
[36:41] killjoy brother branham said he said the
[36:43] watchman was a killjoy he swelled all
[36:45] their joy their sin that they were
[36:47] having and he said the people don't want
[36:50] someone to take joy or pleasure of
[36:52] sitting on their lives so they said why
[36:54] why do you interrupt our lives and why D
[36:56] we're trying to have fun we're just
[36:58] young we're just trying to live our
[36:59] lives and so what a killjoy that
[37:02] preacher is doesn't snore you can listen
[37:04] to you really like it and they don't the
[37:07] washroom was trying to take all the joy
[37:09] out of their lives for the rhythm set in
[37:11] that like today preacher preach really
[37:14] hard you're just trying you're just
[37:15] upset at us just trying to make our
[37:16] lives joyless
[37:18] well let me tell you if you ever came to
[37:20] the press of Jesus Christ you'd be so
[37:22] full of Joey be so full of love and
[37:25] power and forgiveness and you'd feel so
[37:27] great the trouble is they're scared of
[37:29] this presence they won't confess their
[37:32] sins they won't humble themselves and
[37:33] will pray for others it won't come in
[37:35] his presence the thing is they went to
[37:37] the world for joy rather than
[37:39] Jesus hey man I'm glad to say I've come
[37:42] to Christ and I know what it means that
[37:44] joy unspeakable full of glory I know
[37:46] that needs amen
[37:48] it's exactly right but RAM said they
[37:50] walked around saying oh we got a strong
[37:52] army enough even if even if somebody
[37:54] does come we've got a strong we got the
[37:56] best start so then take heed of the
[37:59] warning and he said we can go ahead
[38:01] enjoy our gambling to go gamble with the
[38:02] soldiers he said have some drinks he
[38:05] said if there really was a some chariots
[38:09] coming our priests and rabbis would tell
[38:12] us it but instead we just got the
[38:13] watchman only so even though even though
[38:16] creatures weren't telling them about the
[38:17] warning just the Watchmen I'm going to
[38:20] make it set to a profit how then there
[38:22] yet but that's that's a true picture of
[38:26] our nation today they've just gone wild
[38:29] they refuse the warning when the true
[38:31] Watchmen gives a warning
[38:33] he's usually classed as a fanatic that's
[38:36] right when's the program classes a
[38:38] fanatic today is no church considered a
[38:40] fanatic Church absolutely let me I'm
[38:45] said now I wrote this time I'm trying to
[38:48] go around bricks and he just injects a
[38:49] thought here about how God always gives
[38:51] a warning before judgment and you know
[38:53] but I have preset in late 1963 future
[38:55] whole sermon on that God always gets a
[38:57] warning before he judges somebody and
[38:59] that scripture because the revelation to
[39:01] God told that fact here in church age
[39:04] which we'll get to in a few of services
[39:05] here he said he told Jess how he said I
[39:08] gave you space to repent but you
[39:10] repented not and if God got Jezebel the
[39:13] lowest of all women spacer head I know
[39:15] that's the spirit in the New Testament
[39:16] instead that but he also gave her space
[39:18] to repent the Old Testament and she
[39:20] repented not and if God even gives her
[39:23] space he's got to give everybody's face
[39:24] repent because he's paid for his
[39:26] merciful he's just he's fair so when I
[39:31] gave examples what we have said his
[39:33] father when he was getting close to
[39:34] death he said he wanted to go back to
[39:36] the homeland to go back to his home
[39:38] place in his known place he come back
[39:40] home and his brother brother Brad was
[39:42] Uncle in other words it had something on
[39:45] his heart to come see his dad but
[39:46] Graham's dad and he said while they were
[39:48] talking his dad had a heart attack and
[39:51] eventually died so he CEO
[39:53] feeling like I'm going home I want to go
[39:55] back to your home life I want to go back
[39:57] to where I was born
[39:58] the man said even his dad was born of
[40:00] that then wrote and said his
[40:03] father-in-law meet us dad I had a
[40:07] feeling to go out and go to the go
[40:09] hunting him and invited brother Brandon
[40:13] rubber have couldn't go and so he said
[40:15] he was out hunting now this was just in
[40:17] 1958 and he heard his mother who was
[40:21] already dead
[40:22] saying Oh Frankie Oh Frankie you're
[40:24] coming home soon so that night brother
[40:27] grandfather bought amita's but dad came
[40:29] into the church program said he sat the
[40:31] second row on the left side I could
[40:33] picture my mind at the tabernacle time
[40:35] in the town at one time and testified
[40:38] that night about that experience and
[40:40] said church pray for me and program said
[40:42] we buried in just a few days later he
[40:45] was sorry to hear from the other
[40:46] dimension right you get a full like all
[40:49] going over I feel God gives every man
[40:52] and woman a warning before they go yes
[40:54] to yes to be just yes to give them a
[40:56] chance to make a right everyone kind of
[40:57] said he does that because God is so
[40:59] loving and merciful he always gives a
[41:02] warning so my bap said what does this
[41:07] mother said God's goodness and His grace
[41:09] does this and he gives the true and
[41:12] heart a warning of the things that are
[41:15] approaching aren't you glad God's
[41:17] merciful to us it warned us of repairs
[41:19] even brother remember when he uh when he
[41:22] whatever when he was going to have that
[41:23] test and Satan was going to test him in
[41:26] the Holy Spirit warns that you got a
[41:27] test be careful and it was two young
[41:30] people kissing it is audience
[41:32] distracting the people bro Graham could
[41:34] have cursed them right but the Holy
[41:36] Spirit said speak forgiveness to them
[41:38] remember that and as a great test where
[41:41] he had to overcome Kirsten have in order
[41:42] to be a mercy to them there's the other
[41:45] test where the preachers running quarter
[41:46] him on the Serpent's seat and God showed
[41:49] him beforehand I forget the preacher his
[41:51] name but it was up and showed it
[41:52] beforehand they were going to change the
[41:54] rooms and each person would be sitting
[41:55] there
[41:56] and brother Brad was warned ahead of
[41:57] time and thought of that and he said 400
[41:59] preachers wanted all the tapes on water
[42:01] baptism after that not enough never got
[42:03] that
[42:04] but the point I'm giving you is that God
[42:06] gives warnings if we can hear his voice
[42:09] and that's why we come to church that's
[42:11] why we pray we want to hear God's voice
[42:13] amen
[42:14] you want to hear the warning now after
[42:16] that whether I'm jumps back to his story
[42:18] of the city this Jewish city no matter
[42:21] they did not care what the watchman had
[42:23] to say they spend their time in the
[42:25] taverns that day soldiers drinking he
[42:28] said the spirit of whiskey they had all
[42:30] these things he said but because they
[42:32] refused the warning Conrad said in a few
[42:34] hours the chariots of the horses came
[42:36] rushing through the gates and overtook
[42:38] the city he says giving like a fictional
[42:40] store and what it might be like to
[42:42] reject the warning of a true option and
[42:47] then program goes into the duties of a
[42:49] watchman he said a watchman must be
[42:52] selected
[42:53] he must be alert to the heavenly bodies
[42:55] in the sky but man said people would get
[42:59] up in the middle night and kind of walk
[43:00] around the city as they watching what is
[43:02] the night what time is it
[43:03] and the watcher would look up and see
[43:05] well this time at this time you see
[43:07] anything in the stars this guy with
[43:09] nothing unusual tonight romancey was
[43:11] shot it down they go back to their sleep
[43:13] and go back to whoever they would and he
[43:17] said he said I wonder he said I wonder
[43:20] if we should call out to our watchman
[43:22] today because the whole world seems to
[43:25] be shaking another day yet McMansion the
[43:28] washington had to be on duty at all
[43:30] times of the night he was to warn the
[43:32] people of approaching danger he was up
[43:35] in its high tower that's higher than the
[43:37] walls
[43:37] he had books of astronomy the tower to
[43:41] study see he was studying at good books
[43:43] up there by God's grace he was studying
[43:46] books that others maybe would study and
[43:49] that's what we you and I should be doing
[43:50] studying the books hallelujah he said he
[43:55] can watch the stars until the time he
[43:57] could see the way further than other men
[43:59] because he was up higher he could see
[44:03] better Aram said to those who were
[44:04] earthbound and just stayed on the earth
[44:06] that didn't climb up into the higher
[44:08] spheres of
[44:09] every one o'clock and the higher spheres
[44:11] of God brother Branham says the higher
[44:13] you climb in God the more sinful this
[44:15] world looks then the cussing looks worse
[44:18] the movies look worse the movies will
[44:21] look worse the makeup the adultery the
[44:24] pornography the higher you getting God
[44:26] the worse it looks eventually you ever
[44:29] get those fears it looks worse the
[44:32] higher you get so see when we start
[44:33] getting loose warts inner not thinking
[44:35] that's bad what have we gone we've come
[44:37] down rather going up I say let's go back
[44:39] up and nothing does that like a good
[44:41] service in God's presence a man a good
[44:44] prayer time a good preaching time a good
[44:46] worship in time
[44:47] nothing does like that than getting in
[44:49] the presence of God amen but after
[44:52] Isaiah was God's watchman and God like
[44:55] in his watchman of the prophets because
[44:58] he says Eagles are built special for
[45:00] their oath altitude
[45:02] he said God special designed the eagle
[45:06] but as if God still has evils on the
[45:09] power today who climb in the spirit
[45:11] above all scientific research yes men
[45:16] specially designed for had they stand by
[45:18] the brothers said they don't stand on
[45:20] the tower
[45:20] he said they stand up on top of the
[45:23] cross he says and they send the message
[45:26] back with Gus save the Lord in grandmas
[45:29] that's our power today the cross of
[45:31] Christ internet so we stand on the cross
[45:34] and look out and see at the danger
[45:36] that's coming hallelujah
[45:38] but man said their sight is far beyond
[45:41] the ordinary man in the regular walk of
[45:44] life member ramdux attorney says let's
[45:47] turn our attention to the king of the
[45:51] tower watchers the mansion is the Lord
[45:54] Jesus himself on earth and he knows I
[45:57] was going into Jesus being prophetic on
[45:59] earth Jesus spake more of his second
[46:02] coming then he did his first coming of
[46:05] you know that remember of John chapter
[46:07] 14 chapters 14 because Judas leaves in
[46:11] 13 right the the their communion where
[46:14] Judas left 14 15 and 16 Jesus tells all
[46:18] about a second coming
[46:19] how do you know that Matthew 24 Luke
[46:22] said
[46:23] t he spent a much of his second pole
[46:26] ministry I don't understand that yet
[46:27] repose the first pole of the miracles
[46:29] second pole was the prophesied third
[46:32] pole was after the resurrection he of
[46:34] course and he preached after the
[46:35] crucifixion he preached eternal loss and
[46:37] the ministry after the resurrection we
[46:39] understand that so in his second pole he
[46:42] was prophesied for telling about his
[46:44] second company that his first coming he
[46:46] was already here he was already here you
[46:48] did have to deal with that so much
[46:50] he was already foretelling getting the
[46:51] people ready everybody said why because
[46:54] he's the king of the locksmith and there
[46:57] he is he's looking in the future saying
[46:59] this is what it's going to be like at
[47:00] the second coming make ready praise God
[47:03] he's already in the watchtower there as
[47:06] the son of God
[47:07] more telling what he sees 2,000 years
[47:09] old in 2017 amen he sees the latest in
[47:13] church age but he said if you have eyes
[47:15] to see have gold tried in the fire keep
[47:18] your life hot on fire that's what the
[47:20] watcher would say tonight say on fire
[47:22] for Jesus amen
[47:24] Olivia oh man said see he already been
[47:29] prophetic a little bit
[47:30] he said he prophesied of things I would
[47:33] take place he said he talked about his
[47:35] crucifixion foretold that he talked
[47:37] about his resurrection on the third day
[47:40] at David's prophecy that his soul would
[47:42] not be left in hell and his body would
[47:45] not see corruption
[47:46] well then said the Jesus knew no power
[47:49] could keep him in the grave he knew
[47:52] every word of God will be fulfilled in
[47:54] his season Amen Lord
[47:57] everyone said but Jesus had a question
[48:00] it's going to it's going to look 18 if
[48:02] you got your Bibles but man said hey
[48:04] this is the exact scripture brother end
[48:05] quote go to Luke 18 I believe it's Luke
[48:08] 18 just going from my memories I have
[48:10] the scripture try look it up yeah that's
[48:13] it yeah Luke 18:1 well dad said this is
[48:17] Jesus's question as a watchman he's
[48:20] looking out no man said as king of the
[48:22] tower Watchers this is Jesus question
[48:25] we'll just read it up cuz you know you
[48:28] know the story verse 8 18 8 I tell
[48:34] you that he will avenge them speedily
[48:36] nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
[48:38] shall we find faith on the earth
[48:40] everybody said that's the Jesus at the
[48:43] king of the tower Watchers looking out
[48:45] and see the thing he's looking for
[48:47] prophetically is who will have faith on
[48:50] earth when I return what is faith is a
[48:53] substance of things hoped for the
[48:55] evidence of things you don't see we
[48:58] don't see the rapture going off but if
[49:00] you got paid for it you've already got
[49:02] the rapture inside of you then praise
[49:04] God because faith is the evidence that
[49:06] you can already see the rapture that
[49:08] you're a part of it you have to have
[49:10] faith for the rapture packets called rap
[49:12] Street based on an idiot that's what
[49:15] it's called it's called the laterade
[49:16] rapturing faith but this was the watch
[49:20] man Christ this was this question
[49:22] program said will there are you people
[49:25] at the end that will believe and of
[49:26] course the answer is yes would it be a
[49:28] small group because he said you they're
[49:30] unified it and I was short in the days
[49:33] that even the elect would be saved
[49:35] because it's going to be so wicked and
[49:36] so evil
[49:38] exactly right praise the Lord and buy
[49:41] medicine how do you get paid for this
[49:42] rapture he said coming here the Word of
[49:44] God you can hear him say right on the
[49:46] right of the tape you coming tonight
[49:48] those life streaming that are really
[49:50] listening to the things of God where
[49:51] they want they want to have faith when
[49:53] Jesus returns they want to really want
[49:56] to hear the voice of the watchman Christ
[49:58] Jesus and they want to add what he is
[50:00] required
[50:01] he's requiring faith which is this
[50:03] inward evidence the substance that we
[50:05] need to go on the rapture in a night
[50:07] then boom M says then we can look in the
[50:11] Bible and find the very things that the
[50:13] watchman foretold which were signs and
[50:16] wonders men's hearts failing for fear
[50:19] this is Matthew 24 distress between
[50:21] nations that we gotta still North Korea
[50:23] all this distress I ran all these others
[50:26] distressed fearful sights in the sky
[50:29] earthquakes in divers places and atomic
[50:31] weapons program tells a story I mean he
[50:35] met an army army man who was going for
[50:38] his major he called it a rank major he's
[50:41] on the rank in the army
[50:42] his name was Julius stud static that is
[50:45] the army or very nothing
[50:47] Bowles okay great thank you sir nice I
[50:50] got like some but I can fact check it
[50:51] with you couldn't he just don't read
[50:53] about him he's been there that's movie
[50:55] like brother I never said this the stack
[50:58] lift man was coming to be a major of the
[51:00] army said brother branham under oath I
[51:02] can't tell you the secrets he said but
[51:04] our plans the autumn of this has
[51:06] happened yet or not madam said that up
[51:08] he said the plans were we're going to
[51:10] decrease our military and just have some
[51:12] guards around you listen do not take I
[51:14] don't think they've done that get back I
[51:16] think they they increase the budget on
[51:18] military lately did they do not got
[51:19] Trump did that I know I saw I did
[51:21] something with them where everybody was
[51:23] excited about the military priesthood
[51:24] there at least their budget many ways no
[51:27] ma'am said that stack up was under this
[51:29] impression then we're going to try to
[51:31] get rid of lots of soldiers just have
[51:33] guards but then put all their time on
[51:35] ramps and end up being ready to pull the
[51:37] trigger on atomic weapons that's what he
[51:39] said look up trigger number going to see
[51:43] it such a shaking time and then he tells
[51:45] a story
[51:45] he says there's all these flying saucers
[51:47] around him brother have said I don't
[51:49] have they'll say the Lord he said it's
[51:50] my opinion but he said we got to take it
[51:52] back to the Bible he said those flying
[51:54] saucers were investigating angels
[51:56] because he said he takes that baggage
[51:59] that you must take it when we had
[52:00] visitors from the heavens he said we had
[52:02] visitors in the days of Sodom when two
[52:06] angels came down from heaven right and
[52:08] investigated sidle before judgment so
[52:13] brother said that's fine opinion and
[52:15] Byron said notice they had two angels
[52:18] come down he said but God came down too
[52:20] he said God was the watch it in flesh
[52:23] that went to Abraham and Sarah's head
[52:26] other than the up and he was able to
[52:29] discern Sarah's heart behind us back
[52:31] just like brother Adam did
[52:33] that's exactly right so she program to
[52:36] get this from the Bible visitors from
[52:38] heaven things from heaven signs and
[52:40] wonders from heaven all these things we
[52:42] got to take it back to the Bible and how
[52:44] badly were Abraham's seed it's exactly
[52:48] right
[52:49] how do you know because I believe in
[52:51] that watchman that Cain and he said I
[52:54] need to serve the cause of Sarah's heart
[52:56] behind his back I believe that Cain and
[52:58] I'm bagging that message
[53:00] and I believe that with all my heart if
[53:02] you're the seed of Abraham you'll do the
[53:04] works of Abraham you'll believe the
[53:06] minister devendra you'll be trading
[53:07] Abraham and that's why we pay our ties
[53:10] just right and overuse like Abraham and
[53:12] Jacob did and that's why we circumcised
[53:14] the flesh of our honors I hate right
[53:16] Hannah I do yeah it's exactly right
[53:18] that's why we get circumcised and prayer
[53:20] at the office I got forgive me my said
[53:22] take this world away from me and give me
[53:25] Jesus Hannah
[53:27] cut this off from me I don't let this
[53:29] life I don't want this in my life cut it
[53:31] off from me that's why we know what it
[53:32] means to be delivered from addiction we
[53:34] know what it needs to be delivered for
[53:36] Fears and all these shakings and
[53:38] everything like that why cuz rain
[53:39] bearing seed we've been circumcised day
[53:41] that lord but ma'am said the only answer
[53:45] is the watchman he said the Pentagon
[53:48] doesn't have the answer
[53:49] Trump doesn't have the answer the United
[53:52] States does have the answer Germany
[53:53] Rocha none of them have the answer
[53:55] science does have the answer who has the
[53:57] answer the watchman that's on the wall
[54:00] has the answer watchman one of the night
[54:02] and the Holy Spirit is that watchman
[54:05] who's making ready the puny and I was
[54:08] always fear of reach through the
[54:09] fivefold ministry glory and giving
[54:12] worries from God he has been sent as a
[54:15] watchman see we see the sick being
[54:18] healed they gotta got us that's when I
[54:20] was in my last time thank God for that
[54:22] the blinded eyes coming open
[54:25] deaf ears unstop cripples walking the
[54:27] lame leaking leaping like a heart
[54:30] fulfilling what is it it's the coming of
[54:32] the Lord is pressing on that's right
[54:35] the more quote here and I'm going to get
[54:37] to some scriptures and some quotes - by
[54:39] God's grace
[54:40] watch how scripture Isaiah was when he
[54:43] said watch from one of the night he said
[54:44] the morning comment at night also us so
[54:47] let me just turn their time I want to
[54:48] reckon on Labor's on this at the end of
[54:51] the sermon Isaiah 21 leave is 12 I know
[54:57] we read it but I just want to labor on I
[54:58] don't want to misquote it like I said I
[55:00] don't have this memorized I got a
[55:01] revelation 10 7 memorized town 3:16 yo
[55:04] I've got four or five or six I got all
[55:06] this memorized I like this whenever I
[55:07] did you know you just read over so many
[55:09] times and you rejoice it you know how it
[55:11] is you just mention memorize it here
[55:13] preach so many times which
[55:14] god that's the message of the out that's
[55:16] the message now be honored members a
[55:18] british well the watchman said the
[55:20] morning comment also the night if he
[55:22] will acquire inquiry return come now
[55:27] program quotes description he said the
[55:31] morning cometh and the night also see
[55:33] that the morning cometh and also the
[55:35] night program quotes the scripture but
[55:37] whose head program says its what the
[55:39] morning comes but the night comes before
[55:41] the morning offenses that write night is
[55:43] always before morning that's what he's
[55:46] say here
[55:46] the watches are saying wash and what
[55:48] about the night and the watchman said
[55:50] the morning comes but don't forget the
[55:51] night he says this what was it anyone
[55:58] knows that just before the break of day
[56:00] just at the hours of the approaching of
[56:02] the day it turns darker than ever was o
[56:05] my friends listen to the save the lord
[56:09] program said if you consider me to be a
[56:10] servant and just before the break of day
[56:12] that's why this horrible gloom is over
[56:15] the earth it's just before the company
[56:17] of the Lord Jesus there's no more hope
[56:18] left in it nothing but his coming
[56:21] nations are against nations and they
[56:24] have fooled through God's laboratory so
[56:25] they got the power to blow one another
[56:27] to atomic ashes and they are wicked and
[56:30] their unreligious and their unpriced
[56:32] light and the only motive they have an
[56:34] object is to destroy and they're
[56:36] inspired by the destroying angel that
[56:39] was sent from heaven to inspire these
[56:41] men he said was from heaven I thought
[56:44] was beheld when he says from heaven but
[56:46] let me say man said in the name of Lord
[56:49] Jesus the Holy Spirit is sent as a
[56:52] watchman on the tower and as the people
[56:55] cry one of the night are you weary of
[56:58] his life are you weary of sin are you
[57:00] weird your funeral processions and
[57:02] sickness and ungodliness of every hand
[57:04] has the knife and long and weary what of
[57:07] the night watchman he says the morning
[57:09] cometh brother man who said to see the
[57:11] comfort
[57:12] did you guys that the Watchmen gave them
[57:15] comfort they said one of the night one
[57:17] of the night and the watchman said
[57:18] there's coming a morning nighttime was
[57:21] awful during that that's why they had
[57:23] night Watchers remember that they had
[57:24] four night watches you remember that in
[57:26] the Bible nice start
[57:27] at 6:00 p.m. when the Sun went down and
[57:29] then the Sun throws at 6 a.m. right so
[57:32] 12 divided by 4 is every 3 hours add a
[57:34] watch so there's a watch at 9 p.m.
[57:37] watchin was a night there's a watch
[57:39] watch at midnight watch me one of the
[57:41] night I watch it 3 up watching other
[57:43] night and then the last one through
[57:44] course was 6:00 a.m. when the Sun was
[57:46] about to break
[57:47] watch her mother night and they had to
[57:49] have somebody who was awake at all times
[57:51] because that was the great time to
[57:52] attack was night time people were ready
[57:55] good to see could see the forces
[57:57] Watchmen had a hard drive to see but
[57:58] they had that good ears to be able to
[58:01] hear the sound of safe tonight of danger
[58:04] coming so buyback said do you see the
[58:07] cover the watchman coverts that I said
[58:09] one of the night watchmen it's all doom
[58:11] and gloom it's all dark but watch it
[58:12] said the mornings coming Church there's
[58:15] a morning come today bad weather we
[58:17] seated up there is a morning coming
[58:19] hallelujah and if we go to the grave and
[58:21] that morning comes for us as the sixth
[58:23] dimension praise God with a new body
[58:26] with us the operative body the more you
[58:28] will come that day but there's also
[58:29] coming the morning which the rapture
[58:31] starts is the morning that we go to the
[58:33] marriage supper the lamb ain't exactly
[58:36] right that's the comfort there's coming
[58:38] a new day remember the Lord's Day the
[58:41] lower thing is when man's days are over
[58:43] when these government's no rule by Satan
[58:46] or cast out when men or Church on the
[58:48] earth when the trumpet sound when the
[58:50] files report out that's when the lord's
[58:53] day starts when these days of man start
[58:55] falling and over the floor to that amen
[58:58] the Bible said heaven is rejoicing when
[59:00] the vatican's destroyed you know that
[59:02] the Bible said that is hard to think now
[59:05] a human minds but we're thinking with
[59:06] human we're not seeing a God's mind but
[59:09] the Bible said the angels and prophets
[59:11] will all rejoice the twenty-four elders
[59:13] will rejoice when that wicked city that
[59:15] whip your church is cast on the
[59:17] destroyed that's the mind of God that's
[59:19] what heaven thinks about it
[59:21] no Salvia mind of heaven hey while we're
[59:24] here let's have compassion but once we
[59:26] know it was a class all we know it's
[59:27] going to happen we know God is going to
[59:29] destroy that place what did I say not
[59:31] compassion of our demons compassion upon
[59:33] individuals say God come out of her my
[59:37] people let them come out they beat up
[59:39] our takers of our sins
[59:40] eggs in it hallelujah exactly right now
[59:47] see the comfort my ram set the mornings
[59:49] coming and the night is also coming what
[59:52] is the night look how perfectly in
[59:54] harmony with scripture Isaiah was and
[59:55] the regular course of nature always had
[59:58] approaching in the Sun he conceals the
[1:00:00] darkness together it makes it dark it's
[1:00:02] darker before day than any other time in
[1:00:04] the night why it's approaching light
[1:00:07] that's making a dark everybody ever said
[1:00:10] it's the approaching of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:12] now that's bringing this gloom upon the
[1:00:14] earth Laurie did not he say when you see
[1:00:19] these things begin to come to pass
[1:00:21] lift up your head for your Redemption
[1:00:24] draweth that that's in Matthew 24 as
[1:00:26] well program gives two more proofs that
[1:00:29] the judgments coming Israel's didn't
[1:00:32] were homeland
[1:00:33] the man said for the first time in 2500
[1:00:35] years how many saw the Trump how many
[1:00:37] saw the trouble go there this week he
[1:00:39] spent twenty eight hours in Israel not
[1:00:40] even two days but he's near he's a busy
[1:00:42] guy I guess currently but he's the first
[1:00:45] president alive to ever go to the
[1:00:46] Wailing Wall where the Jews pray and
[1:00:49] wail he's the first one ever go there I
[1:00:50] don't know this guy is a pretender or if
[1:00:53] he's actually had a little few moments
[1:00:55] where he's walking lightly before the
[1:00:56] Lord so it feels like he's pretended but
[1:00:59] he's doing things that are kind of
[1:01:00] shocking even Obama did do that he
[1:01:02] didn't hundred the Jews that way right
[1:01:04] he learned it about George W Bush any
[1:01:07] living Jimmy Carter never did that he's
[1:01:09] still alive today I think he's the
[1:01:10] oldest living person that we have if I'm
[1:01:12] not mistaken
[1:01:13] remember Edison photo says another proof
[1:01:15] the judgment is coming
[1:01:16] Israel's in her homeland the second one
[1:01:19] is the spirit discerned this holy spirit
[1:01:22] that deserted Sarah was here today which
[1:01:24] was his ministry he could recognize that
[1:01:26] well this must be the end time because
[1:01:27] here that watchman is deserting Sarah's
[1:01:30] heart and Sodom got heard right after
[1:01:31] that the right understand that by God's
[1:01:34] grace
[1:01:34] so the sermon gift was there through a
[1:01:36] prophet watchman and then destruction
[1:01:38] came and after program saw in his day
[1:01:40] and we saw again the truck the United
[1:01:44] States member the United States is the
[1:01:46] beast out of the land on the land out of
[1:01:51] the North America the Beast the satanic
[1:01:53] spirit
[1:01:54] all in the United States racing up on
[1:01:56] the land and look at look at the truck
[1:01:58] now the guy goes to Saudi Ravan I was
[1:02:00] all buddy-buddy with them and then he
[1:02:02] goes straight to Israel buddy-buddy with
[1:02:03] them and then yesterday or today I'm
[1:02:06] sorry he said the Vatican today you see
[1:02:08] that he got the Pope today and the
[1:02:10] Pope's like this in the picture and
[1:02:12] Trump's like this because they had a
[1:02:15] fight on Twitter last year before he got
[1:02:16] let me remember that they're fighting
[1:02:18] and the Pope said no Christian will
[1:02:19] build a wall and Trump tweeted back and
[1:02:22] said oh I'm a Christian Huck in this man
[1:02:24] judge me well by we can judge by in
[1:02:28] future known when you cuss alone strip
[1:02:31] bars and all these things like that and
[1:02:33] hurt people and do all evil things like
[1:02:35] that sable things when evil things
[1:02:37] proceed out of your mouth it shows you
[1:02:39] got evil things in your heart how can
[1:02:42] bitter water Street water come on the
[1:02:44] same pound Church so we see that look at
[1:02:48] the beast making good relations or
[1:02:51] trying to make good relation I make
[1:02:52] friends with the Jews and the Catholics
[1:02:55] I look at this church I got a couple
[1:02:59] more quotes that we'll move on here I'll
[1:03:01] move on to this program blanket is the
[1:03:03] pastor to the watchman so that's why
[1:03:05] I've been dealing with some of these
[1:03:06] things lady but before that but as that
[1:03:09] the morning cometh that's right there's
[1:03:10] a comfort what's it all about
[1:03:11] it's the making of the morning coming
[1:03:13] and it's pressing toward the light it's
[1:03:15] making roast darkest come just before
[1:03:17] the light goes to shiners just as it
[1:03:19] gets darker reported on here it is today
[1:03:21] the world's getting darker before the
[1:03:23] coming of Christ he said I was so glad
[1:03:26] to be a Christian I'm so glad I am his
[1:03:29] watchman one of them that's standing on
[1:03:32] the wall ha ha I think he's not the only
[1:03:35] one he's one of them that's standing on
[1:03:38] the wall the other Lord crying out to
[1:03:41] the people prepare to meet God for the
[1:03:43] hour of his coming his drawing nigh all
[1:03:45] right now let's get to this this this is
[1:03:48] why this scripture meant so much to me
[1:03:49] because brother Adam started saying is
[1:03:50] the pastoring the fivefold ministry or
[1:03:53] Watchmen as well and as a patch like I
[1:03:56] said the last few service I've inverted
[1:03:57] about our church's dedication you know
[1:04:00] we want to be dedicated to the Lord
[1:04:01] right and like I told everybody on
[1:04:06] Sunday if you can't
[1:04:07] here for service listen to the next day
[1:04:09] because listen if you don't you're going
[1:04:11] to hear one out of three servers the
[1:04:13] Holy Spirit spoke to the church
[1:04:14] so you're two-thirds if you listen to
[1:04:17] one you're two-thirds missing the voice
[1:04:19] of the Holy Spirit not about you but if
[1:04:21] I was a part of a church and I knew God
[1:04:23] has preached by that pulpit I want to
[1:04:25] hear a hundred percent amen I wouldn't
[1:04:27] want to be a one-third I want to be 100
[1:04:29] percent or I go to where I knew God was
[1:04:31] speaking you know
[1:04:32] alright go somewhere I have confidence
[1:04:34] go wherever you have confidence the
[1:04:35] thing to do is hear the voice of the
[1:04:37] Holy G that's exactly right now heesu
[1:04:44] program starts telling your story and
[1:04:45] there's a story the two boys getting
[1:04:47] looking at how much their Middler
[1:04:50] minerals were worth that you sold their
[1:04:51] 50 melted-down that you would body
[1:04:52] insulted he said one look at the others
[1:04:56] at Jim we're not worth very much are we
[1:04:57] said no we're not John I said wait a
[1:04:59] minute
[1:05:00] oh if you got a sold out it's worth ten
[1:05:02] thousand worlds that's been can be
[1:05:04] redeemed by the power of God if you'll
[1:05:06] just let it man when he when he sees
[1:05:09] those things he's responsible to tell
[1:05:11] others now see this is where gets the
[1:05:12] thought about betta watch me he doesn't
[1:05:14] tell those boys listen you're worth more
[1:05:16] than that you're worth more than forty
[1:05:18] three says I saw when I was just a boy I
[1:05:22] spent my whole life at it
[1:05:23] I only sorry I got one life I wish I had
[1:05:26] ten thousand if I hadn't Ernie I still
[1:05:28] want to tell people about it because the
[1:05:30] greatest thing ever found if you'll read
[1:05:32] in Ezekiel 33 we just read that there
[1:05:35] was a watchman set on the Tower of this
[1:05:37] watch it was responsible for the entire
[1:05:39] city amen and I wait yourselves to your
[1:05:42] spiritual context minute while I get to
[1:05:44] this scripture that watchman had to be a
[1:05:47] trained man I didn't know what he was
[1:05:49] doing for it any distance as soon as
[1:05:50] they rose the enemy he could detect it
[1:05:52] he could tell their march you can tell
[1:05:54] their color
[1:05:54] it's how they rank and file just as far
[1:05:57] as human eyes could see he could see it
[1:05:59] and he was higher than the rest of them
[1:06:01] for he was training all the enemy and
[1:06:02] God required over the whole see this
[1:06:04] hand watched in one of the night
[1:06:06] hallelujah that's the way God's soldiers
[1:06:09] are today they're trained to the word
[1:06:12] when anything go comes up it's got a
[1:06:14] little polish to it it's got something
[1:06:15] else it's not Scripture they warn their
[1:06:17] congregation
[1:06:19] right anything that's not Bible anything
[1:06:22] that's not God like such as having soup
[1:06:24] supper as dad says everything else that
[1:06:26] pay off the pastor's those things are
[1:06:28] wrong Bunco games hard' parties in the
[1:06:30] churches it's wrong and the real Roger
[1:06:32] in the wall who's once been and the
[1:06:35] presence of God that's what makes all
[1:06:36] the difference
[1:06:36] someone that's forward to getting if he
[1:06:39] isn't on the wall if he's just supposed
[1:06:41] to be on the wall the wall may not be
[1:06:43] any higher aggress the congregation but
[1:06:46] if he's a correct watch we got raised
[1:06:47] him following the spheres that the rest
[1:06:50] of them never gets to but he watches the
[1:06:52] flock and God requires an appearance the
[1:06:56] man of God who stands in the presence of
[1:06:57] God at the most God is God and those
[1:07:00] that God keeps his word and watch God
[1:07:02] perform himself and do his duty and kiba
[1:07:05] swear that no matter how many
[1:07:06] organizations or denominations tries to
[1:07:08] tear it down
[1:07:09] he knows the rank of the file the enemy
[1:07:12] he knows what to tell the congregation
[1:07:14] Oh real Watchmen that's what I would be
[1:07:18] with you and I salute you goes the
[1:07:21] sisters now
[1:07:21] women you know I love you my sister you
[1:07:23] know that I don't stand to hurt you I
[1:07:25] love you but what am I going to do there
[1:07:27] at that date yesterday when I know the
[1:07:30] Bible teaches what women to do and then
[1:07:33] I know to be the truth and then if the
[1:07:34] watch resist on the walls he's enemy
[1:07:36] among the people and don't warn him God
[1:07:38] so require the blood of the Watchmen
[1:07:39] pain
[1:07:41] so remember applies this watchman to
[1:07:44] himself and now who's he applied to
[1:07:46] pastors when pastors let you cut your
[1:07:49] hair off remember we have the state the
[1:07:51] Lord if you cut your hair as I said Lord
[1:07:52] you're dead you're not born again right
[1:07:55] that's what my mentor said in 1964 and
[1:07:58] say that that's right oh it's okay to
[1:08:00] cut your hair just trip it a little bit
[1:08:02] that Pastor is telling you something
[1:08:03] that's wrong and when he lets you dress
[1:08:05] it in my disclosed and tell you that
[1:08:07] that's all right he said that's wrong
[1:08:10] here's another quote ovaries Jesus in
[1:08:13] Matthew 10 and gave them power is
[1:08:15] unclean spirits program said many
[1:08:17] pastors just let them unclean spirits
[1:08:19] stay right in the church by what not
[1:08:21] preaching against sin what kind of what
[1:08:25] kind of husband would you brothers be or
[1:08:27] you sisters if you happy when you get
[1:08:29] children things like that
[1:08:30] what kind of mother father would you be
[1:08:32] if you let
[1:08:33] sinn lay there in your house and they
[1:08:34] lit it up you'd be an awful parent you
[1:08:38] have to address it look at it address it
[1:08:40] and kick it out of house what kind of a
[1:08:42] patch would I be if I just never preach
[1:08:44] against sin and I know it and I don't
[1:08:47] preach against it with address at card
[1:08:51] parties Bunco games dances soup suppers
[1:08:53] mercy he said oh mercy what kind of pass
[1:08:56] with it not a real watching would it but
[1:08:58] Madison once you're the presence of God
[1:08:59] you'll be able to call those things out
[1:09:01] next quote over Levin raining now God
[1:09:05] has set not man God has set the church
[1:09:07] first apostles secondary profits
[1:09:09] teachers pastor so for God to live in
[1:09:11] the church if God put them in there
[1:09:13] they're qualified for the job right God
[1:09:17] wouldn't put a man in a tower in a
[1:09:19] position like that I said that thinks
[1:09:20] Americans has past got one up and a man
[1:09:23] in a position like that to be a prophet
[1:09:25] or seer that would say that Jesus Christ
[1:09:26] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:29] when the Bible declares him to be God
[1:09:32] would not put a man in the tower there
[1:09:33] that would preach a wishy-washy gospel
[1:09:36] and not tell the truth and warn the
[1:09:38] people of the rafters to cover
[1:09:40] he put a man in there that would be bold
[1:09:43] and would have a spirit that seen the
[1:09:45] other coming judgment and regardless of
[1:09:47] what the people said he warned them
[1:09:48] anyhow cry out against it he doesn't put
[1:09:52] blind prophets in his power he puts
[1:09:54] profits preachers who foresees the
[1:09:56] coming judgement and warns the people to
[1:09:59] flee I just and God knows I just got a
[1:10:02] message on my make up in the Bible video
[1:10:04] today on YouTube I said thanks for being
[1:10:07] so bold and preaching the truth and not
[1:10:11] caring about people's feelings and I
[1:10:13] said Laurie to God I said wasn't me it
[1:10:15] was Christ at a minute which we've lost
[1:10:17] friends we've lost you know we've lost
[1:10:20] associates because that that video make
[1:10:22] up in the Bible amen
[1:10:23] that's okay we name Christ amen whenever
[1:10:27] we lose Jesus said I'll make it up today
[1:10:30] God will not leave anybody uh you won't
[1:10:33] anybody anything
[1:10:34] amen if you lose he'll add to you it's
[1:10:38] exactly right
[1:10:40] fellowship when I seen that woman
[1:10:42] another morning he led her to Christ
[1:10:44] after 90 I just wondered I just want
[1:10:46] them to be since
[1:10:47] and they never stand up administers
[1:10:49] maybe that one on the platform the other
[1:10:50] night but as I said you called out and
[1:10:53] told him he was smoking cigarettes right
[1:10:54] the platform in front everybody did the
[1:10:56] Holy Spirit spare his feelings
[1:10:57] absolutely not
[1:10:59] the Holy Spirit caught out his smoking
[1:11:00] right on the pub I've heard numerous
[1:11:02] times on the tapes but having said how
[1:11:05] you called his sins out and yet a
[1:11:07] preacher god I love that brother I love
[1:11:10] all that brothers but if I did it
[1:11:11] there'd be something wrong with me
[1:11:14] that's why there's some problem these
[1:11:15] mega preachers on TV that never preach
[1:11:17] against sin grace God there's something
[1:11:21] wrong with them they're trying to build
[1:11:23] the church rather than clean the church
[1:11:25] I don't want you to be with the church
[1:11:27] clean not full like the head I've got it
[1:11:29] fills it up break up if not fill us with
[1:11:31] love yeah
[1:11:32] bizzy's has DCC fill with angels I
[1:11:35] didn't it yeah I would have full church
[1:11:36] like that for the church that's washing
[1:11:38] the butter cried a man rather have that
[1:11:41] any day of the week amen he said but
[1:11:44] Lord when I have to speak it out let
[1:11:46] them know it's not me doing it it's your
[1:11:48] spirits calling out the sin of the world
[1:11:50] and how can I hold my peace and maintain
[1:11:52] my visual or I cannot do it and let them
[1:11:55] not feel evil but just go to the word
[1:11:57] and seek God see if I may I say let the
[1:12:00] here's a my preaching not feel evil when
[1:12:02] I preach against their sin but he said
[1:12:04] may they go to the word and seek God
[1:12:06] about it that's all any preachers that's
[1:12:10] your that's your desire when you witness
[1:12:11] to somebody right it's not to make them
[1:12:13] mad it's the hope that they don't see
[1:12:15] God because of that see that be right
[1:12:18] I'm not trying to get people when I
[1:12:21] share my message videos around I'm gonna
[1:12:23] try to get people upset I'm trying to
[1:12:25] say those who can be saved
[1:12:26] amen there's another conference coming
[1:12:30] no I'm just kicked out here talks about
[1:12:32] every time you hear ambulance it's a
[1:12:33] warning every time you hear the warning
[1:12:35] voice of your pastor I crossed this
[1:12:38] moment it tells you you're going to the
[1:12:40] judgment I can told my dad last time I
[1:12:42] seen him after his birthday he said boy
[1:12:44] just look at that face reduce it well I
[1:12:46] wasn't really old it was great hair and
[1:12:47] I said dad it's just a reminder that
[1:12:49] you're going to meet Jesus
[1:12:51] that's right I said then you got to get
[1:12:55] back pray all these things like that all
[1:12:56] these things see a pastor preaching
[1:12:58] against it as a warning
[1:13:00] going to be judging one that and if he
[1:13:03] doesn't preach it there's something
[1:13:04] wrong with the pastor now we all know
[1:13:07] that Lord is coming word and talk about
[1:13:09] gifts if a proxy would say the Lord is
[1:13:11] coming they'll see them he said we all
[1:13:13] know that behold the Lord is coming that
[1:13:16] would be all right but he's saying that
[1:13:17] the pastor at the platform he's got the
[1:13:20] word for that so when I think a pastor
[1:13:22] can tell you the Lord is coming
[1:13:23] we don't need tongues interpretation to
[1:13:24] tell you the Lord's coming the pastor
[1:13:26] can tell you Dax is in the Bible
[1:13:28] he's an immediate pastor a prophet of
[1:13:30] the church or pastor rather a pastors to
[1:13:33] study the word of the Lord and tell you
[1:13:35] what's written the word the Lord about
[1:13:37] the coming the Lord and you're worn by
[1:13:39] that I'm so glad my job is just to read
[1:13:42] the Bible and tell you what the Bible
[1:13:44] says that's mighty if that's why that's
[1:13:47] my column arrestor that's my job to tell
[1:13:50] you what's in the Bible the gifts of
[1:13:51] tongues interpretation of prophecy there
[1:13:53] to tell you what's not in the Bible
[1:13:55] they're supposed to discern the
[1:13:57] situation that's cause for your algebra
[1:13:58] we know that and in this message if you
[1:14:01] have to listen that you'd like it is
[1:14:03] from December 26 well Graham said for
[1:14:05] something like this where's your brother
[1:14:07] devil be the pastor should he leave the
[1:14:08] tabernacle in Jeffersonville go to Fort
[1:14:10] Wayne Indiana there's no scripture in
[1:14:12] the Bible that says auermann devil
[1:14:14] should go to whatever but that's why we
[1:14:17] need the gifts of God so when you come
[1:14:18] across the situation you're a decision
[1:14:20] you're not open shrug that's what we
[1:14:22] need the gifts of God and so I hope this
[1:14:24] makes us hunger so we'll pray for more
[1:14:26] gifts of God right that's why we put up
[1:14:29] that that's what we're talking we're
[1:14:31] talking right now what is the works of
[1:14:35] God I noticed this before the end of
[1:14:37] time what was it before the fire was fun
[1:14:40] they had message after message warning
[1:14:42] after warning by lot preaching and
[1:14:44] that's the pastor lot now I don't want
[1:14:47] to be lot but my madam says that that
[1:14:50] was a pastor I would be Abraham with his
[1:14:52] group bed but look lot was the pastor
[1:14:55] there inside of morning that God had a
[1:14:57] pastor warning them portabella ready
[1:15:00] brother and so they turned it down they
[1:15:02] turned it like idle tales the same as
[1:15:04] they do the pastor today
[1:15:05] Oh pastors just taught us he just saw
[1:15:07] Fiza ignoramus he's just a fire and
[1:15:10] brimstone preacher ah he's off his
[1:15:12] rocker
[1:15:13] he's his old-fashioned
[1:15:14] but the Bible said we must warn that
[1:15:16] fires coming Jackie right okay I said
[1:15:21] sometimes your pastor has to wait down
[1:15:23] something that means to kind of cut you
[1:15:26] up on something just love him that much
[1:15:29] more because he's a real spiritual
[1:15:31] father demon trying to keep you up lined
[1:15:35] up because he's watching over your soul
[1:15:38] which the Holy Ghost has made in the
[1:15:40] overseer of the church
[1:15:42] you got your Bibles turn to Hebrews 13
[1:15:45] real quick
[1:15:47] and I know most I know these are enough
[1:15:49] they're probably new clothes but they
[1:15:51] don't contain anything you didn't
[1:15:53] already understand already I'm just
[1:15:54] reminding the church okay
[1:15:56] I'm just reminding the church because
[1:15:58] when I see things I've got a lord of the
[1:15:59] church and I go to I email people I text
[1:16:02] people on call people give them warnings
[1:16:04] why because I'm called to do it if I
[1:16:08] don't warn them the Bloods on my hands
[1:16:10] praise God
[1:16:11] I'm I'll be responsible to the end of
[1:16:13] judgment because I didn't warn them
[1:16:14] about sins they're getting into or
[1:16:15] whatever more that we understand that
[1:16:18] Hebrews 13 I'm going to Hebrews 13:7
[1:16:21] because you should have 30 verse 13
[1:16:23] eight memorized right eager to see that
[1:16:27] at least you ought to I know I never get
[1:16:31] out of the altar afraid all right here
[1:16:33] is 30 n-- 7 so this is actually the
[1:16:36] context that paul's writing remember
[1:16:39] them which have the rule over you who
[1:16:40] rose over you who have spoken unto you
[1:16:43] the word of the Lord whose faith follow
[1:16:47] considering the end of their
[1:16:48] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[1:16:50] yesterday in other words Jesus Christ
[1:16:52] has always had a leader to preach the
[1:16:55] word the people and then you follow that
[1:16:56] leader amen he's the same yesterday
[1:16:58] today and forever now go down to verse
[1:17:01] 17 he's all done with remember inviting
[1:17:06] the church follow your leaders if I'm
[1:17:08] not a leader then write me up you know
[1:17:10] just tell me say brother Jesse I just
[1:17:12] hope me on let the follow you I want to
[1:17:14] go somewhere else I'll say praise the
[1:17:15] Lord but I don't got place in here for a
[1:17:18] reason Amen I couldn't get away from her
[1:17:20] that's how my man said you know it's a
[1:17:21] little God when you're just praying
[1:17:22] you're neutral you don't want anybody
[1:17:24] swell but dots and you just have to
[1:17:26] Russell you don't want to do it but you
[1:17:27] have to surrender and you guys got with
[1:17:29] it on your high amen
[1:17:30] and you can't read it you can't get away
[1:17:32] from it you know it's God's will amen
[1:17:34] I've seen God answered my prayers and
[1:17:36] indicate that I know it's true
[1:17:38] obey them that have the rule over you
[1:17:39] who says it twice and submit that means
[1:17:42] obey submit yourselves for they watch
[1:17:45] for your what soul I'm watching over
[1:17:49] your soul not so much your physical or
[1:17:51] your speech although we appreciate that
[1:17:52] right I'm supposed to help you if you
[1:17:54] have needs I hope you buy the engine
[1:17:55] this let me know if the loser doesn't
[1:17:57] tell me let me know if you have any
[1:17:59] needs and your mind your your spiritual
[1:18:02] eye to help that to the preaching but my
[1:18:03] main concern is your soul is their faith
[1:18:06] or unbelief in that salt and I got to
[1:18:09] watch over that's my duty I'm watching
[1:18:11] okay I just told us now for they watch
[1:18:15] for your souls as they that must give
[1:18:17] account I've got an answer to God and
[1:18:21] God is going to say Jesse Smith you're
[1:18:22] the pastor of the bronchi fellowship
[1:18:24] give an account of your congregation
[1:18:25] what am I going to say well I'm going to
[1:18:28] answer for this family I have to that
[1:18:30] family what am I going to say
[1:18:31] I've got to give an account did I warn
[1:18:34] them or not did I tell the truth or not
[1:18:36] or did not just tried to hurt their
[1:18:38] feelings I don't want to care about
[1:18:39] feelings I want to hear about God praise
[1:18:42] the Lord
[1:18:43] I wouldn't love the people who didn't
[1:18:44] tell the truth it's a perverted love to
[1:18:47] keep the word of warning away from the
[1:18:50] people look at the Bible says that they
[1:18:53] may do it with joy and not with grief
[1:18:55] for that is unprofitable for you imagine
[1:18:57] I got an answer on churches I know it
[1:18:59] seems funny but one day this word is
[1:19:03] true I understand before Christ and with
[1:19:05] all of you and I've got to answer for
[1:19:06] you every person here right I think
[1:19:09] either doing joy or with greed if I'm a
[1:19:11] faithful past man to understand that
[1:19:13] that's what he says I have a watch over
[1:19:16] your salt the Holy Ghost made me a
[1:19:19] watcher over your soul I didn't go a
[1:19:21] little bit for this message Christ came
[1:19:23] looking for me I didn't know where there
[1:19:24] was an acrid Christ set meet after God
[1:19:26] save me attackers are to church attacker
[1:19:28] why so watch over the souls attack
[1:19:31] watch over God chief it happened that's
[1:19:32] why I got sent in here if it's my choice
[1:19:36] God knows this there's my choice I'd be
[1:19:38] a home with my family because I miss my
[1:19:39] family but as I told you before I love
[1:19:41] you more that's why I'm here with you I
[1:19:44] love my family but that's just flesh and
[1:19:46] blood and water blood and you know DNA
[1:19:49] but who have enough more awesomer than
[1:19:51] the salt I love you amen
[1:19:54] because I don't lead you go to my family
[1:19:56] who I stay with the ones that I love
[1:19:58] amen but in my natural flesh if he eats
[1:20:01] you're gone
[1:20:01] is that me no more babysitter slots our
[1:20:04] kids you know why I could have more
[1:20:05] quiet time when my wife is sick she
[1:20:07] could go to bed and her mom or my mom
[1:20:09] come over watch the kids you don't have
[1:20:10] that here we got to suffer a little dose
[1:20:13] a little bit this a much suffering but
[1:20:15] it's a little bit of suffering at the
[1:20:16] door because we're far from our family
[1:20:18] but you know what God called me don't
[1:20:21] watch over souls you amen you like that
[1:20:24] you appreciate that by God's grace amen
[1:20:26] I hope that makes sense it's appreciate
[1:20:27] the word you appreciate that some talk
[1:20:29] about appreciate the word now if you're
[1:20:32] following the gospel my mom said as your
[1:20:33] pastor I would like a little later on
[1:20:35] with your spirits and just begin to come
[1:20:37] to a burping something against the
[1:20:38] spirit he said listen he goes down to
[1:20:41] would you have to correct people if
[1:20:43] somebody gets out of order and the
[1:20:45] pastor has to call it down which is a
[1:20:47] gift that's outside the word and that
[1:20:50] spirit flies up and fight to get to the
[1:20:52] pastor and that's not the Spirit of God
[1:20:54] the spirit of God always stands comes to
[1:20:57] the words he recognized the word every
[1:20:58] time so if somebody if I try to crack
[1:21:00] somebody on a gift or listen any other
[1:21:03] sin if I try to correct somebody on
[1:21:04] customs I try to correct somebody on and
[1:21:06] drinking I try to correct somebody on
[1:21:08] smoking or anything else and they fly up
[1:21:10] at me it shows the spirit of God's not
[1:21:13] behind that but somebody that will
[1:21:15] repent and say yes I'm wrong I broken
[1:21:17] the word then the Spirit of God is
[1:21:18] behind then everybody see that
[1:21:20] that's what for the Rams head then again
[1:21:22] you all say we believe the message so
[1:21:24] let's believe it I'm not you can look it
[1:21:26] up I'm not making this up it's on date
[1:21:28] but we need today is some blushing
[1:21:30] promise I'm going skip down what we need
[1:21:32] today is a household cleaning in a
[1:21:34] heartwarming a prophet of God who will
[1:21:36] stand in the pulpit and call the thing
[1:21:38] out and tell what's right and wrong and
[1:21:40] preach the gospel without
[1:21:42] rising until sinners faltered floor and
[1:21:44] meat to God sends the Holy Spirit to
[1:21:47] clean up their lives uh you know that's
[1:21:50] right even now I'm close with this I
[1:21:52] pulled up in a closed church outreach
[1:21:55] less than an hour you like that I think
[1:21:57] arguably but I also gotta watch out
[1:22:00] because I'm guarding my voice is
[1:22:01] straining the market did you know the
[1:22:04] Bible said the pastors influence here
[1:22:07] save or lose the souls of the
[1:22:10] congregation you know about tonight
[1:22:12] now remember everybody's responsible for
[1:22:14] themselves right but if someone is so
[1:22:20] irresponsible that they followed
[1:22:22] irresponsible Watchmen then they're just
[1:22:24] as guilty for letting him stay there we
[1:22:27] understand that every congregation
[1:22:29] prevention is responsible to tell the
[1:22:32] pastor if he makes a mistake
[1:22:33] everyone here is responding we're
[1:22:35] live-streaming is responsible to
[1:22:37] correcting night anybody correct me for
[1:22:39] a while now a few things come up a few
[1:22:41] people correct me on and I appreciate
[1:22:43] that or maybe some things they desire I
[1:22:44] appreciate that but that tells me either
[1:22:47] I'm preaching everything right by the
[1:22:49] Holy Spirit or the people are scared to
[1:22:51] come and correct me I hope it's the
[1:22:55] first hope inside prayed it out from the
[1:22:57] pen fasten it up and study them out
[1:22:59] where I just let the Holy Spirit preach
[1:23:01] and it's not me but if I have to be some
[1:23:04] wrong your answer your duty bound to God
[1:23:07] to come tell me about so I haven't had
[1:23:11] many people contact me so thank the Lord
[1:23:12] for that as far as I know I believe on
[1:23:14] preaching the truth because I'm letting
[1:23:15] the Holy Spirit reach that's just my
[1:23:18] opinion now here's the scripture that
[1:23:19] says it hopes re first Timothy four till
[1:23:22] I economies talking to Timothy the
[1:23:23] pastor you have attendance to reading
[1:23:25] saying I've always got really preachers
[1:23:27] always got an X or it means step step up
[1:23:29] and talk to people and a doctor this is
[1:23:32] a doctrine of water back to the doctor
[1:23:33] holiness the doctrine of predestination
[1:23:35] give your attention to that neglect not
[1:23:38] the gift that's in thee
[1:23:39] see if you got to get the preach you got
[1:23:42] to study all the time I'm gonna stand
[1:23:44] that you got to give the speakin tongue
[1:23:45] very lot right you got to get former
[1:23:49] ghosts you got a fast lot because some
[1:23:51] of these only go out by prayer and best
[1:23:53] it
[1:23:54] do that whatever your ministry is you
[1:23:57] have to invest in it you can't neglect
[1:23:58] your gift if you haven't give which was
[1:24:03] giving me about cropsy with the laying
[1:24:05] on of the hands of the presbytery
[1:24:06] meditate upon these things you just
[1:24:08] always think about Mike your gift to
[1:24:09] what God's called you meditate upon that
[1:24:11] give yourself wholly to them nobody
[1:24:13] anything pull you away from it that I
[1:24:16] promptly may appear to all see so if you
[1:24:20] invest in your gift and you give
[1:24:22] yourself wholly to your gift people are
[1:24:23] going to notice why Lord is really using
[1:24:25] that sister Lord is really using that
[1:24:28] brother because they are investing in
[1:24:30] their gift they don't neglect it they
[1:24:32] invest everyone invest in one guy hey
[1:24:34] man I got to play something at every
[1:24:36] lecture if I was said a gift of God has
[1:24:38] given to every man to profit withal
[1:24:41] brother Graham says that that's the
[1:24:43] description everybody has a gift you
[1:24:45] kind of see God for meditate upon it
[1:24:47] don't neglect it say God show me about
[1:24:49] get that look I love my boys the
[1:24:51] description take heed unto thyself and
[1:24:54] unto the doctrine continue in then for
[1:24:58] doing this thou shalt both save yourself
[1:25:01] and then the here be glory see why I got
[1:25:06] to study predestination see my god study
[1:25:07] holiness and all these things and so
[1:25:09] that I'm saved and you're saved amen
[1:25:12] because it's the Holy Spirit's way to
[1:25:15] speak to the congregation always
[1:25:16] spiritual watch for the real watchman he
[1:25:18] sets me and joins me to be a spiritual
[1:25:20] watchman and I deliver his word to you
[1:25:22] and it saves both of us hey Dad
[1:25:24] I know you gonna say both of us here's
[1:25:29] how it can lose everybody jesus said
[1:25:33] what would you lawyers if you've taken
[1:25:34] away the key of knowledge which
[1:25:36] knowledge is understanding of the word
[1:25:38] you enter not in yourselves to the
[1:25:40] salvation and then that we're entering
[1:25:42] in you hindered so see they stop people
[1:25:46] from entering into the things of God
[1:25:48] salvation is for salvation Jesus a
[1:25:50] salvation
[1:25:51] now look 10 a second hit me Harvey
[1:25:54] second Timothy says a preaches last year
[1:25:56] but some shun profane and vain babblings
[1:25:58] for they will increase unto more
[1:26:00] ungodliness and their word will eat as
[1:26:04] a canker of whom is I'm Aeneas and
[1:26:07] philetus who concerning the truth and
[1:26:09] air saying that the resurrection is
[1:26:11] passed already and overthrow the faith
[1:26:14] of something overthrow the pain so jesus
[1:26:16] said will I find luck
[1:26:17] faith on the earth but a boss a boss
[1:26:20] preacher will overthrow your faith and
[1:26:23] you'll be lost
[1:26:26] I'm closing with the just a few more
[1:26:28] take you remember this man said a woman
[1:26:31] was hallucinating well I'm sorry not
[1:26:33] loosing she was actually seeing the
[1:26:34] demons on her deathbed and she blamed
[1:26:36] the pastor for going to help because the
[1:26:41] pastor didn't are the truth he wasn't a
[1:26:42] real watchman here's the story some time
[1:26:45] ago in this very city Jefferson's
[1:26:47] Jeffersonville yeah there was a young
[1:26:49] girl belong to certain Church in the
[1:26:50] city she thought she was alright her
[1:26:52] pastor told her she was re she made fun
[1:26:54] of a little girl to come to church
[1:26:55] because she wouldn't go to a show a
[1:26:56] movie look at this all she was in was
[1:26:59] going to movies and she went to hell and
[1:27:02] she said your pastor is narrow-minded
[1:27:04] now the little girl said that's alright
[1:27:06] remember I told you when I purchased in
[1:27:08] that other church there earlier this
[1:27:10] year
[1:27:10] no is it late last year I preached that
[1:27:14] most people that go to movies will
[1:27:15] probably go to hell and I got the Bible
[1:27:19] for that second Peter says that lot was
[1:27:22] righteous and the things that he saw
[1:27:24] tormented him daily so lot was saved and
[1:27:28] the things he saw tormented and yet he
[1:27:31] was saved because the sin tormented him
[1:27:33] well how you gonna walk into movie it
[1:27:35] doesn't torment you and say you're safe
[1:27:37] you're not because you're so calloused
[1:27:40] to hell and then sit and everything like
[1:27:42] that you love it you're not going to be
[1:27:44] saved and I got the Bible right there
[1:27:46] when Locke saw evil things it hurt him
[1:27:49] and these people that go to church go to
[1:27:51] church and they love this galaxy or
[1:27:55] Wolverine or whatever they got yeah I'm
[1:27:56] trying to get the move summer movies
[1:27:58] it's not sent fill themselves with
[1:28:00] Superman and Batman in spider-man when
[1:28:02] Christ is the only Superman and they
[1:28:05] they hate his spirit but they love these
[1:28:07] evil demon powers how they make it to
[1:28:10] heaven with a lot barely been to heaven
[1:28:12] and that thing that kind of thing he
[1:28:14] hated it and these people go to movies
[1:28:16] and love it they won't make it to heaven
[1:28:17] they're blind and they're the they're
[1:28:20] the blind that fall into the ditch and
[1:28:21] the blind lead the blind Jesus that

[1:33:40] went after them I trying to share the
[1:33:42] world with them try to bring correction
[1:33:44] trying to warn them then what's God
[1:33:45] going to say God's good either to tell
[1:33:48] the truth if I did that and I think Levi
[1:33:50] did by God's grace
[1:33:52] see that see how we're in a season right
[1:33:54] now I returns in the season you see how
[1:33:56] I try to look by the Holy Spirit every
[1:33:58] see that I tried led by the Holy Spirit
[1:33:59] see what's going on I was taking attack
[1:34:01] of the church we're just so on fire one
[1:34:03] year ago brother and I were talking
[1:34:04] about
[1:34:05] we're so environment I get we're pulling
[1:34:07] and let the ear later that would be your
[1:34:08] later brother may look very stick
[1:34:10] Satan has come in here what you trying
[1:34:14] to hold people out you try to track them
[1:34:16] with shiny things track them with other
[1:34:18] things pull them out but like I said
[1:34:19] doctor differences that's okay even as
[1:34:21] long as you stay in church go to a
[1:34:24] faithful other
[1:34:25] flock that has a good watch you know I'm
[1:34:28] just trying to be faith in myself by
[1:34:29] God's grace you see I'm trying to see
[1:34:32] the spiritual state once the spirits say
[1:34:33] to the church I've got to call these
[1:34:36] things out okay first Thessalonians and
[1:34:42] church I know we know some of these
[1:34:44] things but as a watchman I got to say it
[1:34:46] I got to say it and if you love the Lord
[1:34:50] that you
[1:34:51] the Word of God that's for sure first
[1:34:55] Thessalonians five I had 14 actually
[1:35:06] let's read verse 12 this deals with
[1:35:08] preachers and we beseech you brother to
[1:35:11] know that which labor among you and are
[1:35:12] over you in the Lord and admonish number

[1:35:53] can do two T's he said don't let the
[1:35:54] pastor do all the warding off to get
