[2:21] Lord tonight thank God for another time
[2:24] to be together praise God let's start
[2:26] with prayer again by the grace of the
[2:28] Lord and of a testimony here for my wife
[2:34] my wife says we want to thank the Lord
[2:36] for his protection we found out our
[2:38] house had some very bad and dangerous
[2:40] wiring all throughout the basement but
[2:43] we never had any problems thank God for
[2:46] caring for us Amen so we can thank the
[2:48] Lord for that praise the Lord
[2:51] the electrician sent me some pictures
[2:53] and a lot of the wires that were frayed
[2:55] and everything was pretty awful but
[2:57] never had any fires so we're grateful
[2:59] for God's protection and I told though
[3:04] that's why I told the electrician I said
[3:06] the angels of God are camped about them
[3:08] that fear the Lord I said the angels are
[3:10] with us in the fire so we're grateful
[3:13] for God's grace also just an update on

[40:52] so let's maokai can switch over when
[40:55] you're ready buddy let's finish up the
[40:57] church ages here tonight
[41:00] I'm really happy to
[41:03] almost finished by the grace Lord is
[41:05] really encouraging on Monday we had the
[41:07] day off from school cuz I did my work
[41:08] early made a profession of Elvan days I
[41:10] got to come to the church and finish
[41:11] reading the whole book I realize I'm
[41:15] down to about one or two sermons so
[41:16] we're grateful for that and happy to
[41:18] preach what God commissioned our prophet
[41:20] to preach amen
[41:21] so part 11 this is of the Laodicean
[41:24] Church age parts part 58 rather of the
[41:26] entire series so I want to look at the
[41:30] consummation of the Gentile ages tonight
[41:34] and I want to eventually get to Azusa
[41:37] Street I want to look at what happened
[41:39] at a zoo zoo Street to show you that God
[41:41] is gonna make us ready for the rapture
[41:43] we are gonna have a great idea we're
[41:46] gonna have a great leading when we when
[41:48] the rapture takes place we will have
[41:50] where the bride will have a strong
[41:53] knowledge that the rapture is soon to
[41:55] happen I know a lot of people are saying
[41:57] it now especially to people that I've
[41:58] got a couple emails this weekend and
[42:00] texts from different people saying oh
[42:03] the rapture Californians gonna sink soon
[42:05] and all these things but but really I
[42:06] think they're all predictions you know
[42:08] and I'll explain why in a little bit but
[42:10] let's just go through this here the
[42:12] consummation now I I preached on this a
[42:15] couple weeks ago but I'm just gonna go
[42:16] over this again quickly because this is
[42:19] the last two sections of the the church
[42:21] age book chapter on Laodicea this age is
[42:25] the last of the seven Church ages what
[42:27] began the first or Ephesian age must and
[42:29] will come to full fruition and harvest
[42:32] in the last or Laodicean age the two
[42:36] vines will yield their final fruit the
[42:39] two spirits will terminate their
[42:41] manifestation in each of their final
[42:43] destinations the sowing the watering the
[42:46] growing is all over summer's end of the
[42:49] sickle is now thrust in the harvest so
[42:51] brother Branham ends this chapter by
[42:54] saying everything at the end time is
[42:57] going to be the final final expression
[42:59] of whatever spirits behind us so if
[43:02] we're the wise virgin we're gonna
[43:04] express the final manifestation at the
[43:07] wise virgin will manifest
[43:09] whoever's foolish virgin they will
[43:11] manifest the final the mature foolish
[43:15] virgin right
[43:16] whoever is the false church the Judas
[43:19] the tares they will manifest the the
[43:21] full fruit of a tear it's coming down to
[43:24] the very ending of it and so we went
[43:28] through this a couple weeks back but the
[43:31] Prophet said in verses 15 to 18 in
[43:34] chapter 3 we have the true picture of
[43:37] the ripened false vine the false church
[43:40] the false spirit as well and this was
[43:44] the the true picture of a mature tear so
[43:50] now we know what a true tear their
[43:52] spiritual life is gonna look like this
[43:54] it's gonna look like a life that has
[43:57] works that are neither hot nor cold they
[44:00] can't they can't they can't just be hot
[44:01] all the time but they're not just cold
[44:03] all the time
[44:04] they're lukewarm he said because you're
[44:07] lukewarm neither hot nor cold I spew
[44:10] thee out of my mouth
[44:10] so in tear churches around terror
[44:13] individuals they'll not be speaking for
[44:15] God anymore they won't have the
[44:17] authority of the word they'll be saying
[44:20] some things that of course come out of
[44:22] the word because it's they have to be
[44:23] deceptive you don't have to have some
[44:25] some something that resembles the word
[44:28] but they're not going to be speaking for
[44:31] God anymore so the Holy Spirit will not
[44:34] be speaking through the tears of course
[44:37] they won't be speaking at all with the
[44:39] word for this hour now here is the the
[44:43] most striking thing this is what we've
[44:45] got to watch out I think this is a this
[44:46] is the easiest way for us to know where
[44:51] we are with God if the words that are
[44:53] coming out of our mouths and the action
[44:55] of our lives if they're saying I don't
[44:58] have need of more of God I've got all
[45:00] that I need I've got the money I need
[45:02] I've got the goods all everything at my
[45:04] home I've got everything I need at my
[45:06] house and I don't really have no more
[45:08] need of God anymore I don't
[45:10] and this also implies the works I I
[45:13] don't have to do anything more for God
[45:15] remember how brother Branham was always
[45:17] saying I want to do more for God you
[45:19] know the the false church doesn't have
[45:22] that they feel like they've done enough
[45:24] for God they're happy with what they've
[45:26] done for God but a real broad number
[45:28] once they keep doing more for God
[45:30] their works should be continually
[45:33] growing and abounding and and
[45:35] manifesting they should have a need to
[45:39] do more for God so their very life is
[45:43] gonna be saying I've arrived
[45:45] III know what I am I don't need to to
[45:49] draw closer to God but Jesus says your
[45:52] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[45:55] this is a mature tear someone that's
[46:00] really come to maturity as a tear
[46:03] I'm lukewarm sometimes I'm hot sometimes
[46:05] I'm cold
[46:06] all right I'm right in the middle I just
[46:08] can't go to one side or the other and I
[46:11] don't have more need of God and that's
[46:13] where we've got to watch our lives
[46:15] because the Prophet said there's no more
[46:18] bitter rebuke for a more proud or
[46:23] arrogant religious people so that's the
[46:25] biggest rebuke you could ever receive is
[46:27] that your poor wretched miserable blind
[46:30] and naked and don't know in other words
[46:32] you don't know the condition that's your
[46:34] and that's the worst rebuke you could
[46:37] possibly have so Church it behooves us
[46:41] to come to church and really ask God
[46:43] Lord what condition am I am show me my
[46:47] true condition praise the Lord I know
[46:49] that simple but that if we can have that
[46:52] and know where we truly stand with God
[46:54] then we can be sure we're not a tear
[46:56] because the tear doesn't know they can't
[47:00] eat they can't even see their true
[47:02] condition they think they're right with
[47:03] God but Jesus says you don't even know
[47:06] all these things so we need to know what
[47:09] condition were in and we can note by
[47:10] looking at the word so in the same in
[47:15] the same text we hear the most bitter
[47:18] rebuke but also the most highest
[47:22] compliment ever paid to a humble
[47:25] steadfast group this is the compliment
[47:28] because you've overcome later to see a
[47:31] as I overcame which is quoting the word
[47:35] you'll sit down with me in my Father's
[47:38] throne in other words the Millennium
[47:41] you'll sit with me in the Millennium and
[47:43] of Cour
[47:43] - future home there's so along with the
[47:47] worst bitter rebuke right alongside that
[47:50] to the age you have the highest
[47:52] compliment ever paid to a spiritual
[47:54] people Amen oh my so you have the law of
[47:58] contrasts right just like day and night
[48:00] right
[48:01] hot and cold you have these same things
[48:03] and it's a beautiful picture to see now
[48:07] brother branham brings us back to this
[48:09] harvest thought so he gives us two
[48:11] scriptures he gives us Matthew 3:11 and
[48:13] 12 where John the Baptist is talking
[48:16] about Jesus coming to baptize with the
[48:17] Holy Ghost whose fan is in his hand and
[48:21] he will thoroughly purge his floor and
[48:23] gather his wheat into the garner but he
[48:26] will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
[48:28] fire so this is now Christ in his true
[48:33] relationship to the true church and the
[48:36] false church and Jesus is ready to burn
[48:40] the tares but he's ready to harvest the
[48:42] wheat off the earth amen
[48:44] this is the harvest this is the final
[48:46] fruit at the end of the age
[48:49] well Aram said Christ the heart great
[48:51] harvesters now reaping the fruit of the
[48:53] earth he gathers the wheat into the
[48:55] garner by coming for his own and
[48:57] receiving them for ever unto himself
[48:59] then he returns to destroy the wicked
[49:01] with unquenchable fire also he gives us
[49:05] another scripture about the harvest time
[49:08] he said the mystery of the tares in of
[49:11] wheat of Matthew 13:24 2:30 is now
[49:14] fulfilled and I'm not gonna read that
[49:16] because we've we know that we're pretty
[49:18] familiar with that the wheat and tares
[49:20] which from the first age until now I've
[49:22] grown side by side are harvested what
[49:25] Nicaea set out to accomplish has finally
[49:28] come to pass with all the might of
[49:30] organization now here look at this at
[49:32] the end this is important the false
[49:34] church turns from any vestige of truth
[49:38] and with political might reinforces
[49:41] herself with state backing and sets out
[49:44] to eradicate forever the true believer
[49:46] so right before the rapture the false
[49:50] church will turn from all truth and now
[49:52] they have a hateful murder
[49:54] this Esau spirit and Ishmael murderous
[49:58] mocking spirit right at the end up until
[50:01] then they're going to look pretty close
[50:02] it's going to be so close to deceive the
[50:04] very elect but right at the end time
[50:06] they're going to turn from all their
[50:09] truth and they're going to be murderers
[50:11] right before the end and just when she's
[50:15] about to accomplish her cowardly plot
[50:17] the wheat is gathered into the garner
[50:19] amen
[50:20] no longer will the wheat and tares grow
[50:22] side by side no longer will the tares
[50:24] receive of the blessing of God because
[50:26] the friends of the wheat for the wheat
[50:28] will be gone and the wrath of God will
[50:29] be poured out in the sixth seal which
[50:31] will end in the utter destruction of the
[50:33] wicked now I said a moment ago that the
[50:39] false vine came into full fruition in
[50:41] this age her fruit would mature and
[50:43] ripen that's correct
[50:44] this evil spirited church full of
[50:47] iniquity will be revealed as the mustard
[50:50] seed that grew into a tree wherein
[50:53] lodged the fowls of the air at her head
[50:55] will be the Antichrist and Mister of
[50:57] iniquity all this is true so I want to
[51:00] revisit this remember the parable jesus
[51:02] said he said the kingdom of heaven is
[51:04] likened a grain of mustard seed now some
[51:06] people think that's faith but the
[51:08] Prophet tells us that's actually not it
[51:10] actually represents the false church
[51:12] which a man took and sowed in his field
[51:14] which indeed is the least of all seeds
[51:17] but when it's grown it is the greatest
[51:19] among herbs and becometh a tree so that
[51:23] the birds of the air come and lodge in
[51:25] the branches thereof so the Prophet
[51:28] tells us this is not the true church
[51:32] this is actually the false church and so
[51:36] notice all of the seeds brought forth
[51:39] the greatest herb a full I'm sorry the
[51:41] least of all the seeds brought forth the
[51:43] greatest herb a full tree it's so large
[51:48] that birds come and Lodge there which
[51:49] reminds us of the little lying Tonka
[51:52] knows a great fire
[51:53] the littlest produces the greatest so
[51:56] see the littlest sin produces the
[51:58] greatest result the greatest destruction
[52:00] so we see that same idea the smallest
[52:03] mustard seed produces a great tree with
[52:05] all the birds the
[52:07] Ollis lie in Ephesus produces the
[52:10] Antichrist
[52:11] Jezebel system at the end and notice
[52:15] birds plural always mention eat always
[52:19] represent evil spirits in the Bible
[52:22] because when Abraham Abraham had to push
[52:25] the birds off of his sacrifice and
[52:26] mother BAM said those Abraham casting
[52:28] off demons so that's in Abraham in
[52:33] Genesis 15 revelation 18 the Roman
[52:36] Catholic Church was full of a cage of
[52:38] unclean and hateful bird so birds many
[52:42] birds always represents many demons but
[52:46] one bird the Dove always represents the
[52:49] holy ghost
[52:50] so hope that's clear that might be
[52:52] strange to some people I know it was
[52:54] strange when I first read it but as you
[52:56] study the scripture it's right so this
[53:01] this false church must come to maturity
[53:03] and they'll produce their final fruit
[53:06] now if this is true then it must be also
[53:10] true that the bride church will mature
[53:11] and her ripeness shall be an
[53:14] identification with her Lord by means of
[53:17] the word and her head who will come to
[53:20] her is the mystery of godliness which
[53:23] indeed is Christ and as the false church
[53:27] with all cunning and diabolical power
[53:29] made up a political force physical force
[53:32] and demons of Darkness come against the
[53:36] true vine the true vine with the
[53:38] fullness of the Spirit and the word will
[53:42] do the very acts of power that Jesus did
[53:45] so just as they're getting full
[53:47] political and satanic power will be
[53:50] getting full Holy Ghost power amen
[53:53] because they're coming to maturity
[53:54] they're coming to the end their final
[53:57] manifestation they're coming to their
[53:59] maturity so the we can expect if our
[54:03] lives are true with the baptism of the
[54:05] Holy Ghost will have more spirit and
[54:08] more word whereas the false church will
[54:12] have less word and more deception then
[54:17] as she knew
[54:17] their headstone becoming like him
[54:19] through the word Jesus will come that
[54:21] the bride and groom made forever be
[54:23] united as one hallelujah
[54:26] already the visible manifestations of
[54:28] what I've been telling you are seen all
[54:30] around us the ecumenical move the tears
[54:33] is factual and I just saw it again I saw
[54:36] a video this week of a man who is
[54:39] friends with Kenneth Copeland that's the
[54:40] one I forgot a few weeks ago who's very
[54:43] popular now I forget his name anyways
[54:46] he's praying it in the service and he's
[54:48] praying that the the ecumenical move
[54:51] will unite and he's saying he's praying
[54:53] for the spirit of tongues to pour out
[54:56] upon the Catholics and everybody goes to
[54:58] crying and shouting and speaking in
[55:00] tongues and and and I said that's
[55:03] exactly the ecumenical move we're
[55:05] talking about don't get me wrong church
[55:07] sometimes when I'm here praying I'm
[55:09] praying that God will save people on the
[55:11] Catholic Church I'm sighing and crying
[55:14] for the abomination than the city but
[55:16] I'm not praying for them to speak in
[55:18] tongues and join our organization I'm
[55:19] praying for them to come out of
[55:21] organization but they're saying let
[55:23] tongues come to the kind of church
[55:25] that's not what they need they need a
[55:27] tongue of saying I'm wrong I repent
[55:30] I'm Salus to repent that's the tongue
[55:32] they need amen I'm wrong and I've got to
[55:35] come out of organization and I've got to
[55:37] come into Christ the word amen so it's
[55:40] closed that's why it's so close it would
[55:42] deceive the very elect afore possible
[55:44] they're crying and and they want they
[55:46] want tongues that go so in other words
[55:48] in other words they want to proselyte
[55:50] does every understand what I'm saying
[55:52] they want to preside they want their
[55:54] Creed to go to the Catholic Church we
[55:56] want them to leave their Creed and come
[55:59] to Christ that's the great difference
[56:02] and notice both groups have all kinds of
[56:05] money so it's a it's always said watch
[56:07] it's always centered around money and
[56:09] politics and power watch money and power
[56:12] it's factual but it's also a fact that
[56:16] the profit from the last age must be
[56:19] bringing forth a message from God that
[56:21] will forerun the second coming of Lord
[56:23] for by his message will the hearts of
[56:26] the children be turned back to the
[56:28] Pentecostal fathers
[56:31] and with the restoration the word will
[56:33] come the restoration of power Amen
[56:36] that's what I believe is happening today
[56:39] by the grace of the Lord but I believe
[56:44] like brother Bram said I believe we're
[56:45] going to need a little more persecution
[56:46] to bring forth all the power because our
[56:49] lives are just too comfortable you and I
[56:51] know we know when we get down and
[56:53] desperate with God and we get sincere
[56:54] and alls we do is meditate upon God we
[56:57] know super supernatural things happen
[56:59] but often the way we battle here and
[57:02] Laodicea it almost takes like rubber and
[57:04] preach it almost takes desperation to
[57:07] bring out the supernatural our lives but
[57:10] see we got it we got to be patient we
[57:11] got to work with God we got to let God
[57:13] work with us we got to be humble we got
[57:14] to stay as close to God as we possibly
[57:16] can we know that now I'm gonna get now
[57:20] any closer to where I want to go pretty
[57:22] soon you know like I said I'll try to
[57:24] watch my time here
[57:27] what crucial times are these which we
[57:31] live in how careful we must be to remain
[57:34] true to this word and not take from it
[57:36] or add to it for he who would speak
[57:38] where God has not spoken makes him a
[57:40] liar what I have been particularly in
[57:45] mind is this about the turn of the
[57:47] century the hunger for God that was
[57:51] generated in the Philadelphia Age
[57:52] brought forth a cry for the Spirit of
[57:56] God if there's one thing I want the
[58:00] church to learn and myself is that we
[58:03] need to come and pray for more of the
[58:05] Holy Spirit that's really all that's
[58:10] really all we need to do it's come
[58:13] together and pray and believe God I
[58:15] believe prayer before service is the
[58:16] most when the most important things
[58:18] outside of praying at your home in other
[58:20] words I think the most important thing
[58:21] is praying for more of God I believe
[58:24] that with all my heart because the Bible
[58:27] says when you pray in the spirit it
[58:29] raises your faith so remember so now
[58:35] let's go
[58:36] back to Sousa this is where I want to go
[58:37] and I got a lot of details about azuz I
[58:38] was doing some I was watching a video
[58:42] about on Monday about the turn of the
[58:44] century the hunger for God that was
[58:45] generated in the Philadelphia Age
[58:47] brought forth the cry for the Spirit of
[58:50] God because remember that all kinds of
[58:51] teaching it isn't that seen what we got
[58:53] like now which is okay we got a lot of
[58:55] teaching but as we get the teaching the
[58:57] teaching should point us that we need
[58:59] power we need more power like I said
[59:02] with through desperation will help us
[59:03] cry out for power but I believe the same
[59:06] things gonna happen as we have teaching
[59:07] and more of the word more of the word it
[59:09] should point us to the fact that we need
[59:11] more supernatural and it will bring
[59:14] forth a cry for the Spirit of God and
[59:16] when the cry was answered by God sending
[59:19] forth manifestation and tongues
[59:21] interpretation and prophecy a group
[59:24] immediately in most contrary to the word
[59:26] drew up a doctor that tongues was the
[59:28] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[59:30] Ghost tongues were far from the evidence
[59:32] I want you to know this too when I went
[59:37] back and I I watch this video another
[59:40] the the what's it called it's this
[59:42] documentary that's the word I'm thinking
[59:43] I want to documentary on Azusa Street on
[59:46] Monday it was about an hour long and it
[59:48] had all the references so it looked
[59:50] really like it was a good a good video
[59:52] but a few things about that William
[59:56] Seymore the man who started the revival
[59:59] his doctrine was initial evidence I
[1:00:02] don't know if he knew that boo and we'll
[1:00:05] get to this in a little bit but he was
[1:00:07] actually from Houston Texas and one of
[1:00:10] the sisters from out what a woman passed
[1:00:12] her out in Los Angeles heard about his
[1:00:15] ministry she must have been traveling I
[1:00:17] forget the exact details but she sent a
[1:00:19] letter and said I feel that of the Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit to invite you to come preach at
[1:00:22] our church well he came he preached for
[1:00:25] a week and she found out he believed in
[1:00:28] tongues as Evans she kicked him out of
[1:00:29] the church so he got kicked out of the
[1:00:34] very church he was invited to preach at
[1:00:36] and he had no job now give you a little
[1:00:39] more background the churches in Los
[1:00:41] Angeles there was like 200 some churches
[1:00:42] they've been praying for three to four
[1:00:45] years history said for the move of the
[1:00:47] Holy Ghost
[1:00:49] what does that tell us it means that
[1:00:52] we've got to start praying for the move
[1:00:54] of the Holy Ghost in other words a
[1:00:56] supernatural revival thank God for what
[1:00:59] we thank God for the Holy Spirit that
[1:01:01] falls on us now
[1:01:02] thank God for that it keeps us from week
[1:01:04] to week but when we talk about revival
[1:01:06] it's like a full commitment of our lives
[1:01:08] everybody the church getting everything
[1:01:10] foolish out of their lives and just a
[1:01:12] delight in serving God that's what they
[1:01:16] were so in California they prayed for
[1:01:18] that for three or four years before
[1:01:19] Seymour came I want you to see that
[1:01:23] so this thought was already this false
[1:01:26] doctrine was already in Seymour's
[1:01:28] doctrine will say like that it was
[1:01:30] already in his bag you know his
[1:01:32] preaching bag or whatever you know but
[1:01:38] now when the Holy Ghost fell everything
[1:01:39] was by the word but then people after
[1:01:41] that denominated and so that's what
[1:01:43] brother I'm saying they sensed my this
[1:01:46] is the last age they felt the coming of
[1:01:48] Lord was nigh and so they started crying
[1:01:50] out for more of God and look God
[1:01:52] answered how many know that if you cry
[1:01:54] out God's gonna answer your prayer
[1:01:56] hallelujah but see we got a we got a
[1:01:59] labor though they labor that's really
[1:02:00] got to be our heart's desire to see the
[1:02:03] supernatural to see more of God we
[1:02:05] really got to pray for it we really got
[1:02:06] to believe it now
[1:02:09] I'm gonna jump ahead now this is from
[1:02:12] chapter 10 which I haven't preached yet
[1:02:14] it's called the resume but he again
[1:02:16] talks about Azusa Street now watch this
[1:02:18] this is what I said earlier this age
[1:02:20] started just before the turn of the
[1:02:21] twentieth century as it was to be the
[1:02:23] age in which the true church would
[1:02:25] return to being the bride she was at
[1:02:26] Pentecost we know that there must be of
[1:02:29] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[1:02:32] and in their testimony when that Holy
[1:02:35] Ghost fell it actually didn't fall on
[1:02:37] his oozin Street first it fell on some
[1:02:38] one ERA some other Street and then they
[1:02:40] moved the meetings to his ooza Street I
[1:02:42] don't know if you knew that they started
[1:02:44] the Holy Ghost actually fell in a person
[1:02:46] of the Argan Bright House I forget the
[1:02:49] street it was it wasn't on his ooze the
[1:02:50] street once it got so big though they
[1:02:53] moved it to Azusa Street okay but it
[1:02:57] started in house prayer meetings so this
[1:03:01] is going to give us some clues about the
[1:03:03] coming of
[1:03:03] Lord that's how the church started an
[1:03:06] axe you remember the Bible said they
[1:03:07] went from house to house breaking bread
[1:03:09] when we get so hung that's that's I
[1:03:12] believe these are all clues as we
[1:03:13] approach the coming of the Lord when we
[1:03:16] get so hungry for God that we want to
[1:03:18] meet in people's houses all the time I
[1:03:21] think there'll be a good clue or ready
[1:03:23] for the coming of the Lord because
[1:03:25] that's what happened at Pentecost that's
[1:03:27] what happened when the Holy Ghost fell
[1:03:28] to Zuza Street they got so hungry for
[1:03:31] God they couldn't wait to go to church
[1:03:32] on Wednesday so they had Church on
[1:03:34] Monday night at somebody's house Oh
[1:03:37] hallelujah
[1:03:39] the believers at least or here's what I
[1:03:41] look at just for a moment the believer
[1:03:43] sense this they sense that this is the
[1:03:45] last age we've got to come back to
[1:03:48] Pentecost where they sense it in their
[1:03:51] spirits right because we know some of
[1:03:54] them not all of them but some of them
[1:03:56] just got the baptism the Holy Ghost on
[1:03:58] their spirit and not the soul the ones
[1:04:00] who went into the organization wrote up
[1:04:03] initial evidence you've got to speak in
[1:04:05] tongues or you're going to hell those
[1:04:06] people didn't get the Holy Ghost in
[1:04:08] their soul they just got it in their
[1:04:10] spirit are you with me the people that
[1:04:13] stayed out of that just stayed free and
[1:04:14] we want the Holy Ghost and we want all
[1:04:16] these gifts to operate by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:18] we don't believe in that initial
[1:04:19] evidence they actually had it in their
[1:04:21] souls so I'm showing you two differences
[1:04:23] here not just in their spirits only with
[1:04:27] evidence or we just want tongues we just
[1:04:28] want tongues we just want to but we just
[1:04:30] want God amen we just want the Holy
[1:04:33] Ghost we just want all nine gifts of the
[1:04:35] Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:36] this is who it fell in their souls but
[1:04:40] with those who denominated it just fell
[1:04:42] in their spirits because the
[1:04:44] denomination is of the devil
[1:04:47] denomination is Antichrist so the whole
[1:04:51] they didn't get it in the soul if they
[1:04:53] organized with the Antichrist spirit
[1:04:55] because organization is cutting off the
[1:04:58] Holy Ghost saying we're not going any
[1:05:00] farther you've got to speak in tongues
[1:05:02] that's Antichrist because it's making a
[1:05:05] man-made Creed it's a tradition of man
[1:05:10] so see when
[1:05:12] they could sense if they could sense the
[1:05:14] beginning of the age can't we sense the
[1:05:17] end of the age glory what seemed to be
[1:05:22] the answer came as many began to speak
[1:05:24] in tongues and manifest gifts of the
[1:05:25] Spirit
[1:05:25] it was then believed that this was
[1:05:27] indeed the long the way to restoration
[1:05:30] it was not for the latter rain can come
[1:05:33] only after the former rain which is the
[1:05:36] spring or teaching rain so they thought
[1:05:39] it was the latter rain that's my brother
[1:05:40] Branham had to rebuke the latter rain
[1:05:42] brethren remember that latter rain
[1:05:44] movement I think it started in Canada if
[1:05:46] I'm not mistaken brother Branham had to
[1:05:48] rebuke that because they were saying it
[1:05:49] was latter rain let brother have said in
[1:05:51] the church age it was former rain right
[1:05:54] brother Mannis ministry was the former
[1:05:55] rain so see we we want a census in our
[1:05:59] spirit now listen Noah sent in his
[1:06:03] spirit that judgment was soon to come so
[1:06:06] he started working building an ark for
[1:06:09] the for God but before this enoch sense
[1:06:13] in his spirit that there's going to be a
[1:06:15] rapture so i better walk with God praise
[1:06:20] the Lord at Jesus's first coming Simeon
[1:06:23] and Anna were praying and fasting
[1:06:26] constantly in the temple of God and
[1:06:29] they're the only ones in the temple that
[1:06:32] caught that this was the Messiah because
[1:06:35] they were in constant contact with the
[1:06:37] Holy Spirit amen
[1:06:40] they sensed it then the spiritual sense
[1:06:43] of mine this is an important time
[1:06:45] something's happening something's going
[1:06:47] on and that's why I say Church you and I
[1:06:50] will sense the rapture not by guessing
[1:06:53] dates but by prayer and close communion
[1:06:59] with Christ in other words prayer and
[1:07:00] fasting because the Bible said Ana
[1:07:04] ministered for what was 80 years
[1:07:05] something like 80 or 70 or 60 years with
[1:07:09] prayer and fasting in the temple and she
[1:07:10] was one of the few that actually knew
[1:07:12] that this baby was the Messiah because
[1:07:16] the Bible said Simeon came out and said
[1:07:17] that and then also Anna wasn't sure with
[1:07:20] everybody else in the temple because
[1:07:22] member
[1:07:23] Simeon was back there praying the Holy
[1:07:24] Ghost said you'll not die until you see
[1:07:26] the Lord's Christ one of these days the
[1:07:30] Holy Ghost is going to tell somebody
[1:07:31] you're not going to die til you see
[1:07:33] Jesus in the air amen
[1:07:35] they're gonna sense it in their spirit
[1:07:37] because they're fully committed to the
[1:07:40] Word of the hour it's going to happen
[1:07:43] now let me go back this I got two things
[1:07:45] I want to share I forgot when I said I
[1:07:48] preached this two Sundays ago let me go
[1:07:51] back to this just something came on my
[1:07:53] heart I was reading this on Monday
[1:07:55] remember I believe somebody on Facebook
[1:07:57] is just making a big mistake they're
[1:07:59] just trying to guess at the dates here's
[1:08:01] how they're guessing at the rapture do
[1:08:03] you remember this when I preaches this
[1:08:05] year is Israel's Jubilee year at 70
[1:08:07] years now the first thing wrong a
[1:08:09] Jubilee is not after 70 years it's after
[1:08:13] 50 and I went back and read that this
[1:08:17] week I was like whoa that was wrong as
[1:08:20] well a Jubilee is not after 70 but you
[1:08:24] believes after 50 I'm sorry the Jubilee
[1:08:26] is the 50th that's after 49 the next
[1:08:28] year after 49 is 50 50s the Jubilee and
[1:08:33] so see there they're guessing they're
[1:08:36] putting Jubilee mixing up with 70 which
[1:08:39] was Daniels well I'm sorry no the 70
[1:08:41] years in Babylon right Israel seven
[1:08:43] years in Babylon with Daniel down there
[1:08:45] and then see Billy Graham left the
[1:08:48] scenes to the they're mixing up all
[1:08:50] these different thoughts and they're
[1:08:52] guessing at the coming of the Lord and
[1:08:54] so see they're saying okay because it's
[1:08:56] the Jubilee year which is not 70 because
[1:08:59] it's Jubilee Billy Graham's just left
[1:09:01] now the 144,000 have to be born again
[1:09:03] they're just guessing and I'll say like
[1:09:07] this they got the wrong date
[1:09:09] now you say another thought this came to
[1:09:12] my mind too is I was back there praying
[1:09:13] in my office there I want to say this
[1:09:17] too the second thought I had the
[1:09:24] to sense it in our spirit as we pray and
[1:09:26] fast now how many know this how many
[1:09:28] know that the Oral Roberts University
[1:09:31] has a chapel and they pray 24 hours a
[1:09:34] day how many know that did you know that
[1:09:37] when Oral Roberts built that one of his
[1:09:39] desires was to have a 24-hour prayer
[1:09:42] chain where they take an hour at a time
[1:09:44] the students will come in there go pray
[1:09:46] for an hour and as soon as they leave
[1:09:47] somebody else comes in and 24 hours
[1:09:50] around the clock they're praying now
[1:09:52] that's a good thing Church but let me
[1:09:54] ask you even though they're praying 24
[1:09:57] hours a day are they going to sense the
[1:10:00] rapture as far as the bride is concerned
[1:10:03] no they can because they transgress the
[1:10:07] Word of God they let women paint their
[1:10:10] face cut their hair is that men preach
[1:10:12] false doctrine Creed's a man they beg
[1:10:15] for money they're in politics right
[1:10:18] they're involved with politics and and
[1:10:19] all these sports and everything like
[1:10:21] March Madness or Roberts teams make it
[1:10:24] to there it's all about the so they have
[1:10:26] all this emphasis on natural things
[1:10:28] instead of spiritual things so see even
[1:10:32] though and I want to make sure you say
[1:10:33] that make sure you understand that even
[1:10:35] at with 24 hours of Prayer if they never
[1:10:38] yield to the word the prayer is good but
[1:10:41] it's not going to get them anywhere you
[1:10:43] got a watch and pray you have to have
[1:10:45] spirit and truth they'll have all the
[1:10:48] Spirit praying and they'll speak in
[1:10:50] tongues and all Roberts you know and the
[1:10:53] Holy Spirit will anoint them but when it
[1:10:55] comes back to acknowledging the word
[1:10:56] they turn that down so they're not going
[1:10:59] to sense the rapture but man so the
[1:11:01] rapture is going to go and they're not
[1:11:02] even gonna know what happened so I want
[1:11:06] to make sure we balance that out that
[1:11:08] you know we could we could feel bad like
[1:11:09] well we're not praying 24 hours a day
[1:11:11] well we don't have to pray 24 hours a
[1:11:12] day we I mean we should pray without
[1:11:15] ceasing in our spirits but see we've got
[1:11:18] to pray and then hear what the spirits
[1:11:20] saying amen they're praying and not
[1:11:23] hearing what the spirits say they're
[1:11:26] praying and hearing what the university
[1:11:28] saying are you think oh we got to build
[1:11:31] a new football facility we got to build
[1:11:33] new that's what they're hearing they're
[1:11:35] praying and getting anointing for good
[1:11:37] times and merit
[1:11:38] and feeling good and all those great
[1:11:41] things
[1:11:41] those are great dude great to be healed
[1:11:43] great to get salvation but when it comes
[1:11:46] down to well she women preach or not you
[1:11:48] know they don't hear what the spirit
[1:11:50] saying so but like both have said would
[1:11:52] bathe them they're gonna take God's
[1:11:53] second word God's gonna say don't preach
[1:11:56] well the women will keep praying then
[1:11:58] got to say okay preach and brother have
[1:12:01] said I don't doubt at all that God told
[1:12:03] those women to preach but it was in his
[1:12:05] first word hey uh yeah I don't doubt God
[1:12:10] told Joyce Meyer to preach but it wasn't
[1:12:12] his first word that he told her it's
[1:12:15] impossible because that's not his
[1:12:17] perfect will so do you understand that
[1:12:21] those two examples people in the message
[1:12:23] guessing which is I mean that's that's
[1:12:25] fine if they want to guess but I don't
[1:12:26] think that's the way to go about it I
[1:12:28] think the thing to do is pray and fast
[1:12:30] and say Lord is this your time if so get
[1:12:33] me ready help me to sense it in your in
[1:12:35] your spirit help me to feel your spirit
[1:12:38] in my spirit not guess and try to place
[1:12:40] it together that's not what we want to
[1:12:42] do the rapture won't be a guessing game
[1:12:44] it'll be a closer walk with Christ
[1:12:46] because that's what Enoch was he just
[1:12:50] got closer and closer till one day God
[1:12:51] said do you want to come a little bit
[1:12:53] higher today tell your wife goodbye tell
[1:12:55] your family goodbye he was the friend of
[1:13:00] God and we want to be God's friend amen
[1:13:03] I believe that with all my heart sure
[1:13:06] it's gonna come that way if they sense
[1:13:08] the beginning of the church age will
[1:13:10] sense the end of the church age will be
[1:13:13] feeling more of a burden for the word
[1:13:14] more of a burden for prayer more of a
[1:13:16] burden for all these spiritual things
[1:13:18] will be feeling that at the coming of
[1:13:21] the Lord we have to because that's what
[1:13:23] Enoch experienced that's what everybody
[1:13:24] experienced remember didn't didn't uh he
[1:13:27] lied you know there he said watch me
[1:13:29] today if you see me today and catch my
[1:13:32] garment you'll get a double portion he
[1:13:34] knew the time of the rapture he meant he
[1:13:37] knew his rapture was coming amen he
[1:13:39] sensed it God had let him know somehow
[1:13:42] God is gonna let us sense the rapture of
[1:13:44] the church absolutely now let's look at
[1:13:48] the history again Azusa with MC Moore
[1:13:51] from Houston
[1:13:52] just bided to come pastor in Los Angeles
[1:13:54] by woman pastors Nene Lord in February
[1:13:56] of 1906 that watch is February March
[1:13:59] April May three months before the Holy
[1:14:02] Ghost fell now yours before the churches
[1:14:07] were praying continually for the power
[1:14:08] of the Spirit like I said three or four
[1:14:09] years one week after preaching about
[1:14:11] tongues and the woman's church he was
[1:14:13] kicked out of the church and this is the
[1:14:14] source if you want to watch it it's a
[1:14:15] really good really reverent video except
[1:14:19] they keep pushing evidence of tongues
[1:14:20] evidence evidence evidence but I just
[1:14:22] ignore that that's nonsense I'm glad I'm
[1:14:24] glad they want supernatural but the you
[1:14:26] can't major on a minor and they can't
[1:14:28] make false doctrine now as soon as he
[1:14:31] got kicked out William Seymore accepted
[1:14:34] an invitation to stay with Edward S Lee
[1:14:36] he was one of that woman's woman pastors
[1:14:38] and congregation members one of the
[1:14:41] laity so he felt bad for the preacher
[1:14:43] that got kicked out he said you can come
[1:14:45] stay with me too you find a job they
[1:14:48] didn't know what to do so they just
[1:14:49] began praying fervently they didn't know
[1:14:51] what to do and isn't that amazing when
[1:14:55] there's nowhere else to go what's the
[1:14:56] last choice prayer what should be our
[1:14:58] first choice prayer but let me ask you
[1:15:02] this was that woman let her Lord to
[1:15:04] invite him out yes because his preaching
[1:15:07] was going to create such a hunger for
[1:15:08] the Holy Ghost that for three months the
[1:15:10] Holy Ghost would fall in a great way now
[1:15:16] from what the
[1:15:17] the documentary said other believers
[1:15:21] heard of this devotion of Prayer and
[1:15:23] joined Seymour was praying five to seven
[1:15:25] hours a day now he wasn't working Church
[1:15:27] Lee Edward Lee wood the history said he
[1:15:31] would pray like about a couple hours and
[1:15:34] then get up and go to work at a printing
[1:15:36] shop I think he worked at but he would
[1:15:37] let a seymour stay there and pray in his
[1:15:40] house and the prayer meeting moved to
[1:15:44] the Asbury house and this is where the
[1:15:45] Holy Ghost fell at the Asbury house so
[1:15:51] they were he was preaching and praying
[1:15:54] preaching pray he realized I need more
[1:15:57] prayer he didn't have enough they did
[1:15:59] not have enough power of prayer so he
[1:16:02] has to his friends from Houston to join
[1:16:04] his prayer meetings and they agreed he
[1:16:06] imagined traveling across the state just
[1:16:08] to come and pray for the Holy Ghost see
[1:16:10] this is the kind of dedication and
[1:16:11] sacrifice we want to see in our lives
[1:16:13] right where people are hungry to pray
[1:16:16] where people are hungry for the Holy
[1:16:18] Ghost to fall that's how I was telling
[1:16:20] my wife you know what I said and hope
[1:16:22] everybody understand it's like with the
[1:16:23] church building fund I think that's a
[1:16:25] good thing
[1:16:25] I think that's okay but I said if I have
[1:16:29] the choice I want to see people more
[1:16:31] hungry for praying for the Holy Ghost
[1:16:32] than for praying for a church building
[1:16:34] which I think it's good to have a
[1:16:36] building and I think that's fine but I
[1:16:40] think I think our church will do will be
[1:16:44] best to really hunger and pray for the
[1:16:48] Holy Ghost to fall and I'm not saying
[1:16:50] people are praying for a building I'm
[1:16:51] not saying that I'm just saying of it if
[1:16:53] there's more excitement for a building
[1:16:55] than there is praying for the Holy Ghost
[1:16:57] before service something's wrong right
[1:16:59] are you with me Church does that make
[1:17:01] sense if people like I said when I miss
[1:17:03] the denominations I are the oneness
[1:17:05] Pentecostals they're clapping louder for
[1:17:08] church building than they offer the Holy
[1:17:10] Ghost I don't want that to happen here I
[1:17:13] want us to pray more for the Holy Ghost
[1:17:15] than praying for saving for a church
[1:17:17] building because I got plenty of room
[1:17:19] here you know I personally don't I told
[1:17:22] back I said I personally don't want a
[1:17:23] building because I'm happy with what we
[1:17:25] got now and now if we all grow this
[1:17:27] building sure they made will by building
[1:17:30] but I just said well brother vague I'll
[1:17:31] just throw my vote in with you if you
[1:17:33] want it I'm the other trustee when I got
[1:17:35] into trustees I said how I'll throw my
[1:17:37] vote in with you like that's what
[1:17:38] brother Branham did he said the people
[1:17:40] want to build on the tabernacle I'll
[1:17:42] throw my vote in with you but the whole
[1:17:44] point behind this is that they were
[1:17:46] hungry for the Holy Ghost to fall and
[1:17:49] that's what we've got to be hungry for
[1:17:52] the Spirit of God to move that's right
[1:17:55] so they entered a season of prayer from
[1:17:58] February to April on April 6 seymour
[1:18:04] asked them to fast and pray for 10 days
[1:18:06] why because Acts chapter 2 right it was
[1:18:10] the day of Pentecost they were praying
[1:18:11] in the upper room for 10 days so William
[1:18:14] Seymore there's the leading the Bible
[1:18:16] study to lean the prairies he said who
[1:18:18] will join me for prayer and fasting and
[1:18:19] he had about you know five or six people
[1:18:21] that was said okay will praying fast for
[1:18:23] 10 days I don't know if they you know
[1:18:25] what eat when the Sun went down I don't
[1:18:26] know I'm not sure how they did that but
[1:18:28] I know you got to eat and drink a little
[1:18:31] bit you know unless there's a
[1:18:34] supernatural anointing where you don't
[1:18:35] have to eat or drink like Jesus but most
[1:18:37] normal people have to do that now I said
[1:18:40] three days later so only three days into
[1:18:43] the 10-day commitment Seymour was
[1:18:47] preaching on acts 2:4 and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:49] fell unknown tongues were spoken
[1:18:51] interpreted into English and the one
[1:18:57] testimony of Seymour's wife at this time
[1:19:00] when the Holy Ghost felt they weren't
[1:19:02] married yet but the woman that was going
[1:19:03] to be his wife afraid her name Jenny ER
[1:19:05] I think was Jenny young or something she
[1:19:09] said the Holy Ghost Strucker she fell
[1:19:11] off her chair sorry
[1:19:15] and then he she said the Holy Ghost led
[1:19:18] her to the piano and she started playing
[1:19:21] piano and singing and never he'd even
[1:19:24] practiced piano in her whole life
[1:19:28] amen and this was all because they sense
[1:19:32] this was the last Church age oh I wonder
[1:19:34] what's gonna happen when we come down to
[1:19:36] the coming of the Lord this was this
[1:19:39] wasn't done in public this was a small
[1:19:41] private show
[1:19:42] this light brother Adam said they met he
[1:19:45] said it won't be a public show so she
[1:19:49] falls over she gets up she goes over
[1:19:51] starts singing in the Holies what does
[1:19:52] the Holy Ghost 1 the Holy Ghost wants
[1:19:54] your worship the Holy Ghost wants you to
[1:19:57] praise him but I like the seat and
[1:20:02] that's what I told you before all the
[1:20:04] history says that when the Holy Ghost
[1:20:05] fell yes it was unknown tongues but then
[1:20:08] the interpretations came behind it so it
[1:20:11] was the genuine Holy Ghost and all the
[1:20:13] people that were true to God they kept
[1:20:15] the tongues in order they never made
[1:20:18] tongues the initial evidence but when it
[1:20:21] fell it genuinely fell it was the true
[1:20:24] Holy Ghost that fell at his oozy Street
[1:20:26] well the has Barry House on whatever
[1:20:28] Street it was but you know what I'm
[1:20:30] talking about now neighbors gather to
[1:20:33] see what was going on the preach porch
[1:20:35] meetings lasted for three days and three
[1:20:37] nights and after that they moved to this
[1:20:39] church on his uu Street the services
[1:20:44] went on for three years seven days a
[1:20:47] week three times a day and did you know
[1:20:53] the history said they never announced
[1:20:55] who was going to preach at all three
[1:20:56] services they would just pray until God
[1:20:59] anointed oh man or woman another see
[1:21:02] that was off the word then to go up and
[1:21:04] preach and you know William Seymour you
[1:21:06] know what he did he took two peach
[1:21:08] baskets and he you know how you have a
[1:21:11] peach basket
[1:21:12] he stood them up on their side he put
[1:21:15] two up on their side he put his knees in
[1:21:17] the first basket and his head in the
[1:21:19] second basket in the corner so he was
[1:21:21] over like this in the corner praying and
[1:21:24] he would pray like that until the
[1:21:26] service got started and then he knew who
[1:21:28] was gonna preach or if he was letting
[1:21:30] the Lord to preach that he would go up
[1:21:31] there that's how much he was willing to
[1:21:33] humble himself he stuck his head and
[1:21:36] knees in a peach basket to humble
[1:21:38] himself then the Bible say that Moses
[1:21:41] was the meekest man on the earth that's
[1:21:43] why people loved William Seymore he was
[1:21:45] so humble the people said he was just
[1:21:47] like a child when you talked to him he
[1:21:49] had such joy for the Lord and he was
[1:21:51] always just you know being humble to
[1:21:54] pray about that you know hard to see
[1:21:55] what
[1:21:56] Lord leads me to do he wasn't quick to
[1:21:57] guess and he wasn't guessing he wanted
[1:22:00] to pray and make sure got the answer
[1:22:01] from the Lord what a humble servant Lord
[1:22:05] three years seven days a week three
[1:22:09] services a day and that if you were if
[1:22:11] you recall the Welshman wrote well
[1:22:13] survival does anyone ever study that I
[1:22:15] preached on it years ago I think was in
[1:22:17] 2008 I preached on it the Welsh revival
[1:22:19] with Evan Roberts he was a white man
[1:22:21] over in Wales and he God led him to
[1:22:23] start a revival the same thing happened
[1:22:25] the revival he went on for about three
[1:22:27] or four years that's what brother man
[1:22:28] instead of a revival last three or four
[1:22:30] years and then he so wore himself out
[1:22:33] Evan Roberts that he had to be bedridden
[1:22:35] for a couple of years because he put so
[1:22:37] much energy and so much of his human
[1:22:39] effort into the meetings he almost wore
[1:22:42] himself out he died an early death
[1:22:43] because he was so into prayer so into
[1:22:46] the things of God he wore himself out
[1:22:49] for the kingdom of God now does that
[1:22:52] help by God's grace they sense that the
[1:22:55] Holy Ghost was going to fall so they
[1:22:57] went praying for it for three or four
[1:22:58] years and then they got really dedicated
[1:23:01] to prayer and so I wonder Church I
[1:23:04] wonder if that's gonna happen before the
[1:23:05] end time oh my if they could sense the
[1:23:09] beginning we are going to sense the end
[1:23:11] praise the Lord mother may have said
[1:23:16] tongues were manifestation but not the
[1:23:18] evidence going back to the Zuzu Street
[1:23:20] the falsity of the doctrine cannot only
[1:23:23] be seen by a lack of scripture to
[1:23:25] substantiate it but those who subscribe
[1:23:27] to the doctrine immediately organize on
[1:23:29] the basis of the doctrine proving they
[1:23:31] were not in the truth as they would have
[1:23:33] people to believe oh it looked good it
[1:23:35] looked like the return of Pentecost but
[1:23:37] it proved it wasn't it could not be for
[1:23:39] organiz organized that is death not life
[1:23:42] it looks so close to the real that
[1:23:44] multitudes were deceived now
[1:23:50] the genuine what was it it was the husk
[1:23:52] the chaff in the green soft sheath form
[1:23:56] it looked like it was the real thing but
[1:23:58] as one can go into the field and see
[1:24:00] what the hut I'm sorry what looks
[1:24:01] exactly like wheat and yet is only the
[1:24:03] husk for the wheat seed has not yet
[1:24:07] formed so this was but the soft shell
[1:24:09] that looked like the real grain yet to
[1:24:12] come
[1:24:13] the original wheat seed of Pentecost was
[1:24:16] come back in the last stage it had been
[1:24:18] buried at man I'm sorry Nicaea it set up
[1:24:21] a shoot at sardis it grew a tassel
[1:24:23] philadelphia it was too mature a layer
[1:24:25] to sia but it could not be back to the
[1:24:28] original until the word was restored the
[1:24:30] Prophet had not yet come upon the scene
[1:24:34] now one thing that's interesting too is
[1:24:36] William Seymore didn't receive the Holy
[1:24:39] Ghost until the third day of the revival
[1:24:41] so jenny received it a Edouard guy
[1:24:45] received it different ones received it
[1:24:47] and he stuck around the revival until he
[1:24:50] received the baptism of Holy Ghost I
[1:24:52] thought my the the preacher himself
[1:24:54] didn't receive the Holy Ghost the first
[1:24:55] night and what does that tell us
[1:24:57] we got a stay with God's Word stay with
[1:25:00] the revival if you see people the holy
[1:25:02] spirit fought on people just hang around
[1:25:03] them pretty soon if you're faithful
[1:25:05] pretty soon if you keep seeking God it's
[1:25:07] gonna fall on you too yes amen
[1:25:11] that's exactly right the thing is people
[1:25:14] get discouraged as oh maybe God doesn't
[1:25:16] want to fill me maybe God wants to God
[1:25:19] promised amen
[1:25:20] for those who are baptized in Lord Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ you shall receive the gift of the
[1:25:24] Holy Ghost but we got to stay with it
[1:25:26] amen God may be testing our faith praise
[1:25:31] the Lord but now according to the time
[1:25:34] where do we stand in the lair of scene
[1:25:35] age the Prophet messenger of revelation
[1:25:37] 10 7 must already be in the land once
[1:25:40] more thus saith the Lord must be here
[1:25:42] ready to be manifested with infallible
[1:25:44] vindication this is the true seed
[1:25:47] already maturing and then the harvest so
[1:25:50] see they'll say at the Lord when we hear
[1:25:51] brother Branham say that when we preach
[1:25:53] that that's going to bring us to a
[1:25:55] harvest because it's God's word harvest
[1:26:01] yes harvest time the two vines that grew
[1:26:04] together and intertwine their branches
[1:26:05] are now to be separated the fruits of
[1:26:09] those vines were which were at such
[1:26:11] variance will be gathered into separate
[1:26:13] Garner's the two spirits will go to
[1:26:15] their separate destinations now it is
[1:26:17] time to heed the final call that comes
[1:26:19] only to the wheat bride come out of her
[1:26:21] my people that you be not partakers of
[1:26:24] her sins and that ye wheat received not
[1:26:27] her tears or plagues the great
[1:26:29] tribulation of the 6co Matthew 24 can
[1:26:33] you say Amen all right the last warning
[1:26:36] of the spear so this is actually the
[1:26:38] section where the chapter ends so I
[1:26:40] think I'm gonna get there by God's grace
[1:26:41] then we're gonna finish with this
[1:26:43] tonight the last warning of the Holy
[1:26:47] Spirit we this was our text tonight he
[1:26:48] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:26:50] spirit saith unto the churches this is
[1:26:53] the last warning there will not be
[1:26:55] another the throne room has been set up
[1:26:57] this beautiful the twelve foundations
[1:27:00] have been laid the streets of gold had
[1:27:03] been paved the gates of gigantic pearls
[1:27:07] are raised and hinged together like a
[1:27:10] pyramid she stands so fair and glorious
[1:27:13] the heavenly beings who have prepared
[1:27:16] her watch breathlessly for she glistens
[1:27:19] and shines with a glory that is
[1:27:20] unearthly every facet of her beauty
[1:27:23] tells a story of amazing grace in Jesus
[1:27:25] love she is a city prepared for a
[1:27:29] prepared people she waits only her
[1:27:32] inhabitants and soon they will throng
[1:27:35] her streets with joy yes it is the last
[1:27:38] call the Spirit will not speak in
[1:27:40] another tongue I'm sorry it was not
[1:27:42] speaking another age the ages are over
[1:27:45] in that striking right now they're
[1:27:48] saying build the wall build the wall
[1:27:49] build the wall right but up in heaven
[1:27:52] the walls are actually being built the
[1:27:55] gates are actually going up why because
[1:27:58] they can sense the anointing of the hour
[1:28:00] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:28:03] that heavenly City is being constructed
[1:28:06] the walls are being placed up the
[1:28:08] foundations are being built up and the
[1:28:11] people can sense that something's being
[1:28:12] built
[1:28:14] but thank God at this moment the age is
[1:28:18] not over he is yet crying and his cries
[1:28:21] not only in the spiritual ears of men by
[1:28:24] his spirit but once again a prophet is
[1:28:27] in the land course brother Brennan once
[1:28:29] more God will reveal the truth as he did
[1:28:31] to Paul in the days of the seventh
[1:28:33] messenger in the days of later seen age
[1:28:36] its messenger reveal the mysteries of
[1:28:37] God has revealed to Paul he will speak
[1:28:41] out and those who receive that prophet
[1:28:43] in his own name will receive the benefit
[1:28:46] effect of that prophets ministry how
[1:28:50] many lives have been benefitted by the
[1:28:51] ministry brother Branham mine has
[1:28:53] tremendously been benefited by the
[1:28:55] ministry brother Branham and they that
[1:28:59] hear him will be blessed and become part
[1:29:01] of the bride of the last day were
[1:29:03] mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit
[1:29:07] and the bride say come the corn of wheat
[1:29:11] the bride wheat that fell into the
[1:29:13] ground that Nicaea has come back to
[1:29:15] original word grain again
[1:29:18] praise God forever yes listen to the
[1:29:21] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:29:24] in the last age what he says from God
[1:29:27] the bride will say the spirit and the
[1:29:32] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[1:29:35] same thing hallelujah Jesus and what
[1:29:40] they say will have been already said in
[1:29:43] the Word of God Oh hallelujah that's why
[1:29:46] I love I can preach a series on the
[1:29:48] church ages I can bridge a series on the
[1:29:50] wisdom of God I can preach a series on
[1:29:53] Ephesians because I know whatever is in
[1:29:57] the word the Spirit is going to be
[1:29:59] saying with the right interpretation
[1:30:03] that's right now what
[1:30:09] one thing we're gonna be saying and what
[1:30:11] they will be saying is already said the
[1:30:12] word that we saying come out from among
[1:30:14] or now and be separate the cries gone
[1:30:18] out the cries going out how long with a
[1:30:21] voice cry we do not know but one thing
[1:30:23] we do know it won't be long or this is
[1:30:27] the last age does that help by the grace
[1:30:31] of Lord that's beautiful
[1:30:33] the spirit and the bride say come so we
[1:30:36] know one of our last messages will be
[1:30:40] going to the denomination saying come
[1:30:43] out of denominations and come in be
[1:30:46] separate from denominations and come
[1:30:48] into Christ and you remember what was
[1:30:50] Abraham's last call Abraham's last call
[1:30:52] was for lot to come out of Sodom right
[1:30:55] that was his last prayer his last
[1:30:57] intercession the holy spirit was Lord
[1:30:59] bring out lot don't destroy the
[1:31:01] righteous with the wicked let's stay in
[1:31:08] our feet this is the last slide here
[1:31:09] because then brother I'm just gives the
[1:31:11] pledge he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:31:14] what the Spirit says to the churches the
[1:31:16] Spirit has spoken the Setting Sun is
[1:31:20] about to fade into eternity for the
[1:31:22] church ages then it will all be over
[1:31:26] then it will be too late to come but if
[1:31:29] somewhere in this series God has dealt
[1:31:31] with you by his Spirit may you even now
[1:31:34] turn to him and repentance and give your
[1:31:36] life to him that by his Spirit he may
[1:31:39] give you eternal life hey man what a way
[1:31:42] to end the chapter there hear what the
[1:31:46] Spirit is saying receive eternal life
[1:31:49] and then brother Branham at the end of
[1:31:52] the sermon I must get past him and he's
[1:31:55] here I got a couple more and then the
[1:31:58] server
[1:31:59] gives a pledge brother Graham tells his
[1:32:02] church when he should make a pledge to
[1:32:04] God to constantly seek and wait for the
[1:32:07] Holy Ghost what were they doing in Los
[1:32:09] Angeles before Azusa Street they were
[1:32:11] saying God send the Holy Ghost
[1:32:14] God send the Holy Ghost God sends
[1:32:17] supernatural power if you get tired of
[1:32:19] praying for the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:32:20] the wrong spirit because that's what
[1:32:23] they had at the beginning the age and
[1:32:25] that's what we're gonna have at the end
[1:32:26] of the age this cry for we need the more
[1:32:29] of the Holy Ghost we need God to fall we
[1:32:32] want the supernatural power of God we
[1:32:34] want the Word of God amen so brother
[1:32:37] Adams he's tying the church at the end
[1:32:39] of this whole series in 1960 he said
[1:32:41] Teddy play there's a fountain filled
[1:32:43] with blood now friends that's standing
[1:32:45] on your feet you're trying to accept the
[1:32:46] sweetness the Lord Jesus the same Bible
[1:32:49] that tells us that these things would
[1:32:50] happen broth in the past just exactly
[1:32:53] the way he promised
[1:32:54] now the promise Peter says unto you your
[1:32:56] children then as far off even as many as
[1:32:58] the Lord our God shall call you see that
[1:33:00] because you want the blessing of God on
[1:33:02] you honey what the blessing of God on
[1:33:04] them every day I want the blessing of
[1:33:06] God and as a servant I pray for you I'll
[1:33:10] pray that God will give you the baptism
[1:33:12] of the Holy Ghost and I wonder if you
[1:33:14] could do this in your heart if you're
[1:33:16] sincere if you would make this promise
[1:33:20] to God what a what a request in other
[1:33:22] words would you make a vow to God would
[1:33:25] you make a promise to God he says God I
[1:33:28] from this time standing on my feet
[1:33:31] seeking this baptism the Holy Ghost I
[1:33:32] shall constantly pray and wait until you
[1:33:36] fill me with the Holy Ghost he said will
[1:33:38] you make that promise to God by raising
[1:33:40] your hands hey man he said I will
[1:33:44] constantly pray constantly until you
[1:33:46] fill me with the sweetness and goodness
[1:33:49] of the Spirit amen
[1:33:53] brother man said I offer my prayer for
[1:33:55] you now as we bow our heads now here's
[1:33:57] this prayer how many father
[1:33:58] they are the trophies of your presence
[1:34:00] they know that these words are true
[1:34:02] because they're yours
[1:34:03] they know that you have been given I'm
[1:34:05] sorry they've been given by the Holy
[1:34:06] Spirit because they are the Word of God
[1:34:08] and they have been convinced that they
[1:34:10] need you that they need the sweet
[1:34:12] the Holy Spirit in our life to give them
[1:34:14] over coming power and they will receive
[1:34:19] power from on high
[1:34:20] receive the power to live a Christian
[1:34:22] life to receive power to overcome
[1:34:25] temptations amen
[1:34:27] glory as a song was just singing they
[1:34:30] gathered up a room was praying his name
[1:34:33] there are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:34] and power for church service came that's
[1:34:38] what they want power for service to come
[1:34:40] upon them I pray the Father as your
[1:34:43] servant as the you see them raised in
[1:34:45] their hands that they have made a pledge
[1:34:47] to you and a promise that they shall
[1:34:50] never cease they'll not lay it aside but
[1:34:53] they will pray until you fill them Lord
[1:34:56] to a satisfying portion of thy holy
[1:34:59] presence in their life I offer my prayer
[1:35:02] in their behalf Lord as your servant
[1:35:05] that they will be filled with the Holy
[1:35:07] Ghost lord I pray that they'll not leave
[1:35:09] this church until that happens and that
[1:35:11] they'll be right here until each soul is
[1:35:13] filled with the Holy Ghost Granite Lord
[1:35:15] and that's my last slide because next
[1:35:18] time I'm gonna preach on the resume Lord
[1:35:20] willing we'll look at that by the grace
[1:35:22] of God how many appreciate that prayer
[1:35:24] by brother Branham and I think it
[1:35:27] matches like I said I think it matches
[1:35:29] at the beginning of the age they were so
[1:35:31] hungry for the supernatural and here at
[1:35:34] the end of the age brother branham prays
[1:35:36] the same thing God may they just pray
[1:35:38] for more of the Holy Ghost more
[1:35:41] supernatural may they not get complacent
[1:35:44] in their walk with God may they just
[1:35:47] pledge to always seek for more of the
[1:35:49] Holy Ghost how many think that's a good
[1:35:51] thing to pray tonight I think it's a
[1:35:53] good thing to pray every night and I
[1:35:55] want to end the service by praying that
[1:35:56] let's pray it for ourselves let's pray
[1:35:59] for others especially the children think
[1:36:01] about that like brother man there's a
[1:36:02] quote brother Branham says that if one
[1:36:04] of these children here or the ones who
[1:36:06] aren't here if their name is on the last
[1:36:08] book of life the rapture can't go until
[1:36:10] they're born again and so we'll keep
[1:36:13] having church we'll keep having preached
[1:36:15] okay we'll keep doing all these things
[1:36:17] until every last soul has been born
[1:36:19] again amen and they have the blessing
[1:36:22] that we've experienced they men the
[1:36:25] power of God upon
[1:36:26] and that's why I bring my children up
[1:36:27] here every Sunday morning I bring them
[1:36:29] up here I pray for them that God would
[1:36:31] fill them with the Holy Ghost I'll say
[1:36:33] like this like those churches in Los
[1:36:35] Angeles I'll keep praying for 3 or 4
[1:36:37] years until God does it I'm not gonna
[1:36:40] quit I'm not gonna give up on God why
[1:36:42] because I know God's got a time and
[1:36:43] season and I know this if there's a deep
[1:36:46] call in my heart to see all these fill
[1:36:48] with all he goes there's got to be a
[1:36:49] deep to respond how do you a men and
[1:36:54] there's a deep call for us to start the
[1:36:55] church and then God has people here in
[1:36:58] Accra that need a church we didn't even
[1:36:59] know it there hadn't been a deep to
[1:37:01] respond hallelujah
[1:37:04] like sister Naomi and sister Connie and
[1:37:06] all these Saints here in Akron if
[1:37:07] there's a deep call for seven people to
[1:37:10] start the church and now we're up to a
[1:37:11] twenty adults and 21 22 kids there
[1:37:15] hadn't been a deed to respond that's the
[1:37:18] same thing that's in my soul to see
[1:37:20] people fill with the Holy Ghost if
[1:37:21] there's a deep desire of mine to see
[1:37:24] them build with the Holy Ghost there's
[1:37:25] got to be a Holy Ghost to respond to it
[1:37:28] hey man and there's a deep golfer by the
[1:37:31] Adam who want to go out to the the fairs
[1:37:35] out there the flea markets and and win
[1:37:37] assault of Christ there's got to be a
[1:37:39] deep to respond brother hallelujah it's
[1:37:43] exactly right
[1:37:44] amen and I was looking back at my uh my
[1:37:48] pictures and I saw a picture of in this
[1:37:50] in the in August in August of 2014 with
[1:37:54] brother Brooks and I went out into the
[1:37:55] parks and we witnessed and we made these
[1:37:57] signs I still got in the back of my car
[1:37:58] we are if we are praying for souls in a
[1:38:01] park we were singing and clapping and he
[1:38:03] had the tambourine out we had signs are
[1:38:05] you ready for the rapture and church it
[1:38:08] was just a few months after that the
[1:38:09] brother a man came in I saw I saw that
[1:38:13] from there so see we were so hungry we
[1:38:17] had to go out we had to do something for
[1:38:18] a soul and got it and God didn't save us
[1:38:21] so in that exact outreach but God sent
[1:38:24] us all a few months later by the grace
[1:38:26] of the Lord
[1:38:27] see there's got to be a deep to respond
[1:38:29] if you're hungry for fish and you go
[1:38:31] fishing there's got to be fish out there
[1:38:32] okay you might not get it on the first
[1:38:34] day but you're gonna get fish eventually
[1:38:37] I don't want to see fish in Akron more
[1:38:39] fish saved in Akron
[1:38:40] amen I do too I thought I'd share that
[1:38:42] by the grace of Lord let's just bow our
[1:38:44] heads here and let's pray that we can
[1:38:46] get caught up in the spirit so that we
[1:38:49] will sense the Holy Spirit getting us
[1:38:53] ready for the rapture getting soul saved
[1:38:55] getting souls filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:56] and sensing that the rapture will be
[1:39:00] near Heavenly Father we're grateful for
[1:39:05] what your prophet preached to us Lord
[1:39:07] God we're grateful here tonight to hear
[1:39:09] your word Lord I've now preached through
[1:39:12] all the the church age sermons from 1960
[1:39:15] Lord of the seven churches and now the
[1:39:18] the church age book Lord I preached what
[1:39:21] I thought were highlights to me by the
[1:39:23] Holy Spirit and so I just want to say
[1:39:27] thank you Lord God forgive me grace
