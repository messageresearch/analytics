[6:35] Saint said amen amen praise God let's
[6:39] stand and take our Bibles here
[6:40] good morning I'd like to preach a part
[6:42] two on Wednesday's sermon Wednesday we
[6:44] looked at the headstone
[6:47] with shoutings of Grace Grace so I Look
[6:49] to look at part two
[6:56] so Zechariah we'll just go to chapter 4
[6:59] verse 6 Zechariah 4 verse 6.
[7:06] thank you
[7:09] I'm just lean a little bit more I'm
[7:11] gonna bring out some former things I
[7:14] preach just regarding the temple of God
[7:16] then award-winning add a little more
[7:19] here by the grace of God
[7:21] I do apologize you know our sermon for
[7:23] Wednesday uh
[7:25] had an air uploading if you can turn
[7:27] this on occasion thank you so I
[7:29] apologize about that
[7:31] you know it just rarely happens but uh
[7:32] so I thought well since it didn't get
[7:34] posted I think I'll preach it again and
[7:36] add a little bit more into it by God's
[7:38] grace so I hope it's a blessing here
[7:40] today by the grace of God it's always a
[7:42] blessing to be in the house of the Lord
[7:43] praise God Amen Zechariah 4 verse 6 and
[7:46] 7.
[7:51] we could probably read both those verses
[7:52] together here so let's read that on
[7:54] three one two three then he answered and
[7:57] spanked unto me saying this is the word
[8:01] of the Lord unto zerubbable saying not
[8:05] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[8:08] saith the Lord of hosts who are thou o
[8:12] great Mountain before serumable Thou
[8:16] shalt become a plane and he shall bring
[8:19] forth The Headstone thereof with
[8:22] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it and
[8:25] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[8:27] his work you may be seated praise God
[8:30] you can switch over I have a few slides
[8:32] I'd like to show here
[8:35] so it's set on Wednesday you know we
[8:37] looked at this first part here and I
[8:39] think I'll just I want to back around a
[8:41] little bit on the temple of God
[8:45] so I found that picture there online I
[8:47] thought it was a pretty nice picture
[8:48] that must be zeroable because he's kind
[8:50] of given the directions here and Israel
[8:52] was trying to read rebuild the Temple of
[8:55] God it was the Temple of course that
[8:57] Solomon built and uh it was of course
[9:01] destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon
[9:03] because of their failure to obey the
[9:06] word of God God gave them hundreds of
[9:09] years of Mercy hundreds of years of
[9:11] Grace lots of long suffering how many
[9:13] leave God is long-suffering amen even
[9:15] with course with us as well you know
[9:17] he's so long-suffering he's so merciful
[9:19] but when it got to this part where the
[9:22] cup was filled up and then God poured
[9:23] out judgment upon Israel so we'll be
[9:26] looking at a little bit of historical uh
[9:29] facts here and just see how it relates
[9:32] um brother Branham calls the last stone
[9:36] that was laid on top of course you can
[9:37] see there's more stones but I'll show
[9:39] some other pictures brother Ram types
[9:41] that last Stone being laid on top to the
[9:43] rapture
[9:44] the coming of Jesus Christ to the church
[9:47] praise God so that's why we you know I
[9:50] felt led to preach on this it's been a
[9:51] while since I preached on it's been
[9:52] about 10 years actually according to my
[9:55] notes but uh it'd be just a good
[9:57] reminder here about the types in this
[9:59] and so the headstone is coming with
[10:02] shoutings of Grace Grace amen
[10:05] Hallelujah so if they shout in the Old
[10:06] Testament what about the New Testament
[10:08] praise God amen amen so we read our text
[10:11] and I just found this online too I'd
[10:13] like to just read this you know
[10:15] I don't agree with some of the dates in
[10:16] here but anyways the first temple that
[10:18] God had constructed
[10:20] other than we'd say the guardian Temple
[10:22] for Adam and Eve the garden Temple uh
[10:25] would bet would have been Moses's
[10:26] Tabernacle so we see Moses Tabernacle
[10:29] the Wilderness and then King David uh
[10:32] prepares Solomon to build Solomon's
[10:34] Temple they're around just around a
[10:37] thousand BC
[10:38] depending on who you listen to and of
[10:40] course this Temple was the first temple
[10:41] period then it got destroyed there by
[10:45] Nebuchadnezzar
[10:46] but then it's Aruba the one we're
[10:48] preaching on
[10:49] zero reconstructed it
[10:52] and so that's uh zerubel's time here not
[10:55] only the the date was later than that I
[10:57] don't believe it was 5 15. because
[10:59] brother Adam tells us the beginning of
[11:01] the date of Daniel 70 weeks he tells us
[11:04] that was 445 BC
[11:07] and so we I don't believe that's the
[11:09] right date I believe that's the wrong
[11:10] date which that wouldn't surprise
[11:11] anybody if the theologians got it wrong
[11:13] would that surprise anybody here at the
[11:15] theologians got things mixed up a little
[11:17] bit that wouldn't surprise us and so
[11:20] this Temple of course stood and and then
[11:22] uh Herod constructed a larger uh temple
[11:27] with more room for uh the people he was
[11:29] trying to win favor with the Jews and so
[11:32] Herod constructed that finished it about
[11:34] 19 BC I think it was 46 years in
[11:36] building
[11:37] and so he tore down zerubo's Temple and
[11:40] then he made a larger Temple and of
[11:42] course then this was destroyed in 70 A.D
[11:44] by Titus right the Roman Emperor Titus
[11:46] come in and remember that was about 40
[11:48] years after Israel had rejected Christ
[11:51] so there's 40 years again as a warning
[11:54] date right 40 years is a probation
[11:56] period giving them 40 years to repent
[11:59] right but they failed to repent and so
[12:01] God brought judgment in
[12:03] so again we look at we see the
[12:05] long-suffering of God we see the mercy
[12:06] of God so there's a little background
[12:08] there on the temples and uh the first
[12:10] one of course was Moses I love this
[12:12] picture you know uh uh you know the the
[12:15] you know looking down from heaven God
[12:17] God God placed the Tabernacle here the
[12:19] place of worship God told Moses and
[12:22] Aaron I'll meet with you there praise
[12:23] God I'll meet with you Above The Mercy
[12:25] Seat Hallelujah and God would meet with
[12:28] them and he said I want I want to these
[12:30] tribes on the west these tribes on the
[12:32] North these tribes on the east and south
[12:34] and imagine God just got a big smile on
[12:36] his face when he looked down from heaven
[12:37] praise God and he's seen all his people
[12:40] in the in the shape of a cross
[12:41] hallelujah hallelujah and of course that
[12:44] would remind us of the lamb slain from
[12:47] the foundation of the world praise God
[12:48] in other words God knew this whole time
[12:50] man was going to fall yep Man was
[12:52] created in God's image but God had it
[12:55] all planned out God knew man would fall
[12:56] and struggled and he said he knew the
[12:59] law would be a a a a foreshadow the law
[13:01] would be a Schoolmaster to bring us to
[13:04] Christ amen and here it is the law as a
[13:06] Schoolmaster the law was pointing us to
[13:08] the Cross hallelujah amen we couldn't
[13:11] live under law law would never work we
[13:13] could never complete it but it would
[13:15] take Grace for us to serve God
[13:18] so God looked down and of course this is
[13:20] what Balaam would have seen as well
[13:21] remember uh Bala to Balaam at the
[13:24] exalted position looked down and said oh
[13:26] how beautiful are thy tents oh Jacob
[13:29] amen hallelujah and of course it's
[13:31] beautiful Hallelujah the cross is
[13:33] beautiful amen amen it was awful for
[13:35] Jesus but beautiful for us hallelujah
[13:38] amen it's awful Friday for Christ but it
[13:39] was a good Friday for us hallelujah amen
[13:42] amen amen he suffered in our place he
[13:44] died in our place Hallelujah and he rose
[13:47] for our justification Hallelujah proving
[13:49] that we're forgiven the resurrection of
[13:51] Christ proves we are forgiven it proves
[13:54] that that our that we have a pure
[13:56] sacrifice all of our sins are washed
[13:58] away because Jesus Christ rose from the
[14:00] dead Hallelujah justification means
[14:03] declared righteous so because Jesus rose
[14:05] you are righteous this morning amen
[14:07] hallelujah praise God nothing to worry
[14:10] about don't worry about going to hell
[14:11] he's already went to hell for us he's
[14:12] already paid the price for us God
[14:15] already accepted our sacrifice amen
[14:17] hallelujah
[14:19] was accepted Hallelujah that means he
[14:21] has made us accepted in the Beloved
[14:24] Hallelujah
[14:25] I'm accepted because of my sacrifice
[14:27] you're accepted because of your
[14:29] sacrifice Jesus Christ
[14:32] makes every believer Rejoice to see the
[14:35] cross Hallelujah so like when they were
[14:37] we're on their necks amen
[14:39] Hallelujah and of course remember these
[14:41] four directions represented each one had
[14:43] a banner each one had a standard God
[14:45] placed his his people in groups and then
[14:49] you you had the West Side had the band
[14:50] or the ox the north side had the eagle
[14:52] Banner uh the East Side had the line
[14:54] Banner uh the lion l-i-o-n not Liars but
[14:58] lion lying anointing and the South had
[15:01] the anointing or the uh uh the the
[15:03] emblem of a man and each one of course
[15:06] was representing something in heaven so
[15:08] this this Camp setup was a
[15:11] representation of what God had already
[15:13] had in heaven praise God man remember
[15:15] God gave Moses this whole pattern he
[15:17] said you're going to lay it out like
[15:18] this all the details everything come
[15:20] from Heaven praise God and let me say
[15:22] like this this message from God gave to
[15:24] brother Adam it came from Heaven
[15:25] hallelujah amen it's restoring the
[15:28] pattern of the book of Acts Hallelujah
[15:31] restoring us we are a part of the book
[15:33] of Acts Church Hallelujah we're a
[15:36] continuance of the book of Acts we got
[15:37] the same baptism as the book of Acts
[15:39] amen we got the same gifts of the Spirit
[15:41] as the book of Acts the same Doctrine
[15:44] the same life the same love and care one
[15:46] for another praise God Amen that's the
[15:48] book of Acts Hallelujah
[15:50] and remember said these beasts when
[15:53] brother Adam preached them brother said
[15:54] these four beasts are also in heaven
[15:56] these four are in heaven the eagle
[15:58] anointings in heaven so there's an angel
[16:00] cherubim that has an eagle head in
[16:03] heaven a lion one that has a lion head
[16:05] in heaven one that has a man the one
[16:07] that has an oxen and they surround the
[16:09] Throne of God hallelujah
[16:12] so we see the same we see both four uh
[16:15] emblems here on Earth in Moses time as
[16:18] they are in heaven praise God and
[16:20] brother Adam said these are these are
[16:22] the four anoint things on the church and
[16:25] he said currently we're under the eagle
[16:27] anointing praise God and the eagle
[16:29] watches and he goes after prey
[16:32] Hallelujah and we watch and pray
[16:34] Hallelujah yes that's what we do we win
[16:36] of course Eagle represents a prophet ego
[16:38] represents God and we have the prophetic
[16:41] Revelation the mysteries of God have
[16:43] been finished in this hour Hallelujah
[16:45] another age had that we've got the
[16:47] mysteries of God finished Hallelujah
[16:49] yeah and what do they do they help us
[16:51] live a holy life hallelujah amen they
[16:53] help us live a Christian Life without it
[16:55] we want to live in Hallelujah but
[16:57] because we got the Revelation now we can
[16:59] live a Christian Life Hallelujah
[17:01] it's the anointing for this day and
[17:03] brother Adam says don't forget it these
[17:05] are the reformers when the Beast went
[17:07] forth in the form of a man to combat
[17:09] that now don't forget this class don't
[17:11] forget it remember all the days of your
[17:13] life these beasts are correct it's thus
[17:16] saith the Lord hallelujah so it's so
[17:18] important to remember the day you live
[17:19] in you're impacted by the anointing God
[17:22] has given out
[17:24] so we can't live off a lion anointing we
[17:26] can't live off the The Man anointing or
[17:28] the ox anointing we've got to live off
[17:30] the eagle anointing praise God Amen
[17:32] we've got to live up in Heavenly places
[17:34] we've got to be Kings and Priests unto
[17:36] God we have to live on that anointing
[17:38] because that's the anointing for our day
[17:40] hallelujah amen amen the prophetic
[17:43] revelation of this hour watching praying
[17:46] that's why we've got to be prayed up we
[17:47] got to constantly talk to God we got got
[17:50] to constantly uh watch things we gotta
[17:52] have to watch the the conditions of the
[17:54] world I said like this we got to watch
[17:56] the conditions of Our Lives as well
[17:57] praise God
[17:59] the Bible says we should examine
[18:01] ourselves make sure that we're in the
[18:03] face hallelujah amen amen that's what
[18:05] we're doing this morning amen now I want
[18:07] to get back to the temple here now
[18:08] here's about the size I showed this was
[18:10] a different one from Wednesday so here's
[18:12] an American football field
[18:14] that's about what it's like 120 yards
[18:16] there now Solomon's Temple was oh about
[18:19] five
[18:21] I mean I'm sorry about 60 of a football
[18:23] field
[18:24] okay so that's pretty big that's a
[18:26] pretty big Temple platform praise God
[18:27] see a football game isn't it something
[18:29] uh football field is a place to worship
[18:31] today isn't that something
[18:33] right of course Heathen worship
[18:36] but real true worship of God that's
[18:37] about what Solomon had about a football
[18:39] field
[18:41] and then Herod came and of course he
[18:43] knocked down his Temple was again about
[18:45] the same size at least the height 60
[18:47] cubits from what I was reading it was at
[18:50] least the same height
[18:51] uh and then saw a Harry come around and
[18:54] make it larger so the women can get in
[18:57] the there's a place for the Gentiles as
[18:59] well
[19:00] so we had we have Harris Temple much
[19:02] larger now in Ezekiel 41 and 42 it lays
[19:06] out an even larger Temple for the
[19:09] Millennium praise God think about that
[19:11] all the saints down through the ages are
[19:14] going to be able to come into that
[19:15] Temple praise God we're going to go work
[19:18] we'll go to worship service with John
[19:20] amen and Pastor I'm sorry and Prophet
[19:22] Paul amen and brother imagine that
[19:25] brother Arnie we walk in here next to
[19:27] brother random and Saint Paul and Joshua
[19:30] and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[19:32] Hallelujah I'm going to church with
[19:34] Abraham today well at least I'm going to
[19:37] church with Abraham C today
[19:39] talk about this day September was it the
[19:42] 10th breaks God we're going to church
[19:44] with Abraham's seed this morning
[19:45] Hallelujah but one day we'll go to
[19:47] church with Abraham and Sarah hallelujah
[19:49] amen and Jesus will be in there
[19:53] Hallelujah Jesus the great son of David
[19:55] he'll be the great king over that Temple
[19:58] hallelujah oh I'm so glad we can come in
[20:01] we can come in all these different ways
[20:03] or different three different gates to
[20:04] get in this place Hallelujah
[20:07] and the Bible lays it out the size of it
[20:09] praise God and so we can imagine so how
[20:11] many football fields will fit in here
[20:13] think about that how many football
[20:14] players one two three maybe six or seven
[20:16] football fields and all the saints down
[20:19] Through the Ages oh my cerebruma will be
[20:21] there Hallelujah Daniel will be there
[20:24] all the saints will be there praise God
[20:27] oh I wouldn't want to stand by The
[20:28] Heroes of Faith one day amen well then
[20:31] let's be a hero today let's say it on
[20:32] the word of God today Hallelujah and our
[20:35] humble and our humble calling in life
[20:36] let us be a hero for Christ Hallelujah
[20:38] if others won't stand for the truth you
[20:41] and I will stand for the truth praise
[20:42] God now I found this one this morning
[20:44] again it's just a different visual of
[20:46] ezekiel's uh Temple of Ezekiel 41 and 42
[20:49] maybe we'll preach on that next we'll
[20:51] kind of see how the Lord guides but
[20:52] again you see the three entrances
[20:55] you got your inner court now I like here
[20:56] it's starting to get closer to this last
[20:58] chapter of the Bible the River of Life
[21:00] flows right through this uh right
[21:02] through this Temple I like that praise
[21:04] God there's got to be a water source
[21:06] amen kind of reminds me of the Waterway
[21:08] the waterways water baptism hallelujah
[21:11] amen the way into Christ is through the
[21:13] name of Jesus Christ not father son Holy
[21:16] Ghost it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:19] Christ
[21:19] and there's one River of Life there's
[21:22] one way to Salvation there's one Lord
[21:24] One Faith one baptism hallelujah amen
[21:29] and we have the altar there as well the
[21:31] altar outer core holy Place holiest of
[21:34] holies
[21:35] now imagine which which of us spiritual
[21:37] Kings and Priests get to go into the
[21:39] holiest I wonder for the Millennium or
[21:41] is it just Jesus that gets to go in
[21:43] there what a thought my goodness
[21:45] but this is the size this is says six
[21:48] football fields can fit in there
[21:50] Hallelujah and this is the temple this
[21:52] is uh this is uh this will be the uh the
[21:56] headquarters of all Earth worship during
[21:58] the millennium
[21:59] so for a thousand years the Bible said
[22:01] they'll come up and the Nations will
[22:03] flow into this house amen oh my God
[22:06] Nations all the nations and the Bible
[22:09] said some of us will rule over 10
[22:11] Nations
[22:12] or ten cities Hallelujah will rule over
[22:15] them with the wrath of Ira in the Bible
[22:17] says at some point it'll be their time
[22:19] it's our time to go up to the house of
[22:22] God it's our turn to worship it's our
[22:24] turn to go sacrifice hallelujah amen
[22:27] amen it's our turn to go see Jesus amen
[22:31] ah no Nations will obey the word of God
[22:35] Hallelujah the Bible said a man won't
[22:37] need to teach his neighbor because the
[22:39] Bible said God will reveal that truth
[22:41] that that truth will already be in him
[22:43] Hallelujah
[22:44] because he's got a new body we've got to
[22:46] glorified bodies Hallelujah and the
[22:48] truth will be in us hallelujah amen and
[22:50] we'll still go up and worship our Lord
[22:52] Jesus Christ amen Amen in this
[22:54] Millennial Temple Hallelujah
[22:56] imagine that all the tribes of Israel be
[22:58] there remember those tribes I showed you
[23:00] all the tribes will flow into there as
[23:02] well praise God
[23:03] I say God likes families
[23:07] God loves a family of of ephraiman and
[23:10] you know eventually put Dan and Eve from
[23:12] back in is because he's so merciful
[23:13] praise God
[23:15] loves all the tribes Hallelujah and each
[23:18] one gets a turn to come in and worship
[23:20] their creator oh and we can say that's
[23:22] what I was born to do that's my whole
[23:24] purpose for being here is to worship my
[23:26] Creator praise God I was born to worship
[23:29] Jesus amen amen that's what I'm here for
[23:32] praise God to worship our Lord Jesus
[23:34] Christ
[23:36] now think about that that Millennial
[23:37] temple one side is 750 feet wide
[23:43] so let me go back there so this is 750
[23:46] feet that's about 14 of one mile
[23:50] that's really small right
[23:53] no
[23:54] but the lab but our our future home
[23:57] though is going to be 1500 miles wide
[24:02] or 7 million 920
[24:05] 000 feet wide that's just how wide it is
[24:07] almost 8 million feet wide
[24:10] so there's no comparison this is just a
[24:13] tiny tiny little Temple for a thousand
[24:15] years
[24:16] until we go to our future home
[24:19] Hallelujah
[24:21] amen snuff this is small compared
[24:26] [Music]
[24:28] power and God's love and his Mercy it's
[24:30] just going to get greater as time goes
[24:32] on Hallelujah
[24:34] think about that we'll be happy with
[24:35] that for a thousand years we'll rejoice
[24:37] in this for a thousand years but God
[24:38] says I got something better for all
[24:40] eternity hallelujah amen eight million
[24:43] feet on just one side of this holy city
[24:46] praise God Amen amen and there's a
[24:49] picture uh like brother man said brother
[24:51] Adam said he studied Larkin
[24:53] and he said
[24:55] 1500 miles he said is from Florida to
[25:00] Maine
[25:01] that's one that's just one side
[25:04] of this Holy City
[25:07] that's just one one on the side there's
[25:09] four sides not just one side that's how
[25:11] great the side is remember there's uh
[25:14] there's three gates on each side
[25:16] right because there's four uh three
[25:18] times four is twelve
[25:20] and each gate is named after one of the
[25:22] 12 tribes of Israel one of those men
[25:24] they were predestined talk about
[25:26] predestination
[25:27] talk about God for knowing your name
[25:29] before the foundation of the world
[25:32] Simeon God spoke Simeon and that name is
[25:35] gonna be on the game praise God
[25:37] Hallelujah
[25:39] such an important name all these names
[25:41] Dan oh my so important God had to have
[25:44] the right name it's all speaking of
[25:46] God's mercy and Grace hallelujah oh my
[25:49] God
[25:50] that's how big this one is but remember
[25:52] the the the millennial one is about 14
[25:55] of one mile
[25:57] yeah this one is 1500 square miles
[26:01] so when it comes down when when our
[26:04] final destination comes down this is
[26:06] what it's going to look like on the
[26:07] earth it's a pyramid
[26:10] and so the Bible said it's going to come
[26:12] down like a bride adorned for its
[26:15] husband praise God Amen so the the Earth
[26:17] is locking unto a a bride now remember
[26:20] there'll be no more seats this picture
[26:21] isn't exactly accurate you know there's
[26:23] there might there might be lakes and
[26:25] rivers but there'll be no more sea in
[26:26] the future home there'll be no great
[26:28] seas God's gonna need some room on there
[26:30] for his his people praise God it's a
[26:32] rule and Reign amen
[26:35] but that's what the Bible says we'll see
[26:36] at the end of the Millennium there after
[26:38] the white Throne judgment we'll see uh
[26:41] we'll see our future home coming down
[26:42] like a bride adorned for its groom
[26:45] like we all watch Lena come into the
[26:47] service there man at the wedding a
[26:49] couple weeks ago that's what it was like
[26:51] we're all gonna stand there and watch
[26:52] our Heavenly City come down and say
[26:54] hallelujah that's my home amen that's
[26:57] where I was spreading my eternity with
[26:58] Jesus Hallelujah
[27:01] it comes down like that
[27:04] now that's about the right location
[27:05] brother said he thought the very center
[27:07] of it would be right about where Israel
[27:09] is right now
[27:11] so that's the placing of our future home
[27:14] so I might be far from it right now but
[27:16] but that day I'll be right in it by
[27:18] God's grace amen hallelujah God's gonna
[27:21] make sure that there's a mansion like
[27:23] the Bible said I go to prepare a mansion
[27:25] for you praise God yes I go to prepare a
[27:27] place for you so that where I am you can
[27:30] be also Hallelujah
[27:31] I know there's one at least one room in
[27:33] there for me Hallelujah and my family
[27:35] amen hallelujah there's got to be at
[27:38] least one place in there that's got
[27:40] Jesse and Kristen Smith written on it by
[27:42] God's grace and that's got your name on
[27:47] Hallelujah
[27:51] it's all as well
[27:53] 1500 miles tall Hallelujah
[27:57] that's eight million feet high
[27:59] Hallelujah
[28:00] that's pretty high
[28:02] plenty of room for God's people
[28:03] hallelujah
[28:06] and I love Larkin's picture this is the
[28:08] picture Clarence Larkin Drew brother
[28:09] random uh like Clarence Larkin he think
[28:11] Clarence Larkin for a lot of his works
[28:13] so here we see uh I think that's Gad
[28:16] Reuben and Sybian
[28:18] and then oh yeah and then the apostles
[28:19] have their name in the foundation John
[28:21] James Peter
[28:23] I love this picture because it's got all
[28:24] these castles all these homes and just
[28:26] one of those is mine one of those is
[28:29] yours Spirit Hallelujah that's what
[28:31] we're living for we're living for here
[28:33] not to build up our our property here
[28:35] we're living to make sure we got a
[28:37] property there Hallelujah
[28:39] that's the real estate I'm investing in
[28:43] you got real estate Investments God
[28:45] bless you but this is the best real
[28:47] estate investment you can possibly make
[28:49] Hallelujah and how do you invest repent
[28:51] and believe God's word hallelujah amen
[28:54] amen
[28:57] State investment I'm doing
[29:01] one job and ask one time when you can do
[29:03] some real estate investing well maybe
[29:04] after I get the house paid off or
[29:05] something like that but I should have
[29:07] said I'm already doing real estate
[29:08] investment
[29:10] I already got life assurance
[29:15] [Applause]
[29:16] eternal life Assurance as brother random
[29:18] said amen hallelujah
[29:21] as long as I get out of the Grave that's
[29:23] the most important thing
[29:26] defy the grave as well
[29:29] because the living Saints will be
[29:30] translated in the moment and the
[29:32] twinkling of the eye praise God
[29:35] hey man look at that River just see just
[29:36] like the Millennials there's that river
[29:38] flowing up
[29:39] to the throne of God there it is again
[29:41] God likes that one River
[29:44] something about there's one water
[29:45] there's one way there's one water
[29:47] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:49] hallelujah amen there's one way
[29:53] now if around southern city must be a
[29:55] pyramid he said he said now the walls
[29:59] and the foundation were equal that
[30:01] doesn't necessarily mean that's a cube
[30:02] or a square there's another geographical
[30:05] measure the dimensions are the same that
[30:07] is a pyramid Four Square line four
[30:09] square and the walls were the same
[30:11] the number then draws it we're going to
[30:14] get into something and sure as the world
[30:15] notice the dimensions of this angle is
[30:18] exactly the same all of them there's
[30:19] another measure the pyramid that proves
[30:22] it
[30:22] so if you go and look online most people
[30:25] think of the future home looks like this
[30:28] all right my brother said it can't be
[30:29] that and of course Larkin agreed it's
[30:31] got to be the pyramid
[30:33] and the reason was because he says see
[30:35] now you have got the city it's a holy
[30:38] mountain
[30:39] he said not a holy Cube he said a holy
[30:42] mountain
[30:43] s
[30:44] that help you
[30:46] nothing shall hurt or destroy in Isaiah
[30:48] as it says in all my holy mountains
[30:50] saith the Lord It's not a cube it's a
[30:53] mountain
[30:54] and the whip by the breath by the height
[30:56] they're equal 1500 miles this way man
[30:59] eight million miles
[31:01] Hallelujah I'm sorry 8 million feet
[31:03] rather eight million feet
[31:05] 1500 miles this way 1500 miles that way
[31:08] 1500 miles all the way around 1500 miles
[31:10] high so it's a great Mountain like a
[31:13] pyramid and the city is on the mountain
[31:17] the rest of the throne the throne cannot
[31:20] be seen if the walls are straight up and
[31:22] down like a cube so it has to be a
[31:25] pyramid
[31:25] [Music]
[31:27] who is everybody going to want to see
[31:29] who has eternal life who's the one
[31:32] person we want to see Jesus
[31:35] if he's at the top of a cube and he's
[31:37] only on one side of the cube only one
[31:39] group's gonna see him but Jesus wants to
[31:41] be seen by all his people praise God
[31:43] Amen he wants to be seen he doesn't want
[31:46] to be hidden yeah yeah Hallelujah right
[31:49] now he's hidden right and he reveals
[31:51] himself to those who are babes that
[31:53] would love to learn the gospel
[31:54] hallelujah amen he hides himself from
[31:56] the wash and prune it and he reveals
[31:58] himself a debate such as we learned
[32:00] Hallelujah
[32:01] if these walls were straight up and down
[32:03] the city could only be seen from the
[32:04] outside
[32:05] or from the inside the throne can only
[32:07] be seen from the inside
[32:10] Hallelujah so it can be a cube because
[32:12] then nobody can see the Throne of God
[32:15] right yes
[32:16] and brother Adam said the Pyramid of
[32:18] Giza in Egypt which we believe Enoch
[32:21] built is a witness of the pyramid-shaped
[32:23] new city that is to come to the Earth
[32:25] even its location because look how close
[32:28] it is to Israel look how close Egypt's
[32:31] so close to Israel
[32:33] well the ram said this being this way
[32:35] would answer exactly Enoch sign in Egypt
[32:38] remember the Bible said it would it
[32:40] would be a sign
[32:41] I don't have the scripture but it's in
[32:42] that it's in that servant I preached he
[32:45] said would it Enoch before the antelope
[32:47] and destruction when justification was
[32:49] coming in he brought forth a sign and
[32:51] this pyramid is seven steps going to the
[32:52] king's chamber watch on that seventh
[32:55] step if you ever studied the dimensions
[32:56] of the pyramid what comes out to take
[32:58] the oncomer to introduce to the king
[33:01] watch those stations that is standing
[33:03] there and you'll see the day you're
[33:04] living in in the pyramid so seven steps
[33:07] seven Church ages right
[33:09] now
[33:11] so there's the Pyramid of Giza right
[33:13] south of Cairo there Southwest of Cairo
[33:14] I've never been there anybody been there
[33:16] in here nope okay we're not we're not
[33:19] World Travelers
[33:20] but uh let me just show zoomed in
[33:22] pictures so look here's maybe man my
[33:24] high maybe he's six foot or something
[33:25] like that uh I believe Jason Demars just
[33:27] got back from there look how tall this
[33:29] is
[33:30] look how tall I mean look just look at
[33:32] the layers how many layers not good
[33:35] and then there but there was no Capstone
[33:38] and brother said this is a sign
[33:41] that one day God is going to have a
[33:43] pyramid Hallelujah that's right that
[33:45] God's gonna have a great Mountain a Holy
[33:47] Mountain Hallelujah
[33:49] this is a mountain that defies all
[33:52] scientific machine power
[33:55] all scientific of
[33:57] any exploration or Discovery this
[34:00] mountain defies all that and so will the
[34:02] mounts of the Lord it'll defy all the
[34:04] ways of man hallelujah amen glory praise
[34:07] God
[34:09] and this great mountain is a sign that
[34:12] one day Christ is going to come back
[34:14] because it has no headstone Glory
[34:16] Hallelujah just like cerebral
[34:18] it had no headstone so God has to send
[34:22] the headstone back and speaking of Jesus
[34:24] Christ returning to the church in other
[34:26] words this is a type of the body of
[34:28] Christ
[34:30] now wouldn't you like to see I would
[34:31] like to see this which one of those
[34:33] stones is the Cornerstone
[34:36] which is a
[34:40] [Music]
[34:44] Stone Stones I'm gonna put all them on
[34:47] this Stone
[34:48] I'll tell you that's a good looking
[34:49] Stone that's a perfectly shaped Stone
[34:52] and who is the stone stone Mason that
[34:55] placed that right in place
[34:56] and got the measurement exactly right so
[34:59] this thing doesn't fall over right so
[35:01] the stones don't move out of place and
[35:03] it stood there it withstood the flood
[35:06] it's where it's withstood Wars and
[35:09] storms and all these things it's wasted
[35:12] the test of time and so has God's Church
[35:14] wished us to test the time Hallelujah
[35:17] brought all things on it Roman
[35:19] persecution they brought on Holocaust
[35:22] World War One World War II and now
[35:24] they're bringing on this woke agenda and
[35:26] they're bringing this storms of demons
[35:27] on from every side but this church this
[35:30] Holy Mountain will continue praise God
[35:33] amen this Holy Mountain will receive the
[35:37] headstone Hallelujah it will withstand
[35:40] all the the trials of Lies the cares of
[35:43] this world all the fiery trials it has
[35:46] to because it needs a headstone
[35:47] Hallelujah
[35:50] amen
[35:52] Glory
[35:54] so this is a sign for us
[35:57] this is a sign of the church
[35:59] that we are the body we're the building
[36:01] of Christ as we showed on Sunday let's
[36:03] read that let's go back here to
[36:05] Ephesians 2 I want to read that again I
[36:06] ended it but I was going kind of quick I
[36:08] was trying to finish
[36:10] quickly
[36:11] let's take our time here it's not even
[36:13] 11 30 so got plenty of time
[36:16] Ephesians 2 19.
[36:23] let me just remind you here again let's
[36:25] go to verse 12. just I'm going to lay
[36:26] this in here just to help out all the
[36:28] saints here that at that time he or
[36:30] without Christ so before in the Old
[36:33] Testament Gentiles were without Christ
[36:35] being aliens from the Commonwealth of
[36:37] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[36:39] of Promise having no hope and without
[36:41] God in the world
[36:43] so let's stop right there so before
[36:45] before let's say before this happened
[36:48] you know we had that we had uh we had
[36:50] the Tabernacle of Moses right we have
[36:53] Solomon's Temple and most most Gentiles
[36:56] were kept out of there
[36:58] right and the Bible said we were without
[37:01] Christ imagine that you were without
[37:02] Christ
[37:03] but Christ wanted to include you
[37:07] Christ wanted to build this over 2 000
[37:09] years so I wonder if this might be the
[37:11] first church age second third fourth
[37:14] fifth sixth and there we are right at
[37:15] the top amen oh there's just a few
[37:17] stones at the top
[37:19] it's just a few Believers amen but they
[37:22] are found faithful hallelujah amen amen
[37:26] and so we are without Christ but God had
[37:28] this in his mind I'm going to build a
[37:30] church
[37:31] I'm going to build a dwelling place for
[37:33] my spirit Hallelujah
[37:36] Hallelujah
[37:37] because before you had to be around
[37:38] Moses as Tabernacle and you had to be
[37:40] around Solomon's Temple that's irumables
[37:43] and then Harris Temple you had to be
[37:45] physically around that but God said I'm
[37:47] going to do something greater I'm going
[37:48] to make a universal Temple praise God
[37:51] and the body of Christ no matter where
[37:52] they are whether they're in America or
[37:55] Africa or or Australia or Europe
[37:57] wherever they are they can still be a
[37:59] part of this pyramid Hallelujah
[38:02] it can still be a part of the temple of
[38:04] God hallelujah
[38:10] but now in Christ Jesus you sometimes
[38:14] were far off are made nigh by the blood
[38:17] of Christ don't let anybody tell you
[38:19] that God is far from you
[38:21] the Bible said he he was far from you
[38:25] but because of the Cross now he's close
[38:27] to you
[38:28] I said that to Chris last night brother
[38:30] Chris I said are you I'm inviting you
[38:31] back to church brother but I said let me
[38:34] tell you you are not Jesus Christ
[38:37] draw an eye to Christ Hallelujah and He
[38:40] will draw an eye to you but the blood of
[38:43] Jesus Christ brings us closer to God how
[38:45] many believe in the crucifixion of
[38:46] Christ amen if you believe in that then
[38:49] the Bible said God has drawn has drawn
[38:52] near to you praise God Amen
[38:54] amen don't let the devil say you're far
[38:56] from God you're far from God the Bible
[38:57] says I'm near God hallelujah
[39:00] My Sacrifice Jesus Christ the blood of
[39:02] Jesus Christ has brought me near to his
[39:05] son
[39:07] amen
[39:09] verse 15 he abolished the hatred The
[39:12] Entity between the law and and sinners
[39:15] God abolished that that curse of the law
[39:18] if you're guilty of one law then you're
[39:20] guilty of all 613 right that was a curse
[39:23] God abolished that curse that curse is
[39:25] no more thanks you're blessed hallelujah
[39:28] amen amen you're blessed you're not
[39:30] under the law of 613 laws or can I say
[39:33] this the Amish laws of of their
[39:35] pamphlets right brother we're not under
[39:37] those uh stack of man-made Creeds we're
[39:40] under the blood of Jesus Christ and that
[39:42] blood speaks better things
[39:47] Mercy it speaks
[39:50] the love of God
[39:54] hey
[39:55] the blood of Jesus Christ abolished
[39:57] legalism praise God
[40:00] and then God if he saves us he expects
[40:03] us to love him and then he said if you
[40:05] love me keep my Commandments
[40:07] and that's why we keep God's
[40:10] Commandments because we love him why
[40:11] because he first loved us amen oh
[40:14] nothing more beautiful than the gospel
[40:16] praise God
[40:18] Hallelujah
[40:22] verse 17 and came and preached peace to
[40:25] you which were far off and to them that
[40:27] were nigh that's Gentile and Jew
[40:29] for through him we both have access by
[40:32] one spear unto the father church is so
[40:35] easy for you to contact your heavenly
[40:36] father amen you have access through the
[40:39] blood of Jesus Christ amen So when you
[40:41] say Jesus maybe I'm struggling today or
[40:44] yesterday or whatever I had a tough week
[40:46] you said God forgive me my sins I'm

[43:48] backing of that insurance praise God

[44:02] I mean I closed my Bible and I lost my
[44:05] spot here or something
[44:07] I didn't say
[44:09] Ephesians 2
[44:15] what a foundation we got verse 21 in
[44:17] whom all the building
[44:18] fitly framed together growth unto a holy
[44:22] Temple of the Lord
[44:25] the Sea church where fitly
[44:27] frame to God doesn't look like every
[44:29] stone was placed in the right position
[44:32] don't you know you're in the right
[44:33] position you're right where God wants
[44:35] you yes now if you have a sin to
[44:38] confession yeah you might be out of
[44:39] position but confess that sin and then
[44:41] you're right back in God's position for
[44:43] you amen
[44:44] I don't gotta worry you know did God
[44:46] know I was going to be born in uh
[44:48] Northwest Ohio did God know I was going
[44:50] to live my whole life in Ohio absolutely
[44:52] God knew where every one of those stones
[44:54] is going to be yes
[44:55] Hallelujah and if that was made anything
[44:58] like Solomon's uh Temple they they took
[45:01] all those stones from all around the
[45:04] world and they were shipped there they
[45:05] were by ships and by sailing or by cars
[45:08] and they took all these stones from
[45:09] around the world and gathered them and
[45:12] build up this house of God God sent you
[45:14] here hallelujah God sent you to hear the
[45:16] word God sent you to love God's people
[45:18] you're right in position praise God God
[45:20] knew every one of those thumbs and God
[45:22] knew every one of your footsteps
[45:23] Hallelujah
[45:25] amen the stone let's say on that level
[45:27] it couldn't be for that level it's got
[45:29] to be for that level you couldn't have
[45:31] been born in Jesus day you could have
[45:33] been born in Martin Luther's day you had
[45:35] to be born in this day hallelujah amen
[45:37] your place exactly where God wanted you
[45:39] praise God in other words God knew you
[45:42] would overcome the laodicean conditions
[45:44] amen the world says I'm rich and
[45:47] increase with Goods have need of nothing
[45:49] so that's what the enemy says but God
[45:51] knew you'd you'd want spiritual riches
[45:54] and you would you want the eyes out of
[45:56] God you want the Raven of righteousness
[45:58] Hallelujah and you want to be on fire
[46:00] god knew that you'd want more of God
[46:02] hallelujah
[46:04] that's why God placed you as a stone
[46:06] right at the top Hallelujah
[46:10] now if I had my choice I might have
[46:12] lived in the days of Jesus I don't know
[46:14] I don't know
[46:15] I would have been powerful
[46:17] or maybe Saint Paul follow him around
[46:21] but God knew God had better ideas
[46:26] if I'd had my choice I would have chose
[46:28] the end time and look he was at the end
[46:30] time but not the very end
[46:32] see even that brother didn't live to see
[46:34] the Rapture without dying right
[46:38] so we don't always get what we always
[46:39] want right so we got to be humble how
[46:42] many want to be humble by God
[46:44] I'm just glad to be in this Holy Holy
[46:48] Temple praise God Amen I'm just glad to
[46:50] be framed into this house of God this
[46:53] house of worship
[46:54] verse 22 that's what that that's what
[46:56] this is that's why I'm reading this
[46:57] verse 22 last verse
[46:59] in whom he also are building together
[47:00] for inhabitation of God through the Holy
[47:03] Spirit
[47:04] like I was closing on Wednesday night I
[47:07] said we come to church and this is the
[47:08] house of God and these walls are just
[47:10] they're just here you think oh they're
[47:12] just light blue and you know that's nice
[47:14] thank God especially when when it when
[47:17] it rains or snows or hails I'm glad we
[47:19] got a building praise God but you know
[47:21] the building really doesn't do a whole
[47:22] lot for the service it's different with
[47:25] God's Temple and you're God's Temple
[47:28] the Bible said you are a habitation of
[47:32] God through the spirit amen amen in
[47:34] other words then the Bible says you're
[47:36] not just a stone you're a Lively Stone
[47:38] praise God
[47:40] so in the body of Christ each one of us
[47:42] are stoned and but each one of us are
[47:45] not dead each one of us are stopped
[47:47] standing there we're just not sitting
[47:48] there we are praising God Hallelujah the
[47:52] holy spirit is flowing through US
[47:53] imagine this is a this is a well imagine
[47:56] if each one of those stones could shout
[47:57] and praise God
[47:59] right one time Jesus said if they don't
[48:02] shout these stones are going to cry out
[48:03] that's right one time he said that
[48:05] praise God but in the spiritual this is
[48:07] the New Testament Church the New
[48:08] Testament Church everyone is a stone and
[48:11] every stone has a testimony amen every
[48:14] stone knows or praise God amen amen
[48:16] every stone loves to inhabit God don't
[48:18] you love having God inside of you praise
[48:21] God who says this aren't you glad that
[48:23] the spirit of God keeps you from living
[48:25] a sinful life
[48:31] so that the spirit of God can live
[48:33] inside
[48:36] [Applause]
[48:38] I'm glad Devils don't live in my life
[48:40] I'm glad the Holy Spirit cleans out my
[48:43] life amen amen that's what I want to be
[48:45] I want to be a place where God can live
[48:47] hallelujah amen thank God
[48:51] that's exactly what Paul says
[48:54] and Paul said every man will be judged
[48:56] by that
[48:57] right he said my gospel will judge every
[49:00] every secret of every man's heart on the
[49:02] day of judgment
[49:06] God to say you confess all your your
[49:09] secret thoughts you confess all your
[49:11] sins you are a habitation of God through
[49:13] the spirit yes when you preach the
[49:15] people felt the spirit of God
[49:17] my brother amen sang we felt the spirit
[49:19] of God
[49:20] right in other words you you know when
[49:22] Harley testified we stopped we felt the
[49:25] spirit of God Amen when Levi testified
[49:27] and built that church we felt the spirit
[49:29] of God amen amen
[49:32] pray the spirit of God will anoint that
[49:34] place Hallelujah
[49:35] to be finished
[49:37] this is what we're meant to be we're
[49:39] meant to be places that inhabit the
[49:41] spirit of God people can see God living
[49:43] in US
[49:45] amen now that's again where it'll be if
[49:48] you look at the Grand scale that that's
[49:50] again where that holy city where our
[49:52] future home is going to be right in that
[49:54] location
[49:56] now I found this
[49:59] the wall of Jerusalem is just about
[50:01] 200 or I'm sorry 20 stories tall so this
[50:04] Bank in Richmond Virginia is about 19
[50:06] stories tall so you can see like here's
[50:08] a fence you know
[50:10] now that wall is going to have
[50:12] foundations right and then there's going
[50:14] to be three gates but that wall is going
[50:16] to be almost 8 million
[50:18] feet long just one side of it that's a
[50:21] lot of rock that's a lot of stone
[50:25] and there's four of those walls there's
[50:27] four sides that are eight million feet
[50:30] plus 20 stories tall and the bibles are
[50:34] the gems will be all placed in that
[50:36] Foundation
[50:37] the beauty Hallelujah don't you know the
[50:39] man said you're a gem in somebody's
[50:41] Crown praise God

[50:47] gems will remind us of all the victories
[50:49] all the testimonies praise God
[50:51] all that God did see God God dug you out
[50:55] of the Maori clay God dug you out of the
[50:57] earth and he found this gem but he had
[50:58] to he had to smooth it off praise God he
[51:01] had to cut that diamond hey man yeah
[51:03] things out of your life amen and all
[51:07] those gems and diamonds speak of the
[51:09] glory of Christ in your life Hallelujah
[51:12] you and I will get to walk into that
[51:14] City praise God
[51:16] and by God's grace if the Bible's right
[51:18] then we are the royalty of that City if
[51:20] the Bible's right
[51:22] because the Bible said you're a peculiar
[51:24] people you're a holy priesthood
[51:28] you're just we're not I we went to uh
[51:31] we went to that core life restaurant on
[51:33] Friday and their shirt says not a
[51:35] spectator I thought that's exactly what
[51:37] we're going to be that's what we're
[51:38] going to wear in heaven I'm not a
[51:40] spectator that's looking around look at
[51:42] all these people praise God I'm going to
[51:44] be doing the praise and amen

[51:58] [Applause]
[52:02] of God
[52:04] [Applause]
[52:10] all the gems can be the spectators right
[52:13] but I don't want to be a spectator I
[52:15] want to be a priest in that City
[52:18] a royal priesthood the Bible says
[52:21] amen hallelujah
[52:22] now I want to this one I read on uh
[52:24] Wednesday so I added that in the
[52:26] beginning there
[52:29] I'm just going to skip ahead in the
[52:30] first year of Cyrus King of Persia he
[52:32] led the first band of the Jews back to
[52:34] Jerusalem this is zerubim
[52:37] I believe there'll be a great reward for
[52:39] that
[52:40] there's I I forget the number I think it
[52:42] was hundreds of thousands of Jews were
[52:44] afraid and didn't leave Babylon they got
[52:47] comfortable in Babylon
[52:50] they got comfortable in laodicea
[52:53] and they wouldn't go back to the
[52:55] promised land and brother Adam said the
[52:56] promised land is the baptism of the Holy
[52:58] Ghost
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:08] if you want to be a part of the kingdom
[53:10] of God you must be born again praise God
[53:14] Google will tax one of those up won the
[53:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God
[53:19] ah it's beautiful praise God
[53:24] so in the first year he brought those
[53:25] people back they got established in the
[53:28] second year though he built the Altar
[53:30] and laid the foundation of the temple on
[53:34] the ruins of that which had been
[53:35] destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar
[53:38] all right so we'll show a picture of
[53:39] this in just a moment here and remember
[53:40] he was up the sea line of David that's a
[53:42] beautiful type there
[53:44] Christ came out of the seed line of
[53:45] David Hallelujah
[53:47] beautiful type
[53:49] now remember church this was fulfilling
[53:51] prophecies when he came back
[53:53] the Bible said thus saith the Lord after
[53:54] seven years we accomplished at Babylon
[53:56] I'll visit you and perform my good word
[53:58] to you and causing you to return this
[54:00] place
[54:02] for I know the thoughts I think toward
[54:03] you saith the Lord thoughts of Peace not
[54:05] of evil to give you an expected end what
[54:07] was their end their end was to leave
[54:10] Babylon and get back to the holy city
[54:13] that was their end and the church what
[54:16] is the end for you to be born again and
[54:18] be a fruitful Christian praise God Amen
[54:21] to have a good ground that brings forth
[54:23] much fruit praise God Amen that's your
[54:26] expected end praise God Amen
[54:28] now if you got anything other than that
[54:30] let's just cherry on top right that's
[54:32] just some other extra blessing but the
[54:34] main thing is be born again and that the
[54:37] fruit of the Holy Spirit flow out of
[54:39] your life praise God
[54:40] only four grounds Jesus said and the
[54:42] most fruitful was the one that glorified
[54:44] him amen it overcame the cares of the
[54:47] world and Jesus said that's a good and
[54:49] honest heart that's what we need the
[54:51] message Honest Hearts yes amen not Liars
[54:54] Honest Hearts amen that's what we need
[54:57] the message today
[55:00] he said then you should call upon me and
[55:03] then didn't they call upon him
[55:04] right
[55:05] and he shall go and pray unto me I will
[55:08] hearken unto you this is speaking of his
[55:10] room
[55:11] will came back he's the first one right
[55:14] that led this charge of 42 000 imagine a
[55:17] church of forty two thousand huh that'd
[55:19] be a real church right there I'll tell
[55:21] you that you need some deacons over
[55:22] thousands of that I need about 42
[55:25] deacons oh a thousand per Deacon they
[55:27] can take care of the Saints there but
[55:29] this was fulfilled prophet
[55:37] I'm following the message of the hour
[55:39] amen amen the spirit of God is calling
[55:43] us back God has given us favor and we've
[55:45] got to rebuild the house of God that's
[55:47] all he did he just followed the message
[55:49] of the hour that's all we got to do
[55:51] praise God just do what the Bible says
[55:53] follow the message of the hour praise
[55:55] God let the word of God be written on
[55:57] the fleshy tables of your heart
[56:01] it's so simple you just have to see what
[56:04] is God doing is God doing anything in
[56:06] the Pentecostal church is God doing
[56:08] anything in the Amish Church
[56:10] is God doing anything in the Christian
[56:12] marriage Missionary Alliance Church or
[56:14] how about the Roman Catholic Church
[56:15] God's not doing nothing in them God has
[56:17] begged them to come out but you are the
[56:19] ones who heard the voice you're the ones
[56:21] that obey you're the ones that come out
[56:23] of her my people that should be not
[56:25] partakers of our sins and plagues so you
[56:27] are the Blessed hallelujah amen
[56:30] I know I was raising the domination I
[56:32] was Raising Pentecostal Church Assembly
[56:34] of God now when I was younger it felt
[56:37] like Revival
[56:39] but as I got older and I left I saw it
[56:41] go downhill and now downhill just about
[56:43] as down as you can go it's about as low
[56:44] as you can go
[56:47] it's all about just speaking in tongues
[56:48] speaking in tongues and if you don't
[56:50] speak in tongues you didn't have church
[56:53] well the fact is they never had Church
[56:54] to begin with praise God
[56:57] because you got to get the sin out
[56:58] before you can have church
[57:00] what does Church mean called out ones
[57:03] and so these people that speak in
[57:04] tongues they don't get called out of
[57:06] their sinful lives
[57:08] they continue to live in sin so they
[57:10] never even get called out they can't
[57:12] have church they can't be the called out
[57:13] ones if they don't get sin out of their
[57:15] lives right
[57:16] the church that's what I found this
[57:18] ministry a brother around to be it's a
[57:20] Ministry that calls us out of sin into
[57:22] obedience to the Bible
[57:24] amen hallelujah praise God
[57:28] I'll tell you you know and you know too
[57:29] I was raised in nomination it had been a
[57:32] lot easier to stay in the nomination
[57:34] because you can just go with the flow
[57:36] you can divorce and remarry as much as
[57:38] you want you can run out your money if
[57:40] you want it's a lot easier to stay in
[57:42] there
[57:43] it's the hard thing is to come to God
[57:45] the hard thing is is service after
[57:47] service to be cut by the the Diamond of
[57:49] the word as we said earlier it's harder
[57:53] you gotta live a whole new life
[57:55] you can't sit there and be complacent
[57:57] right
[57:58] right you know Christ is coming you got
[58:00] to make yourself ready praise God
[58:03] most people in denomination are making
[58:04] themselves ready to live uh the best
[58:06] retirement life they can live
[58:09] that's what they're they're living to
[58:10] retire that's what they're living for
[58:13] they want to go sit on the beach every
[58:15] day and drink uh is it pina coladas I
[58:17] don't know some some alcohol they want
[58:19] to sit on the beach sun tan and drink
[58:21] alcohol that's what they think
[58:22] retirement is
[58:24] Mercy retirement for me or retirement
[58:27] for any Christian uh should be retiring
[58:29] from sin praise God
[58:31] Amen I'm gonna retire from sinning
[58:34] praise God Amen you're not a living
[58:37] Holiness I want to be what Jesus called
[58:39] me to be I want to be in the service of
[58:41] the Lord praise God
[58:43] hmm
[58:44] amen or to retire from my sinful
[58:47] thoughts my sinful behaviors amen that's
[58:49] what I would retire from praise God
[58:54] so see he had to catch the Fulfillment
[58:56] he had to fulfill the prophecy of that
[58:58] hour
[58:59] and the prophecy for our hour is Elijah
[59:02] shall restore all things all the Bible
[59:04] is being restored how many believe that
[59:06] yeah
[59:07] the Bible is being restored in our lives
[59:11] not the book itself we've got the best
[59:13] Bible the King James Bible but it's we
[59:15] have to live the lives of the Apostles
[59:17] right
[59:18] that's got to be restored in our life
[59:21] amen and so brother Levi's doing the
[59:23] right thing if he feels that if God call
[59:25] the church to be there then God will
[59:27] ordain a pastor over that church
[59:29] because Paul said I'll ordain Elders in
[59:31] every city
[59:33] that's right Hallelujah
[59:35] that's that's the gospel

[1:01:00] also fulfills another prophecy the 70
[1:01:04] weeks of Daniel we'll just read verse
[1:01:05] 25. know therefore to understand that
[1:01:07] from the going forth of the Commandment
[1:01:09] to restore and to build Jerusalem unto
[1:01:11] the Messiah the prince shall be seven
[1:01:13] weeks and three score and two weeks the
[1:01:16] street shall be built again and the wall
[1:01:18] even in trouble as times
[1:01:21] zero could say I'm fulfilling Jeremiah's
[1:01:24] word
[1:01:25] unfulfilling Daniel's word
[1:01:28] and church we can say we're fulfilling
[1:01:30] Malachi's word
[1:01:32] because he said Elijah shall turn our
[1:01:34] hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:38] amen is your heart more in love with the
[1:01:40] book of Acts it should be
[1:01:42] that's what programs Ministry was to do
[1:01:44] to bring your heart back to the
[1:01:47] condition of the apostolic fathers
[1:01:49] Hallelujah
[1:01:51] that's what it's for
[1:01:52] we're fulfilling Malachi's prophecy
[1:01:54] Jesus said in Matthew 17 Elijah restore
[1:01:57] all things so we're fulfilling the
[1:01:59] prophecy of Christ
[1:02:04] all right so Cyrus issued this order to
[1:02:06] rebuild in 445 BC it was finished 49
[1:02:10] years later by Nehemiah in 369. so that
[1:02:13] chart says 5 15. I don't know where they
[1:02:16] got that number that number's way off
[1:02:17] this number
[1:02:19] but that was cerebral Ezra Nehemiah
[1:02:22] fulfilling the first seven weeks of
[1:02:25] Daniel's 70th week
[1:02:28] Hallelujah
[1:02:31] could say this day this scripture is
[1:02:34] fulfilled
[1:02:35] just like Jesus could say this day this
[1:02:39] scriptures will fail praise God
[1:02:41] and church we gotta get to the spot
[1:02:43] where we can look at Acts chapter 2 and
[1:02:44] say this day this scripture is being
[1:02:46] fulfilled Hallelujah I restore say
[1:02:49] through all the years the denomination
[1:02:51] of worms ate up God has restored the
[1:02:54] real life of God back we got the
[1:02:56] anointing of the ego the anoint you the
[1:02:57] Holy Ghost this day this scripture is
[1:03:00] fulfilled Hallelujah
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:07] must have been 2012. I was preaching on
[1:03:10] this thought and a sister uh
[1:03:13] what's his name brother Rachel
[1:03:16] I can't remember his name
[1:03:18] a brother from that area
[1:03:20] his I was preaching on this and saying
[1:03:22] one of these days we'll say this day the
[1:03:23] scripture is fulfilled it'll be the book
[1:03:25] of Acts and his young daughter started
[1:03:27] speaking in tongues right there and it
[1:03:28] just went up in a row I said this day
[1:03:30] this scripture is fulfilled amen
[1:03:33] hallelujah in other words I say that
[1:03:35] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:03:37] amen I'm a part of the book of Acts
[1:03:40] Church it wasn't all roses and miracles
[1:03:42] for the book of Acts Church
[1:03:44] sometimes they're they're upset how come
[1:03:46] we're not giving these poor widows their
[1:03:48] food
[1:03:49] right other times it's like John John
[1:03:51] Barnes uh I'm sorry no Palms I'm not
[1:03:54] traveling with you I don't like that guy
[1:03:55] you're going with I don't trust that
[1:03:56] brother well fine you go your way I'll
[1:03:58] go my way
[1:04:00] of course but God bless you you know
[1:04:01] right
[1:04:04] other times it's like are these Gentiles
[1:04:06] really or not we got to have a
[1:04:07] conference we got to talk this thing out
[1:04:09] let's all go to Jerusalem Paul Barnabas
[1:04:11] let's go up there Peter let's go have a
[1:04:13] conference and figure this thing out
[1:04:15] are the Seven Seals open or are they not
[1:04:18] have the seven Thunders been revealed or
[1:04:19] not right we need some conferences
[1:04:22] praise God
[1:04:23] Hallelujah
[1:04:26] now remember those first seven weeks
[1:04:28] that was removable zerubo fulfilled that
[1:04:30] blue area that was 49 years
[1:04:33] and then it was 62 weeks until Jesus
[1:04:36] came on the scene his ministry started
[1:04:39] I'm sorry until Jesus died sorry
[1:04:42] that was this uh 69th week I'm sorry I
[1:04:45] still got the wrong thing on there and
[1:04:46] then God took a break after the 69th
[1:04:48] week and he insert the seven Church ages
[1:04:51] here's where he started building that
[1:04:52] Holy Mountain I was showing you praise
[1:04:54] God all right this is where I started
[1:04:56] again the the blood in Israel to build
[1:04:59] this Holy Mountain I should have put
[1:05:00] that mountain in there maybe next time
[1:05:01] I'll do that
[1:05:03] and then that last 70th week I don't
[1:05:05] believe that anymore I believe it's a
[1:05:06] full week but I'll skip past that
[1:05:08] now to give you a little bit of a
[1:05:10] background this is pretty intense here
[1:05:11] but just bear with me this is a timeline
[1:05:13] from about 1000 BC
[1:05:17] up until zervable right here
[1:05:21] think about this
[1:05:23] here's the profits to Northern Israel
[1:05:25] here's the pro there's the Kings of
[1:05:27] Israel
[1:05:29] uh the northern Kings these were all
[1:05:30] evil Kings here's the kings of Judah the
[1:05:32] southern part and look look how much
[1:05:34] Mercy Church I always love this
[1:05:36] here's 20 40 60 80 100 Years of Mercy
[1:05:41] because they tried to serve God
[1:05:45] they got a hundred years of Grace
[1:05:48] all because they didn't let Idols build
[1:05:51] up in their lives
[1:05:52] now may God help us not to build up
[1:05:54] Idols in our lives so we'll have Grace
[1:05:57] until either we go home in the Rapture
[1:05:59] or we go to the Grave
[1:06:00] whatever God's allowed us
[1:06:03] I think it's a beautiful image of that
[1:06:05] don't you
[1:06:06] and then God said of course prophets to
[1:06:08] Judah
[1:06:09] and these are the kings of Aram Damascus
[1:06:11] Syria we don't need to worry about that
[1:06:12] but anyways
[1:06:15] where was it here's yeah here's ruble
[1:06:18] so Israel the last king was zedekiah and
[1:06:21] they destroyed the temple right here
[1:06:23] all this time took place
[1:06:25] and then zero comes back right here
[1:06:28] he leads the return and he builds the
[1:06:31] Altar and the foundation
[1:06:33] and then they finish the house and then
[1:06:35] Ezra comes and teaches the people that
[1:06:37] Nehemiah builds the wall
[1:06:39] that's is that a helpful timeline
[1:06:41] now you have to say that for about an
[1:06:42] hour then you'd have a good
[1:06:43] understanding of that too I just wanted
[1:06:45] you to see it over the time I look at
[1:06:46] that timeline
[1:06:50] oh
[1:06:51] all Israel was dispersed to Babylon now
[1:06:52] they left a few poor people there
[1:06:53] remember
[1:06:55] and remember Turbo's Temple was much
[1:06:57] less Grand in decoration than Solomon's
[1:07:00] and it caused some people it caused the
[1:07:02] old-timers some sadness
[1:07:04] so again here's Solomon simple about the
[1:07:06] size Hera did about this size he did a
[1:07:09] lot bigger
[1:07:10] now I like this artist's idea this is
[1:07:12] what one artist thought was through
[1:07:14] bubble's uh Temple now look it's a lot
[1:07:17] smaller it's smaller than uh salma's and
[1:07:19] I understood why they only gave one
[1:07:21] measurement for his Gerber Temple it was
[1:07:24] 60 feet tall
[1:07:25] it didn't give the length of it
[1:07:28] it only said it's 60 feet tall so it was
[1:07:30] as tall as Solomons but we don't know if
[1:07:33] it's as big and of course it wouldn't
[1:07:35] have been as Grand because the elders
[1:07:36] cried
[1:07:38] they were weeping why can't why can't it
[1:07:40] be like it was under Solomon and God
[1:07:42] said why do you despise the day of small
[1:07:44] things
[1:07:45] can I say like this church this is a day
[1:07:47] of small things amen we're at the very
[1:07:50] top of the pyramid praise God yeah this
[1:07:53] is not the open door generation this is
[1:07:55] a day of small things small moves are
[1:07:57] gone
[1:07:59] Hallelujah not big groups of people
[1:08:01] small groups of people in other words
[1:08:02] let's not despise the day we live in
[1:08:05] let's be grateful let's Rejoice if it's
[1:08:07] a small Revival praise God Amen because
[1:08:09] at least we got a Revival Hallelujah
[1:08:12] if we're not denominations at least not
[1:08:14] we're at least we're not in cold uh worn
[1:08:16] out sinful churches thank God we got the
[1:08:19] Holy Ghost praise God
[1:08:21] hey man
[1:08:24] and so this room about first and all the
[1:08:27] people rejoiced that at least they have
[1:08:29] the burnt offering back at least we can
[1:08:31] sacrifice at least we can worship God
[1:08:33] again Hallelujah
[1:08:35] amen glory
[1:08:37] and then remember after this the
[1:08:40] government shut down building for 16
[1:08:42] years
[1:08:44] so for 16 years they gave up
[1:08:48] and that's where the scripture came that
[1:08:50] we read here I'm gonna go back to
[1:08:51] Zechariah now
[1:08:53] this is where the scripture came
[1:08:56] first Zechariah 4 verse 6. then he
[1:08:59] answers speak unto me saying this is the
[1:09:00] word of the Lord under this room will
[1:09:01] say not by might not but not by power
[1:09:04] but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[1:09:08] so God has to encourage River you got
[1:09:11] the foundation the platform you got the
[1:09:13] alter he said but it's not going to be
[1:09:15] your might that finishes this work
[1:09:18] the holy spirit's going to finish this
[1:09:20] word and you know how the Holy Spirit
[1:09:22] did it he raised up two Prophets
[1:09:24] Zechariah and haggai I love this the
[1:09:27] Bible said they just didn't stand and
[1:09:28] watch and preach the Bible said they got
[1:09:31] in in the work as well
[1:09:32] that's not like a man of God where he's
[1:09:35] a preacher or whatever it is even if
[1:09:36] he's not preaching he'll say Amen to
[1:09:38] everywhere amen so I'm going to sit back
[1:09:41] and they're they're so stoked they're
[1:09:42] almost falling asleep but but if they're
[1:09:44] preaching they expect everybody to say
[1:09:45] Amen
[1:09:46] I don't like stuff like that
[1:09:48] yeah I like a prophet that gets right
[1:09:50] back in he gets right into the work like
[1:09:52] everybody else praise God
[1:09:53] he puts his nose in the grindstone just
[1:09:56] like everybody else
[1:09:58] Hallelujah
[1:10:00] that's a real prophet of God they had
[1:10:02] two Prophets
[1:10:04] and the Bible said they're prophesying
[1:10:06] calls them to prosper and finish the
[1:10:08] work quickly
[1:10:10] so as soon as those prophets started
[1:10:12] prophesying they said we're getting back
[1:10:13] to work I don't care if it's been 16
[1:10:15] years since we put that last Stone on
[1:10:17] the phone Foundation we're going to put
[1:10:19] our past behind us amen church we can
[1:10:21] put our past behind us and let's see
[1:10:23] what God is speaking to us right now
[1:10:25] let's see if we can get some inspiration
[1:10:27] right now and let's go to finishing what
[1:10:29] God started in our lives
[1:10:31] maybe God hasn't answered a prayer for
[1:10:33] 16 years maybe it's been two years or
[1:10:35] five years or ten years let's trust God
[1:10:37] say God make me to prosper again
[1:10:39] prophesy to me speak to me I want your
[1:10:42] work to be finished in my life praise
[1:10:44] God
[1:10:46] Hallelujah
[1:10:48] I didn't get to this video I'll get this
[1:10:50] on Wednesday
[1:10:51] but when I preached on the Kings last
[1:10:52] week Kings must rely on the Lord
[1:10:56] you know it was ASA ASA served God so
[1:10:58] well that God gave him 10 years of peace
[1:11:00] not one war
[1:11:02] for 10 years
[1:11:06] I thought I was so blessed I'm like wow
[1:11:07] we had our last trial in 2018.
[1:11:10] with some some uh saints that really
[1:11:12] didn't like me
[1:11:13] spoke some awful things that made my
[1:11:15] life really hard
[1:11:17] really hard to preach
[1:11:19] but since then now I've had five years
[1:11:21] of Peace by God's grace
[1:11:23] but peace isn't just to sit back and do
[1:11:25] nothing the Bible said then ASA
[1:11:27] strengthened his kingdom
[1:11:30] he built walls around cities he put up
[1:11:32] Gates uh the Bible said he put up food
[1:11:35] and weapons in the garrisons in the
[1:11:37] cities in other words he got he
[1:11:39] strengthened himself in case there would
[1:11:40] be another War because there's always
[1:11:41] another War
[1:11:44] I don't like to say that I shouldn't
[1:11:46] smile about it either but there's good
[1:11:48] there comes more Wars
[1:11:50] right I like that God will give you
[1:11:52] times of peace and in those times of
[1:11:54] Peace you got to get strong in the Lord
[1:11:56] and the power of His might Hallelujah
[1:11:59] that's what God's done for us praise God
[1:12:01] that's right he's made us stronger these
[1:12:03] last five years
[1:12:05] we don't know less about the message we
[1:12:07] know more about the message praise God
[1:12:10] and all these attacks all these Winds of
[1:12:12] Doctrine now Bloom bod and we're just
[1:12:14] like okay keep blowing you're not
[1:12:15] blowing through this church Hallelujah
[1:12:18] it's exactly right because we're not
[1:12:20] babies the Bible said babies are tossed
[1:12:22] around by all these doctors is Tate
[1:12:24] playing right or not that's what a baby
[1:12:26] thinks about praise God but a real man
[1:12:28] of God knows the book of Acts he knows
[1:12:30] his foundation praise God he knows what
[1:12:32] the apostolic father is God he know
[1:12:33] where the real Homeland is hallelujah
[1:12:36] that's right Glory
[1:12:38] I always got to preach on at least once
[1:12:41] now there's Solomon's Temple look how
[1:12:43] much grander that is than that that's
[1:12:44] zero no wonder that some of those
[1:12:46] Old-Timers cried but God said don't
[1:12:49] despise small things right
[1:12:51] right I'm still in your midst I'm just
[1:12:52] doing a different thing
[1:12:54] Hallelujah
[1:12:55] in other words I'm only 400 years away
[1:12:57] I'm going to send the real temple of God
[1:12:58] Jesus
[1:13:00] stop worrying about the Natural Things
[1:13:03] the spiritual ones coming amen I'm
[1:13:07] coming myself
[1:13:09] after Prophet actor prophet and you
[1:13:11] receive him thank God for them he said
[1:13:13] but this time I'm coming myself
[1:13:14] Hallelujah
[1:13:18] so if you zoom in look it's all gold all
[1:13:20] gold top to bottom those wings in the
[1:13:22] terrible in the Holy place they reach up
[1:13:23] all the way to the ceiling

[1:13:27] from their wings went from the wall to
[1:13:29] the wall
[1:13:30] so much Glory so much Beauty
[1:13:33] look how tall this uh this labor is
[1:13:37] and they had 10 extra labors on the
[1:13:38] outside Moses just had one labor one
[1:13:40] real small labor
[1:13:42] this was grander in glory but God said
[1:13:45] don't despise small things
[1:13:48] Hallelujah
[1:13:52] the early church had 3 000 baptized on
[1:13:55] the day of Pentecost don't despise the
[1:13:56] damn small things when we get 17
[1:13:58] baptized out in Junction City
[1:14:01] oh
[1:14:07] I thank God for what he's doing brother
[1:14:09] Levi
[1:14:10] because I didn't ask for it I didn't
[1:14:12] look for it God said it Hallelujah
[1:14:14] we got to see what God is doing right
[1:14:16] now praise God I think Simon's preaching
[1:14:18] for them this morning I'm not mistaken
[1:14:20] not mistaken he said Wayne can you come
[1:14:22] preach brother I said you just tell me
[1:14:24] when I'll come
[1:14:25] I said maybe we'll bring the whole
[1:14:27] church down that'd be a huge sacrifice
[1:14:31] now let me let me uh I'm gonna get to
[1:14:34] closing
[1:14:36] now in Zechariah 4
[1:14:39] . person picture

[1:14:43] beginning of the chapter
[1:14:44] two trees olive trees are feeding in to
[1:14:47] the oil
[1:14:48] so this lamp sand can give its light
[1:14:51] I love it two Prophets The Bible the
[1:14:54] Bible calls these anointed ones
[1:14:56] two prophets give inspiration to the
[1:14:58] church can receive the word of God and
[1:15:00] shine its light
[1:15:02] Hallelujah
[1:15:04] now in our day God only sent one
[1:15:07] brother Branham
[1:15:08] is that right
[1:15:12] but in this day they had Zechariah and
[1:15:14] haggian and through their preaching it
[1:15:17] brought the Saints to such a faith where
[1:15:19] they could believe the word of God and
[1:15:20] they could manifest the word of God to
[1:15:22] their age
[1:15:23] amen oh it's beautiful praise God what
[1:15:26] am I saying church I'm saying if you
[1:15:28] believe the Bible that I'm preaching you

[1:15:31] amen this week you'll go to work this
[1:15:35] week you'll go home and you'll be a
[1:15:36] light of Jesus Christ wherever you are
[1:15:38] praise God
[1:15:40] I'm saying the anointing from this word
[1:15:42] the anointing from the Holy Spirit from
[1:15:44] the word of God will make you shine
[1:15:46] bright Hallelujah
[1:15:48] everybody will know you're a Christian
[1:15:49] praise God and
[1:15:52] that's what the Bible says
[1:15:55] what are these uh trees represented so
[1:15:58] the trees represent the Old Testament
[1:15:59] New Testament
[1:16:00] he said the Bible said they represent
[1:16:02] Hagia and Zechariah the candlesticks
[1:16:04] represent the seven Church ages and
[1:16:06] these also represent Moses and Elijah to
[1:16:09] come to Israel at the end time there's
[1:16:11] at least four types here
[1:16:14] Hallelujah
[1:16:17] now let's read Zechariah 4 6 again
[1:16:23] I thought I'd lay this in here
[1:16:25] I just had this thought this morning I
[1:16:27] thought that's a pretty good thought get
[1:16:28] down
[1:16:32] then the answer and speaking of me
[1:16:34] saying this is the word of Lord on this
[1:16:35] Ruble saying not by might
[1:16:38] uh nor by power but by my spirit saith
[1:16:40] the Lord of hosts as he searched every
[1:16:43] believer
[1:16:44] God is going to ask them to trust in God
[1:16:47] like I said last Sunday to rely on the
[1:16:49] Lord
[1:16:50] can't rely on the world can't rely on
[1:16:53] your finances can't rely upon your
[1:16:54] education
[1:16:55] because I forgot it all anyway I paid
[1:16:57] all that money I forget everything I
[1:16:58] learned I can't rely on that
[1:17:01] it's nonsense
[1:17:04] but every believer Drew will had to
[1:17:06] recognize listen something's God's doing
[1:17:08] something here but I can't do it it's
[1:17:09] got to be the Holy Spirit
[1:17:11] I thought about all these types of the
[1:17:13] Rapture Sarah in her own might
[1:17:17] she said oh Abraham take Hagar we'll
[1:17:19] bring forth this promised son but God
[1:17:21] said Sarah not by might not by power but
[1:17:25] by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[1:17:27] amen church we all try to figure it out
[1:17:29] sometimes how can this happen how will
[1:17:31] this person get saved how bring this to
[1:17:33] pass how I make it financially how I do
[1:17:35] this in my spiritual life how I know the
[1:17:37] gifts of God in my life let the Holy
[1:17:39] Spirit figure it out for you praise God
[1:17:42] seek God until God reveals it to you in
[1:17:44] other words
[1:17:46] don't try to bring it to pass
[1:17:49] see and what was it what was God's
[1:17:52] spirit God's spirit was God coming in a
[1:17:54] body Discerning Sarah's heart he said no
[1:17:56] sir you did lie but I'll visit you next
[1:17:58] year according to the time of life amen
[1:18:01] amen glory
[1:18:03] oh I made me shout this morning
[1:18:05] Rebecca
[1:18:07] it wasn't by her my or her power
[1:18:09] the Holy Spirit moved her to be an
[1:18:12] answer to that man of leisure's Prayer
[1:18:15] think about that when was the last time
[1:18:17] you're an answer to somebody's prayer
[1:18:18] hopefully not too long ago
[1:18:20] I was just yesterday I put that video
[1:18:22] out about marriage and divorce and the
[1:18:23] preacher said oh my that's exactly what
[1:18:25] I was studying on now I'm going to
[1:18:26] preach on marriage and divorce tomorrow
[1:18:27] that's an answer to my prayer glory amen
[1:18:32] gotta be led by the Holy Spirit praise
[1:18:34] God
[1:18:36] see God moved her God made her go up and
[1:18:39] say um can I serve you and your camels
[1:18:41] rather than saying what can you do for
[1:18:43] me
[1:18:45] look I was something from you no make
[1:18:47] yourself a servant praise God
[1:18:51] did it and then she wanted the camels
[1:18:53] that was going to Care to her brother
[1:18:55] and praise God
[1:18:57] not by might not by power but by the
[1:19:00] spirit of God hallelujah
[1:19:02] Hallelujah so see we see
[1:19:04] serving others is getting under the
[1:19:06] spirit of God
[1:19:09] watering 10 camels that's quite a
[1:19:12] how about like filling uh 10 cars with
[1:19:14] gas that's the kind of what it's like
[1:19:16] way harder than that too way harder
[1:19:18] you're going to sweat a lot more
[1:19:19] carrying the water to camels
[1:19:21] Rahab
[1:19:23] Rahab couldn't break down any walls it
[1:19:25] was wasn't by her apology do you think
[1:19:27] she's out there with that red cord
[1:19:28] smacking the Wall come on go down go

[1:19:44] coming for all God's people who are
[1:19:46] under the token praise God

[1:19:50] spirit of God had to do that
[1:19:52] but she could get her family under the
[1:19:54] token
[1:19:56] again witness to your family praise God
[1:19:58] you can pray with your family right

[1:20:02] like even with brother Chris last week
[1:20:04] he come
[1:20:05] I was looking for any type any spiritual
[1:20:07] thing I could do so in there he was
[1:20:08] talking about his sister I just said

[1:20:12] I'm just looking for any opportunity I
[1:20:13] can pray for somebody speak the word of
[1:20:15] God I share two scriptures with him last
[1:20:17] night
[1:20:18] I just want to get in the spirit of God
[1:20:20] and try to be a blessing and help and
[1:20:22] maybe God will hear that prayer for his
[1:20:24] sister
[1:20:25] right
[1:20:27] I just want to get people we're not
[1:20:29] going to get them on their token let's
[1:20:30] be inviting to church
[1:20:31] unless we pray for them let's be invited
[1:20:33] into Bible studies
[1:20:35] lest we invite our neighbors over for
[1:20:36] our meal today which we did
[1:20:38] I don't know the man said he might come
[1:20:40] he said the family's busy but hopefully
[1:20:42] there'll be another by God's grace
[1:20:45] Hallelujah
[1:20:47] yes sir
[1:20:48] couldn't be by her might or her power
[1:20:50] be by the Holy Spirit what the Holy
[1:20:52] Spirit say fast and pray for three days
[1:20:55] and then I'll give you favor to go into
[1:20:57] the king unannounced you should die but
[1:20:59] the spirit is pronounced life Hallelujah
[1:21:02] is by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:21:14] family mistreated me they gave me the
[1:21:15] worst jobs and then one day Solomon
[1:21:17] rides by and said whoa
[1:21:19] girl
[1:21:20] what's her name
[1:21:22] Brothers you go find her name
[1:21:24] she's she's the one only one of her
[1:21:26] mother the Bible said she's the one
[1:21:29] she's the one of a kind there's nobody
[1:21:30] like her
[1:21:31] saw me just riding by all of a sudden
[1:21:33] that that that's her
[1:21:35] Hallelujah and God rescued her it wasn't
[1:21:39] by her might or her power it wasn't my
[1:21:41] argument the family I don't want to be a
[1:21:42] Shepherd anymore she just did what her
[1:21:45] parents told her and then God pulled her
[1:21:47] out of the Maori clay Hallelujah amen
[1:21:49] Simon made her bride Hallelujah
[1:21:52] amen say You're beautiful head to toe
[1:21:54] praise God
[1:21:55] Spirit gave her favor
[1:21:58] in other words the Holy Ghost comes
[1:22:00] looking for you
[1:22:01] amen amen God's goodness is running
[1:22:03] after you brother sisters God's goodness
[1:22:06] is running after you praise God
[1:22:09] you can't make it happen yourself trust
[1:22:11] in the Holy Spirit
[1:22:13] now remember the couch song comes with
[1:22:16] shouties this reminds me of first
[1:22:18] Thessalonians 4 16. the Lord himself
[1:22:20] descends with the shout voice Trump
[1:22:24] and when drumable put that last Stone on
[1:22:26] imagine putting that stone on everybody
[1:22:28] was shouting Grace Grace
[1:22:32] isn't that something
[1:22:34] when a real believer who's fulfilling
[1:22:36] prophecy Sees God Hand go to work they
[1:22:39] don't say look what I've done they said
[1:22:41] it was Grace thank God for Grace
[1:22:43] Hallelujah
[1:22:45] look what we did it wasn't that look
[1:22:47] what God did Hallelujah
[1:22:50] so the whole time they're shouting God
[1:22:52] gave us favor you gave us favor you you
[1:22:55] let your face shine upon us you immersed
[1:22:57] with us you loved us despite our 16
[1:22:59] years of absence from doing anything
[1:23:01] you're the one who loved us it was your
[1:23:03] grace it was your power they were giving
[1:23:06] God praise they were shouting because of
[1:23:08] God's faithfulness
[1:23:09] that's what we need to do praise God
[1:23:12] Glory
[1:23:15] God's faithfulness is going to bring us
[1:23:16] through
[1:23:22] Bill Graham said what is a shout
[1:23:24] he said it's the message going forth the
[1:23:27] living bread of life
[1:23:28] bringing forth the bride
[1:23:31] that's the show the message is going on
[1:23:34] Hallelujah the Mysteries are finished
[1:23:37] the hearts of the fathers are being
[1:23:39] turned back Glory be baptized in Jesus
[1:23:42] name praise God
[1:23:44] leave those denominations
[1:23:46] believe in a supernatural God God's the
[1:23:49] same yesterday today and forever praise
[1:23:52] God Amen
[1:23:53] amen that's what God's people feed on
[1:23:55] the Living Word of God hallelujah
[1:23:58] remember Church there's three brother
[1:24:00] said that Jesus does all three of these
[1:24:02] while he's descending so I don't know I
[1:24:04] don't know how to explain this and this
[1:24:06] is one area I need to grow and I was
[1:24:07] sharing this with the church
[1:24:09] somehow Jesus is doing this while he's
[1:24:12] descending
[1:24:14] that's all that's all I know that's what
[1:24:16] the Bible says
[1:24:17] the Lord himself shall descend with a
[1:24:20] shout
[1:24:23] so something something with the rashers
[1:24:25] already happened I don't know
[1:24:26] Hallelujah he's descending now because
[1:24:29] the shout is going forward
[1:24:32] get my bride ready praise God
[1:24:34] the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:24:36] Hallelujah get the bride ready praise
[1:24:38] God
[1:24:40] amen and then there'll be a voice and
[1:24:42] the Bible says the voice of an archangel
[1:24:45] and Michael the Archangel rebuked Satan
[1:24:47] for trying to get the body of Moses in
[1:24:50] other words the Archangel protected the
[1:24:52] resurrected bodies Hallelujah
[1:24:55] and that's what he'll do to the
[1:24:56] Archangel here will not uh he'll not uh
[1:24:59] protect the glorified bodies he'll call
[1:25:01] the glorified bodies
[1:25:03] that's exactly right praise God
[1:25:06] the voice of the Archangel and then the
[1:25:09] Trump of God
[1:25:11] 's trumpet angel
[1:25:14] the Bible said it will be changed caught
[1:25:16] up in a moment in a twinkle or not to go
[1:25:19] to the marriage suffer the lamb I'm at
[1:25:21] an hour and a half hopefully I'm not
[1:25:22] wearing you out there
[1:25:24] but I said the voice he said the next
[1:25:26] thing is the resurrection of the
[1:25:27] sleeping bride the ones that died back
[1:25:29] in the other ages they're caught
[1:25:31] together
[1:25:32] and he said the Trump is the trumpet
[1:25:36] which always at the Feast of trumpets
[1:25:37] calling the people to the feast and
[1:25:39] that'll be the bride's supper the Lambs
[1:25:41] supper with the bride in the sky
[1:25:45] Glory
[1:25:46] now remember
[1:25:48] what does grace mean grace could mean
[1:25:50] the former letterings
[1:25:52] but I like this definition of grace
[1:25:55] for the grace of God that brings
[1:25:56] salvation at the pier to all men
[1:25:58] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[1:26:00] worldly love we should live soberly
[1:26:02] righteously and godly in this present
[1:26:05] World in other words the people are
[1:26:07] shouting Grace thank God I could live
[1:26:09] holy Jesus helped me live holy before
[1:26:12] the the Capstone was placed down
[1:26:15] Hallelujah Jesus help me live a
[1:26:18] righteous life in the midst of laodicea
[1:26:21] in the midst of Satan's eating God's
[1:26:23] grace help me to live soberly so I
[1:26:26] wasn't joking my way through life
[1:26:28] but I was a sober sincere Christian
[1:26:31] looking for that glorious appearing of
[1:26:33] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:26:37] the church said he might redeem us from
[1:26:39] all iniquity
[1:26:40] I just want to remind you if there's
[1:26:42] iniquity in your life just keep serving
[1:26:44] God
[1:26:45] sometimes people will say well I can't
[1:26:47] get over this sin I'll stop coming to
[1:26:49] church or I'll stop reading my Bible
[1:26:51] because I can't get a victory and I'll
[1:26:53] stop contacting the Saints because I
[1:26:54] don't want to defile them that's the
[1:26:55] wrong attitude
[1:26:57] keep coming to the hospital yes right
[1:27:00] there's a lot of people that go to
[1:27:01] hospitals they don't get healed the
[1:27:02] first time they go
[1:27:04] right or the first day they're there
[1:27:07] right but if they really want to get
[1:27:09] well they'll probably stay at the
[1:27:10] hospital
[1:27:12] this is God's spiritual Hospital praise
[1:27:14] God
[1:27:16] don't let Satan
[1:27:18] try to discourage you well you're not as
[1:27:20] holy as Russell well of course you're
[1:27:21] not you're just a new believer you
[1:27:23] battled through other things maybe they
[1:27:24] didn't battle through the things you
[1:27:25] battled through
[1:27:27] just keep trusting God he promised to
[1:27:29] redeem you from all iniquity amen
[1:27:34] that's the word
[1:27:36] he remember he's already forgiven you he
[1:27:38] already paid for all your sins he's just
[1:27:39] got to help you to learn to overcome
[1:27:41] your sins because you got to be an
[1:27:42] overcomer
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:44] as we try to get you to see
[1:27:46] not not all overcoming happens in one
[1:27:48] day that's right I wish every overcoming
[1:27:51] happened in one day that'd be awesome
[1:27:53] man I no longer struggle with that mind
[1:27:55] battle I no longer say those that words
[1:27:57] I no longer think that I only think pure
[1:27:59] thoughts all the time I wish that was
[1:28:00] true
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:03] but what is it it's going to be Grace
[1:28:04] Grace
[1:28:06] favor favor from God almighty
[1:28:10] the Bible says God gives more grace God
[1:28:13] resists us when we're proud but he gives
[1:28:15] us grace to the humble amen draw night
[1:28:17] to God he'll draw an eye to you
[1:28:20] ah I guess I'm going to go ahead and
[1:28:23] close I'm gonna skip all this I preach
[1:28:24] this Jesus of the Capstone
[1:28:26] I want to call it just goes with a
[1:28:27] simple thought
[1:28:30] we've seen all those temporals zero will
[1:28:33] finish that Temple the people shouted
[1:28:35] and said Grace Grace what a service that
[1:28:38] was my goodness Hallelujah
[1:28:42] we can worship again now we can go to
[1:28:44] the holiest of holies the whole thing is
[1:28:46] finished the temple of God is finished
[1:28:48] and one day God's Temple will be
[1:28:51] finished in that Holy City amen amen
[1:28:55] but when that temples finished the Bible
[1:28:57] said there will be no physical Temple
[1:29:00] therein
[1:29:02] that Holy City we saw that Larkin
[1:29:05] drawing there there'll be no Temple up
[1:29:08] there think about that most had a
[1:29:09] tabernacle Solomon's room of them Harris
[1:29:12] Temple Israel's gonna rebuild another
[1:29:15] during the tribulation
[1:29:18] and those are all fine but that's not
[1:29:20] what God is going to those are all
[1:29:22] symbols of what God is trying to get to
[1:29:24] get us to see God is trying to get us to
[1:29:27] see that there was only one Temple the
[1:29:29] Bible said the Lord God Almighty and the
[1:29:31] lamb are the Temple of it the father and
[1:29:33] son are the temple Hallelujah
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:38] because the father's invisible
[1:29:40] Hallelujah but the son is visible the
[1:29:43] sun is the temple and the father comes
[1:29:45] to live in him
[1:29:47] and then the city had no need of the son
[1:29:50] neither the moon to shine for the glory
[1:29:53] of God to Enlighten it and the lamb is
[1:29:55] the light thereof the temple is the
[1:29:58] light
[1:30:00] Jesus is the temple Jesus is the light
[1:30:03] Jesus Jesus is everything for us listen
[1:30:06] to our feet musicians can come by God's
[1:30:08] grace
[1:30:10] we rejoice
[1:30:11] in zarubal's Temple we also Rejoice that
[1:30:14] one day this spiritual Temple is going
[1:30:16] to be finished
[1:30:17] that last soul is going to come in and
[1:30:19] Jesus is going to sweep down and Rapture
[1:30:21] up
[1:30:22] his church
[1:30:24] he's going to take this habitation this
[1:30:26] Temple the spiritual House of God he's
[1:30:28] going to Rapture this Temple off the
[1:30:30] Earth
[1:30:31] and then he's going to bring it back
[1:30:32] down for a thousand years of Peace amen
[1:30:36] glory
[1:30:41] now how many want to be on Temple in the
[1:30:43] Holy Spirit today amen that's what I
[1:30:45] want to be
[1:30:46] by the grace of God let's buy our heads
