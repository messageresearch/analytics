[34:00] race
[34:17] Psalm chapter 142. I'd like to look at
[34:20] isolation this might be my last part
[34:22] here part five
[34:25] quite sure
[34:28] so I'm 142.
[34:32] what
[34:38] don't see brother Chris I'm just going
[34:40] to text him real quick
[34:49] okay
[34:50] Psalms 141 I'm sorry 42 verses 1 and 2
[34:53] or just read those verse two verses
[35:04] I mentioned on Sunday I'd like to look
[35:06] at some of David's prayers and of course
[35:07] some other Psalms
[35:09] solemn writers rather I think it'd be
[35:11] encouragement to us you know as we go
[35:13] through our Trials of life
[35:15] you know
[35:17] I'm sure you've experienced God's word
[35:19] just pick you up when you're down
[35:21] and so it's hard to find people that
[35:23] were maybe as down as David in some of
[35:26] the cases where he was and as we saw
[35:28] with Adam and Eve and different places
[35:30] people were Believers yet they got to
[35:32] such Low Places
[35:34] but it's just powerful to see how these
[35:36] were songs they sang to lift them up out
[35:39] of discouragement to lift them up out of
[35:41] difficult places
[35:43] and so I'd like to look at that tonight
[35:44] and just as a reminder that when we're
[35:46] isolated or in tough places let's go to
[35:49] the word of God let's sing a song that's
[35:51] been sung before praise God
[35:53] or God could be so gracious he could
[35:54] give us a new song Amen
[35:56] Psalm 142 verses 1 and 2. let's read
[35:59] that if we can one two three I Cried
[36:02] unto the Lord with my voice with my
[36:06] voice unto the Lord did I make my
[36:09] supplication I poured out my complaint
[36:12] before him I shooed before him my
[36:16] trouble amen may God add His blessings
[36:18] to read his word maybe seated and praise
[36:20] God
[36:24] so I wanted to open with this verse to
[36:26] just show you how
[36:28] when we go through difficult times there
[36:31] is a way to complain to God
[36:33] where it's not a sinful complaint that's
[36:36] why I want to open up with this we see
[36:38] it right here in the scripture I don't
[36:39] think any of us in our sound Minds would
[36:41] deny this and say well this verse isn't
[36:43] inspired brother I don't think you'd say
[36:45] that I wouldn't say that how we leave
[36:47] all the word of gods inspired
[36:49] praise God I'm not gonna I'm not going
[36:51] to ask you to raise your hands but I'm
[36:53] sure some of us have complained before
[36:55] before the Lord
[36:56] I think my hand will go up first
[36:59] maybe things didn't go the way I wanted
[37:01] everything was going good until that and
[37:02] then Lord why did you do
[37:06] you do and we see the songwriter this is
[37:08] a Psalm of David a prayer when he was in
[37:12] a cave of course running from Saul
[37:16] and it's been guessed at you know I
[37:18] looked at the at some of the the numbers
[37:21] and he he ran from David anywhere from
[37:23] 13 to maybe 16 years I'm sorry I ran
[37:27] from Saul rather David ran from Saul
[37:29] because he didn't become king until he
[37:31] was 30. it was likely he was around 17
[37:34] or 16 when he slew Goliath and you know
[37:37] we know he had a little bit of time
[37:38] after that where he was accepted but
[37:40] then you know jealousy crept into Saul's
[37:42] heart when the women sang you know Saul
[37:44] slayed a thousand and David is ten
[37:46] thousand
[37:48] and here we find David here in a cave
[37:55] most of us probably haven't been hiding
[37:57] in a cave for our lives
[38:00] right but how many have ever felt alone
[38:02] in the dark at night
[38:04] you ever felt like you've been in your
[38:05] room and you're just just you it's dark
[38:08] and you feel alone you don't feel the
[38:10] presence of God maybe
[38:12] things look very discouraging
[38:14] or maybe you're alone out and sitting
[38:15] out in the car in the parking lot you're
[38:17] just out there in the dark
[38:20] well we can a little bit relate to David
[38:22] there in that sense that David is alone
[38:25] in the dark now some caves were small
[38:28] David was in
[38:30] some caves were large remember in some
[38:32] caves all all of his mighty men could
[38:34] stay in there they would hide from Saul
[38:37] talk about some deep Caverns you can get
[38:38] into
[38:39] there's any place I want to be though in
[38:41] a dark place like that I want to be with
[38:42] God's armies praise God I want to be
[38:45] with some mighty men if I'm going to be
[38:46] in a cave like that praise God
[38:48] and I know like when I'm with you I know
[38:49] when you're praying for me I know I'm in
[38:51] a cave with some real saints praise God
[38:52] I'm in a dark place but I know God is
[38:54] with me when you're praying for me and
[38:55] I'm praying for you
[38:57] but notice David complained about the
[38:59] symptoms
[39:00] but he never charged God foolishly just
[39:03] like job never did
[39:06] job had lots of questions why is this
[39:08] happening where is God
[39:11] but job never got to the point where he
[39:14] charged God like a fool where he would
[39:15] Curse God
[39:17] and say God is Not faithful God
[39:21] doesn't deserve my praise he never got
[39:24] to that point now he did say I'm more
[39:26] righteous than God in Pride he exalted
[39:28] himself but he never cursed God and said
[39:30] I'll just curse God and die
[39:34] so we read here from the scripture that
[39:36] David actually uses the word complaint I
[39:39] poured out my complaint before him
[39:42] now pouring we get the illustration if
[39:44] someone's pouring something it probably
[39:45] means there's usually a lot in there
[39:48] right and I'm sure we can all relate to
[39:50] times where we've had heavy hearts and
[39:51] it seems like Lord there's so much that
[39:53] I want to say
[39:55] there's so much that I really don't
[39:56] understand in my life
[39:58] and that's what David is experiencing
[40:00] here all of his frustration all of his
[40:03] all of his pain all of his questions he
[40:05] just needs to pour it out I don't know
[40:08] if you do a journal but I do a journal
[40:09] and sometimes my mind gets so full and I
[40:12] get so nervous or anxious I just got I
[40:14] got I call it a brain dump I watched a
[40:16] video one time and they said you got to
[40:17] do a brain dub I thought that's exactly
[40:19] what I got to do praise God I gotta dump
[40:21] out my brain and all my thoughts and all
[40:22] my worries and all my concerns all my
[40:24] ideas and all my questions and so I just
[40:26] you know take a page there just turn the
[40:28] page and just pour out all my thoughts
[40:30] there I do a brain dump
[40:32] and of course it's good to do that but
[40:35] it's also it's better to pray about that
[40:36] though right like David says here I pour
[40:40] out my prayer he says in verse one I've
[40:42] Cried unto God with my voice
[40:45] now church that's a good thing to do to
[40:46] do as well I'm sure I'm sure you know it
[40:48] but let's just say it for tonight
[40:50] rather than just thinking about problems
[40:52] it's good to express them and tell them
[40:54] to God
[40:55] it's good to actually say it out loud in
[40:57] other words don't get it all vent up
[40:59] inside or cooped up inside don't let it
[41:01] all stay inside right because if you
[41:04] keep keeping it in like that eventually
[41:06] you're going to explode it's all going
[41:07] to come out it's going to come out the
[41:08] wrong way
[41:09] the way you don't want it to come out
[41:12] all right like we have family members my
[41:13] wife and I and they just let it get
[41:15] boiled up and then all of a sudden boom
[41:17] here it comes and you don't want to be
[41:18] around when it boils out like that
[41:20] uh that's happened to me I told you one
[41:22] time at work one teacher got so
[41:23] frustrated with me and it finally just
[41:25] exploded because I was forgetting to do
[41:26] a little bit of paperwork each year I
[41:28] forgot to do a little bit of paperwork
[41:29] each year and she said why do you always
[41:31] forget to do that I'm like I'm so sorry
[41:33] no one told me I'm sorry I made a
[41:35] mistake
[41:36] but boy did I get a red-faced explosion
[41:40] because it just boiled up and
[41:42] you know the first time it was a mistake
[41:44] they never came to me and said well you
[41:46] know could you fix this
[41:47] but let it boil up over years and years
[41:49] and years and I'm sure I'm the only one
[41:51] that's ever made a mistake at work okay
[41:53] so so you just feel bad for me okay
[41:57] now we all make mistakes
[41:59] at work
[42:01] but I like this idea in verse two of
[42:03] pouring it out before God
[42:05] it's okay to complain it's okay to share
[42:09] your discontentment that's what
[42:11] complaining is discontentment
[42:13] it's okay to share that as long as it's
[42:15] in the right spirit
[42:17] right it's not accusing God of evil it's
[42:20] not uh cursing God
[42:23] it's not and as long as it's not
[42:25] accusing God of any wrongdoing
[42:29] if it was a sin then then later on this
[42:31] would have said Davidson when he said
[42:32] this prayer
[42:34] it's not a sin to express your
[42:35] discontentment as we'll see here tonight
[42:39] now years ago I preached a sermon
[42:42] about
[42:43] I think I called it the worst sound in
[42:45] the world I preach in Columbus numerous
[42:47] times I got a good response from it it
[42:49] was all about complaining and murmuring
[42:50] and when I preached there in Columbus I
[42:52] think four or five almost the whole
[42:53] there was only seven people in the
[42:54] church I think everybody come up for
[42:55] prayer it's a really small Church in
[42:57] Columbus and each person and even the
[42:59] pastor come up and said I'm complaining
[43:01] forgive me I've been complaining all
[43:02] week to my wife about the situation at
[43:04] the church
[43:06] but it was based upon this study I read
[43:08] I was reading you know how Israel was
[43:09] complaining of Moses they complained
[43:12] about Moses they complained about not
[43:13] have enough food they complain about not
[43:15] have enough water they complained it was
[43:17] too hot they complained it's all
[43:19] complaints
[43:20] and I found this study back in 2011 this
[43:23] uh
[43:25] the scientists or whatever they are to
[43:26] know sociologists I'm not sure what they
[43:28] are but they studied and they asked all
[43:30] these humans what's the worst sound in
[43:31] the world you know they got someone
[43:33] scratching a chalkboard you know I can
[43:34] kind of shiver right now just thinking
[43:35] about that
[43:37] um you know the sirens going off
[43:39] baby screaming
[43:41] uh gunshots or whatever all these sounds
[43:44] and they rated them and the very worst
[43:46] sound of almond all of them was whining
[43:49] and complaining
[43:50] they said the people could work better
[43:52] under any other sound except for whining
[43:54] and complaining
[43:57] people just couldn't work as well
[43:58] through that that's the worst sound in
[44:00] the world and how many believe that's
[44:01] the worst sound in the world to God
[44:04] whining complaining with the wrong
[44:06] spirit
[44:08] right in order to accuse God of some
[44:10] wrong or to uh to to to make him uh to
[44:16] make yourself greater than him or or to
[44:18] accuse him of something that he never
[44:20] did
[44:23] maybe not answering our prayers the way
[44:25] we wanted us not having what the life we
[44:27] thought we should have
[44:29] but I thought that was such a a great
[44:31] expression of the natural relating to
[44:33] the spiritual in the natural we hate to
[44:36] hear
[44:37] I mean who likes to hear your co-workers
[44:38] complain about work like and really our
[44:40] jobs aren't that hard
[44:42] we're sitting at a computer
[44:44] answering phone calls
[44:46] typing emails
[44:48] clicking and doing grade cards that's me
[44:50] now
[44:52] sometimes we've got to clean up throw up
[44:54] you know sometimes we gotta do that
[44:55] sometimes
[44:57] not all the time but really how hard is
[45:00] our work but yet people will complain on
[45:01] the job and it doesn't make work any
[45:03] better it makes it harder like what time
[45:06] is is it it's not even lunch yet we've
[45:07] got all this complaining going on you
[45:09] know I still got a half a day left
[45:12] nothing is worse than complaining that's
[45:14] why the Bible says in everything give
[45:15] thanks for this is the will of God in
[45:17] Christ Jesus God's got a purpose God's
[45:20] writing a story God's doing something
[45:22] praise God he's molding our character
[45:26] and so just let's remember that remember
[45:28] Israel would murmur and complain now
[45:30] that's the thing they complained which
[45:32] is okay to express your discontentment
[45:34] to God but it's murmur
[45:36] and that speak against other people the
[45:39] Bible said they murmured against Moses
[45:40] and Aaron
[45:42] right and as Christians mother Brown
[45:43] said we we don't want to murmur we don't
[45:45] want to hurt anybody's influence
[45:47] right we don't want to murmur against
[45:49] people
[45:50] so the Bible said they murmured and
[45:52] complained
[45:54] there was another time I think you're
[45:55] just coming to me now yeah I didn't
[45:56] write down let's go to the book of Jude
[45:57] let's read that one in June and then
[45:59] we're going to spend a little time in
[46:00] the Psalms here tonight by God's grace
[46:02] Jude there's only one chapter
[46:07] it speaks of judgment upon sinners
[46:10] and this is not a harsh sermon on you
[46:13] church this is just a
[46:15] of course you know we all I believe
[46:17] we're all under grace Hallelujah but
[46:19] just a reminder it's verse
[46:22] 14 speaks of Enoch's prophecy about the
[46:25] battle of Armageddon with Jesus coming
[46:26] back on a white horse with ten thousand
[46:28] of his Saints and then in verse 15 Jesus
[46:30] comes to execute judgment upon all and
[46:33] to convince all that are ungodly among
[46:36] them of all their ungodly Deeds which
[46:37] they have ungodly committed aren't you
[46:39] glad you got godliness over there
[46:42] what are sinners sinners are ungodly
[46:44] they reject the anointing of godliness
[46:46] but you've got it
[46:50] and all of their hard speeches which
[46:52] ungodly Sinners have spoken against him
[46:54] think about that how many Democrats or
[46:56] how many liberals go on Tick Tock or
[46:59] whatever they got Facebook and they give
[47:01] all these hard speeches against
[47:02] Christians or or hard speeches against
[47:04] God they'll be judged for that if they
[47:06] don't repent of that
[47:07] that's the reason God Jesus is coming
[47:09] back to judge them because of their hard
[47:11] speeches against God they think they can
[47:13] have some argument against God when God
[47:15] is a god of Grace right now praise God
[47:19] and he promises whosoever seeks after me
[47:21] shall find me
[47:23] the trouble is they haven't sought after
[47:25] God they haven't uh humbled themselves
[47:28] and and accepted the grace of God
[47:31] hallelujah that's all they got to do to
[47:33] accept it or else all they gotta do is
[47:34] receive it is accept it
[47:36] verse 16. These are here's here's what I
[47:39] was looking for these are murmurs right
[47:43] now people will call it today well I got
[47:45] to give a little rant on Facebook right
[47:47] here I'm gonna go get my rant now it's
[47:49] okay to give rants if they're funny or
[47:50] you know uh if they're not critical or
[47:52] something like that
[47:54] or if it's if it's God's righteous
[47:55] indignation it's okay to rant like that
[47:57] David did that he gave many rants
[48:00] against his enemies in the Book of
[48:01] Psalms many you could do whole sermons
[48:04] on just his prayers against his enemies
[48:07] right
[48:08] but here it's murmuring
[48:11] complainers walking after their own lust
[48:14] so see usually people that complain
[48:16] against God are those who know they're
[48:18] going against the word of God
[48:21] and so they want to enjoy their lust and
[48:22] they don't want to think about the
[48:24] Judgment that they're going to receive
[48:25] because of their Disobedience their
[48:27] ungodliness
[48:29] and their mouths speaketh great swelling
[48:31] words having men's persons in admiration
[48:34] because of advantage
[48:36] so of course they're saying everything
[48:38] in order to get more money or get more
[48:39] position or popularity or whatever
[48:41] they're trying to get
[48:42] but the point is they speak great
[48:44] swelling things against God that they
[48:46] don't even understand like job when job
[48:48] said Lord he said Lord I'm more
[48:51] righteous than you and and God come down
[48:53] to job and said job where are the
[48:54] treasure houses of snow can you make
[48:56] them can you make some snow for me can
[48:58] you make it snow today of course the
[49:00] answer is no with great swelling words
[49:03] like I deserve this and how could God do
[49:06] this to me and this is what I deserve it
[49:08] it's it's what I want instead of what
[49:10] God wants
[49:11] right selfishness
[49:16] and church let's keep going because it's
[49:17] a beautiful portion it all comes out of
[49:19] this serving God or serving your lusts
[49:22] that's what it comes down to those that
[49:24] are saved will crucify the affections
[49:26] and lust thereof those that are lost
[49:28] will live in their lusts
[49:30] Hallelujah right that's what we see here
[49:32] verse 17. that's a great summary of
[49:34] being saved and being lost crucify Your
[49:36] Lust and you're saved uh fulfill your
[49:39] lust and your loss verse 17 but beloved
[49:41] remember ye The Words which were spoken
[49:43] before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus
[49:45] Christ how that they told you there
[49:47] should be mockers in the last time who
[49:48] should walk after their own lust these
[49:51] be they who separate themselves sensual
[49:52] not having the spirit you don't have to
[49:55] worry you know when new people come in
[49:56] you don't have to wait too long pretty
[49:57] soon they're sensual lusts are going to
[50:00] take them out of the church
[50:02] right like we've had friends come in
[50:04] within the last years or two but then
[50:06] they leave and find out where they're
[50:07] living in fornication or they're living
[50:09] in adultery right it didn't take very
[50:12] long you hang around the preaching too
[50:13] long and if they're living in it they
[50:14] don't want to hear it
[50:16] that means they're sensual instead of
[50:19] spiritual praise God right they they
[50:21] fulfill the lust of the flesh rather
[50:23] than the desires of the Soul right
[50:26] so in most cases as long as the church
[50:29] is a spiritual church those who are
[50:31] sensual and feed the lust of the flesh
[50:33] they won't last very long they'll
[50:35] separate themselves praise God
[50:37] amen
[50:39] all right now let's get back to David
[50:40] here now go back to Psalms here
[50:42] uh
[50:43] let's go back to Psalm 142. what I just
[50:46] want to go through this
[50:47] I've never preached on this I've heard
[50:49] this preach before and I just really
[50:50] felt inspired I wanted to preach this
[50:52] and and just gain a lot of inspiration
[50:54] from David's writings and the psalm
[50:56] writers
[50:57] so here David shows us how to pour out
[50:59] your complaints to God without sinning
[51:02] now don't raise your hand but how many
[51:03] would like to know how to complain
[51:04] without sinning
[51:08] there's a way to do it
[51:10] now like what Henry says Henry says he
[51:12] was in some cave whether Adam or and
[51:14] Getty
[51:16] and he prayed this prayer it's plain he
[51:19] was in distress
[51:21] okay now I'm going to skip down and it
[51:23] just says it's so wonderful he said
[51:24] religion about him despite being chased
[51:26] down by a bounty hunter right his own
[51:28] father-in-law
[51:30] he still had the spiritual state to pray
[51:34] Church what a blessing like I said if
[51:36] you're sitting in a dark car if you're
[51:37] sitting in a dark room at night what a
[51:39] blessing if you can still pray in those
[51:41] dark times
[51:42] the caves the caves of Our Lives
[51:45] what a blessing if we still have some
[51:46] spiritual
[51:47] uh we'd say spiritual characteristic
[51:51] about us or spiritual desire about us in
[51:53] the midst of our biggest sufferings
[51:57] and notice yeah I like this too prayers
[52:00] and tears were his weapons now look at
[52:01] that
[52:03] in one of those cases Saul was right in
[52:05] the cave with him instead of taking the
[52:07] weapons and killing him and taking care
[52:09] of his problem his weapons were prayer
[52:11] amen his rep weapons were songs praise
[52:14] God
[52:15] right just like Hezekiah and you know
[52:17] the prophecy came back against all the
[52:20] many not many nights but I can't
[52:21] remember which ones it was
[52:23] but the the the way to get victory was
[52:25] to praise the Lord and as they praise
[52:27] the Lord God fought for them praise God
[52:31] amen
[52:32] there's no cave so dark or so deep but
[52:35] he may out of it send up our prayers and
[52:37] our souls in prayer to God in other
[52:39] words there's no trial so hard that
[52:41] you've gone through where it's not too
[52:43] low enough where God won't hear your
[52:45] prayer if you call it out to him praise
[52:47] God
[52:48] there's no cave too deep where God
[52:50] doesn't hear the prayer
[52:51] remember the Bible said he's with you in
[52:53] heaven he's with you in hell praise God
[52:55] your lowest spot
[52:58] he says he calls this prayer Mass skill
[53:00] now there's a lot of Psalms called Mass
[53:01] skill and it seems to be a Psalm of
[53:03] instruction so David's writing this song
[53:05] to instruct us because of the good
[53:07] lessons he learned in the cave the
[53:10] lessons he learned praying on his knees
[53:12] which he desired and teach others so
[53:14] this is a a Psalm that will teach us how
[53:17] to pray teach us how to complain when
[53:18] things don't go our way
[53:20] okay
[53:22] now let's read this whole chapter verse
[53:23] 1.
[53:25] let me get there I'm sorry there it is
[53:27] look at verse one
[53:31] mascale of David a prayer when he was in
[53:33] a cave I Cried unto the Lord with my
[53:35] voice with my voice unto Lord did I make
[53:37] my supplication I poured out my
[53:39] complaint before him I showed before him
[53:41] my trouble
[53:43] so he's in a cave he's in distress he
[53:45] wants us to teach people and he's got to
[53:47] complaint
[53:49] now look I showed him my trouble
[53:52] I told God all of my trouble now if
[53:55] David's a man after his own heart or
[53:57] after God's Own Heart and tells God all
[53:59] of our troubles then let's be encouraged
[54:01] we can tell God all of our troubles
[54:03] don't hold any trouble back sell them
[54:05] all your troubles praise God
[54:08] well doesn't the Bible say we have not
[54:10] because we ask not
[54:12] see
[54:13] pour all of it out
[54:15] you know God can do something amazing we
[54:17] didn't expect God can he can do great
[54:19] things praise God
[54:21] so we see the complaint verse three now
[54:23] here's where we start to see the wisdom
[54:25] when you complain when you complain
[54:27] remember God knows what you're going
[54:29] through
[54:31] when my spirit was overwhelmed within me
[54:33] then thou knewest my path
[54:36] see there it is you knew my path
[54:38] when I was overwhelmed you know what was
[54:40] going to happen next God knew
[54:43] so this is to instruct us when we're
[54:45] overwhelmed God knows the next answer
[54:48] God knows what's coming around the bend
[54:50] God knows the next turn praise God
[54:53] in the way wherein I walked have they
[54:55] privately laid a snare for me so David
[54:57] says I know there's traps out there but
[55:00] God knows my path Hallelujah
[55:03] Church remember we talked about that
[55:04] we're either in a temptation
[55:06] right we just got out of a Temptation or
[55:08] we're coming up to another Temptation so
[55:10] Church there's snares that we're going
[55:12] to come to eventually
[55:14] right so let's remember no matter no
[55:16] matter what we feel when we're
[55:17] overwhelmed God knows all about it God's
[55:19] going to bring us through it praise God
[55:21] tell God all about it what does this
[55:23] feel like what does this trap look like
[55:25] tell God all about it
[55:27] but no God is going to bring you through
[55:29] it praise God
[55:33] look at verse 4. here he's alone
[55:35] I looked on my right hand and beheld
[55:37] there was no man that would know me
[55:40] oh where's my right hand man where's
[55:42] where's Jonathan he's not there
[55:45] now for us that are married where's my
[55:48] wife well she's not there to help me in
[55:49] this time where's my husband he's not
[55:51] there to help me in this time it's just
[55:53] you and God
[55:54] praise God
[55:56] David's Bender
[55:57] and the church said
[56:00] he's looking for a strong man where's my
[56:02] mighty man when I need him where's that
[56:03] Mighty Guy
[56:04] he's not there
[56:06] it's all alone
[56:10] Refuge failed me so I had no protection
[56:12] I had if there was no place I could go
[56:15] to find peace or comfort
[56:18] no man cared for my soul ever feel like
[56:21] that nobody cares about me remember
[56:25] nobody cares for me where's all my
[56:27] friends where's all the church at
[56:31] David could have said where's the
[56:32] prophet where where's the priest where
[56:34] where's all my helpers where's my dad
[56:35] where where's my brothers where's my
[56:37] mighty Brothers they're so much greater
[56:38] than me so much bigger than me where's
[56:40] everybody at
[56:42] see it's okay to tell God the conditions
[56:45] that you feel
[56:48] it's okay to tell them
[56:51] verse five and six I cried into the Lord
[56:54] unto thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my
[56:56] refuge and my portion the land of the
[56:58] living amen my portion attend unto my
[57:00] cry for I am brought very low deliver me
[57:03] from my persecutors for they are
[57:05] stronger than I I'm weak and I'm low
[57:08] look at that what a condition to be in
[57:11] I don't feel strong in today's service
[57:15] I don't feel strong today facing what I
[57:17] gotta face
[57:19] I feel low I feel discouraged I don't
[57:21] feel like I'm on the Mountaintop anymore
[57:23] that's when God wants to hear your
[57:25] prayer praise God
[57:28] I'm low I'm weak verse 7. bring my soul
[57:31] out of prison that I am I pray that I
[57:33] may praise thy name the righteous shall
[57:35] Compass me about for Thou shalt deal
[57:38] bountifully with me so here we see
[57:39] request hear receive Faith here we see
[57:42] hope praise God God's going to deal with
[57:45] me graciously praise God I'm going to
[57:47] come out of this and God's going to
[57:49] bless me I just got to get through it
[57:51] see so here's it's so here's here's what
[57:53] we learn tell God all the situation tell
[57:56] God all the problems tell them every
[57:58] single one
[57:59] but then at the end take hope and
[58:02] remember he knows what you're going
[58:03] through he's going to bring you out and
[58:05] you're going to be better after the
[58:07] trial praise God
[58:08] your spiritual life is going to be more
[58:10] Bountiful I'm going to have more joy
[58:12] after I get out of this
[58:14] I'm gonna have more Thanksgiving I'm
[58:16] going to have more long-suffering once I
[58:17] get done with this praise God
[58:20] but it's okay to be discontent Lord I'm
[58:21] not happy with this I look around
[58:22] nobody's with me I'm low I'm weak things
[58:26] are falling apart but I know you're
[58:28] going to bring me out of this I know
[58:29] it's just a season hallelujah thank God
[58:33] this too shall pass right those famous
[58:35] words
[58:36] Glory
[58:38] brother man was talking about job's wife
[58:40] and job's wife trying to convince him oh
[58:42] and then his friends were his three
[58:43] friends his miserable comforters were
[58:45] coming to discourage him and they said
[58:47] job you might as well make a confession
[58:48] because you've sinned because God
[58:50] wouldn't let him righteous man be
[58:52] tormented like that now think about what
[58:53] we just read with David he's all alone
[58:55] he's being hunted down he's got a bounty
[58:57] on him he's low he's weak no friends
[59:00] nobody's there
[59:02] but God does let a righteous man be
[59:04] tormented like that
[59:06] now I'm not talking about devil torment
[59:08] that's a devil possession is a different
[59:09] thing fear hath torment that's a demon
[59:12] possession
[59:13] right or that's a complex where someone
[59:15] won't let a demon Spirit leave their
[59:17] mind and it needs to get cast out that's
[59:19] what I'm not talking about I'm talking
[59:20] I'm not talking about that I'm talking
[59:21] about trials you go through
[59:24] right and you're trying to keep the
[59:25] faith you're trying to be strong you're
[59:27] trying to be a faithful Christian
[59:29] God does let us go through torment see
[59:31] that that things happen to us because we
[59:34] sin but sometimes it's testing a saint
[59:36] instead of chastening a sinner okay
[59:42] so sometimes it's a test praise God
[59:44] and remember I read that verse I read
[59:46] that on uh Romans Romans 8 on Sunday
[59:49] nothing shall separate us from the love
[59:51] of God how many still believe that
[59:52] praise God
[59:54] and remember again that means God's love
[59:56] is going to let some people go through a
[59:58] famine God's love is gonna let some
[1:00:00] people be persecuted
[1:00:02] some people die by the sword or face a
[1:00:04] gun
[1:00:05] God's love is going to do that but God's
[1:00:07] love will never forsake them praise God
[1:00:10] like brother Adam said God was with
[1:00:11] Jonah and the ship in the whale God's
[1:00:14] with you if the swords pointing at you
[1:00:16] or the gun's pointing at you God's still
[1:00:18] with you praise God
[1:00:20] God's with you if there's no food on
[1:00:21] your table
[1:00:23] right or there's no money in your bank
[1:00:24] account God's still with you praise God
[1:00:28] it may be a test and nothing can
[1:00:31] separate us from the love of God
[1:00:34] now this here's the source of my article
[1:00:37] or a source of my sermon I come across
[1:00:38] as I just typed in you know David's
[1:00:41] prayers of complaint and it's a
[1:00:42] beautiful article beautiful now this
[1:00:44] article says about one-third of the
[1:00:46] Psalms are laments which is like
[1:00:49] Lamentations Jeremiah wrote that book
[1:00:51] right
[1:00:52] or passionate grief or sorrow now don't
[1:00:54] don't answer yes or no don't say
[1:00:55] anything out loud but does that match
[1:00:57] your life a third of your life
[1:00:59] I hope not
[1:01:01] I don't think it matches my life
[1:01:03] because God has really blessed us in
[1:01:04] America and God's given us a real
[1:01:06] spiritual lovely Church
[1:01:08] now the hardest times in my life maybe
[1:01:09] my wife and I would agree probably is
[1:01:11] when we had difficult people in the
[1:01:12] church that had evil spirits on them
[1:01:14] that's been the hardest times of my life
[1:01:17] since I came on the message
[1:01:19] right but isn't that interesting out of
[1:01:21] 150 Psalms
[1:01:22] 50 of those are about lamenting and and
[1:01:25] complaining and expressing grief you
[1:01:28] know praying about enemies praying about
[1:01:29] trials passion griefs passionate griefs
[1:01:32] all these troubles all these Hard Times
[1:01:34] a third of them
[1:01:37] think of that a third of your life
[1:01:40] or just think every three years so if
[1:01:42] 2022 is good and 2020 was good well 2020
[1:01:45] was probably bad for everybody do that
[1:01:47] 2020 was that lament here
[1:01:50] okay so then
[1:01:51] 2021 would be good 2020 uh so 2021 good
[1:01:56] 2022 2023 is going to be bad every three
[1:01:59] years
[1:02:01] that's the ratio that we're given here
[1:02:03] in the Psalms but of course that doesn't
[1:02:04] apply
[1:02:06] but just uh just take it as a
[1:02:08] perspective David went through 13 years
[1:02:11] maybe of running from Saul
[1:02:14] was it Joseph two years in prison if I'm
[1:02:16] not mistaken
[1:02:17] two years in prison yeah
[1:02:19] the baker
[1:02:21] forgot about him for two years was it
[1:02:23] Baker yeah
[1:02:25] for the butler
[1:02:27] the baker was saying okay brother okay
[1:02:28] thank you is that right honey
[1:02:34] you always give me the right answer
[1:02:35] right
[1:02:37] so think about that a third of them
[1:02:40] difficult times David went through
[1:02:43] you know either way we still got we have
[1:02:45] still reasons to praise the Lord right
[1:02:47] either way we should find reasons to
[1:02:49] pray that's why I love that song we
[1:02:50] still got a reason to praise no matter
[1:02:51] what trial we're going through
[1:02:53] God still wants us to praise His name
[1:02:56] Hallelujah to teach us and teach us to
[1:02:58] look past You Know Have Eyes of Faith
[1:03:01] right eyes of Faith program says like
[1:03:03] egos can look up and they can see a mile
[1:03:04] away
[1:03:06] right we ought to be able to look up by
[1:03:07] faith we ought to be able to look up and
[1:03:09] look at this Bible and this Bible These
[1:03:10] Wings of the Bible ought to raise us up
[1:03:12] and we can see beyond our trials
[1:03:14] although it's but even but when you're
[1:03:16] in the midst of it yes tell God all
[1:03:17] about it that's that's that's quality
[1:03:19] time for you and God talking right
[1:03:22] that's quality time in your relationship
[1:03:23] with your dad your father your spiritual
[1:03:25] father
[1:03:26] tell them all about your troubles like
[1:03:28] that song says let's have a little talk
[1:03:30] with Jesus tell them all about our
[1:03:31] troubles praise God
[1:03:33] that's what David did I poured all of it
[1:03:35] out to God
[1:03:36] and he heard My Cry
[1:03:40] no just have your Bibles ready here
[1:03:42] um this article I just copied this no
[1:03:44] the the article just gave the the the
[1:03:46] the the chapters I'm gonna actually read
[1:03:48] the verses so go to since we're there go
[1:03:50] to Psalm 140 verse 10. we see anger in
[1:03:53] this Psalm anyone ever been angry before
[1:03:55] and just uncontrollable
[1:03:58] David wrote a song about anger
[1:04:04] and now here's how you see he's angry
[1:04:10] now in verse 1 Deliver Me O Lord from
[1:04:12] the evil man preserve me from the
[1:04:13] violent man
[1:04:15] now I'm going to skip down to verse 8.
[1:04:18] Grant now oh Lord the desires of the
[1:04:20] wicked further not his Wicked device
[1:04:22] lest they exalt themselves say la as for
[1:04:25] the head of those that Compass me about
[1:04:26] let the Mischief of their own lips cover
[1:04:29] them now here's verse 10 let burning
[1:04:31] coals fall upon them think about that
[1:04:34] that's anger right there I want fire to
[1:04:37] fall on these enemies
[1:04:39] that's called indignation that's called
[1:04:41] wrath let burning coals they're going to
[1:04:43] be they're going to die right burning
[1:04:45] coals fall on them
[1:04:48] sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah in one
[1:04:50] way let them be cast Into the Fire throw
[1:04:52] my enemies into a fire
[1:04:57] can anybody relate to anger issues right
[1:04:59] David could say Amen
[1:05:01] I've got some real anger issues David
[1:05:04] help me brother right
[1:05:08] and throw them into deep pits that they
[1:05:10] rise not up again I never want to see
[1:05:12] this person again Lord throw them in the
[1:05:14] deepest pit so I never see that person
[1:05:15] again
[1:05:22] so there you go
[1:05:24] there you see some anger
[1:05:26] a song about anger
[1:05:31] did God still love David
[1:05:33] we showed you two we showed you on
[1:05:34] Sunday God took David's sins and put him
[1:05:36] behind his back
[1:05:38] I'm not going to show you these David
[1:05:40] because this is the evil you've done but
[1:05:42] I'm gonna I'm gonna be merciful I'm
[1:05:43] gonna take it out of your side and my
[1:05:45] sight
[1:05:49] I'm gonna put your anger
[1:05:54] fear Psalm 69 verse 3.
[1:05:56] now again you can read these whole
[1:05:58] chapters I kind of want to get through
[1:06:00] this thought I'd like to be done it's
[1:06:01] almost eight o'clock already wow
[1:06:03] psalm 69.
[1:06:06] verse 3.
[1:06:09] Psalm of David
[1:06:12] now look at this Save Me O God for the
[1:06:14] waters that are come into my soul ever
[1:06:15] seen ever seen a car
[1:06:17] sink in water
[1:06:19] how the water just rushes into there
[1:06:21] that's what David said my soul's like
[1:06:22] that just like water trials pouring in
[1:06:26] I'm filling up with stress and and
[1:06:28] distress and anger and fear
[1:06:31] it's just pouring in
[1:06:36] I sink in deep mire anyone ever had any
[1:06:38] dreams of sinking I've had lots of
[1:06:40] dreams of sinking or drowning
[1:06:45] where there's no standing I cannot get a
[1:06:48] foothold to stand on in this trial right
[1:06:51] I am coming to deep Waters where the
[1:06:53] floods overflow me I'm weary of my
[1:06:56] crying my throat is dried my eyes fail
[1:06:58] while I wait for my God
[1:07:01] I've cried so much
[1:07:04] I'm tired of crying right verse 13.
[1:07:08] but as for me my prayers unto thee O
[1:07:10] Lord an acceptable time o God in the
[1:07:11] multitude of thy mercy hear me in the
[1:07:14] truth of thy salvation so see he
[1:07:16] expresses his most hard trials but then
[1:07:18] he says Lord my prayers still coming to
[1:07:21] you praise God
[1:07:23] see I'm complaining I'm discontent about
[1:07:25] all this going on it's floods of Trials
[1:07:28] are coming in but my prayer is still
[1:07:30] going to you
[1:07:32] verse 30.
[1:07:36] I will praise thy name I'm sorry the
[1:07:38] name of God with a song and will Magnify
[1:07:40] Him with Thanksgiving
[1:07:43] Hallelujah
[1:07:44] see it's the fear I'm sinking
[1:07:47] and those are some of the worst dreams
[1:07:48] right I was telling my I'm telling
[1:07:51] somebody I just had another dream I was
[1:07:53] in the band I'm driving my kids in the
[1:07:55] van and we got coach going up this
[1:07:57] little Hill and acacia's like Daddy you
[1:07:59] can't make it I'm like I can make it up
[1:08:00] the hill I haven't gone off Hills like
[1:08:02] this before
[1:08:03] but as I got on the hill got steeper and
[1:08:05] steeper until I got perfectly 90 degrees
[1:08:07] and I'm like and I just got to the spot
[1:08:09] where I'm just starting to come down I'm
[1:08:10] like uh girls
[1:08:12] and I woke up I didn't feel good when I
[1:08:14] woke up
[1:08:16] that's fear beer
[1:08:19] I'm sinking
[1:08:21] there's no bottom so that doesn't sound
[1:08:23] like Satan in the millennium he's
[1:08:25] casting a bottomless pit
[1:08:27] sinks for a thousand years right
[1:08:30] fear
[1:08:31] these are these are feelings and
[1:08:34] experiences we battle
[1:08:36] but he said in the midst of that fear
[1:08:37] while I'm sinking my my voice will call
[1:08:40] unto God hallelujah and God will hear my
[1:08:43] prayer
[1:08:45] how about confusion Psalm 102 verse 1.
[1:08:48] ever been confused why is this happening
[1:08:51] what what what what is God doing here
[1:08:54] what's going on
[1:08:55] this was not in my schedule
[1:08:59] I didn't schedule this
[1:09:03] Psalm 102 verse 1. hear my prayer oh
[1:09:06] Lord and let me Let My Cry come unto
[1:09:09] thee
[1:09:10] let's go down to verse 12 and 13. like I
[1:09:12] said I could read all of it but it just
[1:09:14] takes too long but thou O Lord shall
[1:09:16] endure forever and thy remembrance unto
[1:09:18] all generations Thou shalt arise and
[1:09:19] have mercy upon Zion for the time
[1:09:22] for the time to favor her yea the set
[1:09:25] time is come
[1:09:29] praise God
[1:09:30] so confusion
[1:09:32] I might have wrote that one down wrong
[1:09:34] oh yeah I'm sorry I was verse two y'all
[1:09:36] started there hide not thy face from me
[1:09:37] in the day when I am in trouble incline
[1:09:40] thine ear unto me in the day when I when
[1:09:42] I call answer me speedily
[1:09:45] I mean that may not be the one church so
[1:09:47] I'm sorry but I'll get to one for sure
[1:09:49] that has one the song We sang I told
[1:09:51] Malachi we're going to sing Psalm 42
[1:09:53] loudest praise because that chapter is
[1:09:55] full of questions right it's full of
[1:09:57] confusion where is God
[1:10:00] right so yeah I'm sorry that may be been
[1:10:03] the wrong chapter
[1:10:05] desolation now this is striking Psalms
[1:10:08] Psalm 22 this is of course the chapter
[1:10:10] of Jesus crucifixion
[1:10:12] David by Vision experienced the
[1:10:14] crucifixion as far as we know David's
[1:10:17] bones were never broke David's bones
[1:10:18] never stared at him it was prophetic of
[1:10:21] Christ's death on the cross
[1:10:23] psalm 22.
[1:10:25] my God my God why Thou forsaken me none
[1:10:28] of us can ever pray that
[1:10:31] now you could pray this Lord I feel like
[1:10:33] I'm forsaken but you never were
[1:10:37] but it's okay to tell God your feelings
[1:10:38] and the church said you understand it's
[1:10:40] okay to say I feel like that it's okay
[1:10:42] I'm having some of these symptoms
[1:10:45] like I feel like I'm drowning but you
[1:10:46] really are not drowning right you know I
[1:10:48] feel like I'm forsaken but I'm really
[1:10:49] not forsaken
[1:10:51] tell God your feelings
[1:10:53] why are thou so far from helping me look
[1:10:56] think about that I don't feel close to
[1:10:58] God God feels A Million Miles Away
[1:11:02] and from the words of my roaring he's
[1:11:04] roaring
[1:11:05] shouting screaming
[1:11:10] now
[1:11:12] verse 6 he said but I am a worm and no
[1:11:14] man look how low he is I am a worm and
[1:11:17] no man
[1:11:18] this is total desolation have you ever
[1:11:21] thought that I'm worse than an animal
[1:11:23] I'm just a worm
[1:11:24] you ever thought that I've never got
[1:11:26] there
[1:11:27] now I've looked at my sin and I've
[1:11:28] looked at my shortcomings I think well
[1:11:30] I'm I'm nothing I thought that before
[1:11:32] but he's so just he's so desolate he
[1:11:35] said I'm a worm I'm not even a man
[1:11:39] and yes this is David a king a man after
[1:11:42] God's Own Heart
[1:11:45] verse seven let's go there for the king
[1:11:47] trusteth in the Lord and through the
[1:11:49] mercy of the most high he shall not be
[1:11:52] moved
[1:11:53] now go down to verse 24.
[1:11:55] I'm sorry I'm in the wrong I was in the
[1:11:57] wrong yeah I'm in the wrong chapters
[1:11:58] forgive me
[1:12:01] Psalm 22. I read the wrong verse
[1:12:03] Psalm 22 7 I'm sorry I was reading
[1:12:05] chapter 21 verse 7. forgive me so I'm 22
[1:12:07] 7. all they that see me laugh me to
[1:12:10] scorn
[1:12:11] they shoot out the lip they shake the
[1:12:13] head saying he trusted on the Lord that
[1:12:16] he would deliver him let him deliver him
[1:12:17] sing he delighteth him
[1:12:19] now look you have two things there
[1:12:22] the people the the Sinners know God
[1:12:25] didn't answer David yet and then they
[1:12:27] mock him so he's got a double trouble
[1:12:30] they know he's cried out to God they've
[1:12:32] heard David pray God didn't answer yet
[1:12:34] it wasn't an instant miracle
[1:12:36] which most prayers are instant Miracles
[1:12:38] right
[1:12:40] right and then now they start mocking
[1:12:42] him
[1:12:42] they pile it on top of him
[1:12:46] now the closest I've ever had is that
[1:12:48] when I played college football and we
[1:12:49] would visit another school and they
[1:12:51] would mock me and they'd say look at you
[1:12:54] know they look look at these guys you
[1:12:55] guys stink and you got they'd Mock and
[1:12:57] make fun of us of course they do it on
[1:12:59] online all the time too I get on YouTube
[1:13:01] all the time too
[1:13:02] um
[1:13:03] just total mocking and and you know one
[1:13:07] time a guy I was never forget at Miami
[1:13:09] Ohio there was probably 20 or 30 000
[1:13:11] people there I don't know I was you know
[1:13:14] doing sports with them the whole game of
[1:13:16] football and he walked up he said you
[1:13:17] blankety blanket he blank you don't even
[1:13:19] belong on the practicing on the practice
[1:13:21] team is the worst players on the team so
[1:13:23] he's saying you're the worst of the
[1:13:24] worst and I thought I had a pretty good
[1:13:26] game that game actually but he was
[1:13:28] cussing me out I looked at him I was
[1:13:30] already Christian I said you know what
[1:13:31] Jesus loves you
[1:13:33] and he literally he was talking he just
[1:13:36] went like this and walked away
[1:13:38] so he must have been raised in church
[1:13:40] and he knew better
[1:13:42] I was like where are you at now bro
[1:13:45] I said Jesus loves you that's all I said
[1:13:47] I had enough just like David I in the
[1:13:50] midst of that trial that was a very
[1:13:51] small trial all so I can think of was
[1:13:53] Jesus I didn't want to curse him back I
[1:13:55] I want to bless people I don't want to
[1:13:56] curse people
[1:14:01] desolation now David's in Desolation
[1:14:03] verse 24. for he hath not despised nor
[1:14:06] abhorred the Affliction of The Afflicted
[1:14:08] now look at that God is Not despised nor
[1:14:10] abhorred the Affliction of The Afflicted
[1:14:13] in other words God's allowing you and us
[1:14:16] to be afflicted
[1:14:18] neither hath he hid his face from him
[1:14:20] God's not hiding his face from you but
[1:14:22] when he Cried unto him he heard him
[1:14:25] praise God
[1:14:27] so God heard me when I cried he just
[1:14:29] didn't answer me when I wanted him to
[1:14:34] I don't know if I'm gonna have time to
[1:14:35] get to okay let's go quickly here let's
[1:14:36] go to repentance Psalm 51 you're
[1:14:37] familiar with this one after Bathsheba
[1:14:40] same with Bathsheba and Uriah
[1:14:42] verse 1 have mercy on me o God according
[1:14:45] to thy loving kindness
[1:14:47] now look he just murdered a man
[1:14:49] right committed adultery he said ask me
[1:14:52] for mercy and he thought about God's
[1:14:54] loving kindness
[1:14:56] I'm a murderer I'm an adulterer but
[1:14:58] God's loving
[1:15:00] according unto that multitude of thy
[1:15:02] Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:15:04] transgressions
[1:15:05] Wash Me throughly
[1:15:07] from my iniquity and cleanse me from my
[1:15:09] sin for I acknowledge my transgressions
[1:15:11] and my sin is ever before me
[1:15:14] now go down to verse
[1:15:17] say verse 8. make me to hear joy and
[1:15:19] gladness that the bones which thou has
[1:15:22] broken May Rejoice now look at this
[1:15:24] God didn't do anything wrong
[1:15:26] David's the one who murdered
[1:15:29] but David makes it feel like my bones
[1:15:31] have been broken now I've broken just
[1:15:33] one bone one time I think it was more
[1:15:35] more of a ligament
[1:15:37] and I could I could I couldn't move my
[1:15:39] shoulder
[1:15:41] and David said you've broken my bones
[1:15:43] yet David's the guilty one
[1:15:45] yeah right who's had a broken bone
[1:15:46] before
[1:15:47] actually I fractured my lumbar so yes I
[1:15:49] have had another fracture yeah
[1:15:53] and there's there's no other times I
[1:15:55] broke or have been hurt those have been
[1:15:56] the worst pains ever fractured vertebrae
[1:15:59] broken bone it was sticking up like this
[1:16:02] out of my skin there
[1:16:03] I heard a crack heard it snap and I
[1:16:06] couldn't even move it and David's saying
[1:16:08] my sin has caused me to feel like I have
[1:16:11] broken bones in other words like I'm
[1:16:13] paralyzed
[1:16:15] right and David says you've broken my
[1:16:17] bones well it's it's the conviction of
[1:16:20] the holy spirit that he feels praise God
[1:16:21] and thank God that God did that thank
[1:16:24] God he could feel that praise God
[1:16:27] but it wasn't God that did that it was
[1:16:29] God's convicting power but David brought
[1:16:30] it upon himself
[1:16:34] I just want you to see that that's what
[1:16:35] repentance should feel like God I'm
[1:16:37] broken
[1:16:39] restore the joy so see in the midst of
[1:16:42] complaining
[1:16:43] remember ask God restore my joy restore
[1:16:46] my strength amen take not your Holy
[1:16:49] Spirit from me let the Holy Spirit
[1:16:50] follow me again Hallelujah amen
[1:16:54] disappointment whoever who's ever had a
[1:16:55] disappointment Psalm 74 verse 1.
[1:17:03] Psalm 74 verse 1.
[1:17:06] Mass skill of asaph
[1:17:08] oh God why hast thou cast us off forever
[1:17:11] look at that he feels like God's
[1:17:14] forsaken our whole church
[1:17:16] why does thine anger smoke against the
[1:17:18] Sheep of thy pasture so he feel he feels
[1:17:22] God is angry with us and God has totally
[1:17:24] left all of us
[1:17:27] I'm disappointed
[1:17:28] so I got a typo there verse 10 and 11.
[1:17:32] oh God how long shall the adversary
[1:17:34] reproach shall the enemy blasting thy
[1:17:36] name forever why withdraw thou thy hand
[1:17:40] even thy right hand pluck it out from
[1:17:41] thy bosom you've taken your hand from me
[1:17:45] right I don't see your power how long
[1:17:48] that's quite a question how long do I
[1:17:50] have to wait God
[1:17:52] disappointment
[1:17:54] I didn't think God would have to wait
[1:17:56] this long
[1:17:58] it's okay to tell God that
[1:18:01] just end it with some praise and
[1:18:02] thanksgiving
[1:18:04] Hallelujah just end it with some I know
[1:18:06] you heard me Lord
[1:18:08] I know you're there
[1:18:10] I know it's going to get better
[1:18:11] eventually but it's really hard to go
[1:18:12] through this
[1:18:14] and then depression you know David was
[1:18:15] depressed I think this was David Psalm
[1:18:17] 88 verse 3.
[1:18:18] last one then we'll move on to
[1:18:20] another Psalm here
[1:18:26] this is a song or psalm for the sons of
[1:18:28] Korah
[1:18:29] it doesn't say David okay
[1:18:31] but anyways verse 3.
[1:18:33] Psalm 88 verse 3 4 5. sorry
[1:18:37] for my soul is full of troubles talk
[1:18:39] about depression
[1:18:41] I'm full I'm not full of testimonies I'm
[1:18:45] full of trouble
[1:18:46] I got nothing to testify right now
[1:18:49] have you ever been in that condition
[1:18:49] where I ask people to come testify and
[1:18:51] you don't have anything to testify about
[1:18:53] never felt like that that's how this
[1:18:55] writer's feeling
[1:18:57] all I got is trouble I have nothing to
[1:18:58] say that's good
[1:19:02] and my life draweth nine to the Grave I
[1:19:04] feel like I'm gonna die I feel like
[1:19:06] death is knocking up at my doorway
[1:19:09] verse 4 I am counted with them that go
[1:19:12] down into the pit I am as a man that
[1:19:15] hath no strength
[1:19:17] free among the dead like the slain that
[1:19:19] lie in the grave whom now remembers no
[1:19:21] more and they are cut off
[1:19:23] from thy hand
[1:19:25] thank God verse 7.
[1:19:27] thy wrath life hard upon me and thou has
[1:19:30] Afflicted me with all thy waves Sila
[1:19:35] okay so we're gonna get to that pretty
[1:19:37] soon here a waves David calls it waves
[1:19:39] it's one wave after another right one
[1:19:42] wave after another
[1:19:45] I feel depressed because it's just one
[1:19:47] wave after another
[1:19:49] one breaker after another
[1:19:52] all right go to Psalm 42 let's read
[1:19:54] through this whole chapter very short
[1:19:55] this is the one we sang about today how
[1:19:57] many know that
[1:19:59] everybody's all happy and rejoicing
[1:20:01] right that song
[1:20:02] that's because the song ends with the
[1:20:04] loudest praise right I'm going to give
[1:20:05] him the loudest praise
[1:20:10] verse 1.
[1:20:12] and two as the heart panted after the
[1:20:14] water Brooks so my or so panteth my soul
[1:20:16] out for the old God so I'm longing for
[1:20:19] God my soul thirst is for God for Living
[1:20:21] God When shall I come and appear before
[1:20:22] God so the question is when
[1:20:25] God I'm hungry for you but when am I
[1:20:27] going to have the spirit poured out on
[1:20:29] me like we've been preaching
[1:20:31] when I'm hungry for Revival and the
[1:20:34] church said
[1:20:36] but when when is it
[1:20:40] well
[1:20:41] I'll just let you know ahead of time God
[1:20:42] doesn't tell him when
[1:20:45] God expects him to wait
[1:20:47] church God expects us with weight
[1:20:51] verses three and five so look at these
[1:20:53] questions it's okay to pray these
[1:20:54] questions when God
[1:20:56] where and why
[1:21:00] verse 3 my tears have been my meat day
[1:21:02] and night while they continually send to
[1:21:04] me where is thy God
[1:21:06] when I remember these things I pour out
[1:21:07] my soul in me for I had gone with the
[1:21:09] multitude I went with them to the house
[1:21:11] of God with the voice of joy and praise
[1:21:13] with a multitude that kept holding down
[1:21:15] think about that he's going to church
[1:21:17] everybody's happy but he's not
[1:21:21] he's pouring out a soul God they're so
[1:21:23] happy I'm not so happy
[1:21:26] verse five why are thou cast down on my
[1:21:29] soul all these people are rejoicing and
[1:21:30] I'm not rejoicing
[1:21:32] and why are thou disquieted in me hope
[1:21:34] thou in God for I shall yet praise him
[1:21:36] for the help of his countenance amen
[1:21:39] it's okay to say I'm hungry for God I
[1:21:41] want God to pour it out but when is it
[1:21:43] going to happen where is it going to
[1:21:44] happen and why hasn't it happened yet
[1:21:46] praise God
[1:21:48] everybody else seems happy everybody
[1:21:49] else seems like they're on cloud nine
[1:21:51] and they're rejoicing they're on the
[1:21:52] Mountaintop when am I going to get to
[1:21:54] the Mountaintop
[1:21:56] it's okay to pray this unto God
[1:21:58] it's okay to say God I'm discontent when
[1:22:01] is it going to happen
[1:22:03] where is it going to happen
[1:22:06] verse 6 and 7. and if he come to see me
[1:22:10] he speak of vanity I was disarming the
[1:22:12] wrong chapter again man I keep jumping
[1:22:13] over the wrong time oh my God my soul is
[1:22:16] cast down Within Me therefore will I
[1:22:17] remember thee from the land of Jordan
[1:22:18] unto the land I'm saying uh
[1:22:21] and of the hermanites from the hill
[1:22:23] mizar deep cough unto deep at the noise
[1:22:27] of thy water spouts all thy waves and
[1:22:29] thy Billows are gone over me
[1:22:33] okay so we see at least two meanings
[1:22:34] here brother random uses the spiritual
[1:22:36] meaning of like this he says like the
[1:22:39] Deep calling to the Deep the noise of
[1:22:41] thy water spouts in David in other words
[1:22:42] if there's a deep in here calling
[1:22:44] there's got to be a deep out there to
[1:22:45] respond to that call
[1:22:47] in other words how many believes that
[1:22:49] you'd like to have a closer walk with
[1:22:50] God raise up your hand all right Harmony
[1:22:51] believes that he's God's A Healer raise
[1:22:53] up your hand well now if you've got
[1:22:54] something new telling you that there's
[1:22:56] got to be something out there to respond
[1:22:57] to that crave
[1:22:59] so that's how brother M uses it in the
[1:23:01] spiritual longing a deep inside of you
[1:23:04] call us out to God so there's got to be
[1:23:06] a deep to respond
[1:23:09] that's one way to apply this but there's
[1:23:11] another way to apply it
[1:23:14] it's the application of waves that just
[1:23:17] come over you right trials deep calls
[1:23:20] and deep in other words the Deep sound
[1:23:22] of one wave that's what the Bible says
[1:23:24] Billows look at this billows
[1:23:27] there in verse 7.
[1:23:29] all thy waves and thy Billows are gone
[1:23:31] out for me so these these Billows these
[1:23:33] waves have voices
[1:23:34] and they speak trial after trial
[1:23:38] and it's deep calling unto deep right
[1:23:41] it's trial after trial
[1:23:43] that's what David's saying this is
[1:23:45] coming over me I want to be happy with
[1:23:47] every church but I'm going through
[1:23:48] trials
[1:23:50] and deep causing the Deep each of these
[1:23:52] waves calls it another one it's like
[1:23:54] calling saying more in church don't you
[1:23:56] know that's how Ways work just one after
[1:23:58] another praise God
[1:24:00] David's saying my trials are unending
[1:24:02] they're difficult trials where are you
[1:24:05] God
[1:24:07] one wave seems to speak to the other
[1:24:09] send another child send another way send
[1:24:11] another wave
[1:24:15] this is David's life
[1:24:18] and there's noise there's voices to
[1:24:20] these water spouts there's voices to
[1:24:21] these Billows these strong waves
[1:24:25] verse 8 yet the Lord will command his
[1:24:27] loving kindness in the daytime so the
[1:24:29] trials feel like wave after wave but
[1:24:31] then he's convinced God's love will
[1:24:33] return
[1:24:35] and in the night his song shall be with
[1:24:37] me and my prayer unto the god of my life
[1:24:42] what are Breakers Breakers are heavy sea
[1:24:44] waves
[1:24:46] we felt like the waves now I've only
[1:24:48] been out in the ocean a few times twice
[1:24:51] when I was in college we went on to
[1:24:52] Florida on spring break and did some
[1:24:54] Habitat for Humanity there's a couple
[1:24:56] times I almost drowned because I didn't
[1:24:58] understand the waves
[1:24:59] you go out there and you swim out there
[1:25:01] and you try not to get bit by jellyfish
[1:25:03] or whatever
[1:25:05] and there's a couple times I wasn't
[1:25:06] ready for the wave I come up by the
[1:25:08] ocean I wasn't ready and knocked me over
[1:25:10] and I got a whole mouthful of salt water
[1:25:12] that's the nastiest stuff you're ever
[1:25:14] going to taste
[1:25:15] and I I felt I just got knocked over I
[1:25:18] just wasn't ready for it
[1:25:20] and David's saying that's what my trials
[1:25:22] are like
[1:25:24] breaker after breaker Billow after
[1:25:26] Billow knocking me over
[1:25:29] I think we took Lydia out in the
[1:25:31] Atlantic one time I think
[1:25:33] she don't remember that well maybe she
[1:25:36] does she got a good memory
[1:25:38] verse 8 9.
[1:25:41] so we see God's loving kindness but look
[1:25:43] in verse 9 I will say unto God my rock
[1:25:45] why hast thou forgotten me see look it's
[1:25:48] still a good testimony God's my rock but
[1:25:50] why
[1:25:51] I know God's a rock I know God's my
[1:25:54] Foundation I know God's my strength but
[1:25:56] why
[1:25:58] why have you forgotten me why do I go
[1:26:00] mourning because of the oppression of my
[1:26:02] enemy why am I the one morning
[1:26:05] why look in this chapter we have when
[1:26:07] where why
[1:26:10] all these questions
[1:26:13] do you think God's afraid of your
[1:26:14] questions
[1:26:15] of course not
[1:26:16] does God want to hear your questions
[1:26:19] God don't expect us to be super
[1:26:21] Christians all the time
[1:26:23] that's kind of like a cliche
[1:26:25] yes we want to have Supernatural
[1:26:27] strength and Faith but we don't have it
[1:26:29] all the time
[1:26:30] in those moments it's okay to be honest
[1:26:32] with God verse 10 and 11 let's finish
[1:26:34] this here
[1:26:37] as with a sword in my bones my enemies
[1:26:39] reproach me while they say daily unto me
[1:26:42] where is thy God
[1:26:43] I thought you're a Christian I thought
[1:26:44] you prayed I thought God heard your
[1:26:46] prayers
[1:26:48] verse 11. why are why art thou cast down
[1:26:51] O my soul and why art thou disquieted
[1:26:54] Within Me
[1:26:56] hope thou and God for I shall yet praise
[1:26:58] him who is the health of my countenance
[1:27:00] and my God see there's questions where
[1:27:03] why how but at the I love at the end of
[1:27:06] the song he says but yet there will come
[1:27:08] a time when I will praise God
[1:27:10] God won't leave me desolate God won't
[1:27:13] leave me in this this isolated condition
[1:27:15] God won't leave me here and it's okay to
[1:27:17] pray and tell God about that it's okay
[1:27:19] to express your discontent this doesn't
[1:27:21] feel right where's where's the Revival
[1:27:23] where's the answer to my prayer why is
[1:27:25] this happening
[1:27:27] a man of God expressed that and he but
[1:27:29] he ends it by saying I know God will
[1:27:31] bring me out of it praise God
[1:27:35] I'm almost done here I think
[1:27:37] here's another one where brother Adam
[1:27:38] says when the Deep calls into the deep
[1:27:40] it takes more than joining a church
[1:27:41] takes more than shaking hands with the
[1:27:43] preacher it takes more than living a
[1:27:44] good straight life it takes something to
[1:27:46] satisfy inside of you that pours down
[1:27:48] from God into the soul see that's what
[1:27:49] we need here tonight we all need to love
[1:27:52] God and worship God until we're
[1:27:53] satisfied in our soul praise God
[1:27:56] to get out of the Mind battles get out
[1:27:58] of the trials to overcome uh the waves
[1:28:01] that Rush In And forget about that for a
[1:28:03] while and let God satisfy our soul he
[1:28:06] said the Deep calls to the Deep he says
[1:28:08] at the noise of thy water spouts O Lord
[1:28:10] the Deep calleth to the Deep Amen Let
[1:28:13] God cry out to God for satisfaction and
[1:28:15] God will satisfy your soul praise God
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:20] Proverbs so I'm done with the Psalms
[1:28:22] here now just for a few moments we'll
[1:28:23] try to finish up here
[1:28:25] I love this verse
[1:28:27] leina wait a wicked man against the
[1:28:29] dwelling of the righteous spoil not his
[1:28:31] resting place
[1:28:33] for a just man Flawless seven times
[1:28:37] and Rises up again
[1:28:40] but the wicked shall fall into Mischief
[1:28:41] Now what's the meaning of seven well
[1:28:42] seven means what
[1:28:44] completion
[1:28:46] so a just man falls completely
[1:28:50] ever completely embarrass yourself
[1:28:54] at least I got some laughs
[1:28:56] I didn't get any amens
[1:28:59] of course we've all embarrassed
[1:29:00] ourselves at times this means you just
[1:29:02] you you completed the uh the actions of
[1:29:06] following right you've just you messed
[1:29:08] up
[1:29:09] you've done wrong
[1:29:10] a just person does this
[1:29:13] right adjust one because this is showing
[1:29:16] a contrast here's a just person a say
[1:29:19] person and here's a lost person
[1:29:21] the the same person does fall seven
[1:29:23] times
[1:29:25] sometimes we make a complete failure of
[1:29:27] ourselves
[1:29:28] we embarrass ourselves completely
[1:29:31] but we never stay down
[1:29:35] we never stay embarrassed
[1:29:37] because we know there's a sacrifice to
[1:29:39] take away our embarrassment
[1:29:41] praise God
[1:29:44] we don't stay that way
[1:29:46] but we feel that way
[1:29:49] I love it see but the wicked Fallen to
[1:29:52] Mischief in other words they get
[1:29:54] addicted to a sinful lifestyle they
[1:29:57] don't rise up after they fall
[1:29:59] so they stumble and fall into their sin
[1:30:04] whether it's fear or like we said
[1:30:07] desperation anger desolation
[1:30:10] feeling abandoned alone
[1:30:13] they fall on that and they just remain
[1:30:15] in that they keep going over that then
[1:30:17] they get that takes them into a
[1:30:19] mischievous lifestyle or a sinful
[1:30:21] lifestyle but a Christian Falls and then
[1:30:23] he gets back up and says I'm not going
[1:30:24] to stay in that
[1:30:27] that's why I love coming to the altar or
[1:30:28] you can pray at your chair
[1:30:30] I love how you can get on your knees and
[1:30:32] spiritually you can cast it on God and
[1:30:33] you can raise up and say I'm walking out
[1:30:35] of here Victor
[1:30:37] I'm walking out of here not falling I'm
[1:30:39] walking out here rising up and I've got
[1:30:41] Victory praise God
[1:30:43] you fall seven times
[1:30:49] right
[1:30:50] so in other words a just man is battling
[1:30:53] to be just
[1:30:57] Hallelujah a righteous person battles
[1:31:00] seven times to be righteous
[1:31:03] Hallelujah
[1:31:04] if you finish the verse remember God
[1:31:06] will not let allow me to come into a
[1:31:09] Mischief or addiction
[1:31:10] Hallelujah
[1:31:12] Hallelujah
[1:31:14] if I say an evil word against somebody
[1:31:15] and I Repent of it God's not going to
[1:31:17] let me be a gossiper
[1:31:19] right
[1:31:21] if I think a lustful thought God's not
[1:31:22] going to let me become an adulterer
[1:31:25] right right
[1:31:26] if I accidentally take something that
[1:31:28] doesn't belong to me God's not going to
[1:31:29] let me become a thief
[1:31:32] see God is gracious we fall but God puts
[1:31:36] in our heart to raise up praise God
[1:31:39] and not go on that path we won't go in
[1:31:41] the path of mischievousness right
[1:31:45] but we'll look where we are when we're
[1:31:46] down when we're down we should pray and
[1:31:48] say our discontent Lord I'm discontent
[1:31:50] with this and this I don't understand
[1:31:52] why where when how it's going to happen
[1:31:55] but I know I can I can pray and you can
[1:31:58] hear my voice praise God Amen thank God
[1:32:00] Amen
[1:32:02] because remember Church you're fighting
[1:32:04] the greatest battle ever fought against
[1:32:05] your worst enemy yourself your flesh and
[1:32:08] Satan
[1:32:09] right and demons powers of Darkness Paul
[1:32:13] said he did things he hated he hated the
[1:32:15] sins that he did
[1:32:18] brother random said I made thousands of
[1:32:19] mistakes in a year
[1:32:21] but he needed daily Revival I put that
[1:32:23] video out about the raspberry Revival
[1:32:25] and somebody was all self-righteous and
[1:32:27] they said I don't even know what you're
[1:32:28] talking about Revival I just walk with
[1:32:29] God every day I'm like well you
[1:32:31] apparently haven't been a Christian
[1:32:32] longer than two minutes
[1:32:34] okay maybe 10 minutes
[1:32:38] I said I feel sorry for you that's what
[1:32:39] I said I said I feel sorry for you did
[1:32:41] you know brother man I'm taught you need
[1:32:42] a Revival every day
[1:32:43] uh crickets no no reply
[1:32:45] see people just want to be critical oh
[1:32:47] you don't you don't know what it means
[1:32:48] to be revived
[1:32:50] you don't know what it means to be
[1:32:51] discouraged or depressed like David was
[1:32:55] to feel like you're sinking my life is
[1:32:56] sinking is going down what what's going
[1:32:58] to happen what's around the next corner
[1:32:59] what's going to happen next year
[1:33:02] you don't know what that's like but then
[1:33:03] God to give you hope and say it's gonna
[1:33:05] be okay praise God
[1:33:07] I said you haven't been serving God very
[1:33:09] long
[1:33:10] and it's my guess you've never been
[1:33:12] serving God because all those he loves
[1:33:15] he chastens
[1:33:18] he rebukes all those that He Loves
[1:33:21] so how could they be saved I don't know
[1:33:24] it's in God's hands God knows it's a
[1:33:26] spirit of Pride I think
[1:33:27] remember again Peter fell a righteous
[1:33:30] man falls seven times Peter fell into
[1:33:32] segregation
[1:33:33] and Jesus said you forgive your brother
[1:33:35] not seven times but 70 times seven
[1:33:40] now I want to end with this I think this
[1:33:42] might be the last thought yeah that's
[1:33:43] the last thought I want to close with
[1:33:44] this
[1:33:45] you know I just want to balance church
[1:33:46] this this idea here of
[1:33:48] yeah I was so blessing brother cam would
[1:33:50] come and preach I just want to just
[1:33:51] share this last thing here as we close
[1:33:53] here
[1:33:56] you know it's it's just what I've found
[1:33:57] as a Christian I need to balance feeling
[1:34:00] secure but also I gotta balance feeling
[1:34:03] humble as well
[1:34:05] right if we go to side if we go too far
[1:34:07] on the side of humility I'm nothing I
[1:34:10] fail I fall short every day
[1:34:12] that's false humility right humility is
[1:34:15] just like I'm under God and I'm going to
[1:34:16] follow God right that's humility I'm
[1:34:19] going to obey God today God I'm gonna
[1:34:20] trust God today I'm going to take God's
[1:34:22] way not my that's humility
[1:34:23] but see people getting a false humility
[1:34:25] oh I'm nothing I'm a failure I can't do
[1:34:28] anything that's a false humility
[1:34:32] but then also people can seem so secure
[1:34:34] that it becomes prideful
[1:34:39] like you've heard people say well I'll
[1:34:41] never struggle with that how can that
[1:34:42] person struggle with that and yet
[1:34:44] they'll come struggle with that a few
[1:34:45] years later
[1:34:46] don't say you won't church because
[1:34:48] you're going to find out you will
[1:34:52] like I love that scripture the Bible
[1:34:53] Jesus said you can rebuke Satan and say
[1:34:55] return no more into him but that doesn't
[1:34:58] mean he's not going to come back and
[1:34:59] knock on your door
[1:35:01] like I told you with all my addictions
[1:35:03] with tobacco or whatever even movies or
[1:35:05] sports like I'm free from them they're
[1:35:07] never coming back but they still come
[1:35:09] knock on my door
[1:35:11] you watch this game or do you wanna
[1:35:13] look I mean how many times how many
[1:35:15] times there's a there's a a cigarette
[1:35:18] just on just on the ground it's barely
[1:35:20] smoke it's barely even smoked and my
[1:35:22] flesh would be like oh
[1:35:24] pick that up and smoke it
[1:35:26] I would have done that when I was a
[1:35:27] sinner that's gross but I would have
[1:35:29] done that or I would have stole it from
[1:35:31] the store that's how awful I was I was
[1:35:33] awful rank sinner
[1:35:34] I'm just a sinner
[1:35:37] but see it's going to come back but I'm
[1:35:39] thankful Jesus said he'll enter no more
[1:35:41] into you praise God that don't mean he's
[1:35:43] not coming back he's going to come back
[1:35:44] but you got the right to say
[1:35:46] Satan you're kicked out and you're not
[1:35:48] coming in praise God
[1:35:51] so we got to balance this this false
[1:35:53] security
[1:35:54] with real security and we also have to
[1:35:56] have real humility not false humility
[1:35:59] and so when brother you know uh so we
[1:36:02] want to be we have to remember this
[1:36:03] again I look at look at it like your
[1:36:05] three parts of your being we're secure
[1:36:07] in our soul
[1:36:09] but we got to be humble in our spirits
[1:36:11] and our body
[1:36:13] I know it's very simple but in the same
[1:36:15] week cam after cam came I had a brother
[1:36:17] that uh
[1:36:19] he asked me
[1:36:21] he was so battling in his mind he's like
[1:36:23] uh
[1:36:24] it's like I don't even know if I'm saved
[1:36:26] you know I don't even know
[1:36:28] um
[1:36:28] I hear people say you know he said
[1:36:30] there's people in the church that talk
[1:36:32] so highly like they're never going to
[1:36:33] fall they never sin and I said brother I
[1:36:35] said brother Branham said he couldn't
[1:36:37] prove his name was on the Lamb's Book of
[1:36:39] Life
[1:36:40] he said God could use me as a tool for
[1:36:42] evil now look how humble that is he's a
[1:36:44] prophet he's seen thousands of visions
[1:36:47] but he says he's so still humble enough
[1:36:48] to say I can't prove my names in the
[1:36:50] Lamb's Book of Life and God could use me
[1:36:52] for evil
[1:36:54] he said because we're saved by faith
[1:36:58] right and so that's that's what I told
[1:37:00] the brother he said oh that helped me so
[1:37:02] much brother man was so humble in his
[1:37:03] mind in other words he never got so
[1:37:05] lifted up like I'm the greatest I'm the
[1:37:07] strongest nothing can ever touch me
[1:37:09] just give it a few years and a lot of
[1:37:11] things are going to come touching you
[1:37:13] a lot of Temptations are going to crawl
[1:37:14] up and try to try to tempt you
[1:37:20] right so the same week this brother's
[1:37:22] asking me
[1:37:24] how can I be humble you know or how can
[1:37:26] I even make it I said I don't even feel
[1:37:27] like in my mind so you got to be humble
[1:37:29] in your mind and then I love how brother
[1:37:31] cam came and preached
[1:37:33] to encourage us you know when we're when
[1:37:36] we're not as diligent or faithful
[1:37:37] brother Cam said as we are we got to
[1:37:39] remember I already was a son or daughter
[1:37:42] of God before the foundation of the
[1:37:44] world
[1:37:45] so that's the confidence you have to
[1:37:46] have you have to have that security
[1:37:49] that I I know I was chosen in Christ
[1:37:52] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:55] but yeah I got to be humble in my mind
[1:37:57] and say Lord let me keep my mind just
[1:37:59] focused on you
[1:38:02] we have to have both
[1:38:04] we're saved by grace through faith we're
[1:38:07] satisfied with Christ but we're seeking
[1:38:08] more of Christ
[1:38:10] how did I say to our feet praise God
[1:38:13] musicians can come
[1:38:21] so I hope by now by God's grace you
[1:38:22] understand how to complain like David
[1:38:24] did
[1:38:26] how to complain without getting into a
[1:38:28] sinful attitude
[1:38:38] in church I hope this was helpful to
[1:38:40] somebody by God's grace I I've just kind
[1:38:42] of been strangely pulled this way and
[1:38:46] I always wanted to preach on David's
[1:38:48] Psalms so and I didn't even get to all
[1:38:50] of them there's so many more where David
[1:38:51] is saying where are you God does God
[1:38:54] hear me
[1:38:55] I just thought this would be a nice
[1:38:57] encouragement
[1:38:58] if we're going through dark times if we
[1:39:00] feel like we're hiding in a cave if we
[1:39:02] feel like
[1:39:03] storms and Billows of Life are rushing
[1:39:05] into us
[1:39:06] trying to drown us there is hope
[1:39:11] Hallelujah
[1:39:13] there is Victory Hallelujah
[1:39:16] and as the Bible said God hears Us in
[1:39:19] every one of our prayers
[1:39:21] a just man falls
[1:39:24] seven times
[1:39:27] do you mean brother Jess you fall seven
[1:39:28] times I sure do
[1:39:32] but I don't I don't stay down
[1:39:35] we can't stay down we gotta rise up
[1:39:37] praise God
[1:39:39] Rise Up in Jesus name
[1:39:41] let's have a word of Prayer
