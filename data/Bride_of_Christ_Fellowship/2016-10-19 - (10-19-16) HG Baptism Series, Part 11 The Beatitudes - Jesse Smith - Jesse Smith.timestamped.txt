[25:11] how many want to be blessed and happy
[25:13] praise God Amen bless means the state of
[25:16] bliss the Beatitudes are the states of
[25:18] bliss that we can live in praise God the
[25:21] states of Happiness amen amen and church
[25:25] i' this week I was able to show some
[25:26] mercy to different individuals and I

[25:45] called the children of God verse 10
[25:48] blessed are they which are persecuted
[25:51] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[25:54] kingdom of heaven now I'll read 11 and
[25:56] 12 bless blessed are ye when men shall
[25:59] revile you and persecute you and shall

[27:22] so close to us Lord that you even live
[27:24] in US father help us this evening as we
[27:27] look at
[27:28] Beatitudes to see exactly why it was so
[27:31] important Lord why uh why you took the
[27:34] time to preach these things on the earth
[27:36] 2,000 years ago and yet Lord if if
[27:40] people would just live one of these out
[27:42] of these 10 just live one of them what a
[27:44] blessedness they would what a peace they
[27:46] would have that past all understanding
[27:48] Lord God so we thank you that we can
[27:50] live in these Lord and we just pray You'
[27:52] help us to manifest these in our lives
[27:54] Lord Through Your Grace lead us into
[27:57] Lord the character that would manifest
[27:58] these types of uh States Lord these
[28:01] types of conditions Lord and we know you
[28:04] do it because we ask and you said if you
[28:06] ask anything in my name I'll do it so
[28:09] Lord have your way have free course in
[28:11] our lives do it Lord in our lives
[28:14] tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the
[28:16] church said amen God bless you being
[28:18] seated praise
[28:20] God that was not going to cooperate
[28:22] let's just go right to the uh slides
[28:25] here tonight um so we want to look at
[28:27] again the Beatitudes by God's
[28:30] grace and uh remember this is the state
[28:32] of uh being having Bliss the state of
[28:36] having complete happiness praise God and
[28:39] we have it tonight in Christ Jesus any
[28:41] man or woman that's in Christ Jesus
[28:44] ought to have the Beatitudes in their
[28:45] lives they would by God's grace just
[28:48] like anyone who's baptized with the Holy
[28:50] Ghost has put on the full armor of God
[28:52] and they're a soldier on the front lines
[28:54] for Jesus Christ amen front line in
[28:57] their home front line in their family
[28:59] front line in the church front line in
[29:01] the job wherever they go they're on the
[29:03] front lines for Christ Jesus they're
[29:04] fighting for Christ amen so our text you
[29:07] know we we didn't read all that text but
[29:09] that is of course the the the uh
[29:12] recognized text of the Beatitudes so
[29:14] let's just quickly re review here by
[29:16] God's grace before we get into uh some
[29:19] of these other texts here tonight uh by
[29:21] God's grace the rest of the
[29:23] Beatitudes so we looked at on the first
[29:25] blessed are the poor in spirit
[29:27] now the poor in spirit inherit the
[29:29] kingdom of God Amen theirs is the
[29:33] kingdom of God it belongs to them so God
[29:36] is going to give uh the Kingdom of
[29:38] Heaven to those who are destitute or
[29:42] poor of the wealth of learning and
[29:44] education of schools God's gonna give
[29:47] the kingdom to those who aren't trained
[29:49] by man's Wisdom but by God's wisdom
[29:52] because it is the foolishness of
[29:53] preaching to save them that would
[29:55] believe amen it's foolishness now uh
[29:58] these scriptures are familiar to us I
[30:00] mentioned this John 7:15 we're not going
[30:02] to read these but the Bible said they
[30:04] looked at Jesus and said when has Jesus
[30:06] learned any letters God bless you
[30:08] Brothers uh when is when did Jesus go to
[30:10] school and learn any Hebrew uh they kind
[30:13] of rebuked him and Jesus just shook it
[30:16] off and that's what any Christian does
[30:17] any criticism they just shake it off now
[30:20] if it's real criticism and they need a
[30:21] rebuke the Christian appreciates that
[30:24] because the Bible said A wise man will
[30:25] love you if you rebuke him amen praise
[30:27] the Lord but Jesus was being unjustly
[30:30] criticized for not having going gone to
[30:32] school so it was just like water off a
[30:34] duck's back he just shook it off and he
[30:36] lived above the criticism that was on
[30:38] his life praise God brother Brandon when
[30:42] he preaches on the poor in spirit he
[30:44] mentions uh Mary out of Luke 148 let's
[30:47] read that by God's grace let's go to
[30:48] Luke 148 let's read that by the grace of
[30:51] the
[30:52] Lord and we'll see how Mary brother Ram
[30:55] said she was poor in spirit she was not
[30:58] a a wealthy woman in any in any stretch
[31:01] of the
[31:02] imagination uh she was just a a poor
[31:05] virgin girl we'd say a common Israelite
[31:08] girl and here's her own testimony I like
[31:11] I like and now notice the spirit is just
[31:13] anointed her praise the Lord and look at
[31:15] verse 46 Mary said my soul doth magnify
[31:19] the Lord amen and my spirit have
[31:23] rejoiced in God my
[31:25] savior verse 48 for he hath regarded the
[31:28] lowest state of his handmaiden for
[31:30] behold from henceforth all generations
[31:33] shall call me blessed so when the angel
[31:36] came to her and told her about the
[31:38] promise of God she started magnifying
[31:41] God she started rejoicing in God and she
[31:45] started thanking him for looking to her
[31:47] lowest State and if God has revealed
[31:50] anything to us we ought to thank him we
[31:53] ought to Magnify Him Praise the Lord
[31:55] anything at all now look she she
[31:58] manifested Christ uh In the Flesh she
[32:00] manifested the word in flesh we manifest
[32:03] the word in the spirit praise God Amen
[32:06] she birthed the natural word but we
[32:08] ought to birth the spiritual word praise
[32:10] God now don't get me wrong in the day of
[32:12] Pentecost she birthed the spiritual word
[32:14] as well she birthed both amen she had a
[32:17] birth of both the natural word and the
[32:20] spiritual word amen and her soul magnify
[32:23] God she rejoiced because she had a Sav
[32:27] amen and that's the promise that we have
[32:29] today so brother BR said she was the
[32:31] poor in spirit so hers would be the
[32:33] kingdom of
[32:34] God Amen you remember brother Bram had
[32:37] an interview with a newspaper reporter
[32:39] as a woman who was Catholic and she was
[32:41] uh reporting an evil report against
[32:43] brother R's Revival
[32:45] meetings and she was trying to criticize
[32:48] the shouting and the screaming and the
[32:49] crying some of you might remember the
[32:51] story and uh she said uh she said that's
[32:55] just a bunch of fanaticism
[32:57] and uh and brother Bram said no those
[33:00] people that are shouting and rejoicing
[33:02] he said will rule in heaven so she said
[33:06] if those kind of people that are
[33:07] screaming and making noise and praising
[33:09] God if they're going to rule in heaven I
[33:11] don't want to go brother BR said don't
[33:13] worry you won't go with that kind of
[33:15] attitude praise God and he said what's
[33:18] that little uh what's that little uh
[33:20] what do they call the Mary's prayer
[33:21] beads what do they call those Rosary he
[33:24] said what's that Rosary you got around
[33:25] your neck he said I'm cath she said I'm
[33:27] a Catholic I pray to Mary and he said
[33:29] let me tell you the very one you pray to
[33:31] she in order for her to go to heaven she
[33:33] had to get drunk in the spirit speak in
[33:36] tongues and praise God Amen before God
[33:38] would let her in heaven and he said you
[33:40] won't get into heaven unless you come
[33:42] the same way and brother said neither
[33:43] will we unless we come the same way
[33:46] Hallelujah by the baptism of the Holy
[33:48] Ghost a moment of birth a moment of
[33:51] freedom and worship and surrender and
[33:53] your life afterwards proves that you got
[33:56] the goods amen amen proves that you've
[33:58] got the Life of Christ amen uh Luke
[34:01] 16:23 I'm just going to read that
[34:02] because I don't remember that from my
[34:04] study so just bear with me I know I'm
[34:07] reviewing a little bit the blessed are
[34:09] the poor in
[34:11] spirit oh and this is the other one yeah
[34:13] this other one brother B reads he talks
[34:15] about the poor man Lazarus not the one
[34:16] that was raised from the dead but the
[34:18] poor man who had sores and begged and in
[34:21] hell he lifted up his eyes being in
[34:22] torments and seeth Abraham AAR off from
[34:24] Lazareth in his bosom brother Bram said
[34:27] the uh the the Lazarus was poor in
[34:31] spirit uh and look what happened to him
[34:34] although he was poor physically although
[34:36] he was poor and didn't have the riches
[34:38] like the the rich man he inherited
[34:41] eternal life praise God the kingdom
[34:43] belonged to him because he was poor in
[34:45] spirit now look now look at this church
[34:48] now make sure you catch this the right
[34:50] way but listen didn't the Bible say my
[34:52] seed will never beg bread how many know
[34:54] that right but wasn't Lazarus
[34:57] asking for crumbs that fell from the
[35:00] master's table and wasn't he
[35:02] saved praise the Lord didn't the Bible
[35:04] say if you honor God you live a long
[35:06] life upon the Earth but yet sometimes
[35:08] those that honor God God takes them
[35:11] early so what do we saying we saying
[35:14] that sometimes God has to let things
[35:15] happen in order to have a witness on the
[35:17] earth sometimes God uh does things a
[35:20] little different those promises are
[35:22] still true they're still true but what
[35:25] we have to see is that God sometimes
[35:27] does things a little out of the ordinary
[35:28] to try to get people's attention are you
[35:30] with me and he allows them to go through
[35:33] trials in this case to beg a little
[35:35] crumb to see if he wouldn't uh if Satan
[35:38] wouldn't try to discourage his faith you
[35:40] understand God allowed the trial to come
[35:42] praise the Lord amen Jesus died at 33
[35:46] did anybody ever live a more pure life
[35:48] than Christ he didn't even get the 70
[35:51] years that was promised in the Bible
[35:53] three score and 10 how many know the
[35:54] scripture in Psalms that was giv us
[35:56] three score and 10 he didn't even get
[35:57] half of that right but yet he lived the
[36:00] most Godly life so we understand we must
[36:02] understand that God works according to
[36:04] his will not to our will don't get me
[36:07] wrong if you're so poor you're you're
[36:08] begging bread you cry out to God and say
[36:10] God you promis and watch God come on the
[36:12] scene and and give you food amen
[36:15] hallelujah if he allows us to go through
[36:17] a little suffering in our lives so be it
[36:20] if we suffer for righteousness sake
[36:21] happy are we the Bible says amen now
[36:25] acts 4:13 that's the apostles after
[36:27] they' raised the crippled man the Bible
[36:29] said who are these ignorant unlearned
[36:31] men but the Bible said they've been with
[36:33] Jesus why because the power of Jesus
[36:35] rested upon them amen hallelujah so
[36:39] blessed are the poor in
[36:41] spirit blessed are they that mourn
[36:44] number two because they will be
[36:46] comforted now I'm taking this uh the way
[36:50] of the Holy Ghost that's the way I'm
[36:52] taking the morning the mourning over sin
[36:54] the morning for the Holy Ghost now two
[36:55] weeks ago we read Ezekiel 9 verse4 how
[36:59] God said I'll put a mark upon all those
[37:01] who sigh and cry for the Abominations
[37:03] done the city blessed are those who
[37:06] mourn over sin that's the approach I'm
[37:08] taking uh with this scripture now you
[37:10] can take it blessed are those who mourn
[37:12] you know when when when the when
[37:13] righteous people die and so forth and
[37:16] they're sorrowful no doubt God Will
[37:18] Comfort them amen but I think don't you
[37:19] think the more important one is those
[37:21] who mourn to get the Holy Ghost don't
[37:23] you think so I would think that's more
[37:25] important because that's eternal life
[37:27] praise God that's uh the Rapture that's
[37:30] the first resurrection that's the
[37:31] Millennium amen all that is involved in
[37:35] the Born Again experience I think that's
[37:37] a little more uh of more importance than
[37:41] just uh mourning for people or
[37:43] Christians when they die which is good
[37:44] God Will Comfort you but I'm taking
[37:46] comfort as the comfort of the Holy Ghost
[37:48] now let's read John 12:24 because I did
[37:50] not read this on Sunday like I said Just
[37:53] A Brief Review maybe 10 or 15 minutes by
[37:55] God's grace
[37:58] John
[38:00] 12:24 verily verily I say un you except
[38:03] a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[38:05] die it abideth alone but if it die it
[38:07] bringeth forth much fruit praise God
[38:10] brother random uses this scripture you
[38:12] must die to your will your own will
[38:15] before you can be born again and then
[38:17] you'll bring forth the fruit of the
[38:18] spirit hallelujah amen that's exactly
[38:21] right you must fully die out see you
[38:23] must mourn for your sin you must feel
[38:24] sorry for your sin that's what's so
[38:27] lacking today you don't see people
[38:28] repenting of their sin very often they
[38:30] just feel bad but they don't really
[38:32] repent and try to change their lives we
[38:34] must repent and try to change our lives
[38:36] amen and try to do different the next
[38:38] time because when the next Temptation
[38:40] comes if you obey you'll feel such a
[38:42] purity when you obey amen you'll feel a
[38:45] purified sensation my C or I should say
[38:49] that but somebody called me yesterday on
[38:50] the phone last night I was so happy to
[38:52] talk to them they they called just to
[38:54] thank me for just being a Christian they
[38:57] called just to thank me for the
[38:59] inspiration uh of just being a Christian
[39:01] and they said thanks for all your
[39:02] prayers and all over the years and and
[39:04] all the the life that your family lives
[39:06] they said they struggle with addiction
[39:08] for 30 some years and they said they
[39:11] prayed last night or the night before so
[39:13] is it was Monday night they prayed that
[39:15] they would wake up uh uh when Tuesday
[39:18] morning and be delivered from all their
[39:20] addictions now this is a person who
[39:21] would get high three times a day or go
[39:24] have cocaine three times a day and they
[39:27] were praying and and they said my
[39:28] sermons kept he only heard one a couple
[39:30] of my sermons and he said my sermons
[39:32] kept coming to his
[39:34] mind and the person don't even believe
[39:36] the message they just know that I
[39:38] believe the message and they've heard me
[39:39] preach one message sermon that's all
[39:41] they've ever heard me and they said he
[39:43] woke up on Tuesday morning and he was
[39:44] free and he and he went all through the
[39:47] day he said anoint of the Holy Ghost got
[39:48] a witness to numerous people and he
[39:50] called me just to thank me for the
[39:52] testimony that I held for Christ Jesus
[39:54] and he said don't you ever be
[39:55] discouraged if people you're not seeing
[39:57] the results he said you just keep living
[39:59] the life because even when I was
[40:00] addicted to cocaine and all these things
[40:02] and all these drugs he said I would
[40:04] still think of you I would still testify
[40:06] about Christians he said go hug your
[40:08] children tonight and he said go tell
[40:09] your wife you love her he said keep
[40:11] living for Jesus Christ amen amen I
[40:15] thought praise the Lord you know that
[40:18] you see we've got to die and I told him
[40:20] I said now that your house is cleaned
[40:22] out now that those demons are gone can
[40:23] you imagine 30 years of drug addiction
[40:27] and I said ow that your house is empty
[40:29] fill it with the word amen I said when
[40:33] God delivered me from my chewing tobacco
[40:34] which I never thought I'd get rid of
[40:36] that demon I never thought I never had
[40:37] the courage to think I'd ever get rid of
[40:38] it but once I did I gave myself fully to
[40:41] Bible study I cut off the football I cut
[40:43] off the TV I gave all myself two Sunday
[40:47] Services every Wednesday night studying
[40:50] the Bible every time there was a Bible
[40:51] study I was there and then pretty soon I
[40:53] was leading Bible study God just want so
[40:56] somebody that will serve him as a
[40:58] servant amen he said the Harvest is
[41:00] great but the laborers are few amen and
[41:04] I told him I said you make yourself like
[41:05] that and we'll see he didn't text me
[41:07] back today but I was uh telling him I
[41:09] said these are the steps you need to go
[41:11] to get rid of the football get rid of
[41:12] the TV get rid of the drugs get rid of
[41:15] all this and fill your life with the
[41:16] Lord Jesus Christ I said find the most
[41:19] faithful Bible teacher you know and go
[41:21] sit under them and beg them for the word
[41:23] of God and write down every scripture
[41:24] you know and fill your life with the
[41:27] word and watch if you don't transform
[41:29] into a new creature in Christ Jesus amen
[41:32] glory and he said well maybe I'll go see
[41:34] cam tomorrow night I said you
[41:36] better amen see blessed are those happy
[41:40] are those who lament and cry over their
[41:42] sin hallelujah amen for theirs they have
[41:46] their reward amen number three blessed
[41:49] are the meek the meek inherit the earth
[41:51] God will only let those rule the Earth
[41:54] who rule over sin right now now amen
[41:57] glory who are so humble and so Meek that
[42:01] they let God rule their lives right now
[42:03] that's the only person that God will let
[42:05] rule in the Millennium Glory so here's
[42:08] another way to put Meek these are the
[42:10] other definitions I read so blessed are
[42:12] those who are Meek who those who are not
[42:14] self-interested praise God they are not
[42:17] disputing against God's will they're not
[42:19] resisting God's will they just take
[42:21] everything is God's will unless it was
[42:23] their fault amen glory now there's many
[42:27] many scriptures the Bible said uh
[42:29] meekness is a fruit of the spirit so
[42:32] when you when you have a fruit of the
[42:33] spirit you're blessed because you'll
[42:35] continue to be me Meek and remember
[42:37] fruits don't come all the time they come
[42:38] in
[42:39] Seasons as you serve God longer longer
[42:42] I'm sure brother Jose would know he
[42:43] served God and sister beatric served God
[42:45] all these years I was I would imagine
[42:47] they've gone through seasons of their
[42:48] life where they can see fruits of
[42:50] longsuffering I used to not have this
[42:52] fruit I didn't used to see this fruit of
[42:54] being Meek but now I can see the
[42:56] meekness now I can actually see the
[42:58] fruit of God in my life want it make you
[43:00] happy church amen don't it make you
[43:02] happy when Harvest time comes and you
[43:03] got beautiful fruits there to harvest
[43:05] don't you like that glory amen that's
[43:08] how a Christian is you put in the time
[43:10] you put in the season you go through
[43:11] hard Seasons you go through rainy you go
[43:13] through droughts you go through
[43:14] snowstorms you go through freezes but
[43:17] you stay planted in Christ and in God's
[43:20] season you bring forth Holy Ghost fruit
[43:22] amen glory the Bible said when someone's
[43:26] wrong you got to have meekness to
[43:28] correct them so see you can't be
[43:30] interested in well you got to repent
[43:31] come to my church or it's got all about
[43:33] me you got to repent and pay your ties
[43:34] to me that's not the interest of a of a
[43:37] of a real Christian now you should go to
[43:39] church you should pay your ties but that
[43:41] can't be my interest well it's just more
[43:42] about me and more about getting my
[43:44] church bigger and it ain't my church
[43:46] it's God's church amen God can take me
[43:48] out and you should still move on and
[43:50] pray and get another Pastor in here amen
[43:53] and serve God with all your hearts but
[43:55] you correct me people with meekness the
[43:57] Bible says I want to read these other
[43:59] ones 1 Timothy 611 bear with me because
[44:02] uh for some reason I just can't remember
[44:04] some of these been a busy day by God's
[44:06] grace but uh we're in the right place
[44:09] now Hallelujah 611 but thou oh man of
[44:13] God got any uh men of God in here praise
[44:15] the Lord amen he said flee these things
[44:18] so a real Christian will run from the
[44:20] Love of Money this is the actual context
[44:22] we're talking about a real Christian
[44:25] runs the word world says oh he's tucking
[44:27] his tail like a no he's running
[44:29] away in wisdom he's running to the holy
[44:31] Prince of God and he's running away from
[44:33] demons that's real honorable that ain't
[44:36] a that's a real Christian praise
[44:38] the Lord flee evil run From Evil and run
[44:43] to
[44:44] Christ amen the name of the Lord is a
[44:47] strong tower right in a time of War
[44:49] would you say someone's a who runs
[44:50] in a tower for protection absolutely not
[44:52] I would say they're wise because they
[44:54] won't stand out there and just say shoot
[44:56] me or or get me with a bow and arrow or
[44:57] come slice me up no they they have
[45:00] protection and they use the protection
[45:03] that's a Christian amen he runs from the
[45:05] evil runs from uh Satan and he runs to
[45:08] Christ and he stands there and he's
[45:10] protected as long as he stays in the
[45:12] tower as long as he stays behind the
[45:14] name of Jesus Christ glory for thou man
[45:18] of God flee these things and follow
[45:20] after righteousness godliness Faith love
[45:23] patience and
[45:24] meekness follow that we should pursue
[45:27] that we shouldn't follow so many people
[45:29] on Facebook or Instagram or follow so
[45:32] many blogs we should follow Jesus Christ
[45:35] amen and follow people that do these
[45:37] things the Bible says fight the good
[45:39] fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life
[45:42] it's going to be a fight to lay a hold
[45:43] on of eternal life but it's the only
[45:45] thing worth fighting for
[45:48] Hallelujah where unto thou also called
[45:50] and has professed a good profession
[45:52] before many witnesses amen meekness now
[45:55] here's here's how you receive the word

[46:12] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[46:15] superity of naughtiness and receive with
[46:18] meekness the engrafted word which is
[46:20] able to save your Souls praise God so
[46:23] and this is how you receive the word at
[46:25] church with meekness which is I'm not
[46:27] interested in myself I don't care how
[46:29] hard it hurts when we preach against sin
[46:31] I'm not interested in me I'm interested
[46:33] in what God's doing praise the Lord and
[46:36] that's not I'm not interested in what I
[46:37] want I'm interested in what God wants
[46:39] for my life that's receiving the word
[46:41] with meekness yes I'll take that because
[46:43] that's God's word no matter what it says
[46:45] no matter how it corrects me or rebukes
[46:47] me or shows me I'm wrong I say Amen to
[46:50] that I believe that and God will help me
[46:52] to live it amen that's how you receive
[46:55] the word lay part all your sins confess
[46:57] all your sins when you come in that door
[47:00] right confess your sins as you come in
[47:02] that door say God forgive me I'm laying
[47:04] apart all naughtiness all filthiness all
[47:06] my mind battles all my sins all my

[47:27] 3:4 1 Peter 3:4 these are the people
[47:30] that are blessed on the earth it ain't
[47:31] the millionaires it ain't the rich guys
[47:32] it ain't the athletes it ain't the movie
[47:34] stars they're not blessed if they're not
[47:36] in Christ Jesus they're actually cursed
[47:37] the Bible says hallelujah they're cursed
[47:41] if they're not in Jesus Christ
[47:44] Hallelujah Jesus said very few rich
[47:46] people will even be saved it's so
[47:48] hard God God God be praised that we're
[47:51] not rich amen 1 Peter
[47:54] 3:4
[47:56] Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart in
[47:58] that which is not corruptible even the
[48:00] ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[48:02] which is in the sight of God a great
[48:03] price this is for our sisters sisters
[48:05] should Manifest this meekness as well a
[48:07] Meek and quiet Spirit praise God Meek
[48:11] and quiet so it's not a spirit that
[48:13] wants to uh exort its own interests oh a
[48:17] sister spirit is a spirit that's wants
[48:20] the interest of her husband because her
[48:22] husband's following Christ Jesus amen
[48:25] and she doesn't dispute against God's
[48:27] will through her husband she just
[48:28] accepts it and that's a Meek and quiet
[48:30] Spirit how many love the Lord amen
[48:33] blessed next number four blessed are
[48:34] they which hunger and thirst for
[48:36] righteousness for they shall be filled
[48:38] it's a blessing you're happy when you're
[48:40] hungering thirsting because you be
[48:42] filled with God's presence now I just
[48:43] want to show you the opposite this is
[48:45] clearly speaking of the baptism of the
[48:46] Holy Ghost clearly brother brah
[48:48] mentioned it everybody knows it by God's
[48:50] grace it's a blessing to even hunger for
[48:52] the Holy Ghost now go to Jude 1:12
[48:56] I just want you to notice this the world
[48:57] is hungry for everything else except God
[48:59] how many can say Amen to that they want
[49:02] they're hungry for everything else
[49:03] anything else anything other than Christ
[49:05] in the word they're hungry for that and
[49:08] the Bible said they'll be filled with
[49:09] all demons and wickedness and Powers
[49:11] that's what they're filled with but you
[49:13] and I aren't filled with that we're
[49:14] filled with righteousness amen we're
[49:16] filled with Holiness we're filled with
[49:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Jude
[49:21] 1:12 look at what there these uh people
[49:24] are filled with
[49:28] all right now go to verse 11 woe unto
[49:30] them for they've gone the way of Cain
[49:32] and ran greedily after the he of balam
[49:35] for reward so see they're greedy they're
[49:36] filled with
[49:37] greed and perish in the gain sayings of
[49:40] Kora these are spots in your Feast of
[49:42] Charity when they Feast with you feeding
[49:45] themselves without fear clouds that are
[49:48] without water carried about of winds
[49:51] trees whose fruit withth without fruit
[49:53] twice dead plucked up up by the roots
[49:57] Raging Waves of the sea foaming out
[49:59] their own shame wandering stars to whom
[50:02] is reserved the Blackness of Darkness
[50:03] forever look how look at that Cain
[50:06] remember Cain was a Wanderer he wandered
[50:08] from that place to that place to that
[50:10] place we need to find where God wants us
[50:12] God doesn't often give people wandering
[50:14] Spirits are you with me
[50:16] Church evangelists have a traveling
[50:18] Spirit but not a wondering spirit amen
[50:21] these are wondering Stars just trying to
[50:24] find some place but a real Christian
[50:26] knows where he's supposed to be amen he
[50:28] or she knows where God wants them amen
[50:31] well look they feed themselves without
[50:33] fear they'll sit in a church service
[50:35] right the Bible says among you there
[50:37] there spots in your Feast of Charity
[50:39] they'll feed themselves uh without fear
[50:42] and what are they feeding on Greed
[50:44] rewards Hees that's what they're feeding
[50:46] when they hear the preaching it's all
[50:48] about just giving the blessings the
[50:49] physical blessings is that right they
[50:52] have no character they're clouds Without
[50:54] Rain they have nothing to give out to
[50:55] anybody else but a real Christian has
[50:57] virtues to give out amen just like a
[51:00] flower has the nectar to give out
[51:02] Hallelujah to the be that's what brother
[51:04] Ram said that's what we should have
[51:05] virtues we should have such love and
[51:08] such a a giving and such a a power that
[51:11] we can give out what we have because we

[51:16] and so we can give out strength and
[51:18] virtue to other people amen you can be
[51:21] strong for other people hallelujah

[51:35] that I wonder how many churches are
[51:36] empty tonight because well they probably
[51:38] just have the party right there in the
[51:39] church that's what one of my churches
[51:41] used to do when I instead of just you
[51:43] know the tenants would go down during
[51:45] Super Bowl Sunday so they just had a
[51:46] Super Bowl party at the church what a
[51:48] rebuke what a rebuke that's not the way
[51:51] a Christian should live a Christian puts

[53:25] of hatred you despise everybody that
[53:27] don't agree with
[53:29] you you might be filled with a lot of
[53:31] nonsense too you might be filled with a
[53:33] lot of Arthur Arthur Godfrey's dirty
[53:35] jokes so much that you think to so much
[53:38] of that that you don't go to church on
[53:39] Wednesday night or something you might
[53:42] be filled with Elvis Presley's rock and
[53:44] roll that's true but you're filled with
[53:47] something and your own life Bears you
[53:50] record of what you're filled with by
[53:52] their fruits you shall know them you're
[53:53] filled with something you you might be
[53:55] filled with a bunch of laziness just too
[53:57] lazy to do anything about it well you
[54:00] don't have to try to be that you don't
[54:01] have to you don't have to be that way
[54:02] Christ died that you might be cleansed
[54:04] from all those things you might be
[54:06] filled with a bunch of Creeds you might
[54:08] be filled with a bunch of denominations
[54:10] but God don't want to be you to be
[54:12] filled with that God made a place in
[54:13] there to put himself in God wants you to
[54:15] be filled with himself what takes place
[54:17] when you're filled with God when you're
[54:19] filled with God you're filled with the
[54:20] Holy Ghost you're filled with what
[54:21] church power he says you're filled with
[54:25] love with joy with peace with
[54:27] longsuffering with goodness with
[54:29] meekness with gentleness and worship
[54:31] you're filled with joy and the church
[54:33] said that's you're fill with something
[54:35] tonight amen but we got to hunger for
[54:38] the right if we hunger for the word and
[54:41] hunger for Holiness and hunger for
[54:42] righteousness we'll be filled with it
[54:44] amen we just got to not be filled with
[54:47] the other thing we got to hunger and
[54:48] thirst more for God than the things of
[54:50] the world how many believe
[54:52] that he said you're filled with
[54:54] something well let me just finish that
[54:56] quote or you're filled with something
[54:58] and when you're filled with man's ideas
[54:59] if you're filled with church anity I
[55:00] don't want church enity I want
[55:01] Christianity if you're filled with Creed
[55:03] you're only building yourself a Babylon
[55:05] that's got to fall if you fill yourself
[55:06] with a modern world if you fill yourself
[55:08] up with lust if you fill yourself up
[55:10] with pride if you fill yourself up with
[55:12] denomination you're lost there's only
[55:14] one way to endure that is to put the
[55:16] original thing that God made that
[55:18] compartment in your heart to be filled
[55:19] with and that was the Holy Ghost amen
[55:23] beautiful praise the Lord
[55:25] all right next blessed are the merciful
[55:28] see I'm trying to go a little bit faster
[55:29] here but is that still good is it good
[55:31] to review these I would think so I would
[55:32] think it'd be powerful blessed are the
[55:34] merciful because they shall obtain mercy
[55:36] so this this beatitude uh is the on the
[55:40] beatitude of what you seow is what you
[55:42] reap this is specifically about sowing
[55:44] and reaping if you live a life of giving
[55:47] Mercy instead of judging somebody and
[55:49] damning them to hell or criticizing them
[55:51] and all these things without meekness
[55:53] and so forth like that
[55:55] the Bible says God will reward you and
[55:57] let Mercy return unto you all
[56:02] right now in Matthew 18:32 now none of
[56:05] these I remember so I'm just going to
[56:06] briefly read over these so pardon me
[56:08] because I don't think I actually
[56:09] mentioned these on Sunday Matthew 18:32
[56:13] let's look at that by God's grace
[56:15] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[56:16] be shown
[56:18] Mercy oh yeah this is the parable of the
[56:21] man who has forgiven the 10,000 talents
[56:24] I looked that up one time that was over
[56:25] a100 million in today's uh Society
[56:29] remember the king forgave him uh100
[56:31] million and then he found some that owed
[56:33] him only like a thousand or something
[56:35] like that and he wouldn't forgive him
[56:38] and the Bible said in verse uh 32 then
[56:41] the Lord then his Lord after he had
[56:43] called him and said unto him oh thy
[56:45] Wicked servant I forgave thee all that
[56:47] debt because thou desirest me should us
[56:49] not thou also have had compassion on thy
[56:52] fellow servants even as I had pity on
[56:54] the the praise God see pity and
[56:57] compassion it goes a long way praise God
[57:00] because he didn't give it he didn't get
[57:02] it you understand that because that that
[57:05] forgiven man didn't extend forgiveness
[57:07] to his his debtor God didn't forgive him
[57:10] and Jesus said if you don't forgive
[57:12] others he won't forgive you blessed are
[57:15] the merciful for God will show them
[57:18] Mercy praise God Luke
[57:21] 10:37 we must forgive I don't care what
[57:23] someone's done to you you can forgive
[57:25] them you can there might there always
[57:28] may be human feelings there but you can
[57:30] forgive them how many know that's the
[57:31] truth if Christ could forgive if if
[57:34] Stephen could forgive even those killing
[57:36] him we can forgive praise God because we
[57:39] have the same power Hallelujah not a
[57:41] different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy
[57:43] Ghost amen yes sir all
[57:47] right now this is the parable the Good
[57:49] Samaritan look at verse 37 and he said
[57:52] he that showed Mercy on
[57:53] him then said Jesus unto him go and do
[57:57] thou likewise remember the story the two
[57:59] Jews Jewish men passed it by uh but the
[58:02] Good Samaritan stops and he shows mercy
[58:05] and Jesus said who's they said who's my
[58:06] neighbor Jesus he said the one that
[58:08] showed
[58:09] Mercy praise God let's have let's have
[58:12] mercy on denominational people and the
[58:14] church said amen praise God because at
[58:17] one time guess what I was a
[58:18] denominational person yeah I hope nobody
[58:21] was persecuting me when I was in
[58:22] denomination because I came out I was
[58:25] one of his children amen come out from
[58:27] them my people I'm one of his people
[58:29] amen I came out of Babylon
[58:32] Hallelujah we shouldn't be unmerciful we
[58:36] should be merciful praise
[58:39] God the neighbor when you're a neighbor
[58:41] to someone you show Mercy to them even
[58:43] when they don't deserve it that's real
[58:45] Christianity right there show mercy and
[58:47] God will have mercy on you didn't Jesus
[58:49] say however you judge the situations
[58:51] that's how you'll be judged praise God
[58:54] that's right and the Bible says they
[58:56] judge themselves the Jews judge
[58:57] themselves Unworthy of everlasting life
[58:59] that's why God blinded them they judge
[59:01] themselves so their own judgments was
[59:03] what God used to judge them praise God
[59:07] all right now Luke
[59:09] 1:50 I like this is just an encouraging
[59:12] scripture this is what Mary's rejoicing
[59:14] yeah we almost read it and his Mercy is
[59:17] on all them that fear Him from
[59:19] generation to Generation Now what's fear
[59:21] again brother Austin you remember what's
[59:22] fear again to hate what evil that's one
[59:25] of the first things he quoted after a
[59:26] sermon God bless you sir to fear the
[59:29] lord is to hate evil but the Bible said
[59:31] God's Mercy is on them who fear the lord
[59:34] or those who hate
[59:36] evil so you put those pieces together
[59:38] now I must hate evil I must hate that I
[59:41] must hate evil and then God will have
[59:43] mercy upon me Glory second Timothy 1
[59:47] let's go there second Timothy
[59:49] 1:15 2 Timothy
[59:53] 1:15
[59:55] Let's Have Mercy that's why when people
[59:58] leave the message I never condemn them I
[1:00:00] you know I say that I give warnings and
[1:00:01] things like that but I never condemn
[1:00:02] them because I don't know what they're
[1:00:03] going to do I don't know where their
[1:00:05] Soul's gonna go I wouldn't want somebody
[1:00:07] condemn me if I made a mistake I want
[1:00:10] someone to show me
[1:00:11] mercy that's why I show Mercy to
[1:00:16] people 2 Timothy 1:15 and
[1:00:19] 16 look at this this is powerful this
[1:00:22] know I'm sorry this thou knowest that
[1:00:24] all they which are in Asia be turned
[1:00:25] away from me of whom are falous and
[1:00:32] hermogenes now did you catch that all
[1:00:34] the churches in Asia at the end of his
[1:00:36] ministry rejected him so one point
[1:00:38] brother Austin brother Benjamin this
[1:00:39] Prophet walked in there he did all these
[1:00:40] Miracles all the churches in Asia loved
[1:00:42] him he left he came back and they said
[1:00:44] the doors not open you can't preach in
[1:00:46] our church anymore and yet God had done
[1:00:48] all these Miracles amongst him and
[1:00:50] amongst them and they turned him down
[1:00:52] all the churches in Asia rejected him
[1:00:54] because every Prophet is always rejected
[1:00:57] is that right look at the next scripture
[1:00:59] though God shows Mercy Paul says God's
[1:01:01] going to show Mercy to one man in all
[1:01:03] this Asia the Lord give Mercy unto the
[1:01:06] house of onap
[1:01:09] forus for he ha of refreshed me he was
[1:01:12] not ashamed of my chain or the fact that
[1:01:15] he was in prison or a prisoner of Christ
[1:01:18] but when he was in Rome he sought me out
[1:01:20] very digly and bow me the Lord grant
[1:01:22] unto him that he may find Mercy the Lord
[1:01:24] in that day and in how many things that
[1:01:27] he ministered unto me at Ephesus thou
[1:01:28] knowest very well so while everybody
[1:01:31] else rejected him and turned down the
[1:01:32] preacher one man sought him out to find
[1:01:35] him say can I help you can I help you
[1:01:36] and Paul says may God have mercy on that
[1:01:39] one man who showed me mercy praise
[1:01:43] God blessed are the merciful for they
[1:01:46] shall obtain Mercy amen number six
[1:01:50] blessed are the pure in heart the pure
[1:01:52] in heart shall see God blessed are the
[1:01:54] pure in heart which means the blameless
[1:01:56] in heart there's no blame you can put on
[1:01:57] their lives they repented of everything
[1:01:59] they know also means genuine blessed are
[1:02:01] the genuine in heart what you hear them
[1:02:03] say in one room they say in another one
[1:02:06] praise God what what what what the way
[1:02:09] they treat one person is a same way they
[1:02:10] treat the other person they're pure in
[1:02:13] heart they're not defiled there's no
[1:02:15] mixture of sin and unbelief it's just
[1:02:17] love the love of God in their hearts
[1:02:19] amen I'm not I'm not going to spend much
[1:02:20] time on this because I want to get
[1:02:21] moving on by God's grace but these
[1:02:23] scriptures all about purification this
[1:02:25] one says Peter says if you obey you
[1:02:27] purify your heart I mentioned that
[1:02:28] earlier we read this one on Sunday all
[1:02:30] those who have the hope of seeing a body
[1:02:32] change and seeing Christ seeing his face
[1:02:35] the Bible said he purifies himself amen
[1:02:39] hallelujah thank you Jesus now blessed
[1:02:41] are the peacemakers now I think this is
[1:02:43] where we left off if I'm not mistaken
[1:02:44] the peacemakers if not forgive me
[1:02:47] peacemakers shall be called the children
[1:02:49] of
[1:02:50] God According To Jesus now I want you to
[1:02:54] know this God is the author of Peace
[1:02:57] that's what 1 Corinthians 14:33 says so
[1:03:00] whenever peace comes to a situation I'm
[1:03:02] talking about real peace Christ is the
[1:03:04] one who constructed that Christ is the
[1:03:07] one who created that Christ is the one
[1:03:09] who desired that Christ loves peace how
[1:03:11] many like some more peace in your
[1:03:13] homes how many like some peace on the
[1:03:15] job praise God how many like some peace
[1:03:18] in the church amen not Wars and not
[1:03:20] fightings and we want peace God is the
[1:03:23] author of Peace amen the ones who start
[1:03:25] wars not God
[1:03:27] Amen God loves peace amongst his
[1:03:29] children blessed are the peacemakers now
[1:03:31] of course there are times to balance us
[1:03:33] out yes where God starts where God
[1:03:35] brings out a war to bring forth a
[1:03:36] judgment like Joshua you know different
[1:03:38] ones like that Moses where they were
[1:03:40] kicking Sinners out of the promised land
[1:03:41] because they wouldn't repent by the
[1:03:43] Bible said the cup of the Wrath was
[1:03:45] filled up for the amorites and so they
[1:03:46] got to go in there and kick them out it
[1:03:48] was judgment time so that's why they had
[1:03:50] War but we're talking about peacemakers
[1:03:52] amongst the family of God Amen
[1:03:55] James uh 41 says that uh why where do
[1:03:58] Wars come amongst you because of the
[1:04:00] lust in your flesh that's why you have
[1:04:02] wars with this person that person this
[1:04:04] is why there's war and hatred and evil
[1:04:06] feelings between people because of lust
[1:04:09] praise God somebody lusts over something
[1:04:11] somebody wants something usually it's
[1:04:13] over physical desires or money or
[1:04:15] something like that right something
[1:04:16] along those lines some type of Pride or
[1:04:19] some power something like that that's
[1:04:21] where the wars come from let's read
[1:04:24] Romans 16:17 because I want to read this
[1:04:28] one sometimes the only way to have peace
[1:04:30] is to kick out the leaven out of the
[1:04:32] love in other words excommunicate people
[1:04:35] from the church sometimes that's the
[1:04:36] only way to have peace and the Bible
[1:04:39] says there are times for
[1:04:41] that when you when you go through all
[1:04:43] the steps Jesus said if there's someone
[1:04:44] Sinn against you go to them if they
[1:04:46] don't repent take somebody with you or
[1:04:47] two people with you they don't repent
[1:04:49] and take you to the church that's local
[1:04:50] that's called Church order church
[1:04:52] discipline and now look in in The Book
[1:04:54] of Romans
[1:04:56] 16 verse 17 the Bible says now I beseech
[1:04:59] you Brethren mark them which cause
[1:05:01] divisions and offenses contrary to the
[1:05:04] doctrine which you have learned and
[1:05:05] avoid them so this must line up with
[1:05:08] what Jesus said if somebody's dividing
[1:05:09] the church or somebody's dividing the
[1:05:11] family somebody's dividing the home that
[1:05:13] shouldn't be we need peace in the church
[1:05:15] don't we we need peace we need love we
[1:05:17] need Mercy forgiveness all these things
[1:05:19] we need God amongst us but if there
[1:05:22] comes a time when someone won't repent
[1:05:23] of dividing people and dividing homes
[1:05:26] and churches the Bible said they can put
[1:05:28] them away now look at Verse 18 why do
[1:05:30] people divide and cause Wars It's
[1:05:32] because they're serving themselves they
[1:05:34] have become their own
[1:05:36] God that's what verse 18
[1:05:38] says for they that are such serve not
[1:05:42] our Lord Jesus Christ but what do they
[1:05:44] serve their own
[1:05:46] belly when people start wars with the
[1:05:49] wrong intentions and lust and fights
[1:05:51] between people they have become their
[1:05:53] own God it's self- worship because it's
[1:05:55] their way it's Pride praise God pride
[1:05:58] has risen up in them and they become
[1:06:00] their own God they're serving themselves
[1:06:02] it's all about me there's no meekness in
[1:06:04] that is there there's no meekness
[1:06:06] there's no humility it's Pride it's
[1:06:09] greed it's a power struggle it's
[1:06:11] hungering for uh things of the world the
[1:06:15] the the three Temptations the pride of
[1:06:17] life the lust of the eyes and the lust
[1:06:19] of the flesh
[1:06:20] amen glory but how do they do it let's
[1:06:24] 18 how they do it with good words my and
[1:06:28] fair speeches deceive the hearts of the
[1:06:30] simple so they're just so uh so kind
[1:06:33] with their words and so deceptive and
[1:06:34] all these things like that make sure we
[1:06:36] stay with the word of God stay with the
[1:06:39] doctrine that you've been taught can you
[1:06:41] Church Say Amen the doctrine brother
[1:06:43] Bram taught I I try to teach the same
[1:06:45] very Doctrine he taught anything that's
[1:06:47] contrary to that get it out of the
[1:06:49] church tell us tell me about it we must
[1:06:52] do that we must stay with the doctorine
[1:06:54] that God has given to us amen blessed
[1:06:57] are the peacemakers amen for they uh I'm
[1:07:01] sorry what was I'm sorry what was that
[1:07:03] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:07:04] shall be called the children of God so
[1:07:06] God's children are known for making
[1:07:08] peace amen number eight we're getting
[1:07:11] there by God's grace we're getting there
[1:07:12] slowly but
[1:07:13] surely blessed are they which are
[1:07:15] persecuted for righteousness sake not
[1:07:18] for your sin sake but for righteousness
[1:07:21] sake you did something righteous and
[1:07:23] people persecuted
[1:07:24] you my for theirs is the Kingdom of
[1:07:28] Heaven did you notice when you're
[1:07:30] persecuted or if you're poor in spirit
[1:07:31] did you notice you get the same reward
[1:07:33] both of them if you're poor in spirit
[1:07:35] what what's the reward theirs is the
[1:07:37] kingdom of heaven what's the reward for
[1:07:38] those who are persecuted there's the
[1:07:40] kingdom of heaven so there's something
[1:07:43] that goes along with just not Desiring
[1:07:45] man's Wisdom and also being persecuted
[1:07:47] there's some connection between those

[1:09:18] life you'll receive a crown amen a crown
[1:09:21] for being faithful despite being p cuted
[1:09:24] how many believe the Bible's true
[1:09:26] Hallelujah Malachi 2 Timothy 311
[1:09:33] sir
[1:09:37] soth praise God maybe I wrote down the
[1:09:39] wrong
[1:09:40] one second Timothy 3:11 maybe I wrote
[1:09:43] down the wrong thing I'm gonna go I'm
[1:09:45] gonna try 1 Timothy 311 that does just
[1:09:47] does sound
[1:09:49] right oh oh I'm sorry is it yeah did you
[1:09:52] do the different one that's okay
[1:09:55] buddy
[1:10:01] came what pers but out
[1:10:05] of Amen so all the persecutions Paul
[1:10:08] went through who delivered him the Lord
[1:10:10] delivered him who's going to deliver you
[1:10:12] when you get persecuted trust in the
[1:10:14] Lord and the Lord will deliver you when
[1:10:16] you get persecuted amen who delivered
[1:10:18] Israel out of the persecution of the
[1:10:20] taskmasters God sent a prophet amen God
[1:10:23] s us a prophet amen we've got the word
[1:10:25] of God the pillar of fire Hallelujah the
[1:10:29] Holy Spirit we're talking about will
[1:10:31] deliver you out of all your persecution
[1:10:33] stand for the word of God because Christ
[1:10:35] stood for us
[1:10:36] hallelujah number nine now this is the
[1:10:39] last one in this portion of scripture
[1:10:41] blessed are they which are reviled
[1:10:44] persecuted and spoken against falsely
[1:10:47] for Jesus he said for my sake so I just
[1:10:49] put it for jesus' sake why because the
[1:10:51] Bible said great is your reward reward
[1:10:53] in heaven let's go to 2 Corinthians 1
[1:10:56] we'll read that by God's
[1:11:00] grace second Corinthians 1
[1:11:09] verse3 I just thought I thought this was
[1:11:11] a nice portion of scripture here praise
[1:11:14] God
[1:11:18] Amen so perhaps God's allowing us to go
[1:11:21] through these because maybe we got some
[1:11:22] persecutions coming on
[1:11:24] don't fear it just cling to the Lord
[1:11:26] during that time sayl deliver me from my
[1:11:29] persecutors praise the Lord the spirit
[1:11:32] of Jesus Christ is the spirit of
[1:11:33] Prophecy praise God so perhaps there are
[1:11:36] persecutions coming we know it as far as
[1:11:38] the nation we know it's coming for the
[1:11:40] nation but I'm talking about in your
[1:11:41] personal life by God's grace second
[1:11:43] Corinthians 1
[1:11:45] verse3 blessed be the god even father of
[1:11:48] our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[1:11:50] mercies and the God of All Comfort who
[1:11:52] comfort in Us in all of our tribulation
[1:11:56] all the tribul let's say all ready all
[1:11:59] all your tribulation all your trouble he
[1:12:00] comfort you in all of it but the Holy
[1:12:02] Ghost is the
[1:12:03] comforter that we may be able to comfort
[1:12:06] them which are in any trouble now look
[1:12:09] now he goes to us you'll be comforted
[1:12:12] but then we will comfort those who are
[1:12:13] being troubled as well you see that we
[1:12:17] may be able to comfort sometimes God
[1:12:19] wants to use Amen to comfort somebody
[1:12:21] praise the Lord sometime God wants to
[1:12:23] use each one of us to comfort somebody
[1:12:25] else so you got to be a source of
[1:12:27] comfort got to be a source of strength a
[1:12:29] source of love a source of Mercy as
[1:12:31] we're talking about
[1:12:33] amen finishing verse four by the Comfort
[1:12:36] wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
[1:12:38] God Amen so see the only way you can
[1:12:41] Comfort somebody's el else is if you've
[1:12:43] experienced the comfort of God yourself
[1:12:45] Hallelujah and that's why many times you
[1:12:48] have to go through hard trials so you
[1:12:49] can help somebody who goes through the
[1:12:50] same trial praise God remember the story
[1:12:53] brother I told about praying for that
[1:12:55] baby that was sick it took another
[1:12:56] mother's Faith who could feel the pain
[1:12:59] of that mother with the suffering baby
[1:13:01] her baby had suffered and so she was a
[1:13:03] mother she knew what it felt like so she
[1:13:05] goes over and lays hands and the Holy
[1:13:07] Spirit says it was because of her prayer
[1:13:09] not because brother Rams she was already
[1:13:11] healed praise God but because she could
[1:13:13] relate to that the Bible said she could
[1:13:16] comfort she could pray for that baby
[1:13:17] because she felt that same Comfort
[1:13:19] amen that's right verse five as the
[1:13:23] sufferings of Christ abound in us so our
[1:13:27] consolation also aboundeth by Christ
[1:13:30] amen so even though we're suffering a
[1:13:33] lot Christ consolation or Christ Comfort
[1:13:36] is in US amen just like he was comforted
[1:13:39] by God Amen verse six and whether we be
[1:13:42] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[1:13:45] your salvation so if I go through hard
[1:13:47] trials guess what it's for your
[1:13:49] consolation praise God when you go
[1:13:51] through hard trials it might be for my
[1:13:53] my consolation you go through hard
[1:13:56] trials so that you can comfort and help
[1:13:58] other people praise God
[1:14:03] Amen which is effectual in the enduring
[1:14:06] of the same sufferings which we also
[1:14:08] suffer or whether we be comforted is for
[1:14:10] your consolation and your
[1:14:13] salvation so if somebody has a good
[1:14:15] testimony if God answered my prayer you
[1:14:17] know what you're supposed to share that
[1:14:18] with somebody so they can rejoice and
[1:14:19] know that God's gonna answer their
[1:14:21] prayer amen hallelujah you get a
[1:14:23] testimony you fill out one of those
[1:14:24] sheets put it right here on the pulpit
[1:14:26] so we can see it we that might Comfort
[1:14:28] somebody Church praise God that's what
[1:14:30] the Bible says right there when we get
[1:14:33] comforted it's for your comfort and your
[1:14:35] salvation amen that's why I shared that
[1:14:37] testimony about my cousin call last
[1:14:39] night amen because that ought to comfort
[1:14:41] you praise God people are watching your
[1:14:44] testimony people remember your Godly
[1:14:46] words I must have preached that sermon
[1:14:48] brother amen about seven years ago at
[1:14:50] brother Camp church and I didn't know
[1:14:52] the whole time my cousin sit there how I
[1:14:53] know he bring it up seven years later
[1:14:55] how do I know I don't know but what we
[1:14:57] got to do we got to leave footprints on
[1:14:59] the sands of time and people will see
[1:15:01] our lives and see our testimonies and
[1:15:03] the if we're salt and if we're light
[1:15:05] they'll want to be like us amen if we're
[1:15:07] real Christians they'll want to live
[1:15:09] like us amen hallelujah amen verse seven
[1:15:14] and our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[1:15:17] that as you are partakers of the
[1:15:18] suffering so shall ye be also of the
[1:15:21] consolation oh Hallelujah
[1:15:23] so if you partake of the hard stuffff
[1:15:25] you also partake of the Comfort amen for
[1:15:28] we would not Brethren have you ignorant
[1:15:30] of our trouble which came to us in Asia
[1:15:33] that we were pressed out of measure
[1:15:34] above strength in in as much that we
[1:15:36] desired even our life or despaired even
[1:15:38] our lives they were so comforted they
[1:15:41] actually were having despair about
[1:15:42] living it was hard to live verse nine
[1:15:46] but we had the sense of death in
[1:15:47] ourselves that we should not trust in
[1:15:49] ourselves but in God which raiseth the
[1:15:52] Dead
[1:15:53] who delivered us from so great a death
[1:15:56] and doth deliver in whom we trust that
[1:15:58] he will yet Deliver Us
[1:16:01] amen let's just stop right there by
[1:16:03] God's grace praise God okay now we've
[1:16:07] been through the nying Beatitudes but
[1:16:09] brother ran makes a statement in 19
[1:16:12] 19661 and he says he said there's a
[1:16:15] forgotten
[1:16:17] beatitude how many many know he said
[1:16:19] that he said that here's what he says he
[1:16:21] was typing Moses exact
[1:16:24] Moses type was a type of Christ and
[1:16:26] we're all acquainted with those types of
[1:16:28] what Moses was and what Jesus was
[1:16:30] teaching on the
[1:16:31] Beatitudes but this beatitude is on over
[1:16:34] in the 11th chapter and the sixth verse
[1:16:37] and if you don't watch you'll read right
[1:16:39] over the top of it and you won't get it
[1:16:41] it's wedged in between other words but
[1:16:44] it is a
[1:16:46] beatitude so let's go to Matthew 11 by
[1:16:48] God's grace let's go there I've never
[1:16:51] preached on this so uh it's fresh for me
[1:16:54] hope it's fresh for you by the grace of
[1:16:55] the Lord Matthew
[1:17:01] 11 now if you remember church if you
[1:17:03] remember the story here's the scripture
[1:17:07] let's all read that together ready one
[1:17:08] two three and blessed is he whosoever
[1:17:11] shall not be offended in me brother ra
[1:17:14] said this is another beatitude this is
[1:17:17] another state of Happiness this is
[1:17:19] another state of bliss when we're not
[1:17:22] offended in Christ
[1:17:24] Jesus you remember the story in the
[1:17:26] chapter
[1:17:27] 11 John the Baptist was put in prison
[1:17:31] and he brother ra said his eagle eyes
[1:17:32] got filmed over and he was he said Satan
[1:17:34] was trying to kill him and discourage
[1:17:36] him so he said he would talk to his you
[1:17:38] know his visitors in prison and he'd say
[1:17:40] go ask Jesus again is he the Messiah or
[1:17:43] not I don't know now he'd already said
[1:17:45] he already said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:17:47] who takes away the sin of the world he'd
[1:17:48] already said that he already had a
[1:17:50] revelation Church it shows how low we
[1:17:52] can go sometimes times when the devil
[1:17:54] puts a trial on us the very one he would
[1:17:57] testified had a vision of he's doubting
[1:17:59] a little while later because of all the
[1:18:01] hardships oh my aren't you glad for
[1:18:04] things like this in the Bible aren't you
[1:18:06] glad to know that these men were not
[1:18:08] perfect they weren't spiritual Supermen
[1:18:10] all the time now they were sometimes
[1:18:12] right by the grace of God Amen but not
[1:18:14] all the
[1:18:15] time and here Jesus tells his disciples
[1:18:19] of John he said go show John the things
[1:18:23] you see and hear in my
[1:18:24] campaign Hallelujah the blind receive
[1:18:27] their sight the lame walk lepers are
[1:18:29] cleansed the deaf hear the dead are
[1:18:31] raised up and the poor have the gospel
[1:18:33] preached to them
[1:18:35] amen he said to answer your question
[1:18:38] watch what the Holy Ghost is doing in my
[1:18:40] Ministry and go tell John what happens
[1:18:43] in my Ministry then he'll know by my
[1:18:45] fruits I'll be known and by your fruits
[1:18:48] you'll be known by my fruits I'll be
[1:18:50] known what kind of a life what kind of
[1:18:52] fruit do I produce the fruit of the
[1:18:53] spirit or the fruit of unrighteousness
[1:18:55] corrupt fruit or righteous fruit amen a
[1:18:58] tree is known by its fruit
[1:19:01] Hallelujah so this is the 10th beatitude
[1:19:06] brother random said blessed is he who's
[1:19:09] not offended in the word of God praise
[1:19:11] the Lord now this thought came to me as
[1:19:15] I was studying this and this is where
[1:19:16] I'm going to try to close the next maybe
[1:19:17] half hour or so by God's
[1:19:20] grace perhaps there's some other
[1:19:22] forgotten Beatitudes now brother man
[1:19:25] never said this but here's my thought
[1:19:27] there's more red letter scriptures about
[1:19:30] being blessed how many know
[1:19:32] that Jesus lists a bunch of them we're
[1:19:34] not going to read all of them we're
[1:19:35] gonna read a few of them there's a lot
[1:19:38] more blessed
[1:19:39] scriptures and they're all red letters
[1:19:42] and brother said if you're not careful
[1:19:43] you'll miss that forgotten one blessed
[1:19:46] is he who's not offended in me blessed
[1:19:48] are the poor in spirit blessed are the
[1:19:50] meek blessed are those that are
[1:19:51] persecuted for righteous sake blessed
[1:19:53] are the the poor in spirit all these
[1:19:54] things blessed is he who's not offended
[1:19:56] me but Jesus also said blessed are your
[1:19:59] eyes for they see blessed are your ears
[1:20:01] for they hear that's the first one amen
[1:20:04] so we're not gonna read that one this is
[1:20:06] where Peter Jesus asked Peter who do you
[1:20:09] say am some say I'm Jeremiah some say
[1:20:11] I'm I'm Elijah some say this or that who
[1:20:13] do you say he said Thou Art the Christ
[1:20:15] the son of the Living God he said
[1:20:18] blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah amen
[1:20:21] Simon bar
[1:20:23] amen because he said the go man has not
[1:20:27] revealed this to you my father which is
[1:20:29] in heaven has revealed this unto you
[1:20:31] amen so it's a blessing to receive
[1:20:34] Revelations from the father
[1:20:37] amen now in Matthew 24 blessed is the
[1:20:40] servant who watches for the return of
[1:20:42] his Lord Jesus said that red letter
[1:20:44] words that's why we watch we look for
[1:20:46] the coming of the lord we keep our lives
[1:20:48] in order because we know Christ can come
[1:20:50] at any moment praise God Matthew 25
[1:20:54] Jesus said blessed are they on the right
[1:20:55] hand praise God blessed are the those
[1:20:58] that are separated as sheep from the
[1:21:00] goats praise God I got through that
[1:21:03] Bible Study last night so I Mal I had a
[1:21:04] good Bible study there in copi by God's
[1:21:06] grace and it was a wonderful Bible study
[1:21:09] got to pray for a sick woman I'm looking
[1:21:10] forward to hearing a a testimony of
[1:21:12] healing by God's grace I'm praying for
[1:21:13] that with all my heart amen had a real
[1:21:15] good Bible study and I got to mention
[1:21:17] that how they they said nobody can be
[1:21:20] saved without knowing Christ I said well
[1:21:21] that's not exactly the full truth if
[1:21:23] they're good to a Christian Jesus will
[1:21:26] grant them eternal life praise God
[1:21:29] that's what that that's the scripture
[1:21:30] right here blessed are they blessed are
[1:21:33] those who were good to the Brethren
[1:21:36] praise God blessed are those who visited
[1:21:39] a Christian in prison blessed are those
[1:21:41] who gave clothes to a Christian right
[1:21:43] who didn't have clothes blessed are they
[1:21:45] who fed a Christian who had no food
[1:21:47] praise
[1:21:49] God Jesus said blessed are they so are
[1:21:52] there some more red letter blessings
[1:21:53] there are I'm not going to call them
[1:21:55] Beatitudes but there's some more red
[1:21:56] letter blessings because brother R
[1:21:58] didn't say that so I don't want to say
[1:21:59] that let's go to Luke 11 I want to read
[1:22:00] this one for sure I put a little Aster
[1:22:02] by the ones I want to read for sure Luke
[1:22:07] 11:27
[1:22:08] amen so now you can see am I happy am I
[1:22:11] happy in Christ if not now you know why
[1:22:14] you gotta live the right kind of life
[1:22:15] then you be happy in Christ Jesus
[1:22:21] Hallelujah Luke
[1:22:24] 11 27- 28 I have oh yeah I love the
[1:22:29] scripture praise the Lord amen
[1:22:32] glory they they try to bless they try to
[1:22:34] kind of butter up Jesus a little bit and
[1:22:36] they kind of try to uh uh praise his
[1:22:39] flesh you know look at this I'm sorry
[1:22:41] praise his mother look at this verse 27
[1:22:43] and it came to pass as he spake these
[1:22:44] things a certain woman of the company
[1:22:46] lifted up her voice and said to them
[1:22:47] blessed is the womb that bear thee and
[1:22:49] the paths that gave thee suck this woman
[1:22:52] start starts blessing Jesus's natural
[1:22:55] mother starts blessing her womb and
[1:22:57] blessing her her breast right that that
[1:22:59] gave suck to baby Jesus so it's blessing
[1:23:03] uh the natural mother like the Roman
[1:23:05] Catholic
[1:23:06] church right right Church blessing the
[1:23:09] woman bless the woman and Jesus do Jesus
[1:23:11] doesn't agree with her he says yay
[1:23:14] rather which means no rather means no
[1:23:17] rather no rather blessed are they that
[1:23:20] hear the word of God and keep it amen
[1:23:24] anybody can bring forth a baby can I say
[1:23:26] like that yes that it's a blessing to
[1:23:29] that but it ain't the same level
[1:23:31] blessing as it is to keep the word of
[1:23:33] God to hear it and know it Jesus said so
[1:23:36] we don't exalt the flesh we exalt the
[1:23:38] spirit Hallelujah we exalt the spiritual
[1:23:40] bird not the natural birth amen because
[1:23:43] the natural birth produces death but the
[1:23:45] spiritual birth produces life in Christ
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:50] glory I like that
[1:23:54] Glory Luke 12:36 since we're right there
[1:23:57] since we're one chapter Way Church let's
[1:23:58] just read that Luke 12 I think this is
[1:24:00] again about watching if I'm not mistaken
[1:24:03] Luke
[1:24:05] 12:36 yes look at verse 35 yeah let your
[1:24:08] loins be GED about and your lights
[1:24:10] burning remember the full armor of God
[1:24:11] the loins was the belt that kept all the
[1:24:14] armor on did you know
[1:24:16] that the belt there it kept everything
[1:24:19] together if your belt got loose your
[1:24:20] armor will start falling off your breast
[1:24:22] plate would start falling off then you
[1:24:24] had then you really couldn't hold your
[1:24:25] Shield the right way because you're
[1:24:26] trying to pull up your your belt there

[1:25:49] make them sit down to me and will come

[1:25:56] Watch and find them so blessed are those
[1:25:59] servants that church you know what that
[1:26:01] meant you know what the second watch of
[1:26:02] the night was you know what that was the
[1:26:05] last the first watch was 900 P PM second
[1:26:08] watch was midnight a day went from 6:00
[1:26:11] AM to 6 PM in Jewish time from sunrise
[1:26:14] to sunset how many you know that so he
[1:26:16] might come at 900 p.m. you got to wait

[1:26:25] Lord you got to watch and pray for the
[1:26:28] Lord to come amen what the Bible say
[1:26:30] blessed are those servants who stay up
[1:26:32] late into the night watching for the
[1:26:34] Lord I'm talking about spiritual night
[1:26:36] spiritual night all right let's go to
[1:26:39] John 20 verse 29 I honestly thought I
[1:26:42] personally feel like this could be
[1:26:43] called a beatitude John 20 because
[1:26:45] straight from the lips of Christ but
[1:26:47] again I'm not going to call it beud but
[1:26:49] I feel like it it seems really like it
[1:26:51] is um but anyway it's true either either
[1:26:54] way my thoughts don't matter what
[1:26:56] matters is God's word uh John
[1:27:00] 2029 brother Austin can you read that
[1:27:02] John
[1:27:06] 20:29 Jesus sayth unto him Thomas
[1:27:10] because thou Hast seen me thou Hast
[1:27:12] believed blessed are they that have not
[1:27:15] seen oh blessed are they that have that
[1:27:19] have not seen and yet have believed amen
[1:27:21] I that by God's grace Jesus gives
[1:27:24] Another redl
[1:27:25] Blessing blessed are they that have not
[1:27:28] seen yet they still believe praise God
[1:27:32] you know sometimes when I go to this
[1:27:33] certain Church well I'll just say it
[1:27:34] when I go to Pennsylvania there's a
[1:27:35] brother who sat in one of brother Ram's
[1:27:37] meetings and I go there and preach and
[1:27:39] he would meet me afterwards he's an old
[1:27:40] brother he's probably like 80 you know a
[1:27:42] real short brother he comes up and name
[1:27:43] brother Jack he'll come up and slap me
[1:27:45] on the shoulder he said you know brother
[1:27:46] Jesse said you're more blessed than I am
[1:27:48] I'm like no I am the first time I'm like
[1:27:49] no I'm not brother what do you mean
[1:27:50] we're all blessed in Christ Jesus he
[1:27:52] said ' no he saidou more blessed than I
[1:27:54] am Jesus said so he said because I saw
[1:27:56] brother brandom and I believe he said'
[1:27:58] but you never saw brother brandom and
[1:28:00] yet you believe he is God's
[1:28:02] Prophet I said well you got me on that
[1:28:04] one I'm not sure what to say but I know
[1:28:06] church when I turn on that tape or I
[1:28:08] watch that video something stirs me I
[1:28:10] feel like I'm right there Hallelujah it
[1:28:12] feels like I am there amen hallelujah
[1:28:15] why because it's the same Spirit the
[1:28:17] same Holy Spirit I feel here I feel it
[1:28:19] when I listen to the tape or when I put
[1:28:20] on the video why is it because it's the
[1:28:22] same gospel producing the same effects
[1:28:25] to the same believers who believe the
[1:28:26] word of God hallelujah amen blessed are
[1:28:31] those who have not seen the mighty
[1:28:32] Miracles or seen a prophet of God yet
[1:28:34] they still believe praise
[1:28:37] God amen glory let's close with this the
[1:28:42] greatest blessing brother B said the
[1:28:44] greatest blessing was something so let's
[1:28:45] look at this we read it on this is where
[1:28:47] I was trying to close on Sunday but I
[1:28:49] never got to it this is in my text on
[1:28:52] Sunday morning Revelation 19:7 let us be
[1:28:54] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:28:56] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[1:28:58] his wife hath made herself
[1:29:00] ready and to her was granted that she
[1:29:03] should be a raay in fine linen clean and
[1:29:04] white for the fine linen is the
[1:29:06] righteousness of
[1:29:07] saints and he saith unto me right
[1:29:10] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:29:14] the marriage supper the lamb and he said
[1:29:16] unto me these are the true sayings of
[1:29:18] God we pick it up again the next chapter
[1:29:21] blessed and whole holy is he that have
[1:29:22] part in the first resurrection that's
[1:29:24] the Rapture that's where only the bride
[1:29:26] or the dead in Christ are raptured and
[1:29:29] the the the those that are alive are
[1:29:30] quickened and changed in the twink of an
[1:29:32] eye the second Resurrection is when all
[1:29:35] Sinners and anyone foolish Virg anyone
[1:29:37] else comes up for the resurrection to
[1:29:39] the white Throne
[1:29:41] judgment on such the second death hath
[1:29:43] no power but they shall be Priests of
[1:29:46] God and of Christ and shall reign with
[1:29:48] him a thousand years amen here's where
[1:29:51] the quot that inspired me on this one
[1:29:53] brother R said it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:29:55] no man can come to me except my father
[1:29:57] draws him first all the father ha given
[1:29:59] me will come to me there you are so when
[1:30:01] you have the least little tinkling in
[1:30:04] your heart to come to Christ you do it
[1:30:08] right away church I hope somebody has a
[1:30:10] tinkling tonight to come more into
[1:30:12] Christ a tinkling just a little tinkling
[1:30:15] a little sound a little bit of a little
[1:30:16] bit of desire to draw closer to
[1:30:20] Christ he said
[1:30:22] you do it right away because that's the
[1:30:24] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[1:30:29] praise God is for God to call you to the
[1:30:32] wedding supper of his son I don't know
[1:30:36] anything greater how many can say Amen
[1:30:38] to that amen there's nothing greater
[1:30:41] that you've ever had in your life other
[1:30:43] than to hear the gospel preach and it
[1:30:46] calls you to go to a marriage supper
[1:30:48] with Jesus Christ in the air amen bless
[1:30:51] blessed are those who are called to the
[1:30:54] marriage supper of the Lamb Hallelujah
[1:30:56] blessed are those who are part of the
[1:30:58] first resurrection
[1:31:00] amen one time I heard something a little
[1:31:02] bit different than this somebody said
[1:31:04] the greatest blessing I ever had in my
[1:31:05] life was to meet brother brandom I said
[1:31:07] no that's on borderline on worshiping a
[1:31:09] man don't get me wrong I would love to
[1:31:11] meet brother brand I'd love to meet John
[1:31:12] the Baptist but there's something
[1:31:14] greater than meeting a man it's meeting
[1:31:16] God hallelujah it's meeting Jesus Christ
[1:31:19] and they put it on the website well the
[1:31:21] greatest was Meet brother Ram that's not
[1:31:23] true brother Ram's a man he can't give
[1:31:25] you the Holy Ghost but Jesus Christ can
[1:31:27] give you the Holy Ghost amen that's the
[1:31:29] greatest blessing we ever had is to know
[1:31:31] Christ and to hear him invite us out of
[1:31:34] the world out of sin out of Destruction
[1:31:36] out of misery into a holy relationship
[1:31:39] into a wedding with
[1:31:41] himself amen the Bible said in these two
[1:31:44] Parables he calls many to the wedding
[1:31:47] the Bible said many were called to the
[1:31:50] wedding but you've got to to put the
[1:31:52] wedding before everything the ground the
[1:31:54] ax and the wife remember the story Jesus
[1:31:56] said one man said oh Jesus I I can't oh
[1:31:59] servants I can't come to Jesus wedding I
[1:32:01] got to go look at the ground that bar so
[1:32:03] look he was talking he was more
[1:32:05] interested in his future investments in
[1:32:07] money than he was about going in the
[1:32:09] Rapture praise God he more interested in
[1:32:12] his potential income out there on the
[1:32:15] ground more interested in the ground and
[1:32:17] the next thing was The Oxen was the
[1:32:19] vehicle that was going to get him the
[1:32:20] money and the investment that he thought
[1:32:22] he would wanted so much so the first
[1:32:25] thing is that big old ground that
[1:32:26] potential and then the ox I got to go
[1:32:28] test my oxin I gotta make sure they're
[1:32:30] strong so I can plant my seed and go to
[1:32:32] work and invest all this time and the
[1:32:34] last thing was a wife a relationship
[1:32:38] well no I can't come to the m Rapture
[1:32:39] because I gotta take care of my husband
[1:32:41] I gotta take care of my wife I gotta do
[1:32:42] this first and instead of putting Christ
[1:32:45] first they put relationships before
[1:32:46] Christ or they put money before Christ
[1:32:49] or all these jobs and things like that
[1:32:52] church we need to put Christ first amen
[1:32:56] and now this is how this is how strict
[1:32:57] it is church this is how powerful it is
[1:33:00] and then when they got to the marriage
[1:33:02] supper then they had to have the baptism
[1:33:04] of the Holy Ghost to be a part of it if
[1:33:06] not they were bound up because they
[1:33:08] didn't have a wedding garment on and
[1:33:10] tossed in the outer Darkness how many
[1:33:12] remember
[1:33:13] that look at the look at the levels of
[1:33:15] sacrifice it takes to be a part of the
[1:33:18] Rapture but it's for those who are
[1:33:20] blessed hallelujah it's for those who
[1:33:23] know it's actually their wedding as well
[1:33:25] the Rapture is their wedding Hallelujah
[1:33:28] that is they're not interested so much
[1:33:30] in the natural wedding they're
[1:33:31] interested in the spiritual wedding amen
[1:33:34] it's my wedding that's why I'm forsaking
[1:33:35] all I'm leaving all that I know in order
[1:33:38] to be a part of that Rapture let's stand
[1:33:40] to our feet by God's
[1:33:42] grace
[1:33:44] amen you and I are fortunate we've heard
[1:33:47] the call haven't we we've heard there's
[1:33:50] a Rapture coming many in the world have
[1:33:52] heard it but who will leave the ground
[1:33:54] who will leave The Oxen who will leave
[1:33:55] their relationships and gather with all
[1:33:58] the Saints at the wedding
[1:34:00] supper and then who will stop at the
[1:34:03] door because remember you had to go in
[1:34:04] the door and you had to change your
[1:34:05] garments you had to put off your natural
[1:34:07] garment and put on a wedding garment now
[1:34:09] who will get the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:10] Ghost now that you gathered there I feel
[1:34:12] like the message uh the message here is
[1:34:15] like the wedding or the wedding
[1:34:17] Gathering here you you hear the word of
[1:34:19] God you come in but you got to the
[1:34:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] hallelujah amen then you can strengthen
[1:34:26] your brethren how many want to
[1:34:27] strengthen other people I do I had a
[1:34:30] good testimony about it last night
[1:34:31] praise God I'm thankful for that I'm
[1:34:33] thankful that God's grace I can look
[1:34:35] back in my life and see God's grace help
[1:34:36] me to strengthen people I don't even
[1:34:38] know I mean I don't even spend much time
[1:34:40] with but when you're converted you can
[1:34:42] strengthen your brethren yes Hallelujah
[1:34:45] that's just such a blessing amen that
[1:34:47] the it's a reality of a Christian Life
[1:34:50] people look at your life and say that's
[1:34:52] if there's a Christian it's brother
[1:34:54] sister a brother sister so and so that's
[1:34:56] the kind of life we got to live if we
[1:34:58] live the Beatitudes we'll live that kind
[1:35:00] of Life praise God
[1:35:03] Amen well that's all I got here tonight
[1:35:05] for by God's grace that's one of my
[1:35:06] shortest sermons in a long time you love

[1:35:32] thing to do is let's let's hear the call
[1:35:35] and let's leave everything else

[1:35:40] poor in
[1:35:41] spirit how many want to be a peacemaker
[1:35:44] how many want meekness in their life
[1:35:46] whereas I'm not interested in myself
[1:35:47] it's all about God's
[1:35:49] interest that's what we need tonight and
