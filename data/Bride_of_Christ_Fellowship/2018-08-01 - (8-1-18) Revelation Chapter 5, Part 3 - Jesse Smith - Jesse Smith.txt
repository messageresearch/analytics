at the voice of God and she said random Tabernacle was open from 12:00 to 4:00 on Monday we can go any time but then our voice of God tours at 3:15 so voice of God is only 15 minutes away from the Branham tabernacle so we'll stay to like from 12:00 to 12:30 Lord willing and then we'll head up to the voice of God by God's grace so looking forward to that it's going to be a wonderful time in the

who took on flesh fullness a word in helpless babe this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to see on that cross as Jesus died the wrath of God satisfied on him was laid here in the death of Christ I live there in the ground his body lay light of the world by darkness lea then bursting forth in glorious day up from the grave he rose again and as he said victory since curse has lost its grip on me for I am his and he is mine bought with the precious blood of Christ no guilt in life no fear in death this is the power of Christ in me from life's first cry to final breath Jesus commands my destiny no power of hell no scheme of man could ever pluck me from his head till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ I'll stand no power of hell no scheme of man could ever block me from his head - he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ here in the power of Christ amen let's take our Bibles as we stand here we'll get right into the Word of God Malachi could you unplug my iPad and bring it up here please I'd like to go to Revelation chapter 5 tonight well let's look at Part 3 thank you sir part three of Revelation chapter five I'm gonna try to preach about 45 minutes to an hour and I sent out an email this morning that I want to address how brother Adam resigned so I want to take a few moments after preaching and address that so the church kind of knows about that we've tried to do that whenever a elected officer would resign we've just tried to let the church know so they have an understanding and so I like to share about that after we preached by the grace of the Lord so Revelation chapter 5 I like to start at verse 8 if we can I believe this is where we left off last Wednesday night thank you geez praise God why don't we if we could i'll read verses i'll read verses 8 9 10 11 and 12 and then maybe we'll all read verse 13 together that's kind of what we'll look at tonight by God's grace I'll start with verse 8 but I'll stop when we can all read on verse 8 I'm sorry verse 13 pardon me verse 8 I'll read it and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands talk about a fellowship amen talk about a church service oh the Bible says no eye has seen no ear is heard what God has prepared for those that love him thousands upon thousands upon thousands all worshiping one person Jesus Christ saying with a loud voice worthy is a land that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing notice there are seven elements they're worshiping they're seven attributes of Christ they're worshiping on Sunday morning we'll probably I want to preach a message on God's numbers in the Bible I've been studying on God's numbers and you probably read about that a little bit you know brother man talks a lot about it so I'll probably preach on that on Sunday morning Lord willing verse 13 let's read this together just verse thirteen one two three and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever I'll read verse 14 and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever amen what a scene that is praise God oh my just imagine all the thousands upon millions all falling down to worship our Lord Jesus Christ is he worthy of your praise tonight there's brother Graham said there's really nothing you can do he said you get on your knees he said you could take off your shoes there's really nothing that we can do to really suffice or humble ourselves enough it's just it's we just must do as much as we can humble ourselves by the grace of God as much as we can he meant let's just have one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father as we approach your word Lord we read your word just take this vessel Lord use me use the people Lord use these vessels of clay father I just pray you to speak to every heart tonight Lord God and Lord let your Holy Spirit Lord give us Lord these thoughts that will strengthen us feed us and encourage us here tonight Lord God we give you all the glory and all the honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name and everybody said amen god bless she's been seated praise God I like to review just a moment before we look at the rest of this chapter after excuse me I'm feeling a little tired I had a late conversation last night with another pastor I'll tell a little bit more about it and I already hadn't got enough sleep the night before so I think it much sleep last night so I'm just kind of a little tired tonight so you have to bear with me here I'm trying to trying to overcome I could have just got off and said you know I'm not feeling very well but I'm trying to overcome by God's grace I'm just pressing through and trust God will give me some good rest tonight by God's grace so this is part 3 part 81 of this series and that's just review and part one we looked at how the book was sealed in Revelation chapter 5 it needed to be open which will look at nor willing next week in Chapter six and then we saw I just I was using a lot of Bertram's quotes he showed how a seal in the scripture is is signifying a finished work and he laid in the adoption of I'm sorry the adopter and rather of adoption and the fullness of the adoption which is the body change at the rapture how the seal is an earnest or down payment of all of our inheritance which is a brand-new body and then we looked at how the spirit if you have the spirit of adoption you'll cry out Abba Father have you been crying that out in prayer lately I hope you have I know I have that's been one of my first things I'll say when I go in the prayer closet is Abba I come to you this is our time together Abba this isn't this is your my time here as I pray amen he's our Father and we took time in part one to look at the misunderstanding of the backside people some people misunderstood brother Rams quotes and and they thought there was something outside of the Bible that they were looking for but we found out that brother Branham said there that there's really all we need to be ready for the rapture is what's already written in the Bible we don't have to add to the Bible we certainly can't take away from the Bible and we must not overlook the scripture that's in the Bible so a lot of people are some people have misunderstood the backside of the book now I don't fully understand it but I know this I know we're not to add or take away to the Word of God so we're not looking for any any brother to come with a new revelation oh I got something that's outside the Bible you've never heard it before and we would say nonsense we get nonsense how many read the Bible all the way through if you if you've read the Bible all the way through you've heard it or read it all before but what we need now is the Holy Spirit to quicken that to us to make it alive to say yes that's me I want to as Jesus found his place in the scripture I want to find my place in the scripture hey man she doesn't have to go outside the scrolls or the Bible he had to go inside the Bible to find what was written of him to do praise God and we looked at how the thunders were revealed and were the revelations contained the seven seals in fact a brother from a brother named Clemente from Anna emailed me this morning and said he knew your brother William and he said are the thunders reveal and I said yes sir he said I agree so I don't know if you talked to him or what but he said he knew you his name's Clemente from Ghana but I said yes brother I said yes and so I sent him a link to the sermon I said I believe there brother BAM said they were revealed in the seals and that's in questions that answer 64 so now that they've been revealed what are we supposed to do we're supposed to be our lives thundering out God's Word your life as Bo Jim kept saying on Sunday morning your life is to preach the gospel to other people so your life should be thundering out holiness thundering out godliness thundering out obedience to all the people around you amen and we looked at how the Seventh Seal is the literal day and hour of Christ's second coming for the rapture and that was part one last week we looked at part two the book in heaven was and is the book of redemption it's still the book of redemption we saw how mankind was is and will be redeemed back to all that Adam had in the garden before sin entered what I mean by that is Jesus has already purchased all of our rights back but we don't have the fullness of them that comes at the body change amen then we'll have the fullness of all the redemption and then we saw that John wept because without a redeemer all the creation was lost or they would never return to the or be restored back to the conditions in the Garden of Eden we saw that that's why he wept he didn't weep for any other reason he was weeping because without the contents of that book all these rights would not be restored to God's people amen he and then Satan would remain god of this world but he's not going to always be God of this world one day Jesus Christ will be the full god of this world over every Kingdom and every nation amen don't get me wrong he is in a sense but the Bible said Satan's influencing all the nations now all the governments now he's the main influencer but one day Jesus Christ will rule every nation amen every government hallelujah and that'll be in the Millennium and then we saw why the fifth chapter would be confusing and one way brother man brother has won once he steps off that that mercy seat redemptions overs that's why some people have read revelation five listen brother branham and they thought when Christ comes forward the book and loosed the seal they say redemptions already over but they've just misunderstood the quotes that's that's that's the only way that we can explain it and so I believe revelation five was fulfilled around 1963 sometime around there may be right in March I don't know but then I believe Christ went and sat back down as the mediator on the throne or the mercy seat in heaven that's just my thought I don't really have a I don't really have a scripture on that but there's many quotes after the seals where brother Branham says that Jesus is seated on the throne right now he's mediator and the Bible clearly says he's the mediator right now he's the high priest there's one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus amen so we know that's what that must have been what happened because the Bible can't contradict itself and so we saw that Mercy's not over even though the seals have been open Mercy's not over brother man said never think that because you're still here if you're still here there's still mercy praise God and brother man said Jesus's act in Revelation five is the most sublime thing in the scripture it's the most awe-inspiring thing and and last Wednesday the Holy Ghost came upon me I could hardly stop crying at the end of service remember that just how it just struck me how sublime it was it was so so powerful that we would be under Satan's Dominion unless Christ came and opened the seals amen aren't you glad he opened the seals without the contents we would be under the bondage of sin we'd we'd remain there in heaven and not be able to come back to earth and and all these things without Christ coming to loose those seals Satan would remain God in the world but he came and did it he came and fulfilled the word he came and redeemed us all and now we can rejoice he's gonna finish the redemption process the most sublime thing in scripture amen hallelujah now let's look tonight at some fresh thoughts here maybe fresh to you or maybe I don't know how much you in Chapter five or the breach sermon but we'll be taking a few quotes from the breach by God's grace so verses 8 to 10 I read them earlier and this is where the the beasts and the elders fall down and they have the vows of prayers they sing a new song and they say you're worthy because you were slain for every kindred tongue nation people and it's made us kings and priests unto God and we shall reign on the earth so let's look what brother Branham says now this was the scripture we don't have to read it I just kind of paraphrase it for you brother man reads this and then he says that that's those that's under the altar that had prayed for long ago so both am speaking of the the 24 elders they prayed for long ago they had prayed for Redemption prayed for resurrection and here these elders are pouring out the prayers before because now we've got a representative now we got a kinsman in heaven that's come forth to make his claims amen so these these elders and the beasts there's all these golden vials I don't know which ones have the golden vials I don't know if both the the beasts have them or just the 24 elders but the the the 4 or the the beasts or elders are bringing forth all these prayers and they're so thankful they're so thankful that now all these prayers that God has kept in heaven are going to be answered soon amen they've been prayed for all these 6,000 years all these prayers of 6,000 years God resurrect me Lord I don't want to die but if I do raise me up amen hallelujah job said though though my skin worms will eat my flesh yet in my flesh I shall see God amen all these prayers for thousands of years about I don't want to die brother have said man's greatest fear was death did you know that man's greatest fear was death and so now they see Christ come to reveal the book he comes to take the book and the outers get our rejoicing and they bring all these prayers hopes for resurrection hope for restoration hope for eternal peace hope for eternal love amen hope for eternal health all these hopes all these prayers are now going to be performed and they can't but shouted rejoice amen hallelujah they see Redemption is going to be finished God is going to finish the work that he started amen Oh hallelujah on these prayers four thousand years old six thousand year old prayers God heard every one of them God's gonna answer all of them Amen now look at my RAM says he says this about verse 10 and has made us unto God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth look at Bob Arum says they wanted to come back and here they are going back to be kings and priests glory to God I feel good enough to speak in tongues brother Matt says he said oh he's and the people start rejoicing he says look here now here it seems like I ain't got enough language I could praise him with it I need one that I don't even know notice the church that you get catches in heaven these Saints are missing the earth how could they miss the earth there's perfect joy in heaven you know there's perfect peace and and there's there's beasts worshiping and it's holy holy holy but brother Ian tells us the Saints we're missing the earth now the reason they're missing the earth is because they have an attraction to it the earth is their future home amen and also they're missing a part of their their being their physical bodies are still on the earth and so because a part of them is on the earth they're longing to go back to the earth from dust thou art and dust that will return so these these theophanies of these four and twenty elders they're longing they feel they still feel a connection to the earth because their bodies are down there on the earth by the rhythm says they wanted to come back you would think why in the world would I ever want to come back this Satan's eating down here but see then then theophany bodies and they know when we come back we're going to rule on that earth amen when I come back there Satan will be put chained up with a chain of circumstance in the bottomless pit praise God and they're longing to go back they're longing to get my body back and to take my position on the heirs they want to go back to earth and we all say all our homes in heaven that's true but our home in heaven is going to come down to earth amen hallelujah because the Bible said blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth even though they're in heaven they want to go back to earth because that their inheritance amen there's something on the earth that God has called them to be a steward over to rule over and they want to go back and take their position amen and it's not just going to be a temporary one brother William it's going to be an eternal one amen eternally they will be on this earth in the position God has called them to be in praise God amen and this is where heaven comes down to earth so see we say or we're looking for a country who's bitter makers God Jesus is preparing that city right now Jesus is preparing that country right now he said I go to prepare a place for you amen he's preparing says in the future home Jesus is preparing the New Jerusalem right now so yes we're longing for our country are our real home is in heaven but then heaven is going to come down to earth amen hallelujah remember that when Bo Graham said about Abraham and Hosea premise because I mean I remember here he he always likes Abraham he's always talked about Abraham brother and said Abraham was looking for his future home he was just looking from side to side he's looking for this country's builder makers God brother and said the whole time it wasn't down here he said all you had to do was look up the New Jerusalem praise God he knew it was somewhere he knew it was in this vicinity but the whole time it was just right above him in a few years Jesus would come to the earth and then Jesus would go back to heaven and he'd begin construction on that gate great country how many know how many know that there's a great attraction for you to heaven amen do you feel that traction you're locked are you groaning for heaven praise God well once you get there then you'll grown to come back to earth amen I don't know yeah because a part of you came from the earth amen and that's part of your possession as well hallelujah oh ma thank you Jesus so see that's what the these 424 hours are so happy they're so thankful they've got the prayers - look what Abraham britainís we're looking look at your break this we're looking at Solomon and David pregnant they've got all these prayers from all these thousands of years and they know oh god is going to finish it God is gonna complete what he started and then we're going back to the earth we've enjoyed heaven but I sure want to go back to the earth they meant Oh hallelujah verse 11 now this is where the voice of the Angels they all thousands upon thousands they say worthy was a lamb this is the Sevenfold worship here now let's see what brother M says he said listen what a Jubilee going on when they seen that lamb come and take that book or Redemption the souls screamed out we'll get at it Oh everything the elders fell down they poured out the prayers of the Saints what there was represented a kinsman for us they fell on their faces then they sang a song and said thou art worthy for you were slain watch and look at these angels amen now this is what I don't understand if heaven is shouting and rejoicing that the seals are going to be open how much more should we rejoice on the earth that they are open or inside of this when was the last time you rejoiced because the seals were open every time I cast down sin I should rejoice that the seals are open amen because the seals revealed how Satan comes he comes as a deceptive white horse rider right that's what the seals did it showed us how Satan works he tries to trick you into sin first but he God give you the line anointing to be bold against that devil amen hallelujah now we know the Antichrist spirit has progressed we're now he's like a pale horse rider and now we're supposed to have the eagle anointing but the seals reveal both to us it reveals how Satan attacks us with the white innocence and also how he tries to kill people with spiritual death the seals would be all of that the whole Bible became a new Bible when the seals were revealed amen Oh an order to at least it ought to be coming up new Bible to us that's right he said what did you believe going on in heaven when that lamb leaves the intercessory box to come here to possess his claim you know what you know that got next to John he must have saw his name wrote there now be careful because John would have only seen his name written once the book was open so in Chapter five he hasn't seen his unless his name was on the back side of the book that's the only thing I could say brother you guys understand you understand unless his name was because the book there's still seven seals around it so this might be true but if it was then then Jesus had all 24 elders names on the back side of the book that may be possible but brother Han doesn't tell us that I'm just letting you know if this is a Lamb's Book of Life and the names are inside then then that couldn't happen to later but I'm just letting you know so you understand when M seals Brooks that means the book would be open he must have got real happy listen what he said alright just a minute here it's a good thought but Ram said talk about a Jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walk for see the books even sealed in heaven the mysteries are and prevents says say is my name there bro Graham says I don't know I hope it is how many hoping your names on the Lamb's Book of Life as well I'm hoping that there is there as well but if it is it was put on that book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the Lamb that had been slain from the foundation world and he took the glory open the book now this is when in the breach message that the crowd gets the loudest at this point because they're realizing that revelation five and six are going to be fulfilled in the next few days see he took the book opened the book torn off the seals and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people and at this point you can't even hear brother Branham because the people are so rejoicing that this book is going to be revealed to God's bride amen Oh hallelujah he said oh my what happened the screams of shouts the hallelujah the anointed the power of the the manifestation all of heaven couldn't stop rejoicing and singing when they knew this books going to be reveal I'll tell you if heaven energy ever ever enters your yo do the same thing when God reveals his revelations to you praise God hallelujah no cameras after this you know the seals are before any time God reveals any true to you it makes you want to shout and rejoice amen because the gates of Hell cannot prevail against the heavenly revelation Amen Alleluia that's right and so the people are rejoicing Oh programs the seventh angel we understand this God is going to break the seals right now and all heaven is shouting and so Oliver starts shouting there must have been an echo and now when they were worshiping there must been an echo to come down to earth Oh glory now I'm going I'm skipping to a different message program just to show you how humble brother Brandon is now he's talking about the book of life brother man said brother Brandon can you prove that you're there no sir I cannot prove it look how humble it look how humble he is Church I've heard quotes recently when I listen brother BAM says I hope I'm in the bride he says I don't have those up here but I could find them for you I hope look how humble look how look how a little he made himself he never bragged and made himself arrogant or better than other people he was not full of pride he was full of God's love see brother have said God could use me for a to love something else I'm God I'm glad God didn't I'm God fit amen and you the same way see he can use me for a tool for evil as well but I believe in my faith I'm saved not by now John saved by faith that's the way you're saved that's the way we're all saved now I don't put this up here so you'll walk around and wonder I don't know if my name's on the book I don't know if I'm saying I'll know whatever that's not why I'm reading I'm saying that to show how humble he is so we don't get prideful and exalt ourselves above the Methodists to make ourselves better than the Pentecostals alright my family's my mom's in Pentecostal church I'm not exalting myself above her I'm just saying more has been revealed in her church has and they can live a higher life if they'll receive that God has torn off these seven seals off the ball came ahead there's a higher life they can live but I can't prove that my name's there my life will prove if my name's they're very men so will yours we're not to go around and say well they're all going to hell there are a bunch of serpents II know God could use you as a serpent seed and church even in our failures this is why I sent a quote to brother William today even in our failures God wants to us to be so humble that we realized we're not that we're not above sin brother Branham I sent the court developer him I mentioned here brother Branham took six months and he said he in his prayer meetings he said or healing campaigns he said bring me all the hard cases first and brother BAM said when I did that he said I was walking in Balaam shoes now brother Branham was not a Balaam he was God's true prophet but you understand what he's saying he's saying I know I know what it's like to misuse a gift of God he said because i disobeyed the angels voice the angel never told me bring the hardest cases the Angels just said pray for the sick and he made it a show brother Brad made it a show that's what the coach says and he put himself in Balaam shoes misusing the gift of God now how many can relate to that for example how many of ever felt like Jonah and you've left the Friends of God and the church said everybody ought to shout amens I'm done that means oh you mean you've never left the perfect will of God you never made a mistake and didn't walk in the will of God of course you and I have of course I have of course you and I have run from the presence of the Lord are you with me Church so see what I'm saying is that we can all relate what it feels like oh I'm in Jonah's shoes today I should have I went the wrong way I should have done this instead of that but that doesn't mean where Jonah but it means we can relate to his experience and that's what this is saying here I'm not sure I'm not showing you you this so you'll feel bad I don't know if my name's there by faith you must confess your names there the Bible said with your mouth confession is made under salvation amen you've got to confess it I believe he say how do you know because I'm dead to the things of the world the old man is crucified and now I'm a new man in Christ Jesus I don't desire the things of the world I don't obey the lusts of the flesh I'm led by the Holy Spirit and so now with your mouth you confess that i'm saved i'm saved by faith just like brother Brad was saved by faith so am i hey man are you with me Church and I got this when this always helps me out I mentioned it before you prior to when the first seal brother man talks about people who complain why don't want to have to let my hair grow long I don't want to stop smoking program said let me tell you something if your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world you'll be so happy to do it in other words obey the Bible you can't wait for the minute to do it praise God amen so he gives us some encouragement that's how you know your name's there because you want to obey all of God's Word now amen so yeah we want to be humble like brother Graham we wanted to be humble like that but we also want some encouragement because the Bible said make your calling and election sure prove to everybody whether you're wise or foolish virgin prove to people in the morning you can you should wake up and tell the devil devil I'm going to improve I'm gonna prove to you today that I'm a wise virgin or if you're struggling with being a borderline believer then well I'm gonna prove to you today I'm not a borderline believer amen prove it the Bible says you can prove the perfect will of God the Bible said cast down anything that exalts itself against the Word of God dude the Bible said take any thought in the captivity that exalts itself against the Word of God because the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they're money to God by pulling down many strongholds if you've got a stronghold you've got to pull it out and speak in Jesus Christ's name and the church said you've got to pull down if you let a strong a stronghold build up of of anger against somebody you got to pull that down Jesus Christ name praise the Lord if you've got a stronghold of fear you've got to pull that down and say I'm not afraid in Jesus Christ name if you've got a stronghold of lust you've got to say Lord forgive me my lust I'm pulling down this stronghold I won't give in to that lust anymore and I'm doing it in Jesus Christ's name are you with me church I hope you can understand thank you lord okay now let me go back to this quote yeah here it is an old John who've been standing there our brother crying why why he said everything in having everything he knows everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessings honor might empower be to him that lives forever and ever now remember last week John looked everywhere for someone worthy so he had access to go in the middle of the earth somehow by vision I don't know under the earth on the earth he was able to quickly search around the earth for anybody worthy and then he was able to do a roll call and having anybody worthy up here and when no one was found he started crying he said no one so he did a full search of the whole universe can I say like that he did a full search of that Hall of somehow got into a full search of the universe and knowing it's not worthy uh-huh but here he sees Christ come forth and when he sees him comes forth he gets so happy now here's why he gets happy you and maybe you wondered how come everything heard him scream and shout here's why Brennan tells us he said talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have look in when the seals broke and seen in and Cena passed the curtain of time and said there's John so John looked in and said there's John John looked into heaven and said there's John he's one of the 24 elders and the church said and there John must have looked at and said oh there I am and I've got a corner or crown on and I've got Frode right next to Jesus Christ and when he saw that brother madam said he got so happy he said everything in heaven cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in earth everything beneath the earth every creature everything else heard me saying amen blessing glory wisdom power might and riches belong to him amen why did everybody hear everybody heard him because he had already searched everywhere amen he already searched everywhere and then when he saw that he was predestinated to sit on the throne in heaven but God let his voice go to every place that he serves as a witness that Jesus Christ would restore him and Jesus Christ had a place for it in other words he knew he was predestinated and he knew he was going to make it amen he knew there is no devil in hell that could keep him from the service of the Lord amen in other words he knew he wasn't going to hell he knew he wasn't going to the tribulation oh man he knew he was going in the rapture Church and if you go revelation then I'm not going to hell I'm not going to tribulation I'm going in the rapture how do you know because I saw myself in the vision of God amen hallelujah so because he searched all these locations on the universe God lets all the universe here is shouting and rejoicing that he made it over I made it over and now I see my theophany there it is John saws the Alpha knee brace God he saw Cioffi there's Jeb he's one of those 24 elders and I made it over Amazing Grace how sweet the sound I made it over amen and all of heaven all creation everything even hail hears him shout hallelujah I made it I won't be lost I'm a victor I'm an overcomer I ever came in my day by the blood of Jesus Christ oh I want to make somebody happy tonight amen John looked and seen a past occurred of time I'm going to make it they've tried to burn the Holy Ghost out of me with oil they and now I'm gonna Island they're scorpions and snakes all over here and said even though I'm in the midst of these trials I'm gonna make it amen so he shouts and though Jesus Christ is gonna overcome and then I'm gonna make it I see myself in God's plan I see that I am an overcomer and once he got back from this vision church where as well don't tell us his major theme was love one another but BAM said when John was told to preach he would sit in the corner of the church and people would leave and he'd say little children love one another that's all he would say a man who saw himself in heaven a man who knew I have a place at the throne of God I'm not foolish virgin I'm wise virgin his greatest advice to all the people on earth that were still struggling am I gonna make her not his greatest advice is make sure you love one another I hope we can be encouraged tonight that you know our our main battle is just loving each other right here did you know that Jesus said you know my disciples because they love other disciples your hardest when your hardest battles will be to love people in this church right here you understand that and John with all that understanding John I also kind of said like this John now you start to walk by faith but part of it he'd already seen it by sight he knew he was going to make it by the grace of Lord does every understand like he had seen it by faith by faith he saw himself there oh my and if only we can love one another can you be patient with me for a few more years to the rapture can you be patient with me I hope so I'll try to be patient with you I'll try to love you if you'll love me back we all love one another we've just got to have divine love for each other and if we love each other then we can love sinners the last thing he said before he died we know little children love one another the last letter he wrote was all about love first John one two and three it's all about love love one another so John himself and the vision he was one of the 24 hours because Jesus had promised this to him during his earthly ministry John remembered I remember when we were having communion that night and Jesus told me he said truly I say to you John that you follow me and in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on throne of his glory you shall sit upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel and there John sees there's my throne and then I am with those twelve tribe leaders but I'm going to rule over them and John sees that he can't help but shout a little bit if your prayers ever get answered you might shout a little bit by the grace of God Church is that right if you know God's gonna answer your prayer but have said you can meet just as happy even if you don't have it yet you can be just as happy because you've got the purchased power of your request amen believes that you can be just as happy with twenty-five cents to buy a loaf of bread even though you're starboard you can be just as happy with a quarter as she would be with the bread and that's what John is saying here he can be just as happy even though he's not on the throne yet he has the purchase price he has the revelation that he will sit on the throne a man shouting when the when the when the revelation come that the Lamb the Redeemer our kinsman had come back from the throne of me tutorial and it walked out here to take his possession there brother Ram starts singing soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side so brother I'm singing this about revelation five he comes forth to claim the contents that are in his book right but we know of course that takes place at the seventh seal but the same point is that one day Jesus is going to call all those names on the book shout voice Trump the Trump of God is going to call us the Bible said our bodies get changed at the last Trump and the church said so that last Trump must be the calling of the names the spiritual name mrs. Jesus Christ is time for you to rise rise in power rise in love rise in a body change rise in the rapture rise in Holy Ghost power rise and meet your husband in the air hey man hallelujah now let me ask you this question I'm almost done because I wanted to finish at 8:30 so I have about 15 or 20 minutes to talk about the resignation here but I want to ask you John saw himself in the vision and it made him shout so much that all heaven earth and beneath the earth heard him shout because he saw he was predestinated god help us to see that we're predestinated so I want to say I just want to just give you some thoughts here can you see yourself in these three visions or dreams now I'm going to read them again can you see yourself in the preview of the bride you see yourself in that vision do you see yourself in the vision of beyond the curtain of time and you see your self in the vision of brother Rams mother's dream about walking up the Kings Highway and if you don't remember those visions I'm gonna read em to you tonight they're kind of hungry the short version okay the preview the ride right this is from the rapture 1965 brother Ram said this I stood there and seen a beautiful little lady lady just correctly dressed and things marching this way there was somebody standing by him in the vision and they said the preview of the bride I seen her go by they come on this side and went around so program saw the true Bride of Christ pass and then he said oh then I heard it coming he said the Asian Church you talk about filth here come the European Church he said then I heard a rock-and-roll coming it was Miss America and she didn't even have on any clothes she had papers like newspapers grey hold in front of her dancing by rock-and-roll Miss America the church I stood there in his presence I thought oh God as a minister if that's the best we could do oh oh you know how you feel I thought oh god hide me if I could just get away from here if all that we've done all that we've tried to produce is this one it's produced all this preaching has produced this a rock and roll Church and then when all than women passed by he says short hair painted faces he said they were supposed to be virgins the Christ and when she passed by I turned my head and holding this in front of me it was disgraceful he was even covering his face he says I couldn't stand it and him standing there and me that no as the minutes of the church I said oh god I can't look at let me die let me fade away he was so embarrassed by the American Church don't you get embarrassed when you see churches like that and as soon as it went out so now the American church is past now which part of the vision are you in are you part of that American Church are you part of this next church it's coming up I hope you're a part of this next church coming up I believe you are and as soon as it went out every time he said one of them would come they go in a certain place they would drop off so those churches are going down to hell he says then I heard something like onward Christian soldiers I looked and Here Come the sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way back down their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the gospel she was the word I'll say it again she was the word the other church was not the word this church was the word Amen they looked like one out of every nation I was looking at as they passed by and seen them passed by instead of going down he said they started going up amen I noticed one of them trying to or three of them trying to get out of line and I screamed stay vine and the vision left mean I was standing in the room screaming stay vine stay in line like that amen which part of the vision are you church I think if we had a little spiritual eyes or can we put some ice a bone tonight get out some ice up get out of your Bible here bought your Bible and get out some ice out of here rub it on your eyes which part of you are you in the vision tonight we're definitely not the denominational going down but we are either if by faith we are either the church that's staying in line the whole time or trying to step out a little bit and enjoy some things of the world and we need to hear brother Ram scream out say stay back in line get back in line run from the worldly things so which one are you which one are you Church let's be the one that always stays in life that always follows God's rules amen the one who's not I'm not attracted by the things of the world I'm only attracted to the level of Jesus Christ amen we shouldn't need the Prophet to scream out get back in life get back to loving God get back to revival in your heart get back to loving the preaching in the loving the Bible and love we shouldn't need that we should already love it amen but you're part of the vision somewhere tonight how many want to be that pure bride now what if God revealed that to you tonight that you were the one from America that was you and you were not out of line what would you knew you'd probably you just rejoiced and says thank you Lord hallelujah I'm staying in life no the Prophet does another yell at me because I'm already listening to Jesus amen I'm listening Jesus so much I'm already staying in line oh thank you Lord that's what we need to do tonight see ourselves in the vision how many want to see yourself in the vision the bram said she has to be molded and made in the image of Christ and Christ is the word he said there cannot be one thing added to the word so this bride was getting out of line she was starting to add to the word well we can do this and we're allowed to this we're allowed to do that and the Prophet said stay and stay in line stop adding to the word just stay with the pure Word of God don't overlook the word can you see yourself in the in the vision praise the Lord beyond the current of time this is from rejected King May 15 1960 brother man was the it was a different it wasn't like any vision he ever had he called it the translation when he went behind the curtain of time and when I hit that little place I never seen so many people come running screaming all our precious brother and I looked and young women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother Here Come young men in the brilliance of young manhood and their eyes glistening look like stars on a darkened night beautiful he said their teeth as wide as pearls he said and they were screaming grabbing me screaming all our precious brother and I stopped and I looked and I was young I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this and these young women throwing their arms around me talked about how their bodies were changed and men and women can hug in that dimension because all the sex glands are gone Jesus said they'll be just like the angels which means angels don't have physical bodies they don't have sex glands right that's what Jesus said he said and he said there was no yesterday or no tomorrow they never got tired I never seen such pretty women all my life they had hair down their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just hugging me it wasn't a hug like my own sister sitting here would hug me they were not kissing I was not kissing them it was something he said I don't have the vocabulary he said perfection wouldn't touch it and I looked this way in that way and we're coming by the thousands and I said I don't understand this and alas he said here come hope his first wife that was my first wife she run and never said my husband now look at this doesn't say my husband she hugged me and said my precious brother and when she hugged me there was another woman standing there that hugged me and then a hope heard this woman so home just hugged him quickly and it's hard hugging other women because God has no respecter of persons and the church shouted look at my man I said what's this I let throw Grantha I can understand this but hope seemed like a guest of honor she was no different but just like a guest of honor to hope didn't get any special privileges above everybody else she didn't even call him husband just called him my brother and then I heard a voice and you know the rest of it program said thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all that was there hey man Laurie so can you can you see yourself in that vision if God takes me and I diagnose the grave I can see myself running all our precious brother branham give him a quick hug and and say o our precious brother James browning or anyone that's going on before you would just love everybody you know hold grudges my brother Graham should have done that or and people should have done that we shouldn't have any grudges here we should have divine love here amen so do you see yourself in that vision you can love everybody can love all God's children and you're not trying to exalt people above other people you don't have any respect to the person's divine love is filled your heart and you just want to see people saved in heaven and you want to hug them and call them precious brother sister can you see yourself in that vision I can see myself in that mission I can see myself in the other vision to you I'm just trying to stay in line I'm gonna stay in line always got shot at me no one's gotta beg me to pray read my Bible come to church nobody's got begged me to study I love studying I love preach the Word of God I'm just gonna stay in line for the Jose I'm gonna stay in line I'm just gonna do what God's calling me to do I'm gonna see all God's people as precious you're all precious to me and everybody here should be precious to you now the last dream brother branham said his mom didn't have many dreams but when she did they came to pass and this isn't it as the rising of the Sun March I'm sorry April 18 1965 this was when brother started just started preaching and his mom had a dream and standing by the side of three steps oh brother I'm standing by the side of three steps here we have one step so imagine one two three brother I'm standing right next to the three steps and you know why that is because he's the one that preached the three works of grace and he said he preached out his whole ministry God revealed that's the way to be saved justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost he said and I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit that highway amen he said and then on the highways a little pearly white line run right up to the doors of heaven to the pearly gates can you imagine that that's what we're happening at that's what's happening right now first god amen we're supposed to walk up three steps get the baptism the Holy Ghost once we get the baptism the Holy Ghost our feet should stay on this white narrow path and we should keep our eyes on the pearly gates amen they're going to open one for me because I'm born again I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm walking on God's narrow road I can see myself in that vision praise God I'm walking the narrow road hallelujah and brother have said if that ain't my message exactly today justification sanctification baptism only goes and I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps and be able to walk that way and then he said a lady in spiked heeled shoes high-heeled shoes tried to come and said wait a minute sister you can't walk that highway with that and she said ah don't believe him he's a madman don't believe him I'll show you I can be justified Satan if I feel the Holy Ghost and still walk like that and I just let her go that's the same way people are today with brother Branham oh brother Graham wasn't right about that and he didn't he didn't preach before he wasn't a prophet he wasn't all these things like that I'll be careful what you're listening teachers that man was the prophet of God and you've got to respect him if you expect to make it on that white narrow road because he's that seventh angel he's that seven star that's shining his life is that example that we've all got to attain to that shining light of the the gospel the fire of Jesus Christ amen I just let her let her go I couldn't know more about it couldn't stop her and she jumped on the highway looked back and said see I told you I can't walk it see they can pretend to act like they're Holy Ghost field for a while but pretty soon their folly will find them out she tried she tried to impersonate it and can you imagine and spiked high some of your sisters I may be that warm I I never warm you know he tried to run the path and there'd the pearly gates she look good good I can you know I can but I can live the Holy Ghost live and wear high heels no man said no you can't he said you know the Bible said they'd have outstretched necks he quotes Isaiah chapter 3 which that's the text I used to make that high-heeled video they got they got one time yeah and they got high stretch necks and they're tinkling as they go on all the descriptions of high heels and there's nothing new Under the Sun they had high heels Israel at high heels just like America's got high heels today amen after a while the road got narrower and narrower hallelujah and that woman was falling into those flames she started reeling mincing like that and off she fell off the narrow road but Ram said he heard the screams of the flames and everything like that and brother BAM said he turned around to the people and said see and brother Branham says she just obeyed everything but one word one word don't wear high heels don't push out yourself you know try to attract men science has proved it women are get more sexual looks and lust when they wear high heels science has proved it it pushes out their body it puts our body in a way that's not supposed to be now can you see yourself in this one can you see yourself I'm walking on the Kings Highway I've been justified like this I got baptized in Jesus Christ name who is commit of I got sanctified by the Holy Spirit see one step now I'm not stepping up here you're crazy if you think I'm stepping up here but one that there's three steps beautiful here we go 1 2 3 I've got the bats and once you get the Holy Ghost you're not done you've got to walk the narrow road honey when I walk that narrow road and as you as you go longer and Christianity is gets more narrow you gotta walk you gotta watch your life more closely now more than ever don't you brother Jose you don't get Lacs on God you've got to be more careful how you serve the Lord because Jesus said it's a narrow way that leads to life broad is the way that leads to destruction and you got to make sure every step of my life every move I make everything I do is right along this narrow road we don't get cold on God we know we don't get a weak on God we got to stay strong in the Holy Spirit we've got to keep our eye Salvin orient in our eyes so we can see that white road that leads to the pearly gates can't you see the bright lights shine it's just about home time Church I can see my father staying at the pearly gates amen but it's a narrow road what is it God's put me to the test cuz he knows I'll overcome your teacher give you a test because they know you studied well at least I hope you study that's why I give tests make sure they studied make sure they learn what they're supposed to learn now I'm gonna just go through this real quick here here's brother BAE I'm giving the altar call so how does he end this sermon about you know John shouting and all universe heard him Hansie end the sermon like this before we do that senator friend or lukewarm church member do you just have a membership in a church and do not have a membership or if you only have a membership you'd be pretty well as well off without it you need a birth you must come by the blood you must come to something that spots the sin away - there's no more remembrance of it how does brother Graham and this mighty sermon about John shouting and rejoicing Jesus taking the book he's saying we all must be born again if you haven't made preparation yet to meet the Lamb in the air and by the look at this by the power invested me by my commission given by Almighty God and ministered to me be by an angel a pillar of light I charge you the name of Jesus Christ don't try to meet him with only a membership of a lodge he said a church of the earth now notice the Prophet is charging the people just like Jesus charged his followers to be born again you must be born again but I'm saying you cannot try to get to heaven and make the rapture with a church membership I charge you I command you you must seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost the word charge means the command or order he said come while the mediator as far as I know is thrown throw making intercessions because there will come a day when you'll want to come and there'll be no mediator that's speaking the tribulation receive the hour we're living in the seven churches in the mysteries of God become what they have at the vindicated spirit of God showing everything that he promised in the last days how much more time is left sinner friend come father there may be some here tonight here without hope and they are intelligent human beings and now if the blood still lays on the mercy seat let the lamb walk down from the throne to their heart tonight look at this in this beautiful language and reveal to them that they are lost and with bloody hands say come well it's time to come in that beautiful but man paints it like Jesus will come all the way down to your heart with bloody hands as they come to me while there's time they'll show you his nail scarred hands he'll show you the scar and his side he'll show he'll become so personal he'll come right to knock on your heart's door how many have opened that door of their heart to him how many have done that how many can say you know what this was like I can say amen to that I remember I never won this I always ran from the Lord I had never won to surrender but when I finally surrendered I sold out lock stock and barrel because I seen those nail-scarred hands what he did for me and the least I can do is give all the rest of my life to Christ come all there's time he said I commit this message door with my prayer to your hands do whatever you will father in Jesus name I'm gonna stop right there it's 8:31 if we can't let's just stand for a moment malachi come play a song here I just want to pray for everybody before we look at the resignation real quick by God's grace let's just stand if we can let's to enter our feet I was going to read all these times look at all these times Paul talks about charging charge Timothy and and God charged Abraham and all these charges brother branham charge the people I command you seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're not born again so that's just our heads for a moment by God's grace how would a prophet end a sermon about John shouting rejoicing over the seven seals they're gonna be open he ended by saying we need to be born again we need to make sure like John that we have a representation in heaven we have to know that we're predestinated to be there we're never been able to prove to everybody and say look my name's on the book I can show you my name's and Landsberg a life but we've got to live like our life proves that our name is on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm going to raise your hands say brother Jesse pray for me I want to live like my name's in the Lamb's Book of Life Heavenly Father I pray in Jesus Christ's name Lord you see these hands raised tonight father bless them Oh God my hands are up oh god I hope my name is there babe I'm hoping I'm I'm making everything sure I'm making my car election sure I'm doing everything I can learn and I pray you'd help the people to do the same if they feel like they're not born again I pray God let them seek you Lord let them dedicate themselves to fasting and prayer to know that they're born again dear God hallelujah because your prophet charged us Paul charge Timothy Amen you charged Abraham to do what he did Lord you've given us a charge in this day not to just be a church member but to be a living epistle a Holy Ghost filled Christian Oh God granite Lord may every person find that they've stepped on the first step the second the third and now they walk in this narrow careful diligent Christian life dear God well they know there's no room for air I never want to break out of the perfect will of God I always want to stay in step with the Holy Spirit bless those hands Oh God that went up give them strength Lord give them ice out so they can keep their eyes on that narrow road and Lord look up every now and then to see heaven's gates ready to be open wide they can see their father standing at the door dear God let no one fall off that narrow white strip dear God that path of eternal life that way of eternal life granite Lord Jesus
