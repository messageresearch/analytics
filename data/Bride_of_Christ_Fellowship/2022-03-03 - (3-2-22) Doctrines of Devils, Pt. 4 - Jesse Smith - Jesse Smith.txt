TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second peter three yeah second peter i'm sorry second peter 2 18 please second peter 218. i'll be cautious of the time here i know uh we just gotta be careful here you know people are people need some good rest you know tonight so i'm gonna try to be careful on the time second beater 2 18 and 19. i like to look at doctrines of devils again tonight and the reason we're doing that is to expose the enemy you know satan hates to be exposed right he hates to be called out he hates to he likes to hide where nobody sees him but when we preach these things it brings us a reality when we're battling those evil spirits then we can expose the enemy and cast him down in jesus name amen that's why we're preaching on this by the grace of god and also to give us discernment for the future and also for the present so i trust these sermons have been a blessing to you i believe this is the 11th part on just doctrine we started with all the good doctrine jesus doctrine all these wonderful things and now we've kind of been looking at these evil doctrines to give us discernment in this last day here this this final age we'd say before the rapture second peter 2 18-19 second peter 2 18 and 19. let's read 18 together and i'll just read 19 by myself so let's eight do 18 together and i'll do student 19 by myself verse 18. let's read that on three ready one two three for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantedness those that were clean escape from them who live in error what a scripture so they use these great swelling words but they're vain they don't mean what they say right and how do they attract people with these through lust of the flesh so they say these great things and they use lust of the flesh to make it make life more easy right uh to make it seem like uh you got to be rich or you gotta if you're spiritual you'll be rich right verse 19 i'll read verse 19 while they promised them liberty so these preachers always promising people liberty but they themselves are the servants of corruption that's why you must watch the fruit of any preacher jesus said a tree is known by its fruit watch the uh watch the results of someone's life and that will tell you if they're a real christian or not he says uh moving on uh they are servants of corruption for of whom a man has overcome of the same is he brought into bondage let's have a word of prayer here as we approach the throne of grace if you have any on your heart just make an owner to god and we just trust the lord will speak to you tonight heavenly father we just come again reverently lord our hands are high heart full of praise or my heart is full of praise you are so good you're so great you're so merciful thank you jesus i was lost and could not see but you did not give up on me lord god hallelujah to save me from my guilt and shame hallelujah thank you god hallelujah you rose from the grave thank you god for lord conquering my sin paying for my sin lord and delivering me and setting me free imputing unto me your righteousness in each one of us here tonight lord that are believers by faith through grace lord god we just thank you god and we ask you to minister here to the needs in the congregation please heal our sick and afflicted we pray and we pray your gran every blessing upon your people tonight that they have need of in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god okay we'll try to just be right on the word here as we can upset a little time as a reminder god bless you and appreciate everybody pressing out to the house of god tonight so we want to just briefly just look at these you know uh sunday we just looked at really one doctrine on sunday but um these doctrines of devils i hope that was a blessing sunday we basically looked at god always wants you to be healthy and wealthy right we kind of looked at that one the main one on sunday there but we now preach on six of them these are these two are definitely called doctrines of devils by the bible and of course we know this i'm sorry this one is the third one is as well uh the third one is kind of talked about with gluttony and so forth like that because the bible speaks of gluttony as a sin saying the rapture's already happened or we're living in the millennium or something like that uh and then once saved always say we see how that was uh that's a doctrine of a devil lets people live in sin and and try to think that they've actually repented when they haven't and church i was thinking about this uh this week did you know that god told moses that god would blot out names in the old testament did you know that in the old testament god said he would blot names out god was going to destroy israel and moses said god take me kill me instead of the people. and god said no moses he said i'm going to he said i'll blot out whoever sinned against me. so what i'm trying to show you is that in the old testament there was an ames blotted off the book of life and the new testament there's names blotted off the book of life and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah but if you remain in the faith if you confess your sins if you walk in the light as he's in the light then nothing will remove your name off the book praise god because you've just met god's requirements you've done what he said you told he said repent and be baptized you shall be filled with the holy ghost you've done that praise god and then your name remains on the book amen hallelujah praise god amen well let's look that up if you got a minute let's go to i think it's uh exodus 34. or not exodus 33. but let me exit out of here and we'll see we can look it up real quick here his name will i blot out him will i blotter i believe the scripture says i'm sorry exodus 32 there it is yeah if you want you can just look up there maybe uh no no i don't like that view okay that's a good view okay okay look at verse 31 32 31 and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned the great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not look at this blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written talk about love for the people wishing yourself to be cursed wishing yourself to be lost rather than the people and the church said i mean you couldn't have any greater love than that that you would have your name off the book of life so that other people could be saved jesus said no ma no greater love hath have this than a man give his life for someone else praise god so and now look what god says god said well does god say well no i never blot out names off the book no that's not what god says god says the lord said to moses whosoever sinned against me him will i blot out of my book praise god so if god blotted out names in the old testament won't he do in the new of course well now we since we said that scripture let's read this one did you know paul said the same thing as moses i believe he said okay it's not wish i think he said uh yeah go to romans 11 i believe it's there romans 11. for some reason i don't have it uh right on the uh right on my mind here well it's not coming up there oh oh maybe it's a cursed maybe a cursed any bible reader know which what i'm talking about where paul says he wishes he was accursed for israel's sake there it is yep i found it okay sorry about that sometimes these things just come to me and i want to just show it to you right now because we're talking about it now moses said curse me and put me off the book of life so that people could be saved paul said the same thing amen moses was the writer of the old testament paul wrote the majority of the new testament amen both writers praise god we're able to say lord he said for i wish i wish i could be a curse from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh see there's something about every believer that you want to see people save so bad that sometimes you wish you could be lost so that they could be saved amen that's what the bible says twice i just showed you and the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established that's why when they were martyred brother when stephen was martyred and jesus died on the cross they said father forgive them then say father send them to hell right they had a merciful spirit they had a gracious spirit praise god father forgive them they don't know what they're doing amen okay now let me show you where jesus said if you don't overcome he blots the names out but i'm glad we got overcomers here tonight praise god never never think yourself a judas never think yourself a failure always know i do fall short but that's why the blood's there amen hallelujah because other people they blaspheme the blood but you love god and you thank god for the blood amen this red letter words right so jesus said he that overcomes the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not so that means those who don't overcome will be blotted out i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels and the church said so i've just showed you plain proof while people can have their name on the book of life but god can blot it off and that real believers wish they could uh you know be be cursed so that other people could be saved amen which is really divine love that's holy love praise god amen all right well that worked out pretty good i found that pretty quick so i'm thankful to lord thank you jesus for helping me find that okay so everybody can see that now we looked at the healthy and wealthy thing on sunday god doesn't always make you a wealthy if you're a christian god doesn't always make you healthy if you're a christian right you can pray see god but god has a specific testimony for everyone amen now i've said it like this before but also i've said god wants to heal 99 of the time right because think about think think of in our lives every time we got sick do we normally get well yeah but does it take a few a few months or a few days or hopefully not months but yes usually takes a little time so in most cases god does want to heal now maybe 99 is a little bit of a stretch i'm not saying that's gospel i'm just saying it seems like the most time we get sick we pretty soon get well by god's grace right so it seems like god most of the time wants to heal but it depends it's his will on how that happens whether it's miracle or divine healing miracles instant divine healing takes time and they're two separate gifts brother that's a good good good study for us one day we'll have to hit that one day miracles are instant happens right now like johnny well no no no that would be uh that'd be divine healing too because it took two weeks for that little uh that cyst on his wife's foot to vanish two weeks so that's divine healing that's not a miracle that's divine healing slow healing okay now getting to tonight uh now remember i preached on these remember these 18 or 19 fierce sins remember these i'm not going to go over this but any doctrine that teaches the following are doctrines of devils so any church that allows you to love yourself i mean worship yourself and live live luxuriously right you should take care of yourself you should be healthy right you should get good sleep you should eat good food you should exercise you should do that that's not self-love that's just using wisdom that's just taking care of the body god gave you because your body member is not your own your body's the temple of the holy ghost amen and if i'm healthier then that means god can use me more than if i'm laying the bed sick amen hallelujah if i take care of my temple then god can use me more for his glory now any any church that teaches you you can be covetous that's that that's a lie that's the doctrine of a devil right like you hear those uh tv preachers say oh you drive by a house and you speak to that house and that's going to be yours oh come on that's that's just that's such borderline covetousness it's different if god inspires you to say that but just because you want a bigger house or want a better car doesn't mean that's god's will all the time amen god doesn't always reward people with all kinds of money or all kinds of natural blessings right so uh well i'm not gonna i'm gonna go through these faster right so anyone that teaches you to boast and how great you are we're gonna get to that tonight uh that's a doctrine of a devil anyone that teaches you to be proud and know everything that's a doctrine of a devil now that song we just saying we proudly stand and say that's i guess i should change that word we should probably say humbly stand and say or boldly that would be a better word yeah i got to get that song we got to change those lyrics somehow uh but what we're saying is we're not ashamed of the gospel that's basically what we're saying we're not saying we're filled with sinful pride but we're saying we're thankful to be christians and we'll stand for jesus amen he said if you confess me before men i'll confess you before the angels amen anyone that teach you to blaspheme the truth that's a doctrine of a devil anything that teaches children to disobey parents is a devil right anyone that teaches you to be unthankful is a devil unholy right uh without natural affection truce breakers false accusers anything that teaches you not to have self-control is a devil amen anything that teaches you to be fierce instead of tame that's a devil despisers are those that are good that's a devil to be teaching you to be a traitor is a devil to be heady unst or unstable reckless that's a devil something that teaches you to be prideful high minded anything that teaches you to love pleasures more than god is of the devil amen that's a doctrine of a devil right uh anything that teaches you to just have an outside religion but not a real religion that's a doctrine of a devil okay i told you i was gonna go through fast okay now now now so-called message churches and uh use great swelling words of vanity so that's this is our scripture that we read so it's preachers that use these great words that seem so great but are they true most the time they're not right when they're using great swelling words of vanity because vanity is uselessness they're useless words okay now here's the one i want to look at tonight now um i'm going to look at this one right here tonight there's a movement around churches that believe our truth that we are the greatest uh christians of all time that if you live in this day and you follow the rebel the bible revelations that were the greatest of all time i disagree with that i believe that's a doctrine of a devil i do not see any scripture that teaches that and i'm open to correction i'm i'll be corrected by anybody i'm gonna reach out to brother william for that other issue there uh yes sister of faith right and so there's a great bound that's a great question great question that's it uh so if you have your bible um first uh corinthians 11 verse 1. first corinthians i'll just pull it up here so you can see a sister yeah god bless you take care hannah god bless you hannah may god heal you soon in jesus name first corinthians 11 1. that's a great question fantastic now here here sister why we we feel like it's okay and as long as we say with the right spirit okay just uh hope you understand what i'm saying paul said be follower be followers of me even as i also am of christ okay now that um i want to i want to balance that out too though because uh brother branham didn't write the bible paul wrote the bible so there's a huge there there's to me there's a big huge difference god had brother or god had paul write the bible and then said if anybody adds to or takes away they're cursed that's quite that's quite a uh that's quite an amen to that that writing okay and so yes i would agree um i would agree uh you know maybe the following maybe is not the best word but we we around here we've been in this long enough that we understand when we say we're following brother branham we mean the scriptures that he's pointing to yeah the scriptures that he's pointing to because the bible uh he says follow me as i follow follow christ and then the bible also says be followers of other churches okay so it all depends how you use that word follow that's a great question um let me pull that up here so you can see that yes yes yes yes the scripture that brother bram yes amen the scripture is brother i'm pointing to you so here paul said be followers of god he also said be followers of me what do you mean we got two people we're following well in one way well because god's the one that gave paul the bible now um yeah here's let me do this one here so you can see that one this will be a good one for you in other words paul told the thessalonicans okay they're also that's a church in turkey as well for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god well i thought we were only supposed to follow god i thought we were supposed to follow paul well we can follow churches too it all depends how you define follow and that in this case it means and i think everybody understand this no church is perfect because we always have sin right here in our bodies and you follow me around long enough you're going to see me make a mistake i'm going to sin i'm going to fall short of god's glory i'm going to let you down so it doesn't mean follow like worship but it just means watch the godly life that they live and then imitate that okay because the ultimate following is following christ and that that's what paul said we're followers of god but in other words but also god has true believers the bible said god will not leave himself without a witness on the earth amen so at all times in history there's always been at least one or two or maybe more believers that people can follow and know they were true servants of christ i believe i'm one of them i believe you should follow my bible teaching as i point to the bible too right you should follow the churches right you should follow their godly example now we have lots lots of other scriptures on that one but that's a great question the bible says obey them that have the rule over you that doesn't mean everything i tell you to do it just means everything that i point to in the bible that you obey fantastic question that is just a great great question sister great question and yeah i could uh you know i could reword that and that's why i need help like i i need feedback like that you know i want to word it the right way but if you look at those other scriptures you know you'll see that okay amen praise god thank you now satan will use that though as you know sister you've seen another turn you've seen it in bad churches right where they use that follow me like you got to worship me basically right so as long as the person has the holy ghost and their obedience holy ghost that follow will only mean imitate the bible imitate the bible doctrines that i live but a sinful person will say you gotta follow me and do everything i say and no matter what don't question me fear me you know if you if you're you're against me you're against god i mean that's nonsense okay amen great question amen thank you yeah great question now here's why i'm bringing this out i believe it's a doctrine of the devil to say that we're the greatest christians of all time i believe any holy ghost-filled christian is all the same now there'll be different levels of rewards but only god knows who's the greatest of those but i don't think just because we lived in the year 2022 that we will be we'll have the greatest reward in heaven i do not believe that but see there's a lie coming through and this was this was a two three months ago that uh the leaders in jeffersonville put this out they said dear perfect word bride see how they're exalting the people it's the greatest age of all time with the greatest messenger of all time who is gathering the greatest people of all time that's worship that's idolatry that's pride and they just put this all over the internet see i found some of these things i'm like i gotta share this with the church because i don't want us to think we're better than anybody else if you are saved tonight it is by grace which means it's an unmerited favor amen and everything you do after that just is because you appreciate god saving you amen right but brother brother man said by the blood of jesus uh the person that's been saved ten years is no different than the person who got saved five minutes ago amen because god just washed away all of his sins amen now the one who served god longer will have rewards if they're faithful right and the other one can you know he can serve god more but it's not like it's a competition it's not like that and we should never prop ourselves up like like my wife was saying you know i was talking here before service who knows anyone who suffered more than paul for the gospel of jesus christ he was shipwrecked three times he was beaten five times whipped you know five times 39 times for five times so almost 200 times he was whipped with a cat of nine tails can you imagine his back would look like hamburger five times he was constantly getting robbed he was constantly being beaten he was stoned to death and god raised him up amen who do you know who's gone through just half of those things i don't know anybody i don't know anybody so who do you think is going to get a greater reward us or paul well i think paul that's what i would say i think i think a mind of wisdom would say that but a prideful mind would say we're the greatest of all time and what have you ever suffered in your life that can compare anything to the bible like these by that the bible said they wandered around in sheep skin can you imagine just having sheep skin to wear that's all the clothes you got is sheepskins you have nothing else the bible said they had to wander around in caves brother austin they didn't have their own home just just to survive they had to wonder just from the standing for the message of their days they'd go hang out in caves do you think they had running water and toilets in there of course not and we get discouraged if we have a little mind battle right and these people are you know battling for their lives amen so see i believe that's a lie i believe that's a doctrine of a devil to say we're the greatest christians of all time i'll be that's a lie i can't see that in the bible and he closes the sermon by saying this and then these are the scriptures he uses to say these but they these scriptures never say we're the greatest of all time they never say that i checked i've read those for years none of those talk about saying we're greater than anybody else all we can hope to is be the same praise god and yes there'll be little variations like jesus said some will bring a hundred fold some will bring sixty some will bring thirty so there's at least three levels of rewards but listen we all got eternal life amen we all get to see jesus amen right uh malachi read that scripture your brother austin if you're faithful with 10 talents jesus said i'll make you rule over 10 cities there's i mean there are certain rewards for a different amount of faithfulness but we're all going to be in heaven amen we're all going to have new bodies amen we're all going to live for all eternity amen hallelujah and just because we live in the last day doesn't make us any greater it just means we live in the last day that's all it means see this is such vanity even jesus listen even jesus wouldn't say who would be the greatest yet this man thinks he can choose who's the greatest so this man is either putting himself on the same plane as jesus right because he he says now i know who the greatest is or he's putting himself above jesus like he knows more than jesus he don't know more than jesus jesus was humble in his humanity this man must not be i know that's rough but that's the truth jesus said to john and uh james's mother i'm sorry yeah james and john ye shall need drink of my cup which was martyrdom and be baptized with the baptism baptized with the holy ghost baptism but to sit on my right and left it is not mine to give but it should be given to them for it is whom prepared to my father even jesus didn't know who gets the closest the best reward would be sitting right next to jesus i don't know amen you imagine the person who sits right next to him they can reach over sister naomi and put their finger in his nail scar palm amen hallelujah that's the reward they get hallelujah they can they can look down and put their hand right on the uh of the holes in his feet hallelujah that's what he told thomas he said feel me touch me see that i've really said amen hallelujah the one closest to him can lead to this muslim like john amen that'd be the greatest reward to me but jesus doesn't even know who's going to be there because the father didn't make it known to him it wasn't his for the flesh to give it was for the holy ghost inside of him to give that's a deep thought but remember jesus was both fully man and fully god and brother ram said this is the worst age they're saying it's the greatest age now i know what they're saying it's it'd be the greatest to live to live until jesus rapture so you don't die i know what they're saying but brother ham never said this what they're saying i understand what they're saying now here's a second blog post with more great see how these are swelling words of vanity like how would you feel if someone's trying to tell you're the greatest christian there ever was would you feel prideful would you accept that or would you would you cast that down i would cast it down i'm like i'm only 41. what have i ever done i've never done a missionary trip i've never i've never saved souls like 3 000 at a time i mean three thousand souls in the day of pentecost one sermon three thousand so three thousand baptisms amen i've never walked on water right i've never had anybody get healed just from my shadow and yet this lying devil is exalting us where a lot of times i wonder how much time they're spending on their phone instead of praying or reading their bibles i wonder how much money they've sent over to missionaries that really preach amen that really preach and by the way just let you know i reached out to a real missionary this week and i said do you know any missionaries that are out on the field so i can send them money he's like i don't know any and this is a guy who's gone to egypt iran and he don't know anybody that's traveling missionary work so i'm a little bit uh uh well what i know is we need to pray for more missionaries amen the bible said pray that the lord of the harvest will send laborers into the harvest amen hallelujah like i'm trying to give away money sister brother i'm trying to give away money to missionaries but nobody's going he said the doors are open now some of the covert restrictions have uh relaxed but we'll have to wait praise god we have to wait i just thought that was interesting nobody's going ah so that's a great swelling words oh you're the greatest christians of all the greatest of all time that's a lie that's a lie we thank god for the blood we're all under the same blood we're all in the same grace but let us not be exalted remember it's just like jesus's disciples remember before they got the holy ghost they were arguing who's the greatest oh my there who i'm greater than you you're greater no no i'm greater than you i'm great at you here we are today these these people around the same truth around the message arguing about who's greater than who if you're arguing about or trying to say who's greater than others you're you got your eyes off the rock the real thing you got your eyes off christ you're trying to worry about who's greater than anybody else just serve jesus get your eyes on christ get your eyes off everybody else amen and get your eyes on jesus amen here's another blog post with uh they're basically telling you you can go speak a world and go live on it which that we know there's a quote there there's a quote where brother adam says that but he's just talking about the power of the word of god but see i always take the other side the devil takes that quote and tries to puff people up with that and i always say the other side instead of speaking the world and going living on it why don't you speak to your life right now and live a godly christian life right now in this world amen why don't you change some instead of running away from all these people why don't you get into their lives and try to win some souls amen you know what why would you want to go live on another world and abandon everybody why don't you want to be here and try to get souls to save out of hell amen see how the enemy takes that quote and he makes it he just puffs people up with it oh you have so much power you can go speak in a world and live on it well yeah you might but that's not god's will right now god don't want you to run from the world god doesn't want you to isolate yourself from the world he wants to be the salt of the earth amen so here's another uh deer stimulated bride letter he says we can close the heavens we can shut this and i said no the two prophets do that and if so if i'm wrong somebody show me where the people in jeffersonville have shut the heavens and it don't rain or don't snow we just went through winter has it anybody shot the heavens and it didn't snow see there it's all this great swelling words of vanity like they're like they're doing all these supernatural works they're they're they're misunderstanding the scripture the scripture says the two prophets shut the heavens so it doesn't rain for three and a half years during the days of their prophecy amen or do that or listen look you can do whatever you want to you can speak whatever you want to no you can't anybody with any bible discernment would know that's wrong you can't do anything you want you just do what god wants you to do like we're talking about we can't even speak our own healing unless god tells us to do it amen oh whatever we want to do no that's a selfish prideful spirit a real christian doesn't say my will a real christian says thy will be done see this is what the spirits were battling today prideful spirits the enemy will be slayed by the word that proceeds from our mouth for a sharper than two-edged sword now that's true we could even call for a hundred billion tons of flies if we wanted to call them no you couldn't no there's only if not if you wanted to if god wanted to send them they're talking see they're talking about the two moses down in egypt and they're saying well we could do that well no you can't unless god tells you to do it and if so what have you ever what have you spoken have you spoken one ton he's talking about 100 million tons have you ever spoken one ton of flies no how about one pound of flies have you ever spoken that see it's these great swelling words of pride and vanity it's getting people to off the mark of just doing a simple living a simple humble christian life loving your neighbor forgiving those that have sinned against you praying and repenting amen trying to win souls of jesus draw closer to god it gets their minds way up on these vain things instead of getting on the real gospel of jesus christ amen just vain that's not going to help anybody speak flies into existence ridiculous the prophets will do that amen because they're anointed to do it hallelujah that's their ministry that's not our ministry see they're trying to make they're trying to make their church feel like they're the two prophets i could say something i don't i don't know if that'd be the right thing to say i just got a little bit zeal right now here so whatever now look whatever we say now see again we it's about us see it's about them instead about christ it's not whatever we say it's whatever god says it's going to happen because it's the word of god coming from the mouth of god we will have complete supreme control of the earth for we are an amateur god i don't think we're going to have complete control i think jesus is going to have complete control see it's just it's this puffed up thing where it's you you you we we got the power we can speak anything we can do whatever we want no you can't do whatever you want even jesus said i don't do my will but i do the father's will god is the god of universe everywhere but we'll have earth control under our own control when only only if god gives it to us we can speak we can name we can say we can stop nature we can do anything we want it is our inheritance that has been restored i said perhaps but we don't know what that for sure these are swelling words of entity can you believe that people swallow this down they say amen they shout and scream at this why because it's it's self-worship it's pride they love that pride we're not now here's i want to bring this out too we've not been with anything but his original word we've not flirted or even looked at anything else now this i'm going to get to this a little bit these people do not look at anything else except tapes now there's nothing wrong with enjoying the tapes there's nothing wrong with feeding on the tapes and receiving revelation from the tapes but this goes far as worshiping the tapes and looking at nothing else nothing else is that how brother braham did it no brother read books by women brother branham read books by preachers brother ram looked for sources of inspiration outside of his own preaching amen in order to find the truth and then preach us the truth when he found it in the bible amen gloria church this is called behavior there's my 30 minutes can you believe that oh my goodness wow i'm just shocked every time uh they say we say with the voice of god this is cult behavior you can't look at anything else you know that's what cults do they say cut off your family they say don't look at anything else just do our stuff our stuff our stuff our stuff total fear-based control fear-based control that's the only way they're going to keep them that's the only way they're going to keep their money coming too because that's what they're really after money like i said they won't even return my feedback on on their website if they care so much about me to help me why don't they why don't they answer my questions they stop doing that because they don't have any answers now look here now here's a clear example of how they misinterpret the bible look at our sister at the well remember in john chapter four the woman at the well remember that uh brother brown said she didn't have to tarry all night she got the holy ghost then so in other words they're saying the woman at the well when she met jesus got the holy ghost at the well well she didn't get the soul holy ghost she got anointing in the mind of the holy ghost or the human spirit because jesus said the holy ghost cannot be given until what he was glorified so here how they they're misinterpreting quotes without the bible they're saying now oh we can have it we're just like the woman at the well we just got to hear a tape and now we're we're all filled with the holy ghost ridiculous ridiculous no you've got to repent of your sins especially of your pride amen that's what they got to do and so do we pray if we get prideful we've got to repent too all men have to repent for all men and women have fallen short of the glory of god but thank god for the grace of christ amen thank god for that burning fire we talked about that burns you and convicts you and points you to confession and repentance and gets you right back on the straight and narrow amen see misinterpreting the bible vain words all puffed up aren't you glad that we have a sound simple humble godly church aren't you glad i'm so thankful for that i will gladly worship with one two three four five six twelve people on a wednesday night i'd rather have twelve than twelve hundred that believe lies amen and worship tapes and worship men and when it's wickedness amen ah i'm just like just like the old saints of the old days amen we're just we're just a small little number praise god we might be small in number but we're uh but we're by god's grace we're saved and we have our eternal assurance we have blessed assurance jesus is mine over the foretaste of glory divine amen we have glory divine praise god hallelujah now look what it says would you like to have the same spiritual stimulation he's talking about the woman at the well you can but there's only one place to get it and they're basically saying you can't get it from a local church you can only get it from a tape that's what they're saying what's that i'm like what is that well it's it's wonderful sermons of brother branham but they're saying in other words they're saying we don't need living preachers say we just gotta press play and and listen to the tape and that deny that breaks ephesians chapter four which says the preachers the five preaching gifts will preach until we all come in the unity of the faith which means the rapture all right a great question come and drink the best wine and receive the best stimulation by revelation uh as we listen to the tapes yes you're gonna get stimulation revelation on the tapes but it's if you're not careful you're gonna get a simulation of pride amen there it is right there you're gonna get a simulation of uh idolatry if you're not careful and you exalt those tastes and worship and make every of those shapes perfect if you do that you're going to get a spirit of pride now saints this is encouraging cult-like behaviors where you isolate you don't answer questions see they they say we don't even we won't even look out to answer questions and then they deny first peter 3 15 which says to always have an answer for all the questions and the bible says prove all things now i wrote that wrong two s's the bible said prove all things in other words for everything you believe prove it by the bible but they seem content sitting in a bubble they just sit in their cult bubble and never take any criticism this is completely opposite of jesus amen hallelujah remember we looked at the beginning where did jesus go every day brother he went to the temple to teach the people publicly and when he was arrested he said when did i ever hide from you when did i say anything in secret everything i've taught i've taught it before everybody amen and jesus took the hardest questions that's what i love about jesus amen he wasn't scared of that devil amen he wasn't scared to take a question from the audience right he wasn't afraid to take a question from the pharisees or the sadducees either he was not afraid of any questions because god did not give him the spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind he took the hardest ones and then the only reason he stopped getting questions because they got tired of asking him because jesus embarrassed them is that what the bible said the pharisees were gathered together and jesus asked them saying see they've asked him all these questions he says well say who who uh what do you think of christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of david oh oh the messiah is the son of david and he saith to them how does david in the spirit call the lord if the messiah his son how does the messiah's david's son how how can the how can father david call the messiah's son i'm sorry i'll call him lord i'm sorry lord if he's his son how can he call him lord and the lord because then he quotes the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand so i make thine enemies thy footstool if david then call him lord how is he his son if david calls the messiah lord how is he his son because the the messiah had two parts to him he had a human side and he had a divine side hallelujah amen it was god and god sent the son as a perfect human man praise god with no sin amen no sin nature hallelujah praise god that's why david can call him lord because he had no sin he was the lord made flesh amen hallelujah and look after this question they didn't have any more questions left but we can't figure this guy out he's just that's what i found too but i answer people's questions pretty soon i don't even hear from them i answered all their questions well are you going to come back and ask me a question they got done asking me questions because they don't have the answers the bible's got the answers see no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions because i asked jefferson i said well who's the real joseph is billy paul or joseph and nobody answered me they said we just believe every word as thus saith the lord that's a lie they can't give me an answer i said is the third person burning in your heart because here's what happened brother rahm grew in his understanding at first he thought god was three persons but then god showed him god as one person so they worship every word on tape so brother brahm said isn't it great the third person's burning in our hearts tonight so i used that quote and i said well is the third person in your heart because later brother adam said the lord told him he's not three persons he's one person and i said there's a third person in your heart and they said we just leave everything on the tape so they don't know if a third person's inside of them or the one person but we know amen we know not a second person's in our souls not a third person but the one person amen because god is the holy ghost amen there's only one person praise god yeah brother awesome well if it's understood with catholic thought yes it's basically idolatry at the very least it's the spirit of error because they've added to the bible the bible never calls god three persons the bible does say father son only goes but never says there are three persons yeah right there's one name to the father and holy ghost that's what the bible says that's what jesus said and jesus said i come in my father's name so what's the father's name jesus right the lord jesus christ good question brother good very good question very good question see and now they don't even return my emails now okay um i got six minutes here to go 45 minutes okay so bible proof on who is the greatest really yeah i'll try to finish with this what did jesus say jesus said don't be called masters for one is your master even christ but he that grace among you shall be your servant so the greatest ones are the ones who serve other people not wait to be served but the ones who get up and serve other people now what do most preachers do today they get they get people open the doors for them they get people giving them water they get people uh doing everything for them but if that becomes a lifestyle then the people serving are actually greater than the preachers and not that we're trying to be you know it's not a competition like i said but the fact is those who serve others are greater that's why brother makes a strange statement and i've never understood it but brother branham says he says women may receive greater rewards than many men because who's the one that really serves a lot so it could be that way now i'm not saying that's bible doctrine but i'm just saying that's such a strange statement to make but then if you look at this you could see it like i'm talking about a lazy man he might go to work but then he gets home and he's all lazy he's watching tv and sports and the woman's constantly cleaning praying taking care of the kids you know who's the one really serving and the guys at work being lazy yeah he's getting paid but he's lazy on the job you know who's the one really serving and the church said amen amen now i'm not saying that's i'm not saying that's absolute but it's just strange why would abraham say that now what we need is strong men and strong we need both of them to be servants and the bible says you serve one another amen hallelujah serve one another we must serve one another okay and now look whosoever shall exalt himself like call himself the greatest christian of all time is that what you mean jesus jesus said whosoever shall exalt himself or call himself the greatest christian of all time shall be humbled see i don't want to call myself the greatest christian because i'm not i know i'm not there's no way i am no way not even close i as long as i'm just one of the christians right i know i'm not the greatest never will be not even close not even close right exactly right yeah we haven't seen jesus and visions and spent hours in his presence writing the bible yeah exactly right yeah and all those men did and jesus said those 12 men will judge the 12 tribes of israel now we might have cities brother but they got tribes and tribes do many cities so that's why i believe the 12 apostles will have the greatest rewards and i could be wrong i'm just saying that's what the bible says yeah because they they left everything and they they died as martyrs brother each one of them gave their life except john he was only one that didn't have to because whatever god had the god to have him god had to have him write the book of revelation but jesus said if you exalt yourself and call yourself the greatest you'll be a base he said but if you humble yourself god will make you great amen hallelujah these lies see these doctrines of devils you're the greatest of all time you're the greatest like i've heard that man say give yourselves a round of applause why would i praise myself why would i have nothing worth a praise for if anything good comes out of my life it wasn't me it was christ amen it was just that i finally surrendered and said god help me to crucify this selfishness help me to crucify my lust and help me to do what's right what you told me to do so he gets all the glory amen all i did was just surrender finally and remember like i told you that i think austin well yeah we're going to get crowns but you know what we're going to do we're going to cast some out in jesus feet praise god you take the crown you're it's your spirit that conquered all this for me you're the one who died for me amen it's your name that casts out the devils it wasn't my name it was your name amen hallelujah i get that uh fiery indignation when i start preaching on this all the pride and all the swelling great swelling words of vanity people accept today brother ramsay you want to get closer to god he said humble yourself more he said say he said say i there's so much i don't know instead of how much i know that's he said that's how you get close to god humble yourself don't tell everybody how much you know he said go with the attitude of how much more i want to learn about god okay i'm going to skip down and close with that here i had a whole lot but i'm i'm not going to get to all that see i'm not going to get out let's look at a few quotes from brother brahma and we'll take it back to the bible yeah go to he go to hebrews 11 hebrews 11. we'll close with this thought i mentioned it earlier just you know because it was on my mind and in my notes here hebrews 11 right at the end of the new testament go down to verse 35 hebrews 11 35 it says women receive their dead raised to life again these are the hall of fame of faith believers from the old testament and others were tortured not accepting deliverance when have we ever been tortured for the faith yeah we have my battles but that's not the same as physical torture that they might obtain a better resurrection in other words when they were being tormented they had the choice do i want to be resurrected with the believers or do i want to be resurrected and judge and go to hell that was their test verse 36 and other had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover a bonds and imprisonment see how many of you have gone to jail for your faith just for being a christian none of us have verse 37 they were stoned which one of you have had stones thrown at you physically to kill you they were sawn asunder they were cut with sauce till they died cut in pieces isaiah was cutting pieces till he died yes they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy amen they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise in other words they didn't receive the baptism holy ghost and they didn't receive the rapture god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect let's stand to our feet you can come let's look at this quote from other
