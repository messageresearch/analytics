[0:40] kind of like i'm the i'm
[0:42] like brother graham said that tire with
[0:44] the least tread on it
[0:45] it's kind of like the old spare tire

[0:49] i'm not an evangelist that can shout you
[0:51] and make the shout and jump and run all
[0:53] over the church that's just not my
[0:55] my type of ministry
[0:57] i uh i i do feel that the lord has
[0:59] called me to pastor a little flock there
[1:01] and sometimes you know as a as a patcher
[1:03] it's kind of like a daddy and you kind
[1:05] of kind of do a little daddy working and
[1:07] so

[1:10] daddy to your you

[2:04] to try to be anybody else just stay in
[2:06] the calling for
[2:09] this morning some great
[2:10] teaching i'm not going to try to be an
[2:12] evangelist because that's not what god

[2:16] i'm just going to pasture a little bit
[2:18] if i could amen glory i mean that might
[2:21] not be a thing for special meetings but
[2:23] uh that's just what god has placed in
[2:25] yourself hallelujah and by god grace

[5:05] i kind of wear my old bible out that's
[5:07] right
[5:08] but
[5:09] i mean i turned the pages because i like
[5:11] to hear those pages turning hey man i

[5:17] kindle but it's just not like turn
[5:18] another page
[5:20] that's right i feel that way about the
[5:21] bible amen

[5:27] but the end of all things is at hand how
[5:29] may i say amen amen be there for sober
[5:33] and watch
[5:34] unto prayer let's pray one more time
[5:36] heavenly father as we gather here this
[5:39] morning lord god i pray lord something
[5:41] will be said it would just make us amen
[5:43] just a little bit closer to you
[5:45] we ask lord god that you would help us
[5:47] each one to apply the word and let it
[5:49] have a practical outworking in our lives
[5:51] or god amended it might correct the air
[5:54] that we find in our own lives lord god
[5:56] and father help us amen that we don't
[5:58] amen make the mistakes that that this
[6:00] whole flesh would sometimes get us into
[6:03] father we pray this morning that you
[6:04] would have your way among us amen that
[6:06] your perfect word would come forth
[6:08] jesus one of our hearts lord i love you
[6:10] everybody among these who can commit
[6:12] once again this time these people in
[6:13] your hands in jesus name pray amen amen
[6:17] amen you're all right if i just take
[6:19] this off yes sir there's a hook right
[6:20] there on the side
[6:23] usually that's the first thing i do when
[6:25] i get ready
[6:26] listen i don't like to fight with the
[6:28] code
[6:29] man we're fighting the devil this
[6:30] morning that's right all right amen now
[6:32] what we find here in the story i want to
[6:34] preach a little thought this morning if
[6:36] i could on the prayer for deliverance
[6:38] from presumptuous sin prayer for
[6:41] deliverance from presumptuous sins amen
[6:44] and
[6:45] david here is crying out the psalmist
[6:47] and i believe it's david he's crying out
[6:48] here and um he's crying out that god
[6:51] would hold him back from sin
[6:53] i'm gonna cry how many have ever cried
[6:55] that crying lord god hold me back from
[6:57] sin don't let me forget about sin you
[6:59] know sometimes amen
[7:02] we find ourselves um
[7:04] kind of confident in the fact that well
[7:06] i'm a holy ghost-filled believer
[7:08] you know i got the holy spirit i mean
[7:10] i'm not going to sin i'm not going to
[7:11] say it but you know david was filled
[7:12] with the holy ghost from the very time
[7:14] that samuel anointed him amen he began
[7:16] to move under the spirit of god begin to
[7:18] move upon him and direct him and he was
[7:20] a man the bible says after god's own
[7:23] heart he was chosen right right
[7:25] of god just like a true believer of god
[7:27] is chosen elected predestinated from
[7:29] before the foundation yes to stand in
[7:31] this day yes yes with the word of god in
[7:34] an anointed with the spirit of god amen
[7:36] the holy ghost upon the same man but yet
[7:38] we find david in that position
[7:40] we find david gets himself in a terrible
[7:43] trouble that's right brother right david
[7:45] gets himself amen with bathsheba and we
[7:48] find out that he had a lot of problems
[7:50] and the problems never left his house
[7:52] because of the sin that david found
[7:54] himself in that's right to
[7:57] i would never do something like that
[7:59] that's probably exactly what david
[8:00] thought that's right but you know what i
[8:02] don't want i don't want to presume like
[8:05] david did that i'll never do that i'm
[8:07] going to presume that i'll never have a
[8:10] problem i don't want to ever get so so
[8:12] uh confident in myself that word
[8:15] presumption means to be proud or or too
[8:18] arrogant and brazen or or overconfident
[8:20] that i'll think oh i'll never do
[8:22] something like that right i got
[8:25] confidence i can do this i can do
[8:26] anything i want i can get myself in a
[8:28] position like david got himself and i'm
[8:30] strong enough not to fall like david did
[8:34] right look out
[8:36] look out church right
[8:38] but yet we see you know we see the the
[8:40] bride of christ excuse me we see this
[8:43] bride of christ get to the position that
[8:45] because we got the holy ghost because
[8:46] god has revealed his word to us because
[8:48] we know so much of the word of god we
[8:50] get to think well glory to god i'm
[8:52] invincible i'm i'm bulletproof
[8:54] i'll never make a mistake right
[8:57] it's like a man who's been an alcoholic
[8:59] they may go into a bar he mean don't do
[9:01] it
[9:03] don't do it god has delivered you from
[9:04] alcohol god has developed you from
[9:06] whatever it
[9:07] don't get around that thing don't think
[9:09] that you're strong enough because you're
[9:10] not amen right amen david thought he was
[9:13] strong enough and found himself in a
[9:14] bunch of trouble
[9:15] that's right
[9:18] but we find david here
[9:20] david found himself in trouble but then
[9:22] god sent a prophet of god with the word
[9:24] of god he said nathan to
[9:26] david and he told a little parable about
[9:28] a lamb and a man a headlamp you know the
[9:30] story
[9:32] amen and in telling that story maybe
[9:34] david got furious he couldn't believe
[9:36] that someone would do something like
[9:38] that something so terrible if it is to
[9:40] take this other man they have to kill
[9:41] and just do it without any without any
[9:43] pity or anything
[9:46] yes
[9:47] but yet david got so angry that he said
[9:49] that man deserves to die right
[9:53] and nathan just turned and he said
[9:54] you're the man
[9:56] you're that name
[9:57] you're that man david and immediately
[9:59] david's heart sank immediately david
[10:02] knew what david had david had some
[10:03] secret faults according to psalms here
[10:05] he said moreover by their judgments i i
[10:08] know my secret faults
[10:11] amen he was judged by the word of god
[10:13] the word of god always come to the
[10:14] prophet god said the word amen to nathan
[10:17] or today david through nathan the
[10:19] prophet he said the word to him and it
[10:21] was a word of judgment he found himself
[10:23] judged by the word you're the man david
[10:25] you're desire
[10:28] and very stood like well i would never
[10:30] do such a thing i mean how many say that
[10:32] i would never do such a thing in your
[10:34] heart you're saying that right but
[10:36] church you're not strong enough in
[10:38] yourself i'm not strong enough in myself
[10:40] not to give in to this old sticky carnal
[10:43] nature that the prophet god said we're
[10:44] stuck in that's right yes
[10:48] now i'm not i'm not picking on anyone
[10:50] maybe like i said i don't have an
[10:52] evangelist ministry i have a pastoral
[10:54] ministry and i don't want to see
[10:56] presumptuous sin make their way in among
[10:58] my sheep amen
[11:00] among jesse's sheep that's right
[11:03] amen
[11:04] i'm old you can tell i use paper
[11:07] i don't have one of those
[11:09] i don't have my little legs
[11:11] it would scare me my son bought me one
[11:13] said dad you won't have to do all that
[11:14] paper stuff and i said well
[11:16] what would i do if i get up here and
[11:18] touch the wrong thing i do that on my
[11:19] phone
[11:22] turn that thing up
[11:24] i don't presume i'm smart enough to use
[11:26] one of those keep me back from thinking
[11:28] i am lord that's right
[11:30] so i put it on paper hey man that's good
[11:33] that all right yes sir yes i'm old
[11:36] man amen i'm proud of it
[11:39] that's not a good thing don't be proud
[11:42] but anyhow we find david here we find
[11:44] himself in this position amen where he
[11:46] finds himself judged and he's crying out
[11:49] here in psalms he says oh the fear of
[11:50] the lord is is clean enduring forever
[11:53] the judgments of our lord are true and
[11:55] righteous all together he's thanking god
[11:58] that he found himself judged
[12:00] yes hallelujah that's right and when we
[12:02] read over in first corinthians let a man
[12:04] we take when we take communion we read
[12:06] this verse in our church and now you
[12:08] might probably do here too he said let a
[12:10] man examine himself and so let him eat
[12:12] of that bread and drink of that couple
[12:14] we're taking the communion yes see if
[12:16] david would examine his own heart he
[12:17] would have realized that where he was
[12:19] going wasn't right and then but he
[12:20] didn't
[12:21] yes he just presumed well i'm the king i
[12:23] would never do anything wrong and he was
[12:25] walking he would he was looking at
[12:27] something you should have been looking
[12:28] at that's right yes is that right yes
[12:31] sir
[12:32] church event there's a there's a host of
[12:34] things in this world today that you can
[12:36] look at did you want not to be looking
[12:38] at him hallelujah you know you think
[12:40] well i'm i'm strong enough to look at
[12:41] that thing that doesn't affect me that's
[12:43] a lie yeah right right the devil it will
[12:46] affect you hey man amen look at those
[12:48] things get those things off your
[12:49] computer get those things off your
[12:51] telephone whatever what it is don't be
[12:53] looking at those things presuming that
[12:55] you're strong enough to overcome them
[12:56] because you're not all right
[12:58] the only way that you can overcome that
[13:00] is the power of the holy ghost in you
[13:02] that'll overcome and throw this old
[13:03] sticky carnal nature subject to it amen
[13:07] to that hallelujah am i the only one
[13:09] that ever struggles anything with this
[13:10] old nature
[13:15] david just said i had some secret fault
[13:17] but when you judge me i found myself
[13:19] judged i thank god for your judgment
[13:21] amen yeah that's exactly what paul was
[13:23] saying the corinthians he says for he
[13:25] that he is to drink unworthy and drink
[13:27] of damnation unto himself not discerning
[13:29] the lord's body for this cause many are
[13:31] weak and sickly among you listen to what
[13:33] he said next four if we would judge
[13:34] ourselves
[13:36] we would not have to be judged he
[13:37] wouldn't have to send the word of god
[13:39] and condemn me like he did david amen
[13:41] that's right
[13:42] but he said but when we are judged
[13:45] we are chastened of the lord that we
[13:46] should not be condemned with the world
[13:48] if you're a son of god god is going to
[13:50] judge you he's going to bring you under
[13:51] the judgment of the word of god if
[13:53] you're a predestinated son of god david
[13:55] couldn't fall he was predestinated amen
[13:58] amen
[13:59] but he still fell amen if he'd judged
[14:01] himself he wouldn't but god set the
[14:03] judgment because he loved him so he
[14:04] wouldn't be condemned with the world
[14:06] amen
[14:09] we would judge ourselves but when we are
[14:11] judged we're chastened to the lord
[14:13] that's why david said all those
[14:15] judgments are more to be desired than
[14:17] fine gold that's right they're sweeter
[14:19] than hunting from the cold because it
[14:20] kept me amen for being judged they may
[14:22] have found them unworthy
[14:24] because god judged me by his word he
[14:26] sent the prophet the word of god amen
[14:28] and he told me you're the man david yes
[14:31] you're the one
[14:34] and david finds it that we find david
[14:35] himself here cried out oh lord god
[14:38] amen hold me back
[14:40] from the presumption of the sins yes
[14:43] david realized then that he couldn't
[14:45] hold himself back
[14:46] david realized then that i thought that
[14:49] i had the power not to not to enter into
[14:51] these things but when i felt like he
[14:52] started to cry out lord should be the
[14:54] cry of each and every one of us this
[14:55] morning lord god hold me back yeah yeah
[14:58] i got secret faults i got this
[15:01] hold me back don't let me get into those
[15:03] things amen amen you may want to be held
[15:06] back this morning yes jesus how they're
[15:08] doing the way it delivers that we access
[15:10] that way the power of god through prayer
[15:12] amen just like david cried out and
[15:14] prayed unto god hallelujah
[15:17] he said well brother jeff they said i
[15:18] got the holy ghost
[15:21] i've been baptized i've been baptized in
[15:23] the water i've been baptized i've
[15:25] trusted in the blood of jesus christ
[15:27] amen don't get overconfident that's
[15:29] right
[15:30] so is david filled with the holy ghost
[15:32] amen don't get overconfident
[15:35] over the first corinthians we find paul
[15:37] saying this he said moreover brother i
[15:39] would not have you should be ignorant
[15:41] how that our fathers were under the
[15:42] cloud and all passed through the sea
[15:45] he says and our and we're all baptized
[15:48] unto moses in the cloud and in the sea
[15:50] you know what brother ram said that red
[15:51] sea was the type of blood they were all
[15:53] baptized amen they all were trusted in
[15:55] the blood and they all passed through
[15:57] the seed yes
[15:59] they all ate the same spiritual meat
[16:01] they all drank the same spiritual drinks
[16:03] but they drank that spiritual rock that
[16:05] followed them that rock was pride
[16:07] they were all feeding on the word of god
[16:09] they were all baptized they made they'd
[16:11] all trusted in the blood they'd all come
[16:13] through the red sea amen that's right
[16:16] that's right
[16:17] these are sons and daughters of god have
[16:18] been predestinated to inherit the
[16:20] promised planning that's right yes yes
[16:22] sir
[16:24] but paul said but with many of them god
[16:26] was not well pleased
[16:28] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[16:30] yes
[16:32] don't get to this place that you think
[16:33] you can't be overthrown yes don't get to
[16:36] the place well i'm i'm i'm safe i don't
[16:38] have i would never do those things
[16:41] and paul ryan is in the next words paul
[16:43] says in first corinthians 10 60 says
[16:46] now these things were
[16:47] are examples to the intent that we
[16:49] should not lust after evil
[16:51] yes they fail and god give us an example
[16:54] of it so that we wouldn't find ourselves
[16:56] lusting after evil things and falling in
[16:58] the same way they did yes amen wherefore
[17:01] let him thicket instead take heed lest
[17:03] he fall
[17:05] all right yes amen
[17:07] don't get so comfy you think well bless
[17:09] god amen you know how many have ever
[17:10] come off a good high been filled with
[17:12] the holy ghost and just enjoy it and
[17:14] just shout in the glory and hallelujah
[17:16] oh i feel so
[17:16] [Music]
[17:18] i mean i feel so brother brown said he
[17:20] said oh don't you just feel all cleaned
[17:22] out and scrubbed out in it how many
[17:23] likes to feel that amen
[17:27] don't get so confident in that that you
[17:28] don't think that devil can say oh well i
[17:30] can't bother him no more he will be
[17:32] right there the next day that's right
[17:34] right there the next day right amen
[17:37] you're gonna dangle that bait in front
[17:38] of you again
[17:40] yes
[17:41] and you know what you're not strong
[17:42] enough
[17:44] not to take the bait that's right
[17:46] brother that's why we need the holy
[17:48] ghost
[17:50] absolutely positively essential that we
[17:52] have that holy spirit amen amen
[17:54] he said these things were our examples
[17:56] that we wouldn't lost everything
[17:58] so therefore let him take heed lest he
[18:00] fall in when you think you can stand
[18:02] take heed unless you fall amen amen
[18:04] hallelujah
[18:06] and then the next words very familiar
[18:08] scriptures
[18:09] first corinthians 10 36 4 there have no
[18:11] temptation taking you but such is as
[18:13] common to man
[18:16] every temptation that you face it's
[18:18] common every man every woman every boy
[18:20] every girl they all face
[18:22] yes how many know jesus was tempted in
[18:23] all manner just like we were amen every
[18:26] man just like we were but yet he had the
[18:28] holy ghost to anchor inside that could
[18:29] keep him that's right
[18:32] no temptation he was such as common to
[18:34] man but god is faithful or aren't you
[18:36] glad for a faithful god
[18:38] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[18:40] about that which you're able but with
[18:42] the temptation make a way of escape that
[18:45] you may be able to bear it
[18:48] yes that way of escape has been made
[18:51] david found that way of escape when he
[18:53] was tempted when he failed amen he cried
[18:55] out unto god church he but there is a
[18:58] prayer of faith that will believe for
[19:00] the believer that we can call unto the
[19:01] god and know that he'll deliver us this
[19:03] morning amen amen hold me back lord god
[19:07] yes
[19:08] jesus
[19:09] be sober
[19:10] and watch under prayer the end of all
[19:12] things is at hand
[19:14] and then there was david
[19:16] a man after god there was david full of
[19:19] the holy ghost for the time of solomon
[19:21] and david found himself amen giving in
[19:23] he thought he got too cocked sure of
[19:25] himself oh bless god i'll never fall
[19:28] right but look what happened
[19:30] yeah yes these were given for our
[19:32] examples that we wouldn't lust
[19:35] and do this
[19:36] and have these same desires i mean
[19:38] because this old flesh amen it longs for
[19:40] the things of this world that's right it
[19:42] does yeah and the only way to have
[19:44] victory over this old flesh is to have
[19:45] something on the inside
[19:49] hallelujah okay that's why you know the
[19:51] word of god says be filled with the
[19:53] spirit amen yeah he doesn't say it it
[19:55] doesn't mean just one time right lord
[19:58] god fill me every day
[20:00] amen
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:16] david was a man after god's own heart
[20:17] the bible
[20:18] says anointed to be king amen
[20:24] in acts 13 we can find this written he
[20:26] said he raised up david to be their king
[20:29] to whom he gave this testimony and said
[20:32] i have found david the son of jesse a
[20:35] man of after my own heart that will
[20:37] fulfill my will
[20:39] amen
[20:41] that man that god bragged on that god
[20:43] said i found in him a man that will
[20:46] fulfill that will do my word amen
[20:49] that man fell
[20:52] yes
[20:52] the church amen you might be a man of
[20:54] god you might be a woman of god here
[20:56] this morning you might be filled with
[20:58] the holy ghost and god has predestinated
[21:00] you according to
[21:06] but don't think i mean that you can
[21:08] get so sure of yourself that you don't
[21:10] need to pray lord god hold me back
[21:14] hold me back every day i need to be held
[21:17] back every day man
[21:20] i don't even want to think that i'm big
[21:22] enough to hold myself back but there is
[21:23] one who is this morning all right
[21:26] thank you jesus my old church knows i
[21:28] love charles spurgeon
[21:30] and i i study some of spurgeon's
[21:33] writings and and you know what's amazing
[21:34] from the brand i've even heard brother
[21:36] brandon mentioned charles spurgeon
[21:37] anymore
[21:38] wow i mean and when i study spurgeon's
[21:41] writing it's amazing to me how many
[21:42] times spurgeon comes back and says the
[21:44] same thing brother brandon did or maybe
[21:46] brother branham
[21:48] says something he said right now i know
[21:50] a lot of people will condemn you who
[21:52] want to study somebody's telling the
[21:53] message amen
[21:55] the church i i find sometimes i hear a
[21:58] minister say something's not a message
[21:59] princess well that was really good
[22:01] that's right that's right brother that's
[22:02] really good
[22:04] you know i i can see the minute they go
[22:06] off this way yeah well that's fine amen
[22:08] but i'll just throw the pit out and i'll
[22:09] make this part right
[22:16] and he was talking about this this
[22:18] portion of scripture in the 19th psalm
[22:20] where david is crying out keep me back
[22:22] keep me back from presumptuous sins he
[22:24] says he said this was a prayer i'm not
[22:27] i'm just going to read what he said he
[22:28] said this is a prayer
[22:30] a prayer of a man after god's own heart
[22:33] amen if holy david needed to pray like
[22:35] this sanctified david needed to pray how
[22:38] much more do we need to pray like this
[22:41] yes yes he says oh yeah he said he said
[22:44] keep me back he said he was saying or
[22:46] prying this out when you read the song
[22:48] he was crying it out he said so much to
[22:50] say he says hold me back he says or i
[22:53] shall rush headlong and i said
[22:56] over the precipice of sin
[22:58] that's right hold me back lord because
[23:00] if you don't i know i know this oh man
[23:03] he'll run headlong inside and be
[23:05] destroyed amen
[23:08] how much more do we need to pray that
[23:10] way yes
[23:12] hallelujah
[23:14] he said our evil nature is like an
[23:16] ill-tempered horse and it's apt to run
[23:20] away
[23:21] how many have ever rode a horse
[23:25] when i was a boy we had a horse we
[23:27] wanted a horse so bad we had that oh
[23:29] daddy can we have a horse no no horse
[23:32] they eat a lot of hay and all that
[23:34] we had farm we had cows we had pigs and
[23:36] all this but we figured we ought to have
[23:38] a horse
[23:40] so us children saved our allowances and
[23:42] we saved our money and we bought a horse
[23:44] 14 horse
[23:47] back when i was
[23:48] that day that was a lot of money
[23:50] right
[23:52] but we bought this horse and we brought
[23:54] it home
[23:55] his name was jerry
[23:57] sounds like a pretty innocent name
[23:58] doesn't it
[24:00] but we were looking at the paperwork on
[24:01] this horse
[24:03] the next day dad said this had been
[24:05] white it out so he scratched the white
[24:07] out or whatever it was it was on the
[24:08] name part of the paperwork there
[24:11] and underneath it said fury
[24:13] he didn't say jerry it said fury
[24:16] it wasn't a gentle kid pony
[24:18] this was a this was a fury
[24:21] wow he had a
[24:24] he had an ill temper i guess
[24:26] just like our old physical nature that's
[24:29] right brother good
[24:30] he said it's apt to run away and the
[24:33] first day we got on that horse that's
[24:34] exactly what it did oh i gotta hold the
[24:37] range i can i can control this
[24:40] now kill tempered horses you just watch
[24:42] he took me for a ride and he finally
[24:44] unloaded me my older brother said well
[24:46] yeah well get me on him i'll show you
[24:48] and he got on the horse and
[24:50] he said he showed him and he got loaded
[24:53] just a little bit about the same place i
[24:55] did
[24:57] but my dad was standing there oh thank
[24:59] god for my he was a big man
[25:01] he said oh i'll teach that horse a thing
[25:04] or two
[25:05] he got on that horse and that horse took
[25:07] him across the field just as tight as he
[25:09] took me and my brothers
[25:11] and all the way across my dad is
[25:13] speaking that horse it wasn't nice
[25:14] things he was saying to him
[25:17] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa and he finally
[25:19] in order to get the horse
[25:21] stopped he grabbed the whole horse's bed
[25:23] he pulled the horse's head clear around
[25:24] here and he flipped the horse over on
[25:26] its side to get the horse horse's stuff
[25:30] i said dad what we're going to do we
[25:31] spent all our money on this horse and
[25:33] that said i have
[25:34] i have a solution for that ill-tempered
[25:37] horse
[25:38] how many have ever seen a bit on a horse
[25:42] oh boy
[25:43] i'm hoping everybody raised their hand
[25:46] but you know when you when you put a bit
[25:47] in the horse's mouth there's two levers
[25:49] that come down on the bed and and that
[25:51] hits in the horse's mouth and when these
[25:52] levers are pulled by the reins this bit
[25:55] has a little what they call a port it's
[25:57] a little sometimes it's a roller and if
[25:59] it's a real nice horse it's not
[26:00] ill-tempered voice like our nature is it
[26:03] doesn't have to be too big of a hump in
[26:05] that bit
[26:06] but the horse that we were riding just
[26:08] had a little bit of rise in the bit
[26:09] because it's called for a soft mouth
[26:11] horse
[26:12] we aren't soft mouth nature that's right
[26:15] all right we have an ill-tempered nature
[26:17] right
[26:18] right we'll run away with this if we
[26:20] don't if we don't have some help
[26:22] but my dad went out the next day or the
[26:25] next week or whatever it was and he
[26:26] bought what they call a high port bit
[26:29] and that bit doesn't just have a little
[26:30] rise that bit has a big rise like this
[26:32] and so when you put it out horse's mouth
[26:34] and you pull those levers that high port
[26:36] vent comes up on the top of that horses
[26:37] now that mouth is real tender on a horse
[26:40] and when that bit rolls up there it gets
[26:42] their attention real quick
[26:45] and then we did dad put that bit on that
[26:47] horse he said try them now and then i
[26:49] said whoa and pulled them raised back
[26:50] that bit come up amen and it was so high
[26:53] that it reached up there and could touch
[26:54] the places that needed touched amen i'm
[26:56] so glad we had a higher power that we
[26:58] could go to
[27:00] a higher power that could control this
[27:02] whole nation a higher power if it'll
[27:04] bring it under control amen amen
[27:07] that's what we need father because you
[27:09] know what my father gave me the power to
[27:11] control that horse our father has given
[27:13] us the power because holy spirit the
[27:15] higher power
[27:16] if we'll just access it through the
[27:18] worst form of sin which was done with
[27:21] deliberation and willfulness
[27:24] when david cried out and hold me back
[27:26] from those presumptuous sin he willfully
[27:28] went and did what he did
[27:30] knowing that it wasn't right that's
[27:32] right
[27:33] but his old carnal nature was like that
[27:35] ill-tempered word i'm going to satisfy
[27:38] my old nature
[27:40] right it's a strong thing right that's
[27:43] why we need a higher power that's why
[27:51] he said david did this in willful
[27:53] deliberate sin amen
[27:55] and he said even the holiest of people
[27:58] even the most holy ghost-filled people
[28:00] need to be kept back from the violence
[28:02] of transgressions that's right
[28:05] now i'm not here brother jesse i'm not
[28:06] here i pray to god that you've got you
[28:09] don't have these kind of problems
[28:12] but you know what i can see in my own
[28:13] life in my life
[28:15] i see it in my church amen where we
[28:17] stumble and fall we make mistakes and
[28:19] then we'll feed only access to higher
[28:21] power
[28:24] read your bible and pray every day pray
[28:27] without ceasing it's the will of god
[28:28] concerning you amen amen amen
[28:30] amen
[28:32] nobody believes that amen even the
[28:34] holiest need to be kept back from
[28:35] transgressions
[28:37] yes
[28:38] it's a solemn thing that we read
[28:41] the apostle paul warning he's not
[28:44] warning sinners but over in colossians
[28:47] the third chapter of the book of
[28:48] colossians he's born in saints
[28:51] i'll read this to you yes over in
[28:53] colossians chapter 3 verse 1 we read
[28:56] these words if ye then be risen with
[28:58] christ seek the things which are above
[29:00] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[29:02] of god
[29:03] set your affections on things above and
[29:05] not on things of the earth for you are
[29:07] dead and your life is hid with christ in
[29:10] god when christ who is our life shall
[29:12] appear then shall we also appear with
[29:14] him and glory who's david taught or who
[29:16] is paul talking to he's talking to
[29:18] saints
[29:19] yes he's talking to saints of god he's
[29:21] talking to born again raised with christ
[29:24] amen
[29:25] your life the old man dead you're hidden
[29:27] with christ amen
[29:28] yes
[29:30] but what's the very next thing that
[29:32] the apostle paul warns these people
[29:36] mortify therefore your members yes which
[29:39] are upon the earth
[29:40] fornication
[29:42] uncleanness
[29:43] inordinate affection
[29:45] evil computations amen covetousness
[29:48] which is idolatry for which things
[29:50] say the wrath of god cometh upon the
[29:53] children of distal people yes yes amen
[29:56] born again christians saved people i
[29:58] mean these aren't sinners out there he's
[30:00] warning them to mortify to put to death
[30:03] these things in your life you've got to
[30:04] get them under subjection of the holy
[30:06] ghost
[30:08] amen hallelujah amen
[30:10] yes they'll cause the wrath of god to
[30:13] come upon the children to disobey god's
[30:15] word willfully amen
[30:17] just to satisfy this old flesh
[30:21] oh brother jim i'd never do that hey man
[30:23] that's what they thought too
[30:25] but paul do different
[30:27] yeah right and paul warned against these
[30:30] things the most loathsome of sins
[30:33] mortified therefore your members which
[30:35] are upon the earth fornication i'm
[30:37] thinking get those things put to death
[30:39] that's right yes
[30:41] i like what spurgeon says what do saints
[30:44] need this kind of warning
[30:47] against these kinds of sins yes
[30:51] yes
[30:52] david thought they did yes church i know
[30:54] they do why because i have stumbled i've
[30:57] failed i've done things that i wish i
[30:58] hadn't done amen yeah i might have just
[31:01] judged myself by the word of god i would
[31:03] say wait a second don't go there don't
[31:06] look at that don't let those
[31:08] tempt you amen don't satisfy you know
[31:10] and it's not just these little sins that
[31:11] we we look or the sins that we talk
[31:13] about but there's these little things
[31:15] that
[31:15] oh some people feel good if they know
[31:17] the latest thing that's going on they
[31:19] can't wait to tell you about it brother
[31:20] justin that's right right brother you
[31:22] know what we call it we call that gossip
[31:24] yes but you know what it satisfies this
[31:26] old flesh or they wouldn't do it that's
[31:28] right let me tell you about what i found
[31:31] out about it
[31:33] and not only lydia but her sister too
[31:36] maybe
[31:37] you're gonna wonder
[31:40] right right with that you know what
[31:42] you're making somebody feel good that
[31:43] you think you know something you know
[31:45] what i mean that's a loathsome thing and
[31:47] god god hates that amen yeah amen it
[31:50] shows discord among the brethren amen
[31:53] yes
[31:54] i don't know anything about lydia
[31:58] but i think she's a fine young lady
[32:00] done a great job with his children and i
[32:02] thank god for him
[32:04] he's always a blessing
[32:05] amen
[32:07] he said but we find out amen there's
[32:10] these things that we need to be held
[32:11] back from
[32:12] amen and not just those not just these
[32:15] loathsome purple sins amen that
[32:18] christians find themselves in you know
[32:20] what we find when god says don't do this
[32:22] or don't do that we have the word of god
[32:23] on things that the prophet god has told
[32:25] us amen that will make us amen sons and
[32:27] daughters of god or give us victory in
[32:28] our walk with god and we find ourselves
[32:30] compromising on those things
[32:33] just because this whole flesh wants to
[32:35] be saved
[32:37] that's right brother right
[32:39] it makes me feel good if if a boy looks
[32:42] at me when i have
[32:44] you shouldn't
[32:46] those things those things will creep in
[32:49] that's right brother i don't want to get
[32:51] off into that i'd like to maybe speak on
[32:52] that tonight amen
[32:55] do sage keep warning against these
[32:57] things yes they do
[32:59] the most holy ghost-filled people amen i
[33:02] like how he puts this he said the widest
[33:04] robes unless their purity is preserved
[33:07] by divine grace will be defiled by the
[33:09] blackest spots of sin that's right
[33:14] the most i don't care how holy you are
[33:16] man the moment you take your eyes off of
[33:17] god and start putting your trust like
[33:19] david did its own self and then you're
[33:20] going to fall that's right right brother
[33:27] he said experienced christians don't
[33:29] boast of your experience
[33:32] yes hallelujah the moment you look away
[33:34] from god and then the one who's able to
[33:36] keep them from falling you'll surely
[33:38] fall
[33:41] the most those who had the most fervent
[33:44] love
[33:45] whose faith is constant whose hope is
[33:47] bright don't ever say
[33:49] i'll never sing
[33:52] we have a saying in our house it was a
[33:54] little cartoon that kids used to watch
[33:55] him in
[33:56] don't ever say never don't ever say no
[34:00] because the moment you do amen the
[34:02] devil's going to put you to the test
[34:04] that's right never say never amen
[34:07] don't ever say we never shall sin but
[34:09] rather we need to cry out like david oh
[34:12] lord god hold me back amen deliver me
[34:15] from temptation
[34:16] hold me back lord i can't hold
[34:20] amen amen
[34:23] you say old brother jim i would never do
[34:25] that
[34:29] i would never get myself in a situation
[34:32] like david did
[34:34] i like what spurgeon says here he said
[34:36] there is enough tinder in the heart of
[34:39] the best man to light a fire that will
[34:41] burn to the lowest hell unless god shall
[34:43] quench the sparks as they
[34:46] fall many knows what tinder is
[34:51] i asked that question home what what's
[34:53] tinder you might know what tinder is a
[34:54] lot of kids
[34:57] i said well when we were kids we used to
[34:59] always camp out and have a campfire all
[35:01] summer long we camped out
[35:04] and we always had a campfire so in order
[35:06] to start the campfire in order to start
[35:08] a fire
[35:10] i mean you had to find something
[35:12] that was we called it tinder i mean or
[35:14] something that would light and burn real
[35:16] quick or real easy
[35:19] and if you weren't near the barn where
[35:20] there was some straw or something hey
[35:21] that worked great grill dry and put that
[35:23] in the firewood
[35:25] doesn't burn long but boy it burns hot
[35:27] and bursts fast
[35:28] right
[35:29] you know what it does it catches other
[35:31] things on fire
[35:32] it catches the bigger things on fire
[35:35] yes
[35:36] and i said tinder amen and i gave a test
[35:39] to my grandson
[35:40] the very next week we had a campfire
[35:43] and i said the best tinder we could find
[35:44] is kids with golden rods old dried out
[35:47] golden rod tell me what a gold medal is
[35:49] we get these old goldenrod weeds they
[35:51] grow up and they get dry and so we bust
[35:53] them up in a little bit chunks like that
[35:55] throw them in a fire minute you put a
[35:56] little paper match to it they were on
[35:58] fire
[36:01] he said that is something that will
[36:03] start a fire real quick
[36:05] yes he says there's enough tinder in the
[36:07] heart of any man no matter how old he is
[36:10] to start a fire that will burn to the
[36:12] lowest of death that's right don't think
[36:14] oh i can do this i can play i can mess
[36:16] around with this fire and not get burned
[36:18] i mean it will start a fire you can't
[36:20] put out
[36:22] don't look at what you shouldn't look at
[36:24] don't go where you shouldn't go amen
[36:26] right yeah they don't associate where
[36:27] you shouldn't associate it
[36:29] it'll cause a fire that you can't put
[36:31] out i mean i don't care how holy you
[36:33] think you are david was the whole man
[36:35] after god's own heart and then the fire
[36:37] burned out of control before he could
[36:38] stop it amen amen
[36:42] it's like trying to start a campfire in
[36:43] a barn i mean don't think you can do it
[36:47] when we were kids we thought well it's
[36:48] raining out we're camping out let's
[36:50] let's go in the barn and have our
[36:51] campfire in there and dad said i'll
[36:53] murder you
[36:55] start a fire in the barn you can't keep
[36:56] the fire from spreading to the whole
[36:57] barn and that's exactly what it does
[36:59] when you start messing with these things
[37:01] these little lusts of the flesh of it
[37:02] it'll burn a fire that you can't put out
[37:04] yes sir yes sir hallelujah and you're
[37:07] not strong enough to put it out that's
[37:08] why david had to call upon the one who
[37:10] was debating he accessed it the power to
[37:13] be delivered from presumptuous sin
[37:15] through prayer prayed out oh god deliver
[37:17] me amen
[37:24] keep me back from these presumptuous
[37:26] seeds
[37:29] another scripture i don't know where it
[37:30] went
[37:33] but david said you know
[37:35] when he was in that position when he
[37:37] didn't have those secret faults in it
[37:39] the bible says he just he just hated
[37:41] himself the whole time he was but god
[37:42] judgment coming brought him out of that
[37:44] he prayed to god and god delivered him
[37:46] amen amen i'm not saying if you have if
[37:48] you've allowed those sins to or
[37:50] something to come into your life or an
[37:52] old habit or whatever it might be if
[37:54] there's not hope for you amen there is
[37:56] amen yes amen but it's through prayer
[37:58] access and the one god is able to
[38:00] deliver
[38:02] hallelujah he said there's enough tinder
[38:05] he said unless god would put it out
[38:07] who would have dreamed that lot would be
[38:08] found drunken committing uncleanness
[38:10] that's right that's right
[38:13] brother i'm saying righteous love
[38:14] his righteous soul was vexed by the
[38:16] things he saw going on downstairs all
[38:18] that time that's right we find that man
[38:20] amy
[38:22] caught with presumptuous
[38:24] yes sir
[38:26] so don't think that oh i'm stronger
[38:28] stronger that's
[38:30] right
[38:32] good you find a man by the name of hazel
[38:35] he's crying out to god one day
[38:38] he said am i a dog and i would do such a
[38:41] horrible thing that the prophet told you
[38:43] everybody's going to do i would never
[38:45] see it amen
[38:46] azio was a man who elijah had anointed
[38:49] to be king over syria if you read in the
[38:51] bible says in first kings 19. hazel was
[38:53] anointed to be king over israel the
[38:55] prophet of god had come and anointed him
[38:56] yes
[39:08] yes sir
[39:09] but yeah we find hazel
[39:12] getting the same way david did getting
[39:14] kind of sure of himself oh i would never
[39:16] do these things
[39:17] you find the story over the second
[39:19] king's eighth chapter
[39:21] i'm gonna pick it up the seventh verse
[39:22] he said and elijah came to damascus and
[39:24] benedict
[39:25] i might not have these i might not
[39:27] pronounce these names right
[39:29] i can only tell when i say one wrong
[39:31] sometimes somebody that knows how to
[39:32] pronounce it
[39:37] then haddad the king of syria was sick
[39:40] he was told him saying that the man of
[39:41] god has come hither
[39:43] and the king said to hazel and then
[39:45] here's the guy
[39:46] take a present in that hand and go meet
[39:48] the man of god and inquire of the lord
[39:50] by him saying shall i recover of this
[39:52] disease
[39:53] so hazel went to meet him he took the
[39:55] president his hand even a good thing of
[39:58] damascus 40 camels burned with all these
[40:00] goods to perform the sun and said my son
[40:03] benedict king of syria has sent me to
[40:06] thee saying shall i recover of this
[40:08] disease and elijah said unto him go say
[40:10] unto him thou may have certainly
[40:12] recovered however the lord has shown me
[40:14] that you will die
[40:16] yeah you're going to recover you can
[40:18] recover this this disease this sickness
[40:20] sure you're good but he says you're
[40:21] going to die
[40:22] on
[40:24] what does that mean
[40:26] now listen
[40:27] and hazel said
[40:30] and and and it settled his countenance
[40:32] steadfastly until he was ashamed
[40:34] and the man of god wept and hazel said
[40:36] why are you weep lord
[40:38] what are you what are you crying about
[40:41] and he answered he said because i know
[40:42] the evil that thou will do unto the
[40:44] children of israel
[40:46] their strongholds will thou set on fire
[40:48] their young men will thou slay with the
[40:51] that will dash their children rip up
[40:53] their woman and child with child and
[40:55] hazel said but what
[40:57] is thy servant a dog
[41:00] i would never do such a thing
[41:02] i would not have never felt i would
[41:04] never do such a thing all right see i
[41:07] would i served a dog that should do such
[41:09] a great thing elijah said the lord has
[41:11] shown me that thou shalt be king over
[41:13] syria
[41:14] so he departed from elijah and came to
[41:16] his master and said unto him
[41:18] what said elijah to thee and he said he
[41:20] told me that you're surely going to
[41:22] recover
[41:23] and he came to pass on the world that he
[41:25] took a thick cloth dipped it in water
[41:27] spread it on his face so that he died
[41:29] and hazel reigned
[41:31] instead
[41:33] i would never am i a dog that i would do
[41:35] such a thing that you said i would do
[41:37] and he did exactly what the prophet said
[41:39] he would do
[41:42] you know what hazel should have been
[41:43] crying when the moment the prophet and
[41:45] god judged him like david found himself
[41:47] until he said oh hold me back lord don't
[41:50] let me do such a vowel all right amen i
[41:52] can't do it myself oh my dog i would
[41:55] never sin and no you will hey man you'll
[41:57] fall the moment you take your eyes off
[41:59] the one is able to keep
[42:03] amen
[42:06] brother jim i got the holy ghost i would
[42:08] never do it hazel said the same thing
[42:11] but you know what we know different and
[42:12] every one of us has been filled with
[42:14] god's spirit we've been walking in this
[42:15] world very long knows every one of us
[42:17] knows that we have this old sticky
[42:19] carnal nature that we must deal with
[42:21] every day and you're not strong enough
[42:22] to deal with
[42:23] amen
[42:27] paul said it like this over in romans
[42:28] the seventh chapter how many ways paul
[42:30] had the holy ghost amen how many believe
[42:32] paul was used mightily of god amen
[42:35] you know what paul struggled with his
[42:36] old flesh just like you and i
[42:38] yeah
[42:39] he still had the same problem just like
[42:41] you and i do
[42:43] he said in romans the seventh chapter
[42:45] the 14th verse for we know that the law
[42:47] is spiritual but i am carnal soul under
[42:49] sin
[42:51] for that which i do i allow not
[42:54] and for that which i would
[42:56] that do i not but that which i hate that
[42:59] i do
[43:00] what you do he's having a struggle with
[43:02] his old flesh man
[43:04] i would say a man
[43:05] nobody ever had that struggle
[43:07] yes
[43:08] then if i do that which i would not i
[43:10] consent under the law that is good
[43:12] now there is no more me to do it but
[43:14] it's sin that dwelleth in me wait a
[43:16] second this is a man filled with the
[43:17] holy ghost from the day that and i have
[43:19] laid hands on him amen right
[43:23] for we know that in me that is in my
[43:25] flesh
[43:26] there dwelleth no good thing
[43:29] for me to will is present with me but
[43:32] how to perform that which is good i
[43:34] don't find how i can't do another word i
[43:37] can't do what's right in myself right i
[43:40] can't do it on my own fleshly health and
[43:43] i can't control this old man amen that's
[43:46] right
[43:47] for the good that i would i do not
[43:49] and even which i would not that i do
[43:52] now if i do that which i would not throw
[43:54] more me than do with it but it's sin
[43:55] that dwelleth in me i find that law that
[43:58] it that when i would do good evil was
[44:00] present with me before i delight in the
[44:01] law of the lord after the inner man amen
[44:03] how many knows were two men here
[44:05] he said i
[44:06] delighted
[44:08] delight in the word of god i'm a man of
[44:10] god amen yes
[44:12] but yet i find this old flesh man you've
[44:14] been bringing me down
[44:20] but i see another law in my memory
[44:22] that's in this old flesh
[44:29] that's why the word of god says this
[44:31] mortify
[44:32] the deeds
[44:34] yes wonderful mortified
[44:38] those members which are upon the earth
[44:41] this whole fleshly man
[44:43] i see another law in my members mortify
[44:47] that law in your member put that thing
[44:49] to death amen you can't do it it's
[44:51] stronger than you are you need to cry
[44:53] out to prayer you need to access the
[44:55] holy ghost who's more than able to do it
[44:58] hallelujah
[45:04] let's see another law and i remember war
[45:06] gets the law in my mind bringing me into
[45:08] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[45:10] my mind
[45:12] now listen oh wretched man that i am
[45:16] yes yes no not old king david that i am
[45:20] or oh hazy owl the great prophet that i
[45:23] ever know oh wretched man that i am he
[45:25] had your right attitude
[45:29] i'm a wretched man and myself i have no
[45:31] good in myself i need to accept the one
[45:33] who's able to keep my eyes
[45:36] who shall deliver me from this body of
[45:38] death i thank god through jesus christ
[45:41] the way the holy spirit is and we have
[45:44] access to that way by prairie man we
[45:47] have a prayer that will deliver us from
[45:49] presumptuous sins
[45:51] hallelujah nobody believes that this
[45:53] morning yes amen how many got the holy
[45:55] ghost this morning don't be afraid to
[45:57] say you're redeemed let the redeemed of
[45:58] the lord say so if you've got the holy
[46:00] ghost don't get so confident in that
[46:02] fact that god has blessed you with that
[46:04] but you think that you can hold yourself
[46:06] back it takes that holy ghost to do it
[46:08] hallelujah
[46:09] hallelujah
[46:11] oh wretched man that i am david cried
[46:13] out paul the prophet of god said let me
[46:15] just kind of polish up with what david
[46:17] or what paul was trying to say here this
[46:19] is a message from question and answer
[46:21] 1964. is it okay to read questions yes
[46:25] brother brown said this let me just kind
[46:27] of polish this up here so it said what
[46:29] david tried to say he said in me is two
[46:31] persons now this one person wants to do
[46:34] wrong the other wants to do right and
[46:35] every time i start to write that wrong
[46:37] guy hinders me
[46:40] he says how many how many how many
[46:42] people have ever had that same problem
[46:44] he said how many people in the
[46:45] interviews this morning run into that
[46:46] same thing yes yeah i said well both my
[46:50] hands were went there
[46:52] how many have ever had that problem yeah
[46:54] i'm busy man all right
[46:56] he says you're an outward man which is
[46:58] controlled by six senses you're an
[47:00] inward man controlled by one sense and
[47:01] that sense is faith
[47:05] he said now as long as the sixth senses
[47:07] agree with faith or the revelation of
[47:09] the word he said that's wonderful
[47:12] he said but when these six sentences
[47:13] disagree with faith then leave the sixth
[47:16] senses alone
[47:18] when these extensive disagree with the
[47:21] revelation that the spirit of god has
[47:23] given you with the word it may then
[47:25] leave these six senses that are
[47:27] governing this old flesh leave them
[47:28] alone amen mortify those things put them
[47:31] to death amen they'll cause your problem
[47:34] hallelujah now that's the same thing
[47:36] with paul speaking here it was sold
[47:37] under the law
[47:39] to carnal sin but every one of us is the
[47:41] same way he said
[47:43] that's the reason we have the troubles
[47:45] that we do
[47:47] he says of our marriage four or five
[47:49] times this in that this that the other
[47:51] thing all kinds of sin and adulteries
[47:54] and everything else going along in our
[47:56] lives because of those things excuse me
[47:58] we are carnal on that part must
[48:01] according to the word of god be
[48:02] mortified that part must be put to death
[48:05] that's right hallelujah
[48:08] and you can't put it to death you're not
[48:10] drawing them that's right you need a
[48:12] higher power okay amen yes first of all
[48:15] we need to pray to teach the everything
[48:17] lord hold me back
[48:23] amen
[48:26] it must be
[48:27] it must perish but then the inside
[48:29] there's a spirit man a soul inside which
[48:31] has faith in god's word it'll bring our
[48:33] outside body under subjection to the
[48:35] word by faith or revelation by accepting
[48:38] what god's word said other than what the
[48:40] flesh wants amen yes nobody wants to do
[48:43] that hallelujah
[48:46] but then brother brown goes into a
[48:47] little thing and i really like it i and
[48:49] i kind of i didn't hear all of simon's
[48:50] message last night because i was kind of
[48:52] i was trying to study for this
[48:54] god changed my mind i had knew exactly
[48:56] where i was going a week or two ago
[48:58] exactly where i wanted to go or kind of
[48:59] where i wanted to go and i studied it
[49:01] all out and then yesterday or friday
[49:04] knew where i wanted to go and then
[49:05] saturday god changed my mind
[49:09] so i was still studying last night late
[49:12] i have a little thing on my phone it
[49:14] pops up and said jesse smith is live so
[49:16] i just looked on to see what oh simon's
[49:19] preaching
[49:20] i heard him preaching on the wheat
[49:22] that's right right really good job
[49:26] but brother brown said ask a question
[49:28] here he said and i i had this before i
[49:31] heard the message
[49:33] he said how can i take a couple bird and
[49:35] make a grain of wheat out of it
[49:37] right
[49:38] he said it's impossible for me to do it
[49:41] good
[49:42] for me to do it
[49:44] the only way it can be is because on the
[49:46] inside of the cuckoo bird there have
[49:48] been transmitted from a cockapoo to a
[49:50] wheat gene seed
[49:52] a cuckle bird to a germ called wheat
[49:54] life he said now you bury that cup of
[49:57] work it'll produce wheat
[49:59] why because the old the old nature the
[50:01] old culprit for nature the whole life
[50:03] has been taken out of it right
[50:06] aren't you glad for that this morning to
[50:08] have the old nature change amen the
[50:10] spirit of god
[50:17] [Applause]
[50:23] amen
[50:24] come along the holy ghost burned out the
[50:25] old nature the old huckleberry man hey
[50:27] man but he left that jean seed in the
[50:29] cuckleberry amen yeah yes
[50:34] he said it'll produce a seed if you're
[50:36] wheat if you're buried that's right
[50:37] because there's a life of wheat on
[50:39] inside of that hufflepuff he said and
[50:41] the life of the couple bird has been
[50:43] taken out the nature of the cocoa bird
[50:45] even though it's been taken out it's
[50:46] still sticky
[50:48] yes
[50:49] yes
[50:51] it will be until this new life has been
[50:53] fully developed out of the ground raised
[50:55] up when it comes forward it'll no longer
[50:57] be a coke over there amen
[50:59] hallelujah church we aren't raised up to
[51:01] this life yet today right brother jim i
[51:03] was the day i was baptized that racist
[51:06] hey man he's talking about a general
[51:07] resurrection when we're ready to go
[51:09] longer to deal with his whole body he'll
[51:10] give us a new body amen yes hallelujah
[51:13] amen
[51:15] but while we're here on this earth and
[51:16] out of the earth the old conqueror bars
[51:19] they're still nicky
[51:21] excuse me
[51:23] because it's got the nature even though
[51:25] it's got the nature of a wheat on the
[51:27] inside
[51:29] god sewed his own nature on the inside
[51:32] of me but this old outside man still
[51:34] needs to cry out oh god deliver me from
[51:36] this right now hallelujah hallelujah
[51:39] hold me back for those presumptuous i
[51:41] can't do it in myself
[51:43] hallelujah he said as long as you're in
[51:45] this life he said you're going to be
[51:46] stick you're going to have a sticky
[51:48] carnal nature
[51:50] i mean some of you young people maybe
[51:51] you've never struggled with some of
[51:53] these things when you get a little older
[51:54] i pray that you never do
[51:56] it but don't be surprised if that old
[51:58] nature raises up and tries to make you
[52:00] do something or treat your sister or
[52:02] your brother the way you shouldn't do it
[52:03] amen that's the old nature amen but no
[52:05] one thing there's a power that can keep
[52:07] you delivered from that amen
[52:09] the power of jesus christ the holy
[52:11] spirit man all we've got to do
[52:16] is amen
[52:19] glory but you know what if you do do
[52:21] that like david did
[52:22] amen he said that he'll he'll if you're
[52:25] a son of god he'll he'll correct you and
[52:27] he'll bring you under judgment
[52:29] and then david cried out in prayer and
[52:31] said lord god forgive me and he said the
[52:33] moment you knew that amen god comes and
[52:35] wash you while you're slowing hallelujah
[52:37] oh i'm so glad of that
[52:41] as long as you're in life you're going
[52:43] to be sticking have to stick your car
[52:44] it's going to bother you as long as you
[52:45] live but inside you there you're born
[52:47] again
[52:49] inside of you you're boring inside you
[52:51] you've got a jean seat of god on the
[52:53] inside but he said don't think that that
[52:55] stinky carnal nature won't bother you as
[52:57] long as you're here it will that
[53:00] that's right
[53:03] wherefore this morning
[53:06] i told you i'm not a long way to preach
[53:07] i'm trying to bring this down to a close
[53:09] wherefore this morning
[53:11] let him thinketh
[53:13] that he stand to take heed that's right
[53:15] bless default that's right each and
[53:17] every one of us in here amen i pray to
[53:19] god that we're all holy ghost filled
[53:21] believers this morning i believe i am
[53:23] amen yes
[53:25] this old guy still bothers me and the
[53:28] only way i get victory over this old guy
[53:30] is every day i pray like david did lord
[53:32] god hold me back
[53:33] i don't want to be found in the same
[53:35] mess i don't want to make a mistake
[53:37] again i don't want to i don't want to
[53:38] lose my temper i don't want to snap at
[53:40] my wife i don't want to do that i don't
[53:42] want to do these things amen all right
[53:45] somebody said well i feel so good when i
[53:47] just give them a piece of my mind amen
[53:50] i don't have enough to spare brother
[53:51] jesse
[53:53] amen and it might make the flesh feel
[53:55] good oh but what to do to the soul amen
[53:57] find your condemnation in me yes
[54:00] hallelujah
[54:03] wherefore let him
[54:05] think as he said lest he fall for
[54:07] there's no temptation taking you like we
[54:09] said
[54:10] there's such as a common command that's
[54:12] right
[54:13] but our god is faithful he will not
[54:15] suffer you to be tempted above that
[54:17] which we're able with the temptation he
[54:19] will make a way
[54:20] of escaping jesus i am
[54:24] [Music]
[54:31] you can do like david did amen when he
[54:33] found himself i can access that way to
[54:35] be delivered from temptation
[54:38] by crying out to god lord god hold me
[54:40] back how many want to say lord god hold
[54:41] me back
[54:43] amen fall into these things hallelujah
[54:47] brother give you really things we need
[54:48] to do that and we really think we need
[54:50] to do that every day i absolutely do
[54:52] think we do and so did jesus
[54:54] yes yes what do you mean so did jesus
[54:57] in luke the 11th chapter and some of the
[54:58] other gospels too but in luke the 11th
[55:00] chapter just happened to be the one i
[55:01] wrote down
[55:03] jesus knew i said we would need to be
[55:05] kept back from temptation
[55:07] and delivered from evil
[55:09] yes
[55:10] because when the disciples came to his
[55:12] deceptive lord god teach us to pray like
[55:14] john taught his disciples
[55:16] beautiful they were they were wanting to
[55:18] be taught how to pray i want you to
[55:20] notice what jesus told how he taught him
[55:22] to pray we read this and say oh that's
[55:24] the lord's prayer most our young people
[55:25] can probably recite it
[55:27] listen to what he's saying in this
[55:28] prayer
[55:30] and he said when you pray say our father
[55:34] amen you know you know when i was a kid
[55:36] it was my father that showed me how to
[55:38] control that horse it was my father that
[55:40] gave me the power a bit of that bit i
[55:42] mean it's our father who gives us a
[55:43] higher power this morning
[55:45] amen go to your father the one who's
[55:48] able to access the blood of god
[55:50] he said we pray say our father which is
[55:53] in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[55:54] kingdom come
[55:56] thy kingdom come amen now in my church
[55:59] if at the moment i'd have said that they
[56:01] would all say well that's brother jim's
[56:02] favorite word
[56:04] and you know it's funny because i heard
[56:05] simon say something about this kingdom
[56:07] last night too hallelujah the kingdom is
[56:09] the holy ghost that's right i heard you
[56:11] say that last night
[56:12] i thought well glory amen i got that in
[56:14] my notes this morning amen amen you know
[56:17] he said he said let thy kingdom come thy
[56:19] will be done in this whole earth just
[56:21] like it is in heaven amen
[56:23] amen i want the power for the of the
[56:26] power of god to be done in my life just
[56:28] like it is in heaven i want this to be a
[56:30] heavenly body for god
[56:33] i can't do it he says i have to have the
[56:35] kingdom let your kingdom come that word
[56:37] if you ever looked it up i never looked
[56:39] up that word kingdom
[56:41] it's my favorite word
[56:42] i think it's pronounced basilia
[56:45] basilia
[56:46] i mean it's a greek word
[56:49] b-a-s-i-l-e-i-a basilia amen i like it
[56:52] it says royal power
[56:55] amen do you mean
[56:59] not to be confused with an actual
[57:00] kingdom but rather the right or the
[57:02] authority to rule over a kingdom i said
[57:06] that's what the holy ghost gives us the
[57:07] power to do that let the holy ghost
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:19] of the kingdom amen amen yes prayer lord
[57:22] teach us to pray amen
[57:25] and the first thing he told him you're
[57:26] going to need the kingdom power in your
[57:28] life to be overcome amen
[57:30] give us this day our daily bread and
[57:32] forgive us our sins
[57:34] and and forgive every one of us
[57:38] as we forgive everyone indebted to us
[57:39] and listen and lead us not into
[57:41] temptation
[57:43] but deliver us from evil god knew that
[57:46] they would need to be delivered from
[57:48] temptation yes god knew that they
[57:51] couldn't do it themselves he said
[57:53] therefore you need the kingdom of god to
[57:56] come down
[57:57] you need the holy ghost ever you need to
[57:59] pray lord god empower me by thy spirit
[58:02] to overcome this old nature amen
[58:04] headlong over the who's like a wild
[58:07] animal amen yes brother people went so
[58:09] far as to say that any man he made
[58:11] without the holy ghost is no more than a
[58:13] brewed peace they made this that's right
[58:14] that's right
[58:16] how many knows that to be the truth
[58:17] that's right
[58:19] church amen that's where we find
[58:20] ourselves him in
[58:22] that's why we need to cry like david
[58:24] hold me back we need to pray every day
[58:26] lord god hold me back
[58:30] hallelujah
[58:32] because you can't do it
[58:33] that's what i thought he could
[58:35] paul thought he could hazal thought he
[58:38] could amen i wonder how many other men
[58:40] and women who thought because because
[58:41] they were filled with god's spirit amen
[58:43] and they just looked away from that and
[58:45] looked to the flesh just a little too
[58:47] long and rather than looking to god he
[58:48] who's able to deliver
[58:50] found themselves in trouble
[58:53] because they trusted like david did i'm
[58:55] a king a man after god's own heart
[58:58] predestinated ordained filled with the
[59:00] holy ghost the rule of israel amen i
[59:02] could never fall
[59:04] that's presumptuous that's right right
[59:09] and he fell to some of the most
[59:10] loathsome sins that a man could fall to
[59:13] that's right
[59:14] because he wasn't able church i'm here
[59:16] to tell you there's not a person in that
[59:18] building that's able to hold yourself
[59:20] back amen
[59:22] you need a higher power hallelujah
[59:25] amen
[59:26] amen amen to hold back this whole wild
[59:29] beast
[59:45] with exceeding joy to the only wise god
[59:47] and savior to him be glory and majesty
[59:49] and dominion and power
[59:52] both now and forever
[59:55] i can't do it
[59:56] you can't do it that's right
[59:58] you might be sitting here this morning
[1:00:00] and you might have fallen you might have
[1:00:01] given in with temptation you might have
[1:00:03] snapped at your wife you might have said
[1:00:04] something you did you might have
[1:00:06] gossiped if you might have
[1:00:07] done something maybe that god delivered
[1:00:09] you to and you say how can i do that sit
[1:00:10] here with the holy
[1:00:12] ghost church if you've done it guess
[1:00:14] what
[1:00:16] you have an advocate with the father
[1:00:17] amen amen
[1:00:20] if you put too much trust in this old
[1:00:21] flesh and it's fallen i mean don't give
[1:00:23] up
[1:00:25] amen and you know what's worse than that
[1:00:26] some people won't they say well i would
[1:00:28] never give up brother jim but they go
[1:00:29] along with that thing in their life and
[1:00:30] they just let that thing fester and
[1:00:32] faster and faster they never make it
[1:00:33] right all right
[1:00:35] you know what david said in psalms he
[1:00:37] said when i kept silent my bones waxed
[1:00:39] as though by roaring me all day long
[1:00:43] he was miserable
[1:00:44] he didn't have the victory in man
[1:00:47] he roared all day long he said for day
[1:00:50] and night the hand was heavy upon me my
[1:00:52] moisture is turned into a drought as of
[1:00:54] summer see ya think about that
[1:00:57] how many have you ever been there oh i
[1:00:59] wish i hadn't hadn't said it
[1:01:01] well then make it right amen yes
[1:01:03] get it taken care of get it under the
[1:01:05] blood man amen
[1:01:07] because david said when i acknowledge my
[1:01:09] sin to thee
[1:01:11] and my iniquity have i not hid
[1:01:13] i said i will confess my transgression
[1:01:15] in the lord and thou forgave us the
[1:01:17] iniquity of my sin he says
[1:01:20] think about that stop and rest on the
[1:01:22] fact that my sins are under the blood
[1:01:25] that i can be held back from doing it
[1:01:27] again
[1:01:30] he said for this shall everyone that is
[1:01:33] godly pray
[1:01:34] unto thee in a time that thou mayest be
[1:01:36] boundaries how many will be godly this
[1:01:38] morning amen if you want to live a godly
[1:01:41] life he said here's what you need you
[1:01:43] need to pray him to him while he can be
[1:01:45] found you need to pray unto him that can
[1:01:48] hold you back in because you can't hold
[1:01:49] yourself back would you stand your feet
[1:01:51] with me hallelujah hallelujah there's
[1:01:53] one who's able to stop i can't do it you
[1:01:56] can't do it amen to him that is able to
[1:01:58] heal me the glory amen yes hallelujah
[1:02:02] when i
[1:02:03] saw myself going down this way i cried
[1:02:06] out to god hold me back lord yes
[1:02:09] he said so everyone that's going to
[1:02:11] leave god he's got to pray the same way
[1:02:13] yes hallelujah amen at the same time
[1:02:18] but with the same attitude quantity can
[1:02:20] still be balanced church is totally
[1:02:22] found in this man
[1:02:26] i wonder how many words be honest
[1:02:27] you know what brother jim
[1:02:30] i need to pray that prayer this morning
[1:02:32] lord
[1:02:34] lord god put this under the blood of
[1:02:36] jesus christ
[1:02:38] lord god don't ever let me get so so
[1:02:40] presumptuous to think that i can do it
[1:02:42] on my own because i can't do it to him
[1:02:43] who's able to keep you from falling
[1:02:45] there's the one that should get the
[1:02:46] they're the one that we should call you
[1:02:49] amen and lord if we have fallen this
[1:02:51] morning amen let me just stick your
[1:02:52] hands there pray for me brother jim that
[1:02:54] i can just be delivered from this whole
[1:02:56] wretched man that i am by calling in
[1:02:58] prayer to the one who's able to deliver
[1:03:00] me i can't do it on my own
[1:03:02] lord god let me find myself every day

[1:03:07] sins lord hallelujah hold me back amen
[1:03:09] for what i have done lord god forgive me
[1:03:11] for what i've done and hold me lord god
[1:03:13] then i would never
[1:03:14] do those things again there's one who's
[1:03:16] able
[1:03:17] there is one that's able to deliver us
[1:03:20] from these presumptuous sins
[1:03:22] but we can't ever access him until we go
[1:03:24] to him and say lord god
[1:03:26] i give it to you i can do it
[1:03:28] i need your help but i'm not strong
[1:03:31] enough
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:33] don't let me ever look away from the one
[1:03:35] who's able to look to this old man
[1:03:36] thinking that i can't
[1:03:38] because you do amen
[1:03:42] god you see hands around the building
[1:03:44] lord i had another hand i'd raise it to
[1:03:46] this world or god let this be my prayer
[1:03:48] this morning

[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:52] presumed that i can get away with
[1:03:54] something or do something
[1:03:56] or hold myself back in my own flesh for
[1:03:59] god
[1:04:01] let me let me just run to you lord god
[1:04:04] and run away from that thing that would
[1:04:06] try to entice this old flesh

[1:04:22] prayer
