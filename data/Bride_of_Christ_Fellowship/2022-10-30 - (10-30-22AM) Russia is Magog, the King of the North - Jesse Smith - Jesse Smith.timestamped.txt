[13:18] sister Naomi sent us a text and said

[13:29] text and said your grandma's kind of
[13:30] sick again so did you know that okay she
[13:34] just said it this morning I think if I'm
[13:35] not mistaken so let's just lift her up
[13:37] in prayer by God's grace good to see you
[13:39] brother Benjamin good to see you sir
[13:41] thank you to see all the saints this
[13:42] morning
[13:43] still enjoying Ohio sisters all right
[13:46] praise God you liking all the leave
[13:48] colors and everything okay
[13:51] yeah it's been about five hours working
[13:53] on leaves yesterday so
[13:54] we know all about leaves in here in Ohio
[13:57] so God bless you and good to see you
[13:59] sage and Jordan God God be with you
[14:02] let's take a few prayer requests yes
[14:04] Austin's Grandma let's remember those
[14:06] that need Miracles like Benjamin Vu I
[14:08] sent him a text this week I don't know
[14:09] if you saw that or not but he's still
[14:11] he's still praying for a miracle so
[14:13] let's pray for him he had a stroke and
[14:14] he hasn't recovered yet from the stroke
[14:16] he's 39 I think
[14:18] or 40 or something like that and he has
[14:20] four kids I think and he's not recovered
[14:23] from the stroke yet but I told him we'll
[14:25] pray for him by God's grace let's pray
[14:27] for him Benjamin Vu is his name
[14:30] but the amen had an unspoken need we'll
[14:32] take that to the Lord in prayer here
[14:33] today
[14:36] anyone else have a need they'd like
[14:38] remembered here sister Nina
[14:40] yes amen
[14:42] definitely prayed for that
[14:46] anyone else have a need here but Austin
[14:48] all right yes sir
[14:53] praise the Lord
[14:56] Hallelujah
[14:57] also just a few uh announcements um I
[15:00] don't know if you saw that next Sunday
[15:02] they're having a Youth Event up in
[15:04] Sheffield it's kind of at the same time
[15:06] as our second service
[15:09] so I kind of want to ask the Saints you
[15:11] know ask Vang and Naomi when I see them
[15:14] but everybody's welcome to drive up next
[15:16] Sunday to Sheffield if if you'd like to
[15:18] if you have time and you want to show
[15:20] them some fellowship we could all drive
[15:21] up there
[15:22] it would take the place of our second
[15:24] service
[15:26] but if people can't drive out there you
[15:28] know my wife will probably just go with
[15:29] the Teeny my teenagers and then I'll
[15:31] stay here and we'll just have a regular
[15:34] service you know so just you know think
[15:36] about that pray about that that's next
[15:38] Sunday
[15:40] yeah
[15:41] it's an at least an hour and 15 minutes
[15:43] from here at least yeah then you know if
[15:45] there's traffic or anything like that
[15:48] and so I think it's a full service right
[15:50] that if I'm not mistaken preaching and
[15:52] things like that and song special so it
[15:54] starts at five is that right
[15:57] five or five thirty so 7 30 end of it
[16:00] and then Fellowship eight
[16:02] be home by yeah so you gotta take all
[16:05] that all that into consideration there
[16:08] um the following Sunday I put out there
[16:10] on the counter will do communion because
[16:12] brother Vang Sia my wife did not get a
[16:14] chance to do communion the last time
[16:15] because uh the funeral and my wife I
[16:18] think was still not feeling well at that
[16:20] point so
[16:21] those are all the updates there by God's
[16:24] grace
[16:25] let's bow our heads here for a word of
[16:27] prayer ask God to minister to these

[34:07] foreign
[34:32] take a new subject I haven't really
[34:35] addressed for a long time
[34:39] I never addressed this individually I
[34:42] like to look at Russia is Magog the King
[34:45] of the North I'd like to just do some
[34:46] teaching here
[34:48] by God's grace
[34:50] Russia is Magog the King of the North
[34:54] so Ezekiel 38 verses 1 through 3 and
[34:58] then we'll go to Daniel 11 verse 40.
[35:10] of course the war with Russian Ukraine
[35:12] is still going on and
[35:14] um
[35:16] you know I can only preach things as the
[35:18] Lord leads me and I know the the war's
[35:20] been going on here for about uh about
[35:22] nine months by God's grace but I was
[35:24] surprised to find out it was actually
[35:25] the fourth war that Putin has engaged in
[35:29] so
[35:31] uh you know there's been a lot said
[35:32] about this war and a lot of preachers
[35:34] had said a lot of things about it I just
[35:37] like to preach about Russia from the
[35:39] scripture
[35:40] that we know that the scripture is
[35:43] actually speaking of Russia so I hope
[35:46] this will be a blessing today we're just
[35:47] going to cover this topic and of course
[35:48] some a few other current events by God's
[35:51] grace so this subject is more of a
[35:53] current event
[35:54] and a little teaching here on the place
[35:56] of
[35:57] Russia in the scripture
[36:00] Ezekiel 38 1-3
[36:03] and the warlord came unto me saying son
[36:05] of man set thy face against GOG
[36:08] the land of Magog the chief Prince of
[36:11] meshech and tubal and prophesy against
[36:14] him and say thus saith the Lord God
[36:16] behold I am against thee ogog the chief
[36:19] Prince of meshech and tubal
[36:23] so Gog is just a general name for the
[36:25] leader of the land of Magog Magog is a
[36:28] land North of Israel
[36:31] So Daniel 11 verse 40.
[36:34] here's where we get the King of the
[36:36] North you've maybe heard brother random
[36:38] say watch Russia the King of the North
[36:40] the Holy Spirit told Brother Branham
[36:41] that
[36:42] in 1933 watch Russia the King of the
[36:46] North
[36:47] brother Ram said that was thus saith the
[36:48] Lord but he said that's not the main one
[36:51] to watch
[36:52] so we're supposed to watch Russia but
[36:55] Russia is not the main one to watch but
[36:56] the RAM said the main Wonder watch is
[36:58] the purple curtain Rome
[37:02] So Daniel 11 verse 40.
[37:08] so let's read this one together if we
[37:09] can here by God's grace I'd like to hear
[37:11] all your voices on this beautiful
[37:12] morning let's read this on three one two
[37:14] three and at the time of the end shall
[37:17] the King of the South push at him and
[37:21] the King of the North shall come against
[37:24] him like a whirlwind with chariots and
[37:27] with Horsemen and with many ships and he
[37:31] shall enter into the countries and shall
[37:34] overflow and pass over amen let's have
[37:37] one more word of prayer if you have a
[37:38] need on your heart let's make anointing
[37:39] to God God is the one who can meet every
[37:41] need all of us have no power all we can
[37:44] do is point to the power point to the
[37:46] absolute point to Jesus Christ praise
[37:48] God and that's what we do today Heavenly
[37:50] Father we just come in the mighty name
[37:51] of Jesus Christ Lord God thank you for
[37:53] satisfying us with your love Lord no
[37:55] matter what the events of today hold
[37:57] even the events of our future we know
[37:59] this you love us dear God and we are
[38:01] satisfied with that the Bible calls it
[38:03] great love the Bible said your love was
[38:06] commended to us that while we were sin
[38:08] sinners Christ died the righteous for
[38:10] the unrighteous thank you God for your
[38:13] amazing love thank you for Amazing Grace
[38:15] for Lord you are love God is love Lord
[38:17] God is Charity so we thank you Lord that
[38:20] you are the very essence of love your
[38:21] Holy Spirit speaks all this love and
[38:24] mercy to us we give you glory here today
[38:26] and we magnify your Holy Name bless each
[38:28] and every one who pressed their way out
[38:29] to the house of God thank you God lord
[38:31] we can be back together again Lord God
[38:33] we just pray your spirit will speak
[38:34] expressly here this this morning Father
[38:37] God give us wisdom and understanding
[38:38] that we might be prepared for your
[38:40] coming in Jesus Christ's name and the
[38:43] saint said amen God bless you as you're
[38:45] being seated praise God
[38:48] so I wanted just to take here uh this
[38:51] morning's message and look at Russia as
[38:53] I said I don't know if I've ever
[38:54] preached on this individually I do have
[38:57] some scriptures to show and some quotes
[38:59] and everything like that I think this
[39:01] would be a good lesson I've probably
[39:02] listened about four or five sermons on
[39:04] Russia you know uh different ones I've
[39:06] tried to go go through all the quotes
[39:07] Brotherman gave about Russia as the King
[39:09] of the North
[39:11] so I just trust it'll be a help to you
[39:14] it's been helped to me
[39:16] these last few days I think the last
[39:18] three or four days I've been studying on
[39:19] Russia so the purpose is you know we're
[39:22] seeking God for Revelation about the end
[39:25] times and really that's because you know
[39:27] each day we're getting closer to the
[39:29] Rapture praise God and so you know we
[39:31] can all say just generally we're closer
[39:33] to the Rapture than we ever have before
[39:35] but you know the the fact what I've seen
[39:38] over the last 10 months or so
[39:41] I shouldn't say 10 maybe nine or eight
[39:42] is that a lot of prominent preachers you
[39:45] know around this message and you know
[39:47] even other ones are saying that this
[39:49] Russia Ukraine war is a sign of the
[39:51] Rapture like it's one of the it's a sign
[39:54] that the Rapture is very soon well of
[39:57] course logically the Rapture is closer
[39:59] today
[40:00] right but uh but is that true is that
[40:04] true that this war in particular
[40:07] is a sign of the Rapture now I was as I
[40:10] was just reading a little bit online
[40:11] there it says Putin has had at least
[40:14] four Wars I remember one of them is
[40:16] Crimea and I can't remember the other
[40:17] one but the other three uh but he's had
[40:20] now four Wars and there's a lot of
[40:22] different reasons why
[40:24] but we'll go through the scripture and
[40:26] we'll see why eventually Russia will
[40:28] invade Israel that's really where
[40:30] they're coming for
[40:31] uh at least according to the scripture
[40:34] now we have a lot of different thoughts
[40:36] you know so a lot of different quotes
[40:38] from Brother Branham on this so I'll be
[40:39] sharing those the best as I can and
[40:41] giving you the scriptures on it uh by
[40:43] the God's grace but have your Bible
[40:44] ready we'll be reading out of uh
[40:46] numerous passages here this morning I
[40:48] want to start with the scripture praise
[40:49] God because brother Adam says we can't
[40:51] do anything without having scripture
[40:52] praise God you can't understand anything
[40:55] without having the scripture first so we
[40:57] want to put the scripture first and
[40:59] we'll look at a few statements brother
[41:01] Ram gives with thus saith the Lord we'll
[41:03] give we'll give that because God has
[41:05] sent a prophet to this last time praise
[41:07] God and he I would say you know he was a
[41:10] he had a special Ministry of restoration
[41:12] he He restored our hearts back to the
[41:14] apostolic fathers praise God he finished
[41:17] the mysteries of God all the all the all
[41:20] the topics the Bible calls mystery
[41:21] that's been revealed to us praise God
[41:23] but brother man wasn't like a Bible
[41:25] writer prophet
[41:27] because a Bible writer Prophet imagine
[41:29] imagine being Isaiah you have 66
[41:31] chapters where every single word is thus
[41:33] saith the Lord imagine that praise God
[41:36] imagine that every single word Ezekiel
[41:39] had over 40 uh if I'm not saying 50
[41:41] chapters Ezekiel maybe 52 I just read
[41:43] through that recently
[41:45] uh 52 chapters in every word is thus
[41:48] saith the Lord so brother Ram was
[41:49] definitely a prophet but we wouldn't say
[41:51] a Bible writing Prophet because we
[41:54] cannot add or take away from the
[41:56] prophecy that's in this book praise God
[41:57] brother man realize that you know in the
[41:59] course of his ministry the Holy Spirit
[42:01] showed him uh you know uh the Seven
[42:03] Seals and the seals on the back side of
[42:05] the book he said the Holy Spirit showed
[42:08] him it cannot be anything outside the
[42:09] Bible whatever Mysteries there are they
[42:11] have to be already contained in the
[42:13] scripture praise God and so that's what
[42:15] we uh put our faith in we put our faith
[42:17] in the word of God and a real Prophet
[42:19] like brother random will only point us
[42:20] to the word of God
[42:22] now what's different about today is that
[42:24] we have brother man's voice on tape so
[42:26] we have his human thoughts and we also
[42:28] have his Divine thoughts most prophets
[42:30] we don't have both of those and the
[42:32] amount that we have today yes we have
[42:34] some of Moses's thoughts and and we know
[42:36] they were human and Abraham's thoughts
[42:38] and different ones
[42:40] even Jeremiah you know saying I'll never
[42:41] preach again but then the Holy Ghost
[42:43] gets on him and says I've got fire in my
[42:45] bones of course I'll prophesy again and
[42:46] you know we have some of their human
[42:48] thoughts but but we have so many human
[42:50] thoughts of brother Branham and so what
[42:52] we need is the holy spirit today to
[42:54] guide us to the truth praise God and
[42:56] that's what the Holy Ghost is meant to
[42:58] do brother man says the Holy Ghost will
[42:59] only point you to the word of God it
[43:01] will only point you to the truth of the
[43:03] scriptures praise God and so that's what
[43:04] we're doing today we're going to look at
[43:06] the things brother Ram said and then
[43:07] we've got to take everything back to the
[43:09] word of God hallelujah
[43:11] now just just to give you an idea gogame
[43:14] is mentioned five times Gog itself is 16
[43:17] hits some of them referred to you know
[43:19] earlier times in in Bible History
[43:22] gay or magogs mentioned 11 times brother
[43:24] random uh I didn't see how many times he
[43:26] said that so I forgot to put that number
[43:28] in there King of the North mentioned six
[43:30] times brother by Brother Branham it has
[43:32] seven hits in the Bible all in the Book
[43:34] of Daniel
[43:35] and brother random said the word Russia
[43:37] over 394 times now I just looked up the
[43:40] ones that had thus saith the Lord on it
[43:41] because those would be the most
[43:43] important ones and I didn't have time in
[43:44] these last few days to study 394 quotes
[43:47] but
[43:49] these are the ones I got through I got
[43:51] through the ones that have strike
[43:52] through lines there uh I think it's
[43:54] interesting Church China is in
[43:56] Revelation 16 2 called the Kings of the
[43:58] East because it's all based upon Israel
[44:01] right Israel so uh China is east of
[44:04] Israel right Russia is North of Israel
[44:06] Egypt is south of Israel Egypt and
[44:09] Ethiopia south of of Israel so
[44:12] everything is ordered in the scripture
[44:14] based upon Israel Israel's God's
[44:16] timepiece how many kids how many how
[44:17] many how many kids Amen to that praise
[44:18] God sorry now I have a whole bunch also
[44:21] about the Antichrist in my my latest
[44:24] book but I I didn't have time to go
[44:25] through that so I just I just want to
[44:28] present what I have so far maybe
[44:29] there'll be a part two on this we'll see
[44:31] uh by the grace of God so if you have
[44:33] your Bibles we read uh Ezekiel 38 I want
[44:36] to start from there by the grace of God
[44:40] again and I'm going to go through what
[44:41] the preachers are saying today so just
[44:43] know that I will I'll get to that by the
[44:45] grace of God
[44:47] as you can probably guess I disagree
[44:49] with a lot of prominent preachers
[44:52] because they say a lot of things I don't
[44:54] agree with praise God but you know God's
[44:56] given them a place God's given them many
[44:58] testimonies and I appreciate them but if
[45:02] they get off the word of God then you
[45:04] know we've got a right to tell them
[45:05] about it praise God and we must stand
[45:08] with the truth at all times praise God
[45:09] and we must do it in love Hallelujah
[45:12] brother Ram did that you know he did
[45:13] that with Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[45:15] A.A Allen brother Brown was able to
[45:16] disagree with love and the Bible said
[45:18] let your words always be seasoned with
[45:20] Grace
[45:22] so I'm going to say I appreciate all
[45:23] these brothers and their gifts and their
[45:24] their large Ministries I'm not going to
[45:27] draw them out of my circle I'm going to
[45:28] draw them into my circle praise God but
[45:30] I'm also going to show I'll be there
[45:31] wrong about this this and that praise
[45:33] God
[45:34] so uh let's look into the word of God
[45:36] here we read verses one to three now
[45:41] what you know what's always I'm just
[45:42] going to use this as a little uh
[45:44] statement you know what's always
[45:45] confused me about Russia as Gog and
[45:47] Magog was Revelation 20 verse 8. uh it's
[45:51] always confused me
[45:53] now Revelation 20 verse 8 cannot be
[45:55] Russia
[45:56] because Russia's already been destroyed
[45:59] as far as the the human government of
[46:02] Russia was already destroyed at the
[46:04] battle of Armageddon
[46:06] because the Bible said Jesus's sword
[46:07] comes out of his mouth that Armageddon
[46:09] and it destroys all the nations right
[46:11] all the armies gathered Armageddon up
[46:13] against Jesus and he destroys all the
[46:15] nations there
[46:16] now Gog and magogo in Revelation 20 is
[46:19] at the end of the millennium so Gog and
[46:21] Magog what's interesting is that Gog and
[46:23] Magog stands for all the people that
[46:26] Satan deceives at the end of the
[46:27] Millennium and he gathers All Nations
[46:30] the Bible said from the four corners of
[46:31] the earth and gathers all them together
[46:33] against Jesus and his people but then uh
[46:37] while Jesus is surrounded Satan thinks
[46:39] he's got him surrounded but they're not
[46:40] God actually surrounds everybody praise
[46:42] God God is so great he he's the one that
[46:45] surrounds all creation Hallelujah and he
[46:47] sends fire from heaven and destroys this
[46:50] Army led by Satan
[46:52] okay so that's the one thing that
[46:54] confused me uh but you know by God's
[46:57] grace I could see why you know the Bible
[46:58] uses Gog and Magog for that uh because
[47:00] there's one great leader right there's
[47:02] one great leader Satan
[47:03] right and then Magog of course is the
[47:06] Northern parts of Israel so it speaks of
[47:08] all these nations uh that are around and
[47:11] surrounding Israel so just so you know I
[47:13] I do believe Revelation 20 verse 8 is
[47:16] not Russia I believe it's just all the
[47:18] nation Satan gathers to fight against
[47:20] the Christ Our Christ praise God and us
[47:24] now if you have your Bibles verse two
[47:26] and three Gog is the title for the
[47:28] leader of Russia it's kind of like the
[47:29] Antichrist we don't know the Antichrist
[47:31] literal name he's just called Antichrist
[47:33] or he's called false prophet and then
[47:35] when he gets all of Satan in him then
[47:36] he's called The Beast
[47:38] uh
[47:39] and we don't know his name we don't know
[47:41] if he's alive today or not many people
[47:42] think so but we don't know for sure if
[47:45] the Antichrist is alive today or not we
[47:46] don't know we don't know if it's the
[47:48] current pope praise God or the next Pope
[47:49] or the Pope after that we don't know we
[47:51] believe it's the pope but we don't know
[47:53] the name and we don't know literally who
[47:55] it is now the land of the North of
[47:58] Israel is called called Magog and it's
[48:01] actually the descendants of japheth uh
[48:04] the son of uh Noah ham Shem and japheth
[48:07] so japheth moved North uh that Israel
[48:11] area there after the flood and then his
[48:13] people are called the Magog people
[48:16] now let's look at verse four here
[48:17] Republic Ezekiel 38 verse 4. and I will
[48:20] turn thee back he's speaking to this
[48:22] great nation of the North
[48:23] and put hooks into thy Jaws
[48:27] so Russia here is likened into an animal
[48:30] right
[48:31] and I will bring thee forth and all
[48:33] thine Army horses and Horsemen and all
[48:35] them
[48:36] uh clothed with all sorts of armor even
[48:38] a great company with bucklers and
[48:40] shields all of them handling swords
[48:43] currently Russia is the second largest
[48:45] military in the world after ours at
[48:48] least as far as what they report now we
[48:49] know China didn't report all the coveted
[48:52] stuff so I don't know if they report all
[48:53] their military stuff we know that for
[48:55] sure uh China likes to hide things and
[48:57] just make themselves look look
[48:58] all-powerful all the time uh but here's
[49:01] a great Army and God Likens Russia unto
[49:05] an animal that he can just put hooks
[49:07] into the animals nostrils and then move
[49:10] him around and control him and that's
[49:12] just like God God controls the United
[49:14] States God controls China God controls
[49:16] Russia God controls uh Africa God
[49:19] controls every nation God is in control
[49:21] nothing can happen to you except God
[49:23] knows all about it praise God
[49:26] nothing can happen to America or any
[49:29] country unless God allowed it you know
[49:32] you know ever since the 2020 election
[49:33] I've always wondered God why didn't you
[49:35] hear my prayer I prayed so much and I
[49:37] just had to come to the conclusion God's
[49:38] not asking me for my opinion God does
[49:40] what he wants to do praise God and ah
[49:43] yes I must make my requests and unto God
[49:45] but God's not looking at me for advice I
[49:47] need to look for him for advice praise
[49:49] God
[49:50] no matter how much I pray about
[49:52] something no matter how much I seek God
[49:53] no matter how much you know I want
[49:55] something it's not what I want God is in
[49:58] control of every situation
[50:01] Glory
[50:02] now
[50:04] verse 5 and 6 now put Persia which is
[50:08] modern-day Iran
[50:10] Ethiopia Libya and Gomer and I forgot to
[50:13] look up which one Gomer was there's a
[50:15] they have modern day equivalents like
[50:17] Persia's Iran today
[50:19] but verse 5 says that now verse 8 and 9.
[50:22] now notice what verse 8 and 9 says
[50:24] Ezekiel wrote this
[50:26] over uh 2500 years ago but verses 8 and
[50:32] 9 say after many days Thou shalt be
[50:34] visited in the latter days Thou shalt
[50:36] come into the land that is
[50:39] I'm sorry into the land that is brought
[50:41] back from The Sword and is gathered out
[50:42] of many people against the mountains of
[50:44] Israel which have been always waste but
[50:46] it has brought forth out of the Nations
[50:48] and they shall dwell safely all of them
[50:50] so God is going to put this judgment off
[50:53] until Israel's dwelling safely now
[50:55] churches Israel dwelling safely today
[50:57] huh
[50:59] they caught they have airplanes flying
[51:01] 24 7. think of the think of the fuel the
[51:04] jet fuel they spend
[51:06] to protect themselves against their
[51:07] Muslim neighbors they they always have a
[51:10] play in the sky always and they have the
[51:12] Iron Dome right we've seen it last year
[51:13] it catches all those all those missiles
[51:15] it intersects all those missiles that
[51:17] they shoot over their neighbors they're
[51:18] Muslim Neighbors
[51:20] but here 2500 years ago God has Ezekiel
[51:24] speak to the the Israelites who are out
[51:26] of the land that's who this letter was
[51:28] for he tells them you know I'm going to
[51:31] raise up God but it's not going to be
[51:32] till many days and here we've had many
[51:35] many days many years praise God
[51:38] and he's going to bring them up when
[51:40] Israel is dwelling safely
[51:43] verse 9 Thou shalt Ascend and come like
[51:46] a storm do we just read about a
[51:48] whirlwind in Daniel 11. how the king of
[51:50] the Lord would be like a whirlwind storm
[51:52] you see the parallels
[51:54] so both prophets Ezekiel and Daniel
[51:56] prophesied to the same thing it was
[51:58] Russia the King of the North also known
[52:01] as Magog
[52:02] all right he comes like a storm Thou
[52:05] shalt be a cloud to cover the land thou
[52:07] and all thy bands and many people with
[52:10] thee
[52:12] so when when these nations come led by
[52:15] Russia
[52:17] Ethiopia Persia Libya when they come
[52:21] their army is going to be so great it's
[52:23] like a cloud that covers the land when
[52:25] was the last time you've seen some fog
[52:27] you ever seen that how the fog covers
[52:29] the land that's how the armies of Russia
[52:32] and all these nations Iran that's how
[52:34] they're going to be coming down to take
[52:36] over Israel do you think God's shaking
[52:38] in his shoes
[52:39] no God's not shaking his shoes God's the
[52:42] one that gave them life praise God
[52:44] but God said although the Army's so
[52:47] great he said the real reality is I'm
[52:50] drawing you down now church God is
[52:52] drawing them down to punish them
[52:54] eventually
[52:55] for all their wickedness think about
[52:57] that all the all the prayers to Allah
[52:59] that the Iran gives
[53:01] all the drunken Russians you know all
[53:03] the all the prostitutes in Russia all
[53:06] the wickedness that they do God is
[53:08] drawing them down in order to punish
[53:10] them they think they're going to come
[53:11] down and Destroy Israel but God is
[53:13] actually saying you think you're high
[53:15] and exalted pride is going before the
[53:17] fall praise God hallelujah
[53:21] God shall not be mocked praise God
[53:24] whatever a man or woman sows whatever
[53:27] they plant in their life they're going
[53:28] to reap from that hallelujah praise God
[53:31] now verse 10-13
[53:34] this uh these scriptures say the attack
[53:37] comes at a time of Peace for Israel now
[53:40] I believe I'm just making sure I say
[53:42] that plainly I believe this can only
[53:43] happen after the Antichrist makes the
[53:46] seven year Covenant with Israel which is
[53:48] Daniel 9 27. the Bible said the prince
[53:52] will make a a league for a week he'll
[53:56] make a covenant with a weak but in the
[53:57] midst of the week the Antichrist will
[53:59] break the Covenant with Israel
[54:02] so I believe this attack comes uh during
[54:05] that seven year uh tribulation period
[54:09] of course after uh well so it would
[54:11] still be the time of peace now verses 8
[54:13] to 19 stated plainly that this is God's
[54:17] Wrath being poured out
[54:19] so this makes me think it's the wrath of
[54:22] God or the Great Tribulation period so
[54:24] let's read 18-19 it shall come to pass
[54:26] at the same time when God shall come
[54:28] against the land of Israel saith the
[54:29] Lord God that my Fury shall come up in
[54:32] my face so God's going to get very angry
[54:34] with Russia God's going to get very
[54:35] angry uh with with Iran
[54:39] for in my jealousy and in my fire of my
[54:42] wrath this is not a time for Grace this
[54:45] is a time of judgment
[54:48] have I spoken surely in that day there
[54:51] shall be a great shaking in the land of
[54:54] Israel
[54:55] now verse 20 notice says all men on the
[54:59] face of the Earth will shake at God's
[55:02] presence
[55:03] this seems to refer to the battle of
[55:06] Armageddon because the Bible said every
[55:08] eye will see Jesus when he returns
[55:11] think about that he might be on one side
[55:14] of the Earth
[55:15] but every eye will see him I wonder if
[55:17] that's uh the satellites in the news I
[55:19] wonder if that's modern technology in
[55:21] that scripture or not I don't know we'll
[55:23] find out you do that or everybody is
[55:25] gathered or Jesus shows himself around
[55:27] the world to everyone and then he comes
[55:30] down for battle at Armageddon not sure
[55:32] how that fits but that's verse 20. I
[55:34] want to read that verse 20 says so the
[55:36] fishes of the sea the files of the
[55:38] Heaven and the beasts of the field and
[55:39] all creeping things that creep upon the
[55:41] Earth and all the men that are upon the
[55:44] face of the Earth shall shake at my
[55:47] presence think of that
[55:49] they're going to think it's an
[55:50] earthquake but it's not it's the
[55:52] presence of Jesus Amen oh what's in the
[55:54] prince of Jesus do here today praise God
[55:57] Amen it says Shake us hallelujah it
[56:00] should shake us to live holy to be
[56:02] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to
[56:04] be filled with the Holy Spirit it should
[56:05] take us to draw close to him praise God
[56:08] oh it's beautiful
[56:11] and the mountains shall be thrown down
[56:13] he's just going to throw down mountains
[56:15] which no one here can do praise God
[56:17] right and the Steep places shall fall
[56:20] and every wall shall fall to the ground
[56:23] every wall think of the Great Wall of
[56:25] China think of all these walls people
[56:27] build up around cities every wall is
[56:29] going to fall when this presence comes
[56:31] to the Earth praise God
[56:33] Hallelujah
[56:35] because it's God drawing this animal
[56:37] down in order to put his Fury and his
[56:40] wrath upon the sinners
[56:42] that come against Israel
[56:45] now notice the verses 21-23 God is going
[56:48] to confuse them and they're actually
[56:49] going to start fighting themselves
[56:52] do you know currently you know with
[56:53] Russia Ukraine it's very hard for them
[56:55] to discern which soldiers which Soldier
[56:57] because
[56:58] ukrainians are very similar to Russians
[57:00] you know they used to be part of the
[57:01] Soviet Union
[57:03] and so if there's certain marks and
[57:04] certain letters and certain bands so
[57:07] that they don't get confused and
[57:09] actually hurt one another but God is
[57:12] going to confuse them
[57:14] here I believe at the or near the battle
[57:16] of Armageddon and they're going to fight
[57:18] against themselves and he's also going
[57:20] to send fire and brimstone perhaps this
[57:23] is referring to the sixth trumpet I
[57:25] don't know
[57:27] but we see fire and brimstone now what
[57:29] other uh judgments speak of fire and
[57:31] brimstone
[57:33] anybody remember
[57:35] Sodom and Gomorrah
[57:37] starting Gomorrah God was displeased
[57:39] with some God was fed up with Gomorrah
[57:41] they were male homosexuals in Sodom and
[57:44] Gomorrah and God burned them with fire
[57:45] that's what God thinks of homosexuality
[57:48] God burned them with fire and there's
[57:50] still records of it today you I've seen
[57:51] YouTube videos they they take the they
[57:53] take the brimstone and they can test it
[57:55] and it still Burns today
[57:56] all these years later you can see the
[57:58] walls and I got a video on that there's
[58:00] over a million views on that one video
[58:01] uh you see they they can they can see
[58:04] where the altar was in Sodom and
[58:05] Gomorrah they can see where all these
[58:07] businesses were they the walkways it was
[58:10] there but God got fed up with it when
[58:12] they wouldn't repent when they God even
[58:14] set Angels down there they wouldn't
[58:16] repent God sent fire and brimstone now
[58:18] look God's gonna do the same thing to
[58:20] Russia same thing to Iran same type of
[58:22] judgment fire and brimstone thank God
[58:24] that you've received Jesus Christ and
[58:27] you don't get God's Wrath you get God's
[58:28] mercy praise God
[58:30] Hallelujah this is what God does the
[58:32] heathe the Nations
[58:34] this is what God does to Sinners who
[58:36] think they can live any way they want
[58:37] they cannot whatever they sow that's
[58:40] what they'll reap but the Bible said
[58:41] let's sow into righteousness and Reaper
[58:43] the Holy Spirit praise God
[58:46] in other words live a life that Jesus
[58:49] Christ will be pleased with praise God
[58:51] plant holy seeds do holy actions do give
[58:55] to the poor hallelujah pray give Holmes
[58:58] fast do holy things and you will reap
[59:01] righteousness praise God
[59:03] amen
[59:06] now that finishes chapter 38 I'm just
[59:07] hitting the highlights because I could
[59:09] devote a whole service to this just one
[59:10] chapter now in chapter 39 verses 1 and 2
[59:14] God calls this Russia to come against
[59:16] Israel and one-sixth of them fall
[59:19] and they become food for the birds does
[59:22] this remind you of something
[59:24] the battle of Armageddon
[59:26] they all come against Jesus right but he
[59:28] comes out of heaven with on a white
[59:30] horse with his white armies we believe
[59:31] that's us by God's grace and all the
[59:34] saints under the ages praise God
[59:36] we don't do any fighting we just follow
[59:39] the king we just follow the fighter
[59:41] praise God God is going to have us fight
[59:43] God's just going to have us watch the
[59:44] victory praise God Amen Hallelujah Jesus
[59:47] does all the fighting and he fights the
[59:49] same way he always has it is written
[59:51] with the word of God that proceeds out
[59:53] of his mouth amen oh Hallelujah
[59:57] notice verse 9 this is a striking
[59:59] statement here
[1:00:01] it takes seven years for Israel to burn
[1:00:03] up all the weapons of this Army
[1:00:06] seven years now that makes me think of
[1:00:08] the tribulation a seven year period but
[1:00:10] it can't be the whole time
[1:00:13] uh because the Bible said they have
[1:00:15] peace for three and a half years so it
[1:00:16] can't be so it's interesting it almost
[1:00:18] seems like after the battle of
[1:00:19] Armageddon there's I don't know if those
[1:00:21] seven years are part of the 1 000
[1:00:23] Millennial years or not
[1:00:25] and it takes seven months to bury all
[1:00:28] the slain soldiers some of them which
[1:00:30] they killed each other but some of them
[1:00:31] which God had destroyed with fire and
[1:00:34] brimstone
[1:00:36] what a what a event here that's going to
[1:00:39] happen verse 25 God says he'll have
[1:00:42] mercy on the whole house of Israel verse
[1:00:45] 27 says it happens after God gathers
[1:00:48] Israel out of their enemies lands which
[1:00:50] he's still doing today praise God I
[1:00:52] share that video with brother William a
[1:00:54] few months ago and I showed how those
[1:00:55] Ethiopians they were raising money where
[1:00:58] they could fly back to Israel as soon as
[1:01:00] they got to Israel as soon as they got
[1:01:01] off the plane they kissed the concrete
[1:01:04] that's got that that's a real dirty kiss
[1:01:05] right there right on concrete but
[1:01:08] they're not kissing the concrete they're
[1:01:09] they're basically showing that they love
[1:01:11] the land of Abraham they're glad to be
[1:01:13] home that's God's land amen God's holy
[1:01:16] mountain is going to rest there someday
[1:01:18] someday that would be the Eternal
[1:01:19] location of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen
[1:01:24] I believe I'd probably kiss that land
[1:01:25] too by God's grace
[1:01:28] Hallelujah
[1:01:30] verse 29 says God pours out his Spirit
[1:01:33] after all this battle and he drags this
[1:01:35] animal down there and judges the animal
[1:01:37] and and pours his wrath and fire and
[1:01:40] brims around the animal uh the Bible
[1:01:42] says then he pours out his Spirit on
[1:01:45] Israel
[1:01:47] is that beautiful that what that has to
[1:01:50] be the 144 000 that just struck me right
[1:01:52] now it actually amen Zechariah 12 10.
[1:01:55] and I'll pour Up on the House of David
[1:01:57] and then the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:01:59] the spirit of Grace and supplications
[1:02:01] and they shall look upon me Jesus whom
[1:02:04] they appears and they shall mourn for
[1:02:06] him as one mourneth for his only son and
[1:02:08] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[1:02:10] that is in baroness for his firstborn
[1:02:12] son so they're bitter they haven't yet
[1:02:15] been born again so see this has to be
[1:02:17] sometime after the two witnesses God
[1:02:20] brings uh those Nations down destroys
[1:02:22] them and yet they still haven't received
[1:02:24] Jesus Christ yet
[1:02:26] but once God destroys Russia once God
[1:02:28] destroys Iran then God is going to pour
[1:02:31] out can you imagine that he's pouring
[1:02:32] out the spirit of Grace and supplication
[1:02:34] God pour it on me more praise God how
[1:02:37] did he has been poured on me these last
[1:02:39] 20 some years God poured out more I want
[1:02:42] more of you let your rain fall upon me
[1:02:44] praise God
[1:02:45] Hallelujah
[1:02:48] now let's look at Daniel 11 you've got
[1:02:50] your Bible go to Daniel 11.
[1:02:57] it's right after Ezekiel so yeah really
[1:02:59] close
[1:03:04] now Daniel 11
[1:03:05] was written after ezekiel's
[1:03:12] let me just check the date on that real
[1:03:13] quick by God's grace
[1:03:19] yeah about 50 years or 40 40 some years
[1:03:21] afterwards Daniel wrote this Daniel
[1:03:23] chapter 11. now it mentions the King of
[1:03:27] the North I believe six times if we're
[1:03:29] not mistaken one two three four five six
[1:03:30] or seven six or seven seven times
[1:03:33] now what's wonderful is that the Lord
[1:03:35] already had me read through the Book of
[1:03:37] Daniel I preached the whole book back in
[1:03:39] uh 2017.
[1:03:41] uh now chapter 11 and Daniel took place
[1:03:44] around 536 BC Daniel was probably 84
[1:03:47] years old verses 2 to 35
[1:03:51] uh were fulfilled around 5 30 BC not
[1:03:54] long after he wrote this and then they
[1:03:57] continue to be fulfilled for about 400
[1:03:59] more years now verses 36-45 seem to be
[1:04:04] about the future Antichrist Pope
[1:04:08] so let's look at that
[1:04:11] now
[1:04:12] let's read verse 40. that was our text
[1:04:14] here Daniel 11 verse 40.
[1:04:23] well you know before we get there let's
[1:04:24] go up to 36. we'll just read this little
[1:04:25] portion here just a small portion of
[1:04:27] scripture and the King should do
[1:04:28] according to his will and he shall exalt
[1:04:30] himself and magnify himself above every
[1:04:32] God and shall speak marvelous things
[1:04:34] against the god of gods and shall
[1:04:37] prosper till the ending Nation be
[1:04:38] accomplished for that which is
[1:04:40] determined shall be done
[1:04:42] so this fits with second Thessalonians
[1:04:44] chapter 2 where the Son of Perdition
[1:04:47] exalts himself above all that's called
[1:04:49] God
[1:04:50] that's why we believe this is speaking a
[1:04:52] type of the Antichrist
[1:04:54] okay because the Antichrist will exalt
[1:04:57] himself above all gods
[1:04:59] he'll sit in the temple of God claiming
[1:05:01] that he is God and remember he'll have
[1:05:03] power to do lying signs and wonders
[1:05:06] praise God remember Church Satan cannot
[1:05:08] cast out Satan Satan cannot heal
[1:05:12] so he's got lying wonders he's doing
[1:05:14] lying wonders kind of like the blood
[1:05:15] coming out of those statues of Mary
[1:05:17] that's a lying Wonder
[1:05:19] that's not a real Miracle that's not you
[1:05:21] anything you see in the Bible
[1:05:23] where it's a real genuine Holy Ghost
[1:05:24] experience it's a lying Wonder
[1:05:28] or they got these people that you know
[1:05:29] they actually have Roman Catholics have
[1:05:31] people that actually uh on the time of
[1:05:33] Easter
[1:05:34] they actually start bleeding like like
[1:05:36] they're taking Jesus place and they're
[1:05:38] experiencing it and it actually happens
[1:05:40] I forget what the name of those things
[1:05:41] are called
[1:05:43] you remember I can't remember there's a
[1:05:44] certain name to it
[1:05:46] they actually have experiences like that
[1:05:48] but Church
[1:05:50] there it doesn't look like it's the Holy
[1:05:52] Spirit you don't see that in the Bible
[1:05:55] I think I'll think of it Brian when the
[1:05:57] sermon's over the name of it apparitions
[1:05:59] there it is apparitions where they see
[1:06:00] Mary there it is I got it before the
[1:06:02] sermon ended it's an apparition they or
[1:06:04] they see Mary or they talk to Mary and
[1:06:06] Mary says pray this many Hail Marys and
[1:06:09] your your loved ones will get well
[1:06:10] that's a lying Wonder
[1:06:13] God does God doesn't send Mary to be the
[1:06:16] intercessor me Mary's not the mediator
[1:06:18] Jesus is the mediator praise God
[1:06:22] well Mary says oh listen to the pope and
[1:06:24] that's that's a lie that's a lying
[1:06:25] Wonder
[1:06:26] but the Antichrist will deceive with
[1:06:29] lying signs lying wonders
[1:06:31] that's right
[1:06:34] remember Satan can transform himself
[1:06:36] into an angel of Light he's not an angel
[1:06:38] of Light but he can transform himself
[1:06:41] like he is an angel of Light he can look
[1:06:43] holy he can look nice and good and
[1:06:45] powerful and and wonderful and it looks
[1:06:49] like a savior it looks like a Superman
[1:06:52] Satan can transform himself like that
[1:06:54] but remember God gave us this great
[1:06:57] wisdom back in the Old Testament he said
[1:06:59] if anybody can produce he said a sign he
[1:07:01] said that's fine he said but look and
[1:07:03] wait till you hear the message look what
[1:07:05] they tell you to do after they do a sign
[1:07:07] or wonder
[1:07:08] Hallelujah in other words listen for the
[1:07:10] voice behind the sign glory and that's
[1:07:12] what we've seen today God gave brother
[1:07:14] random a gift of Divine Healing that was
[1:07:16] wonderful that was a sign but we stayed
[1:07:18] around you and I stayed around and we
[1:07:20] heard the voice of the sign amen
[1:07:22] the voice was Jesus Christ is the same
[1:07:25] yesterday today and forever thank God
[1:07:28] we've heard the voice it's changed our
[1:07:29] life it's the voice of eternal life amen
[1:07:32] amen hallelujah
[1:07:34] so no matter what Miracle we see they
[1:07:36] would see the Antichrist do I don't
[1:07:38] believe we'll see it but whatever
[1:07:39] Miracle they see the Antichrist do
[1:07:40] listen for the voice of the sign
[1:07:42] afterwards
[1:07:44] where he'll be exalting himself above
[1:07:46] the god of gods above Jesus Christ and
[1:07:49] who is Christ the word
[1:07:51] so he'll be exalting his his opinion and
[1:07:55] his his word above the Bible
[1:07:58] and no man ought to do that
[1:08:00] now here's a good lesson I heard this is
[1:08:03] a Google map I think of I'm not mistaken
[1:08:06] Magog
[1:08:09] now there's it's hard to see but that's
[1:08:12] Israel Church
[1:08:13] look where Moscow is Moscow
[1:08:16] the capital of Russia where is it north
[1:08:18] south east or west what is it
[1:08:20] North
[1:08:22] North
[1:08:23] God said the King of the North
[1:08:26] and he said this
[1:08:28] 2500 years ago praise God
[1:08:31] and Russia was you know Derma my
[1:08:34] childhood the Soviet Union was broken up
[1:08:36] right and now looks like Putin's trying
[1:08:38] to build it back together that's what it
[1:08:39] looks like I don't know if they'll
[1:08:40] accomplish we don't know
[1:08:42] but God said two thousand five hundred
[1:08:45] years ago the King of the North is going
[1:08:47] to come down
[1:08:49] right so you have turkey you have Iran
[1:08:51] in there all these nations there uh in
[1:08:54] the tribulation are going to come
[1:08:55] against Israel in other words we can
[1:08:58] trust God's word God's word can never
[1:09:00] fail God knows what he's talking about
[1:09:03] and we need the Holy Spirit to help us
[1:09:04] understand we need to pray for more
[1:09:06] Revelation praise God
[1:09:08] Hallelujah that's what I'm doing praise
[1:09:10] God
[1:09:12] now verse 40 this is what we read
[1:09:14] earlier it seems the King of the South
[1:09:16] and Russia come against the pope
[1:09:18] Antichrist
[1:09:21] so let's read that again
[1:09:22] well actually we never even finished
[1:09:23] verse 37 sorry so let me read 37.
[1:09:25] neither shall he regard the god of his
[1:09:27] fathers nor the desire of women so this
[1:09:29] Antichrist is not going to be into the
[1:09:31] god of his fathers whether it's Jewish
[1:09:33] or Christian
[1:09:35] nor desire women he won't be a man
[1:09:38] that's tempted by women
[1:09:40] nor regard any God for he shall magnify
[1:09:43] himself above all he won't worship women
[1:09:45] he won't worship any other God he will
[1:09:47] only be interested in magnifying himself
[1:09:50] unlike a lot of people we know don't
[1:09:51] they that all they care about is
[1:09:52] theirselves
[1:09:54] but see a real question a real Christian
[1:09:55] cares about other people
[1:09:57] Hallelujah verse 38 but in his estate
[1:10:01] shall he honor the god of forces and a
[1:10:04] god whom his fathers knew not shall he
[1:10:06] honor with gold and silver and precious
[1:10:08] stones and pleasant things
[1:10:10] so it looks like he's going to build
[1:10:11] some type of a a shrine or something
[1:10:14] some type of shrine to himself it looks
[1:10:16] like
[1:10:17] verse 39 thus shall he do in the most
[1:10:19] strongholds with a strange God whom he
[1:10:21] shall acknowledge and increase with
[1:10:23] glory and he shall cause them to rule
[1:10:25] over many and shall divide the land for
[1:10:27] gain so here's where the Antichrist is
[1:10:29] going to have some type of power over
[1:10:31] land in order for him to gain
[1:10:35] verse 40 and at that time of the end
[1:10:37] shall the King of the South now I think
[1:10:39] it's Egypt I don't know now Egypt right
[1:10:42] now is ranked 13th globally in military
[1:10:44] power
[1:10:46] but if you look at the map you know if
[1:10:48] you look back at that map you know the
[1:10:49] right what's right under what's right
[1:10:50] under Israel you know it's Egypt in this
[1:10:52] area Ethiopia there
[1:10:54] so it looks like it's the uh it's Egypt
[1:10:57] but I don't know
[1:10:58] we don't have any thus saith the Lord's
[1:10:59] the King of the South we don't have any
[1:11:01] but we do have thus say the Lord on King
[1:11:02] of the North
[1:11:04] okay
[1:11:05] now look at uh let's finish verse 40.
[1:11:07] and the King of the North shall come
[1:11:08] against him like a whirlwind we saw that
[1:11:11] the same type of language the storm in
[1:11:14] uh Ezekiel 38. with chairs with Horsemen
[1:11:18] with many ships and he shall enter into
[1:11:19] the countries and shall overflow and
[1:11:22] pass over
[1:11:23] okay
[1:11:26] now verse 41 says he's going to come
[1:11:28] into the Glorious land that has to be
[1:11:31] Israel he shall enter also into the
[1:11:33] Glorious lamb and many countries shall
[1:11:35] be overthrown but these shall Escape out
[1:11:39] of his hand even Edom and Moab and the
[1:11:41] chief of the children of
[1:11:43] Amman now go down to verse 45 and he
[1:11:47] shall plant the Tabernacles of his
[1:11:48] Palace between the seas in the glorious
[1:11:51] holy mountains so see the Antichrist is
[1:11:53] going to set up some type of Tabernacle
[1:11:55] in the Holy Land
[1:11:58] right in the glorious holy mountain
[1:12:02] so that's why some people think that's
[1:12:03] either Mariah or Mount Zion you know how
[1:12:05] they're remember I showed you those two
[1:12:07] mountains last year how they're right
[1:12:08] next to each other or maybe that just
[1:12:10] refers to the one mountain
[1:12:12] but some somewhere he's going to set up
[1:12:14] some Tabernacle there
[1:12:16] yet he shall come to his end and None
[1:12:20] Shall help him
[1:12:21] look at that look at this he magnifies
[1:12:23] himself all he does is promote himself
[1:12:26] pump up himself and he's got no friends
[1:12:28] he's got nobody to help him out
[1:12:30] right that's what that's what the devil
[1:12:32] wants you to do devil wants you to make
[1:12:34] yourself the most important one church
[1:12:35] and if you make yourself the most
[1:12:36] important one you're going to have many
[1:12:37] friends because all you think about is
[1:12:38] yourself
[1:12:40] right that's just what Satan wants he
[1:12:42] wants to isolate you and and just get
[1:12:43] just you and him right tempt you and him
[1:12:46] that's what he wants but the Bible said
[1:12:48] a man that's friendly shows himself a
[1:12:51] man that wants Friends shows himself
[1:12:52] friendly praise God
[1:12:54] he'll have lots of friends praise God
[1:12:57] because he's not interested just in
[1:12:58] himself he's interested in other people
[1:13:01] praise God
[1:13:02] all right so you see that we're
[1:13:04] currently we're ranked number one as far
[1:13:05] as our size Russia's two China's three
[1:13:09] Egypt apparently is 13th at least scored
[1:13:12] in the website I was on
[1:13:14] now let's now you can have your Bibles
[1:13:16] down if you want or you can keep them
[1:13:17] there but uh actually you know go to
[1:13:19] Daniel 2. that's a good idea we're in
[1:13:20] Daniel 11 go back to Daniel 2.
[1:13:23] brother man gives us a thus saith the
[1:13:25] Lord on this here so this is very
[1:13:27] important
[1:13:32] now what's interesting is some people
[1:13:34] are making it sound like Russia is going
[1:13:35] to take over the whole world brother
[1:13:37] Adam specifically tells us thus saith
[1:13:39] the Lord Russia will not take over the
[1:13:41] whole world
[1:13:43] right didn't you hear that I heard that
[1:13:45] months ago oh Russia could take over
[1:13:48] Ukraine and where where are they going
[1:13:49] to stop they're going to keep going here
[1:13:50] there and they want World Dominion
[1:13:53] that's what the world the world just
[1:13:55] wants to put fear on people
[1:13:57] but brother Brown tells us the Bible
[1:13:59] says thus saith the Lord Russia will
[1:14:02] never rule the world
[1:14:04] Rome will rule the world and they rule
[1:14:06] it by spiritual influence
[1:14:10] in other words the pope and his of his
[1:14:13] teachings controls many nations
[1:14:16] all right look at our leaders Nancy
[1:14:17] Pelosi Catholic Anthony fauci Catholic
[1:14:21] right
[1:14:22] uh Joe Biden Catholic
[1:14:25] Catholic by name
[1:14:27] right yet they're murderers they murder
[1:14:29] they pay billions of dollars to murder
[1:14:31] babies
[1:14:33] so they're they're no they're no real
[1:14:35] believer they're not a believer in Jesus
[1:14:37] Christ
[1:14:39] now
[1:14:40] in 1954 brother Adam said that's the red
[1:14:43] dragon the devil wears his seat not in
[1:14:45] Russia in Rome and said the devil give
[1:14:48] him his seat and his authority the red
[1:14:50] dragon not Russia I hear a great
[1:14:51] Minister saying Russia is the Antichrist
[1:14:53] why Russia has nothing to do with the
[1:14:56] Antichrist that's communism
[1:14:58] if you'll give me one more night if God
[1:15:01] does I'll prove to you that communism is
[1:15:03] working straight in the hands of
[1:15:04] almighty God to destroy the Roman and
[1:15:06] remember I say this is God's Prophet the
[1:15:09] Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb
[1:15:11] of some sort on the Vatican City and
[1:15:13] Destroy in one hour thus saith the Lord
[1:15:16] now that's a statement right there
[1:15:18] now where does Rhode Island get that he
[1:15:20] gets it from revelation 18. because
[1:15:22] remember I believe it was Ten Kings if
[1:15:24] I'm not mistaken Ten Kings give their
[1:15:26] power to the Beast for one hour and then
[1:15:29] they turn on the Beast
[1:15:31] right and so one of those has to be
[1:15:34] Russia
[1:15:35] because the Bible said they love they
[1:15:37] make love to the woman but then they
[1:15:39] turn on her and hate her and one of them
[1:15:42] destroys her in one hour it's got to be
[1:15:44] Russia
[1:15:45] that's what that's what brother Ram says
[1:15:49] if he's a prophet he spoke with us saith
[1:15:50] the Lord and we believe that
[1:15:53] and the Bible said that God took them
[1:15:55] Cruel Heart of men and put them in his
[1:15:56] hands and there were instruments in his
[1:15:58] hands to fulfill his will and bring back
[1:16:00] to her exactly what she had coming to
[1:16:02] her that's exactly that's the word of
[1:16:04] God
[1:16:07] now three years later now remember
[1:16:09] there's going to be millions of
[1:16:10] Americans meet their Doom what would
[1:16:12] hinder tonight
[1:16:13] for this whole nation to be destroyed
[1:16:15] within five minutes what did science say
[1:16:17] the other night this Nationwide
[1:16:18] broadcast we're five years behind Russia
[1:16:20] they got a Sputnik and they can put a
[1:16:22] man dozens of them send them up there in
[1:16:24] the sky move right over this United
[1:16:25] States and say surrender or go to Power
[1:16:27] in a few minutes of course we would
[1:16:29] surrender to save our life now look at
[1:16:30] that that was in 1957. see what they
[1:16:33] were thinking of like Russia is going to
[1:16:34] fly over our our country and say you
[1:16:36] better give up no you better give up now
[1:16:40] see now would that would could that ever
[1:16:41] happen today no because they have all
[1:16:43] those systems right unless they took the
[1:16:44] power out they could somehow they took
[1:16:46] out their power grid they could do that
[1:16:48] but it probably wouldn't have happened
[1:16:49] in today's with today's technology
[1:16:52] right because we have all these like
[1:16:54] like Israel has the Iron Dome America
[1:16:56] has similar Technologies where they
[1:16:58] could detect missiles being shot but see
[1:17:01] this is what the fear was at that time
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:05] So Not only was there fear in that day
[1:17:08] there's fear today as well
[1:17:10] we've always got a battle fear
[1:17:13] now our brother man said what would
[1:17:14] happen now notice brother random doesn't
[1:17:16] say this is going to happen a lot of
[1:17:17] people confuse this quote
[1:17:19] but Ram said what would happen Russian
[1:17:21] soldiers would pour in by the millions
[1:17:23] running in the streets grabbing the
[1:17:24] women ravishing young girls sweethearts
[1:17:26] whatever it was don't make any
[1:17:28] difference to them sure their Communists
[1:17:29] cold-hearted what would happen go right
[1:17:31] into a nice home kick you out of it
[1:17:33] they'll use it theirself it's Russia's
[1:17:35] then we're a satellite now he's saying
[1:17:37] what wood he's he's not saying this is
[1:17:39] going to happen he said this is what
[1:17:41] people would worry about
[1:17:43] but let me tell you the church won't see
[1:17:45] that she's going to be gone when that
[1:17:47] comes that's thus saith the Lord
[1:17:49] so in other words telling the people
[1:17:51] don't worry about invasions
[1:17:54] there's nothing in the scripture that
[1:17:55] says that about invasion of America
[1:17:57] because America is found in Revelation
[1:17:59] 13.
[1:18:01] she said don't worry about that what
[1:18:02] would happen he said but let me tell you
[1:18:04] the church is gone before there's any
[1:18:07] judgments upon this Earth praise God
[1:18:09] Amen
[1:18:10] the Reason God saved us is to spare us
[1:18:13] from the Wrath that is to come God has
[1:18:15] always spread righteous people from the
[1:18:17] wrath of God Amen
[1:18:18] Hallelujah he spared Noah he spared love
[1:18:21] praise God he spared Enoch he only
[1:18:24] spares Believers praise God because they
[1:18:26] love righteousness and God is a god of
[1:18:28] Mercy praise God
[1:18:31] he spares his children
[1:18:33] Hallelujah so don't confuse us and this
[1:18:37] is why a lot of people think Russia this
[1:18:39] war is actually going to cause Russia to
[1:18:41] invade the United States there's message
[1:18:43] preachers that have said that
[1:18:44] they actually think Russian soldiers are
[1:18:46] going to invade the United States
[1:18:47] remember when that brother remember when
[1:18:49] that Pastor in Kentucky had that dream a
[1:18:50] couple years ago and he said right after
[1:18:52] the 2020 election I saw U.N soldiers
[1:18:54] taking over
[1:18:55] America remember that he said they're at
[1:18:57] the White House and there was no
[1:18:58] president and remember all those things
[1:19:00] and it shook people up
[1:19:02] they shook people up
[1:19:05] so see that's why people get their own
[1:19:06] ideas and and brother I'm just saying
[1:19:09] would happen it wasn't a thus saith the
[1:19:10] Lord it was just a wood
[1:19:12] what would happen potential this is just
[1:19:15] potential praise God
[1:19:17] but brother but brother Adam gives us
[1:19:19] the scripture there let me read the
[1:19:20] scripture keep your place in Daniel 2.
[1:19:22] the scripture is first Thessalonians 5
[1:19:24] 9. first Thessalonians 5 9.
[1:19:30] for God hath not appointed us to wrath
[1:19:33] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:19:36] Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah
[1:19:39] that's the scripture that brother Adam
[1:19:41] gets the inspiration for this the church
[1:19:43] will be gone before wrath is poured out
[1:19:46] you are not children of the darkness
[1:19:48] that deserve wrath you are children of
[1:19:50] the light
[1:19:58] now brother man is talking about
[1:20:00] Jeremiah Jeremiah come back and call it
[1:20:02] all together and said I've got thus
[1:20:04] saith the Lord said hear you people
[1:20:05] hallelujah they're scared of the king of
[1:20:07] Babylon like we're scared of Russia this
[1:20:08] is in 1961. scared of Russia
[1:20:11] right because of the the Cuban Missile
[1:20:14] Crisis remember all these things that
[1:20:15] all the the nuclear uh all the nuclear
[1:20:18] scares of that time
[1:20:20] said you're all getting ready to run
[1:20:21] down into Egypt because you know he's
[1:20:22] coming and we're fleeing from one city
[1:20:25] to another trying to get away from
[1:20:26] atomic bombs and building shelters and
[1:20:28] everything else what good it's going to
[1:20:29] do get rid of the same question
[1:20:33] so brother man is drawing a parallel
[1:20:34] right he's drawn a parallel just like
[1:20:36] just like Jeremiah is saying don't worry
[1:20:38] about Babylon worry about your sin
[1:20:42] that's what God is saying today don't
[1:20:44] worry about Russia confess your sin be
[1:20:46] concerned with getting all the sin out
[1:20:48] of our Lives Hallelujah
[1:20:50] and when sins out of your life you got
[1:20:52] nothing to worry about because you pass
[1:20:54] from wrath unto blessing praise God
[1:20:57] you pass pass from wrath unto God's
[1:20:59] salvation when you confess your sins may
[1:21:02] God help each and every person to
[1:21:04] confess all of our sins amen
[1:21:06] get rid of the sins
[1:21:11] I love this one this is the this is the
[1:21:13] Daniel chapter Two one so if you got you
[1:21:15] got if you've got your Bible go Daniel 2
[1:21:16] 31 if you've got your Bible Daniel 2 31.
[1:21:21] the Catholic hierarchy with all the
[1:21:22] denominations in the world right now
[1:21:24] coming together as an organization the
[1:21:26] confederation of churches organizing
[1:21:28] themselves together it isn't Russia it's
[1:21:31] Rome thus saith the Lord yeah show me a
[1:21:35] scripture where communism or anything
[1:21:36] else besides Rome will rule church I
[1:21:39] just read you the only two passages on
[1:21:41] Russia do they ever rule the world
[1:21:43] no God is using them like an animal
[1:21:47] to pull down here and fight against the
[1:21:49] pope and then God pours out his judgment
[1:21:52] on that animal
[1:21:53] praise God oh we got nothing to worry
[1:21:56] about church amen
[1:21:57] there's no reason to fear God has not
[1:22:00] given you the spirit of fear but a power
[1:22:02] love and a sound mind amen
[1:22:05] Glory show me one verse
[1:22:08] where Russia rules the world
[1:22:10] there's no there's none
[1:22:13] and we don't have that that's thus saith
[1:22:15] my idea that's thus saith the Lord
[1:22:18] notice his next question did the medes O
[1:22:21] Persia succeed in Nebuchadnezzar sure
[1:22:23] did Greece secede them yeah did Rome
[1:22:26] take over from there did it break up
[1:22:28] into 10 ottoman Powers just like we got
[1:22:30] now yes the answer is yes
[1:22:32] okay so go to Daniel 2 31.
[1:22:37] now King Nebuchadnezzar has this dream
[1:22:39] of an image he can't remember and he's
[1:22:41] going to kill his wise men right because
[1:22:43] how can you be wise and not know my
[1:22:44] dreams but God raises up Daniel praise
[1:22:47] God and God tells Daniel the dream and
[1:22:50] the interpretation thereof
[1:22:53] now
[1:22:56] go to verse 38.
[1:23:01] and whosoever the children of men dwell
[1:23:03] the beasts of the field and the fowls of
[1:23:05] the heaven hath he given into thine hand
[1:23:06] and hath made thee ruler over them all
[1:23:08] thou art this head of gold so
[1:23:11] Nebuchadnezzar was the head of gold and
[1:23:13] he ran from 605 to 539 BC
[1:23:18] all right now next verse 39 and after
[1:23:22] thee shall rise another Kingdom In Fear
[1:23:24] To Thee and another third Kingdom of
[1:23:26] brass which shall bear rule over all the
[1:23:29] Earth
[1:23:32] okay verse 40. and the fourth Kingdom
[1:23:34] shall be strong as iron
[1:23:36] for as much as iron breakthrough them
[1:23:38] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[1:23:40] iron that breakth all these shall it
[1:23:42] break in pieces and Bruise
[1:23:45] and whereas thou saws the feet and Toes
[1:23:48] part of Potter's claim part of iron the
[1:23:50] kingdom shall be divided but there shall
[1:23:52] be in it of the strength of the iron for
[1:23:54] as much as thou saw us the iron mix with
[1:23:56] Miri clay and the toes of the feet were
[1:23:59] part of iron and part of clay so the
[1:24:01] kingdom shall be partly strong and
[1:24:03] partly broken
[1:24:05] and whereas thou saws iron mixed with
[1:24:07] Miri clay they shall mingle themselves
[1:24:09] with the seed of men but they shall not
[1:24:11] cleave one to another even as iron is
[1:24:14] not mixed with clay
[1:24:16] so any historian will tell you this
[1:24:18] after Babylon came the Persians which is
[1:24:21] modern-day Iran
[1:24:23] after the Persian Empire came the
[1:24:25] Grecian Empire Alexander the Great after
[1:24:27] Alexander the Great came the Roman
[1:24:29] Empire
[1:24:31] but then the Roman Empire was like the
[1:24:33] legs that broke into two parts East and
[1:24:34] West
[1:24:35] right now we are down here at the toes
[1:24:38] we have iron and clay at the feet
[1:24:42] iron represents Roman Catholicism
[1:24:45] clay represents the Protestant churches
[1:24:48] who are teaching things against the word
[1:24:50] of God
[1:24:51] and they mingle together
[1:24:54] but they don't mix
[1:24:57] right like I've got family where one was
[1:24:59] Protestant one was Catholic one or to
[1:25:01] get married they both got to be Catholic
[1:25:03] and that's exactly what the Bible said
[1:25:04] the Bible said they mingle their seeds
[1:25:07] together see Catholics marrying
[1:25:08] Protestants Protestants American
[1:25:09] Catholics they're meaningless elves
[1:25:11] together but they never really mix you
[1:25:13] still got Protestants you still got
[1:25:14] Catholics
[1:25:16] and church this is thus saith the Lord
[1:25:18] this image stands until Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] returns at Armageddon praise God
[1:25:25] in other words Rome Rules by the
[1:25:27] Catholic church and the Protestant
[1:25:28] churches Rome rules through them until
[1:25:31] Jesus Christ comes back at the battle of
[1:25:34] Armageddon and the church said
[1:25:36] if you don't believe that look at verse
[1:25:37] 44.
[1:25:38] and the days of these Kings shall the
[1:25:40] god of Heaven set up a kingdom which
[1:25:42] shall never be destroyed see all these
[1:25:45] kingdoms get destroyed but not Jesus
[1:25:47] Kingdom
[1:25:48] and when the kingdom shall not be left
[1:25:50] to other people
[1:25:52] I'm sorry but it shall break in pieces
[1:25:53] and consume all these kingdoms and it
[1:25:55] shall stand forever
[1:25:57] for as much as thou saws that stone that
[1:26:00] was cut out of the mountain without
[1:26:01] hands that it break in pieces the iron
[1:26:03] the brass the clay the silver the gold
[1:26:05] the great God hath made known to the
[1:26:08] king what shall come to pass Hereafter
[1:26:10] and the dream is certain and the
[1:26:12] interpretation is sure oh Church we're
[1:26:15] not guessing on this it is absolutely
[1:26:18] certain it is sure Rome is going to rule
[1:26:21] not Russia praise God and the coming of
[1:26:24] Jesus Christ breaks down the day of man
[1:26:26] this is the day of Gentiles but when
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ comes back praise God at
[1:26:30] the battle of Armageddon he breaks down
[1:26:32] these kingdoms all these Kings of Men
[1:26:34] are broken down and there and then he
[1:26:36] sets up this great Kingdom which you and
[1:26:38] I are part of Amen
[1:26:40] we went through it a couple Wednesdays
[1:26:42] ago you and I are in the government or
[1:26:44] the kingdom of almighty God hallelujah
[1:26:47] amen because we won't join with the
[1:26:49] Catholics we won't join with the
[1:26:50] Protestants we won't we won't join with
[1:26:51] the homosexuals we won't join with all
[1:26:53] these Wicked people but we'll join to
[1:26:56] Jesus Christ for he is Holy he is truth
[1:26:58] he is the great God Amen
[1:27:03] thank God Hallelujah
[1:27:05] so we have to fear about Russia ruin the
[1:27:07] world
[1:27:08] Russia is not going to rule the world
[1:27:11] Rome is going to rule the world
[1:27:13] and we got that thus saith the Lord see
[1:27:15] they're already ruling the world
[1:27:18] right the Roman the Roman influenced the
[1:27:20] bankers right the Catholic Church
[1:27:21] influences the bankers Austin studied on
[1:27:23] that it's got to make sense we have all
[1:27:25] these Catholic leaders that control
[1:27:27] these billions of dollars that they just
[1:27:29] print money out of nowhere that's why
[1:27:30] Foods twice they're three times
[1:27:32] expensive as it was last year
[1:27:34] just print make all this money
[1:27:36] Catholic people
[1:27:38] it's Catholics Catholics are in control
[1:27:41] of this
[1:27:45] now I better stop right there because I
[1:27:47] was going to say something very stuff
[1:27:48] right I was going to just blast
[1:27:49] something so I'm not going to blast it
[1:27:50] right now I'll say that for later
[1:27:52] there's a little bit nicer picture of it
[1:27:54] you know that one that one's not very
[1:27:55] high quality you know as far as the the
[1:27:57] pixels you know I guess but
[1:27:59] Babylon
[1:28:01] Persian Grecian Roman at the bottom
[1:28:04] though it goes to Clay and iron a
[1:28:06] mixture that's the holy that's the
[1:28:08] Catholic church and the Protestants are
[1:28:10] mixing down at the bottom
[1:28:12] all right the church said
[1:28:14] all right they got a good picture if you
[1:28:16] need any of these pictures let me know
[1:28:16] you can find them online too they're
[1:28:18] pretty easy to find
[1:28:21] church this is why nobody can shake us
[1:28:23] this is why there's nobody could come
[1:28:25] around and say well you're wrong on this
[1:28:26] we're right because we've got thus saith
[1:28:28] the Lord
[1:28:29] every Prophet there ever was had thus
[1:28:32] save the Lord amen that's how we know
[1:28:34] we're right praise God not just have it
[1:28:36] but it actually makes sense in the Bible
[1:28:39] and God has backed it up over and over
[1:28:41] and over again praise God
[1:28:46] foreign
[1:28:47] Hallelujah
[1:28:49] now let's get to some other quotes about
[1:28:51] Russia just so you can have a better
[1:28:53] understanding of why why our message
[1:28:55] preachers why are some of them pushing
[1:28:56] Russia so hard
[1:28:59] well here's why
[1:29:02] brother man was talking about this
[1:29:03] Vision he had in 1933 before World War
[1:29:05] II of course when we when we went to war
[1:29:08] with Germany he said watch Russia the
[1:29:10] voice said watch Russia communism Nazism
[1:29:11] fascism watch Russia but that is not the
[1:29:14] main one to watch well why are them
[1:29:16] preachers making it sound like we're
[1:29:17] supposed to watch Russia so much that's
[1:29:19] not the main one to watch
[1:29:22] it shall also has been an evil thing
[1:29:24] done in the country they permitted women
[1:29:26] to vote that is a woman's Nation see and
[1:29:28] she'll pollute this nation as Eve did
[1:29:30] Eden and now you see why I'm hammering
[1:29:32] the way I do I got thus saith the Lord
[1:29:35] now just let me say for our visitors a
[1:29:37] Christian woman makes a good vote
[1:29:40] so I want you to understand this quote
[1:29:42] most women though are not Christians
[1:29:45] let me see like this most men are not
[1:29:46] Christians
[1:29:48] so most men do bad votes too right in
[1:29:52] most cases so I want you to understand
[1:29:54] the balance of this quote whatever I
[1:29:55] must say
[1:29:57] you know evil women and not once women
[1:29:59] got the opportunity to vote most of them
[1:30:01] were Sinners right so they voted for the
[1:30:02] wrong person
[1:30:03] they voted for the wrong leaders
[1:30:05] that's why we got some of these these
[1:30:07] agencies today right Malachi go through
[1:30:09] some history right Woodrow Wilson and
[1:30:11] some of these other guys
[1:30:13] JFK and different ones
[1:30:15] look listen thou saith the Lord repent I
[1:30:19] predict three curtains in the name of
[1:30:20] the Lord there's one called the Iron
[1:30:22] Curtain which will be Russia watch Red
[1:30:24] China that'll be the bamboo curtain
[1:30:26] they're horrible but watch the purple
[1:30:29] curtain that's rising in the United
[1:30:31] States and over the world the Roman
[1:30:33] Empire the cruelest of them all
[1:30:36] look at that America is so cruel do you
[1:30:39] know after uh Biden got in office and
[1:30:41] and Harris and Pete bootage did you know
[1:30:43] after that all their embassies started
[1:30:45] flying the homosexual flags and they
[1:30:46] never flew before
[1:30:48] in all these in all these nations
[1:30:51] it's total perversion it's the cruelest
[1:30:53] of them all and then they send billions
[1:30:55] of dollars of AIDS they can kill their
[1:30:57] babies which babies are the greatest
[1:30:58] blessing outside of salvation
[1:31:02] right babies are God's Heritage babies
[1:31:06] are God's possession that he lets you
[1:31:09] borrow for a few years parents and the
[1:31:11] parents said amen
[1:31:14] those are souls that eventually God is
[1:31:17] going to grow let them grow up and then
[1:31:18] God's Gonna lead them you just get them
[1:31:20] for about 18 years maybe
[1:31:22] sometimes a little longer
[1:31:24] hope I get mine a little longer
[1:31:26] don't tell Lydia I said that
[1:31:28] but look how cruel
[1:31:30] look how cruel they are they're
[1:31:32] promoting uh and Matt Walsh did that
[1:31:35] documentary and he went to other nations
[1:31:37] and said would you want to live would
[1:31:39] you want to move to America where
[1:31:40] they're telling a woman can be a man a
[1:31:42] man could be a woman these guys are like
[1:31:43] no I don't want to go over there
[1:31:46] where where children can have surgeries
[1:31:48] and cut off their private parts and and
[1:31:50] and then taught this in school is that
[1:31:53] is that a great place you want to be and
[1:31:55] these guys are like no I would never
[1:31:56] want to go that there's a shot how can
[1:31:58] this happen
[1:32:00] it's the cruelest system of them all
[1:32:01] this Roman Catholic system thank God
[1:32:04] that Martin Luther balled them out
[1:32:07] praise God thank God Amen
[1:32:09] Hallelujah that was a star in the hand
[1:32:11] of Jesus amen hallelujah
[1:32:14] the pope is not the universal Authority
[1:32:16] praise God
[1:32:17] we protest the authority of the Roman
[1:32:20] Catholic church we stand for the
[1:32:22] authority of the revealed word of God
[1:32:24] hallelujah
[1:32:25] the Holy Bible the King James version
[1:32:27] thank you Jesus

[1:32:34] Version Bible all the other ones got
[1:32:35] mistakes

[1:32:38] it's still mistakes
[1:32:40] get a King James one we know there's no
[1:32:42] mistakes in there
[1:32:45] so God bless you too
[1:32:49] the cruelest of all of these is the
[1:32:52] Roman Catholic Church who's the one who
[1:32:54] did all those papal Wars what which
[1:32:57] church did the Dark Ages
[1:32:59] which church did the Inquisition were
[1:33:01] they killed over a hundred million
[1:33:02] people that was the Roman Catholic
[1:33:04] Church
[1:33:05] the cruelest of them all
[1:33:08] you see how they donated a uh 80 million
[1:33:12] dollars of black lives matter and not
[1:33:13] one of those dollars went to help a
[1:33:15] community it just made the founders rich
[1:33:19] right and that really is a homosexual
[1:33:21] organization
[1:33:23] because they want to destroy the nuclear
[1:33:26] family that God set up
[1:33:28] and all the Catholics said let's vote
[1:33:29] for them Nancy Pelosi said let's vote
[1:33:31] for them or let's give to them Joe Biden
[1:33:33] said let's give to that organization
[1:33:34] look what happened
[1:33:35] they don't care about anybody except
[1:33:37] themselves
[1:33:39] but God cares about everybody God gives
[1:33:41] Mercy to everybody God's extending the
[1:33:43] hand of love God is love praise God that
[1:33:45] we need more than love of God hallelujah
[1:33:48] amen but I'm trying to show you this
[1:33:50] Roman Catholic system is the cruelest of
[1:33:52] all of them
[1:33:54] because it's thus saith the Lord
[1:33:58] it's iron and clay and those Catholics
[1:34:00] won't Bend for anybody
[1:34:03] either become a Catholic you're not
[1:34:04] getting married to these Catholics right
[1:34:05] that's what
[1:34:06] you either become a Catholic or you're
[1:34:08] not a part of our family
[1:34:10] they will not Bend for anybody
[1:34:13] he says remember in the name of the Lord
[1:34:15] get away from it come away from anything
[1:34:18] that's attached to the Roman Catholic
[1:34:19] Church
[1:34:20] flee to the Rock the coming of the Lord
[1:34:22] is at hand we need a conference I need a
[1:34:24] conference to talk these things over
[1:34:25] with God the church is at the end of a
[1:34:27] road let us pray amen now I'm going to
[1:34:30] I'm going to keep preaching I'm not
[1:34:31] going to stop and pray
[1:34:33] if you got your Bible go to Revelation
[1:34:34] 16 2 I'll show you where China's in the
[1:34:36] Bible this was fresh to me I hadn't
[1:34:38] thought about this before
[1:34:39] brother says in the name of the Lord now
[1:34:41] yeah I read this earlier
[1:34:43] red China China is the bamboo current
[1:34:45] China's in Revelation 16 2.
[1:34:52] remember this is during the vials
[1:34:55] which are poured out in the last half of
[1:34:57] Daniel's 70th week the last three and a
[1:35:00] half years
[1:35:01] Revelation 16 verse 2. this is the first
[1:35:05] vial
[1:35:08] did I write that down right
[1:35:12] I'm sorry it's 1612 I'm sorry let me fix
[1:35:15] that real quick I'm sorry I got in a
[1:35:17] hurry I missed the one on there there we
[1:35:19] go
[1:35:21] sorry it's a sixth vial sixth vowel and
[1:35:23] the sixth Angel poured out his vow upon
[1:35:25] the great river Euphrates and the water
[1:35:27] there was dried up and the way of the
[1:35:29] kings that the way of the kings of the
[1:35:32] East might be prepared
[1:35:34] see God has to dry up the river
[1:35:36] Euphrates so China can bring all their
[1:35:39] soldiers
[1:35:40] over down to the battle of Armageddon
[1:35:43] right the kings of the East
[1:35:46] who's east of Israel China
[1:35:48] Japan right India East
[1:35:52] the kings of the East need a way they're
[1:35:54] soldiers need a way to get to Israel God
[1:35:56] has to dry up the river so they can walk
[1:35:58] through
[1:36:00] isn't that interesting God dried up a
[1:36:01] river to save Israel God drives up a
[1:36:04] river
[1:36:05] to protect Israel right and bring
[1:36:06] Israel's enemies to their knees
[1:36:09] interesting bye
[1:36:11] what a thought
[1:36:12] so see
[1:36:14] it was said in the name of the Lord and
[1:36:16] we can see it it's right in the Bible
[1:36:17] okay I've already seen the Bible
[1:36:20] all right praise God
[1:36:22] are getting tired are you deep thinking
[1:36:23] which one is it
[1:36:25] do you think okay good because if you're
[1:36:27] tired I'll try to slow this machine down
[1:36:28] here I try to so I'll try to shorten
[1:36:31] this up here
[1:36:33] I'm starting to feel good right now by
[1:36:34] God's grace the woman he says the Beast
[1:36:37] was Scarlet this Roman Catholic church
[1:36:38] but the woman was red and purple now
[1:36:41] have I not warned you the other day that
[1:36:42] there's three curtains I don't know how
[1:36:43] many how long I live but remember this
[1:36:45] as I've told you many years ago watch
[1:36:46] Russia there's three curtains remember
[1:36:48] this this is the Iron Curtain
[1:36:50] there's the bamboo curtain red China so
[1:36:52] forth and there's the purple curtain you
[1:36:54] watch that curtain that's the deceiver
[1:36:57] that's the deceiver
[1:37:01] so see that's that's where Deception
[1:37:03] comes in uh the Catholics like we said
[1:37:04] Joe Biden and and uh AOC they're all
[1:37:07] Catholic Anthony fauci they're the
[1:37:09] deceivers they they act like they're the
[1:37:11] good people they act like they're
[1:37:12] standing up for what's right but they're
[1:37:13] actually deceiving people
[1:37:18] now here's the purpose of this here by
[1:37:19] God's grace
[1:37:21] I've been you know I've been thinking
[1:37:22] I've been hearing preachers for I love
[1:37:23] hearing preachers preach I listen to
[1:37:25] preaching all the time that's usually
[1:37:26] what I listen to you know when I listen
[1:37:27] to things on my drive
[1:37:31] but prominent preachers are assuming the
[1:37:34] Russian Ukraine war is signaling the
[1:37:36] signaling the imminent return of Christ
[1:37:39] in the Rapture so they're saying like
[1:37:40] this is like the last war that's
[1:37:43] basically what they're saying
[1:37:44] this is the last war and the Rapture
[1:37:46] they're saying is any day any hour
[1:37:49] now can the live stream see any of those
[1:37:51] words up there honey
[1:37:53] they can okay
[1:37:55] let's see
[1:37:57] well then I'm going to turn this off
[1:37:58] then all right so
[1:38:00] sorry about that
[1:38:02] if you want to copy this church I'll
[1:38:04] email it to you I do that I did that
[1:38:05] last Sunday brother come up
[1:38:07] brother Bondo from Albion and he wanted
[1:38:09] all my notes I sent him a PDF all the
[1:38:11] notes
[1:38:13] so are they right are these preachers
[1:38:15] right saying uh
[1:38:17] this is the last war before the Rapture
[1:38:20] well I don't think so I don't know for
[1:38:21] sure only God knows but I don't think
[1:38:24] this is the last war Putin's already
[1:38:26] done four Wars he might do more
[1:38:29] we don't know nobody knows
[1:38:31] and I'm gonna share the reasons why I
[1:38:33] believe this here I believe this is just
[1:38:36] a birth pain but not the last birth pain
[1:38:39] and it seems to me these preachers are
[1:38:41] presuming okay so what I'm trying to do
[1:38:43] now is I'm trying to place Us in
[1:38:45] Prophecy this is the million dollar
[1:38:47] question how close are we to the Rapture
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:50] of course we don't we never try to
[1:38:53] exactly figure it out and guess the
[1:38:54] actual day in the hour no man can do
[1:38:56] that unless they're lying right they're
[1:38:58] lying Jesus said no man knows the day of
[1:39:00] the hour it'll always come at a time
[1:39:02] when they think not
[1:39:06] but if you have your uh Bible let's go
[1:39:08] to Matthew 24
[1:39:10] I believe it's
[1:39:12] eight and nine but let's see
[1:39:14] I could be
[1:39:16] wrong on that
[1:39:20] seven and eight yeah Matthew 24 7 8.
[1:39:25] I currently believe that this this war
[1:39:27] is just another one of the birth pains
[1:39:31] that God is allowing until Armageddon
[1:39:34] comes of course what's Armageddon comes
[1:39:36] the Earth gets a brand new start that's
[1:39:37] the birth of a new day it's the Lord's
[1:39:39] Day Hallelujah
[1:39:43] now I mainly believe that church because
[1:39:46] the Rapture happens right around the
[1:39:48] moment where they're about the
[1:39:50] government is about to lay down the mark
[1:39:51] of the beast and kill anybody who
[1:39:53] descends
[1:39:54] I just don't see like I don't feel like
[1:39:56] our government is that close
[1:39:59] now they're getting closer like now
[1:40:00] they've arrested Steve Bannon they
[1:40:02] arrested uh uh who else
[1:40:05] some different conservative they
[1:40:06] actually well I said not arrest but they
[1:40:07] are threatened to arrest them they're
[1:40:09] breaking in their houses through the FBI
[1:40:10] that FBI is breaking in conservatives
[1:40:12] houses right like project Veritas Donald
[1:40:15] Trump's estate there now he's not a
[1:40:17] Godly Man in any way I'm not saying but
[1:40:19] he's more right than they are but he's
[1:40:20] not godly I don't even think he's saved
[1:40:22] so I'm not saying go Trump I'm not
[1:40:24] saying that I'm saying go Jesus that's
[1:40:25] what I'm saying
[1:40:27] I think you should vote Yes I think you
[1:40:29] should vote
[1:40:31] but what I see is that
[1:40:33] this is the closest it's ever been in my
[1:40:35] lifetime
[1:40:36] where true conservatives are or they're
[1:40:38] now getting uh invaded right breaking in
[1:40:41] their homes basically
[1:40:44] taking all their property and everything
[1:40:46] like that that's the closest we've got
[1:40:48] but are they close enough to almost
[1:40:50] killing anyone who descent with them I
[1:40:52] don't see that quite yet
[1:40:56] that's just my understanding
[1:41:00] now in Matthew 24 7-8 Jesus said Nation
[1:41:04] shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[1:41:06] against Kingdom and there should be
[1:41:07] famines and pestilences and earthquakes
[1:41:09] and diverse places
[1:41:11] all these are the being of Sorrows so
[1:41:13] Jesus said the next 2 000 years are
[1:41:15] going to have all these things did you
[1:41:17] know a child dies from starvation every
[1:41:19] 10 seconds how many kids have died since
[1:41:21] we come into service today around the
[1:41:23] world
[1:41:23] because Jesus said there'd be famines in
[1:41:25] the Earth
[1:41:26] every 10 seconds think about that
[1:41:30] every 10 seconds
[1:41:31] Jesus said there'd be famines that's the
[1:41:33] word of God
[1:41:34] right and we're spending all this money
[1:41:36] trying to blow people up why don't we
[1:41:38] send that money to give people some food
[1:41:40] because it's the cruel system of the
[1:41:42] Roman Catholic Church that's why they
[1:41:45] say they care for the poor but they
[1:41:46] don't
[1:41:48] see everybody see that by God's grace
[1:41:51] they'll put all this money send it over
[1:41:53] there to Ukraine why don't they print
[1:41:54] some money and send food to these
[1:41:56] starving countries
[1:41:57] because they don't care
[1:41:59] they want us they want to pay them so
[1:42:01] they can buy uh their weapons so because
[1:42:03] they they know people who own the
[1:42:05] companies and their companies get rich
[1:42:07] praise God that's why they want it
[1:42:09] they want to get rich off the war
[1:42:13] because they're Wicked people
[1:42:17] so Jesus says famines what are
[1:42:19] pestilences think of all the think of
[1:42:21] covid-19 the pestilence
[1:42:24] right we had all the swine flu that was
[1:42:26] maybe before your time that was kind of
[1:42:28] when I was a teenager Millions died in
[1:42:30] the swine flu
[1:42:31] all these pestilences now they they just
[1:42:34] put one out last week remember Boston
[1:42:36] University put out a new covet last week
[1:42:38] where it said it'll kill 80 percent of
[1:42:39] the people that get it see they're
[1:42:40] trying to put fear on us
[1:42:42] right
[1:42:44] pestilence
[1:42:46] Jesus said there would be pestilences
[1:42:48] come
[1:42:51] this all has to take place and Wars
[1:42:54] earthquakes earthquakes are up by the
[1:42:55] thousands there's just more and more
[1:42:58] earthquakes all the time God is shaking
[1:43:00] the Earth amen he's giving the last
[1:43:03] shakes praise God get ready I'm
[1:43:04] returning praise God he's shaking it
[1:43:06] more and more thank God that he's
[1:43:08] shaking our lives praise God thank God
[1:43:10] he's shaking us to wake us up so we're
[1:43:12] ready for his coming praise God Amen
[1:43:17] now go to first Thessalonians 5. so
[1:43:19] that's the verse I just believe this war
[1:43:21] is just another one of the wars I don't
[1:43:23] think it's the last war
[1:43:24] but I could be wrong I'm not God I'm
[1:43:26] just saying I'm trying my best to look
[1:43:27] at the scripture
[1:43:32] first Thessalonians 5. let me get to
[1:43:35] this eventually but one reason I don't
[1:43:36] believe it because these guys who are
[1:43:38] predicting these preachers who are
[1:43:40] saying this is the last war
[1:43:42] they're the ones calling themselves the
[1:43:44] greatest of all time
[1:43:46] I got a hard time believing that God's
[1:43:48] going to let them know the last war
[1:43:49] before the Rapture when they're so full
[1:43:52] of Pride and exalting themselves as the
[1:43:53] greatest of all time
[1:43:55] I would think God would bypass them and
[1:43:57] let them live on and die and then move
[1:43:59] on to the next Generation that's what I
[1:44:00] would think God would do
[1:44:01] because God's done done that all through
[1:44:03] these 2000 years
[1:44:05] all these guys Charles tase Russell
[1:44:08] Uriah Smith the founders of the
[1:44:10] seven-day Adventists the founders of the
[1:44:11] Jehovah's Witnesses all these guys made
[1:44:13] predictions about the Rapture and mist
[1:44:15] and God let them die
[1:44:19] because they were pridefully exalting
[1:44:21] themselves like they were prophets and
[1:44:22] they knew the year of the coming of the
[1:44:24] Lord or something like that God let them
[1:44:25] die
[1:44:27] so Jesus teachers that's what I believe
[1:44:29] I could be wrong I could be wrong
[1:44:31] but but here's my here's my here's my
[1:44:34] love and joy if it comes if the Rapture
[1:44:36] comes tomorrow I'm ready because I got
[1:44:37] the Holy Ghost praise God right I
[1:44:40] repented I got baptized in the name of
[1:44:41] the Lord Jesus Christ I've been serving
[1:44:43] Jesus Christ with all my heart soul mind
[1:44:45] and strength these last 22 years and if
[1:44:48] it comes tomorrow I'm ready to go praise
[1:44:49] God
[1:44:51] but if it don't come tomorrow
[1:44:53] and it comes 100 years later I'll be the
[1:44:55] I'll be the first to rise because the
[1:44:57] dead in Christ will rise first
[1:44:59] see see
[1:45:01] how see how church we can overcome
[1:45:03] living in fear
[1:45:05] we can overcome living in fear and we
[1:45:08] can have confidence that we know Jesus
[1:45:10] Christ
[1:45:13] and we can know him in the power of his
[1:45:14] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:45:16] sufferings
[1:45:19] first Thessalonians 5 1-2 now this is
[1:45:21] right after the Rapture scriptures in
[1:45:23] the previous chapter verse one but of
[1:45:26] the times and the seasons Brethren you
[1:45:27] have no need that I write unto you for
[1:45:29] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:45:31] of the Lord shall cometh as a thief in
[1:45:33] the night
[1:45:35] for when they shall say peace and safety
[1:45:38] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:45:40] as travail with a woman with child and
[1:45:43] they shall not Escape now personally I
[1:45:45] believe this sudden destruction is the
[1:45:47] second half of the tribulation period
[1:45:49] okay that's what I believe because
[1:45:51] they'll have they'll have peace and
[1:45:53] safety for the first three and a half
[1:45:54] years
[1:45:55] right because they have a Israel has a
[1:45:56] peace Covenant for seven years
[1:46:00] now of course the the two prophets will
[1:46:02] be doing certain torments during that
[1:46:04] time but it's not like sudden
[1:46:06] destruction
[1:46:07] right like we read about with the seven
[1:46:09] trumpets and the Seven vows
[1:46:11] so they're the so we're we know we don't
[1:46:13] have need of anybody to tell us the time
[1:46:15] and season because we know Jesus coming
[1:46:17] like a thief in the night
[1:46:20] Hallelujah
[1:46:22] verse four but ye Brethren are not in
[1:46:24] darkness that ye should be overtake but
[1:46:26] that day should overtake you as a thief
[1:46:28] we're not going to be surprised when the
[1:46:30] Rapture comes we're going to recognize
[1:46:31] the Rapture is coming very soon praise
[1:46:33] God
[1:46:36] you're all children of the light and
[1:46:38] Children of the day we are not the of
[1:46:40] the night nor the darkness therefore let
[1:46:42] us sleep as let us not sleep as others
[1:46:45] do but let us watch and be sober for
[1:46:47] they that sleep sleep in the night and
[1:46:48] they that be drunk and be drunk in the
[1:46:50] night but let us who are of the day be
[1:46:52] sober putting on the breastplate of Love
[1:46:54] of faith and love and for an helmet the
[1:46:56] hope of salvation for God hath not
[1:46:58] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[1:47:00] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ ah
[1:47:05] thank God Amen
[1:47:10] see Church
[1:47:12] the Bible said sudden destruction it's
[1:47:13] unexpected
[1:47:15] what this moment people are expecting a
[1:47:17] Russian nuclear bomb to strike they're
[1:47:20] expecting that that wouldn't be
[1:47:21] unexpected destruction
[1:47:23] it'd be expected remember I remember
[1:47:25] Biden was talking about a few weeks ago
[1:47:27] he said we're closer to Armageddon than
[1:47:28] we ever have been before
[1:47:31] that guy
[1:47:33] and see that would be expected but the
[1:47:36] Bible says it's unexpected the world is
[1:47:38] going to think peace the world is going
[1:47:39] to think safety and then sudden
[1:47:41] destruction comes on them
[1:47:46] now
[1:47:49] see they're expecting destruction
[1:47:51] because all the talk about Vladimir
[1:47:52] Putin
[1:47:55] but what I found was both groups that
[1:47:58] call themselves the greatest of all time
[1:48:00] both of them are saying that this is
[1:48:03] like the last war and uh the the Rapture
[1:48:06] is any moment now
[1:48:09] and I'm going to read some of their
[1:48:10] exact quotes I got their names here but
[1:48:12] I'm not I can't I'm not going to put
[1:48:13] them up there I thought I could do I
[1:48:15] just I didn't think our camera was good
[1:48:16] enough to catch all the details on the
[1:48:17] screen
[1:48:18] it is
[1:48:20] I'll have to go back and watch that
[1:48:22] that's the case I might be in some
[1:48:23] trouble pretty soon here things I've
[1:48:26] shown in the past
[1:48:27] the first preacher said back in March so
[1:48:30] this was over 220 days ago when the war
[1:48:33] first started one preacher said in a few
[1:48:34] days this ball brother will have a head
[1:48:37] full of hair because he said you stay
[1:48:39] around and the Rapture happens you look
[1:48:41] over and say I remember the service
[1:48:43] when this preacher said you're going to
[1:48:45] have a head full of hair in other words
[1:48:46] they'll get a new body
[1:48:47] and this bald guy will have his hair
[1:48:49] back
[1:48:50] that was over 220 years ago a message
[1:48:53] preacher said the rapture's so close
[1:48:55] this guy's going to have his hair he's
[1:48:57] got is this bald guy is going to have
[1:48:59] all his hair back in a few days well
[1:49:01] here we are Church what does a few days
[1:49:02] mean
[1:49:05] two weeks later the same preacher says
[1:49:07] this we're just hours before the Rapture
[1:49:10] and we're believing we're getting ready
[1:49:11] to step over he said hours it has been
[1:49:13] over five thousand forty hours since he
[1:49:16] said that he said we're just a few hours
[1:49:19] because of the Russian war
[1:49:22] see and I've been hearing those these
[1:49:24] last eight months I'm just waiting on
[1:49:26] I'm praying I'm fasting brother like I'm
[1:49:28] just saying God give me a Revival I want
[1:49:29] to be ready
[1:49:30] these prominent men that
[1:49:32] have great Mega charges
[1:49:35] saying any day now any hour now here we
[1:49:38] are
[1:49:42] and I'm not predicting the Rapture but
[1:49:43] they are they're the ones predicting the
[1:49:45] rapture
[1:49:45] in a few days in a few hours
[1:49:52] here's another brother he said by
[1:49:54] tomorrow morning we could wake up in a
[1:49:55] totally different world than we're
[1:49:56] living tonight
[1:49:58] the world will move into a global One
[1:50:01] World Government in such a fast pace it
[1:50:03] will take them a snap of the finger
[1:50:06] so this brother is he's basically saying
[1:50:08] the same thing I found other quotes from
[1:50:09] this different brother he's basically
[1:50:11] saying the same thing this Russian war
[1:50:13] the nukes could drop and we could wake
[1:50:15] up in the morning and and there'd be
[1:50:17] craters all over the all over the
[1:50:18] America
[1:50:19] and the government would change would be
[1:50:21] one world government that fast
[1:50:23] now what's interesting is that I'm going
[1:50:25] to show another brother's quote and
[1:50:27] these brothers are both saying the same
[1:50:28] thing like this Rapture is any moment
[1:50:30] and yet they're both building brand new
[1:50:32] big churches
[1:50:34] if you really thought the Rapture was
[1:50:36] next week would you be putting millions
[1:50:37] of dollars into a building
[1:50:39] if you really thought the Rapture was in
[1:50:41] a few days see church this proves that
[1:50:43] by their fruits they are known Amen
[1:50:45] Hallelujah by their fruits they're known
[1:50:47] praise God
[1:50:49] if I thought the Rapture was tomorrow I
[1:50:51] wouldn't be go building something out
[1:50:52] there that's going to be burned up the
[1:50:54] next day in the Rapture or like with the
[1:50:55] with a nuclear bomb or something
[1:50:57] I'd be calling on my friends like
[1:50:59] brother did you know that sister get
[1:51:00] ready by God's grace call your family
[1:51:03] see their Works their Works show that
[1:51:06] they don't even believe what they're
[1:51:07] saying
[1:51:08] millions of dollars
[1:51:12] they're putting that on the people
[1:51:14] but by tomorrow could be different by
[1:51:16] tomorrow just a few hours just a few
[1:51:18] days left
[1:51:21] brother Brown said that brother Brown
[1:51:23] said he said you Assemblies of God
[1:51:25] you're putting six million dollar
[1:51:26] buildings and say Jesus coming right
[1:51:28] away your Works prove that you don't
[1:51:30] believe that
[1:51:31] brother Adam said that 40 60 62 years
[1:51:35] ago
[1:51:36] anybody that says I believe in Jesus
[1:51:38] coming soon and building six million
[1:51:40] dollar buildings you don't believe that
[1:51:43] if you believed it you'd be taking that
[1:51:45] money and send preachers out get saved
[1:51:47] and in this quote he says you would give
[1:51:49] those poor people food you'd put shoes
[1:51:52] on the preacher's feet that don't have
[1:51:54] shoes
[1:51:56] and the church said
[1:51:59] see by their fruits they're known let me
[1:52:03] say this by your fruit you're you're
[1:52:04] known too praise God
[1:52:06] because you have love like that song
[1:52:07] Love goodness kindness self-control
[1:52:10] thank God Amen you are known by your
[1:52:14] fruits as well praise God
[1:52:16] what are you putting your money into
[1:52:19] and the church said I'm going to preach
[1:52:21] on Monday again by God's grace
[1:52:25] what are we putting our money into I'm
[1:52:26] trying to get out of debt that's what
[1:52:27] I'm trying to do
[1:52:28] because I think we might have more time
[1:52:30] I think I feel like I'm gonna have my
[1:52:31] whole life here unless God shows me
[1:52:32] different because everybody else has had
[1:52:34] their whole life and died and gone on
[1:52:35] too
[1:52:36] so I don't know
[1:52:38] someone live my life like that
[1:52:40] because I don't know anybody says they
[1:52:42] know they're probably lying
[1:52:49] this other the third preacher said when
[1:52:50] death is hanging so close it could be in
[1:52:52] one hour this preacher said it last
[1:52:54] Sunday he said this look what Russia is
[1:52:56] claiming we're closer to nuclear
[1:52:58] destruction than we've ever been
[1:53:00] now that church that's it's true in one
[1:53:03] sense
[1:53:04] right we're closer to the end than we've
[1:53:05] ever been that's true
[1:53:07] but they're putting this pressure on
[1:53:08] there like the raptures any day now any
[1:53:11] hour now and this guy just built a brand
[1:53:12] new church a few years ago
[1:53:14] isn't that interesting three out of
[1:53:16] these four
[1:53:17] built brand new churches in the last few
[1:53:19] years because they're so popular which
[1:53:21] is it's fine it's fine I'm not jealous
[1:53:23] of that I'd say praise God God bless you
[1:53:25] stay with the word that's what I'd say
[1:53:28] I'm happy for you
[1:53:30] praise God
[1:53:32] but let's not try to predict the rapture
[1:53:35] let's not let's not say it's only hours
[1:53:37] away well here we are 2 000 hours later
[1:53:39] or five thousand hours later and
[1:53:40] nothing's happened
[1:53:45] they've said a lot more than that church
[1:53:46] but I I that's that's what I was able to
[1:53:48] find quickly now I'm going to always
[1:53:50] call this name because I email this guy
[1:53:52] all the time Joe Sabrina
[1:53:54] Joseph Branham back in March said the
[1:53:56] scriptures are being fulfilled faster
[1:53:57] than we can read all that's happening
[1:54:02] and uh he said
[1:54:05] the thought that the Cold War was over
[1:54:07] there's no more threat of nuclear war
[1:54:08] but today the threat
[1:54:10] of nuclear war has become a reality here
[1:54:12] yeah we cannot plug it back in because
[1:54:13] I'm done with those other names so you
[1:54:15] can I don't care if Joseph Branham sees
[1:54:16] it I love him and we've had public
[1:54:18] discussions already so
[1:54:20] um I don't care about that and I emailed
[1:54:22] him yesterday I emailed him almost every
[1:54:23] week every Saturday he puts out a new
[1:54:25] blog post every Saturday it's got lies
[1:54:27] in it so almost every Saturday I say
[1:54:28] brother I love you but you're wrong you
[1:54:30] need to repent
[1:54:36] here's what he said uh back in March we
[1:54:39] praise the Lord for God called men that
[1:54:41] preach the word but ministers place that
[1:54:42] voice that you and your people are going
[1:54:44] to be judged by first in other words let
[1:54:46] brother Adam preach and not you you step
[1:54:47] down and put that voice first I'm sorry
[1:54:50] God never asked dead men to lead a
[1:54:51] Living Church
[1:54:53] there's not one example in the Bible
[1:54:55] where a dead man leaves leads living men
[1:54:58] Hallelujah
[1:55:00] oh yeah we love you but just you know
[1:55:02] change the word a little bit to fit our
[1:55:04] interpretation no sir I ain't taking
[1:55:06] your interpretation I'm taking God's
[1:55:07] word
[1:55:09] praise God
[1:55:10] and here's what I emailed him yesterday
[1:55:11] I said brother I said
[1:55:14] if I ought to listen to your your advice
[1:55:17] uh eight months ago
[1:55:19] I'd still be I would have been
[1:55:21] neglecting my preaching Minister my
[1:55:23] preaching gift for over eight months
[1:55:25] and the Bible says neglect not this I
[1:55:28] was preaching last week and I'll be in
[1:55:29] the struck me I was like Glory there it
[1:55:30] is
[1:55:32] he's the devil's trying to get me to
[1:55:33] stop preaching the devil's trying to get
[1:55:35] preachers to neglect their gifts but
[1:55:37] that's not their gift that's God's Gift
[1:55:39] amen
[1:55:40] and God gave those preachers the gifts
[1:55:42] to feed the people to bless the people
[1:55:45] to keep them on the straight and narrow
[1:55:46] to tell them the truth and to preach
[1:55:48] God's word hallelujah
[1:55:50] living men not dead men
[1:55:54] I said I just emailed them yesterday I
[1:55:56] said brother I'm not going to neglect a
[1:55:57] gift that's in me
[1:55:58] if I listen to you I would have been
[1:56:00] guilty of neglect Church look at it he's
[1:56:02] trying to get us to be those the man
[1:56:04] with the one talent and bury it in the
[1:56:05] Earth
[1:56:07] see that spirit
[1:56:09] that's not the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:56:11] Unholy spirit
[1:56:12] bury your gift in the ground and just
[1:56:14] neglect it and let brother random do all
[1:56:16] the work brother man can't do any more
[1:56:17] work
[1:56:18] his work is over
[1:56:21] can you imagine if we went into a
[1:56:22] Lutheran church today brother Benjamin
[1:56:25] and the pastor got up and said
[1:56:27] well we're happy to be here today we're
[1:56:29] in our pastor Martin Luther preached to
[1:56:32] us today and sit down and play uh
[1:56:34] somebody's voice read a Martin Luther's
[1:56:36] sermons what would you think of that
[1:56:39] you think these people are insane
[1:56:41] well that's what these people are in
[1:56:42] Jeffersonville they're insane
[1:56:46] Martin Luther is my pastor John Wesley
[1:56:48] is my pastor brother Rand is my pastor
[1:56:50] no you got a pastor in Akron that's me
[1:56:53] you can have it you can your choice it's
[1:56:54] your choice you can have any Pastor you
[1:56:56] want praise God you got any past you
[1:56:58] want but ain't a dead person it's a
[1:56:59] living man praise God
[1:57:05] no Brother Joseph and Jeffersonville I
[1:57:07] will not neglect the gift that God has
[1:57:09] placed in my life
[1:57:10] I'll be faithful to the gift praise God
[1:57:12] because I'm going to bring forth Jesus
[1:57:13] say Jesus you gave me one gift here's
[1:57:15] two I I doubled it by God's grace by
[1:57:18] your help Hallelujah
[1:57:20] see that's why I told him I said we are
[1:57:23] given the five preaching gifts until we
[1:57:25] get unified in the faith we're not there
[1:57:27] yet so we still need preachers to get us
[1:57:29] there praise God it's a smaller group
[1:57:31] all the time fewer fewer people but the
[1:57:33] true five-fold Ministry is going to get
[1:57:35] us there by the grace of God
[1:57:37] amen hallelujah
[1:57:40] okay again a few months ago he talked
[1:57:42] about Russia the call yeah Russia
[1:57:44] nuclear Wars reality he said the season
[1:57:46] here what is the season now is the time
[1:57:48] now see they're saying now's the Rapture
[1:57:50] now's the Rapture if these guys are
[1:57:51] saying the Rapture is now it makes me
[1:57:53] think the Rapture is not now
[1:57:56] because they're so far off on tapes
[1:57:58] they're so far off on their Doctrine
[1:58:00] they have all these false teachings how
[1:58:02] can they
[1:58:04] know the raptures very soon if they
[1:58:06] don't even have the basic Foundation
[1:58:07] doctrines right how can they be right on
[1:58:09] that so it makes me think they're not
[1:58:11] even right
[1:58:13] it makes me think the opposite
[1:58:15] that God's gonna let them live on and
[1:58:17] then just die a natural death and then
[1:58:19] move on that's what it makes me think
[1:58:23] now here's the first reason I think
[1:58:24] preachers think Russia might bomb the
[1:58:26] USA
[1:58:28] because there are 11 quotes like this
[1:58:30] now remember this is during that nuclear
[1:58:32] scare of the 1950s 60s right
[1:58:36] I talked to a teacher friend the other
[1:58:37] day and she remembers being in school
[1:58:39] where they had the uh the drills for
[1:58:41] nuclear bombing you had to crawl under
[1:58:43] your desk like like a desk is going to
[1:58:45] protect you from radiation right
[1:58:47] that's what they did in the 1960s right
[1:58:49] 70s nuclear like today we have fire
[1:58:51] drills they have new they used to have
[1:58:53] nuclear bomb drills oh get under the
[1:58:55] desk it's going to protect you the desk
[1:58:56] ain't going to do nothing for you
[1:58:59] but they just wanted to do something to
[1:59:00] feel like they were prepared
[1:59:02] but remember said I don't care what
[1:59:03] takes place if you said the Russians is
[1:59:05] fixing to pull the trigger this minute
[1:59:06] they're sending an atomic bomb a real
[1:59:08] born again Christian has Eternal place
[1:59:09] or Eternal peace in his heart there's
[1:59:12] nothing can harm him let the bullet fire
[1:59:14] why the smoke won't be scattered out
[1:59:15] across the street here until we would be
[1:59:18] in glory with Jesus standing there
[1:59:21] Immortal in his likeness never to be
[1:59:23] sick never to have a heartache never to
[1:59:25] have a disappointment praise God
[1:59:29] so this is why I think preachers think
[1:59:31] this because there's numerous quotes
[1:59:33] like this but I challenge any of them
[1:59:35] show me where any of those quotes are
[1:59:37] thus saith the Lord
[1:59:39] that's my challenge to them now let's
[1:59:40] see if they come up and meet my
[1:59:42] challenge my guess is they won't
[1:59:44] because they don't meet the other
[1:59:45] challenges
[1:59:47] brother I was talking to a world that's
[1:59:49] caught up in nuclear war right so he's
[1:59:50] giving them just this confidence no
[1:59:52] matter what happens you'll be with Jesus
[1:59:56] yeah there's 11 like this I could I
[1:59:57] could show a lot more but I love this
[1:59:59] and brother Adam says let me tell you he
[2:00:01] said there's no Hiding Place don't build
[2:00:02] a bomb shelter he said there is a bomb
[2:00:04] shelter it's made out of feathers it's
[2:00:06] under Jehovah ego praise God I just
[2:00:09] think that's a beautiful one Hallelujah
[2:00:12] hide under the shelter of almighty God
[2:00:15] how many hiding there today praise God
[2:00:17] that's where I'm hiding like I said I
[2:00:19] don't care if a bomb comes or not I'm a
[2:00:21] Jesus when it's all what's all said and
[2:00:22] done I'm with Jesus
[2:00:26] a second news did you hear this news
[2:00:28] about Israel they had five red heifers
[2:00:30] delivered to Israel last month do you
[2:00:32] hear that
[2:00:33] from Texas
[2:00:36] and so these preachers are saying see
[2:00:37] the Gentiles are helping out the Jews
[2:00:39] because the gospel first went from the
[2:00:41] Jews to the Gentiles Maybe
[2:00:43] maybe I don't know remember they have to
[2:00:46] have red Hepper heifers to have the
[2:00:48] Waters of Separation they can't even
[2:00:50] have a temple service until they have
[2:00:52] Waters of Separation to sprinkle all the
[2:00:54] people to sprinkle the outer core inner
[2:00:56] core holiest of holies and they don't
[2:00:57] have any red heifers in Israel right now
[2:00:59] but they just got five from Texas
[2:01:02] so that's why now this is a pretty good
[2:01:04] website if you want to go there there's
[2:01:05] a group called The Temple Institute
[2:01:07] they got videos I was watching yesterday
[2:01:09] and here I was studying
[2:01:11] they have all these women making uh all
[2:01:14] the gold that goes on all the garments
[2:01:17] of the priests
[2:01:18] they're dying the wool
[2:01:20] in in the in the in this insects that
[2:01:23] turn it red just like the Bible says in
[2:01:25] other words all these directions that
[2:01:26] God gave Aaron all those years ago is
[2:01:29] now a it's 3 500 years ago these Jews
[2:01:32] are now being inspired to go make all
[2:01:34] the garments for the high priest and
[2:01:36] build all the furniture pieces they're
[2:01:38] pounding gold to make the Rings and all
[2:01:41] these things and they they pound the
[2:01:42] gold to make those pomegranates on the
[2:01:45] the high priest garments Church we're
[2:01:47] getting close we're getting ready but
[2:01:49] that's logical that's logic praise God
[2:01:51] but see what what but God won't turn to
[2:01:54] the Jews until he's done with us praise
[2:01:56] God
[2:01:57] and every nation has to hear this gospel
[2:02:00] and then Jesus said is the time of the
[2:02:02] end
[2:02:03] has every nation heard this gospel
[2:02:04] apparently not
[2:02:06] because Jesus said
[2:02:08] uh the Israel will be Tron down to the
[2:02:11] Gentiles until the fullness of the
[2:02:13] Gentiles become in there's more Gentiles
[2:02:16] to come into this truth more people are
[2:02:18] going to get saved amen
[2:02:20] whether it's our church or not I'm glad
[2:02:21] someone have come to our church in the
[2:02:22] last few years amen hallelujah like amen
[2:02:25] and hood and Austin and Lena praise God
[2:02:28] I'm glad we're getting some Souls praise
[2:02:29] God but there's more souls around the
[2:02:31] world that need to receive Jesus Christ
[2:02:33] as Lord and savior
[2:02:38] so here's a few reasons I'm almost done
[2:02:40] I think I only got a couple more
[2:02:43] yeah I'm almost done all right can you
[2:02:45] take a deep breath there I'm almost done
[2:02:46] here
[2:02:52] and I'll be happy to take your questions
[2:02:53] this evening by God's grace if we have a
[2:02:54] testimony that'd be great too if not
[2:02:56] it's okay
[2:02:57] but happy to take your questions this
[2:02:58] evening I I sure like your questions by
[2:03:00] God's grace
[2:03:01] now here's what I don't think this is
[2:03:03] the the last war like we're like nuclear
[2:03:05] war is going to happen like any moment
[2:03:09] brother man told us in the pick up your
[2:03:12] pen and right which he said the Holy
[2:03:13] Spirit told him to write
[2:03:16] but the man said the bride will be
[2:03:19] forced to stop preaching and ministering
[2:03:21] to those that need ministering
[2:03:27] so like that's why that's why they're
[2:03:28] saying like it doesn't make any sense if
[2:03:30] they're saying oh the bomb could be any
[2:03:31] day or any moment well when is
[2:03:34] when is the government ruling going to
[2:03:35] come down we can't have church anymore
[2:03:38] so you can't be a preacher unless you're
[2:03:40] in our organization when is that going
[2:03:41] to come down if the bombs are going to
[2:03:42] if we're going to look out over America
[2:03:44] and it's only going to be craters
[2:03:45] brother Bang
[2:03:46] and then how is that going to allow if
[2:03:49] there's only craters All Over America
[2:03:50] how they can have a government to tell
[2:03:52] us to not preach do you see how this
[2:03:54] doesn't make any sense
[2:03:55] everybody see that
[2:03:57] we've got to have the government tell
[2:03:58] the preachers to stop preaching to
[2:04:00] fulfill Revelation 13 16. got your Bible
[2:04:02] Revelation 13 16. this is what brother
[2:04:05] man tells us
[2:04:08] Revelation 13 16 and he callseth all
[2:04:12] both small and great rich and poor free
[2:04:14] and bond to receive a mark in their
[2:04:15] right hand
[2:04:16] and their foreheads
[2:04:20] so this is the actual moment when the
[2:04:22] Mark is laid down
[2:04:24] so brother Graham uses this scripture
[2:04:25] Revelation 13 16 to show that the bride
[2:04:28] will be forced to stop preaching but
[2:04:31] before the mark can be laid down Jesus
[2:04:33] will take his wife off the Earth because
[2:04:35] she's kept the word of his patience so
[2:04:37] Jesus says I'll keep you from the hour
[2:04:39] of Temptation that will come upon the
[2:04:41] whole earth praise God
[2:04:43] that's what road ram taught us
[2:04:45] that's why I want to hear these
[2:04:46] preachers I'm like this doesn't sound
[2:04:47] like brother Branham this sounds just
[2:04:48] like something they made up
[2:04:53] I mean they could change overnight like
[2:04:55] I said but they'd be so cruel I feel
[2:04:57] like we we I feel like God will prepare
[2:05:00] us I feel like God is merciful I feel
[2:05:03] like God will prepare us like we'll see
[2:05:04] the slow changes we'll see the slow
[2:05:06] birth pains getting harder and harder
[2:05:08] and harder where we'll see okay now the
[2:05:10] government is going to get close to his
[2:05:12] heart killing Christians that's what I
[2:05:14] feel like
[2:05:15] because that's what I've seen in my life
[2:05:18] like I told you just 20 years ago when I
[2:05:20] was in high school Bill Clinton signed a
[2:05:22] law saying there can be no homosexual
[2:05:24] marriage and everybody rejoiced
[2:05:26] fast forward 15 years Barack Obama is so
[2:05:29] happy he lights up the White House and
[2:05:31] the gay the gay rainbow which they stole
[2:05:33] from God
[2:05:34] but God's going to get that back praise
[2:05:36] God
[2:05:37] they won't have it very long God's gonna
[2:05:39] get that rainbow back
[2:05:40] Hallelujah
[2:05:42] in fact they never could take it from
[2:05:43] God if you look at all the reality of it
[2:05:47] so I believe these wars are just more
[2:05:50] birth pains they got to get more intense
[2:05:52] I believe it's not as severe
[2:05:55] yet as it's going to be because the
[2:05:57] government will be licensed to kill
[2:05:59] anyone who defies their their laws their
[2:06:03] new laws but Ram said Remember the
[2:06:05] church WIll Unite with the state the the
[2:06:07] government of America will Unite with
[2:06:09] the churches and they'll influence them
[2:06:10] to change the laws to shut down our
[2:06:12] churches that's what brother Ram said
[2:06:16] and it hasn't happened yet it's not even
[2:06:18] close yet to that
[2:06:20] all right number two um I kind of hit on
[2:06:23] this earlier
[2:06:26] uh these are just my notes I didn't get
[2:06:27] to actually finish this part here
[2:06:30] yeah fire
[2:06:31] atomic fire was spoken of in Revelation
[2:06:33] 13 13. what should be done
[2:06:35] if you ever wonder where's America in
[2:06:37] the Bible Revelation chapter 13.
[2:06:41] he doeth great Wonders that he'd make a
[2:06:43] fire come down from heaven on Earth in
[2:06:45] the sight of men that was Nagasaki and
[2:06:48] Hiroshima from 1945.
[2:06:51] okay but I can't find fire really
[2:06:54] mentioned again until after the Rapture
[2:06:58] so see preachers are making it sound
[2:06:59] like there's a atomic bomb right right
[2:07:02] at the moment right before the Rapture
[2:07:03] right a moment after the Rapture but we
[2:07:06] don't see that we don't see it till the
[2:07:07] second half of the Great Tribulation
[2:07:09] period if you search the scriptures
[2:07:12] in other words they have no scripture
[2:07:13] for saying the Rapture goes up as the
[2:07:16] atomic bomb comes down they have no
[2:07:18] scripture for that there's none
[2:07:20] there's none
[2:07:22] and all the other ones church and I I'll
[2:07:24] have to maybe preach a part too all the
[2:07:26] other fire in the tribulation is By
[2:07:28] Angels
[2:07:30] not by beasts
[2:07:32] this is the the Beast out of the earth
[2:07:33] is the United States the beasts out of
[2:07:35] the land that's the one that sends on
[2:07:36] the fire that was America
[2:07:38] but there's no other fire from Beasts
[2:07:40] it's always fire from angels
[2:07:45] all right
[2:07:48] and so to me the the next fire would be
[2:07:51] sometime after the 144 000 are sealed
[2:07:53] the next atomic
[2:07:55] attack would be sometime after the 144
[2:07:58] 000 are sealed now I'm not saying I'm
[2:08:00] right I'm just saying I'm just trying uh
[2:08:01] by the by the best I can do by the Bible
[2:08:03] I when is the next fire I can find it's
[2:08:05] the second half of Daniel's 70th week
[2:08:08] I have to do a new chart on that to kind
[2:08:10] of teach you guys through that by the
[2:08:11] grace of the Lord
[2:08:13] reason three I don't feel like this is
[2:08:15] the squeeze so I better get off that one
[2:08:16] here I got a name on there uh
[2:08:19] a preacher last week the same preacher
[2:08:21] who said uh the Rapture could be any
[2:08:24] moment or any day and the atomic war he
[2:08:27] said the squeeze is not natural it's
[2:08:29] only spiritual
[2:08:31] in other words they're not going to shut
[2:08:32] our church doors they're just going to
[2:08:33] spiritually try to
[2:08:36] intimidate us or something I don't know
[2:08:38] Brother Brad said it's a literal they're
[2:08:40] going to close our doors and they're
[2:08:41] going to they're going to boycott real
[2:08:42] Christians
[2:08:44] program said the bride will be forced to
[2:08:45] stop preaching publicly right
[2:08:48] that's what Ram said
[2:08:49] he said but we'll still have a church he
[2:08:51] said Hallelujah
[2:08:53] and also I wrote on there
[2:08:55] um
[2:08:57] you know we're having inflation this
[2:08:58] inflation's awful now church but my dad
[2:09:00] told me in 1973 he had to wait in line
[2:09:03] to get gas now how many of you had to
[2:09:04] wait in line to get gas because we're on
[2:09:05] a ration
[2:09:07] inflation was awful the the peak of
[2:09:10] inflation was when I was one year old in
[2:09:11] 1981 that was a peak of of inflation in
[2:09:14] America when I was one year old back in
[2:09:16] 1981. well now we've gone beyond that
[2:09:18] now we've reached a new level of
[2:09:19] inflation but have we ever reached a
[2:09:21] point like this
[2:09:23] no gas ask Biden for some uh Biden can
[2:09:27] you lower the prices no it can't
[2:09:29] right you can't do it
[2:09:31] Church you had to wait in line like this
[2:09:32] just to get gas
[2:09:34] when I was in Guyana that's how it was
[2:09:36] in Guyana because Guyana is a communist
[2:09:38] country it's a corrupt country
[2:09:41] that's how it was in Guyana
[2:09:43] just 10 years ago
[2:09:45] you ever seen this before
[2:09:47] my dad used to do this he had to wait in
[2:09:49] line to get carved or gas for his cars
[2:09:51] lawnmower everything
[2:09:53] because gas was rationed it was so such
[2:09:56] a shortage
[2:09:59] and this affected everybody's jobs I
[2:10:01] mean it just shut down the economy it
[2:10:02] was just it was awful
[2:10:07] and again the Russia Ukraine war just
[2:10:09] seems to be another birth pain like
[2:10:11] Jesus spoke about as I read earlier he's
[2:10:13] already done this is his fourth War
[2:10:16] I don't believe this is the last war
[2:10:18] before the Rapture I don't know though I
[2:10:19] don't know
[2:10:20] also all I know is that people that say
[2:10:23] they're the greatest of all time are
[2:10:24] making this claim and I think they're
[2:10:26] wrong that's my personal opinion I think
[2:10:28] they're wrong
[2:10:32] now Church These are also the same
[2:10:34] people that said brother random
[2:10:35] prophesied to the coronavirus you ever
[2:10:37] see those videos on YouTube one of
[2:10:39] them's got 300 000 views brother Brown
[2:10:41] never prophesied to the coveted coveted
[2:10:44] the kova disease or anything like that
[2:10:47] but the same people that they're trying
[2:10:49] to read in the quotes and make it look
[2:10:50] like it's a prophecy the same people
[2:10:52] that say that are the same ones who say
[2:10:54] they're the greatest of all time
[2:10:56] who are saying this this war is a last
[2:10:58] war and so see church I'm seeing that's
[2:11:00] what I was telling cam a few weeks ago
[2:11:01] red flag red flag red flag right when I
[2:11:04] see all these red flags it tells me
[2:11:06] something's wrong with these people
[2:11:08] they're trying to be prophets they're
[2:11:09] trying to make themselves more spiritual
[2:11:10] they are actually exalting themselves as
[2:11:13] the greatest of all time
[2:11:21] and the fourth reason Church Sinners
[2:11:23] don't want to die do you think Putin
[2:11:24] wants to really start a nuclear war do
[2:11:26] you really think that
[2:11:27] when
[2:11:29] this is the only life they have no
[2:11:31] Eternal hope they don't want to die
[2:11:34] church we got technology if they shoot
[2:11:35] off a missile guess what we can shoot
[2:11:37] off one too what about our allies in the
[2:11:39] UK
[2:11:40] they can shoot off missiles as soon as
[2:11:41] they see one go they can shoot them off
[2:11:44] you think they really want to die and
[2:11:45] start a nuclear war I don't think so
[2:11:48] I don't see it in the scripture before
[2:11:50] the rapture
[2:11:52] but again I'm not saying I'm right I'm
[2:11:54] just saying I'm going back to the
[2:11:55] scripture I'm trying to point all of us
[2:11:56] to the word of God
[2:11:58] does that make sense by God's grace
[2:12:00] praise God
[2:12:02] so remember I just closed with this
[2:12:04] brother gave us two quotes don't worry
[2:12:05] about Russia
[2:12:06] men are thinking the Antichrist being
[2:12:08] Russia get out of your minds the
[2:12:09] Antichrist is religious
[2:12:11] Jesus said the two spirits will be so
[2:12:13] close and deceive the very elective were
[2:12:15] possible don't worry about Russia
[2:12:17] they're just a bunch of atheists but the
[2:12:19] Antichrist sets right by you that's the
[2:12:21] deceiver now think about that
[2:12:23] the Antichrist is right or among message
[2:12:25] churches
[2:12:27] praise God you can't mention that last
[2:12:29] week I don't know if you did or not
[2:12:32] that's the one you really got to watch
[2:12:33] for yeah we got to watch Russia but he
[2:12:36] said watch more closely that
[2:12:37] denominational Spirit that's trying to
[2:12:39] get into the church
[2:12:41] cool you down take away your Revival
[2:12:44] right take away your love for God take
[2:12:46] away your heart for Jesus the sincerity
[2:12:48] that you have for Jesus Christ that's an
[2:12:50] antichrist Spirit trying to take us away
[2:12:51] from the real love of God
[2:12:54] see don't worry about Russia Russia is a
[2:12:56] small pebble on the beach
[2:12:58] and yet all these preachers are saying
[2:12:59] oh it's nuclear war time Putin is going
[2:13:02] to send a nuclear war Putin's going to
[2:13:04] sell all these nuclear warheads
[2:13:07] don't you worry about communism brother
[2:13:09] Brown says you watch romanism when it's
[2:13:11] uniting with the churches there's
[2:13:13] nothing written in the scripture about
[2:13:14] communism ruling the world
[2:13:17] and I go by the word regardless of what
[2:13:19] anybody else goes it's the word I
[2:13:21] believe how do I could say that brother
[2:13:22] Jesse it's the word I believe
[2:13:25] it's romanism that takes the world and
[2:13:28] romanism is the mother of organization
[2:13:30] now stand to our feet musicians can come
[2:13:32] that's my stuff I made through all my
[2:13:34] notes praise God all right hour is that
[2:13:37] two hours
[2:13:39] almost two hours hour 45 there by God's
[2:13:41] grace you've been a good Audience by
[2:13:43] God's grace and look you're still
[2:13:44] smiling so you love me I love you too
[2:13:46] church I love you too I just had to get
[2:13:48] this out is that okay by God's grace I
[2:13:50] just had to get it out and uh once you
[2:13:52] once yeah tonight I can go over some of
[2:13:53] those names if you want to know some of
[2:13:55] the names of the preachers but you
[2:13:55] probably won't be surprised
[2:13:59] Church how many want to be ready for the
[2:14:01] coming of the Lord
[2:14:02] it's the greatest desire of My Heart
[2:14:04] Church These you know when I've heard
[2:14:05] these preachers say this it shakes me to
[2:14:06] my very being like it makes me nervous
[2:14:09] and I just I just want to be ready
[2:14:10] brother Bank I've given my whole life to
[2:14:12] Jesus Christ I don't want to miss his
[2:14:13] coming
[2:14:15] but then the holy spirit will kind of
[2:14:16] say to my heart what does the Bible say
[2:14:18] there's going to be a
[2:14:20] a nuclear bomb right right after the
[2:14:22] rash at the time of the Rapture is there
[2:14:23] a nuclear bomb
[2:14:24] I don't think so
[2:14:27] I don't think so
[2:14:28] and church as you know I'm always open
[2:14:30] to correction how many no I'm open to
[2:14:31] correction
[2:14:32] okay I got some nods Eric
[2:14:34] I want to be right
[2:14:35] but I finding all these quotes all these
[2:14:38] scriptures this is the best I can
[2:14:39] understand as I told you I'm living my
[2:14:41] life like I'll get my whole life I don't
[2:14:43] know if I will
[2:14:45] but if my life ends up short I know who
[2:14:46] I'm going with I'm going with Jesus
[2:14:49] because I've given to my whole life
[2:14:51] I love Jesus Christ with all my heart
[2:14:53] soul mind and strength
[2:14:55] and I want him to be pleased with my
[2:14:56] life I don't want to bury my gift in the
[2:14:58] ground I want to use my gift for God's
