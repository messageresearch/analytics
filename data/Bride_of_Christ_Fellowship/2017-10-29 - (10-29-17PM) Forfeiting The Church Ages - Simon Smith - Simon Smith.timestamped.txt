[23:16] I'm with brother who crime against any
[23:25] other like to teach on forfeiting the
[23:26] seven search ages here Saint Paul the
[23:29] prophet of God is now picking up and eat
[23:33] many
[23:34] as such a burden of course people Lisa a
[23:38] Jew became how that stock of Benjamin
[23:41] he's as a Pharisee of Pharisees he went
[23:43] through his his physical resume if you
[23:46] will showing that he was pure breath he
[23:49] was one of the best he was had more zeal
[23:51] than all the rest of his peers and he
[23:54] was a real soldier for the Jewish
[23:56] religion he persecuted the Jews I'm
[23:59] sorry the Christians he persecuted many
[24:01] others but here he finds himself after
[24:03] now coming out of the old stagnant
[24:06] religion to dead religion he now finds
[24:09] himself in the new not a newer that
[24:11] you've got a further revelation of what
[24:14] he was he got a better school revelation
[24:17] what he was moving into and we seen
[24:19] first choices that I had found the great
[24:22] heaviness and continuous sorrow in my
[24:25] heart something down deep down Bernie to
[24:28] give him so great that he had to write
[24:30] it down and God allowing him to pen it
[24:32] down into the Holy Writ and to the
[24:34] Scriptures and we see in verse three he
[24:36] says for I wish for I could wish that
[24:38] myself were accursed from Christ for my
[24:42] brother he says my kids men according to
[24:44] the flesh he what he says I would rather
[24:48] have my name allowed into off the man's
[24:50] book of life he says so that all the
[24:53] rest of the Jews can be restored they
[24:55] may be what his people say all our
[24:59] sisters our brothers here we all have
[25:00] family members that are not saved and
[25:03] not ready this rapture our hearts our
[25:05] bodies our minds should be burdened and
[25:08] crying out to God Almighty to get us to
[25:10] that spot is almost right there yes as
[25:14] Moses stood in the gap for the short
[25:16] answer when they say he says blot out my
[25:18] name but God cities I'll do the blinding
[25:21] here up goes guys done he says I could
[25:24] not block you up he's already in the
[25:26] book second poll finds himself the same
[25:30] spot absolutely
[25:31] he was a real man of God never human God
[25:35] would have
[25:36] like a fire so that someone else could
[25:39] make it out of a mess Laurie that is
[25:41] what the spirit of sacrifice that what
[25:44] Jesus Christ did himself yes yes so true
[25:47] seen of God went to hell they went to
[25:50] paradise but he was the whole he was the
[25:52] true see what the heck first he went to
[25:59] hell and see what we didn't have to see
[26:02] yes glory hey sorry he's suffered ah yes
[26:05] thanks be to God for our Lord and Savior
[26:08] Jesus Christ
[26:09] yes glory now hearing is a nexus 4 verse
[26:13] 22 God is now revealing to Moses and to
[26:20] Pharaoh he says and also seen the
[26:22] Pharaoh thus saith the Lord Israel is my
[26:25] son he says even my first for the Israel
[26:30] came out of Abraham II was Abraham a Jew
[26:34] no no Abraham was a Gentile that's right
[26:40] her hand was a Gentile Isaac was a Jacob
[26:45] became Israel they changed and then was
[26:48] the nation born Church came out of that
[26:51] amen
[26:52] the twelve patriarchs made up the twelve
[26:54] tribes of Israel a man that's right but
[26:57] God says he says Israel is my firstborn
[27:01] yes so why would Paul be so
[27:04] brokenhearted Israel was the first boy
[27:08] they're supposed of the firstborn of my
[27:11] family all the welds that my parents
[27:14] have acquired up to the ears
[27:16] I guess gonna hear a lot but notice st.
[27:35] Paul here he goes back universe for
[27:38] Jesus who are the Israelites who to whom
[27:42] pertain the adoption and the glory and
[27:46] the causes and the giving
[27:47] in the service of God and the promises
[27:51] why because he realized his people the
[27:55] Jews missed out on everything they were
[27:59] supposed to reach the adoption they were
[28:01] supposed to have all prop by his stripes
[28:04] or Edom what is that you ever been
[28:07] healed to last few thousand years we
[28:10] take it for granted every time we get
[28:12] sick pastor please pray for me lay your
[28:14] hands just speak the word I believe and
[28:16] we get healed
[28:18] yes when is the Jews ever been any
[28:22] tougher Lessing Jesus Christ all of it
[28:25] for 2,000 years they miss the entire
[28:28] thing look look at the first fourth of
[28:32] the scripture how many miracles were
[28:34] done by people yes only through prophets
[28:39] majority yes
[28:41] how many miracles how many Beckles I've
[28:44] had my life got a verse ii staff all day
[28:46] from here till midnight I tell you every
[28:49] single miracle that God has done through
[28:51] my little tiny life yes sir
[28:53] I see how about you how are you the Jews
[28:55] don't have this they have to go back
[28:58] they have to bypass the last 2,000 years
[29:00] and then start working to the last how
[29:04] many people were sealed in the Old
[29:07] Testament
[29:08] how many miracles and signs outside of
[29:11] Moses and Elijah and no it Enoch and all
[29:14] those great men of faith Abraham the
[29:17] body changed all those Ezekiel scenes
[29:20] visions
[29:20] if you were not a prophet you hardly
[29:23] even and the Gentiles have benefited for
[29:34] 2,000 years on the panel
[29:43] Jesus Christ number it was a real
[29:45] revelations one that Jesus Christ was
[29:47] not at the table of shewbread he was
[29:51] found in the midst of the seven golden
[29:53] candlesticks lorries right and Paul she
[30:02] is the revelation that were paul was
[30:04] given and they know the revelation of
[30:06] the mystery of the gentiles he said that
[30:09] what came by revelation I received this
[30:11] then I would be a life sent to the
[30:13] Gentiles but then after you realize that
[30:16] he hasn't open his eyes to look back to
[30:19] his people and said they are not gonna
[30:21] profit in all from this everything that
[30:25] was promised them their entire life
[30:32] [Applause]
[30:41] nothing and Paul is now broken a heart
[30:46] yes yes the service of God they don't
[30:49] even serve God right right they can't
[30:54] even say they're in the will of God
[30:56] right the promises who are the fathers
[31:00] of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
[31:02] came Christ and just bypass them and
[31:04] just go to the Jew Gentiles he went to
[31:07] the Jews yes yes but of course in
[31:16] Galatians 3 this is Paul point okay yes
[31:21] okay yes sir Glacius 3/6 even as a raven
[31:26] and god it's time for righteousness know
[31:29] he therefore that they are returned to
[31:30] face the same of the children traitor
[31:31] hand he says and the scripture
[31:33] foreseeing that God would justify the
[31:35] heathen through faith preached before
[31:38] the gospel unto Abraham saying and all
[31:41] he indeed shall all nations be blessed
[31:43] so here's st. Paul he does he's a broken
[31:46] heart my people he said by in the
[31:48] scripture the spirit foresaw all the way
[31:52] from the beginning just like we showed
[31:54] this morning
[31:55] Ephesians 5 that Paul is able to pull
[31:57] the jet it out right all the way back
[32:00] from Genesis every time you see you
[32:07] saturday the Bible in the Old Testament
[32:09] I guarantee a typewriter with the Jets
[32:11] house a man absolutely beautiful you
[32:14] know he says the skirts were foreseeing
[32:16] that God would justify the heathen
[32:18] through faith yes saw souls 27 all the
[32:25] ends of the world so remember and turn
[32:26] unto the Lord he says and all ginger the
[32:29] nation shall worship before that's good
[32:32] that includes everybody it solves 86-90
[32:35] all nations who mousemaid shall come and
[32:38] worship before thee O Lord and shall
[32:40] glorify thy name
[32:41] all nations they may that's the Gentiles
[32:44] they met he says put our gray to do its
[32:46] wondrous things our God notice the
[32:48] Gentiles would the true Gentiles would
[32:50] understand God was one person even Hosea
[32:53] 2:23 Jesus I was so rude to get me in
[32:56] the earth and have mercy murder that's
[32:58] 19 mercy and I'll say to them which were
[33:01] not my people now are my people and they
[33:03] shall say that my god this is the
[33:05] Gentiles they prophesied all the way
[33:08] through scripture just some of the
[33:10] scriptures this was not something

[33:19] died he shed his blood he rose up send
[33:21] out a spirit holy go see one Paul I want
[33:23] the disciples you want everybody and
[33:25] they go back and tell the Jews look the
[33:27] Gentiles and they do still could not see

[33:31] right they were blown away look away
[33:33] Peter started preaching the holy ghost

[34:26] God showed up the logos fulfilling fires
[34:30] gonna pull the prophetess and now he's
[34:32] in the churches sure now in Matthew 3
[34:42] verse 1
[34:43] look at John the Baptist here John the
[34:46] Baptist he starts his ministry and he's
[34:49] preaching in the wilderness of Judea and
[34:51] look at his message in verse 2 he says
[34:52] repent for the kingdom of heaven that
[34:58] was the first message sent to what the
[35:01] Jews yeah absolutely
[35:04] just two more chapters we got on Jesus
[35:06] Christ in verse 12 now what Jesus heard
[35:09] that time was casting the print he
[35:11] departed into Galilee and look at verse
[35:13] 17 from that time Jesus began to preach
[35:16] you to say repent for the kingdom of
[35:18] heaven is at hand amen
[35:20] what is the kingdom of heaven a lot John
[35:23] preached it and when he was the prison
[35:25] Jesus Christ picked up the same baton
[35:27] there of the kingdom has started running
[35:29] they may be and they eat more Tempe on
[35:33] Jesus guests now with his twelve
[35:35] disciples in Matthew 10 percent and he
[35:38] said go ye and preach saying the kingdom
[35:39] of heaven is at hand amen
[35:41] - room time the Baptist Jesus to this
[35:43] club disciples and the same exact same
[35:46] message he said but the kingdom of
[35:48] heaven is at hand a man this is the time
[35:51] because this is what this is the calling
[35:55] of the Lord amen the kingdom is a hot
[35:57] ready to get set up
[35:58] amen sure Morgan now what is the kingdom
[36:01] Luke 17 20 and when he was demanded of
[36:04] the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
[36:06] sure come he answered says the kingdom
[36:07] of God come on now is our reservation
[36:11] [Applause]
[36:21] [Applause]
[36:23] Kingdom it's a spiritual Kingdom in
[36:27] boxes now what spiritual kings and
[36:30] priests what because Johnson I was in
[36:32] the kingdom as well right yeah now we've
[36:41] touched on this before about three years
[36:42] ago and then I touched on something I'm
[36:44] gonna come to RiRi just a little bit
[36:46] because I wanna get to my point
[36:48] Matthew 1310 president my favorite
[36:52] champion Matthew it contains 7 parables
[36:56] Jesus preached the first pair of
[37:00] perilous soul but now in verse 10 the
[37:04] what he says and the disciples came that
[37:06] why speakest now into parables verse 11
[37:10] he said the answers of them because it
[37:12] is given up to you to know the mysteries
[37:13] of the kingdom of heaven is not given so
[37:18] these are mysteries to what the kingdom
[37:21] of heaven not to Old Testament law not
[37:25] to the Jews but the Holy Ghost right
[37:30] John Lurie now picking up a piece church
[37:34] age chapter 3 and as of as we go into
[37:38] the seventh the seven parallel center
[37:40] the blood pair rule is very specific the
[37:43] Regent Terrace is one that caught my eye
[37:45] right away as soon as I heard it and the
[37:48] profit of the church's book justice done
[37:50] teaching original sin and he just got
[37:54] done teaching on Paris or wheat and now
[37:57] look we said these illustrations depict
[38:00] perfectly the parable of the Lord Jesus
[38:03] Christ when he said that the kingdom of
[38:05] heaven was liken unto man who sowed good
[38:07] seed only to have his enemy common plant
[38:11] tares amongst those good seeds yes he's
[38:15] typing this parable he says it depicts
[38:18] perfect illustration of the original
[38:21] state
[38:23] he's all the way back in Genesis 3 yes
[38:27] he says only to heaven and me come and
[38:30] play tears among the good sees God did
[38:32] not pay the tears Satan planted those
[38:34] stairs right amongst the good scene of
[38:37] God those two key kinds of plants he
[38:40] says people from you different seeds
[38:43] grew up together so he's dealing with
[38:44] original sin but his original sin in the
[38:49] troop changes that's right right now
[38:52] that was my mindset up until two years
[38:57] ago three years ago three years ago when
[39:00] I reread the church's book that was my
[39:03] mindset that it only though that that
[39:05] that parable only meant original sin
[39:08] right now we're not gonna go into a deep
[39:11] but we're just gonna get it but then
[39:13] when I stumbled upon this quote right
[39:15] here at the end and the resume of the
[39:17] church ages he says no please let us be
[39:20] careful here this message to the church
[39:22] was if the evidence is not the message
[39:24] to the local actual local if he's in
[39:26] church huh he says is a message to the
[39:29] aged and then he says something and and
[39:32] that age had it the seed of truth and
[39:36] the seed of error exactly a set forth
[39:40] according to the peril of the wheat and
[39:42] tares and then when I read this next
[39:46] statement I stood my foot he says the
[39:49] church ages is the know 7 parables are
[40:01] what parable mysteries for what the
[40:03] kingdom of God those are specifically
[40:05] about the Gentile those parables are
[40:15] also types in the Old Testament
[40:17] original sin yes the heart all those
[40:20] things are tight pull in betray well
[40:23] Jesse find that powerful quote on the
[40:25] mustard see tree oh my goodness I wonder
[40:28] what that was for years and they were
[40:29] Jess's all brother and it's always found
[40:32] in the church
[40:34] right I went down to a certain place a
[40:37] year and a half ago with my wife for
[40:39] vacation what to sit at the service the
[40:41] brothers preaching he says he went to
[40:42] write Matthew 13 he says oh yeah he says
[40:44] that that that mustard seed he said
[40:48] that's faith he came he was teaching
[40:50] that was fate right even though that
[40:54] wasn't even know that that was actually
[40:56] the false church that's right
[40:59] must be careful in these things yes sir
[41:02] so here now we know these things are
[41:04] what the church changes now how do they
[41:08] understand now Matthew 13 right at the
[41:10] end of the seven Church ages all the
[41:12] parables I'm sorry at the seven parables
[41:14] Matthew 13 Jesus asked them Jesus whom
[41:17] have you understood all these things
[41:20] they said to him Yale or do you really
[41:24] think they understood or did they now
[41:30] here in Matthew 13 it says they said yes
[41:33] we understood how could they say that
[41:36] well it's recorded in mark and with many
[41:39] such parables Spanky the word unto Him
[41:42] as they were able to hear it with what
[41:44] I'll apparently speak out unto and when
[41:46] they were alone he expounded all things
[41:49] to his man they said yeah we understand
[41:53] why he put those recorded here he go
[41:56] back and now explain he made known to
[42:01] them yes Laurie how he said he expounded
[42:20] that means to explain to reveal know we
[42:28] have an expanding to write in our day
[42:30] this is our exponent
[42:36] Laurie brilliant future ooh revelations
[42:40] two and three and recite every scripture
[42:42] and break that down for me without
[42:44] reading this we have no idea
[42:56] without this message without these
[43:00] writings these commentary this
[43:04] exposition you don't even know beautiful
[43:07] what is what yeah yes right and this is
[43:11] books actually prophesied about leave
[43:13] the New Testament church did Josh would
[43:17] 18 they had crossed over now into the

[47:12] Joshua tea lemon and the last of the
[47:15] tribe of the children Benjamin used the
[47:16] first tribe wedding God is land
[47:20] Joshua 19 1 and the second knock came
[47:23] forth to see me and they met think where
[47:24] they even got me verse 10 in the third
[47:27] lock here of the children's every lot
[47:29] one by one they're taking their land and
[47:31] possessions seven of them where 17 in
[47:36] the four came out today she taught the
[47:39] truth of Ishtar toward the families
[47:41] verse 24 and the fifth Locke came out a
[47:42] tribe in store master quarter the
[47:44] families thirty-two the sticks lucky
[47:47] mother churn of Naphtali even the
[47:48] children Italian but notice in verse
[47:51] four
[47:51] oh my and the seventh left came out for
[48:00] the tribe of the children of man
[48:01] according to their families
[48:03] yes that's really nice who ever seen who
[48:08] ganas yes dan was of these Dan his side
[48:17] and side with what he eat eagle he was
[48:20] on the north side he was the main tribe
[48:24] of the north of the Eagle anointing amen
[48:27] that's right
[48:27] but notice is no now George Jacobs ready
[48:31] to leave the scene he starts crying for
[48:33] sighing over his children and he gets to
[48:37] Dan and Dan shall judge his people as
[48:41] one of the tribes of Israel so first he
[48:44] has to there's two parts to he's almost
[48:46] like a Gemini
[48:47] why he's a judge and that were judges
[48:50] our pastor for the Kingston group that
[48:52] worked earlier in the fire if I will the
[48:54] actual meaning of that word judge is
[48:58] that Dan has been judged worthy
[49:01] day man he's been judged
[49:06] the verse 17 but notice there shall be a
[49:10] serpent by the way how can it be the
[49:13] judge or the Bride of Christ and also be
[49:16] Escarpment he says as an adequate path
[49:18] device the horse heals through this
[49:20] ridership wall backward he said but look
[49:23] at verse 18 ties right into the Psalms
[49:25] 27 he says and I have waited for thy
[49:28] salvation O Lord right into the rapture
[49:31] yes boys are joining serpent anointing
[49:38] goes back to church changes what was the
[49:42] mystery all the theologians all the
[49:45] geniuses all the other philosophers of
[49:48] their day when they read the church ages
[49:51] in Revelation 2 and 3 the question was
[49:55] this and the Prophet breaks it down here
[49:56] once again into resume because from our
[49:59] studies we have already learned that
[50:01] much of the revelation is totally
[50:03] misunderstood because we have not
[50:05] formally known that the church spoken up
[50:08] of the spoken to this in this book is
[50:11] not referred to the pure ecclesia or the
[50:14] elect of the crew of Christ the bride
[50:17] but a speech to the entire body of
[50:21] people who are called crazy
[50:24] so in Revelations 2 and 3 every time
[50:27] Jesus annoys or talks or speaks to a
[50:30] city or Church he is dealing with both
[50:33] seat of God and servers see Dan was the
[50:37] seventh did he go noisy but within that
[50:39] anointing there were serpents and
[50:41] there's those who the good seed was sold
[50:49] the bad seed was so and he said wait let
[50:52] it grow up until the time of the end
[50:54] right yes notice these church ages this
[50:59] book off in what way back in the Old
[51:01] Testament yes glory he's just not as all
[51:05] Israel is not Israel so all Christians
[51:07] are not Christians thus we learned that
[51:09] the church is made up of two vines
[51:11] that's true and the false and both are
[51:14] motivated by the
[51:17] yes sir absolutely yes sir now here's
[51:19] what I want to go tonight
[51:21] I'll get this forfeiting mr7 sure
[51:26] changes surely sure that God would not
[51:33] tell the Jews that if you're not good
[51:37] I'm gonna take you I'm gonna take this
[51:39] from but he does yeah I know his Lord
[51:44] God and all his wisdom hides right in
[51:47] the scripture it Leviticus 26 Christ now
[51:54] we don't do the right here the two laws
[51:55] or two law blessing long person but here
[51:58] in the videos 2016 and these shall make
[52:00] no idols
[52:01] there's no graven images neither rear
[52:03] you up a standing image neither setting
[52:05] up any image of stone in your land to
[52:07] bow down before Jesus for I am the Lord
[52:09] your God he says you shall keep my
[52:12] Sabbath's and reverence my sexually is I
[52:17] know this is part of my statutes and
[52:20] keep my Commandments he doesn't your
[52:21] them then I'll give you rain and Dew see
[52:24] him and the land shall yield her
[52:27] increase and the tree of the field show
[52:28] you enter now this is if they obey the
[52:32] Word of God but notice here in verse 14
[52:36] but if you will not hearken to me and
[52:38] will not do these things these
[52:40] Commandments and if ye shall despise my
[52:44] statutes or if your song or my judgments
[52:48] so that you will not do all my commands
[52:50] he says like that you break my covenant
[52:53] wow he's really laying it out here
[52:55] November if we do good we get to land
[52:58] rain Wow beautiful but if we do bad
[53:03] what's gonna follow hmm he says
[53:09] beautiful 4:16 I also do this on to you
[53:14] i will even appoint over you terror
[53:16] consumption now look what he gets the
[53:19] burning and the Shepherd's to your and
[53:22] the Bible says that the Jews were
[53:26] blinded for safe
[53:31] because sorrow the heart right that was
[53:36] building right here and you just saw you
[53:38] see the man you're going to be showing
[53:39] it look at verses gentlemen child 12
[53:40] verse 37 he said the Jesus did all these
[53:43] disciples right or a miracle apart and
[53:45] they still do not believe him and now
[53:48] Jesus Christ pulls all the way baptized
[53:51] and the Book of Isaiah he says but when
[53:53] she Lord was beneath her to whom is the
[53:56] arm of the Lord revealed
[53:58] therefore they could not believe because
[54:00] Isaiah said but he has blinded their
[54:02] eyes and hardened their heart brothers
[54:06] side is that it though his gifts planar
[54:11] unless they understand what they're
[54:13] harder than converting that she's human
[54:15] let's continue
[54:17] did you give really warn them of the
[54:20] seven churches 18 and if you will not
[54:25] let for all this hearken unto me and
[54:27] then I will punish you seven times more
[54:30] oh wow in verse 24 then will I also walk
[54:36] contrary punish you
[54:37] yes seven times for your status and if
[54:41] you are not we're all hardening to me
[54:43] the law contracts to me
[54:45] but notice how he ends this and then I
[54:48] will look contrary I'll show you my fury
[54:50] and I even I will look I put Slovak
[54:53] there
[54:54] he puts Louisville chess right is there
[55:02] was the firstborn yes it was see the
[55:22] space Messiah because I'm gonna hurt you
[55:24] some time
[55:26] yes he was father you know forgotten the
[55:34] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[55:36] unto children who is the first sugar of
[55:39] God is real
[55:41] yes this is my son despise not the
[55:43] chastening of the Lord nor favorite I
[55:46] rebuke them in the future suffer for
[55:48] 2000 years and look now they're still
[55:50] evolving and clinging to speak to them
[56:01] and they're still praying at the wall
[56:03] yes morning 2120 and when they shall see
[56:23] Jerusalem encompassed with armies then
[56:26] know that the desolation thereof is not
[56:28] Christ gives the warning but let them
[56:33] recharge Judea flee to the mountains and
[56:36] let them which work it misses the part
[56:38] out of it and let the night be this much
[56:39] is there and are there any - he says for
[56:42] these be the days of vengeance that all
[56:45] things which are written may be
[56:46] fulfilled now Christ warns them of the
[56:49] coming destruction because what he knew
[56:51] he was rejected now I'm just throwing
[56:54] this in here in verse 24 and they shall
[56:56] fall by the edge of the sword he led
[56:58] away captive in all nations even to see
[57:00] the fall of what beautiful through slow
[57:02] but look and through some silly try to
[57:04] down the Gentiles until the times of the
[57:07] Gentiles be fulfilled but look what the
[57:09] Prophet said here he says the defeated
[57:12] Church April chapter 3 Jesus riding the
[57:14] bottom that makes the church anxious and
[57:16] the phone's of Judge house don't want to
[57:18] say this word is amazing when he came

[58:27] cast your carcasses upon the cars are
[58:28] idling bite my soul shall bore you but
[58:32] memories tonight still chest my first

[58:40] bring your sanctuaries up into
[58:41] desolation on the smell of your the
[58:42] savior of your sweet orders he says now
[58:44] bring the lane of the desolation your
[58:46] enemies which dwell therein shall be
[58:48] understand we know as the prophet said
[58:54] here 63 we know that what happened at a
[58:56] time of the great Roman general Titus he
[58:59] was seized Jerusalem and then partly
[59:01] just they just started eating one
[59:02] another's children eating the bark of
[59:04] the tree the grass the ground and the
[59:06] Titus road right here you just pour the
[59:08] walls for the city blood round him down
[59:09] through the streets like that where he
[59:11] murdered them in there see how it's good
[59:15] fitting exactly two teeth yes sir yes
[59:17] none of them if you don't do this you're
[59:20] gonna miss all the blessings everything

[59:27] to you like people you're gonna miss it
[59:31] it's gonna be seven times the seventh
[59:33] Church agent thing puck to the Gentiles
[59:36] but if you miss it they could have went
[59:37] ready with us but because they rejected
[59:40] the Word of God God blinded their eyes
[59:44] heart their heart and the Gentiles but
[59:47] God for knowledge he saw but he told him
[59:49] was gonna happen for heaven amen
[59:55] look at verse 33 and I was scatter you
[59:58] among the
[59:58] heathen and what's wrong how to sort
[1:00:00] after your land shall be desolate your
[1:00:01] cities in leviticus 20:6 he tells them
[1:00:04] within the space of these so many years
[1:00:06] what's going to happen what's going to
[1:00:07] take place Josephus says 1.1 million
[1:00:13] died during that siege of Jerusalem
[1:00:16] which a majority were Jewish and that
[1:00:18] 67,000 recaptured enslaved during this
[1:00:21] time for the side is it possible the
[1:00:28] history would record this that God said
[1:00:32] Jews my firstborn if you don't follow
[1:00:35] the commandments of God I'm gonna take
[1:00:39] the seven golden candlesticks Ali is it
[1:00:44] recorded in archaeology it's called the
[1:00:49] Ark of Titus in Rome this scene is
[1:00:55] captured this is the capturing of
[1:00:59] Jerusalem it's then described as
[1:01:02] sculptured into this wall is called the
[1:01:05] art of Titus Titus went in there and
[1:01:07] took derogated and we see the seven
[1:01:11] golden candlesticks being carried out by
[1:01:14] Roman sort of oh my goodness Wow
[1:01:19] they have forfeited the seven churches
[1:01:22] and God told him in the word he told him
[1:01:26] spiritually good and he did it naturally
[1:01:29] my goodness Wow forfeiting the seventh
[1:01:35] root changes all the signs of the
[1:01:37] miracles all the blessings and things of
[1:01:40] God we will make this adoption we will
[1:01:42] make this body change in a
[1:01:44] four-foot-long
[1:01:44] then they did they chose not to be a
[1:01:48] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:49] yes but notice who has the golden king
[1:01:53] of things wrong when did the Gentiles
[1:01:56] start all the way banging them a
[1:01:59] condenser the Gentiles ruled from then
[1:02:02] on when they went to captivity and they
[1:02:05] ruled on and now we pick it up as as the
[1:02:08] transition
[1:02:09] from military rose to paddle rose we
[1:02:12] seen this now getting chased in there
[1:02:16] even though God who would now be pulling
[1:02:18] from the candlesticks the seven churches
[1:02:20] the Gentiles for a bride Rome would it
[1:02:23] still be rude ain't controlling
[1:02:26] everything putting to death like wood
[1:02:30] yes but they forget to see they got the
[1:02:34] natural Jesus Christ but thanks be to
[1:02:57] God that Jesus Christ gave that warning
[1:03:03] he says also attest to the Christian
[1:03:08] escape record the Bible scholar Adam
[1:03:10] Clarke
[1:03:10] the latter wrote it is very remarkable
[1:03:12] than that one single Christian perish in
[1:03:15] the destruction of Jerusalem that's
[1:03:17] right yes no there were many that were
[1:03:19] in they all escaped when they when they
[1:03:22] caught the Word of God yes
[1:03:25] the Holy Ghost first day they called
[1:03:27] that warning for Christ and when they
[1:03:29] solve the prophecy fulfilled
[1:03:31] they took Taylor get on it yes sir
[1:03:33] because destruction the other it was
[1:03:35] next the chest fight it upon the people
[1:03:38] would take place yes seven times
[1:03:40] yes servings of saints powerfulness
[1:03:43] my goodness now let's just backtrack
[1:03:46] backtrack let's just switch a year
[1:03:48] turn to Revelation seven one seven one
[1:03:55] this is this is what this is the
[1:03:58] prophecy coming what the Bible says I
[1:04:00] will restore Jesus Christ and the Great
[1:04:03] Tribulation will go back to the Jews
[1:04:06] Revelation 7:1
[1:04:07] and after these things I saw the
[1:04:09] fluorines are sitting on the four
[1:04:10] corners the earth holding the four winds
[1:04:12] of the earth that the wind should not
[1:04:13] blow on the earth nor on the sea nor any
[1:04:15] tree right now notice how I'm reading
[1:04:18] this okay
[1:04:19] first dude I saw another angel ascending
[1:04:20] from the east
[1:04:21] the seal of God notice this angel had
[1:04:23] the seal of God yes and he cried in a
[1:04:29] loud voice to the four angels to whom it
[1:04:31] was not given to hurt the earth in the
[1:04:32] sea and he said saying hurt not the
[1:04:35] earth nor the scene of the trees till we
[1:04:37] have Siana
[1:04:39] see one I'm emphasizing you see and I've
[1:04:42] sealed the service of God in our
[1:04:44] foreheads and then Christ starts
[1:04:46] bringing the roll call
[1:04:48] 1,000 here 1,000 here 12,000 here 12,000
[1:04:52] here right now notice for the Prophet
[1:04:54] the Prophet I'm gonna I'm gonna bring
[1:04:55] you up in the quarter the Prophet is now
[1:04:57] getting this look what he says ten
[1:05:02] virgins for under $40 Jews age 16 he
[1:05:05] said another three days and I saw four
[1:05:08] angels standing at four forty earth
[1:05:09] this is Nestle's blow down to the earth
[1:05:11] don't seen at a jump he says and I saw
[1:05:13] another angel ascending from the east
[1:05:14] having the seal don't let me God and he
[1:05:16] goes screw this thing okay and he's
[1:05:18] dealing with the tunes of the Gentiles
[1:05:19] in the next paragraph there now remember
[1:05:22] the servants has always been God's
[1:05:24] servant institude Abraham has served the
[1:05:27] Gentiles not a sory
[1:05:28] it's a bride it's it's a son this is the
[1:05:32] son that churches the Jews are the
[1:05:35] servants right now he's dealing with
[1:05:36] this you just got done talking about
[1:05:38] revelation 7 now look at the very next
[1:05:40] paragraph 264 and he's dealing with
[1:05:45] these angels and at the seal of God and
[1:05:47] they suppose the four winds and just
[1:05:49] what a beautiful parable parallels are
[1:05:52] parallel here we could run if we get
[1:05:56] back to Ezekiel or but what he had is
[1:05:59] easy to Yuma yes because he says and
[1:06:01] find out what he says has anything like
[1:06:03] this happened before
[1:06:05] yes yes so what things like the Great
[1:06:09] Tribulation the bride goes up the fools
[1:06:12] were to go in and die the most of the
[1:06:13] Christians or the lost would look more
[1:06:16] like a new counsel churches you see the
[1:06:17] Marquise but then at that time the Jews
[1:06:19] are another Gentile daughter's clothes
[1:06:21] and I go back to but what before all
[1:06:25] destruction can hit he has to seal his
[1:06:29] hundred yes yes yes
[1:06:34] yes Gloria and the properties is the
[1:06:38] parallel to this in Ezekiel 9 and then
[1:06:42] he starts here in the next paragraph
[1:06:43] here they want the slide help them and
[1:06:45] if one came dressed in a white with the
[1:06:48] right writers he quoted humming your
[1:06:50] brother and decided to kill it for you
[1:06:52] tonight then had his think where's Mort
[1:06:54] pull him up the white right great right
[1:06:56] okay now look at Ezekiel 9 and he cried
[1:07:00] also my dears with a lot of boys saying
[1:07:02] cause them that have charged over the
[1:07:04] city drawn here even every man was his
[1:07:06] destroyed weapon in his hand right and
[1:07:09] the old six men came from the way of the
[1:07:11] higher gate which slides toward the
[1:07:13] north and every man of slider live in
[1:07:15] his hand and every man among them was
[1:07:17] clothed linen would look with the
[1:07:19] writers inkhorn might his sight
[1:07:21] and one man among that was closed linen
[1:07:22] and they went and stood by the brazen
[1:07:24] altar now verse four and God spoke
[1:07:28] specifically to this white man dressed
[1:07:31] in white or whatever just away with the
[1:07:34] heat warm right go therefore miss the
[1:07:37] city through the midst of Jerusalem and
[1:07:39] set a mark on the foreheads of the men
[1:07:41] that sigh and cry for the abominations
[1:07:42] the dungeon is and the Prophet is
[1:07:45] correlating to this scripture back to
[1:07:47] revelation 7 yes right yes so he's
[1:07:55] dealing with this scripture and then the
[1:07:58] mark of the beast I picked up here 61
[1:08:01] and he's dealing with the seals but he
[1:08:03] goes back now into the ink Lord of
[1:08:05] writers right there he says it before
[1:08:07] with the city another thing happened
[1:08:08] there came a man white Laura decide now
[1:08:12] he's dealing with this now look what he
[1:08:15] says in the next paragraph if you want
[1:08:17] copies lists you know I couldn't know
[1:08:19] anything now when did that take place
[1:08:22] he's talking about Ezekiel he says
[1:08:24] whether that take place alone he said
[1:08:29] that was the early Pentecostal church
[1:08:31] when the Holy Spirit went through it
[1:08:33] marked out the church notice how history
[1:08:36] if you ever taken the writing of
[1:08:38] Josephus when he wrote the great battle
[1:08:40] it was actually 70 he says he says that
[1:08:45] marking
[1:08:46] took place in a star twin in x2 but the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost came down and marked a
[1:08:52] hundred and twenty they started a power
[1:08:55] house oh why do judgment come because
[1:09:01] now they're not laughing you're not
[1:09:03] laughing sort of man they're laughing
[1:09:06] the whole coast yes
[1:09:09] now judgment could really get he says
[1:09:13] know why he said they made he says they
[1:09:15] were all they spoke in tongues they
[1:09:16] shouted the mighty rushing wind built
[1:09:17] and they went for such zeal to the
[1:09:20] purpose in from the Holy Ghost and what
[1:09:22] they do they made fun of them they'll
[1:09:23] ask them that's right Jesus that you
[1:09:25] speak against me or the Holy Ghost come
[1:09:27] one word against it will never forgive
[1:09:29] and they seal their true destination
[1:09:31] when they made all right please go to
[1:09:36] gate or seal the right name in the book
[1:09:38] of Acts and through the rest of that
[1:09:40] time with Peter Paul of belsen German
[1:09:42] and all the rest of disciples by
[1:09:44] reversing all Russia John Mark they were
[1:09:48] getting people sealed before the
[1:09:51] judgment just like in the tribulation
[1:09:56] God I headed to hold all the rats back
[1:09:58] let's really get seal they met another
[1:10:00] chord without but he had to do it one
[1:10:02] time before doesn't struck here to get
[1:10:13] good amen Laurie oh praise the Lord but
[1:10:18] thank God we have this promise in
[1:10:20] Leviticus 26 24 and yet for all of that

[1:18:46] the Daniel Darko was there and I call it
[1:18:48] and he just blew off the season Ghana he

[1:19:08] open up just reviewing accompany all -
[1:19:10] things just going through and room 7
[1:19:13] what the next scripture right there God
[1:19:19] warned to be more than people are but
[1:19:23] you didn't make it clean everything was
[1:19:25] in the hand of God our lives in the hand
[1:19:28] of God why is my life like this why in
[1:19:29] my life like this - this was father's in
[1:19:32] control we must put our full trust in
[1:19:37] Jesus Christ because number we have not
[1:19:39] even seen a tough time yet that's right
[1:19:42] okay we don't even know and it's like
[1:19:44] but we will and we will we will rise up
[1:19:48] as mrs. Jesus Christ and we'll back our
[1:19:52] little mama shoulder a little sleeves
[1:19:55] here and we'll go do and accomplish
[1:19:57] everything the whole we're gonna send
[1:19:58] you with you we will be that mighty arm
[1:20:01] we will read those over more than
[1:20:04] overcomers the Bible says will be that
[1:20:06] overcoming arm yes that group of
[1:20:08] soldiers but is Joel to me I don't know
[1:20:11] I don't want to put my spin on it but
[1:20:13] whatever it is it's gonna be that's
[1:20:17] right but it looks so good a job David
[1:20:19] he said it'd be so fun we want to be a
[1:20:23] part of that instead it won't be an open
[1:20:25] show this time a secret would this is
[1:20:29] secret coming with a bride the third
[1:20:32] pole will be on and we'll have to
[1:20:34] exercise we discern the very spirit
[1:20:37] within each one yes yeah your back back
[1:20:40] your way but Jesse's doubles the church
[1:20:41] age right you work your way back to the
[1:20:44] church ages in Ephesus what was the
[1:20:46] problem the decent acquaintance but if
[1:20:49] you notice before the deed the
[1:20:50] Nicolaitans was Ananias and Sapphira
[1:20:55] they looked like they were doing me good
[1:20:58] something but it was totally big
[1:21:03] Antichrist it could not even be detected
[1:21:08] by the deeds you could not outwardly
[1:21:12] show that these are the competitors
[1:21:13] we're seeing under the message but to
[1:21:16] see these things they're open to the
[1:21:18] eyes staying from the parents of you but
[1:21:23] when I come down to and I see Sapphira
[1:21:25] that they sold some land and they're
[1:21:28] gonna go give the money to Peter and the
[1:21:32] disciples to further the kingdom but it
[1:21:35] was the Antichrist
[1:21:37] how can you see that you can who
[1:21:41] detected the Holy Ghost he's he detected
[1:21:48] the stirrer of the thoughts and says no
[1:21:51] so I must move a cleaning cooler because
[1:21:53] once these are gone
[1:21:55] this message now we have to do now what
[1:21:59] to have our exercises exercised to
[1:22:01] discern both good and now we have to
[1:22:04] detect not just and CAC something
[1:22:06] naturally we have to be able to be
[1:22:08] tempted by the Holy Ghost so you know
[1:22:14] coach is gonna get so close to the
[1:22:58] teaching on the church I just want to
[1:23:08] say a few things I hope everybody can
[1:23:10] see that in Joshua 18 that was beautiful
[1:23:13] I remember when you taught that black
[1:23:14] forgot all about it
[1:23:15] so thank we come back and teach that I
[1:23:18] wanted to do a video on the church ages
[1:23:19] from YouTube channel I would control
[1:23:22] that prophecy punish seven times more
[1:23:48] has anybody ever seen that Minsk Russia
[1:23:51] and then the arca Titus carrying out the
[1:23:55] natural Romans carried out an angio and
[1:23:57] but God was carrying out the Spirit we
[1:24:05] see like this church leave tonight when
[1:24:07] you've heard from head
[1:24:10] and this is a example of gift of
[1:24:15] teaching that I believe he's doing all
[1:24:20] you can do I'm saying is I don't know
[1:24:23] whether Simon's convinced about his gift
[1:24:24] but I have I hadn't even been so his
[1:24:27] gift follow my heart because a teacher
[1:24:31] goes deeper than all the other ones just
[1:24:33] do any have you ever heard that before
[1:24:35] on the church ages different ministries
[1:24:38] you okay no or by I listen to a lot
[1:24:41] online and listen you know I got washing
[1:24:43] dishes I listen to all different
[1:24:44] preachers you know be cf-19 ranking you
[1:24:47] know I just want to encourage about rid
[1:24:50] of me that was remembered by the grammar
[1:24:56] said the seals plus the church ages plus
[1:24:59] the history he sentenced us doesn't mean
[1:25:04] every word but the revelations inside
[1:25:07] sermons like when he pulls it up
[1:25:11] Scripture and that shows you the Old
[1:25:12] Testament where it is
[1:25:13] that's the state the Lord like oil
[1:25:15] Eagles whatever it is from the Old
[1:25:18] Testament every brady's that's the say
[1:25:20] the Lord from that tonight oh I like how
[1:25:29] he ended it there that was a beautiful
[1:25:31] ending the Jews forfeited the church
[1:25:32] images we must not forfeit number
[1:25:34] Hebrews three said we cannot neglect
[1:25:38] this Holy Ghost gospel the military we
[1:25:43] can't neglect it that's what I was so
[1:25:45] concerned about with our church in every
[1:25:46] church you can't let up on praying I
[1:25:49] made our church to come early and pray
[1:25:51] if you can't come early right because we
[1:25:54] can't neglect many but if we neglect it
[1:25:57] then like the brother said will forfeit
[1:26:01] it before his reaction it's in the
[1:26:05] little things program so it's not the
[1:26:06] big things is the little things now we
[1:26:09] got a view
[1:26:11] okay that mean a five is for shooter I'm
[1:26:15] sorry it's chapter two verse one we
[1:26:17] ought to get the more earnest heed to
[1:26:18] things which you've heard less than any
[1:26:19] time we should let them slip
[1:26:22] or if that weren't spoken by Angels
[1:26:24] steadfast and every transgression this
[1:26:26] will be to receive a just recompense of
[1:26:28] reward how should we escape if we
[1:26:29] neglect so great salvation it's just is
[1:26:32] just neglecting the prayer the Holy
[1:26:35] Ghost is afraid not
[1:26:37] it's the power of prayer you understand
[1:26:40] what I'm saying hey how many only would
[1:26:43] say lord help me to pray moreover it's
[1:26:45] not Emerson clutter Graham says pray
[1:26:48] before you come to church and I know I
[1:26:51] recovered that over and over but who's
[1:26:53] doing it who's who's on fire and not
[1:26:57] make letters who's not neglecting the
[1:26:59] things that's why and now we have a
[1:27:02] scriptural basis for that go for it just
[1:27:05] as the Jews for if I did the blessings
[1:27:07] of the land the land and get a Sevenfold
[1:27:11] punishment that's what that's what's up
[1:27:13] for us now because listen if we forfeit
[1:27:17] if we neglect the message the Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] now we forfeit the seven rewards this is
[1:27:22] the seven overcome you now Lord that's
[1:27:23] right absolutely absolutely right
[1:27:26] because every overcomer
[1:27:28] gets the reward from the previous ages
[1:27:29] that's what we miss if we neglected
[1:27:34] that's all it's got to be
[1:27:36] we must keep ourselves in our first love
[1:27:38] how she missed it if we neglect so great
[1:27:41] salvation which at first began to be
[1:27:44] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:27:45] unto us by then that burden God also
[1:27:48] bearing them witness both with signs and
[1:27:49] wonders and with that verse miracles and
[1:27:51] gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[1:27:53] own will cannot neglect these things
[1:27:57] praise the Lord I appreciate the
[1:27:59] faithful Saints tonight but how many are
[1:28:01] not here to know how many are not here
[1:28:02] and not there just they're not their
[1:28:04] minds aren't all the things of God and
[1:28:05] they left this morning and their lives
[1:28:07] won't even change they have no more
[1:28:09] burden for missionary work no more
[1:28:11] prayer you understand what I'm saying
[1:28:13] like then it's neglected and we can say
[1:28:17] we believe the message but if the
[1:28:18] message doesn't come in here that our
[1:28:20] life don't look like such an important
[1:28:25] thing
[1:28:30] that's why beg people come early in
[1:28:32] prayer great I
[1:28:34] I have to do it himself is your LCD
[1:28:38] black the Holy Ghost
[1:28:41] see that's the burden of this hour
