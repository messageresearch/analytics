[36:32] hallelujah I was thinking see my amen is
[36:54] anything but you know it's amazing to us
[36:57] look at it but the real thing that's
[36:59] amazing is that because no that is God's
[37:03] answer I praise God it makes God to give
[37:06] strength for the burden that he has
[37:10] purpose for the beat hallelujah
[37:12] it's based a lot on human strength that
[37:15] is without yes sir yes of me we simply
[37:18] don't have the stamina nor the patience
[37:20] for it doesn't matter how strongly there
[37:21] be any virtue even a person can do a lot
[37:24] of patience as a person that will not
[37:27] quake and as you're up to what God has
[37:30] called
[37:31] it really takes some more it takes godly
[37:34] patience
[37:35] yes on moving the north marks we just
[37:38] want to just give glory to the north and
[37:40] maybe G was awarded God I know every
[37:45] lead
[37:45] Oh friendship logistics we're throughout
[37:50] the years we just want to look into the
[37:54] word of a lawyer this morning before we
[37:57] maybe a turn there if we could just go
[37:59] in the morning morning prayer there's
[38:01] certainly happier this morning
[38:04] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are just
[38:08] so privileged
[38:10] just to be able to come into your
[38:11] presence yes Father to know that Lord we
[38:15] believe ordained Lord for this time
[38:19] services Lord we just ask that you would
[38:22] help us because we realize that in every
[38:25] time that we are purpose more to come
[38:28] together Lord and seek after you know
[38:31] father that Lord that's when the enemy
[38:33] or also try to find all the different
[38:36] things the Lord that can arise whether
[38:38] to the physical body Lord in the spirit
[38:40] Lord the father we ask the more than as
[38:44] we come here more our desire Lord is
[38:46] that to present ourselves to you Lord
[38:49] God we ask the door that you would just
[38:52] have your way in our midst or father
[38:55] just reserved myself unto you Lord for
[38:57] the services Lord
[38:59] yes Father Lord that you would just
[39:00] guide the director Lord truly that means
[39:03] that are here Lord father to take you
[39:06] Lord to bring everything together one
[39:08] and we are certainly need people more as
[39:10] we ask that you would just move among us
[39:12] more than a special way it's speak to
[39:14] each and every one of our hearts Lord
[39:16] Lord we just ask that you would meet the
[39:19] needs or God that are here this morning
[39:21] we presented water ourselves to you Lord
[39:24] it would ask the Lord if our faith is
[39:26] not in the place where it needs to be
[39:28] father to be able to receive or what you
[39:31] have for us we have the Lord that you
[39:33] will move by more than move upon us Lord
[39:36] that father our faith might be equipped
[39:38] in more thought to that place Lord Jesus
[39:41] to be able to receive more than
[39:43] take hold upon that North God which you
[39:45] are desiring Lord God to move in our
[39:48] lives with more father we just ask them
[39:50] even just take a flea control now father
[39:52] we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus
[39:55] Christ let's go to Exodus chapter 25 I
[40:01] could Exodus 20:5 we'll just read a few
[40:18] verses and let you be seated verse 1 and
[40:24] the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak
[40:27] unto the children of Israel that they
[40:31] bring me in honor of every man that
[40:34] giveth me willingly with his heart he
[40:38] shall take my offer I don't want either
[40:42] a look at that there in the scripture
[40:44] God is already regarding it as his
[40:47] offering
[40:48] yes but it's his offering that must come
[40:52] from a willing heart in that so God is
[40:56] interesting things but those things must
[40:59] be surrendered willingly vnn so if we're
[41:03] going down to verse 8 and let them make
[41:09] me a sanctuary but I may dwell among
[41:12] them according to all that I showed me
[41:16] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[41:18] the pattern of all the instruments their
[41:20] own even so shall you baby may God
[41:26] richly bless you
[41:27] this is where this morning you should be
[41:29] seated like you just take one one step
[41:33] forward here and just stop working with
[41:35] us this morning a little bit to see how
[41:37] the auto Texas model with my seat move
[41:39] so much that
[41:42] [Music]
[41:44] you know this is always been where
[41:49] there's always been people there are
[41:52] people all across the face of the earth
[41:54] your separate existence depends on luck
[42:03] people are dedicated amen and in order
[42:07] to become dedicate there has to be
[42:10] something that would strike a person's
[42:12] brother and will tell us even in the
[42:14] message perseverance he said there's a
[42:16] spirit that moves upon you and you are
[42:19] motivated by that spirit a mad verbal
[42:22] driving and set your ambition so then
[42:25] you begin to give to that and begin to
[42:27] move toward that and you know it's
[42:30] really not anything that is a great
[42:32] mystery when someone is dedicated to
[42:35] something it shows yes did you don't
[42:37] hear oh you have asked because it is
[42:40] really a theme of their life a man as a
[42:44] focus of their conversation yeah he
[42:47] audio CD action in their life you'll see
[42:49] to where things will be expended where
[42:52] people will expend great integration and
[42:55] make great sacrifices because of
[42:58] dedication and dedication itself is
[43:01] something that is not where for an
[43:03] individual doing it for a reward but it
[43:07] is simply because it is moved in their
[43:10] heart and they desire to do that amen I
[43:13] don't think any of the young people here
[43:15] you know you know jump for joy when it
[43:18] comes to sand you know God get to take
[43:20] out the trash no those are using things
[43:22] that even all of us that you have to say
[43:25] it's getting high let's guess I better
[43:27] take it out right now and right now
[43:30] those are not things that you look at it
[43:33] are overjoyed with but there are certain
[43:36] things that you like to do maybe certain
[43:38] hobbies and certain things and you know
[43:40] you can do it and nobody pays you for it
[43:42] you just enjoy doing and you're
[43:45] dedicated to it
[43:46] you'll read about it you enjoy looking
[43:48] at it finding out little little things
[43:50] you're there
[43:51] you willingly dedicated yes and then
[43:53] that is exactly what God Himself and so
[43:57] forth and ordained that our lives would
[44:00] be dedicated in that minute there's
[44:02] absolutely no way that we're able to do
[44:06] it and actually have the dedication that
[44:08] God desires just from our own human
[44:11] merits it takes gone to raise up what he
[44:16] has already placed within us and that's
[44:19] what we want to just begin to even look
[44:21] at because when you look at it across of
[44:26] what God is saying here within this
[44:28] portion of scriptures knowing that
[44:31] within God haven't spoke to them or to
[44:35] Moses here in this time this is when
[44:37] Moses has been caught up by the Lord and
[44:39] the Lord is speaking to Moses heart
[44:42] letting him know of all of these things
[44:44] within here the scripture says in verse
[44:48] eight let them make me a sanctuary that
[44:50] I may dwell among them and well you know
[44:53] we would have a tendency to think
[44:55] sanctuary we're thinking of tabernacle
[44:57] but yet God differs between the
[45:00] tabernacle and the sanctuary the
[45:02] sanctuary is the innermost part of the
[45:05] tavern and here is what God's desire is
[45:09] that they would make him a sanctuary a
[45:12] place where he could come and dwell
[45:15] fully and how can a person make God a
[45:20] sanctuary of their own accord there's
[45:24] got to be inspiration come from God a
[45:28] pattern come from God that God Himself
[45:31] cuz we know he won't dwell within
[45:34] anything but it'll work right so it must
[45:37] be God that was sent forth his word by
[45:40] his spirit that then he'll come and
[45:42] dwell in the pattern that he set forth a
[45:45] mess so women will you find that even in
[45:49] your life of how that God is moving
[45:52] these things didn't just happen all at
[45:54] once but God was moving
[45:57] it had to move upon the hearts of people
[45:59] and then the people are responding to
[46:01] what God's desire is so then when we
[46:05] look at God's whole purpose a desire was
[46:09] not just for a tabernacle not just for
[46:11] something that would be on the outside
[46:14] that would be wonderful but God wants
[46:18] not just something that is just an our
[46:21] image but God wants a durable substance
[46:24] from the inside out man and this is
[46:27] gospel right let them make me a
[46:30] sanctuary that I may dwell there so we
[46:33] were looking at it I want to just come
[46:36] back to one of the first times that this
[46:39] word of sanctuary is used within the
[46:42] scriptures and we want to look at it
[46:45] even in this matter because it's
[46:47] important that you had not just in
[46:49] having knowledge that God's purpose
[46:52] cannot be defeated but it's important
[46:56] that that is made real to you and I any
[46:59] good we we see our godly seed our short
[47:04] coming up but God Himself sees something
[47:07] much deeper and there's no way that
[47:10] we're able to pick ourselves up but I
[47:12] believe that God himself
[47:14] we are standing here as witnesses this
[47:17] morning
[47:17] that God is able to fulfill and provide
[47:21] for one year's colorful that he is still
[47:24] to over John game board so within the
[47:28] measure knowing that God's Word cannot
[47:31] be defeated as the Prophet would tell us
[47:33] many times or put it within phrasing in
[47:36] this manner but God did not save you
[47:38] today knowing he's going to lose you
[47:40] tomorrow defeats his own purpose right
[47:43] so God we recognize that our election
[47:47] with Paul could say the word make your
[47:50] election sure and he says or there was
[47:54] Peter but Paul says in Thessalonians he
[47:56] said brother beloved O God that you
[47:59] would know your election yeah you see
[48:02] God already knows your election
[48:05] no lenger soccer notice it wasn't one
[48:08] that we no relation it is important as
[48:12] Peter could say make your election and
[48:14] call it show so these are very important
[48:18] things that here we know that that
[48:20] election was before any alum starter sir
[48:23] molecule and I've been saying it at home
[48:26] a little bit but you know election is
[48:28] not like you are I uh coming up out of
[48:32] the recess and we'll pick a kickball
[48:34] geez where people come forward and then
[48:37] God said I'll choose this one I'll
[48:39] choose that one I choose this foot
[48:40] that's not election my election is that
[48:44] within himself before anything than gun
[48:48] good or evil God has already chosen we
[48:52] are the fruit and the seed of his loins
[48:55] a magazine the God has already purposed
[48:59] that election so with it if we find that
[49:02] God's purpose cannot be defeated even
[49:05] when you look at where it travel of
[49:08] their exodus out of Egypt they come here
[49:11] to the Red Sea in Exodus 15 and Moses
[49:14] you know after they crossed the Red Sea
[49:17] and God mix away through that that is
[49:21] that the the Rick see itself order or
[49:23] the obstacle that was there and has they
[49:26] come up on the other side you know it
[49:29] Moses is singing the song of Moses and
[49:32] he is singing a song jubilee their love
[49:36] of deliverance and I want to just look
[49:39] here just for a moment in verse 16 of
[49:41] Exodus 15 Moses is even not just
[49:45] speaking of what God has done many
[49:48] caught up on the Spirit of God and he
[49:51] begins to speak not only of what God has
[49:53] done but if he gets to speak of what God
[49:57] is going to do amen you say the word of
[50:01] God his luck is not sterile oh my
[50:06] oh hey is he which is uh uh which was
[50:11] which is and which is to come up I'm
[50:14] talking about the word from the where it
[50:18] is me well it's not equal give it
[50:21] something just of mass it's a sterile
[50:23] water it lacks the authority and the
[50:27] power to address present situation in a
[50:31] special condition and that is not the
[50:34] Word of God though we can look at a
[50:36] letter that people can look at the
[50:37] letter you recognize that the only way
[50:39] that you had to truly believe God for
[50:42] who he is is because you are a part of
[50:45] God and God has revealed itself but I
[50:48] removed you from just the past it brings
[50:51] the card from history to the table
[50:54] breasts and thighs press it then he's
[50:57] also a prophesied and reveal those
[51:00] things the Troy el Chacal just you and I
[51:03] standing in a holding pattern and
[51:06] waiting to find out what's God's gonna
[51:08] do
[51:08] I wonder what's going to take place but
[51:10] we have a confidence by pressing reality
[51:14] Oh present God the same God who boo-bear
[51:17] it's the same gonna move out a true
[51:25] comfort
[51:26] hey so within this here Moses his
[51:31] prophet I'm under this under the Spirit
[51:33] of God and he says in verse sixteen fear
[51:36] and dread shall fall upon them speaking
[51:38] about in heaven by the greatness of that
[51:41] arm they shall be as steel as a stone
[51:44] till that people pass over the Lord to
[51:47] the people pass over which thou hast
[51:51] purchased cry purchased Israel to
[51:55] himself
[51:55] how about it yes oh my god tonight
[52:01] a slate off all that first one that's
[52:04] you Michel free in your stead I came
[52:11] down in your stead I banged away just
[52:21] walking up said either purchase me amen
[52:45] Paulo purchases the only purchases that
[52:49] was belongs to him I have these freshest
[52:53] anything yet not only belongs to him
[52:55] he's got a purpose and a reasonable yeah
[52:59] Lord he says Moses going on he says thou
[53:04] shalt bring them in there's no question
[53:06] about this God shall bring them in and
[53:08] let them in the mouth of the light
[53:10] inheritance in a place Oh Lord which
[53:14] thou hast made for thee to dwell in the
[53:17] Bliss was balanced made for me the
[53:19] Grumman yes God makes his own place come
[53:28] to worship in the confines of man he
[53:31] worships in his word status is always
[53:38] yes not you coming to the people's place
[53:40] God ordains the place and his people
[53:43] come to you
[53:46] [Applause]
[53:48] here as Moses cause uncle say in the
[53:52] sanctuary Oh Lord with thy hands have
[53:55] established lujah the Lord shall reign
[53:59] forever and ever so we see even in the
[54:03] scripture the scripture is not just
[54:04] speaking of them coming and building the
[54:06] tabernacle it's speaking of elder very
[54:08] many of the dwelling where God Himself
[54:11] will bring forth a body ah that he have
[54:15] set has established but this was also
[54:17] speaking of my Millennium but that even
[54:19] which goes on in the control looking at
[54:22] and you know Israel at the time they
[54:25] don't see all of those parts in there
[54:27] but God is letting if he know this is
[54:29] where I will be look at there is no ass
[54:32] gifts maybe we should repel a door close
[54:47] okay so when we're looking at it the
[54:50] purpose of God it cannot be defeat
[54:53] earlier so when we're giving at the
[54:56] thought here of dedication partly just a
[54:58] moment here I don't want to sweat my
[55:01] jacket later on even break a sweat
[55:06] thank you we're looking at the
[55:09] dedication must be leadership from the
[55:16] Lord by his spirit yes that would bring
[55:21] forth what he's calling for a man it has
[55:24] to be because otherwise it's us
[55:27] presuming and what God wants anytime we
[55:30] presume and I don't know what you later
[55:34] you know deep thinkers here and so forth
[55:36] ah you know we can build bridges right
[55:40] right look at things that this listen
[55:42] this we can do all that we presume on
[55:45] fit right but when it comes to this what
[55:49] is most important is that with our soul
[55:52] there be no presume most important yes
[55:56] they just to have other effects and
[55:58] things around our life for their jobs of
[56:00] others
[56:00] but yet thank god we've got contact with
[56:03] God
[56:04] then we have one who's able to stabilize
[56:06] us Hey what is able to discern and we
[56:09] can hear his voice and that pulls
[56:12] everything else in line in our lives
[56:14] yes thank God sure it must be gone to
[56:17] come and bring leadership in our lives
[56:19] that what he's calling forward we might
[56:23] be able to move in line with it and this
[56:26] is where brother Branham will speak
[56:29] about in the message invisible union of
[56:31] the right of frightened and it talks
[56:34] about how that you know we're looking at
[56:37] the different churches and then actually
[56:39] see we living in and out so he's
[56:41] watching how they're going about and
[56:43] he's talking about the character he's
[56:45] talking about all of these things I
[56:47] remember character is a true substance
[56:50] alright man the outside the outside form
[56:54] is not character the character is a
[56:57] durable substance yeah so here it is a
[56:59] word that's discerning the character he
[57:04] says with Eason I want you to watch is
[57:06] that was the spiritual bride when she
[57:07] begins to have a revival when she begins
[57:10] to come back and line herself up with
[57:12] the word of God watched it again how
[57:16] that the scriptures at that time there
[57:18] will be a message sweep out to catch
[57:20] that right catch that woman to left man
[57:24] God made a promise that he was going to
[57:29] deliver God with a strong in God made
[57:33] that promise yes yes Abraham was asleep
[57:36] drunk made the promise I'm going to be
[57:42] at least Rick that's why Moses he failed
[57:45] he was even doing it by her true
[57:46] strength right it was not going to be by
[57:49] Moses himself being one who was alert
[57:52] but it's got to take the calling of that
[57:55] one that God ordained that he would be
[57:58] raised up yeah about the Moses inside of
[58:00] Moses
[58:01] amen amen so we're looking at it it is
[58:06] God Himself remember the people were
[58:08] living down in Egypt a hundred years and
[58:12] here they are
[58:13] we know that
[58:14] Moses you know there was a rejection and
[58:16] Moses goes out for 40 years under the
[58:18] people are conditioned notice God will
[58:21] never move unless the people are in
[58:24] condition beget it's not a burglary that
[58:29] brings him on the seat right allows
[58:32] conditions of time to come into a place
[58:35] to where the people of God they begin
[58:38] the Moose sight of everything else
[58:39] around them in Egypt and the Bible say
[58:42] baby get the crowd to God and God had
[58:45] respect unto the red God hearing them
[58:52] pray in a manner that he had not heard
[58:55] that great before the thing was bread
[58:59] yes say that we're praying but it was
[59:01] something about it they were calling out
[59:04] in tune and in line with what God's
[59:06] desire was to do for God we can be lined
[59:12] with the Word of God he's lined with the
[59:14] sterile I pray in the spirit look at
[59:20] your pad not in the skull step on the
[59:25] seat and God on the chemical fillers
[59:27] were in a today hey I'm speaking to
[59:31] people this morning
[59:33] I let myself at times when you were pray
[59:35] at times be prayed and all of a sudden
[59:37] you hear yourself speak things out of
[59:39] your mouth and you think rulers that
[59:41] adjusts it that does that mean why am I
[59:43] saying that like that gosh God will
[59:45] bring it right to pass amen amen
[59:49] yes sir is exactly the truth I'm a much
[59:51] son bitumen right here you're only
[59:53] taking it to the doctor he had the tumor
[59:55] on his eye that thing's stuck out like
[59:56] that but just so you remember that he is
[59:59] stuck out on this I like that and we
[1:00:01] have taken him to Kruger claims just a
[1:00:02] little felt they have put him under it
[1:00:04] and you know they're going to do x-rays
[1:00:06] and so forth and I remember I put him up
[1:00:09] her prayer and we went up to pray and we
[1:00:11] were just going to pray for God to be
[1:00:13] with me in the midst of the surgery and
[1:00:15] we begin to come up there and pray as I
[1:00:18] was praying I was my mouth king when all
[1:00:20] the brothers were getting around I'll
[1:00:22] begin to fake God for His healing God
[1:00:24] thank you for delivering
[1:00:25] thank you for judging you listen I'm
[1:00:28] hearing myself praise this if you go to
[1:00:32] the bottom alive to think what are you
[1:00:34] saying
[1:00:35] but I couldn't stop it a man in your
[1:00:38] I find you know what in a few
[1:00:41] days we're setting up again if it wasn't
[1:00:43] looking wasn't looking this is going
[1:00:53] down you feel with the Spirit of God is
[1:01:39] a shadow longer your body you go shake
[1:01:52] you get down sometimes a righteousness
[1:01:55] is ready because that sucks your life
[1:02:08] God will move even the things that need
[1:02:12] to be prayed about think about what in
[1:02:14] Luther's time and God was fixing to move
[1:02:17] in a transition for those things and he
[1:02:20] began to pray concerning those things
[1:02:22] even with WestEd think about think of
[1:02:25] you know brother William Seymour and how
[1:02:29] that man will all miss some sisters and
[1:02:31] things like that I I love looking about
[1:02:33] that I love repeating on yes I don't
[1:02:35] think

[1:02:43] enjoyed there was you find out there's
[1:02:45] young people 10 and 12 years old that

[1:02:49] causes moving on their heart and they
[1:02:51] were praying for people come on somebody
[1:02:54] yeah you say well brother Sam you're not
[1:02:57] going back to his usual street but the
[1:02:58] same God it was back there he comes

[1:03:07] amazing opening of the work just not
[1:03:09] doing it or do away Google her God
[1:03:12] brings him more pressing right through
[1:03:21] sometimes you know you you're prayed for
[1:03:23] and you're healed and then there's other
[1:03:25] times you're grateful and you gotta go
[1:03:27] to the doctor right any case plane no
[1:03:30] but the one thing about it is is our
[1:03:32] faith listen you don't have to go this
[1:03:35] way whether God heals me here but you
[1:03:37] know every day of our lives we would
[1:03:39] love your video our lives to be miracle
[1:03:42] right without every day about a lot we
[1:03:44] would we would love every day I love
[1:03:46] every day when air sickness will come
[1:03:47] around you know even when I don't feel
[1:03:49] good oh look when I pray there it is his
[1:03:52] song God just takes it from me but if it
[1:03:54] did I'd become very comfortable in
[1:03:56] eating right brother right I won
[1:03:58] deliberately I think I need but God
[1:04:01] knows just the measure of Allah put
[1:04:04] everything together next where he was
[1:04:06] right about him dealing with this
[1:04:07] particular quote and I'm really
[1:04:10] referring to of how the bright lines
[1:04:12] will shut up with the Word of God by his
[1:04:15] Spirit he moves even into that of
[1:04:17] speaking of a family he goes right from
[1:04:19] dealing with this and he says you know
[1:04:21] how it is in a family
[1:04:22] things can run well for a good period of
[1:04:24] time he said and then all of a sudden he
[1:04:26] said it's like they say in the South you
[1:04:28] know when it rains it pours you should
[1:04:30] see everything runs on a beautifying and
[1:04:33] in continuity he said that there's a law
[1:04:35] to all of that his tears Titus I'm just
[1:04:40] gonna I'm following him that's what I'm
[1:04:41] reserved you feel we've many times
[1:04:43] within our families that here everything
[1:04:45] is just sealing in mind everything just
[1:04:47] you know right in order I'm talking
[1:04:49] about even our attitudes object you die
[1:04:51] spirit everything yes they not and then
[1:04:54] you get pressured you get things that
[1:04:56] come off I get just just the things of
[1:04:58] life and then what has to happen it has
[1:05:01] to be the Lord moving on your heart you
[1:05:03] say wait a minute this thing seems a
[1:05:05] little bit out of line yeah
[1:05:07] your may as an amateur creator your
[1:05:09] desire is to see things brought in line
[1:05:15] yeah placed on your heart to see those
[1:05:18] things in life yes and you know what
[1:05:21] it's God taking those opportunities to
[1:05:23] prove his grace to you hey man you can
[1:05:26] look back and say through many dangers
[1:05:28] total stairs we have already come yes
[1:05:31] sir that what yes sir you um never
[1:05:33] existent your faith you you recognized
[1:05:35] the faith reside in your very precious
[1:05:37] faith but you and even not even be as
[1:05:40] precious as it is you just phony having
[1:05:43] not been that you can see we're here hey
[1:05:46] ash catcher trick through trail yes
[1:05:58] hallelujah so this so here the spiritual
[1:06:03] church there has to be God moving on the
[1:06:07] scene here remember
[1:06:09] God was getting Moses ready the people
[1:06:12] were ready that's the same way it spin
[1:06:14] within every age yeah you know you would
[1:06:17] look at this and you would think well
[1:06:20] these are the people that's ordained of
[1:06:22] God to hear it why don't they just hear
[1:06:24] it but you see it's got to be it's got
[1:06:26] God has to create the atmosphere in
[1:06:29] order for us to be able to receive a mad
[1:06:32] they mad you know it is sometimes we're
[1:06:36] not in the right right right demeaning
[1:06:38] yes sir this is a matter that you
[1:06:40] covered the pizza I will cut half a
[1:06:42] sphere where I will take it
[1:06:44] right right girl right or you'll say
[1:06:46] Mary manin that's true but Cohasset
[1:06:50] o'clock comes down and creates that to
[1:06:53] where the people begin to call yes yeah
[1:06:57] here everything is working all of these
[1:06:59] parts are working together and and
[1:07:02] notice how that when the gods will send
[1:07:05] a word that the people that will begin
[1:07:07] to line with that word that becomes a
[1:07:09] hunger within the people to line with
[1:07:13] the Word of God like to spend a little
[1:07:17] more time with that delicious sleepy
[1:07:19] just go on just a little bit here when
[1:07:21] God is speaking to Moses and it's in
[1:07:25] regard to all of these things in in a
[1:07:30] vision that God is making known to Moses
[1:07:33] there when he Moses walks upon the
[1:07:35] mountain here is Moses in the cloud and
[1:07:38] God is letting him know many things that
[1:07:43] as a matter of fact what we read in
[1:07:44] Exodus $25 our text God was speaking to
[1:07:48] Moses this was not something that has
[1:07:50] been made known to the people yet yes
[1:07:53] then in Exodus 29 just just a few
[1:07:55] different places God even is making
[1:07:59] known even of the tabernacle how the
[1:08:01] Tabernacles to be set up the pattern of
[1:08:04] it of the garments even with God would
[1:08:07] begin to deal with the different feast
[1:08:09] all of these things God is doing in the
[1:08:12] midst of this time and when he's
[1:08:14] speaking of it I want just to really
[1:08:16] draw our attention to this that God is
[1:08:19] even in verse 43 when he's speaking of
[1:08:22] the the tabernacle I don't need to run
[1:08:25] off and leave you I'm just trying for
[1:08:27] sake of time to keep moving here and in
[1:08:29] Exodus 29 verse 43 he said there I will
[1:08:32] meet with the children of Israel and the
[1:08:34] time and I shall shall be sanctified by
[1:08:36] my goal see it's no it's no maybe God
[1:08:40] said I will can verse 24 I will think
[1:08:44] about the tabernacle congregation and
[1:08:46] the altar
[1:08:47] I will say that I also Aaron and his
[1:08:50] sons to match
[1:08:51] - near the priests office and I will
[1:08:53] dwell among the chair viscera and will
[1:08:55] be their God and they shall know that I
[1:08:58] the LORD their God that brought them
[1:08:59] forth out of the land of Egypt that I
[1:09:01] may dwell about there I have the Lord
[1:09:03] their God and God continues to speak to
[1:09:10] Moses in the midst of this act not keep
[1:09:13] in mind
[1:09:14] God's purpose cannot be defeated God
[1:09:20] continues to speak to Moses in the midst
[1:09:23] of this time and he goes into infinity X
[1:09:26] to the sturdy he speaks about with be
[1:09:30] the the Apocrypha the anointing oil and
[1:09:32] want is to be anointed and you see
[1:09:35] within the whole of it there is
[1:09:36] especially 26 through verse 30 of how
[1:09:39] that Moses instructed by God that all
[1:09:44] things are to be ignited in unity
[1:09:48] see the anointing of God the true
[1:09:51] anointing of the Holy Spirit coming to
[1:09:55] the word moving on the seat of God it
[1:09:57] brings unity it brings unity when God
[1:10:01] came down to look upon the Tower of
[1:10:04] Babel God came down
[1:10:06] did he not but with what they had
[1:10:10] he did not bring unity it brought
[1:10:13] separate so you know a person can say
[1:10:17] well - it got the Holy Ghost we got the
[1:10:19] Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:10:21] the word to make it live you see many of
[1:10:26] the churches the Bible says that God
[1:10:28] would find his spirit upon all flesh and
[1:10:31] look there's many songs it's written
[1:10:33] even for this time there are even not
[1:10:35] believers but the inspiration strikes I
[1:10:38] said what are you going with that with
[1:10:39] the bainham prophesied truth if you
[1:10:43] didn't me his prophecy did not make him
[1:10:45] elect or true but what was spoken was
[1:10:48] what God spoke through me even made of
[1:10:51] Balaam didn't know him as Lord God your
[1:10:53] look in the scriptures they all knew it
[1:10:55] God said
[1:10:56] baby anyway listen you and I can see
[1:10:59] Minnesota but we know that Saint God in
[1:11:01] a personal way and that personal
[1:11:03] relationship yeah Laurie so so you find
[1:11:06] that this unity the Spirit of God by the
[1:11:09] Word of God is set to bring unity and by
[1:11:12] miracles truly there is no unity and
[1:11:15] harmony outside of the body of Jesus
[1:11:17] Christ
[1:11:18] yeah yeah I'm talking about you can make
[1:11:21] people that can be uh sex and different
[1:11:26] things together and they can be a
[1:11:28] harmony around something of the yet
[1:11:30] still is not the harmony that God is
[1:11:33] calling for woo isn't as a harmony that
[1:11:36] God's calling for remember what what
[1:11:38] what when the Lord Jesus was pray in
[1:11:40] John 70 here he is in an intercessory
[1:11:43] prayer that they may be one even as you
[1:11:47] and I want a style art in bi in there
[1:11:51] yes drama - the true brothers it's like
[1:11:56] Welling inside of us because when his
[1:11:59] life is dwelling inside of us in the
[1:12:01] most holy place then it would bring
[1:12:03] every gives us power to bring everything
[1:12:05] else into subjection the first time I

[1:15:21] very if what mean to us it's not just us

[1:15:32] another step forward God becoming one of
[1:15:36] us in relationship and can't folks to us
[1:15:39] it has a meaning to us a great
[1:15:42] significance so here're God is speaking
[1:15:46] and letting this be known i have already
[1:15:49] in wisdom and understanding in knowledge
[1:15:52] in all manner of workmanship is it
[1:15:54] amazing
[1:15:55] listen like somebody talking behind your
[1:15:57] back they're talking about your brother
[1:16:00] Dominick thing you're going to do a job
[1:16:01] they've already get it there they are
[1:16:02] again I got the the program of the plans
[1:16:05] laid out and here you are you you're
[1:16:06] home on Saturday to go on the grass and
[1:16:08] the buses are already saying with I'm
[1:16:09] just going to do this so we're going to
[1:16:10] come out like this really you don't
[1:16:12] really know but then you get back to
[1:16:14] work on Monday morning reality strikes
[1:16:15] done make meetings even your office I
[1:16:17] look at these plans and these things
[1:16:20] right here we were looking at these
[1:16:21] things you've done before and we want to
[1:16:22] see this time
[1:16:23] woo what is it they make known to you
[1:16:25] what they discussed when you want it in
[1:16:27] the presence are you that's a man we
[1:16:30] love those things Oh II don't understand
[1:16:32] but the boss calls you hit you I know my
[1:16:36] prince will come yes a Oh what do you
[1:16:39] want beauty of usual wondering is it
[1:16:41] gonna be more work this is a part of us
[1:16:47] boy we like things to be easy
[1:16:49] thanks for truth we like things to run
[1:16:51] at ease but you know what there's times
[1:16:53] everything is a wall contrast oh my so
[1:16:56] here God is already let it be known of
[1:16:59] these things in even in verse six
[1:17:02] I've given unto out given with him
[1:17:05] around the son of a shimmer of the
[1:17:08] tribal dad and the hearts of all that
[1:17:10] are wise hearted I put wisdom that they
[1:17:12] may make all that I have commanded thee
[1:17:16] so when you come down here all of this
[1:17:19] heavenly vision is taking place but then
[1:17:23] God ends it and he tells Moses to get
[1:17:28] down
[1:17:30] you need to go down the people by people
[1:17:33] have corrupted thyselves oh my you think
[1:17:38] about here Moses at a time of such glory
[1:17:42] in the presence of God right and God at
[1:17:45] the end of it my you know they've
[1:17:48] corrupted themselves know if it's you
[1:17:52] and I knew things oh boy hmm let's take
[1:17:57] the vision and let's mark out Aaron's me
[1:17:59] let's mark out Betsy loves me let's mark
[1:18:02] out and light a lamp
[1:18:05] let's mark out their names because
[1:18:06] surely surely they can't be God must
[1:18:10] have made a mistake
[1:18:11] no God did make a mistake right but
[1:18:14] God's choosing was not based on what
[1:18:16] they were doing I am you with me yeah
[1:18:20] you follow me into the few minutes yes
[1:18:22] so here God makes it known to Moses even
[1:18:26] the probably doesn't say this is what's
[1:18:28] taking place but you have to know they
[1:18:30] turned aside unto other gods of which I
[1:18:33] have commanded them that they should and
[1:18:37] if you notice in here in the scripture
[1:18:39] when Moses comes down and he addresses
[1:18:42] the situation this as well I want you
[1:18:46] just to look at you're very close to
[1:18:49] when God has given a word that it is to
[1:18:54] address to the people of God for that
[1:18:58] generation within that within that word
[1:19:02] God is there to make good on every
[1:19:07] promise
[1:19:08] he's there to see that it comes into
[1:19:12] full manifestation malaria so when you
[1:19:18] see this Moses comes down and Moses
[1:19:21] could see the condition of the people
[1:19:22] the Bible says he saw in Exodus 30 to 20
[1:19:27] values of the people were Nicky and and
[1:19:30] he says that Aaron had made them naked
[1:19:32] no will you look at it the people and
[1:19:36] they begin to come to Aaron Aaron
[1:19:39] himself went along with their pool
[1:19:43] right you see the vision is breaking
[1:19:45] forth but they don't know it right
[1:19:48] God knows they're in this vision they
[1:19:51] don't know they're in the vision you see
[1:19:54] what's taking place is that if that
[1:19:57] vision had truly already broke on their
[1:20:01] lives this would be happening
[1:20:04] but this taking place is showing that
[1:20:07] the vision that God is given to Moses
[1:20:10] has not broken their lives in a night
[1:20:14] vision race there is no offering that
[1:20:18] vision is surety and that vision is what
[1:20:22] God Himself that's already promised I
[1:20:25] right man yes yes so here they're
[1:20:31] they're naked naked mean the word the
[1:20:34] word used you're naked means let loose
[1:20:36] without restraint the people are moving
[1:20:43] with a dedication I hear hear they've
[1:20:45] come out of Egypt they hear a prop that
[1:20:49] a message that yet within it they
[1:20:53] they're not recognizing and have not
[1:20:56] come under the anointing of what is all
[1:20:59] about so what is it give Aaron Erica the
[1:21:03] attack which we recognize Aaron a fight
[1:21:05] of the priesthood and of a of the
[1:21:07] ministry yes but if that ministry is not
[1:21:10] anger the true anointing of that perfect
[1:21:14] one I'm not talking about imagine right
[1:21:16] right you know where you care the Bible
[1:21:18] a certain way to do this eagle but I'm
[1:21:20] not talking about that that fails all
[1:21:22] right
[1:21:23] that kind of stuff producers go to tests
[1:21:25] right see God move but yet it's what's
[1:21:32] what God's desire is he wants to meet
[1:21:35] that same God living inside of you and
[1:21:38] me
[1:21:41] 2004 he told me said don't you make an
[1:21:45] image
[1:21:45] welcome to the winged fowl behalf or
[1:21:47] likely any four-footed beast or anything
[1:21:49] of this era why because God had already
[1:21:53] ordained that it would be his image
[1:21:56] living inside of Shakeology hey hey man
[1:22:04] - close the sock
[1:22:05] that's his iPhone Luud so this is
[1:22:08] nakedness that come upon the people he's
[1:22:11] recognizing there without restraint
[1:22:13] there's no leadership and I don't think
[1:22:15] we need to head is not a rocket science
[1:22:17] we see that with where the people of
[1:22:19] this time of this age that even though
[1:22:22] they can have the Bible but yet even in
[1:22:25] having the Bible without having Christ
[1:22:27] and South has the integrity of that word
[1:22:30] and living that word out the people
[1:22:33] there's no standard to all the people
[1:22:35] you find them giving whereas getting
[1:22:37] better that's why there is no answer to
[1:22:40] sin the only answer to the same question
[1:22:43] yes the blood of Jesus Christ the way to
[1:22:52] repeal it yes sir you might say go send
[1:22:55] a handle some people right now that I
[1:22:57] mean they think the rid of there's some
[1:22:59] holy and purchase I'll say my god I
[1:23:01] really mean that friends yes I really
[1:23:03] mean it hey guy said do you believe
[1:23:05] there's some people out there that are
[1:23:06] not compromised understand I sure do
[1:23:08] there are they're anointed for where
[1:23:10] they're supposed to be a little my heart
[1:23:11] yes but but the thing of it is is that
[1:23:14] what we see in the midst of this hour
[1:23:17] and this age to wear that the people
[1:23:19] there is no shrimp to a stand was coming
[1:23:24] on what must I do compromise how do they
[1:23:27] have no access to the authority and the
[1:23:30] power of the Spirit of God although they
[1:23:33] can be amazing but they don't have
[1:23:34] access
[1:23:37] now a cheap way and goes mad bad light
[1:23:40] travels through use work
[1:23:42] hurry up so then they have to make
[1:23:44] compromises they have to look at things
[1:23:47] and say well oh you know I think it's
[1:23:50] okay to have you know homosexuality in
[1:23:53] gays in the church and things like I
[1:23:54] wanna I just watch back in December a
[1:23:56] whole round table of of different
[1:23:58] pastors and things like that and these
[1:23:59] different pastor to say they said we
[1:24:02] would sat down all of our worship
[1:24:03] leaders they said this is we would lose
[1:24:09] you we lose you set them all down
[1:24:11] because of that they said so we believe
[1:24:13] there's room in the church for it might
[1:24:16] be room in a church but there's not room
[1:24:17] in the body there's not even room for
[1:24:25] anything outside of Christ himself
[1:24:27] oh yeah notice the importance now
[1:24:33] they're naked and this is the same
[1:24:37] scripture that uses the same word that's
[1:24:40] used naked here and this scripture is
[1:24:43] where there is no vision the people
[1:24:45] perish all right that same word perish
[1:24:48] is the same word that used make it there
[1:24:49] without restraint so a vision that God's
[1:24:55] word God by his Spirit giving thought of
[1:24:59] his word and that word taking hold upon
[1:25:02] the people when you and I are our people
[1:25:04] of vision it's not just people as we
[1:25:06] said moments ago that look back to a
[1:25:08] passage we talked about we talked about
[1:25:10] what God did what God did but we have we
[1:25:12] have an experience you don't way we can
[1:25:14] know what God should have did back there
[1:25:15] if you have to have an experience right
[1:25:17] now right now and not attach you back
[1:25:21] there but it also gives you your
[1:25:22] destined a thank you when you look back
[1:25:26] and see what God did that you know where
[1:25:29] Congress is moving and gives you
[1:25:31] stability in this aisle

[1:25:40] my strength
[1:25:40] yes it rose up just up on my flesh they
[1:25:45] stumbled oh yeah yeah alright so there
[1:25:50] we are
[1:25:50] vision or because it is no vision the
[1:25:53] people will perish
[1:25:55] yes it says the vision itself is not
[1:25:58] just a Bible right the vision itself is
[1:26:01] not just fiction books right
[1:26:03] the vision is the divine revelation
[1:26:05] wrought by the holy ghost himself lujah

[1:28:20] show me just think sometimes you know
[1:28:22] hardest you can read in the message

[1:28:26] know what it is but I know something
[1:28:27] that I keep bringing this back to you
[1:28:29] you keep bringing anybody I don't know
[1:28:30] what it is but will you show them you
[1:28:32] know hey mess portly show me but let it
[1:28:35] be my life hey yeah you love it yeah let
[1:28:44] me try to move here your Moses he comes
[1:28:47] in at this time and God from Moses Moses
[1:28:53] he stands in the breech in this time
[1:28:56] pepper God has told Moses here that he
[1:29:01] is going to destroy the people he says
[1:29:04] I'll raise up a uh I recently bought it
[1:29:08] yourself right so when you're looking at
[1:29:10] this the Bible says in Psalm 106 23
[1:29:14] therefore he said that he would destroy
[1:29:15] them had not Moses his chosen stood
[1:29:20] before him building a bridge to turn
[1:29:22] away his wrath lest he should destroy it
[1:29:25] you know was something greater that God
[1:29:29] saw him Moses yes it went ahead much go
[1:29:33] in the flesh but it was the Spirit of
[1:29:35] Christ that was there in Moses he was
[1:29:39] seeing he was seeing the cross you seen
[1:29:41] have you seen sacrifice they're coming
[1:29:45] through Moses hallelujah I want you to
[1:29:48] just to take this just just for a moment
[1:29:49] because you see there are promises that
[1:29:52] God has made in his word there's
[1:29:54] promises of healing yes many promises
[1:29:57] and there are distance a tional promises
[1:30:00] which are identified with the light and
[1:30:03] in that it also includes all other
[1:30:06] promises of healing
[1:30:07] so there are times where God is visiting
[1:30:11] to make a promise that he is made to a
[1:30:15] people to a generation just like uh you
[1:30:18] know finding how in the problem was here
[1:30:20] on the scene and how how often you had
[1:30:22] people that were rising up and they had
[1:30:23] a you know
[1:30:24] Elijah's garment your different things
[1:30:26] was rising up have Elijah's garment and
[1:30:28] all of these things why because it was
[1:30:31] to try to take away from what God was
[1:30:34] getting right that's he same we'll do
[1:30:37] that yes sir um how was I had hours the
[1:30:41] preacher back in you see God mess us up
[1:30:47] oh shut that guy up down there removing
[1:30:50] his voice going to go out there going to
[1:30:52] write the book God and shake this come
[1:30:53] then but you know what God's Word will
[1:30:56] not return boy it is also that we are
[1:31:04] children of God that the word asked me
[1:31:08] just keys to set my sheep Laura a
[1:31:19] manatee because he looks different if
[1:31:22] because of his presence his person it
[1:31:25] moves upon us and we're like that boy
[1:31:27] who calls the train with amnesia you
[1:31:30] start getting into familiar territory
[1:31:33] man and all of a sudden start walking
[1:31:36] what is it we're in place of that are
[1:31:39] familiar to us though it seems like I
[1:31:41] never been here before but yes you were
[1:31:44] you are always in the mind of God do I
[1:31:46] always have taken this word becoming
[1:31:50] flesh Oh
[1:31:54] a word that God is sin now watch how God
[1:32:03] he looks at Moses but when Moses coming
[1:32:06] down and God tells Moses fat people that
[1:32:10] tells Moses that you have corrupted
[1:32:13] themselves Moses never looked at it as
[1:32:17] his people
[1:32:18] Moses turns right around in the
[1:32:20] scripture and Moses begins to if we
[1:32:24] could say rebuke God and say Lord Lord
[1:32:28] God you brought these people out these
[1:32:32] are backing now wait a minute we got we
[1:32:35] got an argument going on your people
[1:32:36] know that your people your people know
[1:32:39] they're your people so are we talking
[1:32:41] about the flesh man Moses oh these all
[1:32:44] mozart's it's the promise that God has
[1:32:50] spoken and when God has made a promise
[1:32:53] he who feels it by his spirit so it was
[1:32:58] the Spirit of Christ when God was
[1:33:01] looking at Moses he was looking at the
[1:33:04] flesh of Moses and saying there are your
[1:33:06] people
[1:33:07] he was looking at Christ it's all high
[1:33:10] and he said these are high people
[1:33:13] hey Christ's these concepts there are
[1:33:16] your people
[1:33:17] oh the father hath given me shop coming
[1:33:21] to me and I will not lose one the right
[1:33:26] Paul said all that our Christ our gods
[1:33:28] so here it's recognize it thank God for
[1:33:32] that
[1:33:32] because if it had not been that the
[1:33:35] people were all in a ticket taken by
[1:33:37] that word but Christ there is no
[1:33:39] intercessor
[1:33:40] but see what God has made a word like
[1:33:43] God moved on day to try to find a place
[1:33:46] to build the tabernacle is that right
[1:33:48] but David couldn't bring it too fast the
[1:33:51] Solomon brought it in the manifestation
[1:33:53] there are same same God moving and
[1:33:57] working to bring and fulfill his
[1:33:59] promises Oh glory be to God so when we
[1:34:04] when we notice and we look at it that
[1:34:06] how God
[1:34:07] he's moving within this it's where that
[1:34:11] Moses he took God remember my servants a
[1:34:16] brand Isaac and he says of Israel thy
[1:34:21] servants whom thou swearest by thine own
[1:34:25] self and it goes on to everything he's
[1:34:28] calling it God to what his word because
[1:34:32] God won't step off his horse brought a
[1:34:35] human stepovers word and the God in you
[1:34:40] and in me if any part of us steps over
[1:34:43] the word if God it you or me brings us
[1:34:46] back you what brother some of that could
[1:34:50] happen
[1:34:51] oh brother balanced and it was clicked
[1:34:54] in that material he's looking at the
[1:34:57] woman and he sees a dress the way she is
[1:34:59] and the policeman has his arm around her
[1:35:00] anyways the old God Huskies he lets us
[1:35:03] stand on this right how can the critical
[1:35:05] spirit yes sir all right yes how dead
[1:35:09] brother branches got caught him to the
[1:35:11] side and dropping into talks with every
[1:35:13] rep says I realized he said that how was
[1:35:15] just hate my brother member wearing
[1:35:19] short britches you wanting a halter top
[1:35:21] but its spirit yes sir is had to she got
[1:35:27] it looks deeper
[1:35:28] I'm he has a bringing back in mind
[1:35:30] whatever I do is the door for you yes it
[1:35:34] brought things back in I didn't see was
[1:35:36] stepping over what God's grace to you
[1:35:38] that's that's the only thing God is
[1:35:41] great by spirit that separates us from
[1:35:44] the rest of the world it may have not
[1:35:47] raised grace would be said in first
[1:35:48] moment he said you'd be going right
[1:35:51] overhead right brother eyes would
[1:35:52] because of his grace God has given us
[1:35:55] understanding just like what's it
[1:35:58] concern head backs it up
[1:35:59] he said I feel dualism deliver my spirit
[1:36:03] and understand it but you are on day to
[1:36:06] understand
[1:36:07] I know sometimes I feel like what I
[1:36:08] don't understand you don't help me to
[1:36:10] see this yes so help me to see this you
[1:36:12] are dating for no sender why am I not
[1:36:14] understanding it why am I not seeing it
[1:36:16] the way I need to because God want you
[1:36:18] to pray - had people down through the
[1:36:24] ages where a church would start and they
[1:36:26] begin to seek after God where the Spirit
[1:36:28] of God but then the congrat children
[1:36:30] struggle having it they come up and they
[1:36:32] alder seek after God and begin to take
[1:36:34] what the founders have said without
[1:36:37] having a personal experience
[1:36:39] we're very much listen to you follow
[1:36:43] after I let this be right things I'm
[1:36:45] good and they fail to recognize God
[1:36:47] moving out of there next oh yeah they
[1:36:51] don't see after God yes yes God most
[1:36:55] people go seek every hallelujah hey hey
[1:37:00] so he calls his attention to his word
[1:37:02] and God can't step over his word you see
[1:37:06] that word for the outer which God had
[1:37:10] spoke to Abraham it was just a couple
[1:37:14] verses there in Genesis 15 here's God
[1:37:16] fulfilling that word there was a message
[1:37:20] that was there and that message in
[1:37:22] Genesis 15 were guarded spoke out
[1:37:24] delivered with a mighty hand
[1:37:26] it was seal up but when it came time
[1:37:29] forgot to move the seal was ruggedness
[1:37:33] and the commandments that were inside of
[1:37:37] that word come forth yes His
[1:37:40] commandments is his will make no there's
[1:37:43] a protection for our life within those
[1:37:45] two verse of scripture I've seen you
[1:37:47] don't see Moses name in there do it
[1:37:51] while I things not in the Bible they're
[1:37:53] right who's the first one to call Moses
[1:37:55] name hero's sister God that was it was
[1:38:05] it was it not Moses was his name not to
[1:38:06] be Moses it was God move
[1:38:11] it and no us even in your own life there
[1:38:14] might be things are you in the back
[1:38:15] maybe you don't see family or middle
[1:38:17] like us a strong spiritual journey but
[1:38:19] let me tell you something God I just
[1:38:22] stand upon your life yes God he Lucia
[1:38:28] he's knew where you were at yea or nay
[1:38:32] men and that word when that word rose up
[1:38:35] notice here in this time when Moses is
[1:38:39] coming down from the mountain and he
[1:38:42] stands on behalf of the people and
[1:38:45] programs has no normal thinking man
[1:38:47] would do this the Spirit of Christ why
[1:38:50] it was the achievement of Christ in
[1:38:53] Moses that was moving on behalf of the
[1:38:56] people there that you see that's why he
[1:38:59] takes the holy spirit taking the word
[1:39:01] breaking it to our hearts and to our
[1:39:04] life as he stands as the high priest of
[1:39:07] his own word oh yeah hey I always think
[1:39:10] how brother Barry stumbling in him in
[1:39:11] the middle I think it was in adoption
[1:39:13] part one he stopped all by the devil did
[1:39:15] you get it he said he is a high priest
[1:39:17] of his own word my failures but he's a
[1:39:25] high priest of his word he releases to
[1:39:28] you and I the strength that we got
[1:39:30] neither back a performs in my life the
[1:39:33] way that he is or they gonna let me
[1:39:39] support and minister to us in this time
[1:39:42] one you understand you and I want to
[1:39:44] understand understand taxable but yet he
[1:39:49] reaches clear back and he moves from
[1:39:52] that with just spent eternity and it
[1:39:54] gets to a fall to you have that vision
[1:39:56] that we did even though we were part of
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:03] yeah I guess the stabilizer door hey it
[1:40:07] gets close to rise above us that
[1:40:11] dedication luigi's I'm alluding it
[1:40:13] because God already if God is calling
[1:40:16] you and I I'm coming down as God calls
[1:40:19] you and I say dedication he don't call
[1:40:23] you a knight to something and he's not
[1:40:26] already example of hallelujah God is
[1:40:30] dedicated yes yes he's dedicated let me
[1:40:36] show you look at the strength of this
[1:40:38] dedication clear back before Adam
[1:40:41] Stardust or molecule before you I ever
[1:40:43] had a need the Bible said the lamb lamb
[1:40:47] was slain dry what a foundation Thank
[1:40:51] You Marty before there was ever a devil
[1:40:55] God the lamb was slain sure the color
[1:41:03] hey it's not like you're going to build
[1:41:06] something and then after a while we get
[1:41:07] the looking at academic this more sure
[1:41:09] how God made it sure that's why we this
[1:41:15] is the church when that came that's why
[1:41:18] Paul could reach back and say brag
[1:41:20] forget don't even get consumed with all
[1:41:23] this the foundation of the Lord
[1:41:25] standard are his a lure they met God's
[1:41:31] foundation is sure and their the lamb
[1:41:34] slain over you and I all that we would
[1:41:38] have need of glory see God as a prophet
[1:41:42] could put it like this when you look at
[1:41:44] it in the scripture in Romans 8 for all
[1:41:48] he whom he did foreknow yes then he also
[1:41:51] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:41:54] image of his son can I have about 10
[1:41:55] more minutes sir yes sir
[1:41:57] don't let me do it I'm asked for 10 more
[1:41:58] I just want to get get us to a place
[1:42:01] here just a feeling just to come to this
[1:42:03] place there yeah this is cause God's and
[1:42:08] I don't want to just say determine
[1:42:10] because God Himself being determined or
[1:42:13] perseverant it must be perseverance is
[1:42:16] own
[1:42:16] Buffy you can only have perseverance we
[1:42:20] have faith that God doesn't have faith
[1:42:25] in anything but it's word could be
[1:42:31] perseverant we cannot these perseverance
[1:42:34] unless there is faith and we cannot
[1:42:36] faith he had got to us a measure here in
[1:42:46] order to be persevered
[1:42:47] God is showing his perseverance yes we
[1:42:51] did foreknow then he also did
[1:42:52] predestinate any prick to be conformed
[1:42:54] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:42:55] the first ornament many brothers wonder
[1:42:57] whom he did predestinate Amy also called
[1:42:59] when we called them II also just the
[1:43:01] back whom he justified them he also
[1:43:02] glorified
[1:43:04] yes all right ho goes on to say here
[1:43:06] what shall we say to these things if God
[1:43:09] be for us who can be against what can
[1:43:12] you say what can you say beat him to me
[1:43:16] Lord
[1:43:16] yeah according to thy will oh yeah yes
[1:43:20] this is where the public could say in
[1:43:22] question from answer I believe this year
[1:43:26] he said I just wanted mean it is so good
[1:43:29] yes Lord I mean this is just like eating
[1:43:31] the top edge of a cherry pie you got to
[1:43:33] you know all of them I don't want to
[1:43:35] just crusts and he goes into how I are
[1:43:38] Oh predestination and here we are
[1:43:42] grilling in the body of Jesus Christ I
[1:43:43] want spirit we are baptized into one
[1:43:45] body
[1:43:45] he said now now you have been called
[1:43:49] like that I want to speak chosen ones
[1:43:51] that God chosen him before the
[1:43:52] foundation world think of that God chose
[1:43:55] us in him before the foundation of the
[1:43:56] world God knew before the foundation
[1:43:59] world that I speak the same subject
[1:44:01] tonight he's different
[1:44:02] and before there was a world is a group
[1:44:05] get the Holy Ghost now the word the word
[1:44:08] will bring it that's how it come up here
[1:44:10] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:44:11] fell on them yes before there was a
[1:44:14] world you were in God's thoughts to get
[1:44:16] ahead ago because he him that you'd be
[1:44:20] watching it yeah
[1:44:23] what as it was in his mind to give it to
[1:44:25] me why did he just give it to me
[1:44:27] because he had to raise if you the
[1:44:31] desire to receive me sanctuary my MA and
[1:44:39] he chose you himself all he said he
[1:44:42] chose you in crash fit for you or Jesus
[1:44:45] any of you was on the earth and he sent
[1:44:48] Jesus to die to prepare the way to send
[1:44:51] the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself
[1:44:53] all he says to fake it's not what I
[1:44:56] wanted it wasn't my desires
[1:44:59] it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing
[1:45:01] I not one thing to do with it but before
[1:45:05] the world ever started God Souls and put
[1:45:07] our name on the Lamb's Book a lot before
[1:45:09] there was even a world oh he's here oh
[1:45:12] my god Laurie God's purpose cannot be
[1:45:17] defeat
[1:45:17] yes so then all of this has been spoken
[1:45:22] Karen and his sons shall minister unto
[1:45:24] me in the priest's office thou shalt
[1:45:27] anoint you bet solo film i have already
[1:45:30] filled him with the spirit with my
[1:45:32] spirit yes it will happen I think I've
[1:45:35] got that right and I'll say right all of
[1:45:37] this God has spoken
[1:45:40] it's already and we see that even by we
[1:45:43] had a vision that we're looking at right
[1:45:45] here you and I being in God's mind but
[1:45:49] you see when Moses the sins here the
[1:45:54] people are all deserted there has to
[1:45:57] come forth direction by virtue of God
[1:46:01] the dedication
[1:46:03] yes and that has to come dedication to
[1:46:07] his word that he's spoken to his promise
[1:46:10] see God's promise it couldn't or it
[1:46:13] wouldn't be the overriding of his own
[1:46:15] nature and we'll right amen so here what
[1:46:19] God has spoken
[1:46:20] I watched let me just the majestic drop
[1:46:22] in this God brings forth his children by
[1:46:27] his word that's right
[1:46:29] amen that's why a word it must take the
[1:46:33] word and inspiration by the spirit of
[1:46:36] up for this moment for this time this
[1:46:38] hour the Luthor's word or weapons whir
[1:46:43] although there was truth there but that
[1:46:46] would not take effect upon you and I
[1:46:49] today I believe that we can hear that
[1:46:51] and we can live a true are justified by
[1:46:54] faith I'm seeking the Lord by faith I'm
[1:46:56] saying sure we can live there and hear
[1:46:59] it that Wesley's message I talked about
[1:47:01] some some method is that was kill
[1:47:03] preacher real save the fine gospel we
[1:47:06] can say Amen a really nice event but I
[1:47:09] hear that out of the dish being restored
[1:47:12] back to the Church of the Living God
[1:47:13] we could say amen amen you must be a
[1:47:18] word telling birth Amen Alleluia not
[1:47:23] bring back to you and I remember as we
[1:47:26] said at the beginning there's got to be
[1:47:28] a death before life comes oh yeah yeah

[1:47:33] going now even when you find people that
[1:47:35] you're walking away saying I just want
[1:47:37] to Jesus or love he does love us you can
[1:47:39] say one of us take a look at this apply
[1:47:48] the fingers of God takes a word to move
[1:47:56] upon our lives in this hour to do up
[1:47:58] break away all those things
[1:48:01] everything around us to do what free for
[1:48:04] that which God himself has sown unto
[1:48:08] himself
[1:48:08] that's what Paul could say the gospel of
[1:48:11] your salvation you you you believe it
[1:48:13] when you hate but after you believe yeah
[1:48:16] I was working bringing forth got close

[1:49:07] labor yes yeah this really it's true it

[1:50:15] be you know when all this vision takes
[1:50:18] place here in the scriptures the God is
[1:50:21] like he puts a pause button and you put
[1:50:22] all this on hold yeah what does he tell
[1:50:25] Moses to finish the tabernacle out there
[1:50:27] at the base of the mountain that word
[1:50:29] kappa not enough sanctuary that come
[1:50:32] forth yet but the tabernacle yeah push
[1:50:34] pitch the tabernacle and the people must
[1:50:36] go out to the tabernacle
[1:50:38] oh they will seek after God and that
[1:50:39] tabernacle is that altar that was built
[1:50:42] at the base of the month a man see in
[1:50:45] order for you an act to become the
[1:50:47] sanctuary God had to become tired
[1:50:50] they had to become a tabernacle that
[1:50:52] would be one man in the lattice of
[1:50:55] single flesh that through the shedding
[1:50:56] of his blood at that life might be
[1:50:58] imparted that
[1:51:00] you see prices cut it all up and say
[1:51:03] after he went through among the people a
[1:51:05] notice out Moses is going about the
[1:51:07] Spirit of God Moses ethical down here
[1:51:10] abuse Aaron and here the column of
[1:51:12] people into repentance and and he says
[1:51:14] who's on the launch site come stand by
[1:51:16] me yes he was got spokesman in an hour
[1:51:21] yes yeah you want to be on God's side
[1:51:22] you're on Moses side today because Moses
[1:51:26] was God's representative I I've got a
[1:51:30] straw Christ identified by his own
[1:51:34] characteristics yes Amen Peter got so as
[1:51:37] he's standing there remember the people
[1:51:39] could not the people had not the power
[1:51:41] to come into acceptance under God when
[1:51:44] it Moses say I'll go make a tournament
[1:51:45] for you
[1:51:46] amen he didn't go through the lamb it
[1:51:50] was it was that sacrificial life that
[1:51:53] was the true sacrifice right there the
[1:51:56] body itself true that there had to be a
[1:51:57] a virgin born body a blood that was not
[1:52:00] created between that of a man and a
[1:52:02] woman it had to be better blood that
[1:52:04] will wash you a nap but what was it
[1:52:05] going to release oh I
[1:52:07] and that sacrificial blood come back
[1:52:09] upon us is the worship
[1:52:12] call you and I into sacrifice Laurie
[1:52:14] here is Moses I go to make an atonement
[1:52:17] Moses comes down what does he do
[1:52:19] God kills him and he speaks God says
[1:52:22] tell the people I'm not gonna go in a
[1:52:23] moment yes I'm not gonna go mom let's
[1:52:25] say smile all of the mercy of God yes
[1:52:29] and under people or they do repent they
[1:52:32] begin to strip themselves of all one of
[1:52:34] us why what at work I'm just happy to
[1:52:37] look at is that even though what God has
[1:52:40] internal it is God who comes to stir
[1:52:44] those things up in you and Miriam who
[1:52:47] desire and asked for what He desires to
[1:52:51] give a men it already belongs to you
[1:52:55] they have put you must rise and take the
[1:52:57] you must make it yours that's why Paul
[1:53:00] could say I seek to apprehend that which

[1:53:08] all in your life

[1:53:28] labor is not our works that labor is
[1:53:31] faith yielding to him is being drawn to
[1:53:36] fall in love with him or you find how
[1:53:39] that God comes and he quickens it and
[1:53:41] the love of God is shed abroad in your
[1:53:44] heart by the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[1:53:47] Ghost is God yes and God is love it is
[1:53:51] the love of God in you then the love of
[1:53:55] God is love you love him you desire to

[1:54:31] yes you know what happened they knew
[1:54:34] that their new they've been a prophetic
[1:54:35] ministry but they needed leadership to
[1:54:37] go for one case to be a bangle there was
[1:54:39] misery if the Lord Jesus had not spent
[1:54:43] the forty days not only showing
[1:54:44] infallible proofs but the Bible says
[1:54:46] speaking things pertaining the kingdom
[1:54:48] of God he who came back to give them you
