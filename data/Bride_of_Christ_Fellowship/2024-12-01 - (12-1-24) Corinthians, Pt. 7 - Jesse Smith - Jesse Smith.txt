========================================

verse 8 we'll just read that one verse and then we'll have you have a word of prayer and be seated by the grace of the Lord 1 Corinthians 3:8 Hallelujah we'll just read this verse and then we'll have a word of Prayer appreciate everyone's uh support on Wednesday night you know we had guest there sister Paige and I kind of as soon as uh someone told me I think Casa told me as soon as she told me um Paige was visiting instantly I felt like the Lord put that on my heart to go through water baptism and the cross dressing and uh that's why I was crying you know at the beginning of service because I was like oh Lord just please open her heart my wife and I both got saved in college and I thought oh God it would be so special so we's just keep praying by God's grace and um you know I just see a lot of myself and my wife you know you in that in that stage of Our Lives where we didn't know better you know we were just living the the best we knew and then when the message came it changed everything by God's grace so I just trust some of those pictures and some of those uh you know timelines and so forth would uh you know just show the Simplicity of the revelation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 3:8 let's read this together on three one two three now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor let's have one more word of prayer if you have any on your heart let's make it known unto God today Father God we love you today Lord God thank you Lord that we can be your friend Lord God hallelujah and we know Lord you said whosoever will let him come and drink of the Waters of Life freely Lord I want to be one of those whosoever will Lord God hallelujah I believe I Am Lord God Hallelujah Lord Jesus you offered it to anyone so Lord we believe it's for for us today Lord God that we can be the friend of God we can drink the Waters of life we can enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost Lord thank you God for giving us such Grace love and provision and mercy Lord God we just want to give you thanks today Lord God and Father God I pray you take Lord this humble vessel take my preparation and Lord my dedication Lord whatever I would give to you Lord I pray you just use it for your glory god I just give myself as a Living Sacrifice unto you Lord God Use Me For Your Glory Bless the people use them Lord may they pull on the gift of God God and Lord we just ask that the Holy Spirit would Minister to all the needs of the people today Father we know there's life in your word we know there's strength in your word we know your word is infallible unchanging immutable unchangeable so father God we worship you and give you honor and praise we know you're here today to meet our needs in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you being seated praise God good to see the Saints today you can switch over I do have a few uh scriptures there so we're looking at part seven here today um the book of First Corinthians I just remember brother random preached you know numerous series uh entire books of the Bible preach through job Revelation and uh Hebrews other books of the Bible he preached so uh we're making our way slowly through here and I just pray and meditate and as I study I just wait to see what the Lord would uh bring to my uh memory by God's grace and anything that would be revealed I just want to preach it by the grace of God so I want to start with this quote as was listening last night and this morning to uh I was listening again to this short it's a short Sunday school lesson brother Bram gives to the adults it's an adult Sunday school and he says we notice Paul Could Teach the Ephesians there how that before the foundation of world they were predestinated unto the adoption of the sons of God now don't you know that today Church you're predestinated to be adopted you're not to be a servant you're to be a son and daughter with authority Hallelujah just like uh my children Malachi Lydia Casa everybody they all have access to my fridge right they all have access to my vehicles you know they have the authority of being under me as a as a father right and that's what we got with God we have authority with God hallelujah we're so thankful that we're adopted we're not just servants or or or slaves or something like that we are uh the children of God adopted into the family with full rights of of the of the family of God hallelujah the Corinthians didn't know nothing about that so think about that they didn't all they knew was like the power the experiences of God they wanted to feel something they wanted to shout something they wanted to speak something they they just wanted to experience God but they didn't have the understanding of their relationship with God hallelujah he said they just had to have a little feeling if they didn't feel something at service if they didn't feel something in prayer they just felt discouraged and well look at the they started sulking around we're going to show that quote in a little bit they started feeling bad and they always had to have a feeling instead of the revelation of who they were Hallelujah now don't get me wrong there's times we need both Hallelujah well well I'm sorry there's times we need we all need the feeling right but what we should always have is the Revelation the understanding of God's love for us and God's constant presence see they just had to have a feeling a sensation they depended on that well if brother Jesse doesn't shout or dance or if sister doesn't scream if if brother doesn't cry at the altar then we didn't have church that's what they depended on on but look what it produced in their lives so much instability so much carnality amongst the the the the church the actual church right they depended on emotion and and feelings and Sensations and Paul couldn't teach them the Deep things of God so I think it's what I think it's great when you got people you can teach deep things and the Holy Spirit can wind these great truths and anchor in the people's heart so that whether they're standing right some people stand some people are laying on their faces you know spiritually speaking crawling just trying to get through life whether you're standing whether you're crawling where you're laying on your back whether that you have a sensation or no sensation prophecy or no prophecy I don't know what what's going to happen in the future I don't know it's okay if you don't know brother raham says whatever it might be now remember I'm not trying to say God does not deal through prophecy and things like that but we don't rely upon that we got a deeper hole than that you see hallelujah how many got a deeper hole than that today I thank God if he gives me a a dream or a prophecy or a word or a feeling or experience a a refilling people say but even if I don't get that I know where I stand with God hallelujah that's what Paul's saying here we got a deeper hold than that and then he said for whoever or whether they prophecies it'll fail tongues they'll cease course he's break it into 1 Corinthians 13 as we preach on two weeks ago by God's grace so I want I just want to start with that that it's a great thing when we can teach the Deep things of God because you've got to know there's going to come a time like I was telling the teenagers there's going to come a time you don't feel things or you don't feel excited anymore or you don't feel extremely happy or joyful and in those moments you have to know that the world can never satisfy any it never can satisfy your soul but God's testing you he's letting you go through a little Valley Hallelujah but the thing is he said I walk with you through the valley Hallelujah so you got to have that anchor you got to have that uh that love of God so that when you don't feel anything and it seems like God's far away you've got the Revelation he loves me anyway hallelujah amen he's just letting me go through a little trial a little test and I just thought you know I was going through these quotes yesterday I just thought I would uh give you a little machine gun here a uh little blessing here a little AR blessing here by God's grace just with some good quotes on uh this on the Bible how important the Bible is to us he said the scripture is all tied together how how the Bible means so much more than it speaks if we can only have the Holy Spirit to interpret it for us we only read it as we look down upon it but oh how the holy spirit says child of mine now listen when you're reading your Bible child of mine you're looking into my face now Church did you look into the face of God this morning Hallelujah I hope you if you didn't yet I hope you do it when you go home look into the face of God this is God's character this is is God's will Hallelujah right before us this is what I want you to know so see God's leading you to to a certain chapter right a certain book he wants you to read through so he can he can show you his character he can show you his fa face Hallelujah May the Holy Spirit take the word of God today and deliver it to every heart just as we have need and we may we Fellowship around the word now Inspire us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen so brother reads the Bible says if you look into this Bible and you'll ask God for something God will give you something today Hallelujah so but you know so often we're distracted to look away from the Bible but God's saying look in the Bible you'll see my face glory amen he says with the oncoming judgments the world is feeling it uh I've heard from the Pentagon you know all these fear tactics well there's only one book can direct you on what to do and that's God's Bible so see when there's all these news reports and all the uncertainty the there's one place you can look for good news that's the word of God that's the only thing that can tell you what to do see the news can't tell you what to do that's lift up your head look up there's no way of Escape right for the world from judgment but there is an escape through the Rapture Hallelujah I like this from God's eye at Calvary everything was finished he was wounded for our transgressions with his Tripes we were healed every sinner here today was saved when Jesus died at Calvary every sick person was healed when Jesus died he finished the work the only thing that God can do now is to anoint ministers to preach the word or set gifts in the church to point you to the finished work of our Lord Jesus Hallelujah see it's already finished Jesus already paid the price for every Redemptive blessing and that's what we need we need God to anoint us God to anoint our preachers God to anoint the gifts in our life to point us to what Christ has already done for us to remind us of the power of the Cross Hallelujah Mich shall saying amen that's right buddy amen hallelujah be not afraid he says oh in that time of Crisis the Revival was over the boat was water loged remember when Jesus was on on the sea everything looked like was gone all hopes was gone but there he was walking on the sea and the strange part about it the only thing that could help them they was afraid of it it looked spooky like remember when Jesus was walking to them and they didn't know what what if it was a spirit or what it was and they cried out for fear that's the same thing today the only thing that can save us is the Bible God's promise and the Holy Spirit with us hallelujah see the devil wants us to get so busy we don't go and and and we we get afraid to we we don't have enough time or we don't have enough time to spend with God but brother R saying Jesus is something that we should run to Hal let's not be afraid of him let's let's remember he's our father he's our friend Hallelujah and so when things are in trouble run to the father Hallelujah run to Jesus he's got all of our answers the Bible has all of our answers Hallelujah it looks spooky to people and they cry out for fear but here come that sweet calm voice be not afraid it is I Be not Afraid church God is speaking through his word the only thing that I know to point man to not a Creed or a sensation of some sort but to those bloody footprints that leads to the Bible the blood of Jesus Christ so if brother R was here people said oh if just brother Ram was here well if he's here he'd point you right to the word that he was preaching Hallelujah so as if is as if he's here because we know what he would say we got it on the tapes Hallelujah the absolute oh my notice your absolute oh I'm going to say something I just feel it coming on notice I feel very religious at this time because this is Assurance so when did Brother feel the happiest when God gave him Assurance of God's character of God's presence your compass can only point to the north star that's the only place it can point to if it's a true Compass it'll strike the North Star every time is that right then if you have the Holy Spirit it can only point to the word it'll never point to denomination it'll never point to a Creed it'll never point it away somewhere It'll point straight to the word I feel like shouting Hallelujah so if you got the Holy Ghost where is it going to point you here right here here constantly back to the word back to the scriptures God will direct you God will feed you God will show you his face as you seek his face Hallelujah notice it's something inside of a man pulsating when you see your star setting out yonder Jesus Christ the word and you see the spirit that's in you won't let you move right or left that's the only one that can he come to take the things of God and show them manifest them that Compass Holy Spirit put him right on the North Star now if You' got something pulling you off it you better leave it alone the sun it'll only point to his word only Point only to his word because the Holy Spirit came to manifest or vindicate God's promise so we we think you know we pray to Jesus and where would he point us he's going to point us find your answer in the word there's safety in the word there's protection in the word there's Grace in the word there's leadership in the word of God hallelujah if you take him as your North Star then that absolutely places the Holy Spirit as your compass amen the holy spirit is your compass and the compass will only point to the north star and if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can only point to Christ and Christ is that word how many more I got of these I got I sure got a lot here he says the Holy Spirit points only to the word man should not live by bread alone but by every word not part of the word but every word all of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that's what a man lives by he's your absolute in your life he's also your North Star Hallelujah and I like this one I think this might be one of my I got a couple yeah I got two more I like I heard found this one yesterday I forgot he said this the word living and in action the Bible bride Hallelujah so how can these people say they're the the bride when they deny the Bible the bride will be one with the Bible because she sees her husband's face in the Bible Hallelujah that's right church not some man-made bride like anybody can call themselves The Bride but the real bride will have her face in the Bible she's pointed to her North Star the Bible Hallelujah so when I thought of that thing a thinking man's filter I thought that's a good idea so there is a thinking man's filter that's this Bible so see everything we hear we got to filter it so I'll just put up your phone here everything we see from the Bible I'm sorry from our phone or wherever we are whatever whatever we're getting input from it's got to come through the filter of God's word hallelujah a thinking man's filter will take this filter it'll produce a righteous man taste Hallelujah now you cannot pull sin through the pages of the Bible so see if you got sin in your life you're not uh your you got you took your filter out you got to put the filter back in hallelujah amen you can't pull sin through the page of the Bible no it stops IT the Bible filters sin out of your life now you can go to church and just take anything but you can't come through this Bible and have sin it will not do it it filters out without a everybody say a sin and it gives a holy man's taste Hallelujah so see you'll see yourself constantly loving the things of God as you stay in the Bible as you stay in the scripture because if a man is thinking that he wants to be holy and be like God be a son or daughter of God then he wants the right kind of filter so he stops all sin on this side of the Bible and he can only bring the Holy Spirit Through the Bible That's wrote the Bible it's a holy man's taste to have this thinking man's filter Hallelujah I just want want to remind you there are quotes where brother R says the fruit of the spirit is the evidence of the Holy Ghost I know later on he says it's receiving your the word for your day but the word for our day includes the fruits of the spirit Allelujah that's where some people fail they say no it's just receiving the word for your day but what is the word isn't Galatians 5 the word for your day Hallelujah of course it is so just be encouraged there's only one thing that's left in the Bible as evidence of the Holy ghost only the fruits of the spirit find out any place that Jesus said so yes sir the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the fruit of your spirit Jesus said so by their fruits you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness meekness and the fruit of the enemy is enmity hatred Mal and strife and so forth that's the fruit of the enemy so you can judge by the way you're living where you're standing with him if your whole heart is in love with him and you love him and are gentle and live with him daily you know your pass from Death unto life Hallelujah if it isn't and you're otherwise you're just impersonating a Christian that's right which all all carnal impersonations will certainly be exposed we know that I'm going to show you something today then on a Wednesday night don't you don't want to miss Wednesday night service if you possibly can because look what brother B gave us on a Wednesday night always don't judge your life by how much power you have for to perform Miracles because uh uh many people did Caiaphas prophesied right what's the one I'm thinking of balum bam had great prophecies power and we don't judge oursel by how much knowledge you have of the word so it's not even just the understanding about it but always judge yourself look back and take an inventory what kind of fruit is the life that you're presently now is bearing take inventory of the fruits of the spirit Hallelujah now let's go back to First Corinthians now so that was my introduction there hope you got a good refresher on the importance of the Bible amen now I know it you know it but it's it's nice to hear a prophet of God say it too now I want to get back to this this is the point I I was laboring a little bit on Wednesday for good purpose I think because our visitor it was helpful for our visitor also to hear that but also for us to remember that too anyone who's causing strife division or contention they're a baby in Christ right I gave that example of uh I think I gave it on a Sunday night uh there were certain individuals going around uh to the to the church uh asking opinions about things and then all of a sudden they come to a certain individual in the church and the church said no let's just stop it uh we're not going to we're not going to take opinions on that and I'm just giving a general story and it stopped the complaining right then and there that's maturity that's a fruit of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's right so see uh 1 Corinthians 3:1 and verse three Paul says there was divisions there arguing well I'm of Apollos I'm a Peter I'm of I'm a Paul I'm just of Christ right that was chapter one I don't need any preachers I just follow Jesus but see babies in Christ they're constantly jealous of others and they they start rivalries other words they're trying to be better than that person or get more attention or trying to bring that person down right and then Strife is contention or debate trying to be smarter than somebody or trying to get one up on somebody well I'm just a little smarter I got a little more Revelation on this when it's not Revelation it's dissension or divisions right dissensions dividing uh certain people not treating everybody the same we should all have the love of God for one another hallelujah amen now this is what I I was I was studying on this and I I just I wanted to to show this and I want to bring this as a balance because I'm going to show you brother Bram said he was already a holy ghost filed Prophet brother Ram said he he sinned and God rebuked him and he pouted about it for a few weeks pouting like a baby complaining so I'm just going to show this what happens so what I'm saying is that sometimes we act like babies in our human spirits but our souls can be born again now in the case of Corin Corinth looks like most of them weren't born again that's what it looks like because there's so much sin in the church but I want to encourage you though too even a holy ghost filled person can sometimes pout around and be sulky Hallelujah there's only two sulk quotes in the whole message so I thought well this is perfect see so the word so what does sulk mean uh you're Moody silent you ever you ever be around you know sometimes every people are real joyful but then sometimes they're just so quiet like how come we're not how come I'm not saying amen like I usually do am how come I'm not smiling and I'm how come I'm so quiet like I I I I shouldn't I'm normally not quiet like this you ever noticed that some people used to be dancing or shouting around and pretty soon then they're all sulky and quiet that's immaturity right now I'm not saying every service we got to be shouting and dancing and screaming and spitting all over the place like me and I'm not even like that any every service either know we all go through trials we all go through tests but I'm showing you the Bible ible says sometimes we act like babies right sometimes we act immature but God's going to help us to overcome it by God's grace so see moodily silent some people act Moody and they get quiet on God right brother Bram tells us this oh but brother bradam I spoke with tongues I shouted I spoke I prophesied that don't make any difference what you've done many will come to me and say Lord Lord have I not done this and that but right down the depths of your heart has all the world died and Christ just took over now something just moves you every day in Love no matter how things come you're still in love the skies are blue always to you that's a good rhyme no matter what happens God is on the throne he's answering prayer working everything for you that'll make you happy when you realize God's working everything for my good Hallelujah may not be comfortable but it's working out for my good neighbors talk about you somebody ridicules you or the church tell you you have to do this or that and you don't want to do it but do you just but you just pick up your cross with a sweet smile and go on towards Calvary my neighbor said that oh I'm going to get that back I'm just still going to smile and love them well praise God this is my cross I just got to bear this cross God help me Lord if you took up a cross surely I can take up a cross because greater is he that that's in me than he that's in the world hallelujah hallelujah or do you stand off and soak now how many times have we seen that people don't get what they want so they sulk around they're just Moody silent oh I seen a lot is a preacher Hallelujah people that one day shouting and uh rejoicing next service don't even look at me don't even sing don't can't even raise their hands what's wrong something's wrong with that church Hallelujah but brother says see or when when you get trials do you Suk Moody quiet and say I'm not going back anymore I'm through with that old bunch of people anyhow that that's the spirit in you that isn't the holy spirit amen hallelujah will you raise your hand and say God right in the spirit that I have my new spirit give me your Holy Spirit make me live a Victorious life so see a Victorious Life is someone that won't be silent they won't get moody they won't they won't deny God praise because he's worthy of Praise he's with me on the Mountaintop he's with me in the valley he's with me all the time he said he never forsake me so that means everything's going to work out hallelujah it's all eventually going to work out praise God he's never going to leave me praise God he won't leave me and let me be lost and let me go to hell no sir he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me I'm already saved amen hallelujah make me live a Victorious Life what does brother R say a lot of times people get suky moodily silent and church don't feel bad sometimes it happened to brother Ram too remember God healed remember uh uh God saved that woman who had almost drowned uh no God healed her uh yeah God God saved the woman that almost drowned she got saved she got healed uh brother was rejoicing but then she died died right after she got saved and brother bam said I don't know what caused me to do it but I said Lord God you owe me an understanding see after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the oh yeah God even saved her husband and him coming to the Lord after You' done these things and all that then take that girl's life that mother's life I said you owe me an understanding well when you tell God something like that he'll leave you sitting alone I he he don't owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well he just let me pouted out for a few days you know anybody ever felt sorry for themselves for a few days it's called self-pity if you don't know what it's called you feel sorry oh my life's so hard and this person did that to me this person did this to me my life's not going the way I wanted and we pout around like a baby right Hallelujah right and so see even a mature Holy Ghost philled Christian sometimes can get that way now they're not going to stay that way but they can go through that for uh a few days a few days what you owe me this God you why don't I have this in my life you I deserve this I should have this already God what's wrong with you nothing's wrong with God something's wrong with us hallelujah and after about three or four months one day I was out in the creek bank and the Lord told me a vision said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not the time come that year before that when she was drown in the creek on a picnic you she should have went and died at that time right but I had to take her when she was when she was ready to go after she got saved Hallelujah so I just want to show you that you know sometimes we just Place babies that oh they just got baptized they're still living in sin but I also want to show you sometimes even mature Christians can act like babies sometimes but what is God faithful to do God is faithful to bring us out of it to correct us help us to be more mature Hallelujah that's right that's right so God help us we don't want to be uh suky because David said I he said instead of being sulky David said I'm going to cry out to God he's my rock and he says be not silent to me less if thou be silent to me I become like them that go down to the pit hear the voice of thy supplications when I cry unto thee when I lift my hands toward thy holy Oracle so when things weren't going David's way he didn't sit there and just pout I'm not going to say Amen I'm not going to pray David said Lord hear my prayer Hallelujah I need to hear from you see we don't don't want to be silent Moody silent or soaking around babying around Hallelujah he says it again here oh Lord and have mercy on me Lord be thou my helper thou has turned for me my mour into dancing oh let's have Victory hallelujah amen let's have an assurance let's we know God gives us a promise we'll get back to the same season that we were in kaisha said as we walked in today why did why did God allow winter that's a good question but if we didn't have winter we wouldn't enjoy summer amen all right it's the law of contrast and wean I know she was joking I'm joking too but see we got to have these we got to go through diff the season will come around we'll have another season of Joy we'll have another season of Dancing Hallelujah thou has put off my sackcloth and GED me with gladness God has done it God will help you take off your your mourner clothes and and your your poutin God will help you put that and I help you put on some clothes some garments of praise to the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee and not be silent so what is the end of this what is God's goal God's goal is so that you will be loudly giving him praise you'll be thankful you'll be careful to worship him and give him praise that's the whole goal of this God wants a worshipper who's who doesn't want to be silent doesn't want to be selfish but they want to give a sacrifice of praise oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever hallelujah oh my now let's keep going here we went through verses 1-8 on Wednesday for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry God's Building so of course husbandry uh would be like the orchard right uh God planted you in a certain Orchard God planted you in the orchard of akan Hallelujah now sometimes he uproots you right sometimes he takes you from Texas to akan right but God can do that God can transplant right but you're still God's Orchard now if he's if you're Orchard he's going to prune you too why so you'll be more fruitful Hallelujah so you can see more testimonies in your life you can see the grace of God working in your life and others can see it because it's a fruit that everybody can see you're God's Building we preach that a few weeks ago about the four corners of the building God's Building a building you're you're part of a you're part of Ephesus right you're you're part of a structure Hallelujah you're not alone in this you're a part of the building we're all part of this together hallelujah hallelujah and we are all a dwelling place we are all a habitation for God's spirit that's right but he says we work together with God remember they were they were magnifying the preacher so basically the only the preachers are working for God no everybody's working for God that's right now for preachers it's easiest to see it sometimes because uh here right after the resurrection after that the Lord spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and they preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen so we see both spots God works with the individual if we'll do what God Said God will work through us and this works not just for preachers this works for everybody Hallelujah yes if you do what God says if you seek him first he said I'll give you everything you need Glory so see this is one of the uh greatest privileges that we can have as preachers or Christians if we do what God says God comes right back and vindicates and confirms what we've done that it was not a work of ourselves but it was the work of the plan of God the mind of God hallelujah remember Paul and Paulo said we're waterers we're Planters God has to give the increase Hallelujah so we got do our part Church whether it's our part to to water our our our part to plant we must all do our part God's working in every one of our lives and if you want to see more of it just keep investing in it Hallelujah just stay faithful just keep working in the vineyard Hallelujah just keep doing your part just stay in your part of the building of God hallelujah verse 10 according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I've laid the foundation and another man buth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon now this scripture reminded me of 1 Corinthians 15:10 by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace was which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me Hallelujah so Paul knew all his labors were Possible only through Grace which is God's Good Will God's loving kindness God's favor Hallelujah see so Paul knew anything in my life it's God's favor on my life first of all because God predestinated me God called me right and then after that then I yield myself to God I learn how to dedicate myself unto God and then God uses my humble efforts and God blesses it because he has good will I have his favor in my life Hallelujah so that's what I want you to see today church God has given you his Good Will God's for you for good God wants to do good things in your life but we must be faithful to God hallelujah like like like he says here we must not have division envying Strife uh suing you know we might can't have all these things debates and dissensions sexual IM morality drunkenness at the Lord's table you know basically cheating on the Lord and secret sins and all kinds of things like like that that has to be out of our lives and then God's grace is effective in our life all right so see that now I just thought it'd be interesting here you know you look at this and then he says no for other Foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ so think about that every preacher builds upon Paul's Foundation whether good or bad and there's only one Foundation think about that today I'm building on the foundation Paul laid every preacher out there is preaching uh they're they're building something like brother man calls in a pyramid right and he kind of gives the the last Church ages kind of like where the the The Headstone will come down and and it's got to fit perfectly in other words the church age Ministry must be just like Christ's Ministry and we're building up to that church do you see your life becoming more like Christ that's the that's the question we should be asking ourselves today is my life becoming more like Christ Hallelujah every preacher is building on Paul's Foundation Hallelujah now I thought it'd be good to go back over this it's been a couple years since I preached this but remember uh Solomon foreshadowed Paul's Ministry in the Old Testament Church ages because now we have three types of the church ages in the Old Testament we have Moses's golden candlesticks right that type the church ages we see that in Revelation chapter 1 and 2 and three we have Joshua's seven chapter book in Joshua 18- 19 that type the church ages because it's a book about seven tribes Hallelujah right before Joshua goes off the scene right before brother Ram died it's a very beautiful type there and now we have the Kings of Israel that's the new one the Kings of Israel were a foreshadow of the church ages Hallelujah so what does it remind us we must be Kings and Priests unto God you're ruling over your life how many you understand that amen I'm not ruling over your life nobody can make your life good or bad you're ruling over it it's your house Jesus said in Matthew 12 it's you you're the one who opens the doors to good or opens the doors to bad don't open your doors to bad Shut the devil out of your life Hallelujah you're ruling you've got the final say in your life Hallelujah right as far as what God or what you allow God to do or what you allow the enemy to do it's a beautiful type of the church ages hallelujah amen and I love that uh the candlesticks were the light right they were the light in the Holy place and Jesus said the church is the light of the world oh Hallelujah Church your lives are the light of the world the world isn't going to see light except through you so let your light so shine that the men will see your good works and glorify Our God which is in heaven Hallelujah I'm not going to going to go through all this but remember you can here's where I saw in Kevin Uh Kevin Connor's book I saw that cam gave me that book it was such a Beau he and I were talking about that on the phone no we were talking about that when he was here what a blessing that book was but the Old Testament Church ages is a thousand years the New Testament Church AG is about 2,000 years so you can see that and then the last one of course the the last age is the shortest right so the last Church age of the Old Testament Was Elijah John the Baptist the shortest right the last church now the last Church age isn't the shortest according to those dates right now because this is now we're at 118 years in leoda Ephesus Church age was 117 but the point is it's supposed to be a short Church age Hallelujah that's the point we're trying to make there now I saw a a a true parallel between four out of these seven Kings and how they relate to the the uh the seven Church age Messengers there's a clear correlation between at least four of them and so remember Paul was the New Testament Church age messenger he wrote two-thirds of the New Testament and his message is Jesus sees our labor and patience and he's warning we must return to the first love right so Paul wrote part of the Bible didn't Solomon write the Bible he wrote Proverbs Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon and um uh Solomon's message is if you walk before God he'll establish David's Throne if you turn away he'll pluck you out of the land Hallelujah so very similar messages in other words Jesus said if you don't get back to your first love then I'll pluck you out right same thing with Solomon stay with your first love or I'll pluck you out of the land I'll take away my anointing from you Hallelujah and then their messages are exactly the same I'm not going to take all the time through this but it's just amazing the message to the Ephesian Church age Paul preached so much of this in Titus in Romans in Thessalonians Galatians uh Titus Romans 2 Corinthians Galatians and Ephesians jesus' message to the Ephesian Church age was preached by Paul hallelujah it's a beautiful type there how Paul was the first church age messenger you find it in second Corinthians uh lot lots and that's where we're heading to by God's grace after 1 Corinthians we'll go to Second Corinthians Lord willing so it's amazing to see how there's such a parallel between Paul's preaching and the message Jesus gave to the Ephesian Church age it's a total parallel Hallelujah and then I I Love Song of Solomon uh s Song of Solomon said my Dove my undefiled is but one she's the only one of her mother she's the choice of one of her that bear her the daughter saw her and blessed her yay the queens and the concubines they praised her for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart from other gods and his heart was not at was not perfect with the Lord is God as was the heart of David his father so Solomon went from from one wife to a thousand see he started out on fire with just his first love and and he had the god-given wisdom of God but he fell away he left his first love and so his heart was turned away how many want to keep their first love we just heard it preached from the Pennsylvania Brothers right you better keep your first love if not your heart's going to be turned away you're going to feel so far from God you're not going to feel in love with God you're not going to want you're not going to see God's face when you read the Bible Hallelujah you know what and since we're there go to Ezekiel I think I'm going to pull this out here this is going to help our I think it'll help our both our brothers and sisters go to Ezekiel I think it's 22 I'm giving an extra extra blessing here yeah Exodus I'm sorry it's Ezekiel 24:16 this is for all the married people here now so I'm giving an extra marriage counseling here by God's grace this is a bonus all right I'm not preaching on marriage today but since I had read this this week and had the Song of Solomon uh Ezekiel I don't have it up there um but we got to read it here Ezekiel 24:16 I read this this week and I thought oh that's that's right this this now I understand it now th uh Ezekiel was used to do many signs before Israel the Israel that was out of the land in captivity right in Babylon so one of those signs was God was going to take ezekiel's wife with a stroke and then Ezekiel wasn't going to mourn over her and that was a sign to Israel when God uh judged Israel God wasn't going to mourn because they wouldn't repent of their Abominations okay so with that said I know that's an interesting context verse 15 also the word Lord came unto me saying son of man behold I take away from Thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke that's his wife yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down okay now go down Verse 18 so I so I spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and I did the morning as I was commanded Ed now this is a strange thing a strange sign but the point I want to bring out is not dealing with his wife dying the point I want to bring out is in verse 16 I will take away from Thee the desire of Thine Eyes now that made me think of the lust of the eyes and then I thought what is lust lust is a forbidden craving forbidden Hallelujah but God calls ezekiel's wife the desire of his eyes eyes so what I want to bring out for the marriage is that if you're married your husband or your wife that person is the desire the craving you should have so Brothers it's okay to look at your wife only your wife and she's she's a she's the woman you crave hello testing one two testing sisters it's okay to look at your husband and he's the design for your eyes that's the one man you can look at brothers that wife that's the one woman you should crave see that so it's not a sin for a man to Crave his wife it's not a sin for a woman to Crave her husband Glory some people think it's wrong it's not it's only a sin to crave something that's forbidden but if it's allowed if it's blessed by God then God gave you that to satisfy those cravings and the church said there's your free marriage counseling for today Hallelujah in other words brothers you don't got to feel bad if you're constantly thinking about your wife because that's your wife the Bible in another place calls her your well see because you get thirsty you need some water let's read that Proverbs 5 that's what that's why you were given a husband or wife remember and we were preaching on the message of Grace brother Ram said when David had those feelings looking at basba brother Ram said he had those passions he should have took those passions with one of his wives now for us only one wife but see he went and he called for her so see brother saying there's nothing wrong with having those passions that's what the Bible said God called ezekiel's wife the desire of his eyes a man's supposed to have a beautiful wife to look at a wife supposed to have a handsome husband to look at yall know what I'm talking about when you get married HJ if you're married hopefully you said amen sometime in there you don't have to say it all the time but that's why you want to take care of yourself make your make yourself uh as handsome or as beautiful as you can because you are the desire for your spouse that's right now I know we all feel insufficient sometimes we all but you just got to do the best you can Hallelujah do the best you can because ezekiel's wife was the desire of his eyes that's what God call God calls her that she's the desire she's the craving of your eyes remember job said I make a covenant I won't look on any other ma that means I'm just looking at the desire of my eyes my wife Hallelujah get some good marriage scriptures today by God's gra Proverbs Chapter 5 uh now go to verse eight remove thy way far from her speaking of the strange woman in verse three and come not nigh into the door of her house now Simon preaches as the Catholic church that was a good type that's right I forgot about that now go down to verse 15 drink Waters out of thy own sistern and running Waters out of thine own well let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and the rivers of water in the streets let them be thine only and not strangers with thee so he's he's telling Solon is telling his son uh let your wife's love just fill your life right let it run all over your life in the streets everything that that's that's your desire that that's your well that that that's where you get water from that's where you get satisfaction from Hallelujah Verse 18 let thy Fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth see let her be as the loving Hind and pleasant row let her breast satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love Hallelujah so we see it pling the Bible here she your wife is to be desire Brothers of your eyes that's the only one and BR and sisters the husband the desire of your eyes that's why God gave him to you Hallelujah that's right verse 20 why wil thou my son be ravished with a strain woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger right see because your your wife is like your sister your spouse uh she's uh she's your soulmate that's right for the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord and He pth all of his Goings his own iniquity shall take the wicked himself and he shall be Holden with the cords of his sins he shall die without instruction in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray so adulterers they have great Folly because they're going after forbidden Cravings but God gave you a craving God gave you a well drink from your own well Hallelujah Hallelujah right I don't go over to my neighbor's house I don't go to uh either I'm not going to say their names on live stream but I don't go over there asking for water right I don't go over there getting in their fridge I don't I don't go over there can I borrow your car or truck no I don't even borrow their lawnmower if mine breaks down I don't want it I'm just gonna do mine I'm just gonna be happy with mine I'll I'll deal with it because I don't want to be a burden on anybody but the thought right here is stay with your husband or spouse they're the desire of your eyes all right there you go for some good marriage uh counseling there that struck me because I I don't know if I'd preach ever before that that scripture of course gives husbands the right to think about their wives in the right way now as long as it's all all allowed and not forbidden think I think you married ones know what I'm talking about same for the wives as long as you're thinking on those things and you have those thinking about those things and you have the right desires then God will bless that Hallelujah all right now so now I'm going back to this verse Paul was a wise master builder in spiritual things Solomon was a wise master builder in the Natural Things things right he built a natural house glory and Paul said you are God's house Hallelujah all right now I'm not going to go through that again so we see the similarities between Paul and and Solomon both men were Master Builders one natural one spiritual both men wrote the inspired word of God both Ages were warned to return to their first love and both ages had the Candlestick removed from them Ephesus and from uh Israel so I believe the first church age messenger is a perfect type Paul's a wise master builder and then Salon was a wise master builder as well okay back to chapter 13 I'm sorry chapter 3 1 Corinthians 311 for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ now my wife and I were talking about this one time so I think this thought actually came from my wife this reminds us of Matthew 7 and Jesus's teaching on our foundation being obedience Hallelujah so how many know Jesus is the foundation he's the foundation of your life if you feel unstable you got to look down at your foundation Hallelujah God said he's going to shake everything but if you got the right foundation you know you're not going to fall oop sorry so now let's look at the Rock Foundation Paul says Jesus Christ is our foundation and then in jesus' Parable he said he's talking about the uh the anointed ones of the end time the the false prophets therefore whosoever Hearth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will like in him unto a wise man which builth his house upon a rock what's his foundation The Rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock you ought to be encouraged if you've come through the storms of 2024 and you're still standing that proves your foundation was a rock hallelujah amen all the storms of this year all the trials of this year uh all the Rains of this year all the frustrations of this year if you're still standing in the truth of God it proves Christ is your foundation I'm not founded on the society I'm not founded on human government I'm not founded on Theology of man I'm not found I'm not founded certainly not on feelings or finances I'm founded on Jesus Christ Hallelujah and that Rock Paul says was Christ and then the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew upon that house and it fell not is founded upon a rock so Jesus is the foundation of the New Testament teaching Paul says and then Jesus says true teaching is also the foundation of Our Lives Hallelujah brother Brandon taught that Peter's Revelation was the rock that Jesus builds his church upon flesh and blood is not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church again the house illustration are God's house Hallelujah Church aren't you glad that you know you've come through you you're serving God you've served God this long if you are and you're a part of God's church then it proves the father gave you the Revelation a preacher didn't give it to you you don't have a second-handed robe brother Ram says hallelujah right like Elisha he didn't have a second-handed robe that was Elijah's robe glory and if you're serving God today and you're living under the of God today then you don't have a second-handed robe you got the same power that was in Christ the same power that was in St Paul the same power in brother Rand you've got a first-hand robe Hallelujah same Foundation same Revelation The Father revealed it to me in other words brother Simon didn't talk me into this brother Simon pointed me to this but it was the father that revealed this to me because I had a lot of friends try to talk me out of it after that Hallelujah I had people praying that I'd come out of this but somebody else was praying for me Hallelujah Simon Craig brother Brooks brother all all the brothers were praying for me too hallelujah it's a it's a it's a blessing to know that the father himself Your Father revealed this to you not another person see somebody planted somebody watered but God gave you the revelation of it God gave you the increase Hallelujah so notice a real Revelation or Revelation means unveiling of the word is when the believer obeys the commands of the word right because Jesus said let me show you somebody he that does my Commandments let me show you what he's like he's a house that can't be knocked down oh glory amen so see that's what a real Revelation is God show me his word and I obey Because I obey my father I love my father because my father loves me so Peter's personal revelation was his and the church's Rock so you have a rock hallelujah Paul's teaching was the rock the obedient life is founded on the Rock and the over Overcomer never fails or Falls away because they're standing on the Rock Church I'm trying to encourage you look down at your feet today spiritually you're standing on a rock hallelujah you're not standing on Sand your foundation is not going to fall out from you you're not going to be pushed or knocked over by the devil or or or or taking out the message or taking out of the truth it's impossible because your foundation is not sand your foundation is truth hallelujah amen look at your foundation this morning Hallelujah that's what I know I got how many emails how many I mean thousands of comments all these comments uh trying to uh deceive me or something like that how do I stand how do I stand all these years as a pastor I'm founded on a rock I see what Jesus says brother mercy and I do it amen it's that simple Hallelujah these other people are not doing what Jesus said but we're doing what our Lord tells us to do Hallelujah he's Whispering love secrets in our ears as the wedding approaches Hallelujah that's right so thank you hun that was a great thought I really enjoyed that I probably didn't say it the right way you remember when you told me that you remember that yeah you tell me you because you you you read Matthew 7 in your Bible that morning I remember you had it on your phone you're like he was like hey no call I don't know if you call me Jess or brother J probably not brother Jess call me Jess look this proves Revelation right if someone has a revelation they're going to do the will of God because it's the Rock and the rock is a revelation Hallelujah but you have to do the word of God if you do the word of God then you're standing on a rock ah so I hope I didn't I probably just cut it up a little bit but forgive me it was beautiful the way my wife said it Hallelujah when she shared that Revelation with me now everyone that hear these things of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man see that's a foolish person they hear the word of God and they don't do it and he builds his house upon the sand and the rains descend the floods came the winds blew it beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it so see church we don't want our lives to fall into sin we don't want to fall in disgrace amen CU listen Church you're going to get your house is going to get beat on you got to go through every house has to go through storms amen just watch it's it's coming up here pretty soon we're going to get some winter storms and some polar freezes coming up here pretty soon you're going to get some you're gonna get some sleep you're going to hear the you're going to hear the SLE all over your roof and maybe some big chunks your house is going to get beat on but it's going to stand most likely right but spiritually our house should always stand Hallelujah because we know if God's letting this pound on our house we know God allowed it and if God allowed it God won't let me be defeated God won't let me fall God's going to make me stand Hallelujah because God is my Foundation God's the one that even allowed me to be on this rock God's the one that gave me this house amen so God surely won't let me fall Hallelujah what's Paul telling these people if you keep trusting in your favorite preacher you're going to fall you got to trust in Jesus Christ Alone Hallelujah the reality is you just see God through every preacher I say this the reality is you see God and every believer here like we just recorded Len's testimony and uh we can hear those testimonies that's God working in our sister that's why I like doing those testimonies you can see God God is behind that individual God's working with them in God's Own Way ain't always going to be the same as you and I but we appreciate we respect we honor what God's doing in every life Hallelujah we got to be yielded to the Holy Spirit not building not trusting in the the things of the world building our lives on Sand we got to build our life upon the rock so the disobedient those disobeying the truth is per proof the person never had a revelation right all these people that leave the the message and say well you know like the one guy told me well I don't know if father son Holy Ghost is right or Lord Jesus Christ that proves you never had a revelation you never knew Jesus you never knew God you don't even know God you you serve God for 40 years and don't even know his name right come on I'm 44 right my wife's 41 uh I know her name praise God we've been married 21 years I know that's what that's the type when you know someone in a marriage you know them intimately I know her name and you people say I know Jesus for 40 years in the message and then I don't know his name anymore something's wrong they built their house on Sand we got to build it on the rock hallelujah how can you not know the name of your spouse flirting too much that's why right flirting with the things of the world too much flirt with Delilah Hallelujah Shame Shame on these people well I don't know the truth I don't know what's right you got God's face right here this is the face of God God's face won't won't contradict itself it won't change right it it cannot change it will always be the same it always be yay and amen hallelujah to every word in there now back to chapter 3 again now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hair or stubble there's six in there six the number of man every man's work should be made manifest think about that every pre now he talking about preachers every preacher's real intent behind their preaching is going to be known their real motivation behind it is going to be known now that makes me fearful but also makes me confident Hallelujah because what's what's going to happen the day there's coming a day when God will declare Every Man's work and I'm not just talking about preachers now I'm talking about all of us too all the saints there's coming a day and it's going to prove what type what was your motivation behind your life no matter what it looked at on the outside what was it on the inside of your soul we better get the new heart we better get a new spirit we better get God God's spirit Glory we better be justified the church said we better be Sanctified the church said and we better get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the church shouted I like that shout thank you for thank you for responding to that I appreciate that Hallelujah you didn't have to shout but I appreciate that see the day is going to declare what you have what did you build your life on worldly wisdom or God's wisdom there's going there's coming a day it will will declare what your life has built on so that's why Church you ought to appreciate when you make a mistake you ought to appreciate when God rebukes you or God corrects you because God is not going to let you be built on Sand he's he's helping you make sure your foundation is a rock hallelujah that's the love of God that he'd correct us amen see every man's work is going to be appear appearing it's all going to appear before us for the day shall declare because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is so what did the man build it they build it with gold the fire is going to show do you build with silver precious stones wood hay or Stu imagine building a house out of hay we all know the story of The Three Little Pigs right the devil just comes by blows down that house of Hay House is straw see let's build our house with gold silver now I don't sure how to take this type but in other words don't build it out of temporary things build it out of things that have permanence they they they're long lasting they're valuable amen amen build your house out of something valuable Hallelujah the word of God so see every preacher's work in their study and sermon preparation is going to be revealed every single one of them that makes again that makes me sober but also makes me joyful because I've just tried to point the people to Christ never tried to point them to me I tried to point them to Christ by the grace of God now look at brother R says brother R now in this sermon let's see do I have another one from this I can't remember yes so let's read this one first brother raham brings an indictment that means he's proving these preachers are guilty that's what indictment is proof of guilt brother raham says today I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creeds and denominations they're crucifying to the people the very God that they claim that they love and serve I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ upon their what their Doctrine brother Abraham's inditing them on their doctrine that claim that the days of Miracles is passed and the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted Creeds for I indict them as guilty and the blood of Jesus Christ is upon their hands for crucifying aresh the Lord Jesus the second time they're crucifying Christ to the public taking from them the thing that they're supposed to be given them and they substitute something else in his place a church Creed for popularity now these preachers are indicted because they took the word away but what are we trying to do we're trying to give you the word be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's the name of your husband amen trust in God God's A Healer God can give you Divine Healing God can give you a miracle today Hallelujah trust in God hallelujah all these promises we're trying to give you the true teaching the true Doctrine hallelujah we're not trying to take it away from you believe in God with all your heart believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt Prosper hallelujah amen but the guilty preachers are taking these scriptures these promises away brother raham indites them but he also prays and says oh Lord God I'm going to skip down Minister will hear this in their study I pray for them Lord let these words fall deep into the heart cut deep cut all cut away all the world that's what we want today Hallelujah we want the Holy Ghost to come in doesn't the Bible say the word's a sword we want this sword to come in and go deep into our soul and cut out anything that craves the world anything that craves anything forbidden Lord cut it out and do a surgery on my heart or maybe you if mine works better for you do that right just cut it out Lord go deep let the word of God go deep into our hearts and cut away all the desires of the world and then he gives a testimony this little Methodist Minister down in Kentucky he's got two or three children he said I was hearing those seven Church ages I heard it cry out get away from them walls of Babylon so the walls of denomination are like the walls of Babylon right they're keeping you chained into their Creeds like the walls of Babylon kept you in the world right kept you in sin I give it up and left I don't know which way to go or what to do but I left blessed be the courage of that young man and a wife and two or three children brother said bless that man he sees the evils of Creeds he comes out of there he doesn't know where he's going he's trusting God to bless him as he takes a stand on the word of God because every one of his works is going to be judged by the word of God and we know all of our Lives will be judged by the word of God okay so every man's work will be made manifest and the day shall declare and the fire will declare now there's two kinds of fires that will declare these preachers works right there's the fire of the fiery Trials of life and then there's the fires of standing before Jesus when he has fire in his eyes so I caught this from Wednesday there's two fires because the Bible says we all go through how many know these scriptures right when you go through a when you go through a Temptation the trial your faith be more precious than gold that perish though it be tried with fire so when you go through test it's like a fire right life seems hard life seems hot life seems uncomfortable but it's it's it's testing your faith it's making you more pure hallelujah it's getting out as brother Aaron preached to us right it's getting there's seven steps to get the draw out it's God getting all the sin and cravings and the evil desires he's getting it out of your life we ought to be thankful he's making us more pure so the fire will declare what our lives were spent for Hallelujah the trials of life will prove do we really love people in the church do we really love one another do I really love my husband do I really love my wife do I really love my children do I really love this message amen hallelujah the trials of life will prove what you really love Hallelujah it'll take all the selfishness out all the divisions all and for the Corinthian Church it would do that too because Paul writes a second letter and they obeyed him in the things that he wrote see that's what the fire of God will do it will take out your dross and didn't Jesus say I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire during the church age right during your lifetime you can buy gold today and I looked up gold it's like2 2,000 some dollars an ounce now that's not that's not the gold Jesus selling you some of you might want to go invest in some gold you might want to it keeps going up but Jesus said his gold is free Hallelujah he said buy money without price hallelujah amen he said buy the truth and sell it not Hallelujah so see Jesus is trying to give you Christlike character it's the time tested Faith gold right the the gold is the Christlike character as you go through the fires of life you go through the fiery trials your your life becomes more like Christ you become more like a Christian like brother said you live that day you you can smile when people speak evil of you when things don't go your way at the church you can still smile and take up your cross and follow Jesus because you know it's all working together for your good Hallelujah that's right so that's the first type of fire here's the second type of fire each preacher and every one of us will stand before Christ and what's he going to look like his head and hairs were white like wool his eyes were as a flame of fire so G so Paul says that day will declare by fire and brother in the church age book says see the fire the fiery Eyes Of God will see through there no excuse uses right there's not there's you can't lie and you can't you can't whitewash your mistakes something like that the fire will burn right through that and see what's really down to the depths of our hearts that's why we need to confess all our sins now Hallelujah so that on that day the Bible said we'll have boldness on the day of judgment so I want to bring that out for an assurance for you I don't want I don't want the the guilt of your past to hang over you because if you confess your sins and you're striving to obey God then you can have boldness in other words happiness and confidence on the day of judgment because you know God's helped you overcome your sins Hallelujah that's right let me look that up now because I I don't have it on my slides there I just thought about it right now boldness in the day of judgment it's 1 John 4:17 if you got your Bible heing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world and the church said boldness means frankness so honesty spokenness bluntness Assurance oh I like that Assurance we have Assurance on the day of judgment I know he paid for my sins right I know I've confessed them I'm striving to put every demon under my foot I'm not walking according to the course of this world the prince of power of the air I'm walking according to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah all right and unto the angel of the church and th write these things sayith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass all right now here's what I want to show you I've been talking about this over the years 2024 has been an awful year for false preachers one of these guys is named Bickle uh he started a 24hour think about this he started a 24-hour prayer chapel and they it's still going on today they started in the '90s and for 24 hours a day they sing and praise and worship but it's a Prosperity Gospel it's a Prosperity Gospel and this year he was caught uh he's already married but he was telling a woman uh he see they they have all these false prophecies they try to impersonate a prophet and this man told a woman uh so he could have adultery he said the Lord show me my wife's going to die uh by Vision so you're going to be my wife after she passes away that's that dude and these guys have millions and millions of dollars in their Ministries now Bentley I don't remember him but I know he left his first wife for his secretary I don't he's he's had a lot of problems Lawson he's the most recent one he was a 70 year old man he he and with his church money the church donations he would fly a 20-year-old he's 70 he'd fly a 20-y old up to see him so many times this guy was Pastor in New York City and he had adulteries as many women for Hill song he was a hill song pastor and he one they he remember he went on The View and they asked him uh they said is it okay to have an abortion in your church and it wasn't but he made it like it was and then he had to apologize afterwards look at that being under the light of the world can't even stand up for Christ see all the works Church all the works are going to be made manifest by the fire amen hallelujah Every Man's work every woman's testimony all of our lives are going to be judged and and and the fire is going to expose what was behind that God help us to have Purity in our lives amen hallelujah they're going to be exposed now think about that 20 20 30 40 this guy was a preacher for 50 some years but eventually it's going to be exposed if it's not if the sin is not dealt with if they're building their life on Sand though winds are going to the storms are going to blow them down and Ministries loss and disgrace people look up to these people now this man uh Morris he had the he has the largest he had he's he's resigned now he had the largest church in all of America in Texas but it come to find out when he was 20 years old he was freshly married he was living with his inlaws and then he was molesting uh another person in the house and it just came out and these are all Prosperity preachers well I'm sorry not him all the other ones are Prosperity they got all these false gifts and they all try to impersonate brother brandom not him though U and the last one I didn't put his name up there but that's the message preacher that fell this year and I was going through my notes and uh this message preacher back in 2012 asked to be a part of a ministers meeting that we were having and I just found my email yet last night I thought well there it is U and I said brother I can't have you come for two reasons first you've caused a vision in my brother's church and you haven't repented of that and second of all you weren't ordained the way the Bible says to be ordained the Bible said you got to be ordained by another preacher by the laying on of hands this man when he was ordained he called in a guest preacher and then had his mom and dad and a guest preacher ordained him I'm sorry that's not the way it works another Holy Ghost filed man has to see a gift in another Holy Ghost fil man and that Holy Ghost filed man has to ordain that man so I said you got two things against you and so he emailed back and said well I just hope God will bless it someday now look what God did just in May uh in May it was all over the news in Toledo this man uh is in his 30s and he's writing letters to a a teenager trying to have sexual relations with him and now was resigned and lost in the message but look I warned him 12 years ago I warned him right if you don't start the right way it's going to end the it's going to end bad if you don't make your if you don't make your foundation The Rock The Winds of the storms of life are going to blow you over thank God we're still standing today thank God there's a rock that the heavenly father reveals to us and we can build our lives upon the truth of the gopel hallelujah amen oh makes me Rejoice to know that we're standing on the truth the day the fire will expose what every man's work was Hallelujah if any man's work abide which he's built upon he shall receive a reward there's a reward for faithful preachers also especially moms there's a reward for anyone who gives a child a glass of water in the name of a disciple and I don't know how that works you know normally I could give I give you this water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right I bless that you know but Jesus said you can even do it in the name of a disciple and you you won't lose your reward so see just ministering to the needs of the family right Anna being good to your your siblings right God's G to give you a reward for that think Casa how much W reward you got for cooking supper for us as long as you did it in the name of the Lord God's got a reward for you so it's not just preaching it's every believer when you serve others when you show the love of Jesus Christ to others God keeps track right the angels are writing them down Hallelujah God's going to reward you for that and the fires of life will expose what was your real motivation what was your real purpose for this let the motivation be to love Jesus Christ and to make him known that we can spend eternity with Jesus Hallelujah that should be the motivation I'm trying to finish here if any man's work shall be burned now those prach I showed you their Ministries are all burnt down now I hope they can get saved but it doesn't look like some of them because they haven't really repented they just go off and Mar oh I forgot one up there the Tony Evans guy yeah he was all over the no he was a very respected man he was all over the radio internet and again it was oh yeah what was the common denominator for all those preachers sexual sin lust of the eyes now a lot of it too is money right because once they got the money once they got then they can fly the girls in and bunch of bunch of lust of the eyes of what it is men filled with demon powers right but it's just like bam right sometimes they're anointed on the spirit of God sometimes they're Anointed with lust demons right just leaving instead of that everyday Christian Life that solid wheat seed Christian Life and the church said that mature wheat seed that's hardened that lays in the presence of son the sun Hallelujah rejoice in the word of God gives God praise loves the worship God hallelujah that's a mat true I'm sorry that's a true mature wheat seed of God that's ready for the Harvest Hallelujah forgot to put gel on my hair this morning so sorry just flopping all over the place here today now this church can only but he himself shall be saved now this is only referring to the foolish virgins because bam won't be saved Cain won't be saved the Bible already told us those there's a whole list of those preachers Kora Dayan they won't be saved so Paul's referring to the Jewish virgin preachers in Corinth they'll be saved if they repent think about that you lost all the benefits now just picture you know picture your garden or my wife's Garden or something like that think of all the fruits over all the years we've had that Garden we've had it 14 years think about all the pounds of potatoes we were digging up a few weeks ago kids really like that was that's fun it's fun to find all those potatoes and those were just volunteers right you know Glory but think about all the I remember when we when you guys were little I carried in those big wheel barrel full of of lots of pounds of potatoes think about all that fruit I'm think in God's mind he's keeping track of all that Harvest and to think that if that if that preacher if that that planter doesn't have the right heart all the fruits of all those years can be burnt and there's no record of it in heaven that's quite a thought but if that farmer had a pure heart then there is a record there's a reward for all that Harvest that you brought forth for Christ Hallelujah isn't that wonderful the Bible says that you can be saved and have no reward I hope these preachers get saved but we've just seen in 2024 I mean there's been Lots through the years but this year has been especially uh revealing something about 2024 where where their whole Ministries are burn over and there's nothing people now people stop selling their books and of course of course because they've they've brought a reproach they've defamed they've defiled the name of Jesus Amen and the fires of the day this day 2024 the fires of the day reveal what was in their heart Christians should be the hardest workers Christians should be the most pure people amen the most transparent people the most honest people the most trustworthy people amen but you give you give some of these guys's enough money they can't trust him remember this guy specifically oh yeah and he was part of a church and he had this guy specifically they found out later he had no Pastor he had no home Church they were just paying him to come preach there very often but it it come out that after every time he preached he just left he had no contact with the people he didn't really care about the people he was only there for a paycheck no contact now how many pastors uh do we know around the the world right we talk about this but you know a pastor shouldn't be just high and above somebody brother said the shepherd should be right there with the Sheep so you know what kind of character he is he's your example how can he be your example if you don't even know him and never seen him struggle never seen him that's why I love brother brand he's so honest he is so humble so honest to us when was the last time you told somebody yeah I pouted I was pouting to God I was being like a baby towards God when was the last time you told somebody about your last lie brother lied to the IRS think about how humble this man is see he didn't care because he knew God he knew in honesty God would bless that honesty and then that would help us as we listen and and that even helps us understand more how could Abraham lie twice how could David do such a thing David how could you do it we just saw that on W on Thursday how could you do such thing like that but yet there's Grace when we make mistakes are we going to pay for it absolutely we'll pay for every sin we've done brother said you'll get spanked for every evil thing you do but God's Gra will bring you to a pure heart I'm trying to close did I say that yet I'm trying to close I'm at my regular time anyway by God's grace so see preachers or even moms or dads anybody think about think about that anyone who who has this awful fall the all their all their work will be burnt but at least if they repent they can be saved that's the grace of God you waste your whole life for a moment of pleasure whatever it is few moments of pleasure you waste your whole life for that but yet God will still forgive you if you you truly repent that's the grace of God what do you say by by fire right you're saved by Christ Christ sees okay you did repent like the thief on the cross you did repent I see you remember very very few false preachers will be saved right because Jesus said very few find the narrow road so again I hope those Brothers can repent if they are brothers indeed now remember we're still in the context of divisions in the church know you not that you're the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you and yet you're arguing and envying jealousy debates If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy we see this later in chapter 11 people don't discern the body of Christ so many are weak and sickly among you and many have passed away in this big church so this was a big issue there was lots of little uh Clicks in the church and these people against that people and yet Supernatural everywhere it's it's astounding what kind of atmosphere this church was in If any man destroy the temple of God him shall God destroy now that can be in the current day right because the Bible said some men sins go go before them some go behind them some of them we won't find out till the day of judgment right so this this could mean God will destroy uh their souls in hell right he'll destroy them they're made to be taken and destroyed or it could mean they suffer that punishment right here on the earth for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are so even divisions and of course getting drunk and suing people and sexual immorality all these things should not be done because we're supposed to be holy we're supposed to be set apart we're supposed to be set apart so God can use us whenever he wants to praise God so what is it that defiles in this context the pride of life makes people divided envying uh what's the other one the dissension it's the pride of life that does that and it defiles what's supposed to be a holy life our lives must remain holy for the grace of God let's get the leav out if we have any Le in our lives let's get the leaven out praise God he's going to get to that in two chapters in chapter five I'm almost let no man deceive himself if any man among you seem to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise okay so man or woman that thinks they know all about it they got life figured out they're successful in every single thing they do Paul says let that person become a fool to the gospel right let them become simple let them understand the ways of God don't deceive yourself just because people have uh blessings in the natural that doesn't mean they're right with God that's no sign that they're anywhere right with God just like I showed you all those million dollar preachers none of them are right with God the whole time so Paul says don't be deceived received riches riches and popularity that doesn't mean you're right with God for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God for it's written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness I love thinking about this God said we must be simple humble or fools for Christ and didn't God take hmon Hon's like oh I'm gonna build I'm gonna build a galley and God says no you're not well you can but it's not going to be for Mori or that's going to be for you I'm smarter than you are right and Jonah Jonah's like I'm GNA run away from God God's I'm going to sail away God's not going to get me oh yeah God will get you that's right he's going to get you with the fish a great whale he's going to get you see people think they can outsmart God it's impossible don't run from God run to God Amen we shouldn't be men men and women running from the presence of the Lord we should be men and women drawing in running into God's presence Nebuchadnezzar oh I got this all I I I've built all this look how great I am the hanging baskets and God said you're not so smart I'm going to give you a beast mind right he takes the wise their own craftiness you're without me you're nothing but a plain old Beast right that's all you are without me if my if my hand of protection isn't on you you'd be a little you'd be an animal out there in the field right that's how much we should thank God for giving us a sound mind Hallelujah love joy and a sound mind Hallelujah God has not given us a spirit of fear or a spirit of Pride for that matter and Pharaoh Pharaoh's like I'll chase him down I'll go right through the uh the Red Sea there I'll go right through and God said no you won't I'm going to take you in your own craftiness don't go chasing after my children I set them free and they'll be free indeed Hallelujah I love how God takes them in their own craftiness right what what the what the world meant for evil God is meant for good Hallelujah we could put Joseph on there too right all the all the brothers oh I'll sell him out we'll sell him out uh we'll show him that he's not the favorite and God said I'm going to exalt him to second in the whole world then he's going to save your your entire lives because you despise his his dreams you despise his prophecies you despise his gift you tried to kill him but yet I'm going to use him to save your life the person you Tred to kill I'm going to use to save you now that's humility right there that's the plan of God so Church let's not go after anybody let's not have any Rivals except the devil and yourself brother R said my greatest enemy is William brandham he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that thinks he can do something about it and the church said right let's have those enemies not our brothers and sisters not not even these people on the screen that's not our enemies I'm praying for them I had prayed for them I hope they get saved but the day will manifest all of our works like I just told you before it might take 20 years to manifest what's in someone's heart it might take 40 as we saw they really don't believe the message it might take 50 it might take 60 but the day will declare it Hallelujah Every Man's work shall be declared and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain God help us to get rid of our self-centered plans for our lives the best thing I can advise like I told Malachi and the young people uh the best thing I could advise say Lord you direct my paths you open this door you close this door I want to do what you want me to do no matter how much money or little money I do make now Brothers you want to supply for your children that's the main thing you want to do you want to provide for your wife and children but not in the way you want to do it in the way God is guiding you to it because the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord so don't don't don't try to imagine that's what the that's what the false prophets did the Old Testament they imagine prophecies they imagine visions of their own selves we don't want to do that we don't have to imagine God already has a plan for us God already has a perfect path for us he is the way the truth and the life he is the way we should walk for our lives I'm closing therefore let no man Glory or boast in men for all things are yours see that's what we got to be careful oh this brother preaches message and oh that brother oh that brother that brother that brother make sure you're boasting on Christ see that that that that that's the trouble in the church here oh they're bragging on Peter bragging on Paul bragging on Apollos they should have been bragging on Christ ever see that don't glory in men for all for in other words these gifts were they're for you this is this this was to benefit you but don't give them too much Glory don't give them don't boast on them remember these are God's servants these are God's gifts to the whole body of Christ whether Paul or Apollos or sephus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours think about that this is all given for us for our good that we would love Jesus Christ everything in this world was given right our life even death death was given so we could go we could separate from this world into the Heavenly World Hallelujah all these things are for your good but give the credit to God give the glory to Jesus Christ and you are Christ and I love he ends with a headship and Christ is gods in other words we will see our savior we'll see Jesus but we'll never see the father is it but that what a what an assurance that is we get to see the one who died for us we get to see the one who raised for us amen we get to see the one who interceded for us every time we had an emergency prayer and oh Lord Jesus intercede every time God answered we get to see him and say thank you for hearing my prayer thank you for making intercession to the father Hallelujah and then Christ is God Gods let's stand to our feet the son belongs to the father musicians going to come I'm going back I'm circling back to the quote I used at the beginning church we need to know where we're standing and we need to have an anchor in our life that's what this is all about we're not anchored to preachers and the church said we thank God for them God gives us Shepherds thank God thank God for every preacher looking forward to Simon and Brian I really am I really I'm excited to hear the word of God just like how here it was when brother cam was here but I know where I'm standing whether I feel something or not I know God's with me I know God cares I know I'm a friend of God see we got we we need a deeper hold than that we need to Anchor more than just a feeling more than just a temporary excitement or a a temporary joy we didn't have an anchor it's the love of God I love God In My Soul that's the anchor of my life Hallelujah because the day will declare what was in your soul let's bow our heads here here for a word of prayer thank you church you've been very patient very uh responsive thank you for your patience with me father God in heaven we thank you for today Lord God how we love you Jesus how we thank you Lord God for your grace and mercy Lord today we want to boast in Christ today thank you
