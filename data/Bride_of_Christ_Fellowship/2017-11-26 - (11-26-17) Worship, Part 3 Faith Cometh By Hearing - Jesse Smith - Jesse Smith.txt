is saying today as we look upon your character we look on your web nor traces of as a see your spiritual face today Lord what you would speak to us we know you'd only have a word voice it can only come to the word don't we trust you to speak to us it may help us to get out of the flesh and into the sphere Lord God to hear of the Spirit saying to the churches for your mercy bless every soul that's here every salt feast upon the Living Word of God for that is shifu force today thank you for the season of Thanksgiving nearly intruding over so grateful we're so thankful for all you've done for as we said on Wednesday that all the benefits we have not forgotten all the benefits we thank you for all the thank you that we could be like that we these witnesses to our failings lord I just pray Lord in every soul one that doesn't know you come to them use this as vessels to do that door we pray give all the glory of Jesus Christ Romans chapter 10 I can preach on part three of this worship series like to have a subtopic of faith cometh by here instead 17 how many happy be the house the Lord today so thankful for the house of correction praise God so grateful to come to God's house and hear the word of God that our souls might be corrected with the word of the Lord the Bible says if you rebuke a wise man he'll love you more you correct a wise man he'll love you more praise God so we want the Holy Spirit to correct us today praise the Lord lead us and guide us into all truth amen Romans 10:17 for there say Amen let's just read verse 17 together then we'll have you take your seats verse 17 let's begin on three one two three so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God may God's blessings reading of his word may be seated so I'd like to continue this thought on worship and I want to recall a few quotations remember worship means to kiss like a dog licking his master's hand that's what worship means it means surprise rate oneself in homage to do reverence and to worship amen remember were told us the importance of Revelation by the holy spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized never we could never preach on that too long we could not never overemphasize how important it is for a true believer to a revelation of the Holy Spirit it can never be overemphasized we saw last Sunday with Hannah how could how could we overemphasize the importance of the revelation that God gave to Hannah that she would have Samuel how could we overemphasize that how can we say well you're putting too much emphasis on that No her whole life was centered around thus saith the Lord her whole destiny to bring forth the son hallelujah and then multiple children after that but her whole destiny centered around I've got to bring forth the son I've got to bring forth I have a desire to bring forth children in this earth her whole destiny centered around this desire in her heart and when she got thus saith the Lord it meant everything to her and we saw how she got it she fasted before she came to church she was fasting she was praying she had to go through the beating and the pounding of her adversaries she had to go through the years of trials the years of disappointment of not having children the years of disappointment of being rebuked and teased by her her husband's other wife should go through years and years of trials but one day she when she got real desperate she went to the house of God and Eli said God will give you your requests and God gave it to her so the Bible said her countenance changed if we could only have that today praise God who our faces would be different when we walk out of the service amen her face was different her countenance was changed nine months later Samuel come on the scene Amen so the importance of revelation can never be overemphasized that was so important and for you and I it's so important for us to know that faith comes by hearing the word that we're gonna hear today praise God and not just today but every service every service is important to the true Christian just like every meal is important to the hungry person out there you're probably not you probably to skip breakfast this morning you probably didn't skip supper last night you certainly didn't skip Thanksgiving lunch right because it was so important to have your favorite foods well that's what it's like coming to church today we're gonna have our favorite food it's God's Word amen now that's the true believer remember it can't be over emphasized to the true believer to the make believer doesn't doesn't really matter they they don't really come to church to have a revelation or to get the say at the Lord but the true believer comes to get thus saith the Lord amen how they do you now let's go through the scriptures back in Romans 10 here verse 9 but what say that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach it's so important that we preach faith that we preach Revelation faith means assurance it's so important that I preach to you the assurance of God's Word how many you are assured God will keep his word to you we preach that we preach faith have faith in God have confidence in God believe God we must preach that but it's also got to be in your heart and it's got to be in my heart and it's got to be in all of our mouths we have to make sure we're constantly sharing I can I know God's gonna do this I can't wait till God God already did this you know we can even speak future tense God is gonna do this God has already done this we're so thankful we've got to speak it it's got to be in our heart and then it's got to be in our mouth as well verse 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved how many grateful for that Amen so you've got to confess Jesus publicly you've got to speak that I know he's a son of God I know he's the risen Savior I know he's in my life I know he sanctified in my life I know I'm justified I know I'm filled with the Holy Ghost amen we must have the confession and the possession of the word amen now I says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation that's my brother and said you can cry and scream all night and beg God for salvation but at some point you've got to accept it you at some point you've got to accept the Holy Ghost you've got to accept sanctification you got to say yes that's mine yes the Holy Ghost is mine yes salvation is mine and once you start accepting it it will start working in your life but you gotta accept it first amen you've got to believe it by faith amen verse 11 for the scripture says who said believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him Amen what a beautiful scripture for whosoever shall call upon the name of Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how should they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things amen but they've not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God O God has - yes - for know that somebody wants to be saved and when he knows somebody wants to be saved he's got to send a preacher and that preacher has to preach the Word of God and then that here has to hear the word of God and accept him and then confess in their mouth that they're saved and that they have salvation that they have forgiveness and now they would say how beautiful are the meetings that we have where there's preaching because people's lives are being changed amen people's destinies were from the pits of hell but now they're to that heavenly city the New Jerusalem amen that's all through the preaching of the word of God now as we looked at worship this is what we must be so careful in worship to make sure that we're having faith that comes by hearing the Word of God as I said on Wednesday if we leave the church here and got nothing out of it it wasn't God's fault it was our fault because we must make sure we hear the route went right way and if God will help me by the end of the service I want to get too dull of hearing there's a condition that comes upon people around the message faster than any other church because we're on the message of the hour and it's completely scriptural if you don't hear and get revelation from these services then you're quick to fall away quick to die in things of the Holy Spirit and it's absolutely scriptural so it's so important that you and I give our full attention and say God speak your word to me let me hear it not with my ears let me here in my heart amen let me walk out of here with some more supernatural strength or supernatural power raise my faith I need more faith to meet the challenge of this hour that's why I come to hear the word of God to be strengthened god help us to desire more of his word amen glory now go to Roman's 1 we're in chapter 10 go to Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter 1 verse 11 now Paul desire to go to Roman the church in Rome for one reason now there's of course many reasons but the main reason was verse 11 for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end that ye may be established why did Paul want to visit that church so the gift of the Holy Spirit his life could begin ministering to them and something through the preach now wouldn't be something he could give them it would actually be something he would just say to them it would be God's Word and if they were faithful here's the word would go out of paws lips and the people spiritually would grab ahold of that word and say thank God we've received a gift today the Holy Spirit imparted to me some supernatural gift amen holiday it might be a gift of healing it might be a gift of salvation it might have been the gift of the Holy Ghost but this is what Paul desired I want to see you so the gifts of God can begin working and God's people can receive things from heaven amen this was a desire I hope that's why you came to church today that's why we ought to come to church to receive some spiritual gift today amen exactly right now I want to go to Galatians chapter 3 verse 1 if you have your Bibles Galatians 3 verse 1 this morning and every time I preach I'm trying to minister miracles to you people how many could say amen to that when brother and when brother Samuel came when brother Craig and brother Brooks where they come in knew they're trying to administer some spiritual gift to the people how are they doing that they're trying to get in the channel the Holy Spirit that's holy spirit will give them something to say that they'll preach it to the people and the people will grab ahold of that and say that was just for me that what revelation was for me and now I have some spiritual gift I'm trying to work miracles this morning by the Holy Spirit amen but the people got to be willing I've got to be willing to get in the channel of the Spirit that miracles can take place this morning amen Oh hallelujah I hope you understand let's I think you understand in Galatians 3 verse 1 Oh church is not a boring thing it's not a it's not a hard thing it ought to be the most exciting thing there is on the face of the earth that's coming to church amen but it all depends on our attitudes how we come faith only comes by hearing the preaching of the word amen I've got plenty of quotes for you so I know that you quote lovers I know you'll like those I'm one of those quote lovers Galatians 3 verse 1 o foolish Galatians who has bewitched you see someone put a demon spell on them a false spirit that ye should not obey the truth see when someone stops obeying the true Word of God they're bewitched a spirits gun on them in the church said and anything in any little simple thing when they stop obeying the Word of God they're bewitched they have a spiritual demon anointing them he said before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you so this is what I'm learning he's saying from you did you receive receive you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith did you receive the Holy Spirit by keeping the law of Moses or did you receive the Holy Spirit by hearing the Word of God and by faith you received it look at verse 3 oh are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect in the flesh that would be like us going back to a circumcision well you've got to be circumcised of the flesh to be say that's what Paul is telling these Galatians like them the man tried to convince me all you need to keep the Sabbath day the natural Sabbath day I said sunday is my Sabbath day right sunday is my day of rest is my nature day of rest but like in the Old Testament priests had to work on the Sabbath so my day off I'm actually working on my day off but jesus said that doesn't blasting the Word of God because someone's got to work I'm a minister to the people and they try to bring you under these laws and and things that are not in the Word of God now look at verse five no verse four have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain I look at here's verse 5 this is what I was saying I'm trying to minister miracles to you by trying to get in this spirit to speak God's Word but then you and I all of us are supposed to receive that word I'll give you some examples he therefore that ministers to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith never understand that to see what preachers are coming to preachers are here to perform miracles I'm speak I'm supposed to speak words that will do a miracle in your life but the people have to hear it they have to receive it how many can say amen to that I wrote down a few examples of recent miracles we've had because remember a miracle is just like one of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit right so whether you have a tongue where they have interpretation where they have a prophecy no matter what it is they're all on the same level because they're all gifts of the Holy Spirit a year ago this month was when sister Marie came up and she was at his bleeding condition and I preached on the five identification of the true church and she said as I prayed for her at that altar over there the bleeding stopped and she called me the next day her and brother Kevin said God did a miracle in the service that was one year ago this month see what was I doing I was ministering by the Spirit miracles glory hello but what did it take she had to respond she had to hear yes God's church does work miracles that's one of the identification of a true church these signs shall follow them that believe amen all hallelujah all the time are you with me sister Naomi I'm gonna use her last February spoke in tongues in that service member that tongues is on the same level as America I mean know that all the nine gifts are on the same level and the church said and we prayed for their interpretation and I was wondering if somebody gonna get so anointed they might give the interpretation that's a move of the Holy Spirit and we appreciate our sister being led by the Holy Spirit I really appreciate her example there to be moved by the Holy Spirit who's speaking in tongue because so many people might be afraid and no doubt maybe she was too but she was willing to get in the spirit how many one to get in the spirit I'm when I come here when any preacher comes here we're trying to minister miracles we're trying to impart some gift to you to preach the Word of God but the people got to be able to hear it and they got to be able to receive it are you with me faith comes by hearing the Word of God I hope you understand that by the grace of Lord last May I was in Lima and preached on the Bride of Christ and the day of Pentecost and you probably member the testimony when I come back we I was praying for this young man at the altar he was given his heart back to God he was weeping and snot and crying and sister Karen Sanders had come up for prayer why after I got done praying for him about a half-hour I go over to sister Karen said sister Karen desire prayer she said God already healed me my knee is completely healed in the name of Jesus I thought that's so nice of God while I was busy he went over and healed the person who was waiting to be prayed for that's that's so nice of the Lord Jesus that's how loving God is now who ministered that miracle it was Christ but it was Christ working through a vessel God wants to work through preachers who are filled with the Holy Ghost glory faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God I went back and listened to that sermon I preached in Guyana from 2012 the sermon where a man was healed of arthritis and what were some other ones I forget demons were cast out I went back and listened to it I saved it and I was just so blessed to hear all the testimonies about being demons being cast out and people being healed that was the same trip when a woman come after me crying after service and said I had a kidney stone go after you prayed for me I felt a hot sensation and drove it out of my foot what are we doing here we're here to down the kingdom of darkness the Word of God always takes down the kingdom of darkness hallelujah but we've got to be in the channel to receive the Word of God how many understand that by God's grace you see God wants to do miracles but we've got to be able to hear and receive the miracle I mean understand that now you remember the order we went through it last Sunday the order of getting in the spirit is to come to church first know read your Bible first know the prophet of God said the order to receive a miracle is to pray first pray first he said so many people get baptized but they don't get in the spirit of repentance we see it all the time oh I'm so bad I got in the spirit of repentance a pen when I repented I took down all my evil posters threw away all my rock and roll and rap CDs I started paying back all the money I stole from my mom just like Zacchaeus amen sorry and if anybody really gets saved today they'll make all their wrongs right they'll live a Christian life they'll try to undo all the damage they've done as a sinner if they really repent from their sins amen exactly right and you so you see that's so crucial to get in the spirit first to pray first prophet says pray first he said then get in the spirit now I want to read this quote here well the RAM said I'm going to use the subject of expectation how many ever hear people say oh you have expectation how many ever people ever say that expectation is just expecting God to move like you're anticipating I have anticipation God's gonna move now you came today and you had into anticipation brother Jesse's gonna preach right you had anticipation Malachi is probably gonna play the piano you had anticipation but spiritual anticipation for God is expecting God to speak expecting God to move I expect I anticipated to see Jose I anticipated to see different ones I anticipated that but we need to end seeing the miracle working God that's true worship and it's never gods far as I said it's always our lack of maturity or it's always our laziness or it's it's our unbelief and God help us just to say we're sorry and get right with God it's so simple well Ram says this expectation usually is based upon faith and you have to have faith before you can expect anything to see before you can come to church with expectation you've got to pray first meet got in there God raises your faith in prayer right and then you come to church and you come expecting to hear from God I hope somebody came that way this morning if you did you're gonna leave out here with the new countenance you're gonna leave out here with a fresh revelation if not it's gonna be very hard you can still do it but you got to quickly repent amen right because God will anoint a dirty vessel God won't bless a vessel that's in disobedience to the Word of God so first is pray that creates expectation through faith the next step is hearing second step is hearing and receiving revelation or faith with thus saith the Lord during the preaching of the word and then the third step is pleasing God with obedience to whatever he said that's what happened to Hannah right Hannah came there she was praying she was under expectation brother Branham said she started screaming that you don't hear what you'll hear when I'm said let me let me read this real quick I got it ready down here at the bottom of my notes look up brother Branham said he said she started screaming he said a lot of women were saying hey miss Jones has a new head on isn't that beautiful Oh mrs. John Doe she has the same old veil she wore the last ten years she said he said that's why they went to church but Hannah was going for another purpose he said god help us when we're going to the house of God not to see how when others dressed or see who's there but for one solid purpose that's to meet God a man exactly right now let me skip ahead here well Ram said no he said you're coming to the house of God with faith he got to faith first Hannah walked in she run down to the altar fell down raised up her hand and began to scream till she interrupted the whole service hallelujah Hannah I'm just gonna say holla do we need some Hannah's in our church we got one natural we got one natural Hannah we need some brothers that'll have that spirit of Hannah you understand the spirit of desperation you'll come here with such expectation you'll start praying in the house of God you'll start feeling God's President that's what we all want to feel God's presence we want to feel something then that we normally don't feel in the world we want to feel the sweetness and the holiness of Jesus Christ hallelujah he said she began to scream and interrupted the whole service even the priests thought she was drunk he said that's the way a whole lot of people that get sincere do brother asked a lot of sincere people like to scream sincere people how many appreciates sincere people when you're sincere you might screen you might cry you might raise your hand you might shout you might jump you might raise your hands and wave your hands when you're sincere with God something has to move in your life is that right he said they're just misunderstood she he wasn't drunk she was just misunderstood and many men and women who are really from the core of their heart fully surrendered to the Lord Jesus they're not crazy they're misunderstood yeah that's what I say about me I'm just misunderstood when I get in the spirit or get happier start weeping and crying or shouting or screaming or something like that it's they're just I'm just misunderstood I just loved Jesus so much I healed all my emotions to him that's what we all should do and we should all praise the Lord and we should all expect to hear from heaven this morning hey man see Hannah came to church for a different purpose she didn't come to see who was there she came to meet God she came under expectation which is the only way we should come to church heal I came out and said woman why you're always drunk on strong drinks she said My Lord I'm not drunk I'm praying the Lord take away my reproach he said the Lord granted to you the Lord bless you and that's all she wanted to know how many here would say I just want to know God's gonna bless me I just want to know God's gonna answer my heart's desire oh that's all Hannah God and she left there happy as she could be he said God's priests had announced God's blessing on her and she was at the house of God hey man that's exactly right church that's how we got to come to the house of God does that right understand I'm sorry does everybody understand okay well then we got to come with expectation I'm trying to get people to come early to pray or at least pray at your house make sure you're prayed up because listen Church you can feel it when you walk in the sanctuary you can feel it people are prayed up or not if you've got the Holy Spirit you can feel as program said as I start preaching I can tell who's interested in the service or not I can tell who's who's polling and who's bored I can tell I'm fighting a spiritual battle I'm not fighting against flesh and blood I'm fighting demon powers that are trying to keep the imparting of supernatural gifts away from you and the way for me all of us we've seen I just gave numerous examples I went out to New York and the pastor's daughter danced in the spirit when she wakes up from the drunken state she's in the back facing the wall faces the face in the clock she's so drunk in this peer she didn't know which way she was facing Church that's what the Holy Ghost does but the man said it makes you forget even what your name is it makes you just trust God and believe God and hang on to his word amen brother Brooks was preaching and a woman got healed with her left she's gonna raise her left hand she got here right there and come up testified right before the church seven people said they got filled with the Holy Ghost these signs follow them that believe but we have to have hearts that can hear we have to come with expectation we have to hear the word of God make sure we're hearing it not just listening at it hearing at it where it actually impacts our lives I don't know anybody he including myself that is so perfect hearing the Word of God you don't need to hear this sermon because if you did we'd see that we'd see the supernatural multiplying in your life we would hear sign after sign after sign that's why I share the testimonies when I go preach other places or we have here I share them to let you know that these signs follow true believers and that ought to create expectation our lives but brother Ram tells us how we do that we got to pray first before we come to church and he says if you pray before the service in the Holy Spirit you're guaranteed to hear from heaven but most people are not that interested they're more interested in their phones or their their families or their jobs or money or worldly things they're more interested in that and they don't have enough interest in the hearing of God's Holy Word they have so many voices and there's so many emails and so many texts and so many busy things that do to-do list they have so much to do they're hearing so many voices that they can't hear the voice of the Holy Spirit I want to hear they're still small voice of the Holy Spirit and it'll only come through the preaching of the word of God exactly right the brother man said how can I teach him algebra when they won't learn their ABCs how many want to go into spiritual algebra here that means you go into unknowns because algebra is always solving an unknown you got an unknown problem in your life that maybe you talked to me about you can't solve we need a gift of the Holy Spirit to move and operate in the church that will make known what is unknown it will either be a prophecy or to discern the thoughts intents of the heart it'll be divine healing this is what's keeping the healing away that's algebra when the Holy Spirit moves and you and I know it's moving we can sense his presence because we're in an atmosphere of expectation we're in an atmosphere of faith we know thus saith the Lord is here and gods shouldn't want to receive the blessings of God Amen that's exactly right but we got to come to church like we're supposed to come to church it's exactly right now go to Hebrews 4 - let's just read this real briefly here you remember God got so fed up with the Israelites he wouldn't let them in the Promised Land because they didn't mix faith with the hearing of Moses his preaching and you and I have the same responsibility today Hebrews 4 - the times I've seen the holy spirit moved the most is when the people were in the most prayer in Guyana when God did all those miracles brother max called me afterwards I even listening to it on the sermon - he said as we started preaching there they started having morning prayer meetings during the camp meeting and it was at the end of that camp meaning that I cast out five Devils I went back and listened to it to make sure but the demon the casting out didn't start right away they had to get in the atmosphere of expectation and then but I think it was the fourth day after praying four days in a row in the morning then demons got cast out if you want to see demons cast out Church we got to pray if you want to see miracles and the preachers trying to administer miracles we have to pray you have to pray first and get in the spirit and then come under expectation then hang on to the Word of God and receive the Word of God and watch it come to pass uh-huh it's God's perfect equation it's God's perfect supernatural equation amen Hebrews four - who'd like to read that for me now I saw your hand first thank you so good so you have to have a true preacher of the word of God but then you have to have faith which is assurance or revelation and then you'll profit from the preaching of the word of God remember brother Branham said I never went to church and left disappointed that means he was able to go to church and receive something from God every service praise the Lord do you think God's gonna invite his people his children to eat at this beautiful table that we have of the Word of God then not give them the best food that they could possibly have Church do you realize this I heard brother Diggs say this I was listen to his sermon did you realize this we have heard preaching that the Lutheran's never heard we are hearing preaching that the Wesley uns never heard we are hearing preaching that Paul even didn't even get to hear because the book of Revelation we're hearing preaching that the Xu's the street Pentecostals never got to hear and we're so what Satan's battling us so much we have a hard time even getting excited about it why it's not because the words not great their word is the revealed word of the hour it's because we're not praying first to get in the spirit of the word of God that's exactly right I'm gonna prove it to you by this there's a scripture to prove right there imma prove to you by quote as well the only time there's a lack of supernatural is when the word is not mixed with faith if you don't accept the faith the word of faith I'm preaching today it will do you no good you'll leave out here with a dull ear it's so serious you think God plays games with this word absolutely not we need ears that are circumcised the Bible says dole means heavy never feel like got a heavy ear that sounds pretty heavy to our ears should not be heavy our ears need to be circumcised that's what the word heavy means or dole means heavy eyes are so heavy that Jesus a they have eyes that can see but they can't see they have ears that can hear but they can't hear the word they're hearing they're not mixing it with faith they're not praying before they're just going to church to play church we should not play Church your spiritual life is going to decline you're going to be disappointed you're going to be miserable if you're not praying in the spirit and then grabbing ahold of God's revelations hey man exactly right Church that's real Christianity and don't look at anybody else say well if he would do it or she gets in the spirit I will you get in the spirit you be a leader you always want to be a leader be a leader the supernatural things pray first seek God believe God's were getting the spirits are a mending the word start agreeing with the word start supporting the word and watch your spiritual experience change amen faith comes by hearing brother Bram said the highest office in the world is a minister of the gospel there's no higher office not president not Republican not Democrat not House Speaker of the House the highest office in the world is a preacher now they're under the most responsibility as well right we have to be most we're stewards of the mysteries of God we handle the mysteries of God and we'll have to answer for everything we preach is that right so while we're given the highest office we have the highest amount of responsibility that's why I'm so glad when people grab ahold of the word that's preached and they see the miracle of God in their life hallelujah that's a true blessing that means we followed the leadership of the Holy Spirit that means the preacher found it the congregation found it we all followed the Holy Spirit's desire that's what we long to see Church hallelujah now we read Hebrews four to so see you got to mix the preaching with faith mix the preaching with faith with thus saith the Lord I'm receiving that as thus saith the Lord if we don't act upon it then it wasn't faith if that with the word preached today doesn't change our lives it'll have no impact on your life and then you didn't even mix it with faith you just mix it with a church membership church attendance you say we're both yes I'm not a preacher you don't have to be you can be a prayer warrior your prayer warrior is just as important as the preaching the preaching will accomplish nothing if you and I are praying do you understand church you have romancin we have to pray the blessings down without prayer there's no power because there's no sincerity praise God amen remember the first services we came the message you're always excited to hear something new right you came with expectation you're praying you're reading your Bible all the time well what happened you stopped reading your Bible and pray no hallelujah that's right that's why preachers can come in here on Sunday all pumped up filled with the Spirit has God's word burning in your heart to preach but if the people aren't in the same condition it'll just fall to the ground and it won't take any effect it's got to take effect upon lives but to get in the spirit you have to pray first and you have to obey the Word of God it's exactly right but we know we're under the the the Battle of the the love of many shall wax cold how many know that's in the scripture let's go that's go to Matthew 24:12 Matthew 24:12 this is the spirit we're fighting this lukewarm compromising spirit that's the spirit we're fighting the spirit of Antichrist look at verse prophets shall rise and shall deceive men we have that today big-name TV preachers their prophesy honest I see it all the time they prophesy that it's so broad or nothing and it never comes to pass it's just all this prophecy I'm a prophet let me speak the word upon you let me do all this nonsense look at verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold that's the our living in a cold spiritual time and you feel it and I feel it it feels so cold it's so hard to want to pray it's so hard to wanna raise your hands and pray we've got to press beyond that that's our battle we've got to press through and the way you do that is by praying and loving God and loving his people mother bear said the joy of a Christian is serving God at the house of the Lord and I wonder how many people believe that message most people say that say they believe the message don't actually believe the message because if they did they'd do what the message said it's exactly right because the Knik when he see it they start letting the compromise with little compromise it's just a little bit here a little bit there a little bit there then their love wax is cold instead of loving the people of God more they love them less and I wonder why God's not moving in their life more it's because they let iniquity in their lives and now they don't love people anymore and how do you know somebody loves you they'll tell you the truth hallelujah they'll tell you the truth that's how you know they love you that's right church that's exactly right amen to that brother Ram says this believe it's now this 1950 faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word that's what gives us faith before we can have faith we must have a basis for faith he said if I was going to get married and your wife would tell you that she would love you and how she'd be true to you you have her word then and then your faith it just depends on how you feel about it if her word is alright or not and that's the way we have to do anyway by faith we have to have the background of foundation and that's God's Word I know your wife and husbands gonna stay true to you they gave you their word you're trusting in their word I'd know God's gonna answer his prayer he always keeps his word he'll answer your prayer because he's always keeps his word you have to have a basis upon your faith well Bram said we are not saved by experiences nor by fasting nor by prayer there's one way we're saved that's faith through the word faith cometh by hearing hearing by the Word of God now the only thing that God could do to make his word real is to get some good preacher who can preach the word he said that's the official and initial way that faith comes by hearing hearing by the Word of God God said how can I get somebody to believe my word I'll give I'll give him a good solid gospel preacher hey man that's God's only way to try to get the people to have faith it's to send him a gospel preacher Easter program says the preaching that saves us look what he says next and law or grace 1954 but abandoned aux about how God is not in the big churches with the pipe organs and all the millions of thousand dollars they spend he said he's on he said but you'll get God in some little old mission somewhere you know you might find a whole lot up there you know some more spiritual vitamins God has got them for you to help your spirit up to pep you up a little that's the preaching of the gospel listen if the preaching won't pep up the church there's nothing that will see why people get nothing out of church they don't agree with the word they don't mix the preaching with faith they don't believe what the preacher saying so they get nothing out of church there's no other way to get something out of church than to agree with the Word of God and if I'm off the word you meet me in there afterwards and we get it straightened out but I haven't had anybody do that so I must be right on the Word of God well somebody has a spirit of fear right they're scared to talk about it so they have a spirit of fear on them but as far as I know by the Jose the holy spirit hasn't convicted me of anything I preached wrong amen and if I'm wrong you meet me in there so Bram said if I'm wrong he said you meet me in the room after let's talk about it in private hallelujah show me one time I didn't quote the Prophet or show me one time it wasn't the word we are hearing the word of God but we've got to believe it you're hearing it I'm hearing it but we've got to believe it like I said a few months ago I was getting sick I was preaching on the spoken word remember that I was getting sick I told to the church in my stomach I felt like I was gonna throw up and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I said this mountain of sickness is gonna move in a matter of 5 minutes I was happy again no sickness at all what is that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen I had to take that from the sermon and believe it I wasn't feeling like it for the amen I wasn't feeling good but I had to decide am I gonna believe the word or am I gonna believe my symptoms I believe the word and God showed up on the scene your choice you're either gonna mix this preaching with unbelief or gonna mix it with faith I say let's mix it with faith I'm trying to minister miracles I'm trying to minister healing I'm trying to minister salvation those that aren't saved in baptized I'm trying to minister sanctification to people but see the people all of us have to be in the spirit of agreement we have to agree with that word we have to accept that word and say that's mine if the preaching won't pep you up nothing will you can say why don't you play tapes lesson that's not God's way to do it God never put a tape on and said God never put a tape and said well well we're not have any live preachers God always had a live preacher I'm saying exactly what the tapes say anyway I'm preaching by the Rams message the thing is you're not ready to hear or people aren't ready to hear because they're not praying beforehand they're hungrier for things of the world than they are for God people need to repent and get right with God amen then the Word of God starts having an impact on their lives if preaching doesn't help it pop you up he said nothing will because that's God's Way God sent five gifts and I'm gonna make my church perfect I'm bringing them into perfection by these five gifts that's all I'm doing and the people have a choice well that's great or they are either mix it with unbelief or they'll say hallelujah praise God Amen Church the Bramson fight tonight if I could heal every person here and I have no power to do that he said I have no power to do that the only way a minister could do that is by preaching the word so by me coming back every service to preach to you it shows that I want you to be healed it shows I want you to be filled the Holy Ghost I want to be sanctified I want you to be free from any habit just by coming back here that shows you that I'm interested in God's Word coming to you now you've got to show your part and show that you're interested in receiving God's Word if I was off and on again well as brother just coming tonight on Wednesday night sometimes I've been late and sometimes people say well are you coming or not that's cuz I got meetings but you watch my life the last 11 and a half years I'm here every single time unless I'm dead sick at home because I'm that interested in you receiving the Word of God because that's the only way I can help you is by preaching God's Word to you but you have to be able to receive it as well I've walked out of here twice completely healed nothing I came in sick I walked out completely well what does that faith comes by hearing hearing the Word of God see we have a responsibility Church we forget sometimes the power of the preaching of the word don't we we forget the power the man said get the sick and afflicted here he says how can they be healed unless they're here to see it faith comes by hearing hearing the Word of God praise the Lord if you want to be healed you've got to come to church sometimes when you're sick you've got to because faith will rise when you hear the word of God glory you have to make a sacrifice you have to sign am i mixing this preaching with unbelief or faith am I going to be discouraged am I gonna be resenting the preacher or am I gonna accept that as God's Word if it's in the Bible it's God's Word amen like we saw Karen healed we saw a Marie healed praise God we see all these people healed because they have faith they're believing the preaching they're not sitting there upset they're not sitting there discouraged or oppress or depressed or angry they're sitting there enjoying God's Word loving every word amen it's exactly right you know brother Aaron said the Apostolic way of holding a meeting is you already said the way is this is a 1950 said listen the apostolic way of holding a meeting and this is what I do every service the Apostolic way of holding a meeting is to be preaching seeing what God is doing and then speaking it out where you find faith men and women to have faith in God and believe in God and God will grant it to them did you catch that did you catch that Loran so the only way to have an apostolic Holy Ghost meeting like the day of Pentecost is to preach it and find somebody that believes that's all I try to do every service my wife knows that find someone that will believe me because it's not me it's God's Word and Paul said preachers come to minister miracles to people but if they don't mix the hearing of the word with faith it don't profit them nothing coming to church doesn't mean nothing it's because of their own unbelief it's becoming because of their dull ears but we didn't have ears that are circumcised we have to believe God's Word amen hallelujah have to mix the word with faith but to have faith you got to praying it under expectation first prayer comes first brother BAM said the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you I'm gonna read that again I said it earlier if someone has a bad attitude they got a demon power on them and they won't receive the Word of God they're hindering the move of the Holy Spirit right here in the church the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is the spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promised that he's already done it how many want to believe God's Word if you don't even you have to recognize there's a spirit hanging over me it's doubt or it's fear or its bitterness or its unforgiveness or something that's anger or lust or something or greed or some Spears hanging over you you've got to confess that spirit then the spirit gets exposed and Satan hates to be exposed and when they're exposing and you cast it off and say I'm no longer gonna think this I'm no longer going to obey this that spirit has to go and then God sunshine can shine down upon you and you can receive the word of faith amen exactly right here I go amen thank the Lord Jesus exactly right I know what I'm talking about that's why when I get in the spirit and go other places and hear when people get in the spirit that's why we see miracles because I'm sent to bring you the Word of God I didn't come to Akron I don't even know there was an Akron God sent me to Akron and I'm here to minister God's Word that's my purpose in life but the word preach must be mixed with faith amen Brian Hawkins was a minister of supernatural remember Mary Ellen was sitting right there I was here on a Sunday morning I remember that service brother Brian preach just to Mary Ellen had told me out there and then in the vestibule what everyone called the hallway it's not really the best of you are too small to be a vestibule she told me on the hallway there the previous Wednesday she said well Jessie I fell at home and my my tailbone is numb I can hardly walk she Wednesday night she walked into Church here Sunday morning come brother Brian Hawkins is preaching he just preached on the line of the tribe of Judah how many remember that sermon I remember that sermon the Lion of the tribe of Judah she just comes up here for prayer brother Brian just says a simple prayer he doesn't scream doesn't cry doesn't shout like I do or maybe other people might but I've seen God heal people when I scream and shout and he prays for her she tells me the next one is she oh brother Jesse I forgot to tell you she said after he prayed for me I sat down and the pain instantly vanished she had it for what Monday Tuesday about six days brother Brian was a minister of America the doctor couldn't do it nobody could heal it but Jesus Christ healed it see that's what we're sent we're sent to be carriers of miracles I'm trying to work miracles but I got to get this cloud it's hanging over you right the cloud that hangs over trying to get that out of the way so you can just simply believe God's Word amen that's all we're trying to do preachers can do no more than preach the word but a man said the believer must have faith the RAM said praise heavenly Father I pray you'll bless them and give them eternal life right now there's nothing I could do I can call them to the altar put them in extra room doing all the work it takes to do it Lord we can't do no more than preach the word you said faith comes by hearing hearing the word now we preach the word and they've raised their hands that believe it now give them everlasting life you promised you would if they were sincere and raising their hands they'll go out of this building this morning a sweet meek humble Christian because you promised it and your words cannot fail that's all I can do is preach God's Word all I can do is try to get in the Holy Spirit let the Holy Spirit use me preach against all sin try to get all these spirits hanging over people try to get them out of the church so that God can move the Spirit of God can out pray in our church amen that's all I'm trying to do 411 half years and I'll keep doing it by God's grace I know who sent me I know what he called me to do it's exactly right now I got a few minutes here I promised myself I wouldn't go too far help me Jesus help me help me Jesus let me do this let me read this quote I got a long quote for you if from 1964 questions and answers this is a good a good quote I want you to pay attention if you can try to hang on dear brother Branham is it possible for one to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not to have signs following it at least not until some your time and conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit Oh ma'am said that's a really good question he says now the persons asking about the baptism Holy Ghost without signs following them he said now I'm going to answer this in a real juvenile way but if you're a normal human being you'll actually do the things that normal human beings would do he said when you're born to human the natural traits of the human being follow you he said well then that's when you're born a Christian born of the Spirit of God you naturally take up the attributes of Christ so he's saying they're asking will science always follow believers and he goes there's a child well if you have a normal child they're gonna pretty soon talk around two years old around one give or take a few weeks or months if they're a natural child they'll do natural things about Ram said if you're a natural born again Holy Ghost child then the signs will follow your life Oh hallelujah he says you have to watch these things because the Christian takes up the habits of a Christian for they men mentioned the word habit to me recently he said and they live like a Christian Jesus says these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils to take up serpents drink deadly things they'll speak with new tongues and then things just actually follow Christians that's why I rejoice when sister Naomi speaks in tongues because they follow believers approves over believers I believe in speaking in tongues it's sharing the evidence but it sure is God speaking to us when we pray for the interpretation prays to the heart now the person has a very good thing here or do we wait into the future time or the conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit I like that he said when it's appointed by the Holy Spirit God appoints things so brother Ham likes that every born-again Christian will have signs but it's at God's appointed time how many like that my brother have said when you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs I know listen you're so in love with Christ and believe every word he says to be the truth that's the evidence if you have the holy spirit your life's full of joy and oh my everything is different than what it used to be that's the Holy Spirit let me read this next part here and hold on to your seats make sure this doesn't blow you out of your chair jesus said a brother has to notice if every person in here was in perfectly harmony with the Holy Spirit and everyone he was filled with the Holy Ghost in harmony with the Holy Ghost then these signs would just be multiplying among you all the time did anybody catch that if everybody in here had the Holy Ghost well Graham said if I ask everybody raise your hand got the Holy Ghost he said 95% of hands that go up he said but if everybody's in one accord with the Holy Ghost these signs will be multiplying all the time they go from Amen to brother Adam to me to my wife to Jose to our sisters our brothers they just be multiplied if we're all filled with the Holy Ghost and we're all in harmony with the Holy Ghost do you believe that how many believe that part of the message I know a lot of people say they under maybe that part of the message if we're in harmony and filled with the Holy Ghost these things would just multiply among us hallelujah the greatest multiplication of signs miracles I saw was from 2010 it's about well now I guess I could say because every time I go someplace and people are filled the Holy Ghost sir sometimes somebody gets real in the spirit hear gottle do America because one day brother John and I prayed at the altar for 45 minutes that God would send miracles and gods are doing it right after that I remember that was a Sunday evening service I remember that in 2010 so I want you to know if everybody in here has the Holy Ghost and yet we're not seeing it multiply then that means we're out of harmony with the Holy Ghost but if we're not seeing it multiply then that means some people don't have the Holy Ghost but that's okay because we know where to get it it comes from Jesus amen he's the Good Samaritan he's got the oil in behind a man he'll pour it in but you gotta lay there and let him pour it in amen hallelujah like lay on the altar praise God like lay in your prayer closet hallelujah remember I don't follow the signs the signs follow me right when you go places when you pray God the signs follow you they follow you wherever you go that's where they go but where am said the groups that believe the whole nature the Holy Spirit flows through them and they're all full of love and joy and a great bundle of godly filled people that's the Holy Spirit how many want to be full of love and joy and a bundle of godly filled person I'm gonna be that that's what our church is to be and I know don't I'm not trying to discourage anybody but church but I know this is where we're going this is the vision of the church whoever comes whoever stays never goes it doesn't matter because we're living under the prophecy that the latter rain will be poured out upon this bride and I believe I'm a part of that bride and I believe it's gonna be poured out on me amen because I'm separating myself from all the things of the world and I'm clinging to Jesus Christ I'm not decreasing my love for Christ or my service or dedication to Christ I'm increasing it I'm not preaching less I'm preaching more I'm not going to church less I'm going to church more I'm not praying less I'm praying more praise God are you with me that's what it's gonna take it's gonna take a life a lamp that's trimmed and clean he says oh my now if the whole church should work in harmony like that then among us we'd be casting out Devils taking up serpents drinking deadly things all kinds of things going on see that we would see mark 16 more often if everybody's felt the Holy Ghost don't feel bad if you don't see him just get filled with the Holy Ghost or if you are filled with Holy Ghost just say praise God it's gonna happen sometime I'll just keep fouling the word I'll just keep saying in harmony with the Holy Spirit whenever the Holy Spirit preaches I'll say Amen I'll mix it with faith I'll obey the Word of God if we want to see God we got to draw close to God we can't draw away from God expect God to move the Bible says you've you draw nigh to him he'll do what the draw nigh to you he says oh he says our hearts are full of joy and happiness and oh my the birds are singing if you like that he said everything's wonderful my just full of the Spirit of God and we're so in love with Jesus we wanted to pray all night now there we go there we got a good test right there we want to pray all night we want to pray all day we're so in love with Jesus we just want to talk to him all day I don't appreciate this quote this is why as I study the message church you just have to trust me I study the message we have to go higher in Christ we can't pull back from our devotion to Christ because this is what the real Holy Ghost will produce right here never understand that program says if you really got the Holy Ghost everybody has a Holy Ghost here the signs of just keep multiplying see from one family to that family that family that family that family defin it just keep multiplying because they're in harmony with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is operating in their lives hallelujah my brother Graham said I've got to get the church out of babyhood and get them into manhood so I would say like this you you think about our church are we in babyhood where there's not much move with Holy Spirit or we in manhood where it's multiplying well Ram said when the signs and wonders are multiplying he said you're in spiritual manhood hey what what do you see in your life you see the song signs multiplying praise God I'm glad I do I'm glad I see that when people believe what I'm preaching and they're in the spirit God moves why because it's God's Way it's the only way to pump pep somebody up by the RAM said is to believe the preaching of the word of God if that doesn't pump you up nothing else will because the Word of God is life I said the Word of God is life its life it's eternal life I'm preaching God's eternal word of life but you've got a receipt we got to receive it or else it's not mixed with faith and our ears will be so heavy oh he's preaching on that again he's preaching on the Holy Ghost again I'm trying to preach the ticket to the rapture that's why I'm preaching on the Holy Ghost I'm trying to get people in the rapture God sent me to preach to get people in their rapture amen cuz I don't have a Wesley message I don't have a sir I'm more than a saint vacation message I don't have a Assembly of God message that's speaking in tongues I've got beyond that I'm trying to get the heavenly tongue amen or you'll meet Jesus in there and say hallelujah Jesus I long to see you I look upon your face let's go to the wedding marriage supper than I am that's what my message is that's brother Rams message that we preach the supernatural rapture let's send our feet I want to read one scripture Hebrews five it's close to this here's one way you know you're dull of hearing Hebrews chapter five Hebrews chapter five I didn't get to all this I didn't get hardly anything like I thought I would but that's okay Hebrews chapter five I don't know about you Church but I pray almost every service for God to do miracles almost every service many times I'll pray for your families I'll walk them down these roads and pray for your families I'll say God give them a revival God fill them with the Holy Ghost God bless their families and meet all their needs I'm constantly praying for supernatural why cuz that's my duty that's what I'm called to do and I know it operates when people just believe the Word of God I know it operates no one has to tell me that but see I'm trying to I'm trying to the Apostolic way and find somebody that believes me out here every preacher does that trying to find someone that will believe the preacher it's exactly right we must mix faith with the Word of God that's being preached oh it's so true so true Hebrews chapter 5 this is a worship series this is the best way to worship is to pray first get in the spirit hear the word of God then you want to worship because you receive God's word no one has to beg you to worship no one has to pump you up the Word of God already pumped you up praise God the Word of God already pumps you up Hebrews five now verse 10 called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing so Paul is saying I really would like to teach you more about Melchizedek and if you read on he does in Chapter seven he does but before he breaks in to Melchizedek he's gonna lay this out how do you know someone's dull of hearing they're not what they're supposed to be in the eyes of God God has called them to be more than what they are that's how you know someone is dull of hearing they're not where they're supposed to be spiritually in other words they're out of place look at verse 12 for when for when for the time he ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat verse 13 for everyone that everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil I wonder if we just would bow our heads for a moment I wonder are we everything we ought to be let's just real let's examine our lives real close now I wonder if someone here ought teachers ought to be prayer warriors ought to be doing some or some specials off to be praying at the altar is there something you ought to be doing but you're not not help us today for the scripture tells us our ears have become dull
