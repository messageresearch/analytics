[0:02] Tonight I'd like to uh preach on
[0:04] cherubam and saraphim by God's grace. So
[0:07] I want to look at angels again. I hope
[0:09] you're enjoying the angel series here by
[0:10] God's grace. I just got a question about
[0:13] it a couple weeks ago and I devoted some
[0:16] time to studying it. I've really been
[0:17] enjoying it. It's been a real refresher
[0:18] to me.
[0:20] It's Isaiah chapter 6 here by God's
[0:22] grace.
[0:24] We'll just do uh one and two. Isaiah 61
[0:26] and two.
[0:37] So, we'll have a word of prayer. I'm
[0:38] sorry. We'll read our text and then I
[0:40] think we'll have a word of prayer. I
[0:41] don't see Ocelina. So, I wonder if Lena,
[0:43] you know, still trying to keep food
[0:44] down. We want to pray for her. We did
[0:46] pray for her at the beginning of the
[0:47] service. Like to keep her in prayer by
[0:49] God's grace. Isaiah 61 and two here.
[0:54] So, I'll read verse one. Then we can all
[0:55] read uh verse two. In the year that King
[0:58] Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting
[1:01] upon a throne high and lifted up, and
[1:03] his train filled the temple. Let's read
[1:05] verse two on three. One, two, three.
[1:08] Above it stood the saraphims. Each one
[1:11] had six wings. With twain he covered his
[1:14] face, and with twain he covered his
[1:16] feet, and with twain he did fly. Let's
[1:19] have one more word of prayer. If you
[1:20] have a need on your heart, let's make it
[1:21] known to God here tonight. Let's pray
[1:22] for our sister Lena. Haven's sick and
[1:24] Lydia's sick. That's why they couldn't
[1:26] make it. and my wife just stayed home to
[1:28] help out. Thank God Tulsi is doing good
[1:30] and we're thankful for that. Um so we
[1:32] want to lift them up in prayer here
[1:34] today by God's grace. So let's pray.
[1:36] Father God, we're thankful again to be
[1:38] in your house, Lord. We're hastening to
[1:39] you, Lord God. We're not letting the
[1:40] world pull us away from the house of
[1:42] God. We're not letting the world pull us
[1:43] away from the word. Hallelujah. We love
[1:45] to worship and sing your praises. Thank
[1:47] you for reminding us that we are the
[1:49] bride of Jesus Christ, Lord. Not by just
[1:51] profession, but by experience, Lord God,
[1:53] and by the word of God. Hallelujah. by
[1:56] the spirit and by the truth. Lord, as
[1:58] we've said many times, some of us were
[2:00] raised in denomination and we can see
[2:02] now that there's more truth in this
[2:04] light, Lord God. We're so thankful to be
[2:06] walking in this light. We would say the
[2:08] mysteries of God are finished in this
[2:10] light. Hallelujah. We rejoice in that,
[2:12] Lord, today. What a glorious light.
[2:14] We'll walk in the light. Such a
[2:16] beautiful light. Hallelujah. So, Father,
[2:19] Lord, just minister now by your spirit.
[2:20] We pray for our sister Lena, Lord. Lord,
[2:23] we just ask God that your spirit will
[2:25] help her to get through this first
[2:26] trimester and of course the whole
[2:28] pregnancy. We prayed over that and
[2:29] dedicated this child already and this
[2:31] pregnancy into your mighty loving hands,
[2:33] Lord Jesus. But be with her in a special
[2:35] way tonight if she's not feeling well,
[2:37] Lord God. Let your will be done.
[2:38] Hallelujah. We give you glory and
[2:40] praise, Lord Jesus, here tonight.
[2:42] Strengthen us, Lord, in this simple
[2:43] short little message. I pray you speak
[2:45] to your people here tonight in Jesus
[2:47] Christ's name. The saints said, "Amen."
[2:50] God bless you. As you being seated,
[2:51] we'll trust the Lord will speak to uh
[2:55] Sister Lena, minister to Lena here by
[2:57] God's grace.
[3:03] So, I'll just briefly review here. Uh I
[3:05] got a little quote on my phone I want to
[3:06] make sure I got to. Okay. Uh so, I'll
[3:10] just briefly review, you know, as I
[3:11] study this and think about it more and,
[3:13] you know, read the scripture. Pardon me,
[3:15] I mean a tissue.
[3:18] um it just becomes a little more clear.
[3:20] Trust everybody had a good uh start to
[3:21] the week thanks to communion. Praise
[3:23] God. Amen. Renewing your communion with
[3:25] the Lord. It's always a blessing. Of
[3:28] course, I feel strengthened and had a
[3:31] beautiful testimony on Monday night.
[3:32] That was such a wonderful thing. So,
[3:33] I'll share that at the end. Uh
[3:36] but we've seen the angel Lord. It's God
[3:39] confirming his covenants with his own
[3:41] messages. Right? So, we see who the
[3:44] angel Lord is. It's God. And of course,
[3:46] then there's general angels. we would
[3:48] call ministering spirits. We would call
[3:50] them they're an angel of the Lord. Um
[3:54] so we see that in the scripture, you
[3:55] know, Psalm 37:4 and we saw that in uh
[3:59] Hebrews chapter 1. Hallelujah. And these
[4:01] are deliverance messengers for the heirs
[4:04] of salvation. Hallelujah.
[4:07] And so that will tie in uh to the
[4:08] testimony as well because I realized,
[4:10] you know, this testimony was linked to
[4:12] my life being saved. I forgot about that
[4:14] when I was maybe seven or eight years
[4:16] old. Um, so those are two the first two
[4:18] kinds of angels. You know, angel of the
[4:20] Lord and then the administering spirits.
[4:22] Now, I I did say on Sunday this is true.
[4:24] You know, I could be wrong on some of
[4:26] this. So, I'm not trying to take any uh
[4:29] stand on anything. If somebody showed me
[4:31] a scripture I missed, I would instantly
[4:33] say, "I'm sorry. I'm wrong." But this is
[4:35] not a major. This is a minor.
[4:36] Hallelujah. But it's quite an
[4:38] encouraging minor when you know God's
[4:40] angels are with you. Hallelujah. To know
[4:42] that you're not alone. Hallelujah. That
[4:44] God's with you. God's protecting you.
[4:46] uh through his messengers. Hallelujah.
[4:50] So, as I said, you know, these these
[4:52] guardian angels may be cherubam. Okay?
[4:54] They may be um and so I'll deal with
[4:57] that just briefly a little bit more here
[4:59] tonight uh by God's grace. But cherubam
[5:01] are throne guards or mercy seat guards
[5:05] and they provide unceasing worship to
[5:08] God. Right? We saw that in uh Revelation
[5:10] 4:8. They they cry without ceasing.
[5:12] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[5:14] Almighty. Amen.
[5:17] And then tonight, Lord willing, we'll
[5:18] look at uh Saraphim here uh by God's
[5:20] grace. Now, my wife had a good question,
[5:22] but I just want to read this here. And
[5:24] um you know, there's a little bit of uh
[5:27] uh there's little there's sometimes
[5:28] there's questions and she had a good
[5:29] question. Uh brother Random called the
[5:31] four beasts cherubam.
[5:34] Okay, just so you know. So, the four
[5:36] beasts are called cherubam. They're also
[5:38] called living creatures, right? Living
[5:40] creatures. Uh they're called beasts. The
[5:43] beast in the Greek is zoo. Zunes z o n
[5:47] zun they're called that's the Greek
[5:49] word. Um but brother calls him cherubam
[5:52] in 1961 revelation chapter 5 part two.
[5:56] He says John could not see into there.
[5:59] He only seen those fourheaded or he says
[6:02] those four beasts standing there or
[6:04] those four cherubams standing there
[6:06] guarding the holy place. Okay. So what's
[6:10] interesting church is on the ark of the
[6:12] covenant you had two cherubam but in
[6:14] God's heavenly throne you have four
[6:16] cherubam I can't understand that I can't
[6:19] explain that maybe God will give the
[6:21] revelation to one of you all right but
[6:24] alls I know is in heaven there's four
[6:26] brother Chris but on earth when Moses
[6:29] made a an image of it he just put two
[6:32] cherubam there so I can't explain that
[6:34] but I believe it hallelujah I believe
[6:37] every word of god hallelujah now in
[6:39] previous years you might have remembered
[6:41] I thought maybe uh Lucifer was one of
[6:43] them and then uh Michael was the other
[6:46] Lucifer fell so God replaced him kind of
[6:47] like Judas fell and God replaced him you
[6:49] know I might have said that in years
[6:51] past I think I did and so again to show
[6:53] I don't know everything about angels I'm
[6:55] just glad I got one praise God I'm just
[6:57] glad that I fear God hallelujah and that
[7:00] God sends his angel to protect me to
[7:03] deliver me because I can I cannot do it
[7:05] church you and I were no match for the
[7:07] devil
[7:08] &gt;&gt; we are no match for him except greater
[7:11] is he that's in us than he that's in the
[7:13] world. Hallelujah. And then God even on
[7:15] top of that God will send angels to
[7:17] protect us. Hallelujah. And strengthen
[7:19] us.
[7:21] Now um so we have angel lord ministering
[7:24] spirits guardian angels and then we have
[7:27] cherubam. Now if you remember the fifth
[7:29] seal brother talked about the four
[7:31] beasts in the fifth seal because there
[7:33] was no more beasts in the fifth, sixth
[7:35] and seventh seals. There was only a
[7:37] beast on the first four seals. The beast
[7:40] turned and said to John, you know, the
[7:41] beast, the second seal, third, fourth,
[7:43] but in the fifth, there was no beast.
[7:45] And so, Brother takes the first hour of
[7:47] that sermon before he gets into the Jews
[7:49] under the fifth seal. And he kind of
[7:51] rehearses those four beasts. And he was
[7:54] showing how uh in the in the uh let's
[7:58] see, it would be the uh second the
[8:00] second anointing, the threat in church
[8:03] age.
[8:05] Brother Ram said they had the ox
[8:06] anointing and he said the little church
[8:09] could do nothing but just simply labor.
[8:13] Right? So the first anointing was lion
[8:16] boldness power. Right? The early
[8:19] apostles in fact I've never met anyone
[8:21] who had close to a ministry like the
[8:23] apostles except brother Brandham. Right?
[8:27] But the the ministry of brother of uh
[8:29] the apostles was lion bold the king of
[8:32] the beast right king of the jungle. That
[8:34] was the early church. But then the
[8:36] anointings shifted, right, to the ox
[8:38] anointing where they just labored for
[8:41] God, right? An ox will just labor, give
[8:43] its life freely, right? Die as a
[8:46] sacrifice. It'll just give its life.
[8:48] Okay? And then brother Ram said another
[8:51] thing, the ox also is a beast of
[8:52] sacrifice. They give their lives just as
[8:55] freely as they could in the dark ages.
[9:00] a thousand years there, Catholicism
[9:01] controlled the world and they just went
[9:04] right in. Yes or no, they didn't mind
[9:07] dying.
[9:09] A church we see, you know, like Charlie
[9:10] Kirk or we see someone who's, you know,
[9:13] assassinated or even JFK, which we don't
[9:15] think he was a believer unless unless he
[9:17] repented in the last moments. But we see
[9:19] things like that and it just hurts us.
[9:21] Or did you see this week I think it was
[9:23] uh 31 Christians were beheaded in uh uh
[9:27] what was it Zimbabwe or Nigeria? Forgive
[9:30] me if I got the wrong uh but ISIS
[9:32] beheaded over 30 Christians and they
[9:35] just what they do they just freely gave
[9:37] their life. Right? They're willing to
[9:40] they're willing to just die and not
[9:42] recant the precious name of Jesus
[9:44] Christ.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Now that's real faith right there. It's
[9:48] an anointing.
[9:50] He said they didn't mind dying. If it
[9:51] was death, brother said that's all
[9:53] right. They went and died anyhow. Why?
[9:56] The very spirit of the age. He's talking
[9:58] about the ox anointing. Now, Simon
[10:00] mentioned this earlier. Listen, church.
[10:02] If if the four horse riders, if the pale
[10:04] horse rider was a combination of all all
[10:07] three, right? The previous three, the
[10:09] fourth was a combination of well then
[10:11] perhaps this eagle anointing is a
[10:12] combination of all three previous as
[10:14] well.
[10:16] And then that would make sense if people
[10:17] are dying today and freely giving their
[10:19] lives, you know, putting their head on
[10:21] the chopping block. We'd say in a way,
[10:24] then perhaps that that is the uh uh
[10:27] perhaps that is the truth that this
[10:29] eagle anointing then would be a
[10:31] combination. Hallelujah. Now, the reason
[10:34] I bring this up is because I preached
[10:36] recently on the throne of God and we
[10:37] showed how your heart or your soul is
[10:40] the throne of God.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[10:44] So see there's there's there's some kind
[10:46] of connection. And then brother Ram
[10:47] says, "You're anointed with the eagle
[10:49] anointing,
[10:51] which brother Ram calls a cherub."
[10:55] Cherubam.
[10:57] So we have an anointing of an angel. I
[10:59] wouldn't say an angel, but we have the
[11:00] anointing of the Holy Ghost with certain
[11:03] attributes to it that are like it unto
[11:06] an eagle. And the best example is like
[11:08] the spirit of Elijah. The spirit of
[11:10] Elijah is the Holy Spirit, but it's the
[11:12] Holy Spirit with certain
[11:14] characteristics,
[11:16] right? To match the time in which the
[11:19] men lived. So, I hope this makes sense,
[11:21] brother Chris, by God's grace might be
[11:23] kind of new to you. But Elijah had at
[11:25] least five characteristics. And of
[11:27] course, I found a sixth one today. Now,
[11:29] this is just my humble opinion, but
[11:31] brother said, well, the Bible says
[11:33] Elijah spoke with thus sayith the Lord.
[11:34] That's part of his anointing. The second
[11:36] is re he rebuked all the religious
[11:39] leaders for his day. Brother Ramman died
[11:41] of this generation of preachers right in
[11:43] 1963. Third, he rebuked immoral women.
[11:46] John the Baptist did uh right Herod, I'm
[11:49] sorry, Herodiius uh and then Elijah,
[11:52] Jezebel, brother Brandham, Jaclyn
[11:54] Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, right? All the
[11:56] all the immoral women. Fourth, they were
[11:59] men of the wilderness, right? Brother
[12:01] Ram loved the wilderness. Elijah, John
[12:03] the Baptist, was in the wilderness from
[12:04] the time he was 9 years old till 30.
[12:08] Number five, they had uh obvious human
[12:11] weaknesses when the anointing left them.
[12:14] Right? Elijah, we saw it last week, he
[12:16] ran to a cave and beg God to take him
[12:19] home and die, right? Uh John the Baptist
[12:22] when he's enthroned in prison, he says,
[12:24] "Was Jesus the Messiah or do we look for
[12:26] another?"
[12:28] Brother Brham, when the anointing leaves
[12:29] him, he said, "I I don't even know if
[12:30] I'm a prophet. I'm not a prophet. But I
[12:32] don't call myself a prophet. Yet when
[12:33] the angel's there, he says, "Do you
[12:35] believe me to be God's prophet?"
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[12:39] So when the anointing leaves and God
[12:41] allows trials to come in, these men show
[12:44] their human side. And church, we all
[12:46] show our human side.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; We're not bashing Elijah, John the
[12:49] Baptist, Elisha, Brother Brandham, or
[12:51] the future Elijah to come with Moses.
[12:53] Whether it's Moses and Elijah themselves
[12:55] come back, or if it's men with the same
[12:57] spirit.
[12:58] Now the sixth one I found today is I
[13:00] realized this. Brother Brandham said
[13:02] this in God hiding himself in
[13:04] simplicity. He's talking about Elijah
[13:05] humbled himself and stayed with what God
[13:07] said in such a way that it pleased God
[13:10] to take that same spirit from Elijah and
[13:13] promised to shove it. Which is
[13:15] interesting. Shove it three times down
[13:17] the road from there. And he did it.
[13:20] Hallelujah.
[13:22] Sure. Sure he did. He said he promised
[13:24] it would come. It would come upon Elisha
[13:26] his successor. Then come on, John the
[13:28] Baptist. And according to Malachi 4,
[13:30] it's supposed to be here again in the
[13:32] last day. And it was here. Hallelujah.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Now, look what brother says. Here's the
[13:36] next thing I want to get to. God loved
[13:38] that spirit that was on that simple,
[13:41] uneducated woodsman
[13:44] from back there in the woods somewhere.
[13:46] It was so obedient to his word. He could
[13:49] say, "Elijah, do this." And Elijah would
[13:51] do it. God hid himself in there in such
[13:54] simplicity.
[13:56] Hallelujah. that God wanted to use that
[13:57] spirit five times. Brother Chris, think
[13:59] about that. God loved that man. He was
[14:01] so obedient. God would tell him, "Go say
[14:03] this. Thus say the Lord. Go say that.
[14:05] Thus say the Lord." Elijah would do it.
[14:07] And God said, "I love that so much. I'm
[14:09] going to use that four more times."
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, that's what I'm
[14:14] trying to get you to see. If if Elijah's
[14:17] spirit is just the Holy Ghost with
[14:19] certain attributes, well, then the eagle
[14:22] anointing must be the Holy Ghost with
[14:23] certain attributes.
[14:26] Now by the Bible, what attributes do we
[14:28] see? Remember Jesus said where the
[14:30] carcass is, the eagles will be gathered.
[14:34] So what's the attribute of eagle? They
[14:36] go to where the word is freshly killed.
[14:39] They go to the fresh revelation. They go
[14:42] to the latest message from God. They
[14:44] won't go back to Pentecost.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; They won't go back uh to Martin Lu
[14:49] Luther and John Wesley, right? They
[14:52] won't go to that. They're not going to
[14:53] go to something that's rotting.
[14:55] as far as I say like dust, right? They
[14:57] won't go back to the dust. They'll go to
[14:59] some meat that they can eat. Praise God.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; And they're gathered, all the eagles are
[15:03] gathered eating eagle food, which church
[15:05] is the Bible. Praise God.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Eagle food right here, Brother Chris.
[15:09] Amen. Not a creed, not a denomination.
[15:12] They're eating eagle food, which is the
[15:13] word of God, the fresh word of God for
[15:15] today. Hallelujah. Amen. There's a
[15:18] second uh characteristics. They fly or
[15:22] dwell up in heavenly places above the
[15:25] world, right? They're they're airborne
[15:28] animals. They they live in heavenly
[15:30] places. And of course, we know that's
[15:32] another symbol for revelation. They have
[15:35] a greater revelation than the other
[15:36] animals.
[15:39] Now, church, we don't brag about that or
[15:41] anything like that, but we have to admit
[15:42] the revelation of the seven seals were
[15:44] was not given for almost 2,000 years
[15:47] until God gave it to brother Brandham.
[15:49] So for that we're humbled. For that
[15:51] we're thankful. But we're not going to
[15:53] pat ourselves on the back calling us the
[15:54] greatest of all time. But we're going to
[15:57] say, "Thank you, Lord, that you chose th
[15:59] this is just the day you chose to reveal
[16:01] it in. So we'll accept it. We'll believe
[16:03] it. And we'll be able to fight off the
[16:05] antichrist spirit because we've got the
[16:07] spirit of the of God Almighty, the
[16:09] spirit of the flying eagle."
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And we won't be drawn
[16:14] uh into the pale horse rider who church
[16:17] as we know is riding with all this
[16:18] ecumenical talk now. Right.
[16:23] What is today? The eth. Okay. That's
[16:25] coming up. Did I tell you that? Uh that
[16:27] all there's 50 churches. I'm sorry.
[16:30] There there's 50 tents going to be lined
[16:32] up in Washington DC. It might be start
[16:33] tomorrow and they're going to line up 50
[16:35] tables where every state's going to have
[16:37] Christians and they're going to have the
[16:38] largest communion ever in Washington DC.
[16:40] It's this weekend.
[16:42] and Catholics, Protestants, everybody's
[16:44] coming together to unite to have
[16:45] communion. Church, we will not be there.
[16:49] You cannot have communion with devils.
[16:52] These false prophets that make all these
[16:54] false prophecies and they fail time
[16:56] after time. We would not take communion
[16:58] with them. The Bible says a man like
[17:00] that you don't even let inside your
[17:01] house.
[17:03] Hallelujah. That's what first uh I'm
[17:06] sorry, that's what second John 1 says.
[17:08] If a man tries to bring any other false
[17:10] do any other false doctrine, don't even
[17:12] let him in your house. Well, then how
[17:13] can you have communion with him if you
[17:14] won't let him into your house? Would you
[17:16] let him in the house of God? Of course
[17:17] not. Hallelujah. Now, there's another
[17:21] attribute is the renewed strength. The
[17:23] Bible says God will renew our strength
[17:26] if we wait upon the Lord.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we have at least three
[17:30] attributes. Praise God. We have
[17:32] revelation that's high above the things
[17:34] of the world, right? We get our strength
[17:37] renewed. Hallelujah. So we won't go back
[17:40] to the things of the world because God
[17:41] will give us strength to start fighting
[17:42] again.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then we all gather
[17:46] around the fresh revelation of the word
[17:48] of God.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Malachi and I were at a Bible study on
[17:51] Monday night. And Malachi would probably
[17:54] I hope you say amen to this. No
[17:55] pressure. But we had all these guys
[17:58] sharing their different opinions about
[17:59] Roh Markap 11.
[18:02] But only one guy had the revelation of
[18:04] this hour.
[18:06] Hallelujah. They're giving all these
[18:08] ideas about the fig tree and all these
[18:10] things. That guy was me. Amen. And well,
[18:12] these two guys, Malachi and I, they're
[18:15] guessing about what is speaking the
[18:16] mountains mean and what is all this.
[18:20] Hallelujah. And I just waited for my
[18:22] turn. Hallelujah. You want to know what
[18:23] it means? I'll tell you what it means.
[18:26] Because we've got So, we gather around
[18:28] the fresh word of God. Hallelujah. And
[18:30] we know WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE
[18:32] GOD'S GIVEN US THUS sayith the Lord.
[18:34] Hallelujah. Amen.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; There's no stuttering. There's no
[18:37] wonder. I wonder if this or wonder if
[18:38] that. Well, my friend said that. My dad,
[18:40] my mom said that. No, A PROPHET OF GOD
[18:42] said this. Hallelujah.
[18:45] But we say it humbly, right? We say it
[18:47] humbly.
[18:50] Now, so church there, so what I'm saying
[18:52] is there is some connection to the
[18:54] cherubam that are at the throne of God
[18:56] in heaven. And then brother Ram saying
[18:58] we have the anointing of the flying
[19:01] eagle cherubam
[19:03] in our souls.
[19:05] Now it's only the Holy Ghost because
[19:07] you're you're uh sealed to the day of
[19:08] redemption by the Holy Spirit. It's the
[19:10] Holy Spirit of God.
[19:12] But there's some connection to that. So
[19:15] that's why I said, you know, uh your
[19:17] guardian angel may be a cherub, right?
[19:20] Because it's your anointing for that
[19:21] day. It may be that, right? Maybe the
[19:23] flying eagle. But for certain the the
[19:26] Holy Ghost that our souls are sealed
[19:28] with, right, has the attribute of a
[19:31] flying eagle. That's all we can do is
[19:34] act like flying eagles.
[19:36] And it might be a combination of the
[19:38] three previous uh characters, right? You
[19:41] got the lion, the ox, and the man
[19:43] anointing all into one. If that's
[19:46] because that's how the pale horse rider
[19:48] was. Uh the white, black, I'm sorry,
[19:50] white, red, black. I'm sorry. Right.
[19:52] Yeah. Right. Yeah. white, red, black
[19:54] into one. That's right. Yeah. Because
[19:56] dark ages. Okay. Now, I'll just say like
[20:00] that. This is so not extremely clear to
[20:02] me. Does everybody understand? I'm not
[20:04] saying I'm I got it exactly right, but
[20:06] I'm just trying to connect some of these
[20:07] teachings. They're all kind of coming
[20:09] together in this little sermon series
[20:10] here. And the church said,
[20:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I'm exactly right. In
[20:13] fact, if somebody shows me after church
[20:15] I'm wrong, I'll come back and say I'm
[20:16] wrong on Sunday because I'm not making a
[20:18] major out of a minor. I'm keeping in a
[20:21] minor, but I'm giving you these
[20:22] attributes that there is some
[20:23] connection. If our heart is a throne, if
[20:25] our soul's a throne, and there's
[20:27] cherubams up there on the throne of God,
[20:29] and now we're the throne of God, there's
[20:31] some connection here by the grace of
[20:32] God, right? And we're anointed with the
[20:34] flying eagle cherub anointing, there's
[20:37] some connection. And the church said,
[20:39] &gt;&gt; "All right, I just want you to get that
[20:40] there by God's grace." Now, give me 15
[20:42] minutes to close here. Hallelujah. What
[20:44] a statement. I never thought I'd ever
[20:45] say that, but I guess life throws you
[20:48] some uh interesting seasons of life.
[20:51] Now, let's go now to the seraraphim by
[20:53] God's grace. Hallelujah. There there's
[20:55] only two verses on seraraphim in the
[20:56] whole Bible, so this ain't going to take
[20:57] us extremely long maybe to get through
[21:02] and then I got two quotes here. So,
[21:04] Sarapum, Isaiah 6. Now, we were there.
[21:06] Isaiah 6. Now uh brother Ham even uses
[21:09] this word uh from Scoffield's uh co
[21:13] commentary.
[21:15] The word uh saraphim in the Hebrew means
[21:19] fiery or burner.
[21:22] Okay? So it's a burner angel or a fiery
[21:28] angel. And why is that? Because they
[21:30] have tongues and they're able to to grab
[21:34] a coal from the altar of God.
[21:37] right now, church. And here's another
[21:39] thing I don't know. I don't know if
[21:40] they're taking coals from the altar of
[21:43] the burnt offering, which would be in
[21:44] the outer court, like the brazen altar
[21:46] was in Moses' day, or if they're taking
[21:49] coals from the uh altar of incense where
[21:52] the prayers would be. Now, my guess is
[21:55] maybe the prayer because it's closer to
[21:57] the throne of God, but I don't know,
[22:00] right? I don't know. Um, and again, I'm
[22:03] not I think I even said this before. Uh,
[22:06] that brazen altar thrown there or brazen
[22:08] altar there in heaven that might not be
[22:11] there, but the brazen altar might be the
[22:14] throne of Jesus because that's where the
[22:15] blood of Christ is. So, I'm getting kind
[22:18] of deep here into some deep thoughts,
[22:19] but I just remember I showed you the
[22:21] pictures on on Wednesday. I'm just
[22:23] saying I don't know for sure. It's a
[22:24] great mystery, but one day that mystery
[22:26] will become reality. Hallelujah. Then
[22:29] we'll know. Oh, the Bible said we'll
[22:30] know even as we're known in heaven.
[22:32] Hallelujah. Thank God heaven knows who
[22:35] we are. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, so we see
[22:38] Saraphim in in Isaiah 6:2.
[22:42] Now, I'm going to turn there just so I
[22:43] got Let's go to Isaiah 63.
[22:49] I think I just like to read that. Okay.
[22:51] Now, and one cried unto another.
[22:54] So, there are saraphims,
[22:56] more than one. Hallelujah. Just like
[22:58] archangels, the Bible said just like
[23:00] cherubims or cherubams.
[23:03] And then uh here are saraphims.
[23:07] Verse three. And he cried one to another
[23:10] and said, "Holy, holy is the Lord of
[23:12] hosts. The whole earth is full of his
[23:14] glory." How many can say amen to that?
[23:17] Hallelujah. Church, that means Akran is
[23:19] full of the glory of the Lord. Amen.
[23:21] Praise God. Hallelujah. Verse four. And
[23:24] the post of the door moved at the voice
[23:27] of him that cried glory.
[23:31] And the house was filled with smoke. So
[23:34] again, that could be the brazen altar or
[23:36] that could be the altar of incense and
[23:38] all the smoke that comes off of that
[23:40] spiritual throne in heaven. Spiritual
[23:43] smoke, spiritual fire, just like the
[23:44] spiritual fire on the day of Pentecost,
[23:46] right? Licks a fire over their heads.
[23:49] Yes.
[23:51] Now verse five. And then I said, "Then
[23:53] said I, woe is me, for I'm undone,
[23:55] because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I
[23:57] dwell in the midst of a people of
[23:58] unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen
[24:01] the King, the Lord of Hosts."
[24:04] So see again, if if anyone comes in the
[24:06] presence of God and they're not
[24:08] repented, they're going to feel very
[24:10] filthy and unclean.
[24:12] But the best part is that Isaiah
[24:14] recognized he needed cleansing.
[24:16] Hallelujah.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; And that's that that's the spirit of
[24:18] judgment. Remember that series? The
[24:19] spirit of judgment tells you, "I'm I'm
[24:21] filthy. I'm unclean. I don't deserve it.
[24:23] I'm nobody. I've sinned. I've done
[24:26] iniquities. All these things. But then
[24:28] the spirit of burning will come to
[24:30] cleanse us from our sins.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. Oh, hallelujah. Amen.
[24:36] Verse six. Then flew one of the
[24:38] seraraphims unto me, having a live coal
[24:41] in his hand, which he had taken from the
[24:43] tongs from off the altar. So this angel
[24:45] has tongs, right? Like we do with
[24:47] spaghetti, whatever you use. He had a
[24:49] tong. He grabs a coal and he flies down
[24:53] from heavenly realm down into the earth
[24:55] realm.
[24:57] Right? Verse seven. And he laid it on my
[25:00] mouth. Now he didn't he didn't throw it
[25:02] on his mouth, right? He didn't bash it
[25:04] there. He lays it there. Right? Look at
[25:07] the look at the gentleness of God.
[25:08] Hallelujah. Just like the angel touched
[25:10] Eli Elijah when he was worn out. He lays
[25:13] it there. Hallelujah. The gentleness of
[25:16] God. Lo, this hath uh touched thy lips,
[25:20] and thine iniquity is taken away, and
[25:23] thy sin is purged. Hallelujah. Amen. So,
[25:27] look at this. Angel, oh my hallelujah.
[25:29] Had a part in the plan of God to bring
[25:32] fire down from heaven and it caused all
[25:36] the iniquity to be sent away. And it
[25:38] caused all of his sins to be purged. An
[25:41] angel did that. Hallelujah.
[25:44] an angel allowed Isaiah to experience
[25:46] what it's like for his sins to be uh uh
[25:49] to cast away and then for him to feel
[25:52] like he was clean or the Hebrew there is
[25:55] atonement he felt at one with God. Oh my
[26:00] if we've ever felt one with God perhaps
[26:03] it was the saraphim perhaps it was God's
[26:05] angel that brought his presence that
[26:08] cleaned us out and now we feel united
[26:11] with God. Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Remember, because church,
[26:14] remember, is he not the same yesterday,
[26:16] today, and forever?
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:20] So, if God sent a seraraphim to touch a
[26:22] prophet, would God send a seraphim down
[26:25] to touch others? It's very possible. I'm
[26:27] not saying absolutely, but if you ever
[26:29] get cleansed, if you ever feel that your
[26:31] sins have been taken away, hallelujah,
[26:33] and there's a fountain filled with blood
[26:35] that's drawn from Emanuel's veins and
[26:38] your sins have been plunged beneath that
[26:41] the flood and you felt you've lost all
[26:44] your guilty stains. Hallelujah. THEN
[26:46] IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A SARAPHIM BROUGHT
[26:48] FIRE FROM HEAVEN TO CLEANSE your heart
[26:51] and life. Hallelujah.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:57] A live coal, a fiery coal was laid on
[27:02] his mouth and it cleansed them from all
[27:05] iniquity. Now look what brother says in
[27:08] influence. This is after the seals. He
[27:11] said, "And here was these saraphims
[27:13] covered their holy faces, covered their
[27:15] feet with two wings.
[27:18] They went into action, reverent, humble,
[27:21] and inaction." That's what the three
[27:22] sets of uh wings represent, saints.
[27:28] Reverent, humble, and in action.
[27:30] Reverent is your face covered. Humble is
[27:32] your feet covered. Right? And then
[27:35] flying is action.
[27:38] Reverent, humble, in action.
[27:42] Amen. Look what brother says. If that
[27:44] ain't a dressed up servant, I don't know
[27:47] what is.
[27:49] Amen. And that's not a real Christian.
[27:52] Now church, why does that make me happy?
[27:53] Because you can be humble, reverent, and
[27:55] in action, and you are a dressed up
[27:58] servant of Jesus Christ.
[28:00] Amen. If we can just remain humble,
[28:03] hallelujah. If we can just remain uh uh
[28:05] holy and in service, then God will make
[28:08] us his real servants.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] Now, I felt on Monday night that I was a
[28:14] little I wasn't very kind. But Brendan
[28:17] assured me, he said, "Bro," he said, he
[28:19] said, "Brother Jesse, you're the
[28:20] humblest person." He said, "I know."
[28:22] That's what he said. Okay? And I'm not
[28:24] try I'm not bragging at all. I'm just
[28:25] saying like, "I want to make sure I
[28:26] don't come across as prideful. I want to
[28:29] come across as humble because I realize
[28:31] I'm nothing. I know I'm nothing." But I
[28:35] just, that was fresh this week. Someone
[28:36] shared, "You're the most humble person I
[28:38] know." Now, church, that will give me
[28:40] some uh motivation to stay humble, stay
[28:44] reverent, stay in action. Because if I
[28:46] start thinking I'm humble, then I'm
[28:47] going to be prideful.
[28:49] Does everybody get that? Oh, I'm I'm the
[28:51] humblest person on earth. Well, now
[28:52] you're prideful. I mean, it just can
[28:54] flip so fast, church, right? Don't want
[28:57] it to do that, but it just kind of came
[28:59] to my mind. But Ram said, if that ain't
[29:01] a dressed up servant, I don't know what
[29:02] is. Reverent, humble, and inaction. Oh
[29:05] my. He says,
[29:08] now look what brother Ram says. This is
[29:09] in the same sermon.
[29:13] He says these heavenly seraraphims was
[29:15] flying back and forth in the temple. The
[29:17] actual Hebrew word there is burners.
[29:20] These are burners angels or burning
[29:22] angels.
[29:24] These were the ones who offered incense
[29:27] and the sacrifice. Huh? So brother says
[29:30] this is the incense. So the altar of
[29:32] incense. This would be the altar right
[29:33] before the holiest of holies. So that's
[29:35] what brother says. I don't know if there
[29:37] might be some clues in here I missed or
[29:38] I forgot that might be right.
[29:43] He says uh they these burners he says
[29:46] I'm sorry I lost my spot. And these are
[29:48] the ones who offered incense and
[29:49] sacrifice. Now listen, he says it's just
[29:52] a higher order of angels.
[29:56] Now there's a quote where brother says
[29:58] they're not angels earlier in the 50s
[30:00] but later here after the seals he says
[30:03] they're a higher order of angels. The
[30:06] saraphims, remember they got six wings,
[30:08] church, right? Two over the face,
[30:12] they got two flapping, and they got two
[30:14] over their feet.
[30:16] A reverent, humble servant of the Lord
[30:18] in action.
[30:20] Hallelujah.
[30:22] He says it's a higher order of angels
[30:24] that makes the way for the sinner as
[30:27] long as there is a sacrifice.
[30:30] Hallelujah.
[30:31] Amen. So, does that sound like it fits
[30:34] the Bible? Yes. The Saraphim made a way
[30:36] for Isaiah to be used by God.
[30:41] Right? Isaiah's like, "I'm I'm woeful.
[30:43] I'm a dirty man. Everyone around me is
[30:45] unclean. I'm unclean." But the
[30:47] seraraphim made a way to be clean.
[30:50] Hallelujah. Amen. The saraphim made a
[30:53] way for him TO BE USED BY GOD. AND JESUS
[30:55] is the same yesterday, today, and
[30:57] forever. CHURCH, LET'S BE USED BY GOD.
[30:59] HALLELUJAH.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Oh man. Amen. Let's be USED BY GOD. THE
[31:05] fire of God can cleanse our lips, can
[31:07] cleanse our lives.
[31:10] Glory.
[31:12] He said they, these seraphims, they
[31:15] stayed right in the presence of God.
[31:17] They're the same as the cherubams. They
[31:19] were right in the presence of God. And
[31:21] remember, we saw that in Ezekiel 10.
[31:22] Remember we saw that on Sunday. The
[31:24] Bible said the cherubams are around
[31:25] there close to the coals of fire. We saw
[31:27] that I think Sunday. Ezekiel 10. In
[31:30] other words, the cherubam and seraraphim
[31:32] are right there, right by the throne of
[31:33] God. And the Bible says there's an angel
[31:36] host all around the throne of God. Let
[31:38] me see if I can find that real quick
[31:39] just so you got it. I don't know if I'll
[31:41] be able to. I got it. Yeah. First Kings
[31:44] 22:19. Thank God.
[31:46] This is the story of course of Micaiah.
[31:49] Remember, uh he was trying to warn Ahab,
[31:51] don't go up there. And uh he said he saw
[31:54] a lying spirit anoint the 450 prophets.
[31:57] And he said, "Hear thou therefore the
[31:59] word of the Lord. And I saw the Lord
[32:00] sitting on his throne AND ALL THE HOST
[32:02] of heaven standing by him on his right
[32:04] hand and on his left.
[32:07] Hallelujah. So we know there's cherubam
[32:10] there and there's saraphim there.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:15] And there uh they're they're surrounding
[32:18] all let's say all. OKAY WE ALL ALL THE
[32:20] HOST of heaven. So all the angels. We
[32:22] still got a couple more we'll get into
[32:24] maybe Sunday by God's grace. But again
[32:26] they there could be some overlap. I
[32:28] could be dividing them too much. Maybe
[32:29] there's fewer kinds of angels. I don't
[32:31] know. I'm just trying my best to
[32:32] understand the scripture and help us to
[32:34] see the presence of God through his
[32:36] angels.
[32:38] Okay.
[32:40] So, what are saraphim? They're angels
[32:42] that handle the fire of God's altar,
[32:46] even bringing it to believers like
[32:48] Isaiah for purging and for forgiveness,
[32:51] for the sending of sins away.
[32:54] Hallelujah.
[32:56] Iniquity is taken away by the fire of
[32:58] God brought by the angel. Hallelujah.
[33:02] Glory. Sins are cleansed. You are you
[33:05] are given oneness with God. You receive
[33:08] the atonement where you're one with God
[33:10] THROUGH THE FIRE BROUGHT BY A SARAPHIM.
[33:13] HALLELUJAH.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what Isaiah experienced.
[33:17] The seraraphim brings the fire to the
[33:19] believer or brings the presence of God
[33:22] or brings the Holy Ghost to the
[33:24] believer.
[33:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Ain't that beautiful,
[33:28] church? Isn't that beautiful? My
[33:34] Okay, I'm almost down here to the close.
[33:36] So, we see Saraphim take this position.
[33:40] Hallelujah. And it's a pretty important
[33:43] position. How many believe that's
[33:44] important by God's grace?
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] So, now let's um since I got time, I got
[33:53] about five minutes. That was all the
[33:55] notes I had really on there. But you
[33:57] know what? Since because of this, let's
[33:58] go to one more type of angel. I'll just
[34:00] have to change the title. Ceiling
[34:03] angels. Now, this may be the same thing.
[34:06] A saraphim may be the same as a ceiling
[34:08] angel. Now that I'm getting deeper into
[34:09] this here. Okay. Uh Ezekiel
[34:13] uh 9. Ezekiel 9 1-4.
[34:24] This seems to have a nice overlap here.
[34:27] Now, you know the scripture, church,
[34:29] this is what I used a few weeks ago.
[34:30] Remember I said you there's times you
[34:32] really need to cry when you pray. And I
[34:34] mean cry for the sins of your family and
[34:36] friends and even the city. Like cry, you
[34:39] got to cry against abortion, right? You
[34:41] got to cry against homosexuality,
[34:44] right? You got to cry against
[34:45] transgenderism,
[34:47] all the abominations, even lying, right?
[34:49] stealing, whatever it may be. Bible said
[34:51] a a prideful look is abomination to the
[34:54] Lord. Pride, any sin that bothers you,
[34:58] pray about it and cry because it's so
[35:00] awful. And church, then God could seal
[35:02] you during that prayer
[35:05] because again, is he the same yesterday,
[35:06] today, and forever, church?
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, we know it. Thank God, church.
[35:09] Thank God he's the same yesterday,
[35:11] today, and forever. Hallelujah. He never
[35:13] changes. Think about that, Chris. We You
[35:14] were praying for the Holy Ghost. Keep
[35:16] praying for it, brother. But you could
[35:18] receive the Holy Ghost while praying for
[35:20] the sins of your family and saying,
[35:22] "God, forgive them. God, wash them. God,
[35:26] draw them to you." Brother, you could
[35:27] receive the Holy Ghost doing that. So,
[35:30] because it's right here. Hallelujah.
[35:33] Ephesians, I'm sorry, Ezekiel 9:1. He
[35:35] cried also in mine ears with a loud
[35:37] voice, saying, "Cause them that have
[35:38] charged over the city to draw near,
[35:40] every man with his destroying weapon in
[35:41] his hand." So, here, this is also called
[35:43] destroying angels. So, actually, we are
[35:45] hitting two here in a row.
[35:47] And behold, six men came from the way of
[35:49] the higher gate, which lith toward the
[35:51] north, and every man a slaughtering
[35:53] weapon in his hand. And one man among
[35:54] them was clothed with a linen, with a
[35:58] writer's ink horn by his side. So he's
[36:00] clothed in linen, white linen, right?
[36:01] Clothes in white, and he's got a ink
[36:03] horn by his side. So he's got something
[36:06] to hold ink and a pen. And they went in
[36:09] and stood beside the brazen altar. So
[36:12] the brazen altar was where the animal
[36:13] was sacrificed. The blood was shed. It
[36:15] was the outer court. So they stand by
[36:18] the outer court. These angels, you got
[36:20] destroying angels and you got one angel
[36:21] in particular that's white and it's got
[36:23] a ink horn with a pen.
[36:28] Verse three. And the glory of the God of
[36:31] Israel was gone up from the cherub
[36:34] upon where he was to the threshold of
[36:36] the house. And he called to the man
[36:38] clothed with linen which had the
[36:40] writer's inorn by his side. Interesting.
[36:42] Gone up from the cherub. Oh, okay. Okay.
[36:44] That's speaking of the uh that's
[36:45] speaking of the holiest of holies, the
[36:47] ark of the covenant. So the glory of God
[36:48] had gone up, right? Yep. Yeah. Because
[36:51] this is even in this ch even in this
[36:53] book, God tells Ezekiel, don't pray for
[36:54] Israel anymore because they got so far
[36:57] they, you know, uh the exile was taking
[36:59] place, the captivity was taking place.
[37:01] So the glory of God had left, right? And
[37:04] we saw that with the Daniel video.
[37:05] Remember the Daniel movie? Yeah. Yeah.
[37:06] You were there, sisters there. That was
[37:08] a great Daniel because remember they're
[37:10] wondering like how is God in Babylon?
[37:11] Because he left Israel, right? Because
[37:13] of their their sins. So that's where
[37:15] they got it right here. At least one of
[37:16] them. Verse four. And the Lord said unto
[37:19] him, "Go through the midst of the city,
[37:20] through the midst of Jerusalem, and set
[37:22] a mark upon the foreheads of the men
[37:24] that sigh and that cry for all the
[37:26] abominations that be done in the midst
[37:27] thereof." And to the others he said in
[37:29] my hearing, "Go ye after him through the
[37:32] city and smite. Let not your eyes spare.
[37:35] Neither have ye pity. slay utterly old
[37:38] and young, both maids and little
[37:40] children and women, but come not near
[37:42] any man upon whom is the mark, and begin
[37:44] at my sanctuary. Then they begin at the
[37:46] ancient men which were before the house.
[37:48] My look at this story.
[37:51] Look at this church. This is an angel
[37:53] invasion into Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
[37:56] Praise God. This is an angel invasion.
[37:59] And where do they start, brother Chris?
[38:00] They start at God's house.
[38:03] They're going to slay anyone who's not a
[38:05] real believer, right?
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Judgment time had come.
[38:10] Hallelujah. But God's going to start at
[38:13] the house of God. And who's he going to
[38:15] mark with the Holy Ghost? All those who
[38:18] siding cried against all the
[38:20] abominations. Oh church, let's not get
[38:22] used to this world. Let's not make
[38:25] compromises with with this world. Let's
[38:27] hate the sin of this world. Hallelujah.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's who God's going to
[38:34] seal. God's going to seal the people
[38:36] that hate the abominations done in this
[38:39] world.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And he's STARTING IN THE CHURCH.
[38:42] HALLELUJAH. That's why our church needs
[38:44] to hate sin and love righteousness.
[38:46] Hallelujah.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE HE STARTS. HALLELUJAH.
[38:50] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[38:51] forever.
[38:53] Hallelujah. And he's going to mark all
[38:55] them on their foreheads. Those that
[38:58] cried. They sighed and cried. Oh God,
[39:00] what a wicked generation. What a wicked,
[39:02] awful age Leodysia is. God, I I hate
[39:06] seeing all the wickedness. God, save our
[39:08] family. Save our friends. Save what you
[39:10] can. Hallelujah.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to mark them with
[39:13] my Holy Spirit. Praise God.
[39:16] The Holy Spirit sealing angels will seal
[39:19] all those who sight and cried. The
[39:21] destroying angels will destroy everyone
[39:23] who didn't sigh and cry.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris
[39:37] Which change up chained up angels? Oh,
[39:40] Revelation 7.
[39:42] Oh, those are demons. Yeah, those are
[39:44] demons. Yeah. Yeah, because because we
[39:45] see what they do when they get out. They
[39:47] go and torment and destroy. Yep. Good
[39:50] question, Mark. But yeah, there are uh
[39:52] that's the next scripture. We're going
[39:53] to a different one in Revelation. So,
[39:55] you're thinking of Revelation. Good,
[39:56] buddy. Let's go now. So now let's go to
[39:59] Revelation 7. I'm going over now. I
[40:00] didn't mean to go over. I kind of lost
[40:01] lost track of time.
[40:05] Revelation 7 1 through three.
[40:10] So is this is this sealing angel? Is
[40:12] this a different kind of an angel that
[40:14] seals with the Holy Ghost? Or is it the
[40:16] saraphim who brings down the fire from
[40:19] God's altar? I don't know, church. But
[40:22] alls I know is let the fire burn me.
[40:25] Hallelujah.
[40:26] Let the fire of the Holy Ghost fall on
[40:28] me. We used to sing that song. Fire your
[40:31] fire, fire, fire fall on me
[40:35] with brother Brooks. Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:39] Revelation 7.
[40:45] And after these things, I saw four
[40:47] angels standing on the four corners of
[40:49] the earth, holding the four winds of the
[40:50] earth, that the wind should not blow on
[40:52] the earth, nor the sea, nor on any tree.
[40:54] And I saw another angel ascending from
[40:56] the east having what's he got? The seal
[40:59] of the living God. Hallelujah. Just like
[41:02] this rider's inhorn angel. Right. He's
[41:05] got the ability to seal. Amen. There it
[41:07] is. I mean Isaiah's past. This is
[41:10] future. There's got to be angels that
[41:12] seal with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. Now, they may be seraphims
[41:19] or maybe they're just separate sealing
[41:20] angels, but we know saraphims
[41:23] uh brought the holy fire to Isaiah,
[41:27] and they had the seal of the living God.
[41:29] And he cried with a loud voice of the
[41:30] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[41:32] the earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not
[41:34] the earth, neither the sea, nor the
[41:36] trees, till we have sealed the servants
[41:37] of God in their foreheads." And the
[41:39] church said,
[41:40] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at this. In other
[41:42] words, start at the house OF GOD, JUST
[41:44] LIKE IN EZEKIEL. AMEN. START AT GOD'S
[41:46] HOUSE, SEAL THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST,
[41:48] AND THEN ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE. All
[41:52] tribulation will break loose upon the
[41:53] earth. Hallelujah.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, God again shows, I WILL
[41:57] NOT DESTROY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE
[42:00] WICKED. HALLELUJAH.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE SAME GOD TOLD THAT TO ABRAHAM.
[42:04] WE SEE THE SAME thing here. God's going
[42:06] to give the righteous the Holy Ghost
[42:08] because they sigh and cry for the
[42:10] abominations. And you can get the Holy
[42:12] Ghost through that way. sighing and
[42:14] crying for the abominations on the
[42:17] earth. Praise God.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] So, are these sealing angels cherubam or
[42:23] seraraphim?
[42:26] We don't know.
[42:28] But just as long as the angel of God
[42:31] comes to us to seal us, we will be
[42:35] satisfied and rejoice.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; What we need, church, is an angelic
[42:40] visitation.
[42:42] Let's stand to our feet by God's grace.
[42:45] You can stop the live stream.
