========================================

and so there was a Gentleman on YouTube he asked me to make a video on it last week and I was like well I kind of felt led to go that way he said uh can can God save a backslider he said I want to know something about this topic so I thought well I'd like to know something about that too praise God so I trust to be a blessing here by God's grace Hosea 14 ver4 there's a beautiful verse here let's read this if we can on three ready one two three I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him amen how many have a need today Hallelujah let's bow our hearts let's pray one more time here by God's grace father God we thank you Lord God that we're living in the Overflow Lord and as we can see Lord do how it applies here Lord God you give us Grace Grace there shoutings unto The Headstone as you return saying Grace Grace unto it The Headstone so we shout thank you Lord for your grace thank you for Amazing Grace Lord as we saw a few weeks ago Lord in James where it says he giveth more grace Lord God am so we thank you Lord God that we see it in the scripture Lord God and Father I just felt inspired Lord God as I pray you take this Lord God and Lord it would help our church Lord God I feel like it's helped me already Lord God to understand Lord these scriptures and these quotes Lord God so take Lord this word take my humble little efforts Lord God I pray you bless it to your people in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I'm just going to check and see if there's any other prayer requests okay that was it hallelujah praise God so this thought like I said I've mentioned you know backsliding over the years you know I've of course I've always known about it it was in the Bible but I've never studied it uh as I studied it I went and saw that there was 16 verses in the Old Testament that Ed the word backsliding and so I'd never gone through it before as far as like all 16 in a row so I was encouraged to do that and uh I thought it would be applied I thought it would apply very well you know I feel like by God's grace we've got to the deeper things you know we're getting the deeper things of God even a few weeks ago we looked at uh the secret believer that's a deeper thought I've never had that thought before I felt like it was from the Lord you know in time and season of course I've heard brother Ram say that I think that's how it is with all of us right we hear things but there's a moment where it becomes quickened to us right and then we understand that from that point on so I feel like God is taking us deeper he promised to do that he said he'd guide us into all truth and we know that means all things that pertain to life and godliness so remember Martin Luther he was guided into all truth of what God wanted to show him in that day right so here we are today what day is it it's the finishing of the mystery of God hallah it's Rapture time amen hopefully in our generation if not we'll keep pressing on we'll get the Next Generation ready right get Malachi and Casa Lydia all these I always name the oldest ones but we're getting them ready Hallelujah for the Next Generation Hallelujah that's what we're called to do that's what brother bam said remember brother Bram said brother Jose he said if Orman Neville and I leave off the scene we've left footprints in the sands of time amen for the Next Generation those Footprints never said just press Play Hallelujah Hallelujah so I just thought throw a little joke in there you know um but yeah this was a great thought I've never uh looked at it before I thought it would tie in really good you know with the the grace series the message of Grace so uh so I would preach that now I got a lot more quotes than I put on the video just I think it was a I maybe a 20 minute video I don't know a short video I put out yesterday I got that study done so I hope you got your Bibles ready we'll probably be turning lots of scriptures here and it just gives us a way I'll say like this it gives us a way to define things that we all go through especially the quote where brother Ram says in 1954 he said I backslide every day what does that mean you know if you look at the Bible what exactly does that mean and I think as I go through this I think we'll understand it quite plainly It lines up with everything that we've ever believed by God's grace so because because what I'm saying is it doesn't mean well you could go out and murder somebody well that's that's my backsliding today well I'm back today you know that's not what it means right it means it goes back to that topic remember of major sins and minor sins remember that made a video about that earlier this year as well and that's true because the Bible Jesus said the Pharisees get a greater damnation right because they knew more of the word they were the leaders of that day right right and so there's degrees right there's degrees so it ties in very good by God's grace so Hallelujah now I want to uh if I could let's just start with the uh the Hebrew word for backslide means to turn away or apostate so it means to turn away all right so if we're walking towards God uh to backslide means to turn away I'm not going to follow God anymore more I'm going to do what I want to do praise God so that's what that's what it means and church before I get too far don't forget Jonah was a backslider Hallelujah Abraham was a backslider and yet he's in the Hall of Fame of Faith now what do I mean I mean backslid in in minor sins right did they have major sins yes they had major sins especially Moses murdering a man right and got should have killed him because he didn't circumcise his son I mean they had major sins but God forgave him those but in the moments when they backslid they were minor sins I guess except for David so I'm going to stud that I just thought of David real quick here my favorite Bible character is David you know that was a major major sin that was definitely a backsliding so but of course that's under the Old Testament right that's not under the blood of Jesus Christ so that's how I look at that one here as I'm just thinking about that I never thought about David here coming in here so uh we see Hebrew means to turn away or apostate so I would like to uh just go down through some scriptures here so let's start in uh Proverbs Proverbs 14:14 and we'll see all the verses on backsliding there's a quote I'm not going to put it I'm not going to read it but brother bam said if I ever get to the spot where I do not preach the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost he said tell me I'm backslid amen so if brother Ram said if I ever get to the spot where I say these signs don't follow them that believe brother Bram said you come tell me I'm backslid Hallelujah so I like I like I like to look how did Brother Ram apply this to himself right so we'll get to that here by God's grace but Proverbs 14:14 said the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways all right and a good man shall be satisfied from himself so we got two I love what Proverbs does Proverbs always contrasts good and evil right the wise and the foolish remember we preached on that oh it's been years ago I think maybe the first year William ever came and saw us you know preached a whole series on the Book of Proverbs and uh but the backslider is filled with his own ways so it's it's the opposite of being filled with God's ways right so when when a person will backslide I'll say like this it's most of you know it's it's many people we know that we're in the church and now they don't go to church anymore that's what I'm talking about but but don't forget the Pharisees they could be in the church and fully backsliding right you understand you know they were so far backsliding the Bible called it perpetual backsliding and we'll get to that as well by God's grace so it's important to know these things it's important to know our our terminology it's extremely important to know terminology praise God why would God give us words that they're not important and then God would say if you take one away if you add one he said you'll lose all these things or you'll be added plagues right so every word of God is crucial praise God God gives us understanding so a a backslider is one who will always do his ways now we see it you know around us we see it we'd say backsliders we going to church but then they leave and they go out and sexual sin or something like that that's a really common example right we've seen it you know people will take a relationship it's ungodly relationship but they'll take that relationship they'll leave the ways of God and that faulty that sinful relationship will cause them to backslide on God they don't they're not filled with God's ways anymore right they're filled with their own ways that's a very obvious one to see it's like the example we'll get to in 1 Corinthians 5 the man sleeping with his uh mother-in-law right was that right no stepmother sorry yeah got that mixed up there but you see that you see that uh he's filled with his own ways and yet that man still came to church what did Paul say you were puffed up in your sin you weren't mourning over your sin see sin should always make us mourn Hallelujah and if not then that's some our hearts got to be changed praise God we got to be washed in the blood amen right I'm talking about me I'm talking about all of us amen amen our attitudes towards sin Hallelujah so that's the first verse there I think that's the first time the Bible quotes backsliding all right now let's go to a few here let's go to uh Jeremiah 2:19 yeah I'm going to put this in a little different order than my video did anybody watch the video yesterday anybody watch it Jose did all right okay well good only one person watch it well I feel better amen I don't want to give you the double if you already watch it but like I said I add more quotes by God's grace Jeremiah 21:19 says thine own wickedness shall correct thee because remember God said God shall not be mocked a man uh reaps what he SWS right so God lets all these people know here's where you went wrong right there right and thy back siding shall reprove thee so there God God puts a what he's he calls it a conscience in every mind right brother M calls it a stoplight and God you know when we backslide we see the stoplight saying stop stop don't go this way stop don't go this way and yet if the person goes through it there's a witness God gave them a witness to stop but they went right through it so our backslidings you know that's why God gives us human Spirit right to correct to meditate on things so we can be corrected then he says know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou has forsaken the Lord thy God and that my fear is not in thee sayith the Lord of hosts I thought this was a great scripture because it brings in how does a person get backslide they lose the fear of the Lord right so then they think you know a backslider thinks well uh even if I do this I know it's against the word of God even if I do this there's going to be no rep repercussions toward everything's going to keep going good and the Bible said that's impossible right Bible says that's impossible Hallelujah the fear of the Lord he he says the fear of the Lord is not in thee sayeth the Lord of hosts okay so this is a person doing evil things like we said sexual sins all kinds of things forsaking the Lord thy God see uh the Pharisees forsook God right G God's right there Jesus is right there amen and they forsake Him right they uh they won't worship him they only come to criticize him they only come to try to trap him and all these things you know so we can see it plainly here backsliding is losing the fear of the Lord hallelujah I preach a couple sermons on that a few years ago really memorable s you know and what's amazing church I'm just going to share this here what's amazing I got that sermon I was inspired from that sermon by uh just an internet preacher who's not in the message and that preacher this week just got kicked out of his Pastor position because of sexual immorality and he was texting me and I thought he wanted to get on my YouTube channel to build his platform but I never let him I never invited him on there and then he was making all these false prophecies and everything like that I don't know if you saw in the news um well it would have to be religious news you know but it was it was just you know just amazing you know uh how someone can be under the spirit of God uh so under the spirit of God and then like this man sell it out for uh a little mo few moments a month of sexual immorality but yet what he preached was right the fear of the Lord and then he lost the fear of the Lord that shows his soul is not born again we need Born Again Souls hallelujah amen we need an anchor like brother B said I need an anchor so uh when the Temptation comes that anchor will hold me that anchor will keep me from the sin amen that's why we got in Jesus amen amen Jesus is our anchor hallelujah amen that's what we got we got to Anchor hallelujah amen in the storms of life Christ is my anchor that's right amen that's all it could be amen it's Jesus right and I like this scripture brother I'm brother Willi I just heard a brother say it uh the Bible said when we were without strength Christ died the righteous for the righteous so that proves right there I like the brother emphasized it he said without strength we have no strength to be healed we have no strength to be saved we have no strength to do anything if anything good comes out of our life it was God giving us strength hallelujah amen praise God the strength of the Lord and the joy of the Lord is your strength amen that's why we lose strength because we lose the joy of the Lord Look What the Lord Has Done amen Look What the Lord Has Done Hallelujah but in this case again uh Old Testament Jeremiah's time that's kind of what that uh Daniel Daniel's connected in there you know uh Daniel was prophesying course to the people in Babylon uh Jeremiah was right there in Jerusalem until they he was taken out Ezekiel he was over there in I think in Assyria uh ministering to the the there so there's three different prophets on the earth at one time right we talked about that a little a few weeks ago by God's grace so we see there backsliders get full of their own ways they don't do the ways of the Lord uh they lose the fear of the Lord hallelujah now let's look at I'm just going right through if I can go right in order Jeremiah 3:6 H pull that up okay yeah I see where we're Jeremiah 36 the Lord also said unto me in the days of Josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel has done she's gone up upon every high mountain and under every Green Tree and there hath played the Harlot so remember in those days you know Israel in order to do uh idolatry they just wouldn't do it out in the open till the days of Solomon right remember Solomon Solomon built the the idols right there right next to the house of God that's how open and unashamedly he was backsliding but they would uh they would they would hide their sin they would go up in the forest and like people still do today you know they hide away in their uh their clubs you know their their evil spaces you know and they have all these Wicked seances and Witchcraft and so forth like that but it's the same idea they got to hide away they won't do it they're out in the public but we're here to Worship in public amen hallelujah Glory this church floods One More Time Well Services right out there in public again amen I tell you they need to get a new plumber I think is what happens that's just my opinion but notice it's every Green Tree you know so they were people were just sin everywhere you know they they were uh worshiping Idols everywhere and I said after she had done all these things in verse 7 turn thou unto me and she returned not and her treacherous Judah her sister Judah saw and I saw when all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not but went and played the hearta also so here we get we have two backsliders right we have uh Israel and Judah right so and notice God says when a when a when a a people won't repent he divorces them right now he did that to Israel and I'll say like this he did that to the denominations because this is the leoan church age and he said I'm spewing you out of my mouth in other words you're not the bride you refuse the word of the Bride but I going to get me a bride Hallelujah I'm going to send down my book to Earth I'm going to have my seventh angel preaching I'm going to have people eat the book hallelujah amen and then they're going to prophesy again to every Kindred Nation people in tongue and then before the Rapture the spirit and the bride will say come hallelujah amen so the voice is in the bride amen that's right can see it there so see major backsliding that's what I'm going to be emphasizing today there's major and minor major backsliding caused God to divorce Israel and divorce of course the denominational churches today Hallelujah now verse 12 Jeremiah 3:12 go and Proclaim these words toward the North and say return now look God is still gracious God is still saying return like this wasn't you know one time they went up to a tree and they bowed down and worshiped uh we'll say the the god of Asher or asure that was the uh the Assyrian God of War so Israel would they they would stop trusting in Jehovah and they go up and they go up in in a tree uh they bow down to the tree and and put their Idol out there and say I worship you usua our wor protect us from our enemies and it just wasn't one time it was under every tree and God still says come back to me praise God God still says return to me amen that's a god of love amen hallelujah amenah I'm going to correct this now because I keep quoting the wrong scripture amen I uh Isaiah 571 pulled up there and if a Son of God or daughter of God gets out of course and won't repent God in his Mercy will take them off the scene Hallelujah in order to show them Mercy to keep them from the evil that's to come hallelujah amen right there it is I keep I kept saying Ezekiel I'm not going to say Ezekiel anymore I'm going to write down and memorize it it's Isaiah 571 the righteous perisheth and no man layth it to heart and merciful men are taken away see see there's people see church let me just say like God might we preached on gifts on Wednesday night you know God's given us all gifts one of your gifts might be to show Mercy now it's you know it's it's one of the gifts you know whether a Word of Faith or knowledge or wisdom or healing Faith you know people so there's God takes people that are known for being merciful god will take them off the scene before it's their time think about all these people in the message I even showed some of them to you that died at a young age of 40 from cancer the different things they're known to be merciful people they're known to be good people but but the Bible says nobody considers that that God takes them away from some other evil that might come in their life CU God knows whether the devil wants to do right so we must to remember that as well I didn't want to that just came to me that's not my notes but I just want to I want to remember Isaiah 571 because you know why because people have rough times yes the next person uh you know next person we know of all our friends like just happened there with the the lake the next person we know we want to remember this God knows what he's doing praise God Amen nothing gets by God God knows about everything Hallelujah so even in our dark moments you know I think about you know we were at the funeral for my mother my wife's grandfather and or grandmother I have this peace I have this peace you know she lived a long life but I'm just talking about it's a reminder about the Frailty of life and that when something happened I'm sure William and beatric have seen people over the years passed away unexpectedly we have this confidence God knew all about it praise God God gives God takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen this is the confidence that we have Hallelujah his ways are higher than our ways amen his thoughts are far above our thoughts Hallelujah he can be trusted amen hallelujah he's worthy of Praise he can never fail Hallelujah he's never failed once hallelujah praise God he's gracious he's merciful he's abounding in Grace Hallelujah he says return amen amen after every Green Tree think about that in Israel every tree think about the Mount of Olives you know you remember the picture there got the Mount of Olives and they got the Temple Mount every tree there had an idol under and God still says take away if you come back to me I'll receive you hallelujah amen that's amazing love amen no wonder we can sing amazing love no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace I said I didn't finish verse 12 Hallelujah thou back siding Israel sayith the Lord and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you after every tree every tree had an idol that's like Legion you had what over 6,000 demons a legion is 6,000 something I got on the Greek I could show the screen you know for the PM service if the kids want to see it it's over 6,000 demons that that's the same thing and yet God can deliver that Jesus can deliver that man with one word go hallelujah hallelujah and then what will he do what will man to deliver like that he'll sit the feet of Jesus and say teach me Jesus amen hallelujah and Jesus said you go testify to your family don't follow me you go testify to your family they need to see the power of a a maniac who's changed to a man who has a sound mind Hallelujah glory amen for I merciful sayith the Lord how many believe he's merciful amen I am look there's the I am I am merciful amen I am I am God I am Jehovah I'm Yahweh I am Jesus I am merciful amen hallelujah glory to God and I will not keep anger forever amen I love this now here here we see uh the way back only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou has transgressed against the Lord thy God and scattered thy ways to The Strangers even to the heathens there were supposed to be a city on a hill there were supposed to be a light to the to the lost and they're actually causing the heathens to to to participate in their idolatry right and you have not obeyed my voice sayeth the Lord so God says return all you got to do is repent acknowledge your idolatry and then say I have not obeyed your voice Lord I haven't obeyed your word and then verse 14 turn oh backsliding children sayith the Lord for I married unto you oh my goodness Hallelujah and I will take you one of a city two of a family and I'll bring you to Zion right Zion Hallelujah so we see it now look he's saying return turn just humble yourself repent now this proves what Jesus said the angels of he there's rejoicing in the presence of the Angels when one sinner repents amen because all every Green Tree every Idol every sin can be washed away in a moment's time Hallelujah this is the mercy of God hallelujah just acknowledge it Hallelujah he said obey my voice God will forgive amen glory now I got uh two things I want to make sure I get okay all right so we got that now 3:14 now go to 3:20 sorry I just gotta got my I just want to start with the my notes they're down here I want to start with those and I didn't get a chance to put him up above my other ones verse 20 surely as a wife this same chapter same chapter surely as a wife treacherously departed from her husband let's stop right there Israel was like a wife to God and so the symbolism is this wife went to every single tree every single man other than her husband that's the symbolism this is how awfully Wicked This is this is how dirty filthy this is yet God still says return unto me that's Grace God you know he tries to give us an understanding of his love amen it's hard for us it's hard for our minds you know an infinite God it's hard to understand how an infinite God could express his love but this is one way he shows us it's like a wife that went to every other house other than her own house she loved every other man other than her own husband and yet God said still come back to me just acknowledge that you went to all those just acknowledge that return and I'll receive you I won't be mad B with you that's amazing grace amen how is that possible amen it's the love of God and no you know he calls it out here departing from her husband uh so have ye dealt treacherously with me oh House of Israel sayeth the Lord a voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplication of the children of Israel for they have perverted their way they have forgotten the Lord their God return oh ye backsliding children and I will heal God can heal uh in numerous numbers of idolatrous uh uh sins God can heal it he didn't say I might or I'll think about it he said I will amen hallelujah he's got the power to do it he's got the love to do it he's got the spirit to do it hallelujah amen I will heal hallelujah amen like brother B said don't ever think people are too far gone until they cross on and even then you don't know what they said in their last moments they could have prayed in their heart they could have done something some a some some real repentance but look God said I will still heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our God truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills see they go up to the hills praying to assure and all these other gods that's just the one I know from the scripture and from the multitude of mountains truly in the Lord our God is the Salvation of Israel he's saying just trust to me you've said a thousand prayers to other gods just repent of that come to me I'll hear you verse 24 for shame ha devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters so see they saw the effects of their backsliding they saw on their family right so we should look at our families we should look at our lives is there any evil effects upon my life help my life to be pure Hallelujah verse 25 we lie down in our shame and our confusion for we have sinned against the Lord Our God we and our fathers from our youth even un this day and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God now I was listening to a sermon uh it was a man reading a sermon of Charles Spurgeon now Charles Spurgeon is one of our favorites at our house he's a a preacher from the 1800s the man age they call him the prince of preachers that's quite a statement brother now we don't want to exalt preachers but when they're dead I don't mind saying if they're dead you know because then they ain't going to get puffed up you know you tell them now they're the prince of preachers probably not a good idea yeah I know we want to give flowers I appreciate flowers you know I appreciate you understand I think everybody understands but I was listening to him and he told this story he said the only way this is the only way I can understand the love of God and he's talking about Israel here talking about backsliding he said he read an article in a newspaper and the newspaper said uh the certain certain men it was actually obituary but then uh there's obituary but then uh he said he there was an article like an opinion written about this obituary of this old man who died let's let's just say he died at 60 okay I'll just use that okay just use that because it just be easier to understand and Charles Spurgeon said this man got married at 20 to this wife he left the wife to go to the big city whatever city in England it was to make a fortune and he said he only sent his wife one letter and said honey uh you know I'm gonna work here until I get enough money then 40 years pass he never sent her another letter this is a story a true story Charles Spurgeon told he said for 40 years the man worked he got rich he got really rich but uh he started spending all his money uh into the sins of the world you know carousing and drugs and all kinds of things like that well you know cigarettes whatever they had in those days he said he got to the point just like the prodigal where he had no money left he had nothing left and the the last except for a little bit of money he was that last money at 60 years old to go back to his wife and the article said his wife was there waiting at the door to welcome him home he said then the article says he only lived a couple weeks or days after that and she just nursed him and told told you I love you I missed you and Charles Spurgeon said that is the closest description of God's love he said that I've ever seen because that's what we do we can leave God we can forsake God and when we come back to God we know we fail we know we we made mistakes but yet God is still there with open arms he's freely going to love us even when we don't deserve it Hallelujah he's going to welcome Us in isn't that what God Said here in the word of God I'll still take you back back so she was pure all those 40 years well maybe someday he'll come back maybe something happened I'm just going to believe and of course he confessed his sins on his death bed and she watched him die die a saved man apparently and Charles Spurgeon said this is the love of God this is The God Who heals backsliders and then sometimes God will express it through Saints like that precious Saints notice it wasn't a man it was a woman nothing against am men brothers trying to encourage our sisters you know like we got some good encouragement last Sunday from brother Ben Hallelujah this is a glimpse into the love of God how God freely forgives our backslidings now let's none of us would ever do that right 40 years leave the message you know but let's be let let's be aware that someone could come back that's what I'm talking about am be ready to receive them if they're gone five years 10 years wherever they're gone praise God hallelujah be ready with the love of God If Only They acknowledge their iniquity God will receive them right God will receive anyone who acknowledges their iniquity and says forgive me Lord I haven't obeyed your voice forgive me Lord just receive me and God will wash all that idolatry away Hallelujah in a moment's time Hallelujah just like the gibon nightes amen just like the different ones we looked at a few weeks ago Hosea 141 now here's uh this this this this is my text and it also gives you know a little more on just the the the steps of repentance and forgiveness Hallelujah Hosea 14:1 oh Israel return unto the Lord thy God for thou Hast Fallen by thine iniquity just like that man he knew what he was doing he should have he should have wrote to his wife and brought his wife right to the city Israel knew their iniquity they knew what they're doing was wrong but verse two here's the god of Grace but take take with you words and turn to the Lord hallelujah and say unto him take away all iniquity and receive us graciously see grace is undeserved it's unmar you didn't do anything for it God just gives it Hallelujah so we will render the calves or the sacrifices of our lips so see that's the only sacrifice we need as if we backslide or if we make a mistake or we sin against God or man or whoever our employer whoever we sin against all we need is the calves of our lips a sacrifice to say forgive me I'm sorry right Hallelujah God calls that the sacrifice of our lips the the repentance the words where Israel should have said I'm sorry forgive me I gave myself I lost all the fear of the Lord I I I burnt uh uh offerings on every uh tree and and high mountain and under ever green tree uh I I played the Harlot with every God forgive me bring those words and God will forgive you Hallelujah that's right verse three as sure shall not save us see they had to learn hose is telling them that that God that little God there or how big the God is that won't save you we will not ride upon horses neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands ye are our gods for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy so God is so great he's not limited to a statue God's so great if a if a Earthly uh son or daughter doesn't have a dad God will come and show them that he's their father that's right Hallelujah so here what are we seeing here return so you got to come back if we sin or backside we got to come back to Heavenly places that's where we left amen that's our location that's where we live we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah turn and say so we got to return and then return and say uh we must say our sin and then uh pull up uhh Romans 10 Romans 10 yeah let me I wrote the wrong verse down here I wrote 1 Corinthians 10 Romans 10 Romans 10 if you confess with your mouth I think it's Romans 10:10 or Romans 10:4 we so I'm showing this we need this in the Old Testament they need in the Old Testament we need it in the new it's verse n sorry 109 sorry I mean that that's good too but for the point I'm making for that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God ha raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved so see we see it return to God and then say to him confess your sin say take all away all my iniquity not some of it not half of it all of my iniquity Hallelujah and receive me where's receive and I'll receive you Hallelujah where's that word oh yeah verse two take away all iniquity and receive us now remember to be received God said you got to come out and be separate 2 Corinthians 6:17 hun I'm putting you on the I'm putting you at your Paces today Hallelujah I'm going to make you work hard today bear with me says come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord and I'll receive you sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I'll receive you leave that up there so like we that's why I preach out there to the Iowa Brothers you know I said you can't touch the porn you can't touch it if you want God to hear your prayer you can't touch it Hallelujah you got to be fully convinced that this is death and you got to be fully convinced that God's word is life amen amen hallelujah and not touch it see it's beautiful so see it's the same in Hosea and and Romans and and then second cor it's the same thing right don't touch the sin and then God receive you verse 17 want pull is that already okay yeah I already did that how about 16 or was 18 it's 18 yeah 18 yeah yes and I'll be a father unto you we sing about our father right oh thank God our Father for giving us Christ's son and then God is a father unto us and you should be Sons and Daughters sayeth the Lord God Almighty now le that up there this is the one I I don't have to get to it now I'll just preach it now but the prodigal son in Luke in the Book of Luke right he had to leave his backsliding condition I was telling my wife this is a story more about us I I feel like this story more relates to how Christians can backslide now most people use it just getting saved right and now it can be used for that but to me it makes more sense he's probably a grown man right the The Prodigal and he knows the blessing of God he's seen the he's seen the blessing of his father and he backslides and leaves it on purpose he turns away that's that's what the word backside means to turn away he turned from his father and left to the the the pleasures of life everybody see that but how did he get back how was his father a father to him he had to turn back amen he had to turn back and he had to give the sacrifice the calves of his lips and say father I've sinned against you I've sinned against Heaven receive me and what did he do once he left that place once he separated himself he could be received by the father amen ah it's Amazing Grace how sweet that sound that saved a wret like me amen I once was lost but now I found I was blind but now I see Hallelujah is that right amen look how look how it ties together I mean this is the gospel amen this is good news it was good news for Israel good news for us hallelujah hallelujah so return turn and say take away all my iniquity receive me and no longer look to assure the goddess of war so that's like today people want the government to save them the government's not out to save you the government's out to kill us well I'm talking about prophecy and even with their food in the natural they're doing a lot to try to kill people get them hooked on uh you know prescriptions and things like that the government won't save us Israel should have known that but neither will money or your jobs or anything like those Brothers the porn won't won't make them happy it won't get it won't help them in any way it's only going to destroy them hallelujah it's an idol and God is telling us leave all that behind leave that separate yourself say you're sorry bring a repentant heart acknowledge your sin and then God said I will receive you Hallelujah then I'll be a father unto you right a it's beautiful amen how many can see the gospel in the book in the Old Testament oh it's glorious amen it's glorious Hallelujah it's joy unspeakable full of Glory Hallelujah let me read you a few quotes here um maybe I'll preach this on Wednesday I don't know or may yeah maybe Wednesday tonight I was going to teach the little ones about the Antichrist because I I never watched it before but last week I watched the uh closing ceremony to the Olympics did anybody watch that oh my goodness did you see it was like the Antichrist yeah unbelievable yeah yeah that yeah that was the opening yes very good NE very good that was the opening and the closing they did this so I'm I'm going to show the children tonight and then we'll go over some Antichrist scriptures I mean they're just coming right out with it obviously right we've known that but it just gets more and more plain and I want the children to know the scriptures about the Antichrist um so I'll probably look at that tonight I been want I wanted to do that you know last Sunday night but wasn't preaching but I like to teach the children on that of course I've been doing videos on the mark of the beast anybody seen the videos on the mark of the beast I put all the mark of the beast and image of the Beast i' got like five or six videos goes in there maybe five brother man says uh Jonah back brother man said Jonah was a backsliding minister oh my goodness a backsliding minister he calls him he says and he you know because he ran from the presence of the Lord right the the presence of the Lord was saying go to n Go to he ran he backs that's the perfect definition of it I'm going the opposite way but God's got a way to get you in the perfect will of God amen amen if you're a child of God Amen God's going to get you out of the permissive will he's going to bring you back in the perfect will of God hallelujah that's amazing grace he'll use a whale if he has to but let's prefer not to do that Hallelujah he said and in the belly of the whale he said he remembered the promise even a backslider if he makes a prayer towards the temple God will hear his prayer and brother B said of course the Bible says God heard Jonah's prayer and brother bam said if God would do that for a man who looked at an Earthly temple built by an Earthly man Church what are you looking at you're not looking at this church you're not looking at Jeffersonville you're looking at a Heavenly Temple that was built by Heavenly Powers Eternal Powers you're looking at a Heavenly high priest who doesn't die doesn't need a sacrifice for his sins he was a sacrifice for your and my sins amen glory and if brother said if God heard that man's prayer if God would honor that man because he believed in the prayer of Solomon whom how much more will he honor your prayer tonight Hallelujah and brother said brother said it was a backsliding man praying a prayer of a backsliding man Solomon backs on God what does it show we all backslide we all make mistakes we all fall short of God's glory so God offers Grace to us if we'll only look to him look and live amen ah brings us a reminder the brass serpent look and live look to Jesus Christ now and live hallelujah amen glory he said don't you don't have to look to your symptom or anything around you look to heaven where J Jesus sets in the presence of God with his own blood as an intercession for your sins as he enters sin think about that some people will say Jesus can you forgive me Jesus can you actually forgive me how could God forgive me of my own sin God how can you restore my faith my virtue my knowledge all the how can you do it well it all depends on what blood you have amen hallelujah right how could God do it God can do it because he has the perfect blood the perfect sacrifice Hebrews I believe 9 or Hebrews 10 says by one sacrifice he had he has perfected forever them who are Sanctified ah what Sanctified to separate see as long as you leave your sin and separated from it God can now perfect you God can now forgive you he can bring you back into Fellowship it's Separation by the blood it's healing by the blood it's faith in the blood it's life in the blood amen Glory Hallelujah if God will honor the prayer of a baon and man to a baxon and man's prayer how much more will he hear your prayer brother that's what brother says because we have a we we don't have an Earthly one we have a Heavenly Temple a Heavenly high priest Hallelujah brother raham said Jonah got down on his knees and said Lord I'm sorry backslide I'll take the right road if you just let me out of here now look he's making a vow isn't he he's on his knees saying Lord you forgive me Lord God if you just save me out of the belly of this whale I'll walk the right road I will correct my backsliding and then God heard that and then he actually delivered him right to Nineveh God was gracious now he don't have to travel to Nineveh God already provided the travel God will provide your travel too Hallelujah God will take take you places uh faster than you think you can get there God will do things you don't expect him to do praise God in other words God will make it easier on you because God is the god of Mercy hallelujah amen if you want to do right God will help you do right Hallelujah if you have a heart of Integrity God will keep you from sinning hallelujah amen and he'll forgive you if you do because he's the god of Mercy a man running from the presence of the Lord oh my goodness Hallelujah now I just want to do some general quotes brother R said in brass serpent 53 and here is the word of God tonight Hallelujah written here before us and we thank thee for he's praying to the to father and now may it just find its place of Anchorage tonight in every heart so the unsaved first of all would get saved the backsliders would come back to Jesus Christ the loving heavenly father and be reconciled by the sacrifice of of his cross who died in their stead here's what happens chur when people backslide they forget they were forgiven pull up second Peter 1 this always just tied in really beautifully here today second Peter 1 I believe it's verse 10 again this one just came to me I didn't have this in my notes it just came to me here second Peter 1 yes verse n but he that lackthe things Faith virtue knowledge uh Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness he that lacks these things as blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins so Peter no doubt we've seen people like this right Peter had seen people that would get anointing they build up but then they lose the anointing and then he dealt with them he he he he uh uh he talked with them and they felt like they forgot they were forgiven the devil will hang that the failures over us we can't let the devil hang our failures over our heads I'm going to preach this now now go to Second Peter 2 uh second Peter 2 yes second I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 2 this just struck me second Corinthians 2 it's on the video I didn't uh spend a lot of time on it so this is what Peter would have had to do he would have had to talk with these brothers or sisters and and say brother sister what happened well I I did this I back said I and and how can Jesus forgive me I'm lost I'm a hopeless case and Peter said no you just forgot you were forgiven what what the Bible say a backslider he fills his his his life with his own ways right he he forgot the ways of God so much he even forgot that he was forgiven but like Jose shared that quote with me yes remember Jose he said brother man said backsliders are still saved unless they're the Perpetual talking about the elected elected person can backslide and still be be saved all right so I got second Corinthians 2 now Paul cried many tears because of some of the sins in this now this might have been the brother sleeping with his stepmother it might have been but we we don't know we don't even have he doesn't give any details of this brother or this uh sin here he just said he shed many tears in verse four okay uh verse six sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many so this this person hurt many people verse 7 so that contrarywise you ought rather to forgive him so even though this person the Corinthian Church hurt many people Paul said you ought to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps should a one be swalled up with over much sorrow okay wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him right and I've seen this there's a brother you know we uh Malachi were out there in Iowa there's a brother that brother that come back remember I don't know I don't remember his name but this is what happened to him and this other brother we were talking about they fell out of church and they got under such condemnation they wouldn't come back to church well here's what happened I'll go back to verse seven here's what happened they they they they hurt many people in the church and they let the devil uh o give them over much sorrow right now thank God the brother came back I think it was 15 15 years later he come back boy he's on fire now he's like he's on fire like he started a group text with 20 people what can I pray for you what can I pray for what can I pray for you he's like can we have more prayer meetings can we have all these prayer meetings and all these things like that can we have Bible study so brother Brook started a Bible study for him so it it was good it really good but see this is one of the dangers here now remember this might have been the brother who was in sexual sin and he let the he we have to feel bad for our sin but we also can't be overs sorrowed by our sin we have to know that there is a redeemer there is an all sufficient sacrifice that wipes it away amen and separates as far as the east as from the West amen throws it in the sea of forgetfulness there's no more record it's gone it's forgiven I forgive you I received you praise God see so the devil didn't want this man to to get that kind of Victory so the devil put over much sorrow on him so this is worldly sorrow right letting the worldly sorrow overtake him right but then Paul says make sure you confirm your love tell this person you love them hallelujah look at verse 10 to whom ye forgive anything I forgive him also for if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Jesus Christ in other words Paul is saying I want to forgive this brother or sister whoever it is I want to forgive them like Christ would forgive them Hallelujah that's a real forgiveness right there Hallelujah that's a real H H do do you think Jesus holds grudges against you after you repent no he loves you the Bible said I'll Love You freely and that was under the blood of bulls and goats Hosea said if you repent I'll heal you I'll Love You freely not I'll love you because of your good works I'll Love You freely amen hallelujah that's the kind of God that we serve a god of love a god of Grace amen hallelujah right now here now I always wonder this verse such a but now I get it lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we we are not ignorant of his devices now leave that up there we've always used this to say you know I've heard preacher use this the devices of uh you know worldly music right people use this oh Satan's using this rock and roll that's true that's true but what is the context of this that's what struck me I was like I didn't and yeah I recognize Satan has all kinds of devices you know the phone and and music and all these things that that's true and we got to we got to stand guard don't let your guard down Hallelujah don't let it down but the point of this is Satan's device is to get someone so overs sorrowed so focused on themselves oh my they're so it just struck me now they're focus on their sin and their mistake so much they are not focusing on the blood of Jesus Christ amen cuz we could all say look at my sins I've done awful things we could all say that praise God but at some point we have to turn from our sins stop looking at our sins and realize they're actually in the sea of forgetfulness and look at the blood of Jesus Christ amen because I forgave it in the person of Christ amen amen amen so yes you feel sorry yes you have Godly sorrow yes you're sorrowful that means I'm going to get revenge on Satan next time I'm obeying the word of God I said next time I'm ready for him right so you brothers that b battle mind battles with immorally dressed women you go out there you go ready out there in public I'm ready to look away I'm not going to fall to the devil right people that lie they got to say I'm ready I'm going to tell the truth every time right you're ready to tell the truth like you're looking for Satan to try you're looking for some type of trap and then when the Trap comes ah I see you now devil I'm doing what's right I've got Godly repentance amen I've got a Zeal to obey this time I will not fall I will not live in iniquity I will stand on God's word hallelujah now you're on fire now you got your first love church Hallelujah got your first love back that's right brother Ram says this uh 1955 don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night let's build a little further up the road tonight never build it in the same place you'll stand still you're either backsliding or going forward okay so just a good reminder there right uh brother man says we could backslide every service if we don't draw closer to God right so see we must continue to hunger and seek after God I want to say this on Wednesday night I was very inspired to preach on gifts and my wife even shared this with me uh I was very I was very inspired once people say they have the Holy Ghost that's the moment they got to keep seeking God because if not they might backslide on God like we're talking about they might backslide on God if they don't keep that same devotion and love for God they're going to wonder did I even get the Holy Ghost I'm GNA forget I'm saved right like just like Peter said I'm gonna forget I have charity I'm gonna forget I had that and so that's why we really got to understand the quotes of brother brandom when he says don't seek gifts he's saying don't seek us specific gift don't say God make me a big known person don't say that but seek God the Bible said desire the greater gifts covet the best gifts Hallelujah so God's presence can be felt amongst the people of God we must constantly continue to seek God Hallelujah to grow in Grace and knowledge of our Lord and savior how am I doing on time okay well maybe I can do an hour and a half this morning we'll try it by God's grace amen I love this qu brother said 1955 Jehovah Gyra look what he says here father he said many are Wayward so he's in Phoenix Arizona he says there's many backsliders in this church what a statement he said and they don't mean to be that way right how many how many kids Amen to that when we struggle when we all fall short of God's glory we really don't want to be like that that's he said maybe there's some here tonight might maybe drunkards think about that maybe people that's done stepped over the line and went into immoral acts and done everything that's wrong like that but God you still love them drunkards immoral women God he's praying God you still love them did God still love David did God still love Noah after his drunkenness did God still love them no yes of course he did did God kick them out the Hall of Fame of Faith no he left their names in there amen why because they they they had enough Grace they had enough love for God to recognize God doesn't want me to stay in this back State God's provided me Grace to come out of the backslid and state to press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus but God you still love them now will you save them tonight Lord will you bring that poor wandering backslider no matter if he's sitting out lied and condemned feels maybe he's crossed the separating line no he hasn't your spirit still calling as long as it calls you're wanting your wandering children to come home home won't you grant it tonight father that the Holy Spirit bring conviction in the audience and bring many wandering children to thee for we ask it in his name he's sitting in a church brother William with a backsliders drunkards immorals and he said God still loves you God still loved David God still loved Moses how about one of our favorite guys God so loved Abraham brother said look at Abraham sitting down there in guer sorry I'm getting dry thr backslid telling a lie now he was naturally backslid and spiritually right because naturally he left the promised land right he's physically backsliding right but spiritually because he lied and said she's not my wife and give his wife over to another man to save his own skin what a man he says sitting out there and backslid God told him and said don't you leave up there there stay up there he's talking about in Israel right in the Holy Land the famine had run him out he wondered down to where it was easier going sometimes Church the easier way is not always the right way I know that's a whole another sermon but the easier way is not always the right way what what I mean is the right way is always obedience right it's always obedience like I've had different people over the years uh councel uh they they left now or they're gone and they they would say brother Jess you know uh like a sister would say do I go back to work and I was like well who's going to watch your children they don't have anybody watch your children I said that's probably not the will of God God put you here gave you those children for your children that that's God's Will and they have a choice do I take the easier way make more money or I take God's way simple or one of those brothers would say uh you know God's call giving me a job over here but there's no church to go to well that's a pretty easy choice if you ask me about it I'll tell you my my ideas about it Hallelujah there's no church are you going to start a church what do you what are you plan on doing so you know th those type of things you don't go to where it's easier more money don't always make life easier sometimes it makes it harder the more you get the more you got to take care of brother says you know what happens to a fellow when he takes the easy Road Jonah right Abraham now here's what brother Jose had shared with us uh 1957 Hebrews now well you no I'm sorry now you say well can't we back backside absolutely and when you backside you're going to get it don't you worry Abraham got it and the rest of them got it and you'll get it right you'll get a little spanking right don't you think it gives you a right to sin it doesn't you'll pay for everything that you do didn't David look remember we looked at that didn't David pay for everything he did he paid for everything you'll reap what you sow you do one little sin and you'll reap a whole Wash Tub full brother says I have not seen a wash tub recently but somebody finds one let me know how big is a wash tub that's right but brother that don't mean to say that you're lost that's exactly right you're saved Abraham reaped EX exactly what he s that's right but he was still saved Hallelujah right that's God's love one more quote and I'm going to go to the New Testament I'm still to the New Testament all these Old Testament scriptures like like I said there're 16 I didn't I didn't even preach all of them because some of them you know I felt had less uh scriptures so or less uh uh points and I want to get the ones that had the points about speaking it and calves of our lips and how to how to come back to God uh 19 61 oh the message of Grace I preached this one a few weeks ago but said and Abraham said it's my sister Abraham lied about it but yet the grace of God held him because he repented he was willing to repent now the Bible doesn't tell us he repented but brother said he tells us tells us he did repent well of course he did right because God would not protected Sarah he would have lied perhaps you know but he would have repented at some point the father of what the father of Faith the father of assurance that's what the word means in the Greek the father of I'm assured God is is true I'm assured there's a God in heaven the father of that lied about his wife because he's in he's in a constant battle right flesh the spirit flesh Spirit these are emnity they hatred one against another and anybody that's willing to repent the grace of God still goes for you the grace of God is searching for you Hallelujah so that goes for you backsliders this morning the grace of God is looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient how he took good old Abraham brought him back and remember Abraham was not saved by his Works he was saved by grace Abraham was saved by faith which is Grace and God saved Abraham because of his grace not because of his behavior but but he saved him because of his grace oh how good we are saved by grace all right now I'm I'm G to try to uh uh bring this down here now now I've been through all these Old Testament scriptures now in the New Testament the words for backslide is fall away okay uh pull up second Peter 3:17 and now you and I backslide in one of two ways it's either you backslide in a major sin or a minor I guess the same was true in the Old Testament right except the only difference is now in the New Testament we have more power we have holy ghost power in the soul amen we have a holy ghost baptism in our soul to keep us from the madej your sins amen amen that has to be the case because of what Jesus said you know the Pharisees got a greater damnation there's levels of damnation right there's levels of rewards there's levels ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things Brethren beware lest ye also being led away with the air of the wicked fall there's fall that means turn away it's the same definition as backslide beware unless you backslide from your own steadfastness now this word steadfastness means a firm mind a firm condition of your mind so this is speaking of the mind it's a steadfastness of your mind your thoughts so see the Bible said Peter says be careful you can be led away from a mind that's steadfast on the word it's firm on the word of God and the church said Hallelujah now that's for minor now this is for minor right for us I'm talking about for us now I made a I preached it when uh William was here in 2022 the 13 metaphors for backsliding I don't I don't remember that I had 13 metaphors for the Jud person right what here here's what the Bible says they're Shipwrecked they war against God they fall away so there's the major backsliding oh I never read the Perpetual backsliding did I okay so hold on look up Perpetual if you if you can I don't know if you can but I can find it you have a Bible search back there oh Glory we're doing good uh pull up a perpetual backslide sliding okay sorry I don't know how I missed that verse how I miss the fourth one you get offended or stumbled or Judas was offended at the word right this is all speaking about make Believers fifth you get cut off or cast forth sixth is you're a Castaway Paul said I don't want to be a cast away so I got to keep my body under subjection my mind as well seventh they return back to Sodom it's very similar to falling away or back study number eight itching ears number nine a hard heart number 10 they crucify Jesus AR fresh we looked at that a few weeks ago on a Wednesday night 11 they trample underfoot the Son of God aresh publicly 12 they get entangled they get entangled or caught in like a web or a trap and 13 they get uprooted or plucked up uh they're supposed to be planted by the rivers of Living Water amen thank God we're planting the word of God amen amen but Judas got plucked up because he wanted to for money all right now there it is why did I not get to Jeremiah 8 okay why then is this people of Jerusalem slid him back by a Perpetual backsliding they hold fast to seat they refuse to return so see this is what I'm talking about so a Perpetual backsliding is when someone refuses that's like a Judas scariot that's like a balum right that's like all these that we're not right we are not any of those by God's grace that's a person that will sell out the message that when if that's a certain amount of money they'll leave they they'll blashe brother Braham they'll blaspheme the word of God they'll blaspheme us you know that's not us but see that's the point so when Israel would perpetually backslide and not come back God said I divorce you I'm putting you away and that's this Judas as scariot group so see there's very serious so what I'm saying is there's major sins of major backsliding and there's minor like brother man says sometimes we do it every day now I am open because there's also Coes I am open brother says sometimes you can go days without sinning sometimes I felt like I've done that but I'm not saying I'm I'm not saying I'm right I'm just saying I felt like I didn't sin all day you know because you just love God and everything's feels like it's going good you know glory and victory and I'm protected I feel like there's a heads around me you know yeah yeah I'm sure hope hopefully you've had some of those but you know the the point brother R is making as we'll get to it is Paul said I had to die every day so at some point throughout a day you got to crucify the desires of your flesh and the desires of your mind right because you have those you have three desires you have desire of the soul my soul thirst for God desires of the Mind Ephesians says and you have desires of the flesh so three day every day brother wh I got to feed three people or three parts three things I got three people calling on three not three people I have three uh channels calling on me all day when are you going to feed me soul saying when are you going to feed me brother Jus when you going to feed me when are you going to feed me the word of God when are you going to feed me something good to think about my mind wants to you know figure something out or meditate then my bu's like when are you going to give me some perfect bars maybe cheddar Puffs no should it's a per so this is a Perpetual thing Israel now this is the Judas of Scar now I'm trying to close here uh give me 12 minutes there I feel like when it hits 12 then I feel like I can stop right there go so I I just went I went through some of these examples The Prodigal turn turned away from the pig pen and his father received him he was restored he was healed because remember God said I will heal amen and I'll tell you if God ever does a healing you're going to be healed amen if God ever forgives you you're going to be forgiven Hallelujah God cannot change his mind about his word hallelujah he can't he can't change his mind about his word he can't go back and say you know that was wrong probably should have done a little different on that one well I'm going to forgive them 75 but not 100 no God forgives all all prodigal was forgiven all he wasn't just relegated to just you're a servant no you're a son now your war is going to be less than that other faithful guy oh yeah that's when I use that I use that uh when remember uh was it brother Johnny or Sister Sarah said you know the enemy always battled on them because they never went out into the world remember that you guys remember that okay Sarah and it kind of struck me that's right it is a greater testimony to stay faithful to God your whole life because that's what Jesus did right and so see to me now that now a something's moving in here by God's grace GL I feel happy amen glory hallelujah amen I don't know why I'm feel like this but I can see it now that Parable now how you know both of them were children of God in the benefits of the father one left and backs it out the other one stayed true to the father now look he's going to battle a bitter Spirit right he he battled a he battled some bitterness but he still had the reward people always make that older son look so bad don't they that's what I'm saying like to me it doesn't look so bad anymore he's just having a mind battle I just I I I don't understand why all this is being made when he falls short but he just had to understand that this is God's grace amen this is the Father's Grace amen and you still have a greater reward because you stayed faithful all those years amen hallelujah but don't forget I'm giving grace to the backslider as well because I'm the father who loves all my children amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen glory the greater reward goes to the more faithful one don't you think we all battle mind battles how many preachers are come in here and preach on our complexes right church over the years I remember I preached on complexes at cams one time well that was probably 2013 or something like that we had the whole altar done filled up Hallelujah just like you know just Trials of life right the enemy tries to put that over sorrow and all these things and yet God is a God say return I'll forgive all I don't care if you iniquity on every Hill I don't care if all day you went through all day you said all did all this all this all this if you return a knowledge I will forgive you amen because I'm The God Who heals backsliders amen wow that's really something that that scripture that Elder son I always thought that's strange okay now I got it my guys feel like I got it Hallelujah now he went through the uh the man in 1 Corinthians 5 the fornicating with his stepmother that was a backsliding but that guy stayed in church defy and imagine that he's puffed up at the at the pastor in Corinth you know or the preachers or whatever it was you know he's like I can sleep with my stepmother I'm not going to repent of that I'm not going to mourn can you m that's the book of Acts church so that's why I was telling you I'm encouraged after hearing those sermons you know from the Brethren brother Ben preached on the Corinthian Church that's why I've always Tred to tell you where a mature church now don't let it go to your head because then you're going to fall you're going to backslide Amen in other words recognize you recognize where we are right recognize where we are in the journey I'm in the promised land I'm not out in the wilderness I have possessed the land amen the land given to me by the Holy Ghost I'm possessing it praise God I've driven out the Giants amen hallelujah I've driven out these things I've driven them out I'm possessing the land yes I fight battles but I'm in the land Hallelujah I'm doing what God called me to do praise God but then don't let it go to your head don't don't let the pride thing come around that's to me that's the hardest one I think for message people I've said that before is pride yes it's true now the third one I mentioned on the video was Peter Peter denied Christ what a backsliding you know and all and 10 10 others I'm sorry nine others because John actually came back to the Cross right John came back to the Cross see John and Judas there's only 10 left right so 10 of them backslid physically and spiritually on Christ right they turned away from the cross they weren't even there at the cross they're savior they're their Rabbi their Master for three and a half years wouldn't even watch him die talk about Amazing Grace chur and he was saying and he was saying from the cross father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's amazing grace Hallelujah and then remember even after the resurrection what do you do he went back back to fishing he backslid back into fishing right he turned from the preaching turned from that I'll just go I go fishing he said I go fishing I go back to my previous life oh God help us not to go back to our previous life God God keep us keep us in in the truth keep us in the truth of God you imagine you know uh if I went back to my just imagine you know God keep us from ever entering into places we used to enter in and doing things we used to do keep us pure Hallelujah I'm almost done I'm almost done uh I'm have a few more Scrolls on here brother Ram said you can make anything an idol so let's you know down to the New Testament remember brother said you can make anything an idol he said anything can be God he said you can make uh you can make God an idol even when brother man say you try to boss God around and make him your Aaron boy in other words that's when people get upset oh God you didn't heal that person or God you didn't do this for me God you didn't give me that you have made God an idol like you in other words uh God you have to do what I tell you to do no no no no no no that's that's wrong I've got to do what you tell me to do praise God see they act they make God act like he's not God God becomes their Genie right if you all know Aladdin hopefully you don't but I was raised in the world well mostly in the world um he said you can make a piano of God so Malachi don't make this piano of God over here right Lydia don't make this organ of God over here where's Lydia she uh CA don't make that uh Co oh Victoria I'm sorry yeah sorry well they look so much alike you know now forgive me brother Jess brother Jesse don't make this Pulpit a God and the church said anything anything that you feel like well that gives me or I've got to have that that's gonna solve all my problems Jesus says money is the most popular God right because you can't serve God in manmon either love God and hate money or you hate money and love God let's love God today brother BR saids I trust that God has forgiven me as far as literally stealing anything as I know I never did it in my life but I so misused his time that I stole that way and done many things I shouldn't do but I'm grateful to God this morning that he's forgiven my sins said you can steal time from God and so that's what that's what you know we just we just need reminders of that we don't want to we don't want to lose time and steal God uh scrolling on our phone on Mindless stuff now if you if use it like I try to I use it for scriptures you know use it for message sermons you know use it for that's why I try to use it for the most part you know that that's use your time on the things of God hallelujah invest and meditate in the things of God hallelujah but look brother man was so humble he said I stole time from God remember he said before he was saved he said in 1926 remember he started the church in 1933 so seven years before he started that church he said he had made his model te Ford an idol he said I had my first little Model T Ford I was a sinner I would just shine that little thing all day Sunday to make it shine stay home didn't go to church and shined it what if today I tried to find one piece of that car it's gone you couldn't do it it's finished just simple things like this can become Idols right and that's what I'm talking about Major backsliding versus minor backsliding um last quote is this the last quote from brother oh I got two this is the 1954 now brother R's answering a question this is questions and ansers 54 and the brother's I think it's a brother he's asking can I be re-baptized and brother Ram says because he said he backslid he said on backsliding I wish somebody would ask me that so he was waiting for that question I like that brother I was waiting for this question somebody asked me this question in other words I I want the church to know exactly where I stand on this so he's probably asked it many times but he said I wish somebody would ask me that but on backsliding remember you backslide every day there's no way at all for you to keep out of it but remember there's quotes on the other side brother says you don't have to sin so if you have quotes on the both sides I just say I don't know let's go back to the word of God the word of God says you have to Die daily so at some point you might I'll would say like this you might not have sinned yet but when you feel the Temptation you kill that Temptation you die to that and then you have Victory the rest of the day now this is a minor thing but I'm just laying in there because we have quotes on both sides right and I know last time brother cam was here he preached that with the restoration remember that because you said you really like that sermon that's right I remember that and uh he said uh he said uh yeah about uh what was it oh yeah he said you can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with you like Moses right yeah Moses the devil got rid of Moses because he didn't know what to do with him he just obeys the word all the time amen so that there's a quote on that but you also have this quote which said you can't help it you're going to backslide every day at some point so I take it like this if it's possible I'm going to try to live a day without sinning but y'all say like this most days I'm going to backslide in my mind and I'm going to start thinking about things I shouldn't think about and I'm going to start uh meditating on things I shouldn't meditate about and so I've got to say God I backslid in my thoughts I've done a minor sin because I know the thinking of it is just the same as doing it because it will lead to it right it's not it's not exactly the same as doing that but I know if I don't stop it it could lead to that that's right and I've got to root out my heart I got to root that sin out of my heart I want you to wash out my heart and I'm returning in my thoughts to God Amen I didn't backslide physically I didn't backslide and actually commit the sin the actual literal sin because remember sin has four stages lust uh enticed lust conceived sin death so first you get enticed but you haven't sinned yet then lust conceives that's that's what I'm talking about that's the backsliding right there you start conceiving it think about in your mind you received something start planning it out but if you stop it there praise God stop it right there amen everybody see the visual there is that right there it's a four-step process stop it right there amen say Lord I back in my thoughts I'm coming back to God give me a transform mind Hallelujah I return to you in my thoughts I'm returning in my mind receive me I know you will and be a father unto me hallelujah amen oh this is deep and Rich here today praise God Amen and I was wondering do I preach this what do I preach here it was just so so uh unusual but on back siding remember you backside every day there's no way at all for you to keep out of it well one place you said there's no way other place he said there is a way he says all right but you backslide to the people in the church but not before God that's a good point right God's already forgiven all your sins just like job remember God bragging on job he's a perfect man he's a perfect man God comes down I don't even know who you who this who is this man I even know him of course he didn't that but he knew him but he's humbling him he's humbling him right so brother ad even differentiates that you're forgiven in heaven but the TR the sin on Earth you still got to deal with you've sinned on Earth but already in heaven you're already forgiven everybody see that brother and so brother tries to say this that's what he tries to say he said you backside on Christ but you don't on God now I don't know about that quotee I don't understand that so Christ would be the high priest so brother man I don't know if he's trying to say like you know you have to confess your sin to the high priest which you do right if we confess our faults what do he's faithful and just to forgive us of all sins right so that's interesting you have to go uh to Christ and say Christ forgive me but God in God's eyes you're already a forgiven son or God or son or daughter of God with a theophany body praise God so that that's what I feel like brother Ram's saying but he doesn't give any Scripture other than Paul he said you backside on Christ but you don't on God cuz if when you sin you'd be gone so that's why he says God has already forgiven you but you have to repent to the high priest that's what it looks like to me and we have scripture for that he said but you're constantly falling everybody say constantly ready constantly you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time so here I this is what I feel I feel like brother Ram he got this question at a time time when he was going through tough battles right because how many know how many have ever been on the mountain top you feel like boy I'm just really overcoming I'm really in a say I'm really in a season of Victory but other times you're like I keep fighting battles every day I got to confess all day every day other times when you're got in the victory Hallelujah I'm just praising God I'm just serving God loving God other times be like am I even saved what's wrong with me or do I even have the Holy Ghost what's wrong with me and the church said so you get quotes from Brother brand so that's why I believe that's how it is with brother brandom there was time times he was so close to God right there's times he had to go through trials just like you and I do brother said don't you think you don't get he said don't think that I don't get spells I get spells just like you he said the devil come and say you don't have any friends and then he said I'll stick this in the devil's Faith look look at those look at those licensed place out there they're from Alabama uh they're from Georgia they're from Kentucky they're from Ohio see devil I've got friends so tell the devil where he's wrong I know I preached that before just a good reminder he says repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time if Paul had to do that now look how look how he honors Paul if Paul had to do that repent every day then I'm going to have to do it too aren't you so he says Paul Paul me you we are all humans we all need Grace that's right we all backslide in our minds almost every day because I'm not trying to make a Doctrine I'm just trying to say that if we backside and turn away in our minds God has Mercy for us and don't get over sorrowed like the Bible says there remember that God is a gracious Redeemer oh I'm already past 12 let's stand our feet and I'll just read this last quote as we're standing here musicians can come there by God's grace this is from the Third Exodus I love this uh brother talking about the Third Exodus remember the first Exodus was is is out of Egypt the second was The Exodus of the spiritual Exodus from the Old Testament to the New Testament in Acts chapter 2 so Israel out of Egypt Acts 2 was the second Exodus he says the third is the New Testament Church raptured to Glory so the Third Exodus is what we're looking for right oh yeah first Exodus natural to Natural Glory second one is uh spirit I'm sorry Old Testament to New Testament spiritual Exodus from old Covenant to New Covenant Third Exodus spiritual to Eternal there it is amen glory amen the Lord hallelujah that's right it's been a while since I need to preach the Third Exodus again that's what I need to do praise God once I get I still got to get through this uh recognizing your day seran SE perfect Faith breach the message of Grace Lord I think this I got a couple more to go coming of the lord The Rapture mystery spoken words Original Seed there's one more in there so I'm almost done I never thought this would turn out like this uh Third Exodus and remember brother said this election which I think he's speaking of this uh Exodus but this Exodus is coming now is not just going to another Nation it's going into Glory where their names are wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life not under the natural little animal lamb that Israel brought out because they could backslide from there and go back brother saying in the Old Testament Israel would constantly backslide he says but this Exodus can't backslide glory amen this Exodus into heaven cannot backslide why because death is swallowed up in life Hallelujah there it is amen there's no backsliding in this Exodus amen because our bodies are changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah death is swallowed up in life woo amen what a sermon amen thank you Lord amen I wasn't planning on this amen I didn't know how it turn out the video sure didn't turn out like this yesterday he said but this camp backslide this is under the blood of the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world and their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and they're in there they're elected and when the light flashes over them like that them denominational walls drop away and here they come come out from among them the holy spirit in these last he says and touch not their unclean things I'll be God to you and you'll be my sons and daughters hallelujah amen let's thank God for the sermon today hallelujah thank you Lord amen [Music] hallelujah glory
