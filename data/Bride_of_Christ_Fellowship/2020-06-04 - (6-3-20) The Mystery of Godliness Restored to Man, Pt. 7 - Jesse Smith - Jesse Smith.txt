the Simon said everything went really well he was a little disappointed with the song leading but he said another than that I went really good you know Simon he'd laugh at that you know though it's his own joke there I appreciate both Simon and I just tell him what a great help he's been we had a wonderful time there with brother cam and the Saints and looking forward to this weekend we have brother Brooks preaching on a Friday night at 6:00 and then cam will preach at 11:00 and 5:00 on Saturday and then brother Brooks would preach at 11:00 on Sunday so four services will jam it in the weekend have a lot of time with the Saints looking forward to it 14 years having this church so we started on the first weekend of June in 2004 and talked 2006 rather so this is the first weekend in June so nice nice we can fit it on the same weekend praise God so very thankful and looking forward to having brother Brooks with us and the Brooks flies in tomorrow night so just keep him in prayer just Oryza amen and I were talking about getting rid of this thing you know we might need a new one so it just makes all that noise so sorry about that would it be better if I just use that one does that bother you hon can you hear that yeah I can hear it cuz it's right here but okay is it can you hear pretty clear okay did you show you score to this okay I think I'll just go to that well The Sweeney and I do when I freaking I broke it a long time ago praise God let's take a few prayer requests here tonight and then we'll get to the Word of God I'm gonna try to preach I'm gonna set a timer for 35 minutes and that will be my closing point I'll try to start closing at 35 minutes and the reason is because if I don't my wife says I get lost in heavenly places and then that which is true I you know I can't I just don't know how to do it but anyways the trouble that is like especially during the school year you know staying here or too late throws off the rest of our week for our family I'm a little more tired and cranky kids or cranky you know your body really does well by getting to sleep at the same time every night I know we can't be perfect but I do want to try to be more cautious of that and there is a quote you know I mean I never want to limit the Holy Spirit but there's a quote brother Graham says trying to get your sermon to 35 or 45 minutes so you do have one quote if you want it but Lord willing we'll try to get the message is short and sweet tonight by God's grace so let's take a few prayer requests whether a man got to witness to his stepsister so let's remember her that show open her heart to the Lord I was a great request also there was two young men baptized on Sunday one of them was already planned to but then after the sermon another one came up to be baptized Cody and Michael so let's remember them they're new believers and by the Kam's been doing a great job with them so let's pray for them also let's pray for this country with racism you know it's never laugh right you know it's so sad it was so public this last couple weeks it caught on video and it's just awful any Christian loves all skin colors because God loves all of them if you're a real Christian you love all of them and so sad but let's just pray that justice will be done that these officers will get justice for the evils that they've done also let's pray that the evils of the rioting and looting will stop as well two wrongs never make a right and that's awful that people would riot and loot and destroy it just shows it's the spirit of Satan behind both of those murder and also destruction and stealing and I think Akron had two people that got caught with two thousand dollars of stolen merchandise they just broke into stores and they arrested and it's just so sad to see that and also you know all the all the small businesses that had their property destroyed that was really sad so let's just remember all these things in prayer and brother Brooks said remember him in prayer you know his family with him being a black man his family is concerned with him traveling which is understandable of course so let's just remember his family he's not really concerned but you know his family and his wife and everybody are concerned just because of all the racial tensions in major cities but he's flying into Akron Canton so I haven't heard of any riots in Akron I've seen peaceful protests and then there was the one like I said a couple people got arrested for looting but not too big of riots or looting so a lot to pray for are there any other needs here tonight that anyone would like to be remembered in prayer Haven okay let's remember that let's remember who is that sister how your dad do it do it okay okay if you like it stronger about the same okay amen right he's gotta share that testimony with the Saints on Sunday they really enjoying it so thank you for the update we appreciate that and there was a sister that wanted prayer Netanya she has some back issues so she liked prayer for that so let's just pray for that okay I think that's it okay okay it's pray for our friends that be saved that's right you know I go on their Facebook page from time to time and check and see how they're doing they're really struggling so let's just remember them in prayer you know a tree is known by its fruit so you just have to pray for mercy you don't have to pray their hearts will open up God wants all to be saved and he can save like I told my cousin he can save to the utmost when I did see my cousin by the way the one that we were praying for he's fully delivered from the drugs we were just weeping and crying and praising the Lord it is a tremendous testimony he thanked acacia for all of her encouraging letters he said many of those were convicting to him and helped give his family hope but he is a new man and he was there Bible study on saronite he was there Sunday morning at church it was phenomenal and he was and then I was meeting with his brother too than when we prayed for and he was encouraging his brother to get baptized I was encouraging to get baptized too I said it'll change your life Matt yeah so it was just a powerful example of the power of Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever and that just brings joy to my heart God heard all of our prayers we didn't even see God doing it but God did it it ought to raise our faith for more praying or believing to see our loved ones safe also got a chance to witness to my dad he just I just brought up Jesus and we were talking and he was really listening to me and I was I told him about the forty years you know I told my preached out a long time ago but in 2023 will be forty years since he had that experience with the Lord but he's been running away from the Lord he thought that was really interesting and he said just this last week he said he was praying for the first time in a long time and he was crying while he was praying so let's pray that God was softened his heart just some really good just some good time and he actually smiled in the pictures that was even better I'm gonna upload that one on Facebook but he actually smiled in the picture it was it was really great so a lot of encouraging things from this weekend let's go before Lord and a word of Prayer here many many needs but our God knows them all he said ask an abundance that your Joy's might be full it's such joy seeing Adam demo lights a sanctified of such a joy oh thank you lord and just so joy is from the baptisms let's just have a word of Prayer here Heavenly Father I love you Lord God we love you we just sang about it we see your eyes now Lord we see love in your eyes hallelujah not fire that's that's the tribulation but more now we see love in your holy eyes Lord God we thank you Lord for the vision of your word and Lord the ability to see your truth in this hour we give you praise honor and worship we thank you for shedding

Brooks for traveling Mercy and Lord you'd protect him Lord me there'd be no violence done to him and comfort the hearts of his family especially his wife Lord the Lord lasted we just pray for this nation Lord it's a it's just a sad thing to see Lord God we just pray that people could get victory over the spirit of racism that evil spirit of discrimination we just pray in Jesus Christ's name people will repent Lord God and love their neighbor as themselves Lord God read it Jesus protect the business owners protect the cops that are trying to protect the people and the properties and or we just prepare you bring the riders and the looters to justice Lord in Jesus name also the cops that did the evil nor do they have justice but also that they repent of their wickedness Lord God Oh God we know this nation as a whole is is doomed the Lord your you said your long-suffering Lord would last and would continue that more Souls might be saved so please save souls out of this awful situation Lord God and be magnified and glorified operate we know you work all things together for good so I pray the good would come out of this and father bless our preaching tonight as we read your word we're so happy to be in your house so father we give you all the praise and honor Jesus Christ sure said hey let's stand our fee we'll take our text Amen sent me his memory verse so for that let's go to second Peter 1 for our scripture reading elective look at mystery godliness restored the man tonight would like to look at knowledge [Music] and then we'll read our memory verse here so 2nd Peter 1 we read one verse here 2nd Peter 1:5 we can all read this one together as well we might as well thank you Miss Rita on three one two and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge where is virtue you say there's your name virtue alright first thessalonians 5:14 romans 5 14 to 23 nice portion of scripture beautiful beautiful portion first steps on it's 5:14 alright let's read 14 down to 23 let's begin on three one two three now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ may God add his blessing Serena's worth maybe seated praise God ok I'm a set timer now this will work God's grace alright so Lord willing we'll keep going on godliness restored to man it's a great mystery Paul calls it a great mystery and the longer I serve the Lord the more I realized what a great mystery it is and the main issue I think is with as Peter said diligence a lot of message believers get lazy on the Lord but he said if you want these added you must be very diligent praise God and so that means year after year after year be diligent and be hungry and thirsty for righteousness and and see how closer to God you can be praise God not how easy your life can be but but how much more of God that he can add to your life praise God and so we see this as an important part of Christianity is growing in the grace of Lord I think Sunday morning and the point I ministered on Soul thirst and there was a great response of people that realize that the the each part of your being has a thirst so while you're there keepo up Ephesians two three I just realized as I was driving over there on Saturday that your mind has a thirst as well and it's scriptural so brother Ram in the sermon thirst says you have a body thirst for like water and food he says you have a soul thirst for holiness or fellowship with God but then also your mind has a desire as well and so here the Bible says of among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh so there's your thirst for the flesh right and of the mind so I didn't realize that's something that's a fresh revelation that not only does your flesh and soul have a thirst but your mind has a thirst and then brother Branham gives examples in that sermon he said an architect has a thirst he said to want to design something new he said I'll sit down and he waits for the inspiration because he's desiring to to make a new structure that's never been made before I'm also said evil churches have a desire they have in their mind a certain pastor they want that will let them get away with sin well the man gives the example of a pastor that will let teenagers go on mission trips overseas and and learn evil dances he calls it the Watusi and he said come back and dance the Watusi and then the pastor lets these girls that come back from their mission trips dance sinful dances he said because that's what they desire they're mine once that kind of pastor a compromiser and he said that's the kind of pastor they'll vote in and so you have in your in your mind you have conscience memory reason affection imagination see like memory sometimes you desire to remember the memories right that's what people are doing now with you know that a gentleman who passed away mr. Floyd people go back and they desire to remember in their minds good memories about it whenever a loved one that you know passes away what do you do you you desire to go back and remember oh I remember when they we had such a great time together and those can be good things but they can also be evil things right when Satan brings back bad memories we have to learn to cast those down in Jesus name praise God the Bible said cast out anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God if not church it will become a stronghold in your mind it'll become a complex in your mind a fortress in your mind and that's giving Satan a place most people today are demon-possessed in their minds maybe not their bodies but their minds because they give place to the devil praise God why should they praise God about that but it's true it's praise God then that's true we know we are not that way we are daily transformed by the renewing of our mind to daily washing it's a daily renewing in the Word of God and when you start slipping on that you'll notice a difference like my cousin Adam was telling me he said for 10 months he was listening to a sermon of brother Branham every day he said then he took oh he took a couple days off and he just did music and he said all those temptations that he was battling a drug addiction started getting closer and closer he felt that demon power getting closer and closer so he instantly prayed and went back to the tapes and started listening the Word of God and he said all the power came back hey man see we got we have to renew our minds daily with the Word of God yes there's days you need to maybe listen to a little more worship music right to refresh your spirit but you can never let go on the word of God when you feel the enemy coming in like a flood the Spirit of God raises up a standard against it praise God it's through the renewing of the mind Amen that must be done if not then we beget weak in our minds and then we will start entertaining lies from the devil and so a lot of people can get faith a lot of people can get virtue in fact I just had some saints telling me recently I'm not going to give much details on this one but a recent family has fallen away from the message and the woman went to where and you know those where they call the yoga pants and the brother you know they just did evil things and they were really faithful but the brother was telling me that that the this family was so on fire for God so on fire and yet after a few years they could fall so far away they were so on fire but then they're so cold just a few years later why is that because each of these attributes are an anointing but they're temporary right faith virtue knowledge and they had all this knowledge and that under understanding and those people even visited our church not long ago we see they get this temporary noin ting but when they when they accept the lies of the devil that anointing of the statue brother man leaves them we looked at that last week you can have the anointing you can have character but then it can you can lose it by selling it out that's exactly right we saw remember the Bible said you can be sanctified but then trodden under foot the Son of God remember a pig can be washed it can be clean but then it can go back to the mud we don't want to go back to the mud praise God of course we're not a pig either that's the pig is God's foreknowledge right we're evil sprays God we see by God's foreknowledge he knew Judas was a pig but he got cleaned up for a while but then came back but we're Eagles and we might they might find us in the muck and mire of the chicken yard but God washes us off and then we fly in the skies and the heavenlies like a real eagle praise God so that part is for now is that the eagle the seed part is God's foreknowledge we don't always know like that brother was telling me they thought for sure that family was filled with the Holy Ghost they thought for sure that woman was fill with the only ghost and that that husband and they thought for sure but by their fruits you shall know them a good tree cannot produce corrupt fruit right and so it's so poor to know this when you have faith you choose the way when you have virtue you have you have power to live it publicly and then the next one is knowledge now knowledge is your third step it's a third portion of Holy Ghost anointing that's right and God adds this to your human spirit it's knowledge now in the Greek knowledge means understanding a deep understanding that belongs to advanced Christians about what's lawful and unlawful okay so God first gives you faith to choose the way then he gives you bonus on the way your virtue and then he helps you understand the way praise God he gives you a deep understanding of of knowledge on the way to to know where you're going praise God that's right amen and why why why did the white as his life please God and why does God want me to do this these are all questions that are answered by the knowledge of the Lord amen and this is all backed by brother Ram sermons that's River man because this is these are the points he makes so in order to accept knowledge from God you have to reject human reasoning and that's what my man tells us in this sermon if in order to accept knowledge you've got to turn down reasoning okay so reasoning is human understanding the way the human mind would understand God is wrong we don't need we already got a human understanding that's wrong we have to lose that and we have to get the mind of Christ amen we need the understanding of Jesus Christ praise God to understand the way why we walk this way why God requires these things when God gives us that then we've got knowledge amen it's a great power it's a great anointing amen as you'll see see a lot of people a lot of people misunderstand the sermon wisdom versus faith how many remember that title brother Branham used wisdom versus faith and brother my majors on human wisdom is wrong and we just need faith we can't take wisdom the same idea here you can't take human reasoning you've got to take faith in God's knowledge praise God so you have to have godly knowledge like remember remember of the man vessel eel in the time of Moses the Bible said God filled bezel eels mind with knowledge on how to make the Ark of the Covenant not only that the cherubims on the mercy seat which one of you have ever pounded gold before and made a cherubim is everyone ever made one who's ever made their wings to touch at the top and their heads bowed facing one another who's ever done that has anyone ever done that who has now as to do that I don't I don't know anybody that has that kind of knowledge but there are no doubt people like that but that was an anointing he understood how hot that the gold had to be how to melt it and then how to format how do you form gold around that so to make cherubims face each other how do you how do you make staves how do you do that well God gave him knowledge God gave him an understanding to do that and so God was in that God was in that science church let me say like this any good science God is in it uh remember last week yeah last Sunday not two Sundays ago when I preached on the surface he remember that a little bit on the sermon seat that was science that found that DNA in serpents there's DNA about how to build arms and legs in snakes every snakes got it that's a good that's a good thing of knowledge right that's a good dose of knowledge I'm glad they found that it proves that serpent seed is right it's one more proof there's nothing wrong with that if they got a medication that helps your heart praise God that's a little good medicine there if they've got something that'll clean out a wound and take away the infection thank God for that so see I mean all these with that we have to understand all these statements from brother Brian we have to rightly divide them and if you rightly divide it you'll see he was right but a lot of people misunderstand what brother Branham said like here's another example brother branham said I believe education is the worst is the worst detriment to society but then they tried to set up meetings for him to preach remember this about a man we talked about this in 1964 to preach the trumpets and he said well I can't do it because I got to take the kids back to Arizona so they can be in school since the brother Brad wasn't contradicting himself he was just making a general statement yes overall human education reasoning that denies creation is evil it's a great detriment to society but yet he realized the value of teaching your children to read and write and do math because then you can read the Bible praise God amen and you can understand how to how to work and make a living and he said when you do that you make life a little easier on this side see the smarter you are life can be a little bit easier now what that means is easier on your body so you can do things for God more praise God like I was talking to a brother I'm not gonna name him but if from cams Church it was after the second service and he's like I don't know how you do it Jesse you preach you make videos you write books he said I don't know how you do it I said it's very simple brother I said I can do things you can't but you can do things I can't and he was he was telling me how you know he he's he's into all kinds of hands-on work he says I get home from work and I'm cash out I can't do anything I said well that's because your jobs harder than mine I said there's nothing wrong with that I said we're just and I said you can do things you know he's renovated the church he renovated his home numerous occasions all kinds of things and that's all good knowledge you don't and so is right there's a knowledge for writing books there's a knowledge for building buildings and and that's all of God those are all good things as long as they serve God's purpose amen and so we must of them we must understand that God gives us knowledge for a good reason to glorify Him there's nothing wrong with knowledge a lot of people just misunderstanding they got the wrong slant on on quotes from brother branham remember God in Isaiah let me get the scripture here Isaiah 116 220 we're not going to read all but but God said you remember common reason with me that your sins that are scarlet may be made white God says common reason and if you read the book Church of Isaiah if you haven't read it do the people reason to the people get right with God no God tells him come use some knowledge and repent and do what's right and they turn him down they'd rather give their knowledge to idols and riches God says come use your reasoning skills come try to understand what you're doing wrong and they turn him down but we're the opposite amen we use our knowledge of God in our lives and are in the Word of God and we use that to let Jesus wash our robes white as snow amen that's right that's Isaiah chapter one I mean you can see it plainly in the scripture so see reasoning is good if it's God's reasoning which is called knowledge but reasoning with human reasons is evil because it rejects God's Word I think that's quite plain like Genesis 3 though this is the example brother Branham gives with Eve she reasoned against God's Word I think I shared this with you I think it's worth saying again when the serpent said you'll be like God knowing good and evil he was saying you will be the judge you can be equal with God and you can judge you're the absolute that's what he was saying right and so she reasoned some thought yeah God is hiding something from me and I won I can be like God and I need to be like God and she reasoned and disobeyed God's Word she should have just believed what it said and not injected the word not in there now there was more than not because then Satan added on this special new promise that they'd never heard of introduce some new new uh new knowledge serpent knowledge see it was a false claim and so and as a result of that is all of our gray hairs those of us who got it right be a mother that's what brother Labor's on and that sermon he says every siren all those riots is a result of reasoning against God's Word right the murder the cops murdering the innocent man it's a result of human reasoning remember God puts it on Adam - because Adam chose to fall he was the first one she was the see but Adam did it willingly we know he did it as a type of Christ but yet he still sinned he still transgressed against God's Word let me said I guess he's still reasoned with this human mind we know he did a good thing though as far as saving his wife or taking his wife sin upon him as a type of Christ but Jesus comes the other way instead of thinking out of this or there's things Satan knows that God is trying to show me right another thing that Jesus says I'm only gonna do what pleases the father that's real knowledge right there he said I always do God's will the things that please God and because of that Christ was exalted and he purchased our full Redemption if you put up here Romans five eighteen and nineteen there for us by the offence of one look it says one and in the context it's Adam now I believe because Adam and Eve are one and if that's wrong well then just Adam because Adam he knew better Eve didn't but the Bible Paul puts the blame on Adam in this scripture it's Romans 5:18 and nineteen there for us by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation he's comparing the two men right the first Adam and the last Adam amen grace thank God we got the last Adam why because we're coming to the last II praise God that's us amen the last Eve one who be faithful with God's Word just like the last animus was faithful with God's Word hallelujah even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men and the justification of life first by one man's disobedience he's singling out Adam so sinners don't let yourself get beat up about this you know any woman would have done that any man would have done that but the Bible puts the condemnation here are the disobedience upon a man one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous amen see Adam reason Eve reason with human reasoning but Jesus reasoned with the word and memory church he didn't need one miracle to overcome that lion serpent he just needed obedience to the word it's written it's written it's written I'm not gonna do what you're telling me to do I wanna do what God leads me to do amen you gotta worry about any America you know worried about any tongue you got don't have to worry about any prophecy you have to worry about any divine healing God will lead you to do it when it's time to do it praise God you have to worry about it God if you're so in tune with God then you're just a glove he's gonna put on the glove and use you for his glory we had a good testimony there's a 19 year old man there on Sunday and he came in he looked really mean and everything like that well I preach and I kind of mentioned some pornography will he come up and repented of his pornography you shoulda saw his face like he was like like he knew like I was there's the Holy Spirit preaching I'm not me I was just kind of I always go that route you know most groups of men are gonna have to pornography problems even in the message of course that's why they're so cold on God yeah so he comes up and brother cam and I were gonna pray for him and I said he said I'm bound by this pornography demon and I said well confess it now I say confess it to Jesus Christ so he was already crying his face was so red it was crying I said you confess he confessed it I said you want to be free he said yeah I said I said cam and I are gonna loose you from this demon in the name of Jesus Christ we prayed and loosed him and about that time Cam's wife started screaming like a siren in the back proven that those demons were leaving praise God and you shoulda saw him afterwards he was like a brand-new man and this is a man that had a real deep dark history cam told me the history a real deep dark history into pornography really deep and dark but see our God is so faithful I didn't know I didn't know him from anybody praise God but Jesus Christ knows everybody Amen and I said when you expose Satan he's got to go praise God right when you expose him and confess and you admit you want to be free the Sun is going to set you free amen but you got to confess and it want to be set free oh it's so good to see the power of the Holy Spirit amen see it's just whenever God whenever people want to be free that's when they'll be free if I could say people like brother Brooks was telling me last night I was talking to him on the phone he's like he's like brother Jes I've tried to save so many people and I realized I come to the conclusion I can't save them they got to want to be saved I said I've done the same I've been guilty the same every person that seems to fall away I take it personally but how come I don't fall away because I love Jesus if people want an excuse to go they're gonna go we can't force people to be safe we can point them to be saved let me say like this we command them to be saved because Jesus commanded he says enter into the straight gate he didn't say you might want to enter he said enter it was a direct command you're either gonna enter in the narrow or the broad let's go the narrow way praise God God Jesus commands us it's not well if you want to invite Jesus in your heart I it's it's I command you to repent and get those demons off you and get the anointing of the Holy Spirit and become a man that's restored unto godliness amen how do you how much time do I got him feeling pretty good twelve minutes all right thank the Lord Church it's a reality I've seen praise God over and over and over again if you want to be free it's your choice it's your free more agency God will set you free hey man I was hoping not to use my voice so loud anyway Matt what can I do I need someone I need someone to stand up in the back and say don't preach so hard your throats gonna regret it tomorrow daddy somebody said I'm saying try to stop now because I told the law remember when my voice went out over there I promised the Lord I said I vow Lord if you heal my voice I'll try to be better with my voice I don't I don't let my zeal eat up my wisdom now Jesus yeah maybe I'll just do a couple more here before we close yeah Jesus deals with the reasoning of some scribes in mark 2 this is I'm gonna turn there my Bible mark 2 verse 1 the Bible said they reason in their heart against Jesus marker 2 1 to 12 look at verse 6 but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts now the scribes or some of the sneakiest ones but they ain't men because they spent their whole deck he imagined 8 hours a day just copying the Old Testament oh shout not lie and then they go out there and they lie like they're big they actually exalted themselves as far as public status above the priests because they knew the word better see so thou shalt not lie they should not lie they were lying they were lying to Jesus they were trying to deceive Jesus and so they get all upset here Jesus as a there's a palsy paralytic man here in Capernaum and Jesus preaches the word and Jesus sees their faith they open up the roof in the Peters house and they let down this this man here and Jesus I love this he sees their faith church I want I want to see your faith I want you to see my things remember faith works if you've got faith it works works is faith expressed in the head right and it all operates by love right either works your works your love makes you work for God or your love for the world makes you work for the devil one of the other and so he in verse 6 but there were certain of the scribes reasoning in their hearts why does this man speak blasphemies see they the reason they were reasoning say he's blaspheming and he wasn't who can forgive sins but God only I love this they they thought they believed men they thought he's not God everybody was I know yeah he was God manifest in the flesh amen but their reasons they came up with well he's not God he can't forgive sins and Jesus noticed their reasoning against me they're trying to find all the reasons I'm wrong you know cuz remember he's the word now right he rightly he divides soul and spirit asunder see he divided this down to their spirits he cut it down said oh I I see them reasoning in their spirits see he didn't judge their souls at this spot and say oh they're going to hell now he did later in Mark Matthew 23 he said you're the children of hell you're twofold more children the hell like your converts he said your Serpent's your generation of vipers but here the word just cuts and it divides the humans of human mind so Jesus just looks into their human mind and said your reasoning against God's Word and Jesus says in verse 8 and immediately when Jesus perceived in this spirit they so reasoned within themselves he said them why reason you these things in your hearts I had that same thing I was somebody come trying to correct me after the service on Sunday morning by a man during the fellowship and I read the night I read I'm sorry not reason I perceived he was trying to reason with me and later I found out that Joseph Branham is his pastor and you don't even go to church there but I caught that I perceived he's trying to reason and come up with a wrong a wrong reason for his actions I didn't take his correction by the way cuz I think I was right by God's grace so that's what the Holy Spirit does it helps you perceive remember discernment judges people's spirits right he said Jesus says why reason ye these things in your hearts he said whether is it easier to say to the sick a palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know there it is know the knowledge amen see Jesus knows they got the wrong knowledge so he says so you have knows in other words let me give you some knowledge amen let me give you some real godly reasons so you know that I'm doing what I'm called to do amen hallelujah he says but you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the palsy I sing thee arise take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and that beautiful C Church if anybody knew the Messiah was supposed to be God it would have been the scribes because Isaiah 11 he says he's the mighty God and the everlasting father right if anybody should have known it would have been them so he said so he says I see your reasoning against the word the Messiah is God in the flesh and I can forgive sins because my father dwells in me praise God Alleluia and I come in my father's name and I am the image of the invisible father there it is praise God thank you Lord so he gives him one more chance to reject their sinful reasoning and he says I'm gonna heal this man so you know that I have power on earth to forgive sins in other words I'm gonna heal him so you can try it so I'll give you a chance to receive the knowledge of God instead of the knowledge of man is that beautiful praise God I love this this well I'd say the Bible becomes a new Bible when you receive the message because you can see you can see spirit soul body Jesus breaking into the spirit by discernment he judges their reasoning right conscious memory reason reason he breaks in their human spirit and helps them to no tries to get them there know the truth and shine the knowledge of God's Word on them all right five minutes praise God okay go to Acts seventeen it's 1 to 1 to 12 this is a very familiar one in your daily prayer and Bible time reading I've been encouraging you to get a journal write out your questions you need to do that you need to you need to be inquisitive about God's Word right I always highlight circle and you know then email myself if I got a question so I can put it into a document you know so I can preach it later but you should be doing that you should be coming up with more knowledge of God all the time praise God praise God now in acts 17 one to twelve of course we're not going to read all that he gets some opposition in Thessalonica and then in verse 10 and the Brethren immediately sent away Paul incise by night unto Berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews these were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily whether those things were so praise God praise God now I missed a scripture here though oh yeah I missed verse two I'm sorry yeah let's go down to verse two sonication and Paul as his manner was they look how does a missionary work in Paul how did Paul work as a missionary verse two his manner was he went in unto them and three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures why wasn't he just doing miracles the whole time because he couldn't do him unless God told him to do him so what did he know for sure brother Damon if God's not going to America what what do I know for sure I should try to do get them to receive the knowledge of God amen give them reasons from this Holy Bible I know this is Jose's or what give them reasons from this Bible to believe in your God amen if God's not gonna do America he's not gonna heal the sick or raise the dead the very least we should do is give them reasons to believe hallelujah so see like brother Simon sometimes you know that first time you were at 14 baptisms that was a mighty move of God most of them went back in the world I know there's one family I think still hanging on but like let's say there was no miracle well that's okay God can still be in that because God is the one who determines when miracles happen God is the one that uses your gifts not you so Paul three weeks in a row can you imagine that sister three weeks in a row all she does is try to just do a Bible study can't you see Jesus with Isaiah 53 can't you see he did Genesis 350 okay it was just it was just reasoning amen it was just trying to get them to receive the knowledge of God amen and then brother hey man if they received the knowledge surely they go back and get faith in virtue right right he's trying to use knowledge to reason say you shouldn't believe we're still in the days of the Old Testament we're the New Testament he try to prove to them that Jesus Christ came and fulfilled all these promises and that now you can have a new heart a new spirit and the Holy Spirit amen he was trying to show them the Ezekiel 36 is for failed praise God you can have the Holy Spirit in your heart hallelujah I mean soul you know what I mean so see paul models reasoning just like jesus reason and gave them reasons fine I'll heal this man so you'll know and a reason to believe that I am the son of man and I can forgive sins in other words on the Messiah I am God in the flesh now Paul he just does an old-fashioned Bible study remember his part remember the parchment Paul said Paul told Timothy in his last letter he said now remember when you come in the winter makes you bring my one coat not my whole wardrobe buy one coat bring my one coat and the parchments in other words bring those empty Scrolls so I can write God's Word and send it out to the world praise God amen give them reasons to believe and give them the knowledge of God oh there's about 35 minutes that's my reminder to close that wasn't too bad was it I was pretty good I give up I'm preaching an hour and a half tonight I'm just kidding no I'm just kidding all right now no no what did they do now here's what I was saying Church in verse 11 you have to receive the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures whether these things are B so now we're not up we're not borderline believers or not we are fully fledged believers but we need to search the Scriptures about the rapture right we need to search the scriptures about the baptism of the holy ghost right anything that we have a question on there or it's we don't understand or it's going to be fulfilled in the future we should search the Scriptures on that to find the reasons of the hope that we have within us like Amen this week he said he wasn't even trying to witness to his stepsister but I'm sure you saw brother Amen once it got going the answers just started flowing out of you right yeah same thing with when I witness to even when I preach sometimes I'm not even planning on preach of things but they get to a certain subject and it just starts flowing out flowing out it just it just comes right and it's God using our words as a as a fountain of water praise God to flow out so the people can have a chance to quench their spiritual thirst amen that's right because God always uses man to save man he could have preached by angels he chose to preach by fallen men redeem men by the Holy Spirit sissie Church got to search the Scriptures daily see and if you don't hunger after God's Word then you're hungry after something else you shouldn't be hungry after right if you don't hunger and satisfy that holy thirst you'll start trying to hush it by enjoying worldly pleasures right you're either feeding the white dog or the black dog and the church said I mean you're only it's a one of the other either the sin nature you're feeding or the divine nature let's feed that divine nature let's search the Scriptures daily let's listen to tape this tapes daily do what you must do to stay with God's Word alright got seven minutes so I'm gonna close with this thought and that'll be 45 minutes oh yes praise of the hardhead that worked out pretty good now these are three the Bible gives three metaphors for knowledge I forgot to bring I was gonna bring my keys keys are a metaphor of knowledge okay and this will be helpful next week as we look at the gift of knowledge because knowledge is an attribute but there's a separate gift of knowledge okay and if you have the gift of knowledge you speak God's Word and it opens doors for people or you speak God's Word sister Beatrice and it's like the darkness scatters light comes on oh now I understand it or the other one is fragrance now a lot of these fragrances today are really bad chemicals right and we're allergic to some of them but if it's a real good like a oil base you know maybe essential oil fragrance I don't know my wife oh no she wrote a book about that she know about that but if it's a healthy substance that is something you want to enjoy and you can instantly observe it and you can catch the fragrance of it and it just changes the atmosphere the right because we've all walked into rooms where they smell awful sometimes it's humans fault sometimes and the most fault there's all kinds of reasons for bad fragrances but the Bible says knowledge is like three things it's like a key a light and a fragrance in Luke 11 Jesus says you lawyers you've taken away the key of knowledge and you've not entered in yourself and then that entering you hindered and they says later Matthew 23:23 you have shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men can you imagine that they knew Jesus was the Messiah Nicodemus said he said we know you're a master sent from God you know the reason God blinded them was because they knew he was God but they rejected him anyway that's the reason God blinded them because their unbelief so they knew they haven't they had the keys imagine that believing they had the keys to get in but they cut they were taping people out of salvation and that's why Jesus said you are of your father the devil Jesus wanted people to go in the door but they were holding the people back from entering and say don't enter or they let him do it and they're hiding the keys they go ahead I got the keys I'm not giving you the keys and that's why they were twofold more the children of hell than others before them because they knew it a member that would get greater condemnation those Pharisees Sadducees scribes lawyers in Jesus time there's a greater condemnation because the preacher was greater he was greater than Solomon he was Jesus Christ a greater than Solomon so see knowledge is like a key so meditate on that this week anytime God uses your words to open a door for someone and now they can enter into salvation or now they can enter in their deliverance right anytime God uses a word of knowledge it opens a door and somebody gets a victory somebody gets into something new they've never got into before oh yeah and there's Bible examples I'll get them next week there's lots of Bible examples now we're not going to go through all of them but member Peter had the keys to the kingdom he opened the salvation to the Jews on the day of Pentecost the Gentiles in acts 10 and the Samaritans in acts 8 he had the key it was the knowledge of God in Jesus Christ praise God now the other one is a light light knowledge is a light second Peter one three and four okay went on that's not the one second Corinthians 4:6 to seven I'm sorry honey st. Corinthians for six to seven I was looking a different passage beautiful in church there's one place this light shines in their heart and I could tell like with Adam even Adams brother was telling me he said when Adam was addicted to drugs he would always be looking to leave because he was looking for the next drug deal he said it was twitching all the time and I remember Adam can do that too not so much but but he said now he said the reason I know he's set free Matt told me this his brother is because he looks at you he said you can see peace in his eyes right you can see the Friends of God and there's no rush to get off to the next drug deal or the next whatever there's just peace you can see it on people oh yeah and that's what the light of God does God commands the light to shine out of darkness he shine where in your hearts in your minds church see that light shines and all of a sudden your mind was in darkness but now it's bright now the darkness is fleed away and now there's light there now you can see to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so in other words it's like Jesus Christ's face is always in your mind amen and thank God we got a pretty close picture of what his face actually looks like right through mr. Hoffman and not the Hoffman on the piano guy that's what the Bible says it's the now that the light of knowledge when you learn about Jesus crisis powers like a light ball goes off in your mind and now all day you just think about Jesus all day he's a key he's also a light knowing him is a key and then knowing him is a light in your mind remember Paul said forgot Jesus told Paul I'm gonna use you to take the people from the power of darkness to the power of light amen that's why he would use knowledge this is what's the true this is unders this how you understand the Bible this is how you understand the Old Testament this is how you understand the New Testament that's power that's not wimpy preaching that's profit preaching the profit ball reasoning from the scriptures amen three times in a row right three Sabbath's in a row reasoning that's real Holy Spirit she's trying to shine the lights into their minds and the last one is a metaphor as a fragrance second Corinthians 2 so two chapters earlier verses 14 to 16 now thanks be to God which always causes us I love this church are you a witness to this does he always cause you to triumph are you a winner or are you a loser I'm a winner praise God amen I may have a few losses every now and then but overall I'm overcoming praise God I'm a winner I'm bound to win because Christ one for me praise God he fought the battle for me amen and he's faithful to finish what he started in my life he says always causes me to triumph I always get the victory brother I always get the victory sister Beatrice I don't know how but I always get the victory it might take a few years it might take a few months but Jesus Christ causes me to triumph amen hallelujah eventually giving to you over that spirit and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place see everywhere they'd go they share the knowledge of God and he says it's like a fragrance for we are unto God a sweet savour unto Christ so Christ's smells our testimony in them that are saved and then that perish so see the God Jesus smells our testimony or so do sinners sinners don't like our holy smell so the one we are savour of death unto death see because we tell them to command them to get saved if they turn it down they die but the other the savour of life unto life I love seeing that one it don't happen very much anymore but I love to see my life shines and people get life I talk about Jesus Christ and they move from death to life amen hey like the brother with the pornography he went from death to life amen through the knowledge of God's Word amen that and that's a sweet-smelling God's nostrils in Christ's nostrils let's stand to our feet praise God we'll look at it again next week never underestimate musicians you can come in if you've got a song buddy let me know never underestimate just speaking God's word remember I told you I didn't even know I could be saved from chewing tobacco until I read first Corinthians 6:12 I saw I forget who shared it with me but this is my own testimony because of this scripture I got delivered from addiction it was just knowledge all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any when I read that sister naomi is like that that's always like for me I didn't even realize it I don't have to be under bondage to this I don't have to and I'm not supposed to praise God and I have power to not be brought under it praise God and I started seeing that little tin as how is this little plastic tin defeating me a child of God and it wasn't long after that Haven to the Holy Spirit deliver me from it praise God instead of that tin ruling over me i triumphed over it praise God because Jesus Christ always causes us to triumph in Christ amen through the knowledge I just had to know the scripture and then it was like a light went on I don't have to keep doing this I don't have to get mouth cancer someday I can be cancer free and that will help me to serve Jesus better if I don't have cancer Church that's the power of just sharing any Scripture you know remember I told you that you can play something uh we'll walk in the light tell my dad that Texas brother named Wesley he was under condemnation I just talked to him for an hour on the phone and I said there's no kind of nation than there in Jesus I said if you confess your sins first first John 1:9 he's faithful and just to forgive you along righteousness he called me three days later on a Wednesday and said all my demonic condemnation has left me I'm free from it I just shared a couple scriptures on the phone and demons left his house they left his mind it don't take much God makes it easy for us cuz they're like this God just takes over our lives and we just say what he wants to say there's no pressure I did for the amen I wasn't feeling that tingle go down my spine I didn't feel super annoying like brother ended I just whatever came to my I was course I was bone you know I know it's like forgiving I know it's like to be delivered I know it's like to have all the condemnation leave and I just shared those scriptures to several scriptures and the demons leave them in what does that knowledge knowledge understanding of God's Word when you say you're sorry and you mean it that condemnation leaves and now you're perfectly forgiven in Jesus Christ's name praise God hallelujah yeah later stop right there hallelujah thank you lord [Music] Church I love each and every one of you appreciate all your testimonies we're in this for the long haul praise God we don't know what Jesus will come it looks darker now than it ever has been it probably is it's only gonna get more deceptive and more dark but yet the light here shines so bright we're not wondering [Music] we're not wondering as Jesus you know he's real the light has come on and I've got keys to the kingdom I see I've seen people who come into the kingdom praise God I've seen them delivered from the powers of darkness and into the powers of God [Music] we've seen this brother than if you ever saw I seen that I think about this we walk in the knowledge I think this knowledge bud I'll walk in the knowledge that God has created to me as much as I understand I'll walk in how many will say Amen whatever God helps me to understand out do it now say like this even if I don't understand it God says it I still want to do it I want to trust his knowledge and know that you will bear every word of God no crop seeds this seat Packer [Music]
