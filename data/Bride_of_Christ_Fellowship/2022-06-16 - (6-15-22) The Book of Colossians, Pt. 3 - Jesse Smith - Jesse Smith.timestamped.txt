[8:10] jesus christ's name saint said
[8:12] amen god bless you as you're being
[8:14] seated there praise god
[8:19] i'm going to show some slides here
[8:26] i'm going to just review real real
[8:27] briefly i'll just try to keep this real
[8:30] brief here i've preached two sermons on
[8:32] the book of colossians you know we just
[8:33] go verse by verse
[8:35] i felt inspired about five or six years
[8:38] ago if the saints be on the curtain of
[8:41] time are shouting we're resting on what
[8:43] paul preached and we need to know what
[8:44] paul preached
[8:46] and so i lord by god's grace i preached
[8:48] all the way through galatians ephesians
[8:50] philippians and now i'm in colossians by
[8:53] god's dreams that preached to those
[8:55] epistles of paul so we hope that if the
[8:57] lord terry said i don't know if the lord
[8:58] is going to tarry but he terrorists hope
[8:59] we can get through this one and then
[9:01] get back to romans and corinthians just
[9:03] be beautiful to delay in these
[9:05] scriptures and remember romans 2 16 says
[9:08] will be judged by the gospel that paul
[9:10] taught that's right by jesus christ so
[9:12] jesus christ will stand there he'll have
[9:14] paul's apost paul's uh paul's words
[9:16] right there that is the judgment
[9:18] standard so praise god how do we live up
[9:19] to that standard amen it's called the
[9:21] high calling in christ amen
[9:23] we're supposed to walk worthy of the
[9:25] high calling now god's not asking us for
[9:27] absolute perfection he knows we're going
[9:28] to sit every day but he asks us to die
[9:31] every day amen that's one thing we can
[9:33] do amen we have the choice to die to
[9:35] ourselves every single day praise god
[9:37] and walk in the spirit and then if we're
[9:39] walking the spirit then we are the sons
[9:41] and daughters of god hallelujah so i
[9:43] just want to briefly look at just remind
[9:45] us of a few things you know uh just for
[9:47] a map there just have an idea
[9:49] colossae was about
[9:52] uh what was it 11 miles how many miles
[9:54] was that
[9:58] oh it was about 100 miles east of
[10:00] ephesus and 12 miles from laodicea
[10:04] so there you have ephesus laodicea
[10:07] and then colossae so just to give you an
[10:08] idea there modern day turkey uh where
[10:11] it's at where it stands today it's that
[10:13] pile of dirt right there that's that's
[10:14] colossae right there the power dirt
[10:16] right
[10:18] it just ruins and it's unexcavated and
[10:20] it hasn't been rebuilt or anything after
[10:22] an earthquake
[10:24] history says it it collapsed
[10:27] between 60 and 62 a.d through an
[10:30] earthquake and it was never rebuilt it
[10:32] just kind of moved on as you can see
[10:33] they moved
[10:34] further uh east it looks like and built
[10:36] civilization there
[10:39] so they had less than a decade after
[10:41] receiving paul's letter to manifest
[10:43] christ to that city this was a city on a
[10:47] timer
[10:48] right there
[10:49] sound familiar
[10:50] this nation is on a timer
[10:53] right we preached a few weeks ago on the
[10:54] earth was filled with violence yeah i
[10:57] mean that's all it is now violence all
[10:59] it is in the news there's murders and
[11:01] all kinds and then uh these corrupt
[11:03] judges won't prosecute some of these
[11:04] people it's just it's becoming just like
[11:06] the days of noah more and more we
[11:08] thought it was
[11:09] even 20 30 years ago look at it today
[11:11] praise god it's getting worse and worse
[11:13] and worse thank god for grace and thank
[11:16] god for the saints of god that are
[11:17] holding back judgment praise god
[11:20] because we're here right because we're
[11:21] here all right grace is extended to this
[11:23] land amen right
[11:25] and god is still looking to get the last
[11:27] final souls amen
[11:29] the bible says the long suffering of god
[11:31] is salvation amen amen so while we're
[11:34] our hearts are burdened and we're we're
[11:36] uh
[11:37] we're grieved by the the violence and
[11:39] the destruction the perversion of
[11:41] sodomites and laodicea at the same time
[11:44] we know god is still winning souls amen
[11:47] amen god just sent us two souls last
[11:49] year praise god amen i'm sorry uh lena
[11:51] and brother austin praise god so god is
[11:53] still in the business of saving souls
[11:54] amen sure hallelujah and so we looked at
[11:57] that and i'm going to just i'll just
[11:59] background with that and then uh
[12:02] let's just read again verses one to
[12:03] eight here by god's grace just briefly
[12:05] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[12:07] will of god and timotheus to our brother
[12:09] to the saints and faithful brethren in
[12:11] christ with you at colossae grace be
[12:13] unto you and peace from god our father
[12:15] and the lord jesus christ we have thanks
[12:17] to god and the father of our lord jesus
[12:18] christ
[12:19] praying always for you so church if you
[12:22] can't remember something to pray for
[12:24] pray for a church
[12:26] because paul always prayed for the
[12:28] colossians true remember he told that to
[12:30] the philippians 2. he said i'm always
[12:32] praying you with all all prayer that's
[12:34] right so see that's one thing we must
[12:35] never forget we can't remember who to
[12:37] pray for uh we've already prayed for all
[12:39] of our needs let's pray for a church
[12:40] amen let's pray for the people to grow
[12:43] in in the knowledge of god as we'll see
[12:44] in just a moment here
[12:46] verse 4 since we heard of your faith in
[12:48] christ jesus and of the love which you
[12:50] have to all saints for the hope which is
[12:52] laid up for you in heaven whereof ye
[12:54] heard before in the word of the truth of
[12:57] your of the gospel
[12:58] which has come unto you as it is in all
[13:00] the world and bringeth forth fruit as it
[13:02] does also in you since the day you heard
[13:04] it and knew the grace of god in truth
[13:08] as he also learned of epiphrous our dear
[13:10] fellow servant who is for you a faithful
[13:13] minister of christ who also declared
[13:15] unto us your love in the spirit remember
[13:18] colossae was a church paul did not start
[13:22] epa fresh started the church his name
[13:24] means beloved god sent a beloved
[13:25] minister there amen that's what we all
[13:27] want to be ministers want to be a
[13:28] beloved minister amen one that god loves
[13:31] and that is true to god's word
[13:32] hallelujah but notice they didn't they
[13:36] didn't meet the prophet but they still
[13:38] enjoyed the prophet's word amen that's
[13:40] like us amen we didn't know the prophet
[13:42] we didn't see the prophet but we've got
[13:44] the prophet's word hallelujah right
[13:46] and he declared the love of them to paul
[13:51] they love paul's work they love paul's
[13:53] preaching they love the gospel of jesus
[13:55] christ because they knew it in truth
[13:56] aren't you glad church that god's
[13:58] rescued you out of denominational
[14:00] systems sure
[14:01] you are rescued out of there you know
[14:03] the grace of god and truth
[14:05] right they know the grace of god with
[14:07] air
[14:09] it's not real grace it's actually
[14:11] disgrace
[14:12] but you and i know it in a truth amen
[14:15] we've known the truth there's one faith
[14:17] one lord one baptism
[14:20] we know the truth
[14:21] god the word of god in truth praise god
[14:24] glory to god we're not getting a
[14:25] watered-down gospel we're not getting a
[14:27] gospel amen we're getting needy word of
[14:29] god
[14:31] something you can grow on something you
[14:32] can chew on something that will build up
[14:34] your spiritual muscles hallelujah
[14:36] amen that's exactly right church if not
[14:39] you already would have been too weak and
[14:41] you would have given up
[14:42] yeah you wouldn't be able to handle the
[14:44] pressures of life see your spiritual
[14:47] stronger amen your spiritual your
[14:49] spiritual muscles are exercised unto
[14:51] godliness amen amen
[14:54] i've been feeding on meat and milk just
[14:56] had a milk diet you wouldn't have been
[14:58] able to handle these waves of pressures
[15:00] that the devil is bringing in but
[15:02] because he brings them in god raises up
[15:04] strength against him hallelujah
[15:06] hallelujah thank god that proves you are
[15:08] eating on the meat of god's word and i
[15:10] am too because god doesn't let our
[15:12] enemies triumph over us
[15:14] i love that verse from the book of
[15:16] psalms ain't that hallelujah verse nine
[15:18] read that
[15:19] now look at verse nine it's a five-fold
[15:22] prayer i think that's beautiful
[15:23] five-fold prayer from a five-fold
[15:25] ministry that's right and there's a man
[15:27] that had all the five gifts of the holy
[15:28] s uh preaching
[15:30] i proved that a couple years ago by
[15:31] god's grace through the word of god and
[15:32] history he had all five gifts of the
[15:34] faithful ministry and here he gives a
[15:36] five-fold prayer for the saints
[15:40] now there it is but i'm just going to
[15:42] just skip ahead because i already
[15:43] preached it briefly
[15:44] now look at this saints
[15:48] god wants you to possess all that he has
[15:51] for you so look at here's the five
[15:52] things
[15:53] god paul prayed you would have knowledge
[15:55] of god's will in all wisdom remember
[15:58] wisdom is sound advice right
[16:01] it's what to do and how to do it right
[16:04] that's wisdom
[16:05] wisdom has built at her house again so
[16:08] wisdom knows how to get something done
[16:10] amen that's right true knowledge is just
[16:13] what you need to that's the materials to
[16:15] build the house but wisdom is how you do
[16:17] it amen it's how to do it when to do it
[16:19] when this per so so god
[16:22] god has paul prayed for you that we
[16:24] would know god's will with all wisdom
[16:27] and spiritual understanding
[16:30] what a prayer
[16:33] and church you can pray for me for that
[16:36] if you would amen pray that i'll have
[16:39] all the wisdom of god in spiritual
[16:42] understanding amen amen i'll pray
[16:45] amen bless the lord jesus because if
[16:48] church if we don't if you we don't
[16:49] choose wisdom what are we going to
[16:50] choose foolishness
[16:52] we're going to make a foolish mistake a
[16:54] foolish decision
[16:55] right wasting our time or wasting god's
[16:58] resources you know we're wasting we
[16:59] don't want to waste time we want to
[17:00] redeem time amen
[17:03] so second he prayed you would walk unto
[17:06] all pleasing so he wants you to have all
[17:08] wisdom
[17:09] he wants to have all pleasing you see
[17:11] the pattern here
[17:12] third he wants you fruitful and every
[17:14] good work or all works
[17:17] praise god it was everything you do to
[17:19] bring forth some type of fruit amen
[17:23] and he wants you increasing in the
[17:24] knowledge of god
[17:27] do you see any backsliding in here or
[17:29] any quitting or any any days off or do
[17:32] you see any of that in here
[17:33] no it's all increasing it's more wisdom
[17:36] more all-pleasing all works more
[17:38] knowledge of god this is a great prayer
[17:41] it's a prayer of a prophet amen
[17:44] and strengthened with what all might god
[17:47] want you to be as strong as you can
[17:49] possibly believe with all the might of
[17:51] god hallelujah
[17:53] unto us all patience with joy
[17:59] this is overwhelming this is this is
[18:01] concentrating truth brother
[18:03] how does a man get and how does a man
[18:05] get a vocabulary like this

[19:25] life then for a christian praise god
[19:28] and since they only had 10 years to
[19:30] manifest it somebody in that church was
[19:33] going to manifest this prayer praise god
[19:36] does the bible say the prayers of the
[19:37] saints are stored up in vials
[19:39] glory that means this prayer amen was
[19:42] stored up in a vial praise god and it's
[19:44] going to be poured out someone's going
[19:46] to manifest this and let us say like
[19:47] this we can manifest it today because

[19:55] mistakes
[19:56] hallelujah we don't have to have works
[19:59] that are done in vain

[20:59] foolish
[21:00] glory we won't decrease in our
[21:02] understanding of god our works won't be
[21:04] uh unprofitable but everything we do
[21:07] will please the lord

[21:57] this is a prayer and sometimes you might
[21:59] gloss over this trying to get ahead of
[22:00] what to the godhead part here in this
[22:02] chapter
[22:03] and these two mysteries in chapter one
[22:05] and two
[22:06] remember chapter one and two have two
[22:08] mysteries the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:10] and then the godhead
[22:11] there's two mysteries paul specifically
[22:13] calls them mysteries in the first two
[22:15] chapter
[22:17] we've got to be careful let's not skip
[22:18] over these beautiful prayers here by

[28:50] testimony from yesterday
[28:52] with your friend i'm going to try to be
[28:53] very general there's a friend that our
[28:55] daughters had
[28:57] who was contemplating suicide

[29:09] they just waited on the lord for the
[29:10] right time they could tell the person

[29:14] and one by one they went up and hugged
[29:16] her and said i just want to tell you
[29:18] i love you
[29:21] right and then there was two or three or
[29:22] right bugs in a row praise god amos
[29:26] that's it that is not human nature
[29:29] that's god's nature yeah
[29:32] that's right
[29:35] that's right is that right
[29:38] cherry is god's nature that's love amen
[29:42] it bears all things it holds all things
[29:45] eternal life is living for others and
[29:48] showing others love praise god
[29:50] and when you show love you make a
[29:52] sacrifice and you show love what is this
[29:54] showing it's showing you are partaking
[29:56] you are feasting at the king's table
[29:59] you're eating his bread you're drinking
[30:00] his water you're his life is being lived
[30:02] through you hallelujah
[30:05] thank god praise the lord hallelujah
[30:10] or when you stay up texting somebody
[30:12] pleading with them not to commit suicide
[30:14] oh
[30:15] and praying for them by god
[30:17] yeah that's partaking of the divine
[30:19] nature you're out here man because we
[30:21] know the other nature we've heard
[30:22] stories from people like yeah just end
[30:24] your life and you're like yeah i've
[30:25] heard stories about that there's been on
[30:27] the news and things like what an awful
[30:28] wicked yeah spirit of death but that's
[30:30] the human nature that's the animal
[30:32] nature we are not of that nature we have
[30:34] better promises amen we have great and
[30:37] precious promises to express eternal
[30:39] life and charity and love and we are
[30:42] partakers of that tonight
[30:44] hallelujah
[30:46] [Music]
[30:52] so according to verse 11 god wants to
[30:54] give you strength to manifest all
[30:56] patience
[30:57] and every good gift
[31:00] i have a hard time this is such a deep
[31:02] scripture
[31:05] it's like god is in every area when
[31:07] we're walking to obedience god is in
[31:09] everything that we do
[31:11] so sister is using the meal you put on
[31:13] the table that's right
[31:15] did you want laundry you did sure sure
[31:18] is that building patients when you have
[31:19] to do laundry load after laundry level
[31:21] am i preaching down to the level of the
[31:22] system
[31:23] those hard days
[31:25] sure all right brother's got to go out
[31:27] there and mow the grass
[31:28] [Music]
[31:30] got to go to work one more time do some
[31:32] extra overtime to pay off the bill you
[31:34] know wash your broken i gotta work a
[31:36] little more
[31:38] you know it just
[31:41] it's this desire that that in every area
[31:44] of our life we can grow to be more of a
[31:46] servant we can be more humble we can
[31:49] become more like christ hallelujah amen
[31:53] every good gift every word always
[31:56] increasing in the knowledge of
[31:58] god so that's what my question is how
[32:01] many services or how much time is needed
[32:03] to receive the full strength of patience
[32:05] if i'm supposed to have all the might of
[32:07] god how many is that going to take well
[32:09] it's probably not going to take a number
[32:10] of services probably just a daily life
[32:12] that you live
[32:14] each day you choose to accept god's
[32:16] grace
[32:18] each day you walk and strafe
[32:20] like i had a brother i was at that i was
[32:22] at the graduation party for my niece
[32:25] and i had a man call me up and he said i
[32:27] don't know what is it about you but you
[32:29] were so happy there he said i was
[32:31] ashamed of myself i wanted to be happy
[32:32] like you or something along those lines
[32:35] he's like you were just going up to
[32:36] everybody it's like you had to talk to
[32:38] every person now sometimes that's not a
[32:39] good thing
[32:45] but he said now in my heart life you
[32:47] know i wasn't happy about everything in
[32:48] my heart life but i knew there was
[32:50] people there that didn't have much faith
[32:53] and i had to make sure i go i tried to
[32:55] condescend to the ones that people
[32:57] weren't going to on purpose
[32:59] the holy spirit put that on my heart
[33:00] and i prayed with my uncle and nobody
[33:02] was around him and i just tried to show
[33:03] him some love and he's going to have
[33:05] surgery i just try to
[33:07] increase his faith and say god is with
[33:08] you let me pray for you i join hands
[33:09] with my aunt uncle pray for them
[33:11] he's like okay might as well try it i'm
[33:13] like well
[33:15] god can do great things if you just
[33:16] believe right trying to rebuke that
[33:19] spirit off him
[33:20] pray that spirit often by god's grace
[33:22] but even a man will call me up and say
[33:24] why are you so happy and why can't i i
[33:26] want to be like that
[33:28] it's the love of god amen it's an
[33:30] everyday thing where you you want to all
[33:32] your work you want to magnify jesus you
[33:35] want to show the love of jesus christ
[33:36] because he first loved you praise god
[33:38] amen hallelujah it's a lifestyle
[33:44] so see we should receive all the
[33:45] strength and might
[33:47] on two not unto can mean two or until so
[33:50] we can receive all the strength until we
[33:52] have all patience with long suffering
[33:55] and joy that is that's that's the core
[33:57] of his prayer
[33:59] god give me more strength until i have
[34:02] all the strength to be patient and
[34:04] joyful
[34:06] so when god doesn't answer my prayer in
[34:08] the prayer line right away i can still
[34:10] come on wednesday and give god glory
[34:14] because i know he heard my prayer and
[34:15] i've gotten stronger now i can be joyful
[34:18] i can be patient waiting on god amen
[34:20] amen
[34:22] and i'm putting myself in there too high
[34:23] prayer requests that i pray for i'm
[34:25] still waiting on them sure years years
[34:28] later
[34:29] sure they are yeah and remember we're
[34:31] abraham's seed yeah
[34:35] right sarah
[34:37] what does she do she receives strength
[34:39] that's how she that's how we'll do it
[34:41] that's how she did it we'll receive
[34:43] strength to conceive seed hallelujah
[34:47] to receive the promise of god amen
[34:50] that's right church
[34:54] so verse 12.
[34:55] here we get some new reading first of
[34:57] all
[34:58] giving thanks unto the father so now
[35:00] that we've got our fivefold prayer here
[35:02] from the fivefold minister
[35:04] who had all five gifts

[35:16] thanks to the father
[35:18] because he's made us
[35:21] meet which is
[35:23] equipped with adequate power to perform
[35:26] duties
[35:27] so god father has made us
[35:31] equipped
[35:33] to be partakers
[35:35] in other words he's
[35:36] he's rendered a spit to be partakers or
[35:39] to have a portion or share
[35:41] of the
[35:42] inheritance of the saints
[35:45] in light amen
[35:47] oh that's written
[35:49] these i mean if you really write these
[35:50] down we just skim over these right i
[35:52] gotta read my chapter
[35:54] these are thick and rich and meaty
[35:56] praise god
[35:58] think about that
[36:00] i'm giving thanks to god he made you
[36:03] adequate
[36:04] to have a share of the heavenly
[36:07] inheritance of this age amen
[36:11] we couldn't do it ourselves we couldn't
[36:13] earn heavenly inheritance no
[36:17] if if we could we wouldn't need jesus
[36:19] right but jesus made a way that we could
[36:22] have something up in heaven amen in
[36:25] other words he defeated death he
[36:27] defeated satan he defeated all these
[36:28] demon powers so that we can overcome
[36:31] amen
[36:32] and that we can get a few victories out
[36:34] here by god's grace and then have some
[36:37] portion of inheritance up in amen
[36:41] he equipped us for that praise god
[36:45] he said i'm gonna i have all this i have
[36:47] this eternal amount of glory and i'm
[36:49] gonna give sister lena a share of that
[36:52] i'm to give lydia a share of that

[59:59] about halfway through the sermon here we
[1:00:00] go
[1:00:03] verse 15 who is the image christ is the
[1:00:06] image of the invisible god yes he is the
[1:00:09] firstborn of every now look every
[1:00:11] creature yeah sure that means angel
[1:00:15] right jesus was the firstborn the first
[1:00:18] creature yeah
[1:00:20] created right it was this visible spirit
[1:00:24] yeah the spirit just took on a visible
[1:00:27] form that's good jesus that's good right
[1:00:30] yeah because god's invisible you can
[1:00:32] never and will never be able to see
[1:00:35] god right
[1:00:36] so jesus spirit is only god's spirit now
[1:00:39] made visible praise god we call this the
[1:00:42] logos or the word the visible spirit was
[1:00:44] the firstborn of every creature or
[1:00:46] creation right right
[1:00:48] so before there was
[1:00:51] uh molecules or before there was uh
[1:00:54] atoms or before there was planets or
[1:00:56] seas or
[1:00:57] stars
[1:00:59] there was jesus that's right
[1:01:01] there was the love of god amen
[1:01:04] out of darkness came light
[1:01:06] yeah for by him all things were created
[1:01:09] that means jesus created you
[1:01:11] yeah i'm one of all things
[1:01:13] jesus created me
[1:01:15] sure in heaven and earth visible and
[1:01:18] invisible whether they be thrones or
[1:01:19] dominions principalities powers all
[1:01:22] things were created by him and for i was
[1:01:24] made for jesus
[1:01:25] jesus made me for him amen sure
[1:01:29] he needed a real
[1:01:31] simple
[1:01:33] kind of flighty preacher
[1:01:36] not very smart
[1:01:38] spit a lot
[1:01:40] and so he chose me
[1:01:42] for him

[1:01:45] him
[1:01:46] now now you describe yourself how would

[1:02:35] he placed me there amen
[1:02:37] glory
[1:02:39] it was not jesus flesh
[1:02:41] it was his spirit that was before all
[1:02:44] things that's right
[1:02:47] right and his spirit keeps everything
[1:02:49] right in place
[1:02:50] yeah

[1:03:35] he's consisting us he's making us
[1:03:37] consist
[1:03:38] stay in our position
[1:03:41] has he not kept brother william in the
[1:03:42] message for was it 40 years brother
[1:03:47] how have you consisted
[1:03:49] how have we consisted it's been god's
[1:03:51] grace all right i remember right past 40
[1:03:53] years 40 years of the message a few
[1:03:55] years ago
[1:03:56] i was preaching on that one night and he
[1:03:58] said i said how many years was it
[1:03:59] brother he said 40 years that's what i
[1:04:00] was preaching on number four remember
[1:04:02] that let's reach out to the number 40. i
[1:04:04] asked you how many years spent the
[1:04:05] message you said
[1:04:06] yeah god knows what he's doing praise
[1:04:08] god
[1:04:10] see god's going to keep you in your
[1:04:11] place
[1:04:12] amen now these are uh old old quotes i
[1:04:15] preached from years ago but brother ham
[1:04:17] said
[1:04:19] god he's the only person that can be
[1:04:21] immortal god changing himself into a
[1:04:23] person
[1:04:26] okay
[1:04:26] the bible says
[1:04:28] jesus is the king of kings he's the only
[1:04:30] one with immortality yeah and he dwells
[1:04:33] in the light yeah which no man can
[1:04:35] approach unto you right no man have seen
[1:04:38] it nor can see
[1:04:40] so the light is the logos the holy
[1:04:42] spirit but god is inside of that right
[1:04:45] praise god that's why jesus is god
[1:04:48] yeah because the spirit of jesus is the
[1:04:50] spirit of god
[1:04:52] praise god amen but the light is a
[1:04:54] separate manifestation that can be seen
[1:04:56] you can't see the father but you can see
[1:04:58] the sun
[1:04:59] glory that's right
[1:05:02] he's eternal immortal invisible the only
[1:05:05] wise god so god is the spirit he's
[1:05:07] invisible no man's ever seen him ever
[1:05:09] will and god's spirit dwelled in the
[1:05:11] body of jesus for the body is the
[1:05:14] visible image of the invisible god
[1:05:20] so god the father the spirit was made
[1:05:22] visible in jesus body for jesus said
[1:05:24] when you see me using the father sure
[1:05:27] jesus is the express image or the exact
[1:05:30] reproduction of the person of god
[1:05:32] so he's not a second person he's the
[1:05:35] visible image of the one person amen
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:38] hey
[1:05:39] man
[1:05:42] no it's interesting i had somebody had a
[1:05:44] thought with me i don't know who it was
[1:05:48] when the serpent was lying to adam would
[1:05:50] when sermon was lying to eve he said if
[1:05:52] you take this fruit you'll be like gods
[1:05:55] well if if they thought that that was
[1:05:57] going to make three gods
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:00] because there was only one god
[1:06:02] he says if you sin now you're gonna now
[1:06:04] you're gonna be gods now they're gonna
[1:06:05] have a trinity
[1:06:07] and that that's something i just thought
[1:06:09] that was somebody shared that with me
[1:06:10] like that's a pretty good thought right
[1:06:11] there
[1:06:12] satan was deceiving them until they
[1:06:14] could be like some type of a trinity or
[1:06:15] something like that
[1:06:17] like they could actually get higher than
[1:06:19] the way god already made them
[1:06:21] they couldn't
[1:06:22] they're already perfect they already
[1:06:24] were lowercase gods right they're
[1:06:28] already lowercase anointed ones that's
[1:06:29] what it means messiahs gods is probably
[1:06:31] not a good word to use because god means
[1:06:32] object to worship so i don't know i
[1:06:34] don't use that word very much i use
[1:06:36] messiahs
[1:06:37] we're little anointed ones amen
[1:06:42] now
[1:06:44] for time's sake here loretta said let's
[1:06:46] take a trip back to the beginning a
[1:06:48] hundred million years before there ever
[1:06:49] was a star moon or anything
[1:06:51] there was a time when there wasn't
[1:06:53] nothing here it was all forever in
[1:06:54] eternity and all ever eternity was god
[1:06:57] he was there in the beginning let's go
[1:06:59] out here on the edge of the banister and
[1:07:00] look over and see these things happen
[1:07:03] yeah
[1:07:04] so paul's writing in colossians 1 about
[1:07:06] jesus jesus created all things
[1:07:09] he was before all things and all things
[1:07:10] were made for him so my man said let's
[1:07:12] go look over the banister
[1:07:14] and see what happened
[1:07:18] no man has seen the father in any time
[1:07:20] no man can see god in the body form
[1:07:21] because god's in not in bodily form
[1:07:23] god's a spirit
[1:07:25] sure
[1:07:26] no man has seen god at any time
[1:07:28] but the son
[1:07:29] hath declared him right
[1:07:32] when you've seen jesus you've seen the
[1:07:34] father right
[1:07:36] [Applause]
[1:07:38] he said there's no light no dark there's
[1:07:40] nothing it seems nothing there's a great
[1:07:42] supernatural being jehovah god he
[1:07:44] covered all space in all places of time
[1:07:47] he was from everlasting everlasting he's
[1:07:48] the beginning of the creation that's god
[1:07:50] can't see nothing can't hear nothing not
[1:07:52] a move of adam
[1:07:54] yet god was there
[1:07:58] he said that was god the father
[1:08:01] so before even day one of creation
[1:08:04] before time and days and what could be
[1:08:06] seen in the human dimensions that's what
[1:08:08] we're looking at now what happened
[1:08:10] before day one
[1:08:12] that's right
[1:08:13] yeah
[1:08:13] after a while we're gonna see a little
[1:08:15] sacred light begin to form yeah like a
[1:08:17] little halo or something yeah
[1:08:20] you can only see it by spiritual eyes to
[1:08:22] look now
[1:08:24] he said we're standing on the great big
[1:08:26] banister
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:29] so before day one
[1:08:32] there's that filler of fire sure there's
[1:08:34] that halo right
[1:08:38] this and then
[1:08:39] this pillar of fire makes everything
[1:08:41] this is the sun
[1:08:43] therefore you cannot have life time or
[1:08:45] days without first having the sun
[1:08:48] so this is a spiritual light and this
[1:08:50] made the natural sunlight
[1:08:54] see no one has seen god next by
[1:08:56] spiritual looking we see a little white
[1:08:58] light forming out there what is it it's
[1:09:00] called the logos the anointing the
[1:09:02] anointing
[1:09:03] the part of god began to develop into
[1:09:05] something so human beings could have
[1:09:06] some type of idea what it was it was a
[1:09:09] little light moving that was the word of
[1:09:11] god hey man
[1:09:13] so that little light has a lot of
[1:09:15] different names
[1:09:17] everybody say five names
[1:09:22] actually there might be six here yeah
[1:09:23] logos word
[1:09:24] anointing theophany of god son of god a
[1:09:28] visible form of the holy spirit sorry
[1:09:29] six names
[1:09:31] you could really call logos though the
[1:09:33] word because that's what the word logos
[1:09:34] means word a word utterly right
[1:09:36] so at least five names is going to be
[1:09:38] technical
[1:09:40] it's all the same thing
[1:09:42] yeah the beginning was the anointing
[1:09:44] lord
[1:09:45] and the anointing was with god
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:53] thank you jesus
[1:09:56] i love what the program says god gave
[1:09:58] himself
[1:09:59] birth to this
[1:10:05] god gives himself birth
[1:10:07] to this
[1:10:09] god births his own son
[1:10:12] why
[1:10:13] because god is both feminine and
[1:10:15] especially
[1:10:16] yeah
[1:10:17] right because again when god made an
[1:10:19] image of himself he made
[1:10:21] adam both male and female yeah god has
[1:10:24] masculine parts that's right got his
[1:10:26] feminine parts
[1:10:28] yeah right god can help himself can he
[1:10:29] not
[1:10:30] right god can be submissive can he not
[1:10:32] yeah he let's say do all this stuff on
[1:10:34] the earth right he's very personal
[1:10:37] of course he doesn't let it happen
[1:10:38] without his consent
[1:10:40] but he still lets it happen
[1:10:44] this is where jesus talked about
[1:10:45] glorifying me with the glory we had amen
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:50] that light that logos light had glory
[1:10:53] with the invisible god inside of them
[1:10:55] amen hallelujah amen that's right the
[1:10:59] bible jesus said father you love me
[1:11:02] for the foundation of the world that's
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:05] father and son were there before the
[1:11:07] foundation of the world amen member
[1:11:10] church he made you and loved you he
[1:11:12] loved you so he could use you
[1:11:14] very man
[1:11:16] you're made for his purpose that's right
[1:11:23] so before day one
[1:11:25] it was already there
[1:11:26] yeah
[1:11:27] we already had the logos the logos the
[1:11:30] great light made this lesser light
[1:11:32] yeah then the logos made heavens to
[1:11:35] divide the waters
[1:11:37] and the logos made the land sea plant
[1:11:39] life all made by jesus
[1:11:41] all right
[1:11:43] day four sun moon stars not like the sun
[1:11:46] the sun wasn't even there
[1:11:48] we're gonna look at that just a moment
[1:11:50] it's good day five jesus made the water
[1:11:53] animals and the birds
[1:11:55] and then on day six he finally made us
[1:11:58] the height of his creation
[1:12:00] is that right
[1:12:01] the height of it i listened to a
[1:12:03] preacher the other day and he said when
[1:12:04] the eyeballs are actually formed in the
[1:12:06] in the womb there's 100 million there's
[1:12:09] i'm sorry there's a million nerves
[1:12:12] on one side of the eye and there's and
[1:12:14] then there's a million on the other side
[1:12:17] and i think this is in the first month
[1:12:18] of
[1:12:20] a month after conception in the womb
[1:12:23] or maybe it's like two months i
[1:12:24] don't quote me on that
[1:12:26] i don't know
[1:12:27] anyways there's a million nerves and
[1:12:29] they each have an opposite pair they
[1:12:31] have to connect with in order for the
[1:12:33] eye to work the eye is the most complex
[1:12:36] body part in the entire universe yeah
[1:12:38] the eye
[1:12:40] but that's why the bible says the lord
[1:12:41] form the eye
[1:12:44] hallelujah
[1:12:45] amen
[1:12:47] and by some miraculous way
[1:12:50] some intelligence
[1:12:52] hallelujah
[1:12:54] jesus made you church
[1:12:56] amen by jesus intelligence all million
[1:13:00] of those can find their matching pair in
[1:13:03] order so that you don't see bad you see
[1:13:05] light you see perfect you see color you
[1:13:08] see clear a million different opposites
[1:13:11] all interweave together find the right
[1:13:13] match and they all do it so you can see
[1:13:15] lightning
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:27] blessed be the lord hallelujah
[1:13:30] all his wisdom
[1:13:32] amen what he made you
[1:13:34] for his sake
[1:13:37] he made you for a purpose
[1:13:40] sure
[1:13:42] sure he did i'm gonna skip past this
[1:13:44] i preached those before
[1:13:46] so i'm going to close to this
[1:13:52] all things were created by him
[1:13:54] amen and for him amen
[1:14:10] the bible said by the word of the lord
[1:14:12] were the heavens made
[1:14:15] and all the host of them by the breath
[1:14:19] of his mouth
[1:14:20] what wait what
[1:14:25] every star every planet
[1:14:29] earth water air oxygen
[1:14:32] bees
[1:14:34] turtles doves lambs
[1:14:37] americans
[1:14:39] africans europeans
[1:14:42] all made by what the breath of god just
[1:14:45] the breath all right
[1:14:47] what does your breath do
[1:14:50] i mean i'm sure it does something but
[1:14:52] his breath
[1:14:53] made all the entire universe even just
[1:14:56] his breath amen
[1:14:59] that's why the bible says if he want to
[1:15:01] come down brother william he could melt
[1:15:03] the mountains with his presence if he
[1:15:05] wanted to
[1:15:06] because his breath breathed out the sun
[1:15:08] brother
[1:15:11] what was it 100
[1:15:13] it was 10 000 degrees fahrenheit on the
[1:15:15] surface of the sun
[1:15:18] that just came out of his mouth now our
[1:15:19] breath gets pretty hot you know
[1:15:21] but god is so hot he can breathe out a
[1:15:24] sun

[1:16:37] but he also wanted me to watch this
[1:16:38] video

[1:17:01] the planets and the stars real quick
[1:17:03] okay there's mercury the smallest of the
[1:17:05] ones in our galaxy
[1:17:07] now remember church the bible said he
[1:17:08] what he breathed these out of his mouth
[1:17:11] mercury
[1:17:14] then he goes and we'll get later he's
[1:17:15] going to go venus
[1:17:18] earth
[1:17:20] you just all come out of his mouth
[1:17:24] put your head out front and just go like
[1:17:26] just blow on your hand
[1:17:27] that's what god did he made his son
[1:17:30] what does yours do
[1:17:33] nothing
[1:17:34] actually does give carbon dioxide to the
[1:17:36] plants if we want to be tempted
[1:17:38] that's about all does or torments people
[1:17:40] with our bad breath
[1:17:42] but not god when god's breath goes out
[1:17:45] it creates silence holidays
[1:17:47] we say like this it also creates sons
[1:17:49] and daughters amen and great sons and
[1:17:52] daughters who love jesus christ and the
[1:17:54] kingdom of life
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:57] that's hallelujah
[1:17:58] jesus went and breathed on him he said
[1:18:00] receive you the holy ghost receive you
[1:18:02] the holy ghost receive you the holy
[1:18:04] ghost he breathes on us the same breath
[1:18:07] that breathed out
[1:18:08] and and fire would breathe out spiritual
[1:18:10] fire amen
[1:18:12] fill them with the holy ghost of the day
[1:18:14] of pentecost amen hallelujah glory
[1:18:18] hallelujah let's see how big let's see
[1:18:20] how big we are let's see how small we
[1:18:21] are
[1:18:24] you gonna play here
[1:18:27] sorry i didn't mean to rewind that
[1:18:29] i was better with this
[1:18:31] i fast forward
[1:18:32] now this guy's a nice guy but i liked
[1:18:34] him for a while but then he went and
[1:18:36] kissed the pope's ring and you can watch
[1:18:38] it on youtube you know okay there that
[1:18:41] mercury so god breathed out mars
[1:18:44] then he breathed out venus
[1:18:47] he probably did it all at one time
[1:18:49] actually
[1:18:50] then he there they breathe out us
[1:18:53] now look we're bigger than those three
[1:18:55] but now look here
[1:18:58] god brings out neptune
[1:19:02] then he breathes out saturn
[1:19:05] then he breathes out
[1:19:20] now really
[1:19:21] you can see earth there but in real life
[1:19:23] you wouldn't be able to say see earth
[1:19:25] did you know
[1:19:26] almost a million earths fit inside one
[1:19:30] sun
[1:19:31] there's like 900 000 some earths can fit
[1:19:34] into one side and god did all this by
[1:19:36] going
[1:19:40] and that's the god that made you for his
[1:19:43] purpose
[1:19:45] because it is love for you amen
[1:19:48] god loves
[1:20:01] amen it's the god we serve yeah so great
[1:20:05] all right
[1:20:10] lori
[1:20:11] a million first
[1:20:13] get fit inside
[1:20:17] now who's the big guy who's the greatest
[1:20:18] of all time
[1:20:25] who even cares who the greatest of all
[1:20:27] time is at this point
[1:20:29] the greatest of all time on the earth is
[1:20:31] so tidy compared to one son
[1:20:34] and god has trillions come on now
[1:20:37] trillions of sons that's why the bible
[1:20:39] says god will not share his glory with
[1:20:41] anybody
[1:20:44] hallelujah
[1:20:46] just trying to keep us humble
[1:20:48] trying to stay humble
[1:20:50] hallelujah
[1:20:53] now even bigger than the sun so a
[1:20:54] millionaire spit in here

[1:21:22] universe we're hardly even in the
[1:21:24] picture i'll tell you like this you're
[1:21:26] still in the mind of god amen glory
[1:21:28] in this great big creation god never
[1:21:31] forget about you praise god you only put
[1:21:33] life on one little planet and that's
[1:21:36] where he said he was chosen you in him
[1:21:38] before the foundation of the
[1:21:40] world hallelujah
[1:21:42] when all these were breathing out
[1:21:45] he said there's going to be a bride in

[1:22:47] okay that's the end
[1:23:00] let's get back to that scripture
[1:23:02] let's read that again now a little more
[1:23:04] understanding of how great god is
[1:23:07] did anybody see earth anymore by that
[1:23:08] last name when you see earth anywhere
[1:23:10] we are so small yeah
[1:23:13] we're so tiny
[1:23:15] insignificant of what we think yeah
[1:23:18] but god loved us so much he sent a
[1:23:20] rescue before amen
[1:23:24] he loved us so much he said i'm going to
[1:23:26] rescue them with my son hallelujah thank
[1:23:29] you jesus i'm going to send a rescuer to
[1:23:31] that player
[1:23:32] of

[1:23:36] to rescue my people amen amen
[1:23:39] said thank you by god's foreknowledge he
[1:23:42] knew you'd love him
[1:23:44] and because he knew you'd love him he
[1:23:46] made a probituation for you he made a
[1:23:49] payment to pay for your sins hallelujah
[1:23:52] amen glory
[1:23:54] i love that quote
[1:23:55] praise god hallelujah and all the host
[1:23:58] of them were
[1:24:00] by the breath of his mouth
[1:24:03] let there be a venus earth
[1:24:06] who did that jesus
[1:24:09] the god we're singing to tonight church
[1:24:11] amen god we're trying to we're trying to
[1:24:14] understand colossians his bible tonight
[1:24:18] god breathed all that out
[1:24:20] bless the lord bless his holy name
[1:24:22] beetlejuice hallelujah
[1:24:26] canis majoris the biggest one the
[1:24:27] scientists abound so far
[1:24:30] and we are not even like a
[1:24:32] tip of a little pen
[1:24:34] clothespin
[1:24:35] compared to that one
[1:24:38] and yet god
[1:24:39] sent his word to you
[1:24:42] it's beautiful yes
[1:24:44] at church he heals the broken in heart
[1:24:47] he bindeth up their wounds yes he does
[1:24:49] he tells the number of the stars
[1:24:52] scientists can't even count the number
[1:24:53] right now
[1:24:55] sure and he calls them all by names
[1:24:58] you know we have eight kids sometimes it
[1:25:00] was hard to find out a name
[1:25:02] i was running out of names
[1:25:05] this one's been used that one's been
[1:25:06] used
[1:25:08] sometimes we were really nervous
[1:25:10] but god never runs out of names amen
[1:25:14] great is our lord and greatest power his
[1:25:16] understanding is infinite now church if
[1:25:18] god can create innumerable numbers of
[1:25:20] stars he can certainly heal us of our
[1:25:22] finite little natural problems or
[1:25:24] spiritual problems
[1:25:27] that's the kind the context is he heals
[1:25:30] everything because he can number he
[1:25:32] names all the stars
[1:25:35] if he can handle all the stars names he
[1:25:37] can handle your your trouble
[1:25:42] thus saith the lord
[1:25:45] he said i said lord i was giving up i've
[1:25:47] made the earth
[1:25:48] and i created man upon it yeah i even my
[1:25:52] hands have stretched out the heavens
[1:25:54] yeah
[1:25:56] so you stretch them out and say
[1:25:59] let there be a beetle juice
[1:26:02] let there be a sun
[1:26:04] he stretched out all that
[1:26:06] stuff and all their hosts i have
[1:26:09] commanded you stay in that milky way
[1:26:10] galaxy you stay in that galaxy you stay
[1:26:13] there moon you stay right there by the
[1:26:14] earth you just rotate around the earth
[1:26:16] you just stay right there god did all
[1:26:18] that
[1:26:19] jesus did all that
[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:23] scientists estimate there's 10 trillion
[1:26:25] galaxies
[1:26:28] we're in the milky way galaxy we have
[1:26:30] about 10 billion stars they estimate
[1:26:32] that's a low estimate
[1:26:34] so if you multiply 10 trillion by 10
[1:26:36] million you get
[1:26:38] amen amen
[1:26:39] and god begins stretching it out
[1:26:42] this huge universe
[1:26:45] and here's our little
[1:26:47] solar system within the milky way
[1:26:48] there's all these galaxies
[1:26:52] this is our galaxy
[1:26:53] and there's our sun and we're right
[1:26:56] we're right in that little group right
[1:26:57] there this is just one galaxy
[1:27:01] all things were created by him and
[1:27:07] we're gonna make that the merry verse
[1:27:08] next week
[1:27:12] not just one
[1:27:14] there's all these other groups of stars
[1:27:17] sons
[1:27:18] beetlejuices
[1:27:20] they're massive amen
[1:27:23] and then here's just a small portion of
[1:27:25] the entire universe where's
[1:27:27] our galaxy
[1:27:29] that one i just showed you this galaxy
[1:27:32] this whole thing
[1:27:33] is right there that little white dot and
[1:27:36] look at all these other
[1:27:38] trillions of galaxies
[1:27:42] how great is our god
[1:27:47] the church remember god has a great
[1:27:48] number of thoughts about you i know
[1:27:50] sometimes it doesn't seem like it the
[1:27:51] devil likes to wear us out you know with
[1:27:53] waiting
[1:27:55] remember we got access to all patients
[1:27:58] hallelujah he likes to make us weak but
[1:28:00] remember we got access to all strength
[1:28:04] the god that formed all that
[1:28:06] you think the guy that formed all those

[1:28:18] that maybe well i'm not trying to
[1:28:19] encourage lydia tonight
[1:28:21] maybe i can do that
[1:28:23] of course he can
[1:28:25] he breathed and stars came out amen of
[1:28:28] course he can encourage us
[1:28:30] of course he can strengthen us of course
[1:28:32] he can immediately that's what he lives
[1:28:33] for he has our lives to make an
[1:28:35] intercession for the saints amen
[1:28:38] glory to god

[1:29:08] then there was four then there was eight
[1:29:10] and there's 16 and 32
[1:29:13] and now church every three seconds you

[1:29:32] every day without you asking for it and
[1:29:35] without you figuring it out
[1:29:42] blessed be his holy name and yet in
[1:29:45] god's book all my members were written
[1:29:48] in continuance were fashioned when as
[1:29:50] yet there was none of them yeah
[1:29:53] yeah
[1:29:55] so everything was already written about
[1:29:57] me before it even came up
[1:29:59] yeah it happened
[1:30:01] so god knew about me being raised in a
[1:30:03] poor family
[1:30:04] living in ohio my parents were divorced
[1:30:07] he knew i'd be five foot eleven three
[1:30:09] quarters he knew that
[1:30:11] he knew i'd have a son that i said lord
[1:30:12] give me something that looks just like
[1:30:13] me lord please give me something my own
[1:30:15] image he gave me one
[1:30:18] he knew everything about my life i'd be
[1:30:20] a pastor i'd be a school teacher
[1:30:22] yeah he knew every it was already
[1:30:24] written in this book
[1:30:26] because he's got everything under
[1:30:27] control
[1:30:29] he created all things
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] by him
[1:30:33] and for him amen he's got a job for you

[1:30:58] all right did you know you can take
[1:31:01] the dna from all your cells
[1:31:03] and if you typed it out you could
[1:31:04] stretch it to the moon and back i think
[1:31:06] it's 700 000 times
[1:31:08] just the dna code in your cells in your
[1:31:10] body
[1:31:11] just in your body if you can type out
[1:31:13] all and there's only four there's only
[1:31:15] four characters
[1:31:17] if you typed all those on a piece of
[1:31:19] paper and put them in one line that
[1:31:20] would go back up to the moon seven
[1:31:22] hundred thousand times
[1:31:24] that's how much information is in your
[1:31:25] body naturally
[1:31:27] but in heaven
[1:31:29] god's got a book with all your members
[1:31:31] in it i'm already when they turn 10 it's
[1:31:33] going to happen when they turn 20 that's
[1:31:35] going to happen when you turn 30 when
[1:31:36] you turn 40 lord willing i got turned
[1:31:39] 50. when you turn 50 then it's going to
[1:31:40] happen lord
[1:31:42] turn
[1:31:49] and we can praise god because the bible
[1:31:52] says how precious are your thoughts unto
[1:31:54] me how great is the son of
[1:31:57] amen
[1:31:59] if his stars are so great and their
[1:32:01] names are so great how great are his
[1:32:03] thoughts about you
[1:32:06] when the stars can't even be redeemed
[1:32:08] the stars can't repent they can't sin
[1:32:10] they can't i mean they're going to
[1:32:11] praise god just because but they don't
[1:32:12] have a soul
[1:32:16] how important are we to god
[1:32:19] the only planet of all those stars the
[1:32:21] only place where there's life is that
[1:32:23] one little
[1:32:24] that one tiny one that fits in a million
[1:32:26] of the other one and that one probably
[1:32:27] is like a million of the other big wood
[1:32:32] if i should count all god's thoughts
[1:32:34] about lydia
[1:32:36] they are more number than the sand
[1:32:40] when i awake
[1:32:42] i am still with me

[1:33:03] galaxies out there
