everybody in the name of the lord jesus christ we appreciate your love and your prayers and the fellowship of the saints praise god matthew 13 verse 30. now why this types here we see a unity right we see the gathering of the wheat into the barn so this is what we see we see when david takes mount zion he has all israel gathered unto him remember that word jebus also means threshing floor the place where wheat is gathered praise god so it's a beautiful type and we're so thankful that god has revealed it to us praise god so let's read this scripture together and then we'll do the memory verse and have you be seated here matthew 13 verse 30 let's read that on three one two three let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn praise god philippians chapter 4 i believe let's go there verse 2 philippians 4 verse 2. i'm sorry philippians 2 rather verse 2 philippians chapter two sorry verse two philippians two verse two what a beautiful memory verse here let's remember uh this last part help us to esteem others better than ourselves help us to serve others put others first may god help us to grow in that how we want to grow in that i think that's just a beautiful uh we'd say outlook on our lives that we would look to other people's needs better than our own philippians two verses two and three let's begin on three one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves may god add his blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated and god bless you saints so let's look to the lord here as we take a thought one more time i do have some slides here we can share uh by the grace of god just trusting the holy spirit to kind of place this together i've got numerous thoughts you know and there's always the the build-up and you want to just say what the lord would have you to say but again as i just said there briefly mount moriah of course this was the place where the jebusites had held it for 403 years and uh g boost means threshing floor so this was the threshing floor this was the place where the chaff was separated from the wheat this was the gathering place of the wheat in other words praise god like even during the time of uh in the time of the the bible times that was a called a threshing floor praise god and we can see it's the gathering together of god's wheat so we'll look to those thoughts and trust it'll be a help to you today i think maybe this might be the final service on this thought but there might be another one we'll see by the grace of god then i want to get back to the 12 sons of jacob and their prophesied inheritances and so forth because that's been such a great blessing to us as well so we read our text here uh now we just reviewed from last sunday and wednesday you remember zion has at least five applications to it it can apply to that individual mountain or both mountains or the entire uh nation of israel so it has numerous applications then we see the spiritual application the new testament it speaks of heaven's covenant under the new covenant praise god and it's a kingdom that should not be refused praise god we shouldn't turn this voice down that we hear speaking from heaven praise god and remember zion in jerusalem is the city of the great king amen this is god city hallelujah god chose that city uh jerusalem to be his city of all the places on the earth think about that he could have chose akron right he could have chosen jeffersonville he could have chosen a lot of different places amen he could have chose tucson arizona he could have chosen a lot of places but he chose jerusalem he said that's my city that's my home that will be my earthly dwelling place praise god i have a heavenly dwelling place but i'm going to bring heaven down to earth and i'm choosing jerusalem praise god the teaching of peace praise god the city of peace amen and we saw wednesday night wednesday night we looked at melchizedek a little bit and uh we showed how that was his beginning place in other words abraham realized wow the king of the whole earth the the priest of the whole earth lives in salem not far from him amen hallelujah and that that priest brought forth bread and wine unto him because he trusted in the priest he trusted in the god of the priest amen which was god almighty praise god hallelujah and then shortly you know shortly thereafter isaac and jehovah jireh that mountain that home of of melchizedek became the place where god met abraham and stopped him from slaying his own son as a test to see if he would love god and obey god no matter the cost amen and when he passed that test he said now in a bless you manifold amen i bless you more and more with many more sons and and a long life praise god and he was blessed and god god saw that abraham was going to serve god with all of his heart soul mind and strength amen and then remember church we fast forward you know of course uh 400 years i'm sorry more than that rather fast forward numerous hundreds of years to joshua joshua destroys the king of jerusalem but he never drives out the inhabitants of jerusalem they're able to live behind their their their tent the history says 10 foot high walls and it just seemed impossible uh as we'll see later in this was jerusalem was actually in the land of benjamin it was on the border of judah and benjamin and so the benjamites were never able to take it the sons of judah were never never able to conquer this god was saving it for a special time for a special place to give a sign for his people of what was to come amen hallelujah he finally took it some 403 years later in joshua's time because david made the impossible possible praise god because david was a type of jesus christ praise god now let me go back there from wednesday most of you didn't see this because we got our brothers working second shift and i just want to show this from wednesday every 2000 years remember god does something major right noah's flood the messiah's blood and then he come in the form of the son of man to the gentiles because he never did that before he did the samaritans and the jews but he never did it until our day praise god when he sent brother branham with the spirit of elijah amen to finish the mystery of god now uh okay so here's what i was trying to get to yeah is that right is that did i skip one no that's right one okay so i just want to show this with you both melchizedek and david foreshadowed christ's priesthood so after god destroyed all man he said i'm starting all over and i'm starting with abraham amen a man of faith hallelujah a former idolater i'm going to call him because i know he has a heart that will believe me even though he'd lie sometimes and the church said god said that's my friend even though he had a little bad habit of lying and he was the little coward at times and threw his wife under the bus is that right church that's before the baptism of the holy ghost now so brother that's no excuse for us but in other words we're all going to have shortcomings but but i love what what abraham knew abraham i'm not saved by my works i'm saved by faith abraham how that works the bible paul said when was abraham justified was it before the circumcision or after it was before amen hallelujah as soon as abraham believed god the bible said god did not impute sin unto him amen right he'd have to live with the consequences of his mistakes but god would not impute that to him in other words in god's eyes abraham's always my friend he's eternally my friend i knew him before the foundation of the world and i'm going to be with him i'll never forsake him i redeem him from his mistakes amen i'll help him to overcome his lying amen i'll help him to overcome his cowardice and i'll strengthen him with faith hallelujah so god said i'm starting all over with abraham amen and i'm going to bless the whole world through abraham so he sent abraham a a sign that there is coming a priest who is both king of the world and priest of heaven amen and abraham met him face to face hallelujah and that was foreshadowing what god was going to do through jesus christ amen so look this is four thousand years so two thousand plus two thousand four thousand so four thousand years ago god sent melches down to earth right that was god came down to earth rather right in melchizedek's flesh and he foreshadowed and he foretold the seed of abraham that one day four thousand years about in the future i will live on this earth god will come down and live on this earth and the entire earth will be filled with the knowledge of god the bible said the whole earth shall be filled with his glory amen and all nations shall come into jerusalem during the millennium and give god praise amen and learn the word of god the whole earth will learn and then finally there will be a son of david amen there'll be a son of david there'll be a king and priest on the earth to establish the bible says everlasting righteousness amen hallelujah in other words abraham the world you're longing for is going to come out of your loins amen the world you really desire to live in it's down the road it's about 4 000 years in the future but there's coming melchizedek he's going to change his mask hallelujah and he'll come in 4 000 years and the whole world you'll sit next next to him but the whole world will be ruled by him and it'll be a reign of righteousness amen hallelujah god foreshadowed to abraham and his seed that there's coming a king and priest who will rule this world in righteousness where there's no more liars as presidents right there's no more murderers as presidents right or a prime minister or whatever they name they want to give themselves right flattering titles that they give themselves there's going to be no more of that but there'll be a god who's ruling and reigning who established unending righteousness hallelujah now about a thousand years after that that's what we're looking at where david he caught this sense again god was a thousand years later god was kind of giving another reminder praise god that was more it was even closer to it because now it's not god now it's a man hallelujah yeah he's a sinful man but god used david to take up and not to take up both offices he was both a king and a priest but he was not of the order of aaron praise god hallelujah he was of the tribe of judah amen hallelujah a kingdom priest and that's what the bible said david said let us bring up the ark so we can minister to god in the presence of god in other words we want to live and minister in the presence of god and god said i'm going to make david a sign praise god that 3 000 years in the future a man's going to come who overcomes every sin amen this man is not going to fall to bathsheba right this man is not going to fall to other murders and other mistakes and numbering the people this he's going to be a man but he's not going to fall and he's going to bring in everlasting righteousness amen so david was a sign of that and then a thousand years after that then god came in christ hallelujah and satan offered him this kingdom he offered him the world early before his death he tried to deceive and said you can have the world if you just bow down and worship me and jesus said it is written thou shalt not worship the devil right thou shall worship the lord thy god only amen hallelujah and he served he wasn't an earthly king yet right he was just he was a prophet praise god he was a sacrifice he was a son of david praise god as a prophet as a man and everybody and pilate and all those guys thought oh he's trying to rule the world or i'm sorry herod thought he was going to rule the world so he killed all those babies but he didn't realize it wasn't yet the time in other words man thinks they know the times man doesn't know the time unless god lets them know thank god god has let us know that it's about the time and season of the rapture amen thank god hallelujah by showing us the signs in the scripture thank god as it was the days of noah as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man thank god we can see hallelujah that it's the coming of the lord praise god that evil seducers will wax worse and worse but the holy ghost will guide us more and more into truth amen hallelujah that's the day in the hour amen and we're seeing the seed gather to the word we're seeing christ gather a seed together in little groups in akron and little groups in iowa praise god and little groups in pennsylvania and napoleon praise god there's little groups all over little groups so we being gathered together being ready for the rapture amen hallelujah so since christ we've been in 2000 years of a spiritual priesthood hallelujah so jesus christ the bible said he's the king of saints how many remember that from revelation 15. the bible said we praise him o king of saints so he's a spiritual king now and he's a spiritual priest for us he's not on the earth right but he's established a spiritual priesthood and it's it's it's it's been exactly what the believers have needed for 2000 years hallelujah it was good like it's that old time religion song right it was good for paul and silas as they were in the prison praise god it was good for william tyndale as he was burning at the stake amen hallelujah it was good for brother branham after a car accident and dying praise god it was good enough for him praise god and it's good enough for me give me that old-time religion give me that order a melchizedek priesthood give me that priesthood with jesus that jesus can be touched by the feeling of my infirmities he can minister to my needs and he can go to the father with my requests amen he can take your request to the father because he's the high priest right now praise god and he can meet your need and the bible said he'll give you every benefit amen hallelujah for two thousand years he's given them all the things they needed amen everything the believers needed he's provided by his hand of mercy amen now let me skip ahead here so in other words church and then i showed another thing so you had a melchizedek priest that lasted from abraham to moses and then you had the aaronic priesthood that lasted about 1500 years right so you know about 2 000 years of melchizedek aaron and then now we got to the spiritual priesthood of the lord jesus christ does that help by god's grace we brother said i showed on wednesday we are under the the priesthood of jesus christ which is after the order of melchizedek amen in other words when you get the victory god's going to come around and want to bless you amen hallelujah in other words god's going to empower you to get the victory praise god and then when you get the victory you give him all the praise amen hallelujah you'll pay your tithes and offerings you'll be a faithful member high praise we're under the priesthood of jesus christ who's likened unto melchizedek now let's get to the let's get to where we're going to be that's just a quick review now here's a picture this is kind of like a picture of the jebusites of how they had mount moriah all defended now the the upper part of mount moriah now this of course would have been when solomon had uh built his temple so imagine before salman built the temple this was all jebusite territory praise god and so david of course remember he came to here and the bible said they were mocking him at the top can you imagine mocking a man who defeated those giants he defeated goliath this is a man he wasn't no but they sit up there on the top of the walls and mocked him and said the paralyzer or the lame and the blind could defend this city it's so strong and david didn't back down he didn't he didn't get discouraged when they made fun of him he got encouraged he didn't get weaker church he got stronger praise god when the devil taunts you you just take the word of god and you go forward and you don't back down you just wait for the wisdom of god and god will give you the victory praise god he didn't back down he didn't say well i guess i'm going to go back to hebron now i don't really need to get this victory no he need he knew he needed to fulfill the plan of god for his life part of the will of god for his life was to serve as a high priest and as a king unto god for the people so in other words there's nothing the devil could do to stop this praise god david was going to conquer he didn't know how it's going to be done until god showed it to him but once god showed it to him there was nothing that could stop david he was going to overcome it was an impossible enemy the bible said they thought they were invincible but nothing's invincible if god's on your side hallelujah how many got god on your side remember with god nothing shall be impossible amen hallelujah with god nothing shall be impossible so david got the revelation he said which one are you men whoever goes up to the the water conduit whoever goes to the gutter first he's the chief of my soldiers in other words david said he you know remember he came from the south he came down this way because hebron was south he came up with all the soldiers he said go by the waterway go by the gihon spring and you've got to crawl uh so remember he taking jerusalem was his first act after becoming king of all the 12 tribes the very first thing he does once he gets unity with all the tribes he said the first thing i'm doing i'm going up to jerusalem see he had a burn in him i've got to go there i've got to conquer this i've got types and shadows i've got to fulfill praise god i've got a burden i've got a desire the whole nation's behind me i've got a heart after god's heart amen amen i need to unite this people this was a divided tri i'm sorry divided country they were divided remember david was the only king uh he was only the king of judah before ishmael sheth had the other 11 tribes but then he finally died and all the men came to david and hebron and said we know the prophet called you to be king praise god hallelujah one prophet will never contradict another hallelujah but see as believers we must wait on the timing of god and that's why we're here today we're waiting on the time of god for the rapture and while we're waiting for that we're waiting for other blessings too praise god we're waiting for other promises our loved ones save right we're waiting for family and all these things we're waiting for the promises of god and we know that god's spirit just like god brought unity amen just like god brought unity to israel god's going to bring unity to the bride amen it won't be anything we have to do we just have to fall more in love with jesus because he said you'll know by disciples because of their love one for another amen so as we fall in love with jesus we'll naturally fall in love with god's people the very first act he did was go up to jerusalem we'll look at that in a little bit here remember david took the city through joab's courage to act upon his plan to enter through the water conduit or the gutter and remember i showed five reasons on wednesday why david taking zion represents the rapture so in other words joab he first had to conquer this first hill he had to overcome and get in that the gihon spring here and he had to crawl up through here and then climb up and they had to do a they had to get the victory from the inside out it wasn't going to be the normal type of victory this was going to be a secret attack praise god it was going to be a victory through the knowledge of god given to david praise god it'd be have to be a a brave man who could trust the word of the lord remember this was thought impossible they thought it was impossible for this city to fall but with god nothing shall be impossible amen with the high priest with the king if the king's on our side no one can stand before us amen because we've got the authority we've got the power of the king praise god that that david is anointed he's got the anointing of god amen and if david gives me a promise i'm going to keep that word i'm going to fulfill that word and watch that word move in my life that's what george said praise god i've got the word of the king the king's anointed and so i'm taking his anointed word and i'm going to possess the gates of my enemies history said he climbed through there and then he opened the gates and then israel come in and just ravish the city because they were complacent they thought after 400 years oh nobody's going to touch us they just put the blind the lame up there watching on the walls but god had a way to overcome look at that church the the complacent always get overtaken right like the lukewarm they get spewed out of the mouth of god that's why we can't remain lukewarm we've got to be hot for jesus amen all the time hot for jesus a lot of great lessons in here and after david gets in now of course this is the days of solomon because again you have the temple in david's day they didn't have a temple up there historians just they they make it sound like there was just a place of sacrifice up there it was just a mountaintop and they had sacrifices there but remember david wanted to build remember the prophet came and said david do what's ever in your heart and david said praise the lord i'm going to build the house of god and the prophet went home and the holy spirit said no go tell my servant david you've been a bloody man you'll not build it he said but your son will be able to praise god don't you like that church sometimes we utter things we don't even know what we're saying but aren't you glad god is faithful to correct our unthinking of our words amen our own human leading if we're sensitive to the holy spirit he'll give us the right word and we'll have to go back and say oh i'm sorry let me correct that i spoke a little too soon here's what the bible said to me that's a real prophet amen a prophet can say something wrong but then come back and fix it that's how we should be praise god we need god's help we need to be corrected and god will correct us amen hallelujah you know the story as soon as he took it the bible said as soon as david took this city he built his own city he started tearing down buildings he started building up his i think he spent what seven years building his house and he built the city of david now here's this is actually the actual mount zion over here so this was the mount moriah so he builds his own city and they called it the city of david because his leadership helped conquer the city and that something the city of david david conquers it so they name that after david praise god hallelujah that's beautiful he was the one that knew they could take the land and they did it's a beautiful type now i want to see here look what matthew henry said now the very first exploit david did after he was anointed king over all israel was to gain jerusalem out of the hand of the jebusites which because it belonged to benjamin listen he could not well attempt till that tribe which had long adhered to saul's house submitted to him so for seven and a half years brother he was down in judah and he he knew jerusalem belonged to the people of god but he couldn't take it because that wasn't his land isn't that interesting in other words david was a man of respect he respected someone else's land he knew that was the benjamite's land in other words well for seven half years i'll wait for the benjamites to do it if they don't do it wait till i get leadership over the whole nation because once i'm king over everybody then i can go take it i don't in other words i don't have jurisdiction i don't have authority over benjamin because i'm not king over the benjaminites yet amen so david wade at church he waited for seven and a half years to take the promise of god may god help us amen as we wait upon promises not to get frustrated not to get all mixed up not to toss to and fro but to wait on god's timing and when it's god's time for you to inherit it you will possess it amen seven and a half years he amen have done it because god was with him but he waited on god's timing because he's a man of god that should remind you of something that david didn't take saul's life to become king a little quicker although he could have twice look at the devil typing testing him twice hallelujah the bible said he leaves for a season look at that he knew i'm anointed by samuel why don't i just end his life he's a backslidden king why don't i just get rid of him anyway he's backslidden he's a lukewarm laodicean no he said i'm not going to touch god's anointed amen i'm not going to force my way into doing this i'm not going to through violence possess the kingdom i'm going to let god do it hallelujah so we see look at this pattern in david's life he respects authority hallelujah the bible said the workers of iniquity do not the bible said they speak things against authorities and principalities things they don't even understand to their own shame that's what jude says see let's be careful what we say let's respect god's authority praise god and that means respecting every single person in the church praise god respecting them showing them love praise god and waiting for god's timing even if you know god's going to do something wait upon the timing of god show respect put your faith in god don't try to force it let god do it so just like he respected saul's office he respected the benjamite's land hallelujah in other words gods respects the properties of others now notice he's the creator of all property isn't that something brother he's the owner of heaven and earth yet he let the devil have a home in hell right i mean god god created all but yet he's so kind now he did kick the devil out of heaven that's good and he's going to kick him out one more time praise god at the rapture amen jesus said i saw satan falling down as lightning praise god at the days of the coming of the son of man amen there come a time remember when the bride goes up satan gets kicked out eating up nothing left to accuse so he goes down to anoint the antichrist it hasn't happened yet but it's going to happen praise god see god takes nothing until it's rightfully his even abraham said he said i'm not going to take your cave to bury my wife i'm not going to borrow it i'm going to buy it whatever i possess is going to be rightfully mine amen hallelujah david did the same thing after he numbered the people remember he went up to the threshing floor he went up to moriah and he said let me buy this land from you praise god and he bought it praise god and just like jesus at his three temptations he's not going to be given i'm just i'm not going to accept that as a gift i'm going to go god's provided way i'm going to suffer through the death of the cross praise god i'm going to have my faith set toward calvary i'm going to fulfill god's will and not take something as an easy bribe i'm not going to choose the easy way i'm choosing the hard way amen i'm taking the lord's way with the lord's despised few amen even though we're small in number we're great in victory we're great in revelation we're great in joy hallelujah we've got the saint the lord hallelujah that's exactly right church other churches are just guessing at it they think they know it but we've got the saith the lord hallelujah so we stand by how many can say praise the lord this is god's nature he respects even the devil i heard this preach this is really good remember when david prayed i'm sorry daniel prayed for those 21 days after 21 days the angel came down and said i couldn't get through for 21 days because of the prince of persia check this out church i thought this was a beautiful thought i heard brother donny preach it the prince of persia was a fallen devil but he was still stronger than the devil that came i'm sorry but then the angel that came down to daniel in other words god's let god let angels fall but he still respects their authority isn't that something the same idea here god god will respect satan's authority right he'll allow him to do things in other words the devil will get permission to do things and think i'll do this as long as i can and then you'll try to take our lives but then god will say stop right there you can't take his life hallelujah praise god and the angel said i was waiting 21 days until gabriel came and then gabriel hurt off the prince of persia now you go down there i'm ready to fight him and wrestle with him a little bit because i've got strongest po i can handle this guy i've got power and authority and i can handle him now you go down there and tell god's beloved that he heard his prayer and give him the revelations he needs to fulfill god's will for his life amen hallelujah amen see god always respects your authority and your position always so see god is a man of respect he's a man of honor he sets up the laws in the in the universe and he keeps the laws i think that's a beautiful thought church it's a beautiful thought in other words we're going to need if we're going to need answers for the rapture guess what we're going to need some help from heaven honey we need some strong angels maybe that's why the bible says the voice of the archangel the last trump amen we got the show we need the voice right and then the trump of god praise god thank god we have a strong archangel that will give us the voice of resurrection hallelujah amen praise god because that archangel will have a higher anointing than all the demons of death that are trying to hold down the dead and christ amen hallelujah and the voice of the arcane bible said is the voice of resurrection hallelujah praise god see god just he's got it all set up he knows how to do it he's going to bring it to pass in his time and season let's not be discouraged everything's right on time hallelujah oh thank god church so let me just reiterate that again david couldn't take zion because it belonged to benjamin but then when the three remember i showed you that number three thousand soldiers from benjamin come down and said you know we would have had more but they still love saul but those of us under benjamin we're coming to support you in other words all the uh this means benjamin is now gonna support you and once david had that once he had benjamin's support once he knew he was ruling over benjamin now i'm the king of that land now i can go up in the very first thing he said i'm going to take in the capitol i'm going to go take the city of god if i'm god's king i'm going to go take the king city hallelujah i need a permanent dwelling place now it's mine it's the rightful time and look at it he could not be defeated hallelujah because he was in the plan of god and he had the authority of god he had the purpose of god amen amen he waited till he had all the permissions of god he didn't push the brethren around say well this will be mine eventually i'm doing it right now no he waited on god's timing as a true servant of god church many times god just wants you to let things take their course because time is always hindsight's always 20 20. like why doesn't god take these false preachers out of the way just give it some time god's going to manifest what's in their heart he always does that right all these false movements that start in the 70s and 80s and and the message look at him now brother all their guys are dead all their false prophecies are falling and they're all caught in these sins of money laundering and adultery and child abuse and all these things just give it some time god knows time will solve everything because god has a season for everything god has a season for revelation he has a season to possess the promises he has the season to raise kings up and bring them down praise god the bible said heresies are given so they'll manifest who's on god's side and who's not on god's side that reminds me on the podcast this week i was called a complete heretic because i preached the three works of grace by the believe the sign people i love you guys but you're wrong i sent you a i sent them an email in april it took me four hours to write that email proving the three works of grace i don't hear anything back that's fine that's fine the guys that say they're going to study and things like that that's fine but you didn't study it out and you didn't reply to it that and that's what exactly what paul said the way they call heresy that's how i serve god that's how i serve god you've got to be more than justified you've got to be more than sanctified we need some more sanctification but we need people filled with the holy ghost amen and think of the lie that there's they're telling these people that walk off the street brother that they're smoking cigarettes say now you said the sinner's prayer now you're filled with the fullness of god and they walk out smoking and cussing and watching pornography that's a lie god won't fill that person god's got to sanctify that person jesus prayed said god sanctify peter through thy truth thy word is truth and then he breathes on them say go up there and get the holy ghost amen and i was listening to them call me a heretic the man said the critic of brother branham said this he said show me where the bible ever said someone was saved and not filled with the holy ghost and i sat there and the holy spirit said mary the mother of jesus in luke chapter 1 she said remember when she was pregnant of the holy ghost she said i've rejoiced in god my savior in other words mary's saying i'm already saved i'm saved on the old testament she was already saved but if you go to acts chapter 1 right luke john axe go two books over in acts chapter one the bible said she went up to pentecost and she was praying with a hundred and twenty and then in chapter two the holy ghost came and the bible said they were all including the mother of mary who was already saved fill with the holy ghost amen hallelujah and if the mother of god on this earth has to be filled with the holy ghost what about us amen hallelujah praise god that's why i love the holy spirit who give you the word to say in that hour praise god amen hallelujah and they can lie and they can call name call whatever they want but we've got thus saith the lord and they don't i'll probably make a video they'll probably make a video on me about that but that's okay i love them i'm still waiting on your emails i'm the one waiting now i'm waiting since april that's okay god knows god knows god knows i've offered all these people my books and all these videos and they don't want to study it out the people that say they're this one studying are the ones that don't want to study it you know what that is that's the wrong spirit and i've i've been buying some of their stuff i bought some of theirs i'm studying now i can read theirs but they can't read mine why because they're afraid of the truth i'm not afraid of the truth i've got the spirit of truth i'm born again of truth hallelujah praise god amen i better move on here now the mount zion showdown now that now for years my whole life this confused me until cam came that's how i love the holy spirit he always brings it at the right time why would brother adam call the rapture mount zion brother brahm says so it's at this time in this country that this person will appear speaking of the seven church age messenger or the elijah anointed prophet for it's in the scripture and it's thus saith the lord then the latter rain there will come forth the mount carmel a showdown bible fulfilled to the letter john the baptist his messenger before his face in malachi 3 planted a former reign and was rejected by the churches the denominations the pharisees in his day jesus came and had the mount transfiguration showdown this forerunner of the last days will sow he plants for the latter rain so brother adam planted for the latter rain right he planted seeds of truth amen praise god hallelujah he planted it on those tapes or the books and the tapes and then we just got to listen to it and then it directs us back to where the word of god hallelujah like i got shown in that parable the bible said he found a treasure hitting the field what's the treasure the baptism of the holy ghost paul said you've got treasure in earthen vessels so what's the treasure the holy ghost it was in the field what's the field the bible the prophecy where joel prophesied of it ezekiel prophesied of it he said i'll give you a new heart new spirit my spirit there's the three works of grace it was laying there in the field and we stumbled upon it amen hallelujah praise god brother i am planted those things in the message so we can find them and they're going to grow up in the right time for harvest amen hallelujah praise god all these denominations we visited 12 churches now and they all think they got the holy ghost i'm sad to say they don't but we've got it because it's producing the life of jesus christ amen amen the life the power the divine nature the doctrine all the things of jesus christ it's reproducing it and you and i hallelujah you got to have off you got to have the right doctrine and the right spirit you got to have both i heard so many people say well if i don't have the right doctrine and i at least want the right spirit why can't you have both paul had both paul didn't just have a right spirit he had the truth and he said if anybody thinks they're more spiritual than me let him acknowledge that i'm the prophet and who does the word of god come to a prophet he had the right spirit and the right doctrine that's what we've got hallelujah the holy spirit and the true doctrine of the holy spirit you have to have both jesus said you must worship in spirit and in truth amen dynamics and mechanics we've got the mechanics of the doctrine and the dynamics of the moving supernatural power of the holy ghost not when we want to but when god wants to right i always leave that in there so we don't command god to do things god ain't going to do nothing unless he wants to do it jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds which is his word so in this the last showdown before the rapture is the word versus creeds and that ought to make you happy church hallelujah the last showdown is you want to believe a creed the trinity father son holy ghost right you want to believe that the wafer you want to believe the catholic transubstantiation want to believe that or do you want to be the word oh i love how god makes it so simple oh we can't miss him brother william we can't have you our eyes we are not children of darkness hallelujah we're children of light we can see real well what's going on praise god glory when he comes a showdown the rapture of his bride the first was mount carmel which he put 12 stones back together to restore worship i use that in the book i believe that's a type 12 doctrines right 12 mysteries the second was mount transfiguration this is my beloved son hear him the third will be mount zion glory hallelujah now it finally makes sense remember this i kind of updated it now mount carmel was a physical mountain i'm not sure what the forerunner was but elijah had to show down with baal denominations and god won mount transfiguration was a physical mountain i would also say it was a spiritual showdown with the denominational spirit now this is interesting this was a showdown with denominational spirit within his own ranks right peter peter said let's build three tabernacles here and the father cut him off and said this is my beloved son whom i'm well pleased hear ye him in other words let's stop talking about tabernacles let's talk about you being the tabernacle of god amen let's talk about jesus is the tabernacle of god hallelujah the image of the invisible god let's talk about that peter and then you're going to grow up and you're going to be the stature of a perfect man you're going to be a tabernacle of the living god amen we've had enough temples enough churches enough buildings god don't want a dead building god wants a living building amen god it's a living stone praise god god is a living believer whose spirit can flow through hallelujah so god had to cut him off and said i want a living temple so bill brown said there was a four former reign to the mount transfiguration showdown john the baptist was the former reign rebuking organizations but then the latter reign for that day was jesus overcoming the denominational spirit in peter that's why church would never worry about building a building now if we if god gives us enough we'll know when it's time to build a building we'll have overflow or god will give us such a revelation we'll know when it's time to build but that's why we don't worry about those things that's what peter was worried about let's build a church right and you got to have one right but the same time the showdown was about exalting jesus christ and not thinking earthly or carnally but thinking about what god was doing spiritually so our mount zion we know it's a physical mountain in israel but the one we've come to is the spiritual mountain brother branham planted for the latter rain he planted seeds that would be fruitful in harvest time i don't know after i got the former rain and here comes the latter rain he rebuked the organizations just like john the baptist and now we're waiting for a showdown with those denominations against the word i've got three or four videos of democrats all basically making all evangelical christians devils and calling uh you know uh mothers you know stay-at-home moms and they're just criticizing making them look like they're terrorists when the reality is they're the terrorists right it's coming down it's coming slowly but it's coming surely the bible said they won't be able to buy or sell well we can all sell anything on right we can sell anything on uh craigslist right now that's what benjamin gandy does he sells his services on craigslist i used to buy things and sell things on craigslist but there's coming a time right where they're going to push what you can't even sell on craigslist without the mark and brother brahma said it's thus saith the lord it's the confederation of churches he said you'll belong to a church union or you won't be able to buy or sell it's coming down to the church that you're a part of and thank god we're not so much part of a church denomination yeah our church is registered in columbus but that's just our physical church we're part of a bigger church we're part of a spiritual church we're part of the mount zion church amen the church of the first lord and we're in it by the baptism of the holy ghost amen and they can't shut down that church amen they can't lock the doors of that church because it's the doors of heaven hallelujah and the bible said jesus will open a door in heaven and we'll step up in the rapture hallelujah they can't shut that door hallelujah amen before they lay down the mark jesus will rapture the bride off the earth amen that's exactly right he said i'll keep you from the our temptation that will come upon the entire world because you kept the word of my patience revelation 3 10. oh sorry wrong button so i kind of clean these up a little bit the first reason why does mount zion type the rapture it's a time of total unity all the weed is gathered on the threshing floor glory and the bible says the fivefold ministry is is used by god until we're all in the unity of faith unto a stature of a perfect man amen remember brother adam gave us a quote denominations will break down before the rapture thus saith the lord amongst the bride so this unity in david's time is the same unity as the beginning when joshua's group was unified now look at that outfit omega brother in other words the the omega church must be unified just like the alpha church amen in other words joshua they were totally united praise god but it wasn't their time to take the capital for the king to live on the earth praise god but they were totally united praise god remember aiken was the only one who wasn't but he was kicked out of the church amen hallelujah because he had the wrong garments all right he'd have the wedding garments on hallelujah but the alpha church had total unity and here's the omega church with total unity there's going to be unity in the bride and then jesus says i'm pulling you up to heaven because we're all a family amen hallelujah thank god so it's alpha omega that's why in joel chapter two remember it talks about the the bride the fullness of pentecost will be in there thus saith the lord see it's got to be on the same baptism holy ghost they had we've got to have it too alpha omega number two they defeated the invincible stronghold at a showdown dave was mocked we're gonna be mocked the bible said they're gonna mock us peter said they're gonna mock us where's your god i thought he's coming at the end time right they're gonna mock us too taking the jerusalem stronghold types the holy ghostfield church conquering the last enemy death which has been a stronghold since the church was born because death is going to be swallowed up in victory at the rapture did you catch that jesus is even jesus's resurrection uh with the saints wasn't death swallowed up in victory it's when all the saints praise god all the saints meet jesus in the air and all the dead bodies are raised when the dead in christ rise and all those old dead bodies are restored and we get new bodies then the saying is brought to pass death is swallowed up in victory amen hallelujah when the body when the body of brother brown gets resurrected amen when the body of martin luther and john wesley gets resurrected then death is swallowed up in life hallelujah and we're a part of that by god's grace amen i thought death was invincible not quite because jesus defeated him once and jesus is going to help the rest of us to feed it again amen hallelujah enoch and elijah proved it's defeatable as well hallelujah the stronghold is strong it's kept out many believers from possessing the city of god but the true bride is going to possess the city of god hallelujah number three the king didn't take the city but his wisdom through his servants did jesus christ right is gonna work through us to finish the mystery of god see david himself didn't take it but joab did it by david's wisdom so jesus physical body doesn't defeat the last enemy but jesus spirit and the church defeats the last enemy because the bride has made herself ready through the holy spirit and she's the wise version right she knows the wise things of jesus so she takes what he says gets her lamp ready gets all the extra oil ready and then she goes out to meet him because she's ready for the rapture the king is in the like the king we're going to the procession right the king's not the physical body of the king's not with us but we're going to see him through his wisdom and he's made us ready hallelujah hallelujah thank god number four we also it also ties the rapture because they have the secret to victory david took it through a secret passage the bride has the secret things they belong to us and our children the secret things belong to us david had the secret plus we have the finished mystery of god other churches don't have that thank god there's some people hungry for it amen but they don't have it and then the bible said enter into your prayer your closet and pray give alms in secret do these things in secret and god will reward you openly so it's the secret things that bring us victory praise god and like brother can preach john had to go take the book amen just like job had to go take the city amen and jesus said the violent take the kingdom by force amen in other words we've got to wait till we get the kingdom called praise god right and then we know in the rapture the god will let us know when the rapture comes but we know what to do right now take this book and eat it up praise god enjoy all the revelations say praise the lord feast on this word because you become the word take it and eat it up praise god that's how i tell my children we've got to spend more time reading the bible praise god we enjoy listening to audio and things like that but we got to take the book and eat it up by god's grace hallelujah sorry that's mike let's find my car who's got my keys zion probably took him bless his heart zion bless his heart or maybe it's me i don't know i don't have anything on me thank you lydia good job oh thank you so desire thank you the shot of the king all right number five last one the victory at uh the jebusite stronghold ushered in the physical reign of the king in priest words when david got the victory then he brought the ark or the shekinah glory came into the city of god right after the unity and the defeat of the jebusites so that means church hallelujah after we go in the rapture what's going to happen we're going to live the shekinah glory of christ comes in into us amongst us and are never going to leave us once david got it in there the glory of god was there and he lived in the prince of god right once david got in there now he fulfilled the king and priest type once the rapture goes once we defeat that last enemy death the shekinah glory is forever with us beautiful praise god now remember that's what i'm telling i think i think i said this on wednesday sometimes there's types but they're incomplete types right just like rahab rehab is a type of the rapture but all the events afterwards don't really type the rapture just that one event right because you had a shout and you had a trump i didn't see a voice but you had to shout into trump not sure what the voice is i'm still looking for that one and so because we see a gentile woman saved from total destruction through the token so we see the same thing here we have the final in undefeatable enemy defeated by the the direction of the high kingdom priest amen hallelujah and it brings it brought unity and it brought the prince of god and it was a showdown that was only accomplished through the secret things of god revelation 10 7 amen the mystery of god must be finished and then broadcast to every nation hallelujah see now i see at least two meetings what do you mean about the showdown brother jess well first there's a showdown is the is the bride or is the denomination going to have the born-again experience because remember the bible said when you come to this mountain showdown see that you not refuse the baptism of the holy ghost see go to hebrews 4 1. i wrote this down for a reason go to hebrews 4 1. oh my hebrews 4 1. thank you for your patience here hope it's been a blessing so far praise god hebrews 4 1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it now go down to verse 11. that's what i mentioned on i think last sunday let us therefore i'm sure let us labor therefore to enter in his rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief in other words it you have to work at it at overcoming your flesh if you want the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul you've got to fight against the flesh you've got the labor in your mind and over to in order to overcome the flesh so you can obey the commandments of god and be born again it is a gift but you've got to show god you're going to accept that gift amen i don't know you got to accept the gift amen hallelujah god don't force the gift on you he said very few will find it why don't why don't they find it because they're not looking for it they don't want to live a sanctified life right they don't want the baptism of holy ghost people don't want that so it's a gift but you have to accept it and you have to work your way towards the promised land amen the bible said labor that's what i mean and grace labors paul said i labored more than all of them not me but the grace of god which was with me because works are an expression of faith and faith moves by love so if you love god you'll let the grace of god move through your life work through your life and you will make the promised land i'm bound for the promised land who will come and go with me i'm bound for the promised land amen hallelujah who's willing to labor and overcome their flesh so i can see two showdowns one the showdown of who will be born again it's gonna be the creeds and denominations or it's gonna be jesus bride oh you know it's going to be christ's bride also there's another showdown who will defeat death and denomination right because that's that's the impenetrable enemy see it's a type of david taking the mount zion castle because it was impossible supposedly to defeat the castle but the castle represents a permanent dwelling of the bridegroom and bride so who's going to be the soldiers that really want to see christ and the bride become one who are going to be the warriors because they're going to make this a reality i'm going to live so close to christ that we're going to be one together amen who in other words who's so hungry to live in unity with jesus christ that every day that they'll fight for it amen they'll do the secret things of god in order to have this unity this permanent dwelling place with christ in the rapture oh i hope i hope the holy spirit uh gives you the interpretation i might be chopping it up but may the holy ghost give you the revelation of it in other words it's through the secret things of god that you access the divine presence of god hallelujah thank the lord so let's look at david's acts following the jerusalem victory now we all looked at one here sorry the first thing he did after getting the jerusalem victory so the first thing when he was king he went to jerusalem he won it then the next thing he did was bring the ark in and he wore the ephod it's like an apron-like priest garment and this fulfilled the priesthood requirement of the type of melchizedek he already fulfilled the king type he was already king but he had to fulfill the priesthood requirement because he had to inquire of the lord as a priest he had to be the intercessor for israel right and every time he did this he was undefeated every time he went before the ark and said great holy spirit he would no doubt worship and offer sacrifices do we go up to ziklag or do we go up against the philistines do we go up against all this every time he interceded for i want your people to be safe i don't want your people to die i want your people to be saved every time he interceded as a priest god answered his prayer oh hallelujah may that encourage us to go before the throne of god and bring others before the throne of god in intercession so david said he talks to all of israel he said verse 3 let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we inquire not at it in the days of saul in other words under the denominational days we weren't really in tune with the prince of god saul wasn't seeking god but we're going to be a generation that seeks god i didn't know yeah we were generally my parents might not have sought god they never didn't seek the face of god but we're going to be a generation that we enjoy the presence of god we seek the presence of god and we find it amazing how do you want to be that generation amen david said i will not repeat the heirs of my father's brother man and our grandfathers we will not repeat the heirs of that but we will live in the presence of god amen i will inquire of god about my job i'll inquire of god about my children i'll inquire of god about every decision i make because that's what the ark is for amen the bible said you were chosen for god's good pleasure you're not here for your pleasure you're here for god's pleasure amen and the only way to know that is to seek the ark of god amen hallelujah to seek the mind of christ the perfect will of god that's what david wanted he wanted god's heart more than his own is that right church that's why i love it when you go when all you all you once bring up your children or bring up your husbands bring up your wives that's the right way to do it that's that's bringing your your request before the ark of god right the word of god in other words lord jesus i need healing or i need victory here i need your guidance i don't want to take a misstep i want to be in the perfect will of god and i'm willing to show everybody that i want to live in your presence amen i don't care who's around all of us i know is that i'm in your presence and i want thus saith the lord hallelujah here's a man he said one thing i've desired that i may dwell in the house of the lord to behold his beauty and inquire in his temple see because he wants to be ready in the time of trouble in other words if you pray to god when there's easy times god's going to keep you in the tough times hallelujah because you thought jesus was beautiful and god is beautiful because you spent all these easy times in god's presence david said i know he's gonna keep me in the hard times i know there's a benefit to serving god amen i know if i re if i sow i shall reap praise god be not deceived god is not mocked if you dwell in the house of god god will protect you hallelujah amen and this brother answer this is the rapture scripture that's what look at the rapture 1965. this is brotherham's text see you want to inquire you want to know the mind of god so you stay in god's presence in the house of god and the time of trouble he'll hide you look in the secret of his tabernacle the secret all god's secrets hallelujah he makes known his secrets to you and he shall set me up on a rock there it is the rock zion the mountain right up up on iraq on a mountain the spiritual mount where in other words we're on the mount zion rock today praise god hallelujah now i got this from a website david was called of god to function in both a kingly and priestly capacity as king david was also claiming to be a priest clearly david saw himself serving the lord as a priest in order of melchizedek so a priesthood that was both priestly and kingly he had no right to serve as a priest under aaron's order but as a priest in melchizedek's order he was given divine permission to place the ark in open view sit before it and minister to it so god made a special area of grace so david and them he wasn't even a priest but he could live in the pride he could dance in the presence of the ark church he could dance and sing praises and shout and worship god in the presence of the ark which usually was only for high priest but god was showing there's coming a day hallelujah when the real kingdom priests after the order of melchizedek will come down to the earth and you have a thousand years of peace in the city of peace hallelujah thank god amen he rules in the city of peace and peace flows out to the entire world through this city of peace oh thank god now look i like this while he was serving in a priest capacity david was shown the messiah would serve before god in the same priesthood that's why david wrote in psalm 110 the lord has sworn and will not relent you are a priest forever after the order of melchizedek so while he was king and priest god showed him there's coming another one there's coming a greater king and priest than me and he will rule the world in righteousness he said i'm just fulfilling a type and if the type feels this good what about that one brother oh what about a thousand years of peace amen what about a thousand years of no temptation of total joy of total victory amen a total of just blessings of god that's what we're promised as we honor christ after the melchizedek order today how many enjoy that see david had a zeal for zion because he knew there's coming another ruler of zion who's way greater than me jerusalem is a city like no other it's the only place on earth god chose as his eternal home why does god why does the earth care so much about jerusalem why is it in the news all the time because god's eyes and interests are riveted on jerusalem and but so are satans as well that's why those muslims shoot those missiles at israel they're trying to take that land because they know the real messiah is coming they want to try to keep him out impossible the word of god has already gone forth and it will not return void they think they can defeat it with natural bombs and missiles and and shooting out all these bullets they think they can defeat the almighty supernatural god with natural things totally impossible praise god because the things that are eternal are the things not seen amen god's got greater spiritual bombs than they got natural bombs it's called the sword of his word that shoots out of his mouth and destroys the enemies hallelujah they think they can stop the messiah from coming the melchizedek the true milk has in it coming praise god but they can't do it hallelujah that's why there's so much warfare there all the time bombing and destroying and iron domes and all these things because that is god's land and he's coming he promised i will not forget uh jerusalem i will not forget zion remember the bible said that i will not rest until zion is mine let me pull that up there from the first sermon i preached where's part one down here okay thank you for your patience well let me see we'll just go real quick where is it there's a uh it's isaiah where it talks about that just give me a sec here this should go pretty fast help me lord where did i put that oh it's part one yeah part one sorry i know this is into part two all right well anyways sorry he said i will not relent maybe it'll just come back up there forgive me the bible says isaiah he said i will not rest until i made zion my my city praise god in other words god is going to constantly watch over zion the bible the zion represents israel's davidic inheritance or the promise of god to establish the son of david on the throne of zion forever yeah i think oh yeah here it is right here i skipped all around to find this for zion's sake i will not hold my peace and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest see god is not resting until her righteousness goes forth as a brightness and her salvation as a lamp that burns god is not going to rest until that city of jerusalem shines forth the love of jesus christ right now it's all wars but that can all change in a matter of moments that can all change in the twinkling of an eye amen amen hallelujah praise god god can change it whenever he wants of course he's going to let the two prophets come and we know the order god himself is going to fight without rest until jerusalem's righteousness and salvation shines brightly in the earth david wrote this by the holy ghost inspiration thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek and we know the story the second thing he did after i'm sure the first thing after he got the victory he got on the ephod and he started dancing and praising the lord because the ark there's the ark ark was way up there on the shoulders praise god way up above hallelujah highly exalted praise god and he danced around because he knows wow in 3000 years this is going to happen in real life the real messiah is going to rule here he'll have no enemies that can defeat him he'll never sin he'll never fall short and he'll rule the world in righteousness for the glory of god hallelujah so this is what david put on david put on something like this i don't know if you have yurim on or not but he did have an e5 which is a blue purple scarf and gold apron that he had on david put that on showing he was a priest after the order of melchizedek brother mahm said this he said melchizedek had no beginning no end no father i'm going to skip down he was not only a king he was a prince he's the prince of peace he's a rose of sharon living the valley i'm skipping out he was before david look at this he was in david melchizedek jesus christ was in david amen all right melchizedek had just he wasn't jesus christ's body but the spirit of god the spirit of jesus was in melchizedek so brother man said melchizedek's spirit was before david in david praise god and after david hallelujah amen in other words it was christ and david saying one day this land will be god's land hallelujah the whole earth shall be full of the glory of the lord amen thank god look at brother ham said brother ram said that goliath's fight he knew he was going to win can you imagine church he wasn't wondering why am i going to win this fight or not he wasn't scared brother branham said watch the prophet david said today i'll cut your head off from your shoulder amen why he know what he had whom he had believed he was fully persuaded he was able to keep that which he committed to him in other words god by vision showed david you're going to get the victory that's why he was so bold and church that's what god's going to give us he's going to give us the word lord the spirit of jesus is the spirit of prophecy amen think about it if we see those saints for a month or more our faith is going to be sky high praise god we'll know that pretty soon the last trump is going to go we'll be on fire we're trusting in god i don't know how god's going to do it but god is going to do it he's going to have a people that are ready for the coming of the lord praise god and they will have thy saith the lord just like david knew i'm going to get the victory he was a prophet that's why he knew it enoch knew about his rapture uh here we go elijah knew about his rapture jesus knew about his rapture and they always knew about the rapture so will we praise god what did elijah say at the mount carmel showdown he said i've done all this according to thy word in other words that's why elijah could mock those guys because he knew what was going to happen the spirit of prophecy had told him and church we know what's going to happen america is going to change the laws with the churches and they're going to make a one-world church we know it's going to happen we just got to stay out of that and if we stay out of that then we're already in the spiritual mount zion amen hallelujah praise god we know it's going to happen hallelujah just like they knew at thy word lord i have preached all these things at thy word i've sung all these songs and thy word i've got granddaughters to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and thy word we've done all these things amen we've kept the word and god has blessed us with faith hallelujah they knew the outcome because of vision the eyes of the lord see that's why we got eyes out so we can see ah i see the devil in the roman catholic church i see the communism brotherhood said the communism is just a tool in the hand of the devil like that's what they're trying to bring in with these 4.5 trillion dollar bills they're trying to bring in communism let them bring it in i don't know what's going to happen i don't i'm praying against it though right but that's just a tool in the hand of god brother i said don't let that deceive you you just keep your eyes on that purple curtain amen in other words keep your eyes on jesus and fight your enemy don't get your eyes off the enemy look at this church after he brought in the ark look at this though this is so beautiful david established a worship that moses never did david got all these instruments together and he raised up all these singers moses never had it but david started a brand new music ministry because he said i know god needs to be praised day and night because in revelation 4 verse 8 the bible said the angels cry holy holy holy day and night before the lord jesus christ amen look what david said he said we have sons of korah and these men are singers they're the chief of their fathers for they were employed in the work day and night in other words david was so under the anointing as a type of the priesthood of melchizedek he said we've got to start all night worship we've got to start all night praise unto god he said because i'm copying what's going on in heaven praise god i'm such a type of jesus christ that i want total worship for the for god almighty on the earth let it be done on earth as it is in heaven praise god oh hallelujah what a type moses didn't do this but david established this because he was a prefigure of the millennium and they rest not day or night saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty which was and is and is to come it's kind of hard to stop right now so just bear with me here let me uh let me close with this why is why is this so close to us why is it so important to us because under jesus's pre-or melchizedek priesthood he makes us kings and priests as well did anybody catch that during the first two sermons i'm saying how david the king and priest melchizedek king and priests did that scripture come to our minds that's what god wants to make you because he said the bride will be a kingdom of priests unto god that's why your prayers are so essential that's why your songs are so essential hallelujah church every chance we get no matter whether it's a special minister or not we should be praising the lord with all of our hearts amen whether it's a special preacher not you should be amen in the word as hard as you can because it's not so much about the man it's about the fact that jesus christ is high priest now and he's called each and one of you to be a priest and king unto god hallelujah so we have one great jesus christ king and priest who's making all of us kings and priests unto god and now it makes sense all these years i've wondered why are we kings and priests because god is giving us a taste of what is to come right if you're faithful with a little here he said i'll make a ruler over much if you can be a spiritual kingdom priest here god will make you a natural kingdom priest over there in the millennium how many understand that you ever ever understand that by god's grace now it makes sense because he's establishing a priesthood he's establishing a group of intercessors he's establishing a group of eternal worshipers he's establishing an eternal group of kings who can rule with his character and can worship and intercede so he will be pleased two scriptures say we're kings and priests unto god this scripture says we reign in life we reign in life by christ jesus we reign in life first peter two five i don't know that one i'm gonna look it up i just forgot that one let me look at it first peter 2 5. just hold you a little bit longer here by god's grace i just want to finish this thought if i can please hebrews james first and second peter first peter 2 5 yes ye also has lively stones or build up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ see god that now there it is again church we got to have the right sacrifice right how many want your your sacrifices to be acceptable so you got to worship in spirit and in truth right hebrews 13 15. hebrews 13 15. remember this you're probably familiar with this now look at verse 15 i love it i love the first two words by him in other words by the anointing of the holy ghost by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name there it is notice it's not like just a morning noon and night right it's a continual right constant that's what god wants like david had a constant worship a constant praise a constant sacrifice lord i give you thanks i give you worship i'm giving you thanksgiving today the bible said i give thanks to your holy name how do you want to do that by god's grace i want to give thanks to the name of jesus christ continually thank you for all your blessings i know i need help with that anyone else need help with that to be constantly giving thanks unto god let me close with this here let me see first peter 5 8 i heard again brother downey i heard this i just want to close with this thought here first peter 5 8. i was just struck by this and all week i was like trying to get back to this thought first peter 5 8. likewise no i'm sorry yep there it is yeah i'm at the wrong verse verse eight be sober be viligent because your adversary the devil as a roaring lying walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world let's stand to our feet musicians can come
