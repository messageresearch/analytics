[12:15] a list there praise the Lord but I
[12:17] encourage you you know I encourage you
[12:18] to pray in a way where your most sincere
[12:21] for example if you just said
[12:23] there the way he normally sit there it
[12:24] might turn into not really prayer but
[12:27] just thinking about different things
[12:28] that's why sometimes you know I come up
[12:30] to the altar or you might even want to
[12:32] stand and pray but let's take a few
[12:35] moments and let's pray and or that Adam
[12:40] will be like a deacon he'll just make
[12:41] sure our children watch the children to
[12:43] make sure they're sitting still and
[12:44] everything like that so girls sit still

[51:18] later on tomorrow
[51:19] or some other time lord I just pray you
[51:21] administer Lord to those individuals and
[51:24] Lord to that one sister who was weeping
[51:26] and crying for the Holy Ghost a few
[51:28] Wednesday nights ago as we preach father

[51:33] with your love fill her with eternal
[51:35] life Lord Jesus Lord perhaps she's
[51:37] listening tonight lord I just pray God
[51:39] your presence will be felt among all of
[51:42] us in Jesus Christ's name
[51:44] nobody said Amen god bless you to be
[51:46] in-situ praise the Lord so we're
[51:56] thankful again by the grace of God to be
[51:58] here tonight like I said I'll try to set
[52:00] my timer I'll try to be about an hour by
[52:02] the grace of the Lord I try to preach
[52:03] that long and especially on Wednesday
[52:05] nights so let's look at this we're on
[52:08] part 12 of the Philadelphia Church age
[52:11] series and Malachi when you're ready you
[52:13] can switch over buddy I have some quotes
[52:15] here tonight we'd like to start with the
[52:20] eulogy and the promise here we like to
[52:22] look at this here by God's grace so
[52:25] we're on part 52 of the series part 12
[52:27] overall these are my thoughts for the
[52:29] next sermon so I'm gonna skip past that
[52:31] those are my thoughts for the next one
[52:32] so our text was revelation 3:10 we're
[52:36] looking at the eulogy and the promise
[52:39] now the first thought if you haven't
[52:41] read the book in a while the Prophet
[52:43] deals with the thought of the word of my
[52:45] patience the word of my patience when
[52:48] look at that tonight so we read our text
[52:50] here's our text and the Prophet gets
[52:52] into this thoughts so he's gonna break
[52:54] into some thoughts on patience so I
[52:56] thought it'd be good tonight I think
[52:57] we'd be refreshed to remember how much
[52:59] God values patience so one look at that
[53:02] tonight for the first few minutes and
[53:03] then after that the Prophet breaks in
[53:05] the thoughts about the bride so he
[53:08] breaks into specific thoughts about the
[53:09] bride and I think I want to end with
[53:11] that by the grace of Lord if we have
[53:13] time now the Prophet quotes Hebrews 6 13
[53:19] through 15
[53:20] so notice whenever you're going to teach
[53:22] someone about patience or any other
[53:24] topic the way you do that is you use
[53:26] other scripture right you build
[53:28] scripture as isaiah said you build
[53:30] doctrine line upon line precept upon
[53:32] precept
[53:33] here little their little praise God so
[53:35] you build it that way so to understand
[53:38] Jesus's words of word of patience my
[53:40] word of patience brother Ram takes us to
[53:42] Hebrews six and said for when God made
[53:44] promise to Abraham because he could
[53:47] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[53:49] saying surely blessing I will bless thee
[53:51] and multiplying I'll multiply thee and
[53:53] so here's the thought that he brings out
[53:55] now after he had patiently endured he
[53:59] obtained the promise and that's the key
[54:02] word after let's all say after ready
[54:04] after after he endured he obtained
[54:07] because the prophets going to show us
[54:09] the order that God often brings his word
[54:12] to pass and usually it's after much
[54:15] trying or much patience or much waiting
[54:18] or much tribulation the Prophet said you
[54:22] see the Spirit is speaking about the
[54:24] word of God which is given to us to wait
[54:26] for the fulfillment of that word
[54:29] required patience how many one inherit
[54:32] God's promises one of the requirements
[54:35] is waiting in fact that's one of the
[54:38] most important promises one of the most
[54:40] important requirements is you have to
[54:42] wait upon the Lord don't get me wrong
[54:44] sure sometimes I get up here and people
[54:46] will put a testimony in and they'll say
[54:48] they'll say Oh God answered our prayer
[54:50] from Wednesday night and I just get
[54:51] excited like hallelujah I just getting
[54:53] surprised like mine now God could good
[54:56] because God can do that but many times
[54:58] that you notice many times the prayer
[55:00] request you put it they don't get answer
[55:01] right away maybe it'll be a month maybe
[55:04] to be a year six months maybe to be a
[55:07] year but see God does this he requires
[55:10] patience how many know you need more
[55:13] patience I know I do he said just as he
[55:17] did in the case of Abraham so Abraham
[55:20] was the father of what father of faith
[55:24] so he was the example he's what we
[55:27] should all look to for faith well the
[55:28] way he note we know we had faith was he
[55:30] kept he stayed true to God's Word hey
[55:33] man that's the way we know he had faith
[55:35] he patiently endured so the Prophet said
[55:37] he endured as seeing him who is
[55:39] invisible he was patient and then the
[55:41] word was finally fulfilled finally
[55:46] oh my when God answers prayer sometimes
[55:48] we can say finally thank you lord
[55:52] finally the prayers been answered
[55:54] hallelujah finally this was the way God
[55:58] teaches his people patience why if he
[56:03] fulfilled his word in physical
[56:05] manifestations the very instant you
[56:07] prayed you would never learn patience
[56:11] but would become even more impatient
[56:15] with life those are the key words were
[56:16] to look at we don't want to become more
[56:19] impatient we want to become more patient
[56:22] that means God is going to allow
[56:23] situations real desires you desire God
[56:27] to move in the situation but God's going
[56:29] to allow many of these to not happen
[56:30] right away so that he can build patience
[56:33] in your heart and in my heart as well
[56:36] can you imagine him every time now we
[56:38] got it we got it we got it we got a
[56:40] perversion on her phone well I need to
[56:42] know the weather well I need to know I
[56:43] need know the directions we can just say
[56:45] boom and there we got it in the old days
[56:48] you had to look up your map here to take
[56:49] your map with you write it down I was I
[56:52] was one of those when I first started
[56:54] driving there was no internet I to look
[56:56] up the maps and write down the roads and
[56:58] write down the routes and everything
[56:59] like that
[56:59] and we just got it now it's instant boom
[57:02] got it got it how do you feel when you
[57:04] don't get how do you feel when you're
[57:05] got you got no signal how do you feel
[57:07] what do you mean I can't call somebody
[57:09] you ever get that every Wednesday I
[57:13] Drive through this valley in Doylestown
[57:15] because we got to pick up milk and my
[57:16] signal to go out right in that Valley
[57:18] every week and sometimes I want to call
[57:21] somebody I'm like I get frustrated
[57:23] because I lose my signal for one minute
[57:26] what has this taught us to be more
[57:28] patient or less patient Church less
[57:32] patient and so see that's just a
[57:34] perversion now this is the perversion of
[57:37] what it's going to be like in the new
[57:38] millennium because the Bible said before
[57:40] we asked he'll answer amen this is a
[57:45] perversion of that because the Bible
[57:47] said before you even think it
[57:49] God will already send the answer to you
[57:51] amen that's the kind of civil a
[57:53] civilization we're going to praise God
[57:55] but see this is just a foreshadowing of
[57:57] it Oh
[57:59] now like I got this app and every time I
[58:02] Drive by Starbucks it pops up because I
[58:04] like Starbucks see it's predicting my
[58:07] behavior right if it predicts you like
[58:11] this or if you drive by a giant eagle or
[58:13] if you drive by whatever you like you
[58:15] know it'll just pop up is trying to
[58:17] predict what you need well that's how
[58:19] it's going to be like God accept times a
[58:21] thousand or times a million God's gonna
[58:24] know what we have need of even before we
[58:25] ask it amen
[58:26] he's gonna give it to us before we even
[58:28] ask it so see this is all foreshadowing
[58:31] but the natchan the natural it makes us
[58:33] impatient rather than patient now he
[58:42] says let me show you this truth even
[58:44] more fully set for so now the way to
[58:46] establish a truth further give us more
[58:48] word give us more scripture so that's
[58:51] what the Prophet done by faith Abraham
[58:53] when he was tried offered up Isaac and
[58:56] he that had received the promises
[58:57] offered up his only begotten Son the
[59:01] Prophet said there it is Abraham was
[59:03] tried after he received the word of
[59:05] promise
[59:06] most think that as soon as we pray in
[59:08] Jesus name over the good promises of God
[59:10] that there could not be a trial but here
[59:13] it says that Abraham was tried after he
[59:16] received the promise praise the Lord
[59:19] most time we think oh if you asked
[59:21] anything like we were praying even
[59:22] tonight if you ask anything in my name
[59:24] and I'll do it and we expect him to do
[59:26] it right now or where's God if he didn't
[59:29] answer in the last 30 years over the
[59:31] last 20 years we got to keep waiting on
[59:33] the Lord amen see the fulfillment comes
[59:38] after promise or after waiting promise
[59:41] comes first then testing and then we
[59:44] know fulfillment comes later we'll get
[59:46] to that now the Prophet now get directs
[59:48] us to another scripture in Psalms where
[59:50] it talks about Joseph until the time
[59:52] that his word came the word of the Lord
[59:55] tried him amen to see every promise that
[1:00:00] you're desiring I mean desire to see so
[1:00:02] saved I mean is hiring for more power of
[1:00:05] God more favor with God
[1:00:11] so whatever we're desiring that word has
[1:00:13] come because God knows we want to see it
[1:00:15] come to pass but it also comes to test
[1:00:18] us to see what we'll do in the midst of
[1:00:20] a test it comes to try us it comes to
[1:00:24] test us to see if we're if we really
[1:00:26] believe God or not so God gives us
[1:00:29] exceeding great and precious promises he
[1:00:31] has promised to fulfill them he will let
[1:00:35] me say it again he will if God gave any
[1:00:39] man a promise he will fulfill it but
[1:00:43] from the time we pray unto the time we
[1:00:45] get the answer he must learn to receive
[1:00:48] patients into our souls for only in
[1:00:50] patience do we possess life you know
[1:00:55] some people get I think often and I
[1:00:57] think we all we just get often
[1:00:58] discouraged with the Christian life well
[1:01:00] that we read that we read the book of
[1:01:02] Acts and alls we see as miracles but we
[1:01:04] miss all the other things in between the
[1:01:06] cracks like all the times Paul spent
[1:01:09] years in prison
[1:01:10] I often read about his him shaking off
[1:01:12] that surfer into the fire and saying I'm
[1:01:14] fine you know I got the power of God on
[1:01:17] me
[1:01:17] he gets stoned and they pick him up and
[1:01:19] they pick him up as dead but he comes
[1:01:21] back to life see we see all these
[1:01:23] supernatural things and we think my
[1:01:25] life's not like that but we fail to see
[1:01:27] all the hard times he went through in
[1:01:30] order to get that kind of faith amen
[1:01:32] remember Joseph was in prison I just
[1:01:34] read it recently the one historian said
[1:01:36] 13 years he was in prison we can't even
[1:01:40] imagine a night in prison well hopefully
[1:01:41] you can't if you did well that God will
[1:01:44] forgive you right we can't we can't
[1:01:46] imagine I can't imagine what it'd be
[1:01:47] like to lock it up to get to get pushed
[1:01:50] off in the cell and go to a hotel
[1:01:52] American prisons are called hotels
[1:01:54] I mean told me the Thailand people call
[1:01:57] American prisons hotels because they get
[1:02:00] beat in there they get starved there
[1:02:01] they you know they get mystery they get
[1:02:03] diseases they get all kinds of awful are
[1:02:06] our American system of prisons is like
[1:02:08] hotels we see we can't even we don't
[1:02:11] even know it's like to have one night in
[1:02:14] prison or two to really struggle in that
[1:02:17] type of manner see we should even we
[1:02:20] should know even if comi here tonight if
[1:02:22] even we just sit through the service and
[1:02:24] and
[1:02:25] maybe nothing supernatural is happening
[1:02:26] that we see we should know something is
[1:02:29] happening supernaturally and one thing
[1:02:32] that is supernaturally happening every
[1:02:34] service no matter no matter how we might
[1:02:36] not see it happen
[1:02:37] we are supernaturally learning to be
[1:02:39] patient amen glory and patience is one
[1:02:44] of the virtues of the statue of perfect
[1:02:46] man how many one of the how many want
[1:02:47] all the virtues flowing out through them
[1:02:50] there is no other way to get patience or
[1:02:53] to get the promise of God then patience
[1:02:55] and having to wait for it not have it
[1:02:59] but just keep believing keep waiting for
[1:03:02] it amen
[1:03:02] so I know even tonight I know something
[1:03:05] supernatural is happening what do you
[1:03:06] see brother sir you see angels no but I
[1:03:08] know they're there do you see miracles
[1:03:10] no but I see the miracle of patience
[1:03:12] happening in my life amen
[1:03:14] I'm learning to be more patient I'm just
[1:03:17] like Abraham I'm rejoicing in the
[1:03:19] promise despite not seeing the
[1:03:20] fulfillment of it I know God will keep
[1:03:22] his word amen hallelujah see that's
[1:03:26] something we have to learn that's why we
[1:03:28] have to keep coming to the house of God
[1:03:30] keep praying keep believing if we don't
[1:03:32] see it we got to be like Abraham I know
[1:03:33] we've heard this before
[1:03:35] but we've got to remember the value of
[1:03:36] it amen it's so valuable but there so
[1:03:40] this is the only way that we possess our
[1:03:43] lives is through patience the only way
[1:03:46] to really possess eternal life and the
[1:03:49] promise of God is to be patient with God
[1:03:52] that's exactly right
[1:03:53] Jesus said that we'll get to that in a
[1:03:55] minute we got all the scriptures to back
[1:03:56] this up he said may God help us to learn
[1:03:59] this lesson even as we know the people
[1:04:01] of the six Age learned patience we read
[1:04:06] the history of our of the lives of these
[1:04:08] great Christians what a contrast we see
[1:04:11] between their lives and ours
[1:04:12] for they were so patient and quiet look
[1:04:16] at this and today what are we we're all
[1:04:19] but overcoming over patience and hast
[1:04:21] got to have it now
[1:04:22] I need it now gotta have it now we're
[1:04:24] overcoming that now part of its the age
[1:04:27] we live in but part of it is if we feel
[1:04:29] that we're not overcoming like we need
[1:04:30] to so how many believe God's gonna help
[1:04:33] you overcome that we got to have
[1:04:35] something to overcome and you and I
[1:04:37] guess well you and I got to overcome
[1:04:38] Laodicea
[1:04:39] we got to overcome the most lustful age
[1:04:41] there ever was the most impatient age
[1:04:43] there ever was but guess what God chose
[1:04:45] you to overcome it
[1:04:47] God knew you'd be born in this hour you
[1:04:49] were predestinated overcome it you're
[1:04:51] gonna be more than a conqueror in Christ
[1:04:53] Jesus amen
[1:04:54] you got to learn how to be patient
[1:04:55] hallelujah amen
[1:04:58] I'm learning to be patient by the grace
[1:05:00] of the Lord hallelujah so this is the
[1:05:03] order first God gives a promise which we
[1:05:06] call a revelation or thus saith the Lord
[1:05:08] of God you say God spoke to me on Sunday
[1:05:10] brother Jesse or God spoke to me tonight
[1:05:12] God speaking to me right now that's a
[1:05:14] revelation
[1:05:15] that's at that state the Lord now in
[1:05:17] between what's next is God tests us are
[1:05:20] we really gonna believe that now you all
[1:05:23] know this in marriage so I can preach to
[1:05:25] those that I've been married we all we
[1:05:27] all receive the revelation oh this is
[1:05:29] the woman I was supposed to marry this
[1:05:31] was the man I was supposed to marry but
[1:05:32] then God let's time test us right and
[1:05:36] there's trials and well it was just the
[1:05:39] right choice and it's a test God allows
[1:05:41] tests to show what's really on inside of
[1:05:44] us and for the real believer like I was
[1:05:45] telling with that marriage counseling on
[1:05:47] Sunday I was telling them I'll tell them
[1:05:48] you've got to think about from your soul
[1:05:50] what did God what revelation do God
[1:05:52] placed in your soul
[1:05:53] don't take the thought Satan put in your
[1:05:55] mind you got to live from the inside you
[1:05:58] got to live from the seed you got to
[1:05:59] live from the word Amen you got to live
[1:06:02] from the revelation to see God tests us
[1:06:05] to go along in our marriage and we gonna
[1:06:07] let God tests us and we got to receive
[1:06:09] patience with each other and not only
[1:06:12] the natural marriage but our spiritual
[1:06:14] marriage our family of God right here we
[1:06:16] have to receive patience with one
[1:06:17] another and then after all those tests
[1:06:20] God rewards us and we inherit the
[1:06:23] promise we have to pass the test that's
[1:06:26] why there's tests at school every week I
[1:06:27] got to give tests all the time I got to
[1:06:29] see what have they learned and God is
[1:06:31] saying what have the Saints learned a
[1:06:32] bride and Christ fellowship our lives
[1:06:36] show what we're learning praise God
[1:06:38] our actions show what we've learned and
[1:06:41] we got to keep learning we got to keep
[1:06:43] passing the test amen now here's the
[1:06:46] thought though we got to remember not
[1:06:47] every promise will we receive during our
[1:06:50] lifetime let's go to Hebrews 11:13 I
[1:06:52] know
[1:06:53] Bibles we won't receive every promise
[1:06:56] we've got to be willing to go to the
[1:06:58] grave well I know God promised me all my
[1:07:00] children I've heard of some brothers say
[1:07:01] that I know God promised me the
[1:07:03] salvation of this one I know God
[1:07:04] promised me this and this and that which
[1:07:06] is fantastic but we got to be willing to
[1:07:08] even die and as our last breaths from
[1:07:12] our lips we can say thank you lord I'm
[1:07:13] going to receive the promise even if you
[1:07:17] don't see it on this side you got to
[1:07:19] have eyes of faith to see beyond this
[1:07:20] world amen and if you are a Christian
[1:07:22] you do have eyes of faith they meant you
[1:07:24] see into the other dimension you see
[1:07:26] into the unseen praise God the scene is
[1:07:29] temporal but the unseen is eternal
[1:07:31] praise God Hebrews 11 39 remember
[1:07:37] Abraham died when he died he only had a
[1:07:39] few descendants but God said your seeds
[1:07:41] gonna be like the stars of heaven do you
[1:07:44] think he died saying oh god you didn't
[1:07:45] keep your promise no he died in faith
[1:07:47] believing amen the same God that gave me
[1:07:50] Isaac the same God that gave me these
[1:07:52] seed God is gonna multiply my seat I
[1:07:54] might not see in my day but God's Word
[1:07:57] can never fail glory that's the same
[1:08:01] attitude we have to have even if I don't
[1:08:03] see even if it doesn't happen in my life
[1:08:05] even if the rapture does happen in my
[1:08:07] life even if I go to the grave I'll be
[1:08:09] in the rapture in fact our eyes first
[1:08:12] for the dead in Christ will rise first
[1:08:13] amen that's the kind of faith we got to
[1:08:16] have Hebrews 11 39 and these all having
[1:08:25] obtained a good report through faith
[1:08:26] received not the promise God having
[1:08:31] provided some better thing for us that
[1:08:33] they without us should not be made
[1:08:35] perfect amen so see they didn't get all
[1:08:39] the promises they desired in their life
[1:08:41] right what would God keep his word
[1:08:44] absolutely God was keep his word
[1:08:46] Abraham seed now is multiplying it now
[1:08:49] there's millions and now through the
[1:08:50] years there's been millions and maybe
[1:08:52] billions of Christians through the years
[1:08:54] and believers right Jews believers of
[1:08:57] all sorts but he had to pass the test
[1:08:59] the test I'm studying tonight for the
[1:09:01] test that's why you come to church
[1:09:04] that's why you read your Bible
[1:09:06] study for the test amen I don't want to
[1:09:08] fail the test I'm gonna get the test set
[1:09:10] oh I forgot to prepare I'm preparing
[1:09:12] right now praise God now remember just
[1:09:16] so this is kind of tie in Sunday night's
[1:09:18] message about we looked at Judas and the
[1:09:20] money spirit on Sunday night remember we
[1:09:22] all desire this we desire to go from
[1:09:24] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:09:25] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:09:27] and charity now put a little note in
[1:09:29] here Judas brother branham's had never
[1:09:31] had faith to begin with in fact the
[1:09:32] Bible proves that as we saw on Sunday
[1:09:34] night because he's as justified as
[1:09:36] already glorified so Judas could not
[1:09:39] have been justified he could not have
[1:09:40] had justification had a glorified body
[1:09:42] and then be lost and said well God I'm
[1:09:44] gonna do with that glorified body those
[1:09:45] bodies are eternal how many understand
[1:09:48] it
[1:09:48] eternal theophanies are eternal now
[1:09:53] let's build on faith little more
[1:09:55] brethren my brethren count it all joy
[1:09:56] when you fall into divers temptations
[1:09:59] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:10:01] faith works patience so remember you got
[1:10:05] to have that you got to have the
[1:10:05] revelation first you got to know God
[1:10:07] promised me God did say this in his word
[1:10:10] and I believe he spoke to me
[1:10:11] but after that then your faith has to be
[1:10:14] tried and God's got to prove to the
[1:10:16] devil that you really believe his word
[1:10:18] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:10:22] that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:10:25] lacking nothing we gotta let patience
[1:10:28] have her way praise God we gotta let
[1:10:31] patience work in our lives we gotta let
[1:10:33] it work out see we can't try to bring
[1:10:36] something to pass we got to let it work
[1:10:38] itself out in our life buh-bam said
[1:10:40] there's nothing greater than the power
[1:10:42] of committal and what is the power
[1:10:44] committal when you commit to God and you
[1:10:46] say if you don't I can't bring it to
[1:10:48] pass but I'm committing you to do it in
[1:10:50] your time okay that's the committal of
[1:10:54] Abraham that's the committal of every
[1:10:55] believer there's powernet because
[1:10:58] there's patience in that and patience
[1:11:00] will make you perfect amen it's exactly
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] now I'm going to drop back to Judas
[1:11:06] because remember this is what we need to
[1:11:08] preach and this is the hour of preaching
[1:11:10] showing truth and air praise God showing
[1:11:13] wise version versus foolish virgin
[1:11:15] versus make believer we're not going to
[1:11:17] stumble over the unbeliever we know the
[1:11:19] people in the bar
[1:11:19] we know the transgender people we know
[1:11:22] people homosexuality you know we know
[1:11:24] people like that will not inherit the
[1:11:25] kingdom of God
[1:11:26] but what's deceptive is that
[1:11:29] make-believe spirit right
[1:11:31] that Judas spirit so we have to make
[1:11:33] sure that's not on us remember remember
[1:11:35] Lot's wife if you remember Lot's wife
[1:11:37] she was on the same classification of
[1:11:39] Judas she almost was saved Judas was
[1:11:42] almost saved Lot's wife was almost saved
[1:11:45] and Jesus said remember those borderline
[1:11:47] believers now so Judas never had faith
[1:11:53] so he never got real patience now let's
[1:11:58] apply this to his money situation
[1:12:00] Judas really now he might add a good
[1:12:02] reason well maybe my family maybe my
[1:12:05] family maybe that a death in the family
[1:12:06] I gotta pay for the funeral I'm just
[1:12:08] kind of making up a story you know
[1:12:09] Nemean fact he probably had some reason
[1:12:11] why he needed money right Judas so he
[1:12:14] thought well I can just get this money
[1:12:16] here real quick I can just get a deal
[1:12:19] Jesus is supernatural they're not gonna
[1:12:21] especially not on the holiday they're
[1:12:22] not gonna kill him
[1:12:23] easy he's easy supernatural he does all
[1:12:26] these things so instead of being patient
[1:12:29] waiting for the money what he tried to
[1:12:30] do is try to get the money right now do
[1:12:33] that so you can see right now he never
[1:12:35] had faith to begin with because he
[1:12:36] didn't have patience to wait for the
[1:12:38] money whatever reason was behind his
[1:12:40] desire for money he didn't have the
[1:12:42] patience to wait for the money he
[1:12:44] thought he could get it some wrong way
[1:12:45] we must make sure we get money the right
[1:12:47] way right by keeping the Word of God
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:51] that's right that's why my children me
[1:12:55] why don't we buy those lottery cards you
[1:12:58] know which I I mean they see people buy
[1:13:01] it at the store and I got explained to
[1:13:03] them that's not the right way to get
[1:13:04] money because you lose money most of the
[1:13:07] time and you look like a fool doing it
[1:13:09] you're scratching I'm I'm trying to get
[1:13:12] money that don't belong to me what a
[1:13:14] evil spirit that is what a greedy
[1:13:17] selfish spirit did it I'm trying to get
[1:13:18] the tax money I'm going to get these
[1:13:20] people's money why don't you work
[1:13:21] instead of why don't you spend your
[1:13:22] effort instead of trying to scratch it
[1:13:23] off won't you scratch off some dirt off
[1:13:25] the floor and sweep the floor or
[1:13:27] something like that why don't you try to
[1:13:28] make some money the honest way see it's
[1:13:30] a dishonest way to get money but
[1:13:32] Christians get money the
[1:13:33] on its way you see we got patience my
[1:13:36] employer is gonna pay me right they're
[1:13:38] gonna pay me I'm gonna work hard I'll go
[1:13:40] guys provided way it's God's provided
[1:13:42] way to salvation it's got to provide a
[1:13:43] way for money it's God's provided way
[1:13:45] for everything amen and it's got to be
[1:13:49] God's pride away for patience which is
[1:13:52] just waiting just wait because it's a
[1:13:55] test are you gonna wait in the Word of
[1:13:57] God and you wait in the fear of God as
[1:13:59] we heard the song are gonna wait we're
[1:14:01] gonna compromise like Judas you know
[1:14:03] we're gonna wait and obey or wait and
[1:14:05] compromise we must wait and obey the
[1:14:07] Word of God now here's the quote we read
[1:14:09] Sunday night as we closed the probe and
[1:14:10] saw about Judas when he was here on
[1:14:12] earth he met up with Jesus made a
[1:14:13] confession he was a believer and became
[1:14:15] the treasure pack and all the money is
[1:14:17] that right you all know that now if he
[1:14:19] believed on Jesus he accepted falsely
[1:14:22] justification he never was justified he
[1:14:26] accepted it falsely just like you see
[1:14:28] people today oh I believe in Jesus
[1:14:29] another year they're drunkards you know
[1:14:31] they're covered in tattoos or they go
[1:14:33] the way of the world
[1:14:34] they never believed in the first place
[1:14:37] now here's the core I didn't have time
[1:14:39] to show you I'm gonna show you two
[1:14:40] because I mentioned it on Sunday night I
[1:14:41] want you to know I'm saying and try and
[1:14:42] say what brother Brahim said as it lines
[1:14:44] up with the Bible Judas only played
[1:14:47] Church I'm glad I'm not playing tonight
[1:14:49] he wasn't really sincere see that see
[1:14:52] why we got to be sincere every time we
[1:14:53] come the house of God he would come to
[1:14:55] church he wasn't really sincere like I
[1:14:58] visited a couple churches lately I think
[1:15:00] I was telling some reasons on the phone
[1:15:01] I visited Iowa North Carolina I saw some
[1:15:03] people that weren't really sincere
[1:15:04] hiding over there just because they were
[1:15:06] laughing and joking while the preaching
[1:15:08] of the word is going on there the
[1:15:10] brought some of the brothers or elbowed
[1:15:11] each other saying haha look at this and
[1:15:13] that's really insincere no it's yes this
[1:15:17] respect will do it's insincere now what
[1:15:20] are they showing they show you at some
[1:15:22] point they were sincere when they come
[1:15:24] the house of God but by laughing and
[1:15:26] joking and making fun of people right in
[1:15:27] the service right in the service is the
[1:15:30] service after the Holy Ghost fell be
[1:15:32] poor weeping at the altar look how quick
[1:15:33] people can get insincere we must keep
[1:15:36] this peace with sincerity and truth the
[1:15:39] Bible says see and so Judas
[1:15:43] at some point he stopped coming to
[1:15:45] church sincere he just came because he
[1:15:47] oh he's the treasurer well Jesus called
[1:15:49] me I guess I better come if he invited
[1:15:51] me but Jesus just doesn't want you to
[1:15:53] become a part of Jesus don't wants to be
[1:15:55] a Wallflower he wants you to be somebody
[1:15:57] that's used by the Holy Spirit he wants
[1:16:00] to be a participant not an observer a
[1:16:02] participant in end want you to
[1:16:05] participate be a part of the worship
[1:16:07] feel sincere the Bible said he didn't
[1:16:11] actually have faith did actually have it
[1:16:14] so how could he ever get patience he
[1:16:16] couldn't because it's one step at a time
[1:16:18] God raises our faith one step at a time
[1:16:22] see if he would have he never would have
[1:16:25] betrayed Jesus see he sewed that seed of
[1:16:27] discrepancy he thought that he could
[1:16:28] make friends with the world ma'am and
[1:16:31] also have friendship with Jesus oh I can
[1:16:33] sell out Christ but Jesus will still
[1:16:35] forgive me see how he's planning out his
[1:16:36] life I know I'll be forgiving maybe I'll
[1:16:38] be forgiving at the end Jesus will
[1:16:40] accept me I'm he already called me I'm
[1:16:41] already a member of his church
[1:16:43] I've been going his church for two or
[1:16:44] three and a half years you know I've
[1:16:45] been get all these excuses he planned
[1:16:50] out his sin thinking that he could be
[1:16:52] forgiven of it see Christians must never
[1:16:54] plan out sin we must never willingly go
[1:16:58] into sin we've got to fight against him
[1:17:00] we better resist sin praise God
[1:17:02] we've got to be zealous against sin that
[1:17:07] we don't go into it willingly but we
[1:17:09] purposely fight against it that's right
[1:17:12] if Judas was to see the enemy and the
[1:17:14] discrepancy it also became flesh and
[1:17:16] dwelt among us and the person of judas
[1:17:18] iscariot he never had no real real faith
[1:17:22] he had what he thought was a faith and
[1:17:26] how do you know how do you know you have
[1:17:28] real faith it's really simple you pass
[1:17:30] the word test whatever the word says you
[1:17:33] do it
[1:17:34] praise God that pretty easy see Judas
[1:17:38] had the word he knew the word he just
[1:17:40] didn't keep the word we must keep the
[1:17:42] word and we must be sincere with the
[1:17:44] word of God see Baretta there's such a
[1:17:47] thing as having faith and a make-believe
[1:17:49] faith Judas had a make-believe faith
[1:17:54] genuine faith of God will believe in God
[1:17:56] and God is the word it'll never add
[1:17:59] nothing to it the Bible tells us if we
[1:18:01] add one word or take one word away our
[1:18:03] part will be taken from the book of life
[1:18:04] he says that revelation 22:18 the last
[1:18:06] closing chapter amen
[1:18:08] oh this Gospels so simple it's so simple
[1:18:11] it's the highways the way of holiness
[1:18:12] and a fool will not air on this one
[1:18:14] highway amen
[1:18:16] you can't you can't make it air you if
[1:18:18] you're in Christ you're gonna pass every
[1:18:20] test because you're gonna keep the word
[1:18:21] every step of the way and that what is
[1:18:24] that genuine faith genuine faith genuine
[1:18:28] faith I'll just wait on the promise of
[1:18:29] God I was tempted for this I'm tempted
[1:18:31] for that tempted for that but I'm gonna
[1:18:33] deny all of it I'm just gonna wait on
[1:18:35] the will of God I'm gonna learn patience
[1:18:37] and God will answer His Word in time
[1:18:40] amen
[1:18:42] it's exactly right it's not the easiest
[1:18:45] thing it's actually the hardest thing to
[1:18:46] do the heart that's what Judas couldn't
[1:18:48] do he couldn't wait on God
[1:18:49] he couldn't be patient and remember
[1:18:54] every time we get impatient something
[1:18:56] bad happens
[1:18:57] remember David got impatient oh I'll
[1:18:59] just go up I'll make my own cart and
[1:19:01] what happened brother have said that
[1:19:03] honest man named use iodide and mother
[1:19:06] and even said an honest good-hearted man
[1:19:07] he was his heart was so good he wanted
[1:19:10] to catch the ark before it hit the
[1:19:11] ground and God I'm not an honest
[1:19:13] good-hearted seemingly innocent man but
[1:19:16] he broke the word and God was trying to
[1:19:18] teach David a lesson you don't do
[1:19:20] anything until it's all in the word the
[1:19:23] right way amen in church the bride knows
[1:19:27] what God wants done with the word and we
[1:19:29] must wait till we have the word until we
[1:19:32] do what we're called to do that's
[1:19:34] exactly right
[1:19:34] now here's the scripture Jesus talking
[1:19:38] about is Luke 21 he's talking about the
[1:19:40] end times
[1:19:41] and ye shall betray both my parents
[1:19:43] brethren kins folks friends think about
[1:19:45] that Peter James John Bartholomew
[1:19:47] Thaddeus they all got betrayed by
[1:19:49] parents brethren kins folk friends and
[1:19:52] some of you shall they cause put to
[1:19:55] death your own family your own friends
[1:20:00] he should be hate
[1:20:01] of all men for my name's sake but there
[1:20:04] shall not inherit perish now look he
[1:20:07] just said they're gonna be put to death
[1:20:08] but he said your hair's not gonna perish
[1:20:10] what does that mean it's that story that
[1:20:12] brother Bram said but the man told his
[1:20:15] wife and said he said or she remember he
[1:20:18] told her he said I turned to think of
[1:20:19] the story now he said he said I never
[1:20:22] lost one of my hairs he and she said
[1:20:24] pray tell me where they are
[1:20:26] brother Graham said wherever they were
[1:20:28] before I got them that's where they are
[1:20:29] right now what does this mean this is
[1:20:32] speaking to not one hair of your head
[1:20:35] will perish because God is going to
[1:20:37] restore your physical body he's going to
[1:20:39] bring it back he's going to put the
[1:20:40] treasure body with a theophany with the
[1:20:42] glorified all into one body amen and now
[1:20:45] one of those atoms not one of those
[1:20:47] cells would be lost God will bring every
[1:20:49] one of them back you'll look just
[1:20:50] exactly like he went you were 20 years
[1:20:52] old that's how you look in the heavenly
[1:20:54] City ain't him that's unfortunate for me
[1:20:57] because I don't like how I look when I
[1:20:58] was 20 but either way either way Jesus
[1:21:02] said not one of those hairs will parents
[1:21:04] God knows where every one of those atoms
[1:21:06] are every one of those cells are God's a
[1:21:08] God of restoration amen and so he says
[1:21:11] this you might die but you won't lose
[1:21:13] one of those hairs I'm gonna bring them
[1:21:15] back to you Oh precious is the flow that
[1:21:20] makes us white as snow no other fount I
[1:21:22] know nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:21:25] it makes us so clean it makes us so
[1:21:27] protected by God he promises to protect
[1:21:29] every hair on our heads amen and then
[1:21:33] Jesus says after all this I've knowing
[1:21:35] you're gonna die you're gonna be
[1:21:37] betrayed by all your family and friends
[1:21:39] you're gonna be mystery to all these
[1:21:40] things he said but in your patience your
[1:21:42] patience see it has to come from God to
[1:21:46] you see it has to be from God's faith -
[1:21:49] now it's my faith in other words it has
[1:21:52] to go from brother branham's faith - now
[1:21:54] it's my faith well brother brandon has
[1:21:56] testimony how about you how about me
[1:21:59] brother branham had faith that nobody
[1:22:01] ever had faith do I have faith brother
[1:22:04] Branham had patience he could wait to
[1:22:05] got healed you know when he was in 1965
[1:22:07] of his stomach condition he could wait
[1:22:09] till he got healed
[1:22:10] can you wait till you get here
[1:22:12] absolutely see it's got to be
[1:22:14] your patient see if it got to become
[1:22:16] your testimony it's got to be coming
[1:22:18] your thing it's got to be coming your
[1:22:19] power aren't you glad that you possess
[1:22:21] the promise of God
[1:22:23] it's my testimony it's God it's my faith
[1:22:26] that God has given to me by His grace
[1:22:28] you understand what I'm saying
[1:22:30] God has given you and I a testimony it's
[1:22:32] got to be ours see in your patience he
[1:22:35] said in your patience possess your souls
[1:22:38] now in the Hebrew down here possess
[1:22:40] means to get you get your soul in your
[1:22:43] patience you get your soul you obtain it
[1:22:45] you possess it it's like marrying a wife
[1:22:48] to see in your and your patients that's
[1:22:51] when you actually possess the eternal
[1:22:54] life is what I'm saying in patience you
[1:22:56] possess eternal life so patience helps
[1:22:59] us acquire eternal life you will not get
[1:23:01] eternal life without having patience can
[1:23:04] you say Amen that's absolutely
[1:23:06] scriptural Hebrews 6 11 and we designed
[1:23:09] that every one of you to show the same
[1:23:11] diligence that's effort remember human
[1:23:13] effort interest we must give interest in
[1:23:16] the to the full assurance of the hoped
[1:23:19] unto the end that you be not slothful we
[1:23:22] can't be lazy but followers them who
[1:23:25] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:23:27] promises so see real faith is assurance
[1:23:30] and a full diligence or a full interest
[1:23:33] in the promise of God brings us to the
[1:23:36] full assurance of our hope eternal life
[1:23:38] we've got to be fully interested fully
[1:23:41] diligent fully devoted to the promise of
[1:23:44] God and then we obtain eternal life we
[1:23:47] inherit the promises and now we already
[1:23:50] read this one but I had it later in this
[1:23:52] and the in the sermon but I just jumped
[1:23:54] ahead to it cuz I wanted you to see that
[1:23:55] there are promises we won't on here
[1:23:57] until we get over there in the other
[1:24:00] land praise God heaven hey man paradise
[1:24:03] now I just want to bring these quotes
[1:24:05] back up from a statute perfect man how
[1:24:07] many enjoy that message oh my brother
[1:24:09] Brooks was preaching on that at his
[1:24:10] church and kind of stir me up a little
[1:24:12] bit he remember said if you've got faith
[1:24:15] it works patience the Bible said see so
[1:24:17] this is patience now that's the next
[1:24:20] thing there is going to build this
[1:24:22] stature you know God has got real
[1:24:23] material in this building see there's a
[1:24:25] real patience and there's a make-believe
[1:24:26] patience but God's got real
[1:24:28] patience see how short we are brother
[1:24:31] sister see see why where we're at yes
[1:24:33] sir
[1:24:34] he said we have glory shouts and things
[1:24:36] because we got faith but when we come
[1:24:38] down to these things here God can't
[1:24:40] build us into that stature see he can't
[1:24:42] he can't make us up to that kind of a
[1:24:44] place we got he said we got all these
[1:24:47] other things we fall slide off with it
[1:24:49] see he can't build his church so see
[1:24:53] he's saying like we have we could have
[1:24:54] rejoicing in emotional times but we got
[1:24:56] to have these virtues like patience we
[1:24:59] gotta have a virtue like godliness
[1:25:01] we got a virtue liked temperance we got
[1:25:03] have self-control now I love this
[1:25:07] patience with what what kind of patience
[1:25:09] do we have the first thing is patience
[1:25:12] with God that's the very first thing we
[1:25:15] have to have patience with with God we
[1:25:19] could say well I just wish I was more
[1:25:20] patient with my children I wish I was
[1:25:22] more patient with my wife or my
[1:25:23] co-worker well the first thing you need
[1:25:25] is to be patient with God because God
[1:25:27] has your soul in his hand right he's
[1:25:30] controlling all the situations he's
[1:25:32] orchestrating your life as sovereignly
[1:25:35] in his hand he lets happen to your life
[1:25:37] what he wants to happen in your life and
[1:25:40] we must have patience with God God
[1:25:41] allowed my wife to act like this or God
[1:25:43] allowed my husband act like this or God
[1:25:45] allowed this in my life we must be
[1:25:47] patient with God we must look beyond the
[1:25:49] flesh and look to the spiritual realm
[1:25:52] first thing is have patience with God
[1:25:55] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:25:58] have real patience because faith works
[1:26:00] patience or faith produces patience when
[1:26:04] God says anything you believe it that's
[1:26:05] all you got patience say well I asked
[1:26:09] for him healing last night to heal me
[1:26:11] and I'm just the sick this morning I
[1:26:12] said oh my what patience is that don't
[1:26:17] we act like that sometimes I've had that
[1:26:19] many times I've been sick late at night
[1:26:20] I've had fevers over the years and
[1:26:22] sometimes I get discouraged like I'll go
[1:26:24] all the night with a fever I can't sleep
[1:26:25] and I'll be like where's my faith
[1:26:27] where's my faith and sometimes I think
[1:26:28] of this quote where's my faith why did
[1:26:32] it happen right now I want to right now
[1:26:33] order right now I guess I don't have
[1:26:37] faith I guess in on faith and the whole
[1:26:38] time you might have genuine faith
[1:26:42] God's just not gonna answer right then
[1:26:43] he wants you to be patient for it think
[1:26:49] about that with Abraham anytime during
[1:26:50] that 25 years did he become a sinner and
[1:26:53] not have faith anymore no he was a
[1:26:56] certainty was a believer for the whole
[1:26:57] time he said believers the whole time he
[1:26:59] had a few stumbles but what happens when
[1:27:00] a man's thumb was a real Christian he
[1:27:02] just gets back up
[1:27:03] he just says up brush it off she made
[1:27:06] him a little mistake there I'm still on
[1:27:07] the road I'm selling the way to I'm
[1:27:08] still on the Kayden's land Amen I'm
[1:27:11] walking the cane as then I still know
[1:27:12] where I'm going I just got to get clean
[1:27:14] off a little bit praise the Lord I got
[1:27:15] my garments white again praise God
[1:27:17] gotta wash him in the blood of Jesus
[1:27:19] again see God told Abraham 25 years
[1:27:23] later there wasn't even one sign he was
[1:27:28] still believing he was patient with God
[1:27:30] uh-huh there wasn't even one side and
[1:27:34] then brother Branham jumps that Noah
[1:27:35] about patience Noah had patience yeah
[1:27:40] real godly patience God says I'm gonna
[1:27:42] destroy this world with rain and Noah
[1:27:43] preached 120 years yet I've been
[1:27:47] preaching on the rapture by the Amen for
[1:27:49] 13 years and I haven't seen one person
[1:27:53] have a body change yet I don't have one
[1:27:56] speck of evidence that the rapture is
[1:27:57] gonna happen in my lifetime but guess
[1:28:00] what I'm still preaching it I've only
[1:28:03] been preaching 13 years on the rapture
[1:28:05] he preached a 120 years on a flood and
[1:28:09] it came to pass how do we know the
[1:28:12] rapture is gonna happen because it's
[1:28:13] dust saith the Lord God said so so I
[1:28:16] just like know I've got a void all the
[1:28:18] scoffers I got a void all the naysayers
[1:28:20] I got to avoid all the people that fall
[1:28:22] away and we just got to believe God is
[1:28:24] going to rapture a bride off this earth
[1:28:26] they're gonna change in the moment tweak
[1:28:28] of an eye and I just got enough faith
[1:28:30] and patience to believe I'm one of them
[1:28:32] ain't ahead hallelujah I'll just keep
[1:28:35] building
[1:28:35] I'll keep pounding away I'll just keep
[1:28:37] getting this Ark ready I'll just keep
[1:28:39] trying to get everybody in this arc that
[1:28:41] I know amen
[1:28:42] because this heart today is not a ship
[1:28:43] this Ark is Christ amen look plenty of
[1:28:48] patience well Jesse I could I can only
[1:28:51] wait ten more years for the rapture
[1:28:52] after that I don't know if I could wait
[1:28:53] I could wait about a hundred more years
[1:28:56] I could wait another lifetime for the
[1:28:59] rapture why because I've got plenty of
[1:29:00] patience so do you you do if you waited
[1:29:05] this long I can wait a little longer
[1:29:07] God's doing something supernatural in my
[1:29:10] life he's teaching me to wait on him
[1:29:13] it's something supernatural you can't
[1:29:15] see it other than the fact that I'm
[1:29:17] staying faithful to Christ amen
[1:29:20] show me America do a miracle tonight God
[1:29:22] in God saying I am I'm gonna teach you
[1:29:24] patience tonight I'm gonna do something
[1:29:28] so supernatural tonight I'm gonna help
[1:29:30] Lydia be more patient
[1:29:31] I don't know Jessie have more patients
[1:29:36] to wait for the rapture see we think we
[1:29:40] think oh oh we've been the message these
[1:29:41] are yours where's the rapture but RAM
[1:29:43] said it won't be one second late he said
[1:29:46] Jesus will not be one second late Jesus
[1:29:50] just waiting there the Bible said he's
[1:29:51] waiting there he said only the Father
[1:29:53] Knows only that invisible spirit knows
[1:29:55] when he's gonna whisper and a Jesus here
[1:29:56] and say it's time blow the trumpet and
[1:30:01] when Jesus gets ready to blow that
[1:30:02] trumpet when to save your calls there be
[1:30:05] someone I'll be somewhere listen for my
[1:30:07] name hallelujah perhaps your time and
[1:30:12] the trumpet blows like I don't know how
[1:30:14] to do a trumpet go ho ho I'll be
[1:30:18] listening maybe between 6:00 and 9:00 in
[1:30:20] the morning but I don't know about you
[1:30:22] but I got plenty of patience for it I'll
[1:30:24] keep waiting on it because I'm just like
[1:30:26] Noah I'm a preacher of righteousness a
[1:30:28] name
[1:30:29] we must live our righteous holy life now
[1:30:32] look he weighed 120 years not even do
[1:30:34] fell from heaven there wasn't even one
[1:30:37] sign that there was going to be rain but
[1:30:40] what did God give him God gave him
[1:30:41] patience that's what preachers need
[1:30:44] patience that's what everybody needs
[1:30:47] patience I said the laity needs patience
[1:30:51] just as dusty as it ever was for a
[1:30:56] hundred and twenty years he but he was
[1:30:58] patient then God tries your patience
[1:31:00] that's right God tries them see Satan
[1:31:04] said Oh Noah don't believe he went to
[1:31:05] preach he would not even preach a
[1:31:07] hundred years on the
[1:31:09] and gods like watch him Pisa that's my
[1:31:13] son
[1:31:13] watch him oh that Bride of Christ
[1:31:16] fellowship they could never wait 15
[1:31:18] years for the rapture our church is only
[1:31:19] 11 years old oh they could never wait 20
[1:31:22] years they could never wait 30 years
[1:31:24] God says watch them no matter what
[1:31:27] devices they bring out the Google
[1:31:28] glasses next or the Holograms or
[1:31:30] whatever whatever they bring our next
[1:31:32] we're not gonna let these things
[1:31:34] distract us from the Word of God
[1:31:35] we're gonna stay faithful to thus saith
[1:31:37] the Lord the Bible said we know Satan's
[1:31:41] devices we are aware of Satan devices we
[1:31:43] know what he's trying to do he's trying
[1:31:45] to deceive people into sin and
[1:31:46] unrighteousness and unholy living but we
[1:31:49] know we fear God we cast out all sin we
[1:31:52] cast out anything that exalts itself
[1:31:54] against the knowledge of God and we're
[1:31:56] zealous to be overcomers amen it's
[1:31:59] exactly right
[1:32:00] hallelujah how much patience you got
[1:32:02] brother Jess just plenty I got plenty
[1:32:05] I got patience like a river I got
[1:32:07] patience like Noah I've got patience
[1:32:09] like 120 years of preaching praise God
[1:32:11] and he did that without the baptism of
[1:32:13] the Holy Ghost how much could we do with
[1:32:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:32:20] Christ goes on to say because you've
[1:32:21] kept my word and lived it and thereby
[1:32:23] become patient I will keep you from the
[1:32:25] hour temptation see we are so blessed
[1:32:29] just because we're patient we don't try
[1:32:31] to rush out and do something we all know
[1:32:32] people that are rush down their lives
[1:32:33] made harsh decisions you know maybe in
[1:32:35] relationships or finances or other
[1:32:38] things they just make these harsh
[1:32:39] decisions and they suffer the
[1:32:41] consequences more right but God said
[1:32:44] because you're patient I'm going to keep
[1:32:46] you from the laying down of the mark of
[1:32:48] the beast that's what the Bible says the
[1:32:51] hour temptation that comes upon the
[1:32:52] whole world is the mark of the beast
[1:32:53] because we're patient with God's Word we
[1:32:56] won't have to decide ah should I do this
[1:32:58] should I sell out or not you have to
[1:33:00] we're gonna lose all my money in the
[1:33:02] bank account or we're gonna lose our
[1:33:03] church building we wanted to go through
[1:33:05] that he's gonna keep us from the hour of
[1:33:07] temptation that's the Word of God now
[1:33:12] here again we see the overlapping of
[1:33:13] these two ages for this promise has to
[1:33:15] do with the end of the Gentile period
[1:33:17] which culminates in the Great
[1:33:18] Tribulation all right I got 18 minutes
[1:33:20] here let me see
[1:33:21] now I'll preach on this
[1:33:23] numerous times over the years I presume
[1:33:25] this probably three or four times he
[1:33:27] talks about the our patience let me just
[1:33:28] go through quickly I will keep you from
[1:33:31] the hour of temptation which you come
[1:33:33] upon all the world to try them that
[1:33:34] dwell upon the earth the Prophet said
[1:33:37] this is not a declaration that the true
[1:33:39] church will go into and through the
[1:33:41] tribulation if it meant that it would
[1:33:43] have said that but it said I will keep
[1:33:45] thee from the hour temptation this
[1:33:47] temptation is exactly like the
[1:33:49] temptation Eden it will be very inviting
[1:33:53] proposition held up in direct opposition
[1:33:55] to God's command and word and yet from
[1:33:58] the standpoint of human reasoning it
[1:33:59] will be so very right so enlightening
[1:34:01] and life-giving as to food the world
[1:34:03] now here's I want to bring this to you
[1:34:05] you know what the Bible said the Bible
[1:34:07] said we're waiting for his son from
[1:34:09] heaven whom he raised from the dead even
[1:34:11] Jesus which delivered us from the wrath
[1:34:13] to come we are delivered from the wrath
[1:34:18] to come because we believe in Jesus
[1:34:20] Christ the wrath is going to start with
[1:34:24] the laying down of the mark of the beast
[1:34:26] once that mark is laid out the two
[1:34:28] prophets are going to start calling and
[1:34:29] the seven trumpets they're gonna start
[1:34:30] calling the seven trumpets it's gonna be
[1:34:32] a complete interruption of nature but it
[1:34:35] starts with the laying down of the mark
[1:34:37] of the beast but we are promised he's
[1:34:40] kept us from the wrath that is to come
[1:34:43] this is the rapture Scripture brother
[1:34:45] BAM used when he preached the rapture in
[1:34:47] December 1965 one thing I desired of the
[1:34:50] Lord that I will seek after that I may
[1:34:52] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:34:54] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[1:34:56] the Lord and to enquire in his temple
[1:34:59] for in the time of trouble he shall let
[1:35:03] me be purged in the tribulation no sir
[1:35:06] for the time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:35:09] in his house his pavilion in the secret
[1:35:14] of his Tabernacle shall you hide me he
[1:35:16] shall set me up Epona rock that rock is
[1:35:19] so hot it's a rock that's in the air
[1:35:21] because the meeting is in the air praise
[1:35:23] God it's not a natural Rock it's a
[1:35:26] heavenly rock and that rock is Christ
[1:35:28] amen that's the rock he sets me up on
[1:35:33] now remember the bro
[1:35:34] my wife is not mentioned in the
[1:35:36] tribulation text of all revelations you
[1:35:38] read it read it some done the bride is
[1:35:41] not mentioned in chapter 8 not mention
[1:35:43] in chapter 9 now she's mentioned in
[1:35:44] chapter 10 because she's John she takes
[1:35:46] the book and prophesized before all
[1:35:48] nations so the bride is mentioned in
[1:35:50] chapter 10 I know there's a core program
[1:35:52] said she's not seen from chapter 4 all
[1:35:54] the way to 19 but you have to balance
[1:35:56] out quotes church never understand you
[1:35:58] got to take every quote back to the word
[1:36:00] because the bride is in Revelation
[1:36:02] chapter 10 brother Branham is in
[1:36:04] Revelation chapter 10 and is he bride or
[1:36:06] not I'm here you see you see out there
[1:36:08] Bayless every quote we got to be real
[1:36:12] careful with the quotes not to make
[1:36:13] every one that saith the Lord because
[1:36:15] that's idolatry revelation 11 12 13 14
[1:36:18] 15 16 17 18 the bride is not mentioned
[1:36:21] in any of those chapters because those
[1:36:23] are all tribulation chapters only the
[1:36:27] Avera lacked will not be fooled by the
[1:36:29] mark of the beast
[1:36:30] the temptation will come as files I've
[1:36:32] always loved those words the temptation
[1:36:35] will come as files
[1:36:35] we're told exactly how it's going to
[1:36:37] come we know exactly how the mark of the
[1:36:42] beast is going to come we don't have to
[1:36:43] guess we know exactly how it's gonna
[1:36:45] happen
[1:36:45] the ecumenical move that's all the
[1:36:48] churches grew joining together that it
[1:36:49] started on what seems such a beautiful
[1:36:51] and blessed principle fulfilling Christ
[1:36:53] prayer that we all might be one become
[1:36:55] so strong politically so in other words
[1:36:59] the churches are going to be backing up
[1:37:01] the government so you watch Trump right
[1:37:04] you watch the next president of God
[1:37:06] Terry's you watch they're going to
[1:37:08] become buddy-buddy the church is now the
[1:37:10] denominational churches the false
[1:37:11] churches are going to become buddy-buddy
[1:37:13] with the government this is how it has
[1:37:15] to come it has to come this way because
[1:37:18] the church will bear pressure upon the
[1:37:20] government to cause all to join with her
[1:37:22] either directly or through adherence the
[1:37:25] principles and act in the law that no
[1:37:27] people we recognize as actual churches
[1:37:29] unless under direct or indirect
[1:37:31] domination of this council so see it has
[1:37:35] to come that way it has to become the
[1:37:36] church's putting pressure upon the
[1:37:38] government and the government taking
[1:37:40] heat of that pressure to lay down the
[1:37:42] law where you can't buy or sell without
[1:37:44] the mark of the beast so we know who are
[1:37:48] enemies are our enemies are actually the
[1:37:50] false churches it's Satan in the false
[1:37:52] churches that's who our enemies are
[1:37:54] but have said that he said your worst
[1:37:56] enemy is Rome he said though because
[1:37:58] Rome his memory Rome is at the bottom of
[1:38:00] the image the great image that Daniel
[1:38:02] saw Rome was at the bottom she's ayran
[1:38:04] they were understand that's the greatest
[1:38:07] enemy is that iron church the Roman
[1:38:09] Catholic Church she's the greatest enemy
[1:38:10] she don't look like her right now cuz
[1:38:12] brother BAM said member her powers
[1:38:13] waning but she's gonna get it back she's
[1:38:16] gonna get it back right here when she
[1:38:18] calls in the bonds and forces a force to
[1:38:21] the gold standard again oh my little
[1:38:26] groups will lose Chartres privileges
[1:38:28] cetera until they lose all property and
[1:38:30] spiritual rights with the people for
[1:38:31] example right now unless the local
[1:38:33] Ministerial Association approves and
[1:38:34] many if not most cities one cannot rent
[1:38:36] a building for religious services to
[1:38:40] become chaplains in the armed services
[1:38:41] hospitals etc is now almost mandatory to
[1:38:43] be recognized as acceptable to the
[1:38:45] trinitarian economical groups as this
[1:38:49] pressure increases and it will it will
[1:38:51] be harder to resist for it to resistance
[1:38:52] to lose privilege and so many will be
[1:38:54] tempted to go along for they fear it is
[1:38:57] better to serve God publicly in the
[1:38:58] framework of this organization than not
[1:39:01] to serve God at all publicly but they
[1:39:05] air to believe the devil's lies to serve
[1:39:07] Satan even though you may want to call
[1:39:09] Joe Houma but the elect will not to be
[1:39:12] deceived
[1:39:12] Amen that's how it's going to come the
[1:39:15] churches are gonna put so much pressure
[1:39:17] that on Trump or whoever the next
[1:39:19] president is Oprah like we saw this week
[1:39:21] whoever the next president is it doesn't
[1:39:23] matter the church is going to get so in
[1:39:26] in cahoots with the government that
[1:39:27] they're gonna convince the government to
[1:39:29] lay down the mark you can't be a real
[1:39:31] Church you lose all privileges unless
[1:39:33] you agree to our doctrine and our
[1:39:35] standards that's how it's going to come
[1:39:37] it has to come that way furthermore the
[1:39:40] elect will not only be kept but as this
[1:39:42] move becomes the image directed to the
[1:39:44] Beast
[1:39:44] the Saints will be gone in the rapture
[1:39:46] amen Lori see we won't see it actually
[1:39:49] become that won't see its work its way
[1:39:51] into it we won't actually see that
[1:39:52] because memory that can't happen until
[1:39:55] Satan comes down and saying can't come
[1:39:57] down all the way to the bride goes up
[1:39:59] right because the Bible
[1:40:01] second Thessalonians 2 only he will let
[1:40:03] until be until he be taken out of the
[1:40:06] way and then that unholy one that
[1:40:08] Antichrist will be revealed the Bible
[1:40:10] says he can't be revealed until he the
[1:40:14] Holy Ghost in the church should be taken
[1:40:15] away that's right that's the scripture
[1:40:19] and this little delightful winsome
[1:40:22] movement that started out in the
[1:40:23] fellowship at Ephesus will become the
[1:40:24] monster of Satan that defiles and
[1:40:27] deceives the whole world for the church
[1:40:29] system of the Roman Catholic in the
[1:40:30] process is coming together will control
[1:40:32] the whole wealth of the world system and
[1:40:33] force the whole earth into its religious
[1:40:36] trap or will kill them by refusing them
[1:40:38] the privilege of buying or selling
[1:40:39] whereby they would make a living how
[1:40:43] many people do you know if raise your
[1:40:45] hands well how many people would say if
[1:40:46] they said oh you believe Baptist you
[1:40:47] don't believe in the Trinity you're
[1:40:48] gonna lose your job Hardy people would
[1:40:50] say ok I'll find another job or they
[1:40:54] said mr. Smith you have to teach
[1:40:56] homosexuality is OK would I be willing
[1:40:59] to say ok where do I sign to leave
[1:41:02] where's the door I really have to ask
[1:41:05] where is the door I don't know where the
[1:41:07] door is
[1:41:08] but would we do we have that kind of
[1:41:10] faith right now where we could walk away
[1:41:13] and say fine I'll leave it I'll have to
[1:41:16] put my hands in God I have to have a
[1:41:17] little patience in God after that God
[1:41:21] exercised some patience in me we got to
[1:41:23] be willing to do that I've often thought
[1:41:25] about that in California they you know
[1:41:26] they have curriculums where or I've
[1:41:28] heard about at least I haven't seen it
[1:41:29] but everything starts west and heads
[1:41:31] east at least in this nation they have
[1:41:33] curriculums where preschools are
[1:41:34] teaching it's ok to have two dads ok to
[1:41:36] have two moms and that ever comes here
[1:41:38] and I'm forced to preach it I got to
[1:41:39] make a decision and I'll have to I'll
[1:41:42] just say sorry Copley I'm taking the way
[1:41:44] with the Lords of spies whew yeah this
[1:41:47] you have to do that you have to either
[1:41:48] take God or take the enemy yeah you have
[1:41:51] to make a choice this will be
[1:41:53] accomplished simply for the harlots
[1:41:54] daughters are all but gone back to her
[1:41:56] we've seen that remember that video few
[1:42:00] years ago what's that guy's name that
[1:42:02] famous preacher real rich guy can't
[1:42:06] think his name I can't think of him but
[1:42:06] he was saying he was saying the
[1:42:08] Reformation is over remember that a few
[1:42:09] years ago the Reformation is over in
[1:42:11] other words I'm sorry that the
[1:42:13] Protestant move is over
[1:42:15] there's no more protesting the Pope we
[1:42:17] all believe justification is by faith
[1:42:19] and not by works what's that guy's name
[1:42:23] no he's friends with him though that's a
[1:42:27] good guess it's an older guy I officer
[1:42:31] texted to you it's the guy this guy who
[1:42:33] speaks in tongues a lot but it never
[1:42:34] gets any interpretation ah okay members
[1:42:37] name he has his own private jet
[1:42:38] camp members named Kenneth Copeland
[1:42:41] that's it right there thank you sister
[1:42:42] its Kenneth Copeland now I hate to call
[1:42:44] names but you understand I'm not I'm
[1:42:46] just saying they're off Kenneth Copeland
[1:42:48] went up before all his congregation and
[1:42:50] said the Reformation is over there's no
[1:42:52] more protesting he in other words he's
[1:42:54] saying our Catholic friends are our
[1:42:55] brothers we can't say that because they
[1:43:01] are under idolatry woman worship there
[1:43:04] know all these things we can't say
[1:43:05] they're not our brothers will we pray
[1:43:07] for them sure brother Branham prayed for
[1:43:09] Catholics can some of them be saved
[1:43:11] yes but they've got to come out of that
[1:43:13] system you cannot believe you cannot be
[1:43:17] an eye doctor and be saved
[1:43:18] praise God you cannot be possessed of a
[1:43:21] cage of unclean and hateful bird and be
[1:43:23] saved the call is to come out of her my
[1:43:26] people that's the call you've got to
[1:43:28] come out revelation 18:4
[1:43:30] but he's already announced that that was
[1:43:32] a couple years ago it's thick it's
[1:43:33] trickling down of course you see another
[1:43:35] denominations now we've seen Joel
[1:43:37] Olsteen since that we called the name
[1:43:38] we've seen him on interviews he says I
[1:43:41] will not preach against homosexuality
[1:43:42] because I don't want to lose peopIe
[1:43:44] don't want to offend people hurt people
[1:43:45] he said I would gladly attend a
[1:43:47] homosexual marriage see a true man of
[1:43:50] God will not bless sin a true man of God
[1:43:54] will not will not make a license for
[1:43:57] immorality for a true man of God will
[1:43:59] rebuke sin but we're not being
[1:44:02] judgmental but we're just saying I'm not
[1:44:04] I don't know where they're gonna end
[1:44:04] that's being judgmental I don't know if
[1:44:06] they're going to heaven or hell I'm not
[1:44:08] the judge I'm not being judgmental but I
[1:44:10] am judging their words I am judging
[1:44:13] doctrine because it's false and that's
[1:44:14] what I'm called to do amen rightly
[1:44:17] divide the word of truth the Bible said
[1:44:19] I'm called to judge their false doctrine
[1:44:22] now their souls I'm not called to judge
[1:44:23] that that's between them and God now
[1:44:26] here's where he said
[1:44:27] in the meantime Roma is acquired nearly
[1:44:30] all the supplies of gold the Jews have
[1:44:33] the bonds and all the paper at the right
[1:44:34] time the harlot the Roman Catholic
[1:44:36] Church will destroy the present-day
[1:44:37] money system by calling in all the paper
[1:44:39] and demanding gold with no gold the
[1:44:44] system Falls the Jews will be trapped
[1:44:46] and come into the Lions and the harlot
[1:44:48] Church will take over the whole world
[1:44:49] aren't you glad you know what's gonna
[1:44:51] happen in the future aren't you glad we
[1:44:54] know it's gonna happen and it all lines
[1:44:56] up with revelation 13 Yusef 3 DREV
[1:44:57] elation 13 it all lines up there how it
[1:45:01] all comes down now let's finish with
[1:45:04] this here I got I got seven more minutes
[1:45:05] on my watch let's finish that I
[1:45:07] appreciate our see hours aren't that
[1:45:10] long is it not that long did you learn
[1:45:13] patience in this hour sure you did it
[1:45:15] was worth coming tonight whether you've
[1:45:17] heard all this before you know all this
[1:45:19] is it's not how much we know it's how
[1:45:21] much we're living varies god it's how
[1:45:24] close we're living to Christ now went
[1:45:26] over this briefly earlier in the series
[1:45:27] but let's just go over it again oh we
[1:45:29] have a word first all at this time it is
[1:45:31] hold fast persevere don't give up put on
[1:45:34] the whole armor of God use every weapon
[1:45:36] he's given us use every gift at our
[1:45:38] disposal look ahead with joy because we
[1:45:40] were going to be crowned by him who's
[1:45:42] King and kings and Lord of lords now he
[1:45:45] is not only giving crowns but he says
[1:45:47] that these in the bride will be made
[1:45:49] pillars in the temple of God but what is
[1:45:52] the temple what is the temple of God
[1:45:53] Jesus spoke of his body as being the
[1:45:56] temple it was it was the temple of God
[1:45:59] but now that we are his body the true
[1:46:01] church is the temple of God by the Holy
[1:46:03] Ghost within us now he is going to make
[1:46:06] the overcomer a pillar in that temple
[1:46:08] but what is a pillar a pillar is
[1:46:11] actually part of the foundation for it
[1:46:12] holds up the superstructure praise God
[1:46:15] that puts the overcomer right in there
[1:46:17] with the apostles and prophets for it
[1:46:19] says in Ephesians 2:19 2:22 let's read
[1:46:22] that Asians to 19 and 22 I'm gonna go
[1:46:25] there in my on my iPad Asians to 1922 I
[1:46:33] preached on this
[1:46:35] a couple months ago now therefore ye are
[1:46:39] no more strangers and foreigners but
[1:46:41] fellow-citizens with the Saints of the
[1:46:43] household of God and are built upon the
[1:46:45] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:46:47] Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
[1:46:49] Cornerstone
[1:46:50] you see we're built upon them see Paul
[1:46:54] was our foundation but I'm on I'm a
[1:46:57] little higher up there I lived a little
[1:46:59] later than Paul I'm not better than him
[1:47:02] but he's my foundation praise God and
[1:47:05] I'm on top of him I'm built upon him I'm
[1:47:08] built upon his preaching I preached the
[1:47:11] same thing he preaches amen hallelujah
[1:47:13] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:47:16] together groweth unto a holy temple the
[1:47:18] Lord in whom also ye are builded
[1:47:20] together for a habitation of God through
[1:47:23] the spirit amen
[1:47:25] we are God's house we are God's dwelling
[1:47:27] place don't you feel that as many times
[1:47:29] I walk into church I can just feel the
[1:47:31] presence of God already here do you ever
[1:47:32] feel that the sweetness of the Holy
[1:47:34] Spirit why because we are the habitation
[1:47:37] of God we should expect to feel God's
[1:47:39] presence here amen we should expect it
[1:47:42] we are his habitation yes that verse 22
[1:47:45] says that we are builded together with
[1:47:48] them everything went through the door
[1:47:50] Jesus and as part of the body or temple
[1:47:52] now when God puts a man the temple as a
[1:47:54] pillar and makes him a part of that
[1:47:56] foundation group what is he doing he's
[1:47:58] giving him the revelation of the word
[1:48:00] and of himself because that is exactly
[1:48:03] what the apostles and prophets had
[1:48:05] Matthew 16:17
[1:48:07] there he is in that word there he stands
[1:48:09] no one can get him out hey man
[1:48:12] now ponder that word over cometh John
[1:48:16] asks the question who is he that
[1:48:17] overcometh and the answer comes right
[1:48:20] back he that believed Jesus is the
[1:48:23] Christ he doesn't say that the
[1:48:25] overcomers the one that believes in a
[1:48:27] jesus and an a Christ but believes that
[1:48:30] Jesus is the Christ one person not two
[1:48:34] he is the one who is baptized in the
[1:48:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:48:40] all right I got three minutes all right
[1:48:42] let me finish this God is talking about
[1:48:45] the bride here do you want to see
[1:48:46] another picture of her it is over
[1:48:48] revelation 7 4 to 17 now put two notes
[1:48:53] on here I may spend just a whole sermon
[1:48:56] on this so in the church age book member
[1:49:00] brother Branham I read an article that
[1:49:01] said brother Branham write over this
[1:49:03] book 15 times before he printed it 15
[1:49:07] times so in this book the Prophet said
[1:49:11] revelation 7 4 to 17 is the bride let's
[1:49:16] read it
[1:49:16] revelation 7 for now I've had numerous
[1:49:23] ministers over the years talked to me
[1:49:24] about this and some of it's always ended
[1:49:27] well but some of them got kind of upset
[1:49:28] when we talked about it because I
[1:49:30] believe revelation 7 4 to 17 is the
[1:49:32] bride they believed it was the foolish
[1:49:34] virgin and so church it's really nothing
[1:49:36] get upset about we're splitting my were
[1:49:38] splitting hairs here is this a doctor
[1:49:41] that pertains to salvation absolutely
[1:49:43] not
[1:49:43] that's why it kind of hurts when people
[1:49:44] get upset over little things like this
[1:49:46] we can't get upset over little things we
[1:49:48] got to have patience with each other we
[1:49:50] got have you gotta have patience right
[1:49:52] we can't get impatient say you don't
[1:49:54] believe it the way I do you're wrong
[1:49:57] I'd fight you if I could but God won't
[1:49:59] let me see that's the wrong attitude
[1:50:00] there you know you don't want to fight
[1:50:04] Matt it's you know in a fighting spirit
[1:50:05] you want to fight the devil you want to
[1:50:07] fight God's family revelation 7 for now
[1:50:11] verses we're gonna skip 4 to 8 because
[1:50:13] you can read it those are the chose
[1:50:14] 144,000 Jews 12,000 from every tribe now
[1:50:18] verse 9 to 17 is the bride brother bran
[1:50:20] tells us now I have three times he calls
[1:50:22] to the bride one time he calls it
[1:50:24] foolish virgin so I just believe it's
[1:50:27] the bride let's just read it after this
[1:50:30] I beheld and lo a great multitude which
[1:50:32] no man could number of all nations so it
[1:50:34] has to be Gentiles so it's either
[1:50:35] Gentile foolish version or Gentile wise
[1:50:38] version it's not just Jews it's all
[1:50:40] nations and Kindred's and people and
[1:50:42] tongues stood before the throne now this
[1:50:44] is important they stood before the
[1:50:46] throne remember the New Jerusalem has no
[1:50:50] throne and before the lamb clothed with
[1:50:54] white robes and palms in her hands and
[1:50:56] cried with a loud voice saying salvation
[1:50:58] to our God which sitteth upon the throne
[1:51:00] and unto the lamb and
[1:51:02] the Angels stood round about the throne
[1:51:03] and about the elders and the four beasts
[1:51:05] and fell before the throne on their
[1:51:07] faces and worshipped God now Church if
[1:51:10] we can't humble ourselves on this side
[1:51:12] how are we gonna make it to that side
[1:51:14] if we can't sometimes get on our face
[1:51:16] and home and your prayer closet if you
[1:51:18] can't get on your face and crowd to God
[1:51:20] how you gonna make it to heaven because
[1:51:21] there's people there that are on their
[1:51:23] faces crying out to God praising God
[1:51:25] they're so humble they fall on their
[1:51:27] faces before God how much humbler should
[1:51:29] we be Church we should have the fear of
[1:51:32] the Lord see these people had the fear
[1:51:34] Lord because they're in the presence of
[1:51:35] the Lord but we should have it here
[1:51:37] because we should feel his presence here
[1:51:39] look look how much humility there is in
[1:51:42] heaven we must be more humble verse 12
[1:51:46] saying Amen blessing in glory and honor
[1:51:48] and Thanksgiving and honour and power
[1:51:50] might be unto our God for ever and ever
[1:51:52] amen and one of the elders answered said
[1:51:54] to me what are these which are way too
[1:51:55] right robes and whence came they
[1:51:57] and I said to him Sir thou knowest so he
[1:52:00] didn't know he said the angel asked him
[1:52:02] he says I don't know do you know do you
[1:52:05] know and he said to me these are they
[1:52:07] which came out of Great Tribulation and
[1:52:09] have washed their robes and made them
[1:52:11] white in the blood of the Lamb now see
[1:52:14] most people look at that and say oh
[1:52:15] there was Great Tribulation it has to be
[1:52:16] the Great Tribulation Period but three
[1:52:18] times real ramsett was the bride one
[1:52:20] time he says it was a foolish virgin
[1:52:21] I just want to read you the quotes
[1:52:24] either way these are blessed people how
[1:52:26] many can say amen to that either way
[1:52:28] they're blessed people to stand before
[1:52:29] the lamb with palms and their hands
[1:52:32] praising some of them are on their faces
[1:52:33] they're falling down praising God a
[1:52:36] multitude can you imagine a multitude
[1:52:37] all shouting and praising God if there
[1:52:40] could be chose up our spines there there
[1:52:42] will be I don't know if there will be
[1:52:44] praise God
[1:52:45] he's about perfect bodies but just the
[1:52:48] the atmosphere there will be beyond
[1:52:50] belief amen hallelujah
[1:52:54] he says therefore are they before the
[1:52:58] throne of God and serve Him day and
[1:52:59] night in the temple now Birmingham says
[1:53:01] he serve he said that's who serves them
[1:53:03] who serves the husband but the wife who
[1:53:05] makes my meals every day my precious
[1:53:07] wife she serves me every day day and
[1:53:09] night she serves me she serves me when
[1:53:12] my children get sick I get the lay in
[1:53:13] bed she has to get up and serve me
[1:53:16] you know unfortunately you know I know
[1:53:17] it's not it was not always easy for the
[1:53:19] wife but she serves me when I'm saying
[1:53:21] it she serves me day and night and he
[1:53:26] that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
[1:53:28] among them they shall hunger no more
[1:53:31] neither shall thirst any more neither
[1:53:32] shall the Sun light on them nor any heat
[1:53:36] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[1:53:38] the throne shall feed them and shall
[1:53:39] lead them unto living living fountains
[1:53:43] of waters and God shall wipe away all
[1:53:44] tears from their eyes now did you notice
[1:53:46] Church in verse 16 the Sun is still
[1:53:48] shining did you notice that so this
[1:53:51] cannot be the New Jerusalem because in
[1:53:54] the New Jerusalem there's no more Sun
[1:53:56] right we've been Hosea I've been talking
[1:53:58] about that so that's why I'm looking at
[1:53:59] it we've been talking other there's no
[1:54:00] Sun in the New Jerusalem so this has to
[1:54:03] be before the new heavens and new earth
[1:54:05] that means this has to be before the
[1:54:07] white throne judgment and that means
[1:54:11] this has to be probably in the
[1:54:12] Millennium or the marriage supper of the
[1:54:14] Lamb and by the RAM said the foolish
[1:54:16] version does not have a part at the
[1:54:18] marriage supper of lamb or the
[1:54:19] Millennium that's why I believe this
[1:54:23] cannot be the foolish version but the
[1:54:24] RAM said worst yet he said she's in the
[1:54:26] grave the first version is in the grave
[1:54:28] and I don't know what that means but if
[1:54:31] she don't have the Holy Ghost while
[1:54:32] she's on earth she will not be at the
[1:54:34] marriage supper she will not be in the
[1:54:35] Millennium because it's only for those
[1:54:37] who overcome and she did not overcome
[1:54:41] and get born again oh how we need to get
[1:54:43] born again praise God
[1:54:45] how we need to know that we're born
[1:54:47] again because we're overcomers now
[1:54:50] here's the here's here's brother hams
[1:54:52] comment to the church age book now I
[1:54:53] went over an hour there's my timer let
[1:54:55] me give give me five more minutes Jesus
[1:54:57] has come he has sealed 144,000 he's
[1:55:00] taken $12 on each tribe but there's
[1:55:02] another group that doesn't belong in
[1:55:03] this hundred forty four thousand seen in
[1:55:05] verses nine eighteen who are they these
[1:55:07] are in the bride taken from amongst the
[1:55:11] Gentiles they are before his throne day
[1:55:13] and night they serve Him in the temple
[1:55:14] they are the special care of the Lord
[1:55:16] they are his bride the bride goes member
[1:55:20] the bridegroom is she will never be left
[1:55:22] by him she will never leave his side
[1:55:23] she will share the throne with him she
[1:55:25] will be crowned with his glory and honor
[1:55:29] now the only quote brother have said
[1:55:31] foolish virgin is in the seventh seal
[1:55:32] and so the brothers had contacted me
[1:55:35] they kind of got upset said how can you
[1:55:36] believe that brother man said the seven
[1:55:37] seals were the most inspired sermons
[1:55:39] ever preached that might be true but
[1:55:41] brother Ham still made mistakes in the
[1:55:43] seven seals remember he said there only
[1:55:45] be seven hundred instead of seven
[1:55:47] thousand member he kept saying that over
[1:55:49] and over and they kept asking him as
[1:55:50] their 700 or seven thousand seven
[1:55:52] hundred he made mistakes not every word
[1:55:55] was thus saith the Lord but every
[1:55:57] revelation from God was thus saith the
[1:55:59] Lord just like in the marriage and
[1:56:03] divorce brother BAM said it was the
[1:56:04] state Lord from beginning to end
[1:56:06] oh no he said all the way through but he
[1:56:09] made mistakes in marriage and divorce he
[1:56:10] said Jacob had it more than a dozen
[1:56:12] wives but Jacob only had four wives you
[1:56:15] could prove that by the Bible so brother
[1:56:17] Aaron doesn't mean every word all the
[1:56:19] way through he means every revelation
[1:56:21] all the way through because you can't
[1:56:24] say all the way through and make a
[1:56:25] mistake you can't say that so he means
[1:56:27] all the revelations all the way through
[1:56:29] our thus saith the Lord so you gotta be
[1:56:32] careful how you interpret the stay at
[1:56:34] the Lord as well so this is the seventh
[1:56:36] seal he says now here was the purposes
[1:56:38] the first thing was that sleep inversion
[1:56:39] had to go through the tribulation period
[1:56:40] for purification she had to be purged of
[1:56:43] her sins of unbelief and rejecting the
[1:56:44] message this she was done in the
[1:56:47] tribulation period we see they wind up
[1:56:49] over here in Revelation 7 between the
[1:56:52] 6th and 7th chapter here that she has
[1:56:54] been purged and she'd been given her
[1:56:56] robes that's the only quote where
[1:56:57] brother Branham says this is the foolish
[1:56:58] version I already read you one in the
[1:57:00] church book here's the second one this
[1:57:01] is from questions and answer 64 and this
[1:57:04] was in what month was it okay August so
[1:57:08] this is a year and five months after he
[1:57:10] preached the seventh seal brother
[1:57:11] Branham says it's the wise virgin will
[1:57:14] the prophet of Malachi 4 be the one that
[1:57:16] called the Gentile remnant of revelation
[1:57:18] 7:9 even though they go through the
[1:57:19] Tribulation Period no after revelation 7
[1:57:22] is where we've seen the 144,000 sealed
[1:57:25] and after that he saw coming up coming
[1:57:27] back was that great number which no man
[1:57:28] could number which was the bride Malachi
[1:57:32] 4 would be finished and bride be taken
[1:57:34] up and then this group of Elijah and
[1:57:36] Elijah return back to the earth the
[1:57:38] church to go through the tribulation
[1:57:39] period but Elijah Elijah will not have
[1:57:41] anything to do with the sleeping virgin
[1:57:42] there
[1:57:43] they'll only be sent to the Jews so
[1:57:46] there's the second quote there's two
[1:57:47] quotes the brother Graham said it's the
[1:57:48] bride the last one let's send our feet
[1:57:51] out cuz I gotta close this is from okay
[1:57:56] this is from 1960 this is from the
[1:57:58] church age series this is one I heard
[1:58:00] last week when I was listening to the
[1:58:01] sermon he said there's 144,000 now if
[1:58:04] you want to see the bride come up after
[1:58:07] that to show that the hundred forty-four
[1:58:08] thousand is not the bride just continue
[1:58:11] to read on down now he says I mean from
[1:58:15] the seventh he said I mean from the
[1:58:16] seventh chapter let's serve the ninth
[1:58:17] verse and he reads on down he says what
[1:58:21] does your wife do she serves you in the
[1:58:23] house you sit down she gives you your
[1:58:26] food she fixes your clothing see she
[1:58:30] serves you day and night in your house
[1:58:31] see and this one these of all nations
[1:58:34] and Gentiles which is the bride and
[1:58:35] before the throne of God with him day
[1:58:37] and night I'll remember what we said
[1:58:39] last night and we walked on it that's
[1:58:42] why we talked on it everybody loved the
[1:58:44] Lord tonight
[1:58:45] praise the Lord let's close with that by
[1:58:47] God's grace the Bible said there before
[1:58:52] him before the throne of God they serve
[1:58:54] Him day and night in his temple he that
[1:58:56] sitteth on the throne should dwell among
[1:58:58] them they shall hunger no more thirst no
[1:59:00] more no sunlight will be on them nor any
[1:59:03] Heat for the land which is in the midst
[1:59:06] of the throne shall feed them and shall
[1:59:08] lead them unto living fountains of
[1:59:12] waters and God shall wipe away all tears
[1:59:14] from their eyes amen
[1:59:17] what a promise we have Church can we
[1:59:20] even begin to imagine this blessing no
[1:59:22] we can't I you know often when I pray
[1:59:24] here at the church I imagine Jesus he's
[1:59:27] got his white wig on he's got his white
[1:59:29] robe and he's sitting on his throne can
[1:59:32] we imagine standing before his throne
[1:59:34] and never leave his side day and night
[1:59:36] can you imagine that there is going to
[1:59:39] be a people from Laodicea that will live
[1:59:42] lives that are worthy the gospel that
[1:59:44] will stand before Christ day and night
[1:59:46] in his temple a church if you and I have
[1:59:49] patience we can be one of them hey that
[1:59:53] we can just wait a little longer on God
[1:59:56] don't give up in patience you possess
[2:00:00] your salvation in patience you possess
[2:00:03] your soul and the soul is the only thing
[2:00:05] you're taking with you I'm going to take
[2:00:07] a righteous soul with you
[2:00:09] praise God let's just our heads here for
[2:00:11] a few moments Heavenly Father thank you
[2:00:15] Lord for tonight Lord I've gone a little
[2:00:16] longer Lord part of me we pray a little
[2:00:18] longer Lord but we're so grateful Lord
[2:00:21] for the things we've sung tonight the
[2:00:23] true songs we've sung tonight
[2:00:25] we're grateful for the word we've heard
[2:00:27] tonight and Lord something supernatural
[2:00:31] definitely happened here tonight if
[2:00:34] nothing else the true bride the true
[2:00:37] people of God have learned to be more
[2:00:40] patient they've learned to wait another
[2:00:43] week on you they've learned to wait
