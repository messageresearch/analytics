[11:39] let's take a few of us here by God's
[11:42] grace brother I talked with bill a man
[11:49] will probably double you our last song
[11:51] and then we'll get right to the
[11:52] preaching just to preserve time I really
[11:54] got to do a better job on that
[11:55] and so musicians if you'd like to take a
[11:57] seat you can thank you went out nice to
[12:00] hear cam and brother Brooks say what
[12:02] what an improvement they've heard and
[12:04] though in the worship ministry here so
[12:07] thank the Lord for that I agreed just
[12:10] having me as a song leader without any
[12:11] musicians that was an awful awful but
[12:15] God is thankful God is faithful so thank
[12:20] the Lord for that amen you know you're
[12:23] burning your wife typing out all those
[12:25] songs and everything like that we really
[12:26] appreciate all the efforts there of
[12:29] course knock on Lydia thank you for all
[12:31] you do as well praise the Lord
[12:34] coming off of special meetings I'm just
[12:37] happy to be in the house of Lord you
[12:48] mean to the Holy Spirit as I told you I
[12:50] was so thankful that's nice I think Oh
[12:53] grace verses but every every group of
[12:56] meetings has a highlight service and so
[12:58] I think that was the highlight for us
[12:59] just to see that great move of the Holy
[13:01] Spirit
[13:03] everybody yielding was such a wonderful
[13:06] thing I was so blessed by that and I
[13:08] think the Lord for a church that can
[13:10] yield like that I was I was so thankful
[13:13] because Moran says it's clear the
[13:16] atmosphere brings all the results yeah
[13:19] and now but him and I were talking know
[13:21] sometimes the atmosphere has to be after
[13:23] everybody leaves and then atmosphere can
[13:26] fall so it just depends on the time and
[13:28] season yeah I was really good point but
[13:30] I remember that that was an excellent
[13:32] point sometimes you know people are just
[13:35] busy and they need to get out and that's
[13:37] great but then people can stay in and
[13:40] still have that atmosphere that was an
[13:43] excellent point but I appreciate you
[13:44] sharing that so we're thankful whenever
[13:47] a child of God gets blessed we're all
[13:50] blessed amen so we're so thankful for
[13:52] all God has done for us let's take a few
[13:55] bur quests have one announcement we have
[13:57] a will do a carry in on June 21st so in
[14:00] two Sundays will do a carry in between

[14:08] give me a moment or give me a night and
[14:10] I'll text it Lord willing tomorrow well
[14:13] let's do a carry in we're all back
[14:14] together looks like everybody's healthy
[14:16] and over a hundred I think a hundred
[14:18] days of this coronavirus and I thank the
[14:22] Lord he's protecting us and every
[14:24] message believer I know from the
[14:26] pastor's I've talked to that have gotten
[14:28] it they've all been healed and thank the
[14:31] Lord for that thank God for His grace
[14:33] and His mercy we serve a mighty God and
[14:38] I'm just so thankful from God done no I
[14:41] and I took says but I was nervous at the
[14:43] beginning I mean who wasn't
[14:45] I started told them the first few
[14:47] services we tried to do the six feet and
[14:49] I remember you know I remember Naomi's
[14:51] family there and I tried to Naomi nature
[14:53] I tried to I tried to measure that six
[14:55] feet away you know I was just trying I'm
[14:57] just trying to keep my six feet but
[14:59] after about three weeks I'm like I think
[15:00] we're all right you know but it was just
[15:03] uncertain thing and now things are more
[15:07] certain so we're thankful for God's
[15:09] grace the first part right

[26:00] Brooks to stop talking and didn't want
[26:03] canvas top preach
[26:04] amen now that was a great testimony and
[26:07] and so I want to just go over that again
[26:10] and share some more things from the
[26:13] scripture cam had mentioned that you
[26:15] know he learned through my preaching I'm
[26:18] not propping up myself but from Maya
[26:21] preaching now everybody has to see in
[26:23] here when something happens to a
[26:25] Christian yes and that's from the Bible
[26:27] so I want to go over that tonight I'm
[26:29] gonna call this the scene here principle
[26:32] from Acts - I believe it's is it 23 or
[26:36] 32 33 okay yeah thank you
[26:40] I want to look at tonight I believe
[26:43] it'll be a help to you would be a
[26:44] blessing acts 233 thanks maokai Lydia
[26:50] for that if you've ever seen a baby born
[26:59] naturally I'm not naturally you can
[27:02] always see it and hear it right yeah
[27:05] anytime a natural baby is born I've seen
[27:08] seven of them bore one more Lord willing
[27:11] a couple months here you can always see
[27:14] it being born cuz it emerges right and
[27:17] then you can hear it that is born and so
[27:21] brother Branham always uses that same
[27:23] principle to the baptism with the Holy
[27:26] Ghost which is Scripture
[27:28] yes let's read this together and then
[27:30] we'll read our memory verse brother amen
[27:33] well you have to forgive me I forgot
[27:35] where we where was your memory verse
[27:37] from yeah okay yeah that's right five
[27:40] right
[27:42] yeah I'm sorry 514 223 anything yeah I'm
[27:45] sorry just sublime I you know we didn't
[27:48] do it all weekend so forget it
[27:50] let's read this together because this is
[27:52] just one scripture then we'll read our
[27:53] memory verse on three one two three
[27:55] therefore being by the right hand of God
[27:59] exalted and having received of the fáák
[28:03] trunks of the Holy Ghost
[28:06] he had shed forth this which he now see
[28:09] and here so wasn't walking up like my
[28:13] man he makes the joke all the time he
[28:15] said it wasn't walking up to the priest
[28:16] and getting a wafer in your mouth and
[28:18] you know putting up ashes on your
[28:20] forehead yeah like a late night it
[28:22] wasn't that it was an actual experience
[28:26] with God amen like they they had so they
[28:29] were filled with God that they acted and
[28:31] expressed something amen and people saw
[28:34] it it was it was so real that caused
[28:37] them to somehow respond okay now that
[28:41] the the air of Pentecost is that it has
[28:45] to be a tongue but the revelation from
[28:48] the Bible is that it can be anything
[28:51] anything you can see in here that's the
[28:54] revelation of the Bible right so now
[28:59] let's go to the memory verse here first
[29:01] Thessalonians 5 14 beautiful portion of
[29:07] Scripture so let's do our memory verse
[29:20] here then we'll have you be seated
[29:25] 1st Thessalonians 5
[29:27] I think it's 13 to 23 that's right after
[29:30] all 14 23 okay thank you sir yeah that's
[29:34] okay no it's okay remember bank had a
[29:36] rule on when the Beatitudes really
[29:38] that's good summer shorter somewhere
[29:40] along there wait till I do mine is gonna
[29:43] be a whole chapter whatever the Lord
[29:53] puts upon our hearts right my prayer is
[29:56] Jesus write it upon the fleshy tables in
[29:58] my heart and let in hours of trial I'll
[30:01] quote something from that yeah remember
[30:04] God is my fortress amen
[30:06] you know God is my strength in
[30:08] everything give thanks for this is the
[30:10] will of God in Christ Jesus
[30:12] thank the Lord alright let's read 13 to
[30:15] 23 on three one two three and two esteem
[30:18] them very highly in love for their works
[30:22] sake and be at peace among yourselves
[30:25] now we exhort you brethren warn them
[30:29] that are unruly comfort the
[30:31] feeble-minded support the weak be
[30:34] patient toward all men see that none
[30:37] render evil for evil unto any man but
[30:41] ever follow that which is good both
[30:44] among yourselves and to all men rejoice
[30:48] evermore pray without ceasing in
[30:51] everything give thanks for this is the
[30:55] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[30:57] you quench not the spirit despise not
[31:01] prophesying --zz prove all things hold
[31:04] fast
[31:05] which is good abstain from all
[31:08] appearance of evil and the very God of
[31:11] peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God
[31:14] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[31:18] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[31:21] our Lord Jesus Christ may God add His
[31:24] blessings arenas work may be seated
[31:26] praise God
[31:27] thank you again appreciate it very much
[31:29] here I had just a few guides my phone
[31:33] wasn't working here I was trying to
[31:35] update this app but it's not working
[31:38] here so let me just try to restart it
[31:41] and then I'll pull it up in just a
[31:42] minute okay so I like to look at this
[31:44] subject here the subject is the sea and
[31:48] here principle of Acts 233 and it's very
[31:54] important topic it's extremely important
[31:57] and needed I think this is one of the
[32:01] biggest sins of the church world today
[32:05] is that they will and my wife can tell
[32:08] you you know she what she and I were
[32:09] both in like college ministries right
[32:13] College Christian campus ministries and
[32:15] they just taught us to death just just
[32:18] get him to say a prayer and they're
[32:19] filled with the Holy Ghost like my wife
[32:21] even spent a summer out there for Campus
[32:25] Crusade talking to people like that you
[32:28] know and trying to get them to say the
[32:30] sinner's prayer and try to get them to
[32:34] believe in Jesus and it and you know got
[32:39] and then God then right around that time
[32:40] opened our eyes that you have to do more
[32:43] than just believe you've got to have
[32:46] this seal of the Holy Ghost and it's one
[32:49] of the biggest mistakes the church makes
[32:52] today is that they say oh you said a
[32:54] sinner's prayer
[32:55] now you're filled with the Holy Ghost it
[32:57] was really sad a few years ago we had a
[32:59] guest preacher come in to our Bible club
[33:02] and he was telling kindergarteners 1st
[33:04] 2nd 3rd and 4th that if they've said a
[33:06] prayer they have the Holy Ghost and they
[33:08] can do greater miracles than Jesus I was
[33:11] like this I was like oh lord have mercy
[33:14] because they just misunderstand the word
[33:17] yeah well I just had to bow my head and
[33:19] say Lord thankfully I can preach next
[33:22] week and try to straighten it out yeah
[33:25] and I did so that's the air of it is
[33:29] that it's so it's so wrong they're
[33:33] telling people they have power when they
[33:35] don't
[33:36] yeah they don't really have much power
[33:38] now I want to read you a quote because I
[33:42] found it today I was listening while I
[33:43] was you know weeding in the garden I
[33:45] found a good quote brother Branham says
[33:48] now the Holy Ghost is the seal of God
[33:50] this is from mark of the beast and seal
[33:53] of God Park to February 61 now if you
[33:57] said you believin haven't received the
[33:58] Holy Ghost think God's never recognized
[34:00] your faith yet that's right because the
[34:02] seal is the recognition that God has
[34:04] completed and finished his work in you
[34:07] that he recognized sure someone said
[34:10] well he said he said that's the
[34:13] beginning of the Spirit he says I'm
[34:15] sorry he says salvation is the beginning
[34:17] of the Spirit that's right I believe
[34:19] that a man as soon as you believe on the
[34:21] Lord Jesus Christ
[34:22] it's a portion of the Holy Spirit now
[34:26] that's what I've been preaching church
[34:27] through the statue by man as soon as you
[34:30] repent and believe you have a small
[34:31] anointing a man of the Holy Ghost all
[34:35] right you have to because faith has to
[34:37] be something it's either a natural thing
[34:39] or spiritual thing well it's a spiritual
[34:41] thing there's only two spirits good
[34:42] spirit bad spirit holy spirit unholy
[34:45] it's got to be the Holy Spirit it's an
[34:47] anointing of the Holy Spirit on your
[34:49] mind you have a change mine but then you
[34:53] got to get virtue as a act on another
[34:56] where's very key there Keith now she's
[34:58] late this time
[34:58] Lord lest virtue that's where your name
[35:00] came from virtue a second anointing of
[35:02] the Holy Spirit that's right that's the
[35:06] second anointing you get another portion
[35:09] God adds another portion but program
[35:13] says see you just got a portion he said
[35:16] but when you're sanctified another part
[35:17] of the Holy Spirit cleanses you then
[35:19] you're later filled with the Holy Ghost
[35:22] yeah so it's it's clear brother Ram says
[35:24] each one is just more and more of an
[35:27] anointing right you get anointed here
[35:29] right and then all of a sudden
[35:31] what it's all what everything's already
[35:33] then he fills your soul with the Holy
[35:35] Ghost and that's your job and my job to
[35:39] make sure this is always we know this is
[35:42] always gonna be anointed we got to keep
[35:44] a renewed anointing every day in our
[35:46] mind right that's right that's what
[35:50] brother man clearly teaches and most
[35:52] most people the message recognize that
[35:54] now some don't we've had that remember a
[35:57] few years ago I told you we had I think
[35:58] six preachers know six preachers I knew
[36:01] leave the message and two of them
[36:03] preached right from our pulpit no they
[36:07] didn't preach it they preached at our
[36:09] pulpit but later I found out they
[36:10] believe you got the Holy Ghost when you
[36:12] got baptized if I'd have known that I
[36:14] never would have invited them to preach
[36:16] but the reason I have items' the
[36:17] preachers because I I like their spirit
[36:19] they had a good spirit and heard him
[36:22] preach in another church and they seemed
[36:23] to live a godly life and huh
[36:24] and at that time I was just young and I
[36:27] thought well they got the Holy Ghost
[36:28] they've been preaching longer than me I
[36:30] found out not everybody who preaches has
[36:32] the Holy Ghost because the one brother
[36:34] got divorced and married another woman
[36:36] and now he's divorced from that woman
[36:37] and oh just so awful that proves you're
[36:40] not born again but you know it's
[36:43] surprising but that's the great failure
[36:46] of the church today but but it's not a
[36:48] wonder that they found that because it's
[36:50] a mystery Paul said it was a mystery hid
[36:53] from ages and generations Christ in you
[36:56] the hope of glory
[36:57] it's a myth though or no wonder they
[36:59] can't get it because it's a mystery it's
[37:01] only revealed to those who will seek God
[37:04] for the revelation remember what is a
[37:08] revelation to unbaling so see they got
[37:10] to see God and they really got to want
[37:12] to know
[37:12] and then God who unveiled the revelation
[37:15] raised God that's what the revelation
[37:17] means it means apocalypse which means
[37:19] unveiling God unveils that's what
[37:23] revelation was he's unveiling what he's
[37:25] doing at the end time praise God
[37:26] hallelujah now let's go back to acts 2 I
[37:30] just want to devote some time there and
[37:34] I'm gonna restart my phone and see if
[37:36] this app will work so I can show us just
[37:38] a few quotes just a lot of them are just
[37:40] reminder quotes but I think it's
[37:43] necessary to go over that
[37:49] let's see Church any promise of God when
[37:55] God says whosoever will anybody can have
[37:58] it but they got to believe it
[37:59] remember salvation is the whosoever will
[38:02] Romans 10 says whoever calls upon the
[38:05] name of the Lord shall be saved
[38:08] so Judas must have not called on God
[38:12] long enough right
[38:14] or he must have called but then later
[38:17] regretted he called and then blackstein
[38:19] the Holy Ghost because the Bible
[38:21] promises whosoever will I want to be
[38:24] saved will be saved and the same thing
[38:28] for the Holy Ghost in John 7 in
[38:29] revelation 22 the spear and the bride
[38:31] say come
[38:31] whosoever's thirsty let him come and
[38:33] drink on the waters of life everybody's
[38:35] invited for the New Jerusalem they just
[38:37] gotta come and believe praise God I will
[38:40] not turn anybody away from the Holy
[38:42] Ghost that's right
[38:44] jesus said and just keep your spot there
[38:46] but and Jesus said in John 6:37 all that
[38:49] the father had given me shall come to me
[38:51] and him that cometh to me I will no wise
[38:54] cast out remember Jesus didn't cast out
[38:57] Judas Judas left Jesus Jesus said go do
[39:00] what you want to do so he did it wasn't
[39:03] Jesus saying yeah I don't like you but
[39:06] man said that's not how God doesn't
[39:07] God's not a respecter of persons God
[39:10] wants everybody to be saved amen
[39:12] but the fact that he knows what they're
[39:15] going to choose yes allow them to make
[39:17] the choice they want to make that's the
[39:18] only fair way to do it and so in
[39:22] Scripture and Acts 233 you're very
[39:25] familiar of course but this is a great
[39:28] principle and I wrote about it in the
[39:30] upcoming book I'm about 85% done with
[39:33] the book I almost done about my last two
[39:36] chapters I got a little bit left of
[39:37] another chapter to do I'm getting there
[39:39] by God's grace over 200,000 words so far
[39:41] I hope it's a gonna be a blessing than
[39:44] many people so in acts 233 Peters saying
[39:48] this is the Holy Ghost he shed it I
[39:50] looked shed what do you think of shed
[39:52] blood what do you think of running
[39:53] something running right so it's like God
[39:55] shed his heart right like
[39:59] his love from his heart and just poured
[40:01] out from heaven praise God that's that's
[40:04] the Peter gives the illustration of like
[40:06] shedding or running so that's why I was
[40:09] saying let it rain on Saturday night
[40:10] right let it rain open the floodgates
[40:12] let it shed fog praise God in other
[40:15] words let it fall let the rain fall upon
[40:17] the souls hallelujah and he says and
[40:21] then when it falls when it's shed for it
[40:23] when it when it comes down you see it
[40:26] and you hear it upon people's lives okay
[40:29] so let's go back and acts 2 a little bit
[40:31] earlier now you know though they all now
[40:36] look at verse 4 and they were all filled
[40:38] with the Holy Ghost and began to what
[40:39] speak did they get silent no they
[40:43] started speaking right speaking so when
[40:47] the Holy Ghost fell something caused
[40:49] them to say something now let's go back
[40:52] to our children in that brother Joe and
[40:54] I texted him today and I told him what a
[40:56] blessing it was everybody up here
[41:00] hopefully when they're praying for him
[41:02] we're speaking out loud something like I
[41:04] love you Jesus that's what I was telling
[41:05] him I don't know if they heard me about
[41:06] saying say I love you Jesus say fill me
[41:08] Jesus I'm just I believe your promise
[41:11] Jesus I was trying to tell them to just
[41:13] say that because pretty soon you then
[41:15] that was no Ethan you're gonna believe
[41:17] it and it's going to strike and you're
[41:18] gonna get born again now you may get
[41:21] happy you may get sad
[41:24] you may get joyful you might shout speak
[41:28] in tongues and dance or whatever you
[41:30] might do a lot of different things but
[41:32] one thing's for sure you're gonna speak
[41:33] praise God
[41:34] you're gonna praise God somehow well it
[41:39] can be it can be just like a trembling
[41:41] you know it used to be a trembling and
[41:43] thank you Jesus
[41:44] you don't have to be loud or quiet it
[41:46] just has to be some something you can
[41:48] hear praise God now let me prove it to
[41:51] church brother BAM be precise in the
[41:54] churches but everybody receives the Holy
[41:56] Ghost in some type of different way but
[41:58] it's all something you can see you're
[41:59] here like on the day of Pentecost they
[42:02] had fire over everybody's forehead I've
[42:04] never seen anybody with fire over their
[42:06] forehead yet I believe they're born
[42:08] again right I've never seen like
[42:12] he told the man with paralyzed man he
[42:14] said silver gold have I none rise and
[42:16] walk in the name of Jesus Christ he's a
[42:18] very gifted man I've never seen a man do
[42:20] that I've talked to people that him said
[42:22] they'd be done that but see God gives
[42:25] everybody else a kind of individual
[42:27] unique experience within the baptism
[42:30] with all the ghosts and but the only way
[42:32] to know is look at the fruit of your
[42:34] life if you say you've got the seed
[42:37] brother amen
[42:38] if you say that seed is alive in your
[42:41] soul then it has to produce some free
[42:45] because you say you've got a seed that's
[42:48] made alive amen you it has to produce
[42:52] some type of fruit and the only time I
[42:57] think that the only time I know that
[42:59] there won't be fruit brother amen and
[43:01] the saint is like at the end of a life
[43:04] and let's say I believe or gets dementia
[43:06] or something like that because that
[43:08] happened up in brother Randy sizes
[43:09] Church one of the believers got dementia
[43:11] and they started I mean they were a
[43:13] faithful godly safe for like 50 or 60
[43:16] years but they got a dementia and they
[43:18] started saying I don't believe in Jesus
[43:19] I don't and they started say evil things
[43:21] that's what the brothers told me up
[43:23] there that's the only time I think where
[43:26] you would lose you lose fruits of the
[43:29] Holy Spirit right when you lock but see
[43:32] that's just that's just losing here
[43:34] it ain't losing here Jesus said I come
[43:45] to give you rest for your soul praise
[43:46] God that's the reason he gave and that's
[43:49] why when brother Branham says and I know
[43:51] it's in 1953 demonology but he says you
[43:55] can be completely insane and still have
[43:57] the Holy Ghost that's why I believe that
[43:59] because even though dementia is not
[44:01] insanity you've lost your mind
[44:03] yeah okay now I don't know how far in
[44:10] sin you could go no let me go to a
[44:13] different topic now let me go to
[44:14] backsliding I don't know how far you can
[44:16] go backsliding with the baptism the Holy
[44:19] Ghost
[44:20] that's something I don't know I'm
[44:22] talking about somebody that just
[44:23] disobeys the word
[44:25] okay and then their mind will get so
[44:28] messed up from their sin I don't know
[44:30] how far they can go but I personally
[44:32] don't believe somebody can do all those
[44:34] things that that whole list that Paul
[44:36] gives us idolatry or negation
[44:39] homosexuality child abuse
[44:41] I don't believe a Holy Ghost filled
[44:43] Saint can do those things yeah I don't
[44:46] believe you can backside that far
[44:47] Oh Graham says me backside eighty but if
[44:50] you're a real saint of God if you've got
[44:51] that conviction if you've got that dumb
[44:53] nature in there like I hurt real bad say
[44:55] this week how can a dumb eat with the
[44:58] crows he can't but the crow can eat with
[45:01] the Dubs all right the crow can eat good
[45:04] things and then evil things right they
[45:06] can like the anointing one day but they
[45:08] love sin the next day but it dove it's
[45:10] only a dog I didn't start my timer so
[45:14] right now I just thought about that okay
[45:17] just put it on thirty minutes so yeah
[45:19] there I go again just forget about um
[45:23] having such a good time in the presence
[45:25] of the Lord so I know I don't but see if
[45:29] you're a dove and you got that nature
[45:31] and if you start eating and I grow bad
[45:32] lied to the IRA that's a good example he
[45:34] started eating uh you know that he
[45:36] realized oh I got to go confess it yeah
[45:39] it wasn't long until he confessed it see
[45:43] and so that's how I think a Holy Ghost
[45:44] filled Saint is they might start you
[45:46] know nibbling on that little bit you
[45:48] know but there is I can't I can't live
[45:50] like this I can't live with bitterness
[45:52] and I can't live with this complex I
[45:54] can't live with this lust I can't live
[45:57] with this greed I can't live with this
[45:59] idolatry I got to make it right that's
[46:02] what I believe about the Holy Ghost
[46:03] because I that's backed by Scripture now
[46:06] can somebody doubt you have the Holy
[46:08] Ghost
[46:09] yes remember we showed it from Galatians
[46:11] Paul said you you know he said you the
[46:14] very you left the law but now you're
[46:16] letting the law come back in and say now
[46:18] the men have to be circumcised to be
[46:20] saved
[46:20] he said I he's not needed travail it
[46:22] again with you to your birth in Christ
[46:25] he said because I doubt that you're born
[46:28] again so Paul see that's the thing I
[46:30] love it - there there is bruise right
[46:32] there
[46:32] a man can't always tell we can't know
[46:35] really who's born again all the time
[46:37] right
[46:38] he said I doubt you're born again
[46:40] alright unless God shows you by a vision
[46:43] someone saved or sealed or not how you
[46:45] gonna know you're not you can't prove it
[46:48] you can't show your soul to anybody I
[46:50] wish I could open up a door and say see
[46:52] I got that seat for those old yeah I
[46:55] wish I had that don't you I wish I could
[46:58] open up and you can see the light you
[47:00] know shine it out and there's the glory
[47:02] of God you can always tell what I'm
[47:05] thinking by my words right you can see
[47:08] it the light shining up here by my words
[47:10] if I'm walking in faith and walking in
[47:12] strength and victory oh you know you
[47:15] know my mind's renewed right and so I
[47:19] don't know how far you can go but but
[47:22] look as soon as the Holy Ghost Falls
[47:23] they speak and then look at the Bible
[47:27] says look at verse verse six now when
[47:32] this was noised abroad the multitude
[47:35] came together and they were confounded
[47:36] because that every man heard them speak
[47:39] in his own language this was noised
[47:41] abroad so they were speaking of tongues
[47:44] now this is their galley and thumbs
[47:46] right
[47:47] it wasn't unknown tongues it was
[47:48] Galilean tongue they were speaking in
[47:50] Galilean tongues and they were saying
[47:51] all the wonderful works of God and it
[47:54] got so loud program tells us they went
[47:56] out into the streets they just had to
[47:57] they just had to get he imagine 120
[47:59] people in a small room like this
[48:01] mercy how many seats do we have they
[48:03] just learned a small upper room they
[48:04] were rich you know they just had this
[48:06] small little casa uh-huh
[48:08] this is low and they just read they were
[48:11] so happy they just ran out the streets
[48:13] and we're saying the wonderful word God
[48:15] send the Holy Ghost aboard again thank
[48:18] you Jesus hallelujah I know I'm filled
[48:21] with the Spirit of God they were just
[48:23] worshiping and then you know the Walker
[48:25] bought the walkers and everybody walked
[48:27] in violence hey did you guys see what
[48:30] they're going on down there and
[48:32] everybody all these seventeen nations
[48:33] come around and look at them and it was
[48:35] perfect God was calling together for the
[48:37] first sermon the first Holy Ghost sermon
[48:40] and then 3,000 people believed and got
[48:43] the board us on the salvation experience
[48:45] praise God so you got noise dubrovsky
[48:49] any time someone is born again there's
[48:50] got to be noise
[48:52] see there's gotta be speaking some type
[48:54] of worship it doesn't have to be loud
[48:56] right it don't have to be it can be
[48:58] quiet but if there has to be something
[49:01] people see to know you're born again now
[49:05] let me read the next verse eleven
[49:07] Crete's and Arabians we do hear them
[49:10] speak in our tongues the wonderful works
[49:13] of God so they were Galilee in talking
[49:16] about how wonderful Jesus is Jesus
[49:18] you're wonderful
[49:19] oh you saved our souls you died for us
[49:22] on the cross you're so wonderful Jesus
[49:24] and now you're raised from the dead and
[49:26] you sent your Holy Spirit and they're
[49:28] hearing it in their own languages Oh
[49:31] hallelujah thank the Lord it's so simple
[49:34] but the schools just over two million
[49:37] miles most of them deny it
[49:38] some of them say it's in the past and
[49:40] some of them say huh you don't have to
[49:42] have that you don't need that it's
[49:43] nonsense right they got it all wrong but
[49:47] this is what we should have that's what
[49:49] we believe we should declare the
[49:51] wonderful works of God amen think about
[49:54] when you got born again you were
[49:55] surprised saying praise the Lord thank
[49:56] you Jesus hallelujah I love you lord
[49:58] thank you Lord and you're the best of
[50:01] the Lord I always serve your Lord and
[50:02] you're just saying how great wonderful
[50:04] God is amen
[50:06] glory amen so it has to be this way
[50:13] now if you would here let's go to acts
[50:16] for now you know you remember the story
[50:19] now they got you know Peter and James
[50:22] went down and they they spoke to this
[50:24] beautiful God healed miraculously now
[50:28] the one brother that's see done that
[50:30] brother Alexander Magilla said east and
[50:32] hid ministry over teens I think it
[50:35] happening if I'm not taken he said they
[50:37] pray for a parallels a paralyzed man
[50:38] that could walk and they phoned him up
[50:40] in the name of Jesus so I believe that
[50:43] praise God that's that's a blessing no
[50:47] and then they get questioned and then
[50:49] they get brought into the council and
[50:51] they said don't speak in the name of
[50:52] Jesus and Peter says those great words
[50:55] he said whether it's up to you he said
[50:56] whether obey God or man I'm gonna obey
[50:58] God it comes out of that I'm gonna obey
[51:01] God now it acts for they go have a
[51:03] prayer meeting you remember
[51:06] and the Bible said in verse 24 when they
[51:08] had heard that they lifted up their
[51:09] voice to God with one Accord so see
[51:13] there's times for quiet prayer right be
[51:15] still and know that I'm God right right
[51:18] there's time to be still well there's
[51:23] other times to lift up and cry loudly
[51:26] amen pray loudly there's times for that
[51:31] and they say and now Lord verse 29 and
[51:35] now Lord behold they're threatening and
[51:37] grant unto thy servants that with all
[51:38] boldness
[51:40] so see when you when someone gets the
[51:41] Holy Ghost they're usually bold that's
[51:44] why you hear something right there
[51:48] they're not ashamed of the Lord all
[51:51] boldness they may speak thy word by
[51:53] stretching forth thine hand to heal and
[51:55] that signs and wonders may be done by
[51:56] the name of thy Holy Child Jesus when
[51:58] they prayed the place was shaken where
[52:00] they were assembled together and they
[52:02] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[52:03] they spake the Word of God with baldness
[52:05] in other words whoever wasn't born again
[52:08] that was with them not born again at
[52:10] that time Jemez and I knew whatever was
[52:13] already born again they just got a fresh
[52:15] anointing in their minds praise God
[52:17] you're gonna get one steal the Holy
[52:19] Ghost as far as I can see in the soul I
[52:21] notice a bruising I don't ever see the
[52:23] scripture saying you get resealed in the
[52:25] soul but I see the scripture saying you
[52:26] renewed daily day by day in the spirit
[52:29] of your mind
[52:30] okay so again the house shakes they're
[52:35] praying loudly the Holy Ghost Falls make
[52:38] me bold the Holy Spirit falls and then
[52:41] they rejoice with all boldness praise
[52:43] God so see the Holy Ghost will always
[52:46] bring boldness right it'll bring you
[52:50] saying the wonderful works of God it'll
[52:52] bring boldness Acts chapter 8 this is
[52:56] after Philip had a great revival healing
[52:59] devil casting out ministry in Samaria
[53:02] and then he says well I need to call
[53:04] Peter and John down to pray for the Holy
[53:06] Ghost
[53:09] verse 15 who when they were come down
[53:12] prayed for them that they might receive
[53:13] the Holy Ghost for as yet he was fallen
[53:15] upon none of them only they were
[53:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:18] and
[53:19] then they laid their hands on them and
[53:21] they received the Holy Ghost and went
[53:24] Simon see saw saw
[53:27] so it wasn't partaking of a wafer right
[53:31] it wasn't just saying a sinner's prayer
[53:32] scripted reading off a card can I say
[53:35] this I'll say that I said that it wasn't
[53:37] that Simon saw something here's a man
[53:40] who saw he saw people demon-possessed
[53:42] he saw be in possession he saw curses
[53:46] because he was a sorcerer he saw people
[53:48] shrivel under curses he saw demons you
[53:51] know do all kinds of crazy but yet the
[53:53] Holy Ghost baptism was so special and
[53:55] his heart was still kind of wrong before
[53:58] God he said let me give you money so I
[54:00] can see people act like that amen
[54:03] so think about that a man who saw demon
[54:06] powers and devil worshipping and all
[54:08] these things the Holy Ghost baptism was
[54:10] so special he wanted to give Peter money
[54:12] so he could do something like that
[54:14] that's how special this was now remember
[54:17] the remember this was a real revival
[54:18] people were healed the imagine if you
[54:21] had a whole Church of people healed and
[54:22] demons cast out what kind of church
[54:24] service wouldn't you have I mean every
[54:26] service would be like the Sandman
[54:27] service don't you everybody when
[54:30] everybody's on fire
[54:31] praying and worshiping and crying and
[54:34] praising the Lord thanking God for their
[54:36] victories and their deliverances and the
[54:38] supernatural presence of Jesus Christ
[54:40] what a atmosphere that must have been
[54:44] within Simon the sorcerer who knew all
[54:47] about spells and demonology and demon
[54:51] worship he says this is something
[54:52] different see because when Satan comes
[54:55] on people they don't get happy and
[54:56] rejoicing and declaring the wonderful
[54:58] works of God they get mean and evil
[55:02] right and they get aggressive and they
[55:07] get angry so see the Holy Spirit was
[55:10] sweet and gentle and joyful and bold
[55:17] exactly the opposite day men you know
[55:21] say tanika's oppression they have
[55:23] oppression with the demon worship and
[55:25] they might have some emotion obviously
[55:27] and some boldness and things like that
[55:30] but it was all for the evil spirit it
[55:32] was all for
[55:33] sin but with God its joy and victory and
[55:36] peace and true happiness and true joy in
[55:40] the presence of God amen at this demon
[55:43] worship or a former demon worshiper what
[55:45] did defame on you to see it you know I I
[55:49] want to see it - and I don't offer money
[55:51] I offer prayers that's why I come up
[55:54] here to the altar and pray God give us
[55:56] more times like that amen
[55:58] only God can send it it's just like the
[56:00] wind you don't know what it's gonna be a
[56:01] windy day now you can look on your phone
[56:03] and get a pretty good idea but I was
[56:05] even in the weeding today listening with
[56:06] a brand it was so hot but even as like
[56:08] 89 degrees on them Oh Lord is so hot and
[56:10] pretty soon a wind move through my house
[56:12] and you know it's like the landscape but
[56:14] you know oh it was the most refreshing
[56:16] wind I just said thank you Jesus I just
[56:18] raised my hand to heaven because I
[56:21] didn't know it was coming I don't even
[56:22] know what it's gonna come I said Lord is
[56:24] so hot and also there's like the most
[56:26] refreshing oh can it last a little
[56:28] longer but it was a good three or four
[56:32] seconds of just a refreshing wind church
[56:35] we don't know when the services are
[56:36] going to come but I want to be here
[56:47] Wednesday night could be Sunday night
[56:50] usually it's a Sunday morning or I guess
[56:52] I should say usually it's a Saturday
[56:53] night now a lot you've seen a lot of
[56:56] good services where those Saturday
[56:58] services many times the best service I
[57:00] don't know why that is I think as God
[57:02] likes the fellowship in the evening it
[57:06] come down to Adam and Eve to talk with
[57:08] him in the evening time but then he rose
[57:10] on a Sunday morning so God could mean
[57:12] anytime right well there's something
[57:14] special about Sarah night services okay
[57:19] now it was so amazing that when they got
[57:22] the Holy Ghost Simon said I want to pay
[57:23] money to see more of that I love these I
[57:27] was amazed to see people act like that
[57:29] when they got the Holy Ghost
[57:31] acts 10 remember and in the book I list
[57:35] there's only five times where the Bible
[57:37] says people were filled with the Holy
[57:39] Ghost in the book of Acts and we're
[57:40] going through all five quickly tonight
[57:41] so you can see it acts 10 Peter follows
[57:46] the vision
[57:47] and then the angel to go with these
[57:50] Gentiles to Chris's house and this was
[57:53] strictly forbidden
[57:54] this was there was discrimination those
[57:56] that they were talk about racism they
[57:58] had it probably worse than we got today
[58:00] it was wrong for Peter he didn't his
[58:03] mind it was wrong for him to go with
[58:05] Gentiles they were dirty all kinds of
[58:08] unclean and I don't want to be defiled I
[58:10] can do the waters of separation but he
[58:14] went by the vision and the Lord showed
[58:16] him I don't call unclean when I've
[58:18] cleansed and here like we heard for the
[58:23] cam saved but also Branham this is the
[58:26] way the Gentiles normally receive the
[58:29] Holy Ghost is just by hearing the word
[58:31] we've also laid hands on people they got
[58:33] the Holy Ghost - I got the Holy Ghost
[58:35] just by hearing the preaching of the
[58:36] word amen got it and who had got it by
[58:39] laying on of hands there's nothing wrong
[58:41] or we were just holding hands I think
[58:42] right which sister who I think that
[58:44] we're on our knees up here all over the
[58:46] hand so that's right Lydia was up here -
[58:47] I was after that service so it don't
[58:52] really matter how it comes what matters
[58:55] is that something happened to you and
[58:57] you worship the Lord Amen that's right
[59:01] it has to you has to produce something
[59:04] you have to know something is happening
[59:06] yeah right acts 10 now in acts 10 37
[59:13] Peter starts this short short servant
[59:16] and look these people knew about Jesus
[59:19] they just not bet they have just not
[59:21] been born again now look at this that
[59:23] word I say you know he's talking about
[59:25] Jesus Cornelius knew about Jesus but he
[59:27] wasn't born again yet which was
[59:29] published throughout all Judaea and
[59:31] began from Galilee after the baptism
[59:33] which John preached okay so he knew
[59:35] about Jesus he knew only knew about
[59:37] John's baptism okay so Peter comes and
[59:41] he preaches now verse 44 is where the
[59:43] Holy Ghost falls while Peter yet spake
[59:44] these words the Holy Ghost fell on all
[59:47] them which heard the word and my
[59:50] testimony was when brother Brooks was
[59:52] preaching the day after my wedding we
[59:53] got there late to church and I'm just I
[59:57] was in the back I think on the right
[1:00:00] side yeah I was in
[1:00:01] on the right side and Mother Russia was
[1:00:03] just preaching about the blood and
[1:00:04] people are standing up clapping I just
[1:00:06] stood up clapping he's he just
[1:00:07] remembered him in just going on and on
[1:00:09] about the blood and was the address I
[1:00:11] just closed my eyes I started crying and
[1:00:14] in my mind it's like I did a sideways I
[1:00:16] saw Jesus on the cross sideways like
[1:00:18] this but then I saw the nailing nails in
[1:00:22] his wrist and I started shaking like
[1:00:25] that my my body because I was feeling
[1:00:28] it's like I could feel the vibrations of
[1:00:31] that and I just started crying I just
[1:00:34] started I don't know how lot of ways I
[1:00:36] was just like thank you Jesus hallelujah
[1:00:38] praise be to God I love your Lord Jesus
[1:00:41] it was just right dirt and all they did
[1:00:43] was cry and I was looking around I was
[1:00:45] brainless but after I left the service I
[1:00:47] just I never shake in the Deacons hand
[1:00:49] be like god bless you I was so happy and
[1:00:52] I told my wife I said I said after that
[1:00:54] I was filled with love and I just wanted
[1:00:57] to love everybody after that and it was
[1:01:01] a week later when I was that brother
[1:01:02] sandals Church he was preaching on the
[1:01:03] Holy Ghost and it helped me know I was
[1:01:05] like yeah that's what happened to me
[1:01:07] thank God I can look back and say yeah
[1:01:09] okay that's how the Holy Ghost makes you
[1:01:11] act that's what I acted like I didn't
[1:01:13] run around the church I didn't
[1:01:14] prophesied and speak in tongues but I
[1:01:17] was speaking I was speaking my love for
[1:01:19] Jesus amen poorly hey brother brother
[1:01:23] Jose I never done that to service before
[1:01:25] I never stood up shouted and raised my
[1:01:28] hands and cried and praise the Lord
[1:01:29] hallelujah probably just like this thank
[1:01:31] you lord thank you Jesus my wife might
[1:01:33] remember about though she remembers are
[1:01:35] not so many years ago so that what all's
[1:01:42] I know is that I did saw I acted in a
[1:01:44] way I never acted before and I looked in
[1:01:47] my life afterwards and I could tell I
[1:01:49] was a different person
[1:01:52] and if I didn't live a different life
[1:01:54] than I know I didn't get it in the so I
[1:01:56] just got it in the mind but I've seen
[1:01:59] temptation after temptation and God's
[1:02:01] been giving me victory after victory
[1:02:02] after vain and I've tried sister
[1:02:05] Beatrice to keep this with the word I've
[1:02:07] tried to be true to God's Word with
[1:02:09] everything I preached by God's grace so
[1:02:15] that's what happened and now look they
[1:02:17] weren't even baptized because Peter says
[1:02:19] in verse 47 could any man forbid water
[1:02:21] that these should not be baptized which
[1:02:24] is receive the Holy Ghost see but
[1:02:26] members they were already fasting
[1:02:28] praying and giving alms if people with
[1:02:31] the Holy Ghost you got to do that too
[1:02:32] that's part of sanctification you've got
[1:02:35] a fast you got to pray you got to give
[1:02:37] all shut it you got to start living for
[1:02:39] the people praise God Amy they were
[1:02:42] already living a sanctified life they
[1:02:44] just didn't know about the new baptism
[1:02:46] or the Holy Ghost baptism so when Peter
[1:02:48] preaches it they're all sanctified and
[1:02:50] they believe it and they get failed and
[1:02:52] then Peter said now you go back and get
[1:02:54] baptized in water just to let everybody
[1:02:56] know in your town that you're a real
[1:02:58] Christian God what's that he wants you
[1:03:02] to make that public testimony he want
[1:03:04] you to meet other change I didn't really
[1:03:06] go for the months of believers and say
[1:03:09] I've died to myself the old Jesse Smith
[1:03:12] is crucified and a new one has risen up
[1:03:14] up by the pile on top hey he wants you
[1:03:18] to be so bold form that you're willing
[1:03:21] to do that and be baptized in water
[1:03:25] whether you got the Holy Ghost or not he
[1:03:27] said I want you to be baptized he that
[1:03:29] believeth is baptized shall be saved
[1:03:31] st. it's part of the process now people
[1:03:34] don't have a chance of course they'll be
[1:03:35] saved even if they're not baptized they
[1:03:37] will be saved people ask me all the time
[1:03:40] with a man I get questions all the time
[1:03:42] on this can you get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:44] without knowing brother Branham of
[1:03:45] course because brother Branham ain't the
[1:03:47] one that gives the Holy Ghost but if you
[1:03:51] hang around the message preaching long
[1:03:54] enough with the Holy Ghost you'll start
[1:03:56] saying whoa where did they get this from
[1:03:58] this thing come out of seminary you tell
[1:04:00] me where you got that preacher and then
[1:04:03] the thing I got from the prophet of God
[1:04:04] right people ask me all the time and of
[1:04:08] course you can get the only ghost
[1:04:09] without knowin brother Branham you have
[1:04:11] to know Jesus because John the Baptist
[1:04:13] says there's one coming after me that's
[1:04:15] mightier than me and he all just baptize
[1:04:17] you in water
[1:04:18] baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen oh
[1:04:21] yeah Jesus Christ is the one the only
[1:04:25] one who baptizes with all
[1:04:26] ghost so true now let's just read pull
[1:04:31] up a few Lydia John 14 18 just pull that
[1:04:35] up real quick you oh no something's
[1:04:38] happening like I said I didn't know was
[1:04:40] the baptism holy ghost but I knew
[1:04:42] something was happening to me I was
[1:04:44] loving Jesus I was I was declaring the
[1:04:47] wonderful works of God amen
[1:04:49] I was seeing that's the only time I've
[1:04:51] ever had like a vision like that my mind
[1:04:52] the only time never had that ever happen
[1:04:55] since now look I will not leave you
[1:04:58] comfortless I will come to you you'll
[1:05:00] know when Jesus is coming to you yeah
[1:05:03] you'll cry you'll shout you'll leave
[1:05:05] something that something's got happen if
[1:05:08] Jesus has never been with you and then
[1:05:10] he comes to know something's happened to
[1:05:44] me I walked out is there different or so
[1:05:48] I feel different I know there's
[1:05:50] something different about me and then
[1:05:52] watch your attitude towards sin that's
[1:05:55] how you'll know yeah you know you'll go
[1:05:57] to more godliness all the time there's
[1:06:00] no he said I will guide you into all
[1:06:02] truth
[1:06:03] yeah oh guy sees guy you to be guided
[1:06:06] the truth or guided into iniquity right
[1:06:08] that's one of the chapter I'm right
[1:06:10] right now a Nick would God hates Nick we
[1:06:12] I remember the seal the Holy Ghost
[1:06:13] Timothy Center Paul told Timothy he said
[1:06:16] to seal the Holy Ghost is that anyone
[1:06:18] that names the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:20] depart from iniquity amen
[1:06:23] Nathan that's how you know see he's
[1:06:25] dying you on a path away from iniquity
[1:06:28] which is purposeful sinning even though
[1:06:30] you know you're wrong that's iniquity
[1:06:33] remaining in addictions but when you got
[1:06:35] the Holy Ghost he's guiding you away
[1:06:36] from addictions away from purposeful
[1:06:39] sinning
[1:06:40] into righteousness and holiness that's
[1:06:44] the seal hot on it the seal of the Holy
[1:06:47] Ghost is that if you name the name of
[1:06:50] Christ depart from iniquity let's let's
[1:06:53] let's pull it up here I think I think I
[1:06:55] pulled it I don't know where it is about
[1:06:57] and I know the words in it depart Nick
[1:07:02] witty it's second Timothy 2:19 thank you
[1:07:05] I appreciate technology and I would a
[1:07:07] blessing it's just a little bit faster
[1:07:10] than brother and brother Graham had it
[1:07:12] we had that big concordance you November
[1:07:13] that thick book brother Jose I can't
[1:07:16] believe what yet oh hey that's the best
[1:07:18] we had can you guys be turning all the
[1:07:20] pages and you gotta find it just the one
[1:07:22] word seal you know you gotta go down ah
[1:07:25] there's what I'm looking nevertheless
[1:07:27] the foundation of God standeth sure
[1:07:29] having this seal that the Lord knoweth
[1:07:32] them that are his and let everyone that
[1:07:35] nameth the name of Christ depart from
[1:07:37] iniquity that's why you should enjoy
[1:07:40] coming to every service because I'm
[1:07:42] trying the Holy Spirit in me is trying
[1:07:44] to point you to a more holy light and if
[1:07:47] you don't like that it's your because
[1:07:48] you're not born again because iniquity
[1:07:51] is sin loving a saint loving religious
[1:07:57] masks or just come to church act like
[1:07:59] everything's okay but behind the scenes
[1:08:01] you love the world and and evil and
[1:08:03] wickedness and just act like you're holy
[1:08:05] do your hair everything looks nice
[1:08:07] that's iniquity but Christ if you really
[1:08:11] love Christ you want to get closer to
[1:08:13] him and you want to get victories over
[1:08:15] the struggles that you have hey you want
[1:08:19] to really show Christ loves everybody
[1:08:23] amen go to verse okay John 14 20 million
[1:08:28] you're getting a good workout tonight 14
[1:08:32] 20 you will know he said I'll come to
[1:08:35] you okay if he comes to you you're gonna
[1:08:37] know something happened whether cuz you
[1:08:39] know something emotional happened that
[1:08:42] never happened to you before
[1:08:44] right it has it has to be different than
[1:08:47] just you know something in the spirit or
[1:08:49] mine it has to be something deep inside
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:53] John 14:23 I you will know you'll know
[1:08:59] something happened you might not have
[1:09:01] known it was the Holy Ghost when it
[1:09:02] happened but but afterwards you look at
[1:09:04] it while something happened something
[1:09:05] did happen to me that's what happened to
[1:09:08] me I didn't know cuz I got it I wasn't
[1:09:09] studying up it was strange I was reading
[1:09:11] the church age book at that time I
[1:09:12] wasn't studying really the Holy Ghost
[1:09:14] baptism until we heard brother Samuel
[1:09:16] preach on it that's a great series he
[1:09:18] did at that that you should know that I
[1:09:21] am in my father and your and me and I'm
[1:09:25] in you you won't wonder if he's in you
[1:09:28] you'll know he's in you say your guests
[1:09:34] and your hope that I'm in you he said
[1:09:37] you'll know it why cuz it's Christ
[1:09:40] living his life you know your life what
[1:09:44] you know no sometimes I look back and
[1:09:52] God will use me in a way I'm like how
[1:09:54] did I even say that how did I know to do
[1:09:56] that and I'll say let's see that was
[1:09:57] Christ it wasn't me it was Christ like
[1:10:01] how could I've done that how could I
[1:10:03] have said that oh god help that person
[1:10:05] it wasn't my thought it was Christ in me
[1:10:07] praise God remember anything good you do
[1:10:10] it wasn't you it was Christ because
[1:10:12] apart from Christ you can do nothing see
[1:10:15] go to 21 he said that day but family

[1:10:22] he that he that hath my Commandments and

[1:10:43] way he'll appear to you like he comes at
[1:10:45] you and dreams which is awesome both of
[1:10:46] you that's wonderful

[1:10:55] the mountain or something like that the
[1:10:56] Lord will do it through me somehow he'll
[1:10:59] appear to you he has to does he promise
[1:11:02] they met he said I've got to give them a
[1:11:05] better comfort
[1:11:06] than just a physical body I've got to
[1:11:09] give them an inward permanent constant
[1:11:12] source of my presence amen that's right

[1:11:28] and not the whole world how you gonna do
[1:11:30] this just to us and out the whole world
[1:11:31] that description Jesus answers at him if
[1:11:34] a man love me go keep my words you know
[1:11:37] the reason people don't get a born-again
[1:11:38] cuz they don't love holiness and they
[1:11:41] don't keep the commands of God Yeah
[1:11:43] right and my father will love him and we
[1:11:46] will come into him and make our abode
[1:11:48] with him see a boat that means he's
[1:11:53] gonna dwell with you he's gonna camp out
[1:11:56] in your soul praise God Hey
[1:11:58] not just for a night for all your nights
[1:12:00] amen right he's gonna be a permanent
[1:12:03] resident but see that's the reason how
[1:12:05] come you're not gonna show yourself to
[1:12:06] sinners because they don't love the
[1:12:08] command they don't even take the first
[1:12:10] anointing of faith I believe in Jesus
[1:12:12] Christ I need Jesus Christ died for my
[1:12:14] sin I believe all the history bruises
[1:12:16] thank God I got faith in him he died for
[1:12:19] my sins he arose so much I got faith in
[1:12:21] they won't even take that first
[1:12:22] anointing so how they gonna get the rest
[1:12:24] of it
[1:12:24] they're not cuz it's a slow steady
[1:12:27] process of filling the vessel praise God
[1:12:31] amen as far as I'm sorry filling the
[1:12:33] mind right doing the mind alright acts
[1:12:38] 19 beautiful scripture here now you acts
[1:12:42] 19 this is when Paul says have you
[1:12:46] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:12:47] believed since and Lord willing it looks
[1:12:54] like you know times sake I may have - oh
[1:12:56] here we go yeah don't switch over yet
[1:13:02] but in a minute thank the Lord so I just
[1:13:04] had to reset my phone that's good
[1:13:06] sometimes when things don't work in our
[1:13:07] lives we just gotta hit the reset button
[1:13:09] praise God just start all over say Oh
[1:13:12] forgive me like I made that mistake on
[1:13:14] Sunday I thought everybody that the
[1:13:16] bland family was coming here I just it
[1:13:17] was my mistake so if they're a stream
[1:13:19] and forgive me
[1:13:20] he's in the process of praying about a
[1:13:22] home church so I felt so awful Church I
[1:13:25] woke up on Monday morning and it was
[1:13:28] like this Billy man I saw it's like I
[1:13:29] saw these words in my mind you've sinned
[1:13:31] against the Lord so I right away I
[1:13:34] called brother would I call first I call
[1:13:38] brother Jim first yup or the gym because
[1:13:40] that's that was their home church and I
[1:13:42] said brother now I'll tell you the
[1:13:44] testimony later not tonight
[1:13:45] I'm out of time but it's a good it's a
[1:13:48] good experience I said brother Jim I
[1:13:50] send here and here I think that's what
[1:13:52] caused me to say it wrong I was
[1:13:54] presuming and then I called brother
[1:13:56] Johnny explain the same thing to him but
[1:13:58] it's like I woke up and that's how the
[1:13:59] Lord will speak to me it's like I saw
[1:14:01] that I saw like a black screen I saw
[1:14:03] these words in my mind honest that's why
[1:14:05] I felt my mind you have sinned against
[1:14:07] the Lord that's why I called him up to
[1:14:10] forgive ask the Lord to forgive me I'm
[1:14:13] thankful the Holy Spirit can correct me
[1:14:14] praise God and like I said we I think we
[1:14:17] prayed for the Bland's that God would
[1:14:18] just guide them wherever they don't have
[1:14:19] to come here if they're interested I
[1:14:21] mean they're more than welcome I told
[1:14:23] mother Johnny on the phone some things I
[1:14:24] believe and this is how I've run it at
[1:14:25] the church and you know just probably
[1:14:27] about it take your time no no no
[1:14:29] pressure but I misunderstood because I'd
[1:14:31] sinned against the Lord but I confessed
[1:14:34] it to Jim and brother Johnny so I thank
[1:14:36] the Lord it's something personal I'll
[1:14:38] tell you about later by God's grace I'd
[1:14:40] say about there okay so acts 19 yeah
[1:14:44] have you received Holy Ghost since you
[1:14:46] believe now they believe Apollo's had
[1:14:48] taught them the word about bat John's
[1:14:51] bat they only knew John's baptism but
[1:14:54] Peter I'm sorry but Paul says you got to
[1:14:57] believe in Christ now verse 5 when they
[1:15:00] heard this they were baptized in the
[1:15:01] name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul
[1:15:03] laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost
[1:15:05] came on them and they spake with tongues
[1:15:07] and prophesied and all the men were
[1:15:12] about 12 praise God so they spake in
[1:15:16] tongues and prophesied now I don't know
[1:15:18] okay there's my timer I got 10 more
[1:15:20] minutes okay that was my 30-minute timer
[1:15:21] I'll do one more 10 minute time is that
[1:15:24] good that is that right okay is it yeah
[1:15:29] okay all right so let me do five here
[1:15:33] thank you appreciate that I do need help
[1:15:36] i need help hey I made a reminder on my
[1:15:38] phone just breeze 35 or 45 minutes with
[1:15:41] three exclamation marks fine just try to
[1:15:43] control yourself if you can so uh here
[1:15:49] they magnified God they spake in tongues
[1:15:52] erm and they prophesied and everybody
[1:15:55] could tell right that something happened
[1:15:58] these people and there was only 12
[1:16:00] there's small Holy Ghost group now I
[1:16:03] forgot one verse Lydia acts 1046 for
[1:16:06] when they heard them speak with tongues
[1:16:08] and magnify God yeah so that's the part
[1:16:10] left out yeah can you yeah there you go
[1:16:12] now look magnify so you'll be you might
[1:16:15] be bold you might be weeping you might
[1:16:18] declare the wonderful works of God but
[1:16:20] you will mag that's not like before they
[1:16:22] even sing that song magnify the Lord
[1:16:24] with me I like that like yeah I said
[1:16:25] that's nice what's on my mind right now
[1:16:27] you know you got the Holy Ghost but you
[1:16:29] want to magnify Jesus amen you want to
[1:16:32] lift him up you want to be bold you want
[1:16:34] to praise the name of the Lord
[1:16:35] that's what happened when they got the
[1:16:37] Holy Ghost they just heard the preaching
[1:16:39] they stopped cussing oh thank you Jesus
[1:16:42] and the Holy Ghost fell from happening
[1:16:47] so we have to we have to just take the
[1:16:51] scripture now my children can my
[1:16:53] children look up here so can everybody
[1:16:54] see how when something when the Holy
[1:16:57] Ghost Falls usually you see in here
[1:17:00] something I'm not sure to understand
[1:17:01] that okay because we didn't we didn't
[1:17:03] really get a chance to talk about this
[1:17:04] hell
[1:17:04] I said I'll save it for Wednesday night
[1:17:06] because then I got their full attention
[1:17:07] praise God
[1:17:08] now go to acts 11:15 so Peter after her
[1:17:13] scene coordinators get the Holy Ghost he
[1:17:15] goes back to Jerusalem he's all happy
[1:17:17] and the Saints are like hey how was your
[1:17:18] meeting
[1:17:19] oh good I went into a Gentile house was
[1:17:20] like what you can't go to James outhouse
[1:17:22] and he's opposed just listen let me tell
[1:17:24] you and he told them what happened and
[1:17:28] the way he described it he said he said
[1:17:32] the same way we acted when we got it on
[1:17:35] the day of Pentecost that's the same way
[1:17:38] they acted
[1:17:40] there wasn't anything different the way
[1:17:43] they knew and the people and the
[1:17:45] brothers didn't argue like they're like
[1:17:48] praise God Amen they were just happy
[1:17:52] yeah
[1:17:53] Ernest and as I began to speak the Holy
[1:17:56] Ghost fell on them as on us at the
[1:17:59] beginning we just read it all they did
[1:18:01] was magnify God oh I don't know but they
[1:18:14] saw something and they heard something
[1:18:22] see something has to happen so the proof
[1:18:25] of the Holy Ghost baptism and seeing and
[1:18:29] hearing something is Peter saying it
[1:18:32] fell the same way now let me tell you
[1:18:36] about testimony from brother Brooks's
[1:18:37] Church in 2017 I went out there I cuz I
[1:18:40] wrote it on my notes our December I
[1:18:42] remember December 2017 the young man he
[1:18:46] was 18 I think her yeah he was on the
[1:18:50] piano
[1:18:50] I said not who wants I'm sorry said come
[1:18:53] on up for prayer everyone's prayer I
[1:18:54] didn't know what he's gonna but he come
[1:18:55] up for the batches and well he goes
[1:18:56] Church I just prayed for him and he was
[1:18:59] just Bravo's and just cry like this
[1:19:00] that's always described say thank you
[1:19:02] Jesus
[1:19:02] brother Brooks said I left the next day
[1:19:05] after preaching he said that guy came
[1:19:08] and told me I got the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:09] brother Brooks said II spent the last
[1:19:11] three years leading youth meetings
[1:19:14] trying to get the youth to be born again
[1:19:16] he gets better his music all the time
[1:19:18] and he's telling people he got born
[1:19:20] again but I prayed for him
[1:19:22] he's got the fruits up he didn't dance
[1:19:25] around he didn't prophesy
[1:19:26] but what he was making noise right I saw
[1:19:30] him he was making noise he was visibly
[1:19:32] something's happening to him crazy large
[1:19:34] and his life has lined up with his
[1:19:37] testimony praise God I didn't see fire
[1:19:41] overs for it I didn't see him speak in a
[1:19:43] galilean tongue or a Russian town or an
[1:19:47] Italian tongue but something happened to
[1:19:51] him he knew something would happen
[1:19:53] I praise God and now his life lines up
[1:19:57] with this confession so I want to make
[1:20:04] sure I say that yeah December 2017
[1:20:09] brother amen and his wife who or tell me
[1:20:12] when they got the Holy Ghost they got on
[1:20:13] different weeks you know now he was
[1:20:16] telling me they spent that whole week
[1:20:18] cleaning out their houses cleaning out
[1:20:21] anything that would displease God are
[1:20:23] their houses and brother hey man told me
[1:20:25] specifically I remember I talked to him
[1:20:27] more than talk to sister who of course
[1:20:28] yeah uh but he was saying he was
[1:20:31] listening to sermons about the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost that we remember that and then
[1:20:34] Simon preached some of the similar
[1:20:35] things that you were listening to from
[1:20:37] brother Branham like and you knew you
[1:20:39] weren't gonna leave that service he got
[1:20:40] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:41] so after everybody left he went knocked
[1:20:43] on the door got Simon came out and
[1:20:45] Simon's hand felt huge right like a
[1:20:48] angel was touching it and everybody
[1:20:50] knows but Amen this is a room and
[1:20:52] different people since those times
[1:20:53] everybody can tell I can tell I know I
[1:20:56] can tell for sure and and so it can
[1:21:01] happen anyway like it can be a variety
[1:21:04] of manifestations but something has to
[1:21:06] happen to you that you that everybody
[1:21:09] can see something's happening and here's
[1:21:11] something happening yeah cuz Peter said
[1:21:14] the way it fell remember he said a shed
[1:21:16] forth something you see in here what it
[1:21:19] shed for there it has to shed forth
[1:21:21] there and every time afterwards okay now
[1:21:24] switch over I got a couple minutes here
[1:21:27] of course I didn't get to everything but
[1:21:30] you understand now preach this a long
[1:21:32] time ago I want to go over this here
[1:21:40] that's not it
[1:21:43] okay yeah here's just a few quotes as we
[1:21:47] close here sure change buh buh gram he
[1:21:52] teaches how the batches of the Holy
[1:21:54] Ghost comes after you believe you get
[1:21:56] justified sanctified then the Baptist
[1:21:58] oligos he says he's teaching this with
[1:22:00] thus saith the Lord so see Church we
[1:22:04] have the revelation of the batson Holy
[1:22:05] Ghost
[1:22:06] it's thus sayeth the Lord it's not the
[1:22:09] it's not it's not the way my wife and I
[1:22:11] were taught in college just say a
[1:22:12] sinner's prayer now you're filled with
[1:22:13] the Holy Ghost and now you can do
[1:22:15] greater works than Jesus come on that's
[1:22:16] nonsense
[1:22:17] no one is apt let me tell you no one's
[1:22:19] ever do any works greater than Jesus the
[1:22:21] RAM said so
[1:22:22] that greater means more it doesn't mean
[1:22:26] you can do something greater than the
[1:22:28] Son of God the Virgin born son of God
[1:22:30] you think you can do something greater
[1:22:31] than the Virgin born of God who is God
[1:22:34] in the flesh no you can't don't deceive
[1:22:37] yourself I don't think anybody believes
[1:22:39] that here but I've heard preachers say
[1:22:40] that in the message and brother I'm
[1:22:43] plainly says that he said you can't do
[1:22:45] anything greater than Jesus I don't know
[1:22:47] what their I don't know what they're
[1:22:48] listening to I don't know I want to make
[1:22:52] myself very clear on the Baptist Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost is according to the word now look
[1:22:55] children we just did the word tonight
[1:22:57] right I took you through all the five
[1:22:58] times where the Holy Ghost fell Peter
[1:23:01] said that fell on us the same way as it
[1:23:04] did on cornices house it was through a
[1:23:07] freedom worship it was through a
[1:23:09] liberating emotional experience they
[1:23:12] magnified God they declared his
[1:23:14] wonderful works sometimes they spoke in
[1:23:16] tongues sometimes they prophesied
[1:23:17] sometimes they didn't but they acted the
[1:23:21] same way they were birthed they were
[1:23:24] born see it's not a coordinate but I
[1:23:28] said the Holy Ghost and according to me
[1:23:29] it's according to you he said it's not
[1:23:31] according to you it's according to the
[1:23:32] stay at the lower the Word of God the
[1:23:35] word the word where does that say
[1:23:36] baloney okay
[1:23:41] not 1953 and listen here woman you got
[1:23:43] to be salting listen this you realize up
[1:23:45] there when they all went to the 120 went
[1:23:47] up to pray they never done like Baptists
[1:23:49] do they shake hands and put their name
[1:23:50] on a book say yes I'm born again is
[1:23:53] there's no scripture for that now then
[1:23:56] he says
[1:23:57] we methods go on prohibition for six
[1:23:59] months and there's no such Scripture in
[1:24:00] the Bible but the Bible said when the
[1:24:03] day of Pentecost was fully come there
[1:24:05] came a sound from heaven like a rushing
[1:24:06] mighty wind Haven do you still have that
[1:24:08] testimony you felt a win hey he's got
[1:24:11] sister who I did too right weekend was
[1:24:14] here preaching though about a year and
[1:24:15] half ago that's part of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:17] I feel some wind glory and it filled all
[1:24:23] the house where they were setting and
[1:24:24] the power of God so enclosed those
[1:24:27] people anointed them so they run on the
[1:24:29] street screaming and dancing and
[1:24:30] hollered and that's like a bunch of
[1:24:32] drunk people that's the scripture thus
[1:24:34] saith the Lord
[1:24:37] so see however they acted in acts we
[1:24:40] have to have something similar to that
[1:24:42] right it won't be the same like I said
[1:24:44] like I guess I'm one of pillars of fire
[1:24:46] look like God just did that one time
[1:24:49] but we have to have some type of freedom
[1:24:51] some emotion on out here yeah let me
[1:24:56] speak this a minute did you know where
[1:24:57] that class I thought about spiritual
[1:25:00] dignity like being quiet in church
[1:25:01] dignity stop being a fanatic he said
[1:25:08] class is of the devil now that's thus
[1:25:10] saith the Lord of the Bible class and
[1:25:12] pomp came from the devil in the very
[1:25:15] beginning when Cain and Abel came up to
[1:25:16] worship can come by the before the Lord
[1:25:19] in class Abel came in righteousness by
[1:25:21] revelation see class and dignified
[1:25:28] worship and everybody sitting still my
[1:25:33] wife was there Lutheran Church and boy
[1:25:34] they got a lot of class right I'm sure
[1:25:38] that we went to a Catholic a funeral
[1:25:40] couple years ago they got a lot of class
[1:25:42] but the Holy Spirit is freedom its joy
[1:25:46] its bonus it's a gratefulness it's
[1:25:50] Liberty its magnifying guys it's
[1:25:52] praising God amen it's not a bunch of
[1:25:55] class and structure and routine all the
[1:25:57] time but man says you got to get out of
[1:26:00] routine to get the Holy Ghost right
[1:26:03] true it's true okay I think that's it
[1:26:09] yeah that's it because that was
[1:26:11] old sermon preacher all right let's send
[1:26:12] our feet praise God I just want to go
[1:26:15] over that for our children's sake and I
[1:26:18] liked one thing brother Brook said I
[1:26:20] like my brother Brook said he said he
[1:26:22] said even if you don't get it he said
[1:26:23] just confess that you got it and don't
[1:26:25] tell anybody there don't take anybody's
[1:26:29] word that you don't got it now why is
[1:26:31] that important it's the same thing it's
[1:26:34] the same attitude you should have - any
[1:26:35] promise of God if God reveals you let's
[1:26:39] say you're sick and God reveals you're
[1:26:40] going to be healed take that same
[1:26:41] attitude I'm healed even though I don't
[1:26:44] feel it Aiko's any right you could say
[1:26:45] that's not if God has revealed to you
[1:26:49] that you're gonna be here then you tell
[1:26:51] everybody I'm gonna be made well I know
[1:26:54] God's gonna hear me
[1:26:55] and that's the that's all brother Brooks
[1:26:57] is saying take the same attitude I've
[1:26:59] repented I've been baptized I'm gonna
[1:27:01] get the Holy Ghost some time another
[1:27:04] that's what he was saying here he wasn't
[1:27:07] saying pretend just pretend you got
[1:27:09] nobody ghost he's saying just trust in
[1:27:12] the promise of God don't let anybody
[1:27:14] tell you talk to you Jesus said
[1:27:17] whosoever will then come entry of the
[1:27:20] living sea living waters it's like it's
[1:27:22] gonna flow on me right so you gotta
[1:27:25] praise God oh I magnify it might be a
[1:27:28] whisper it might be a screen it might be
[1:27:31] a shout it might be a speaking in
[1:27:33] tongues it might be a prophesied but
[1:27:35] something is gonna happen when you get
[1:27:37] the whole they gonna say something oh
[1:27:40] there's thunder the voice of God it's
[1:27:55] like Amen - were preaching closer I was
[1:28:04] gonna close that the greatest services
[1:28:07] I've ever had is when I preached those
[1:28:09] sermons about the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:28:11] we had a 5 hour service of for our
[1:28:14] service and
[1:28:16] Pennsylvania Guayana Trinidad the
[1:28:19] longest services I've ever preached or
[1:28:21] when I preached that sermon about you
[1:28:24] must see in here the real values
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:37] to me it was I really hope that helps my
[1:29:08] children

[1:31:01] we know we know the maker of the random
[1:31:07] Lord you're the one who proved to me
[1:31:10] that this is right sometimes it's way
[1:31:19] more supernatural like lying and
