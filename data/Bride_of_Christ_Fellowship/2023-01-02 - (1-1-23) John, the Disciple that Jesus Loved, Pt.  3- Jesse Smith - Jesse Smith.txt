your love and compassion the enemy tries to constantly say you don't but Lord we know your word is true dear God we thank you that you are faithful Lord to prove it to us over and over again Lord you keep proving your love and we thank you Lord for that for Lord without that Lord we we might to question it Lord we might have have struggles but Lord you help us overcome Lord God you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us and we thank you God for these constant reminders Lord as we've seen that song remind me Who I Am Lord we're thankful that the word of God reminds us who we are today we're your beloved so father take this word now bless it to your people in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I'd like to got some scriptures to show here by God's grace I'd like to just continue this thought here just want to review Parts uh one and two very very quickly I want to be mindful of the time too I know everybody's tired you know from uh the weekend here so um just want to be mindful of the time by God's grace here so I thought I'd rather preach this rather than do a Bible study just kind of like a little bit more free when I preach you know I feel a little bit more freedom so you know we would like we looked at this here uh earlier this year you know and these are basically some of the reviews from uh the first few parts you know there's five scriptures that say the disciple whom Jesus loved and of course is speaking of John uh that's there's John again um but remember the scripture said Jesus loves all his disciples and his sisters and all the brothers all the sisters and and God's love cannot be questioned right it's it's not God's love really that's in question it's our love for God that's in question right because our love wavers God's love never wavers and you know we saw the gifts of Peter James and John you know uh there were three gifts that God could use Jesus used them on numerous occasions to minister to needs it's not that Jesus loved them more but they were gifted in certain ways where only God God can only do things through their gifts it's just like brother Branham you know God can only do certain things through brother Brown's gifts right discernment son of man prophecy like if you're not called to be a prophet you're not going to have with us saith the Lord come out of you right you know so you know just the fact that Peter James and John were together didn't make them more loved it just means they had a certain commission from God and God is impartial of course you know he's impartial but he does reward the faithful comers the faithful worshipers praise God God is not a respecter of persons his love is towards all praise God all who will receive him and God loved job despite job's sufferings his love was was manifest despite all of job's sufferings and then we saw how we ought to be thankful for God's love and uh the the whole reason John called himself the disciple whom loved because he had identified himself as the object of God's love and each one of us can take that attitude here tonight I am the object of God's love praise God God loves me and uh you know I'm always reminded this quote you know the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are the bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world remember the Bible said we're chosen in Christ so we were chosen in love because God is love Christ is love so we were chosen in love Hallelujah does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass amen so I just you know I actually have eight I thought of another right before I was coming out I didn't have a chance to type it up here but there's at least eight proofs of love God's love there's actually probably you know innumerable numbers but just briefly the first proof is Christ's death the fact that all history has to acknowledge Jesus died whether they say he was the son of God or not they all have to admit he was a man and he walked this Earth and that he died but the Bible said God proves his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him praise God so God proved his love by letting Christ die we know John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so because he loved he gave and because we love we should give of ourselves whether in service and the Bible says don't let us just love in word only but in indeed as well praise God help us to love in word and deed so that's the first proof is his death second is there's nothing that can separate us from this love that's another proof you know the Bible said death life Angels principalities Powers things present things to come uh height depth any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord praise God and you see this in the apostles life no matter what they went through they still had the love of God Amen see so so see there's nothing that can ever separate us from the love of God no matter what trials we go through nothing will be able to separate us God's love is eternal it's abiding Hallelujah uh it's immovable praise God and nothing can separate us from the love of God number three like this is hezekiah's prayer Hezekiah said the fact that he was saved from death proved God loved him Austin was talking about almost a car accident he got into last week Malachi and I almost got into car accident a few days ago God was gracious to us remember he stepped out okay but the very fact God saved you from an untimely death shows that God loves you he said behold for peace I had great bitterness but thou in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou has cast all my sins behind thy back amen not only does he save our natural life he saves our spiritual life amen by sending all of our sins away so if you can think of any time God saved your life that was his love to you number four he guarantees this love will never he'll never leave us or forsake us right and every believer can recognize this God has never left us God has never forsaken us despite your sins despite our shortcomings God will still answer prayer God will still show you favor God will still show you good things praise God despite like us not deserving it he guaranteed it I'll never leave you nor forsake you praise God that has to be love hallelujah it's a proof of God's love even even Jesus said you know how the father sends rain on the just and the unjust he's good unto The Sinner and the saint praise God that proves God is a loving God Amen amen for people that don't deserve it he still sends rain he still gives food he still gives Sunshine he still gives healing he even heals the sinners and so his this is a guarantee he never leave us nor forsake us a fourth proof that he loves us number five he promises to correct us he won't let us go through life without showing us where we need help as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent I love this along with this idea he corrects us he comes and fellowships with us right he tells us to open the door he'll come and he'll he'll sup with us the Bible says and he with me a great sign even after mistakes even after your shortcomings God will still come and love us and spend time with us even though we don't deserve it a great sign of God's love number six the fact that he lets us experience salvation of the fact that he lets us feel like we were dead but now alive that shows his love for us the fact that we get to experience salvation the fact that we can feel the burden of sin roll away the fact that we can feel uh refreshed amen hallelujah is God's love to us because the Bible said God who's rich in Mercy for his great love wherein he hath loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and has raised us up and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus if we've ever felt God's anointing if we've ever felt God's love if we've ever felt God's accepted us then it was God's great love that did it for us number seven he actually calls us his beloved uh speaking of Jeremiah 31 3 the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee so just as God Drew Israel just as God brought Israel unto himself so God brings us unto him Hallelujah you didn't the Bible said you didn't really go looking for God God came looking for you praise God so the fact that that God Drew you to himself the fact that the message came to find you amen or you're born into it amen either way the message came to find you it found your parents praise God right so God at some point came in other words some generation had to rise out of sin and some generation had to stand up and say I know God loves me I believe this word I'm standing on the word of God Amen look an everlasting love he's loved us with an everlasting love and then I love you know Romans 9 is what I quote my prayer closet like I told you uh the Bible specifically says God loves the Gentiles and he saith also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them year not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God aren't you glad you're a child of God Amen you're more than a child of your parents or you're more than a child a a product of of the educational system of America you're more than American Hallelujah you're a child of God hallelujah he says these are my beloved I specifically call them they're my beloved people now number eight is God set his love on us uh so I I guess I can go there Deuteronomy uh seven seven maybe I can pull it up here yeah I guess I got it right there that's gonna be hard to see uh Deuteronomy 7 7 let me do the view here now why this is uh applicable to us we'll see in just a moment God's speaking to Moses to tell Israel the Lord did not set his love upon you so God has God has placed his love where it's God's love is aimed at you hallelujah it's set on you like there's a certain path coming down from heaven and that and that I set my love on brother amen and Sisterhood like I I set my love on us and Elena praise God you know I can put each one of your names in there God said it it's aimed right at you praise God he nor excuse you because you were more a number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn on your father's hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman for the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt so this links back to Abraham the fathers of the faith right so God loved Israel because he loved their fathers but the Bible says you're a child of Abraham Hallelujah in Galatians 3 verse 7 know ye therefore they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham so see you have to be one that God has set his love on because you're a child of Abraham and God said I chose you I love you because I set my love on your fathers so you can so you God loves you because you're a child of Abraham Hallelujah so right there is eight reasons undeniable proof that God loves you praise God let me find my yeah notes every like I said I'm going to try not to be too long here tonight now going back to John John is a type of the Jew Gentile bride so the fact that John leans Upon Jesus bosom we can look at that and say that's the disciple that that types us we want to be that disciple because he was so he was so dedicated to Jesus he was constantly leaning on his bosom right and the closest Fellowship right I mean as his two brothers Jesus and John as two men you can't get any more close than that praise God if a man just leaning in your bosom and you know he's just gonna be right there you're just going to be close to your heart praise God and so John is this a type of this disciple who wants to be near the heart of Christ right and that's why we want to be uh like David a man after God's Own Heart so John is a beautiful example of that in the New Testament how he was one to be so much with Jesus he leaned on his bosom wasn't enough to be around him he had to be right up in his heart amen oh thank God let us be in the heart of God Amen Hallelujah now he's a type of the Bride because of Revelation 4 verse 1. so I'm going to just read these briefly because the seven Church ages are in Revelation chapter two and three and then in Revelation 4 1 and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven in the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter so in other words right after the church ages and John gets raptured right to see things that are in heaven so that's a type of the church the church goes through seven Church ages after the laodiceem the church goes up to heaven Hallelujah there's a door open in heaven and then in Revelation 10 8 through 11 John eats a book but he just doesn't eat it for himself the Bible said go and take the little book which is open the hand of the Angel which sinneth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I'm gonna go down to verse 11. he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings so John represents someone in the end time when the seals are broken who eats the word of God and then prophesies it to the Gentile Nations so this speaks of a gentile Ministry praise God and that's us also uh the the fact John's gospel is the fourth gospel that represents the force the fourth Beast which is the eagle so I got a picture of that so John's John's John is the fourth book Matthew Mark Luke John and the fourth beast that's mentioned is the eagle and it's one of those four beasts that surround the throne praise God and of course the eagle anointing was for the end time because Eagle represents a Seer a prophet right Jehovah Likens himself unto an eagle I bear Israel Out On Eagle's Wings I mean I got a YouTube video on that where Moses and Aaron are like it under those wings of an eagle praise God where God draws God brings out his people On Eagle's Wings and God is a spirit and God is the father of Prophecy Hallelujah the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy praise God so we can see here how how John types this Jew Gentile Church okay and also the fact he leaned on Jesus's bosom uh the fact that he wanted to be in close proximity uh to all the other uh I'm sorry to Christ more so it seems than all the other disciples he wanted to be right in the bosom of Christ praise God now I don't have time for all this but there's eight women in chapter four of my 2021 book there's eight Old Testament women that typed this Jew Gentile bride as well you have Rebecca as anath Sarah I mean you can just go on and on Solomon's bride you have all these all these types um and so we we see John as one of those types he's the disciple whom Jesus loved praise God he recognized himself as as one that Jesus loved and I want to skip ahead now um to more of John's verses here's where I left off when I when I gave that uh when I gave that sermon about God's love for brother Austin I got left off at this part here I was showing how when John wrote his book the book of First John he used the word love many many times and so the Bible said whoever keeps the word of God God's love will be made perfect in you see Church you know you'll grow in God's love if you just obey the word of God you don't have to worry am I going to love God more in 2023 yeah because I'm going to keep the word of God I mean it's a promise if you keep God's word you grow in God's love he that loveth his brother abides in the light and there's no occasion of something in him hallelujah how do I know I'm walking in the light I'm I'm confessing my sins and loving my brothers love not the world neither the things are in the world if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in them so we have to make sure we do not love the world we've got to make sure we love the word of God because he that do is the word the word of God abides forever amen the Bible said what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God Amen I just showed you eight reasons God loves you and then John says what I mean what kind of love is this that we get to be called sons of God hallelujah therefore the world doesn't know us right our families persecute us right brother Chris you know Sinners persecutives people mock us because they don't know God if they knew God they would love God and love us praise God but what amazing love God has for us that we can be called the children of God amen the Bible said whosoever born of is born of God does not commit sin for his sin remain I'm sorry seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God so I want to look at this more in another sermon I want to look at that thought of how brother Graham said your soul never did it in the first place I want to look at that thought later on not today but I want to get to that thought eventually so this is the great a paradox right between the soul and the spirit this is where I was ending the last time I preached on this kind of on this thought the Bible says we must confess our sins if we don't confess our sins we're Liars but then the Bible says your soul never sinned to begin with so it's a great Paradox you have a part of you that's never sinned that's why in some songs we can Rejoice because part of us has never sinned but then other songs talk about the struggle with sin and overcoming sin and how we need those songs too praise God we have sermons where we emphasize God's great love and and how how God chose us before the foundation world but then we have sermons where we have to emphasize the struggle with sin and constantly confessing sin and dying out to self right mortifying uh your flesh right because it's a paradox you and I are paradoxes we have a part of us that's never sinned and then two part of us has constantly sinned and then this is the message God gave that we should love one another you say I believe the message what's the message love one another if you if you ask them if somebody asked you what is the message and said what does the Bible say the message is the Bible said God is light and we love one another yeah Hallelujah yeah exactly right that's good brother yeah we call ourselves message churches well the Bible has to Define what is the message the message is God is light there's no darkness in God right we have the light of God and the message is we should love one another now we know there's many other ways to say it the revelation of the word the restoration of the message the restoration of the Bible but if you just looked up the word message the message is God is light and we're to love one another praise God in other words God is light and then we are God's children and we show the light of God as well Hallelujah now that's where we stopped and then I did the Austin love to the Lord I also put Jesse love the Lord in there too and you should put your own name in there as well now we know now here are some more scriptures we know we pass from death into life why because we love the brother so that's a good sign you are born again when you love God's people he that loveth not his brother abides in death and that's that scripture that says some people are dead while they're alive right so that's where people get that's where the world gets the zombie idea right they get zombies this idea from the scripture because the Bible says if someone's not a Christian they're dead while they're alive right their soul is dead while their bodies alive oh but with us we've got a living soul and a living body praise God hallelujah my little children here's what I was saying earlier let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed in truth again remember it doesn't it doesn't do anything for us to say we can help somebody unless we actually act upon it and help someone praise God just saying nice things isn't good enough we've got to have actions behind our words I'm trying to watch my time here he that keepeth his Commandments dwells in him and he in him praise God so the more we obey God's word the more we'll feel his presence abiding in our lives Hallelujah now first John 4 7-21 uses the word over love over 12 times this is jam-packed full of love so I'm going to read it right now if you have your Bible you can go there with me if you want to read along if not you just listen and say Amen that's option two first John 4 7. let's talk about a love chapter brother I mean we think we talk about First Corinthians 13 that's true but here is also another love chapter verse seven beloved let us love one another for God is of love I'm sorry for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we love God so our love for God isn't the real love of God right but he that loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins so our love is not the greatest love God's love is the greatest love beloved if God so loved us we are also to love one another verse 12 no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he and God and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him oh so important to love amen when you love God is with you and in you and everyone knows you're a Christian praise God again hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world now here's some real mature love right here that when we die we'll be bold we'll be bold knowing I'm going to see Jesus I'm not going to the Grave I'm not going to I'm sorry I'm not I'm not going to Hades or I'm not going to the the prison house and the Heart of the earth I'm going to see Jesus praise God see love produces this confidence amen if you want to be more confident about a Christian walk let's love one another better praise God hallelujah we want more boldness about the Rapture more bonus about our Christian Life we need to love each other better praise God remember God will lead us to that love is the key Love Is The Answer Hallelujah we see it playing in the description I hear Verse 18 beautiful there is no fear in love now this is sinful fear right because we have that we need the fear of the Lord that's that reverence that respect but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torments and now you know what the wrong kind of fear is when you're tormented under condemnation from Satan that's the wrong kind of fear but that's different from conviction oh Lord I don't want to do this Lord I need to make this right that's different right he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hate his brother he's a liar see we can't say oh I'm a message believer I love God and then hate message people right we can't say that for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen see we really got to make sure we love who we can see if we can love who we can see we can love who we can't see praise God Hallelujah that's exactly right Hallelujah we have to love who God made and then that proves we love the invisible God the maker of all men verse 21 and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also it's a commandment love God and love his people praise God first John 5 1-5 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him that's right brother said the bride won't persecute the bride now does the bride correct the bride yes Paul had to correct Peter right Hallelujah there's numerous examples verse Two by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and I said verse five so who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth Jesus is the son of God Amen oh just it's a what a summary of God's love Hallelujah loving others is the proof that we love God Hallelujah so God help us to continue to love one another how are we going to do that this year Hallelujah God help us to do it he will now remember disciples learn to love the Bible is clear about this we're Disciples of Christ because John was the disciple Jesus loved a disciple is a learner Jesus said whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple right so to be a disciple to be a learner of Jesus that's what we all want to be we must take up our cross which cross represents a slow death in other words there's going to be times where it's difficult to love but we're going to crucify that difficult feeling and we're still going to love you okay so now I'm getting down to the real daily life thing okay the everyday life and maybe you may have a hard feeling towards somebody right you may have a hard feeling but you still got to press through that you got to take up the cross and you got to learn how to love even when the person seems unlovable you have to learn to love even when it's hard to love right that's why you're called a disciple that's why it's okay to be angry it's okay to be upset it's okay to struggle because you're still learning how to love you don't love perfectly yet no one loves perfectly except for Christ so see we read all those beautiful scriptures about God love it sounds also good but it comes down to the fact that we've got to learn how to love amen praise God and we will we have to just have to take up the cross we have to die to ourselves and then learn how to love and the church said amen amen I'm almost at half an hour I'm at 28 minutes so just bear with me here by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have loved one toward another this is one of the proofs that you're a child of God when you can love each other and then Jesus prays his last prayer with his disciples i in them and that at least you know before uh yeah I think it was his last prayer yeah I in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has set me and has loved them as thou has loved me what a statement Jesus says when the disciples are loving each other everyone's going to know that God loves them just like God loved his son Jesus what a statement what a statement Hallelujah loving other people proves that you're going to be loved like God loved Jesus was it always easy for Jesus no it's always going to easy be easy for you and I no but what we want is we want God's grace to be able to say Lord let thy will be done not my will be done that's the greatest thing we can do is submit our will to Christ Hallelujah verse 26 I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I in them praise God hallelujah Jesus wants his love to be in us so people can feel the love of Christ through us hallelujah which I as I said numerous times people when they come here they feel the love of God and we've got to keep it that way praise God and I believe we can grow in God's love too I I don't I'm not sure if we're a five-star loved church yet but like I gave that rating last night in other words I always want to leave room for growth praise God I do I do believe that yes and then you know I love this song the one we sang this morning the one you love as soon as I heard that song I love that song and then I started to think about I want to go through some scriptures about that song So if you got your Bibles uh let's I don't have these scriptures up here but when I first heard this song There were some script some parts of the song I was like what I don't understand that but as I started thinking about it I thought this is a song about renewing the joy of salvation so I forgot your Bible go to Psalm 103 and maybe I have some readers out there this would be a good time Sunday school kids if you want to read Hallelujah if you missed your chance to read this would be a good chance to read Psalm 103 verse 8. I saw Haven's eyes light up doing reedhaven I tried to read the faces you know do I wouldn't are you looking at me like I want to read or don't don't call on me which is okay you don't have to read it Psalms 103 verse 8. yeah I love this song I was trying to work some Jesus into it you know the name of Jesus into it still gotta work on that um but the song says I can be real with you and say anything and not be afraid so I take an eternal perspective with that this is a song for the the redeemed right and the reason I say that it has to be Eternal perspective because even Paul blasphemed Jesus but Paul didn't know Jesus was the Messiah after he knew Jesus was the Messiah he never blessed him in him again right uh so Psalm 103 verse 8 Haven during the read uh eight I'm sorry three I'm sorry sorry eight and eight to twelve I'll read eight to twelve hey man can we can we hear a more beautiful scripture I mean it's our related to forgiveness could you hear a more beautiful scripture God is merciful he's slow to anger God don't get quickly angry with you right away whoa you had one mistake today I'm angry with it that's not God right he has not given us what we deserve Hallelujah and as high as Heaven is above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward the end of fear oh you can really make you can really go far from the earth the heavens go really far from the Earth light years and the church said this shows God's Mercy is light years working for us it's working so far from us or so so it's working so far to us right you all the way up to Heaven's Throne it works all the way God's Mercy is so great it's so massive and expansive praise God makes us love the Lord even more verse 12 as far as the East is from the West so complete opposites right that's how far God has sent away his sins from you praise God as far as they can possibly be God's completely separated completely forgiven his great love he's a father who loves his children praise God lady do you want to read 13 uh through 16. amen now does that sound right you know God has pity when his children go through trials you know he allows him to go through trials but he pities them just like he did job you know job Elijah who told job you called yourself more righteous than God and God didn't strike job dead job sat there and said I'm just and you're unjust and God did not Smite him dead why because God pities his children and the church said amen and God's mercy on job was very great amen it was from the Earth to the High Heavens Hallelujah God had great Mercy on job how about the songwriter who said where's my God where is God how many times have you asked that let's see God is merciful to you he says he never leaves you nor forsake you but then you question where are you right but then God has mercy on you he has Grace upon you because he loves you praise God see I can be real with God I can say anything and not be afraid God knows I'm going to go through trials and God is going to bring me through the trials praise God see we've never purposely blasphemed now verse 17 18 but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his Covenant and to those that remember his Commandments to do them so of course it's conditional right but we're taking an eternal perspective God has always foreknown me I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world so I can be real with God I'm not afraid of losing my salvation he saved me by grace and I'll have the fear of the Lord if I'm wrong God will correct me and I'll make it right praise God so see and which of these which of these men of God didn't say harsh things you know all men all men and women say harsh things against God said you owe me something and God said no I don't owe you anything you know we all we all say things we wish we would have had said but as a father pities his children as a father understands you know they're just still developing they're still young so God understands we're still developing we're not Eternal yet but one day we will be Eternal praise God Hallelujah he's merciful gracious slow to anger and he has plenty of Mercy For Us Church and you know the Bible says you know the song says you made me and you like what you made you made me and you don't make mistakes Psalm 139 is familiar I'm fearfully and wonderfully made the Bible says see God made you now let's read the one I mentioned this morning Exodus 4 11. this this is uh sober and this is a very sobering verse I remember my wife mentioned this and I thought oh that's right I forgot about that verse Moses complains and says well I can't go talk to pharaoh and God asking these great questions Moses was slow of speech that means he didn't talk fast and I'm kind of a fast talker Moses was not that way he's very slow can you imagine a slow preacher and the church said amen you'd be like finishing it before he said it that's right amen just say it well Moses was slow you might be happy I'm a fast preacher Maybe but he was a slow of tongue the Bible says and he tells God I'm not eloquent verse 11 and the Lord said him who made man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord see the Lord made you and the Lord doesn't make mistakes Hallelujah now it's sobering right because we have we have friends who have children with disabilities you know friends I have a friend in Minnesota brother Russell my children met him he has a son who has uh I think Down syndrome it's a really severe case and he's got to be just in his chair all the time and it's I prayed for him we prayed for him he's still that in that condition you know and but God made it the Bible says God did that but you know Church a lot of times in those situations some of those children have the sweetest Spirits now not always but a lot of times those children have such sweet Spirits they just put so much joy on people's faces like I remember my high school friend he had a child with Down Syndrome and uh you know he put all these pictures on Facebook that was when I was on sale on Facebook and this was the cutest little kid you'd ever want to see like they did videos and it was they did all these videos he was such a loving little boy you know and you know some people get mad at that doctors would say abort that child but God says I'm making it and it's for a purpose trust my love trust my love hallelujah how many One Trust God's love so I mean so these lyrics you know the first time I heard him I was like wow so I can understand these better you know say uh this the song says you take me just as I am and Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest for your souls Hallelujah Jesus said come God bless you Decorah good to see you Hallelujah so the song says you take me just as I am Jesus didn't say well get rid of your pain first and then come to me he said no come to me and then I'll give you rest see people want to try to get rid of things before they come to Jesus no just come to Christ just come to the word and Christ will give you what you need praise God Hallelujah he takes us all just as we are the Bible said all have fallen short of the glory of God all have sinned and come short of the glory of God no one deserves it so we just at some point we've got to make a decision I I have I'm faulty I have all these problems but I'm coming to Jesus and he'll take care of it praise God if I'm Restless he'll give me rest amen if I'm mourning he'll give me a dance praise God hallelujah if I'm sick he'll make me well praise God if I'm hateful he'll give me mercy praise God he'll give me love instead of hatred praise God that's what he says he says just come as you are in all of our situations right you choose me all over again the Bible says I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of world so if I'm chosen in Christ before the world was ever formed then he'd always choose me because he chose me at the beginning praise God before there ever was a world he already chose me before that so he choose me again he can't make a mistake and say I made the wrong choice I should not have chose brother Jesse I should have chose somebody else he wouldn't change it because his choice is always right the first time let me read Malachi or Malachi he read Malachi 3 7. okay oh you got your Bob okay sorry about that Malachi 37 this was reminded me of this he'd choose me all over again in other words despite what God knows and what God has seen about the failures of my life he still loves me he still choose me again and that's what the Bible says now this is just one there's many verses like this but Malachi go and read that amen if you just return to me if you just come as you are I'll return to you see you choose me he would choose us all over again right your fathers have neglected me so in other words two three generations have neglected me but come back to me I'll choose you again Hallelujah and I'm the one you love I already read that out of Hosea right nine and then Romans 9 25. you the Gentiles were not God's beloved but now you are beloved no one can hear no one here can say I'm not loved of God because the Bible says the Gentiles are loved of God Hallelujah let's all say let's say I'm God's beloved ready I am God's beloved let's say it again ready I am God's beloved I like that say with some conviction praise God I am God's beloved Hallelujah he loves me praise God now this is a this this is the line that got me the hardest like I didn't have understanding this I don't have to prove anything well the Bible says prove all things but that's for them that's for the ministry right prove all the truths but if you just look at this as a song of Salvation we don't have to prove anything because we're not saved by our works we're saved by grace if you and I can brag about anything then Jesus didn't have to die for us right so don't come to Jesus and say look what I've done no I don't have to prove anything I wasn't the sacrifice I needed a sacrifice and God provided it for me praise God amen I'm going to just read that because it's a beautiful scripture Ephesians 2 8-9 and thank you people for reading if I've called upon you real abruptly thank you for understanding Ephesians 2 8 and 9. now remember this is the same chapter of the great love we talked about earlier right the great love verse eight for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves you cannot save yourself I cannot save myself Christ saves us it is the gift of God salvation is a gift Saints you just you just got to accept the gift praise God not of Works lest any man should boast just a reminder I don't have to prove anything Christ's already proved it for me he proved I was lovable beforehand because he died for me praise God he proved I was worthy of being saved amen he proved I was worthy of being forgiven because he gave himself praise God he became the sacrifice and I accepted to praise God he proved it all Hallelujah he proved everything I want us to prove I'm good enough to go to heaven Jesus already proved it Hallelujah I don't have to prove I'm good enough for the Rapture Jesus already proved it he gave you the Holy Ghost amen he gave me the Holy Ghost that's how you know Hallelujah he already proved it Hallelujah he gives us the Holy Ghost and there's room at your table for me Psalm 23 5 said thou preparest a table for me in the prince of mine enemies like Esther Esther had a table prepared in the prince of Haman see God God brings enemies around to prove who's the real believer when your dad had that Feast I believe that was God when they celebrate your dad being healed I believe that was God preparing a feast in the presence of some of our enemies were there now say that in love but the only one your mom thanked was our church I couldn't understand her mung I'm not saying I understand Hmong that's the only time she smiled during that whole time was when she talked about us that's just my guess so if I'm wrong you can correct me after surface but there were some enemies at least I know some of my enemies were there at least I should say that uh or at least one enemy maybe maybe a couple more oh yes right some of the yeah some of the pastors had told people not to come to our church so yes there was a couple enemies I had there but God I felt like God gave us a table in the prince of our enemies praise God and then Luke 14 23 let's read that Luke 14 23. now this is the parable of the great supper I love this verse this is the one where Jesus sends out invitation come to the supper and people just make Excuse excuse you know houses money marriage land all these excuses and Jesus said send them out again my table must be filled praise God verse 24 for I say unto you that none of those I'm sorry verse 23 and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my my house may be filled amen look Church there are so many people that don't want to come to the marriage supper but you're one of them that wants to come and is proven because you're here feasting at the Master's spiritual table praise God and if you're here eating at the spiritual table no doubt you'll be at God's physical table as well praise God because you don't get to the physical table unless you eat the spiritual food of God first oh Hallelujah see sometimes you got to compel people to come in come to Christ come to hear the word of God come let the word of God change your life come as you are amen you don't have to prove anything just come to Jesus if you need rest he'll give you rest if you need strength he'll give you strength if you need forgiveness he'll give you forgiveness if you need peace they'll give you peace he's your Waymaker praise God amen I have to prove anything there's room at the table for me Church Hallelujah the Bible said he that's an overcomer Revelation 3 21 will sit with me in my Throne as I sat down with my father in his throne see he's got he's got a place at the throne there's a table there's a place on the throne for you praise God if you overcome sin and then in Revelation 19 9 says we're invited the Bible says we're invited to the marriage supper lamb blessed is he that's been invited to the marriage suffer the lamb praise God there's a place at God's table for you hallelujah how do you believe that and the second verse I know you're proud of me Jesus says when that when the man comes back who's invested all of his talents he says well done my good and faithful servant in other words I'm proud of you brother man said God look down from heaven saw David dancing he said that's a man after my That's my boy she's proud of him yeah I brought him he's dancing for me praise God Amen and God was proud of job God looked at the Devil and said have you considered my servant job there's none like him in the Earth don't you think that's don't you think that's parents being proud of their kids he said he said even he even said this there's none like him in the entire Earth that's a that's a that's quite a compliment right there that's quite a brag on your boy imagine if I said that there's no boys like Malachi some of you get what do you mean what about my son what about well I'm not saying that for sure I'm saying that's what God said about Job amen God's the one who sets all this up right he does it by God God looks at their their their surrender God looks at their dedication God looks at their diligence praise God and then God knows who's most diligent who is running who's dying to self most amen who's dying to their self daily God help us all to Die daily praise God let God figure out who's the greatest we're not going to argue about it like they are today we're not going to argue about it we're just going to try to serve the Lord the best we can and then Hebrews yeah if you want to know you're well pleasing God do this in Hebrews 13. God is well pleased with his children that means he's proud of you with a spiritual holy Pride Hebrews 13 15. we know God has no sinful Pride Hebrews 13 15. there we are by him therefore let us offer to say I'm sorry the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased notice that sacrifices communicate means to associate or fellowship with so constantly give God praise constantly give God thanks and be around God's people God is well pleased with you child Hallelujah isn't that what you do every week I thought I'd get a little more louder amens on that one but yeah I never know it's always God you know God yeah I never know which one's gonna get the loudest amen we charge you if you're arguing to sacrifice of praise if you're constantly communicating with the six thousand from Heaven says that's right that's what I want I'm well pleased with you there's a place on my table amen You're The One I Love now I'm not a perfect child none of us have to look up any Scripture on that we just got to look at our lives the last two hours or maybe the last 20 minutes we're not perfect but we still make father smile Psalm 62 4-5 I believe that's my last one yeah I'm almost done so just so you know I'm almost done I was going to try to it's been under an hour it's been 49 minutes here yeah 49 minutes so I'm 62. I know you're tired I didn't want to wear anybody out but I just want to get this thought out about the love of God in that beautiful Church all those proofs that God loves you Hallelujah God has set his love on you he looks down and says I love you Bank I got a Channel of love I'm just going to pour out my love to brother Bank all God's people because God loves us we should love each other so I'm 62. I'm sorry having a hard time getting her hurry up brother John hurry up okay there it is 62. they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly I'm in the wrong spot I wrote down the wrong that's not the right verse there no that's the wrong one I know Zephaniah is right but uh where did I get that one I don't know how to go back and look in the scripture so I'm 62 4 and 5. I'm in psalm 62. no that's not it um it's a good scripture about expectation but amen preached on the you need expectations scripture there's another one but let's go to Zephaniah 3 yeah sorry about that I'm disappointed in that God is proud of all of his children Hallelujah remember church I don't want this verse on there but the Bible says there's rejoicing in the presence of the Angels when a sinner repents so I don't know who's rejoicing I don't know if it's the Angels rejoicing or I don't know but the Bible says there's rejoicing in the prince of angels over one sinner who repents in other words there's somebody in heaven giving God glory because you got saved Hallelujah think about that heaven's I'm sorry hell is screaming and and upset about it but Heaven's rejoicing amen hallelujah amen devils are fleeing out of your life Hallelujah devils are being constantly cast out of your mind cast out of your life but Heaven's rejoicing Hallelujah because your name's been written there praise God before the foundation of the world your name was written on the last book of life Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus I can't believe I didn't get that verse right was Zephaniah 3. all right Zechariah I'm having a hard time there it is there okay I was going to say where is it all right now this is a beautiful uh book here short book he prophesied around the time of Josiah so just a few Kings before Israel was uh totally taken away zedekiah was the last king of course uh before Babylon overthrew Israel put them all into exile okay but this is a beautiful prophecy so Zephaniah rebukes him in chapters one and two but then in chapter three he gives him hope for the future George aren't you glad you got hope praise God Hallelujah there is hope for the future praise God verse uh we'll start at 14. seeing o Daughter of Zion shout o Israel be glad to Rejoice with all the heart oh daughter of Jerusalem the Lord had taken away thy judgments and has cast out thine enemy the king of Israel even the Lord is in the midst of thee Thou shalt not see evil anymore this has to be the Millennium right you're not going to see any more evil that has to be the Millennium right verse 16. in that day it should be said to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion let not thine hands be slack look at verse 17. the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mine now church is he not in our midst today he said wherever two or three gathered there I am in the midst praise God and the Bible just said we don't have to have fear the Bible said perfect love can cast out fear praise God God does not give us the spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind Hallelujah so we see the spiritual aspect this is a natural prophecy to Israel probably for the Millennium but we see the spiritual prophecy for the bride the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee he is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy now church if he rejoices over the Jews then you know he rejoices over the Gentiles because he said the Jews were my people but now the Gentiles are my people praise God God rejoices over your service brother amen Hallelujah I can say that God rejoices that you got saved brother Chris it says he will rejoice let's all say he ready he didn't say they which the Angels might Rejoice but God rejoices ah God already knows it's going to happen but when it happens he rejoices in the real time amen or the time of of time he's outside of time but within time he rejoices in time the Bible said he will rejoice over thee with joy so see does God smile that's your church oh yeah he's got joy you ever seen somebody with joy that never smiles how can you have joy and not smile thank you that's right we're not cucumbers Hallelujah but see I still make my father smile he still rejoices Heaven rejoices when you get saved somebody in heaven I don't know if it's the Angels but somebody's rejoicing when you got saved right and then when you win souls like Austin winning Souls praise God hallelujah pointing Chris to the church amen sister Lena Hallelujah see God has Joy over you Hallelujah let's finish that verse he will rest in his love he will Joy over them with singing so God will now this is some people think God sings God might sing but either God will sing or he'll have the Angels Sing this is when all Israel comes back to the promised land in the Millennium God is going to have singing and he's going to Rejoice all my people or come back but Church he's already he's currently rejoicing right now because you are his beloved you are his people God rejoices over you I still make my father smile praise God let's stand up our feet has 50 55 minutes praise God did you think it was possible musicians can come let's play that song if you were there uh I'm the one you the one you love we sang at the end and that's why I had all my heart I was thinking I was thinking about that verse all last night and I was praying in my prayer closet this
