[14:30] brother Simon flies out from Thailand to
[14:32] come back home he and I've just been
[14:35] texting a little bit but he's really
[14:36] happy he's had a lot of open doors I
[14:38] don't know any details but then he'll be
[14:40] here next weekend we'll probably share
[14:41] about this trip
[14:43] he's been really happy a lot of open
[14:45] doors he told me yesterday he was almost
[14:47] crying on his voicemail he's like he
[14:49] visited a pastor in Thailand they don't
[14:51] know the message this pastor started
[14:53] like five six churches in this remote
[14:55] area and he took all this money that he
[14:58] ever made and he built a huge house then
[15:00] he he started taking orphans into the
[15:02] house so you have they have 35 orphans
[15:05] and it's in their house and then he
[15:07] built himself a real small house but
[15:10] then he goes and sleeps with the orphans
[15:11] every night just to give them you know
[15:14] protection you know man what a what a
[15:18] faithful servant that is he said he was
[15:20] open to receiving the message so
[15:21] hopefully God I think that was his last
[15:23] sermon he was gonna preach to that man
[15:24] because he was Simon was staying with
[15:26] that man but these are the people that
[15:28] they're they're ministering to they get

[15:31] they know about Jesus they know about
[15:35] you sorry for the sisters in the nursery

[15:39] know more about him but look at look at
[15:42] what just the you know the past the past
[15:45] carcasses of the aged they're feeding on
[15:47] that and look what it produces such a

[39:36] [Music]
[39:48] [Music]
[40:09] [Music]
[41:16] just like to take a familiar scripture
[41:18] here the vein looks like get this new
[41:27] one here by God's grace okay we'll try
[41:30] we'll try this wildest monkey
[41:44] Jeremiah chapter 1 we like to look at
[41:46] purpose part 31 today of course Jeremiah
[41:57] was a prophet at the end of Israel's
[42:00] time in the promised land he actually
[42:04] saw Zedekiah the last king taken out
[42:08] he saw the dispersion but he was
[42:11] ordained for such a time as that I love
[42:14] those words that Esther said you know
[42:16] Mordecai told her you were born for such
[42:18] a time as that and so are we we can
[42:20] apply that to every age whose God has a
[42:22] time and season for everything so we can
[42:24] say today that you and I were born for
[42:27] such a time as this we're born to be
[42:29] overcomers and Laodicea it's all Malachi
[42:32] so I may need to turn it up there buddy
[42:34] I'm not sure oh it's not showing up okay
[42:36] can everybody hear it though does at
[42:38] least work for that no okay why do we
[42:44] have a couple extra batteries up here
[42:45] I'll try that in just a minute but let's
[42:46] read our text here before we take a seat
[42:48] by God's grace I'm sorry Jeremiah one
[42:53] that just read verses four five six and
[43:01] seven here Jeremiah 1 verse 4 then the
[43:05] word of Lord came unto me saying and I
[43:08] saw read verse five one two three before
[43:11] i form the in the belly I knew thee and
[43:15] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[43:17] I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[43:21] prophet unto the nations and I'll keep
[43:24] reading verse six then said i Lord God
[43:27] behold I cannot speak for I am a child
[43:30] verse seven but the Lord said unto me
[43:32] say not I am a child for thou shalt go
[43:35] to all that I shall send thee and
[43:37] whatsoever I command thee thou shalt
[43:40] speak praise God
[43:42] may God has blessings Remus word may be
[43:43] seated I'm gonna try to switch out the
[43:47] batteries real quick and see if that
[43:48] works
[43:48] Oh was workin the nursery it's working
[43:53] in one place but not in the other
[43:59] so mommy can hear in the nursery but the
[44:02] live streamers can't is that might just
[44:06] be the Pope of mic yeah that's
[44:08] definitely on so should I use both how
[44:14] about that
[44:15] laughs these both today whatever take
[44:19] sprays hot to get people to hear the
[44:21] word of God amen
[44:22] I'll use both how about that phrase gah
[44:27] so praise the Lord yeah well that's
[44:29] great yeah I'd like to hear that
[44:32] sometimes I don't know if everybody can
[44:34] hear but I know everybody can hear that
[44:39] so praise oh let me get organized here a
[44:42] little bit by God's grace so we read our
[44:45] text out of Jeremiah and we're gonna be
[44:47] looking at this thought on purpose I
[44:52] have some some quotes here so you can
[44:58] you can switch over here I do have a few
[45:00] quotes in a little bit but I want to
[45:08] start with the the text here I read from
[45:13] Jeremiah because this was just on my
[45:15] heart and the Bible says that before I
[45:22] formed in the belly I knew thee and
[45:25] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[45:27] I sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[45:29] prophet unto the nations I just want to
[45:33] make a few passing thoughts you know
[45:35] we've been looking at purpose now for
[45:37] quite a while almost a whole year and I
[45:40] wanted it I felt like it would go to the
[45:43] spot sorry it would go to the spot where
[45:46] each person could recognize their
[45:49] purpose in life and that deals with your
[45:51] gifts your callings God's plan you know
[45:55] your profession your family everything
[45:57] in life because we know that God ordains
[46:00] all these things and so I found a quote
[46:02] I want to read from the voice of the
[46:04] sign 1964 I didn't have time to put it
[46:06] up there I want to read it here
[46:10] there's only one form of eternal life if
[46:11] you've got eternal life then you
[46:13] yourself was in God's thinking before
[46:15] the world was created you're an
[46:18] attribute of his thinking because
[46:20] eternal never did begin or never can end
[46:22] you're a part of God's economy always
[46:25] and that's even though foolish version
[46:27] that's wise and foolish praise God
[46:29] because the Bible said Jesus in Matthew
[46:31] 25 says come and receive the kingdom
[46:34] prepared for you from the foundation of
[46:36] the world amen so Jesus knows the
[46:40] remnant and he you know if we could use
[46:42] cloth as an example Jesus uses all the
[46:45] cloth praise God
[46:46] he likes the the pattern that he cut out
[46:48] you know for his bride but he uses the
[46:50] cloth as well anyone who would be saved
[46:52] they're all part of God's economy praise
[46:55] God he said it's just reflecting it's
[46:59] becoming now they got one more picture
[47:01] to develop that's death then the
[47:03] negative becomes positive then you're in
[47:06] the bride with Christ as he thought so
[47:11] see brother man like kind of dramatizes
[47:13] your life is like a bunch of pictures
[47:14] and that's what we is what we all like
[47:16] to see right that's why we do Facebooker
[47:18] that's how you do your photo albums you
[47:20] like to see from the beginning all the
[47:21] way to the end brother Branham said your
[47:24] last picture is right before death but
[47:27] he said after that last picture then
[47:28] negative becomes a positive and you're
[47:32] in the bride and with Christ as he
[47:34] thought like husband and wife today so
[47:37] God Christ in the church will be the
[47:39] same he said now that's the elected and
[47:42] the called Moses was born a proper child
[47:46] the Bible said that one of the prophets
[47:48] Jeremiah God said before he was even
[47:50] formed in your mother's womb I ordained
[47:53] you a prophet to the nation's so let's
[47:57] just meditate on that for a moment that
[47:59] before
[48:00] Jeremiah was born God knew him and
[48:04] ordained him a prophet and look at that
[48:08] thought too about sanctified got it
[48:10] already sanctified him which means set
[48:13] apart right like brother Branham you
[48:16] know God had sanctified him to be a
[48:19] prophet so God made sure there were
[48:21] certain things in his life he
[48:23] didn't do like murder people praise God
[48:26] like smoke or drink right or chew
[48:29] tobacco God sanctified God had a calling
[48:33] and purpose now see God God's calling
[48:35] and purpose worked with his free more
[48:37] agency because God knew that brother
[48:39] Branham would always want to do that
[48:40] praise God
[48:41] God knew that brother Branham would
[48:43] accept his will for his life so because
[48:46] God foreknew what he would choose God
[48:49] could sanctify him beforehand and
[48:50] declare beforehand the things that he
[48:54] would do in his life just like Jeremiah
[48:56] God knew Jeremiah would be thrown in
[48:58] down into a pit praise God
[49:00] God knew Jeremiah would want to quit but
[49:03] God also knew that God would encourage
[49:05] Jeremiah praise God and all the faces
[49:08] God knew that look at Jeremiah and try
[49:11] to discourage him God knew that he would
[49:14] have to overcome that so God told him be
[49:16] not afraid of their faces for him with
[49:19] thee to deliver thee saith the Lord amen
[49:21] how I love that praise God he said I've
[49:27] set thee this day over the nations and
[49:30] over the kingdom's to root out to pull
[49:32] down to destroy to throw down to build
[49:35] and to plant praise god what a ministry
[49:38] that is it's like he just had to tear
[49:40] everything up and then start all over
[49:42] again
[49:42] praise God what a ministry he had to do
[49:45] and he did it faithfully praise God now
[49:48] I'm going back to the quote he said John
[49:50] the Baptist why he was identified in the
[49:52] scripture Isaiah 700 years before his
[49:56] coming said he's the voice of one crying
[49:58] in the wilderness prepare the way of the
[49:59] Lord and about four hundred years before
[50:02] his appearing again Malachi said behold
[50:04] I send my messenger before my face to
[50:07] prepare the way before thee see he was
[50:10] foreordained and so was all those
[50:12] Offices of God if they were called of
[50:15] God he says if they're elected I'm sorry
[50:19] he said if they're educated into it it's
[50:22] only cannon fodder see it can't be
[50:24] nothing if it's a meal ticket then you
[50:27] sell your birth rights for a meal ticket
[50:29] you'll compromise to go with the
[50:32] organization or with some group
[50:35] but if it's of God you'll stand by that
[50:38] word regardless because you were born to
[50:41] stand by it
[50:42] amen so Jeremiah suffered awfully right
[50:47] Isaiah who was sawed to pieces he
[50:50] suffered awfully for the word of God's
[50:52] sake John the Baptist suffered and died
[50:55] for the word of God's sake amen
[50:57] brother Branham was rejected by all the
[51:00] church world for God's sake and for the
[51:02] words sake amen
[51:03] and so we know we will experience the
[51:05] same will suffer rejection for the word
[51:07] of God's sake hallelujah but if we are
[51:11] truly caught of God will stand by the
[51:13] word regardless of what any man says or
[51:16] any group says or any family member says
[51:19] we'll stand with the word instead of
[51:21] standing with anyone else he said Moses
[51:25] no one could take his place no one else
[51:28] could do the job he was ordained to do
[51:31] it a men and brethren sister if you've
[51:34] got eternal life you were ordained to do
[51:37] a certain thing maybe a good housewife
[51:39] maybe something else but nobody can take
[51:42] your place God has made you a place
[51:45] don't try to take somebody else's place
[51:47] that's a carnal impersonation see shows
[51:51] there's something wrong with you be what
[51:55] you are just exactly don't be nothing
[51:58] else amen now that's a good place to
[52:01] start because roadman tells us not to
[52:03] take anybody whose place and be what you
[52:06] are but I want to say this we'll never
[52:08] really know what we are or ought to be
[52:10] until we're born again we're being born
[52:14] again is so crucial to defining your
[52:18] position and finding what God has called
[52:20] you to do
[52:21] it's so important to be born again first
[52:23] praise God and then wait upon the like
[52:26] Paul he got born again and then he went
[52:28] out to Arabia to wait upon his ministry
[52:30] praise God just like Moses you know we
[52:33] know he didn't get born again in the
[52:34] soul but but he believed in the soul
[52:38] praise God he did believe in his soul
[52:40] because the souls are righteous in those
[52:42] days and if they believe God then they
[52:44] were saved amen
[52:45] because the Bible said the raht the
[52:47] righteous soul of lot the Bible
[52:49] call it a righteous soul that's part of
[52:51] the thing I've been studying all week
[52:53] about the soul the soul can be saved and
[52:55] give me righteous and just not sealed
[52:57] yet praise God so that's the scripture
[53:01] has to be that way
[53:02] and the Old Testament had to be the same
[53:04] the same way we are by the promise of
[53:07] God saved by grace through faith amen
[53:10] because the Bible said abraham believed
[53:12] God and it was counted him righteousness
[53:15] amen so the same thing gonna be for a
[53:17] lot lot believe God and the Bible said
[53:20] he was a righteous soul praise God so he
[53:22] believed no because he couldn't live the
[53:24] life that Abraham lived but he believed
[53:26] enough to be saved amen and the Bible
[53:28] said his soul was righteous amen so you
[53:32] and I though we weary verse we receive
[53:34] more revelation that then days gone by
[53:38] and so we have more responsibility you
[53:40] and I see so many quotes week after week
[53:43] after week may God help us just to live
[53:45] those praise God amen because there are
[53:48] so many things that have been taught and
[53:49] preached and said to us and to me too
[53:52] and we've got to live all that we hear
[53:54] and I believe God is calling us higher
[53:56] to live more what we hear praise God but
[53:59] of course there's a time and season for
[54:01] it all praise God we said don't be
[54:04] nothing else a be what God made you to
[54:08] be like Jeremiah he can only be what God
[54:11] called him to be a prophet
[54:13] praise God a preacher of righteousness
[54:15] like Noah said L of him as well he can
[54:18] only be what God called him to be so you
[54:21] and I know if we repent of our sins we
[54:23] get sanctified and filled with the Holy
[54:25] Ghost and we learn to lean on the Holy
[54:28] Ghost
[54:28] we know that God will guide us into his
[54:31] perfect will for our lives and church it
[54:35] can't be something too mysterious we
[54:36] know it's a mystery but it can't be too
[54:39] mysterious because God says in Isaiah 35
[54:42] that the way of holiness is so simple
[54:44] that a fool won't air in there so it's
[54:48] got to be so plain to us the mystery of
[54:50] God's will for our life that that only a
[54:52] fool couldn't miss it so it's got to be
[54:55] laying right before us I believe it's
[54:56] laying right before us and the Word of
[54:58] God don't you I believe God's will for
[55:01] your life and your gifts and your call
[55:03] and God's purpose for your life it's
[55:05] laying right here in the Word of God and
[55:07] we just got to turn our eyes upon the
[55:09] Word of God amen and listen for the
[55:11] voice of Jesus listen to him vindicate
[55:14] truth to our lives praise God now that's
[55:18] the one I want to start with there was
[55:20] with that quote and I want to move on
[55:22] here to this quote because God is the
[55:27] god of variety not everybody of course
[55:30] has the same calling and I've mentioned
[55:32] this quote numerous times before but I
[55:34] haven't read it in this series because
[55:36] I've been saving it for imagine of times
[55:39] such as this things that are to be 1965
[55:43] one of his last sermons I believe that
[55:45] God is a God of variety the world proves
[55:48] that he's got big mountains and little
[55:49] mountains he's got planes he's got
[55:51] deserts he's got different things
[55:53] because he made it that way he wanted it
[55:56] and he made this season summer winter
[55:58] spring autumn he made the season that
[56:00] shows he's a god of riding he made you
[56:03] in a variety some men are real bluster
[56:06] so that means they're real open with
[56:07] their words right some men and women
[56:11] they'll just mmm
[56:12] they'll just tell you right away and
[56:13] that's okay they can be a Holy Ghost
[56:14] filled Saint like people they'll just
[56:17] they'll tell you exactly what they mean
[56:19] and some are real dogmatic and that
[56:22] means their routine and and their way is
[56:25] they think their ways the right way we
[56:26] got a lot of those in the message don't
[56:28] we that can be a good thing it's a good
[56:30] thing if you're dogmatic about the Holy
[56:32] Ghost now it's a good thing if you're
[56:35] blusterous for Jesus amen the trouble is
[56:38] when we get a wrong spirit on us right
[56:40] some are row dogmatic that means they're
[56:43] dogmatic means you believe what your
[56:47] your convictions and your real strong
[56:48] about them and others are fine and
[56:51] others are so kind they're just so nice
[56:56] they're not like blusterous and dogmatic
[56:58] like other people there's just such kind
[57:00] people and you just find all different
[57:04] kinds of people and in his kingdom right
[57:07] God's got a variety of personalities in
[57:10] his kingdom
[57:12] so that
[57:13] gives us courage like we don't have to
[57:15] all preach like brother branham like the
[57:17] same style now we all have to preach the
[57:19] same revelation but we don't have to
[57:21] preach all the same style where his
[57:25] blusterous or dogmatic and murder man
[57:27] even says it in the seals he said he
[57:29] said brother nevels not like me but he
[57:31] said brother Neville he said it's real
[57:32] kind he says he said but I can kind of
[57:36] rebuke the people a little bit and he
[57:38] said shucks him like a piece of corn but
[57:42] I said I can do that he kind of laughed
[57:43] him brother Neville kind of laughs over
[57:45] there and says amen he said cuz because
[57:48] God can get the same message across just
[57:50] in a different way because God is a God
[57:53] of variety but we all got to be the same
[57:56] word the same revelation but we could
[57:59] have a different way in which to express
[58:02] it some express it real kind some
[58:04] express it a little more Stern and
[58:06] dogmatic like I remember brother Kevin
[58:09] uh you remember brother Kevin he said no
[58:12] when he served first started going to
[58:13] Perry greens church he said that he said
[58:16] they were the the Deacons were real
[58:17] Stern and dogmatic over there he said he
[58:20] walked in there popping chewing gum
[58:21] listen brother Perry green preach and he
[58:24] said those deacons came up and tapped
[58:25] him on the shoulder and said you spit it
[58:27] out and I don't know if they laid their
[58:28] hand out like that but maybe they had a
[58:30] tissue and I said my I said I don't
[58:32] think I'd ever do that to somebody I
[58:34] don't think I ever have either I've been
[58:36] a pastor of 13 years because I'm just
[58:40] more kind you know kind with some a real
[58:44] dogmatic some a real routine and we're a
[58:48] real star right
[58:49] our sisters laugh because they went to
[58:51] brother Peregrine's church but you know
[58:56] but there's different quotes on that
[58:58] like brother Branham will talk about
[58:59] being real Stern like with correction
[59:01] sometimes they'll say if people don't
[59:02] repent get him out from under the blood
[59:04] and then other quotes will say be he
[59:06] said let your prayer win him back to the
[59:08] Lord and don't put him out from under
[59:09] the blood so yeah so what it means you
[59:12] have to follow the leadership of the
[59:13] Lord in every situation and you have to
[59:19] use the timing of the Lord for different
[59:21] things but see God's got a variety of
[59:23] Christians praise God now here's the one
[59:26] I want to get to this is
[59:27] point of he's talking about look at st.
[59:29] Peter judge him by Andrew not having
[59:32] done a study on Andrew but brother he
[59:34] must have because he said Andrew is that
[59:36] prayer warrior just stayed on his knees
[59:38] all the time and the Apostle Peter was
[59:42] one of those fire brands that preached
[59:43] and so forth and Paul was more scholarly
[59:48] like he says more like the prophet or
[59:51] something and he set back and then
[59:52] brother man goes on to a different
[59:53] thought I just want to pull this one out
[59:55] here that brother Ram noticed the
[59:57] differences in the believers
[59:59] Paul was more scholarly Peter was more
[1:00:02] fisherman burly firebrand I'll never
[1:00:06] leave you Lord but then he did that was
[1:00:07] before the Holy Ghost but Paul wasn't
[1:00:10] really like that Paul was more scholarly
[1:00:12] and knew the scripture now Paul had to
[1:00:15] be scholarly Paul couldn't be out on a
[1:00:17] fishing boat because Paul had to write
[1:00:19] the New Testament amen so God plays Paul
[1:00:23] in the schools because his calling in
[1:00:25] life matched what he had to do for the
[1:00:29] Lord and so in Peter Peters calling in
[1:00:32] life he had the keys brother he had the
[1:00:34] keys he had to forcefully go up to
[1:00:36] Satan's Kingdom and he had to apply the
[1:00:38] kingdom of God and open doors of
[1:00:40] deliverance and open doors of the Holy
[1:00:42] Ghost he had to have strong faith to
[1:00:44] hold those keys and set the captives
[1:00:46] free amen he had to be he had to be
[1:00:50] built that way he had to know it was
[1:00:52] like a fishing for fish praise God
[1:00:54] because he was gonna call he was gonna
[1:00:56] haul in three thousand on the day of
[1:00:58] Pentecost amen
[1:00:59] I didn't know your praise God he had to
[1:01:00] know what it was like to be patient and
[1:01:02] wait for the fish to come but Paul I
[1:01:05] didn't always like to write the Word of
[1:01:06] God and to memorize the scripture now I
[1:01:10] shared this at Albion last month when I
[1:01:13] preached over there but I mean I've
[1:01:15] shared it with you too
[1:01:16] but that's you know the reason I look at
[1:01:18] my life my life I had to go to college
[1:01:20] my other brothers have preached they
[1:01:23] didn't go to college you know Simon camp
[1:01:24] but I had to go to college I to learn
[1:01:26] how to cite things and how to research
[1:01:28] things and I had to learn how to write
[1:01:30] papers and why did I have to go through
[1:01:33] that and when I heard a message most
[1:01:36] people that were my age they quit
[1:01:38] college why did I stay in college
[1:01:41] well I stayed in college because my
[1:01:43] ministry was gonna have to use a lot of
[1:01:46] those skills I would learn in college
[1:01:48] and it realized it so later on in life
[1:01:50] when people like brother Diggs and
[1:01:52] brother Brooks would tell me you need to
[1:01:53] write a book you need to write a book
[1:01:55] you need to do this you need to do that
[1:01:56] you need to share that with people and
[1:01:58] so I didn't know that right away but
[1:02:01] when I was in college we would take a
[1:02:03] class I think I shared it with you it
[1:02:04] was called a nonfiction class where they
[1:02:05] just teach you books that are our true
[1:02:08] fact books and the woman that the
[1:02:10] professor standing there and holds up a
[1:02:13] book and it says what Americans wore
[1:02:15] from 1770 to the present and she shares
[1:02:20] the book and said this is a book about
[1:02:22] how women used to wear slung skirts but
[1:02:24] now they wear pants and she hand the
[1:02:26] book to me like well I am I in this
[1:02:30] class I know I was in that class because
[1:02:32] I was supposed to receive that the truth
[1:02:35] of that and show how America has
[1:02:37] backslidden from her godly foundations
[1:02:39] and then share with the world amen and
[1:02:41] all those people on YouTube that are
[1:02:44] hungry and thirsty for God amen that's
[1:02:47] why I was in that class so see I was I
[1:02:50] can always relate to Paul I'm not
[1:02:51] putting myself on the same level Paul
[1:02:53] I'm the lowest of God's servants I'm the
[1:02:55] least of God's servants but I am a
[1:02:57] servant of God amen I am a Christian I
[1:02:59] do believe I have the Holy Ghost but I'm
[1:03:01] saying that I had to go through school
[1:03:03] in order to receive the facts about a
[1:03:06] Christian history to build even to build
[1:03:09] upon even what I knew brother Branham
[1:03:11] said and to find the actual references
[1:03:14] in it praise God
[1:03:15] my wife and I when we first came the
[1:03:16] message and Simon and Scott Overmeyer
[1:03:19] and I we loved going to the library
[1:03:20] before sister Karen I never want to go
[1:03:22] the library but after the message I
[1:03:24] loved going the library praise God
[1:03:25] because I could look at all the
[1:03:27] religious encyclopedias to say oh look
[1:03:29] what it says right here
[1:03:30] the original apostles baptized in the
[1:03:32] Lord Jesus Christ and the Catholic
[1:03:34] Church change it and then now going the
[1:03:37] library was exciting now it's not so
[1:03:38] much anymore because I don't do that
[1:03:40] anymore but I know my kids they'll go to
[1:03:42] the library just because they love
[1:03:43] reading but see that was the real power
[1:03:47] of Christianity to me that it changed my
[1:03:49] desire I never desire to study it and I
[1:03:53] never really enjoyed that
[1:03:55] really like college you know until I
[1:03:56] became a Christian and that once became
[1:03:58] a Christian I saw the purpose of it my
[1:04:00] God sent me here to find all these
[1:04:03] truths about history and then God sent
[1:04:06] me here to Shepherd a flock amen my
[1:04:09] purpose in life was to be more scholarly
[1:04:11] like and I know if I'd run from that
[1:04:15] then I'd be sinning how many believe
[1:04:16] that if I run from what God has shown me
[1:04:19] if I've run what God placed in my hand
[1:04:22] got literally place glory
[1:04:24] he literally braced that history book in
[1:04:26] my hand and brother man said use
[1:04:28] whatever in your hand
[1:04:30] praise God I would be it'd be a sinful
[1:04:35] thing for me to run from the calling of
[1:04:37] God upon my life and I can't try to
[1:04:40] impersonate other people I can't try to
[1:04:42] be like other be is what God made me to
[1:04:45] be praise God
[1:04:46] so I want to use myself as an example
[1:04:48] because it's a very easy example and it
[1:04:51] relates to this quote as you can see but
[1:04:55] see each of you you can do the same
[1:04:56] thing we can all look at our lives and
[1:04:59] see where God has brought us in order to
[1:05:02] know why we're here in the present and
[1:05:04] what we're to do right now because the
[1:05:06] sad part is most people believe the
[1:05:08] message they can see the truth but they
[1:05:10] never go deep enough to know what God
[1:05:12] called them to do they think message
[1:05:15] just being a message believers just
[1:05:17] believe in the truth and then come into
[1:05:19] church and and they're not doing
[1:05:20] anything else the rest of the days we're
[1:05:22] supposed to come to church but then the
[1:05:23] rest of the days we should be doing
[1:05:25] God's purpose for our lives amen our
[1:05:28] ministry extends outside of these four
[1:05:31] walls although there is a ministry as
[1:05:33] ice ended with laughs yes SWE's quote
[1:05:37] let me go with that again I'm gonna pull
[1:05:38] it up because I don't think many people
[1:05:40] have heard it before you you have a
[1:05:43] great ministry within these four walls
[1:05:45] but outside of these four walls you have
[1:05:48] another part of your ministry see you
[1:05:51] all of you are supposed to use your
[1:05:53] gifts to help me to meet everybody's
[1:05:55] gifts today that's what that's what
[1:05:58] brother Branham said the pre-service
[1:06:00] prayer before service whether it's in
[1:06:02] your home or the church the pre-service
[1:06:04] your ministry before the service is to
[1:06:07] help me so look at this
[1:06:08] it's reciprocal right brother bang
[1:06:10] everybody helps one me and then when I'm
[1:06:14] up here one helps everybody glory that's
[1:06:19] that's God's plan right for shepherds
[1:06:23] and flocks and so it is with the
[1:06:25] Shepherd and flocks right all the sheep
[1:06:28] give the Shepherd wool milk meat I'll
[1:06:32] give him all these things and then he
[1:06:34] turned around and he provides protection
[1:06:36] and comfort for all the Sheep see but
[1:06:40] madam said the Saints and their gift
[1:06:42] shall have their place first to bring
[1:06:44] and come together so see your ministry
[1:06:47] your your purpose within these four
[1:06:49] walls actually happens before mine yours
[1:06:53] is first
[1:06:54] I'm not even first your first Amen I'm
[1:06:58] second praise God you're first your
[1:07:02] ministry and your gifts and your prayers
[1:07:04] is first that's the first ministry mind
[1:07:06] second he says first which brings have I
[1:07:11] said before the sphere of the Lord so
[1:07:13] who brings the spirit Lord hear your
[1:07:15] gifts if you come to church and don't
[1:07:18] feel the spirit Lord we got to ask
[1:07:19] ourselves did we bring the spirit of
[1:07:21] Lord did we bring it that's a good
[1:07:24] question because brother and says you
[1:07:26] bring this through the Lord and I
[1:07:28] preached it many times but it's an it's
[1:07:30] an exodus where God told Aaron tell the
[1:07:33] people to bring the beaten oil to the
[1:07:36] tabernacle so the ministers can minister
[1:07:39] with the oil and produce light in the
[1:07:41] holy place amen glory in other words we
[1:07:44] can't have Church unless the people
[1:07:46] bring the anointing oil amen bori see
[1:07:51] that the ministry the people is first
[1:07:54] and then the priests did afterwards who
[1:07:59] brings the sphere Lord first in the
[1:08:01] church the people your gifts and it
[1:08:07] makes it much easier for the Holy Spirit
[1:08:09] to work through him then when a great
[1:08:12] spiritual meaning has just preceded his
[1:08:14] teaching and then the Holy Spirit gets
[1:08:17] into the word and teaches the word has
[1:08:20] that's already has just been manifested
[1:08:22] by
[1:08:22] the gifts now this is where we're going
[1:08:26] are we there yet
[1:08:27] I don't think so but this is where we
[1:08:29] should be going I know this for sure the
[1:08:31] bride of Jesus Christ is going that way
[1:08:33] and if you're a part of that bride then
[1:08:36] you will line up with this word when God
[1:08:38] starts doing it in his time and season
[1:08:40] but see we don't want to put it off and
[1:08:43] say well it must be for another day
[1:08:44] we've got to act upon it now we at least
[1:08:47] ought to try to act upon it now
[1:08:48] praise God so see that affects then
[1:08:52] you're next at your attitude towards the
[1:08:53] next service because then you realize my
[1:08:56] ministry is the first one and that helps
[1:08:59] the past or have his ministry after me
[1:09:02] my ministry is not even first it's you
[1:09:04] your ministry's first and now we're
[1:09:10] getting into purpose right we're seeing
[1:09:11] oh that that's my purpose at church my
[1:09:14] man I'm actually the first one to
[1:09:15] minister Church not me not the song
[1:09:18] leader not really amen
[1:09:19] the first ministry is all the gifts of
[1:09:22] the saints now I just I would just
[1:09:25] summarize it with prayer because no gift
[1:09:28] is really going to operate unless you've
[1:09:29] repented and being humble and you're
[1:09:32] praying and seeking god to be anointed
[1:09:36] so I just want to go back to that one
[1:09:42] okay so that was my whole desire was to
[1:09:47] share some of these quotes and to get
[1:09:48] the people to see you're different you
[1:09:50] you you may have a different calling or
[1:09:52] ministry than somebody else but the but
[1:09:55] the fact is we got to be faithful with
[1:09:57] that calling and we got to see that we
[1:09:59] have an important part each one of you
[1:10:01] each of your prayers are so important
[1:10:03] for the success of our church praise God
[1:10:07] each one of your prayers each one of
[1:10:09] your gifts it's important for the body
[1:10:11] of Christ your gifts first bring the
[1:10:15] Spirit of God and then the Spirit of God
[1:10:18] that's here can anoint me to help you
[1:10:20] and we just keep helping each other back
[1:10:22] and forth we just all coexist in love
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:25] we just keep feeding one another right
[1:10:27] we keep eating and helping one another
[1:10:29] that's a real church body amen that's a
[1:10:32] real shepherd and flock
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:36] glory I thank the Lord for his word
[1:10:38] don't you now listen you were born to do
[1:10:42] something you were born to do something
[1:10:45] and I've said this before but when I was
[1:10:48] down in 2009 I think I preached in North
[1:10:51] Carolina the first time when Tim humans
[1:10:52] had me to come down there I was sitting
[1:10:55] in the back I preached a saronite Sunday
[1:10:56] morning saronite youth meeting and I was
[1:11:00] there in the study as his office I still
[1:11:01] remember I was just you know going over
[1:11:03] quotes and typing and copying and
[1:11:06] pasting and the song specials were so
[1:11:08] powerful the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:10] was so powerful out there I had to stop
[1:11:13] what I was doing and I just bowed my
[1:11:14] head
[1:11:14] and I was weeping and crying just
[1:11:16] thanking God for the opportunity to
[1:11:18] preach his word and I said this little
[1:11:21] prayer I still remember I said dear Lord
[1:11:23] it is the greatest privilege of my life
[1:11:25] to preach your word if I could do
[1:11:27] anything in the world it would be
[1:11:29] preacher word to an anointed people Amen
[1:11:32] I know yeah but even like Jeremiah even
[1:11:34] if I got to preach to people sometimes
[1:11:35] that got hard faces and don't want to
[1:11:38] hear I'll still do that amen because I
[1:11:40] know it's in the plan of God amen I
[1:11:42] don't know sometimes you know sometimes
[1:11:45] the seed falls by the wayside sometimes
[1:11:47] it falls on thorny sometimes it falls on
[1:11:49] good ground but the seed still needs
[1:11:51] pray amen the seeds still need scattered
[1:11:54] and we'll keep scattering that seed
[1:11:56] until we see an increase amen glory
[1:12:00] that's where I said I remember praying
[1:12:02] and I said God I was born to do this
[1:12:04] thank you for letting me do this
[1:12:06] it is the greatest privilege of my life
[1:12:07] to preach your gospel amen
[1:12:10] that's how I was born to do I was born
[1:12:12] to preach I didn't really think about it
[1:12:15] but I was born to do it now I want to
[1:12:18] read this quote about sister she Karen
[1:12:19] brother man talks about your burden so
[1:12:23] at the end of this quote he said your
[1:12:25] burden seems to be your cross you must
[1:12:28] take up and follow Christ with so I'm
[1:12:30] gonna compare your gift your gift and
[1:12:33] ministry is like a cross it's hard it's
[1:12:36] heavy it's not easy
[1:12:38] praise God it's not uh doesn't always
[1:12:42] feel good preaching doesn't always feel
[1:12:44] good but it's a
[1:12:48] earning it's a labor is something you
[1:12:51] have to do in order to please God
[1:12:53] because Jesus said if you don't take
[1:12:54] your cross you are not a disciple in
[1:12:58] other words a learner I remember I read
[1:13:00] the quote last Sunday from works is
[1:13:01] faith Express if you're not learning
[1:13:03] more about your gifts but man said
[1:13:05] something's wrong
[1:13:06] see it's because you've thrown it you
[1:13:08] thrown your cross down and said I know I
[1:13:10] don't want that burden I don't want that
[1:13:11] responsibility shame on us if we say
[1:13:13] that that's the best thing that ever
[1:13:16] happened to us because it teaches us to
[1:13:18] die daily amen it teaches us to take up
[1:13:22] the cross and follow Christ it teaches
[1:13:24] to go slower in life and not so hard
[1:13:27] right it teaches to take our time and
[1:13:29] pray and make sure we're walking in the
[1:13:32] right steps praise God you know in high
[1:13:37] school we would train for the football
[1:13:40] games you know we do we would take a 45
[1:13:42] pound plate like this but amen
[1:13:44] and we'd run a 400-meter with it and it
[1:13:51] got you strong it wore you out but it
[1:13:53] got too strong I'll tell you this when I
[1:13:57] didn't have that weight on me and I ran
[1:14:00] a 400 meter I ran a 50/50 second flat in
[1:14:03] the 400 meter I was pretty fast because
[1:14:05] I set the school record but when I
[1:14:07] picked up that 45 I was really slow I'm
[1:14:12] comparing that to taking up your cross
[1:14:15] I was really fast I could felt like I
[1:14:17] did a lot without the 45 pound but with
[1:14:20] the 45 pound I need to focus and keep my
[1:14:22] arms up I'd look at every step and make
[1:14:25] sure I had enough endurance and to focus
[1:14:27] on how I was running it was a more
[1:14:30] disciplined run praise God that's how it
[1:14:32] is when you and I when we get a real
[1:14:34] weight and a real burden to do something
[1:14:36] for Christ it's going to make us focus
[1:14:38] more it's going to make us be more
[1:14:40] careful about this things we do we won't
[1:14:43] make decisions on a whim we'll make
[1:14:45] decisions through prayer praise God we
[1:14:49] don't just decide where I'll go here
[1:14:50] I'll go there I'll buy this I'll buy
[1:14:52] that I'll get married here I'll get
[1:14:55] married there you won't make just
[1:14:56] whimsical decisions like that you pray
[1:14:58] and say god is this the willit for your
[1:15:00] is this your will for my
[1:15:02] life you run the race with perseverance
[1:15:04] yes you do but you've got a burden you
[1:15:06] gotta cross and you make sure every step
[1:15:09] you take is his step so see God gave a
[1:15:15] burden to you it's not going to be easy
[1:15:18] this week I preached let's see I
[1:15:20] preached twice that Sunday Tuesday
[1:15:24] morning a Bible Club Wednesday at church
[1:15:26] Thursday Bible Club and out twice today
[1:15:29] yeah twice a so you have seven times in
[1:15:32] seven days glory I like that because God
[1:15:36] give me grace my voice hasn't worn out
[1:15:37] yet and it's a burden is it easy no it's
[1:15:42] a burden but it's I just feel compelled
[1:15:45] to do it
[1:15:46] I don't know when the last time I'll get
[1:15:47] a chance to share someone the Word of
[1:15:49] God so I want to make sure I give them a
[1:15:51] chance to hear the word of God if they
[1:15:53] need prayer I'll pray for them if they
[1:15:55] need a Bible I'll give it to him well we
[1:15:58] must be willing to give people what they
[1:16:00] need we must have a burden to do more
[1:16:03] than what we think we can do so he gives
[1:16:07] you a burden and that's what this quote
[1:16:09] says about sister shekharan November
[1:16:11] they were the ones that the the people
[1:16:15] around sister Karen when she was dying
[1:16:17] now this is actually on the tape I don't
[1:16:19] have it today to show you but all the
[1:16:21] people she got gravely sick all these
[1:16:23] denominational people prophesied and
[1:16:25] said she's gonna live and brother Graham
[1:16:26] said thus saith the Lord she's gonna die
[1:16:28] and she died so people say they don't
[1:16:35] have like there's no there's no like
[1:16:38] people that leave the message say
[1:16:39] there's no proof that he's a prophet no
[1:16:40] there is proof there's proof you've
[1:16:43] gotta look you just gotta look now look
[1:16:46] what he says in identification he says
[1:16:47] but this if you can just see your own
[1:16:49] self today in the light if your spirit
[1:16:52] that was in you lived in a character
[1:16:54] back there now look where you are today
[1:16:56] and you'll see where you'd have been
[1:16:57] back there where would you abandon that
[1:16:59] time would you have tooken sides with
[1:17:01] the organization that Nathan wanted to
[1:17:03] organize or would your present character
[1:17:05] separated you from that and stay with
[1:17:07] the word see when it seemed all was
[1:17:10] against it so brother has taken us back
[1:17:11] to the days of Noah where would you have
[1:17:13] been in that group would you
[1:17:15] been right behind the prophet believing
[1:17:17] every word he said Amen or would you
[1:17:20] have been the ones that say oh we all
[1:17:22] can be preachers we don't need the
[1:17:24] Prophet and we don't need air in the
[1:17:25] priests we're all holy we all can do
[1:17:27] that that's what he's saying which group
[1:17:30] would you be in I rented the Court on
[1:17:31] Wednesday but man said Cora today Cora
[1:17:34] people say that the fivefold ministries
[1:17:37] failed and that's wrong the true 5min
[1:17:41] phone ministry has not failed the false
[1:17:43] five ministry has failed amen
[1:17:45] let me make sure my wife shared that
[1:17:47] with me I thought I better share that
[1:17:49] again to remind everybody the true five
[1:17:51] fivefold ministry cannot fail because
[1:17:53] they're more than conquerors in Christ
[1:17:55] Jesus amen
[1:17:56] but the false five ministry are
[1:17:58] pretenders or they're impersonators and
[1:18:01] they won't preach the Holy Ghost
[1:18:02] they won't preach even sanctification
[1:18:03] right they won't even preach doctrine
[1:18:06] because they don't want to live the Word
[1:18:07] of God but a real child of God who who's
[1:18:09] born again filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:11] will preach the word and live all the
[1:18:13] word that's what we see today they don't
[1:18:17] preach the word because they don't want
[1:18:18] to live the word they don't want to die
[1:18:21] raise god they don't want to take up a
[1:18:24] cross they just want an easy life Moses
[1:18:29] had been thoroughly it I've indicated
[1:18:30] that he had the message of the Lord God
[1:18:33] approved it in every manner just exactly
[1:18:35] what he had said come to pass told
[1:18:37] Israel plumb back and deuteronomy way
[1:18:38] back in there whatever these signs would
[1:18:40] be you must follow that and listen to it
[1:18:42] and hear what the word promised he was
[1:18:43] made manifest and still Dathan a smart
[1:18:46] leader down in the egypt rose up and
[1:18:48] said there you'll try to make yourself
[1:18:50] the only one that's got anything that
[1:18:52] wasn't Moses's thought he was only doing
[1:18:56] what God had ordained him to do all of
[1:18:58] them didn't have to be Moses's the
[1:19:03] people only had to follow what he said
[1:19:07] everyone didn't have to create and do
[1:19:10] miracles and things that's what the
[1:19:12] trouble with people today Superman shows
[1:19:17] that we Korah Dathan they wanted to be
[1:19:20] like Moses they want to take Moses his
[1:19:22] place they were trying to press into his
[1:19:24] position right but God didn't call them
[1:19:27] for that
[1:19:28] if
[1:19:28] call him for that he would have made
[1:19:30] himself known to them praise God we
[1:19:33] didn't call him for that and so now
[1:19:36] program takes this thought and he goes
[1:19:38] to sister she carrion who was a
[1:19:40] Pentecostal believer a lady asked me
[1:19:42] coming down the road the other day
[1:19:44] it's Florence a carrion brother Dimas
[1:19:46] sister and sister Williams and them sat
[1:19:49] in the car
[1:19:49] she said brother branham i fast and fast
[1:19:51] and fast and I still I can't cast out
[1:19:55] Devils remember brother Branham
[1:19:57] previously said whatever gift you have
[1:19:59] it's something you can do so see all
[1:20:03] these quotes line up about gifts if
[1:20:05] you've got a gift you can do it but you
[1:20:08] can only do it when the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:09] there because you can't produce a dream
[1:20:12] like my dad said dream me a dream
[1:20:15] well I can't ok performing a miracle I
[1:20:18] can't give me a word of wisdom I can't I
[1:20:22] gotta wait on the Lord but see sister
[1:20:25] Karen was fat because that was the
[1:20:26] anointing fast and pray fasten frame
[1:20:28] remember there was anointing of grown
[1:20:29] ends day was faster brave bastard pray
[1:20:31] pastor pray he said but they never got
[1:20:33] to the message a man they never got to
[1:20:35] the Word of God they start denominations
[1:20:38] and Trinities and women preachers and
[1:20:40] tongues as evidence they never got to
[1:20:42] the word but we've got to the worry man
[1:20:44] and now we need to fast and pray to find
[1:20:47] our position and our calling and make
[1:20:49] sure we're born again and draw close to
[1:20:51] God amen brother brand my fast and
[1:20:59] faster fast still I can't cast out
[1:21:00] Devils I said you wasn't born to do such
[1:21:08] now God gave him some prophetic
[1:21:10] knowledge right some prophetic word your
[1:21:13] duty is fast now notice if you catch
[1:21:18] that right notice that's what she was
[1:21:20] doing that's what she could do right but
[1:21:23] man said if God calls you to do
[1:21:25] something do it well she could she could
[1:21:26] fast she could give up meals just fast
[1:21:28] and pray fast and pray didn't bother her
[1:21:31] he said your duties not to actually cast
[1:21:34] out the Devils God wanted to use
[1:21:36] somebody else to cast out the Devils why
[1:21:40] to give them a purpose
[1:21:41] amen glory but your purpose was just the
[1:21:46] fast fast and pray see God don't ask you
[1:21:51] like that brother had to learn that
[1:21:53] lesson you can't do everything in life
[1:21:55] my if I if I let it my to-do list will
[1:21:58] grow to like 300 things I could I just
[1:22:00] can never get to it now I've got to
[1:22:02] remind myself after I break down and
[1:22:04] about crying I just can't do everything
[1:22:05] I just can't I can't do it all cuz well
[1:22:10] RAM used to tell the people he said rain
[1:22:11] or shine you just call me and I'll be
[1:22:13] there and he found out later it almost
[1:22:15] killed him and then he had to say I
[1:22:19] can't do it all so he didn't say that
[1:22:24] after a while after years and years of
[1:22:26] and then that's why the people would
[1:22:27] camp out on his porch and then that that
[1:22:29] yet he pray for them and the people
[1:22:31] would be healed and blessed but then his
[1:22:33] wife suffered his children suffered he
[1:22:35] suffered because he thought he could do
[1:22:38] more than what he's actually could do
[1:22:41] right and keep a balance and you
[1:22:45] remember that's what happened in the
[1:22:46] Welsh survivor how many member of the
[1:22:47] Welsh revival Evan Roberts what a man of
[1:22:49] God I've read his I've read his journal
[1:22:51] entries what a man of God he was the one
[1:22:53] that was pregnant he's saying send the
[1:22:55] Holy Ghost to Welsh for Christ's sake
[1:22:57] and then God sent the Holy Ghost
[1:22:59] oh I love that prayer amen that's glory
[1:23:01] that's not was pretty when you guys got
[1:23:02] the Holy Ghost I was saying send the
[1:23:05] Holy Ghost to Akron for Christ's sake
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:07] glory and but he burned himself so much
[1:23:13] out brother William that he died like
[1:23:15] five years after the revival it was 1904
[1:23:19] he died I think in 1909 or 1912 shortly
[1:23:21] after the revival because he just burned
[1:23:23] himself out to prayer and fasting and
[1:23:26] preaching and traveling till he wore out
[1:23:27] his own body and died prematurely
[1:23:31] now did will God receive that of course
[1:23:34] at least he's not rushing out he's
[1:23:37] wearing out but at least he's not
[1:23:38] rusting out doing nothing for the
[1:23:40] kingdom of God
[1:23:40] remember I said last Sunday by Bram's
[1:23:42] quote the worst thing you can do is
[1:23:44] neglect to try that's the worst thing
[1:23:47] you can do is to say you have one of
[1:23:49] these gifts up here
[1:23:51] the worst thing you do is say you have
[1:23:53] one of them and then don't try to do it
[1:23:55] and the way to try is to draw near to
[1:23:59] God in prayer and fast and seek God and
[1:24:02] watch God anoint you and then God will
[1:24:04] do something through you to show you
[1:24:06] that you can do something through his
[1:24:08] leadership but the worst thing to do is
[1:24:11] not even try to neglect that portion of
[1:24:15] God that divine gift that God placed in
[1:24:17] your life that's the worst thing you
[1:24:18] could do is not try but at least Evan
[1:24:21] Roberts wore out least he wore off that
[1:24:24] gift Amen hallelujah praise God that's
[1:24:28] what I was trying to have to do wearing
[1:24:29] myself out a couple years ago and I lost
[1:24:31] my voice I said God I'll never do that
[1:24:32] again
[1:24:33] see because I was at church I was
[1:24:35] screaming his shout in every service I
[1:24:37] was song lead in every service screaming
[1:24:38] the top of my voice then I go to
[1:24:40] Taekwondo and scream and shout and I go
[1:24:42] to school and yell a Bible club and
[1:24:43] scream that was too much screaming my
[1:24:47] zeal is eating up my wisdom I was
[1:24:50] getting some ice cream I was eyes from
[1:24:52] screaming a lot wasn't very sweet but I
[1:24:54] was getting a lot of ice cream inside to
[1:24:58] realize I got to be more careful but
[1:25:00] madam talked about your voice has two
[1:25:01] levels right he's at a first gear in a
[1:25:03] second gear
[1:25:04] now that quote makes sense to me now I
[1:25:05] know I gotta save the loud voice and I
[1:25:09] gotta have a backup voice too
[1:25:11] I can't wear myself out and I could and
[1:25:14] I could go prematurely off the scene I
[1:25:16] could wear myself out like that like I
[1:25:18] learned to balance it I gotta learn to
[1:25:20] use more wisdom now let me go back you
[1:25:25] wasn't born to cast out Devils so
[1:25:27] teachers don't feel bad if you can't do
[1:25:28] it don't feel bad but the thing to do is
[1:25:31] not sit there and do nothing
[1:25:33] the thing to do is seek God and say God
[1:25:36] show me what I am to do praise God
[1:25:39] because we got to do something in this
[1:25:41] life and coming to church is great it's
[1:25:43] part of the Word of God but there's a
[1:25:45] gift to do while you're in the church
[1:25:47] there's a gift to do before the service
[1:25:48] there's a gift to do outside the service
[1:25:50] with your family and friends and your
[1:25:52] co-workers and other message believers
[1:25:54] there's there's ministries to do out
[1:25:56] there if we'll just open our eyes and
[1:25:58] turn our eyes upon Jesus Oh glory amen
[1:26:03] praise God like I said with Mike Dirnt
[1:26:07] on Wednesday if you didn't watch it Mike
[1:26:09] durdle never heard the message until
[1:26:11] somebody walked up and game one of those
[1:26:13] cars from Jeffersonville with the pillar
[1:26:15] of fire and said did you know God sent a
[1:26:17] prophet he got so interested he wrote a
[1:26:19] letter to voice of God they sent him a
[1:26:20] video edit he asked for where's his
[1:26:23] church and he drove the next 10 or 15
[1:26:25] years of his life
[1:26:26] from Mansfield although not man's to
[1:26:28] abuts near Mansfield all the way to Lima
[1:26:30] every Sunday and he left homosexuality
[1:26:32] God delivered that man from the sin of
[1:26:35] this day praise God
[1:26:39] he left Sodom rejoicing saying I found
[1:26:43] God did send a prophet and I'm doing
[1:26:45] what the Prophet said which is the Word
[1:26:47] of God amen
[1:26:49] so I wonder I just wish I would have
[1:26:51] asked him who handed you that card
[1:26:52] because I would like to know I like to
[1:26:54] go shake that person's hand and see
[1:26:56] Church if all your ministry is like I
[1:26:59] told what anyone not if all your
[1:27:01] ministry is is passing out my books do
[1:27:04] it now she has more than that but I just
[1:27:08] told her one time it'd be a good thing
[1:27:09] to do it passed out the books or pass
[1:27:13] out brother Rams books I got all these
[1:27:14] books out there see the thing to do and
[1:27:16] whether I said if you don't know your
[1:27:17] gift if you don't know if you're
[1:27:18] supposed to testify he said go try it
[1:27:20] sometime wake up in the morning say I'm
[1:27:23] gonna go testify at work today and I'm
[1:27:26] gonna try it see if it works like I told
[1:27:31] you on Wednesday before I went to get my
[1:27:32] teeth cleaned thank God I got him
[1:27:33] cleaned - mercy I prayed and I bowed my
[1:27:38] head in my room and I said Lord I have
[1:27:40] taken three books three of my books to
[1:27:42] the dentist in the name of Jesus help me
[1:27:44] to pass him out I I just put him in my
[1:27:46] bag I left him there we walked in I just
[1:27:48] I kept all my mind though I just prayed
[1:27:50] I went to get my teeth clean and I'll
[1:27:52] get them teen and all of a sudden she
[1:27:57] breaks out and she said man things are
[1:27:58] getting so awful today I wish they were
[1:28:01] like they were in the 50s she said I
[1:28:03] wish I knew when did all this sin start
[1:28:06] in our nation and I have a whole chapter
[1:28:08] dedicated to that and I go decade by
[1:28:13] decade brother amen
[1:28:14] in fact I started the 1800s then I go
[1:28:16] 1910 1920 all the way up to today
[1:28:20] and so there are new and as soon as I as
[1:28:23] soon as I heard that I smile but I
[1:28:25] couldn't smile - because I would it
[1:28:26] would have cut my mouth but I knew I
[1:28:29] said there it is there's the answer my
[1:28:31] prayer because I said God opened up a
[1:28:33] door and I and I told her about it and
[1:28:35] she literally went like this she's like
[1:28:37] a 70 year old woman she's like really I
[1:28:39] was happy to pay for your book I said
[1:28:41] you're not paying for my book so I went
[1:28:43] God I said here you go she said thank
[1:28:44] you and then a woman at the reception
[1:28:46] said can I have one and I gave out all
[1:28:48] three maybe that's what God called me to
[1:28:52] do is to be someone who can pass out and
[1:28:54] witness but see what I have to do and
[1:28:58] always find this church what do I need
[1:28:59] to do more pray about it
[1:29:01] say God just guide me today see we get
[1:29:05] so busy and in Turkey ought to we ought
[1:29:06] to be busy with our work right we ought
[1:29:07] to glorify God on the job we ought to
[1:29:09] glorify God in our homes but we got to
[1:29:11] pray about these things that God used me
[1:29:13] today like brother cams and I'll never
[1:29:14] forget - well I might forget it but he
[1:29:16] said look we ought to pray Lord put me
[1:29:18] in your path see I found out I found
[1:29:21] that on Wednesday Lord put me in your
[1:29:23] path open up a door so I can share with
[1:29:25] these people the Word of God the message
[1:29:27] of the hour and God heard my prayer
[1:29:30] something small like that but all's it
[1:29:33] took to deliver a man out of
[1:29:35] homosexuality was a car that said did
[1:29:37] you know God sent a prophet that's all
[1:29:40] it took and I think the person who gave
[1:29:43] it to him sister who I think that person
[1:29:45] found the purpose for their life right
[1:29:47] there they were born for that glory they
[1:29:51] were born to deliver God's Word to a
[1:29:54] homosexual so you could come out of that
[1:29:56] and realize I'm not a homosexual I'm a
[1:29:58] son of God hey there like some of us
[1:30:01] were smokers and liars and thieves amen
[1:30:04] and pornography and adulterers and
[1:30:07] fornicators but we realized when we
[1:30:09] heard the Word of God I'm not a child of
[1:30:12] the devil I'm a child of the king amen
[1:30:15] that person's purpose in life was to
[1:30:18] make sure he or she whoever was blessed
[1:30:20] their hearts passed out that card to a
[1:30:22] homosexual dying I mean he was in his
[1:30:25] 60s close to death
[1:30:32] he had health problems for a lot of his
[1:30:34] adult life see our purpose in life may
[1:30:38] be so simple what were we born to do oh
[1:30:41] god help us to do that
[1:30:44] he said you wasn't born to do such your
[1:30:47] duty is fast so like her maybe she
[1:30:52] sister she can't really love food but
[1:30:54] God said well you got to die to that
[1:30:56] now you gotta fast it'll probably your
[1:31:01] gift will probably be opposite of your
[1:31:03] nature probably like I didn't like
[1:31:06] studying brother bang I didn't like I
[1:31:07] didn't like reading books I'd rather
[1:31:09] watch movies but then God calls me gonna
[1:31:12] be a preacher I gotta study books all
[1:31:14] the time I gotta read sermons I gotta
[1:31:17] read this and write that and I didn't I
[1:31:19] didn't really like that it wasn't
[1:31:20] I just whizzed through high school I
[1:31:22] mean it was I didn't really study that
[1:31:24] much I was the guy in study hall the day
[1:31:27] before the test that's I was rewriting
[1:31:28] out the notes and I would sometimes I
[1:31:32] cheat I'd do the cheat sheets and put
[1:31:34] them between my knees
[1:31:34] it's a shame on me to say that but that
[1:31:36] was the truth but I mean a lot of it I
[1:31:38] knew cuz I could just soak it in just by
[1:31:41] listening you're watching visual learner
[1:31:43] but then the very thing God called me to
[1:31:46] do is opposite to what I want to do I
[1:31:47] didn't want to study the books now God
[1:31:50] called me to study books okay well maybe
[1:31:56] sisters you care and love food but God
[1:31:57] called her you've got to give that up
[1:32:00] it's probably something similar like
[1:32:02] that if we had time we teach these
[1:32:06] things in long meetings how that one
[1:32:07] person is burdened see there it is
[1:32:09] Church burden that's why I never want to
[1:32:11] beg anybody to do anything in this
[1:32:13] church I'm never gonna beg anybody now
[1:32:14] preach it again and again and again I'm
[1:32:16] preaching again all over the time but
[1:32:18] I'm not gonna beg people to do it I'm
[1:32:20] gonna bring it up so it'll deal with
[1:32:22] their conscience but if you are when God
[1:32:25] has called you to do something nobody's
[1:32:27] got to beg you to do it because your
[1:32:29] burden from heaven to do it amen because
[1:32:32] you're carrying an invisible cross to do
[1:32:35] it praise God
[1:32:36] brother bang is the same thing with bang
[1:32:38] Bang's had the burden of this church on
[1:32:40] his shoulders for last 13 years
[1:32:42] he's just carried it he's just carried
[1:32:45] it
[1:32:45] if I asked him to do something he does
[1:32:47] it why cuz he's got a burden for it he
[1:32:49] believes in it praise God same thing
[1:32:53] with me whether we got eight people in
[1:32:54] the church or nine people or four or
[1:32:56] three or 15 or whatever we got it
[1:32:58] doesn't matter I keep showing up service
[1:33:00] after service because I believe in it
[1:33:01] I've gotta burn for I know God's gonna
[1:33:03] have me answer for and I want to hear
[1:33:05] him say well done good and faithful
[1:33:06] servant the burden see each person is
[1:33:11] burdened like this for something over
[1:33:13] here I've got a burden to pass out
[1:33:16] tracts good do it do it do something
[1:33:18] praise God
[1:33:20] I've got a burden too fast do it do it
[1:33:22] do it
[1:33:23] whatever your burden is you got to find
[1:33:26] the bird and the heavenly burden now and
[1:33:29] you got to do that burden you got to
[1:33:33] carry that burden and you got a member
[1:33:35] that is it is a burden it's gonna be
[1:33:37] heavy sometimes it's not gonna be easy
[1:33:39] you think it was easy to go to for Paul
[1:33:43] to go up to Peter stick his finger on
[1:33:45] his nose and said you're the one that's
[1:33:46] that you're the one to blame
[1:33:47] think that was easy when that man walked
[1:33:49] on water and knew Jesus Christ and live
[1:33:51] with him three and half years think that
[1:33:52] was easy no but it was just calling you
[1:33:54] life a scholar walking up a scholar you
[1:33:57] know from a school walking up to a big
[1:33:59] burly fisherman oh you come to correct
[1:34:02] me no he wasn't like that
[1:34:04] you understand picture a big burly he's
[1:34:07] got big muscles you know through his
[1:34:08] robe you can see his big muscles he
[1:34:10] wasn't showing him off like people do
[1:34:11] today but he had to be burdened to
[1:34:14] correct with the word and so Paul did
[1:34:19] you don't know you don't and not for you
[1:34:22] to know it's him doing it so it's God
[1:34:25] showing you your burden like brother van
[1:34:29] at Sunday school why does van do that
[1:34:30] why does van go to this church and teach
[1:34:32] Sunday School week after week that
[1:34:34] sometimes one two or three kids why does
[1:34:37] he do that it's a burden did you make up
[1:34:41] that burden brother bang or to God give
[1:34:42] you that burden God gave it because he
[1:34:45] knows the children need the Word of God
[1:34:47] and if nobody else would do it I'll do
[1:34:51] it well God knew there'd be nobody else
[1:34:52] hey that's why God sent bang to do that
[1:34:55] amen
[1:34:55] that's why God sent me to preach here
[1:34:57] because he knew there'd be nobody else
[1:34:59] to do it it's him doing it in you
[1:35:06] why does a men do the songs he doesn't
[1:35:09] get praise right have any of you paid
[1:35:13] him the last few months for doing his
[1:35:14] song service anybody signed him up for
[1:35:19] music lessons down to Accra music down
[1:35:21] there anybody signed him up and pay for
[1:35:23] his lessons lately no he's got a burden
[1:35:26] to do it he's got a burden it's not
[1:35:29] something that we're telling him to do
[1:35:32] it's a god-given burden why does mankind
[1:35:34] Lydia come play the piano like that I
[1:35:36] don't pay them I know and I know this I
[1:35:41] know this for a fact I know people that
[1:35:42] would only plain in the musicians with
[1:35:45] the musicians and churches if they're
[1:35:46] paid I nope they've told me with their
[1:35:48] own lips so I'm not making it up I know
[1:35:49] what I'm talking about they'll only do
[1:35:51] it because they're paid and people that
[1:35:54] know this message see because it's not a
[1:35:58] burden the burdens about I need money
[1:36:00] doing wrong I mean if you love God God
[1:36:02] will provide your finances no doubt
[1:36:03] about that
[1:36:05] but the burden has to be a burden from
[1:36:08] God and not a burden from man or
[1:36:12] organization or pressure and that's how
[1:36:15] you know when it comes down in the
[1:36:15] pressure moments and the decision you
[1:36:17] make to either stay with the burden or
[1:36:19] leave it
[1:36:19] that shows what you're made of right
[1:36:20] there because Judas and the hours
[1:36:24] leading up towards the crucifixion it
[1:36:25] came pressure time he's got to make a
[1:36:27] decision is he gonna stay and go to
[1:36:29] Pentecost or is he gonna sell out and we
[1:36:31] saw what he did he sold out see God
[1:36:34] orchestrates all the events of
[1:36:36] everyone's life so they are forced to
[1:36:38] make a decision praise God and either
[1:36:41] stay with your burden either stay with
[1:36:42] God's calling and saying the perfect
[1:36:44] will of God or go off in the permissive
[1:36:46] will of God you can still be saved like
[1:36:47] Saul but you can be lost like Judas by
[1:36:50] going the permissive will of God see
[1:36:54] you're just submissive to your call
[1:36:57] that's the thing people don't listen
[1:36:59] enough in prayer if they're no hear
[1:37:00] God's call they're not there when the
[1:37:03] preachers going on they're not thinking
[1:37:05] it applies to them they'll think it
[1:37:06] applies to somebody else but if you
[1:37:10] don't have a burden if you don't have a
[1:37:11] ministry it's time to hear God's call
[1:37:13] for
[1:37:13] that cuz God is calling you the Bible
[1:37:16] said every man has a gift right the bow
[1:37:18] said a gift as he hath given to every
[1:37:20] man every man and woman has a gift of
[1:37:23] the Holy Spirit now may not operate
[1:37:26] right away-- it may be God's building
[1:37:28] you up to do something very important
[1:37:29] when a soul save us so strengthen
[1:37:31] somebody whatever it is but he's called
[1:37:34] you to do something and he said it will
[1:37:36] always line up with the scripture see if
[1:37:37] it's right or not can a woman fast
[1:37:41] Church can a woman fast and pray yeah
[1:37:43] can a woman cast out Devils yes I've
[1:37:45] seen that I told you that numerous times
[1:37:46] a woman can do anything except preach
[1:37:50] and lead men because that goes with song
[1:37:54] leaders and the right prayer before
[1:37:57] service and prayer during service you
[1:37:59] can't she's not to have the she's not to
[1:38:01] have the mic and leading the men right
[1:38:03] now we find this Moses that was
[1:38:08] criticized he was criticized by this
[1:38:10] group but God said to Moses separate
[1:38:13] yourself from him because I'm going to
[1:38:14] swallow him up in the earth he did now
[1:38:16] see you must know the hour that you're
[1:38:18] living and now judge your character with
[1:38:21] what they was so with this illustration
[1:38:25] just go back like we were saying with
[1:38:26] Moses which one are you are you in the
[1:38:28] group following brother branham that's
[1:38:30] the group I'm in I'm not trying to take
[1:38:33] them out and make myself a prophet I'm
[1:38:34] not trying to act like a prophet I'm not
[1:38:36] trying to prophesy or anything like that
[1:38:37] I'm just following Moses praise God I
[1:38:40] just call myself Joshua or Caleb is that
[1:38:43] okay I hope that's the group you put
[1:38:46] yourself and I hope you don't put
[1:38:47] yourself in the other groups the other
[1:38:49] Israelites either die in the wilderness
[1:38:50] or in the corn Nathan group amen don't
[1:38:53] put yourself in those groups my and you
[1:38:56] know what we looked at on last Sunday
[1:38:57] you know why they overcame or Wednesday
[1:38:59] night because they had another spirit in
[1:39:00] them
[1:39:01] how did Joshua and Caleb overcome
[1:39:03] because they had a Holy Spirit in them
[1:39:05] not a human just just a human will but
[1:39:08] they had the will of God they're the
[1:39:09] power and life of the Holy Spirit and so
[1:39:12] they could live a higher life they could
[1:39:15] follow Moses because they had the Spirit
[1:39:17] of God from Moses his ministry
[1:39:19] glory he said he was
[1:39:23] and God said to Moses separate yourself
[1:39:25] from him because I'm gonna swallow him
[1:39:26] up in the earth and he did now you see
[1:39:28] yeah you must judge yourself by the
[1:39:30] character what they was I've already
[1:39:32] read that so you got it twice okay now
[1:39:39] we saw with Jeremiah that you were
[1:39:41] ordained to do something remember the
[1:39:44] Bible said so Jeremiah was ordained to
[1:39:45] be a prophet nobody else could take his
[1:39:47] place he was the one God had called to
[1:39:49] be a prophet how do you know because God
[1:39:51] met him and told him how did Moses know
[1:39:53] God menon told him so church how are we
[1:39:56] gonna know god's gonna meet us and tell
[1:39:57] us I'm really expecting these these
[1:40:00] weekend meetings coming up here if you
[1:40:03] haven't heard it yet for me I'm
[1:40:04] expecting God to speak and tell you some
[1:40:06] of your callings in life this weekend I
[1:40:07] haven't shared that with Simon cam I
[1:40:09] talked with both him this week well
[1:40:11] Simon just by a voice mails but I'm
[1:40:14] expecting God to speak to some of us and
[1:40:16] show us more about our purpose and what
[1:40:18] we're ordained to do if you haven't
[1:40:20] heard it yet and I've God's by God's
[1:40:22] grace I wish you had if your hands but
[1:40:24] if you're not sure yet may God solidify
[1:40:26] it in these meetings coming up and I
[1:40:30] want to just bring out this thought hear
[1:40:32] about ordained you know the Bible said
[1:40:34] on the day of Pentecost that all those
[1:40:36] that were ordained to eternal life
[1:40:39] believed so anyone that God foreknew God
[1:40:45] for knew that there is 3000 would want
[1:40:48] to be saved so God made a way for them
[1:40:51] to be saved
[1:40:54] let me say like this church if each one
[1:40:58] of us by God's grace if each one of us
[1:41:01] want to walk in the full calling of God
[1:41:03] for our life then God has ordained a
[1:41:05] time and season for you to do it amen
[1:41:08] glory amen I I can't remember but a few
[1:41:13] last month I asked you to I had
[1:41:15] everybody's head bowed and I turned off
[1:41:17] the livestream I said who who knew who
[1:41:19] wants to know who who doesn't know that
[1:41:20] gifts for their life we had some hands
[1:41:21] go up and I said who who need to be more
[1:41:25] faithful to it I had some hands go up
[1:41:26] there so in our church we have both
[1:41:29] groups which is common I did the same
[1:41:30] thing in Albion asked all the same thing
[1:41:32] in fact in Albion more people said they
[1:41:36] knew their gifts
[1:41:37] and we're ashamed that they weren't
[1:41:38] investing more in them now where do we
[1:41:41] fall do we know our gifts first and if
[1:41:44] we know them are we investing them and
[1:41:46] learning more about them taking up our
[1:41:49] cross our ministry daily and following
[1:41:51] him or just kind of cruising along with
[1:41:54] the things of the world see we don't
[1:41:58] want to flow by the world's tides right
[1:42:00] we want to fly we want to flow by God's
[1:42:02] tides amen we don't want the world to
[1:42:04] kind of direct us we want to be directed
[1:42:06] by the holy spirit the holy win right we
[1:42:10] want to feel the wind of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:11] from place to place praise God not the
[1:42:13] winds of doctrine but the wind of the
[1:42:15] Holy Spirit that's how I was trying to
[1:42:16] get to amen
[1:42:19] see they were ordained now church I
[1:42:21] believe this if you're a child of God if
[1:42:24] you love God if you're born again then
[1:42:26] you are deigned to take your position in
[1:42:28] the body of Christ but you have to do it
[1:42:31] I can't do it for you nobody else can do
[1:42:34] it for you I can't put you in position
[1:42:36] only you can get in position your mom
[1:42:40] your dad grandma brother cousin pastor
[1:42:43] song leader nobody can put you in your
[1:42:45] position
[1:42:46] you've got to accept your position like
[1:42:49] Esther she had to accept her position
[1:42:51] she had to leave Mordecai right David he
[1:42:54] had to leave his father and he had to go
[1:42:56] minister in the in Saul's Court until he
[1:43:00] was King he had to make the decision you
[1:43:03] and I have them we have the
[1:43:04] responsibility of making the decision
[1:43:07] and that will fall in line with God's
[1:43:09] ordained time in place for us to come
[1:43:11] into position now I want to read this
[1:43:20] it's been a long time since I preached
[1:43:22] out of here but I want to just read one
[1:43:23] paragraph out of here it was such a
[1:43:24] blessing
[1:43:30] there we go studying books again I don't
[1:43:32] really like to study well you know I I
[1:43:35] tried to audio books I just don't
[1:43:36] remember audio books I got to read it I
[1:43:39] need a book that's hard cover her soft
[1:43:42] cover but hard paper that's how God made
[1:43:45] me I'm not going to get it on the you
[1:43:48] know why because I get distracted
[1:43:51] I'll check my email real quick but when
[1:43:54] I got that book there's nothing in that
[1:43:56] book but just a book that's why I told I
[1:44:00] even told the people I Bible coming so
[1:44:01] that's why I don't let people use their
[1:44:02] phones in church now I used to before I
[1:44:04] knew better but now I know now I know
[1:44:06] better because the phone pretty soon uh
[1:44:10] someone's gonna pop up or then the more
[1:44:13] the power is gonna go off you're gonna
[1:44:14] get a ring gonna get a buzzer
[1:44:15] there's too many distractions the Bible
[1:44:18] has no distractions amen it's all the
[1:44:21] word all the time hey man that's why
[1:44:24] y'all never allow it I don't think it's
[1:44:26] right they do in big churches that's
[1:44:27] fine let them do whatever they want let
[1:44:29] them do what they want little churches
[1:44:30] well I don't think it's us I don't think
[1:44:32] it's a wise thing to do now you might
[1:44:37] have seen me sometimes I test it out
[1:44:39] sometimes I use my pen on my iPad and
[1:44:41] try to take notes to see how much I can
[1:44:43] pay attention but then I got little kids
[1:44:45] you watch I love I love might remember
[1:44:47] they need me here they need me here like
[1:44:48] when I'm listening to a preacher preach
[1:44:50] so I haven't found that to be a very
[1:44:52] effective way to do it even for me
[1:44:54] because then I get tempted to go check
[1:44:56] my email so I've stopped doing that so
[1:45:00] you can test it out first to make sure
[1:45:01] because if I if I'm if I'm the call to
[1:45:04] lead the flock and if I can't handle it
[1:45:06] then I don't know I'm not sure if the
[1:45:07] other people can a know it either it
[1:45:09] just be wise not to do it that's just my
[1:45:12] opinion you know everybody can have
[1:45:13] their own opinion I'm not making a sound
[1:45:14] of law but just to me it's just wisdom
[1:45:16] like we don't want any district we have
[1:45:18] so we can check our phones or tablets
[1:45:21] all the rest of the week let's just give
[1:45:22] God some undivided attention Bray's God
[1:45:25] that's why we feel so far from God
[1:45:27] because the Bible says if you draw nigh
[1:45:29] for God
[1:45:30] He will draw nigh to you that's why I
[1:45:36] need a hard book I get it if I get a
[1:45:38] tablet I have my book on my tablet and I
[1:45:41] still can't read it because there's too
[1:45:43] many other things to do I can do this
[1:45:45] for school go do that but when I can
[1:45:46] just set that down and just hold the
[1:45:48] book I just and then it's just God now
[1:45:51] God can start ministering to me this
[1:45:57] chapter
[1:45:57] beautiful chapter it's it's called God's
[1:46:01] power in your weakness I'm just gonna
[1:46:03] read a paragraph cuz it was really
[1:46:04] beautiful bless my heart because it
[1:46:08] talks about how you and I are always
[1:46:10] becoming until we die
[1:46:11] we're always becoming what God called us
[1:46:14] to be until we die
[1:46:16] cuz that moment right before we die then
[1:46:18] we finally reached it right we finally
[1:46:20] reach we finally fulfilled God's will
[1:46:23] for our life
[1:46:24] think about that John the Baptist mine
[1:46:27] He fulfilled he didn't fulfill all of it
[1:46:29] until he was beheaded as a martyr right
[1:46:32] and then disciples mourn and and then of
[1:46:34] course if they were good disciples they
[1:46:36] would have followed they would have
[1:46:37] followed John's messages and go follow
[1:46:38] the Messiah they were good disciples now
[1:46:45] look at this I wanna read actually it's
[1:46:46] a couple paragraphs here most of all our
[1:46:49] weaknesses increase our capacity for
[1:46:52] sympathy and ministry in other words you
[1:46:56] can minister to someone else because you
[1:46:58] know your faults testing one two okay
[1:47:05] she's a son that's kidding I like that
[1:47:07] one time I heard a preacher do I like
[1:47:09] testing see we can minister to others
[1:47:13] because we see our faults and listen
[1:47:16] church you know what that motivates me a
[1:47:17] lot of times to keep going because I see
[1:47:19] my faults and I see other people falling
[1:47:21] way further than I fall because they
[1:47:23] don't know the message and that gives me
[1:47:25] Wendy a burden to serve more for God
[1:47:27] because I see we both fall short I'm
[1:47:30] fallible I need God's help it makes me
[1:47:32] sister Wendy to want to strut be a
[1:47:34] strong example of real Christianity
[1:47:37] because I see my faults but I see my
[1:47:40] friends that don't believe the message
[1:47:41] or maybe they do but they don't live
[1:47:42] right I see them fall to depths I think
[1:47:44] my in the world how in the world could
[1:47:45] they do that and it makes me gives me
[1:47:48] that zealous revenge we read on
[1:47:49] Wednesday makes one have zeal to do
[1:47:52] God's will praise God in other words if
[1:47:54] nobody else will stand with Moses out
[1:47:55] stand with Moses Amen who's on the
[1:47:58] Lord's side let them come stand with me
[1:48:00] that's what I like to say Amen who's on
[1:48:02] the side of Jesus Christ that really
[1:48:04] stays with the Word of God I want to say
[1:48:06] it on that side amen we are far more
[1:48:10] likely to be compassionate and
[1:48:11] considerate of the weaknesses of others
[1:48:14] God wants you to have a christ-like
[1:48:16] ministry on earth and that's my next
[1:48:19] series I'm gonna get to is the whole
[1:48:20] life of Jesus Christ on earth that means
[1:48:26] other people are going to find healing
[1:48:28] in your wounds your greatest life
[1:48:33] messages and your most effective
[1:48:35] ministry will come out of the deepest
[1:48:38] hurts that you've experienced I thought
[1:48:44] that was good the things you're most
[1:48:47] embarrassed about most ashamed of and
[1:48:50] most reluctant to share with others are
[1:48:52] the very tools God can use to most
[1:48:55] powerfully heal others and think about
[1:48:58] that brother branham why did I man tell
[1:48:59] the story when he lied to the IRS why do
[1:49:02] you tell the story about wanting to
[1:49:03] murder people and you know why does he
[1:49:06] tell us those because those encouraged
[1:49:08] us to know that he was a man he was on
[1:49:11] the same basis we are and if he overcame
[1:49:13] murder we can overcome what we battle if
[1:49:17] he ever caught if you overcome not
[1:49:20] having a backbone with his mother-in-law
[1:49:21] and the ministers in South Africa if he
[1:49:23] overcome compromise then we can overcome
[1:49:26] compromise but we are in the progress of
[1:49:29] becoming stronger amen
[1:49:32] we're in the progress of becoming what
[1:49:34] God wants us to do amen
[1:49:35] one day we'll reach it but we must not
[1:49:38] be discouraged and get hopeless and
[1:49:40] commit suicide like another team to this
[1:49:42] week in Copley so sad they just keep
[1:49:46] doing they become hopeless and they give
[1:49:47] up hope why because they're looking for
[1:49:49] other places than in Christ amen because
[1:49:52] Jesus Christ is our living hope okay man
[1:49:59] the great missionary Hudson Taylor said
[1:50:01] all of God's Giants were weak people see
[1:50:05] the only reason they were Giants was
[1:50:06] because God worked through them because
[1:50:09] every person that was a real true giant
[1:50:11] was nothing on their own it was God in
[1:50:13] them right just go read about Samson if
[1:50:20] you want to see a god one of God's
[1:50:22] Giants went down and got a process
[1:50:25] - right and then that night at midnight
[1:50:28] after he laid with the prostitute he got
[1:50:30] up and heard the Philistines brother
[1:50:31] bang he walked up and picked up the
[1:50:33] gates tons and tons of weight and walked
[1:50:36] him up a hill and set down and they all
[1:50:37] ran from him like little bees he just
[1:50:41] got done with the prostitute now who's
[1:50:44] the Giant there it's God see cuz he was
[1:50:48] still keeping his covenant so God
[1:50:49] honored his gift just like when Moses
[1:50:52] smote the rock he should have done it
[1:50:53] but God honored it because he was at the
[1:50:55] most of duty it was his gift but see
[1:51:02] Samson was becoming what he was going to
[1:51:03] be eventually member he was born to
[1:51:05] begin delivering Israel from the
[1:51:07] Philistines amen and so God worked out
[1:51:10] God worked even in his weaknesses to
[1:51:12] bring about Samson so he could
[1:51:14] accomplish God's calling for his life
[1:51:16] and he finally did he boy did he have to
[1:51:18] be humble didn't he he really had to be
[1:51:20] tore up and humbled and lose his
[1:51:22] eyesight and get ripped apart and feel
[1:51:24] like he was absolutely nothing you let
[1:51:25] around and made fun of and mocked but it
[1:51:27] finally brought into the place where he
[1:51:29] could die to his sinful flesh and
[1:51:31] desires and do the will of God Amen I
[1:51:33] wonder if that happen have to happen for
[1:51:34] some of us we might have to be
[1:51:36] embarrassed about to fall on our faces
[1:51:38] we might have to go through awful times
[1:51:39] because of our own mistakes but no
[1:51:41] matter what God will lead us and guide
[1:51:43] us into the path of God the footsteps he
[1:51:46] has for us to do and we will accomplish
[1:51:48] God's purpose for our lives but let's
[1:51:51] take warning that's what Paul said take
[1:51:52] warning take it from Israel take
[1:51:55] admonition from Israel that we don't
[1:51:57] complain that we don't lust that we
[1:51:59] don't go a horn that we don't commit
[1:52:01] idolatry let us learn from those
[1:52:03] examples and live a faithful life let's
[1:52:07] make the testimony more true to the word
[1:52:11] let's make our lives more like Joseph of
[1:52:13] the Old Testament by the bank where
[1:52:14] people have to struggle to find
[1:52:15] something wrong with our lives hey how
[1:52:18] did he a men only thing we can find is
[1:52:21] that he lied about shepherds he told his
[1:52:24] brothers to lie that's the only thing we
[1:52:26] can find that man's life because he
[1:52:28] lives so close to God may God help us to
[1:52:30] live like that and not be like Samson
[1:52:34] and give our heart to the things of the
[1:52:35] world and just give our gifts to God we
[1:52:38] want
[1:52:38] more than that we want to give our gifts
[1:52:40] and our heart to God I can't even get to
[1:52:44] this quote okay well praise the Lord God
[1:52:46] knows what he's doing the things you're
[1:52:48] most embarrassed about will be shared
[1:52:52] with others to be the very tools God
[1:52:53] uses to most powerfully heal others all
[1:53:00] God's Giants were weak people Moses his
[1:53:01] weakness was his temper it caused him to
[1:53:04] murder in gyptian strike the rock he
[1:53:05] wasn't supposed to or he was supposed to
[1:53:07] speak to and break the tablets of the
[1:53:09] Ten Commandments yet God transformed
[1:53:15] Moses into the humblest man on earth see
[1:53:20] Church we look at Moses he was the
[1:53:22] homeless man but he wasn't always
[1:53:25] he said come here let me fight you
[1:53:27] you're trying to take my Israel brothers
[1:53:28] smacked him and killed him in oh I
[1:53:30] better bury him in the sea I'm sorry not
[1:53:32] seen the sand of the sea God was looking
[1:53:35] at the end product praise God God's
[1:53:38] looking at your end product and he's
[1:53:41] gonna make sure you become what he wants
[1:53:43] you to be it's gonna take time it's
[1:53:46] gonna take some rough edges to be worn
[1:53:48] out praise God he's got to rake you over
[1:53:52] the coals sometimes just like he rakes
[1:53:54] me over the coals I mean you're not the
[1:53:56] only one I get raked over the goes to
[1:54:01] murder struck the rock so he misuse
[1:54:05] God's
[1:54:05] you know what bro Graham called him and
[1:54:07] how can overcome I'm gonna preach that
[1:54:09] later
[1:54:10] brother Ram called Moses a show-off and
[1:54:13] he said any real man of God won't be a
[1:54:15] show-off with his gift but I said Moses
[1:54:18] went in short officer you bunch of
[1:54:20] rebels I'll give you water from the rock
[1:54:22] and he smote the rock to show off what
[1:54:23] he could do with this gift so what did
[1:54:26] what did the meekest man on earth battle
[1:54:28] being a show-off praise God
[1:54:33] the meekest man on earth he started off
[1:54:37] by being a show-off
[1:54:38] he went to she could beat up their
[1:54:40] Egyptians I'll show you what I can do
[1:54:42] they says you want to complain watch
[1:54:44] what I can do but yet all those give God
[1:54:50] the glory don't they
[1:54:52] because we look at his life and see ma
[1:54:53] he failed let's learn from that and
[1:54:56] let's learn not to be a show-off in
[1:54:59] other words let's read the Bible and
[1:55:00] repent right now and say God forgive me
[1:55:01] if I've been a show-off forgive me if
[1:55:05] I've tried to make things happen forgive
[1:55:08] me for my temper how about that one
[1:55:10] forgive me now so don't embarrass myself
[1:55:13] later because I already have embarrassed
[1:55:16] myself but then God next time I see a
[1:55:19] temper help me to be a minister of
[1:55:20] strength for that person and pray for
[1:55:22] that person you know and I'll just say
[1:55:27] like this yesterday I was talking to
[1:55:28] somebody I was counseling them and they
[1:55:30] were saying how they brought rock and
[1:55:32] roll back in their life so I prayed
[1:55:34] about it you know I did afterwards I
[1:55:35] just sent that person all the songs I
[1:55:37] like lately I know what that's like I
[1:55:39] know what listen to rock and roll rappin
[1:55:41] country so see I was trying to Minnis I
[1:55:44] know what that's like because I used to
[1:55:45] be addicted to that but I try to give
[1:55:47] him something to help him and minister I
[1:55:49] know what it's like so I try to set him
[1:55:51] songs that lift up the Lord songs that
[1:55:54] are upbeat and they're they're they're
[1:55:56] jubilee songs see cuz he was going after
[1:55:59] songs of anger but we I'm trying to give
[1:56:02] him songs of joy he said Gideon's
[1:56:09] weakness was his low self-esteem and
[1:56:12] deep insecurities the angel said you
[1:56:15] mighty man he's like where where's
[1:56:23] where's the mighty man at he's where he
[1:56:26] had a bad self-esteem who I'm at least
[1:56:28] in my father's house yet God chose him
[1:56:32] he had deep insecurities remember I've
[1:56:34] reached that years ago but each before
[1:56:36] God did anything and get in Gideon had
[1:56:39] to have a sign just like brother Ram did
[1:56:41] writes a saying so we can relate to that
[1:56:44] we have deep insecurities is it 1
[1:56:47] o'clock already
[1:56:48] oh god bless you it's been good such a
[1:56:52] good atmosphere here I haven't even
[1:56:53] noticed the time till now but God
[1:56:56] transformed him into a mighty man of
[1:56:58] Valor Abraham's weakness was fear not
[1:57:01] once but twice he claimed his wife was
[1:57:03] his sister to protect
[1:57:06] yet he's called the father of faith but
[1:57:10] he wasn't always Amen he was to become
[1:57:13] the father of faith amen
[1:57:15] after trial for trial after year after
[1:57:18] year after decade after sermon after
[1:57:20] sermon after sacrifice one after another
[1:57:23] finally he became the father of faith
[1:57:25] and I'll say this finally will become
[1:57:27] the Bride of Christ amen
[1:57:29] hallelujah it's gonna take a lot of hard
[1:57:33] sermons in-between here take a lot of
[1:57:35] hard weeks of Prayer a lot of hard weeks
[1:57:37] of digging down and read your Bible and
[1:57:39] confessing your sin might be embarrassed
[1:57:41] along the way but you're becoming the
[1:57:43] bride of Jesus Christ but God transform
[1:57:50] a bruh to Abraham into the father of
[1:57:52] those who have faith impulsive weak
[1:57:55] willed Peter he was very impulsive well
[1:57:57] I'll never deny you I'll die with you
[1:58:00] Jesus yet Peter became a rock oh my
[1:58:04] he was the least thing from a rock
[1:58:06] before the pet day of Pentecost the
[1:58:11] adulterer David became a man after my
[1:58:14] own heart I read that last week you know
[1:58:16] what Nathan said Nathan said because you
[1:58:19] have despised the word of the Lord the
[1:58:21] sword will never leave your house that
[1:58:24] means David when he should have been out
[1:58:25] in battle he was out there on the roof
[1:58:27] and he was thinking why does God's Word
[1:58:29] say I can't commit adultery I can't
[1:58:32] believe that I can't have this man's
[1:58:34] wife until he is our husband died he
[1:58:38] brought the sorry the Bible Nathan says
[1:58:40] you've despised the Word of God
[1:58:42] the man that used to write songs and
[1:58:45] sing out there with the sheep and the
[1:58:47] goats right he's to sing on the tree and
[1:58:50] make melodies and psalms but he got to
[1:58:52] the spot his life he neglected his
[1:58:54] prayer ministry to the time that's what
[1:58:56] I think it's a type of soldiers of the
[1:58:58] Lord prayer praying always with all
[1:59:00] prayer and supplication with the full
[1:59:01] armor of God when we neglect prayer we
[1:59:04] start compromising on God's Word so he
[1:59:07] got to this spot look at her oh my
[1:59:09] goodness she's so beautiful look at her
[1:59:11] she's undressing taking a bath on the
[1:59:13] top of the house how could God say I
[1:59:16] can't have it and then God says you've
[1:59:18] despised
[1:59:19] the word of the Lord and he said if you
[1:59:20] were to ask me in other words if you
[1:59:22] were to prayed amen
[1:59:23] but he wouldn't even pray about it he
[1:59:25] just did what his flesh wanted to do and
[1:59:27] that man became a man after God's own
[1:59:31] heart he wasn't always but he became a
[1:59:37] man after God's own heart John he was
[1:59:43] one of the arrogant sons of thunder he
[1:59:45] walked around with a man he thought I'm
[1:59:46] so much bearing these guys look at all
[1:59:47] the miracles we've done we were sent out
[1:59:49] two by two all these Samaritans say they
[1:59:52] won't receive your word Jesus shall I
[1:59:54] send down fire from heaven like he had
[1:59:55] any power to do it like you've got any
[1:59:58] power to strike anybody dead right like
[2:00:01] you like we have any power to smite
[2:00:02] someone blind like we have any power
[2:00:04] like we're the judge of the whole
[2:00:06] universe we're not but God took an
[2:00:08] arrogant man like John and made him the
[2:00:10] apostle of love oh thank you Jesus amen
[2:00:15] he so hated those guys for not receiving
[2:00:17] his preaching see cuz it was all about
[2:00:19] him my gift in my ministry Jimmy just
[2:00:23] bring down fire from heaven but later he
[2:00:25] became pray for those loved those he
[2:00:28] said little children you know the
[2:00:29] greatest commandment you've already been
[2:00:31] told he said love one another this is my
[2:00:35] commandment where's virtue this is my
[2:00:36] commandment that you love there she sits
[2:00:38] no she's nothing this is my commandment
[2:00:40] that you love one another that your joy
[2:00:43] might be full
[2:00:44] that's virtue song this is my
[2:00:46] commandment that you love one another
[2:00:49] I'm sorry to wake you up I didn't mean
[2:00:51] to do that
[2:00:51] I just thought of you you could go on on
[2:00:56] and on and on couldn't you these people
[2:00:58] were constantly becoming what God had
[2:01:00] called them their purpose for their life
[2:01:02] it wasn't at the beginning of their
[2:01:05] ministries that getting was valiant he
[2:01:07] wasn't valued at all but God saw God
[2:01:11] ordained him to be valiant so God made a
[2:01:14] way where he could be Amen hallelujah
[2:01:16] all right I'm gonna skip that all right
