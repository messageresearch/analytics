[1:56] and praise in jesus christ's name the
[1:57] church said
[1:59] amen god bless you as you mentioned
[2:00] praise the lord
[2:04] all right
[2:06] i just got a text though this is kind of
[2:08] like an announcement i got a question
[2:09] about the samuel browning uh there's a
[2:11] youth event on
[2:13] september 11th sunday evening
[2:16] i just took the kids to a youth event on
[2:17] was it friday night
[2:19] you drove three hours over to michigan
[2:20] and i gotta see brother brooks it's
[2:22] really nice this is a real great deal
[2:25] but then they have another one on
[2:26] november six they have two so
[2:29] our youth
[2:31] group here
[2:33] but it's all god's hands for god's
[2:34] protection
[2:39] maybe they'll let all of us come since
[2:41] we're such a small church maybe by
[2:42] samuel let us all come
[2:43] because we normally have sunday night
[2:45] services so
[2:46] we'll see how that works out so we're
[2:48] really i just want to preach about hours
[2:49] i really am because brother austin has
[2:51] has to work today
[2:52] um we rejoiced uh
[2:54] a couple weeks ago he got a full-time uh
[2:57] position there uh as supervisor so we
[2:59] rejoice in that
[3:01] such a great blessing there
[3:04] but then part of that is having to work
[3:05] sunday nights just like i told him you
[3:07] know he was concerned at first by total
[3:09] just like you know brother bang and amen
[3:11] they miss you every wednesday so they're
[3:12] here two out of three services and i
[3:15] said you can do the same i say you just
[3:16] gotta make sure like these brothers
[3:17] probably do make sure you listen to the
[3:19] service that you missed feed on that
[3:21] word you know and uh and you'll see your
[3:23] strength prevail by god's goodness just
[3:25] gotta and you know the the reality of it
[3:27] is though every day feed on the word
[3:29] praise god
[3:30] that's the real uh that's the real
[3:34] feeding uh habits of a child of god
[3:36] praise god just to stay in community
[3:37] that constant prayer concept fellowship
[3:39] with the lord
[3:40] uh but that's the way to do it by god's
[3:42] grace so i told brothers and i said just
[3:44] give it a three month trial you know go
[3:45] through my trial see how you see how it
[3:47] goes and
[3:48] see what the lord does by god's grace
[3:50] very thankful
[3:51] so i will try to preach an hour today my
[3:53] guys gonna say how do you have my uh my
[3:56] pledge okay not my promise but my plans
[3:59] okay if not he's got to get an uber but
[4:01] i'd rather take him up there by god's
[4:02] face
[4:03] so part three you know we look we looked
[4:05] at uh
[4:06] money topics you know and i got some
[4:08] good feedback on wednesday so i
[4:09] appreciate everybody sharing that
[4:10] feedback and
[4:11] i tried to be more personal to kind of
[4:13] share what's on my heart you know and
[4:15] things i've learned i try to share all
[4:16] my mistakes i've shared some victories
[4:18] but i also try to share some of my
[4:19] mistakes i think
[4:22] i feel like because of the way i was
[4:23] raised i was not taught how to handle
[4:26] money right
[4:28] my mom did paycheck to paycheck and
[4:30] sometimes she didn't have a paycheck
[4:32] except food stamps that was the only
[4:33] paycheck she had sometimes
[4:35] and so i felt you know in high school
[4:37] you didn't learn really nothing about
[4:38] money they really didn't teach you how
[4:40] to manage money
[4:41] uh i felt like once i got to college you
[4:43] know god poured out these blessings but
[4:44] then i wasted a lot of it and i'll share
[4:47] more about that later you know
[4:49] but i feel like i wasted a lot but god
[4:51] has helped me to try to
[4:53] be more diligent praise god so
[4:55] i'm thankful you know uh and today you
[4:57] know we're looking really at how god's
[4:59] plan for your life may include having
[5:01] less money or more money
[5:04] it's all about god's plan for your life
[5:05] praise god
[5:07] just like jesus said no man can add one
[5:09] cubit to his stature
[5:11] so if your physical size if your
[5:14] physical weight and your build or
[5:15] whatever more your hair color and
[5:18] your smile
[5:19] whatever if that was predetermined by
[5:21] god and you can't change that it's the
[5:23] same way naturally praise god same way
[5:25] with money same way with spiritual gifts
[5:27] right spiritual gifts you can't add one
[5:29] spiritual gift that you know that god
[5:31] didn't give you right
[5:33] you can't say lord make me a prophet
[5:34] make me a prophet make me speak in
[5:35] tongues or make me prophesy you ain't
[5:37] gonna do it
[5:39] the devil might have you impersonate it
[5:40] but it ain't gonna be real except the
[5:42] gifts that god placed in your life how
[5:43] many just want the gifts god placed in
[5:45] your life
[5:46] now i want all to praise god amen how
[5:48] they do i just don't want i just want
[5:49] all god's gifts to be manifested in my
[5:51] life and i know you do too by god's
[5:53] grace so let's take about uh
[5:55] an hour here lord willing and we'll try
[5:57] to look at this here by god's grace
[6:00] so our text here was a great word of
[6:03] wisdom
[6:05] wealth by vanity so there there's all
[6:07] kinds of get rich quick schemes out
[6:09] there right there always has been there
[6:10] will be i was listening to a preacher
[6:12] yesterday and he was going through all
[6:13] the list of all the uh get rich quick
[6:16] schemes down through the last hundred or
[6:18] 200 years and they these slickers they
[6:20] just see that they
[6:21] uh
[6:22] they're just really deceptive you know
[6:24] uh what they'll do is like recently uh
[6:26] like when the when the housing market
[6:28] crashed these guys would would get money
[6:30] from investors and say they're going to
[6:32] invest it right and then they would say
[6:34] i'm going to give you your yields you
[6:35] know next week so they would take all
[6:36] this money and they'd give them a little
[6:37] bit to make them think it was actually
[6:39] working
[6:40] right
[6:41] so they're so sly they're so
[6:43] slippery like snakes you know
[6:46] and then but when it come down to the
[6:48] big payout that's when they skip down
[6:50] you know there's so there's always these
[6:52] get rich quick schemes like i told you
[6:54] the one about uh send everybody on this
[6:56] list one dollar and you'll get a hundred
[6:58] or a thousand back or something like
[6:59] that
[7:00] it never works and the bible says don't
[7:02] try to do it through vanity
[7:05] try to uh increase your income by hard
[7:08] work that's what the bible says
[7:11] by labor so this is by steady labor
[7:14] okay so uh another translation i don't
[7:17] believe in other translations and as far
[7:19] as like uh
[7:20] i don't believe they're right but when
[7:21] you look at other translations they call
[7:23] it little by little so i don't know if
[7:24] they're looking at different hebrew
[7:25] texts or not but that actually still
[7:27] fits
[7:28] uh the bible says
[7:31] he that gathereth by labor shall
[7:32] increase so if you go back to the bible
[7:34] days they had to gather at harvest time
[7:36] that's right of course they had three
[7:38] different harvests right they had the
[7:39] early the barley harvest and they had
[7:40] the uh then the wheat harvest and they
[7:42] had the fruit harvest they had three
[7:43] harvests so as long as you were
[7:45] gathering which would have whichever
[7:46] field you were in if you were in fruits
[7:48] or if you were at all three as long as
[7:49] you were gathering every day a little at
[7:51] a time then it would come down to you
[7:53] know uh you come down to
[7:56] july august the harvest time and that's
[7:58] when you go to the house of god and you
[7:59] would give your tithes and give your
[8:01] offerings and
[8:02] remember church if you owned
[8:04] if you owned a field you couldn't
[8:06] harvest the corners
[8:08] you had to round off you couldn't get
[8:10] you couldn't harvest every single apple
[8:12] in your order
[8:14] in the church
[8:15] you had to leave some for the poor and
[8:18] the stranger
[8:20] you couldn't just take everything you
[8:22] know you couldn't harvest it all i got
[8:24] all i got every every olive off that
[8:27] olive tree no you're supposed to leave
[8:28] so far
[8:30] and god was testing you to see if you'd
[8:31] honor his word
[8:33] how did there you go
[8:35] just as uh i i love it god's uh god's
[8:37] idea uh
[8:39] hard work and and building wealth i just
[8:42] love it you know god just wants you to
[8:43] work hard every day to slowly increase
[8:45] it if you use wisdom
[8:47] and then remember the poor never forget
[8:50] the poor every harvest time
[8:51] uh remember the poor as well praise god
[8:53] take what you need make sure you live a
[8:55] leave a little bit for the the poor the
[8:58] afflicted
[8:59] uh so i'm just gonna briefly just review
[9:01] real real real real quick part one we
[9:02] looked at uh monies to be in god's way
[9:05] not through man's way through humility
[9:07] fear of the lord hard work and honest
[9:10] financial decisions yield good results
[9:12] and we found david said all money comes
[9:14] from god that's why this sermon is
[9:16] called stewardship over god's money
[9:18] amen because god god kind of like lends
[9:21] it to us right he kind of gives us a
[9:22] load right temporary loan and we got to
[9:24] be faithful with it um get rich quick
[9:27] seekers will lose their riches the bible
[9:28] says that's what we just read and evil
[9:30] hearts want quick riches he that hates
[9:32] this to be rich have an evil eye
[9:35] i was listening this guy yesterday uh
[9:37] he's a good preacher on money
[9:39] and he was saying every time one of
[9:40] these get-rich-quick schemes comes
[9:42] around he says you can just hear
[9:44] uh the pride in people's voices oh if
[9:47] you just do this man you're gonna be
[9:48] rich
[9:49] right you and he actually said you can
[9:50] actually look them in the eye and see
[9:52] like their deception
[9:54] they're so uh possessed with this idea
[9:56] of getting rich
[9:57] you can hear it in their voice and you
[9:59] can see in their eye and that is
[10:00] interesting the bible said he that hates
[10:02] us to be rich have the evil eye
[10:04] like they just have a look about them
[10:05] like
[10:06] you know
[10:08] they're gonna they're quickly gonna get
[10:09] rich by this certain scheme nobody knows
[10:11] about this
[10:13] the bible says no you just gather every
[10:15] day
[10:16] you work hard every single day if you're
[10:18] faithful then god will god will bless
[10:20] you now wednesday we looked at the
[10:22] beginning how contentment is a great
[10:24] spiritual level to gain godliness when
[10:27] contentment is a great game
[10:29] the bible says uh a faithful man shall
[10:32] bound with blessing so see faithful hard
[10:34] work work every day little by little
[10:36] praise god build it up little by little
[10:38] like you know we're seeing our kids now
[10:40] starting to work and
[10:41] and uh i don't make them pay rent you
[10:43] know of course not
[10:45] but
[10:46] it's it's nice for me to see their bank
[10:48] bank accounts rise slowly you know
[10:51] and don't spend money save as much as
[10:52] you can you don't save his money you
[10:54] only gotta only buy when you really got
[10:56] to you know i know but no one ever told
[10:58] me that
[10:59] i wish somebody would have told me that
[11:00] you know
[11:01] that's just different different things
[11:03] in life you know what i mean just gotta
[11:04] it's my battle to overcome you know i've
[11:05] got to overcome that you know we just
[11:07] got different things
[11:08] uh
[11:09] but then paul says if riches do come
[11:12] snare snares and temptations will follow
[11:15] so we have to be very careful and we
[11:18] must not love money at all we just must
[11:20] see it as god's tool for us
[11:23] and then we saw solomon's prayer the
[11:24] middle class prayer don't make me so
[11:27] poor that i won't have to steal but
[11:29] don't make me so rich that i trust in my
[11:30] money
[11:31] make me middle of the road
[11:33] now let's look at this here now god has
[11:35] a plan and it may include less money
[11:37] that's hard to hear but you know we know
[11:39] that's true in the scripture well
[11:41] there's obviously some some real
[11:43] wonderful bible examples here god made
[11:45] job abraham solomon david rich man no
[11:48] doubt but then also god made others poor
[11:50] like the beggar lazarus
[11:54] paul
[11:55] even jesus himself right was a poor man
[11:58] and the widow woman with two mice
[12:01] so you have uh there's just four on both
[12:03] sides right
[12:04] uh
[12:05] you have them on both sides so you have
[12:07] to see well lord which one am i now i
[12:10] told you as far as the whole world we're
[12:12] on the richer side amen but even in this
[12:15] richer side we might be on the poor side
[12:17] right
[12:18] which is okay
[12:20] it's all according to god's plan you
[12:21] know
[12:22] but we don't know we don't know so the
[12:24] main way to know is just be faithful
[12:26] every day just be faithful little by
[12:28] little keep working hard uh laboring and
[12:31] then if god wants you to have a great
[12:34] increase well surely you know he's gonna
[12:35] bring it praise god because god's
[12:37] faithful hallelujah
[12:40] now let's look at a few scriptures here
[12:42] uh proverbs 22 verse 2. if you can pull
[12:44] it up there america i'm not ready for
[12:45] the slides yet i want to see how many
[12:47] scriptures i got i got quite a few on
[12:49] here
[12:52] i want to show again i want to review
[12:53] again brother branham's uh financial
[12:55] state just with some quotes with
[12:57] the inflation calculator to kind of have
[12:59] you see an idea about
[13:02] how he manages money
[13:06] proverbs 22 verse 2 the poor i'm sorry
[13:09] the rich and the poor meet together the
[13:11] lord is the maker of them all
[13:14] right just like david said uh all the
[13:16] wealth is in god's hands right so god
[13:18] will say i'll give you some i'll give
[13:19] you a little more i'll give you a little
[13:21] lesson i'll give you a little more you
[13:23] know god's the one who's giving out all
[13:25] these resources
[13:28] now next proverbs 10 verse 4
[13:33] he that becometh poor
[13:35] that deals with a slack hand
[13:40] but the hand of the diligent maketh rich
[13:45] so of course we know the balance you
[13:46] know uh
[13:51] you know uh we know the balance here of
[13:52] the scripture i want you to see though
[13:54] the word diligent here means a strict
[13:56] decision
[13:57] the hand of the strict make rich
[14:00] so with money you've got to be very
[14:02] strict with money
[14:04] in other words you got to know where all
[14:05] your money's going
[14:07] people are making lots of money now just
[14:09] making apps that tell you how many
[14:10] subscriptions you got and how you can
[14:12] break free from those
[14:13] like some people just they just going so
[14:15] far in debt it's really sad but they go
[14:17] so far they don't know how many
[14:18] subscriptions they have their money's
[14:19] just flying everywhere they don't even
[14:20] know where their money's going they
[14:21] forgot they're paying for that every
[14:22] year
[14:23] right they forget about these things and
[14:25] so people make apps to help you find out
[14:27] where all your money's going and they
[14:29] make money off that app it's a good app
[14:30] it's a good ad
[14:32] but the idea is
[14:34] we uh
[14:35] if we don't deal with money the right
[14:37] way if we're lazy with our money we'll
[14:38] become poor right that's what the bible
[14:40] says deal with the slack hand
[14:42] but the hand of the diligent so those
[14:44] who are strict with their money
[14:45] eventually become more wealthy
[14:47] right
[14:48] and so this verse god is rebuking lazy
[14:50] spenders and he's honoring the strict
[14:53] saviors that's right all right so we can
[14:55] see it playing through the scripture
[14:59] now here's what i want to brought out a
[15:01] while ago james 2 verse 5 hearken ye my
[15:03] beloved brethren hath not god chosen the
[15:06] poor of this world rich in faith and
[15:08] heirs of the kingdom which he had
[15:10] promised to them to love him so james
[15:12] wrote this 2000 years ago this is way
[15:14] before laodicea right but there was no
[15:15] doubt those rich people in those days
[15:17] but in other words the majority of
[15:19] christians are going to be poor people
[15:22] because the gospel attracts them it
[15:25] gives them spiritual goods they uh they
[15:27] know in many cases they won't have
[15:29] natural goods
[15:30] right because those are reserved just
[15:32] for uh the higher class in society think
[15:34] about china think about you know
[15:36] some of the leaders in china they have
[15:38] to go meet out in the woods just to have
[15:39] church
[15:41] you know uh all these nigeria i mean you
[15:44] name it different places
[15:45] where christians are persecuted they're
[15:47] the poor people
[15:49] they don't agree with the communist and
[15:51] government so they're not a part of that
[15:52] so they're poor they're living out and
[15:56] living off the land agriculture
[15:58] the majority of christians are poor now
[16:01] god over the world has made us rich so
[16:03] we we must be more disciplined we must
[16:06] be more faithful more strict with our
[16:07] money praise god
[16:09] that's right
[16:11] so god often chooses the poor because
[16:13] the rich have already chosen to love the
[16:16] world more than god
[16:18] right lovers of pleasures right lovers
[16:21] of selves more than more than lovers of
[16:23] god right
[16:24] that's one reason god can't choose many
[16:26] rich people to be saved and then jesus
[16:28] says those notable words it's easier for
[16:30] a camel to get through an eye of a
[16:32] needle than a rich man to get to heaven
[16:33] so church we really need god's grace in
[16:35] america amen amen that's why we really
[16:38] need god's mercy in america amen amen
[16:40] that's why we really got to remember the
[16:42] poor we really got to remember those who
[16:43] are hurting in america we've got to be
[16:45] generous people praise god
[16:48] now proverbs 23 verse 23 23 23.
[16:52] now this is very similar to what uh
[16:55] proverbs said earlier
[16:59] the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he
[17:01] bringeth low and up i think this is
[17:03] hannah's prayer if i'm not mistaken
[17:05] right after she'd gotten the news uh or
[17:08] actually had samuel if i'm not mistaken
[17:09] by god's grace
[17:11] the lord makes poor the lord makes rich
[17:13] he brings love and he lifts up praise
[17:16] god in other words god's the author of
[17:18] every season of our life
[17:20] i've had seasons where i've been poor
[17:22] i've had seasons where i've had a lot
[17:23] more extra praise god but god's the
[17:25] author of it all praise god
[17:27] amen
[17:29] and he brings me low sometimes but other
[17:31] times he raises me up amen
[17:34] oh thank god amen hallelujah
[17:36] every in every mountain every valley we
[17:38] find god's mercy we find the gracious
[17:40] one the tenor savior we find in whatever
[17:42] valley whatever uh whatever mountain
[17:44] we're all whatever victory whatever test
[17:46] we're going through we find jesus
[17:48] carrying us through amen
[17:51] wherever we are that's where we know
[17:52] jesus is praise god
[17:54] does he promise to never leave us or
[17:56] forsake us
[17:57] now i just want again to say because
[17:59] because most christians are poor isaiah
[18:02] 55 verse 1 is crucial it says ho
[18:05] everyone that thirsts come to the waters
[18:08] and he that hath no money come ye by and
[18:11] eat come ye by wine and milk without
[18:14] money in price
[18:16] see because most christians are poor
[18:18] this is why the gospel is attractive you
[18:20] can gain spiritual riches or spiritual
[18:23] food hallelujah or spiritual drink you
[18:26] can gain it just by coming to jesus amen
[18:29] amen hallelujah amen you can look past
[18:31] your your your physical circumstances
[18:34] and look at the spiritual
[18:36] and know that god has promised you
[18:38] spiritual drink spiritual food a home in
[18:41] heaven a mansion in heaven praise god
[18:43] amen
[18:44] i don't know you the poor can see this
[18:48] hallelujah he promised you wine and milk
[18:51] wine simulation and milk is the
[18:53] elementary truce that's right right
[18:55] because there's milk and meat christians
[18:57] hallelujah so it's beautiful these great
[19:00] promises now church don't just remind
[19:01] yourself
[19:03] jesus said in three verse 18 revelation
[19:05] 3 18 i counseling divide me
[19:08] go
[19:10] i believe investing in gold and silver
[19:12] but this is the best goal to invest in
[19:16] this is gold this is time tested faith
[19:18] amen amen hallelujah that's what gold is
[19:21] peter said to try your faith more
[19:23] precious than go
[19:25] so we should go to jesus and say lord i
[19:26] want to invest in some gold praise god
[19:29] in other words help my faith to be
[19:31] strong when i go through trials bring me
[19:33] through the trials so i can trust you
[19:34] the next time i go through a
[19:36] tribe me real faith that's why i'm
[19:38] thankful you never that's why i often
[19:40] say the number of years that i've been
[19:41] preaching or serving god because it
[19:43] encouraged me wow if i got through 16
[19:45] years of preaching i can get through 16
[19:46] more that's right
[19:48] because god has god has blessed my faith
[19:50] and he's taking me through the tests and
[19:52] trials that we all must go through amen
[19:54] amen it encourages me i don't encourage
[19:56] you praise god i've stood this long i
[19:58] can stand longer right now
[20:00] as long as god's grace stays with me
[20:02] it's grace that was with me it's grace
[20:04] that it brought me through and it's
[20:05] grace that will leave me home amen amen
[20:08] that's why i like to tally up the
[20:09] numbers that encourages me you know
[20:11] that's that works in the natural too you
[20:12] tally up your savings you're going to
[20:14] you're going to like saving pretty soon
[20:17] yeah i invested in a
[20:19] a 401k kind of thing it's actually a
[20:21] 403b but it's the same idea i haven't
[20:23] checked it for years i went back and
[20:25] checked i was like my thank god for a
[20:26] compound interest
[20:28] it's a blessed surprise i just kind of
[20:30] forgot about it
[20:32] uh it's investing and each service we're
[20:34] investing in the kingdom of god amen
[20:37] each time we pray each time we worship
[20:39] praise god we're investing we're saying
[20:40] lord i want to purchase uh your i'm
[20:43] going to purchase the truth amen i want
[20:45] to purchase some gold he said i want to
[20:48] buy some white raiment that i may be
[20:50] clothed in your righteousness amen amen
[20:53] not my righteousness but the holiness of
[20:55] jesus amen i exchanged my sin and my
[20:58] guilt i
[20:59] exchange those for your righteousness
[21:01] praise god
[21:02] wash me hallelujah and i know i'll be
[21:04] clean
[21:06] hallelujah
[21:09] so god so god has a continuum right of
[21:12] rich we're in the top one percent of the
[21:14] world we're over here if this is poverty
[21:16] over here like we would think you know
[21:18] living in the desert or living someplace
[21:20] awful
[21:21] or living in a famine
[21:23] we're over here on the one percent the
[21:25] rich side of all the world
[21:28] so church god has put us on this
[21:30] continuum on the rich side
[21:32] so that means he's called us for good
[21:34] works
[21:36] like broadband said i couldn't i didn't
[21:38] find the quote but i found other quotes
[21:39] i'll share with you little man said
[21:40] whatever you do for yourself doesn't
[21:42] have any eternal reward but whatever you
[21:44] do for others deals with eternal rewards
[21:47] praise god
[21:49] only what we do for others is what will
[21:51] count on that day praise god
[21:54] as far as rewards
[21:57] now abraham's on the wealthy side uh uh
[21:59] genesis 13 verse 2 and abraham was very
[22:02] rich in cali he wasn't just he wasn't
[22:04] middle class
[22:06] he was very rich in cattle in silver and
[22:08] in gold
[22:10] abraham was a wealthy man
[22:12] but look look at his love for god look
[22:14] at his love for god remember genesis 18
[22:16] he was what was he doing he was sitting
[22:18] outside his tent waiting for jehovah to
[22:20] come amen and visit him amen hallelujah
[22:23] you know no doubt his servants were out
[22:24] there working with the sheep and and all
[22:26] the cattle and probably
[22:28] probably protecting this gold and silver
[22:29] too they're probably out there but what
[22:31] was he doing he was i i got this time
[22:34] i'm gonna wait on the lord and then who
[22:35] comes three men come and he said my lord
[22:38] he didn't say my lords he said my lord
[22:40] amen he knew one of those was god
[22:44] two of them were angels one was god
[22:47] and then the bible said he bowed down
[22:48] and he said can i wash your feet and
[22:50] sarah go prepare the fatty calf you know
[22:52] go go prepare uh for god in other words
[22:55] he was waiting for that fellowship and
[22:56] when jesus come there when the lord the
[22:58] holy spirit comes he had communion with
[23:00] him that's what we do praise god we come
[23:02] to the house of god for communion with
[23:04] god amen amen
[23:06] but look at him very wealthy
[23:09] god saw abraham's love for truth
[23:12] and he know or he knew he would train
[23:15] faithfully his family and servants to
[23:17] obey the words of god
[23:19] put up genesis 18 19 would you
[23:23] so we look at abraham well he's a rich
[23:25] man what what do you spend his time
[23:26] doing he had all these servants he spent
[23:28] his time teaching them the word of god
[23:32] so what would you do if you were rich
[23:34] well here's what abraham did when he was
[23:35] rich the bible said he commands his
[23:38] children and his household after him
[23:40] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[23:42] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[23:44] may bring upon abram that which he has
[23:46] spoken of
[23:49] so if we ever get rich where we can
[23:50] retire
[23:51] and we have servants or
[23:53] today they call them personal assistants
[23:55] that's what they call today
[23:56] uh my personal assistants take care of
[23:58] that for me
[24:00] send them an email
[24:02] if you ever get a personal assistant and
[24:04] you're freed up because of all your
[24:05] wealth then you would spend your time
[24:08] training up your children and your
[24:09] household
[24:10] now the reality of this church we still
[24:11] gotta do it anyway
[24:13] right
[24:15] i still do that you still buy one time
[24:16] last night you know i still took all the
[24:18] questions of the kids good questions
[24:20] every morning you know except sunday we
[24:23] do bible time my wife does bible time i
[24:24] do bible time in the evening
[24:26] we still got to do that but if you were
[24:28] freed up and had all this money like
[24:30] rich man abraham then you spend all that
[24:32] extra time training your children to
[24:34] obey the word of god training your
[24:35] servants
[24:36] to obey the word of god amen
[24:39] everyone can ever see that by god's
[24:40] grace
[24:43] and that's why god blessed him so much
[24:46] remember his sermons were so brave
[24:47] church that they rescued the people and
[24:50] goods of sodom and gomorrah from four
[24:52] heathen kings in genesis 14. this is how
[24:55] much faith talk about mighty men there
[24:56] we go talk about mighty men and women
[24:58] praise god he was rich but he also had
[25:02] trained them up and they were able to
[25:03] overcome four kings
[25:06] so it was just god's anointing on them
[25:07] it was god's anointing to defeat four
[25:09] kings how can how can one man who's not
[25:11] even a king
[25:12] how can his 400 servants defeat four
[25:15] kings by the power of god
[25:17] god gave him favor
[25:19] hallelujah
[25:23] now uh i want to add this in here i want
[25:25] to add in the definition of wealth you
[25:26] know one time a
[25:28] a financial guru said wealth is how much
[25:31] money you have that you could live off
[25:33] in case you lost all your income it's
[25:35] kind of like on wednesday night we're
[25:36] talking about how many how many months
[25:37] of income would you have saved up right
[25:40] so some people define that as wealth
[25:43] okay now i believe there's wisdom in
[25:45] that from proverbs 21 verse 20. i'm
[25:47] going to read that again
[25:49] since i'm there 21 20.
[25:52] there is oh yeah there's treasure to be
[25:54] desired and oil in the dwelling of the
[25:57] wise but a foolish man spent it up can
[25:59] you put that one up there proverbs 21
[26:01] 20. this is why i said if the holy
[26:03] spirit was here he'd say save your money
[26:06] save your resources don't spend it on
[26:07] luxurious things
[26:09] right
[26:10] because the bible says the wise why is
[26:13] it foolish just like why isn't virgins
[26:14] right
[26:16] the wise have treasure and their
[26:18] treasure is oil
[26:20] right so they have plenty of oil saved
[26:22] up for the winter now another verse
[26:24] we'll get to later was the ant right
[26:26] simon says let me show you somebody wise
[26:28] this little ant down here and boy we
[26:29] hate them when they get into our house
[26:31] don't we like how did they get in here
[26:33] and trap
[26:34] but the bible actually says the bible is
[26:37] honored look at that ant he's going out
[26:38] there to get what he needs and get ready
[26:40] for the winter time
[26:42] so the holy spirit says
[26:44] save up and foolish men spend up all
[26:47] their money
[26:49] so when the winner time comes pockets
[26:52] are empty there's a lot of lit in there
[26:54] today
[26:55] you know so that's why i said you know
[26:57] when we start out as and finances we
[26:59] might have paycheck to paycheck but as
[27:01] you're faithful and as the holy spirit
[27:03] is working our lives
[27:05] uh we have the ability as the the rich
[27:07] percent or the richer people in the
[27:09] world we have the ability to really
[27:11] increase our wealth that we can help
[27:13] other people
[27:15] and we should have it we shouldn't spend
[27:17] all of our money
[27:18] right we shouldn't do that unless we're
[27:20] at the very beginning point
[27:22] all right
[27:23] you can see that now now but jesus gave
[27:26] us the true definition of wealth in uh
[27:28] matthew 19 21 so malcolm
[27:31] matthew 19 21.
[27:33] proverbs gives us that one look there of
[27:35] course you can use that spiritually
[27:37] but jesus said uh jesus saith unto the
[27:39] rich young ruler if thou be perfect go
[27:41] and sell that thou hast and give to the
[27:42] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[27:44] heaven and come and follow
[27:46] me so the one time jesus says you know
[27:49] you're going to have treasure in heaven
[27:50] for this man was to sell all your riches
[27:53] give to the poor and come and follow me
[27:55] so here we see real treasure comes when
[27:58] you follow jesus christ amen hallelujah
[28:01] praise god amen
[28:02] follow jesus not all he was he was
[28:05] getting called to be a missionary that's
[28:07] why jesus said sell everything you have
[28:10] just like when elijah remember when
[28:11] elisha really sold out he killed the
[28:13] oxen he was he was yo he was a farmer he
[28:15] was he was
[28:16] he was burdened you know he was a
[28:18] agricultural man a farmer but when he
[28:20] decided to follow the message of the
[28:21] hour he slayed that ox and he fed his
[28:23] family and said see you later in other
[28:25] words he cut all ties amen amen he was
[28:28] so uh devoted he was so decided on
[28:31] cutting any ties i'm gonna go i'm gonna
[28:33] go where god sends me praise god amen
[28:37] so see the idea is to follow christ and
[28:40] make sure we remember the poor
[28:43] hallelujah
[28:45] so we got two on the wealthy side
[28:47] abraham was rich he was able to manage
[28:50] it now he still had a lying problem and
[28:52] the church said
[28:53] amen right
[28:54] a prophet with a line problem
[28:56] okay we're all human praise god
[29:00] solomon was the other one that he was
[29:02] extremely rich and prosperous but he
[29:04] fell because of his many wives the bible
[29:06] said his wives turned his heart away
[29:08] from serving god because look at that it
[29:10] wasn't even the money
[29:12] it was the women
[29:13] and those altars that he built in the
[29:15] buildings of
[29:16] uh whoredom and uh
[29:18] idolatry where they had idols and
[29:20] statues no doubt they did awful works
[29:22] and sinful acts that those houses uh
[29:24] they're like bravo houses many of them
[29:26] that's what you do with idols that's
[29:28] what they do they get you drugged up and
[29:29] then they uh let last shivers flow
[29:32] that's what they do in those houses
[29:33] that's true
[29:34] anybody knows that if you if you've seen
[29:36] if you study the idolatry you would know
[29:38] that
[29:39] so that's a good thing to study
[29:41] but see solomon without this and so so
[29:43] the conclusion is it's not a sin to be
[29:45] rich but riches will bring temptations
[29:48] that ensnare many in their sins
[29:51] so christians can be rich i think i got
[29:53] i got asked that question last week that
[29:54] was a good question
[29:56] yes they can and if not church then we
[29:58] better sell everything we have you know
[29:59] we better become beggars
[30:01] because we're the richest christians in
[30:02] the world probably
[30:04] america
[30:07] right but then see we got to go back to
[30:08] the scripture that's why we always go
[30:10] back to the scripture
[30:12] and rich christians must be uh rich in
[30:14] good works paul says in 1st timothy
[30:16] chapter 6. now on the poor side we find
[30:19] paul
[30:20] at the end of his life he asked timothy
[30:22] to bring his one cloak to him
[30:25] in prison when paul when he comes to see
[30:26] paul and this heavy coat in the greek is
[30:28] called a heavy coat for protection
[30:31] against stormy weather
[30:33] so he just needed like we said like this
[30:34] a poncho or like a park if we say parker
[30:36] him something like a parker right
[30:39] now church you and i can get on our
[30:40] phones wait a minute
[30:42] in four clicks i can have a parking here
[30:44] in two days with four please
[30:46] i gotta tuck amazon i gotta click this
[30:49] i'm gonna click that yeah click it two
[30:51] days it'll be here
[30:53] and paul let's look how rich we are
[30:55] that's that's the point i'm making look
[30:56] how rich we are paul although he was the
[30:58] messenger of the age and the prophet at
[31:00] the end of his life he's asking can you
[31:02] send me my one coat can you bring it
[31:04] hundreds of miles or however many miles
[31:06] can you make sure you don't forget my
[31:08] used coat he couldn't even afford a new
[31:10] one church
[31:12] no doubt there was coke shops in that
[31:14] city where he was in prison no doubt no
[31:17] doubt there was merchants who sold coats
[31:20] but he's like i can't even afford a coat
[31:21] make sure you bring my coke when you
[31:23] come
[31:24] at church each one of us we can walk
[31:26] right over to target right now and you
[31:28] can buy code if you want each one of us
[31:32] look at this
[31:33] and i believe he was the greatest
[31:34] christian there ever was that's just my
[31:36] humble opinion
[31:37] because all that he suffered for christ
[31:40] and so how where did god choose him on
[31:42] the continuum well he started off rich
[31:43] at the beginning but once he got to
[31:45] christ it all went downhill after that
[31:48] all went downhill
[31:53] he couldn't even afford a brand new coat
[31:55] now i'm going to preach later on paul's
[31:56] work life
[31:58] in most cases i don't have the
[31:59] scriptures right today in most cases
[32:01] paul would go into a city and what would
[32:02] he do he started making texts right away
[32:05] he was a tet maker now there's all kinds
[32:07] of different tents i was studying it
[32:08] there's leather tents uh there's cotton
[32:10] tanks there's all kinds there's all
[32:11] kinds of special designs if you want to
[32:13] make an intent for a rich person
[32:15] but it was all it was all handwork it
[32:17] just you work with your hands all day
[32:18] long and the bible said he'd make tents
[32:21] and then on saturday that was the day
[32:22] off he'd go preach in the churches
[32:26] he'd work six days a week making tents
[32:29] but on the sabbath day you go preach and
[32:31] try to persuade them now look imagine
[32:33] all the rich guys walking past them six
[32:35] days a week
[32:36] you make me a tent yeah yeah i'll get on
[32:39] i'm trying to get this one done by next
[32:40] week because i'm working on two other
[32:41] tents for these other groups
[32:43] and then on saturday he's the one
[32:45] standing up trying to persuade jesus
[32:47] christ is the son of god he's done
[32:48] miracles in my life and the bible said
[32:50] some believe something didn't just a
[32:52] humble man amen look at
[32:54] that none of his life i can't even
[32:57] afford a new coat
[33:16] you know the story of the rich man in
[33:17] lazarus god made one rich and one poor
[33:21] praise god
[33:24] that reminds us of jesus words he said
[33:26] uh matthew 19 23 malachi then jesus said
[33:29] his disciples very lasting to you that a
[33:31] rich man shall hardly enter into the
[33:33] kingdom of heaven
[33:35] church let's let's not put that on
[33:36] somebody else let's put that on
[33:38] ourselves that's right
[33:40] that's right in other words i'm gonna
[33:41] need god's supernatural power in this
[33:43] rich nation i am still gonna need god's
[33:45] supernatural power to be remember the
[33:47] poor so i can be saved hey man
[33:50] no no no no
[33:51] don't get me wrong we're already saying
[33:52] by grace through faith i'm just saying
[33:54] take wisdom take heed to a warning
[33:56] praise god that's right and it's a it's
[33:58] a red letter word praise or whether that
[34:00] is jesus christ warning us we're the age
[34:02] of riches so god help us to remember the
[34:04] poor praise god
[34:09] in later ones on these i'm going to show
[34:10] how
[34:11] if we're really diligent we can really
[34:13] do compound interest and within 20 30
[34:16] years you can do i mean you can really a
[34:18] cure a lot of wealth but you got to
[34:20] start saving now that's what i'm always
[34:22] saying like i'm going to start tomorrow
[34:23] i'm going to start next week or
[34:25] once i get this paid off
[34:27] so i'm going to share some more of my
[34:28] testimonies on there too by god's grace
[34:32] there are steps you want to follow
[34:37] so that's what i'm praying for now i'm
[34:38] just you know i'm praying for one
[34:39] specific area financially and then if
[34:41] once if once
[34:43] i get victory in that area like i said
[34:44] that actually open up
[34:46] many more opportunities to be generous
[34:50] so jesus said the rich are hardly saved
[34:52] let's apply this to laodicea
[34:55] so we have prophetically and
[34:57] statistically fewer and fewer people are
[34:58] going to be saved right jesus said fewer
[35:00] and fewer are saved the the pyramid
[35:02] comes up brothers are at the very top of
[35:03] the pyramid waiting for the capstone the
[35:05] rapture
[35:07] he said and our ministry has to be flat
[35:09] right our ministry has to be totally
[35:10] flat so it can receive the pyramid in
[35:12] other words our ministry must look just
[35:14] like jesus christ's ministry amen amen
[35:20] so may god help us praise god god help
[35:21] us to have the character of jesus christ
[35:24] i remember this psalm 37 25 i have been
[35:27] young and now i'm old yet i've not seen
[35:30] the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[35:32] bacon bread now we know this is just
[35:33] probability this is a this is a wisdom
[35:35] scripture right
[35:37] because lazarus was saved the poor
[35:39] beggar lazarus and he was begging bread
[35:42] david never seen it it's like he lived
[35:44] in a time of uh prosperity i said he he
[35:47] lived in like a lameness in time
[35:49] a lot of prosperity he never seen a
[35:51] righteous man begging but here jesus
[35:54] gives an example of a righteous man
[35:55] begging the dogs were licking sores the
[35:58] dogs
[36:00] i was telling austin about my mom you
[36:01] know when she had cancer she had black
[36:03] swords i forgot about that all over her
[36:05] back
[36:05] and people say oh she wasn't healed or
[36:07] like like people might die oh i don't
[36:09] believe in miracles my mom's my mom and
[36:11] dad's salt there's black bruises
[36:13] everywhere
[36:14] and then a prayer and just soon after
[36:16] that week later they're all gone
[36:18] because jesus is the healer praise god
[36:20] hallelujah
[36:22] so see david lived in a time
[36:25] there was a time of well all the
[36:26] righteous people never had to beg
[36:30] but then in jesus time a thousand years
[36:32] later there were some righteous that
[36:34] were begging bread
[36:37] okay
[36:38] so see god has ordained uh
[36:41] god may ordain your life
[36:44] for more wealth or for less wealth now
[36:46] right now church if we look at our state
[36:48] we can kind of see where god's taking us
[36:51] like i'm 41.
[36:53] i mean retirement's only 20
[36:55] 23 years away for me
[36:57] i've already put 18 years in
[37:00] i mean i'm towards the middle i can kind
[37:01] of see the trajectory you know unless
[37:03] something happens right
[37:05] kind of see where we're going
[37:07] now the younger you are of course the
[37:08] more you want to invest and the more
[37:09] things can happen
[37:11] okay but remember
[37:13] we all want to we all want god's plan
[37:16] for our life the lord is the maker of us
[37:18] all
[37:20] he's got a spiritual portion for you to
[37:23] uh deal with to be faith over and he's
[37:25] got a natural monetary portion you're
[37:27] supposed to be faithful over as well
[37:30] okay now i'm going to switch over to
[37:31] some brother brown quotes here so i just
[37:32] want to get that thought across
[37:34] so you can switch over here i'm going to
[37:36] uh
[37:38] show a few quotes here about god's place
[37:44] now here's a little look at remember
[37:46] brother ramses when i went over this
[37:47] years ago remember when kevin simon were
[37:49] here that when they were coming to our
[37:51] church i preached on finances i remember
[37:53] cam saying even when he preached on
[37:54] money it was anointed
[37:56] and i'm like well lord annoy me for
[37:58] today because i i don't feel it all the
[37:59] time
[38:00] yeah you preach all money it's like oh
[38:02] it's gonna be a hard sermon everybody's
[38:03] gonna be you know thinking about money
[38:05] and i don't wanna be a failure lord i
[38:07] need money you know things like that you
[38:08] think about all the trials that are
[38:10] associated with money right financial
[38:12] trials but i trust the lord will bless
[38:14] you here even more i said we'll try to
[38:15] finish up here in a little bit by god's
[38:17] grace
[38:19] you're at 12 30 right man
[38:21] yeah
[38:23] dory
[38:24] now here let's look at a few thoughts
[38:26] here about brother graham's financial
[38:27] testimony here
[38:29] now of course um
[38:32] i shared with this with you on wednesday
[38:34] brother ram in the church age book
[38:36] uh wrote about
[38:38] john wesley i don't know if lee vale did
[38:40] this research or not i actually couldn't
[38:41] find it in the actual sermon but anyways
[38:44] he was talking about john wesley's a
[38:45] church age messenger his favorite saying
[38:47] on the subject of money was get all you
[38:49] can
[38:50] save all you can
[38:52] and give all you can
[38:55] now brother bam said he wesley was not a
[38:57] rich man on purpose
[38:59] he could have been a rich man but he was
[39:01] not a rich man and he chose that on
[39:03] purpose
[39:05] okay
[39:07] now like i told you with with me i have
[39:09] two incomes my wife has income so that's
[39:10] something you want to pray about but
[39:12] don't let those incomes take you away
[39:13] from the house of god
[39:16] and especially your personal time with
[39:17] the lord
[39:19] don't let us your income now you think
[39:20] well brother jessica what do you mean
[39:22] you work well for my i got to prepare a
[39:24] sermon so every saturday morning i'm
[39:26] here i'm usually here at the church or
[39:27] studying by 5 30 a.m until like 12 or 1
[39:30] or 2.
[39:32] that's my second job that's when i'm
[39:33] working
[39:36] you know that's where i make that's
[39:37] where i make that extra income you know
[39:39] that's work
[39:40] like i said during school year i work
[39:41] seven days a week i don't get any days
[39:43] off
[39:45] so that that's just god's calling for my
[39:46] life you know
[39:49] so that that's how you get all you can
[39:51] like i was telling austin you know you
[39:53] find hours and you're weak oh i could
[39:55] put do a little side job here i can do a
[39:56] little i see little errors here
[39:59] if i can just increase that uh you know
[40:01] i can let's say you could get 200 extra
[40:03] dollars a month you could put that down
[40:04] on your debt you know put that down in
[40:05] the house or put that down and pay off
[40:07] the debt whatever it would be so john
[40:10] wesley says get all you can
[40:12] save all you can and then give all you
[40:14] can as well praise god
[40:16] i just love that beautiful
[40:18] uh beautiful quote there from john
[40:20] wesley
[40:22] something to keep in mind there by god's
[40:23] grace
[40:25] now uh you remember this
[40:27] the man was doing church order uh right
[40:29] after christmas in 1963.
[40:33] brother branham said he kept books of
[40:35] his money at his house and he said
[40:36] people would come by his house and say
[40:38] i'm reverend so-and-so i had some
[40:40] trouble down the road i need a new set
[40:41] of tires and i know that i just come
[40:43] from the meeting and had an offer now
[40:44] look at this look at this look at how
[40:46] god arranges this brother i just got a
[40:48] love offering from a church he comes
[40:50] home and the first thing is
[40:52] uh preacher yes i need some new tires do
[40:54] you have any money and like he can't lie
[40:57] right he just got back from the meeting
[41:00] he just got a love offering he's like
[41:02] well sure i want to help another
[41:03] preacher i'll get you some tires at
[41:05] church how much would tires cost today
[41:07] if you get good ones it's over four
[41:08] hundred or five hundred dollars
[41:10] unless they got some savings you know
[41:12] buy three get one free
[41:15] like that like that's a real reality
[41:16] they probably jack up the price anyway
[41:19] just
[41:20] tried to save you
[41:21] but look and look i he said i'd give him
[41:24] a set of tires
[41:26] and look in the minutes there was never
[41:28] such a minister that never lived in such
[41:30] a place
[41:32] so he knew he was he knew he was being
[41:34] deceived
[41:35] right
[41:37] but he just wanted to give
[41:41] and there is 10 or 20 000 so
[41:44] some range 10 or 20 000 on the books
[41:47] from these years that i give out like
[41:49] that never know nothing about them where
[41:51] they was
[41:54] so it's people that come by and say hey
[41:55] sister or they say uh pastor can i
[41:58] borrow a hundred bucks sure and then you
[42:01] never see him again
[42:02] hey oh brother can i borrow 500 what's
[42:05] your name oh okay i'll text you you text
[42:07] him you never hear back from
[42:09] you ever had that before
[42:11] i've had that
[42:12] oh i'll text you and yeah we come to
[42:14] church or you want to go in a book or
[42:16] something like that
[42:20] come to find out other ministers say why
[42:22] he got me for so so much money
[42:25] con artist
[42:26] [Laughter]
[42:29] i said the church now is not responsible
[42:31] only for their own
[42:33] see that's the only time i'll give out
[42:34] money to usually
[42:36] uh i give out money to other people
[42:38] right out of my ties is when i know
[42:40] everybody's got what they need here you
[42:42] got food shelter
[42:44] we got all things in god
[42:47] see that's what a church is a church i'm
[42:49] responsible for your well-being amen
[42:52] praise god
[42:54] that's why i told you let me know if
[42:55] you're struggling i want to help you out
[42:56] by god's grace
[42:58] right that's why we're here i want to
[42:59] take care of my own i want to take care
[43:00] of my my season right and i'm a machine
[43:03] too you know we're all she praise god
[43:07] he says that's right that's their own
[43:08] responsibility
[43:10] so 10 to 20 000 over the years
[43:14] sometimes a scam artist
[43:15] not always but sometimes a scam artist
[43:18] now i showed us a brother austin did you
[43:20] know bill graham he went out to eat
[43:21] every sunday between services when he
[43:23] was in jeopardy
[43:25] now this
[43:26] even a brother he uh emailed me this
[43:28] week overseas he's from india he's like
[43:30] can i go take a test on sunday or is it
[43:32] a sin to miss church
[43:34] well if it's a sin to miss church and
[43:36] work on sunday then brother graham was
[43:38] helping these people sin because they
[43:39] were working at a restaurant
[43:41] and the church said
[43:43] hello
[43:46] see we all know not everybody's gonna be
[43:48] saved
[43:50] right but the same time do we believe
[43:51] everybody should worship on sunday yeah
[43:53] is everybody going to worship on sunday
[43:55] no very few are going to actually
[43:58] that's why i tell people when you used
[43:59] to go to giant eagle place i said thanks
[44:00] for working on the sunday i appreciate
[44:02] you working today because you helped out
[44:03] my family i used to tell that when you
[44:04] go to chipotle i said hey thanks for
[44:06] working today i really appreciate that
[44:07] that gives my wife a day off now things
[44:09] are different now that's okay
[44:10] that's just it
[44:11] there's times and seasons for everything
[44:13] but look at that last sunday i was going
[44:15] into the blueboard cafeteria it's still
[44:17] there today if you want to go you can go
[44:18] to the blueboard eat there it's a buffet
[44:20] now i heard some guys talking about it
[44:23] where i think about 80 percent of the
[44:25] congregation gathers on the sunday
[44:26] afternoon does that sound like that's
[44:27] how we all used to go to chipotle on
[44:29] sunday
[44:30] you got your chipotle back i got mine
[44:32] you got your we all got your bullet back
[44:34] that's how churches are right
[44:36] eighty percent of the brown tabernacle
[44:38] would after first service they go eat
[44:40] the blue bar eat out and they all come
[44:42] back for the evening service
[44:44] that's just humans
[44:46] right that's just human nature
[44:48] it's nice to get a meal isn't it nice to
[44:50] get a meal that you have to cook
[44:52] right but you got to balance that when
[44:54] things get tight when inflation comes up
[44:56] you got a good got to cut some costs
[44:57] somewhere
[44:59] right
[45:00] like for me i could have cut costs other
[45:02] places and still going on to eat but to
[45:03] me the best fix was just to stop eating
[45:06] out
[45:08] right
[45:09] and i've been through this before like i
[45:10] said i we used to do this we used to eat
[45:12] peanut butter and jelly with baby lydia
[45:14] okay well everybody went out to eat we'd
[45:16] be eating peanut butter and jelly
[45:22] now how much money did brother brandon
[45:23] have saved three years before he passed
[45:25] away
[45:26] how much do you have in his bank account
[45:27] he told us
[45:28] he told us
[45:30] i said where in the world would i ever
[45:31] get forty thousand dollars so brother
[45:33] graham had the irs investigate him
[45:36] because he would go to meetings and
[45:38] uh people would write donations and he
[45:41] would just sign him william branham and
[45:42] then put him in the church bank account
[45:44] well that was that was wrong
[45:47] he should not have taken any money in
[45:49] his name because if he does that then he
[45:50] has to pay taxes on that right so
[45:52] whoever these must be devil possessed
[45:54] finance guys right these irs guys they
[45:57] went back through all of his records and
[45:59] found he owed forty thousand dollars on
[46:01] taxes now he really didn't but because
[46:03] he signed them he had yeah he had to
[46:05] take responsibility for the taxes
[46:07] and so they said you gotta pay back
[46:08] forty thousand dollars
[46:10] that's a lot of money i'm gonna show you
[46:11] how much that money that is today
[46:13] with inflation
[46:14] you think 40 000 is a lot now you should
[46:16] have been there in 1962.
[46:19] he said i said you know my bank account
[46:21] here is said about a hundred dollars or
[46:23] maybe less
[46:26] he had three kids this time three kids
[46:29] right
[46:30] sarah
[46:31] rebecca joseph
[46:34] billy paul's already married out of the
[46:35] house with his second wife you know
[46:37] that's wrong but
[46:39] made a mistake
[46:41] where would i get 40 some thousand
[46:42] dollars and i said i've got nothing for
[46:44] collateral i haven't got it that's all
[46:48] i love this because
[46:50] if you're serving god and you have some
[46:52] something come up
[46:53] god will make a way to help you out amen
[46:58] when you have nothing you can trust the
[47:00] the god who owns a cattle on a thousand
[47:02] idols praise god amen i thought i like
[47:05] this church i found in most cases god
[47:07] always sends me the relief right before
[47:10] the big cost comes right i share that on
[47:12] wednesday i didn't know all these all
[47:14] these things were going to break one
[47:15] after another cars fridges i didn't know
[47:19] they're going to break god knew they're
[47:20] going to break
[47:22] and so god said it right before they all
[47:24] broke
[47:25] because god has a sense of humor praise
[47:27] god and god is a faithful father amen
[47:29] amen
[47:30] hallelujah glory
[47:33] just like joseph that prayed lord you
[47:35] know the integrity of my heart praise
[47:37] god amen
[47:38] we can say the same thing
[47:40] financially lord you know i've been i've
[47:42] used integrity i've been honest i paid
[47:43] my tithes give offerings lord you know
[47:45] the integrity of my heart just send some
[47:47] blessing i need your help i need some
[47:49] financial assistance say it lord and
[47:51] heavenly father says yes i will praise
[47:53] god
[47:54] at least that time i don't know about
[47:55] these future times right we don't know
[47:58] he may let us go through struggles
[48:00] especially before the rapture who knows
[48:02] the squeeze
[48:03] they're going to have control over all
[48:05] finances that's where this is digital
[48:07] currency is going to right
[48:09] that's the only way they can stop all
[48:11] all spending and buy is to make
[48:12] everything digital likely
[48:17] likely
[48:19] so let's look at these costs so how much
[48:20] did brother graham have in his bank
[48:21] account less than 981 dollars that's
[48:24] today's money
[48:26] so he didn't even have that emergency a
[48:28] thousand like i was telling you about
[48:29] like you like all of us could do
[48:33] it's his bank account if you want to
[48:34] look at it today we've been about 900
[48:36] 900 850 bucks something something like
[48:38] that
[48:40] but he gave away somewhere between 10 or
[48:43] 20 000 he gave away
[48:46] nearly 98 to 196 thousand dollars
[48:49] today's money
[48:56] now how much did he owe church to the
[48:57] irs he owed almost 400 000
[49:01] in today's money
[49:03] almost half a million dollars church
[49:06] that's how much you do
[49:08] but i love this story because it has a
[49:10] happy ending
[49:12] god provides first children praise god
[49:18] now here's where he tells where how he
[49:20] paid off that forty thousand dollars
[49:22] anybody remember how he paid it out
[49:25] we went down to the bank i got brothers
[49:27] right here in this church that stood on
[49:29] my note and i put a note in and got the
[49:31] forty thousand dollars and paid it off
[49:34] so numerous brothers come together hey
[49:35] you give five thousand you give ten you
[49:38] give four thousand three thousand these
[49:39] brothers come together and gave brother
[49:41] brandon forty thousand dollars to get
[49:42] out of debt oh hallelujah amen
[49:46] see how god had to send some rich people
[49:48] to his church to take care of the poor
[49:50] preacher
[49:51] see that amen hallelujah
[49:54] so see
[49:56] you know for our day which one are you
[49:58] gonna be are you the poor one that
[49:59] people got to help out you might be
[50:01] or give me the one that has more wealth
[50:03] and you can help out somebody else you
[50:05] see it's still the same body of christ
[50:07] right
[50:09] so god has to have some more wealthy to
[50:12] help out those who are not
[50:14] and god found it fit that his prophet
[50:17] was not very wealthy so god had actually
[50:19] at least one millionaire in the church
[50:21] that's right at least one millionaire in
[50:22] the church to help out brother brandon
[50:27] and look what he says i put i went and
[50:29] put my arm around my wife i said honey
[50:31] i'm free what a feeling to be free and
[50:33] so now i can pay it back now no i don't
[50:35] know if he ever did church i don't know
[50:37] if you ever paid those brothers
[50:39] they lived from this this was 19
[50:40] basically 1963 two three only lived
[50:43] three more years
[50:46] now look what he says i can pay it back
[50:47] at four thousand dollars a year now i
[50:49] can't loaf anymore now look he caught
[50:51] himself low
[50:52] now of course he wasn't a loafer
[50:54] but he just felt bad because all the
[50:56] other brothers are working and he just
[50:57] preaches and goes from convec convention
[50:59] to venture he called himself a loafer
[51:03] but he was really doing the work of
[51:05] jesus christ amen
[51:08] isn't that so humble i just love our
[51:09] progress
[51:10] i'm i'm done loafing i'm gonna go work
[51:12] hard now like
[51:14] praying for the sick is hard
[51:16] preaching is hard that is hard work
[51:20] he said i can't loaf anymore folks
[51:23] i got to go out and go to work
[51:27] it takes me 10 years to pay it back if
[51:29] jesus doesn't come and when that when he
[51:31] does all that so be all settled down
[51:33] anyhow
[51:35] i already believe that
[51:39] god's got a poor preacher that's okay
[51:41] i've got a couple of millionaires in
[51:42] there
[51:43] to pay off the preachers then
[51:46] praise god
[51:49] i love it god is god is so faithful oh
[51:51] yes so who was the millionaire this guy
[51:53] was a millionaire
[51:55] bill dowd
[51:56] those out there on tape many times
[51:58] brother baptized him when he was older
[51:59] than 90
[52:01] and he was the father of sister marilyn
[52:04] we saw her a couple years ago she's
[52:05] still alive her husband brother tom
[52:07] passed away
[52:09] but we stayed at their house one time
[52:10] because they go to they used to go to
[52:11] bible believers i think she still goes
[52:12] to bible university in lima ohio
[52:15] so the millionaire was billed out
[52:17] i forget how he got his money
[52:19] um but just to give an idea so god knew
[52:21] the irs was going to attack brother
[52:23] branham he's going to have almost a 400
[52:25] 000 debt as far as today's money so god
[52:28] had to have an old man
[52:30] millionaire going to brother brother
[52:31] brother god's church and say i want to
[52:33] get saved
[52:34] i don't know i want to serve jesus
[52:36] christ that's the brother i'm baptizing
[52:38] at 90 years old praise god
[52:40] and then there he was and because he was
[52:42] retired a millionaire he followed over
[52:44] the red you can hear it on tape he
[52:45] fouled around all around the nation just
[52:47] driving he and his old wife 90 years old
[52:50] driving at every meeting
[52:52] there's brother and sister dab you can
[52:54] hear him say it on tape
[52:56] god had to raise up a millionaire to
[52:58] take care of their debts i said god you
[53:00] can still do it today amen is that right
[53:03] amen
[53:05] now look he paid it off three years
[53:06] before he died
[53:07] it wasn't like oh now my debts are free
[53:09] now i can become a millionaire that
[53:11] that wasn't my favorite idea he was just
[53:14] thankful to have this debt off him and
[53:16] his family
[53:20] you see god knows what you need
[53:22] god knows what you need he went through
[53:24] years of suffering i think it was like
[53:25] five or six years forty thousand dollars
[53:27] all these years of suffering and then
[53:29] finally got
[53:31] send somebody who can pay off his debt
[53:38] now also
[53:39] just so you know
[53:40] this church we school we used to go to
[53:42] church that was where i was ordained to
[53:43] preach that's where lydia was dedicated
[53:45] and that's where i was married at their
[53:47] church
[53:48] uh and by believers of lyman
[53:52] this guy at when he died he was a mater
[53:54] he let all the money
[53:56] uh be inherited to them and then they
[53:58] set up a foundation to build the church
[54:01] there
[54:02] now a foundation is when you have a lot
[54:03] of money you invested okay so let's say
[54:05] it was a million dollars well they put
[54:06] that in stock market right they invest
[54:08] in stocks and bonds and other things
[54:11] roth iras
[54:13] and it makes investments
[54:15] and they get more money
[54:17] well because of this man and their
[54:19] dedication
[54:20] they still have a school there
[54:23] all this guy's investments is reaching
[54:25] down one generation
[54:27] two generation it's like three his his
[54:30] millionaire money is still benefiting
[54:31] the children of god like three or four
[54:33] generations later
[54:35] that's what if god makes you wealthy
[54:37] that's what you want to do crazy
[54:39] and now they don't have to send those
[54:41] school those kids to those some of those
[54:42] bad things we got some good public
[54:43] schools here we're thankful for that
[54:45] everyone has you guys go too i don't
[54:46] know if you know that there was that air
[54:47] heads
[54:50] but they don't have those parents
[54:51] they're alive they don't have to send
[54:52] their kids to the public school where
[54:54] there might be questionable teachers
[54:56] things like that
[54:57] they can send them to the christian
[54:58] school all because one man and his wife
[55:01] were burdened
[55:03] right and god knew they'd have a need
[55:04] and that this wealth now this this
[55:07] million dollars or maybe it was
[55:08] multi-million is now blessing the
[55:10] children of god three or four
[55:11] generations later
[55:13] that's called influence praise god
[55:17] what's the word i was looking forward
[55:18] for a different word
[55:22] that's called legacy that's what that
[55:23] means that's called
[55:25] what's another word for legacy yeah you
[55:26] got one with the tip of your tongue
[55:29] a second brain
[55:31] legacy
[55:34] destiny destiny legacy something like
[55:36] that you know you leave a legacy like
[55:38] this is a legacy that's impacting
[55:40] thousands of people
[55:42] right
[55:46] and so also yeah i don't know how many
[55:48] brothers in the church this man hired
[55:50] he had a uh business remember this
[55:52] brother uh
[55:54] he had a cleaning business
[55:56] or a cleaning supplies business so like
[55:57] all the paper towels in there in our
[55:59] bathroom
[56:00] paper towels toilet paper
[56:02] sprays pinging sprays
[56:04] rags you know gloves
[56:06] he had a million dollar business too
[56:09] and i don't know how many brothers he
[56:11] employs right now still it's called
[56:13] brown uh brown supply company his name's
[56:16] tom brown
[56:18] he pays the salaries of like numerous
[56:20] brothers in the message
[56:23] and so they you know they
[56:25] they get a good income they never work
[56:26] sundays
[56:28] they never work wednesday nights
[56:30] see when you're the boss you can
[56:31] determine the work schedule
[56:34] hey you praise god amen
[56:36] she makes me want to be a business owner
[56:38] but i'm just not that smooth
[56:40] at least that was well you never know
[56:42] you never said you never know what's
[56:43] going to happen some of you guys might
[56:44] have a good idea somebody might start a
[56:45] good business center
[56:47] we'll see it's the lord terrorists with
[56:48] more terrorism sure
[56:50] see how see how being faithful with
[56:52] money can help you bless thousands of
[56:54] people and especially god's people
[56:57] if you're just faithful but god is
[56:59] putting your hands i don't want to be
[57:00] faithful
[57:01] i'm almost done here i'm almost done
[57:05] he said now when they rebuilt webster
[57:06] when they renovated the bram tabernacle
[57:08] they made it about a third larger
[57:11] and if you've ever visited there you can
[57:12] see where it used to be smaller and then
[57:14] they expanded it by like a third
[57:17] other women i've been there
[57:18] and many great donors in the church that
[57:20] helped do it such as our brother dial
[57:22] and sister dao sitting here and many
[57:24] others that's donated heavy to this
[57:26] cause
[57:27] so why did god have to send millionaires
[57:29] there to get his profit out of debt away
[57:31] from the government attacking him and to
[57:34] make the church larger
[57:36] because they were overflowing they have
[57:37] enough seats
[57:38] we don't have
[57:42] but see god had descendants of
[57:43] millionaires in order to meet the needs
[57:46] so what am i saying god will always meet
[57:48] our needs if we continue to humble
[57:50] ourselves and seek him and work hard
[57:51] little by little god will bless us if we
[57:53] labor and sow and reap god will bless us
[57:56] and then we can do god's will praise god
[57:58] amen we can influence this generation of
[58:00] the lord there is more generations
[58:02] praise god
[58:06] isn't that something
[58:08] because of one man's faithfulness
[58:11] all these generations are benefiting and
[58:12] blessed
[58:15] it's just a beautiful it's a beautiful
[58:17] thing what god can do uh with finances
[58:21] little random said i could have had it
[58:22] in other words to pay for his
[58:24] his 40 000 debt i could have took the
[58:26] money people would give me
[58:28] i'd be more than a millionaire i could
[58:29] have had stray of buildings you wouldn't
[58:31] have to rent this so i guess they
[58:33] offered motherboard buildings maybe i'd
[58:35] say come on in take over see you don't
[58:36] have to run a building but my i've tried
[58:38] to think that make jesus christ my
[58:40] pattern this is what he did
[58:42] now we can't all do this right what if
[58:44] brother dow didn't what if brother dial
[58:46] made jesus this battered
[58:49] brother ramsey would have that debt
[58:52] to see some people are called to really
[58:54] give everything away
[58:56] but then others are called to be really
[58:58] successful handling money so they can
[59:00] help others get out of debt
[59:02] don't you think the same god who gets
[59:04] you out of debt or if you're poor or
[59:06] helps you get somebody like that don't
[59:07] you think the same guy's going to risk
[59:08] the reward both of them
[59:10] yes
[59:11] absolutely god's going to reward both of
[59:13] them
[59:14] because one was focused on preaching
[59:16] right he didn't want to work out there
[59:18] he wanted to spend all this time
[59:19] preaching and praying for the sick but
[59:20] the other was businessman good deals buy
[59:23] sell margin profit
[59:26] but find sell expand build
[59:29] one guy was like that the other guy i'm
[59:31] just preaching i don't know i don't want
[59:32] i don't want the money i don't want the
[59:33] big don't give me the millions don't
[59:34] give me the buildings i just want to
[59:36] preach stay just like jesus christ
[59:38] and yet jesus anointed him to make
[59:40] millions today
[59:42] to help out the one who didn't have me
[59:48] he said look i've tried to make jesus my
[59:50] power look jesus could have created fish
[59:53] right he could have created money
[59:58] he could make water from wine or wine
[1:00:00] for water he could feed with thousands
[1:00:02] of two fishes and a loaf of two of bread
[1:00:04] but yet he didn't have a place to lay
[1:00:06] his head
[1:00:08] he was our example not something to
[1:00:09] shine but something that glows the
[1:00:11] gospel
[1:00:12] but yet god has millionaires
[1:00:15] right who seem like they can make one
[1:00:17] deal and man they can it's almost like
[1:00:18] they can make money up here
[1:00:20] they can sell this sell that that's how
[1:00:22] tim myers was brother
[1:00:23] he can just do a deal man and just make
[1:00:25] all that money like how do you do that
[1:00:27] man
[1:00:29] he just built that wage financially you
[1:00:31] see the effects of it
[1:00:34] i remember when he called me up he said
[1:00:35] oh man i'm at a quarter million dollars
[1:00:37] in sales for the year he said my goal
[1:00:39] for next year is
[1:00:41] half a million and they said my goal for
[1:00:42] next year is a million and he reached
[1:00:44] all those goals
[1:00:47] you see
[1:00:48] some people are built that way
[1:00:50] now those of us that are better be rich
[1:00:52] in the good works
[1:00:54] or else those riches will ensnare you'll
[1:00:57] get trapped in
[1:00:58] something with with money and sin
[1:01:02] right
[1:01:05] the other man makes jesus example it's
[1:01:07] like bill dao made solomon his example
[1:01:11] or david right or some wise investor
[1:01:15] but both were led by the holy spirit
[1:01:18] praise god
[1:01:23] now did you remember this brother graham
[1:01:24] got tempted remember this the
[1:01:25] denominations a brother named brother
[1:01:27] pope i don't know if you remember this
[1:01:28] on tape just from this sermon
[1:01:30] a
[1:01:31] denominational brother named brother
[1:01:33] pope come to program and say brother
[1:01:35] it's a shame by what you do
[1:01:37] look what are you you can hardly afford
[1:01:39] buy yourself a meal
[1:01:41] he's trying to get him to leave his the
[1:01:43] truth and come over and denominations
[1:01:46] i said look at oral roberts and i'm
[1:01:48] stepped in and look look out there 100th
[1:01:50] of the ministry you got look at what
[1:01:51] they do i said yeah that's right
[1:01:54] oral roberts has not even 100 percent of
[1:01:56] my ministry
[1:01:59] he said my group will take you and we'll
[1:02:00] take you right in you'll be one of the
[1:02:02] nomination brothers we'll give you the
[1:02:03] right hand of fellowship and we'll
[1:02:05] charter a plane and give you wages of
[1:02:07] five hundred dollars a week
[1:02:10] he was making a hundred
[1:02:13] a week at that time
[1:02:15] so times five he said i'll
[1:02:18] i'll times five your income now think
[1:02:20] about your income right now what if
[1:02:22] somebody offered you five times that
[1:02:24] to leave the message would you do it
[1:02:28] what means more to you
[1:02:31] money or the gospel amen
[1:02:36] or more if you want it
[1:02:43] and we'll send you to every major city
[1:02:45] in the country this happened right in
[1:02:46] phoenix and brother and says now what
[1:02:49] what are the conditions i don't know the
[1:02:50] quote up here i don't have the next
[1:02:52] quote
[1:02:53] but i said what are the conditions he
[1:02:54] said well you're gonna have to get you
[1:02:56] have to let off on the women preachers
[1:02:58] and the initial evidence and the baptism
[1:03:00] in the name of jesus
[1:03:02] he said brother pope i'm so ashamed he
[1:03:04] said a man that would call me a prophet
[1:03:07] and ask me to compromise on the things
[1:03:09] that mean more to life than me amen
[1:03:13] praise god
[1:03:14] more than life is the word of god that's
[1:03:16] right
[1:03:18] i'll give you five times what you make
[1:03:21] somebody gave me five times i mean it'll
[1:03:23] be a lot of money
[1:03:24] but it wouldn't be worth
[1:03:26] nothing if we compromise on god's word
[1:03:30] make it rich real quick but rich in the
[1:03:31] wrong type of riches
[1:03:33] you want to be rich in faith hey man
[1:03:35] hallelujah
[1:03:38] yeah i'm going to finish this and we'll
[1:03:39] close by
[1:03:43] so they offered brother branham
[1:03:46] today
[1:03:46] five thousand dollars a week
[1:03:51] that's a long way
[1:03:52] or
[1:03:53] a cool over a quarter million dollars a
[1:03:55] year
[1:03:58] that's weird it's five times more than
[1:04:00] he was making
[1:04:01] if you'll just compromise on these
[1:04:03] things
[1:04:05] we can make you rich oh and then we'll
[1:04:07] fly you around too you don't have to
[1:04:08] drive he would drive that forward
[1:04:09] that four you see the sports station
[1:04:11] wagon it's a station wagon brother this
[1:04:13] long skinny thing
[1:04:15] you got a station lagging around the
[1:04:17] country god's prophet we could fly you
[1:04:19] around
[1:04:20] you're just compromising the truth but
[1:04:22] god's prophets never compromised
[1:04:28] [Applause]
[1:04:30] no matter what you're throwing from me
[1:04:31] no matter all the benefits all these
[1:04:32] things i'm not going to compromise
[1:04:40] remember hattie wright remember hattie
[1:04:42] wright
[1:04:43] she she said i'm gonna i'm gonna pledge
[1:04:44] fifty dollars to the tabernacle when
[1:04:46] this other guy's given hundreds of
[1:04:47] thousands
[1:04:50] program says she gave us 20 bucks to
[1:04:51] begin with he was going to give her 20
[1:04:53] bucks back
[1:04:55] and the holy spirit said don't give it
[1:04:56] to him
[1:04:57] and he said why lord and he said the
[1:04:59] lord put it on his heart and said it's
[1:05:00] just like jesus when jesus let the widow
[1:05:03] give the two mighties
[1:05:07] now look how much did she make a year
[1:05:08] church their farm that she worked on
[1:05:11] made less than 200 a year on that little
[1:05:13] old farm
[1:05:16] 200 today is about 2 000.
[1:05:21] can you imagine having two thousand
[1:05:22] dollars to live on
[1:05:24] this year
[1:05:26] i know someone who's pretty close to
[1:05:27] them
[1:05:28] because they're on government assistance
[1:05:31] right
[1:05:32] so brother brother i was making 100 a
[1:05:34] week right so brother man was making
[1:05:35] this and that's what the person made
[1:05:37] that's what sister heidi wright made per
[1:05:38] year
[1:05:40] brother i made this per week
[1:05:42] almost half
[1:05:44] my brother i was going to go give the 20
[1:05:46] back and jesus the holy spirit said
[1:05:47] don't give it back
[1:05:48] she's just like the widow
[1:05:50] in the bible
[1:05:51] all right
[1:05:52] and brother anderson specifically said
[1:05:54] this the holy spirit told me before we
[1:05:55] went over there and the third poll
[1:05:57] operated
[1:05:58] that's right
[1:05:59] you see god was going to bless her in a
[1:06:01] different way
[1:06:02] that
[1:06:10] so what's more valuable
[1:06:13] now see this also church proves god has
[1:06:16] a call for your life whether it be more
[1:06:17] poor or middle or higher god has a call
[1:06:20] for your life
[1:06:21] because god gave brother dao with us
[1:06:23] saith the lord as well
[1:06:24] she got to thus saith the lord the poor
[1:06:26] woman didn't but also the millionaire
[1:06:28] god blessed him
[1:06:31] see because god is not a
[1:06:33] uh god's not a favorite god doesn't have
[1:06:35] favorites there it is he's not a
[1:06:36] respecter of persons
[1:06:38] sorry the scripture's slipped by mine
[1:06:40] god's not a respecter of persons and god
[1:06:42] has a certain place and now remember
[1:06:43] with the widow woman you can give
[1:06:45] actually more than the rich people if
[1:06:47] you give more of your percentage of your
[1:06:49] income
[1:06:50] you can actually have greater rewards in
[1:06:51] heaven than the millionaire right
[1:06:54] because you know the millionaire is
[1:06:55] going to keep five million for himself
[1:06:56] in case of that happens right
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:01] i'm a millionaire i'm going to keep this
[1:07:02] so much i always have a safety net but
[1:07:05] the widow was like i got no safety net
[1:07:07] all i got is the safety net in heaven
[1:07:08] that's all i got
[1:07:12] two fifths two two-fifths of a penny not
[1:07:14] even half a penny she gave i looked it
[1:07:15] up two-fifths of a penny and jesus said
[1:07:17] she gave more than all the others
[1:07:21] because she gave out of her need not out
[1:07:22] of her excess
[1:07:26] that's a picture of sister hattie and
[1:07:27] the boys
[1:07:28] he's got a good testimony uh he was
[1:07:30] going to go out to war and he said
[1:07:31] brother ma'am i don't want to die
[1:07:34] should i go to war he said go right
[1:07:35] right before brother died he said go
[1:07:38] you'll be protected and so he went over
[1:07:40] to
[1:07:40] korea or vietnam was it i can't remember
[1:07:42] which one it was
[1:07:43] and he said he had he had the safest job
[1:07:45] in the entire place he was just a gas
[1:07:47] truck driver
[1:07:49] and brother man told him you'll be safe
[1:07:51] so you come back
[1:07:53] i don't know what happened to him but
[1:07:55] he's got a little testimony in the book
[1:07:57] their sister had
[1:07:58] two thousand dollars a year income
[1:08:03] but god gave her both her sons be saved
[1:08:06] see thus say the lord operated in both
[1:08:08] of their lives
[1:08:09] brother dao and sister wright
[1:08:12] the ram said that humble little woman
[1:08:14] had you right the first time this ever
[1:08:15] happened the third pole was upon a human
[1:08:17] being was on a little humble one who's
[1:08:19] the first one oh just like the
[1:08:20] resurrection who did jesus show the
[1:08:22] first resurrection to a former
[1:08:24] prostitute with seven devils amen mary
[1:08:27] magdalene praise god
[1:08:28] but see god was rewarding her for her
[1:08:30] faithfulness praise god
[1:08:32] god was lifting her up out of her humble
[1:08:34] despised condition she gained spiritual
[1:08:37] riches instead of natural riches amen
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] and so god did he said i'll do the same
[1:08:42] thing with the third pole i'll operate
[1:08:45] it first i'll open up the word the power
[1:08:46] of the word the spoken word i'll open
[1:08:48] that up on a widow woman
[1:08:51] but it's two kids and farms on a hill
[1:08:53] and makes two thousand dollars a year
[1:08:56] i'll i'll operate on her first
[1:08:58] that's what god does
[1:09:03] here's where brother dao was dying this
[1:09:05] is brother dallas testimony
[1:09:08] he said brother that was a trophy of
[1:09:10] god's grace when shaking his hand under
[1:09:12] the tent oxygen teddy was under i said
[1:09:14] brother thou you'll be all right i'll
[1:09:15] see you in the church again that's thus
[1:09:16] saith the lord see here he sits in the
[1:09:18] church right here brother died so the
[1:09:20] man was dying in a tent they had to have
[1:09:22] oxygen intense and he said thus saith
[1:09:24] the lord i'll see you in church again 90
[1:09:25] year old man and thus saith the lord
[1:09:27] came to pass
[1:09:29] see god does not respect your persons
[1:09:31] god has the calling for your life if
[1:09:33] you'll accept it
[1:09:34] how many one accepted by god's name
[1:09:36] let's stand to our feet
[1:09:38] as we stand musicians can come remember
[1:09:39] a brother said god had something for
[1:09:41] that widow who gave the two minds
[1:09:50] he was going to give that money back to
[1:09:51] sister hattie we said oh no sister don't
[1:09:53] do that no because we got plenty here we
[1:09:55] don't need that but jesus never told her
[1:09:57] not to do it
[1:09:58] he let her go ahead and do it because he
[1:10:00] knowed he had something for her down the
[1:10:01] road little something better you see
[1:10:04] so he just let her god love a cheerful
[1:10:07] gift
[1:10:09] like i was telling lena i had a good
[1:10:10] question god needs a poor person who's a
[1:10:12] cheerful giver just like he needs a rich
[1:10:14] person who's a cheerleader
[1:10:16] god needs someone who's going to
[1:10:17] overcome cancer or die with cancer or
[1:10:19] die in a car accident still holy ghost
[1:10:20] for a christian but god needs somebody
[1:10:22] over here who's going to be delivered
[1:10:23] from a car accident be healed from
[1:10:25] cancer and still be holy ghost failed
[1:10:27] amen praise god
[1:10:31] god makes one a millionaire and won a
[1:10:32] penny here
[1:10:34] they both get the state of the lord oh
[1:10:36] you praise god amen
[1:10:39] so the thing to do is find god what have

[1:11:46] had a greater reward in heaven than all
[1:11:48] those pharisees most of them were
[1:11:49] probably lost
[1:11:51] yet
[1:11:52] while you were in flesh you sat back and
[1:11:55] watched
[1:11:56] and used her as a testimony to the
[1:11:58] disciples to always remember the poor
[1:12:00] and remember that god loves the cheerful
[1:12:03] giver of god
