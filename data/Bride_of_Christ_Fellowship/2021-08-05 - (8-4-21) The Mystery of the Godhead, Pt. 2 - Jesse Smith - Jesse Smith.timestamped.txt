[0:13] let's go to uh a few scriptures here
[0:15] let's start with colossians 2 i'd like
[0:17] to look at the godhead again tonight by
[0:18] the grace of the lord
[0:20] you know i had a friend last night i
[0:22] sent him a free copy of the book and
[0:23] he's a trinitarian and
[0:25] he started reading it last night he said
[0:27] wow he said i'm really enjoying this
[0:28] chapter on the godhead
[0:30] i said i'm preaching on it if you want
[0:32] to come
[0:34] but maybe he'll listen in later you know
[0:35] by the grace of the lord but he and i
[0:37] have had great talks over the years in
[0:38] fact he's one of the gentlemen we
[0:39] talked bible club with but uh he can see
[0:43] a lot of christ in our lives and he's
[0:44] expressed that over the years and i'm
[0:46] just trusting god to do that also my
[0:47] mother-in-law is reading the book
[0:49] uh listening to it with her with her
[0:52] husband there
[0:53] um so we're thankful and you never know
[0:55] who's gonna listen to that's the great
[0:57] thing and
[0:58] just you just put it out there and and
[0:59] see what the lord does with it praise
[1:01] god
[1:02] it's his seed it's his word praise god
[1:04] he's going to do something with that his
[1:05] word cannot return void so
[1:07] i'm just excited to see you know what
[1:09] the lord will do with it
[1:10] and of course i hope hopefully you've
[1:12] had a chance to read through a little
[1:13] bit or
[1:14] maybe flip through it and maybe praying
[1:16] about starting reading it or something
[1:17] like that i hope it's a
[1:18] blessing to you as well of course you've
[1:20] heard it preached like i said i
[1:21] i don't feel bad if you don't read it
[1:23] cause you heard it preached but uh the
[1:25] some of the preachers have told me they
[1:26] said it's going to be a good reference
[1:28] for us so when we need to find
[1:29] information and
[1:30] scriptures to teach things they said
[1:32] it's going to be a great reference so i
[1:33] said praise the lord
[1:35] and uh i had a gentleman just emailed me
[1:37] from up north and
[1:38] he said wow he says it sounds like the
[1:40] holy spirit is writing it he said
[1:42] he said it doesn't sound like a man's
[1:44] writing it sounds like god's writing it
[1:46] from the perspective of the word
[1:48] he said it sounds like the word is
[1:50] writing it i said well
[1:51] i said i couldn't ask for a better
[1:53] compliment than that praise god i'm not
[1:54] looking for compliments i'm looking for

[4:59] for me
[5:00] with all your heart praise god may god
[5:02] has blessed you reading his word you may
[5:03] be seated here praise god
[5:08] okay so eventually i'll i have a a few
[5:12] slides well you know i might as well get
[5:13] them up here right now
[5:14] i'll just start there so yeah you can
[5:15] switch over i have just a couple of
[5:17] things to show
[5:19] um i have a few videos i may show as
[5:21] well um just to kind of
[5:23] follow up on last week and last week i
[5:25] was really stirred up by the things
[5:26] happening political
[5:28] um and i just want to maybe i got a
[5:31] little video i can share on that a
[5:33] little bit more on that
[5:34] by the grace of the lord um
[5:38] i was really upset by that last week i'm
[5:40] sure you could tell i was just kind of
[5:41] like really
[5:42] frustrated with that um
[5:46] but then brother william told me you
[5:47] know that's already been going on in his
[5:48] country for years and years and years
[5:49] you know
[5:50] but to me it's heartbreaking you know
[5:52] it's i know it is for you too and
[5:54] uh but to see it you know to see no
[5:57] justice
[5:58] it makes me weak it makes me cry to see
[6:02] justice cannot be carried out and that's
[6:03] what god wants to see god wants to see
[6:05] our hearts you know
[6:06] bleed he won't see our hearts cry when
[6:08] there's no justice you know he wants us
[6:10] to see us
[6:11] intercede when there's no one that will
[6:13] intercede
[6:14] so uh let's just look at this here i'll
[6:16] set a timer here by god's grace
[6:18] i try to do like 45 minutes or something
[6:19] like that
[6:21] see how that goes um so i just want to
[6:24] briefly uh review real quick
[6:26] uh part one look at the main points you
[6:28] know we saw at least
[6:30] five out of seven billion are uh idol
[6:33] worshipers worshipping more than one god
[6:35] at least then you have you know muslims
[6:37] they believe in one person but it's the
[6:39] wrong god
[6:40] so you have uh almost all seven billion
[6:43] worshiping the wrong god or gods
[6:47] we are a very very small minority that
[6:50] believes god is one person
[6:52] and will not divide the divinity into
[6:54] three persons
[6:56] so we are very thankful to be a part of
[6:58] this small group we are a very
[7:00] very tiny group and we saw how god
[7:03] chooses the words if god
[7:05] if god has pure words which all of god's
[7:07] words are pure then we must use his
[7:08] words
[7:09] and his words are manifestation right
[7:12] one god
[7:13] manifested in three ways and so we must
[7:16] use god's holy word anyone who changes
[7:18] them
[7:18] is called and gonna be called a liar
[7:20] anyone who adds or takes away
[7:22] will have their their name taken out of
[7:24] the book or plagues added to them
[7:26] in the lake of fire right so we are not
[7:28] going to add to the word we're just
[7:30] going to take what the word says
[7:32] okay and so then we last week we looked
[7:34] at we started looking at the eight
[7:35] problems of the trinity
[7:36] uh the first one is it's adds to the
[7:40] bible
[7:41] right it's not even taught in scripture
[7:43] even theologians admit that i'm just
[7:44] going to look at my notes here briefly
[7:46] and
[7:46] just kind of go over there but we saw
[7:48] that the words triune and trinity
[7:49] depending on their definition they're
[7:51] not bad words they're not bible words
[7:53] but they're just uh other way other
[7:55] words to say threefold right or three in
[7:58] one
[7:59] but if you apply it to persons it's
[8:02] paganism
[8:03] if you apply it to manifestations it's
[8:05] right it's okay
[8:07] but still the bible never used those
[8:09] words
[8:10] so we can see how brother adam was right
[8:12] to say trinitarianism
[8:13] is of the devil because that word and
[8:15] the definition
[8:16] and the dogma isn't even found in
[8:19] scripture
[8:19] it's an addition to the word of god and
[8:22] we saw how
[8:23] uh we saw how i guess we can just skip
[8:25] ahead here you know let me let me just
[8:26] skip ahead a little bit
[8:28] we saw how uh you know the trinity uh of
[8:31] of three persons is just paganism
[8:33] rebranded my friend said
[8:35] it's just a rebranding of the of the
[8:37] egyptian
[8:38] uh trinity right it's just rebranded and
[8:41] now it's got the name
[8:43] father son holy ghost uh the titles so
[8:45] they've
[8:46] they've just rebranded paganism and made
[8:48] three separate co-equal
[8:50] co-eternal persons which is
[8:54] unscriptural right uh totally on
[8:56] scripture as we as we saw
[8:58] uh secondly we saw how jesus and all the
[9:01] bible writers always use
[9:02] hebrew monotheism in other words they
[9:05] understood the godhead the same way the
[9:06] jews did
[9:07] jesus said we know what we worship
[9:09] salvation is of the jews
[9:11] jesus never said three persons right he
[9:13] always kept it and the apostles never
[9:15] argued about it the apostles never
[9:17] argued no he's two
[9:18] no he's three no he's four they never
[9:20] argued about it
[9:21] he was always just one person and then
[9:23] we haven't we didn't look at this last
[9:25] week but that we saw
[9:26] in previous weeks that athanasian creed
[9:28] has at least
[9:29] six contradictions okay uh and we looked
[9:32] at them with
[9:33] the kids bible study now look at this it
[9:35] was written in the 6th century
[9:37] so almost 500 years over 500 years
[9:40] after the last apostle died it took them
[9:42] 500 years to come up
[9:44] with a way to understand god but yet it
[9:46] contradicted the
[9:47] what the bible said about god and you
[9:50] would think any intelligent person would
[9:52] think
[9:52] if someone changes god after 500 years
[9:55] they're wrong
[9:56] if anyone changes anything about god
[9:58] after one year they're wrong
[10:00] right we know the baptism was changed 70
[10:02] years after jesus we know the word
[10:04] trinity was introduced 150 years after
[10:06] jesus
[10:07] and now this total creed total
[10:09] contradicting creed
[10:10] now 500 years after jesus makes it
[10:12] official that they want to worship
[10:14] doctrines and commandments of men
[10:16] rather than the word of god but we're
[10:18] saying only what paul said praise god
[10:20] we're preaching paul's gospel hallelujah
[10:23] we're not giving out
[10:24] leaven infused bread we're giving out
[10:27] unleavened bread tonight praise god
[10:29] we will not we will not serve the
[10:31] harlot's bread
[10:32] right when a harlot has relations what
[10:34] does she do the good man of the house is
[10:35] gone
[10:36] the bible said she makes a table of food
[10:40] she makes uh makes everything smell good
[10:41] you know she makes her bed
[10:43] she makes the table and everything and
[10:44] she invites the man and said the good
[10:46] man's
[10:46] gone i got food here i did my sacrifices
[10:49] i did all these things
[10:50] well that's just like the roman catholic
[10:51] church right while jesus's body is gone
[10:54] they feed their uh they feed the
[10:56] churches and the countries they
[10:58] they fornicate with they feed them their
[11:00] unholy bread
[11:02] it's leaven infused bread right and
[11:04] that's where the bible said they make
[11:06] love with their creeds
[11:07] and there are doctors and he and jesus
[11:09] said i'll cast
[11:10] them and all their children and all
[11:12] those that fortigate them
[11:14] into a bed of destruction aren't you
[11:16] glad church
[11:17] that's not your resting place amen your
[11:19] resting place
[11:20] is in the shelter of almighty god under
[11:22] the shadow of his wings amen
[11:24] hallelujah your shelter is under the
[11:26] wings of jehovah's eagle praise god
[11:29] but they're shelters in the bed of a
[11:31] harlot
[11:32] that's right i know that's rough but
[11:33] that's the truth especially when you see
[11:35] where it come from we don't come from
[11:37] the roman catholicism
[11:38] it comes from the first church of rome
[11:40] right uh which
[11:42] is uh ended up being the roman catholic
[11:44] church we'll we'll preach on that next
[11:45] the next mystery is the last one
[11:47] it's the seven stars and seven golden
[11:49] candlesticks now brother random uh
[11:53] already preached the seven uh church
[11:54] ages right so the candlesticks
[11:56] the bread but the bread here the bread
[11:58] gives us more revelation about that
[12:00] praise god
[12:01] we get more revelation about the church
[12:03] ages right uh we can dig deeper into
[12:05] history and pull out more things
[12:07] and so we can see that the bible names
[12:09] 12 mysteries praise god
[12:11] and so we're thankful that we can feast
[12:12] on those right we have the light of
[12:14] those church ages but we need to
[12:16] feast on the word of those church ages
[12:18] praise god the fresh bread
[12:20] of those churches we have the light of
[12:22] them shining that light shining in our
[12:24] hearts the light of the holy spirit
[12:26] praise god our lamps are burning with
[12:28] the same oil that fell on the day of
[12:30] pentecost amen
[12:31] hallelujah we're burning with that same
[12:34] fire praise god hallelujah
[12:36] thank god with the same oil the same
[12:39] fire
[12:40] the same christ standing in the midst of
[12:42] the seven golden candlestick
[12:44] he's here tonight amen oh before
[12:46] starting to feel good praise god amen
[12:48] we know that he's he's here praise god
[12:50] he's here he promised to be here
[12:52] and so see the leaven just spreading and
[12:54] spreading in more right it first spread
[12:56] to false baptism
[12:57] then it spread to the wrong terminology
[12:59] and then it spread to creeds 500 years
[13:01] later look where we are 1800 years after
[13:04] now you've got hail mary's and
[13:05] worshiping and kissing idols it's
[13:07] total paganism amen catholicism is total
[13:11] paganism praise god and few there be
[13:14] that find it
[13:15] but ours we have the privilege of
[13:17] calling saying come out of her my people
[13:20] that you not partake of that paganistic
[13:22] system praise god
[13:24] it's paganism rebranded ah
[13:28] see it's confusion and creeds always
[13:30] limit god see when they say
[13:32] when they say they're co-equal and
[13:34] co-eternal when they say they're
[13:35] co-equal that limits god
[13:37] right because the son says the father is
[13:40] greater than i
[13:41] that limits the knowledge that limits
[13:43] god and it makes it confusing
[13:45] but that's babylon for you babylon is
[13:48] confusion
[13:49] but god is not the author of confusion
[13:51] praise god
[13:52] you won't find that terminology in the
[13:54] bible we're not going to well i'll just
[13:55] go over them real quickly
[13:57] uh the creed says we worship a god in
[13:58] trinity jesus said we worship god in
[14:00] spirit and truth
[14:01] the creed says the son is uncreated the
[14:03] bible said jesus is the beginning of the
[14:05] creation of god
[14:07] the creed says the son is unlimited but
[14:09] jesus said i can do nothing except the
[14:11] father shows me
[14:12] praise god the creed says the son is of
[14:15] the father alone
[14:16] but the bible said the holy ghost
[14:17] conceived jesus amen
[14:19] the creed says none is greater none is
[14:21] less than another but jesus says the
[14:23] father
[14:24] is greater than i as we said the creed
[14:26] says god is three persons
[14:28] but the bible said jesus is the express
[14:30] image of his person
[14:33] amen one person praise god the invisible
[14:36] person
[14:36] has an image an express reproduction uh
[14:39] express image and that's the son jesus
[14:42] hallelujah
[14:44] thank god now
[14:47] just to make it clear again children and
[14:49] see i was remember i went through this
[14:50] last week
[14:51] but i want the children to say here's
[14:52] the lie part here
[14:54] they say they say the father is not the
[14:56] holy spirit that's a total lie
[14:59] and you have to say and they'll call you
[15:01] and i'm going to show this
[15:02] they call us heretics for denying this
[15:04] lie
[15:05] that's satan's always tactic the thing
[15:07] they're accusing of is what they're
[15:09] actually guilty of
[15:10] always i find it with all those people
[15:12] that leave the message they call me
[15:14] disingenuous they're the ones that are
[15:15] disingenuous
[15:17] right i got proof for that but i'm not
[15:19] going to get in that tonight i'll
[15:20] make sure the live stream is off when i
[15:21] say that because i don't have to argue
[15:23] about i'm not here to argue you know but
[15:25] just to make it plain i don't need more
[15:27] pressure in my life but
[15:28] you know uh see the father they say the
[15:30] father is not the holy spirit
[15:33] but yet they're both god that's a
[15:35] complete contradiction
[15:37] it's it's illogical it's insane
[15:41] they're completely insane right so see
[15:44] children this is a lie from hell the
[15:47] father is the holy spirit because jesus
[15:49] prayed
[15:50] holy father amen the father's holy
[15:53] praise god
[15:54] amen and the bible said grieve not the
[15:56] holy spirit of god
[15:58] whereby your seal to the day of your
[16:00] redemption there's not two spirits right
[16:02] there's not ten spirits
[16:03] there's one spirit and god is the holy
[16:06] spirit he said i
[16:07] am the holy one of israel amen jesus
[16:10] said that god is a spirit
[16:12] and they that worship him must worship
[16:14] him in spirit and in truth praise god
[16:17] so this is a total lie and so i just
[16:20] want to show that just so you have that
[16:22] in your mind there and remember church a
[16:24] a a contradiction is defined as a
[16:27] statement
[16:28] of a position opposite to one already
[16:30] made
[16:31] so they say say they say the father is
[16:33] god the holy spirit's god but they say
[16:35] the father is not the holy spirit
[16:36] well this is a contradiction to what
[16:38] they already said right that's what a
[16:40] contradiction is
[16:42] right so uh i just want
[16:45] you to keep that in mind here that that
[16:47] this is what they claim and they're bold
[16:49] with it they're getting more bold
[16:50] both both seeds are maturing
[16:54] this is maturing time we're laying in
[16:56] the prince of the sun getting more
[16:57] humble getting more like christ
[16:59] but they're standing in defiance to the
[17:01] sun
[17:02] and they're getting more bull with it
[17:04] and more air get with it all the time
[17:06] attacking us i'm going to show it to you
[17:08] at the end and i can't show the video
[17:10] because they're probably going to give
[17:11] me a strike on youtube again so
[17:13] i have to stop that i'll just have to
[17:14] show it at the end because these people
[17:16] are just
[17:17] crazy they're just crazy uh anyway
[17:20] so jesus said holy father so the father
[17:23] is the holy spirit right
[17:25] uh if not jesus had two fathers
[17:29] right and then uh if this is true then
[17:31] then jesus had two persons living in the
[17:34] one person i'm just reviewing these real
[17:35] quick
[17:36] right and why does a co-e why does a co
[17:39] why does an all-powerful person need two
[17:41] other
[17:42] all-powerful persons to live inside of
[17:43] him if he's all-powerful
[17:45] if he's already fully eternal and fully
[17:47] god why does he need two other persons
[17:49] that are fully god
[17:50] to come and live inside of him that
[17:52] gives him three minds instead of one
[17:54] but our god is not three-minute our god
[17:56] has one mind
[17:57] and his ways are higher than our ways
[17:59] his ways are way higher than trinitarian
[18:01] ways and thoughts amen
[18:03] their thoughts are so low they think
[18:05] three minds are in one mind
[18:07] a bunch of nonsense i confronted that
[18:08] man on believe the sign and he just
[18:11] you know he just kind of i'm not going
[18:12] to say much about that but it's on the
[18:14] debate
[18:15] all right it's on the debate see they
[18:18] deny
[18:18] that they they when they're on
[18:20] trinitarians it's okay but when they
[18:21] they're confronted with it they deny it
[18:23] just like the democrats
[18:24] right just like well just like most
[18:26] democrats and most republicans right
[18:28] they'll say one thing but when
[18:29] confronted they do the other it's
[18:32] just total flip-flop lies and no and
[18:34] these
[18:35] blind people don't even care but church
[18:37] god is watching
[18:39] the bible said god is a witness in your
[18:41] home relationships
[18:42] god is also a witness in everything that
[18:44] we do
[18:45] he's watching from heaven church and
[18:47] these people are going to reap what they
[18:49] sow
[18:51] did you see that one person that made
[18:53] that one person made an evil thing about
[18:55] president trump a few years ago
[18:56] like a real violent thing and now she's
[18:58] got cancer
[19:00] just a few years after doing this it was
[19:02] like a stunt it was a really wicked
[19:03] stunt she did
[19:04] now she's got cancer just it's just you
[19:07] know sad very sad
[19:09] but remember church trinitarianism is
[19:11] the breaking the first commandment let's
[19:13] read that let's go to exodus chapter 20
[19:15] please
[19:15] got your bibles there
[19:22] of course this is mount sinai when the
[19:24] law was given
[19:25] this member was about uh
[19:29] well you know i better not say that i'm
[19:30] not quite sure actually let me not say
[19:31] that
[19:33] uh exodus 20 verse one i there's a
[19:37] there's a thing i was studying so i
[19:40] better hold off on that
[19:41] chapter 20 verse 1. and god spake all
[19:43] these words saying i am the lord thy god
[19:44] which i brought thee out of the land of
[19:46] egypt out of the house of bondage
[19:47] thou shall have no other gods before me
[19:50] thou shalt have no other gods before me
[19:52] now i've talked to trinitarians i told
[19:53] you this story we used to ride together
[19:55] and carpool when we only had one car
[19:56] back in cuyahoga falls
[19:58] and they both and they all all three of
[20:00] them in the car admitted
[20:01] they knew the father and son but they
[20:03] didn't know the holy ghost really well
[20:06] now what what is that that means they
[20:08] already have
[20:09] two two persons above one person
[20:12] but god said don't put anybody in front
[20:14] of me well which one is it
[20:17] apparently they have two in front of one
[20:20] and if one is equally co-equal god like
[20:22] the others
[20:23] well then they've broken the commandment
[20:26] because they have two they know all
[20:27] about but they don't understand that
[20:28] holy spirit
[20:29] that great holy ghost that we talk about
[20:31] that we rejoice in they don't understand
[20:33] that but thank god we understand it
[20:35] praise god
[20:36] it's the presence of jesus christ in our
[20:38] souls
[20:39] and also in our midst anointing our
[20:41] minds anointing our bodies
[20:43] to carry out his will hallelujah
[20:47] they'll convict you and say something's
[20:48] going to happen at church today right
[20:50] it'll convince you like go speak to that
[20:51] person
[20:52] go pray for that sick person right give
[20:54] that person a love offering or something
[20:55] like that
[20:56] it'll speak to you it'll lead you it'll
[20:58] guide you it'll give you words to say
[21:00] you didn't even plan on saying praise
[21:02] god it'll give you dreams you didn't ask
[21:04] for praise god
[21:05] the foretell the future that's what the
[21:07] holy ghost is he puts
[21:08] god's word in your mouth amen
[21:12] and in your heart praise god but see
[21:15] they break this because
[21:16] they have at least two before the third
[21:20] and northern gods before me they break
[21:22] this first commandment
[21:23] so they're guilty of the first and what
[21:24] about all the others their children are
[21:26] disobedient
[21:27] married two three times cut their hair
[21:29] abominations i mean come on
[21:33] now the fourth uh there's eight problems
[21:36] now actually there's probably nine i
[21:37] thought about it later
[21:38] so if i ever re if i ever revise the
[21:40] book then revise the book rather
[21:42] the ninth problem will be all the fruits
[21:45] that the trinity uh
[21:46] doctrine has caused all the bad fruits
[21:49] in other words all the evils of the
[21:50] roman catholic church
[21:52] so because they started with the trinity
[21:54] at the beginning now what do they got
[21:56] they got this awful child molestation
[21:58] problem on both not just priests but
[22:00] nuns too
[22:01] that came out in 2018. they they they
[22:04] investigated these uh
[22:05] uh all all the uh uh all the priests in
[22:09] pennsylvania
[22:10] they investigate and they found like
[22:12] over a thousand victims
[22:15] and then they found just priests and
[22:16] then they started getting all these
[22:17] leaks of nuns doing the same thing
[22:20] wicked told it's totally infiltrated
[22:23] with wickedness
[22:25] right it's a it's an epidemic they say
[22:27] an epidemic of abuse
[22:30] right because power without character
[22:33] is satanic amen we've seen the politics
[22:36] we see it in the churches
[22:37] you see it everywhere a man's got to
[22:39] have christian character or he's going
[22:41] to pervert and abuse the power
[22:43] that's been placed inside of his hand
[22:44] thank god for the washing powers
[22:47] of the blood of jesus christ amen
[22:51] that's that's what we as have we all
[22:53] have some power here of some authority i
[22:55] have a lot of empowered authority
[22:56] but i'm yielded to the holy spirit i'm
[22:58] asking god to
[22:59] use me help me to yield every one of my
[23:01] actions and all my
[23:03] desires to his will and to treat
[23:06] everybody like
[23:06] they're all the saints of god with
[23:09] kindness and respect praise god
[23:11] hallelujah so the so that would be the
[23:15] eight that would be the ninth
[23:16] problem if i'd ever do a revision but
[23:18] the fourth
[23:19] is there's so many contradictions and
[23:21] inconsistencies
[23:22] amongst trinitarians like i showed you
[23:25] uh they rotate now here i've got a slide
[23:26] on this one
[23:27] okay so if you look up triatheism and
[23:30] webster dictionary
[23:31] this is a really weak definition but
[23:32] it's the only one i could find i didn't
[23:34] have a lot of time to addre had to drive
[23:35] to columbus
[23:36] the doctrine so the tritheism is the
[23:38] doctrine that the father-son only goes
[23:40] are three distinct gods
[23:43] now the word i want you to notice is
[23:45] distinct that means separate
[23:48] now when i first came to the message
[23:51] these evangelicals tried to talk me out
[23:53] of it so they said jesse god is a
[23:55] trinity so he had
[23:56] this pastor from the chapel handed me
[23:58] his thesis
[24:00] so it's a big report you have to write
[24:01] before they approve you as a pastor
[24:04] and in the thesis he said god exists in
[24:07] three equal beings
[24:08] eternally three distinct beings
[24:12] eternally that means he's always going
[24:14] to be three beings
[24:16] in church all they did was take out that
[24:19] word and put beings that's all he did
[24:22] in other words they are literally using
[24:24] the definition of
[24:25] triatheism three gods and just taking
[24:28] out the offensive word god and putting
[24:30] distinct being in there
[24:33] same thing say it's the exact same thing
[24:36] now other definitions from other
[24:38] dictionaries i've read
[24:39] they say that three co equal person
[24:42] or gods that exist distinctly and i
[24:46] looked at that when i saw that brother i
[24:47] bought i wanted
[24:48] i scanned it but i wanted to throw in
[24:50] the trash but i didn't cause i want to
[24:51] keep it as evidence
[24:52] and i'm glad i did because i still got
[24:54] it to show people don't
[24:56] if you ask a trinitarian they'll say no
[24:57] i don't believe that because they've
[24:58] never studied it
[25:00] see because they teach all these things
[25:02] and they it's just they just shovel
[25:03] these lies down they're just like
[25:04] this okay when's the super bowl party
[25:06] when are you gonna feed me when's the
[25:08] skating party
[25:08] yeah that's fine uh when's the video
[25:10] game party that's
[25:11] that's what they're waiting for when's
[25:13] the movie gonna start that that's what
[25:14] they're waiting for they're not really
[25:15] hungry for the word of god
[25:17] but the bible said we are we should be
[25:19] more noble searching the scriptures
[25:21] daily whether these things are so
[25:24] that's what a real noble christian does
[25:26] that's what a real royal seat of abraham
[25:28] does searches the bible scripture daily
[25:31] but they don't do that they just pass
[25:33] out a pamphlet all right let's go to the
[25:34] browns game
[25:35] let's go to the cavs game let's go
[25:38] drinking let's go out to the parties
[25:39] that's exactly that's what they did when
[25:40] i was in school and it's gotta be worse
[25:42] now
[25:43] it's gotta be way worse now that's how
[25:45] it was 20 years ago when i was there
[25:47] it's got to be a lot worse so i want you
[25:49] to see that that's
[25:50] that's the definition now remember they
[25:54] rotate church they rotate between
[25:55] tritheism
[25:57] and modalism modalism is just same god
[26:00] changing his form
[26:01] but modalism has some bad definition to
[26:02] it we'll get to that here soon
[26:05] and they rotate and church it's a
[26:07] fulfillment of
[26:08] ephesians where it says their children
[26:10] tossed to and fro
[26:12] carried on every wind of doctrine
[26:15] the same ones that say yeah god
[26:17] sometimes we see god try theism
[26:18] sometimes we see modalism the same ones
[26:21] say well yeah women can preach
[26:22] homosexuals can be pastors see because
[26:24] they're carried about they're tossed by
[26:26] every wind of doctrine they're tossed on
[26:28] homosexuality
[26:29] they're tossed on the godhead they're
[26:31] tossed on baptism sprinkling's okay you
[26:33] know
[26:33] sprinkling babies they baptize babies
[26:36] for what sin they haven't done
[26:38] any sins why they repent they haven't
[26:40] done anything
[26:41] but see they're just tossed to and fro
[26:43] but you and i stand there like a rack of
[26:45] ages
[26:46] we stand there anchor despite the storms
[26:48] of life we say anchored with the truth
[26:50] of god's word
[26:51] and nothing can move us because we're
[26:53] anchored to heaven praise god
[26:55] amen now the fifth problem is they
[26:59] uh the catholics didn't affirm the holy
[27:01] spirit as divine
[27:02] until 381 a.d oh my
[27:07] mercy almost 250 years
[27:10] right after christ they finally decide
[27:12] oh yeah maybe the holy spirit's
[27:13] divine too but remember the bible said
[27:18] in acts chapter 5 ananias lied to the
[27:21] holy ghost and god it was the same one
[27:23] same person so it took them 350 years to
[27:26] figure out what peter knew
[27:27] instantly praise god now six they're
[27:30] artwork right
[27:34] oh i'm going backwards okay yeah their
[27:36] artwork is deceptive
[27:38] right and the bible says
[27:42] that we ought not to think the godhead
[27:44] is like on the gold silver stone graven
[27:46] by art and man's device
[27:48] this is by man's device this is not
[27:52] that's inspired i don't care if the man
[27:54] was catholic or not it's inspired
[27:56] catholic men translated the bible like
[27:58] erasmus he was a
[28:00] wonderfully used by god to make the
[28:01] english bible that we
[28:03] have are so blessed to have right now
[28:05] that many women died for praise god
[28:08] god used a catholic praise god
[28:11] god can use whoever he wants right he
[28:13] can use whoever he wants
[28:15] so see that's not inspired that's
[28:18] inspired praise god because god come
[28:19] down and
[28:20] give us a cloud in the shape of a
[28:21] pyramid praise god hallelujah
[28:24] so we see and we see the bible never
[28:27] shows three
[28:27] thrones or three beings it only shows
[28:30] jesus christ
[28:32] okay now seventh they use fear tactics
[28:35] okay get your bible go to galatians 5
[28:37] 20.
[28:41] galatians 5 20. now here are the two
[28:44] fear tactics they're using
[28:48] they accuse us of heresy and they say
[28:51] we're going to hell
[28:52] and my friends didn't tell me this but
[28:54] when my trinitarian friends didn't come
[28:55] to my wedding
[28:56] i think that's the reason why because
[28:59] they don't want nothing to do with me
[29:00] because they say i'm a heretic because i
[29:01] reject their
[29:02] man-made dogma right
[29:05] what's a heretic well let's look in the
[29:06] scripture
[29:08] galatians 5 20. this is serious church
[29:11] serious
[29:14] now you know and you know church it goes
[29:15] the other way too we have just as much
[29:17] biblical right to call trinitarians
[29:19] heretics
[29:21] because they've added on words to god
[29:23] they've taken triathism and they've just
[29:25] changed one word and they got the same
[29:26] definition
[29:28] right and yes we do separate ourselves
[29:31] from them
[29:32] as we should but see the rest of their
[29:34] life proves
[29:35] that they may not inherit the kingdom of
[29:37] god because they allow adultery
[29:39] fornication homosexuality stealing
[29:42] lying all these evils that they commit
[29:44] they just let it go in the church
[29:46] instead of cleaning it out that's why
[29:47] their tables are full of vomit as we saw
[29:49] on sunday
[29:50] thank god thank god our tables are full
[29:51] of bread and wine praise god amen
[29:53] the the right communion uh symbols by
[29:56] the grace of the lord
[29:57] galatians 5 20 idolatry witchcraft
[30:01] hatred variants emulations rash strifes
[30:03] traditions
[30:04] heresies envyings murders drunkenness
[30:07] revelings and the like of which i tell
[30:08] you before as i've told
[30:09] you in time past they which do such
[30:11] things shall
[30:13] say together not inherit the kingdom of
[30:16] god
[30:17] the dominion of god they will not
[30:19] inherit it it means that means they'll
[30:21] miss the millennium
[30:23] right and they may even go to hell
[30:26] right somebody could because some of
[30:28] these people could could have been
[30:29] guilty of that right
[30:30] but they could repent at the last minute
[30:33] they could be foolish virgin but they
[30:34] won't inherit the millennium
[30:36] they have to just be raised up at the
[30:37] end of the white throne judgment
[30:39] with no reward as we saw that's what the
[30:41] bible says no reward
[30:42] you can lose all your reward right not
[30:45] not a holy ghost-filled saint now
[30:47] but the foolish virgin can lose all the
[30:49] reward
[30:50] church faint not because your work and
[30:53] labor in the lord
[30:54] is not in vain praise god and the bible
[30:59] so what is it the greek defines it as
[31:01] following their own
[31:02] teachings or tenants okay so they want
[31:06] to see any
[31:07] group that get their own things and
[31:10] cause the people to follow their
[31:11] heretics
[31:12] and they won't give up they won't
[31:14] inherit millennium
[31:15] crews they're not safe their servers are
[31:17] not born again
[31:19] not a repent of that they want to be
[31:21] said okay i'll go to uh
[31:23] the next one uh uh
[31:27] first corinthians i'm kind of first
[31:29] corinthians 11 18. yeah go to that one
[31:31] first corinthians 11 18. i didn't
[31:34] freshen up on one of these scriptures
[31:35] here billy branham calls it freshening
[31:36] up on this one
[31:38] first corinthians 11 18.
[31:47] sometimes i forget this sometimes i
[31:48] wonder why don't why do my trinitarian
[31:50] friends do that i wonder
[31:51] is it because they consider me a heretic
[31:56] verse 18 first of all when you come
[31:58] together in the church
[31:59] i hear that there be divisions on you
[32:00] and i partly believe it there must
[32:03] be also heresies among you that they
[32:05] which are approved may be made
[32:06] manifest among you
[32:10] okay so god allows heresies to spring up
[32:14] in the church
[32:15] to manifest or show who's who
[32:18] who's foolish virgin who's make believer
[32:20] who's unbeliever
[32:21] right we had that a few years ago when
[32:22] when the uh one of our precious brothers
[32:25] in christ left us they train he said can
[32:27] i come in and and bring my teachings and
[32:29] stand
[32:30] and and give a testimony for 30 minutes
[32:32] i said absolutely not you're not coming
[32:34] here
[32:34] don't even come you're not going to come
[32:36] here and spill your
[32:37] heresy that's what it was i didn't
[32:39] realize at the time but that's what it
[32:40] was
[32:41] right because they're saying keep your
[32:42] ties give your tithes to the old lady
[32:45] don't have to go to church don't eat a
[32:46] pastor the rap
[32:48] and what they believe now the rapture
[32:50] already happened that's what they
[32:50] believe that's why they were making fun
[32:52] of me on the text
[32:53] about the rapture making fun of me and
[32:54] preachers who believe in the we're going
[32:56] to meet have a meeting in the air
[32:59] right it was just so so sad mocking me
[33:02] and a group text right with some of the
[33:04] brothers it's just so sad
[33:05] that's what heretics do though they have
[33:08] their own tenants
[33:10] right and the bible says it manifests
[33:12] which side they're on
[33:14] so it shouldn't discourage us it should
[33:15] encourage us that we're in the right
[33:17] amen
[33:18] and we've got to stand up for truth
[33:20] praise god
[33:22] that's the first tactic you're a heretic
[33:24] well i can look at them and say well
[33:25] you're a heretic according to paul
[33:28] right because you're following your own
[33:30] tenant three persons is not in the bible
[33:31] you say your soul and scriptura
[33:33] but by scripture alone you don't have a
[33:35] scripture that says three persons
[33:37] you're just trying to weave it in there
[33:38] make it say that that's not what it says
[33:41] say what the bible says right hallelujah
[33:44] the second fear tact is this saying it's
[33:46] been said for a thousand years
[33:48] try to explain the trinity you'll lose
[33:50] your mind try to deny it and you'll lose
[33:52] your soul
[33:54] in other words you're going to hell if
[33:55] you don't confess to trinity nothing
[33:57] could be further than the truth god will
[34:00] not send anyone to hell
[34:02] who will not add to the word god will
[34:04] save them
[34:05] amen if you if you stand up for the word
[34:08] if you believe
[34:09] only the word that's a good sign you are
[34:11] saved amen
[34:13] see they convince try to convince people
[34:16] they use fear to try to motivate blind
[34:19] faith
[34:21] oh if you don't believe every word on
[34:23] the tape uh
[34:24] you're not the royal seed of abraham
[34:26] that's the same lying spirit
[34:29] and you know i found a quote where uh
[34:31] the son of the prophet brother
[34:32] william the son of the prophet corrects
[34:34] his dad on on a tape i just heard it
[34:37] corrects his dead yeah how can you
[34:40] correct thus saith the lord
[34:42] and guess what i saved it i saved it
[34:45] i did a screenshot and i saved him he
[34:48] corrects his dead
[34:49] because brother branham said he said i
[34:51] don't see anything hindering the coming
[34:52] of the lord
[34:53] and his son says well see he said see
[34:57] he was just looking at that day but look
[34:59] he said more time has passed
[35:02] so here we are today he said thank god
[35:04] we're still here today
[35:07] he's correcting his dad no no every word
[35:09] is thus saith the lord you can't correct
[35:10] you're dead
[35:12] how can you correct somebody who's
[35:13] infallible hello
[35:17] see they are so blocks that's what the
[35:19] that's what the that's what the
[35:20] antichrist spirit does it blinds you you
[35:23] can't even see your own sin
[35:25] you can't even see your own
[35:26] contradiction but thank god we've got
[35:28] the eyes
[35:29] out salvage the holy spirit amen we can
[35:31] see when we're wrong we can confess when
[35:33] we're wrong
[35:33] we can the holy spirit will bring it to
[35:35] our attention if we made a mistake
[35:37] because we don't want to live dishonest
[35:38] we want to be honest hallelujah
[35:41] they're so dishonest they can't even
[35:42] recognize i'm correcting the one who has
[35:44] thus saith the lord
[35:46] i got it let me see if i got it right
[35:49] here
[35:50] i won't play it yet but i'll play
[35:51] afterwards
[35:53] did i save that one if not i can play it
[36:01] no that's not it i i didn't save it so i
[36:04] will say that
[36:04] oh yeah i saved the screenshot yeah
[36:06] there's a screenshot
[36:08] so i got this sermon saved i saved the
[36:09] link to it i saved the link
[36:11] but i can play at the end just bear with
[36:12] me here okay good all right all right
[36:16] yeah it's amazing i'm just driving the
[36:18] car i'm like what he just corrected his
[36:19] debt and i was washing dishes that's
[36:20] what i was
[36:21] he's just how can he correct his dad he
[36:23] can't do that
[36:24] every word is thus saith the lord but
[36:26] that's what you do when you uh
[36:29] have false doctrine the bible said
[36:30] you're entrapped you're ensnared
[36:33] they're in their own they're in the
[36:34] snare of satan taken by him at his own
[36:36] will
[36:37] because they gave into his will right
[36:40] if they wanted to they could kick that
[36:41] devil out of the house and say this is
[36:44] my house
[36:44] but devil's come in he's stolen the
[36:46] goods he's stolen the sincerity he's
[36:48] stolen the truth praise god
[36:51] he's stolen the right he's the rightly
[36:52] divided word from these people
[36:54] and now they're caught in these snares
[36:56] they don't even realize they're
[36:57] uh contradicting their own beliefs
[37:01] see church and this is the thing with
[37:03] the trinity you and i we don't deny
[37:05] anything the bible says about the father
[37:07] son and holy ghost
[37:08] we believe all of it praise god we just
[37:11] deny the lies on the creeds amen
[37:14] we just deny their creed documents and
[37:17] their uh
[37:18] their councils and all the trash like
[37:20] that
[37:21] we don't deny one thing the bible says
[37:23] about the godhead
[37:26] so we have no fear of going to hell amen
[37:29] the bible said salvation is a free gift
[37:31] and i accepted it amen
[37:33] it's a free it was a free gift i just
[37:36] have to believe
[37:36] and i believe jesus christ is the son of
[37:38] god and i believe he died
[37:40] for my sins and i believe by his stripes
[37:43] i'm healed amen
[37:44] and i'm on my way to heaven shouting the
[37:46] victory hallelujah
[37:48] i've got victory in jesus amen
[37:54] thank the lord and my last and eighth
[37:59] evidence was brother branham cain with
[38:01] thus saith the lord
[38:02] trinitarianism is of the devil
[38:08] what a thought my
[38:11] okay um
[38:15] yes okay uh i'm at 30
[38:21] okay i got 12 more minutes and then
[38:22] we'll at 45 i'll cut it off and i'll
[38:24] show you a few videos okay
[38:25] i'll show you that i've been preaching
[38:28] real hard and my voice hurts i was gonna
[38:30] try not to preach so hard tonight here
[38:31] so
[38:32] you know how that goes i'm just trying
[38:33] to be uh take care of myself over time
[38:36] school is coming up you know we'll be
[38:37] working pretty soon
[38:39] now as i close here give me a few
[38:42] minutes of closure and then we'll watch
[38:43] some videos
[38:44] i want to prove it to you just so you
[38:45] can see it this trinity is getting more
[38:48] serious all the time like the more i
[38:49] watch people
[38:50] like preachers on youtube whatever the
[38:52] more the trinitarian preachers condemn
[38:54] us or anyone for saying god's on a
[38:56] trinity right it's got to get
[38:58] more more pressure right it's got to be
[39:01] more
[39:02] trinity's the way truth is away turn his
[39:04] way look what brother manson
[39:05] all the people have to belong to the
[39:07] world church system or be at the mercy
[39:08] of the elements where they cannot buy or
[39:09] sell without the mark of the beast
[39:11] in the hand or in the head
[39:14] now do you see that with new york this
[39:16] week they just announced if you don't
[39:17] have the covered papers
[39:19] you can't get into a restaurant that's
[39:22] new york city
[39:23] that's going to it's going to start in a
[39:24] couple weeks i think like that
[39:26] look now look that's discrimination
[39:29] right we're going back
[39:31] to the ways that we abolish we're going
[39:32] back to that now it's just
[39:33] discrimination
[39:34] of a vaccine that don't even work
[39:38] right they say you get the vaccine put
[39:40] on a mask yet they're letting
[39:41] 200 000 immigrants have come in just
[39:43] this month
[39:44] or last month rather july and most of
[39:46] them got covered
[39:47] they're saying you wear a mess kid
[39:49] you're five years old wear a mask
[39:51] we'll let 200 000 people with kovid come
[39:54] in bunch of devils
[39:55] they're a bunch of liars a bunch of
[39:57] hypocrites is what they are
[39:59] it's all about power they just want to
[40:01] keep their power right
[40:02] the reason they're letting them in is
[40:04] because they're losing all the voters
[40:06] nobody wants to vote for democrats
[40:07] anymore because they're a bunch of liars
[40:11] defund the police right
[40:14] the green new green deal stop using
[40:17] gasoline and
[40:18] yeah and fuel and yet they're the ones
[40:20] flying around the world in the planes
[40:23] i mean these
[40:26] it's just total insanity these people
[40:27] are totally insane but see we're
[40:30] starting to see it right we're starting
[40:31] to see
[40:31] this is getting closer now i'm going to
[40:34] show you a video
[40:35] where that january 6 commission last
[40:36] week they specifically
[40:38] called these insurrectionists christians
[40:42] specifically
[40:45] to see how they're starting to connect
[40:47] because they're church they're all
[40:48] catholics
[40:48] they're not christians they're all
[40:50] catholics and where the catholics
[40:52] what's their main thing trinity father
[40:55] son holy ghost whatever they do there
[40:56] they can't bless themselves god won't
[40:58] bless them for that the only way they
[40:59] get blessed is to stop being cursed
[41:01] but they're not going to stop being
[41:02] cursed they're going to keep sinning
[41:03] they're going to keep doing all that
[41:04] wickedness
[41:06] right but that's why i was so moved last
[41:08] week just
[41:09] sad and frustrated this mark in the head
[41:13] means they will have to take
[41:14] the doctrine of the world church system
[41:17] which is
[41:18] what's the what's the one doctor brother
[41:20] branham feels led to mention here
[41:21] the one thing what could it be speaking
[41:23] in tongues the evidence no
[41:25] no trinity because that's the mother's
[41:28] favorite
[41:29] that's what she started back way back
[41:31] when so she could break that
[41:33] first commandment right now she can
[41:36] start having multiple gods multiple
[41:38] persons and church remember
[41:39] mary is higher than the son because mary
[41:42] is the mother
[41:43] of god mother of god
[41:47] and that pope francis said it church i
[41:48] don't know if you've seen it but uh last
[41:50] year
[41:50] pope francis said it he said we fly to
[41:53] mary because we know
[41:54] uh jesus won't turn down his mother
[41:59] so that's why we fly to mary in prayer
[42:01] and they say that's what that's what the
[42:02] catechism says
[42:03] fly to the mother that's why they pray
[42:04] to mary more than jesus
[42:07] you know it just proves they don't know
[42:09] jesus see i know jesus
[42:12] i don't know mary but i know jesus paul
[42:14] said we don't know jesus after the flesh
[42:16] anymore
[42:17] we know him after the spirit praise god
[42:19] so that's why we feel comfortable
[42:20] praying to jesus amen
[42:22] and not to marry i don't think jesus
[42:24] said he is the father he is the way the
[42:26] truth and the life hallelujah
[42:28] he said the comforter will come in my
[42:29] name and he'll speak he'll bring
[42:31] everything that i said
[42:32] to your remembrance hallelujah that's
[42:36] why we don't pray to mary
[42:38] she can't help us but see they've
[42:40] exalted mary said look that
[42:43] no other guys before me right there it
[42:44] is right there now mary's above the
[42:46] trinity
[42:48] no other gods before me look at that
[42:49] just caught it right there
[42:52] no other gods and they're the god mary
[42:56] which pope was it um i think it was pope
[43:00] john ii he dedicated his entire
[43:03] pontificate
[43:05] to mary so they have like a pope robe
[43:09] that they wear and it has like
[43:10] inscriptions on it
[43:11] his head something like i'm in mary's
[43:13] hands or i'm mary's servant
[43:15] that was the one a couple popes ago like
[43:17] three popes ago or two pups ago
[43:20] benedict and then pope john paul ii yeah
[43:23] so two popes to go
[43:27] and his whole i saw the video i wish i
[43:28] would have saved it now but i could find
[43:30] it
[43:30] his whole thing was i'm all about mary
[43:32] i'm i'm mary's child basically i'm
[43:34] married servant
[43:35] i'm mary slave paul now
[43:38] interesting he's named pope john paul
[43:41] but paul said i'm a prisoner of christ
[43:43] not a prisoner of mary
[43:47] they're such contradictory liars amen
[43:49] that's what they are
[43:51] but the holy ghost don't lie the holy
[43:52] ghost always tells the truth praise god
[43:54] and we are prisoners of jesus christ
[43:56] amen
[43:58] hallelujah
[44:01] so the mark in the forehead is going to
[44:03] be trinitarianism
[44:07] etc i wonder what other doctrines
[44:08] they'll use
[44:11] probably women can preach right
[44:12] catholics are almost getting to the spot
[44:14] where women can be priests almost
[44:16] they're almost there that's interesting
[44:19] but they're almost there
[44:21] trinitarianism what else you know oh
[44:23] eternal hell that's one of them for sure
[44:25] they all believe in eternal hell how is
[44:27] god gonna con
[44:29] eternally torment somebody for 15 years
[44:32] of sin
[44:32] a 15 year old boy or elvis 50 he died
[44:36] when he's 56
[44:37] how could god torment him for eternity
[44:40] for only 56 years of sin
[44:42] that's true and unusual punishment god
[44:45] is way more merciful than that
[44:49] the bible said they're made to be taken
[44:51] and destroyed
[44:53] destroyed so no more it's going to go
[44:55] back to the beginning when there was no
[44:56] evil
[44:57] hallelujah it's got to go back all the
[44:59] way back to purity praise god
[45:01] all the way back to the beginning
[45:03] where's all holiness
[45:04] god in his thoughts praise god that's
[45:06] you and i the thoughts of god express
[45:08] amen having fellowship with god amen
[45:14] the mark in the hand means do what the
[45:17] church says
[45:19] with this great power the church systems
[45:21] will persecute the true bride
[45:23] we don't know to what extent right it
[45:25] may differ there's already persecution
[45:26] all around the world for christians
[45:28] we don't know to what extent it'll be we
[45:30] want to be ready and we know the
[45:32] anointing will be there when we need it
[45:34] god's anointing is always there when he
[45:36] needs it whenever he's fulfilling his
[45:37] word
[45:37] he always sends the anointing he
[45:39] prepares the people praise god
[45:40] he'll drive us to that amen or shall i
[45:43] say like this is a leader he'll lead us
[45:45] to it because the bible said we're like
[45:46] lambs delivered every day for the
[45:48] slaughter we're already
[45:49] trying to die every day he's already
[45:51] leading us to self-crucifixion in our
[45:53] wills every day
[45:56] so see that's why i want to close it
[45:57] last week i just forgot but i want to
[45:59] bring that up to your attention here
[46:01] that this is the main thing so satan
[46:03] says i'm going to put a mark on those
[46:04] message believers
[46:05] i got to make them believe the trinity
[46:08] now look now oh yeah the next one look
[46:10] at the next one brother brandon said
[46:12] did i get that up there okay no this is
[46:14] the same one this image will try to keep
[46:15] the bride from preaching and teaching
[46:17] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[46:18] comfort and truth to the people who need
[46:20] it but before the antichrist in person
[46:22] takes over this complete world system of
[46:23] churches
[46:24] the true church will be taken away from
[46:25] this world to be with the lord god will
[46:27] snatch away his bride from the great
[46:28] marriage supper of the lamb
[46:30] amen that fits all the types
[46:33] right esther i mean you could find all
[46:35] the types i preached on i think
[46:36] there's eight types of the bride all the
[46:39] types
[46:40] all fit before destruction before evil
[46:42] god always delivers the woman
[46:45] rahab right we can start going through
[46:46] some of these god always delivers it now
[46:51] let me pull up the app here
[46:59] here's what i want to say the pressure
[47:03] does say it the lord he said you think
[47:05] them nominations ever break up their
[47:06] denomination
[47:08] and come back to the word it's thus
[47:10] saith the lord
[47:12] they won't
[47:15] sorry i didn't have time to get this one
[47:16] here so it's it's uh anointed when's the
[47:18] end times i got that one memorized i've
[47:19] used it so many times
[47:20] yeah it's predicted that they're going
[47:22] to do it and they're going to do it for
[47:23] it's thus saith the lord
[47:26] oh now i lost it come on man
[47:31] oh and now what's going on here okay
[47:35] i'm just i'm just not good with the app
[47:38] sorry they're going to do it it's thus
[47:41] saith the lord they're going to do it
[47:42] you think them nominations will ever
[47:43] break up their denomination come back to
[47:45] the word
[47:45] it's thus saith the lord they won't
[47:49] they'll go will they go to the
[47:50] antichrist exactly it's thus saith the
[47:52] lord they will
[47:54] so why are you saying about it i have to
[47:55] be a witness and so do you so the point
[47:57] i'm making is right now
[47:58] seventh-day adventists and jehovah's
[48:00] witnesses they're cults right
[48:02] but they still believe god's not a
[48:04] trinity
[48:05] now according to this it's thus saith
[48:07] the lord they're gonna just give up on
[48:08] the
[48:09] well it's okay trinity's okay
[48:13] when the pressure comes down you either
[48:16] die i'm taking your money you can't eat
[48:20] i'm taking your work you either die or
[48:22] you accept the trinity oh they'll say
[48:23] okay trinity's okay
[48:24] we're we're brothers yeah brothers of
[48:27] satan
[48:28] right children of hell so it's even
[48:31] going to make such staunch
[48:33] witnessing people right like the
[48:35] jehovah's witnesses are known for
[48:36] witnessing door to door
[48:38] it's even going to make them uh give up
[48:41] this so-called thing now church see
[48:42] that's what we got we have to have rock
[48:43] solid faith
[48:44] we got to have revelation that cannot be
[48:46] moved now no matter what temptation
[48:49] comes
[48:49] we are going to stay with thus saith the
[48:51] lord the bible
[48:54] see like i said whether it comes in my
[48:55] generation my children or grandchildren
[48:57] or
[48:57] the lord terry you know whatever happens
[48:59] whenever this comes down and it's going
[49:01] to do it it's going to come down
[49:02] to persecution right eventually in
[49:03] america it's not saint the lord i'll
[49:04] show that quote next
[49:07] it's going to come down to this you've
[49:08] got to believe our train you got to eat
[49:09] our bread
[49:11] i'm not eating wiggle tail bread i'm not
[49:13] going to eat vomit covered bread who
[49:15] would eat vomit covered bread i'm not
[49:16] going to try to get gross tonight but
[49:18] who in their right mind would eat them
[49:19] but that's there that's what they're
[49:20] saying you either die
[49:21] or come and eat at our vomit covered
[49:23] table we'll take none of it praise god
[49:25] i like what brother said martin luther
[49:27] took that table the kosher and he threw
[49:29] over the table well that's what we would
[49:30] do before the rapture
[49:32] we'd throw over their table and say
[49:33] we're not eating your trash we'll stand
[49:35] with jesus and then jesus comes and
[49:37] snatches us away praise god
[49:39] before they can pull carry out their
