[0:30] he's like i was just struggling with the
[0:32] message
[0:33] you know all these questions about the
[0:34] message people leaving the message and
[0:36] then he said i watched your sermon on
[0:37] sunday morning
[0:39] a sunday morning message about
[0:40] colossians and he said it totally gave
[0:43] me victory over my battle so i just said
[0:45] praise the lord amen i said me too
[0:48] oh it's a
[0:49] combination of all the all the blessings
[0:51] and victories god gives us praise god so
[0:53] i just want to encourage you with that
[0:55] let's go to
[0:57] hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. i like to
[0:59] look at the power of the apostles
[1:01] doctrine again
[1:02] and continue to talk about or preach on
[1:05] some scriptures and of course talk about
[1:06] them
[1:09] i'll read
[1:10] hebrews six one through three
[1:14] and if i uh if i have a little time at
[1:15] the end i'd like to preach just a few
[1:17] verses about
[1:18] uh denominational systems like austin
[1:21] and lena and faith and i were talking
[1:23] about on the way here might be good just
[1:25] to preach some of those if we have a few
[1:27] minutes you know kind of see how that
[1:29] goes so hebrews 6 verse 1.
[1:33] hebrews 6 1.
[1:40] i'm gonna get my place here
[1:48] let's all read verse one together okay
[1:50] and then i'll read two and three because
[1:51] it's a little bit long there
[1:53] hebrews 6 1. let's just read verse one
[1:56] together ready one two three
[1:58] therefore leaving the principles of the
[2:01] doctrine of christ let us go on unto
[2:05] perfection
[2:06] not laying again the foundation of
[2:09] repentance from good works and of faith
[2:12] toward god now let me read verse two
[2:15] myself of the doctrine of baptism so see
[2:17] there's two different kinds of baptisms
[2:19] right
[2:20] and of the laying on of hands and of the
[2:22] resurrection of the dead
[2:24] and of eternal judgment actually let's
[2:27] all read verse three can we one two
[2:29] three and this will we do
[2:31] if god permit if god permit
[2:35] we will move on from elementary
[2:37] teachings or or uh beginning christian
[2:40] doctrines and we'll move on to the more
[2:42] mature ones if god will permit
[2:44] praise god let's have a word of prayer
[2:46] let's ask the lord to bless our
[2:47] preaching here
[2:49] give us understanding and revelation and
[2:50] wisdom
[2:52] heavenly father we just bow our heads
[2:53] again we're thankful lord to sing these
[2:55] songs we're so glad that we'll be in
[2:57] that number when the saints go marching
[2:58] in lord i believe that you've indicated
[3:00] in each one of our hearts lord god and
[3:02] we're so grateful and lord in fact the
[3:04] longer i serve you lord the more i'm
[3:05] convinced i'm going to be in that number
[3:07] lord not because of me but because of
[3:09] your everlasting grace lord god your
[3:11] mercy renews every morning lord you
[3:14] guide me into all truth you keep me from
[3:15] evil lord you you're so gracious you you
[3:18] give us testimonies you use our bodies
[3:20] you use our lips and our minds to bless
[3:22] people in akron and around the world
[3:24] lord you're so gracious and so merciful
[3:26] and so we just want to say we love you
[3:27] tonight lord bless us as we minister
[3:29] your word lord anoint me anoint your
[3:31] people each one of us god may we feel
[3:33] your presence lord may we receive lord
[3:36] the revelation of the holy ghost tonight
[3:37] god that will give us
[3:39] grace lord strengthen the time of need
[3:41] lord god that will give us victory lord
[3:43] in this hour we know you are an
[3:45] ever-present help lord god to all those
[3:47] who are in need so lord we're in need of
[3:49] your help lord maybe not physically lord
[3:51] but maybe spiritually no doubt lord god
[3:54] so let your holy spirit be a shield
[3:56] around us let it be a buckler lord
[3:59] let it be a hedge about us i pray as we
[4:01] uh settle in here lord and hear the word
[4:03] of god annoying each one in jesus
[4:05] christ's name and everybody said
[4:06] amen god bless you as you being seen and
[4:08] praise god
[4:12] so we'll look at part four of the power
[4:14] of the apostles doctrine i do have some
[4:16] slides here i'd like to um
[4:20] just kind of keep us uh
[4:22] you know
[4:23] on uh the nice track here to
[4:26] to preach these scriptures here and this
[4:28] thought about the power of the apostles
[4:30] doctrine so the apostles basically had
[4:32] jesus's doctrine and they were filled
[4:34] with jesus's spirit
[4:36] and we saw they went away they went
[4:37] around doing miracles signs and wonders
[4:39] but we also saw how they filled all
[4:42] jerusalem with their doctrine and jesus
[4:45] said go into all the world and teach the
[4:46] gospel to every creature right every
[4:49] nation so you have to have both praise
[4:51] god you have to have both power and
[4:54] doctrine praise god so we're thankful
[4:56] for all that god is doing praise god and
[4:58] and uh let's look at this thought of
[5:00] mastering
[5:02] elementary doctrines in hebrews 6. now
[5:05] if you have your bibles
[5:06] go back up to uh verse 10 of chapter
[5:09] five so go to the previous chapter
[5:12] and verse 10. so hebrews 5 verse 10.
[5:16] just to kind of give us this this is a
[5:17] scripture i referenced often throughout
[5:19] the years
[5:21] it gives you a good understanding here
[5:23] about what is a mature believer like
[5:25] what kind of life do they live
[5:28] okay so leading up to what we read is
[5:30] chapter 5 verse 10 says
[5:32] called of god and high priest after the
[5:34] order of melchizedek this speaking of
[5:35] jesus christ he's in a high priest a
[5:39] relationship with us right now in other
[5:41] words he's making the intercession for
[5:43] our prayers
[5:44] to god the invisible god
[5:46] so aren't you glad church you have a
[5:48] high priest in heaven he intercedes for
[5:50] your prayers he's the one that hears
[5:52] your prayers and then he intercedes to
[5:54] the invisible father amen
[5:57] and now verse 11. now here where we get
[5:58] into some real rebukes the author of the
[6:01] book is rebuking the hebrew church here
[6:04] verse 11 of whom we have many things to
[6:06] say speaking of christ right
[6:08] and hard to be uttered so it's hard to
[6:09] speak these things seeing you are dull
[6:11] of hearing so the writer's actually
[6:13] saying your ears aren't very sharp to
[6:16] hearing
[6:17] revelations right he said the writer's
[6:20] saying i know you can't receive a lot of
[6:22] deep teachings
[6:23] how would how do you like if somebody
[6:25] came in here and said we're you're just
[6:26] a baby church and you can't receive many
[6:28] deep teachings i'd feel bad
[6:30] i'd feel awful but i feel like we're a
[6:32] mature church praise god we can receive
[6:34] the deeper teachings of the bible praise
[6:36] god we can go beyond you know just being
[6:38] saved and being loving and being kind
[6:41] and uh being a good christian we can go
[6:43] down that to the deeper things of god we
[6:45] can start lord by god's grace finding
[6:48] the perfect will of god for our lives
[6:50] praise god we can learn how to uh we can
[6:52] learn how to pray we can learn how to
[6:54] overcome we can learn how to intercede
[6:56] for others praise god amen we can learn
[6:59] how our gifts operate we can learn the
[7:01] perfect will where god wants us to be on
[7:03] the job or where god wants us to be in
[7:04] the home we can learn that and know for
[7:07] sure and we can live so close to god
[7:09] i'll say like this that no man could
[7:11] deceive us
[7:12] amen like my dad taught me years ago my
[7:14] dad backslid but he did teach me the
[7:16] greatest lesson in my life he said know
[7:18] jesus christ so well that no man can
[7:20] deceive you that's never left me since
[7:23] i've been 9 or 10 or 11 that that lesson
[7:25] has never left me and that's what i've
[7:26] sought to do i've sought to know the
[7:28] word and i'm not perfect of course but i
[7:30] want to know the bible know the word so
[7:32] well that no preacher or no man in
[7:34] general no woman can deceive me but i
[7:36] will have the holy spirit inside of me
[7:39] to tell me what is the truth to keep
[7:41] that to hold fast that which is good and
[7:43] then reject anything that's not in the
[7:46] holy scripture amen
[7:48] now verse 12
[7:50] he says this church is a dull of hearing
[7:51] they don't hear the word really well
[7:53] verse 12
[7:55] for when for the time you ought to be
[7:58] teachers so you ought to be so mature
[7:59] you could teach others he says you have
[8:02] need that one teach you again which be
[8:04] the first principles of the oracles of
[8:06] god
[8:08] okay he said so you've been a long or
[8:10] you've been around long enough you
[8:11] should be able to teach other people but
[8:13] he says you can't
[8:15] all right so see think of think of our
[8:16] lives what could we teach somebody what
[8:18] has god showed us that we could teach
[8:20] others hopefully there's a lot praise
[8:22] god amen hopefully if somebody asks you
[8:24] a certain question about a certain thing
[8:26] you know could you teach them about it
[8:28] could you teach them about you know
[8:29] prayer or fasting or reading the bible
[8:31] or the seven seals or the seven church
[8:33] ages or how to raise your children could
[8:36] you teach them about that amen
[8:38] hallelujah
[8:40] these are all things we should learn and
[8:42] grow and become
[8:43] more mature and praise god
[8:45] and then he says finishing the verse he
[8:47] says
[8:49] uh you are i'm sorry you have need that
[8:51] one teach you again which be the first
[8:53] principles of the oracles of god imagine
[8:56] that you were around so long
[8:58] you're around so long and you get so
[9:00] lazy on god that you forget the very
[9:01] first things
[9:03] can you imagine that's what this church
[9:05] had come to
[9:06] and he said i can't teach you many deep
[9:07] things because you've forgotten the very
[9:10] beginning points
[9:11] praise god
[9:13] now look what he compares he compares it
[9:14] to a baby like little hannah
[9:18] he says and and are become such as have
[9:20] need of milk and not of strong meat i
[9:22] doubt hannah's feasting on uh chipotle
[9:25] you know
[9:26] on the on the sundays
[9:27] or you know a chicken or a steak you
[9:29] know
[9:30] and so that's what paul's comparing the
[9:32] church is like a baby church
[9:36] they can't preach them a lot of deep
[9:38] things praise god gonna teach them uh
[9:40] the simple things and he's gonna talk
[9:42] about these later as we read for our
[9:44] text
[9:45] so people can do that they can hang
[9:47] around church a while but if they don't
[9:48] keep learning if they don't put into
[9:50] practice what they've learned they
[9:52] become dull of hearing they become
[9:54] they become less spiritual and they
[9:56] actually forget the very principles of
[9:58] christianity
[9:59] we're not going to be that church amen
[10:01] we're going to be a mature church that
[10:03] grows in grace and knowledge of god amen
[10:05] the bible says we're going to grow from
[10:07] faith to faith from glory to glory amen
[10:10] from revelation to revelation amen
[10:12] that's how we're going to grow praise
[10:14] god we're not going to backslide on god
[10:16] and get bored with god and forget what
[10:19] god has taught us we're going to
[10:20] remember what god taught us amen
[10:23] verse 13 for everyone that uses milk
[10:25] okay or elementary the first teachings
[10:28] is unskillful in the word of
[10:30] righteousness for he's a babe so if a
[10:32] preacher just preaches milk all the time
[10:34] and i've been to those churches i'm not
[10:35] i'm not condemning them necessarily
[10:38] but you've been in churches where
[10:40] the pastors preached is the same thing
[10:41] it sounds like the same thing over and
[10:43] over now if you're in a series with me
[10:44] yes i'm going to say a lot of the same
[10:45] things over and over but each time i
[10:47] should add some new things
[10:48] but if you go to church it's just the
[10:50] same thing over and over year after year
[10:52] month after month then you know that
[10:54] preacher is a baby
[10:55] he has stopped feeding on the things of
[10:58] god he can't handle the deep things of
[11:00] god anymore
[11:01] i'm glad when i come in the message
[11:02] brothers i'm glad a lot of things went
[11:04] over my head that shows that that church
[11:06] was not a milk church
[11:08] hallelujah
[11:10] amen
[11:11] right
[11:13] and so we see that we want to be a
[11:14] church where
[11:16] we grow in our understanding we can
[11:18] handle more of the word now no doubt you
[11:20] can handle longer sermons right so thank
[11:22] you for that
[11:23] but hopefully those sermons have more
[11:25] meat in them too praise god
[11:27] like sunday amen
[11:29] you know understanding about the book of
[11:31] colossians in our lives and how that
[11:32] i've never heard that preach before that
[11:33] was i just saw it on the video wow
[11:35] that's great history and tied in like
[11:37] that that was just to me it was just
[11:38] beautiful to me i needed that right we
[11:40] need that for that that moment we need
[11:42] it and the holy spirit gives us what we
[11:44] have need for that moment but these ones
[11:46] were babes they forgotten the very
[11:49] initial things
[11:51] right
[11:52] so like for example uh
[11:55] if somebody come up to they want to be
[11:56] baptized which one of you could just
[11:58] walk them through now not not even even
[11:59] the sisters not even not even being a
[12:01] preacher but just saying well here's
[12:02] what you could do
[12:04] i mean could we all explain that you
[12:06] know
[12:07] that's what it's like we'd have to be
[12:08] ready to understand the main principles
[12:11] right or the early foundational
[12:14] principles how can you even get saved
[12:16] right how can i how can i find the
[12:19] perfect will of god who could explain
[12:20] that you know
[12:21] hopefully we can all explain it by god's
[12:23] grace how do you find the perfect will
[12:24] of god
[12:25] how do you begin to please god how do
[12:27] you live a christian life you know just
[12:29] these early simple questions we've got
[12:31] to grow be we have to learn that but
[12:33] then we have to grow beyond that and
[12:34] also be ready to teach other people too
[12:37] amen
[12:40] and that's you know parents is built
[12:41] into your job description right so
[12:43] your whole life teaches your children
[12:45] and so that's a good thing about
[12:46] parenting you're constantly teaching
[12:48] you're constantly learning and you're
[12:50] constantly modeling whether how much you
[12:51] say it or not you're modeling how to
[12:53] live a life and you're teaching your
[12:54] children nonetheless
[12:56] right
[12:57] now verse 14 this is the scripture i've
[12:59] loved and i've mentioned for many years
[13:02] but strong meat
[13:04] so churches that can handle steak
[13:06] preaching right
[13:08] belong to them that are of full age
[13:11] so you got to be mature to handle the
[13:12] meat of the word
[13:14] even those who by reason of use have
[13:16] their senses exercised
[13:18] to discern both good and evil
[13:21] so a mature christian is one who they
[13:23] get stronger each service amen
[13:27] they get spirits they grow each service
[13:29] amen hallelujah praise god and they're
[13:31] able by the holy spirit to detect am i
[13:34] growing closer and they know i'm growing
[13:36] closer to god and i'm not growing
[13:37] farther from god
[13:39] i can handle more of the word than i
[13:41] have before
[13:43] praise god now that's what i love about
[13:45] making youtube videos because i'm
[13:46] challenged constantly because if i
[13:48] hadn't made a video about it then maybe
[13:49] i can't explain it very well
[13:51] so i'm challenged constantly because i
[13:53] gotta explain in a way that anybody can
[13:55] receive it
[13:56] right it's a real challenge come up with
[13:58] a new topic every couple weeks you know
[14:00] we really got to study it so i know i
[14:02] like that
[14:03] it's not for popularity it's not for
[14:05] money but i do it because i know people
[14:07] need it it helps me but it also helps
[14:09] the people too
[14:11] and the bible says we should always have
[14:12] an answer ready for the reason of the
[14:15] hope that we have within us amen the
[14:17] bible tells us always have an answer
[14:19] ready
[14:22] and so
[14:23] mature christians they keep they feed
[14:25] they feed on the word of god every
[14:27] service they get stronger and they're
[14:29] able to detect the devil more often
[14:32] right we should we should drop
[14:34] throughout the day we should detect when
[14:36] the enemy's bringing in a temptation
[14:38] right we should be able to detect that
[14:40] you know in the in the in the comic
[14:41] world spiderman had a spidey sense you
[14:44] remember that
[14:45] he could like detect at the last moment
[14:46] oh that green goblin's coming around
[14:47] you're not that's cause i'm i used to
[14:49] watch that when i was a kid well that's
[14:50] how the holy spirit is right we get a
[14:52] sense as we get more mature we can sense
[14:55] when the devil or something's not right
[14:56] here this
[14:57] uh that
[14:58] like you hear so you'll sometimes hear a
[15:00] preacher and then they'll say something
[15:01] oh no that was wrong
[15:03] it just it's brother i'm calling like a
[15:05] buzzer inside of you praise god a buzzer
[15:07] goes off
[15:08] like you know something's wrong with
[15:10] that
[15:11] and as you become a christian glory that
[15:13] buzzer should get louder amen hallelujah
[15:15] praise god thank you jesus amen it
[15:18] should get loud you should be able to
[15:19] start detecting
[15:21] when it's right and when it's wrong
[15:23] praise god
[15:25] now with this background that's where we
[15:27] get to our text there tonight
[15:29] okay so we must master elementary
[15:31] doctrines and be able to teach others
[15:34] about it as well
[15:35] praise god
[15:37] like i i'm sorry army mercy forgive me
[15:40] i didn't even eat really before church
[15:43] forgive me but a brother emailed me this
[15:45] week and he said how can i redeem the
[15:47] time i see you talking about being a
[15:48] wise virgin and how does the wise
[15:50] version redeem the time and so i explain
[15:51] why i gotta get up two and a half hours
[15:53] before my kids get up
[15:55] so i can have time with the lord myself
[15:57] i said in that two and a half hours i'll
[15:58] study i'll pray i'll read my bible i'll
[16:01] prepare sermons or youtube videos i'll
[16:02] pay the bills
[16:04] i'll return emails
[16:07] that's the only way i can do it
[16:08] you know that's i gotta i gotta make the
[16:11] most of that time
[16:12] praise god if i get a little tired by
[16:13] the end of the day that's a that's a
[16:15] small sacrifice to have that time
[16:16] that's quiet in the lord one-on-one with
[16:18] the lord in the morning praise god
[16:20] that's a small sacrifice right
[16:23] and i'm just saying you know you got to
[16:24] go to you got to go to lengths if you
[16:26] want a closer walk with god you've got
[16:28] to go to greater lengths to get there
[16:29] praise god
[16:31] right
[16:32] we all know insanity's doing the same
[16:34] thing over and over again expecting
[16:35] different results
[16:37] we all they say that in education they
[16:38] say that sports like
[16:41] if you do the same thing you're just
[16:42] going to get the same results
[16:44] but you got to do something if you want
[16:45] more of god you got to do something more
[16:47] praise god
[16:49] okay and i'm not saying you know we're
[16:50] not getting into legalism or anything
[16:52] like that but we're getting in a way
[16:53] where how can we continually grow as a
[16:55] christian
[16:57] and the way to do it like we were saying
[16:58] you have to die to yourself every day
[17:01] you have to say i'm not going to live
[17:02] for myself today i'm not going to live
[17:03] live to the lust of my eyes the lust of
[17:06] my flesh or the pride of life i'm going
[17:08] to live for the holy spirit today praise
[17:10] god
[17:11] i'm going to crucify my desires and i'm
[17:13] going to do what i know the lord desires
[17:15] because the bible tells me what the lord
[17:17] desires amen
[17:19] the lord desires that you seek him first
[17:22] the lord desires that you seek his
[17:24] righteousness first amen you seek his
[17:26] righteousness you seek his kingdom you
[17:28] seek you seek that and if you do that
[17:30] god will take care of everything else
[17:32] amen
[17:33] hallelujah first things first
[17:35] holy that's a good song there first
[17:36] things first
[17:39] we seek god first because of his worth
[17:41] right his worth he's the most worthy
[17:43] thing he's he's the most important thing
[17:45] the greatest thing we can invest our
[17:46] time into is the holy spirit praise god
[17:48] god's word
[17:49] and so we seek god first and then
[17:51] everything else works out how many can
[17:52] say amen to that
[17:54] you see god first everything else will
[17:56] work out it always does praise god
[17:59] now that's that's for a mature christian
[18:01] you have to discern
[18:02] good and evil in your life amen
[18:08] discerning good and evil like jesus did
[18:09] it all the time people come up and ask
[18:11] him questions he bug
[18:13] you're not asking that
[18:14] yeah he said you're not asking that he
[18:16] said you're reasoning in your heart he
[18:18] would just he would just discern them
[18:19] right away
[18:21] he said he said good master uh teaches
[18:23] the greatest commandment he said why you
[18:24] call me good there's only one good
[18:26] he could detect that spirit of
[18:29] flattering right
[18:30] he could detect that he could detect
[18:32] their tricks they said by what authority
[18:34] do this he said let me ask you by what
[18:36] authority was john's baptism right
[18:38] he could detect that he could sense that
[18:41] evil praise god
[18:43] and i had a i had another interaction
[18:45] since i'll just since i've been talking
[18:47] about it on youtube where somebody said
[18:49] you're under a deceiving spirit
[18:51] because you did this and that and i
[18:52] wrote back i said no i said i explained
[18:54] the whole situation i said no you didn't
[18:56] know this this this that i said and i
[18:58] said you're under a impatient spirit and
[19:01] he said you're right
[19:03] hallelujah
[19:04] see when somebody doesn't know things
[19:06] for a week or two weeks in this case the
[19:08] brother didn't know three weeks he
[19:10] didn't know all these things that were
[19:11] happening and then he accused me because
[19:13] i didn't respond in three weeks you're
[19:14] under a spirit of deception i said no
[19:16] i'm not
[19:17] second i can i can discern that
[19:20] i know the truth amen
[19:22] and then i could call out his spirit and
[19:25] recognize he and he said pray for me i
[19:27] do need more patience
[19:29] amen i didn't pray for him just a simple
[19:31] prayer
[19:32] just something like that like you can
[19:34] detect when someone
[19:35] you can do it you can detect when
[19:36] somebody's trying to criticize you and
[19:38] it's unfair
[19:40] amen
[19:41] now maybe you wouldn't have been able to
[19:43] do that earlier in your christian
[19:44] journey but now you can detect when
[19:46] they're criticized now here's the hard
[19:48] one when they're flattering you
[19:50] that's the hard one
[19:52] when you're like oh you're just the best
[19:53] pastor you're the best preacher be very
[19:55] careful with that
[19:57] that can be the devil the bible says
[19:59] flattery worketh ruin
[20:01] that's what that's the book of proverbs
[20:03] says so be careful it's easy to detect
[20:05] the criticizing one because none of us
[20:07] like criticism right i don't like it
[20:10] it's not easy
[20:11] but the flattery's the tough part
[20:14] when they're flattering in order to move
[20:16] you to do something for their own
[20:18] selfish desires
[20:20] right they're flattering you
[20:22] that's what he said oh good master jesus
[20:24] good master
[20:26] he said who's there's none good but god
[20:28] he can detect that in there
[20:31] so let's be careful church what we
[20:32] receive all the time let's be careful
[20:34] who's complimenting us be careful not to
[20:36] be deceived by other people
[20:39] praise god
[20:42] because church what i found is a lot of
[20:43] people that even left this church in
[20:45] other churches what they're after is
[20:46] power they want power and influence
[20:50] like one person left because uh
[20:53] they were a deacon one person left our
[20:54] church years ago uh and they're a deacon
[20:57] and one time i was out
[20:59] i think i was sick or something like
[21:00] that and our bylaw says they're supposed
[21:03] to be able to come in and preach a
[21:04] sermon or do a bible study
[21:07] well i forgot about the bylaws
[21:10] and so this person uh
[21:12] uh was basically gasping about me behind
[21:14] my back
[21:16] and
[21:17] and then it come down to it they just
[21:18] wanted the pulpit they just wanted to
[21:20] teach
[21:22] so instead of saying oh he just made a
[21:24] mistake they they've gossiped or the
[21:26] gossip about me and spread it around the
[21:28] church it's been years ago so many you
[21:30] probably don't remember maybe hopefully
[21:31] they didn't get to everybody
[21:33] but i just forgot
[21:34] so i just canceled the service i knew i
[21:36] couldn't be there i think i was sick or
[21:37] something like that but they kind of
[21:39] spread a little gossip around the church
[21:40] like well the deacon's supposed to do a
[21:42] teaching that day what they want to do
[21:43] they just want to get to the pulpit
[21:46] they just wanted power instead of saying
[21:47] oh brother that's okay
[21:49] i understand you forgot
[21:51] we love you instead of being kind and
[21:54] sweet they started contention the bible
[21:56] said wherever there's contention there's
[21:58] pride
[22:00] another
[22:01] in fact the bible says contention only
[22:03] comes by pride
[22:06] amen it wasn't long after that there was
[22:08] other problems wasn't long after that
[22:10] bye bye
[22:13] you know praying and the praying and
[22:15] asking god to remove that spirit and the
[22:16] spirit left
[22:18] maybe i didn't preach that one before
[22:20] but that's true
[22:22] and before was flattery flattery
[22:24] flattery but as soon as i did something
[22:25] they didn't like
[22:27] oh no gossip time
[22:29] bash in the preacher time
[22:31] which
[22:32] i probably i did make a mistake i forgot
[22:34] about it i said i'm sorry
[22:37] but rather than accept the apology
[22:39] gossip about it oh see look he's he's
[22:41] not even a good preacher he's not even a
[22:42] good pastor he makes so many mistakes he
[22:44] makes all these mistakes show me one
[22:45] person who doesn't make a mistake
[22:47] only jesus never made mistakes
[22:51] so see that's just a simple example
[22:53] there of how you got to discern that and
[22:54] i knew as soon as he started criticizing
[22:56] me i'm like that's the devil
[22:58] that's the devil
[22:59] that ain't god
[23:00] the bible says the holy spirit is long
[23:02] suffering
[23:04] that means i could do that sin two weeks
[23:06] in a row or just a mistake right
[23:09] forgetful three weeks in a row and you
[23:11] can still forgive me because you're
[23:12] long-suffering amen it's not short
[23:15] suffering it's long-suffering amen
[23:17] hallelujah
[23:19] just some simple wisdom there for us by
[23:21] god's grace
[23:22] now i'm trying to get to this text okay
[23:24] so let's start reading here before i
[23:27] before i forget here now
[23:29] in our text now
[23:31] the writer which we believe was paul now
[23:33] some people don't agree so that's why i
[23:34] say just the author but i believe it is
[23:36] paul but i don't have proof for it so i
[23:38] just i'm just saying it just sounds like
[23:39] paul's language that he uses in the
[23:41] other books that he or other letters
[23:42] that he writes
[23:43] therefore leaving the principles of the
[23:45] doctrine of christ let us go on to
[23:46] perfection so what are we saying he's
[23:48] saying this he said you're a church that
[23:49] you're dull of hearing he says you need
[23:52] to learn these principles again before
[23:53] we can go on to the other ones
[23:56] right
[23:57] and remember he says this will only do
[24:00] if god will permit it
[24:01] okay so let me put them up here so
[24:04] here's the scriptures we read now here
[24:05] i'm just going to skip ahead here's the
[24:07] six elementary doctrines the author says
[24:12] now i personally don't know if this is
[24:14] for every church i imagine it would be
[24:15] but i can't prove that by the bible uh
[24:17] but
[24:19] there are six things you need that we
[24:21] shouldn't forget and the church said
[24:23] amen in other words do not forget these
[24:25] if you forget these you're a babe
[24:28] and you're not fit to teach
[24:30] the congregation or your children or
[24:32] your brother or your sister you're not
[24:34] fit to teach anybody if you forget these
[24:36] amen let's go through these just real
[24:38] briefly okay
[24:40] the first one is
[24:42] uh the doctrine of christ i'm sorry uh
[24:44] the doctrine of
[24:46] repentance
[24:48] from dead works
[24:49] so dead works means you're a sinner and
[24:52] you work for yourself
[24:54] right all your works are selfishly
[24:56] motivated
[24:58] but real repentance means
[25:00] you stop working works of the flesh and
[25:03] you start working the works of the holy
[25:04] spirit
[25:06] praise god
[25:07] in other words this is the doctrine of
[25:08] repentance real if you really repent
[25:11] you will change your ways
[25:13] if you really say you're sorry then
[25:15] you'll try to find a way to stop cussing
[25:18] you'll try to find a way to stop lusting
[25:20] right you're trying to find a way to
[25:22] stop arguing and debating and slandering
[25:24] right
[25:25] if you're really repentant
[25:27] you will stop doing those works and
[25:29] you'll change your works everybody will
[25:31] see your works are different praise god
[25:33] you're a new creature in christ amen
[25:36] repentance
[25:38] from dead works
[25:39] and remember what are the works of the
[25:41] flesh let me read that in galatians five
[25:42] i just kind of came to me thank you lord
[25:44] uh galatians five didn't have any notes
[25:46] because
[25:47] now the works of the flesh
[25:52] yes are these this is galatians 5 19 i'm
[25:54] sorry i don't have it up there
[25:57] adultery right so you have to repent
[26:00] men and women cannot sleep with uh
[26:01] people other than their own husbands or
[26:03] wives
[26:04] and if they repent they won't do it
[26:05] anymore
[26:08] right and they won't divorce they'll
[26:09] forgive and stay together because they
[26:11] they promise god we're together until
[26:13] death
[26:15] and you better not break your promise
[26:17] with god
[26:19] okay so that's the first one fornication
[26:21] sex before marriage right repenting of
[26:24] that means it stops praise god
[26:27] third uncleanness now that's that's that
[26:30] word luxurious living
[26:31] so when you spend your money on
[26:32] luxurious things they're not even
[26:34] necessary
[26:36] you got to repent from that and stop
[26:37] spending your money on that and give
[26:39] your money to god or the family or
[26:40] something like that you have to stop
[26:42] blessing after luxury
[26:44] now lecheviousness is lawlessness which
[26:47] means i can live however i want i'm
[26:48] going to go to heaven no matter what
[26:50] that's lasciviousness the bible says
[26:52] without holiness no man will see the
[26:55] lord amen but holiness means
[26:58] sacredness if you don't live a sacred
[27:00] set apart life from the world you won't
[27:02] see god
[27:04] now the beautiful thing about god is
[27:05] that you can repent on your last breath
[27:07] and you'll be saved that's the beautiful
[27:08] thing about god
[27:09] the thief on the cross
[27:11] you can be separated that last few
[27:13] seconds of your life and go to heaven
[27:15] amen that's grace amen grace grace god's
[27:18] grace amen
[27:19] more of grace to know
[27:21] because you become separate from your
[27:23] dead works
[27:25] right
[27:26] some people have a hard time about that
[27:29] but look at the thief on the cross he
[27:30] was mocking jesus as they're getting
[27:32] crucified but by the end he's saying
[27:33] this man has no sin
[27:36] remember me and jesus said today not
[27:38] tomorrow amen today you'll be with me in
[27:40] paradise amen you'll instantly as soon
[27:43] as you die you'll be with me in
[27:45] abraham's bosom instantly
[27:48] hours after mocking the lord jesus
[27:50] christ
[27:52] so why don't you come down and save us
[27:54] the bible said they were all casting the
[27:55] same in his teeth that's mercy amen
[27:57] that's amazing grace jesus i sing for
[28:00] all that you've done for me amen
[28:03] that's amazing grace hallelujah
[28:06] but for those of us who live longer
[28:08] praise god we should
[28:09] leave the dead works and start doing the
[28:11] works of the spirit
[28:13] now there's a whole bunch of lists of
[28:14] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance so
[28:17] like divisions
[28:19] emulations right uh competition wrath
[28:23] strife seditions heresies endings
[28:25] murders drunkenness revelings
[28:28] and those that do them will not inherit
[28:29] the kingdom of god
[28:31] that's the very first basic step of a
[28:33] baby christian you cannot do evil works
[28:36] and be a christian
[28:38] you have to repent from dead works and
[28:40] live new works do works that manifest
[28:42] god's love amen
[28:45] hallelujah
[28:46] and if you can't explain that then
[28:48] you're still a baby
[28:49] but you have to like also i've heard
[28:51] austin do it many times so bro that's
[28:52] what i know you're on the road buddy
[28:53] you're doing good man
[28:54] he was always saying repentance means
[28:56] you never do it again you turn around
[28:57] and go the other direction because we're
[28:58] together all the time
[28:59] we talk about all these doctrinal issues
[29:01] and everything like that
[29:02] that's what it is that's the first one
[29:04] you got to repent you haven't repented
[29:07] now the second is faith toward god you
[29:09] have to have faith or trust in god you
[29:12] can't trust in man the bible said kurt
[29:14] it's abomination to put your trust in
[29:16] man
[29:17] that's a bible that's a bible foundation
[29:20] if you're going to be a christian you've
[29:21] got to have faith in god
[29:23] you got to know you got to trust god
[29:24] even if things don't look like they're
[29:26] going to work out trust god they're
[29:27] going to work out amen in other words
[29:29] this means be patient with god have
[29:31] faith in god
[29:33] trust his ways if he gives you a promise
[29:35] he gives you a word
[29:35] [Music]
[29:37] he's going to back it up it's just as
[29:41] unfailing as god is amen any promise of
[29:44] god is just as eternal as god is
[29:47] and you have to learn these baby milk
[29:49] you have to drink this baby milk can i
[29:50] say like that
[29:51] you have to this is baby milk here this
[29:53] is because we go on from this if god
[29:56] allows it amen thank god he's allowed it
[29:58] amen
[29:59] hallelujah we've been able to go beyond
[30:01] this praise god
[30:02] into the deeper things of god
[30:04] hallelujah like joshua amen yes brother
[30:12] it could yeah it could if that if that
[30:14] hinders your faith because any science
[30:16] that is true that's god
[30:18] yeah like gravity that's god
[30:20] you're not going to be gravity
[30:22] yep so that's good brother good good
[30:24] question yeah trusting so that's like
[30:26] scientists or atheists and they trust in
[30:27] god
[30:28] like i was reading the other day about
[30:29] uh darwin you know evolution he didn't
[30:31] start that that was like
[30:33] that's hundreds if not thousands of
[30:35] years old he's just the famous one that
[30:38] put his name on it you know the
[30:40] oh yeah not at all
[30:42] and so
[30:44] this is uh
[30:45] this is the building blocks this is the
[30:47] baby food for real christians right here
[30:50] amen
[30:51] next doctrine of baptisms now i got a
[30:53] scripture on my heart go to matthew i
[30:54] think it's matthew chapter 3. now i
[30:56] could be wrong but just go there
[31:00] yeah
[31:01] hallelujah
[31:06] matthew 3 11. there it is yeah matthew
[31:08] 11.
[31:09] now here's where we get doctrines of
[31:11] baptism there's two kinds of baptisms
[31:13] actually i'll say like this there's
[31:14] three
[31:16] yeah i just caught one i just got one
[31:18] here i mean i should have known i've
[31:20] known it already but there's at least
[31:21] three there could be more actually
[31:24] yeah so
[31:25] let me show you what i'm talking about
[31:27] uh i got it on the other document
[31:30] well yeah i you know i this may be my
[31:32] thought brother but let me just show you
[31:33] what i'm talking about
[31:37] this is what i'm talking about right
[31:38] here i'm talking about uh
[31:42] i'm talking about this uh
[31:45] yeah so let's read yeah we're talking
[31:46] about the spirit and the soul yes very
[31:48] good and then you have spirit soul water
[31:51] right so you have water baptism but then
[31:53] you also have the baptism in your human
[31:55] mind
[31:56] yep samification then you have the
[31:57] baptismal holy ghost in your soul
[31:59] so there's like at least three there's
[32:01] at least three
[32:04] yeah so here you know this verse says
[32:06] you have three parts you have a body now
[32:07] i took the body off because that's so
[32:09] obvious everybody knows they had a body
[32:11] that's the part that fails all the time
[32:12] that's
[32:13] that's my biggest enemy is my body
[32:16] the one i hate
[32:18] uh
[32:19] now the second part is your mind your
[32:22] human spirit
[32:23] that's your thinking
[32:25] now your innermost part is your soul
[32:27] that's your nature where's nature here
[32:29] she's
[32:30] where she is she out there okay i missed
[32:32] her
[32:33] i probably use her name more than
[32:34] anybody else's name but if faith comes
[32:36] i'm gonna be using her name a lot too
[32:38] we're here a lot of face names
[32:40] i use maokai a lot too maokai for you
[32:42] know
[32:44] a lot of virtue yeah i use virtue a lot
[32:46] too
[32:47] virtue
[32:48] um
[32:49] so in matthew 3 11 john said i indeed
[32:51] baptize you with water there's a water
[32:53] baptism
[32:55] unto repentance but he that cometh is
[32:57] mightier than me whose shoes i'm not
[32:59] worth about to bear he shall baptize you
[33:02] with the holy ghost and fire
[33:05] okay
[33:06] so you have a holy ghost baptism in the
[33:08] soul
[33:09] you have a water baptism but the old
[33:11] testament they only had the anointing or
[33:13] baptism in their minds
[33:16] okay
[33:17] so the doctrine of baptism that's john 7
[33:19] 39. this proves it
[33:22] it's just been a very uh it's been a
[33:23] very foundational scripture for us
[33:26] john 7 39.
[33:28] everybody awesome when you get that can
[33:30] you read that buddy take your time no
[33:31] rush we got it playing time
[33:34] but this fake kia the spirit
[33:43] amen praise god
[33:46] jesus is almost ready to to to be
[33:49] sacrificed right here this is john 7
[33:50] he's almost ready to be
[33:52] arrested and the bible says the holy
[33:54] ghost cannot be given
[33:57] now what it means is it couldn't be
[33:59] given the soul
[34:00] because they were their sins were only
[34:02] covered by animal blood
[34:04] and that could never put away sin
[34:06] it just covered it for a little while
[34:08] but when jesus came he was the lamb of
[34:11] god and the bible said that he forgives
[34:13] all our transgressions amen he washes
[34:16] away all of our sins amen
[34:19] he's the real lamb of god hallelujah
[34:25] yes yes sir in the soul yes sir
[34:28] nope he only had it out here his whole
[34:30] life yeah that's what the bible said the
[34:31] bible said john saw the spirit like a
[34:33] dove descended on him and then remained
[34:36] on him
[34:38] and the bible said as soon as he left
[34:39] his baptism he was full of the holy
[34:41] ghost and power
[34:42] let's read that why don't we read that
[34:44] yeah
[34:46] yes sir yeah so his body was the word
[34:48] brother his body had a word nature he
[34:50] didn't have a sin nature like we have
[34:52] but the holy ghost only anointed his
[34:55] outer spirit
[34:57] right
[34:58] and he remember he never did miracles
[35:00] till after he got the holy ghost
[35:02] yeah yeah that's beautiful
[35:05] yeah praise the lord see look we're
[35:07] growing tonight aren't we
[35:09] did you feel that just push down a
[35:10] little more praise god
[35:12] just push down a little more of that
[35:13] divine love amen now let's go to luke uh
[35:16] believe it's luke chapter 3 if i'm not
[35:18] mistaken i could be wrong could be luke
[35:20] 4.
[35:29] yeah if you go to luke 4 verse 1 brother
[35:41] yeah now this says where he now he's
[35:43] filled with the holy ghost but i'll show
[35:45] you also where the other one is okay so
[35:47] john 4 i'm sorry luke 4 1 and jesus
[35:50] being full of the holy ghost returned
[35:52] from jordan and was led by the spirit
[35:54] into the wilderness
[35:56] okay now go to john chapter 1. we were
[35:58] just there in john 7 but now go to john
[36:00] 1
[36:03] verse 32.
[36:05] so it was at jesus baptism that the holy
[36:08] spirit descended like a dove
[36:10] anointed his soul filled his soul
[36:12] and then now he's filled with the holy
[36:14] spirit and he goes out and awareness
[36:15] right away to be tested by the devil
[36:18] so look what happens brother after we
[36:19] get the holy ghost that's when the real
[36:20] test comes
[36:22] see it's a glorious thing to receive the
[36:24] holy ghost but you're going to be tested
[36:25] you ask brother amen and sister
[36:27] ask them about the test they went
[36:28] through
[36:29] yeah when you get the holy ghost it's a
[36:31] great thing but then watch it watch
[36:32] right after that it's most likely
[36:34] devil's going to come and try to knock
[36:35] you out
[36:36] but you got to stand there with what
[36:38] just the word just like jesus it's
[36:39] written devil it's written get behind me
[36:41] satan amen
[36:42] you can't force me to do miracles you
[36:44] get
[36:45] you can't force me to tempt god and
[36:46] worship idols it is written thou shalt
[36:48] worship the lord thy god and him only
[36:50] praise god
[36:51] it's a battle
[36:53] it's a battle especially i remember it
[36:54] now the one i remember most is sister
[36:55] who is so make sure you ask her about
[36:56] that i'm sure eight brother amen did too
[36:59] so john 1 32 and john bear record saying
[37:02] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[37:04] like a dove and it abode on him
[37:06] look at verse 33 and i knew him not but
[37:08] he that set me to baptize with water the
[37:11] same said unto me upon whom thou shalt
[37:13] see the spirit descending and
[37:15] remaining
[37:17] on him the same as he which baptizes
[37:19] with the holy ghost
[37:22] yes
[37:25] all right so let me go back there
[37:30] hallelujah now look we got these three
[37:33] now church now this just caught my this
[37:35] just caught my mind here we're talking
[37:36] about the baptist church right they
[37:37] don't even have this sister
[37:39] they don't even realize there's all
[37:40] kinds of different baptisms because they
[37:42] think when you get saved now you're
[37:43] filled with the holy ghost they don't
[37:44] even realize there's more to it than
[37:46] water amen i don't know you praise god
[37:48] there's more to it than water baptism
[37:50] it's soul baptism amen because the bible
[37:53] says you got three parts body spirit
[37:55] soul god wants to live in your soul and
[37:58] the bible says once he's there he sealed
[38:00] you he's marked you until the day your
[38:02] body is changed amen
[38:04] hallelujah praise god amen
[38:07] that just struck me right there most
[38:08] denominations they don't they stop right
[38:10] right here they can't even get this and
[38:12] even this one too
[38:13] they can't stop cussing they can't stop
[38:16] watching filthy movies or listening to
[38:18] worldly music they can't even get there
[38:20] but thank god look how far you've come
[38:21] amen you bunch of mature saints in here
[38:24] you bunch of meat eaters in here you
[38:26] ain't no babies we're not baby
[38:28] christians amen we're growing up in the
[38:30] things of god we're maturing amen the
[38:33] bible says we're going on to perfection
[38:35] hallelujah amen about just inspiration
[38:38] right here tonight amen that was all
[38:39] inspiration from heaven
[38:43] there you can see right there and the
[38:45] bible says this is the beginning
[38:47] if you can't even get this how are you
[38:48] going to understand the seven seals oh
[38:49] my here we go how do you understand
[38:51] revelation 10 7. if you can't even
[38:53] that's why they can't because they can't
[38:54] even get this
[38:57] how you going to understand well here
[38:58] we're going to get to it eternal that
[39:00] that's that's that's another one right
[39:01] here well let's get to it okay
[39:03] laying on of hands
[39:07] the bible says lay hands suddenly on no
[39:10] man
[39:11] that's for
[39:12] ordaining people
[39:14] you have to realize when somebody gets
[39:15] saved like let's use austin we wouldn't
[39:18] say well the first sunday he was here
[39:19] well let's lay hands on he's going to be
[39:20] a preacher or let's lay on him he's
[39:22] going to be a song leader you don't do
[39:24] that you wait a while and let them work
[39:26] out their own salvation you let them
[39:28] mature
[39:29] the bible said laying hands suddenly on
[39:31] no man
[39:33] that's the one idea but look what
[39:34] happens in other churches right remember
[39:36] you you see that a few years ago with
[39:38] kanye west he got he became a christian
[39:40] what's the next what happened the next
[39:41] sunday he's up there preaching and now
[39:43] look what he's doing
[39:45] i guess he put out his own bible or
[39:46] something like that
[39:52] he put his own name in there
[39:59] that's what happens when you lay hands
[40:00] on people suddenly
[40:03] right
[40:04] yeah
[40:05] yeah it's awful
[40:07] yeah
[40:08] and that's see this is laying on hands
[40:10] that's sim this is one of the simple
[40:11] things
[40:12] supposed to be supposed to be a simple
[40:13] thing
[40:14] now the other one is laying on a hands
[40:16] for healing
[40:18] and here's what i want to say about this
[40:19] this is what i've had to learn i know i
[40:20] say it
[40:21] often but i had to learn before i try to
[40:24] rebuke a devil or command the devil to
[40:27] leave i've got to make sure that person
[40:28] has confessed their sins
[40:30] before i lay my hands on and then rebuke
[40:32] the spirit i've got to make sure they're
[40:34] confessed because the bible says that
[40:36] that when that spirit enters the house
[40:38] that house belongs to the spirit until
[40:40] they repent and then that spirit has to
[40:42] leave then they got a cleaned out house
[40:44] right in other words the person has to
[40:46] want to be free the person has to want
[40:48] to be free from the devil before the
[40:50] devil can go amen
[40:54] so there's two areas with that on the
[40:56] laying on of hands
[40:58] divine healing and ordination
[41:02] now how many churches got that very few
[41:03] very few got that
[41:05] very few
[41:06] most churches like i was watching you
[41:07] know my old pastor
[41:09] not in the message but in denomination
[41:11] they just pray from the pulpit they
[41:12] don't invite anybody up for prayer to
[41:13] lay hands on them
[41:15] but you come up for prayer and the holy
[41:16] spirit came on you remember that
[41:18] burn right in you laying on a hands or
[41:20] something sometimes that's how god uses
[41:22] it
[41:23] laying on of hands i remember when that
[41:25] brother prayed for me and god healed me
[41:27] of my sickness right after service
[41:28] that's been years and years ago
[41:30] i remember that there's something about
[41:32] laying on hands it represents that
[41:35] person represents that's god's
[41:36] representative that's god's servant and
[41:38] now god's servant is blessing you amen
[41:41] hallelujah
[41:43] now next
[41:45] resurrection of the dead now the
[41:46] sadducees didn't believe in a
[41:48] resurrection
[41:50] right that's where they tried to trick
[41:52] jesus well a woman married this man and
[41:54] then the man died and she married her
[41:55] seven brothers which one is she going to
[41:56] be married to in the millennium or the
[41:58] resurrection see they were trying to
[42:00] confuse me he said you don't even
[42:01] understand the power of god
[42:03] he said god is the god of the living
[42:05] amen
[42:06] in other words he's saying when we get
[42:07] over there it ain't going to be about
[42:09] physical marriages our bodies are going
[42:11] to be like angel bodies
[42:13] that's why the mormons are wrong they
[42:14] think they're going to be saved and go
[42:16] to planets and procreate with all kinds
[42:18] of women and have all kinds of babies
[42:20] they don't even know the very beginning
[42:21] of this
[42:22] god's not resurrecting us with physical
[42:24] bodies that have sexual passions god's
[42:26] giving us a new body a perfect body at
[42:29] the off and you had a glorified body
[42:31] amen
[42:32] and what about this the resurrection
[42:34] dead how about this there's two
[42:35] resurrections
[42:36] most people don't know that
[42:38] there's the first resurrection that's
[42:39] the rapture amen that's why you're here
[42:42] tonight you're trying to be a part of
[42:43] the first resurrection
[42:45] and that's what paul said paul said i
[42:47] will do anything to obtain to that
[42:49] resurrection hallelujah
[42:51] i will sacrifice anything to be a part
[42:54] of that first resurrection the rapture
[42:56] hallelujah they're catching away of the
[42:58] bride of jesus christ amen the
[43:00] resurrection unto life hallelujah
[43:03] but there's also a second resurrection
[43:06] only the bride of jesus christ and 144
[43:08] 000 and all the old testament saints
[43:10] live in the millennium right now there's
[43:12] a group that comes up we know they got
[43:14] to populate the earth for satan to
[43:15] deceive someone or most of them
[43:19] but all the others all the foolish
[43:20] virgins they don't live for that
[43:21] thousands they live up in heaven they
[43:23] don't live on the earth for a thousand
[43:24] years but they get raised up or they get
[43:26] raised up here at the last resurrection
[43:29] the second resurrection which is the
[43:31] white throne judgment
[43:32] now how many people know that not many
[43:34] but i got a video on my website about it
[43:36] if you want to watch that there's two
[43:38] kinds of christians and they come out in
[43:39] two resurrections let's be part of the
[43:41] first amen
[43:42] let's strive with all we got lord i want
[43:45] to be in that number amen hallelujah
[43:47] glory
[43:48] thank god
[43:50] is my clapping bothering her is my okay
[43:53] i was gonna say i can stop clapping
[43:54] because sometimes i stop
[43:55] okay
[43:56] and sometimes i try not to clap right by
[43:58] lady's ears that's why i got those
[43:59] headphones there yeah austin you got a
[44:01] question buddy
[44:10] yeah
[44:11] yeah because
[44:13] yeah that's revelation chapter 20
[44:14] explains it because they didn't overcome
[44:17] everything on earth during their
[44:18] lifetime they were foolish
[44:24] not this time because the millennium
[44:25] brother there's no devil
[44:27] for a thousand years there's no devil
[44:31] yeah because that's where jesus is
[44:34] yeah that's called this
[44:35] yeah it's called the son of david yeah
[44:37] it's called his his time on earth a
[44:39] thousand years as the ruler of the earth
[44:42] not yet no that's that's the future home
[44:44] yeah let's be true
[44:46] uh because they're starting a new
[44:48] covenant
[44:49] it's a brand new covenant it's the
[44:50] called the eternal covenant new heavens
[44:52] new earth
[44:53] uh new city new jerusalem everything's
[44:55] new so it gets a new name
[44:57] good question yeah great coach let's
[44:59] give him two claps relax might as well
[45:01] praise god
[45:02] that's good buddy that's good yep laying
[45:04] on hands resurrected now how about this
[45:06] last one
[45:07] most people don't know
[45:09] that hell is not going to be for
[45:11] eternity
[45:12] what kind of god would send someone and
[45:15] punish one to hell for unending amount
[45:18] of time for only disobeying god for 30
[45:20] or 40 years 50 years what kind of god
[45:22] would do that you have to suffer
[45:24] eternally just for 20 or 30 years or 40
[45:27] years of sin
[45:28] what
[45:30] that would be awful is that fair is that
[45:33] a is that a fair sentence
[45:36] if you jaywalked and crossed the street
[45:37] is it fair to have 100 years in prison
[45:39] that's basically what it is
[45:42] right
[45:45] so the bible tells us no murder has
[45:48] eternal life abiding in him amen
[45:50] hallelujah
[45:52] that means in order to be saved in order
[45:54] to live eternally you've got to have the
[45:56] spirit of jesus christ in you amen and
[45:58] all these sinners that die without the
[46:00] spirit of christ they cannot live
[46:01] eternally they may live for thousands or
[46:03] millions we don't know how many years
[46:04] there lived but at some point they will
[46:06] cease to exist they have to be done away
[46:08] with praise god the bible says there
[46:10] will come a time when satan will be no
[46:12] more praise god amen
[46:15] hallelujah
[46:19] he just won't exist anymore he'll be
[46:21] annihilated
[46:25] now i don't know about that because the
[46:26] bible says eternal fire that's a good
[46:27] question but god is a fire so
[46:30] he's called a consuming fire
[46:33] because the bible says eternal fire the
[46:35] bible does say eternal fire but there's
[46:37] no way they can burn eternally because
[46:38] first it's unjust and second because
[46:40] they don't have eternal life
[46:45] exactly and see see brother they're
[46:47] babies then right
[46:48] and i'm not i'm not bad-mouthing them i
[46:50] love them i would help them i'd do
[46:51] anything i could for them i'd send them
[46:53] my books i visited 12 of their churches
[46:55] i'd do anything anything to help them
[46:56] out
[46:57] but most people don't want it they just
[46:58] shut it down because it's a contrary to
[47:00] their their church contrary to their
[47:02] denomination
[47:04] it sounds too crazy well if they read
[47:05] the bible it'd be right
[47:07] if they just read the bible and use a
[47:10] little common sense
[47:13] now church this is
[47:14] elementary christianity 101.
[47:18] so this is like can i say like this it's
[47:20] kindergarten well this is before
[47:21] kindergarten because they talk about
[47:22] milk
[47:24] uh this is preschool yeah
[47:25] still drinking milky
[47:27] i got your i teach first grade mr smith
[47:30] can you open my milk yeah yeah i can
[47:31] open your milk
[47:37] this is baby
[47:38] baby christianity
[47:41] right
[47:43] all right i'm gonna
[47:45] yeah give me 10 minutes i'll try to
[47:46] finish up here i want to be mindful of
[47:47] your your time too
[47:49] amen buddy praise god i just felt you
[47:51] know i was kind of struggling what did i
[47:53] preach and i just kind of felt the holy
[47:54] spirit bring this thought in here so i
[47:56] hope it's to help too my god's grace
[48:00] all right
[48:01] now what we need churches we need hearts
[48:03] that turn back to this doctrine because
[48:05] remember the bible says we'll move on
[48:07] from these if god will permit you to
[48:10] so see god won't permit you to until you
[48:12] what repent and have the right doctrine
[48:15] god's not going to move you on to the
[48:16] seals the church ages gifts of the holy
[48:19] spirit god ain't gonna move you on there
[48:20] for the perfect will of god god's not
[48:22] gonna move you on there
[48:24] he's not gonna permit it until you
[48:25] accept the revelations of these the
[48:27] simple the simple truths of these those
[48:29] six sorry
[48:30] god god has to permit it in other words
[48:33] you have to move past justification amen
[48:35] got to get the sanctification amen
[48:37] hallelujah
[48:39] that's good
[48:40] that's good thank you jesus so remember
[48:42] i read this quote on sunday brother
[48:43] braham says there must be someone rise
[48:45] up it's got to come thus saith the lord
[48:47] malachi 4
[48:48] it's exactly what he said would be a
[48:50] sign just before the coming of the great
[48:52] and terrible day of the lord i'll send
[48:53] you elijah what would he do turn the
[48:55] hearts of the children back to the
[48:56] doctrine of the fathers
[48:58] now we just read what the doctrine of
[49:00] the children or the early christians
[49:01] were that's the very beginning of
[49:03] christianity those principles
[49:06] and most churches don't even have those
[49:08] so how can they be mature christians
[49:09] they can't be they don't even understand
[49:11] those things
[49:17] i thought of a story i'm not sure if i
[49:19] should say it but uh
[49:23] i'm not sure
[49:25] i'll just i'll skip it i'll come back to
[49:26] it it's just about you turn it not
[49:28] eternal hell it's just a story i heard
[49:30] i'll just i'll save it for later
[49:32] um
[49:33] yeah back to the doctrine of the fathers
[49:34] back to the bible see out of these
[49:36] denominational differences and come back
[49:37] to the bible back to god that's what we
[49:39] must do notice what a great time we're
[49:41] living in
[49:43] now here's what brother is talking about
[49:44] malachi
[49:46] prophesied this i'll send you elijah the
[49:48] prophet before the coming of the great
[49:49] and dreadful day of the lord and he
[49:51] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[49:53] the children
[49:54] and the heart of the children to their
[49:56] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[49:58] with a curse
[50:00] okay
[50:01] so in this scripture malachi 4 mentions
[50:03] the spirit of elijah in two separate
[50:05] ministries
[50:07] now this is in my blue book brother
[50:08] austin the big one big one it's the last
[50:10] chapter 13.
[50:12] it's page 700 something
[50:15] 740.
[50:16] these two ministries belong to john the
[50:18] baptist and william branham
[50:19] john prepared the way for the messiah's
[50:21] first coming and brother branham
[50:23] restored the way for jesus second coming
[50:25] i hope we can see that clearer tonight
[50:26] can you see that how brother abraham had
[50:28] to clear those six doctrines up
[50:30] most churches don't even have those six
[50:31] doctrines
[50:32] i i'd go as far as saying this which
[50:35] message churches have all those six
[50:36] doctrines right
[50:38] about laying on hands and you know all
[50:40] those
[50:41] different things there which message
[50:42] churches have those
[50:45] about the different baptisms see most of
[50:46] them just say just come to church
[50:47] believe god sent a prophet and you're
[50:49] baptized with the holy ghost nonsense
[50:51] you got to get sanctified amen you got
[50:53] to get a new heart amen new heart new
[50:55] spirit then my spirit amen they never
[50:57] get a new spirit
[51:01] all right now brother here's here's the
[51:03] two john turned the heart of the fathers
[51:05] to the children and brother brown turned
[51:06] the heart of the children back to the
[51:07] fathers
[51:09] okay that's what the two spirits of
[51:11] elijah did there
[51:13] john the baptist had the spirit of
[51:14] elijah
[51:16] brother bran had the spirit of elijah
[51:17] they prophesied they had miracles of
[51:19] course john the baptist didn't have
[51:20] miracles but elijah did
[51:23] they rebuked immoral women praise god
[51:27] they were men of the wilderness
[51:30] they spoke with thus saith the lord
[51:33] now luke 1 17 says john the baptist
[51:36] fulfilled the first part he shall go
[51:38] before him in the spirit and power of
[51:39] lies to turn the hearts of the fathers
[51:40] to the children and the disobedient to
[51:42] the wisdom of the just to make ready a
[51:44] people prepared for the lord
[51:47] so john the baptist by elijah's spirit
[51:49] prepared the people for the messiah
[51:51] jesus by preaching repentance
[51:54] all right
[51:56] now next mark claims john did baptize in
[51:58] the wilderness and preach the baptism of
[52:00] repentance for the remission of sins
[52:02] see repenting and obeying god
[52:05] is the definition of a turned heart
[52:08] glory
[52:10] so has brother brahm's message turned to
[52:11] your heart that's the question that's
[52:13] the question tonight brother man's
[52:15] message was to turn your heart which
[52:17] means you repented of your sins and now
[52:19] you're obeying god
[52:21] that's what this ministry is all about
[52:22] amen hallelujah it's about the heart
[52:25] amen
[52:26] that's why when i first listened to
[52:27] brother braham i started crying because
[52:29] i've never heard somebody preach with
[52:30] such a heart as his heart
[52:34] because he loved jesus i never heard a
[52:35] man ever preach like that
[52:38] and so i started weeping but i was
[52:39] chewing tobacco playing tecmo super bowl
[52:41] on my nintendo
[52:42] i'm like trying to get these records and
[52:44] all of a sudden tears start coming down
[52:45] my eyes
[52:47] so i gotta spit out the tobacco and
[52:49] turn off the game
[52:51] what is this i i've never heard this
[52:53] i've been listening to sermons for
[52:54] almost two years
[52:57] good one i mean some good baptist ones
[52:59] too
[53:00] but i never heard a man preach like that
[53:02] that's that's why it's the holy spirit
[53:04] he's supposed to preach with the power
[53:06] of elijah and turn our hearts back to
[53:08] repenting and back to the bible amen
[53:12] that's what romans 6 17 says god be
[53:15] thanked that ye were servants of sin but
[53:16] you obeyed from the heart that form of
[53:19] doctrine
[53:20] which was delivered you
[53:22] and then here's acts 7 39 i love this
[53:25] this shows a disobedient heart is turned
[53:27] back to worldliness
[53:29] so that proves both your hearts are
[53:31] turned towards god
[53:32] because you've left worldliness that
[53:33] proves it
[53:35] because the bible says our fathers would
[53:37] not obey speaking of israel will not
[53:38] obey god but thrust him from them and in
[53:41] their hearts turned back into egypt
[53:44] so
[53:45] god had brought them out of egypt but in
[53:47] their hearts they're like we want to go
[53:48] back
[53:49] glory so as long as your heart is saying
[53:51] tonight i'm not going back i decide to
[53:54] follow jesus i'm not going back to
[53:56] denominationalism i'm not going back to
[53:57] the worldly things i'm not going back to
[53:59] sin i'm following jesus you know your
[54:02] heart is turned
[54:04] amen
[54:07] hallelujah
[54:10] see they turn back well let's go back to
[54:12] egypt let's go back to the drugs
[54:14] let's go back to fornication
[54:16] let's go back to cussing and swearing
[54:18] and murdering let's go back to rap music
[54:20] let's go back to country music whatever
[54:22] you know it doesn't matter what it is
[54:23] let's go back to uh drunkenness let's go
[54:26] back to orgies let's go back to all that
[54:28] no
[54:29] a christian has decided to follow jesus
[54:31] amen they're pressing on they press in
[54:33] the violent christians take the kingdom
[54:35] by force amen
[54:37] spiritually violent which means they
[54:38] snatch it away
[54:40] i'm snatching god's promises i'm going
[54:41] to fulfill god's word
[54:44] that's what the bible said the violent
[54:45] take it by force
[54:47] you snatch it away
[54:50] hallelujah
[54:52] now i want to
[54:54] i got a couple minutes here left on my
[54:55] 10.
[54:56] now my wife and i were talking i just
[54:58] thought i brought i thought i'd bring
[54:59] out this thoughts tonight because i knew
[55:00] it'd be a shorter sermon isaiah says
[55:02] this and a highway shall be there and
[55:05] away and it should be called the way of
[55:06] holiness
[55:07] and the unclean should not pass over it
[55:09] but it shall be for those the wayfaring
[55:12] men
[55:13] though fools shall not air therein
[55:16] the church the way of holiness is jesus
[55:18] how many know that he said i am the
[55:21] way
[55:23] so the bible says there's one way what
[55:24] is that way christ the word
[55:27] he's the way of holiness in hebrew it
[55:29] means you're set apart you were
[55:31] separated on your your uh yeah that's
[55:34] about that's right holy holiness it's
[55:36] the way of being separate from the world
[55:38] amen there it is hallelujah we're
[55:40] preaching the way to live separate from
[55:42] the world that's what our church is all
[55:44] about praise god the way of holiness
[55:47] even a fool or foolish virgin cannot be
[55:49] confused about god's calling for
[55:51] holiness
[55:52] nobody
[55:53] nobody should question this that a real
[55:55] christian should separate themselves
[55:56] from sinful things
[55:59] doesn't the bible say this and church
[56:01] these are new testament everybody say
[56:02] new testament ready
[56:04] these are new testament we are supposed
[56:06] to do what
[56:07] cleanse ourselves from some filthiness
[56:10] oh
[56:11] and this is in every one of their bibles
[56:14] and remember they'll be judged by paul's
[56:15] gospel paul wrote this all those
[56:17] churches will be judged by this
[56:19] you're supposed to get cleaned up from
[56:21] all filthiness amen
[56:23] and brother our voices will be there on
[56:25] that day judging them against them i'm
[56:27] just encouraging i'm not something we
[56:28] enjoy but we'll be there because we
[56:30] believed it amen we preached it praise
[56:32] god
[56:33] we lived it
[56:35] the bible says they're going to raise up
[56:36] the queen of the south they're going to
[56:37] raise up sister naomi they're going to
[56:38] raise up lydia they're going to raise up
[56:40] malachi we need some witnesses who did
[56:42] separate themselves from all fool
[56:44] filthiness and jesus say raise up acacia
[56:46] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[56:49] he needs somebody to be a witness praise
[56:51] god because he won't leave himself
[56:53] without a witness amen
[56:55] hallelujah let it be me let it be you
[57:01] it's new testament and this is the new
[57:03] testament follow peace with all men in
[57:05] holiness without which no man
[57:07] that's what i was saying earlier you can
[57:08] be holy in the last few minutes your
[57:10] life and so go to heaven because you're
[57:11] separate from the world
[57:13] you've decided to reject the world and
[57:15] follow jesus christ that's how merciful
[57:17] god is
[57:18] but for those of us who have decades
[57:19] let's let's let's devote all of our
[57:21] decades let's devote the rest of our
[57:22] lives to living separate from the world
[57:25] and perfecting holiness in the fear of
[57:28] god
[57:31] hallelujah this is good
[57:34] now here it is looking diligently lest
[57:36] any man fail the grace of god people can
[57:38] fail grace people can reject the grace
[57:41] of god
[57:42] by not living a holy life
[57:45] right like judas balaam
[57:47] they had a chance to be saved they had a
[57:49] chance but they failed grace they
[57:51] rejected grace for money or for
[57:53] popularity well actually both were money
[57:55] right balaam was money
[57:57] and uh yeah and then judas was money too
[57:59] they both did it for money
[58:01] that's what brother bam said brother
[58:02] austin uh preachers always get by by
[58:04] three things preachers always fall if
[58:06] they fall
[58:07] money women and popularity
[58:10] and you can see all down through the
[58:11] bible
[58:12] yep
[58:13] money was balaam and judas uh women
[58:15] would have been which preacher oh samson
[58:17] we'd say he's like a leader
[58:19] and then popularity king saul
[58:23] oh no he was saved yeah he was saved
[58:25] saul was saved too i'm just giving you
[58:27] examples of men that fell oh david david
[58:29] fell with a woman but he was saved yeah
[58:30] samson was saved yet
[58:32] yes he repented his last moment so did
[58:34] king saul
[58:38] in one way but it was actually a victory
[58:40] yeah it was actually a suicide but also
[58:42] a victory he had to do that to fulfill
[58:44] god's call for his life
[58:47] god's call for his life was to begin
[58:49] delivering israel from the philistines
[58:52] and they eventually got that victory
[58:53] later on but he's the one that started
[58:54] it
[58:56] that was he that was his brother the
[58:58] whole purpose of him being born was to
[58:59] do that
[59:00] because god knew he's going to be
[59:01] rebellious
[59:03] god knew he's going to be a very lustful
[59:04] man
[59:07] so the first two examples were lost
[59:09] balaam and judas but king saul and
[59:12] samson were saved and david no doubt
[59:14] david was saved
[59:17] yeah see they can fail grace lest any
[59:19] root of bitterness see you gotta watch
[59:20] bitterness right
[59:22] springing up trouble you and thereby
[59:24] you're defiled by being bitter right i'm
[59:26] gonna be bitter against my dad or i'm
[59:27] bitter against my my grandma bitter
[59:29] against the preacher i'm bitter against
[59:30] that that will defile your christian
[59:32] life
[59:34] if somebody hurts you go talk to them
[59:35] get it out of your heart don't let a
[59:37] root of bitterness grab a hold of your
[59:38] life
[59:42] now here's a good quote i want to read
[59:44] brother brahm said this
[59:48] i'll try to close i guess
[59:50] where's my notes
[59:53] okay there we go
[59:56] sorry about that
[59:57] okay this quote uh 1960 you know i've
[1:00:00] always tried to be this and our lord has
[1:00:02] always revealed to me there's one
[1:00:04] extreme and another extreme but right in
[1:00:06] the middle road lays the truth
[1:00:08] did you notice isaiah 35 where he said
[1:00:11] there shall be a highway and you
[1:00:12] remember how precious nazarene brother
[1:00:14] used to sing that song you know the
[1:00:15] highway of holiness
[1:00:17] highway of holiness now if you'll read
[1:00:18] your bible right it doesn't say the
[1:00:19] highway of holiness i just read it to
[1:00:21] you it doesn't
[1:00:22] it said there will be a highway and a
[1:00:24] way and it shall be called not the
[1:00:26] highway of holiness but the way of
[1:00:27] holiness
[1:00:28] and is a conjunction that finishes your
[1:00:30] sentences see there shall be a highway
[1:00:32] in a way and it shall be called the way
[1:00:34] of holiness not a highway of holiness
[1:00:36] see a road is built a good road is built
[1:00:39] the highest part is the center because
[1:00:40] it lets all the trash wash off on both
[1:00:42] sides that's it when a man really comes
[1:00:44] to christ he's got his eyes centered on
[1:00:46] christ but if he's a little bit
[1:00:48] emotional
[1:00:49] he'll be a fanatic
[1:00:53] if he's a little bit cold he'll get on
[1:00:56] the other side and just be a cucumber
[1:00:58] now i like cucumbers
[1:01:00] in the natural
[1:01:02] but we shouldn't be cucumbers in the
[1:01:03] spiritual
[1:01:05] what does the cucumber do just sit there
[1:01:06] that's all it does just sit there it's
[1:01:08] waiting for you to oh eat it you know
[1:01:09] cut it and eat it you just sit in there
[1:01:12] so some people just sit there in church
[1:01:14] like this the whole time
[1:01:18] now i seem like this for austin now when
[1:01:20] i go to places they're like
[1:01:22] they're chewing i'm like how can that be
[1:01:23] so delicious like what
[1:01:25] why can't you just like say amen to the
[1:01:27] word they're like
[1:01:31] brother brooks one time he's like i was
[1:01:33] doing that he's like hey can i have a
[1:01:34] bite of that that looks pretty good
[1:01:37] i started laughing because i had a bad
[1:01:38] habit of chewing my chewing my nails my
[1:01:41] hang nails and everything like that but
[1:01:42] see they sit there like a cucumber
[1:01:45] but you can't do that and get anything
[1:01:46] from god you got to get into the service
[1:01:48] you got to raise your hands like i like
[1:01:50] how you guys clap like that you know
[1:01:51] like i like how you clap like because
[1:01:53] you're getting into the spirit right
[1:01:54] pretty soon you start feeling good and
[1:01:56] never start marching around everybody's
[1:01:57] feeling good hallelujah glory we're just
[1:02:00] feeling good amen
[1:02:02] you got to get into the holy spirit
[1:02:04] praise god
[1:02:06] that's called crucifying the flesh and
[1:02:07] getting in the holy spirit
[1:02:10] he said but see until they get
[1:02:11] intellectual they just sit there
[1:02:15] but the other side is i got to have a
[1:02:17] motion if i don't have any it's all
[1:02:18] emotion if i don't feel something god's
[1:02:20] not there but the truth is right down
[1:02:22] the middle
[1:02:24] you don't have to have all kinds of
[1:02:25] emotion you have to sit there and think
[1:02:26] about it all the time you got to have a
[1:02:28] balance
[1:02:30] hallelujah
[1:02:32] because we've seen many people
[1:02:34] shout scream dance speak in tongues or
[1:02:36] whatever and others
[1:02:38] growing up i've seen all the time but
[1:02:40] then leave and they go live in sin or
[1:02:42] get divorced or commit adultery
[1:02:45] or go cross-dress right or cut their
[1:02:47] hair we've i've seen it all
[1:02:49] i've seen it all praise god
[1:02:51] i think most of it
[1:02:54] so that's the emotional side but i've
[1:02:55] also seen the other side people get so
[1:02:57] cold on god
[1:02:58] pretty soon they fall away too
[1:03:01] but you gotta have right down the middle
[1:03:04] i love this what he says he said but the
[1:03:06] main thing is right in the middle of the
[1:03:07] road with enough spirit in you keeps you
[1:03:10] warm and moving
[1:03:12] amen and knowing enough to keep yourself
[1:03:14] under see knowing enough see enough
[1:03:17] understanding to keep yourself in
[1:03:19] obedience to the holy spirit
[1:03:22] to move just as the spirit moves not
[1:03:24] till or not after just as the spirit
[1:03:27] moves
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:32] so that's why church i put this up there
[1:03:35] right
[1:03:36] we're and if we're baptized with the
[1:03:38] holy ghost i'm gonna show them if we're
[1:03:39] if we're baptized with the holy ghost or
[1:03:41] on our way to it you're on this road
[1:03:42] brother austin and lena you're on this
[1:03:43] road
[1:03:45] the foolish burden's out here in the
[1:03:46] grass
[1:03:48] they're not they're not drowning but the
[1:03:50] make the make believers are out here
[1:03:51] they're drowning
[1:03:53] and the sinners they're drowning they're
[1:03:54] lost
[1:03:56] but church we are progressing on the
[1:03:58] road brother ramsay you can start on
[1:03:59] this and then fall off
[1:04:01] in the status perfect man
[1:04:04] i don't want to fall off the road i want
[1:04:05] to stay right in the middle by god's
[1:04:06] grace
[1:04:08] right so see but even now but austin and
[1:04:10] lena even with people that are born
[1:04:12] again sometimes they're they're too
[1:04:13] emotional and they don't have enough
[1:04:15] doctrine
[1:04:18] like they're just looking for like a
[1:04:20] just somebody get excited and tell me
[1:04:21] that god's gonna answer my prayer
[1:04:23] but what if it's not time
[1:04:25] or what if it's not god's will they
[1:04:26] don't even think about that they just
[1:04:27] want a motion
[1:04:30] and yet they can be baptized with the
[1:04:31] holy ghost but they're just not in the
[1:04:32] middle of the road
[1:04:35] and on the other side
[1:04:37] you have people that are so smart or
[1:04:38] think they're so smart
[1:04:40] that they reject all the holy spirit
[1:04:43] anointing and they don't want to feel
[1:04:44] nothing they just want to think about it
[1:04:46] and try to figure everything out you
[1:04:47] can't always figure everything out
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:52] brother ram calls that you're crossing
[1:04:53] bridges before you get there
[1:04:55] trying to see how god's going to do it
[1:04:57] and god will do it exactly opposite of
[1:04:58] how you think he's going to do it just
[1:05:00] to prove that you don't know everything
[1:05:01] right
[1:05:02] i don't know everything
[1:05:05] to do it totally different than he did
[1:05:06] before
[1:05:07] just to show you you don't know
[1:05:09] so you got to be what balance right in
[1:05:11] the middle
[1:05:12] you got to have the feelings you got to
[1:05:13] have some emotion
[1:05:16] right and then you got to be you got to
[1:05:18] use your wisdom too what does the lord
[1:05:19] taught me what's the scripture say lord
[1:05:21] open my mind help me to understand this
[1:05:23] it could be right down the middle
[1:05:25] now i believe our church does a good job
[1:05:26] of that
[1:05:28] now you've heard it too because we've
[1:05:29] had some emotional prayers that was
[1:05:30] beautiful a few weeks ago wasn't that
[1:05:33] that was glorious
[1:05:35] uh same thing happened when huda got the
[1:05:37] holy ghost and different times we prayed
[1:05:38] for lydia we prayed for different ones
[1:05:40] and
[1:05:41] i've needed it too you know i love that
[1:05:43] because that shows we can be emotional
[1:05:45] at times and just and then use our
[1:05:47] understanding and just stay right down
[1:05:48] the middle of the road we got both
[1:05:51] we're not always shouting screaming too
[1:05:53] much
[1:05:54] and we're not using the word right well
[1:05:56] i guess yeah too intellectual
[1:05:57] but we use both the word and we wait for
[1:05:59] the we we wait for the emotion to come
[1:06:01] with the word amen that's right amen so
[1:06:04] we stay right down the middle of the
[1:06:05] road
[1:06:07] because anybody can have a motion
[1:06:09] anybody can have intellectualism
[1:06:11] think they're smart but the holy ghost
[1:06:13] is both
[1:06:14] it's a balance of both
[1:06:17] now you can stop the live stream so i
[1:06:18] just want to show a few things i'm going
[1:06:20] to preach longer on this on sunday so
[1:06:22] love you live streamers god bless you
