[0:00] uh we got to do a little teaching here
[0:01] by God's grace and uh but uh as things
[0:05] have transpired I mean think about the
[0:07] last two weeks of three weeks that have
[0:10] taken place the things oh saints of God
[0:12] things are moving
[0:15] I hope that you are able to see the
[0:18] things that are moving in our midst okay
[0:21] something took place on the 10th
[0:23] something in the natural and something
[0:24] in the spiritual this is these are big
[0:27] moves here by uh the powers that be Um,
[0:31] I don't know if Sister can get this up
[0:33] on here. Uh, we want to, um,
[0:38] uh, hopefully this will work. It worked
[0:40] the last time. Oh, there we go. Praise
[0:41] the Lord. So, um, let's, uh, stand here
[0:45] to, um, First Kings 18.
[0:51] I administer something on this again,
[0:53] but saints, I really believe this. I
[0:55] need to just uh, look at this again.
[1:04] Um because I believe there's I don't
[1:07] think you can under under uh teach this.
[1:12] I don't think there I don't I don't in
[1:14] other words I don't think you can teach
[1:15] this enough.
[1:17] Um
[1:19] and I'm not the best orator. You know,
[1:23] you know what I like about the revival
[1:25] is a lot, they say a lot of the guys
[1:26] there that brought the Holy Ghost down
[1:28] and this and that, they were not refined
[1:31] speakers. Right now, I'm not a refined
[1:34] speaker, but I'm just I want to I'm just
[1:36] trying to I say, "Hey, just listen
[1:38] trying to listen to what the Lord's put
[1:39] on my heart here."
[1:41] &gt;&gt; And I really just uh when I read this, I
[1:44] was I was trying to find what you know,
[1:46] but just hit me on hit me up on Thursday
[1:48] and I just kind of was reading the Bible
[1:49] and like, "Lord, where do you want me to
[1:50] go?" And then this scripture came up
[1:52] here um one of the couple there and I
[1:55] want to uh uh just um speak on this here
[1:58] by God's grace this morning. Uh first
[2:00] Kings 18
[2:02] and uh
[2:05] let's start at verse 20 there. So Ahab
[2:08] sent unto all the children of Israel and
[2:11] gathered the prophets together unto
[2:13] mount Carmel. And Elijah said unto all
[2:16] the people and said, "How long halt ye
[2:19] between two opinions? If the Lord be
[2:23] God, follow him. But if Baal be but if
[2:27] Baal, then follow him." And the people
[2:30] answered him not a word. Let's bow our
[2:34] heads in a word of prayer.
[2:37] Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we love you. We
[2:39] come before you humble, reverent, Lord
[2:41] God. Lord, how we desire, Lord, to have
[2:43] more of the fear of the Lord. How to
[2:45] reverence you more, God, Lord, and Lord,
[2:48] to keep everything just pure and holy
[2:50] before you, Lord God. And Lord Jesus, we
[2:52] want to please you in all things, Lord.
[2:55] And Lord, uh
[2:58] we're just standing here asked to be
[3:01] here, God. We got the invitation. And
[3:03] Lord, God, we want to bring, Lord,
[3:05] what's been on my heart here. This has
[3:06] been something here stirring. And Lord,
[3:10] be with the people, God. Lord, I just
[3:11] ask God that you would speak to them,
[3:13] God, Lord. And Lord, that you would say
[3:15] what you would have me to say. And Lord
[3:17] God, Lord, may they be able to discern,
[3:19] Lord, between me speaking and you, Lord.
[3:21] And Lord, just uh uh the exact words,
[3:24] Lord, that you the exact uh feeling you
[3:27] want to give off, Lord God, by this
[3:28] little study, Lord. We just certainly
[3:30] love and appreciate you, Lord. Bless the
[3:32] people. Give them strength, God. Anoint
[3:33] them, Lord. Protect them, God. Protect
[3:35] them, Lord, in their bodies. Protect
[3:37] them in their spirit realm, Lord. And
[3:39] Lord Jesus, I ask God you'd seal each
[3:41] one in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:43] Christ. Seal them with the Holy Ghost.
[3:45] Lord, we love you, Lord. In the name of
[3:47] Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated
[3:49] there. Um
[3:54] uh it's just always good to come here
[3:56] and to someday, you know, but Jess like,
[3:58] "Hey, brother, could you come and sit in
[4:00] service?" Yeah, I'd love to do that.
[4:02] Absolutely. Just sit here and I might
[4:03] stay for second service. Uh I guess we
[4:05] got a testimony. Uh so I think I might
[4:08] stay for that. sit with you saints in
[4:10] there and a nice seat there and then you
[4:12] know sometimes I show up here then we
[4:14] see uh Sister Caris there just as tall
[4:17] as I can be can be then Sister Haven I
[4:20] always thought Haven Sister Haven was
[4:21] going to be
[4:24] littleer than me well she's getting
[4:25] bigger she's growing and we see all
[4:27] these things that's exciting to see
[4:29] because I always want the best right as
[4:32] an uncle you want them to be bigger
[4:34] taller faster stronger than their uncle
[4:36] right even even the sisters right even
[4:37] the girls absolutely
[4:38] Uh but um in this thought saints uh so
[4:42] it's good to see family good to see the
[4:44] church family the spiritual family may
[4:46] god bless you each one may god give you
[4:48] strength and uh uh but this morning I
[4:51] would like to speak on on is there a
[4:55] difference so
[4:57] I I I I I feel uh
[5:01] that we are getting very very close to
[5:06] this rapture. I believe we're getting
[5:07] very very close to this persecution to
[5:11] the the economical move that's coming.
[5:15] I believe that we're just who knows how
[5:17] much I I I it would not surprise me if
[5:20] this thing went down tomorrow. It would
[5:22] not even surprise me the way things have
[5:26] went. Right? So
[5:28] uh in this saints of God in in every in
[5:31] every church age in every uh walk of
[5:35] life in every period of time in the Old
[5:39] Testament in in everything saints of God
[5:41] there's always been two opinions. You
[5:43] know the prophet of God he said he said
[5:45] up in up before uh the fall took place
[5:48] in heaven that Lucifer was the
[5:51] right-hand man of God. He was literally
[5:53] the covering anointed cherub angel that
[5:57] watched over the great Jehovah that
[5:59] watched over Jesus Christ, right? And
[6:01] and he was the covering angel. He was
[6:03] the one that was uh leading songs or
[6:05] however and he was there. But then of
[6:07] course then he have to he came upon his
[6:10] own opinion.
[6:12] He got a thought from somewhere
[6:15] something inside of him. He started to
[6:17] look at himself and realize how
[6:19] beautiful he was. and he was looking at
[6:21] other angels. He would even look at the
[6:23] the the pillar of fire, the uh God
[6:25] himself, and say, "Man, I'm even more
[6:27] beautiful than the pillar of fire or or
[6:30] I'm even more wise than most these
[6:32] angels. Why why am I not being the one
[6:34] worshiped? This is and and and in those
[6:36] thoughts, that's what caused his fall
[6:39] because of what he thought about his
[6:40] beauty." Right? Uh so when these things
[6:43] uh and now notice at that time then of
[6:46] course we know that the prophecy he said
[6:47] that Satan Lucifer went up and set his
[6:49] own kingdom up on the north side of
[6:51] heaven. Now how does that work? I don't
[6:52] know anything about that. Alls I know it
[6:54] was the north side and it was in heaven
[6:56] and he was setting up a kingdom right
[6:57] and he deceived what onethird of the
[6:59] angels there and then at that time I'm
[7:01] sure they must have have started setting
[7:03] up services another church service up
[7:06] there in heaven what worshiping him. Now
[7:09] can you imagine that? Here's all
[7:11] powerful God. Here is God that uh speak
[7:14] literally brought forth creation. He
[7:17] spoke them. He actually created the very
[7:20] angels. He created Lucifer. Now Lucifer
[7:23] thinks so highly of himself that he goes
[7:25] and sets up his own church service, his
[7:28] own place up in heaven and he leads
[7:30] songs and he deceives these angels. The
[7:32] word went out amongst the angels and
[7:34] said, "Hey, Lucifer is starting
[7:36] something over here. He's got a
[7:37] different idea. He's got a different
[7:39] plan. Listen to this and this and this
[7:41] and this. Well, guess what? All them
[7:43] angels, one-third of them, what decided
[7:45] to follow him and they started having
[7:46] services there. Oh my goodness.
[7:50] And then one time when the Lord would
[7:52] set up a call for church,
[7:54] well, here's all the angels and God was
[7:56] like, "Well, where's the covering angel?
[7:57] Where's where's where's Lucifer? Where's
[7:59] the covering angel? Where's my
[8:00] right-hand man?" And all of a sudden,
[8:02] obviously, God knowing everything,
[8:04] nothing succumbs some prize, right? And
[8:07] he said, "All right, boys. Let's gather
[8:08] up. We're going to war. Gather. Put your
[8:11] hands on, right? Put your heart your
[8:13] helmets of this and your swords and all
[8:15] these sort of things, whatever." How
[8:16] they were dressed at that spot. And they
[8:18] went over and kicked Satan out, right?
[8:20] And uh but at that time there was two
[8:23] opinions. Who is who is who is the one
[8:25] to be worshiped? Lucifer or the Lord
[8:27] Jesus Christ? Uh the devil or God
[8:30] himself? Right? Who is it? Now, now
[8:32] notice here at this time period right
[8:34] here, um he says, look what Elijah said
[8:37] unto the people. He says, "How long haul
[8:40] shall you be between two opinions,
[8:41] saints of God, you know why, you know
[8:42] why I I feel this way this morning is
[8:45] because of what has taken place the last
[8:47] couple weeks? There has been an
[8:49] assassination
[8:51] of a religious figure in America
[8:57] and we were given a story within two or
[9:00] three days. were given. Oh, it was this
[9:01] it was this gunman here and how he shot
[9:04] here and this is it. And now, saints of
[9:06] God, we're three weeks, two weeks, two
[9:07] and a half, three weeks past that. And
[9:09] now there's over a thousand theories on
[9:12] what is taking place?
[9:16] What is truth? Is it a hologram?
[9:20] Was there something right here that blew
[9:21] up and went this way? Was it a shooter
[9:24] from behind? Saints of God, what is
[9:26] going on?
[9:29] What is truth?
[9:32] When these things takes out, now we see
[9:34] what a darkness come in.
[9:38] An unknown comes in and now there's
[9:40] debates on this, debates on this,
[9:42] thoughts on this. Well, I think it's
[9:43] this, saints of God. And now what? It's
[9:45] a complete utter hole or or or just
[9:49] stirring pot of what? Confusion.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; And we know who the author of confusion
[9:56] is.
[9:58] Now, why did why did why did it go down
[10:00] like this? Why was everything this and
[10:02] this and the saints of God to what what
[10:03] does confusion do? It causes division.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Why were the uh American Indians
[10:12] defeated by the Anglo or the English?
[10:16] What? Because they were divided amongst
[10:18] their own tribes and would not unite to
[10:20] fight the white man. Right? That's what
[10:23] took place. What? So division. This is
[10:25] all coming to cause division
[10:29] on Facebook there. My other nephew on my
[10:31] wife's side text about this. He said, he
[10:34] said, "Man, this is going to get bad."
[10:35] And I said, "Yes." I said, "It's going
[10:37] to defide the country and saints of God,
[10:39] here we are,
[10:43] and now there's now as as I've told
[10:46] brothers, men on the on the job site,
[10:48] what's taking place? This is turning
[10:51] religious.
[10:54] This thing is going to turn towards
[10:57] Christianity socalled. This is And now
[11:00] notice what do they have? They have a
[11:01] woman rising up full of makeup, full of
[11:05] this, wearing uh pants and dressing like
[11:08] a man and this this and now she's going
[11:09] to she has made head now of her
[11:11] husband's
[11:13] business.
[11:15] My right
[11:17] now we have two opinions.
[11:20] What is truth saints?
[11:23] What is truth? Right now notice uh I
[11:25] want to speak on on this way. I'm going
[11:27] to go this way for a little bit here.
[11:28] Now notice I want to I want to show you
[11:30] two quotes here. This everything hinges
[11:33] on this these look at these quotes. Now
[11:35] I'm not trying to say oh but I'm just
[11:37] look look at this. Look look how this is
[11:39] spoken. Now our eternal destination is
[11:41] not altogether by what we see and what
[11:44] we hear.
[11:46] Well, brother Malc's like brother S. I
[11:48] saw that hologram projector and it was
[11:50] it wasn't even real. It wasn't even him
[11:52] and this and this and I say, "Well,
[11:53] brother Mal, well, I believe that blood
[11:55] that was spurting out of that neck was
[11:56] caused by a bullet that came and lodged
[11:58] and that was the exit wound." And now
[12:00] what? We're we're we're tossed on. We're
[12:02] we're we're having a disagreement on
[12:04] something when that absolutely means
[12:05] nothing. Right
[12:07] &gt;&gt; now, we can have a discussion on that,
[12:09] right? But is that a salvation issue?
[12:11] No. That is a distraction. Saints,
[12:15] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. And when I I
[12:16] just recently listened to Lester
[12:18] Summerall's testimony and he was a
[12:21] minister from denomination way he died
[12:23] in like 9698 and he was one of the he's
[12:26] one when he was in his 20s he was living
[12:29] he was stationed over he was living over
[12:31] in England in the Wales right and he and
[12:34] he heard about Smith Wigglesworth
[12:37] and this is after the ri revival after
[12:39] his ministry was over he was an old man
[12:41] he's just kind of waiting for his time
[12:43] for God to take him home and he said
[12:44] that he said He had he said he went to a
[12:46] meeting and he preached this this he
[12:48] says and he and Smith Wigglesworth came
[12:50] up to him and said sir my name is Smith
[12:52] Wiggles he goes oh I know I know who you
[12:54] are he goes oh my name is Smith
[12:55] Wigglesworth he says why don't you come
[12:56] see me sometime brother Smith
[12:58] Wigglesworth said brother Lester can you
[12:59] come over and see me sometime over my
[13:01] house he goes it's such and such and
[13:02] such and the guy's like I would love to
[13:06] come and talk to Smith Wigglesworth the
[13:08] great revivalist the great preacher the
[13:11] man who cast out demons he healed the
[13:13] sick raised the dead all these sort of
[13:14] things. And you know what? What took
[13:16] place? The man, he said he excited. He
[13:18] waited a little bit of time. He just he
[13:19] didn't want to push it, but he waited a
[13:20] couple weeks. Finally, he said he called
[13:22] up. He said, uh, sent him a letter. Hey,
[13:24] I'll be showing up at a certain date.
[13:26] Sure enough, he shows up and he's he he
[13:28] that morning, he was walking through. He
[13:30] said he grabbed the paper. He bought the
[13:31] paper right off the streets, gave him
[13:32] like a dime or a quarter or a nickel,
[13:34] whatever it was, cost to that. He got
[13:35] the the morning paper. He put it under
[13:37] his arm like this. He's walking up to
[13:38] Smith Wigglesworth's house and he goes
[13:40] like this. You know, he goes, "They
[13:41] didn't have uh doorbells back there, but
[13:43] they had knockers, right?" He's like,
[13:44] "Tink tink dink dink." Guess who opened
[13:47] the door? Smith Wigglesworth.
[13:50] Smith Wigglesworth didn't say anything.
[13:52] Just looked him up and down.
[13:57] Oh, good to have you here. Absolutely.
[14:00] He said, "What you got under your uh
[14:03] your arm there?" Talking about this
[14:04] newspaper.
[14:06] Smith Wigglesworth uh you could come in,
[14:09] but that can't come in. He goes, "That's
[14:11] full of lies.
[14:14] And the guy's like, Lester's like,
[14:16] "Okay." So he takes a newspaper, throws
[14:18] it in the bush, he said, and then they
[14:20] came in. He came in to fellowship,
[14:23] right? But he was calling. Well, even
[14:24] back in the early 1900s, it was the
[14:27] 1920s.
[14:28] Smith Wiggle knew the what? The
[14:30] newspaper was corrupted. The news is
[14:33] corrupted. They're not saints of God.
[14:35] Holy Ghostfilled men do not own the
[14:37] newspapers. Holy Ghost fil men do not
[14:40] own the television stations. Holy
[14:43] Ghostful men do not hardly own anything
[14:45] in this world.
[14:48] Okay, remember that. Remember everything
[14:50] you see, everything you hear, given to
[14:53] you by the media is given by people who
[14:56] don't know God.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; It's given by people who do not care
[15:01] about your eternal destination. And if
[15:03] they do, they want it not to go up, but
[15:05] they want it to go down. Amen.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Because all these things are lies. All
[15:10] these things are deceptions. All these
[15:11] things are distractions. Trying to get
[15:14] your mind on these distractions instead
[15:17] of the word of God. Saints of God, if
[15:19] you want to catch the revelations, you
[15:21] have to what what did David say in the
[15:23] Psalms? He said, "You've got to meditate
[15:25] on the word of God. How can you meditate
[15:29] on Jesus? How can you meditate on the
[15:31] Psalms, on the proverbs, and wait for
[15:33] what and what takes place? Then after
[15:34] you meditate, you I can't remember which
[15:37] which man I I listened to, but he said
[15:38] he said first of all, he says you got to
[15:40] read, you got to pray over before you
[15:42] read the word, he said, then you read
[15:44] the word, he said, and after you've read
[15:45] the word, you go and find a place, a
[15:48] nice little secret place or out in the
[15:49] wilderness or whatever. He says, and you
[15:50] start meditating on the word of God, and
[15:52] then what he said, then the revelations
[15:54] will start dropping. Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; But how are you going to catch these
[15:59] revelations if you can't even meditate
[16:01] on the word of God when all these other
[16:04] distractions are on your mind?
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, remember, keep the things
[16:08] of the world with them.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Don't even let don't just if it's
[16:13] already in your mind like it's in mind.
[16:14] What you've got to cast these things
[16:16] out. Forget about it. Let them deceive
[16:18] the masses. But saints of God, you've
[16:20] got to look out for your own soul. Amen.
[16:22] We have to watch out for our own selves.
[16:25] Absolutely. That's what we want to do.
[16:26] Now notice he says, "Now our eternal
[16:28] destination is not determined by what we
[16:30] see and hear, but it's determined on
[16:32] what we dis on what discernment we have
[16:35] on what we see in here."
[16:41] &gt;&gt; So you and I might see the exact same
[16:43] thing. You and I might see things
[16:45] differently on what's taking place here.
[16:48] But can we discern the same things? Can
[16:51] at the end of the day say Malachi
[16:55] You know, maybe it was a hologram. I
[16:57] don't know. But one thing for certain,
[16:59] we're going to church on Sunday and
[17:01] we're going to church on Wednesday,
[17:04] &gt;&gt; right? Saints of God, those things are
[17:06] so trivial. It's like, man, this is so
[17:08] obvious of how a trick how much of a
[17:11] trick this is. This is so in our faces.
[17:13] Saints of God, this is not even
[17:14] deceiving.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; It is deceiving to these who are not at
[17:18] focus on the word of God. Do not know
[17:19] that there's a white horse rider riding
[17:22] right now. Now notice they don't even
[17:23] know there's a pale horse. What is a
[17:25] pale horse? The ram said that pale horse
[17:27] was made up of all three.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; So this last death horse, this run
[17:32] called death riding this pale horse is
[17:35] going to come with deception. It's going
[17:37] to come with uh uh persecution. And it's
[17:39] going to come with what? To steal the
[17:40] wealth of the world all of in one age.
[17:43] See why Leo is so rough.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; It's not just deception.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; It's just not persecution and murder and
[17:50] martyrdom and that. is not just stewing
[17:52] the we of the world at one focus and
[17:53] part of time but it's all of them
[17:55] encapsulated in one time period. Welcome
[17:58] to Leodysia. Welcome to the days of
[17:59] Noah. Welcome to the days of Lot. Right.
[18:02] Amen. Absolutely. Saints of God.
[18:05] That's why when the headstone comes
[18:06] down, it's going to be crying grace
[18:08] grace because we're going to need it.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; This is the most deceptive age that has
[18:14] ever been. And you know what your one of
[18:16] the first sermons your pastor ever
[18:17] preached that has always stuck with me
[18:21] back in 2003 I think it was called
[18:25] modern day Judas
[18:27] I'll tell you what I was just listening
[18:29] I was like oh my goodness brother Jess
[18:31] is an absolute masterpiece
[18:33] but what as we get closer to the thing
[18:35] it's going to be more and more deceptive
[18:37] right remember there is brother said
[18:39] there's one last trial one last test for
[18:41] the bride we have to pass it right Now
[18:44] notice as we discern these things
[18:48] with we have to have the discernment.
[18:50] Now notice if you lack discernment
[18:52] what's going to take place you must make
[18:54] a choice.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Each one of you each one of us has to
[18:59] make a choice.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Each one of us need individual
[19:03] discernment to see what is going on. You
[19:05] know brother Randy he also sent me a a
[19:08] thing. He looked at last name Kirk. You
[19:11] know what the last name Kirk means? It
[19:13] means church.
[19:15] You know what Erica means? That name
[19:16] Erica, it means eternal protector.
[19:19] So notice here's a woman who's an
[19:21] eternal protector. Church. Who's the
[19:24] eternal city? The Catholic Church. What
[19:26] is a religion? She's Catholic, saints of
[19:28] God. This is so obvious, so plain. What
[19:30] they just the the the meanings are the
[19:32] the things are laying in the names,
[19:34] right?
[19:36] He says, "You must make a choice. Your
[19:38] choice will determine what your eternal
[19:40] destination will be.
[19:42] So, it's not even what you discern. You
[19:45] might be able to say this is right or
[19:47] this is wrong. Let's say let's say
[19:48] something is bringing forth and you're
[19:50] hearing it and it's true and you discern
[19:52] that it's true. But if you make a wrong
[19:54] choice,
[20:03] He came to and he had to discern if this
[20:05] was God, if this was someone special, if
[20:08] this was the Messiah or not. And guess
[20:09] what? He made the right choice.
[20:13] But what he was willing to come and meet
[20:14] the Christ. Amen. He's willing to make
[20:16] to meet Jesus. Amen. Now, uh, now I want
[20:20] you I want this. I want this next quote.
[20:23] Actually, I had we had I had actually
[20:24] had problems. A brother kicked up
[20:26] because of this quote, but guess what?
[20:27] Here, we're going to read anyhow. He
[20:28] says, "Now the word the word of God or
[20:30] the church dogmas is before you. You can
[20:32] take accept what the church dogmas of
[20:35] the church, he says, or you can take
[20:36] what the word says. Remember,
[20:39] in all ages has been as it is right now.
[20:45] What does that tell you? In every age,
[20:49] it's been so close to deceive the very
[20:51] elected.
[20:53] We have the highest level of deception
[20:55] now, though. But back in the Ephesian
[20:57] age, there was deception there. That was
[21:00] the original. Why horse rider saints?
[21:02] &gt;&gt; And they were he was deceiving. The
[21:04] antichrist spirit was deceiving. But
[21:06] remember at that time in that first
[21:08] church age, it was so close as to
[21:10] deceive the very elected because the
[21:12] elected that time only had so much
[21:14] revelation and Satan was working with
[21:17] the revelation that they had right
[21:18] there.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; See, so we it's not uncommon. All of our
[21:23] forefathers, all of our fore mothers,
[21:25] all of our families, all our brothers
[21:26] and sisters that came before us had to
[21:29] make a call because what the deception
[21:31] was there.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; It's always been about deception,
[21:34] saints.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; That's been the whole thing is we we not
[21:38] man I saw this I could it was just like
[21:40] there it is. There is always a popular
[21:42] belief among the people and it's always
[21:44] been a little contrary to the real word.
[21:49] Now,
[21:52] is this thing with Charlie Kirk and all
[21:54] that, is that going to deceive you? This
[21:56] woman rising up with makeup and
[21:58] blackness around her eyes and hair done
[22:01] up and dressing like whatever, is she
[22:03] going to deceive you?
[22:05] Absolutely not. Not Not even close to
[22:08] deceiving. We'll look at it and say,
[22:10] "Yeah, that that's exactly prophecy.
[22:11] Prophecyy's winding up. Here we go."
[22:14] But the deception will be so close to
[22:17] the true word of God. The deception will
[22:20] be what? Right in the message. He says,
[22:22] "Remember, it's never been right out.
[22:25] Deny it." Oh, no. The Antichrist don't
[22:27] deny the word. Certainly not. He says
[22:28] and believes it, but just not all of it
[22:31] the way it's wrote here. See? See?
[22:33] Right. Amen. Now notice
[22:36] uh
[22:40] and I think saints of God as this thing
[22:43] progresses we're going to see more
[22:45] deception.
[22:47] I believe this is going to get so
[22:49] remember I I just heard it on the way
[22:51] yesterday listen the prophet when he was
[22:54] reading when he was talking about
[22:56] Matthew 24 uh he was just reading he
[22:59] says he's a and they'll come false
[23:01] Christ uh uh he and they'll they'll pack
[23:05] something he so close as to deceive the
[23:07] very elected and when he said that word
[23:09] elected he goes he goes look at that he
[23:12] says elected he says he said the only
[23:14] way you cannot be deceived if is if
[23:17] you're predestined.
[23:21] So, it's not even really your choice.
[23:24] And yet, God gives you a choice. But the
[23:27] predestined, those that have their names
[23:29] on the lamb's book of life will not be
[23:32] deceived. And by that only,
[23:36] saints of God, that's why we can rest
[23:38] assure.
[23:40] We can you can have comfort and say,
[23:41] "The Lord has called me. The Lord has
[23:44] revealed this message to me. God has
[23:46] revealed this word.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; I can't be deceived. Why? Because what?
[23:51] He's already revealed himself to me.
[23:53] Amen. Yeah. Now,
[23:57] uh in moving here, look here. It says,
[23:59] "Now, first Peter 5'8 says, "Be sober
[24:02] and be vigilant, saints of God, as we go
[24:04] through this life, as we're rounding
[24:06] this thing, as we're rounding the corner
[24:07] on this. Something took place on
[24:09] September 10th. Now, we have the the
[24:11] missing of the rapture and all these
[24:12] saints of God. This thing is crazy. It's
[24:15] it's everything's out of control there.
[24:17] The the I was like this. Darkness has
[24:19] filled the land even more. It's getting
[24:21] darker and darker. You know, I there are
[24:23] two people in our church that had dreams
[24:25] of this.
[24:27] Pastor Gam had a dream. He says where he
[24:29] was in a spot. He says in time, he says
[24:32] it was complete darkness.
[24:36] And the Holy Spirit, the pillar of fire
[24:38] spoke to him and says, "Go out and make
[24:39] a uh draw people to the door of the
[24:43] rapture." And he said he goes he was
[24:45] walking in the darkness and he she said
[24:47] he was so close to people he it was so
[24:50] dark he couldn't even he couldn't even
[24:51] see who their faces was but he kept
[24:52] saying come to the rapture come to the
[24:55] rapture come on come on let's go to the
[24:57] rapture go to the rapture and he said he
[24:58] got him right up to the door and the
[24:59] Holy Spirit told him again said turn
[25:01] back and do one more cry one more call
[25:03] out went back into the darkness please
[25:07] come come the rapture is coming rapture
[25:08] coming he says and he went and he
[25:10] brought another group he says and all of
[25:11] a sudden he said the door opened And the
[25:13] last thing he woke up, he said, "I'm" He
[25:15] was screaming, "I made the rapture."
[25:18] But at the time of the rapture, it's
[25:20] going to be so dark.
[25:24] What did Matthew 25? Their lamps went
[25:27] out and they said, "Give us of your oil,
[25:31] they could not see."
[25:34] There's another sister in our church
[25:35] that had a dream. She said it was so
[25:36] dark. She said she was coming, she was
[25:38] in a dream. She said it was dark. She's
[25:40] walking around. and a pillar of fire
[25:42] came and started moving to her and she
[25:44] was able to see she said and it went
[25:45] right into her
[25:48] and it was right at the coming of the
[25:50] Lord. Saints of God,
[25:53] it's going to get darker than this.
[25:56] Brother S, I don't think No, I don't
[25:57] think it this thing is so confusing
[25:59] right now. America,
[26:03] remember once that woman rises up, what
[26:06] takes place?
[26:08] America's destroyed.
[26:10] Once that woman takes either either it's
[26:12] the Catholic Church, once she's vice
[26:14] president or president, whatever
[26:15] whatever whatever form God seems to
[26:17] reveal this as once she takes power,
[26:20] she'll be extremely beautiful but
[26:22] extremely cruel in heart. What then?
[26:24] Judgment will strike her.
[26:27] Is this her? Is it revealed to us now
[26:30] that this is her?
[26:34] Be sober. Be vigilant. In other words,
[26:36] this is it's time to shake off anything
[26:39] worldly. It is it is beyond time. We are
[26:44] behind time. I'll say like that to where
[26:46] we should be. Now, in the mind of God,
[26:48] everything is just in order.
[26:51] Because remember, God can move this
[26:53] thing with just one voice, one word of
[26:55] his voice, with one moving of of his
[26:58] spirit, one downpouring of the Holy
[27:00] Ghost. And he's got us in order because
[27:03] remember, he does the work. Amen. Even
[27:06] Christ when he was in the flesh, he
[27:07] said, he says, "Not I that do the work,
[27:09] but what? It's the father doeth the
[27:11] work. It's the Holy Ghost. Nothing can
[27:13] be done without the power of the Holy
[27:15] Ghost." Amen.
[27:17] Be sober. Be vigilant. He says, "Because
[27:19] your adversary, the devil, as a roaring
[27:21] lion, walketh about seeking whom he may
[27:24] devour,
[27:27] he's hunting you."
[27:30] You know that you are the hunted.
[27:33] Someone is trying to set every trap
[27:36] possible for your souls.
[27:39] To some, what are the three traps? pride
[27:41] of life, uh,
[27:46] lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and
[27:48] pride of life. Those three,
[27:51] the devil's trying, he knows. I like
[27:53] this. He's been studying human
[27:55] psychology since day one. Look how good
[27:58] he was back 6,000 years ago with Eve.
[28:01] Boom. First try, got her.
[28:05] He watches. He knows weaknesses. He
[28:08] knows what your weakness is, saints.
[28:10] Remember, do not deceive yourself.
[28:15] I seen a man one time challenge the
[28:16] devil. He's all that devil. If he was
[28:18] here, I'd knock him out. Within three
[28:19] weeks, he was back out in the world.
[28:21] Never came back to Christ.
[28:23] He was on fire for God. He was
[28:25] witnessing. Oh, praise the Lord,
[28:26] brother. You want a Bible study? I'll
[28:27] have Brother Simon or Brother Cracker,
[28:28] big brother uh Brother Brooks or
[28:30] whatever do Bible studies. He's
[28:31] witnessing, living for the Lord. He come
[28:32] to church, worship this. And one day, I
[28:33] seen him, I was I was there. He goes, he
[28:35] goes, "Man, if that devil came here, I'd
[28:36] knock him out."
[28:38] in three weeks,
[28:41] hasn't been back since.
[28:45] The devil is more than a match for any
[28:48] of us.
[28:50] But he wasn't sober. He did not approach
[28:53] his Christianity, his salvation soberly.
[28:57] He did not approach God as like, "Lord,
[28:59] I need you." He was what what was he
[29:02] saying? He was looking at his flesh like
[29:04] like God like like Satan's like Satan's
[29:07] a man. He's a spirit saints. He is a He
[29:10] is an angel with the highest of all the
[29:13] angels. The only thing you can't do is
[29:15] create.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Keep what? Be sober. Be vigilant. Make
[29:18] sure you're watching. What they what
[29:20] they say when someone dies, they always
[29:21] have a v a vigil, right? They're all
[29:23] what? They're watching with their with
[29:25] their lights, their candles. They're
[29:26] watching,
[29:27] giving a moment time. What? Be sober.
[29:30] And what? look for the coming of the
[29:32] Lord
[29:34] because what he's going to he's trying
[29:36] to remember this is the last trap. This
[29:38] is the final move of the devil. Whom
[29:41] resist steadfast in the faith knowing
[29:43] that the same afflictions are
[29:45] accomplished in your brethren that are
[29:46] in the world. Whatever we're going to
[29:48] see, saints of God, our brothers have
[29:50] already they're going through it right
[29:51] now.
[29:53] They're getting slaughtered. Thousands
[29:55] upon thousands of Christians are dying
[29:57] right now in other countries.
[29:59] murdered, martyed for the name of just
[30:02] simply for the name of Jesus Christ, not
[30:04] for believing servant seed, not for
[30:05] believing in one God, just because they
[30:07] identify themselves with Jesus Christ.
[30:11] Amen. Now look here in Ezekiel 28. Uh
[30:15] and the word Lord came unto me, saying,
[30:17] the son of man, say unto her, thou art
[30:19] the land that is not cleansed, nor nor
[30:21] rain upon the day of indignation. There
[30:24] is a conspiracy of her prophets in the
[30:26] midst thereof like a roaring lying
[30:28] ravening the prey. Notice the priests in
[30:31] this time in Israel were what? Just
[30:33] serpents. The devil was fully behind
[30:36] them and in them doing what they wanted.
[30:38] They have devoured souls. They have
[30:40] taken the treasure of the precious
[30:41] things. They have made her many widows
[30:43] in the midst of thee. Right? Now notice,
[30:46] look what it says here in verse 26. Her
[30:49] priests have violated my law.
[30:52] They have profaneed my holy things. You
[30:55] know, saints of God, there are holy
[30:57] things and there are unholy things.
[31:01] They have put no difference between the
[31:04] holy and the profane or the unholy.
[31:08] Think about let's let let me go back to
[31:10] my childhood and explain something. The
[31:13] way I'm seeing this, my mother raised us
[31:15] Pentecostal and every morning right
[31:18] before work or before school, she would
[31:20] listen to the Christian radio station
[31:22] and the Christian radio station would be
[31:24] on there and you know what they would be
[31:25] blasting because it was family oriented.
[31:27] It might have been focused on the
[31:28] family. I'm not sure what it was, but
[31:30] they were focusing on those things for
[31:32] children, for mothers,
[31:35] and they were blasting the cartoons
[31:38] that that the kids were watching. They
[31:41] said, "Don't you don't you let your
[31:43] children watch Smurfs." And they took
[31:45] that word Smurf and it means like a
[31:46] demon or a blue devil or something.
[31:51] But when I would go to church, my pastor
[31:54] was letting their children watch the
[31:56] Simpsons.
[31:57] [Laughter]
[32:01] My pastor was putting out Hollywood
[32:03] Halloween
[32:05] things out in the yard.
[32:07] My pastor let their children watch all
[32:10] these cartoons. And you know what we did
[32:11] as the boys, the children?
[32:14] Mom.
[32:16] Mom.
[32:18] Look at my eyes.
[32:20] The pastor lets his kids watch these
[32:23] things. Why? That's the pastor. Mom.
[32:28] [Laughter]
[32:31] My pastor saw nothing wrong with it. He
[32:34] could not discern good from evil.
[32:38] He could not discern from the holy
[32:40] things, which is the word of God, and
[32:42] the unholy things,
[32:44] &gt;&gt; children's entertainment back in the 80s
[32:46] and 90s. There's witchcraft all around.
[32:51] There was Gargaml. He was a wizard, a
[32:54] witch, completely unholy, unsanctified,
[32:57] a devil.
[33:00] And our pastor would let his children
[33:02] watch. Mom,
[33:05] okay, we can't watch Smurfs. Okay, we
[33:07] can't watch Scooby-Doo.
[33:09] We can't watch any of it because there's
[33:10] always ghosts in Scooby-Doo. There's
[33:11] always ghosts. Got the sheet on there
[33:13] with the little eyes cut out and they're
[33:14] like, "Right." I said, "Mom, maybe at
[33:18] least we could watch the S Simpsons.
[33:20] I'll never let you watch the Simpsons."
[33:23] But the pastor does. You know what my
[33:25] mom said? I don't care what he does. I'm
[33:28] running the show here.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; But my mom had enough sense. Grandma
[33:34] Ruby had enough sense to what? Be able
[33:37] to discern clean things from unclean
[33:40] things.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Are we able to do it today?
[33:48] &gt;&gt; They to put no difference between the
[33:50] holy and profane. Neither have they
[33:53] shown the difference between the unclean
[33:55] and the clean. And they have hid from
[33:57] their eyes my Sabbaths. And I am profane
[34:01] among them.
[34:06] I happen to be going through every once
[34:08] in a while I hit them the Facebook there
[34:10] and I look at little posts and I was
[34:12] just on there
[34:14] and a minister from this message said
[34:18] first of all we've got to read the Bible
[34:22] and second of all and he lists two other
[34:24] books he said who were actually I looked
[34:27] at the the summary of these two books
[34:30] and they're Catholic influenced they're
[34:32] Catholic olics who wrote them and he's
[34:34] encouraging the young men of the message
[34:37] because these books have so much hero
[34:39] heroic courageous things that these
[34:42] people do in these books that after the
[34:44] Bible we should read these
[34:47] and I'm like what are you doing?
[34:51] He was not able to discern between the
[34:54] holy and the profane.
[34:57] So, I looked these books up and sure
[34:59] enough, Catholic author, Catholic
[35:01] author. In fact, they said even in the
[35:04] even in the the Google said these have
[35:06] Catholic themes all the way through
[35:08] them. And I'm thinking after the Bible,
[35:11] first of all, we should read the church
[35:12] age book. And I'm not saying read it.
[35:15] I'm studying this book, right? Then
[35:17] second of all, I would listen to or read
[35:20] 50 years in the church of Rome, saints
[35:22] of God. I'm telling you about that.
[35:24] Those three books right there, the
[35:25] Bible, the church age book, and 50 years
[35:27] of church, saints of God. Those things
[35:28] will set your hearts on fire.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; They will reveal things that you never
[35:33] thought possible. Right now, then after
[35:35] that, what about all the uh what's that?
[35:37] What's that? Uh the audio the audio
[35:40] plays they have uh
[35:44] not sights and sounds, but
[35:46] the golden ship,
[35:49] &gt;&gt; lamp lighter.
[35:51] What about all the books of lamp
[35:53] lighter? Let's read those. What is
[35:56] courageous, guys? What saints of God?
[35:58] What is courageous? What was what is
[35:59] being courageous? Or or or or teaching
[36:01] you to be a man? Someone out here
[36:03] casting spells and and slaying dragons
[36:06] and lions and this this or someone who's
[36:08] praying on their knees and the Holy
[36:11] Ghost is hearing their prayers and
[36:12] accomplishing their prayers. What is
[36:14] real courageousness?
[36:16] What is real bravery? What is real
[36:19] strength? Strength is in the Holy Ghost.
[36:22] Amen. Strength is praying. What that
[36:24] brother say from brother Cam had about
[36:26] two years ago. He came. He said, he
[36:27] said, "Brother," he goes, "We don't have
[36:28] much over there in Cameroon. We don't
[36:30] have much money." He says, "Our our our
[36:32] our church floors are still dirt." He
[36:34] says, "But when we have prayer
[36:35] meetings," he says, "Our five and six
[36:37] year old boys are praying so hard
[36:39] they're breaking into visions, and the
[36:41] visions are coming to pass."
[36:44] That's courageous. That's a move of God.
[36:48] Those are spiritual powerhouses, saints.
[36:53] But saints of God, can we discern this?
[36:55] Is this of God or not? Is this of God or
[36:59] not?
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Can we discern what's true and what's
[37:02] wrong? What's right? Is it is is this
[37:05] Christian or not Christian?
[37:08] &gt;&gt; There's there's a little catchy song out
[37:10] there right now. I don't know if you
[37:12] heard it. I think it was sent to me.
[37:15] Talk. It's about dusty Bibles.
[37:19] and new iPhones.
[37:21] And I wonder why we feel this way.
[37:25] The lyrics are powerful, but is it is it
[37:28] is it a little too rock and rolly? I
[37:30] don't know. It looks It looks a little
[37:32] But I'll say this. Let's get Let's get
[37:34] the dust off our Bibles. It packs a good
[37:36] message.
[37:38] Let's not go too far into it, but let's
[37:40] go to the Bible and see what the Holy
[37:41] Ghost tells us. Saints of God, the only
[37:43] way we're going to know be able to
[37:44] discern. Who gives a discernment?
[37:47] Brother Simon, I was naturally gifted in
[37:49] discernment. From the time from my
[37:51] mother's womb, I was discerning good
[37:52] milk from bad milk. I was discerning
[37:54] right good peas from bad peas. I was
[37:56] discerning all this this. Saints of God,
[37:58] this true discernment comes from the
[37:59] Holy Spirit.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Only God himself can give you
[38:03] discernment.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; He can show you little things.
[38:09] You just have to be looking. You have to
[38:11] keep your spiritual eyes open, saints of
[38:14] God. That's what the Bible The Bible,
[38:15] this is, this is a spiritual book,
[38:17] right? This is spir this is a
[38:18] supernatural book. If you can read this
[38:22] time and time again, things are going to
[38:25] jump out at your eyes and hit you in the
[38:28] spirit realm. Right? This is called
[38:29] what? Revelation. I just heard this this
[38:32] on the way here. Brother Ram said he
[38:33] said he said spiritual revelation can
[38:36] only be given by the Holy Spirit.
[38:37] Spiritual revelation is predestinated.
[38:42] Now, let's continue. Look at the time
[38:46] we're in. 90 about 90% of all Christians
[38:50] cannot discern what had just taken place
[38:52] a couple weeks ago.
[38:54] They don't understand. I just witnessed
[38:56] to a guy on Wednesday night
[39:02] right before church. I had I had to
[39:03] minister and I said, "His name is Dave."
[39:06] I said, "Dave," I said, "Did you watch
[39:08] what just took place?" He goes, "Yeah,
[39:09] yes, man. It's crazy." I said, "But do
[39:11] you know what she is and who she is?"
[39:13] And he goes, "What?" She's a Catholic.
[39:15] He goes, "What does that mean?" I said,
[39:17] "Dave,
[39:19] do you know who Revelation 17 is?" And
[39:20] he goes, "No, been a Christian for 40
[39:23] years."
[39:26] I said, "The Revelation 17 is the
[39:27] Catholic Church." And he goes, "You're
[39:30] blowing my mind right now." And I said,
[39:32] you know, we know these things for as we
[39:34] come to word. But to him, it was fresh.
[39:37] And I said, you had better start
[39:38] investigating this because it's going to
[39:40] turn in a one world religion. It's this
[39:43] thing. They're going to unite. And he's
[39:45] just like, he goes, "Man, maybe we
[39:47] should have Bible study." I said,
[39:48] "Anytime you want, I'll be there." But
[39:50] he was not. He didn't even know those
[39:52] basic revelations. We have something we
[39:54] we take for granted now. Something we
[39:57] just we already well. Oh yeah,
[39:58] absolutely. That's revelations. That's
[39:59] the Catholic Church. Saints of God. to
[40:00] them it's unknown.
[40:05] Look here. Look at this next one. Woe
[40:07] unto them that call evil good and good
[40:11] evil.
[40:15] Did you know you are
[40:18] radical
[40:20] Christians?
[40:21] You guys are labeled cult.
[40:26] And yet what?
[40:29] We base everything on this. We can take
[40:32] this and go into a Baptist church and
[40:35] show that they're wrong and show them
[40:36] true baptism. We can go and take this to
[40:38] the Catholic church and show them, hey,
[40:39] you're there is no mediator between God
[40:41] and man. There's only one mediator and
[40:44] that's the Lord Jesus Christ. We can go
[40:45] to Assemblies of God and what we can
[40:47] say, hey, there's of of of the all the
[40:49] times the five times that people
[40:51] received the Holy Ghost, only three of
[40:52] them did they re speak in tongues.
[40:54] Right? So we can take this word and show
[40:57] them the truth. Now it's up to them then
[40:59] to discern if I speak if we speak true
[41:01] or false. Right? To discern what? Good
[41:03] and evil. Saints of God, can they
[41:05] discern it? Can you discern it? What?
[41:07] Woe unto them that call evil good and
[41:09] good evil.
[41:11] But did they not call our Lord be
[41:13] elabub? Did they not call Paul, he says,
[41:16] a heretic? Didn't they call Peter what?
[41:19] Just a deceiver, right? Became dangerous
[41:22] to the government. Right? He says, "And
[41:24] put darkness for light."
[41:27] What was that whole move? What is the
[41:28] whole move we're seeing right now? It's
[41:30] darkness and they call it the truth.
[41:33] This is the move of God. And yet it's
[41:36] darkness.
[41:40] You got to think what? Not just the sun
[41:42] and and moon, night and day. We got to
[41:44] think spiritually. They are bringing
[41:47] forth spiritual darkness.
[41:50] Because remember what is light? Jesus
[41:52] said, "I am the light." And what is who
[41:54] is he? He's the word. The true word is
[41:58] light.
[42:00] The true word is spiritual light. False
[42:04] word, false moves is complete darkness,
[42:08] void of the light.
[42:11] He says, "An light for darkness that put
[42:13] both bitter for sweet and sweet for
[42:15] bitter."
[42:18] In other words, we're going to pre
[42:19] preach easy things.
[42:21] God loves you,
[42:23] but they don't want nothing like you got
[42:25] to repent.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; You got to live clean and holy. Sisters,
[42:29] don't cut your hair. Don't wear no
[42:30] makeup. Brothers, don't wear no shorts.
[42:32] Don't show off your gigantic uh uh
[42:34] muscles or whatever this that, however,
[42:37] live clean. They don't want to hear the
[42:39] tough things, the bitter things that the
[42:40] Bible, saints of God,
[42:43] you go and pick any sermon of brother
[42:45] Brandham tonight, listen to it, and see
[42:47] if he doesn't preach on organization.
[42:53] Every almost every service he's blasting
[42:56] denominations. Every sermon,
[42:59] organization,
[43:01] Antichrist spirit, false doctrine.
[43:09] He says, "Woe unto them that are wise in
[43:11] their own eyes." He says, "I'm prudent
[43:13] in their own sight." Don't think you're
[43:15] nothing. Anything that you have, saints
[43:17] of God, any revelation you have is
[43:19] God-given.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; We must be grateful for everything the
[43:24] Lord has given us.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] So they call good for evil, evil, good.
[43:33] Now, is darkness a deception?
[43:36] Well, this is darkness really deception.
[43:40] No.
[43:42] He says, "And he showed me the church
[43:44] ages. They come up out of the ages and
[43:45] lo how vulgar. He said, "Then the last
[43:47] one was the last day church age which
[43:49] was led by a witch." H
[43:53] you know the witches of our day are
[43:54] saying this woman is rising up is is is
[43:58] is uh is one of theirs.
[44:04] You see how the some of the oultist
[44:06] websites are saying this this lady is
[44:08] one of theirs.
[44:10] She's going to move this thing. She's
[44:12] gonna This is exactly what this is
[44:13] playing definitely in the plan.
[44:17] He says, "And they were so immorally
[44:19] dressed, so filthy looking, and they
[44:20] were marching to the time of twist and
[44:22] rock and roll. And those women throwing
[44:25] themselves, saints of God, what is what
[44:27] is probably the most deceptive song.
[44:29] Let's just This is something Brother Cam
[44:30] found.
[44:33] We are one in the spirit. We are one in
[44:39] the Lord. We are one in the spirit. We
[44:45] are one in the Lord. And I pray that the
[44:50] unity will someday be restored.
[44:55] And they'll know we are Christians by
[44:59] our love. By our love. They will know we
[45:04] are Christians by our love.
[45:08] that was written by a Catholic priest
[45:12] to capture the Protestants to bring them
[45:14] back to the mother. That song
[45:20] and yet it's catchy, it's snappy, it's
[45:22] wow, it's got the right message, it's
[45:24] got the right vibe. Oh, it feels good.
[45:26] Yes, we are one in the spirit, but it's
[45:27] a Catholic song coming to woo you back
[45:30] to mama.
[45:35] But we sang that in Bible believers for
[45:36] years.
[45:38] until brother Cam's like typed it in
[45:39] like who wrote this anyhow? Oh my
[45:41] goodness. Think we've sang it since
[45:43] negative.
[45:45] Now notice he says immortally twisting
[45:47] the time rock and roll and those women
[45:49] throwing themselves out in twist and
[45:50] holding just paper gray. Notice how he
[45:53] used that word gray. These women had
[45:54] what? Gray
[45:56] covering them. Hypocritical. Gray is in
[45:59] between white and black which is a
[46:02] deceiving color. Gray is neither white
[46:04] nor black. It's a deceiving color. He
[46:08] says,
[46:10] that's why they say, "Oh, the
[46:11] messenger's gray areas. These gray
[46:13] areas, you got to study and pray on
[46:15] those."
[46:17] In reality, there's not too many gray
[46:18] areas. Very, very few gray areas
[46:22] by the scripture. Now, notice,
[46:25] let me, we're at about 45 minutes,
[46:26] saints. Just give me a second here. Uh,
[46:29] look here.
[46:32] Look at the look what Jesus said here.
[46:34] Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[46:36] hypocrites, for ye tithe of mint and
[46:39] anise and cumin, and have omitted the
[46:42] weightier matters of the law.
[46:47] It's great to preach these things, but
[46:50] the weightier things, the most important
[46:52] things are not being preached. He says,
[46:55] judgment,
[46:57] mercy,
[46:59] and faith. What do we need to make in
[47:01] this rapture? Faith. You had better have
[47:05] faith. By faith Enoch, right? By faith
[47:08] Noah. By faith Abraham. By faith Samson.
[47:11] Saints of God is all faith. Faith is
[47:13] very, very important. You must have this
[47:16] rapturing faith, saints of God, to
[47:18] change your bodies. Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, remember it. Where is
[47:22] your faith right now?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Do you have enough faith right now that
[47:25] if I was if I was to get sick and say,
[47:27] "Oh, I start having a heart attack,
[47:29] brother." Would you have enough faith to
[47:30] pray over me and have God heal me right
[47:32] now?
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Bring it up a notch. Now we we see we're
[47:37] surrounded by Philistines. Would you
[47:40] have enough to fa say, "Lord, come down
[47:43] here this temple. Come get me for this
[47:46] rapture. Lord, I need a body change."
[47:48] Now, do we have that faith? It's in us
[47:51] potentially. It's in us already. If you
[47:53] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that
[47:55] faith is already lying within you. But
[47:57] it's got to what? come up higher.
[48:00] Something's got to remember, faith
[48:01] cometh by hearing. You're going to have
[48:02] to hear something specific. There has to
[48:05] be specific revelation. There's got to
[48:07] be something revealed to you to make
[48:09] this rapture.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; If faith cometh by hearing. And what's
[48:12] the hearing? By the word of God. There's
[48:13] got to be something that's being
[48:14] preached or something that has not been
[48:16] preached. There's got to be something
[48:18] coming that's going to raise your faith.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord. What do What are we
[48:26] missing here? What do we need to go back
[48:28] and examine and say, "Here it is." And
[48:30] all of a sudden,
[48:32] you can walk on water.
[48:36] Can we walk on? Do we have enough faith
[48:37] to walk on water? Water. What's easier
[48:39] to walk on water or a body change?
[48:41] Walking on water.
[48:43] You got a better chance because you're
[48:44] still in your regular body. Thanks to
[48:46] God, we're coming. Remember, Jesus was
[48:49] operating in the old way before the
[48:52] fall.
[48:53] He was operating under a different set
[48:55] of laws. Why? Because he was faith.
[48:59] The old laws, the the fall took what?
[49:02] The fall took our revelation of who we
[49:04] are and our dominion.
[49:07] We can walk on water. You can walk on
[49:10] water.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Can we just go do it? No. You've got to
[49:14] be led to do it. It'll be at the right
[49:16] time. It'll write the mode. Saints of
[49:17] God, if you're being chased at this last
[49:19] moment, because brother said, he said
[49:20] they'll hunt you down. If you're being
[49:21] chased and there's a mountain before
[49:23] you, if there's an obstacle before you,
[49:25] at that time, says the Holy Ghost, the
[49:27] anointing will strike you and you will
[49:29] speak the word and you'll run right
[49:30] through it.
[49:32] You have to you have to expect these
[49:34] things,
[49:36] but you have to be re it has to be real
[49:38] what you will not see death once it's
[49:40] revealed that you can't die, that you
[49:42] are not going to die, that you are
[49:44] rapture bound, that you are the bride of
[49:46] Jesus Christ, saints of God, at that
[49:47] time everything will be at your
[49:50] disposal.
[49:52] what you need will be there at the right
[49:55] time, at the right moment, in the right
[49:57] situation.
[49:59] He says, "And omitted the weightier
[50:00] matters of the law." He says, "Judgment,
[50:02] mercy," he says, "and faith." Now, look
[50:05] at this. The weightier matters. He says,
[50:07] "The words of the scribes," notice,
[50:09] notice this was the condition.
[50:12] I don't know if you remember when I
[50:13] taught on the the the seven seven types
[50:16] of Pharisees here. It was like five
[50:18] years ago, maybe six, seven years ago. I
[50:20] preached on the the seven types of
[50:22] Pharisees
[50:23] in the time of Jesus's Jesus's day.
[50:28] This was the mentality of the Jews.
[50:32] The words of the scribes, all of them
[50:35] are weighty.
[50:37] And that the sayings of the elders are
[50:40] more weighty than the words of the
[50:41] prophets.
[50:45] What was their condition?
[50:48] Whatever their scribes and priests said
[50:51] was greater than the word of God. It was
[50:54] heavier. They could read the Lord is my
[50:57] shepherd. I shall not weep. But when the
[50:58] pro prophet says or like this when the
[51:00] pastor or the the scribe says you know
[51:02] what at this time such and such and such
[51:05] or remember when this or this and
[51:07] Jehovah did this they will like hold to
[51:09] that saying it'll be like this is the
[51:11] greatest revelation ever instead of just
[51:13] taking the simple word of God.
[51:16] I wonder if we were there again. Now
[51:18] notice what is judgment. This is this is
[51:21] the way to your matters.
[51:24] And Jesus said, "I have done work and
[51:25] y'all mad y'all marvel." Moses therefore
[51:28] gave unto us circumcision, not because
[51:30] it is Moses, but of the fathers. And ye
[51:31] on the on the Sabbath day circumcise a
[51:34] man. If a man on the Sabbath day
[51:36] receives circumcision, that the law of
[51:38] Moses should not be broken. Are you
[51:40] angry at me because I have every made
[51:42] every man every made a man everywhere
[51:44] whole on the Sabbath day. Judge not
[51:47] according to the appearance. This is
[51:48] when Jesus healed the the man on the
[51:50] Sabbath day, right? And you're not
[51:51] supposed to do any work on the Sabbath
[51:52] day. What did Jesus do that was work?
[51:55] He just spoke the word. Is there
[51:57] anything in the law that says you can't
[51:58] speak on the Sabbath?
[52:00] No. You just can't work. You can only go
[52:03] so far this way and do this and that.
[52:05] And he says, "Judge not according to the
[52:09] appearance." He says, "But judge
[52:11] righteous judgment."
[52:14] In other words, what what takes how does
[52:15] what do you need to to have judgment?
[52:18] Discernment.
[52:20] Here's Solomon.
[52:23] Each of the harlot said, "That's my
[52:25] baby. That's my baby."
[52:28] That's a tough call. Who do you give it
[52:31] to? Both are saying looking you right in
[52:34] the eyes looking you straight face to
[52:36] the king said that's my baby right there
[52:38] that's my baby the other one says don't
[52:40] listen to him her that's my baby
[52:43] and now it takes the sermon Solomon knew
[52:46] the love of a mother he talked about his
[52:49] own mother he knew the love of a mother
[52:51] the love the mother would give anything
[52:53] to save that baby's life
[52:56] he said guards send me a bring me a
[52:58] sword
[53:00] both women are
[53:01] what is he going to do? He says, "All
[53:04] right, you both want it. I'm going to
[53:05] cut this baby in half. You can share
[53:08] it."
[53:10] And a real mother's heart, the real
[53:12] mother said, "Don't kill that baby. Give
[53:16] it to her." And by that confession,
[53:19] she knew she was the mother.
[53:25] Judge not according to appearance. To
[53:28] Solomon looked like both were mothers.
[53:30] both wanted that baby. But you have to
[53:31] have righteous judgment which takes
[53:34] discernment. Let me I've you know what
[53:36] I've noticed here is this next set of
[53:38] scriptures is very very important.
[53:43] Judge not lest you be judged. For with
[53:45] what judgment ye judge ye shall be
[53:47] judged and with what measure ye meet it
[53:50] shall be judged unto you again.
[53:55] I know of a situation right now
[54:00] We had or I seen a brother come in
[54:05] brand new outside like this. He thought
[54:06] he was a a Christian but he was very
[54:09] very green
[54:11] and he he struggled to go to church. He
[54:14] was sometimes he'd come in then he'd
[54:15] walk out and come in and walk out.
[54:17] Anybody seen that before?
[54:19] And a brother the church corrected him
[54:21] say brother you better be coming to the
[54:23] house of God. You better stay in church.
[54:26] Well, another brother heard that,
[54:28] stopped me, said, "Brother, so and so
[54:30] put him in line."
[54:32] And I'm looking at this man, and I'm
[54:35] thinking, "You skipped an entire year of
[54:38] church himself."
[54:44] You know what it takes to you know how
[54:46] you discern correctly?
[54:48] Why consider thou the moat is in thy
[54:50] brother's eye, but considerest not the
[54:53] beam that is in thine own eye? Before
[54:56] you make a call on anyone or anything,
[55:00] I was like this, don't even make a call.
[55:03] But if you have to call, if you have to
[55:04] discern between this and this,
[55:07] you have to make sure you are clean. Are
[55:10] you very, are you guilty of the very
[55:11] same thing you're making call on? And
[55:14] you have to look and examine yourself.
[55:15] You have to know your thoughts. You know
[55:17] the thoughts and intents of your heart.
[55:19] God knows the thoughts and intents of
[55:20] your heart. You've got to know yourself
[55:24] and be honest.
[55:26] Am I guilty of what I'm saying about
[55:28] this brother or not? Is there anything
[55:31] in my life that's hindering me? I'll say
[55:32] it like this. If you don't know, ask
[55:35] someone. Brother,
[55:38] I need you to tell me something, okay?
[55:39] Can you be honest with me? He'll be
[55:41] like, absolutely not. Is do you see any
[55:44] fault in my life? And the brother say,
[55:46] "Brother Simon, no." Or he'll say,
[55:49] "Well, you could work on this." And I'd
[55:51] be like, "Thank you. Is there anything
[55:52] else?" Well, you know, since you're
[55:54] since we're talking about it. Oh, yeah.
[55:57] This side of you and this and this,
[55:58] this. And I was like, "Thank you,
[56:00] brother." And then now, no, notice he's
[56:02] on the outside looking at me. Me, I only
[56:05] see what I can see. There is things
[56:08] about me that is not good, right? Any
[56:11] any perfect ones among us? But if this
[56:13] brother can tell me my faults that I
[56:15] don't know I'm doing, then I can get
[56:17] myself cleaned out and say then you can
[56:19] what? Repent and I can say, brother,
[56:22] thank you so much for watching over your
[56:23] brother.
[56:27] He says, why consider thou the beam in
[56:29] thy brothers in thy my brother's eyes,
[56:31] but consider not the beam in thine own
[56:33] eyes? How wilt or how wilt thou say to
[56:36] thy brother, let me pull out the moat
[56:39] out of thine thine eye, and behold, a
[56:41] beam is thine own eye.
[56:45] What is what does Jesus called this?
[56:47] Hypocrisy,
[56:48] hypocrite. Thou hypocrite, first cast
[56:51] out the beam out of thine own eye. You
[56:54] must better repent. Anything you're
[56:56] going to call out, you better repent.
[56:58] And then thou shalt see clearly.
[57:02] You want to see clear about your brother
[57:04] and sisters and see make sure you are
[57:06] clean
[57:08] &gt;&gt; before you make a correction. Say, "Oh,
[57:10] I see this brother doing this and oh
[57:12] man, you better make sure you are
[57:14] clean."
[57:16] &gt;&gt; See, that's why it's so important for us
[57:17] to walk in here and out there as sons
[57:22] and daughters of God.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Because what we should have the
[57:25] revelation that God, that Jesus Christ
[57:27] is watching everything. Everything's
[57:29] being recorded. every action, every
[57:32] word, and definitely every thought.
[57:34] Right?
[57:36] We've got to be clean.
[57:39] First, cast out the beam of thine own
[57:40] eye, and thou shalt see clearly to cast
[57:42] out the moat out of thy brother's eye.
[57:47] Now, what is a moat or a beam? He says,
[57:50] what is the moat? He says, "Mo is meant
[57:52] by any little bit of straw or small
[57:55] splinter of wood that flies into the eye
[57:57] and does it damage, hinders its sight
[57:59] and gives it pain and designs uh designs
[58:03] little sins comparatively speaking such
[58:05] as youthful follyies, human frailties
[58:07] and infirmities in inadvertences and
[58:09] impudences which have uh which may he
[58:12] says said to be the light faults in
[58:15] comparison to others and though not be
[58:17] vindicated or continually in yet not be
[58:20] severely looked upon chast uh and
[58:22] chastise to scrutinize diligently into
[58:26] aggravate, dwell upon and sharply
[58:28] reprove the lightly the lighter faults
[58:31] of others is is in is a conduct. In
[58:33] other words, get the little things out
[58:35] of your life first. Little foxes spoil
[58:38] the vine.
[58:40] the little foxes, the little things. The
[58:43] devil doesn't care if Malachi is not
[58:46] gonna have You think the devil's gonna
[58:48] be like on the job, you know, this one
[58:50] Amish guy is over here. Hey, let's go
[58:52] out to the barn tonight and drink up.
[58:54] You think that's going to stumble him?
[58:57] Absolutely not. But it'll be a little
[58:58] maybe a little thing. Hey, see that nice
[59:02] little uh electric uh rough nailer? Just
[59:06] take it. Take it home, man. He doesn't
[59:08] want it. Just take it home. It's all
[59:09] yours. That's a little bit easier
[59:11] temptation than saying, "Let's go get
[59:13] drunk tonight in the old Amish barn.
[59:18] It's the little things." Right
[59:21] now, the beam is what? The bigger
[59:23] things, the greater sins, uh, grosser
[59:26] abominations, which what were what the
[59:28] Pharisees were guilty. Now, what's
[59:29] mercy?
[59:32] Let me just jump here. We're almost to
[59:34] an hour. Let me jump here. What is
[59:36] What's the Let me see. Mercy. The
[59:38] difference between grace and mercy in
[59:40] the Bible can be summed up uh summarized
[59:42] as follows. Mercy is defined as not
[59:45] receiving the punishment we deserve for
[59:48] our sins.
[59:50] In other words, brother Simon, you did
[59:52] this and this. I forgive you, but that's
[59:54] it.
[59:56] While grace is unmmerited favor that God
[1:00:00] bestows upon us.
[1:00:03] We want both grace and mercy.
[1:00:10] giving us blessings we do not deserve.
[1:00:13] So grace is a further step past mercy.
[1:00:17] Has not even has not he g us mercy?
[1:00:19] Absolutely. We're all guilty. What? He
[1:00:21] came and died for our sins. And then
[1:00:22] what? Then by grace he's given us
[1:00:24] everything.
[1:00:27] And of course faith here but without
[1:00:28] faith is impossible to please him. Amen.
[1:00:31] Let me let me round up here wrap up here
[1:00:32] by God's grace.
[1:00:38] 2 Corinthians 6:14,
[1:00:41] "Be not unequally yolked together with
[1:00:43] unbelievers. For what fellowship hath
[1:00:45] righteous with unrighteousness? And what
[1:00:47] communion hath light with darkness? And
[1:00:49] what concord hath Christ with bile? Or
[1:00:52] what partath he that hath believeth in
[1:00:54] an infidel? And what agreement hath the
[1:00:56] temple of God with idols?" Are you not
[1:00:58] the temple of God? You are the temple of
[1:01:00] God. Saints of God, what's that uh
[1:01:02] what's that song? The dusty Bibles. They
[1:01:04] said, "We're going to lay these idols
[1:01:05] down.
[1:01:15] This is the biggest hindrance
[1:01:18] to the bride of Jesus Christ right now.
[1:01:22] I just saw someone put their cell stop
[1:01:25] their cell phone for like four or five
[1:01:27] months.
[1:01:29] Completely got rid of it. Couldn't call.
[1:01:31] Couldn't do anything. Now he just gets
[1:01:34] it. And I heard that he's just
[1:01:38] hooked right back up with it.
[1:01:41] There's something about this.
[1:01:43] This is a very dangerous
[1:01:46] tool.
[1:01:48] Does this come from the tree of life or
[1:01:49] the tree of knowledge, good and evil?
[1:01:51] This comes from the tree of knowledge of
[1:01:54] good and evil.
[1:01:58] This
[1:02:00] is a very This is the most dangerous
[1:02:02] thing, saints.
[1:02:03] Keep your guard on this.
[1:02:07] Go in every week. How much time do you
[1:02:09] have on your Bible and the message and
[1:02:11] check other things, right?
[1:02:14] Wherefore come out from among them and
[1:02:16] be separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch
[1:02:19] not the unclean thing. Now notice,
[1:02:24] it's amazing how the phones now you have
[1:02:26] to you just touch. Back in my day, you
[1:02:29] had to reach out. I mean, you're
[1:02:31] touching it, but then you have to spin
[1:02:32] the rotary. Remember rotary dials?
[1:02:34] Anybody remember dial rotaries? Oh,
[1:02:35] yeah.
[1:02:38] These are
[1:02:42] therefore come out from among them and
[1:02:44] be separate, say the Lord, and touch not
[1:02:46] the unclean thing, and I will receive
[1:02:48] you.
[1:02:50] But you know what happened with that
[1:02:51] brother that did away with his cell
[1:02:52] phone for four months? the presence of
[1:02:55] God was in his house
[1:02:59] because my pastor told me
[1:03:02] went over there and said, "Brother," I
[1:03:03] felt the presence of God the whole time,
[1:03:10] "and will be a father unto you, and ye
[1:03:12] shall be my sons and daughters, saith
[1:03:14] the Lord Almighty."
[1:03:18] What was the whole point of this? What
[1:03:19] was the whole point of the Ten
[1:03:20] Commandments?
[1:03:23] Moses went up there, got two tables of
[1:03:25] tablets of stone. God says, "Thou shalt
[1:03:28] have no other god. Thou shalt not make
[1:03:29] an image. Thou shalt not this. Thou
[1:03:31] shalt not this." What was what was God
[1:03:33] trying to say? Remember when Moses came
[1:03:35] down, God said, "You mind go check on
[1:03:36] your boys, your people down there."
[1:03:37] Moses comes down with these two tablets
[1:03:39] and he sees the people in complete
[1:03:41] disarray, complete worshiping the devil.
[1:03:43] And he throws those tablets down. The
[1:03:46] word was lost.
[1:03:48] The word was broken. And God said,
[1:03:51] "Okay, we've got to have those
[1:03:53] restored." He says, "Now you go make two
[1:03:55] tablets and bring them up to me and I'll
[1:03:57] write it again."
[1:03:59] Do you remember that second encounter
[1:04:01] with God? Look what takes place here.
[1:04:06] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Take the
[1:04:08] hee," now it's he's got to make these
[1:04:10] tablets. He thee two tables of stone
[1:04:12] like un the first, and I'll write upon
[1:04:14] these tables the words which were in the
[1:04:16] first tables which thou breakest. He's
[1:04:18] got to rewrite the word. But notice he's
[1:04:20] coming down. Now look at here in verse
[1:04:23] 5. And the Lord descended in the cloud
[1:04:24] and stood with him there and proclaimed
[1:04:27] the name of the Lord. What was the name
[1:04:30] given
[1:04:31] in this name? What was given? What was
[1:04:33] God revealing in the name? The Lord, the
[1:04:35] Lord God, merciful,
[1:04:37] gracious, long-suffering, abundant in in
[1:04:42] goodness and truth. He's bringing all
[1:04:44] keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
[1:04:46] iniquity, transgressions. Now why? Okay.
[1:04:48] What was he trying to reveal? If you
[1:04:49] look at further down in the scripture,
[1:04:55] thou shalt worship no other god, for the
[1:04:57] Lord thy God whose name is jealous. You
[1:05:01] know why the ten commands were given?
[1:05:02] Because God chose them and he wanted
[1:05:05] them to himself.
[1:05:08] The entire Bible is for what? Because
[1:05:10] God is a jealous God. He's a jealous
[1:05:12] husband. He wants you to himself.
[1:05:16] He wants you to spend time with him and
[1:05:18] not a cell phone. He wants you even when
[1:05:21] you're work to be so your mind so set on
[1:05:24] the word of God. Saints, he is a jealous
[1:05:27] God.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; What do you think? Remember when he
[1:05:30] taught on the the the furtheredness of
[1:05:31] the Godhead Revelations a couple weeks
[1:05:33] ago, a month ago, right? What why did he
[1:05:35] show the eyes of fire and the word
[1:05:37] coming out of the mouth? Because what?
[1:05:38] He's a jealous God.
[1:05:40] He wants all of you.
[1:05:43] Amen.
[1:05:45] Amen. Now, almost done here.
[1:05:51] I want to show you this here by God's
[1:05:53] grace. Just something real fast here as
[1:05:55] we close.
[1:05:58] In John two,
[1:06:01] remember brother said, he says, "God is
[1:06:03] only obligated to come to you one time."
[1:06:08] Now, how many has given Who's been given
[1:06:09] more than one time? I've been given
[1:06:12] thousand saints
[1:06:14] that all I can say is I must be bride
[1:06:16] because
[1:06:18] anyhow
[1:06:19] we're believer right
[1:06:21] this is early in his ministry he comes
[1:06:23] to the house of God he comes to the
[1:06:26] temple and he found the temple of those
[1:06:29] that sold oxen and sheep and doves and
[1:06:31] money changers uh changers of money
[1:06:34] sitting and when they made a scourge of
[1:06:35] small small quarts he drove them out of
[1:06:37] the temple and the sheep and the oxen
[1:06:39] poured out the changers of money and
[1:06:40] overthrew the temple temples. And look
[1:06:41] what he says. And he said to them that
[1:06:43] sold doves, "Take these things hence.
[1:06:45] Make not my father's house a house of
[1:06:47] merchandise." What did he do? He
[1:06:49] destroyed it. He said, "Get my house in
[1:06:51] order."
[1:06:53] And he cleaned it up.
[1:06:58] At the end of his ministry,
[1:07:04] Jesus comes again to the temple. After
[1:07:07] three years, he revisits the temple.
[1:07:10] This time he's riding uh upon an ass, a
[1:07:13] a colt of a foul of an ass coming as
[1:07:16] what? The king
[1:07:18] and he enters in the same temple and
[1:07:21] does the exact same thing.
[1:07:25] But after three years, now notice God in
[1:07:27] flesh comes down says, "Clean my house."
[1:07:30] He was zealous for the Lord. He said,
[1:07:31] "Clean my house up." Saints of God, "Are
[1:07:33] not we the temple of God? Are we not the
[1:07:35] house of God? Let's clean our houses
[1:07:37] up." Why? because one time he's coming
[1:07:39] for the last time.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; This is his last time at the temple.
[1:07:44] He's looking and what does he encounter,
[1:07:46] saints? They went right back to the
[1:07:49] exact same thing.
[1:07:54] And he sold bought the temp uh bought
[1:07:57] the temple and overthrew the tables, the
[1:07:58] money changers, seats. They were in the
[1:08:00] exact same place, same condition. They
[1:08:02] went right back to where they were at
[1:08:04] before.
[1:08:06] Do you know what this do you know what
[1:08:07] took place after this
[1:08:11] is I'll say like this this is probably
[1:08:12] the most serious part of this whole go
[1:08:14] one of them in the whole gospels
[1:08:18] because look what he does directly after
[1:08:20] this Matthew 21
[1:08:23] as soon as he gets out of the temple he
[1:08:25] got a hunger and he walks up to a fig
[1:08:27] tree and what does he do he curses the
[1:08:32] fig tree that last time in the temple
[1:08:36] was their last chance
[1:08:41] because he goes to the fig tree and
[1:08:44] curses it.
[1:08:46] Who's the fig tree?
[1:08:48] Israel,
[1:08:51] right? Directly after that, he curses
[1:08:53] the fig tree.
[1:08:56] He says, "Were he says the men ashamed?
[1:08:58] Were they dismayed and taken? Lo they've
[1:09:00] rejected the word Lord. And what wisdom
[1:09:01] is in them? He come to clean his house
[1:09:04] and they wouldn't clean it. For they
[1:09:06] have for have they healed the hurt of
[1:09:07] the people my daughter slightly saying
[1:09:09] peace peace when there's no peace. Were
[1:09:11] they ashamed when they committed
[1:09:12] abomination? Bringing that stuff right
[1:09:14] in the house of God.
[1:09:17] What are we letting in this temple? What
[1:09:19] are we letting in these eyes in these
[1:09:21] ears?
[1:09:24] Nay, they were not ashamed. In so much
[1:09:27] they were not ashamed they went back and
[1:09:29] did it. Never could they blush.
[1:09:31] Therefore, they shall fall among them
[1:09:33] that fall. In the time of their
[1:09:35] visitation shall they be cast down,
[1:09:37] sayeth the Lord. For I will surely
[1:09:40] consume them, say the Lord. There shall
[1:09:41] be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on
[1:09:44] the fig tree.
[1:09:49] Now look what the prophet says here.
[1:09:52] Remember angels which kept out their
[1:09:53] first state but were but left there in
[1:09:55] the prison house, the darkness where the
[1:09:57] world is walking today in the same
[1:09:58] prison. There's no repentance. He says,
[1:10:01] "Remember a few years ago when I went
[1:10:02] down from Chicago? Either America will
[1:10:04] receive it this year or she won't
[1:10:06] receive it all." Yeah. She's gone. Yeah.
[1:10:08] Now, I wonder if the third poll could
[1:10:11] be. What is the third poll? The third
[1:10:14] poll is the time when
[1:10:17] there's no more grace left.
[1:10:20] It's the time of what? The opening of
[1:10:22] the word. Brother said he the third pole
[1:10:24] is also ties in what? Preaching to those
[1:10:26] that are eternally lost. Now look what
[1:10:29] the prophet links to the third pole.
[1:10:32] Have you just got a couple minutes
[1:10:33] different? He says, "Let's see. Let's
[1:10:34] see. Turn. Read it." There was something
[1:10:36] I want to read just before. Now I may
[1:10:39] cut some of some of this out, but let's
[1:10:41] just get to this minute. Matthew 23.
[1:10:45] He ties in Matthew 23 to the third pole.
[1:10:49] Now notice the second time Christ went,
[1:10:54] they were completely doing the exact
[1:10:56] same thing. They did not repent. They
[1:10:58] didn't repent of all their abominations.
[1:10:59] They did not blush. Christ came and
[1:11:01] cleansed it out. He cleaned it out
[1:11:02] again. But this time, what? He healed
[1:11:04] everything.
[1:11:08] And look here.
[1:11:12] What was John the Baptist? Remember in
[1:11:14] John's 4, John 3, John 4, when the
[1:11:17] Pharisees and scribes came to John, what
[1:11:19] did John tell them?
[1:11:22] Repent and bring forth fruits of
[1:11:24] repentance. Come and get baptized. He
[1:11:26] gave them an opportunity to be saved.
[1:11:29] He gave them a chance to be saved. But
[1:11:32] after the second visitation of the
[1:11:34] temple, after he curses the fig tree,
[1:11:36] what does he tell the Pharisees and
[1:11:37] scribes?
[1:11:39] Fill ye up the measure of your fathers,
[1:11:41] ye serpents, you generation generation
[1:11:43] of vipers. How can you escape the
[1:11:45] damnation of hell? Notice the door was
[1:11:48] shut.
[1:11:50] They could no longer receive salvation.
[1:11:53] He said he he gave them no chance to
[1:11:55] repent but said how can you escape it
[1:11:59] one day saints it's going to hit that
[1:12:01] again right and we want to be ready
[1:12:03] let's uh let's stand here by God's grace
[1:12:07] remember we have to be able to discern
[1:12:10] what time it is this is going to get
[1:12:12] dark it's going to get really really
[1:12:15] dark
[1:12:18] to keep our eyes
[1:12:20] on the voice of the Lord the The voice
[1:12:23] of the Lord will always point to the
[1:12:24] word. Right?
[1:12:26] What do we have to do?
[1:12:28] Let no man deceive you with vain words.
[1:12:31] For because of these things, brother
[1:12:33] Mali, uh, sister, could you come and
[1:12:35] play? He says, let no man deceive you
[1:12:37] with vain words. For because of these
[1:12:39] things cometh the wrath of God upon the
[1:12:41] children of disobedience. What? This
[1:12:44] deception.
[1:12:46] Be not therefore partakers with them.
[1:12:48] For ye were sometimes darkness,
[1:12:51] but now ye are light in the Lord. Walk
[1:12:54] as children of light.
[1:12:59] So when we come, when we leave this
[1:13:01] place today,
[1:13:03] make sure you're back into light. Make
[1:13:07] sure you're back into the true. It's
[1:13:10] like this. If you're down, if you're
[1:13:12] out, if you're depressed, if you're
[1:13:14] nervous, if you're anxious, if you're
[1:13:16] scared, if there's fear, oh my goodness,
[1:13:18] this thing's coming. Saints of God, get
[1:13:20] back into the light.
[1:13:23] If you can get back to where there is no
[1:13:26] more darkness.
[1:13:28] And when you're in the light, you're in
[1:13:29] the presence of God.
[1:13:36] When you're in the presence of God,
[1:13:38] there's no fear. When you're presence of
[1:13:41] God, there's only love.
[1:13:45] One time I was getting ahead of myself
[1:13:47] in life and I was upset and I was kind
[1:13:50] of yelling in my spirit realm. I said,
[1:13:53] "Lord, I want I'm here, but I want to be
[1:13:55] right here."
[1:13:56] And at that moment, I was told to do
[1:13:58] something I didn't want to do. I went
[1:13:59] and did it. And as I was performing this
[1:14:02] task for my boss, I jumped off the truck
[1:14:05] and my left foot hit the side of a curb
[1:14:08] and it just went whack.
[1:14:12] I have never felt so much pain in all my
[1:14:15] life.
[1:14:18] It took an entire year to heal. Didn't
[1:14:20] even go to surgery cuz I had to pay my
[1:14:21] bills. Just limped it off, right? Took a
[1:14:23] year to heal. About that big.
[1:14:28] And as that pain was in coming and
[1:14:30] coming, I felt the presence of the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost come down.
[1:14:36] And the Lord was showing me
[1:14:39] just wait son the presence. I started
[1:14:42] crying not because of the pain but
[1:14:44] because of the presence of God. You know
[1:14:46] God knows how to correct us.
[1:14:50] A lot of times our correction our
[1:14:52] chastisements are hard lessons.
[1:14:55] I don't know about with you saints, but
[1:14:56] with me, he always deals with the
[1:14:58] physical.
[1:15:00] I was talking with my wife a couple days
[1:15:02] about six months ago, and I was kind of
[1:15:04] upset about some things here and there.
[1:15:06] And as I was speaking this thing, we
[1:15:09] were walking in dark, walking our dog,
[1:15:10] and I I sprained that ankle again, and I
[1:15:13] was like, whoa. And you know what I did?
[1:15:16] I kept on talking negative. And then
[1:15:18] within three minutes, I sprained this
[1:15:20] one.
[1:15:25] Sometimes the Lord has to get these
[1:15:28] little knucklehead guys. He's got to put
[1:15:31] them in check. And as soon as I did that
[1:15:33] second ankle, I told my wife, I said,
[1:15:36] "I'm not going to say anything more."
[1:15:39] And I hobbled for another two weeks.
[1:15:42] Well, brother Sai, but that was the
[1:15:45] correction of the Lord.
[1:15:48] I know it.
[1:15:51] And this ankle, this left one is never
[1:15:53] fully healed. And every time I get that
[1:15:57] same anxiousness to where I need to do
[1:15:59] this and it's not called for me, that
[1:16:02] pain starts coming back. And I know it's
[1:16:04] the Lord telling me, "Don't do it. Don't
[1:16:08] do it."
[1:16:10] I don't know if the Lord deals with you
[1:16:11] like that, but he deals with me like
[1:16:13] that. Chastisement. But if we can endure
[1:16:16] the chastisement of the Lord, we'll be
[1:16:19] all right.
[1:16:21] Saints of God, one more scripture here.
[1:16:26] If we say that we have fellowship with
[1:16:27] him and walk in darkness, we lie and do
[1:16:30] not the truth. But if we walk in the
[1:16:32] light as he is in the light, we have
[1:16:35] fellowship with one another. And the
[1:16:38] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:16:40] us from all sin.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Stay away from anything confusing.
[1:16:46] Stay away from anything that brings
[1:16:48] darkness,
[1:16:50] that brings uh misunderstanding, that
[1:16:53] brings discord among brothers and
[1:16:55] sisters. Saints of God, stay in the
[1:16:58] word.
[1:17:00] When we talk, talk the word.
[1:17:04] Let's say me and this brother sit down
[1:17:05] after this or we talk and I'm just
[1:17:07] sitting there. I really don't know this
[1:17:08] brother. He probably doesn't really know
[1:17:09] me.
[1:17:11] What should I say,
[1:17:14] brother? You know, I heard this quote or
[1:17:16] I read in the scripture about the Bible
[1:17:19] said this and the Bible said that or the
[1:17:20] prophet said this. What do you think?
[1:17:23] Bring something spiritual to the table.
[1:17:26] Strike up a spiritual conversation.
[1:17:29] Talk about the word. If you talk about
[1:17:31] him, he will draw nigh unto you. He is a
[1:17:35] jealous God. Am I talking about work too
[1:17:37] much? Am I talking about this problem or
[1:17:40] the assassination?
[1:17:43] Talk about the Lord.
[1:17:46] Amen. All hearts, minds clear. I hope
[1:17:48] this wasn't too too too rough for too
[1:17:50] whatever.
[1:17:52] Remember, it's going to get dark. We had
[1:17:56] better have our eyes clear. To see
[1:17:59] clearly, saints, live clean, live holy,
[1:18:03] look at one another with the blood of
[1:18:06] Jesus Christ in our eyes. Amen. Let's
[1:18:07] bow our heads. If you have need of
[1:18:09] prayer, saints, I'd be happy to pray
[1:18:10] with you. Let's just bow our heads.
[1:18:14] Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, Lord, this was on
[1:18:16] my heart, Lord, this morning. Can we
[1:18:19] discern what is holy and what's profane,
[1:18:22] God? What's right, what's wrong, Lord?
[1:18:26] Do we call things evil that are good and
[1:18:29] things that are good evil? Lord Jesus,
[1:18:32] Lord, we want to be right, God. But
[1:18:34] Lord, the only way we can be remain in
[1:18:36] your presence, God, Lord, is to walk
[1:18:38] with you, Lord. To talk with you, to
[1:18:40] seek you, God, to find you, Lord God.
[1:18:42] Lord, ready, Lord, to to lay down all of
[1:18:45] our wills, God, to lay down everything
[1:18:46] that we are, everything, God must be
[1:18:49] about you, Lord. Help us, God. Lord,
[1:18:53] Lord, we know you have grace, God, but
[1:18:56] Lord, we don't want to sin and make it
[1:18:58] disgrace, Lord, for certainly want to
[1:19:00] please you. We want to be we want to
[1:19:02] love you with all of our hearts, minds,
[1:19:03] bodies, and souls, Lord. Lord, just
[1:19:06] bless the people, Lord. I know it was a
[1:19:07] little cut up, Lord God, or maybe a
[1:19:08] little long or uh but Lord Jesus, Lord,
[1:19:12] we did our best, Lord, to yield. And
[1:19:14] Lord, we want to give you all the
[1:19:15] praise, glory, and honor, Lord. Bless
[1:19:17] the people, God, in the name of Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ. Amen.
