[39:45] air and father were
[39:47] very grateful for that Lord teach us
[39:48] today remind us of your promises and
[39:51] speak thy truth to us in Jesus Christ's
[39:53] name
[39:54] the church said Amen god bless you bein
[39:56] seated praise God
[39:57] I do have quotes today Lydia so we can
[39:59] pull those up here so I had some time to
[40:06] put some quotes together so you can see
[40:09] him how many like reading the quotes you
[40:11] like reading the quotes amen and I
[40:12] always do that I just think it's just a
[40:14] tremendous blessing to be able to see
[40:17] you exactly what brother Branham said I
[40:18] found it helpful to you know sometimes
[40:20] to go back and listen to how he preached
[40:22] him some of these will see today some of
[40:26] them they seem kind of harsh but if you
[40:28] listen to him he says it with a lot of
[40:30] love
[40:30] so while we're here let's just read a
[40:33] few I'm gonna just go over to the
[40:36] scripture let's go to proverbs 30 if you
[40:38] got your Bibles of course you can or you
[40:40] can read it up here I know I want to
[40:42] just lay this in here have these these
[40:45] these things kind of came on my mind
[40:47] just now so I want to pull them up we're
[40:50] gonna be looking of course at thus saith
[40:52] the Lord I'm gonna take the text up a
[40:55] little bit here that's all better don't
[40:59] look at these two quotes or these two
[41:01] scriptures rather not it's kind of small
[41:02] let me make it a little bigger here I'll
[41:04] just go max it out here okay I want to
[41:11] look at these here the Bible says in
[41:12] proverbs 30 verse five and six every
[41:15] word of God is pure
[41:16] he's a shield unto them that put their
[41:19] trust in him now look at the warning add
[41:22] down not unto his words lest he reprove
[41:26] thee and thou be found a liar
[41:31] we're you know I don't know if everybody
[41:32] heard Wednesday night's service but it
[41:34] was just we're looking at statements
[41:36] where brother Branham we believe God's
[41:39] prophet said thus saith the Lord I want
[41:42] to look at some more of those today now
[41:45] if if brother Branham said anything that
[41:48] was thus saith the Lord outside of the
[41:50] word of God that'd be wrong but never in
[41:53] the years that I've studied brother
[41:55] Graham's message which is now coming on
[41:56] 18 years I've never heard him say thus
[41:59] saith the Lord
[42:00] and say anything wrong with it and
[42:03] that's why I believe he's a prophet but
[42:07] he's gonna make brother branham's gonna
[42:08] make some statements today through the
[42:09] preaching we'll see that that he points
[42:12] out where churches have added to the
[42:14] Bible and almost every church does this
[42:17] that's why most churches are not led of
[42:20] the Holy Spirit because they either add
[42:23] to the Bible and say well we should
[42:25] believe this or they take away from the
[42:28] Bible now we try to be and I know many
[42:31] churches say this I know there's
[42:32] millions of churches that say this but
[42:34] we try to really live it we don't try to
[42:37] add anything to the Bible or take
[42:39] anything away we just try to believe
[42:41] everything that's in here I know a lot
[42:43] of people say that but but if you start
[42:45] talking to him you're gonna find out
[42:46] that they do add to the word and they do
[42:48] take away from the word but we try not
[42:50] to do any of that because we know God is
[42:53] going to correct everyone who does and
[42:55] they're gonna be liars they're gonna be
[42:57] found liars if they did it maliciously
[42:58] now don't everybody will do it
[43:00] maliciously but many people do it
[43:03] maliciously in order to gain big
[43:05] churches or money or popularity or all
[43:07] these things but we do not and so the
[43:11] warnings in the Bible if you add to
[43:14] God's Word he's gonna call you a liar
[43:17] and we don't want to be liars we want to
[43:19] tell the truth now the Bible ends with
[43:22] the warning in revelation 22:18 the
[43:24] Bible ends with the same warning and so
[43:28] I want to pull it up here for I testify
[43:31] unto every man that heareth the words of
[43:33] the prophecy of this book If any man
[43:36] shall add unto these things God shall
[43:38] add unto Him the plagues that are
[43:40] written in this book
[43:41] now church sometimes those plagues
[43:44] happen while people are on the earth and
[43:46] they go through awful diseases or they
[43:48] go through awful situations but
[43:52] sometimes the people that add to the
[43:55] Word of God don't experience those
[43:57] plagues in this lifetime but they will
[43:59] experience them later when they're
[44:01] judged we'd say something the Bible said
[44:04] some men's sins go before them we know
[44:07] it in the book of first John some follow
[44:09] after and so some people won't
[44:12] experience that till after
[44:14] now look at verse 19 If any man shall
[44:17] take away from the words of the book of
[44:19] the prophecy God shall take away his
[44:21] part out of the book of life and out of
[44:24] the holy city and from the things which
[44:26] are written in this book
[44:28] now that's very very dangerous if you
[44:30] say well that's in the Bible but you
[44:32] don't have to live it or that's not
[44:34] required anymore God has the warning
[44:37] here that he'll take your name off the
[44:39] book of life if you take anything out of
[44:41] the Bible so we don't want to add
[44:43] anything we don't want to take anything
[44:45] away we just want to meet God's
[44:46] requirement and do exactly what the
[44:48] Bible says
[44:49] and Jesus said surely I come quickly now
[44:53] here's what we all need
[44:54] even so let the grace of our Lord Jesus
[44:56] be with us amen
[44:57] how many trust in an amazing grace
[45:00] that's right so we have this great
[45:02] warning we cannot add to the Bible or
[45:05] take away so as we look at this message
[45:08] here we have thus saith the Lord as we
[45:13] look at this brother branham made many
[45:16] statements with thus saith the Lord in
[45:17] fact over 3,200 of them I've gone
[45:20] through all of them and I pulled out the
[45:22] ones that apply to the US now many of
[45:25] those most of those probably 3,000 of
[45:27] those applied to people in the prayer
[45:29] lines he would tell them thus saith the
[45:31] Lord or or maybe he was just teaching
[45:33] and said well you know this prophet said
[45:34] thus saith the Lord but I tried to pull
[45:37] out the ones that apply to us so we can
[45:39] make sure that we not only know thus
[45:42] saith the Lord but that we actually obey
[45:44] thus saith the Lord that's what we want
[45:46] to do how many one obey thus saith the
[45:47] Lord
[45:48] you know Ezekiel was the one in the
[45:50] Bible who said it most often of course
[45:52] all the prophets would say in the name
[45:54] of the Lord or thus saith the Lord
[45:55] but Ezekiel was the one who sent the
[45:57] most he said it over a hundred times
[46:00] thus saith the Lord the Lord tells me
[46:02] this the Lord tells me that that's why
[46:04] when we sing that song we sing these are
[46:06] the days of Elijah these are the days of
[46:08] Ezekiel amen because we've lived in a
[46:11] day where we've had a prophet a man
[46:13] named William Branham stand and say thus
[46:15] saith the Lord and you don't hear many
[46:17] people say that but we've Adam we've
[46:20] received a prophet that said thus saith
[46:22] the Lord and so I've just had all my
[46:24] heart to go back over these it's been a
[46:26] I've never preached them too
[46:28] you I don't think unless it was many
[46:30] many years ago so I've just had a burden
[46:32] to go back over it we started at
[46:34] Wednesday night now in part one a
[46:36] Wednesday we showed how the church is
[46:38] built on thus saith the Lord that is our
[46:40] foundation our foundation is God's own
[46:43] word delivered to us that's our
[46:46] foundation and we won over three of
[46:48] William branham's prophecies that are
[46:50] fulfilled or in the process of coming to
[46:53] pass we know we went over prophecies
[46:56] about the United States how the United
[46:58] States will not see a national revival
[47:00] there's no more national revival for the
[47:02] United States it's just little
[47:03] individual groups or little individuals
[47:06] that God is going to save they'll have
[47:08] revivals in fact they're part of the
[47:10] bride's revival but it will not be
[47:12] revival on a national scale that's
[47:15] nowhere in the scripture she's already
[47:17] had her chance and she took it down in
[47:21] 1933 William Brennan had seven major
[47:23] visions he said they were thus saith the
[47:25] Lord it seems like four or five of them
[47:27] have already come to pass and so there's
[47:30] remaining ones that are coming to pass
[47:33] and brother Branham said tight clothing
[47:35] so women that are dressed immorally or
[47:38] that's the devil's tool and of course
[47:39] that applies to men as well because men
[47:41] can be objects of sexual desire as well
[47:44] so any person would tight clothing
[47:46] showing off their body there are the
[47:48] devil's tool they're dressing in
[47:50] modestly because the Bible said we must
[47:52] dress modestly so we covered that on
[47:56] Wednesday now let me see real quick
[47:59] church if I can pull up those seven
[48:02] major visions I think I preached down at
[48:05] Habakkuk it just kind of came to me I
[48:07] see can I pull it up okay it's not under
[48:10] that one what was the title of that
[48:12] sermon
[48:12] anybody remember that it's been a couple
[48:15] years since I preached that let me look
[48:20] for it real quick is that okay can I
[48:21] look for a real quick I just I know I
[48:23] don't think tiny has ever seen have you
[48:25] ever seen the seven major visions Tonya
[48:27] okay
[48:27] God gave brother Branham seven major
[48:29] visions in 1933 let me see if I can pull
[48:32] it up real quick and if not I'll to do
[48:35] it next week what was the name of that
[48:40] message nobody can remember huh it's
[48:49] worse when I can't remember that's the
[48:51] worst part when I can't remember the
[48:52] name of that I because I appreciate in
[48:54] Iowa as well and I preached it here I
[48:58] feel like I'm getting closer there it is
[49:02] seven major visions that would've been a
[49:04] good term to search under seven major
[49:06] visions it's gonna take a minute to load
[49:09] but in 1933 had seven major visions they
[49:13] were so outrageous and specific that
[49:17] people and his church wanted to kick him
[49:19] out of the church brother Branham said
[49:20] they wanted to call the cops
[49:23] brother Graham said that so let me show
[49:28] those here yeah I appreciate out of
[49:29] habakkuk that's right yeah here they are
[49:36] so brother Branham in 1933 he foresaw
[49:39] Mussolini invading Ethiopia and that
[49:43] came to pass he he foresaw Hitler and
[49:46] the rise and death of Hitler and the
[49:49] building of the Siegfried line
[49:50] he saw fascism Nazism turning into
[49:53] communism he saw advances in science now
[49:56] that's why I said some of these I feel
[49:58] like he said all he said five of them
[50:00] already come to pass but then in 64 he
[50:03] said they don't have the roads yet for
[50:06] the autonomous cars so I believe you
[50:11] were still waiting on part of the fourth
[50:13] and fifth here to happen but he said and
[50:17] science would advance so much until he
[50:19] saw in America he saw driverless cars
[50:22] and he saw a family on beautiful
[50:23] highways playing a game or checkers of
[50:26] some sort on an autonomous car in the
[50:29] United States I believe this last part
[50:32] is still to be fulfilled the fifth
[50:35] vision was the moral problem centering
[50:38] around women where they would almost go
[50:40] to a straight a state of undress so we
[50:43] see that you know women dressing so
[50:45] morally today now brother Rams I thought
[50:48] it was be Hillier
[50:49] Clinton would be president but she
[50:50] wasn't that's why I put her picture
[50:52] there I thought she'd win but she did Oh
[50:53] hit brother madam said there's gonna be
[50:56] a woman that the nation of United States
[50:58] will bow to he said it's either a
[51:00] president vice president or it's the
[51:02] Roman Catholic Church so the the America
[51:05] is going to bow to some woman now I made
[51:07] that last year I thought a couple years
[51:09] ago but it wasn't Hillary Clinton and
[51:12] the seventh and final vision was a bomb
[51:15] exploding in the US and brother RAM saw
[51:17] craters the United States and smoke
[51:19] rising so those were the seven major
[51:22] visions he said they were thus saith the
[51:24] Lord so he knew if all these had come to
[51:26] pass
[51:27] the rest are gonna come to pass and I
[51:29] believe the rest are gonna come to pass
[51:30] as well so that was the the vision from
[51:33] 33 so she hoped I wasn't so bad to wait
[51:36] for that I just want to pull that up so
[51:37] I could show it all right now I want to
[51:42] and then I closed Wednesday by showing
[51:45] that revival only comes through prayer
[51:48] that's thus saith the Lord brother BAM
[51:50] tells us that so I want to read these to
[51:52] you again because Church going forward
[51:55] if we want a revival we've got to get
[51:57] back to more prayer amen I know that's
[51:59] hard to say and it's easy to preach but
[52:01] it's harder to do how many can say amen
[52:05] to that
[52:05] because he said as the devil looked down
[52:07] said I've got a chance now they've gone
[52:09] off without him that's horse marrying
[52:10] Joseph when they left Jerusalem without
[52:12] Jesus he said if he can just get the
[52:14] Pentecostal church to start thinking
[52:16] more of their buildings and their
[52:18] well-dressed congregations then they do
[52:20] an old-fashioned prayer meeting and
[52:22] tarring meeting and the baptism of the
[52:24] holy ghost and a godly life and clean up
[52:27] their women and clean up their men make
[52:28] them live holy and either toe the mark
[52:30] or get out and not put so much on money
[52:33] or more money and raising the first
[52:36] thing you know they're gonna find going
[52:37] off without Christ again brother sister
[52:40] you remember this thus saith the Lord
[52:42] the church better clean up you're
[52:44] drifting too far out come back to the
[52:46] Lord come back to real prayer meetings
[52:51] Church this don't mean we have to pray
[52:53] all night necessarily but it means we
[52:55] got to really pray with real sincerity
[52:58] and we have to have more emphasis on
[53:01] prayer than
[53:02] on buildings on our clothes and on money
[53:05] we gotta have the most emphasis on
[53:07] prayer amen
[53:09] Laura have said see now here's another
[53:12] one when they begin to dig they dug
[53:14] right against things they just throwed
[53:16] it out and they made big ditches this is
[53:17] in the time of Jehoshaphat the next
[53:21] morning the enemy looked out the Sun
[53:23] come up and it looked like blood they
[53:24] said well they fallen on one another
[53:26] they killed each other in a way they
[53:28] went and they were ambushed and they
[53:29] said this is just the light thing before
[53:32] the Lord send forth his water and they
[53:35] went over into the other land they
[53:37] stepped I'm sorry and they stopped up
[53:39] every well they cut down every tree they
[53:41] just had a real old-fashioned revival
[53:44] and when it gets to the place that the
[53:46] people that love God will throw
[53:48] everything they got right into the
[53:50] revival with prayer with everything else
[53:53] and see God's face and pray and seek God
[53:56] and call out in the hours of the night
[53:58] for mercy and get the neighbors saved
[54:00] and so forth I'll tell you will stop the
[54:02] mouth of every critic will knock down
[54:04] every formal thing that's standing up
[54:06] they'll have to know that God's been the
[54:08] camp that's right
[54:09] friends we'll never do it until that
[54:12] thing takes place
[54:13] we can't that's the way of revival for
[54:15] thus saith the Lord said Elijah spoke in
[54:18] the name of the Lord so brother man
[54:20] takes Elijah's physical digging of wells
[54:24] and said we'll never have that until we
[54:28] give we put everything on the way and
[54:30] just give ourselves to prayer and the
[54:33] Word of God amen
[54:35] we'll never do it when ever until we
[54:38] really pray until we want to see the
[54:40] neighbor save until we pray until we see
[54:43] somebody saved on our job will never
[54:45] have the revival until we pray more
[54:48] hallelujah that's why I keep encouraging
[54:51] the church come to church early to pray
[54:53] or stay after and pray prayer is the key
[54:56] and it's not the say Jesse it's thus
[54:58] saith the Lord hallelujah there's got to
[55:02] be a return the people of God have to
[55:04] feel it you have to feel it I have to
[55:06] feel it
[55:07] we have to repeat we have to feel a pull
[55:09] to return to prayer and like Perry
[55:13] Greene said I heard on his testimony
[55:14] listen do it a few months ago
[55:16] he said people brother Perry green said
[55:18] people have said all used to be easy to
[55:20] prey Peregrine said it's never it was
[55:22] never easy to prey it was a sacrifice
[55:25] Amen hallelujah it's never going to be
[55:29] easy it's something we have to build
[55:31] into our lives and that's my prayer for
[55:32] 2019 that God will build prayer into
[55:36] your schedule into my schedule
[55:38] God will build prayer into our lives
[55:40] because it's the only way there's gonna
[55:42] be revival we can't put too much on our
[55:48] building on our clothes or on money we
[55:50] can't those things we have to have them
[55:52] we got to get new clothes every now and
[55:53] then yeah god of a building we got to
[55:55] have money but they we cannot have put
[55:58] more time on that and church only you
[56:00] only you know which one we're putting
[56:02] the most time on in your life right in
[56:03] my life alright so I'm I wanted to start
[56:09] with that one because I think it's so
[56:10] crucial I think that one I think that
[56:12] one drives the whole nature of the
[56:14] church don't you like the whole spirit
[56:16] of the in our church is driven by how
[56:18] much we pray it is because the Bible
[56:21] said you build up your faith by praying
[56:23] in the Holy Ghost let's read it I'm just
[56:25] gonna pull that up there I love that
[56:26] verse it's so I knew it was easy to find
[56:28] - right there
[56:30] I think it's 18 and 19 yeah okay there's
[56:36] mockers how that they told you there
[56:38] should be nut mockers in the last time
[56:39] who should walk out for their own godly
[56:41] lusts these be they separate themselves
[56:43] sensual not having the spirit so let me
[56:46] say like this people that leave our
[56:48] church in order to satisfy their fleshly
[56:52] lusts it's what proof they're not born
[56:54] again because we believe how many
[56:57] believe you're in the true church we
[56:59] baptized the same way Paul did we we
[57:02] pray for the Holy Ghost the same way
[57:03] Paul did we dressed the way Paul said to
[57:06] dress we do everything but Paul said
[57:09] amen so people that separate themselves
[57:12] from our teaching because it's the Bible
[57:14] teaching they're proving they're not
[57:17] mourn'd again but when you say in it it
[57:19] proves you are born again amen
[57:21] hallelujah but he said so see this is
[57:25] the way to combat getting worldly
[57:27] because he says but but
[57:29] II you're not your we're not supposed to
[57:32] be ones that are feeding the lusts of
[57:33] our flesh but you beloved those that God
[57:37] loves how many thankful God loves you
[57:39] hey man I like that song we sang on
[57:42] Wednesday anthem Jesus the anthem own of
[57:45] my heart Jesus the anchor of my soul
[57:47] that song says you call me beloved you
[57:50] call me friend God's the one that called

[59:33] one thing you can hate hating a life
[59:36] that's spotted by sin that's one thing
[59:38] you're allowed to hate you're supposed
[59:40] to love your enemies you're supposed to

[59:45] the sin that's in your life praise God
[59:52] alright so it's by prayer now when you
[1:00:02] and I are
[1:00:02] can eyes thus saith the Lord from the
[1:00:04] message of the hour God starts dealing
[1:00:07] with us but God will not deal with
[1:00:10] anyone until they do that as far as the
[1:00:13] bride now because that's what that's
[1:00:16] what that's what we're told now let's
[1:00:18] look at this that's the same thing
[1:00:20] what's happened to church we've all went
[1:00:21] to be Methodists or Baptists or
[1:00:23] Presbyterian or we've got a degree out
[1:00:25] of Harford I think you meant Harvard but
[1:00:28] Hartford might be a school as well
[1:00:30] we got a degree out of wheat and
[1:00:32] although it's at Christian College I
[1:00:33] think we got a degree out of somewhere
[1:00:35] else or Bob Jones we got a Bachelor of
[1:00:36] Art we got a DDL D D or L LD or
[1:00:40] something other what is it amounted to a
[1:00:42] bunch of nonsense it's the way it was in
[1:00:46] Egypt and God never did deal with Israel
[1:00:49] till she come to her homeland hear me
[1:00:53] thus saith the Lord God will not deal
[1:00:56] with his church till she comes back to
[1:00:58] the homeland the message of the hour
[1:01:00] come back to the original Bible on an
[1:01:04] area I'm so glad
[1:01:06] God dealeth with me amen God's not
[1:01:09] ignored it means not leaving me he's not
[1:01:11] rejecting me you know he's not grieved
[1:01:14] by my attitude God's dealing with me
[1:01:17] because I've come back to the state the
[1:01:19] Lord the message of the hour and the
[1:01:22] message is that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:25] yesterday today and forever amen the
[1:01:29] message is not just william branham is a
[1:01:31] prophet that's part of the truth but
[1:01:34] brother man said my message is Hebrews
[1:01:36] 13:8 it's about Jesus Christ being the
[1:01:39] same today amen Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:43] today and we're supposed to be Jesus
[1:01:47] Christ was skin-on praise God
[1:01:49] people are supposed we're supposed to be
[1:01:51] so much like Christ till people look at
[1:01:53] you and say mine I see Jesus Christ in
[1:01:56] you you're really led to the Holy Spirit
[1:01:58] I've ever met a sweet Christian it was
[1:02:00] you oh don't you want them to say that
[1:02:03] about to you church oh I do you said get
[1:02:06] away from your Methodist Baptist
[1:02:07] Presbyterian your Pentecostal that was
[1:02:09] me how spent assemblies I was raised
[1:02:11] with assemblies oneness 3 news 5's
[1:02:14] whatever it is Church of God Nazarene
[1:02:16] pilgrim holiness
[1:02:17] Church of Christ all Anti Christ
[1:02:19] movement see once they denominator it
[1:02:21] becomes an antichrist movement they were
[1:02:24] there all nice when they start with the
[1:02:27] movement but once they denominator with
[1:02:30] that denomination then say then God
[1:02:32] leaves them because they de nominate a
[1:02:35] denomination is like a wall they build a
[1:02:37] wall around themselves and say we've got
[1:02:39] it and there's nothing else right
[1:02:42] that's a denomination but God once they
[1:02:46] do that God moves on and God has moved
[1:02:49] into our movement and we've got to make
[1:02:52] sure we don't grieve his Holy Spirit
[1:02:54] he's dealing with us but we got to let
[1:02:57] him deal with us amen
[1:02:58] and how does he deal best with us when
[1:03:01] we're in prayer when we're in prayer
[1:03:04] more prayer that's how he deals with us
[1:03:07] I realized this strikes the world all
[1:03:12] wrong all the devil all those
[1:03:14] denominations are of the devil
[1:03:16] there's godly men I love this he said
[1:03:18] there's godly men and every one of them
[1:03:19] godly people and every one of them
[1:03:21] movements but the organization in itself
[1:03:23] is not of God and God will never bless
[1:03:26] it he has never done it
[1:03:29] see God doesn't bless those
[1:03:31] organizations they all die right they
[1:03:33] all just die out but we want to be
[1:03:37] blessed with the Holy Spirit with God's
[1:03:38] love in our hearts right we want to be
[1:03:40] blessed with the presence of God in our
[1:03:42] lives
[1:03:42] that's right now I want to see a show of
[1:03:47] some thus at the Lord's on doctrine and
[1:03:50] of course these are all in the Bible
[1:03:52] brother Graham said his teaching on the
[1:03:54] church ages with us say the Lord the
[1:03:56] seven seals was thus say at the Lord
[1:03:58] revelation 10 that's critical was thus
[1:04:01] saith the Lord marriage and divorce was
[1:04:03] thus saith the Lord modest clothing is
[1:04:05] thus saith the Lord hair length short
[1:04:08] for men long for women is the say at the
[1:04:10] Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:12] thus saith the Lord and he said
[1:04:14] classical preaching is evil he said
[1:04:16] that's thus saith the Lord that's why I
[1:04:19] try to get excited I try to be led of
[1:04:20] the Holy Spirit because if I stand here
[1:04:22] just trying to be classical and speak
[1:04:24] everything eloquent that's of the devil
[1:04:27] are you with me church
[1:04:30] that's the devil trying to impress you
[1:04:32] with words or trying to be scholarly or
[1:04:34] trying to just be fancy or trying to be
[1:04:37] educated that's of the devil it's not
[1:04:40] about education we know it's about
[1:04:42] Revelation amen in other words God
[1:04:45] making known his will to you so let's
[1:04:49] read the quotes now the vision plus the
[1:04:51] word plus history plus the church ages
[1:04:53] all been together so I could truly say
[1:04:55] the best of my understanding in the
[1:04:56] Courteney of the Word of God and the
[1:04:58] vision and the revelation the
[1:04:59] interpretation thereof is thus saith the
[1:05:02] Lord so the seals and the church ages
[1:05:04] were thus saith the Lord that he taught
[1:05:07] now here's the one I like I had it read
[1:05:10] this one for a while till this morning
[1:05:11] notice what is it that what can be done
[1:05:13] what has to be done let's consult the
[1:05:15] prophet in the Bible where we cannot add
[1:05:17] or take away from and if we do God takes
[1:05:19] us from the book of life the Bible said
[1:05:21] in Malachi 4 what would happen today
[1:05:23] revelations 10 how the seven seals would
[1:05:25] be open and reveal all these mysteries
[1:05:28] that's been hid down through these
[1:05:29] reformers he said how it would be done
[1:05:31] it's in the Bible thus saith the Lord
[1:05:34] God has completely perfectly identified
[1:05:39] that to vindicate to be the truth by
[1:05:41] signs wonders in the heavens in the
[1:05:43] skies in the signs everything else for
[1:05:46] 33 years you think they'll listen to it
[1:05:48] no they're dead they put their hand into
[1:05:51] something that's killed the whole thing
[1:05:52] no it won't it won't never no more but
[1:05:56] see it's thus saith the Lord God is
[1:05:58] vindicated Malachi 4 and in Revelation
[1:06:01] 10 it's thus saith the Lord
[1:06:04] here's where he says now I'm gonna skip
[1:06:07] down here because he talks about how he
[1:06:09] foretold the events in Arizona with the
[1:06:12] sword and everything the sword of the
[1:06:13] king he saw seven angels coming I'm
[1:06:15] skipping down because I preached on that
[1:06:17] he said there stood seven angels and
[1:06:19] throw to the sword your hand said go
[1:06:20] home and open the seven seals that are
[1:06:22] given and here they are the true mystery
[1:06:24] of marriage and divorce and the serpent
[1:06:26] seed and all these other things that's
[1:06:27] been fussed about it's thus saith the
[1:06:29] Lord Amen cook I know yeah
[1:06:33] Amen in church that's why I love this
[1:06:35] message because I know it didn't come
[1:06:37] from a man it come from the Bible I get
[1:06:41] emails every week I get texts every week
[1:06:44] telling me people are amazed at the
[1:06:46] videos I make on YouTube because they've
[1:06:48] never heard it and I try not to mention
[1:06:50] brother Rams name not not because I'm
[1:06:52] ashamed of it but because I'm not trying
[1:06:54] to point everybody to him I'm trying to
[1:06:56] point them to Christ and then if they
[1:06:59] hang on to the end of the video yeah
[1:07:00] then I'll mention where I get this I got
[1:07:02] it from other Branham but that's the way
[1:07:04] I was taught I was taught point to the
[1:07:06] word point to the word point to the word
[1:07:07] and if they point to the word they're
[1:07:09] gonna love the man that preached the
[1:07:11] word and that was William Aaron random
[1:07:13] I don't know yeah I just got an email
[1:07:17] this morning saying what a I've never
[1:07:19] heard anything so beautiful about Adam
[1:07:20] and Eve in the Garden of Eden I said
[1:07:21] well thank you it wasn't me it's the
[1:07:23] Word of God but what is it Church its
[1:07:26] sayeth the Lord amen it's the word and
[1:07:32] that's why I love because you can prove
[1:07:33] all these things by the word of god this
[1:07:39] is continuing the quote go home yeah he
[1:07:41] said what is it now so this is what we
[1:07:43] read earlier seven seals
[1:07:45] serpentine marriage divorce what is it
[1:07:47] it's the quickening power coming to the
[1:07:49] church making her ready this hour that
[1:07:52] we're approaching quickening power Amen
[1:07:55] hallelujah Church I hope that's what the
[1:07:58] message has been to you when you receive
[1:08:01] the revelation of the marriage and
[1:08:02] divorce that should give you quickening
[1:08:04] power power to obey marriage and divorce
[1:08:07] Amen hallelujah that's power power to
[1:08:13] live your marriage is the right way and
[1:08:15] those that don't have the right
[1:08:17] marriages shows they don't have the
[1:08:18] right quickening power but God gives us
[1:08:20] the quickening power to obey all the
[1:08:22] commands on marriage and divorce Amen
[1:08:25] idea and then the seven seals with the
[1:08:29] quickening power in the seven seals is
[1:08:31] the eagle anointing praise God that's
[1:08:34] the quickening power for us this is a
[1:08:38] reality we're flying above all
[1:08:40] organizations and man-made religions
[1:08:43] it's not just well this is what the
[1:08:45] seals mean that's true that's what the
[1:08:47] symbols mean but we got to get anointed
[1:08:49] with the revelation of those symbols the
[1:08:52] holy spirit to fly like a real Christian
[1:08:54] should flying and
[1:08:56] and here's what here's how you know
[1:08:59] church help us to receive to help us see
[1:09:03] it just depends on what attitude if you
[1:09:06] just take the attitude well yeah the
[1:09:09] white horse is just Satan's Antichrist
[1:09:10] spirit that was good to know what's next
[1:09:13] if you take that attitude you're failing
[1:09:16] to see that you you're supposed to take
[1:09:19] that revelation and now recognize Satan
[1:09:22] will try to sneak into your life as a
[1:09:24] white horse writer and you've got to be
[1:09:27] ready to fight off that white horse
[1:09:29] rider in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:32] that's quickening power amen so you'll
[1:09:36] see that so when you leave Church the
[1:09:38] next temptation that comes you'll be
[1:09:40] ready to cast down and kill that white
[1:09:41] horse rider are you with me
[1:09:45] it's quickening power it's not just
[1:09:48] sermons and tapes and and different
[1:09:50] teachings it is teaching but the reality
[1:09:52] behind that teaching is quickening life
[1:09:55] amen hallelujah I've always stood for
[1:09:58] that I've always believed that it just
[1:10:00] depends the attitude you take to the
[1:10:01] preaching right that's why tell on their
[1:10:08] attitude to the preaching I know it's
[1:10:12] hard but the church says still says Amen
[1:10:15] your attitude see it depends what
[1:10:17] attitude is this just education to you
[1:10:20] or is this quickening power to you
[1:10:23] coming to church needs to be power amen
[1:10:26] because it's worth the spirit behind the
[1:10:29] word is the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:10:32] Spirit is power when the Holy Spirit
[1:10:34] comes upon you you're a power to be a
[1:10:37] witness amen Oh Mary hallelujah see
[1:10:44] that's the reality that's why so many
[1:10:46] people fall away for the message it's
[1:10:47] their attitude they just oh yeah oh it's
[1:10:50] just it's just education it's just
[1:10:51] different teaching it's all it's just
[1:10:53] it's just different symbols I didn't
[1:10:55] know that before and it's just attitude
[1:10:57] it's not power it's gotta be power if
[1:11:02] you're gonna overcome Satan you can't
[1:11:03] overcome him it's got to be the power of
[1:11:05] God to overcome Satan
[1:11:07] that's right Church
[1:11:09] and then you'll see if you have the
[1:11:11] power when it comes to marriage in
[1:11:12] divorce you're gonna marry the right
[1:11:13] person or gonna mess up mess up your
[1:11:15] life or make a mistake it's the power
[1:11:17] that keeps you in the right situation
[1:11:19] it's the power that holds you amen
[1:11:22] that's right all these things now here
[1:11:28] program gives us a vill thus saith the
[1:11:29] lord about modest clothing now watch
[1:11:33] this
[1:11:33] looky here here's a little lady twisted
[1:11:36] herself down the street you probably saw
[1:11:37] some more women sometime this week
[1:11:40] probably family events here's a young
[1:11:42] fella saw a man's looking at a sexy
[1:11:45] dress women his eyes catches it he's a
[1:11:47] member of the church he's a Pentecostal
[1:11:49] he's whatever let's just say he's the
[1:11:50] message believer but the first thing you
[1:11:52] know there's no hold post in there see
[1:11:55] there's no born-again experience she'll
[1:11:57] say hello he's got curly hair and kind
[1:12:00] of nice looking straight shoulder young
[1:12:01] man maybe tried to live right she start
[1:12:04] walking up to him even a preacher the
[1:12:05] first thing you know what is it this out
[1:12:07] here the flesh desire and the spirit
[1:12:09] down there yet anointed saying don't do
[1:12:11] it don't do it but what will it do it'll
[1:12:14] move right around there hold there it
[1:12:16] goes first thing you know he's trying to
[1:12:19] make a date with her he's guilty of
[1:12:21] committing adultery whether he touches
[1:12:23] her or not
[1:12:24] so today especially with dating a young
[1:12:27] man he could be in the church he sees a
[1:12:29] sexy dress women oh can I get your phone
[1:12:31] number he's already going about it the
[1:12:36] wrong way
[1:12:37] he's only once her number because of her
[1:12:39] outward appearance but if he followed
[1:12:42] the laws of God he would contact her
[1:12:45] father first right and he would pray
[1:12:48] about it first and it wouldn't be just
[1:12:50] based upon outward and be based upon her
[1:12:53] inward character amen
[1:12:55] he would love her not just because she's
[1:12:58] beautiful on the out but because she
[1:13:00] loves Jesus Christ which is the only
[1:13:02] true beauty there is because beauty is
[1:13:06] vain a woman that feared the Lord
[1:13:08] that's real beauty she shall be praised
[1:13:11] amen so see this is them this is how
[1:13:15] most church people date today and of
[1:13:17] course the world they don't care they've
[1:13:19] got apps where people can just meet up
[1:13:20] now just for casual interactions it's
[1:13:23] so filthy and awful just so wicked but
[1:13:27] we're talking about church people here
[1:13:28] Pentecostals right message message
[1:13:31] people let's bring it to our day amen
[1:13:34] but see a genuine born-again son of God
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:37] you can't do it yourself it's totally
[1:13:40] impossible for a red-blooded male to
[1:13:42] walk before a female like that without
[1:13:43] something taking place but when there's
[1:13:45] something on the inside that little
[1:13:47] born-again something here though that
[1:13:51] man might have shouted spoke in tongues
[1:13:53] jump dance everything else anointed with
[1:13:55] the spirit done all the signs wonders
[1:13:57] that God said in there by his Spirit
[1:13:59] jesus said many will come to me in that
[1:14:01] day say lord have we not prophesied in
[1:14:03] your name haven't I cast out Devils in
[1:14:05] your name have not he said depart from
[1:14:08] me ye that work iniquity was iniquity
[1:14:10] something that you know to do but don't
[1:14:13] do it depart for me hear that work
[1:14:15] iniquity I didn't even know you so see
[1:14:19] this young man knew better he must have
[1:14:22] known you don't go you don't try to get
[1:14:24] a woman's phone number just based upon
[1:14:26] her sexual clothing and how sexy she is
[1:14:29] that's not the right way to go and so no
[1:14:32] matter how anointed the young man could
[1:14:33] have been he already had committed lust
[1:14:36] in his heart and because of that he's
[1:14:38] guilty but down on the inside of that
[1:14:42] man if that little tie post is in there
[1:14:44] the seed of God that was predestined
[1:14:46] before the foundation of the world I
[1:14:47] don't care what takes place it holds him
[1:14:49] it's there to stay so you brothers you
[1:14:53] know and when you get temptations and
[1:14:55] you cast it down what does it show it
[1:14:57] shows you've got to anchor amen the
[1:15:00] anchor holds amen hallelujah in the
[1:15:02] midst of the storm amen and you sisters
[1:15:05] the same thing when you had a temptation
[1:15:06] for a man that shouldn't be the right
[1:15:08] man or shouldn't talk to him what is it
[1:15:09] it's the anchor of God it's the
[1:15:11] character of Jesus Christ formed in you
[1:15:13] what is it it's the Holy Ghost
[1:15:15] self-control amen
[1:15:17] that's right male or female let's give
[1:15:19] them both let's give them both a good
[1:15:21] pat on the back that's right why that's
[1:15:26] why the woman will wear them shorts now
[1:15:29] look a woman that wears these short
[1:15:30] shorts
[1:15:31] she's counted a prostitute the same as
[1:15:34] the woman in the act now if this woman
[1:15:36] doesn't know
[1:15:37] better she that's different right
[1:15:39] because the Bible says if they don't
[1:15:41] know there's no transgression if they
[1:15:42] don't know in other words they don't
[1:15:45] understand what they're doing but a
[1:15:46] woman that will wear those short shorts
[1:15:48] or short skirts on purpose and no she's
[1:15:51] trying to get attention she's got a
[1:15:53] prostitute spirit on her because she's
[1:15:55] trying to attach a track tension she's
[1:15:58] trying to do it sexually so she's got an
[1:16:00] evil spirit trying to attract the
[1:16:03] attention of men that's right in fact I
[1:16:07] just saw I was I didn't read the whole
[1:16:09] article I was just flipping through the
[1:16:10] news this morning just maybe five
[1:16:11] minutes on my phone
[1:16:12] and a pole I just pulled up what's this
[1:16:14] this girl this actress now she's an
[1:16:17] older actress now like in her 30s or 40s
[1:16:19] but she in this article I'm off to find
[1:16:22] it afterwards she said Hollywood started
[1:16:25] having her do evil sexual things at 13
[1:16:28] years old she was in movies at 13 and
[1:16:30] Hollywood had her take her clothes off
[1:16:33] at even 13 and she said I knew it was
[1:16:35] wrong and here's someone who does not
[1:16:36] even a Christian and they put makeup on
[1:16:39] her face and and made her do sexual
[1:16:41] things even at 13 years old and there's
[1:16:44] a woman who's not even a Christian
[1:16:46] admitting I knew it was wrong see God
[1:16:50] puts a conscience in every man and woman
[1:16:52] they know it's wrong they know what's
[1:16:55] wrong and so God puts it in there now I
[1:17:00] said earlier that some people might not
[1:17:02] know what's wrong I don't know now
[1:17:04] forgive me but that even proves a 13
[1:17:09] year old girl knows it's wrong to act
[1:17:11] sexual like that they put makeup on her
[1:17:14] face and they give her they put her in
[1:17:16] sexual scenes with grown men at 13 years
[1:17:18] old Hollywood did that so people are
[1:17:22] gonna go spend $50 it goes to movie in
[1:17:23] Hollywood you're just flushing your
[1:17:25] money down the toilet you're just
[1:17:27] getting you're just paving the road to
[1:17:29] hell is that right
[1:17:30] you're just paving driving on the road
[1:17:33] to hell that's right see she doesn't
[1:17:37] know that spirit how does she know or
[1:17:39] what does she know her ultimate what is
[1:17:41] an ultimate is the last word the
[1:17:43] ultimate is the Amen it's the end of all
[1:17:44] strife your ultimate and if you're
[1:17:47] Church a Pentecostal church or message
[1:17:48] church well in this case probably
[1:17:51] Pentecostal Pentecostal church that
[1:17:53] tells you long hair and stuff is just
[1:17:55] fanaticism you got a spare tire in the
[1:17:57] back of your head and so forth and then
[1:17:59] kind of things that man is possessed of
[1:18:01] the devil amen
[1:18:03] any man that will make fun of women with
[1:18:05] long hair is possessed of the devil and
[1:18:09] church he's going to say thus saith the
[1:18:10] Lord right after this because the Bible
[1:18:13] never shows a godly woman ever cutting
[1:18:16] her hair never shows the godly woman
[1:18:19] ever taking her clothes off like a strip
[1:18:21] tease it never shows that so these are
[1:18:26] witnesses so a man that says Oh sisters
[1:18:30] you can cut your hair that man's got
[1:18:31] demons on him for God's Word said it's a
[1:18:36] shame for a woman to cut her hair should
[1:18:38] this honor her head if she dishonored
[1:18:40] her husband and her husband is Christ in
[1:18:42] the churches Christ she is a
[1:18:44] dishonorable religious prostitute and
[1:18:45] look at that you start building it up
[1:18:47] now that's true think about this think
[1:18:52] about a person that will break some of
[1:18:54] the Ten Commandments they blaspheme they
[1:18:57] murder they lust and they covet if they
[1:19:01] just do those right there they're a
[1:19:02] murdering blasphemous covetous I doubt
[1:19:05] her fornicator are you with me church
[1:19:08] are you with me they it just compounds
[1:19:12] from one sin to the next the more demons
[1:19:15] people get on the more evils they do and
[1:19:17] it just compounds so now they're a
[1:19:20] dishonouring this audible religious
[1:19:23] prostitutes false church member it just
[1:19:26] builds and builds and builds and if evil
[1:19:29] builds don't you know righteousness
[1:19:31] built as well amen
[1:19:32] you go from faith to virtue to knowledge
[1:19:36] glory to temperance the patience the
[1:19:39] godless to brotherly kindness to charity
[1:19:41] amen then you start bringing forth the
[1:19:43] fruits of the spirit how did it get
[1:19:45] pretty soon you coming to your adoption
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:48] just like they build up their filthiness
[1:19:50] we build up our righteousness a man
[1:19:55] naked don't do Bible say the woman's
[1:19:57] covering is her hair isn't the hair to
[1:19:59] give her for a covering yeah let's go
[1:20:01] read em real quick
[1:20:04] giving her for a covering and I've had
[1:20:07] this year I've had so many I don't know
[1:20:08] why I met so many people contact me
[1:20:10] about the cap set you know Amish and
[1:20:12] Mennonite women wear and I just always
[1:20:15] take him back to the scripture I take
[1:20:17] him back to here
[1:20:18] if a woman have long hair it's a glory
[1:20:20] to her for her hair is given for her
[1:20:22] covering I mean if I tell them if it
[1:20:25] makes you feel good to wear a cap that's
[1:20:27] fine or a veil that's fine but the Bible
[1:20:29] never says the cap is your covering or
[1:20:31] avails your covering the Bible says
[1:20:33] you're uncut hair is a covering and so
[1:20:38] Paul says if anybody wants to argue
[1:20:40] about this we have no such or no other
[1:20:43] custom we don't do any other practice
[1:20:45] neither do the Churches of God we have
[1:20:47] no other way this is the way the
[1:20:49] Churches of God do it praise God now
[1:20:57] look what he says some day live this
[1:20:59] yonder at the judgment bar tried to pour
[1:21:01] the medicine in and hold it with my
[1:21:04] hands and you spit it right straight
[1:21:06] back out between your fingers and that's
[1:21:08] something God will judge them some day
[1:21:11] that's thus saith the Lord
[1:21:15] the Browns preaching hard women you
[1:21:17] gotta let your hair grow women you got
[1:21:19] to cover up your bodies men stop lusting
[1:21:20] after women and he's on the day of
[1:21:22] judgment God will judge them for those
[1:21:24] things it hasn't been a bunch of
[1:21:27] foolishness or some crazy old man all
[1:21:28] worked up it is it because it's the word
[1:21:31] of the Lord oh we just love this Bible
[1:21:34] don't we Church everything we believe is
[1:21:37] in this word but see I like this a real
[1:21:40] genuine Christian will cope with that
[1:21:42] inside man that spirit that was backyard
[1:21:44] at the beginning which is the word in
[1:21:47] others you can cope you can agree with
[1:21:49] it you can obey it because you believe
[1:21:51] it amen now here's an
[1:21:56] here's where bonuses we have the stator
[1:21:58] on the on the baptism the Holy Ghost the
[1:22:00] evidence is not speaking in tongues and
[1:22:02] you don't get the Holy Ghost when you
[1:22:04] get baptized you might get it right
[1:22:05] after but you'd you're not guaranteed to
[1:22:08] get it if you get baptized you've got to
[1:22:10] be justified sanctified and then fill
[1:22:12] with the Holy Spirit program says I want
[1:22:15] to make myself very clear on what the
[1:22:17] baptism Holy Ghost is according to the
[1:22:18] word it's not according to me it's not
[1:22:21] according to you it has to be according
[1:22:23] to the say it the Lord over falsely led
[1:22:26] and the Word says you're baptized when
[1:22:29] the Holy Ghost when you obey God let me
[1:22:32] pull that up acts 5:32 we'll just do
[1:22:37] little a little maybe the Obama study
[1:22:39] here today here all right now they're
[1:22:45] preaching in acts 5 and he said him hath
[1:22:47] God exalted with his right hand to be a
[1:22:49] prince and a saviour speaking of Christ
[1:22:50] for to give repentance to Israel
[1:22:52] forgiveness of sins and we are witnesses
[1:22:54] of these things I'm sorry we are his
[1:22:57] witnesses of these things and so is also
[1:22:59] the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to
[1:23:01] them that obey Him amen
[1:23:03] my it's so simple if you weren't the
[1:23:05] Holy Ghost just obeying the word Amen
[1:23:07] that's all you got to do if you want to
[1:23:09] be born-again obey it don't set it aside
[1:23:11] don't compromise but don't make any any
[1:23:15] reason to not obey it just do what the
[1:23:18] word says and then the word will come
[1:23:20] living you praise God
[1:23:21] hey you don't give the Holy Ghost to
[1:23:25] those that disobey Him
[1:23:26] he gives the Holy Ghost to those that
[1:23:28] obey Him hallelujah
[1:23:31] it's very very plain when they heard
[1:23:36] that they're cut to their hearts that's
[1:23:37] what it always does right if you got the
[1:23:38] religious spirit on you that will make
[1:23:40] you want to just beat me up or something
[1:23:41] if you got the wrong spirit if I said
[1:23:44] that and you'd want to beat me up but if
[1:23:45] you got the right spirit you'd say
[1:23:47] hallelujah amen
[1:23:50] God only gives the Holy Ghost to them
[1:23:53] that obey Him
[1:23:55] that's the saith the Lord program told
[1:23:58] us according to the Bible not me not him
[1:24:00] thus according to the Bible oh brother
[1:24:03] what we need today is an old stirring of
[1:24:05] the Holy Ghost again brother
[1:24:06] it had to come to me before God ever
[1:24:08] manifested himself we need
[1:24:10] rushing mighty wind sense that's right
[1:24:12] as it did on the day of Pentecost they
[1:24:14] were all religious and followers of
[1:24:15] Jesus but they had to go and receive the
[1:24:17] baptism Holy Ghost is that true and
[1:24:19] listen here women you got to be salty
[1:24:21] and listen to this do you realize that
[1:24:22] up in there when they all went up at 120
[1:24:25] to pray they never done like we Baptist
[1:24:27] do shake hands up with their name on the
[1:24:29] book and say yes I'm born again they
[1:24:31] didn't have it like that no scripture is
[1:24:34] that in the Bible and we Catholic people
[1:24:36] who come lick out our tongue and take
[1:24:38] the Holy Eucharist and say we got the
[1:24:40] Holy Ghost no Scripture in the Bible for
[1:24:42] that so see either way you can't come to
[1:24:47] church and shake my hand say well I've
[1:24:48] got the Holy Ghost now I've been
[1:24:50] baptized in or Jesus Christ and you
[1:24:53] can't go to the Catholic Church and get
[1:24:54] the wafer and say well I got the Holy
[1:24:55] Ghost now he says we Methodists go on
[1:24:59] prohibition for six months and no such
[1:25:01] Scripture in the Bible but the Bible
[1:25:03] said when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:25:05] come there came a sound from heaven like
[1:25:07] a rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[1:25:09] the house where they were setting and
[1:25:11] the power of God stood and closed those
[1:25:14] people and anointed them till they run
[1:25:16] into the street screaming and dancing
[1:25:18] and hollering and acting like a bunch of
[1:25:20] drunk people that's the scripture thus
[1:25:22] saith the Lord hallelujah amen I've
[1:25:27] never danced in those streets are shot
[1:25:29] but I have shouted and cried and prayed
[1:25:31] really loud out in our parking lot
[1:25:33] I have done that I've never danced in
[1:25:37] the street I have danced around numerous
[1:25:41] churches including this one so I know
[1:25:44] what that's like
[1:25:45] I have hollered I'm hollering now I've
[1:25:48] act like a drug person might have seen
[1:25:50] me act like a drug person praying and
[1:25:51] sniffing and shouting and crying and and
[1:25:53] snotting all over the place where I look
[1:25:56] like I'm drunk so we know what that's
[1:26:00] like but listen there's no other way the
[1:26:03] Holy Ghost comes until you open yourself
[1:26:05] so much that you really worship God and
[1:26:08] you don't care who's around that's when
[1:26:10] God you obey God and that's when God
[1:26:13] will fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:14] you'll not be ashamed to worship Jesus
[1:26:17] Christ if you get the Holy Ghost amen
[1:26:19] you don't care if it's out in the
[1:26:21] parking lot you don't care if it's in
[1:26:22] here
[1:26:23] just wanna worship him because your fail
[1:26:25] with eternal life ahead oh yeah yeah
[1:26:29] it's exactly right
[1:26:34] here's that quote I was telling you
[1:26:36] that's why I don't try to impress you
[1:26:37] with class let me speak this just a
[1:26:40] minute did you know where class come
[1:26:42] from classes of the devil
[1:26:43] now that's thus saith the lord of the
[1:26:45] bible class and pomp came from the devil
[1:26:47] in the very beginning when Cain and Abel
[1:26:49] come up to worship Cain come before the
[1:26:51] Lord in class Abel came by righteousness
[1:26:54] by revelation so see there's a
[1:26:59] difference a pain worship a bloodless
[1:27:03] lifeless worship is of the devil but a
[1:27:07] real worship of Revelation will include
[1:27:10] the blood it'll have life in it amen if
[1:27:14] you're bringing the right sacrifice
[1:27:17] it'll have life in it praise God in
[1:27:20] other words it won't be a burden to go
[1:27:21] to church it won't be a burden to read
[1:27:23] your Bible it won't be a burden to pray
[1:27:25] it'll be life to do those things because
[1:27:28] that's your sacrifice it was blood life
[1:27:31] it wasn't class and routine in high
[1:27:34] society and memorization and
[1:27:37] pronunciation God don't care about that
[1:27:40] what he cares about his life
[1:27:42] that's thus saith the Lord he says now
[1:27:45] he elaborates a little bit on that now
[1:27:47] look when Cain come he brought the
[1:27:48] fruits of the field everything that
[1:27:49] grows flowers and everything in
[1:27:51] decorating his altar and he works got a
[1:27:52] true picture of the carnal church member
[1:27:55] today and the carnal minded pastor who
[1:27:58] wants a church that sits higher than the
[1:28:00] rest of them in the city and their seats
[1:28:02] are plush and $1,000,000 pipe organ well
[1:28:05] you can ask bang I never asked for a
[1:28:07] million dollar pipe or yet have I been
[1:28:09] no I never asked bang bang can you try
[1:28:13] to find us the the church that's the
[1:28:16] highest up in Green Ohio everybody can
[1:28:17] look at our church and say oh what a
[1:28:19] great marvelous Church they are nonsense
[1:28:22] what we want is we want to be a
[1:28:24] spiritual city on a hill that cannot be
[1:28:28] hidden and when we got that we'll have
[1:28:30] the love of Christ the life of Christ we
[1:28:33] have testimonies of Jesus Christ one of
[1:28:35] the power and love genes
[1:28:37] we'll want to share with everybody
[1:28:39] that's the real church that's the kind
[1:28:41] of that's the kind of city on a hill we
[1:28:43] want to be that's right he said God
[1:28:50] don't care for that just say that you
[1:28:54] that's a lot of those great big places
[1:28:56] like that and done your people until
[1:28:58] they're just about poor paupers and
[1:29:00] everything else with all your stuff to
[1:29:01] put in the church and thousands of
[1:29:02] heathens died on the mission field
[1:29:04] without knowing Christ one time right
[1:29:06] it's a disgrace to Christianity oh if
[1:29:07] you could only see one time you know
[1:29:09] what I was speaking of build that
[1:29:10] million-dollar Church in two-thirds of
[1:29:12] the world never heard of Jesus Christ
[1:29:13] what a pity I forgot I got a testimony
[1:29:15] for your church I gave Simon over a
[1:29:18] thousand dollars to take his missionary
[1:29:20] trip to Thailand that was your tithing I
[1:29:23] remember when we remember before he went
[1:29:25] we prayed and said God may you please
[1:29:27] find the soul that really loves the
[1:29:29] message someone that can be a pastor
[1:29:31] well guess what a pastor received the
[1:29:37] message and now he's spreading it the
[1:29:40] brother said he's Simon sitting there
[1:29:41] spreading like wildfire over there now
[1:29:44] the only the only thing you got to pray
[1:29:45] for now is that his wife is against it
[1:29:47] because you know it's holiness so we got
[1:29:50] to pray for his wife at the end of the
[1:29:52] service there but I was so happy I said
[1:29:54] hallelujah I told the bear said that's
[1:29:56] exactly what we prayed for is that a
[1:29:58] pastor would receive the message and
[1:30:00] look for church God answered our prayer
[1:30:02] now they in Thailand they have just as
[1:30:05] much right to hear the gospel
[1:30:10] hallelujah
[1:30:11] amen and so that should be our main
[1:30:14] desire now I know bang and I talked
[1:30:16] about we'd like to build a church at
[1:30:18] some point but that if God's in it
[1:30:20] Church God will help us to do both at
[1:30:22] the same time if God's in it that's
[1:30:25] that's how it'll be right now it looks
[1:30:27] like we go into one right now we'll do
[1:30:30] the missionary work for now but you
[1:30:31] never know God's it you know God's a
[1:30:33] mysterious God he's a great God we don't
[1:30:35] want to put it past him now we can do
[1:30:37] our part and save a little bit we can I
[1:30:39] want to do that more in 2019 as well I'm
[1:30:41] gonna probably less less preachers but
[1:30:43] that means you got to put up with me
[1:30:44] more so hopefully you like that
[1:30:46] or you say no get more preachers brother
[1:30:48] Jesse I know you don't say that but you
[1:30:52] know see Bertram is always bringing this
[1:30:54] up because he's he's always battling
[1:30:56] that that Antichrist spirit that cane
[1:30:58] spear they want a fancy look in church
[1:31:01] instead of seeing people receive the
[1:31:02] message that's what they want they want
[1:31:05] a million dollar pipe organ rather than
[1:31:07] sending somebody go to preach to a place
[1:31:09] that's never heard the message before I
[1:31:11] don't care about him in our pipe organ
[1:31:14] what I cares about is this message going
[1:31:16] to somebody that loves Christ and that
[1:31:18] really wants to know Christ amen I've
[1:31:21] always cared about that that's all I
[1:31:23] care about
[1:31:24] here's some more now this is this is uh
[1:31:33] thus saith the Lord
[1:31:34] Miriam brother BAM says was an informal
[1:31:37] Holy Roller and he says we got to be
[1:31:39] like Miriam once there's a testimony
[1:31:42] somebody's got jump up and say where's
[1:31:44] the tambourine here let me do this let
[1:31:45] me give an example somebody gets saved
[1:31:47] and somebody comes to the blood somebody
[1:31:49] gets saved here somebody needs to break
[1:31:50] out tambourines this holiday yeah thank
[1:31:53] you Jesus praise the Lord hallelujah

[1:32:04] bang I do we got a four guys a
[1:32:07] tambourine thank you I can't play the
[1:32:09] tambourine but yeah you know we got to
[1:32:12] have some real excitement praise God
[1:32:14] there's got to be a real victory because
[1:32:17] God brought them through the blower they
[1:32:19] men and all their taskmasters died in
[1:32:23] the Dead Sea or the red sea rather robe
[1:32:28] and said there's only one prophet
[1:32:29] messenger with us saith the Lord
[1:32:30] the RAM said a woman that cuts her hair
[1:32:32] is spiritually dead she's not born again
[1:32:34] thus saith the Lord there's one about
[1:32:37] divorce and remarriage brother Ham gives
[1:32:39] the state the law look at that one
[1:32:41] denominational fruit is is no good fruit
[1:32:43] that's thus saith the Lord and every
[1:32:45] nation is dominated by Satan that's the
[1:32:47] state the Lord notice he said Balak
[1:32:53] they're sent to bail them and say come
[1:32:55] over here and curse this people I don't
[1:32:56] want them in my country and said that's
[1:32:57] a bunch of holy rollers I don't want
[1:32:59] them here you say holy rollers brother
[1:33:01] band yes they were holy rollers can you
[1:33:02] prove it
[1:33:03] yes sir when they call us to the red
[1:33:05] blood of the Red Sea they saw the
[1:33:07] taskmasters dead behind them poor
[1:33:08] brother dr. Moses Moses got informal he
[1:33:11] thrown his hands up in the air and began
[1:33:14] screaming and singing in the spirit
[1:33:17] nobody expected Moses to do it but he
[1:33:20] just did it informally it wasn't
[1:33:22] scheduled and the church said this is
[1:33:26] informal Holy Ghost worship is something
[1:33:29] that's not scheduled it's not the
[1:33:31] regular routine but God wants to get
[1:33:33] praise anyway amen so God kind of breaks
[1:33:36] up the schedule and lets somebody get a
[1:33:38] little sighted and prays to the lower
[1:33:40] that's some informal Holy Ghost worship
[1:33:44] thank you Lord amen
[1:33:47] hallelujah like when sister Naomi will
[1:33:50] speak in tongues or something like you
[1:33:51] know like we've had two or three times
[1:33:53] over the years
[1:33:53] that's informal like right we don't
[1:33:55] expect that right when somebody will
[1:33:58] scream I think couple years we had
[1:33:59] somebody scream back there in the back
[1:34:00] and it was sister Chris and Walker when
[1:34:02] she first started coming here all of a
[1:34:04] sudden just let out a scream see God
[1:34:06] likes that God likes to move upon people
[1:34:09] and God likes to be worship praise God
[1:34:12] now it's not always going to be informal
[1:34:14] every service but there are many times
[1:34:16] when somebody informally just praises
[1:34:18] God or worships God that's what he said
[1:34:22] in informal he got informal he got a
[1:34:25] little excited about Jesus we should get
[1:34:29] a little excited about Jesus amen and
[1:34:33] Miriam the prophetess she got informal
[1:34:35] grabbed a tambourine and run down the
[1:34:37] bank beating and dancing and the dollars
[1:34:39] of Israel found her dancing beating on a
[1:34:41] tambourine if an old fashioned Holy
[1:34:44] Roller meaning I never seen one in my
[1:34:46] life amen they were informal holy
[1:34:49] rollers you don't want to believe that
[1:34:51] but that's the truth that's not saith
[1:34:53] the Lord the scripture I like that
[1:34:59] praise God that's what happened much in
[1:35:00] in in message churches because Satan
[1:35:02] how's it so hard I think but every now
[1:35:05] and then if we can just break
[1:35:06] that and we'll see God move we can
[1:35:08] experience this where God gives us an
[1:35:11] informal worship
[1:35:12] nobody was planning on it except God was
[1:35:14] planning it you and I were planning it
[1:35:18] but God was planning some informal
[1:35:20] worship hallelujah
[1:35:22] sure they were holy rollers
[1:35:24] interdenominational holy rollers
[1:35:26] that's that vine over there though oh
[1:35:30] I'm so glad to be part of that bye hey
[1:35:32] men glory now here's the court about
[1:35:36] there's only one one prophet messenger
[1:35:39] and I know for example I know I don't
[1:35:42] know anybody who believes their a the
[1:35:45] eighth messenger but there are some
[1:35:46] churches that believe that but just so
[1:35:48] you know I'm gonna go through I'm gonna
[1:35:49] go this quickly I'm just gonna skip
[1:35:50] right ahead
[1:35:51] buh-bam said I deny upon the infallible
[1:35:54] evidence of the word that there is more
[1:35:56] than one major prophet messenger who
[1:35:57] reveal the mysteries as contained the
[1:35:59] word and who has the mystery to turn the
[1:36:01] hearts of the children of the fathers
[1:36:03] thus saith the LORD bhai's unfailing
[1:36:05] word stands and shall stand and be
[1:36:07] vindicated there's one prophet messenger
[1:36:09] to this age we're not looking for me
[1:36:12] you're not looking for me to reveal more
[1:36:14] mysteries you're not looking for any
[1:36:16] other person no matter the last name
[1:36:17] brand amour Regan or Pruitt or any any
[1:36:22] name you're not looking for anyone else
[1:36:24] to raise up and reveal what God has
[1:36:27] already done through a seventh church
[1:36:28] age messenger I didn't think we need to
[1:36:31] spend too much time on that because I've
[1:36:32] never heard of anything around this area
[1:36:34] try to tempt anybody with that an eighth
[1:36:38] messenger or something but they're there
[1:36:40] they are there I know there's some in
[1:36:41] New York another some in Trinidad and
[1:36:43] different things like that now here's
[1:36:46] this here's a scripture about a woman
[1:36:48] that she'd not cut her hair but let's
[1:36:51] stop here I feel somebody resenting that
[1:36:52] might have been out on the wire
[1:36:54] somewhere listen a hair to a woman isn't
[1:36:56] as right bow hair to Samson was a
[1:36:59] Nazarite vow and when a woman cuts off
[1:37:01] her hair she absolutely denies her
[1:37:03] Nazarite vow that she is the Bride of
[1:37:05] Christ because they're that one thing
[1:37:08] she spoils the whole pictures correctly
[1:37:10] an asura is one that's consecrated for a
[1:37:13] purpose is that right Samson was
[1:37:15] consecrated to an age and a purpose
[1:37:17] before he had long hair I'm sure
[1:37:20] therefore he had long hair the woman
[1:37:22] that's a child of God lets her hair grow
[1:37:24] to show that she's consecrated to every
[1:37:26] word of God right if she cuts it off I
[1:37:31] don't care how much she dances sings in
[1:37:34] the choir speaks in tongues runs up and
[1:37:36] down or has all kinds of hated societies
[1:37:38] she's dead
[1:37:39] that's thus saith the Lord the Word of
[1:37:41] God yeah she's denied her Nazarite vow
[1:37:45] and sold out to the god of this modern
[1:37:46] age she does it now shame on you lady or
[1:37:49] woman and that true that's true now a
[1:37:52] man that'll grow his hair long he's just
[1:37:55] as wrong he's ashamed to Jesus right he
[1:37:58] dishonored Jesus Christ a man that
[1:38:00] lettered hair grow
[1:38:01] uncut now uncut he's a shame there's no
[1:38:05] way he's born again either right so this
[1:38:07] woman is not born again she's dead she's
[1:38:10] not alive by the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:12] Ghost that's right now here's one I got
[1:38:17] to put a disclaimer because I met a
[1:38:19] pastor in Maine who the previous pastor
[1:38:22] took this quote he divorced his wife and
[1:38:25] married another all because his wife cut
[1:38:29] her hair and that's wrong that's not
[1:38:31] what brother Branham said here so you
[1:38:33] have to you have to read this one
[1:38:34] carefully and it can't go against
[1:38:36] anything in here the only way a person
[1:38:39] can marry someone else after divorce is
[1:38:42] if and ethically be a man because that's
[1:38:45] what Jesus said Jesus said the only
[1:38:48] cause for remarriage after divorce is a
[1:38:51] man whose first wife committed
[1:38:53] fornication but never told him got
[1:38:56] married and so when he finds out later
[1:38:58] he can put her away and he can marry
[1:39:01] another that's the only way in the Bible
[1:39:06] writes the Scriptures for in them you
[1:39:09] think you have eternal life that's the
[1:39:11] only way now here brother Branham says
[1:39:13] this he says the Bible says the hair is
[1:39:16] given to a woman for glory and the Bible
[1:39:18] right gives any man a right to leave and
[1:39:21] divorce and leave his wife that will cut
[1:39:23] her hair that's the Bible
[1:39:24] that's the saith the Lord now let me
[1:39:27] help you to understand this in the Bible
[1:39:30] days a woman had no right to leave a man
[1:39:33] she was under his she's like property
[1:39:35] right because they were they were so
[1:39:37] mistreated that they were like property
[1:39:40] now today if a woman's being mistreated
[1:39:43] she should leave if she's getting beat
[1:39:46] or something she should leave and run
[1:39:47] for her life
[1:39:48] God is not asking a woman to get abused
[1:39:51] God doesn't want anybody abused now he
[1:39:54] allows it sometimes for testimonies and
[1:39:56] for witnesses on the day of judgment
[1:39:58] right because nobody as awful as abuse
[1:40:02] is nobody was more abused than Jesus
[1:40:05] Christ the Bible said he was beaten and
[1:40:08] bruised and mistreated like he didn't
[1:40:11] even look like a man anymore
[1:40:13] nobody could experience any worse abuse
[1:40:15] than Christ
[1:40:16] so sometimes God does let people go
[1:40:18] through abuse but don't misunderstand
[1:40:21] this brother branham never said this
[1:40:24] person can remarry so if a man if his
[1:40:26] wife cut her hair he could divorce her
[1:40:29] but he cannot marry another woman now if
[1:40:34] a man really loved his wife I don't
[1:40:35] think he'd divorce her if she cut her
[1:40:37] hair but the bible does give them that
[1:40:41] right because the bible said it's a
[1:40:42] dishonor she dissed honors her head when
[1:40:46] she cuts her hair she dishonours her
[1:40:48] husband right that's true something well
[1:40:58] there's something
[1:40:58] someone to say oh no I hope you
[1:41:01] understand that nobody nobody out here
[1:41:05] ever ever better getting divorces don't
[1:41:07] get a divorce
[1:41:08] don't misunderstand this you stay
[1:41:10] married you stay in the situation you're
[1:41:12] in
[1:41:12] don't misunderstand this stay married
[1:41:15] here's the next one
[1:41:20] okay here yeah this is denominations
[1:41:22] after all the denominations is played
[1:41:24] out they don't have any light to begin
[1:41:25] with there'll be a day they can't that
[1:41:28] can't be called day or night what are
[1:41:29] they doing what are they doing what does
[1:41:31] a lemon do on an orange tree it takes
[1:41:34] the original life of a orange that's
[1:41:35] coming up and perverts it through a
[1:41:36] lemon that's where the nominations are
[1:41:38] done to the Word of God made the Word of
[1:41:40] God of no effect by their traditions
[1:41:42] that's thus saith the Spirit of the Lord
[1:41:44] they have brought forth lemons grape
[1:41:46] fruits but not oranges so everybody I
[1:41:50] hope we all can look at denominations
[1:41:52] not to be critical but just to be honest
[1:41:54] what have they produced they produced
[1:41:57] sin loving church members right like
[1:42:01] many my friends this morning they're
[1:42:03] posting on Facebook all about the Browns
[1:42:05] are all about last night's football
[1:42:06] games they should be posted about Jesus
[1:42:09] Christ amen
[1:42:10] but they're just so consumed or the
[1:42:13] women are boasting about you know
[1:42:15] getting drunk or the new year you know
[1:42:18] and going to vacation bill they'll get
[1:42:21] excited on anything else but Jesus
[1:42:22] Christ that's what a church member sin
[1:42:25] loving Church produces it produces death
[1:42:29] but we should produce life amen
[1:42:33] hallelujah
[1:42:34] I'd say that's what it has in me I don't
[1:42:37] know about you but each day I fall more
[1:42:38] in love with Jesus I just want to do
[1:42:40] more for Jesus I was wanting to make
[1:42:42] sure that I'm doing everything I can do
[1:42:44] I'm making my calling election sure that
[1:42:47] I'm a real elected child of God okay
[1:42:54] that's the reason we
[1:42:56] Wars and troubles the world every nation
[1:42:58] is dominated by Satan who never heard
[1:43:03] many amens on that but that's the truth
[1:43:04] that's that the Lord now you we hear
[1:43:08] amens here right because we know every
[1:43:11] nation on earth is dominated by Satan
[1:43:12] Satan took up all the other nations I'm
[1:43:15] sorry Satan took Jesus up on the
[1:43:17] mountain and showing the United States
[1:43:18] and all the other kingdoms that said I
[1:43:19] will give them all to you if you'll bow
[1:43:21] down and worship me that's why I
[1:43:24] appreciated you know Tanya's prayer
[1:43:25] requests we want to pray for people in
[1:43:27] the government but we know overall the
[1:43:29] government's gonna go like this they're
[1:43:30] gonna keep going like this but there can
[1:43:32] be some few believers in there how many
[1:43:34] believe that we should pray God save
[1:43:37] them help them to take away abortion
[1:43:39] help them take away any evil
[1:43:41] law that's been made legal if they've
[1:43:45] made sin legal take it away God take it
[1:43:47] off the books
[1:43:48] do something say whatever you can amen
[1:43:51] all right here's a few more we're almost
[1:43:54] done almost done a few more brother
[1:43:57] madam said trinitarian is wrong thus
[1:43:58] saith the Lord father son Holy Ghost
[1:44:00] baptism is wrong thus saith the Lord
[1:44:02] Peter it was never Rome thus saith the
[1:44:03] Lord and we're at the end of the Gentile
[1:44:05] dispensation thus saith the Lord
[1:44:08] now this is one church I encourage you
[1:44:11] to go back and listen this one brother
[1:44:12] Branham says it's so nicely I was
[1:44:14] actually shocked when I listened to I
[1:44:16] was like whoa he was actually being real
[1:44:17] sweet he wasn't all like you know fiery
[1:44:20] you know like like we sometimes yeah let
[1:44:23] me say this with godly love the hour has
[1:44:26] approached where I can't hold still on
[1:44:27] these things no more it's too close to
[1:44:29] the coming see Trinitarian him is of the
[1:44:32] devil I say that thus saith the Lord
[1:44:35] look where it come from you come from
[1:44:37] the Nicaea Council and when the Catholic
[1:44:40] Church become in rulership the word
[1:44:42] Trinity is not even mentioned the entire
[1:44:43] book of the Bible and as far as three
[1:44:46] God's that's from Hell there's one God
[1:44:48] that's right now do you say then do you
[1:44:51] believe that all these people are
[1:44:52] Trinitarians are of hell no sir I
[1:44:54] believe they're Christians but the hours
[1:44:56] approaching brother when they're
[1:44:57] sincerely wrong you know I was I've been
[1:45:00] writing another book and I'm writing in
[1:45:02] the the Godhead chapter right now so
[1:45:04] this one means a lot to me right now
[1:45:05] but you know the Trinity says that the
[1:45:09] fathers
[1:45:09] fully God eternal God the sons eternal
[1:45:12] God the Holy Ghost is eternal God and
[1:45:14] there proof is on the baptism of Jesus
[1:45:17] now have you ever thought about this I
[1:45:19] just thought about this for the first
[1:45:20] time ever today they said Jesus baptism
[1:45:23] there was three people right there's the
[1:45:25] Sun the water the spirits like a dove
[1:45:28] and the father's the voice now let me
[1:45:33] try to catch what they believe they
[1:45:35] believe one person is fully got in the
[1:45:38] water the third the second person the
[1:45:40] first person says this is my beloved Son
[1:45:43] in whom I'm well pleased and the third
[1:45:46] person who is fully God comes down like
[1:45:47] a dove and lives on him so you have
[1:45:53] fully God getting anointed with fully
[1:45:56] God are you kidding me
[1:46:01] why does if Jesus is already eternal
[1:46:05] full eternal why does he need the third
[1:46:09] person to anoint him
[1:46:12] if that isn't try theism to believe in
[1:46:15] three gods I don't know what is these
[1:46:19] people Church are completely blind I
[1:46:21] don't care how new their glasses are
[1:46:23] they're completely blind they think a
[1:46:26] third God has to come and enjoy a second
[1:46:29] God but the reality of it is this is
[1:46:34] what I say in the book here of them
[1:46:35] writing if you can just look at it
[1:46:37] the Father Son Holy Ghost the father the
[1:46:40] Holy Ghost are the same self spirit well
[1:46:42] that takes you down to two people right
[1:46:44] oh he knows although we know it's not
[1:46:46] two people the father whole ego goes to
[1:46:49] the self same spirit right it's one
[1:46:51] spirit it's not two spirits well I think
[1:46:52] it's done in two but then you know God
[1:46:55] the invisible father is the really the
[1:46:57] only one person that invisible spirit
[1:47:00] made a body and that one invisible
[1:47:03] spirit made a body and come to dwell in
[1:47:05] that body it's one person manifesting
[1:47:09] himself in three ways it's one person
[1:47:13] making himself known in three different
[1:47:15] ways okay just like at the burning bush
[1:47:19] there was a voice of the burning wish
[1:47:21] and there was a fire at the burning bush
[1:47:23] but that wasn't to people it was one
[1:47:26] person that one person made like a he
[1:47:29] put on his coat this coat God God is
[1:47:32] invisible spirit this coat was like the
[1:47:34] fire he came and hid in the fire and
[1:47:37] then he started talking out the fire and
[1:47:39] there the fire was burdened like that
[1:47:40] right there this is the fire all the
[1:47:42] children is that help the children in
[1:47:43] the burning bush this was the fire but
[1:47:46] God was hiding behind there said tell
[1:47:48] him I am tell him that I am sent you it
[1:47:53] wasn't two people right because the Holy
[1:47:55] Ghost and fire
[1:47:56] remember the ghost came is fire on the
[1:47:58] day of Pentecost that whole that's that
[1:48:02] is God that's that's God coming down and
[1:48:05] putting on a mask putting on a fire see
[1:48:10] just because there's three
[1:48:11] manifestations doesn't mean there's
[1:48:13] three gods
[1:48:14] it just means God is so powerful he can
[1:48:16] hide himself in as many ways as he wants
[1:48:19] and if that's not true then on the day
[1:48:24] of Pentecost how many licks of fire
[1:48:25] weathers anybody know how many licks of
[1:48:27] fire were there a hundred and twenty
[1:48:30] what does that mean the Holy Ghost is
[1:48:32] 120 different persons or what how many
[1:48:36] persons are in the Godhead what's 120
[1:48:38] plus two 122 so the Holy Ghost is or God
[1:48:41] is now under 22 persons see how foolish
[1:48:45] that is see how ridiculous that is and
[1:48:48] people swallow that just because they
[1:48:50] know they're scared to say the Trinity
[1:48:51] is wrong when it's not even in the Bible
[1:48:53] if you add to the Bible God as plagues
[1:48:58] right if you take from the Bible God
[1:49:01] takes away book of life your name on the
[1:49:03] book of life we just say what the Bible
[1:49:05] says amen the times coming where we just
[1:49:12] got to be honest there sincerely wrong
[1:49:15] and say in love speak the truth in love
[1:49:17] how long have I been preaching alright
[1:49:20] I'm almost done thus saith the Lord the
[1:49:23] baptism using the title father son Holy
[1:49:25] Ghost is false thus saith the Lord I
[1:49:27] command every one of you on here and on
[1:49:28] tape that has been baptized the name of
[1:49:30] Jesus Christ be rebaptised again in the
[1:49:32] name of Jesus Christ I think everybody
[1:49:36] here has been baptized the name of Jesus
[1:49:37] Christ is that right okay I think so
[1:49:40] everybody that saved me give their heart
[1:49:42] to Lord yeah I think Tonya I we talked
[1:49:43] about that right time you're right you
[1:49:44] were baptized the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:45] Christ okay and it was it was Jesus
[1:49:51] Christ was that the name okay the same
[1:49:58] day okay well let's talk about that
[1:49:59] after church yeah yeah I like to talk to
[1:50:01] you about that I didn't I thought I
[1:50:02] maybe I misunderstood you
[1:50:04] that that's a that's a born that's
[1:50:07] really important
[1:50:09] okay all right well let's yeah let's
[1:50:11] talk about dad I appreciate that I know
[1:50:15] this is really helpful for you because
[1:50:16] you've not really heard about brother
[1:50:18] Branham as much but I want everybody to
[1:50:21] see that everything he said is right in
[1:50:23] the Word of God it's right here in the
[1:50:25] Word of God and now I don't know maybe I
[1:50:29] could yeah let me see if I can pull this
[1:50:30] up real quick there was five baptisms in
[1:50:34] the book of Acts yeah here it is oh yeah
[1:50:37] I just
[1:50:38] you're here to skew number Tanya can you
[1:50:39] see this um it's not really it's not
[1:50:41] dark but Jesus said Matthew jesus said
[1:50:43] fives and all he goes ten days later
[1:50:46] Peter said Jesus Christ a few weeks
[1:50:49] later Philip said Lord Jesus then Peter
[1:50:53] said baptize them a name of Lord a few
[1:50:56] months later a few years later Paul said
[1:50:58] baptize the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:00] Christ and then Paul later said his
[1:51:03] testing when I was baptized the name of
[1:51:04] Lord so if you put all three of those
[1:51:06] together you have Lord Father Son Jesus
[1:51:08] Holy Ghost Christ Lord Jesus Christ no
[1:51:12] one was ever baptized with people saying
[1:51:14] titles father son Holy Ghost it was
[1:51:16] always in the literal name of the Lord
[1:51:18] Jesus Christ does that make sense so
[1:51:21] that's why brother Branham as a prophet
[1:51:25] that's why he could say that church and
[1:51:28] he could be right how many believe this
[1:51:31] is right any man it's not saith the Lord
[1:51:34] I mean this is the scripture now I'm
[1:51:39] gonna skip bad
[1:51:40] this is one about yeah let me skip down
[1:51:43] to Peter and I can prove to you by the
[1:51:46] written word out of the Bible exactly
[1:51:47] the days and years of Peter never did
[1:51:49] leave Palestine but one time and went to
[1:51:51] Babylon down by the Euphrates never was
[1:51:53] in Rome by the Scriptures thus saith the
[1:51:55] Lord it's all pagan idea they try to
[1:51:57] make Peter the first pope of rome that's
[1:51:59] thus saith the Lord it's wrong he was
[1:52:01] not that probe of Rome
[1:52:02] that's thus saith the Lord that's a lie
[1:52:04] cuz it's not in the Bible
[1:52:06] nothing about that in the Bible now
[1:52:09] here's one that we're getting to where
[1:52:10] we are remember this is the ending of
[1:52:12] the Gentile dispensation remember it's
[1:52:14] thus saith the Lord it's time for the
[1:52:16] Gentile age to cease we're at the end
[1:52:18] time that doesn't mean we pack it in and
[1:52:21] try to just quit and give up and feel
[1:52:22] sorry for ourselves we keep working till
[1:52:24] Jesus comes you and I are the 11th hour
[1:52:27] workers ain't man somebody's gotta work
[1:52:29] amen
[1:52:30] it's gotta be you and I and when you
[1:52:32] give your tithes and offerings that's
[1:52:34] helping with Simon work it's helping who
[1:52:36] did we send it to Oh Jason and Mars I
[1:52:38] gave him a thousand dollars for his next
[1:52:40] trip and he's going next month we got to
[1:52:43] work till Jesus comes remember there's a
[1:52:46] church now in Turkey because Jason
[1:52:47] DeMars work which we've supported
[1:52:49] because of that there's now a church in
[1:52:52] Turkey that hasn't had a Christian
[1:52:54] Church for five hundred years and you
[1:52:57] and I had a little part in that amen
[1:52:59] that's all we're a little Church then we
[1:53:02] take a little part we just got a new
[1:53:04] heart to God God will Express us a new a
[1:53:06] little part cuz we're a little Church so
[1:53:09] let's just do it by God's grace but
[1:53:13] don't quit don't give up we can't get
[1:53:14] discouraged we can't feel sorry for
[1:53:16] ourselves we got to just find our place
[1:53:18] do our position and be happy with it and
[1:53:20] just do all we can for Jesus Christ I'm
[1:53:23] almost done here bear with me now this
[1:53:26] gets down to this gets down to us now
[1:53:28] this may not apply to us but I want to
[1:53:30] read it anyway because this is this is
[1:53:33] true this is what's happening today the
[1:53:35] Bible said because of iniquity abounds
[1:53:37] the love of many shall wax cold so the
[1:53:39] real love for God is getting less and
[1:53:41] less and less and less and less than
[1:53:43] this unless colder and colder and colder
[1:53:46] the real love of God is going to get so
[1:53:48] so so cold now this isn't
[1:53:52] Chicago now while the people are moving
[1:53:54] down this is an altar call still coming
[1:53:57] as long as people are coming in and
[1:53:58] we're going to hold it I don't think we
[1:54:00] have too much more time in this in the
[1:54:01] world to make these kind of calls this
[1:54:03] is in 1961 now just remember I speak in
[1:54:07] the name of the Lord the hour is coming
[1:54:09] when you know I don't know if this is
[1:54:10] you in Chicago or you like the bride of
[1:54:13] the church you will scream for a meeting
[1:54:16] like this you won't be so anxious to get
[1:54:19] up and go out but be too late then so
[1:54:23] brother Hannah says when you get to the
[1:54:24] spot where you're screaming oh I wish we
[1:54:27] could have a altar call it's too late
[1:54:30] then so we got to say God give us altar
[1:54:33] calls now let's see I think this person
[1:54:37] is probably was to Chicago personally
[1:54:41] because you know we serve services where
[1:54:43] people come to the altar but there's not
[1:54:45] really like sinners here you know it's
[1:54:46] mostly Saints so but just so you know
[1:54:51] brother Branham says it was in the name
[1:54:53] of the Lord the people there would get
[1:54:55] to the spot where they would scream God
[1:54:57] give us a revival like that again but
[1:54:59] it's too late then that might have meant
[1:55:01] you know brother Branham would have died
[1:55:02] and could never come back and do one I
[1:55:04] don't know I'm not sure how to interpret
[1:55:06] that I'm just letting you know there's
[1:55:08] gonna come a time when people are crying
[1:55:09] out for God and he's not going to be
[1:55:11] there so we've got a crowd to God while
[1:55:13] we can access him right now I'm almost
[1:55:16] done bear with me now a lot of people
[1:55:19] have put a lot of different ideas on the
[1:55:21] movies on the bride but let's read what
[1:55:22] brother Graham said now real quietly I'm
[1:55:25] asking you consecrated men and women who
[1:55:27] really know God how many really know God
[1:55:30] most of them it's very strange it seems
[1:55:32] like it's that way altar calls that I
[1:55:34] make is mostly all men you know in a
[1:55:37] regular run it's women but it's all men
[1:55:39] here I think there's one woman out at
[1:55:41] the altar tonight maybe two it's usually
[1:55:42] the women but somehow or another I guess
[1:55:44] it seemed like that women think I talk
[1:55:46] against them
[1:55:46] I don't sister 3 I believe someone said
[1:55:49] they see can't see over the top of the
[1:55:51] altar all right some of you consecrated
[1:55:54] Christians come up here and stand with
[1:55:55] me in prayer just a minute on the altar
[1:55:58] wherever you are on the platform
[1:55:59] somebody that really knows God just
[1:56:03] knows how to stand
[1:56:05] here just a few minutes for prayer with
[1:56:07] them then we'll dismiss the audience
[1:56:10] everybody be real reverent now don't
[1:56:13] leave just come here and stand around so
[1:56:16] brother man was asking for people to
[1:56:17] come up and pray with those who are
[1:56:20] coming up for prayer he's asking mature
[1:56:23] Christians now real Christians who
[1:56:25] really know how to pray come on up here
[1:56:27] move up here he says to pray for them
[1:56:29] and then he says some of you people that
[1:56:32] really believe this to be the truth that
[1:56:34] we're entering another age we're
[1:56:35] entering the rapture age you know the
[1:56:39] church can't go in its condition and it
[1:56:41] can't get any better it must get worse
[1:56:42] how many knows that say Amen it's got to
[1:56:44] get worse and it can't go like this it's
[1:56:46] got to be something and it's moving
[1:56:48] right now he says this isn't 65 I
[1:56:53] believe the move is on for the bride
[1:56:56] that's the truth that's thus saith the
[1:56:59] Lord so he's saying the people that are
[1:57:03] coming forth that's the move of God the
[1:57:06] move is on the bride the people who are
[1:57:08] drawing near to God right now amen oh
[1:57:10] thank God the moves on me Church the
[1:57:13] move should be on you we're the ones
[1:57:16] that are drawing to God and we're the
[1:57:18] ones that want to pray with people amen
[1:57:21] the thing is just getting them here to
[1:57:22] pray with them these people are so in
[1:57:25] love with the world they don't want to
[1:57:26] come to church they don't want to do
[1:57:27] nothing but God help us to be ready when
[1:57:30] they come now now look we said he says
[1:57:33] the moves on the bride they'll say the
[1:57:35] Lord now I'm moving up consecrated
[1:57:37] Christians that once your record to find
[1:57:41] out that those who come sincerely that
[1:57:44] you want to come and offer prayer with
[1:57:45] them as your brothers and sisters come
[1:57:47] up around the altar he's saying the move
[1:57:49] is on the bride right now God isn't
[1:57:51] drawing his bride to him and then he
[1:57:52] says move up and pray for these people
[1:57:55] look at the power of prayer standing
[1:57:59] around her just a moment for prayer
[1:58:01] someone else want to come stand around
[1:58:02] here just kneel down by them just walk
[1:58:04] where you met around these menu women
[1:58:06] sweet humbly ask prayer for them to see
[1:58:10] some people make this some different
[1:58:11] thing but program saying the move is on
[1:58:13] the bride it's God drawing the bride to
[1:58:16] him getting ready for the rapture
[1:58:18] and he said it's going on right now the
[1:58:21] move is on the bride whoever God is
[1:58:23] calling that's the bride whoever
[1:58:27] responds to the call of God the moves on
[1:58:29] them
[1:58:30] thank you lord moving me praise God
[1:58:32] that's my prayer you've heard this one
[1:58:36] many times let's read again thus say the
[1:58:38] Lord
[1:58:39] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[1:58:40] that place for that's all there was
[1:58:43] there no matter how many how much
[1:58:45] religious demonstrations how many good
[1:58:46] deeds you've done whatever you've done
[1:58:47] that won't count on that day
[1:58:49] it'll take perfect love so whatever you
[1:58:51] do you lay aside everything else in here
[1:58:53] just so fill with the love of God so you
[1:58:54] can love those who hate you take a
[1:59:00] moment take a moment who who do you know
[1:59:02] that hates you that's the person you
[1:59:07] gotta love who hates you who if they
[1:59:10] could do it would just speak evil would
[1:59:11] spit in your face or who would just the
[1:59:15] Bible bro Graham says perfect love is
[1:59:18] loving them that's that's perfect love
[1:59:22] thus saith the Lord that's the love
[1:59:23] that's gonna get over there I'm gonna
[1:59:30] skip just for times sake
[1:59:31] now remember but Graham says this at the
[1:59:34] end of the seventh seal it's moving that
[1:59:35] cycle the rapture cycle now it's coming
[1:59:37] up close so the thing for you is
[1:59:38] remember that I speak to you the name of
[1:59:40] the Lord be prepared if you don't know
[1:59:42] what time something can happen to see
[1:59:44] that so that's why I brought this out we
[1:59:46] got to be ready at any time and remember
[1:59:48] we had somebody to speak of the name of
[1:59:49] Lord to us William Branham and we must
[1:59:52] remember these things we must keep all
[1:59:54] these things right in our forefront of
[1:59:57] our minds I think these are my last four
[2:00:00] you let me look I think I got a couple
[2:00:00] more yeah they've got four or five more
[2:00:06] there must be someone rise up that's got
[2:00:09] to come for its thus saith the Lord
[2:00:10] Malachi the fourth chapter that's
[2:00:12] exactly what he said would be the sign
[2:00:14] just before the coming of the Great and
[2:00:15] dreadful day of the Lord I'll send you
[2:00:17] Elijah what will he do he turned the
[2:00:19] hearts of the children back to the
[2:00:21] doctor and see that the doctor and all
[2:00:24] these doctors I just preached right
[2:00:26] marriage and divorce baptism God had all
[2:00:29] these things he turns our hearts back to
[2:00:31] the by
[2:00:32] doctrine of the fathers back to the
[2:00:35] Bible
[2:00:35] are these denominational difference and
[2:00:37] come back to the Bible back to God
[2:00:39] that's what he would do notice what a
[2:00:41] time we're living in now look he says
[2:00:44] again we stand today with thus saith the
[2:00:45] Lord that the water baptism in the last
[2:00:48] days is to be in the name of Jesus
[2:00:49] Christ he said another man will stand up
[2:00:52] perform miracles a trinitarian just
[2:00:54] showing the anointing falls on the just
[2:00:55] and the unjust but the Bible said in the
[2:00:58] last days he would send the spirit of
[2:01:00] Elijah would call the people the Church
[2:01:02] of God back to the original faith like
[2:01:04] it was in the beginning of the word that
[2:01:06] word was confirmed the Son of Man these
[2:01:08] last days the same as it was in Sodom
[2:01:10] yesterday today and forever he promised
[2:01:12] to do it's God's promise it's thus saith
[2:01:14] the Lord now remember it's thus saith
[2:01:18] the Lord it will come to pass in this
[2:01:20] day now search over the world take every
[2:01:23] call every clan I think every man every
[2:01:25] church I charge you in Christ's name to
[2:01:27] do this you preachers I charge you to
[2:01:29] read the newspapers are taken sitting
[2:01:31] right now I'm sorry too consideration
[2:01:33] anywhere you wanted to go and see if it
[2:01:35] isn't on the earth right now let the
[2:01:36] spirit of Elijah that's quite a
[2:01:38] challenge he says I challenge you in
[2:01:41] Jesus Christ's name see if the spirit of
[2:01:43] Elijah isn't on the earth right now my
[2:01:46] hallelujah thank God what a what a man
[2:01:50] who knows what he's talking about that's
[2:01:53] a man who knows what he's talking about
[2:01:55] thus saith the Lord he said the spirit
[2:01:57] of Elijah is here right now thus saith
[2:01:59] the Lord let's then this last quote now
[2:02:10] church this is what we need to do I've
[2:02:13] said in all along what we need to do but
[2:02:15] this is ultimately what we need to do if
[2:02:17] we I could just put it really generally
[2:02:19] we need to unite with thus saith the
[2:02:21] Lord God is uniting his bride she's
[2:02:26] coming together from the east in the
[2:02:27] West the north of the south there's a
[2:02:30] uniting time and that's on right now
[2:02:32] what is she uniting for the rapture
[2:02:35] God's getting her ready yes sir uniting
[2:02:38] what is she uniting with with the word
[2:02:40] for all heavens earth will pass away but
[2:02:42] my words will never pass away she's
[2:02:44] uniting herself with thus saith the Lord
[2:02:47] regardless of what any denomination or
[2:02:49] anybody says she's uniting herself she's
[2:02:53] getting ready why she's the bride that's
[2:02:56] right and she's United herself with her
[2:02:58] bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the
[2:03:00] word in the beginning was the word and
[2:03:03] the Word was with God and the Word was
[2:03:05] God and the Word was made flesh and
[2:03:07] dwelt among us hallelujah let's give
[2:03:10] them a round of applause amen Malachi
[2:03:16] you see Church huh all these doctrines
[2:03:19] aren't can see how the doctrines are
[2:03:20] important we have to unite with all the
[2:03:22] word we can't say well I just believe
[2:03:25] these certain things we got to unite
[2:03:27] with all the Bible look at all those
[2:03:30] well there's four there and we know
[2:03:33] there's more than that there's three
[2:03:35] plus there's 10 I just got through let's
[2:03:39] see 13 16 18 I just got through 18 of
[2:03:44] them today what about all the other ones
[2:03:48] we got to unite with thus saith the Lord
[2:03:51] that's what we're supposed to do the
[2:03:53] move is on the bride it moves on you and
[2:03:56] I let's keep doing all we do Church
[2:03:59] let's keep supporting the move of God
[2:04:02] the work of God our local church
[2:04:04] let's support it with our tithes and
[2:04:06] offerings that supported with our
[2:04:07] attendance let's support it with main
[2:04:09] thing that's supported with our prayers
[2:04:12] that's the only way anything gets done
[2:04:14] that's the only way faith muscles get
[2:04:16] established is when we pray
[2:04:18] in the spirit how many believe that I
[2:04:22] believe that all my heart only way
[2:04:26] anything gets done is through prayer
[2:04:28] amen
[2:04:29] prayer it's done through prayer let's
[2:04:35] bow our heads here I want to pray with
[2:04:37] you I want to ask God as we approach
[2:04:49] 2019 to help us to unite with every thus
[2:04:52] saith the Lord there is and especially
[2:04:55] with prayer as I said I know you believe
[2:04:59] it
[2:04:59] same Adil's us hardest with prayer it's
[2:05:02] easier to do everything else but prayer
[2:05:04] is the most it's the most powerful
[2:05:07] weapon so Satan our battles us the most
[2:05:09] powerfully against our prayer life and I
[2:05:14] think we all want to see our neighbors
[2:05:15] save don't we I want to see my neighbors
[2:05:18] saved I want to see people saved it only
[2:05:22] comes through this prayer this
[2:05:24] dedication to God let's pray here
[2:05:27] Heavenly Father these are your people or
[2:05:31] they love your word I love your work
[2:05:35] ever since I've heard at Lord it's just
[2:05:37] set my heart afire I've given my whole
[2:05:41] life to it
[2:05:42] Lord I'd have another way
[2:05:48] it's a joy to serve the Lord it's a joy
[2:05:54] to know that Jesus Christ is the same
[2:05:55] yesterday today and forever father we've
[2:06:00] gone over these 18 different thus saith
[2:06:03] the Lord's and Lord as we pray now lord
[2:06:10] help us to unite with every single one
[2:06:11] of them Lord I think the one that
[2:06:15] affects most of us is the prayer uniting
[2:06:18] with prayer being more devoted to prayer
[2:06:26] building up our most holy faith we're
[2:06:32] thankful for all the brothers that when
[2:06:33] they see a immorally dress women they
[2:06:36] turn their heads we're thankful for the
[2:06:38] sisters if any man tries to look at them
[2:06:41] or any man tries to flirt with them they
[2:06:42] just turn into their heads we're
