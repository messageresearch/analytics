God is so good to us hallelujah let's open up uh I got a few or just a scripture here I like to read by the grace of God let's open up to Matthew chapter 6 here by the grace of the Lord Matthew chapter 6 start there at verse [Music] one Matthew chapter 6 verse one by the title tonight i' like to kind of I've had this thought on my heart for a few weeks I I like to call it rewards crme s and Treasures in Heaven tonight I'd like to look at that tonight rewards crowns and Treasures in Heaven I want to look at that by God's grace you know so often the enemy wants us to look at just the temporal things but Jesus said lay up your Treasures where in heaven and you know it's a Heavenly treasure when a moth can't eat it right rust can't corrupt it you know it's a Heavenly treasure when none of that can touch you right it won't fade away Matthew chapter 6 verse one praise God now um I'm just going to read verse one and then we'll skip ahead a few verses so Matthew 61 take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven now for those of you know that he goes through alms and prayer but we'll read through this later but let's skip to verse 19 so necessarily not necessarily the public things is what we get rewards for it's the secret things that we get rewards for verse 19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust do corrupt so if a moth can eat it or if rust can corrupt it it's probably not a reward right probably not the kind of reward we want and where thieves break through and steal so if you have a real reward from God a thief can't steal it because it's not something physical it's something that's recorded in heaven praise God verse 20 but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it know to God by raising your hand let's pray together Heavenly Father be with us tonight Lord these this burden has been on my heart for a few weeks Lord waiting to kind of find the right timing Lord when to Lord bring these scriptures in and I just pray you bless us here tonight Lord God minister to us Lord by thy Spirit Lord and I pray you just help us to set our affections on things above Lord God that you might be glorified in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen amen God bless you being praise God if you need your bibles if got your Bibles handy I need a lot of help reading tonight I got numerous scriptures uh we like to uh look at by the grace of the Lord God is so good to us like I said I've been looking for a time to kind of bring these scriptures in uh and we want to make sure we get them at rewards crowns and Treasures in Heaven you want to look at that by the grace of the Lord uh first thing I want to just lay some Foundation here uh about how the treasure uh first before you lay up Treasures in Heaven you got to have the treasure inside of youen praise God you have to have the treasure in you which is what God's spirit God's uh seal of the Holy Ghost you got to have that in you and then you'll want to lay up Treasures in Heaven praise God so let's look at some of those scriptures let's go to 2 Corinthians 4 if we could let's start there by the grace of the Lord 2 Corinthians 4 I just kind of that with this be my outline first get the treasure in you and then we'll see what Treasures how you get Treasures in Heaven and then we'll look at rewards what rewards Jesus promise for your works here on Earth and then Crown the crown you get and then I like to look if we have time at brother bram's beyond the curtain of time experience and he also had a dream about when crowns were given out I'd like to look at that tonight that's kind of my outline here by the grace of the Lord okay so Second Corinthians 4 now I want to get down to seven but I want to start there let's start at verse six okay so now you ready to go second Corinthians 4 Malachi can you read verse six and seven sir for God who commanded the light to shine out Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us amen praise God so our hearts were darkened but then the Light of Christ Shone Upon Our Hearts is that what the scripture says and now when the knowledge of Christ and he was the Messiah died for us Rose for us forgave us of our sins when that becomes a reality and we really accept it believe it then we have treasure in our vessels amen because we have faith inside of us now look at verse eight now look you can have all the hardships in the world going on around you but if you got the Treasure of Christ in your heart you can overcome everything amen look at verse eight we are troubled on every side Paul says every side so if he turn this way he's got trouble this way trouble this way trouble I got troubles with my family troubles with my friends troubles with my children troubles at the job I got troubles all around me right but as long as you got treasure in Earth and vessels you'll be an overcomer amen we're troubled on every side yet not distressed so see we can have trouble yet not let it get us down so much where we're distressed about it we are perplexed but not in despair so we're not despairing like there's no hope we have hope praise God persecuted but not forsaken amen cast down but not destroyed I might have been cast down I might have thrown off to the side by all my friends but I wasn't destroyed amen might be persecuted by family and all these things like that but the Bible said you're not forsaken because God can't forsake his own children amen look at verse 10 always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus Jesus might be made manifest in our body so see it's like we write we did yesterday in our Bible study dying every day you die every day we're always bearing that dying in our body dying to ourselves praise God okay so that's the scripture I want to start with there by the grace of the Lord okay now let's uh if you have your Bibles let's go to Colossians so Colossians is a few books after that Galatians Ephesians Colossians Colossians chapter 2 verse3 Colossians 2:3 all right now we'll read verses uh two and three Lydia can you read Colossians 2 2 and three please darling that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love unto all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of the god of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all the treasures of living amen where's all the treasures at in Christ Jesus amen all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge all the treasures you could possibly want are in Christ and Christ is the word so the holy spirit will reveal the treasures of his will for your life inside of the Bible inside the pages of the Bible praise God so that's where all the treasure all the treasures in Christ so when we get Christ in us now we have treasure in Earth and vessels praise God Amen now let's go to the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 12 Matthew chapter 12 Matthew chapter 12 Matthew 12:35 I got that right there brother Austin you got that 12:35 brother yep okay can you read that please a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things praise God so everybody's got right something inside of them right you either have a evil treasure or you have a Godly treasure praise the Lord and whatever comes out of your mouth shows what kind of treasur is in your heart it's either the corrupt treasure right Treasures of the earth like got to have this it's got to have that all this stuff down here or you have The Treasure of God's word coming out of your mouth amen now go to chapter 133 because it talks about how uh we look for the kingdom of God as our treasure okay 13 chapter 13 verse 44 1344 now verse 44 I'll read that again the Kingdom of Heaven is like in unto treasure hidden in a field the which when a manath found hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sth all that he hath and buth the field praise the Lord so the Kingdom of Heaven is like a field it's a treasure hid and you got to sell out everything in order to gain that treasure praise God and how many know what brother Ram said the kingdom of heaven was brother BR said the Kingdom of Heaven is Christ in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so that's what it's like to be born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's like a treasure you got to sell out everything to get that treasure that's in the field that experience with God Amen Hallelujah now go to verse 52 in the same chapter all right verse 52 now this is a scripture for preachers right here uh if you know the context of this verse 52 then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is a householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old praise God so someone who instructs in the kingdom of God brings forth out of his treasure new things and old things praise God Amen you get New Revelations you're preaching you got old Revelations that stir your heart back up you bring it out of your heart amen someone who instructs in the kingdom of God Amen that's what we try to do every time we try to pray and ask God to lead us in the services and help us to bring forth new things and old things praise God out of our hearts things that God has placed in there by the grace of the Lord amen now let's uh uh so first you got treasure in you how many want treasure inside of you praise God we have this treasure this this baptism of the holy spirit in Earth and vessels now let's look at uh how we get the other Treasures a treasure in heaven so let's go to back back to Matthew chapter 6 where we had our text let's look at a little bit more about this by the grace of God all right so we read chapter one right about alms okay so I want to make sure we read about that now alms are any uh offering that you give to people okay so if you see a man out on the street or a woman out there on the street um that's and you give them something that's an Al okay that's giving something like if even if you just give them food even if you just give them a dollar or something like that anything you have that you give them that's considered an Al now look at verse we read verse one look at verse two therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and the streets that they may have Glory of men where that in you they have their reward okay so whenever when you tell everybody hey I'm going to go do this and I'm going to do something real nice for people Jesus says you already got your reward you're G to have treasure in heaven for that one verse three but when thou doest Ms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father seeth for which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly so when you this is a wonderful equation when you do secret things God uh God honors you publicly praise God you do secret things God honors you publicly openly praise God that's that's the that's the uh we say the reward or the system of God God wants us to do secret things and then he rewards us openly all right now um verse six now look at verse six here's our prayer scripture we're supposed to pray in a secret place uh and then God again rewards us openly verse six but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to the Father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly amen so secret giving secret prayers and then God rewards you publicly so private prayers private arms giving and public honor he gives us amen or public rewards praise the Lord that's the law of God Amen now fasting verse 16 remember fasting is giving up meals it can be giving up all water and all food or it can just be drinking water for example The Book of Daniel talks about how Daniel gave up the the the Choice Foods so he still ate a little bit of food for 21 days uh had to eat a little bit of food but he didn't eat the best foods so that was his fasting and remember at the end of the 21 days the angel finally came to him because Gabriel helped him out in heaven or I'm sorry in the spiritual Realms there so he had different kinds of fast sometimes it's fasting of all food sometimes it's fasting of just Choice Foods now verse 16 moreover when you fast be not as the Hypocrites of a sad countenance so don't be sad when you're not eating be happy for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face so make it look like you're all healthy and happy that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly everybody get this uh the same picture from Jesus do everything in private right in secret and then God rewards us openly praise God what a blessing all now let's go to the next scripture here let's go to Matthew 19:21 Matthew 19:21 Matthew 19:21 Malachi you got that buddy can you read that Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou Hast to give to the poor and thou shall have Treasures in Heaven and come and follow me praise God Amen now how many know he's speaking of of course the Rich Young Ruler here right now if you know the scripture he kept all the Commandments except one he had a lust for money right and Jesus Jesus says if you want to be perfect sell all you have and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me amen so we see Jesus uh enjoys that we obey his commands but he wants to get every little shred of selfishness out of our life remember brother said you can keep 99% of the word but if there's 1% you don't keep you can miss it so what does that mean you got to sacrifice everything you got to surrender everything amen hallelujah you got to give up everything say God clean out all my heart this man was willing to give God 99% but I'm still going to keep my 1% of greed for money I won't give to the poor I need riches I'm I'm trusting in my riches and it showed he wasn't truly Sanctified was he although he could keep all the other Commandments just like Judas he could pretend and keep all the other Commandments but because of one thing because he didn't fully surrender everything he missed the kingdom of God and brother Ram said he missed being an apostle because Jesus said come follow me right and remember the maniac of gader who had all the demons he said Jesus can I follow you and Jesus said no stay there and be a witness to your people in Gad so this was a rare opportunity where Jesus says come follow me and he couldn't follow Jesus because he loved money and riches so much praise God now our troubles might not be money riches but what if it's lust and relationships right or what if it's some other type of a sin what if it's Pride what if it's arrogance what if it's anger other things just one thing can keep us from uh being born again from the kingdom of God is that right so we must come to Christ and say cleanse all of me whatever is my my my biggest battle help me to die to myself and help me to overcome it that I might have treasure in heaven and follow you amen glory that's what we need to do by God's grace all right now uh that was Matthew 19 okay now if we can let's go to Mark 10:21 and this might be a parallel Passage okay Mark 1021 okay yeah this is the same uh the same passage but I want you to see look at how Jesus uh looked at him him look my goodness look at verse 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him and said to him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me oh my look Jesus even loved this man Jesus loved the Rich Young Ruler now look at verse 22 brother also read verse 22 if you can brother look at look at that and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions amen so he went to church was just dramatized he went to church and Jesus said go sell everything and follow me and he left church all sad because he couldn't for forsake his riches praise God we must fully surrender everything and then only then can we follow Jesus and take up his cross we have to surrender all of our hopes all of our dreams all of our Earthly Desires in order to follow Christ Jesus amen that's what we're doing by the grace of the Lord amen all right that's a good scripture there now okay let's go to Luke chapter 12 now Luke chapter 12 this is how you store up Treasures in Heaven you have to sell out your greatest desires your greatest Earthly Temptations and you must live contrary to that natural desire and live according to the spiritual desire that God placed in your heart Luke 1213 I we'll start there 1213 okay let's at this this is a good uh this is a good story where Jesus uh has to tell this man don't worry about your inheritance don't worry about all this money that you want okay Mali can you read 13 14 15 please and one of the company said to him Master speak to my brother that he divided the inheritance with me I said to him man who made me a judge or divider over you I said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consists not in the abund the abundance of the things which he possesses amen praise God all right so we can see here that Jesus tells a man don't worry so much about all your Earthly money right and look what he he gives him a parable because of this because this man's like give tell my brother to give me my money you're a rabbi you're a preacher tell him to give me my money Jesus says well let me tell you a parable so you can learn about this okay L can you read 16 17 18 and and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth PL and he thought within himself saying what should I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this I will do I pull I will pull down my Barns and build greater there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods amen verse 19 and I will say to my soul soul thou Hast much Goods laid up for many years take thine East eat drink and be married but God said un him thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou Hast provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and not rich toward God isn't that powerful so this man said I he said I'm going to take care of my my retirement I'm going to lay up all this all these Goods I'm gon to build greater bars I'm so wealthy I'm gonna build up all this and I'll have an easy future I'll just sit back and relax and I'll just eat drink and be merry right but God said you fool you're laying up Treasures for yourself on Earth instead of laying up Treasures in Heaven praise the Lord can youbody see that now there's nothing wrong with saving money it it uh what matters is how much you save and your motive and objective for saving money praise God brother Ram said there'll be a lot of millionaires in hell right there'll be a lot of Penny errors in hell as well no matter if you're rich or poor but there'll be a lot of rich people in hell we know that Jesus said that it's hard for rich man to get to heaven there's nothing wrong with saving but when you're a Christian and you see somebody that has a need James chapter 2 says we should help them if we have Living Faith if we have dead Faith we'll just say oh God bless you and we won't help them but if we've got real live faith will try to help out people that need our help amen now here's where I want here's where my inspiration came this is from the church age book chapter 4 brother bam said this all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense or the rewards of God are too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that that are available to the faithful Saints Hallelujah so what what does that say we don't spend enough time on rewards in heaven do we we don't brother said we need to so Jesus showed us how to lay up Treasures in Heaven pray in secret Give in secret right fast in secret anything in your heart that you when you feel like you need to help somebody go help them out that's how you lay up Treasures in Heaven things on earth that are destroyed are not Treasures in Heaven praise God Hallelujah hope everybody can see that by the grace of the Lord now I want to skip down here by the grace of the Lord okay we saw those scriptures I want to go a little bit further okay so that's how we con see if you have this treasure in you if you have the word of God in you the love of Christ Jesus in you then you will want to labor for Heavenly treasure and the word of God won't make you sad you won't leave church sad if God asks you to give something up like if God ask you to give up a relationship or God ask you to give up uh all this money or whatever you have you won't leave sad but you'll gladly do it because you love Christ Jesus amen all right now let's if we can let's look at some rewards some specific rewards uh that God gives to us here God promises to give us the rewards now I want to just first go over this uh mark if you got your Bible Mark 10 Matthew Mark and then Luke but let's go to Mark chapter 10 I want to read this one especially for our brother Austin that's here uh just to encourage him and different ones that have left family members because Jesus promises you if you leave family members for me I will bless you on the Earth right now some rewards you get now other rewards you get later all right so here's a clear scripture about rewards we get right now Mark 10 10 now I want to uh start at verse 28 so Austin can you read 28 29 and 30 brother and Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed thee and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that has left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the gospel but he shall receive aund fold now in this time how and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and the world to come eternal life amen is't that a promise when did Jesus say we get it right now praise God if you leave friends family if you sell your lands uh to follow Christ Jesus he said you'll receive a h hundredfold now amen hallelujah that's true so if our family rejects us guess what we inherit a bigger family praise the lord we uh I we could take you to any message church that we're in fellowship with and if you need a a place to stay they let you stay in their house if you need food they'd give you food right because when you leave the world God is bound to take care of you praise God because he's your child and you in the Christian body in the Christian Network we'd say of of Holy Ghost filled believers they will take care of all God's people Jesus said that reward is right now and then the future reward is what eternal life amen eternal life he said in the world to come so there's a world now there's a world to come and we get uh hundredfold now and eternal life in the world to come beautiful scripture praise God now let's look at some of the scriptures here uh that will help us to know rewards all right let's look at some of these I got numerous scriptures about rewards okay let's go to ma Matthew 5:12 Mali can you get Matthew 512 Lydia can you get James 1:12 so ma Matthew 5:12 Malachi and Lydia James 1:12 he Malachi can you read 512 please rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you amen so you have a reward in heaven if you're persecuted on this Earth if people make fun of you being a Christian if people mock you or even try to hurt you physically Jesus Promised there's a reward in heaven let's read verse 11 because I should have read that blessed are ye when men shall revile you that means speak evil persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake praise God great is your reward in heaven Amen Hallelujah Jesus Promised when you if you will get through all this persecution now I'll have a reward for you later now Lydia is going to read James 1:12 you don't have to turn there but Lydia go ahead and read that please blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he Strife you shall receive the Crown of Life the Lord has promised to them that love amen so church we just have to endure let's say endure ready endure what's endure me just persevere through it if you can persevere and just fight through all the trials all the Temptations then the Bible said you have a Crown of Life laying up for you because you love the Lord amen as you love the Lord you learn to deal with persecutions you learn to deal with Temptations you're able to overcome them because love conquers all temp ation does it not love for Jesus will conquer any trial any Temptation uh any trick of the devil any device of Satan if you love Christ it'll help you overcome that and you have a crown of righteousness waiting for you in heaven amen so what are you g to reward for staying true to Christ despite persecution amen despite people falsely saying evil things against you God will reward you for that amen okay let's go to Mark 9:41 and brother Austin can you read that markk 9 41 when you get there yes whenever you're ready brother whenever you get there or who whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to CHR verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward amen praise God did you see that Jesus sending out his disciples right here I'm sorry no he's actually correcting his disciples because they were trying to say well all the preachers have to follow our our little assembly right and Jesus says whosoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name shall not lose his reward praise God so when you're standing for Christ serving Christ and even something as small as a cup of water in the name of Jesus if they give it to you you'll get a reward it also works the other way right if we're not the one laboring and we see someone laboring for Christ and we get them a cup of water you get a reward as well right works both sides if you're the one who needs water or you see someone who needs water and you give it in the Name of Christ you get a reward praise God something as small as a drink of water right J is Jesus watching all of our motives and our objectives yes is he watching all of our actions yes we should have people that we should be people of pity people of Mercy people of compassion people of love for all those who call upon the name of Jesus Christ and also our enemies like Jesus said love your enemies and do good to them who persecute you amen hallelujah now let's go to Matthew 10:41 this one applies to us because we received the prophet in our day Matthew 1041 now let's read uh LD can you read 40 and 41 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that s me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall be shall receive a prophets are Lord and He that receiveth a righteous man the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous Name Lord amen praise God so Jesus says if you receive my preachers it's like you receiving me praise the Lord and then he says also if you receive a prophet you get a prophet's reward and they asked brother BR what's a prophet's reward and brother Bram said a prophet's reward is being a friend to the prophet and he said uh he said like the shulamite woman in uh First Kings chapter 17 he said it might come in handy sometime Hallelujah so in other words if you uh receive a prophet it will bless you in some way now here here's how it's blessed us when we read or when we hear stories of brother brandom and we apply those same truths to our lives they could be a blessing to us for example like the story of hady Wright we brother said she said the right thing praise God if we can take that uh story and apply to our lives and we can say the right thing praise the Lord at the right time God can bless us as well amen right that's the reward of being of knowing a prophet of receiving a prophet you get blessed by The Prophet's Ministry praise the Lord amen I talk to people too where they say they listen to a tape and let's say in a prayer line and somebody has the same sickness they've had and at that moment it's like God speaking to them and because they believed a prophet accepted a prophet they get a blessing of a prophet they get healed by listening to a tape that happened 40 or 50 years ago that's the rewards of receiving a prophet amen hallelujah that's exactly right so we see that you get a reward for receiving brother bandham as a prophet hallelujah thank God for that now we already went this you get a reward if you pray in secret you get a reward if you give alms in secret uh you get a re if you leave your family members and possessions for the sake of the Lord uh if you endure Temptation and fight the goodby of Faith you get a reward here's a good one too let's go to Luke 14:12 Luke 14:12 think about this one Luke 14:12 here's a really good one to think about poor people remember even giving them natural things get you reward it's so important to meet the natural needs of people especially poor people think about people in the church that maybe don't have a lot of money let's do good to them praise God the Bible said you should always be ready to to do good to them that are of the household of faith amen of course be good to all men but especially Paul says of the household of faith be ready to do good to Christians okay B guy can you read 12 13 and 14 then he then said he also to him that b him when thou make us a dinner or a supper come not thy friends nor thy Brethren neither thy kidsmen nor thy Rich neighbors lest they also be thee again and a recompense me May thee but when thou makest a feast call the poor the mean the lame the Blind and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee th sh be recompensed at the resurrection of the just amen praise God a't that wonderful look at the promise of God when you have a feast when you're H gonna celebrate invite people that can't pay you back amen it's okay to invite people you know but Jesus saying make sure you do good to the poor have a dinner invite people that can never pay you back and then you have a reward in heaven praise God hallelujah that's beautiful amen so if you know any poor any M any H any blind you'll be blessed if you Minister those who can't pay you back praise God Amen what a wonderful scripture here's one we read last week let's go to James chapter 1 with Austin and I were're reading on this one James chapter 1 uh 2627 ausome can you read are you getting there bu okay um James 1 12627 I'll read it it's in the back uh by right before Hebrews I'm sorry after Hebrews Hebrews James If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is in vain so any any when people just cuss and don't care or they just badmouth people and backbite people and gossip their religion is not even a reality yet it's not even real they don't even understand that they don't have any they have evil treasure in their hearts because the treasure in your heart comes out of your mouth right so we must not swear we must not uh persecute we must not uh slander people verse 27 pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless think about people that don't have fathers think about the single parent mothers or fathers that you know and widows in their Affliction so when you see people that are afflicted and to keep himself unspotted from the world this is pure religion when you see someone who's hurting when you see someone struggling go visit them or maybe call them on the phone pray for them right do something good for those that are afflicted that's pure religion before God and also keeping your mouth from Evil Hallelujah and there's obviously rewards for those but I want to make sure I read that this is pure religion that we must have that's why I love James James is so straightforward we talking about that it's so easy to tell what James is trying to say he don't speak in riddles you don't speak in symbols he this is how you live this is how you have faith this is how you keep your mouth right this is all all these things he just lays it right out like that James the brother of Our Lord amen okay let's go back to Luke 6 Luke 6 here's another reward by God's grace this one kind of ties in with the the one about making a supper and inviting people that can't pay you back Luke 6 all right now I want to get to 33 um let's go to verse uh 30 Luke 6:30 give to every man that askthe and of him that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again wow so someone takes away takes away your your possessions don't ask for them back that's what Jesus said that takes real holy ghost power verse 31 and as you would that men should do to you do you also to them likewise there's the Golden Rule right there in Scripture vers 32 for if you love them which love you what thank have you for Sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for Sinners also do even the same so in other words it's easy to love people that love you let's love people that are hard to love then we get the real Victory right there amen verse 34 now here's where we're getting to money now if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thank have ye so when you lend money we shouldn't hope to get it back right for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again so when you give somebody money don't hope for it back just pray for that God to bless them and your reward shall be what great Hallelujah when you do good to your enemies and you lend money or lend whatever and you don't hold for it back Jesus said I'll reward you with a great reward and ye shall be the children of the highest for he's kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful so when you can lend and be uh lend and not want money back when you can be good to people that are enemies to you now you're being like God because God gives Reign to Sinners God gives life to Sinners and they don't even thank him praise God now you're starting to be like God when you can love the unlovable when you can give and hope for nothing back in return that's a real Christian right there amen great is your reward not small is your reward great is your reward Hallelujah those are red letter words Promises of Our Lord now let's keep going here there's a few more scriptures where we get rewards uh 1 Corinthians 9 let's go there 1 Corinthians 9 we want to get to 17 but I might might start a little bit above that 1 Corinthians 9:17 let's start at verse 16 yes 1 Corinthians 9:16 Mali can you read that 16 and 17 are you there though I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glorious for necessity is laid upon me y Woe Is unto me if I preach not the gospel for if I do this thing willingly I have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the Gospel is to is committed unto me praise God so Paul notices what it I have woes or uh he says I have woe woe unto me if I preach not the gospel so I'll have troubles if I don't preach the gospel he said if I do this willingly I have a reward so we've got to willingly serve the Lord we got to give him our will and we've got to want to do what Christ wants us to do then we're rewarded praise God so serving God willingly get your reward well I want to do what's right I want to help those who are poor I want to do good to those uh who who don't do good to me I want to uh give to people who won't give me back because they they just don't have it we have to want to serve God we have to willingly give God our service now let's go to Colossians 3 this is a pretty interesting one because it deals with slavery Colossians 3:23 Colossians 3:23 now of course we don't Advocate slavery or anything like that but St Paul realized people would be in that situation and he told them to keep serving all right now this is not the one but we're going to read anyway okay so Colossians 3:23 brother Austin are you there okay can you read 23 24 and 25 and whatsoever you do do it partly as to the Lord and unto and not unto men knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of inheritance for you for you serve the Lord Christ but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons amen praise God did you catch that verse 24 knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ okay now here's what I I missed the scripture it's verse 22 brother I'm gonna read go back and read verse 22 Paul speaking to servants or these are slaves in in this area of the colossian church servants obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh so if you're a slave he says obey your your master with all your heart right not with eye Service as men Pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God knowing that of the Lord in verse 24 you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ what a powerful scripture M we're not slaves are we none of us are slaves as far as we know but but Paul says however you serve your master that's how you serve Christ amen so however I work at my job that's how I serve Christ right however you work at your job that's how you serve Christ and if you serve and if you work like you're serving Christ you have a great reward in heaven amen so we've gone over rewards you get a reward if you endure Temptation you get a reward if you give a cup in the name of Jesus you get a reward if you receive a prophet amen you get a reward if you pray in secret if you give alms in secret if you fast in secret if you leave your family members and possessions like lands you get a reward if if you fight the good fight of Faith you get a reward if you make a dinner and those people cannot repay you you get a reward if you love your enemies and hope and also if you lend money and hope you don't get it back you get a reward amen if you serve God willingly you get a reward if you heartily serve your Masters your Earthly Masters uh as Christ you get a reward amen and lastly oh we read this one already but lastly uh you must believe you will get a reward in Hebrews 11:6 we read that on Sunday You Must Believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek God okay so we first saw that you have to get the treasure in you you got to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you and then after you get the treasure in you then you can lay up Treasures in Heaven praise God Amen and then you can get rewards now here's the warning that we got to watch so let's go to the end of the New Testament 2 john8 2 John 18 because people can lose rewards as well if they leave the Faith they lose rewards this is all scriptural the Bible said you can even lose a crown right um 2 john8 okay now he's talking about deceivers in verse 7 for many deceivers are entered in the world who confess not that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh this is deceiver and the Antichrist look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward praise God so whatever you work for for Christ upon this Earth he said labor that you don't lose your reward praise God now that might look like this uh some examples I can think of like if you win a soul praise God and bring somebody to Christ you have to work and labor and make sure you always point that person to Christ amen praise God pray them through if they need help if they need natural things you help them out with natural things you don't want to lose your reward you don't want to get upset with somebody and reject them or something like that you want to keep your reward amen uh if you start like for ex our example if we start a church we can't give up if it gets hard we got to keep working for Jesus because we don't want to lose any rewards we must work until he comes amen those are just a few examples amen but look the Bible said we want a full reward we want to earn the best reward we possibly can and that's by working for Jesus and now giving up now 1 Corinthians 3 says the same thing let's go there 1 Corinthians 3 1 Corinthians 3 doing good on time praise God verse 14 and 15 1 Corinthians 3 now like to read the 14 and 15 L you got that you ready thank you if any man's work abide which he has built thereup he shall receive a reward any man's work be burned shall be burned he shall suffer L he himself shall be saved yet so as as amen praise God so we see that if any man's work abide which Heath built thereon he shall receive a reward so whatever work God's called you to do stay in that work make sure it's of God and God will reward you what if man's work shall be burned so if if the trial of God takes away the work or takes away their uh Ministry whatever like that because they weren't they really didn't have a heart for it they can still be saved but they lose their reward if God's called you to do a Ministry stay in that Ministry stay in the word of God hallelujah amen now that's right because look at verse 13 for every man's work shall be made manifest it's going to be made clear to all of us what we did on this Earth was it the work of God or was it the work of ourselves praise God Amen for the day shall declare see the day will declare when we go uh for the day of the Judgment because it shall be revealed by Fire and Fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is remember our God is consuming fire God will try all of our works whether they're of him or not amen amen hallelujah now look um I want to show you how winning Souls is such an important thing the Bible says he that wins Souls is wise how many knows that in Proverbs he that wins Souls is wise that's why we pray to win our children to Christ that's why we pray for people to come into the message the word of God and their souls be saved praise God I want to show you this right out of the scripture so let's go to uh uh Philippians 4:1 I want you to see this in Scripture when brother BR talks about people being uh the jewels in his crown that get saved in his Services that's exactly scriptural praise God so preachers or anyone that prays even women that pray for the services where people be saved brother bam said when you pray for a soul to be saved and they get saved or you send money for a missionary trip and the Soul gets saved that's a jewel in your crown amen amen hallelujah that's exactly right but look at this uh Philippians 4:1 we don't want to lose crowns by not doing what we should do serving others helping others pulling people the Bible said pulling them out of the fire we'll read that one next pulling them out of the fire just so they don't get lost so they're saved amen amen Philippians 4:1 I'm too busy talking to turn my Bible there okay all right Philippians 4:1 I'm gonna read this one therefore my brethren dearly beloved and long for my joy and what Crown so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly beloved amen amen Paul starts churches all over Europe right one of them is the Philippian church and he says all you Saints there you're my joy and you're my crown amen hallelujah hallelujah like when when our ministry one brother amen or brother van to the message that's our joy and that's our Crown amen glory that's exactly right Hallelujah because that's why the ministry is here to win souls to Christ amen and that becomes the crown of our Our Lives amen as we work together and pray and intercede for souls to be saved that becomes our Crown amen and it's scriptural go to first Thessalonians 2 completely scriptural 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 so right after that one in your Bible 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 let me say like this brother Benjamin and our brother Austin here if they're saved under our ministry which could be very possible wherever they got saved you know where God knows it's a crown they're the crown to this ministry praise God hallelujah or if I got Sav I got saved under brother Brooks Ministry I'm a crown to that ministry right I'm a jewel in that Crown amen but then I can earn my own Crown right we can earn our own crowns amen that's exactly right because we'll look at that later okay now uh first Thessalonians 2 yeah verse uh let's look at verse 18 19 20 okay I'll read this one wherefore we would have come unto you even I once again but Satan hindered us you ever try to do that you ever try to get somewhere and Satan hinders you from getting there Paul said I would have loved to come back to the church but Satan hindered me all right verse 19 for what is our hope our joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus that is coming so remember when Jesus comes back who comes comes to meet him in the air first the dead in Christ right and then we your alive go to meet them in the air but Paul said who's my crown when we meet Jesus in the air he said you are all my crown amen hallelujah so we're gonna meet God in the air now brother B says we'll actually go to the wedding supper have communion first and then rewards will be given out it's it's called the Judgment seat of Christ rewards will be given out after the marriage supper of the lamb and that's where uh the messenger of each age will present all those converts of his ministry amen hallelujah so Paul is going to present these Believers as a Chase virgin to Christ and this is his crown this is his reward am amen he have a crown and he'll have all the churches that he started there a part of his crown Hallelujah who's my crown you're my crown who's my joy you're my joy Paul says amen any Souls that we can win they'll be our Crown now Church remember this remember the parable of the workers in the vineyard the 11th Hour workers even though they didn't work as long or as hard as the other ones they got the same reward amen hallelujah hallelujah so as long as we give all we can to Christ we know it's a dark hour we know this is not the age of the open door that was Philadelphia so we can't expect big huge revivals with bigger numbers like that that's not the age of that we're living in that was Philadelphia but if we win souls the Bible say we get the same reward amen we just got to do something for the kingdom of God win what we can do what we can try to spend our our time uh storing up Treasures in Heaven hallelujah amen glory let me read that quote again brother BR says all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God or trying to do things upon the Earth store up things upon the Earth Jesus said store up Treasures in Heaven and that's always by serving other people brother said the reward of God is too lightly Este steem people aren't really thinking about rewards from God too much if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and eternal Kingdom substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints Hallelujah now that quot hopefully means more to you now by God's grace amen now let's go to uh Revelation 210 Revelation 210 another thing on crowns Revelation 210 how you got this one buddy Revelation 2:10 fear not of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crowd of life amen praise God now notice brother B pulls this out of the church age book and he's writing about this he said notice it says be faithful unto death he said Not until death but be fa faithful in other words be faithful to give your life for Christ right amen be faithful unto death so whatever death you're called to give right be faithful to God unto death whatever death whether and brother said there's two kinds of death there's a martyr's death right and then there's one brother said that that's called a given life you give your life as a martyr brother said you get a crown for being given and then he said the other kind is you get a crown for striven stri those who strive daily and their lives daily to Christ Amen brother said there's two kinds of giving of of your life either given as a martyr or you strive striven you strive every day and S and sacrifice your own desires you crucify the affection and lust lust of the flesh thereof that you might gain eternal life amen but you must see we must be faithful unto the death God's called us to some people are called to be martyrs but some people a lot of us here in America we're called here to Faithfully serve and hold the banner of Christ unto death amen glory if not the Bible said we can lose our crown and Revelation 3:11 let's go to Revelation 311 Jesus says this it's not a words of a man but if we won't step up and do what God's called us to do somebody else will amen that's that's exactly right I've noticed that I'll tell after I read this I'll just tell a quick testimony uh Revelation 3:11 brother Austin you got that I'm sorry yeah 311 yeah 311 got that behold I come quickly hold that hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown amen so whatever you've got from God hold on to it that no man take your crown let me give you an example here a few years ago quite a few years ago now um there's a church uh that invited a certain brother to preach and the brother turned it down because he wanted to watch his son go play high school football he turned down these special meetings well the pastor felt led since he turned it down he felt led to call me so I went to the meetings and God moved in a great way a lot of repentance there a lot of souls that were uh hearing from God at the altar and receiving God's grace and mercy and things like that and now church just a year later that preacher that turned that work down left the message a preacher and he got all tattooed up and he drinks and he Po and I'm his friend on Facebook and he dances to a worldly music and gets drunk and cusses all the time now I'm not saying I got a reward but look here's a man who was called to a work turned it down later leaves the message right which is leaving the word of the hour right the truth of the hour and we wonder if he loses a crown or not I'd imagine it might be that way because he turns down the work of God and but if if God's called somebody to do it God will find somebody else to fill in his place if he don't want to do it praise God so think about the burden on your heart if you don't do something for God that God's put on the burden for you you might lose out on your crown amen amen that's why it's good if you got a burd on your heart you really believe it's God make sure you do it praise God put everything else aside to do what God's called you to do praise God or else somebody will take your crown someone will take that Victory you were supposed to get you were supposed to do that God called you to do it first but you got caught up in things and didn't do it right God help us by the gra to the Lord so can everybody see that you have to the treasure in you the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God then you'll sore up Treasures in Heaven which will earn Eternal rewards and will'll gain crowns we have jewels in our crowns praise God now let's I want to close with this because I've been about almost an hour I want to go about 15 more minutes I want to close with brother Ram story about uh beyond the curtain of time praise God it's been a while since I preached on so I want to preach on that a long time it's actually been six years since I preached on this so I went back in my notes and looked at it by the grace of the Lord okay so let's look at this here so I'm going to be reading a little bit just try to stay with me here by God's grace now how many know brother B was preaching this and he told this story in the fif seal he was talking about how their uh the Jews who are the souls under the altar he had he said they're going to get right right white Rob Jesus said they'll get white robes uh of of life and brother man said this he said he said let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let me see my people not long ago in white robes he said you remember it and as actually in 1960 in May of 1960 brother brandom had the vision of going beyond the curtain of time so God let brother brandom go up into the sixth Dimension praise God there's seven dimensions God let brother brandom go into the sixth dimension and let's read that by God's grace now I told it many times uh so there's a lot of great scriptures to go over it okay so brother bam said the other morning I was laying in bed I just woke up and I began to wonder what it will be like on the other side in heaven I realized I live more than half of my life and I wanted to do more for the Lord before I left this life anybody want to do more for the Lord tonight I should do I don't want to lose my crown right uhhuh brother ra said I Heard a Voice saying you're just starting now this is in 1960 glory and God said you're just starting he died in 65 so look you can have five years left and be just starting and you can do so much for God in a short amount of time amen hallelujah he said you're just starting and he had five years left to live hallelujah amen now remember the previously he was a worldwide traveler but remember in 1962 God shut his traveling down and he stayed to sore up all the those tapes so God saw that as a greater work because it was the third pole amen it was the opening of the word revealing of the Mysteries of the powers of God to restore it back to the people God said that was a great thing he said you're just getting started to the opening of that uh that third poll by God's grace he said press the battle keep pressing again the voice said keep press the battle keep going keep going he said but I thought I possibly spoke words to myself the boy spoke again a third time just keep pressing if you only knew what is at the end of the road so when you die and cross over if you only knew what it's like to die and cross over then the voice asked me would you like to see just beyond the curtain and I answered it would help me so much my Hallelujah Church whenever we need a good encouragement we should come back to this Vision amen amen it will help us so much to know what it's going to be like over there amen hallelujah he says now what happened I cannot say whether I was in the body or is a translation I do not know but it's unlike any Vision I ever had I could see the place to which I was taken I could see myself laying back there upon the bed I said that's a strange thing so I want you to see this he's laying in the bed brother like this and his wife's sleeping and he said oh if I could just uh see past the curtain of time that would help me so much and brother BR let me say like this brother bram's theophany Rises right must have came down and must have caught his soul it comes down and pulls him and he can look down he's he's a spirit being now theophany he can look back down and see his body praise God Amen other prophets did that like Ezekiel Ezekiel the Bible said that God picked up Ezekiel and carried him to certain places while he rest his body stayed there and God would carry Ezekiel and take him other places Hallelujah Glory he said I saw a strange thing there were great numbers of people and they came running to me crying oh oh our precious brother first came young women apparently in their early 20s and they would embrace me they would say our precious brother so he goes to this land where there's a beautiful Hills and streams I'm sorry flowers all these things so he goes up to the sixth Dimension brother BR said it was under the altar of God so if you read Revelation there is an altar of God so somewhere underneath that altar that must be the seventh Dimension so maybe under that in the sixth Dimension somehow that's where all that's where the paradise is now that's what the Bible calls it now Paradise because Paul said I was CAU up into the third heaven which must have been Paradise praise God Amen Hallelujah I can't explain it but I believe it the Bible says it amen amen he says young men of manhood eyes glistening like stars teeth as white as pearls embrac me saying our precious brother then I noticed that I too have become young again I looked at myself there and turn and look back at my old body lying on the bed with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this look how close that Dimension is oh my Hallelujah that Dimension is so close to us hallelujah remember we read that in Acts 1 though he be not far from each one of us amen praise God he's not far from us that Dimension is not far it's actually very close he can look down and see his body and say there's the third there's the fourth dimension or there's the third dimension I'm up here in the sixth Dimension I can look down to the third dimension amen as I begin to comprehend the place where I was I realize there's no yesterday and no tomorrow no one seem to get tired amen as a multitude the most beautiful young women I've ever seen through their arms around me I discovered there was only a great love that overwhelmed me and no physical attraction in human behavior so he wasn't in this physical body when those women that were saved and all those men when they hugged him he didn't feel any sexual attraction because he was in a brand new body amen a theophany body the Bible calls a Celestial body an eternal body that's in the heavens amen amen that's right Second Corinthians chapter 5 it says that and I noticed these young women all wore their hair down to their waistlines okay so in heaven brother Austin the hair of the women goes from here all the way down to their waist God loves long hair amen God loves long hair glory and their skirts went down to their feet brother brandom said and in Revelation chapter one Jesus wears a garment that goes down to his feet that's why we wear long pants down to our feet praise God for brothers sisters that's why you wear long s because in heaven we're going to wear long garments we won't be showing off our our big strong legs and our big strong muscles will we no uhuh no sir because God don't glorify In the Flesh does he amen only glor he gets all the glory all glory goes to him amen after this hope his first wife his first wife died in 1933 I think it was she comes up and hugs and says my precious brother then another young woman hugged me and hope turned and me the young woman and I said I don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love I don't want to go back to that old body on the bed then a voice spoke to me and said this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing cannot nothing cannot enter here without it amen amen glory so what is divine love divine love is no sexual feelings amen it's just love for God's creation and no sexual no selfish anything that's Divine love and brother R says in the name of the Lord in other words thus sayth the Lord the only kind of love that will make it to this Dimension is perfect love amen amen glor thus say the Lord amen hallelujah next I was taken up and seated on a high place so after everybody hugs him and greets him now as a prophet he's taken up to a higher place above everybody and all around me were great numbers of men and women in the bloom of Youth they were crying with joy oh our precious brother we're so happy to see you here and I thought I I'm not dreaming for I can see these people and I can see my body laying back down there in bed oh my look how close that Dimension is he can he's all exalted up here as a preacher and look still look down and see his body on the bed there the Bible said we're surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses Hallelujah let us lay aside every sin that does but easily set us and run the race perseverance amen amen we've got an innumerable cloud of witnesses innumerable number of angels Hallelujah we must live like we're surrounded by Holiness amen because they're watching us they're right here they're around us it's close to us it's a close Dimension amen said I don't understand this The Voice spoke to me and said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered to their people brother said yes I remember that in the scripture he says but are all these randoms do you remember the Old Testament when one of the Patriarchs would die where would they bury them they would bury them with their people that that died before praise God like with Sarah and Abraham Abraham bought a cave for Sarah's body and later he was gathered there right remember David and Solomon all their sons and so forth they were gathered and buried with their people right they're always gathered with their people and God The Voice told Brother brandom here in this dimension in the sixth Dimension you're gathered with your people and so it was all the people that were saved by a certain Prophet or Ministry or messenger of the day you're gathered with your people it's a family coming back together and it's a more precious it's not a physical blood it's a spiritual blood it's a spiritual family amen I won't be gathered with all the Smiths I'll be gathered with all the Christians amen of Leia Hallelujah is that right amen he says the voice replies that these are not randoms these these are your converts the ones that you've led to the Lord so see understand this in this Vision only converts are led to the Lord are in this place and what's the convert Jesus said in Luke 22:32 I looking up a board service Jesus told Peter when this is before the crucifixion when you get converted strengthen your brethren so a person is not converted which means changed until they're born again the Holy Ghost is that right so the sixth Dimension is only for people who are converts who are born again in the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you with Meen hallelujah amen some of these women you think were so young and beautiful here were more than nine years years old when you led them to the Lord so the people that are there are ones that were led to Christ amen hallelujah not just come to church right not for us but actually be led to Christ and love Christ and know Christ and serve Christ brother R said no the voice said no wonder they're crying out my precious brother then the multitude cried together so all these millions of people cried out together if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here hallelujah so what was brother Ram's work his work was to track leave his family and travel and preach the gospel praise God if he had not done that he would have lost his crme praise God so brother ask oh where is Jesus I want to see him the people replied he's just a little higher that must be the seventh Dimension right because the Bible said he ever liveth to make intercession right for us so he is sitting on the altar of God as a mediator as a type of the Arc of the Covenant as a type of of The Mercy Seat praise God because his blood has to lay upon the Heavenly Mercy Seat seat in order to cover our sins and intercede for us praise God just like the blood had to lay on The Mercy Seat Above the Law because we couldn't keep the law the law would condemn us but when blood was placed upon The Mercy Seat then the law could be satisfied amen hallelujah then the law wouldn't condemn us because a sacrifice had been condemned for us hallelujah oh glory amen so there in the sixth Dimension Christ was a step higher a little higher in the seventh dimension the people said he's just a little higher someday he will come to you you were sent as a leader and when God comes he will judge you according to your teaching Hallelujah I'm glad when I teach you Brothers the word it's all the Bible amen because I'll be judged by the word that I preach praise God we read that today remember also remember you read that the Bible said be not many Masters for we we receive the greater condemnation it's James 3 verse one read that this morning when we did Bible we did our chapter together this morning with our precious Brothers there I will be judged by what I preached if I preach the word I get a reward if I preach my own thoughts I lose could lose my I could lose eternal life I could lose my my reward but he says you'll be judged according to your teaching brother man ask does Paul and Peter have to stand this judgment also and the answer was yes so every preacher right Peter was not not the messenger of the hour was he no but he still have to be judged for his preaching oh my I'm not the messenger of the hour but I still have to be judged for my preaching amen and everybody else to be judged for your ministry too your Works what did you do for the kingdom of God man said all too little time is spent trying to lay up Treasures in Heaven how do you lay up Treasures in Heaven serve other people do good to them that are evil to you love others right help them serve other people and then you got eternal life amen they said brother R said well I have preached what they preached I did not divert from it to one side of the other where they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too that's what I baptize him brother Austin the name of Jesus Christ right where they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too and that's what I teach to you after you get water baptized you got to get Sanctified and then you got to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't stop after baptism right all these young ones that got baptized lately ldan aaia and Malachi don't stop there you got to get born again you got to get filled with the Holy Ghost is that right don't stop at baptism keep reading your Bible praying come to the church love God worship fast and pray do good to others make sure you're filled with the power of God Almighty by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I'm preaching what Paul preached amen hallelujah brother said whatever they taught Peter and Paul I taught also he says the people cried out together we know that and we know that we are going back to Earth with you sometime Jesus will come and judge you according to the words you preach to us then you will present us to him and altto together we will go back to live on Earth to live forever oh my hallelujah praise God brother the man said do I have to go back to Earth now he said they yes but keep pressing on now he skipped a little bit on uh a few more things I want to make sure I find this here can you bear with me just a moment I forgot I cut this up into different places here okay here it is okay now look here's where people get a little confused here now look what he says here after this he said we're resting on that right the people cry we're resting on the fact that you preach the gospel of Paul and Peter amen he said I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming can you imagine that people coming to meet you in heaven goodness they're still coming after all this conversation with the boys and all these people hugging him they're still coming to see him ah wanting to hug me screaming our precious brother our precious brother just then a voice said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given you here this is where I might be a little bit of disagreement but if you want disagree with me that's fine I don't believe this is referring to just people that he loved because you had to be a convert to get there praise God you had to be loved or you had to uh be led to serve God in order to get there right you have to be led to the Lord he had to lead you to Christ you had to be a convert to get there because look he says all that you ever love all I ever Lov you God has given to you and I looked and here come my old what dog right so if you just take the story when he says all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you what happens directly after that a dog comes up and licks his hand Fritz right Fritz he said and I looked hear my old dog come up walking up Fricks and here come my horse Prince a horse and a dog come up after he says everything you love I've given to you here come my horse and laid his head over my shoulder and nicker so Lydia if you love those horses guess what if you love Christ God will give you everything you love that's what I believe that if you take into context that's what he gave I remember remember when brother Bram remember when that uh that uh man in town ran over Fritz you remember that a man ran over his dog on purpose the brother said I was going to kill him but then he got saved and preached and then he eventually saved that man and baptized him but when brother randam buried Fritz he was digging the hole he buried him he said if there is a heaven Fritz he said you'll be there Glory because that dog helped him get uh animals and they sold those hides to get money to feed his family he said if there is a heaven you will be there and then when he gets to go to heaven Beyond the curtain of time he's there praise God Amen Hallelujah there's animals in heaven Hallelujah exactly right he said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hands through your ministry he says praise God and then he said I felt myself move from that beautiful place he oh I want to leave here and I looked around and I said are you awake honey she was still asleeping I thought oh god oh help me never let me compromise with one word let me stay straight on that word and preach it I don't care what comes or goes I don't care how many saws or sons of kisher eyes let me press to that place can I have five more minutes is that okay can I five more minutes okay now here brother ad says just remember this I'll say with the faith that I have in that Vision beyond the curtain of time I'll speak it in the name of the Lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it amen oh my let just be with me just a moment must be yeah must be one okay now this he also tells us in the time of the seals here as well by the grace of the Lord most you might remember this now he makes sure he tells it that it was just a dream that wasn't a vision he calls it a dream praise God okay so now he has a dream about crowns being given out this is in the six seal so in the fifth seal he talked about going beyond the curtain of time where they say we're resting on that all these things now the next night under the Sixth Seal when he preached about the six seal of tribulation he told a dream about when Christ were being given out this would have to be right after the marriage supper of the Lamb or something but listen to him tell the story I want to tell you a little thing that happened this was a dream I was asleep I never told this publicly before I told it to a couple people but never publicly as I know of and I dreamed about a month after that that I was standing one day and I was watching that great time not the Judgment now I don't believe the church ever comes to the Judgment I mean the bride goes to a judgment but I was there when crowns was being given out okay now turn to First Corinthians if you can real quick I want to show you there's a scripture where it says we all must stand before the Judgment seat of Christ anybody every everybody know that there is a judgment seat that we all must stand for if you're the bride I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 5:10 sorry 2 Corinthians 5:10 if you're the bride you stand before the Judgment seat of Christ sometime on the marriage supp of the Lamb during the tribulation while the Earth is going through that we're not in that we're up in uh the marriage supp of the Lamb we get crowns up there right that's exactly right but at the white Throne judgment after the thousand years that's where everybody else stands before Christ and that's not a merciful god that's a a angry god brother brandom says Jesus is an Angry God judging people at the white Throne judgment we don't go through that we sit on the throne with Christ during that time but the Judgment seat of Christ is where we're given crowns and rewards amen that's second Corinthians 5:10 okay Malachi got that second Corinthians 510 all Jud Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he ha done whether it be good or bad amen we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ to receive reward praise God now let me continue this story brother said I had a dream and crowns were being given out he said this wasn't the white Throne judgment this was the Judgment seat of Christ for rewards that's during that's after the marriage supper of the Lamb he gives rewards now and brother B said I saw that great big Throne set up there and Jesus I'm sorry the recording Angel was there in Jesus and all standing around there and there was a stair steps like coming down this way of white ey the white Ivory throat run down in a circle and made a panoramic like this and went out so that all this great host standing out there could see what was happening so just one Circle it's like a big circle of white Ivory and everybody can see what's happening everybody can see everybody else and I was standing back way back on one side and I was standing there never had an idea that I would walk them steps I was standing there and I'd see a recording Angel would call name and I'd see a recording Angel and I recognized a name he says I look back way back out there here come the brother walking or sister walk up like that the recording Angel standing there by the side of Christ Just a Dream now and watching and their names was on there it was found in the book of life he look out over them and say it was well done my good and faithful servant now enter in so you got the picture there's all this huge multitude and brother M heard people's names called by the recording angel and they walk up before Christ and he says well done my good and faithful servant enter the joys of the Lord and they're given crowns and they get to enter in heaven or maybe this is the marriage supper I'm not sure but sometime at that time I look back where they was going there was a new world and the joys and he said enter in the joys of the Lord that's been yours since the foundation of the world see he says and I thought oh they go through there and meet one another and just rejoicing going over mountains and great big places I thought oh isn't that wonderful Glory Hallelujah just jumping up and down so he's jumping up and down watching all these people get their rewards and crowns and walk into that Heavenly Place amen then I'd hear another name called I say oh I know him watch him go right up enter in the joys of the Lord my good and faithful said oh praise God praise God and just like they would say Orman Neville see and I'd say that old brother Neville there he is and here he come out of the Crowd Goes Up I hear him say enter in the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world enter in he said and old brother Neville just change and just start back in there just screaming and hollering after God's rewarded scream and holler and then he would enter into the joys of the Lord oh my said boy I just shout and just say say glory to God standing over here by myself having a wonderful time watching all my brethren go in Hallelujah church amen and then a recording Angel stood up and said William Brandon imagine when it's gonna say your name amen my name Hallelujah and I never thought I'd have to walk up there he said and so then I was scared I thought oh my will I have to do that so I went walking down there and just everybody patted me on the back saying hi brother brand God bless you brother B patting me as I go through the crowd can you imagine chur Hallelujah you ever R into award ceremony or seen on TV and somebody gets their name called they win their War everybody's clapping and everything like that this is beyond that Glory this is they call your name and you might come up and everybody's patting everybody's hugging you say oh God bless you brother B God bless you and here you come up before all the people and you come up before Christ your savior and all them reaching over and patting me like that God bless you brother God bless you brother and I thought oh my they go through and meet one another and just rejoicing going over mountains and all these things I'm sorry I read the wrong one and I was going up and I said Thank you thank you thank you like coming out of a meeting or something you know and I was going to have to walk those great big Ivory steps so he say thank you thank you thank you God bless you thank you thank you they're all thanking him as he walks up before Jesus hallelujah amen hallelujah and I started walking up there and I just made the first step and I stopped and I I thought and I looked at his face and I thought I just want to get a good look at him this way so he finally gets up to the front by the steps and he says I want to look at Jesus and see what he looks like and I stopped and my hands like this I felt something slip in my arms he got his arms like this he felt something slip in his arm and I looked around and there was hope those big black eyes oh my and that dark hair hanging down her back white robe on looking up at me like that hallelu amen and I said ho I felt something hit this arm I around and there was ma that was dark brown eyes looking up and that black hair hanging down a white robe on and I said Ma and they looked at one another like that and I got them in my arms and here we went on home Oh my he says and after that I woke up how me like that by God's grace you know the Bible says that the wife and husband are heirs together of the grace of Life in 1 Peter 4:7 and8 in other words heirs are possessors or inheritors right so here brother Ram goes up to get his reward inheritance and who's right there with him the women that brought forth his children upon the Earth and they are HS together of life he said I woke up oh and I got up and sat down in a chair and cried I thought oh God I hope that comes like that both of them associated with me in life and bringing children and things like that and here we are walking into the new world oh my where Perfection everything why it's going to be wonderful there don't miss it don't miss it by the grace of God do all you can do then it'll be up to God to take care of the rest of it let's stand to our feet Hallelujah isn't that such a beautiful story Church oh my goodness Hallelujah what is this about rewards crowns and Treasures in Heaven I showed you all the script I went through all the scriptures on Treasure in the New Testament and rewards and crowns I went through all the scriptures on that this is how if you do these things that Jesus said you will be able to go to the Judgment seat of Christ and he'll say Well done thou good and faithful servant and you won't lose your crown you'll have a crown of righteousness praise God so what is that it's loving your enemies it's going through persecutions keeping your faith and not pushing it away praise God Amen it's giving to others and hope they don't pay you back right it's being a real Holy Ghost filled Christian praise God Amen and then he'll say Well done th good and faithful servant enter in the joys of the Lord prepare for you from the foundation of the world praise God let's bow our heads here amen church tonight just think in your heart here I'm not going to have you raise your hand but think about our are you entered into the work that you're supposed to be doing we will all be judged the Bible said according to our works have we entered into the works if we haven't it's okay if God hasn't revealed it to us but if God has showed us what we're supposed to do we must do it by his grace and mercy we will be rewarded we will be given crowns and we don't do it for those things we do it because we love Jesus but because we love him because we serve him he'll reward us for what we do so think about in your heart right now am I doing what God's called me to do praise God brother said by the grace of God do all you can do
