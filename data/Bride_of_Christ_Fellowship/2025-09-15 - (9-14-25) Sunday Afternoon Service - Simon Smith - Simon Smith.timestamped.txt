[0:00] getting close to the rapture. We're
[0:01] getting close to the persecution. We're
[0:03] getting close to everything that was
[0:04] prophesied. I know it's been 60 years,
[0:06] but saints of God, one day it's going to
[0:08] strike.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; One day when I'll say this, as soon as
[0:12] this economy goes down, it's been on. In
[0:16] other words, there's it's too late at
[0:17] that time. We have to be ready now,
[0:19] right? So, we want to be full of the
[0:21] Holy Spirit, getting refillings after
[0:23] refillings, seeking the Lord the best we
[0:25] can.
[0:26] Uh he's been he's we we have seen he is
[0:30] worthy. We've judged him worthy. He's
[0:32] faithful. He's true. He's kind.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; He's a long-suffering God. He's uh
[0:36] marvelous. He's always been with us.
[0:37] He's not never once forsaken us ever in
[0:40] our tough times and these uh tough
[0:43] spaces. And uh even in all our
[0:45] shortcomings, he looks past it. He sees
[0:47] the blood. He looks at our intentions.
[0:49] He looks at our thoughts and intents.
[0:51] And uh uh we're just trying to say,
[0:53] Lord,
[0:56] my my saying, you know, my my my my my
[0:58] mind towards the Lord has always been,
[0:59] Lord, as soon as I get out of this body,
[1:03] it's going to you won't have any more
[1:05] problems here with this flesh.
[1:07] But he's like, hey, you got to lay that
[1:09] thing down, you got to die daily. Amen.
[1:12] Praise the Lord. So, we're doing our
[1:13] best uh uh by God's grace. So um
[1:17] now in this uh study uh pastor Jesse
[1:20] asked me to to teach on this um
[1:25] uh so we're going to move in this I am
[1:27] definitely not going to be able to
[1:28] capture all this obviously and maybe um
[1:31] as I sitting back here more kind of
[1:33] thoughts came. So there's a lot to this.
[1:35] This is like uh after I taught at
[1:37] brother home at home, brother Cam's
[1:38] like, "Bro, brother, this is um an eye
[1:41] openener." And he said, he said, "Man,
[1:43] we could literally spend one service on
[1:45] each uh personages even to the many
[1:49] because everything goes with this when
[1:51] you catch what this is.
[1:53] Uh there's a lot that goes you just I
[1:56] mean it ties into everything else."
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. But this is to me like just as as
[2:03] like we say with we do a Bible study on
[2:05] baptism.
[2:07] We see fathers from the Holy Ghost in
[2:09] Matthew 2019. When we start Acts n Acts
[2:12] 2, Acts 10, Acts uh Acts 8, Acts 19,
[2:16] these are like literally coffins in that
[2:18] false doctrine. Lally nails it shut. Say
[2:20] this is finished work. It's airtight.
[2:22] Right? So the to me this study here
[2:24] helps to put another nail into uh what
[2:28] we've been teaching as far as solidify
[2:30] it. It solidifies it. So um if we could
[2:33] let's just stand for the reading of the
[2:34] word here by God's grace. We want to uh
[2:37] jump into this uh slideshow. Hopefully
[2:39] this will be a blessing here. And um
[2:43] Revelations 1 1-3.
[2:47] Um,
[2:50] now as as we go about this, I want to
[2:53] try to explain where the Lord's taken my
[2:55] mind on this. Maybe you're already
[2:58] there. I don't know. All I'm going to do
[3:00] is I'm trying to express the way he
[3:02] showed this to me. You've already may
[3:04] have already saw this or thought of this
[3:06] or however, but I'm just going to just
[3:08] reiterate uh what it what I'm thinking
[3:10] here, what the Lord's placed. Um, oh, we
[3:14] have a clock right there. Let me see.
[3:16] Revelations 1 1-3.
[3:19] The revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[3:21] God gave unto him to shoe unto his
[3:24] servants things which must shortly come
[3:25] to pass, which he sent, and signified it
[3:28] by his angel unto his servant John, who
[3:31] bear record of the word of God, and the
[3:33] testimony of Jesus Christ, of all the
[3:35] things that he saw. Blessed he that
[3:37] readeth, and they that hear the words of
[3:39] this prophecy. And here, this ties right
[3:40] in here. This is very, very important.
[3:43] and keep those things which are written
[3:45] therein for the time is at hand. Let's
[3:48] say a word of prayer. Let's bow our
[3:50] heads. Dear Lord Jesus, we love you,
[3:53] Lord God. We thank you for all your all
[3:55] that you've shown us, Lord. Help us,
[3:57] Lord, to catch these great and mighty
[3:58] things, Lord, which we know not. Um, and
[4:02] Lord Jesus, Lord, we just want to be
[4:04] faithful, Lord, with this little
[4:05] thought, Lord. But Lord, your prophet
[4:07] taught us 60 years ago, Lord. I'm just
[4:09] now catching up to the revelation of
[4:11] this, seeing this in a fresh new light.
[4:15] As the prophet when he taught the seven
[4:17] seals, he said, Lord, he said, the the
[4:19] books become a new book. I've been
[4:21] opening up again, Lord. And Lord, here
[4:22] we Lord, this becomes new and fresh to
[4:24] me again, Lord, just emphasizing
[4:26] everything you've I believe you showed
[4:28] me for the last many years here. And
[4:31] Lord Jesus, we trust this is a blessing
[4:32] to to to uh uh the bride here in Akran
[4:38] to those that are going to make this
[4:39] rapture alive and well. Lord, we love
[4:41] you. Bless them. Keep them God, Lord.
[4:42] And Lord, we ask a blessing upon it.
[4:44] Help me to get beside myself, Lord, to
[4:46] me. You teach, Lord, through this, Lord,
[4:48] and uh your saints here by God's grace
[4:50] as we know we're approaching uh your
[4:52] wife, Lord, tonight. And Lord, how you
[4:54] showed me, Lord, I would not defile your
[4:56] your wife, Lord. But Lord, just want to
[4:58] give the good things that you've given
[4:59] me, Lord, as we look into the water of
[5:02] the word. Lord, we love you in the name
[5:03] of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[5:05] seated. Um
[5:09] uh so when these things um
[5:12] we want to
[5:15] try to saints of God, I'm I'm I never
[5:18] got my full college degree. I'm actually
[5:20] a college dropout. And uh uh No, I
[5:24] didn't mean
[5:28] a little longer.
[5:30] Yeah.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Amen. So, um like I
[5:34] said, I'm a college dropout and I had to
[5:36] go to the trades because if you can't
[5:37] use your brain, you got to use your
[5:38] hands, right? Use your body. So, that's
[5:40] what we do in the trades. We uh
[5:43] sacrifice their body for the paycheck.
[5:46] Uh so um and of course through there as
[5:48] you get many injuries and um things uh
[5:51] aching and sore and uh you lean on this
[5:55] certain part of the knee it lights right
[5:56] up and you're like
[5:58] so we always using the knee pads now uh
[6:00] elbows and just gloves and now we're
[6:02] just just got to make a couple more
[6:04] years Lord willing if we retire if the
[6:06] Lord carries. Um so in that uh we find
[6:11] ourselves uh here in this uh stage of
[6:15] our life and saints of God. One thing I
[6:17] like about uh I say I love and I feel
[6:20] confident
[6:23] is that with every service we're
[6:24] supposed to take up a notch higher.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Saints of God every time we come to
[6:28] church we should not come uh leave the
[6:31] same way we came in. We should be
[6:33] growing in the knowledge and the grace
[6:36] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And
[6:38] he's going to do that through revelation
[6:40] of his word, right?
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's the way I feel uh
[6:44] is that every service we're coming up
[6:46] higher, great getting greater
[6:48] understanding, greing knowledge, and
[6:49] it's become it's just more pe more
[6:51] pieces being put together, right? And uh
[6:54] and that's what we want to do. So this
[6:56] uh evening I'd like to minister um in my
[7:00] little study. This is actually part two,
[7:02] but we're going to start at part two.
[7:03] Uh, and we want to bring this out, and
[7:06] I'm going to try to uh uh get loose. I'm
[7:09] going to try to just yield to the Lord
[7:10] the best I can, saints of God. Um,
[7:15] uh, I I want to bring this and I I want
[7:17] to show you the importance of this uh
[7:20] study. We've all know we all know these
[7:23] things, but I'm hoping this will give
[7:24] you a different uh perspective. maybe
[7:27] like a uh you know how when we come out
[7:29] of the world and we're in the world
[7:30] we're like this right and then we gave
[7:32] our heart to the Lord and we're like
[7:33] this but when you come to the message it
[7:35] just it really opens up we're getting uh
[7:39] and as the prophet said he said you look
[7:40] at binoculars and sometimes uh when I
[7:42] was denomination I was everything in the
[7:44] the the lenses was screwed up and I was
[7:46] seeing three I could look at uh uh um
[7:50] Sister Zur and I'd look at her the
[7:52] binoculars I see three zers oh my
[7:54] goodness but if I actually focus I find
[7:56] one right so when I was denomination I
[7:58] was seeing trinity but when we come to
[8:00] the truth there's only one person so our
[8:03] eyesight becomes greater we're getting
[8:05] eagle like we're a prophetic class we're
[8:06] a special people anointed to see greater
[8:09] things okay um so in this I'd like to
[8:13] start with a quote I mean I usually
[8:14] don't well we're going to start with a
[8:15] quote here so notice I want to see
[8:17] though now notice how the prophet is he
[8:20] is approaching this is the introduction
[8:23] &gt;&gt; yes
[8:23] &gt;&gt; to the church age book
[8:25] &gt;&gt; and this is the way the Lord. I remember
[8:27] in the in one of the sermons he said he
[8:29] said I'll stand on judgment day with
[8:31] this book. He said when he's dealing
[8:33] with the lamb's book of life study he
[8:35] says he he says there'll be some blotted
[8:37] out that were written in there. He says
[8:39] there's some that can be blotted and
[8:40] some that can't and there's some that
[8:42] were never even up there. He says he
[8:43] says if you understand how that works he
[8:46] says check out this book I'm writing. He
[8:48] says if you have any light in it you'll
[8:50] see it right?
[8:51] &gt;&gt; So but notice here notice how he
[8:52] approaches how he writes us. This is the
[8:54] introduction. This is how we're supposed
[8:56] to see these things and incorporate
[8:58] these things in our understanding. He
[9:00] says through this volume with will
[9:03] concern through this volume will concern
[9:05] itself with various major doctrines such
[9:07] as godhead, water, baptism, etc. found
[9:09] in revelations chapters 1-3. In its main
[9:12] theme, he says uh is the setting forth
[9:15] of a detailed study of the seven church
[9:17] ages. This is necessary
[9:20] in order to study the understanding of
[9:22] the rest of revelation. So notice this
[9:25] has to be first.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; For out of the ages come the seals.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; We can't skip,
[9:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[9:40] &gt;&gt; The revelation Jesus Christ, we go right
[9:42] to the seals or or the thunders or or
[9:45] like or the or the trumpets.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just study the trumpets, you
[9:48] know, nothing else matters. Let's just
[9:49] start the trumpets. But God gave this
[9:51] revelation. Now remember this is a
[9:53] revelation of Jesus Christ. This is who
[9:55] he is and this is what he's presenting.
[9:59] This is his order, not you and I orders.
[10:01] This isn't my order. This ain't my book.
[10:03] Uh this is his book. This is his
[10:05] revelation. This is the way he wants to
[10:07] present it this way. And it's for a
[10:09] reason. He says out of the ages comes
[10:12] the seals and out of the seals come the
[10:13] trumpets. Out of the trumpets come the
[10:14] vials. Like a first burst of the Roman
[10:17] candle. He says the church ages come
[10:20] forth with the mighty illumin initial.
[10:23] You notice he calls us the first
[10:25] &gt;&gt; initial. He says illumination without
[10:28] there could be no further light. So we
[10:30] don't catch this light.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Good.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; You know why the denominations don't
[10:35] understand what the seals are? Because
[10:37] they don't understand what the first
[10:39] initial illumination is.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Oh that first white horse rider he says
[10:44] is the it is the it is Christ coming
[10:46] down. Is Jesus on the white horse?
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Well, when they start with the seals
[10:51] like that and they try to figure out all
[10:52] these things of God, they don't even
[10:53] understand the beginning.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; If you don't understand where we are in
[10:57] time, brother said, we can't dislocate,
[10:59] we can't misplace, we can't
[11:00] misinterpret, right?
[11:02] &gt;&gt; And that's what denominations do. He
[11:04] says, he says, "But once the brilliance
[11:07] of the seven church ages given by divine
[11:10] teaching, by the time divine preaching,
[11:13] revelation,
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Jess, Pastor Jesse can preach, he can
[11:18] teach because the pastor's apt to teach.
[11:20] I I consider myself at best maybe the
[11:23] tiniest little nobody teacher there ever
[11:25] was." Right? But here, if I can teach
[11:27] it, doesn't matter. It takes a
[11:29] revelation of God to open this, right?
[11:31] He says, but now notice he says given by
[11:34] divine revelation,
[11:36] light upon light follows. So this we
[11:39] have to the initial illumination is on
[11:42] the church ages. If we miss this light,
[11:44] if we miss any of these stages in the
[11:46] light, we're going into darkness.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; We have to walk in the light as he is in
[11:53] the light. Was he not walking in the
[11:55] church ages? Absolutely. I'm trying to
[11:58] lay a foundation here. He says, "Until
[12:00] the whole of the revelation opens wide
[12:02] before our wandering eyes." Uh, praise
[12:05] the Lord. Now, notice that's
[12:06] introduction. Now, notice this is what
[12:08] we hit this morning here. How did John
[12:10] get here? How did this revelation come
[12:12] to to the people? And then, remember
[12:14] after after uh John was released from
[12:17] the aisle of Patmas, he went back and
[12:18] pastored uh Ephesus until the time of
[12:20] his death. And he brought this
[12:22] revelation and he sent it to all the
[12:24] churches, right? He brought this book
[12:26] directly from Christ. this this this
[12:28] this scribed book and he gave it to all
[12:30] the churches, right? Uh but notice the
[12:32] saints were wondering how do what is
[12:34] coming? Where are we at? What time is
[12:36] it? John, where are we at? There's
[12:37] persecution. Will anyone even see the
[12:39] coming? Lord, I don't even know what's
[12:41] going on. And John's stressed up about
[12:43] this, stressed about this. He says, "Oh,
[12:44] another person in our church has been
[12:46] martyed. Another person is fall away
[12:48] because what? They don't know what time
[12:50] it is. They're standing for the word of
[12:51] God. They're doing everything again for
[12:53] the kingdom of God." And then now John
[12:54] God has to pull John and put him on the
[12:56] aisle of Patmas to get alone with him
[12:58] there as Pastor Jesse dealt with he
[13:00] showed in Jeremiah how Jeremiah was in
[13:02] prison to catch the revelation right
[13:05] here here John was in prison as well on
[13:07] an island to catch the revelation. God
[13:10] has to sometimes pull us out there into
[13:13] like this as brother Vang was saying
[13:15] well we don't really want to go to
[13:16] prison let's do it now while we have
[13:18] free time. Let's do it now before we get
[13:21] to prison. So so we're prepared.
[13:22] Absolutely. If God can show us, how do
[13:24] we maybe even avoid prison, to escape
[13:26] anything? We have to escape death,
[13:28] saints.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; We have to escape death. We have to have
[13:31] faith to escape death, let alone prison.
[13:33] Amen. So,
[13:35] &gt;&gt; he says, "So, no, Jo was a prophet. We
[13:38] know that." And so, they were asking
[13:39] these questions. Now, here's the key.
[13:40] I'm going to show you the key right here
[13:42] to what I think here uh what the I
[13:44] believe the the emphasis emphasis here.
[13:46] Now notice as John was uh notice here in
[13:49] Revelations 1 and10 and I was in the
[13:52] spirit on the Lord's day
[13:56] and behind and heard behind me a great
[13:59] voice as a trumpet. Now notice he was in
[14:01] the spirit on the Lord's day.
[14:04] Where is the Lord's day? He's John's
[14:07] right here. He's caught up. He's now
[14:08] been transferred from around 90 95 98 AD
[14:13] to the Lord's day. He took time travel.
[14:16] He went into the future.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; God translate him to the future. And
[14:22] he's in the Lord's day.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; And he's looking forward. He's looking
[14:27] to to what's coming. He's in the Lord's
[14:29] day and he's looking forward because God
[14:30] runs in time. He's looking forward.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; What is the Lord's day?
[14:38] Ram said he says that's when the days of
[14:39] man have ended because as because one
[14:42] thing what John when he turned to look
[14:44] he saw Christ as a judge
[14:48] &gt;&gt; because the golden girdle was not upon
[14:49] his side or his waist but it was on his
[14:52] paths right he said now he's moved from
[14:54] priesthood
[14:56] to judge so now he now Christ has now
[15:00] come off and and he's doing he's doing
[15:02] something different now he's no longer
[15:04] intercessions over for the Gentiles The
[15:07] gentile time is over. He's in the Lord's
[15:10] day
[15:11] &gt;&gt; and he's the only thing. Now notice if
[15:13] he would have continued in that line,
[15:15] what would he what would he what would
[15:16] what would he be picking up at?
[15:18] Revelations 4
[15:20] &gt;&gt; into the rapture. Because after the
[15:22] gentile day is over, we're caught up.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; We're out of here. We are going to be
[15:27] with our Lord Jesus Christ. We're we are
[15:29] the bride of Christ. Our bodies will be
[15:31] changed. So if he would have continued
[15:33] on,
[15:35] he would have just went right into the
[15:36] rapture. And then when he was saw the
[15:37] seven seals unfold and all those things,
[15:43] &gt;&gt; but the place where John was caught up
[15:45] in,
[15:47] Jesus said he heard John said, "I heard
[15:50] a voice behind him in time." And he had
[15:54] to look back and here we see we behind
[15:57] me was a voice. John had to look back
[15:59] and what was John's focus now? What was
[16:01] Christ trying to show to John? What was
[16:04] he going to reveal to John? What was the
[16:06] revelation of God? What was the
[16:08] revelation of Jesus Christ now to John?
[16:10] It was not going into the rapture. He
[16:13] had to show him something before the
[16:14] rapture took place.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; He had to bring a thought. He had to
[16:18] start bringing his mind, his revelation
[16:21] to him, the understanding to him of what
[16:24] takes place before the rapture. Some You
[16:26] need to know something before the
[16:28] rapture.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. I'm preparing you for
[16:31] the rapture.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; And look what he says here. He says,
[16:36] "And I turned to see the voice being spa
[16:39] turned with me and I saw seven golden
[16:40] candlesticks." So notice he says he's in
[16:42] the Lord's day, but he said, "I want you
[16:44] to see this light first."
[16:48] &gt;&gt; In order to make the rapture in
[16:50] Revelations 4:1 and2, you have to see
[16:52] this first.
[16:54] You have to prepare yourself first
[16:56] because remember now he's judge.
[16:59] He's seeing Christ as judge. No longer,
[17:01] hey, grace, we can, you know, okay, you
[17:03] failed here, you failed here, you failed
[17:04] here. No problem. We got you. We got
[17:06] you. We covered, recovered. Now he is
[17:08] judge.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Time's over.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Good.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; And God is allowing John now to see how
[17:18] he judges
[17:21] the churches.
[17:24] Right now,
[17:26] &gt;&gt; look at here. Now, brother Brandham
[17:28] brings one scripture in when he deals
[17:31] with Christ right here. He says, "Gird
[17:33] about the paths with the golden girdle."
[17:35] He said, "Now he's judge." And he links
[17:37] this scripture to John 5:22.
[17:40] For the father judges no man, but hath
[17:42] committed all judgment unto the son. So
[17:45] notice now he's revealing Jesus is
[17:47] revealing John the judgment of the son.
[17:51] He's revealing that Jesus this is I'm
[17:54] just I don't want to run too far but I
[17:56] want now notice.
[18:00] So as Christ comes into the judgment as
[18:03] he is all committed all judgment unto
[18:05] the son. Look at verse 24. He that
[18:08] heareth my word and believeth on him
[18:11] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[18:12] shall not come into condemnation.
[18:15] So here was John. John found himself on
[18:18] judgment day.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; In the time of the judge, was John in
[18:22] condemnation?
[18:23] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[18:25] Because we see later, and we'll hit
[18:27] that. You can hit this later. Pastor
[18:28] Jesse takes this up and runs with it. We
[18:30] find that after all these things, Jesus
[18:32] lays his hand on John and says, "Fear
[18:34] not."
[18:38] &gt;&gt; So, notice here's John, a sinless man,
[18:40] but he was full of the Holy Ghost. He
[18:42] was in the spirit. Oh, he was in the
[18:44] Holy Ghost on the Lord's day and there
[18:47] was nothing to condemn John. Everything
[18:49] that he revealed to John through these
[18:51] seven church ages, there was nothing on
[18:53] his charge.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; But now that's John. What about us?
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Now, John didn't understand. He saw all
[19:03] these. He didn't know understand what
[19:05] was all this was about because the
[19:07] revelation would be given
[19:10] by Revelations 10:7, our prophet. Right
[19:13] &gt;&gt; now notice here's our rapture right
[19:15] here. Now notice if John would have not
[19:18] been heard the voice of Jesus wanted to
[19:20] continue on. This is what would took
[19:21] place. And after this and I looked and
[19:23] behold the door was open in heaven. And
[19:25] the first voice which I heard was a
[19:26] trumpet talking which said come up
[19:28] hither and I will shoe these things
[19:30] which must be hereafter.
[19:34] So notice after the church age is
[19:36] immediately done. He sees it goes up. He
[19:38] says come up hither the rapture. And
[19:40] then now after the rapture, we see that
[19:41] what Jesus says, I will show you things
[19:44] here after this.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Good. Good.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; The bride's going to be here watching
[19:48] these things unfold up in heaven.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; There is a time sequence. Brother said
[19:54] he says he says Revelations 5 follows
[19:57] Revelations 4 in time sequence in the
[19:59] church age book.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Notice here we see the prophet. He says
[20:05] we're going to take up this verse by
[20:06] verse and a lot. I've got scriptures
[20:07] wrote down here, a book of them, and I
[20:09] don't know how far we get into it, but
[20:10] may may the Lord lead us. Now, watch the
[20:12] word is after these things after the
[20:15] church age and all this from hereafter.
[20:19] He says, even use that word hereafter
[20:21] will now be pertaining will take place
[20:22] on the earth after the rapture of the
[20:24] church. See the rapture.
[20:28] This is now going back back now to pick
[20:31] up Israel after the church ages. after
[20:34] the age of the church, Jesus, the church
[20:36] never appears again until Revelations
[20:38] 19. And when she returns with the
[20:40] bridegroom, praise God for the wedding.
[20:43] Amen. Now, this this afternoon, I want
[20:45] us to focus on this next quote. I want
[20:47] to focus on this, and this is where
[20:48] we're going tonight by God's grace.
[20:52] Now, the Greek word for revelation is
[20:54] apocalypse, which means unveiling. This
[20:56] unveiling is perfectly described an
[20:57] example of a sculpture unveiling his
[21:00] work of statuary, exposing it to the
[21:02] onlooker. It is an uncovering, a
[21:04] revealing what's been previously hidden.
[21:06] Now uncovering, now the uncovering is
[21:09] not only the revelation of the person of
[21:11] Christ. In fact, tonight, this is what
[21:13] we're going to focus on. We're not going
[21:14] to focus on the revelation of the future
[21:17] works in the oncoming church age, but
[21:18] we're going to focus now on the
[21:19] revelation of the person of Christ.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; This is the focus tonight, the person of
[21:26] Christ.
[21:33] Notice, but this is a revelation of
[21:35] Jesus Christ.
[21:37] Now, praise the Lord, brother Malachi
[21:38] and uh his sisters and little brother
[21:40] there have never, I don't think, ever
[21:43] been indoctrinated by what is this? What
[21:45] does this represent? The trinity.
[21:50] But we have, right? The bang has. I
[21:53] don't know about this brother here now,
[21:54] but but uh this is the trinity.
[21:59] This is the trinity. God in three
[22:01] persons. Right. What was the great thing
[22:04] when I heard this word?
[22:06] Because when I was a denomination, they
[22:08] said, "Brother Simon," he said, "when I
[22:09] get to heaven, when you get to heaven,
[22:10] don't you try?" He goes, "Try to
[22:12] imagine." He says, "We get to heaven and
[22:14] there's the father on the throne. Jesus
[22:16] is in the crystal sea with his legs in
[22:18] it just sitting around and here comes
[22:21] the Holy Ghost, the dove just floating
[22:22] around, just flying around the spirit."
[22:25] He goes, "Did you ever imagine it that
[22:26] way?" And I go, "Now I wasn't
[22:28] denomination, just a brand new
[22:29] Christian." I said, "No, I always
[22:32] thought it was Jesus on the throne."
[22:35] And he said, "That's interesting." I
[22:37] said, "Yeah, I I don't know why I don't
[22:38] think of three in there, but I always
[22:40] thought there was just one."
[22:42] But now,
[22:45] what is the most important revelation we
[22:47] have? The New Testament does not reveal
[22:49] another God. It is a further revelation.
[22:52] He says, "Of the one and same God."
[22:55] Christ did not come down to make himself
[22:56] known but he came to reveal the son. He
[22:59] came to reveal make known the father. He
[23:01] says he never talked about two gods. He
[23:03] talked about one God. And now in this
[23:05] last age we come to the capstone
[23:07] revelation.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; The capstone revelation the most
[23:14] important revelation of godhead in the
[23:16] whole Bible that Jesus is God. He and
[23:19] her father one and this is God and there
[23:20] is one God and his name is Lord Jesus
[23:22] Christ.
[23:23] So when I heard the message, what was
[23:25] it? There's one God. That was a
[23:29] tremendous revelation that I've been
[23:31] lied to my entire life. Not even knowing
[23:34] or understanding what tr Trinity was.
[23:37] And we had a great rejoicing. Oh man, we
[23:40] had Bible studies on Godhead. First
[23:42] Timothy 3:16, great is the mystery of
[23:45] godliness. Christ was what God was
[23:47] manifest in the flesh, justified in on
[23:50] the earth or however, seen of angels and
[23:51] and received up in glory. Okay.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; There it is. Right here. I got an X
[23:55] here. Really? Yeah. Absolutely. Now,
[23:58] man, that's the that's that's the
[24:00] capstone
[24:01] revelation.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Did everyone bring their spiritual
[24:07] capstone message? Capstone hats. You are
[24:11] dubbed capstone king. Capstone princess
[24:16] queen. Capstone. Capstone. You have
[24:18] arrived.
[24:21] Or have you?
[24:24] There is one God.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; That's basics. But what's a further
[24:31] revelation of the Godhead? Now
[24:34] that Jesus
[24:36] was the word, the logos
[24:39] &gt;&gt; that came out of God, the a spirit body,
[24:42] then the invisible father, then the God
[24:44] himself, the spirit then went and dwelt
[24:46] within the logos.
[24:48] Now you got a greater understanding of
[24:50] the godhead. Wow. One knowing there's
[24:52] one person. That's fantastic.
[24:55] But now we understand the logos, who
[24:58] Jesus was. Oh my, how powerful. He was
[25:01] the pillar of fire. And then out of in
[25:04] the pillar of fire when Moses appeared
[25:05] to there in the backside of the desert
[25:07] as that that pillar of fire, that
[25:08] burning bush out of the void out of that
[25:11] pillar of fire, a voice spoke. And then
[25:13] what was it? It was father and son. The
[25:14] father in the son, the body, right? the
[25:17] logos. Simple. Once again, you have the
[25:21] capstone
[25:22] revelation.
[25:24] You understand
[25:26] the father. You understand
[25:29] God.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; I'm capping you off.
[25:34] There's nothing more to know. There's
[25:36] nothing more to understand, is there?
[25:39] Now,
[25:41] I think uh Pastor Jesse believe this
[25:43] same here. Proverbs 8. I believe this is
[25:46] the logos.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; I believe this is the word. I believe
[25:49] this is the pillar of fire. Uh anyhow,
[25:52] so we've arrived.
[25:55] We have we understand there's one God
[25:58] and we understand who Jesus was. He was
[26:00] the word. He's a logos.
[26:02] You're on the mountaintop.
[26:04] You have literally summoned Everest in
[26:07] the spirit realm.
[26:10] T sign your name on top of the peak. Put
[26:13] your tag on there and say, "I've been
[26:14] here.
[26:17] You got it. You understand?
[26:20] Oh my goodness.
[26:27] I know. All I understand all things. The
[26:30] revelation.
[26:33] But Jess, got anything deep for me?
[26:35] &gt;&gt; I already got the capstone revelation of
[26:37] the Godhead.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; We're the bride. The bride knows the
[26:44] husband.
[26:54] Or does he continue to reveal himself?
[26:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Is there more to this than what we've
[27:01] thought?
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Is there more than just knowing there's
[27:06] one God and that Jesus was the logos?
[27:09] Look what the Bible says. Thou believest
[27:11] there's one God. Cain served one God.
[27:14] Cain worship one God. Cain tried to
[27:16] bring a sacrifice before one God. He
[27:19] says the devils also believe and
[27:21] tremble.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; The devils already have the
[27:24] understanding there's one godhead.
[27:26] There's one person in the godhead.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, why would he pervert it?
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Remember, he knows the truth. He has a
[27:33] level, a portion of truth, but then he
[27:35] always perverts and twists it and takes
[27:37] one and makes a three. Yes, sir. Yes.
[27:44] So, where are we going this uh
[27:46] afternoon? Right back here.
[27:51] Now, here's the thing.
[27:53] I was on the spirit on the Lord's day.
[27:59] John was here at the end of the age.
[28:02] Christ, the Gentile door was shut.
[28:06] He's moving to the Jews now, but the
[28:08] Gentile door is shut. Now, we see Christ
[28:11] or sorry, John in the Lord's day.
[28:15] And what is Jesus trying to convey to
[28:17] him? What is uh I'll say it like this.
[28:21] John's right here.
[28:23] The rapture is ready to take place
[28:27] because what? He's already off the mercy
[28:29] seat. He's now Jesus is now judging
[28:31] these things.
[28:34] Will Jesus marry
[28:38] a wife that's spotted, wrinkled,
[28:42] &gt;&gt; sir.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Contaminated with humanism,
[28:45] &gt;&gt; spotted with the world, spotted with
[28:48] humanism, uh uh has any flaws or defect
[28:51] on her?
[28:52] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; He won't do that. Right?
[28:59] &gt;&gt; So he that's why he could not bypass the
[29:02] seven church ages and go right to the
[29:04] rapture
[29:06] &gt;&gt; because because remember John was
[29:08] already in 95 97 98 AD right here at
[29:11] this revelation
[29:16] but John saw there was something wrong
[29:19] in that age. He already called out
[29:20] diatrophies who love to have the
[29:22] permanence among the ministers among the
[29:24] church. Right.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:27] But God can't leave it like that. He's
[29:29] got to what? He's got Now, the bride has
[29:31] already fallen. We see I mean, we know
[29:34] these things, right? But John, I don't
[29:36] know if he knew or understood, but he
[29:37] did say he's there's many antichrists
[29:39] already in the world now.
[29:43] But in order for Jesus to take his bride
[29:45] up, she must be spotless. She must be
[29:47] pure, unadulterated virgin word bride.
[29:50] She must be a word bride.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, in other words, this bride has
[29:56] to be prepared. How can they be how can
[29:59] he pick up John from the uh Ephesian
[30:01] church age and bring him right here and
[30:03] he be undefiled? There'll be nothing
[30:05] wrong with him. How's he going to get to
[30:07] that condition? See, John had to be
[30:09] shown the seven church ages.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; In order to what that for the end time
[30:15] bride to make herself ready, right?
[30:19] He says now notice he says nickelagenism
[30:22] is organiz organization humanizing the
[30:24] leadership of the church and thereby
[30:26] disposing the spirit. So once nickel
[30:29] comes in it dispos it chases off the
[30:31] spirit of god and once the spirit of god
[30:33] is off then then uh uh uh balamism can
[30:36] come in then and change the doctrines
[30:39] &gt;&gt; right
[30:39] &gt;&gt; because there's no one to call it out.
[30:41] The holy ghost is no longer in control.
[30:42] The people have not yielded to the holy
[30:44] ghost anymore. He says, "Balum is a
[30:46] denomination denominationalism which
[30:48] takes the church manual instead of the
[30:50] Bible." He says, "But now notice what
[30:52] the prophet says here.
[30:54] But if the rapture should take place at
[30:56] this moment,
[30:59] ignorance would not be no court of
[31:01] appeal from the judgment of God for
[31:03] being in the wrong ranks."
[31:05] &gt;&gt; So how come God had to re reveal the
[31:08] seven church ages? because the seven
[31:09] church ages showed the antichrist spirit
[31:12] through the church defiling defiling the
[31:14] church making it powerless formal and
[31:17] weak right sickly then finally we see in
[31:19] the se the four church age spiritual
[31:21] death struck her
[31:24] &gt;&gt; right
[31:25] &gt;&gt; so when John's here in the spirit on the
[31:27] lord's day right before the rapture he
[31:30] has to get a revelation of how to keep
[31:33] himself clean
[31:35] &gt;&gt; he's giving well god is Jesus Christ is
[31:37] giving you clues he's giving giving you
[31:39] the information needed especially in
[31:41] this day so that what as he said here he
[31:44] says come out come out of her my people
[31:47] that you be not partakers of her sins
[31:48] they receive not of her plagues he has
[31:51] to have a pure bride right that's why
[31:53] when John was in the spear year he had
[31:55] to look back so what God could reveal
[31:58] him something
[32:00] because what we have to make ourselves
[32:02] ready come out of her my people right
[32:08] &gt;&gt; so Now notice
[32:13] and notice and in the midst of the
[32:14] candlesticks one like unto the man
[32:16] clothed with garment down to the foot
[32:17] and gird about pass with a golden
[32:19] girdle. Right? Judgment. Now notice what
[32:22] does John turn to see.
[32:24] I've read this so many times in the
[32:25] church age book and nothing's like why
[32:27] is this even in here? I don't understand
[32:29] what this is. Why is this portion of
[32:32] scripture? I mean I can see this is a
[32:35] very very important
[32:37] but what about these
[32:39] and his head were his head and hairs
[32:41] were white like wool and white as snow
[32:44] and his eyes were as a flame of fire.
[32:46] Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I read over this
[32:49] time and time for years and I'm just
[32:51] like it's in there for a reason but I
[32:53] just don't get it yet up until about a
[32:55] month and a half ago. And his feet were
[32:58] like fine brass as they burned in a
[33:00] furnace. And his voice is a sound of
[33:01] many waters. And his right hand seven
[33:03] had seven stars. And on his mouth went
[33:05] seven two-edged uh went out a sharp
[33:07] two-edged sword. And his countenance was
[33:08] the sun shineth in his strength.
[33:11] What is this? The prophet breaks it
[33:14] down. He says this is the sevenfold
[33:16] glory of his person or seven personages.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? It's his person.
[33:23] Sevenfold. These are seven attributes of
[33:26] his person. And what's his person? The
[33:29] godhead. It's who Jesus Christ is. It's
[33:32] what he's done. This is how he's
[33:35] displaying himself in symbolic form.
[33:38] This is how he's displaying himself at
[33:40] the judgment. This is how he's going to
[33:42] judge.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; This is who he is. Would you want to be
[33:48] caught
[33:49] in front of this man right here
[33:54] without the understanding of what was
[33:56] given to us?
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said if you're he
[34:00] says in the time of the end he says he
[34:02] says ignorance will not be a court of
[34:05] appeal.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Well I didn't know we have a seventh age
[34:09] messenger here a prophet to tell us and
[34:12] give us the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[34:15] Right, brother. Right.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; This is who he is. That's what John saw
[34:22] in symbolic form, right? Yeah, brother.
[34:28] We're getting there, brother. I'm
[34:30] hopeful. I'm hoping I can get there.
[34:31] Okay. But yeah, that's a very that's a
[34:34] very key one. That's a heavy one. That's
[34:36] that's a real heavy one. Yeah.
[34:45] This is a key quote.
[34:47] We have to do this quote. We have to
[34:51] fulfill this quote. Brother, it's not
[34:53] scripture. I know, but this is this is
[34:55] in scripture. This I'm telling you this
[34:56] is important. He knows that the people
[34:59] get the true revelation of the true
[35:00] church and what she is
[35:03] and what she stands for that she can do
[35:05] the greater work. She will be invincible
[35:07] army. Now notice if if
[35:11] Do you choose to? Yes. Do you want it?
[35:14] Yes.
[35:15] If they get the true revelation of the
[35:17] two spirits within the framework of the
[35:19] Christian church. Where's the framework?
[35:21] Where's the where's the two spirits in
[35:22] the framework of church revealed to
[35:24] John? He had to turn back and look and
[35:27] he saw something going on here in the
[35:30] seven church ages. What have we been
[35:31] battling? What has the sons and
[35:33] daughters of God been battling for seven
[35:35] church ages for 2,000 years? The
[35:38] antichrist spirit. But what is keeping
[35:40] what is saving us every time is what?
[35:42] The Holy Spirit. Amen. There's two
[35:44] spirits within the framework of the
[35:46] church.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Where's the focus on this? Where's the
[35:49] preeminence? Where's the teaching and
[35:51] preaching on this
[35:54] within the framework? And by God's
[35:56] grace, discern and withstand the
[35:58] antichrist spirit. If we do not do this,
[36:02] we'll go into the tribulation. If we do
[36:04] not do this, we'll make the rapture
[36:07] because the bride is not going to have
[36:08] any influence of the antichrist spirit
[36:11] on her at the time of the rapture. At
[36:13] the time of the Lord's day when Jesus
[36:14] comes down as judge.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Every make sense? Make sense? Okay. Make
[36:20] sense?
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[36:26] He says, "For as much as we are the
[36:28] offspring of God, we ought not to think
[36:30] that the Godhead is likened to gold or
[36:32] silver or stone or graven by art and
[36:35] man's device.
[36:37] And the times of this ignorance, God
[36:39] winked at." So there's a time where in
[36:42] the Old Testament, they'd make images of
[36:44] this and images of that and all these
[36:46] sort of things of God and this and that
[36:47] and God winked at their ignorance. And
[36:50] for seven and for I was like this for
[36:52] six church ages God had winged to
[36:54] ignorance that that Columbus believed
[36:57] probably in three persons.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Luther probably believed in three
[36:59] persons. Wesley probably believe in
[37:01] three persons.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Because what the antichrist has turned
[37:04] it. Now notice are they going to be
[37:06] there on the rapture? The dead in Christ
[37:08] rise first. We're going to see them
[37:09] first. Even though they believed in
[37:11] trinity but what God winked at their
[37:13] ignorance.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; But now in our day is there any
[37:17] ignorance given?
[37:19] That's we're in the most dangerous time.
[37:22] We're in the most deceitful time. We
[37:24] have been given a prophet to come and
[37:25] reveal the mysteries of the mysteries
[37:27] should be finished.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Now notice notice as brother Randy said
[37:31] a while back. He says notice the Bible
[37:33] says the mystery should be finished. It
[37:36] never said revealed.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was hanging on the cross,
[37:40] what did he cry out? It is revealed. No,
[37:43] he said it's finished.
[37:46] And the disciples had no idea
[37:49] that he was going to raise again. And
[37:51] yet he told them three, four times,
[37:54] maybe more. He said, "When the son of
[37:56] man is given unto the this and this, and
[37:57] they're going to crucify him, but what?
[37:58] He'll raise on the third day." They
[37:59] didn't understand.
[38:01] But everything that needed preached,
[38:03] every parable that needed taught,
[38:05] everything that needed revealed, every
[38:07] miracle had been done and finished. It
[38:09] was already spoken. It was already
[38:10] written. It was finished, but it had not
[38:12] been revealed.
[38:15] Then after Christ rose and they received
[38:16] the Holy Ghost, then the revelation
[38:18] started coming on what Christ had
[38:20] already finished.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; So notice that's why we're growing in
[38:25] revelation. The prophets already come
[38:27] and preach and the mysteries are
[38:29] finished, but are they fully revealed?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Because if they were revealed, we'd be
[38:35] taking wash already.
[38:40] Now notice,
[38:41] because he hath appointed a day in which
[38:44] he will judge the world in righteousness
[38:47] by that man whom he hath adorn ordained.
[38:49] And who's that? The Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:51] John 5:22.
[38:53] Exactly what John saw in the Lord's day.
[38:55] It's him. It's Christ. And what did he
[38:57] look like? He eyes of fire, a sword
[39:00] coming out of his mouth, white hair,
[39:02] wool, and feet of brass, and all those
[39:04] sort of things. Says God, that's him.
[39:06] That's who's going to judge it.
[39:07] But at that time there's no more
[39:09] ignorance.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Now look what we see here. Here we see
[39:15] him in a sevenfold personage of his
[39:17] glorified state. In each church age, he
[39:20] approaches them in a different one of
[39:22] those deities, a different one of those
[39:24] glorified states.
[39:28] So with each church age, what we saw
[39:30] there, the seven personages, he's going
[39:32] to pick and choose which one he wants to
[39:34] represent today. And they all have a
[39:35] meaning for each church age.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[39:42] like we said here, what is his person?
[39:44] What is his revelation of his person?
[39:46] His personality, his attributes, his
[39:49] mindset. What kind of person is he?
[39:55] Malachi. Now, I believe brother Malachi
[39:56] is a son of God. Does everybody believe
[39:58] brother Mali is a son of God?
[39:59] Absolutely. But somewhere because he's a
[40:02] son of God, he has to have a soulmate.
[40:05] Malachi, could you tell me your your uh
[40:07] wife's name,
[40:09] please? Oh, why not?
[40:13] It hasn't been revealed to him yet.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; And then in a year or two or whenever he
[40:19] God allows this sister to come on the
[40:22] scene,
[40:25] they're going to start talking and then
[40:27] he's going to learn her name and she's
[40:29] going to learn his name.
[40:31] And as they talk, they start to learn
[40:33] more. What's your favorite color,
[40:34] brother?
[40:36] He's like gold.
[40:39] He's like all the spectrum of the
[40:40] rainbow.
[40:42] And she's going to be like, "What color
[40:43] do you like?" She's like, "I like pink."
[40:48] I'm a girl
[40:51] and they're going to start conversing
[40:54] and they're going to start talking.
[40:56] And if the Lord allows, love will strike
[40:59] there and love will strike here.
[41:03] And finally, Malachi can't even start,
[41:04] can't even work on the job. H thinking
[41:07] about her too much, he's got to get
[41:08] married.
[41:12] But until they get married, even though
[41:14] they've shared their favorite colors and
[41:16] their plans for life, I like this kind
[41:18] of kind of car. I like my food like
[41:20] this.
[41:22] They're still not going to know each
[41:24] other until they get married.
[41:28] One day,
[41:31] four months down into the marriage,
[41:32] brother Malachi is going to wake up.
[41:35] What's that noise? Oh, my wife snores.
[41:39] Oh my goodness. Oh, I'm sleep
[41:41] downstairs. God bless. I'm out of here.
[41:45] But he never knew that she could snore
[41:47] that loud before.
[41:50] I'm not I'm just trying to bring this in
[41:52] uh the way
[41:54] &gt;&gt; because as every every husband and wife
[41:55] has to they will find things that drive
[41:58] that at first all you see is perfect
[42:00] love
[42:02] brother Malachi is so big and strong
[42:04] handsome too I'm witnessing that with my
[42:07] my niece Alakans Ally Alli's all in love
[42:10] and she floats she walks on clouds now
[42:14] petals are in her ankles and she is on
[42:17] nine like
[42:20] about this young man over in Kansas.
[42:23] Oh, he throws 95 miles an hour baseball.
[42:27] He's the man.
[42:30] But one day if they get married, she's
[42:31] going to be like, "Wow, he drives me
[42:32] crazy over here on this.
[42:38] But you have to know your mate,
[42:43] &gt;&gt; right? One of the first revelations my
[42:44] wife caught about me is I hate onions.
[42:50] Early in the marriage, she'd make a
[42:51] food, she'd make supper, and had to be
[42:53] like this.
[42:57] What did you put in here? Oh, I just put
[42:59] some onions. Like, do not ever put any
[43:01] more onions in this food, please.
[43:07] And she looked at me and I'm like, I'm
[43:09] serious.
[43:11] She's like, "Okay."
[43:14] I had to That was the only real iron
[43:16] fist I've ever laid down.
[43:19] But she never understood my real hatred
[43:22] to the onions. Right. Just kind of
[43:25] right.
[43:27] This is your husband.
[43:30] Do you want to please him? What was
[43:32] Enoch's testimony
[43:34] &gt;&gt; before his translation?
[43:37] He pleased the Lord.
[43:40] In other words, he knew God. What makes
[43:44] God happy and what makes God sad? What
[43:46] God what makes God rejoice and what
[43:48] makes him angry.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Man, I'm I'm going to if you if you get
[43:57] a chance,
[44:00] man, I'm already 40 minutes. Saints of
[44:02] God. I haven't even got anywhere yet.
[44:03] Okay, let's jump here. No, notice here's
[44:04] Ephesus.
[44:06] These things say saith he that holdeth
[44:08] the seven stars in his right hand.
[44:10] Notice how is he approaching this the
[44:12] the the Ephesian church. He wants the
[44:15] Ephesian church to know this.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; I have seven generals.
[44:22] I'm sending in one for each church.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm walking. Notice it says who
[44:29] walketh in the midst. In other words,
[44:31] it's the same God in each church age.
[44:36] And because he's the same God in each
[44:38] church age, each one of these stars,
[44:41] everyone, each one of these messengers
[44:42] is going to be the exact has going to
[44:45] have the exact same nature and that will
[44:48] be the nature of Christ. Now, one the
[44:50] Bible says each star differs one from
[44:52] another in 1 Corinthians 15. So notice
[44:55] brother Brandham's ministry did not look
[44:57] like
[44:59] I say like St. Paul's necessarily but
[45:01] because of the way we could judge the
[45:03] scripture and see the power of the Holy
[45:05] Ghost the prophets able to say yes St.
[45:07] Paul was the first church age. Then
[45:08] Columbus and Iranius and and Luther and
[45:10] Martin and all those things got he
[45:12] identified by their characteristics and
[45:14] yet they were different stars.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But notice they were all stars. They
[45:18] were reflecting the same one that was
[45:20] walking through them in the church ages.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; There he is the savior.
[45:27] He says walking in the midst. Now notice
[45:30] if he's if he starts out this way, he's
[45:33] going to be this way all the way
[45:35] through. And if and who Christ is in the
[45:38] Ephesians age, he's going to be in the
[45:40] thyron and Pergamus all the way through
[45:43] the same
[45:45] &gt;&gt; the same.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; There is going to be no difference about
[45:48] him in any church age.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; He's going to judge righteously in every
[45:53] church age. He's going to judge the
[45:55] same.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; He says is in each star is going to be a
[45:59] reflection of him.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; There he is. the savior, the salvation
[46:06] lord. He says, "So what is this? What is
[46:10] why does he use this? Why does he use
[46:12] who he looks like? Why does he use who
[46:13] he is?" He says, "There he is the savior
[46:16] walking in the midst of the churches
[46:18] through the seven ages. There what what
[46:19] he has in his first age, he is the all
[46:21] ages to every believer. He is Jesus
[46:24] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[46:25] forever." And and what he did once, he's
[46:27] going to still do and keep on doing all
[46:30] the way. He's going to treat each church
[46:31] the same. Each woman he's going to treat
[46:33] the same.
[46:35] But each woman will have different
[46:36] trials. There'll be different stages.
[46:38] They'll be in dish with this, different
[46:39] that. They'll be stripped of this.
[46:41] They'll be stripped of this. A weaker
[46:43] woman every time. A weaker woman. But
[46:44] what his light, his star is going to be
[46:46] there to strengthen her. What? Through
[46:48] his power.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Hope this is making sense. Now he says,
[46:55] now you will notice that Jesus is
[46:56] walking alone in the midst of the
[46:58] churches. Now notice this is key because
[47:00] remember we have to determine we have to
[47:01] be able to identify the two spirits.
[47:05] Christ is supposed to be alone in the
[47:08] church ages and he walks alone because
[47:10] he's her keeper. He's her redeemer. He's
[47:13] her savior. He's her husband. But
[47:15] there's another one in the garden as
[47:16] well.
[47:21] There is no one else. Neither indeed can
[47:23] be. For he alone wrought her salvation
[47:24] has purchased her with his own blood. He
[47:26] owns her. He is her Lord and Master. See
[47:29] why he hates that spirit, saints.
[47:32] See why he hates what? Now, what is he
[47:34] getting to? I'm just going to jump here
[47:36] because we're at 45 minutes already. I
[47:37] haven't even touched this. Notice uh
[47:40] he's in the right hand are the power of
[47:42] the seven stars who according to
[47:43] Revelations 120 are the seven church age
[47:44] messenger. This signifies the very power
[47:47] and authority of God are behind his
[47:48] messengers to every age. They go forth
[47:51] in fire and power of the Holy Ghost with
[47:53] his word. They are stars because they
[47:55] reflect his light. Now he says, "These
[47:57] seven uh messengers making uh making God
[48:00] known to the people. He that receiveth
[48:02] them receiveth him that sent them." See
[48:04] how important this is? See how important
[48:05] it is to catch the messenger of your
[48:06] day. If you don't catch the messenger
[48:08] day, how can you receive the one that
[48:09] sent him? Because you would know who
[48:11] sent him.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; They all speak. No, no. They all speak
[48:15] and act upon his authority. He stands
[48:17] behind them with all power of Godhead.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Because each age they had to come
[48:22] in the portion of the Godhead revealed a
[48:25] further revelation of the attributes or
[48:28] who he was his personage of who he was
[48:31] for that age.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; I hope I I I'm a man of limited uh
[48:36] vocabulary.
[48:38] Now notice,
[48:40] but in the first church age, he's
[48:42] walking. He's got seven generals. I'm
[48:44] going to reach release one for each age.
[48:46] You go, you go. You go. You go.
[48:52] And as John looks back and he sees Jesus
[48:55] walking in the midst, John Jesus tells
[48:57] John, "Write this to the first church
[49:00] age." And this will be how he starts is
[49:04] how he ends, saints. This now this is
[49:06] the first revelation of the Godhead.
[49:11] Furthermore,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; but this thou hast that thou hatest the
[49:17] deeds of the neglatans which I also
[49:18] hate.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:21] &gt;&gt; So this is a revelation of the Godhead.
[49:25] What if I hate onions in marriage year
[49:28] number one?
[49:30] It's been
[49:32] 18 years. Guess what? I still hate
[49:34] onions.
[49:36] And my wife has never snuck onions in
[49:38] again since that time.
[49:41] She is spotless before me. Absolutely.
[49:45] But this thou hast that thou hatest the
[49:47] deeds and neglation which notice not as
[49:51] I taught this brother Cam came back
[49:52] after service. He goes brother this does
[49:54] not only reveal the godhead attributes.
[49:57] He said but it also reveals the
[49:59] attributes of the bride. She learns by
[50:03] number she has her his spirit. She has
[50:06] his nature inside of her. And what he
[50:09] hates, she also hates.
[50:13] Yeah.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Notice how much she is like her husband.
[50:21] She initially didn't hate it, but once
[50:24] she received the fullness of the Holy
[50:25] Ghost and the Holy Spirit was leading,
[50:27] she started to hate the very she was
[50:29] able to hate the same things that he
[50:30] hated.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[50:35] Now, here's the furtherance here. In the
[50:38] first church age, notice, thou has the
[50:41] hated of these, which I also hate.
[50:43] Notice he still hates it here.
[50:46] But notice at this point in time, she
[50:49] did not hate it.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; She was being stripped of the revelation
[50:56] of who God is and what God likes. In
[50:59] this church age, she did not know that
[51:01] God hated nicotism or people over church
[51:04] or ruling the church.
[51:09] Look at the change. In just three church
[51:11] ages, she was stripped of this
[51:12] understanding
[51:14] and yet still had the Holy Ghost. But
[51:16] that what that thumb of the trinitarian,
[51:18] the false baptism has kept her under
[51:20] their under their grasp.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the beautiful thing.
[51:26] But here is the word Christ himself. He
[51:28] there's the anointed word which cometh
[51:29] uh for the rest of his body the bride
[51:31] the anointed of the same water the water
[51:33] the we also talked about water the ta
[51:35] water also waters the tears the anointed
[51:38] ones only the elected and predestined
[51:40] will be able to detect the difference
[51:41] between them
[51:44] &gt;&gt; what they do they were able
[51:47] can we detect the difference between the
[51:50] wheat and tears they were able to back
[51:53] in Ephesus this
[51:57] that's why my pastor we started doing
[51:59] youth nights and brother Cam's like
[52:00] brother Simon for the youth we're going
[52:02] to teach but I want you to do Bible
[52:03] studies for the adults and I felt like I
[52:06] said Lord I'm going to do a study on the
[52:08] deeds of nickelatans
[52:11] so I and I already had many a lot of
[52:13] ammo already but I was looking for what
[52:15] caused the initial fall of the of the
[52:19] book of acts for 20 years they remained
[52:23] p pure pure and undefiled.
[52:25] But what were the things that the
[52:27] nickelans did that came in and caused
[52:30] the fall? What were the very acts?
[52:33] Not not 3:25 AD. I'm talking about what
[52:37] caused the fall. We can look at the
[52:39] serpent.
[52:40] Brother Ram said, he says she didn't
[52:42] believe a lie. She believed the lie.
[52:47] She didn't believe lies. She believed
[52:49] the lie. Singular.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:53] Everything we see in the serpent,
[52:54] everything we see that that's brought
[52:55] down and defiled Israel, defiled Eve, we
[52:58] see it's taking place here. The exact
[53:00] same thing. But notice we have to get to
[53:03] back to this. Now remember, brother M
[53:05] said there's going to be another
[53:06] Ephesians. He said Jesus Christ was an
[53:08] Ephesian. What? We have to what? Be able
[53:11] to detect the difference between them.
[53:13] They were able to detect by the deeds
[53:15] first of all, but they lost the ability
[53:17] to detect by the third church age.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:21] Now notice, if you can detect, notice,
[53:26] to him that overcomemeth,
[53:29] to him that's able to detect this and go
[53:32] back to the first love,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; you will gain entrance in back into the
[53:39] garden.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; But can we discern yet? Are we able to
[53:48] discern, brother Jess, when we come in,
[53:51] how many ministers have fallen away and
[53:53] yet they were invited over in the this
[53:55] big church, this just preaching, had
[53:57] gifts, amazing gifts.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Where are they now?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Were they able to discern? They were
[54:06] still not able to discern.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[54:13] the spirit saith unurches. to him that
[54:15] overcomemeth. This is where this is
[54:17] number one church age. Notice this is
[54:20] how close they were to the book of acts
[54:22] still. If they would have just went back
[54:24] to the first love they already detected
[54:26] the niclatans. If they would have just
[54:28] went back he said they could have went
[54:29] back to the tree of life.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; They've been back to they made rapture
[54:35] &gt;&gt; but they failed aimed at but they
[54:37] relaxed. Right now,
[54:42] here's this one. These things sayeth the
[54:45] first and the last last. That which was
[54:47] dead and is alive. He approaches this
[54:49] church age. Now, as this attribute, what
[54:52] is it? This moves right into the ox age,
[54:56] death. Christ says, he says, he says, as
[54:59] you're going to die, he says, be
[55:00] faithful unto death. He says, but
[55:03] notice, he says, he says, I was first
[55:05] and last. I was already dead. He says,
[55:07] "And I'm still alive. So when you die,
[55:09] be faithful because you're going to rise
[55:11] with me.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring you back up again in
[55:14] this rapture." Right?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "So this is not a man speaking.
[55:17] This is deity."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; This is one of the revelations of
[55:22] Godhead. He says, "Don't worry about
[55:23] your lives. Take no thought for
[55:25] tomorrow. Do this and that. Seek ye the
[55:27] first the kingdom of God." He's in his
[55:29] righteousness. Don't worry about your
[55:30] clothing, your food, or this that. He
[55:31] says, "Why?" He says, "Because if you
[55:33] happen to die, I'll raise you up." Amen.
[55:35] But what this is revealing who he is and
[55:37] that you're going to be with him. This
[55:39] is a revelation the bride has. That's
[55:41] why we can be go faithful what into the
[55:43] into the midst as as uh uh Antipus went
[55:47] right to the heart of the pope. He was
[55:49] what? Anti-Papa, right? He stood right
[55:51] there in the midst of the pope and
[55:53] condemned the whole system and he became
[55:54] a martyr. And that was the one person
[55:56] Jesus said he said to Antabus in that
[55:58] day, my faithful martyr.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And we don't even know who he is in
[56:03] history. a little no name and yet he
[56:06] stood like this in front of the pope
[56:08] says you're antichrist and it cost him
[56:11] his life.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; But what he had a faithful promise he
[56:17] that which is dead and alive. What's he
[56:20] revealing here? Let's I want to jump
[56:21] now. This is the one in the same person.
[56:23] He has let us know that the church is
[56:25] his. Don't you worry. This little
[56:28] portion, this little dash between the
[56:30] time you were born to the time you die,
[56:31] he says, means nothing. We're going to
[56:33] eternity.
[56:34] Just give me this life. He says he says
[56:36] and you'll gain the rest. Lose your life
[56:39] and you'll gain life. Amen. What? On the
[56:41] other side. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, so notice he says that is his
[56:46] right. He bought the church with his own
[56:48] blood. Notice in the death he shows what
[56:50] I purchased this. This is mine. This is
[56:52] this should not only reveal that he
[56:55] purchased it, but it should reveal that
[56:56] you were the one purchased.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; When you read the second church age, you
[57:00] say he died for me. And if you accept
[57:03] the true token, the true sacrifice,
[57:05] what? You're going to rise with him.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; He is worshiped. He paid the full price.
[57:12] He has sole ownership of the temple of
[57:14] God. He rules it. He is worshiped in it.
[57:16] He represents He resents anyone taking
[57:19] over his lordship and authority.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Everything Brother Ram's describing
[57:27] that he hates is the Antichrist spirit.
[57:29] He hates when the Antichrist spirit gets
[57:31] in man.
[57:32] Yes, sir.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; He hates man leadership. What has been
[57:36] plaguing the church ages? Man
[57:37] leadership.
[57:39] As the as brother Cam promote one time,
[57:40] he says, "What's so close to deceive the
[57:42] very elected?" What what what is the one
[57:44] quote or scripture or whatever that's so
[57:45] close to deceive the very elected
[57:49] leadership of the Holy Ghost plus human
[57:54] &gt;&gt; laying right in the church age book.
[57:56] Sure, we see the anointing of the Holy
[57:57] Ghost. We see this. But then they inject
[57:59] their little thoughts and say, "Well,
[58:00] maybe we should do it this way or maybe
[58:02] my idea will work too." And yet the Holy
[58:05] Ghost is right there. False anointed
[58:07] ones, false Christ. And yet injecting
[58:09] their own idea right now. Let me jump
[58:12] here. I want to jump here.
[58:14] Now notice here. Here we're jumping to
[58:17] this. We're almost an hour.
[58:20] And here's where here's the quote.
[58:21] Here's the quote. No, notice these
[58:22] things. See, say uh these things say
[58:24] saith he which hath a sharp sword of the
[58:27] with the two edges. The message to the
[58:29] third church age is about to come forth.
[58:31] The third scene of the unfolding drama
[58:33] of Christ in the midst of the church is
[58:34] about to be revealed with a trumpet-like
[58:37] voice. The spirit presents the matchless
[58:39] one.
[58:42] He which hath the sharp sword with two
[58:44] edges. Now how vastly different is
[58:46] notice uh uh in the second church age he
[58:49] says I was alive and dead and now liveth
[58:51] again. It shows what they were battling
[58:53] death. But now in this age he's showing
[58:55] something else in the church this third
[58:57] church age. He says, "How vastly
[59:00] different is this representation from
[59:01] the time when Pilate introduced the lamb
[59:04] of God clothed in mocking the robes of
[59:06] purple, smitten with the crown of
[59:07] thorns, saying, Behold your king now
[59:09] regally robed, crowned with glory re
[59:11] stands the risen Lord Christ the God of
[59:14] power." Now notice what the prophet says
[59:16] in these words which we have. He which
[59:20] hath the sharp sword with two edges lies
[59:23] another revelation of Godhead.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; See how important these are?
[59:28] This is a revelation of Godhead. What
[59:31] took place in the church age where God
[59:32] says
[59:34] the sword. He has drawn the sword.
[59:43] He has ignited the sharp terrible sword.
[59:47] Two edges that can discern the thoughts
[59:49] and intents of the heart that can serve
[59:51] what all the way down to bone and marrow
[59:53] and all those sort of things. He's
[59:54] brought he's bringing the word. what has
[59:58] taken place in this day that this is
[1:00:00] what he's this is his attribute
[1:00:06] in the Ephesian church you will recall
[1:00:07] he was sent forth as the unchanging god
[1:00:10] he hates this he hates this in the
[1:00:12] smurian church age we saw him as the one
[1:00:14] true god and beside him was no other now
[1:00:16] in this pgam church age is a further
[1:00:18] revelation of his godhead set forth by
[1:00:21] the association
[1:00:23] he's revealing himself by his his weapon
[1:00:27] This is the offensive armor in Ephesians
[1:00:31] which is the word of God. Here's the
[1:00:32] scriptures he brings. Hebrews for the
[1:00:36] word of God is quick, powerful, sharp
[1:00:37] and dedicious sword. Right? The word in
[1:00:39] Ephesians 6, take the sword of the
[1:00:40] spirit which is the word of God. His
[1:00:42] name is called the word of God. In the
[1:00:43] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:00:44] God. The word was God. 1 John 5. There
[1:00:46] are three that bear record of heaven.
[1:00:47] The the father, the word, and the holy
[1:00:49] ghost. These three are one. He's
[1:00:50] revealing this. This is who he is.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] Now we can see his association with the
[1:00:56] word. He is that word. That is who he
[1:00:58] is. The word is his name. Now why is he
[1:01:01] doing this? Because brother Brandham
[1:01:02] said he said in early in his ministry he
[1:01:04] said he thought the evidence of the Holy
[1:01:06] Ghost was love.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:11] It's so good to see you brother. We're
[1:01:13] knitted like Jonathan and David.
[1:01:17] We're going and we're like
[1:01:19] he's got the Holy Ghost. I got the Holy
[1:01:21] Ghost.
[1:01:22] But later it took the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:24] reveal that was not the evidence. The
[1:01:28] evidence now this is what he goes into
[1:01:31] this section. This is what the prophet
[1:01:34] reveals with this portion of the godhead
[1:01:37] is the evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:40] When the bride gets back to being a word
[1:01:42] bride, she will produce the very works
[1:01:44] that Jesus produced. Talk about revival.
[1:01:46] Now notice the word is a spirit. The
[1:01:47] spirit is God. They are all one. One
[1:01:49] cannot apart work apart from the other.
[1:01:51] If one truly has a spirit, he will have
[1:01:53] the word of God. Right? Now, notice he
[1:01:55] goes in, he's dealing with the evidence.
[1:01:57] He's showing what the evidence is. Uh
[1:02:00] he said the evidence would be that you
[1:02:02] would be have you would be in the truth.
[1:02:03] You would be in the word of God for your
[1:02:05] age. Evidence has to do with receiving
[1:02:07] the word.
[1:02:09] Notice
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; this is what he goes to. Now, notice I
[1:02:11] want to jump here. Now, why would he
[1:02:14] bring forth
[1:02:16] the sword?
[1:02:24] He is presenting presenting himself to
[1:02:26] the church at Pergamus and indeed to all
[1:02:28] churches. He says, "I am the word. This
[1:02:32] which I'm giving you, the word is the
[1:02:34] revelation of myself." Do you understand
[1:02:36] how dangerous this is? If Jesus is the
[1:02:40] word, the revelation of the word should
[1:02:42] be on you.
[1:02:45] And what is the revelation in
[1:02:46] Revelations 22? do not add or take away.
[1:02:50] Why? Because in this third third church
[1:02:52] age, someone was rising up. This is when
[1:02:54] the Catholic Church started.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; And who was the main push? Who was the
[1:02:58] main major guy who changed the word of
[1:03:01] God?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; St. Augustine was I'll tell you what, I
[1:03:07] would never want to be in his shoes.
[1:03:09] It's too late to ask mercy for him
[1:03:11] because it's already done and said done.
[1:03:14] These are just some of the things he
[1:03:15] changed in this age. Notice the the
[1:03:19] Catholic Church through St. Augustine
[1:03:22] using intellectual reason,
[1:03:24] demon-possessed man.
[1:03:27] He pushed for the persecution of
[1:03:29] heretics.
[1:03:31] Augustine. And here Christ is revealing
[1:03:33] himself with the sword. You come at me
[1:03:37] with false doctrine, I'll be right here
[1:03:39] with the sword.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not playing games. Augustine
[1:03:44] and saints of God, that's how important
[1:03:46] it is to stay with say what the prophet
[1:03:48] said. Don't add to it. Don't take away.
[1:03:50] Stay what the Bible says. Don't add or
[1:03:52] take away.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Taught the doctrine. He brought the
[1:03:56] doctrine of eternal hell.
[1:03:59] Changing the word. And God said, "Oh
[1:04:01] yeah, I'm judging you on this day
[1:04:03] according to the word
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; and you can't escape it. This is who he
[1:04:10] is. This is who he is. This is a
[1:04:13] revelation of the godhead saints. That's
[1:04:16] why revelation 22 terrifies me.
[1:04:21] Taught doctrine of purg purgatory or
[1:04:23] post uh mot purification.
[1:04:27] Someone dies and oh he's called into the
[1:04:29] flame of purgatory in between heaven and
[1:04:31] hell and this and that and now Malachi
[1:04:33] if you could just give me $50 I'll pray
[1:04:34] that your um whatever can get out of
[1:04:37] Malachi's like oh 50 bucks no problem.
[1:04:40] Now do my false prayers and and then oh
[1:04:41] he's up in heaven now. God bless your
[1:04:43] heart. Here's my 50 bucks. And that's
[1:04:46] how the Catholic Church became rich many
[1:04:47] times.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Read listen to seven church uh church uh
[1:04:51] 750 years in church of Rome. Again
[1:04:53] developed the numbering and grouping
[1:04:55] system of the ten commandments. Changed
[1:04:56] the ten commandments. Remember how he
[1:04:58] what he do? He had ten commandments. He
[1:05:01] took the ten the second one took it out.
[1:05:04] Took the tenth. Cut it in half. And now
[1:05:06] we're back to 10. And what do they do?
[1:05:07] They make idols, images,
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; statues of God, the saints and all those
[1:05:13] sort of things. Teaching the authority
[1:05:15] of tradition and the of the church, the
[1:05:17] Roman Catholic Church. No, it's all
[1:05:19] lower caps for me. Roman Catholic lodge.
[1:05:21] I should have put a L in there. Lower
[1:05:22] case L as inseparable from scripture
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; and Christ is there
[1:05:30] watching this and I'm going to judge
[1:05:32] them according to the word that they
[1:05:33] perverted.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. But remember in each age
[1:05:37] they started perverting the word
[1:05:42] started praying to Mary and introduced
[1:05:44] infant baptism. And that's just probably
[1:05:46] some of them that I found real fast.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; See that's why he was in that third per
[1:05:50] pilgrimous church a sword.
[1:05:57] Bless you.
[1:06:00] Right.
[1:06:05] Oh God, help us to be real protesters
[1:06:08] against anything that's not godly. Oh
[1:06:09] my. Yeah.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; But now to him that overcomemeth
[1:06:15] that gets back to the word,
[1:06:19] he's revealing that he's the word. He's
[1:06:20] bringing the word is him. This is how
[1:06:22] he's going to speak. This is how he's
[1:06:24] going to judge it by the word. So we
[1:06:25] have to get back to the word. But if we
[1:06:26] get back to the word, if we overcome to
[1:06:29] him that overcometh will I give him to
[1:06:31] eat of the hidden mana.
[1:06:34] If we stay with the word, he's going to
[1:06:36] take us what? Into the holiest of holies
[1:06:39] and open up and share the deeper word.
[1:06:43] [Laughter]
[1:06:45] But remember, this is also our reward.
[1:06:48] If we can stay away from false doctrine
[1:06:50] in this message, we will also be given
[1:06:53] hidden mana, secret things opening up,
[1:06:56] revelations untold.
[1:06:59] He says, "Now give him a white stone and
[1:07:01] a stone uh with a new name written which
[1:07:03] no man knoweth saving he that
[1:07:04] receiveth." Notice in each church age
[1:07:06] Christ brings forth a further revelation
[1:07:09] the godhead. He points out what was
[1:07:11] good, what was bad, and then said if you
[1:07:13] saints can overcome, he says, "I'm going
[1:07:15] to give you this reward.
[1:07:20] We're past an hour already. I'm going to
[1:07:21] go one more.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; One more.
[1:07:27] Brother, this is for you.
[1:07:29] And on the fourth fourth church age,
[1:07:34] I'll say remember the third church age.
[1:07:36] What was the problem? Now the deeds of
[1:07:39] the nickels have become a doctrine
[1:07:41] standard. This how we do it. Uh you
[1:07:44] don't do it that way. girl
[1:07:46] and also was introduced the doctrine of
[1:07:48] Balum.
[1:07:50] See remember in this day on the Lord's
[1:07:52] day John there'll be no excuses then
[1:07:55] we've got to search this message out
[1:07:57] find out exactly what the deeds are what
[1:08:00] the doctrine is become the become deeds
[1:08:02] right then what balam isis ism is and
[1:08:05] then into Jezebel's doctrine of Jezebel
[1:08:10] what's he dealing with this last age and
[1:08:11] this or in the fourth church age
[1:08:15] unto the angel the church in Leo and
[1:08:17] Thitara write these saying the son of
[1:08:20] man. Notice this is who he is. This is
[1:08:23] who he is. Saints,
[1:08:28] let me give you an example.
[1:08:30] When I was a heathen in college and I
[1:08:32] was atheist and this and this, I started
[1:08:35] working at a place called Solder
[1:08:36] Woodworking. That's where I met Brother
[1:08:38] Craig and Big Dave and many others,
[1:08:40] right, Brother Freddy.
[1:08:42] And my second year as a college help,
[1:08:47] the year before, my first year, I went
[1:08:48] to work over at Brush Creek, which is
[1:08:50] another facility doing this exact same
[1:08:51] thing and packing. Okay, we pack all
[1:08:53] these uh RTA
[1:08:55] uh uh
[1:08:58] desks and
[1:09:00] drawers and dressers and all those
[1:09:02] things, right? Slide it through. Done.
[1:09:04] And I went to work for a a plant manager
[1:09:07] lady and I was working this and this and
[1:09:09] she's like, "Oh." She was like an older
[1:09:10] lady and she's like, "Oh, I really like
[1:09:12] how you work." Like, "Okay." And right,
[1:09:15] I couldn't wait to get back to my old
[1:09:16] plant because that's where all my boys
[1:09:17] were playing basketball at night. Right.
[1:09:19] So, the second year I go back,
[1:09:22] they assign me to her plant
[1:09:26] and I was there for about a week and I
[1:09:27] couldn't handle I could not handle
[1:09:28] working under a woman. I'm stronger,
[1:09:32] faster, not taller. It's faster and
[1:09:35] stronger. Like there's no way I should
[1:09:37] work under. I never liked being under a
[1:09:39] woman. I could not handle it.
[1:09:42] I don't know what it is about me. I
[1:09:43] don't know if it's that nickel or that
[1:09:45] Napoleon mentality or whatever like
[1:09:47] little guy like
[1:09:49] I just couldn't handle it, right? So I
[1:09:51] went to the imagine this a college help
[1:09:53] going to human resources and like I went
[1:09:56] back to where I was. Well, I don't care
[1:09:58] what she wants. I went back here. Guess
[1:09:59] what? They put me back there. I did not.
[1:10:02] Then sometimes when I got back there,
[1:10:03] they sent me to another plant where
[1:10:04] another lady lady's over and I'm like, I
[1:10:06] can't stand working under here. Why?
[1:10:09] It was built in me already.
[1:10:16] Look at Christ in the fourth church age.
[1:10:20] Eyes
[1:10:22] of fire.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Forget the sword. Now I'm dialing you
[1:10:27] right in. my eyes on you and I'm hot.
[1:10:32] I'm mad. Fourth church age.
[1:10:36] Thousand years pass really
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; from when the antichrist came in.
[1:10:43] What is Thyra? A dominating female
[1:10:47] spirit.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; I'm a little man, but I'm still a man.
[1:10:55] You know what?
[1:10:57] I love my wife, but every time she gives
[1:10:59] me an order, everything it takes all
[1:11:02] within me to be like,
[1:11:06] "Okay, okay, I can help you." Because I
[1:11:09] just don't like getting orders from
[1:11:11] women. You can give me the youngest punk
[1:11:14] kid running a job and I'll serve him,
[1:11:16] but you put any woman over top me.
[1:11:20] I don't know. Sorry, sorry, sorry,
[1:11:22] sorry. That's just who I am.
[1:11:25] And that's who he am.
[1:11:28] Notice he says, "These things say the
[1:11:31] son of God." Now he identifies himself
[1:11:34] as the son of God. Amen. Who has his
[1:11:39] eyes like a flame of fire and his feet
[1:11:42] like fine brass.
[1:11:45] I'm coming after her. I'm judging her
[1:11:47] because why? I'm the guy who walked
[1:11:50] through that persecution. I died. I
[1:11:52] walked through it by myself. You're
[1:11:54] right.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I have every right. I was the one who
[1:11:58] conquered this. I have every right and
[1:12:00] now I'm eyeing you up.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; And look what the prophet says before
[1:12:09] the I'm sorry. This is after the sermon.
[1:12:12] Look what the look what the speaking
[1:12:13] tongues interpretation is on this church
[1:12:16] age. On this church age. Yay my people.
[1:12:20] This is the interpretation I speak.
[1:12:22] Pastor Jesse already dealt with this
[1:12:23] years and years ago. He says, "Yay, my
[1:12:25] people, I speak of thee. As my prophet
[1:12:26] has stood in the midst of thee, has
[1:12:28] declared my holy word. I speak unto thee
[1:12:30] by my spirit, sayeth the Almighty God. I
[1:12:32] say that thee, my people, are out in
[1:12:34] this world tonight." I saying they that
[1:12:36] thee, my people, he says, that yay, I
[1:12:38] have spoken days gone by concerning
[1:12:40] these things, even this very hour.
[1:12:44] Notice he's just dealing with the
[1:12:46] Catholic Church. He's dealing with how
[1:12:48] what she's defiled everything. He gave
[1:12:51] her space to repent. And now notice what
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost is revealing in this time
[1:12:56] of the fiery eyes.
[1:12:58] Even this very hour, there are great
[1:13:00] plans being made. We're seeing them
[1:13:03] unfold right now.
[1:13:07] Even while he was preaching this in
[1:13:09] 1960, there was big shooters. There was
[1:13:12] world world movers. There are people
[1:13:14] controlling the realms of the earth
[1:13:16] making plans that same night while the
[1:13:18] prophet was bringing forth the word.
[1:13:23] And we're seeing them now,
[1:13:26] even this very hour. There are great
[1:13:28] plans being made. Yay. That this is the
[1:13:30] Holy Spirit speaking through the gifts
[1:13:32] in the church
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; being made that shall bring the hour of
[1:13:36] destruction upon America, this fair
[1:13:40] land.
[1:13:44] Destruction is coming, saints. And this
[1:13:46] man with fiery eyes, this man with the
[1:13:48] sword, this man that with the seven
[1:13:50] seven uh warriors coming forth, this man
[1:13:53] that walks at certain seven church ages,
[1:13:55] he is now declaring by his spirit,
[1:13:58] the woman that does this is going to
[1:14:00] destroy this nation.
[1:14:02] She
[1:14:04] is going to destroy America.
[1:14:07] Even in this world tonight, there are
[1:14:09] spiritual forces being gathered together
[1:14:11] that shall come against thee, my people.
[1:14:13] She's gonna rise. What Abraham say? He
[1:14:15] says, he says, "Right now, we're in
[1:14:16] peace. The Catholic Church doesn't have
[1:14:18] power yet to bring persecution,
[1:14:21] but he she will rise again to kill." He
[1:14:24] says,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; "They're coming. They're coming for us.
[1:14:33] Why is our vice president Catholic? Why
[1:14:35] is our last president Catholic? Why is
[1:14:37] the majority of our Supreme Justice
[1:14:39] Catholic?
[1:14:41] Was Charlie Charlie Kirk Catholic?" I
[1:14:43] don't know. But his wife had some
[1:14:45] rosaries sticking out the car, rosary
[1:14:47] beads.
[1:14:50] But I say unto thee, he says, "It's
[1:14:53] coming. It's coming, Jesus. But I say
[1:14:54] unto thee, be thou not discouraged in
[1:14:56] that day nor hour."
[1:14:59] Brother, they're going to take us.
[1:15:01] They're going to take control. Be not,
[1:15:03] this is the Holy Spirit, this is the
[1:15:04] Holy Spirit speaking. This ain't me.
[1:15:05] This ain't the prophet. This is God
[1:15:07] himself speaking. Be not discouraged.
[1:15:12] For I say that I am the great Almighty
[1:15:16] God. Even as I took my children from the
[1:15:18] land of bondage, yay, even as I am
[1:15:20] brought them into the wilderness to the
[1:15:21] promised land, even shall I take thee
[1:15:23] home with me.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you're going to make a
[1:15:27] rapture.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You will not see death.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; This woman that I'm judging right here
[1:15:34] with my fire eyes, she's coming after
[1:15:36] you again. She's coming back at my
[1:15:38] bride. But don't worry, I'll be there.
[1:15:41] I'll save you. I'll swing on down on my
[1:15:43] on my chariot, on my on my cloud, and
[1:15:45] come down like Psalms 18.
[1:15:49] For I say that I have loved thee with my
[1:15:51] great love. How does he express love?
[1:15:54] Through correction. Through sharing the
[1:15:56] secrets,
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; of the word of God.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; But we have to receive them and detect
[1:16:03] the true spirits with He says, "And I
[1:16:06] have called thee out of the world of sin
[1:16:08] and speak." He's done that. And I speak
[1:16:12] these words that thou might be a chosen
[1:16:14] people, and that in thee might manifest
[1:16:17] my power and glory uh as unto thee that
[1:16:20] I might be encouraged, that thou might
[1:16:21] be encouraged. In other words, he's
[1:16:23] going to display his power through you.
[1:16:24] Don't worry.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Death's coming, but don't worry, he'll
[1:16:28] be there right in the midst of the fire.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Thanks, God. Everything the prophet went
[1:16:32] through, everything we see in the Bible
[1:16:34] that they had to go through, we're going
[1:16:35] to have to we're going to have to walk
[1:16:36] into death.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Turn back. Go into the storm.
[1:16:41] You're getting thrown into a fire seven
[1:16:42] times hotter. Thou shalt bow down to my
[1:16:45] image. Daniel Daniel prayed. He went to
[1:16:47] lions. Then they were all delivered.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; They were all delivered, saints.
[1:16:54] Remember that. Have faith in God.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Then it happens again. He's speaking
[1:16:59] tongues uh interpretation. Yay, my f my
[1:17:02] servant has spoken tonight. Blessed be
[1:17:04] my word as it goes forth. My servant is
[1:17:06] dishonored. Much has been said, much
[1:17:08] evil is to come upon the earth, sayith
[1:17:09] the the Lord God. And this is revealed
[1:17:11] during what? Thyra dominating female.
[1:17:17] Now tonight he comes with flaming fire.
[1:17:20] He's looking into sorry down into thyra.
[1:17:22] This age is the age is married into cath
[1:17:25] catholicism and paganism or nicicoatism
[1:17:28] pagism wedded together to form and gave
[1:17:30] birth to the first church to organize
[1:17:31] church. What are we waiting for? When
[1:17:32] this echomunical world council church
[1:17:34] forms and then church and state are
[1:17:36] married again. See what it produces?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; This is her. We're going to see her
[1:17:41] again.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; We're not going to have American law.
[1:17:43] We're going to have Roman law. Roman
[1:17:46] Catholic lodge law.
[1:17:48] But don't worry.
[1:17:51] But look what brother reiterates.
[1:17:55] God said that. Notice he goes right back
[1:17:57] to this. And God said that the deeds of
[1:17:58] the Galatian, which is the Ephesians
[1:18:00] over in that little church of Pergamus
[1:18:01] became a doctrine and said it was a
[1:18:03] doctrine of Balum. And Baal was the one
[1:18:05] who taught Israel they're committing
[1:18:06] fornications and they have committed
[1:18:07] fornication with Moab which was a
[1:18:09] lukewarm church member or common church
[1:18:11] the great orization and we find out that
[1:18:13] God said that that nicolate's doctrine
[1:18:15] which he take put all power in a church
[1:18:16] and set it aside to make an oration he
[1:18:18] says he says you hate it I hate it too
[1:18:21] he just keeps saying I hate it I hate it
[1:18:23] I hate it when are we going to learn
[1:18:24] this in the message
[1:18:27] this is a revelation of who he is that's
[1:18:30] why I that's why every chance I get I
[1:18:32] blast any Catholic doctrine Anything
[1:18:35] that came from Rome, come out of her, my
[1:18:37] people. Anything Catholic, anything
[1:18:39] Roman, we've got to come out of
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; because there's no more ignorance now.
[1:18:44] And we see how God, look at how he looks
[1:18:47] at that church. He hates that church.
[1:18:52] And here it comes into full swing here.
[1:18:54] See, see how the church squeezed up
[1:18:55] right in this little thing. How the
[1:18:56] church they're on now. He says the
[1:18:59] revelation
[1:19:00] of godhead in the leosian theotian
[1:19:03] church age is that god that Jesus is the
[1:19:05] son of god
[1:19:09] once in the days of his flesh he was
[1:19:11] known as the son of man but but
[1:19:13] henceforth we know him no more after the
[1:19:14] flesh he's no longer the son of man the
[1:19:17] great prophet who is back in who in
[1:19:19] himself gathered together all prophecies
[1:19:20] the only begotten is back in the in the
[1:19:22] bosom of the father now we know him
[1:19:24] after the power of his resurrection all
[1:19:27] power is given under me in heaven and
[1:19:28] earth.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; He is riven risen and has taken unto
[1:19:32] himself his mighty power and is above
[1:19:34] all and over all to the praise of his
[1:19:37] own glory. His glory will not be shared
[1:19:39] with another. Who notice who's in the
[1:19:41] midst now? A woman. The Antichrist
[1:19:43] spirit now has risen up a church woman
[1:19:45] who's trying to rule his church ages and
[1:19:49] he hates it. She's lording over the
[1:19:51] people. And then not only that, but she
[1:19:52] has daughters that are lording over the
[1:19:55] people, saints of God. a bunch of woman
[1:19:57] controlling God's kingdom. Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Look at his hatred for it. He displays
[1:20:03] his eyes of fire.
[1:20:12] His glory he will not share with
[1:20:13] another. His leadership over the church.
[1:20:16] Remember she siteth upon many waters.
[1:20:19] His leadership of the church he will not
[1:20:21] surrender to any man, any pope.
[1:20:26] Notwithstanding, look how loving Jesus
[1:20:28] is to even her.
[1:20:31] I have a few things against me because
[1:20:32] thou suffest that woman Jezebel which
[1:20:34] calleth herself a prophetus. Now she's
[1:20:36] claiming to come from God to teach and
[1:20:38] seduce my servants to commit fornication
[1:20:40] to eat things sacrificed idols and I
[1:20:42] gave her space to repent of her
[1:20:44] fornication. She repented not. And if
[1:20:46] you look at the timing, she he God
[1:20:48] allowed her to kill for a thousand
[1:20:49] years.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; In all of that, she literally had a
[1:20:56] 1,000year window to repent.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Look at the And we worry about
[1:21:02] ourselves. Oh, I had a bad thought and
[1:21:04] forgive me, Lord. And Lord, I should
[1:21:05] have said this. I He let her go on for a
[1:21:08] thousand years. And I gave her space a
[1:21:12] thousand years to repent, but she
[1:21:14] didn't.
[1:21:16] Saints of God, we find ourselves falling
[1:21:17] short. Falling short. We repent. Repent,
[1:21:19] saints of God. We're going to be okay.
[1:21:21] We God has grace for us. Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And she repented not. Behold, I will
[1:21:28] cast her into bed and with them that
[1:21:30] commit adultery with her in a great
[1:21:31] tribulation except they repent of their
[1:21:33] deeds. See, goes all the way back to the
[1:21:35] Ephesians. And I will kill her children
[1:21:36] with death. So notice that's a danger
[1:21:40] in the in the message churches.
[1:21:42] Has any of this taken place in the
[1:21:44] message churches?
[1:21:46] Is there any antichrist spirit in the
[1:21:48] message churches? We've got to be able
[1:21:50] to discern this because if they go so
[1:21:53] far, they're going to turn like this.
[1:21:55] Remember when I taught I don't know if
[1:21:56] you did I teach you the the the doctrine
[1:21:59] of Jezebel.
[1:22:01] There's two major things brother brought
[1:22:02] about that. He says the doctrine of
[1:22:04] Jezebel is literally
[1:22:07] he causes spiritual death. But when they
[1:22:10] have spiritual death, he said they'll
[1:22:12] get no more revelation.
[1:22:15] They lose all ability to see to the next
[1:22:18] light
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; because now this not even the light
[1:22:21] because they missed the light way back
[1:22:22] there. This is the fourth molting the
[1:22:26] fourth stage of the antichrist spirit
[1:22:28] saints
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; just like uh they can't if they if
[1:22:33] they're into bailism they can't discern
[1:22:35] the deeds.
[1:22:37] You know many how many ministers I've
[1:22:38] asked
[1:22:39] brother uh and humbly I said brother
[1:22:41] what's the deeds
[1:22:44] I don't know
[1:22:46] so you don't know what the deeds are you
[1:22:49] don't even know what the first
[1:22:52] revelation of the godhead
[1:22:55] attribute is supposed to reveal
[1:22:57] well I know I know there's one god in
[1:22:59] the log go no no no no no we don't do we
[1:23:02] even know our husband do we know our
[1:23:05] husband
[1:23:08] Because when he comes, when this thing's
[1:23:10] over, it's over, saints. It's over.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Be free and clear. Ask God to reveal
[1:23:16] these things. These this is eternal
[1:23:19] decisions here. We've got this to me.
[1:23:22] This is saints God. To me, the way that
[1:23:23] the way I feel, this is so important.
[1:23:27] Yes, sir.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Because on that day, there's no excuse.
[1:23:31] Lord, I didn't know.
[1:23:34] We have 00 sermons, an entire Bible
[1:23:37] full, and you can run everything back to
[1:23:39] the scripture.
[1:23:41] Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Now, let's uh let's stand by the word of
[1:23:45] Let's just stand here by God's grace.
[1:23:46] I've been an hour and 20 already, and I
[1:23:47] haven't even gotten I want to I don't
[1:23:49] want to end the end in the uh eyes of
[1:23:51] fire. Okay,
[1:23:53] I'm going to fast forward to past past
[1:23:55] Leo. Okay, let me just fast forward to
[1:23:57] past Leo. All right, let's just do that.
[1:24:05] We're gonna keep going. We're gonna keep
[1:24:06] going. Ah, here we go.
[1:24:10] As John
[1:24:12] turns and what does he see?
[1:24:16] He sees this man as this one liken of
[1:24:19] the son of man. All these attributes and
[1:24:21] we found out they were attributes of the
[1:24:22] godhead.
[1:24:24] And when I saw him, when he saw these
[1:24:26] things, I fell down at his feet dead,
[1:24:29] and he laid his right hand upon me,
[1:24:31] saying unto me, "Fear not. I am the
[1:24:32] first and the last." In other words, I
[1:24:37] am the father and I am the son. I am all
[1:24:42] of it.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "No human being," I'm just
[1:24:49] going to read this a little bit here. No
[1:24:50] human being could be could stand the
[1:24:52] full effect of that vision. Now notice
[1:24:54] we're talking about John now. Now we're
[1:24:56] talking about the one he was transported
[1:24:58] there. Say to God, there's coming a day
[1:25:00] where the gentile door is shut. And when
[1:25:02] that's shut, he that is filthy is filthy
[1:25:05] still. He that is unjust is unjust
[1:25:07] still. He that is holy is holy still. He
[1:25:08] that is righteous is righteous still.
[1:25:10] There's coming a day that's literally
[1:25:11] going to happen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Do we want to be Now notice John found
[1:25:15] himself as holy as holy. Otherwise he
[1:25:18] would never be able to stand.
[1:25:21] He says his strength was utterly gone.
[1:25:23] John fell to as his feet as though dead
[1:25:24] his hand the hand of the Lord in love
[1:25:26] touched him. This is you at that time
[1:25:30] and the voice of the blessing said fear
[1:25:33] not be not afraid. Don't be afraid. I am
[1:25:36] the first and last. I am he that liveth
[1:25:38] and was dead and behold I am alive
[1:25:39] forever. What is there to fear?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have separated from all
[1:25:44] these things, if you can study these
[1:25:46] attributes of the Godhead and say,
[1:25:48] "Lord, if you hate it, if you don't like
[1:25:50] it, I'm staying a mile million miles
[1:25:52] away. I'm not I'm not staying six inches
[1:25:54] from the edge. I'm hugging that wall.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And right over there is death." Right?
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to look at it. Not putting
[1:26:00] anything wicked before my face. Right.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Going like this. Going like this.
[1:26:06] Just walking the path. I'm good to go.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's me, the
[1:26:10] Lord. Guide me. am keeping right on the
[1:26:12] sir.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; What is there to fear? The judgment that
[1:26:15] fell upon him at the cross at the grave.
[1:26:18] He says, "And when he descended was for
[1:26:20] us, he absorbed the full blunt of the
[1:26:22] wound of sin. And there is therefore no
[1:26:24] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:26:27] Christ Jesus."
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Notice notice remember when he saw him
[1:26:30] that that girdle was on his his past,
[1:26:33] right? Showing he was judged. But now
[1:26:34] look what the prophet says. He says, "He
[1:26:36] absorbs a full blunt." Now surely our
[1:26:38] attorney is our judge. He switched. He
[1:26:41] says, "Look, I'm a judge, but when he
[1:26:43] came and touched her," he says, "But
[1:26:44] you'll be okay. I've already paid it for
[1:26:47] you. You're already accepted in the
[1:26:49] beloved."
[1:26:52] Amen. He says, he says, "He is both
[1:26:54] attorney." He says, "Our attorney and
[1:26:56] judge." See, we have nothing to fear.
[1:26:58] Everything's stacked in our deck. We
[1:27:00] were deceived. We were what? We were
[1:27:02] tricked into the saints.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; But he sent a prophet to tell us what to
[1:27:08] avoid. stay away from.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; As judge, the case is settled. It is
[1:27:14] finished. There is there now no
[1:27:17] condemnation.
[1:27:20] Why should the church fear? What
[1:27:22] promises failed to manifest before us?
[1:27:24] Why should it fear punishment or death?
[1:27:28] Charlie Kirk went and did what he did.
[1:27:30] He went fearless saints
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and God took him fast. Think he You
[1:27:34] think he suffered? He was out the way
[1:27:36] that I mean he was out.
[1:27:39] And just like that
[1:27:41] into the next dimension.
[1:27:47] Why should we fear punishment or death?
[1:27:49] It has been overcome. Here is the mighty
[1:27:51] conqueror. Here is the one who conquered
[1:27:54] both worlds of seen and unseen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And he's going to don't fear John. Don't
[1:28:00] fear little flock. All what is he
[1:28:02] saying? What is the prophet bringing?
[1:28:04] What is the interpretation of this
[1:28:06] laying the hand on the bride?
[1:28:10] Haven's all. Oh, Lord, I see you. And he
[1:28:12] says, "Fear not."
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:28:22] Don't fear.
[1:28:24] Don't fear.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; All my power is yours. See what's going
[1:28:30] to take place on that day. All my power
[1:28:33] is yours. the saints of God. Remember
[1:28:34] when Jesus on the cross? He said, "No,
[1:28:37] you not. I could call 12 legions of
[1:28:39] angels from my father and he would send
[1:28:41] them." Did he do it?
[1:28:44] Who's going to fulfill that prophecy?
[1:28:49] You could have 10,000 people
[1:28:50] surrendering you and the Holy Spirit hit
[1:28:52] you and say, "Send the legions, Lord."
[1:28:55] And they'll come down and I don't know
[1:28:57] what's going to happen,
[1:29:00] but all authority, all power, that same
[1:29:02] power that Jesus had to just call is
[1:29:05] going to be yours.
[1:29:08] My omnipotence is yours as I stand in
[1:29:10] your midst. I am not come to bring fear.
[1:29:13] Yeah, these are hard things, brother.
[1:29:15] the sword, the eyes of fire, the this
[1:29:18] and this. But remember, we're on the
[1:29:20] remember in that church ages was two
[1:29:22] churches.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; There was the true bride and the false.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You are the true saints.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You're not in a Roman Catholic church
[1:29:30] right now. You're in a church who
[1:29:33] receive what? The true word of God.
[1:29:35] Amen. You've been baptized in not a
[1:29:37] Catholic baptism, but the baptism of the
[1:29:40] Bible. Amen.
[1:29:42] All power is given to me and it is yours
[1:29:44] to use.
[1:29:47] Wow, that's pretty powerful, brother.
[1:29:48] You speak the word and I'll perform it.
[1:29:50] Oh my goodness. We're going to be
[1:29:51] invincible army because what? We've
[1:29:53] discerned the two spirits within the
[1:29:54] framework of the church. That is my
[1:29:55] covenant with you and it will not fail.
[1:29:57] Saints of God, how do we get it?
[1:30:00] Amen.
[1:30:03] Cut every obstacle from human beings
[1:30:05] that they might be connected in the
[1:30:06] Garden of Eden.
[1:30:09] connected like in the Garden of Eden.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; See, now there's you're gonna get power,
[1:30:13] but you have to do something.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It cost you something.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Now, man, I'm going to choke. I was
[1:30:19] going to choke it, but I'm going to say
[1:30:20] it. Man
[1:30:22] is omnipotent. The only way you're
[1:30:25] getting out of here in a rapture,
[1:30:27] you don't believe it. A man, but what
[1:30:29] does it what does it what does it cost?
[1:30:31] A man fully surrendered to God is
[1:30:34] omnipotent.
[1:30:36] We had an example. Brother Ram came. He
[1:30:38] was fully surrendered to God and he
[1:30:41] entered into the third pole.
[1:30:45] You will have to be fully surrendered as
[1:30:49] John was.
[1:30:51] Did not he say in Mark 11:22,
[1:30:53] "Whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:30:55] doubt in your heart, it shall come to
[1:30:56] pass. You can have what you've said."
[1:31:00] Malachi gonna come play. And sister,
[1:31:03] what happens when two omnipotents meet?
[1:31:05] When God and man comes together, two
[1:31:07] omnipotent, something has got to shake.
[1:31:09] Brother, Pastor Cam's been working on
[1:31:10] the body and the headship. You know what
[1:31:13] the problem right now in the church is?
[1:31:14] There's a body. We have a body. But have
[1:31:16] the have we connected with the head?
[1:31:19] Because we have connected with the head,
[1:31:21] we're going to have the same mind. We're
[1:31:22] going to have the same faith. We're
[1:31:24] going to have the same signs and
[1:31:25] wonders, and we're going to have same
[1:31:26] power. But at that time of the capping
[1:31:29] when that capstone comes down, we're
[1:31:30] going to be connected like that like
[1:31:33] this because we're going to need it on
[1:31:35] this day
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; when this thing when remember brother
[1:31:41] said once they drop this econ economic
[1:31:44] system
[1:31:45] it's on she will buy she will purchase
[1:31:48] the whole world she we will have she
[1:31:50] will we will have a bailout a Catholic
[1:31:53] bailout
[1:31:55] and the stage is that
[1:31:59] when God and man comes together, two
[1:32:00] omnipotence, something to shake down
[1:32:02] whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:32:05] power of omnipotence of God, knowing
[1:32:06] that he's promised it and he said it, it
[1:32:08] is in his word. It creates a power that
[1:32:11] goes out yonder and bring things to
[1:32:13] pass, things that is not. It makes them
[1:32:16] as though they are because two
[1:32:18] omnipotents have met. There he stand.
[1:32:20] Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[1:32:24] That's the end.
[1:32:27] But saints of God, we've got to find,
[1:32:30] we've got to know our husband all the
[1:32:33] way.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; The antichrist came in and for four
[1:32:38] church ages it went down, down, down,
[1:32:41] and she was dead. And then brother said
[1:32:43] he is like in nature, he had to bring
[1:32:46] forth a Luther, which is a blade. And
[1:32:49] then a stalk came in Wesley. And then
[1:32:51] what? Pentecost was the shuck. And now
[1:32:53] we're coming back to seed saints. And
[1:32:55] he's coming back for a harvest.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; But remember, we have to stay pure seed,
[1:33:02] pure word.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say this kind of
[1:33:05] boldly. We can't even incorporate
[1:33:09] the voice of the prophet if it doesn't
[1:33:11] line up with the scripture.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brham said, brother Ram
[1:33:15] said, Brother Ram said, we have to make
[1:33:17] sure it's in the word.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:33:22] Now remember, it'd be great if he was
[1:33:24] still here. Brother Jess, I would let
[1:33:26] you have the first interview before me.
[1:33:28] Go ahead, take your time. I'll just
[1:33:29] wait, but I want to listen. Can you
[1:33:31] bring your recorder in there so I can
[1:33:32] hear, too? The recording of interview
[1:33:35] with Brother Ram, with Brother Jesse
[1:33:36] Smith. We put on tape, right? We don't
[1:33:39] have that now. So now we have to get in
[1:33:42] the spirit
[1:33:44] to hear, lay before God, and hear and
[1:33:46] know. Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Let's just say a word of prayer. Saints
[1:33:49] of God, if you need prayer this this
[1:33:50] evening, I know it's been a long
[1:33:51] teaching, but saints of God, I hope I
[1:33:53] was able or the spirit is able to convey
[1:33:55] to you what we're looking at.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; The niclatan spirit is not a light
[1:34:03] spirit.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; This is not something we just lightly,
[1:34:07] oh yeah, the antichrist.
[1:34:10] We should be honing this stuff in. We
[1:34:13] should take out the sword and slice and
[1:34:15] dice and cut this anti anti-word stuff
[1:34:17] up.
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:21] Yes, sir.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; This is who he is. Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, we love you.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you, Lord, for open my
[1:34:31] eyes to this, Lord. And Lord, I just
[1:34:33] trust that they were able to hear what
[1:34:34] you would have them to hear.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, I know how I see it. I wish I
[1:34:38] could I wish I had the
[1:34:41] education or the
[1:34:44] the ability to use words and to use big
[1:34:47] words and nice smooth sayings, God,
[1:34:49] Lord, and just kind of bring it how it
[1:34:51] would be a real nice Lord, some people
[1:34:54] can bring, Lord, these hard things in a
[1:34:55] flowery sermon, but Lord God, I just
[1:34:57] Lord, this is how you built me, Lord.
[1:34:59] But Lord, I believe this is so
[1:35:01] important.
[1:35:02] I believe this is going to come play
[1:35:04] here right at the end, Lord. And Lord
[1:35:06] Jesus, I don't want to be caught on the
[1:35:08] ignorant side. I don't want to be c
[1:35:10] caught on the side. I I didn't know
[1:35:12] Lord. But Lord Jesus, you sent all this
[1:35:15] word, Lord, to identify who you are,
[1:35:19] what you like, what you don't like.
[1:35:22] Lord, no one can say on the time at the
[1:35:25] time of the shutting door, at the time
[1:35:26] of the rapture, well, Lord, I thought it
[1:35:27] was okay to be in the Baptist church. I
[1:35:29] thought it was just okay to go to church
[1:35:31] and pay my tithes. And Lord, but Lord,
[1:35:34] we we have more word than that. We have
[1:35:35] more understanding, more revelation.
[1:35:38] Lord Jesus, we know we have to be born
[1:35:39] again.
[1:35:41] And Lord, we have to make ourselves
[1:35:43] ready. Lord, we love you. Bless the
[1:35:44] people. Thank you for giving them
[1:35:46] strength to endure long teaching, God.
[1:35:48] But Lord, we are looking forward to your
[1:35:50] coming. Lord, grant us strength. Grant
[1:35:52] us grace and mercy. Lord, bless the
[1:35:54] people. Protect them on the way home in
[1:35:56] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:35:59] Amen. Saints, if you have any questions,
[1:36:02] I'd be happy to try and answer the best
[1:36:03] I can.
[1:36:05] Uh, if not, Pastor Jesse can pick these
[1:36:07] things up and roll. Hope he I'm sure he
[1:36:10] caught the revelation of it. See the
[1:36:12] importance of it. Once you see what this
[1:36:15] is, saints, I didn't even have a chance
[1:36:16] to even go back in the scripture and
[1:36:17] deal with eyes of fire and sword and
[1:36:20] spirit and psalms and job and all the
[1:36:22] saints of God. It's laying in there.
[1:36:25] How important his word, you know, in
[1:36:26] Psalms, it talks about how his word is
[1:36:28] pure. It's been tried seven times in the
[1:36:31] fire. That's the same thing. What? going
[1:36:33] right back to church age that that in
[1:36:35] the third church age with the with the
[1:36:36] sword of the spirit saints.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; It's laying right there. He is serious
[1:36:40] about his word. Amen. Uh Pastor Jesse,
[1:36:44] you want to come? Let's just sing songs
[1:36:45] to the Lord Jesus.
