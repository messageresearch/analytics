[46:51] [Applause]
[47:02] [Music]
[47:27] [Applause]
[47:56] to be as we stand we get right into the
[48:01] Word of God we'll try not to be long
[48:02] tonight
[48:04] you love the name of Jesus it was at
[48:12] that name mass salvation was purchased
[48:17] and that's what we're going to just talk
[48:19] about the name of Jesus tonight you know
[48:23] we don't hear the name of Jesus like we
[48:24] ought to in the world sometime in
[48:29] churches what is that name that God gave
[48:33] the angel God the angel gave Mary to
[48:37] call the the one who was going to save
[48:39] the entire world we understand this it's
[48:44] the name of the revelation of who Jesus
[48:45] is that the whole church was founded
[48:49] upon Carl said he laid the foundation no
[48:55] no other foundation can be laid we
[48:58] understand by God's grace that it's the
[49:00] name of Jesus who which was the not only
[49:03] the cornerstone but the rejected stone
[49:06] but now has become the chief Cornerstone
[49:08] because when we talk about Jesus the
[49:11] Bible says his name is one God's name is
[49:15] one and I know that even in this message
[49:17] people I have a problem with that name
[49:19] but I don't it's the name that I love to
[49:22] call on and I know that if we're going
[49:25] to have a full revival that God wants us
[49:29] to have as individuals we must know the
[49:35] name of Jesus Genesis 18 14 and Exodus
[49:40] 34 13 through 14 Genesis 18 14 don't
[49:49] worry we're not coming to rebuke nobody
[49:53] we just want to talk about the name of
[49:55] Jesus it is the sweetest name
[49:59] I know Genesis 18 14 it's anything too
[50:08] hard for the Lord at the time appointed
[50:12] I will return unto thee according to the
[50:18] time of life and Sarah shall have a son
[50:24] Exodus 34 but ye shall destroy their
[50:33] altars break down their images cut down
[50:39] their groves for thou shalt worship no
[50:43] other God for the Lord whose name is
[50:48] jealous is a jealous God
[50:52] let us pray father we come before you as
[50:57] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[51:00] your grace in your mercy Lord sometimes
[51:03] I don't even know how to approach your
[51:06] throne seeing that I'm really nothing
[51:10] without you I try my heart's best
[51:14] humming myself before you you are my god
[51:18] you are my lord you are my everything
[51:22] I do know one thing Lord is in my heart
[51:24] to give you honor and glory and praise
[51:28] Lord for what it's worth I know nothing
[51:33] else to do you you are my Creator you
[51:40] saved me you raised me you kept me
[51:43] you've been my my daily sufficiency of
[51:49] things and father I don't know what else
[51:51] to say but glory to your name we thank
[51:55] you for your grace we thank you for your
[51:57] mercy bless your people now in Jesus
[52:00] Christ's name we pray amen
[52:02] you may be seated I just want to start
[52:07] our subject this there's something about
[52:10] that name the name of Jesus Christ is so
[52:15] precious yet it is so powerful I think
[52:20] this is why we're not to take the Lord's
[52:23] name in vain it's a holy name it's a
[52:27] name that God himself named himself and
[52:31] you know this this Jesus we know by
[52:37] God's grace when he was on earth he did
[52:39] not have a good reputation among the
[52:43] religious people uh especially when he
[52:47] claimed to be God in the flesh when he
[52:52] said in Saint John I and my father one
[52:56] that was Saint John 10:30 they wanted to
[53:00] stone him and we find out in numerous
[53:04] occasions that Jesus Fred from death
[53:07] even as a young man because he realized
[53:11] that his death was to come by the cross
[53:14] now Jesus Christ Himself the Bible as
[53:18] John said John said he himself took upon
[53:21] himself no reputation and neither did
[53:24] Jesus Jesus Christ himself many times
[53:27] you know people want to glorify him and
[53:31] and he would hide and many times he said
[53:33] tell nobody he
[53:35] who did this thing so he kind of wanted
[53:39] to stay somewhat in the shadow to his
[53:41] appointed time there were times he even
[53:44] told the people that's not I that do the
[53:47] work you know but it's my father which
[53:49] is in heaven you know he doeth the work
[53:52] and said basically when I see him work
[53:55] then I work here the - so Jesus Christ
[53:59] came to do one thing and that was to
[54:01] glorify his father's name now understand
[54:05] now the father's name was Jesus Amen and
[54:09] this is why the angel told Mary said
[54:12] Mary
[54:13] this thing that being you is God's
[54:16] firstborn a man he he his name shall be
[54:22] called Jesus and Jesus is a New
[54:25] Testament word for Jehovah is salvation
[54:29] now we look at this thing and I say this
[54:32] because that name don't have the kind of
[54:36] effect that it used to have because
[54:38] Hollywood has downplayed it we've seen
[54:42] senator sinners call Jesus name when
[54:45] they would swear and things of that
[54:47] nature so we realize amen that sometimes
[54:50] people in the world even laugh at the
[54:54] name of Jesus but we who are Christians
[54:58] we love the name of Jesus because we
[55:02] realize a man that not only is his name
[55:05] Jesus but the Bible says that he named
[55:08] every all of his a creation his sons his
[55:13] daughters his family after him so their
[55:16] name is Jesus too many times I have told
[55:20] people I said don't you understand that
[55:22] in heaven you know every time you say
[55:25] Jesus on earth all of the family of
[55:28] heaven turns and look and says was it
[55:31] what is it that you want right because
[55:34] their name is Jesus oh come on somebody
[55:37] we are encamped about with a great hope
[55:41] hosts use me of angels and their name is
[55:47] called Jesus
[55:49] they said what do you mean I'm talking
[55:51] about the family of God those who have
[55:55] died in his name will rise again in his
[55:59] name now when we talk about God being a
[56:03] jealous God anybody ever experienced
[56:05] jealousy okay Yahoo y'all went fast
[56:08] enough but I understand I think
[56:10] everybody has at some point or another
[56:13] you know we try to fight it and speak to
[56:17] it and sometime it turn loose and
[56:20] sometimes it grab a hold event but yet
[56:23] it still I don't think I know a man or
[56:26] woman who has never felt the spirit of
[56:28] jealousy jealousy amen is when sometimes
[56:32] you feel like you ought to be getting
[56:34] the attention and you're somebody else
[56:35] is getting more attention than you right
[56:38] and they're always that feeling like oh
[56:41] it's a resentment that comes about for
[56:44] no apparent reason other than you feel
[56:48] like you ought to be getting the honor
[56:50] that the other person is getting amen
[56:54] when we talk about jealousy it's uh you
[56:57] know it's intolerant it's an intolerant
[56:59] of unfaithfulness or rivalry rivalry we
[57:03] talk about war right because that's what
[57:05] happens remember Cain with jealous of
[57:10] Abel and that kind of a jealousy was
[57:13] produced a murderer
[57:16] sometimes our jealousy causes us amen to
[57:19] speak evil of someone by way of our own
[57:23] imagination murdering their character
[57:27] right jealousy is a strong spirit even
[57:31] the prophet of God said that you know
[57:32] when it comes to uh filial love said you
[57:36] know a man loving his wife by way of
[57:38] jealousy can go and kill someone under
[57:42] that inspiration of jealousy yeah hear
[57:45] what I'm saying
[57:45] but you find out that the Bible said
[57:48] that God is jealousy jealous and you
[57:50] know our heard years ago that Oprah
[57:53] Winfrey said when she heard that God was
[57:56] jealous that really made her know that
[57:58] he wasn't God because God can't possibly
[58:01] be jealous we
[58:02] it made me know that alpha rip winfrey
[58:06] doesn't know God because God is even
[58:10] jealous of Oprah Winfrey any man or
[58:15] anything that is placed in God states
[58:19] becomes rival is that right remember
[58:25] there were many statues of the more
[58:27] bison all of them Moloch and all of they
[58:29] they erected before God and God was
[58:32] jealous God knocked him down they raised
[58:36] him up he knocked him down again they
[58:38] raised him up he took off his harms you
[58:41] know it was God he did not and he cared
[58:45] for no one to be in his position but he
[58:48] himself is that right not even you and I
[58:52] we can't allow ourselves and this is
[58:55] what I want everybody to know the bride
[58:58] of Jesus Christ is a wonderful thing to
[59:00] be but never ever mistake that you can
[59:05] take the place of God you understand me
[59:10] even when we preach about the bride we
[59:13] must always include Calvary we must
[59:18] always include the sacrifice of Jesus
[59:21] and how through Calvary it was Calvary a
[59:25] sword that gave us birth hallelujah see
[59:31] without him will nothing even as Eve was
[59:36] a byproduct of Adam liken it to us
[59:41] because without him see the word is
[59:44] perfect
[59:45] it was he who failed hallelujah the word
[59:50] never disbelieved but we disbelieve
[59:54] sometimes y'all hear what I'm saying
[59:58] so to be called by God's name is such an
[1:00:03] honor that everybody should never be
[1:00:08] ashamed of the name of Jesus hello
[1:00:12] somebody you know people they don't mind
[1:00:15] saying God
[1:00:17] you know god is good you ever hear
[1:00:19] people's oh yeah god is good you know
[1:00:21] the Lord is good but when you say ho
[1:00:23] praise God
[1:00:24] you know Jesus is awesome something
[1:00:27] happens in the atmosphere you know
[1:00:31] people don't care even if you talk about
[1:00:33] God in the restaurant but when they hear
[1:00:35] the name Jesus
[1:00:36] the demons awakens they know that
[1:00:40] something's going on when you call on
[1:00:42] the name of Jesus hallelujah you can say
[1:00:46] God and you can say Lord amen and
[1:00:48] nothing will happen but when you call
[1:00:50] upon the name of Jesus the Bible said
[1:00:53] demons has to trim the hallelujah oh
[1:00:56] yeah I tell you what that's one way to
[1:00:58] know that a person got a got a demon on
[1:01:01] when you start talking about Jesus and
[1:01:02] you see their whole countenance change
[1:01:06] it's something about that name when we
[1:01:11] talk about Jesus we we must understand
[1:01:14] you know we must it's a love affair
[1:01:18] people can tell when you the way you say
[1:01:21] Jesus you know I mean you know you know
[1:01:25] wife who's in love with her husband
[1:01:26] she's gonna pronounce his name different
[1:01:29] than way the way you or I would
[1:01:31] pronounce it it's something about the
[1:01:33] way she pronounces it because it it
[1:01:36] literally radiates a love our spirit
[1:01:42] attack on the husband when he hears her
[1:01:45] call her his name oh my god see I don't
[1:01:51] know don't talk about it but in the name
[1:01:55] of Jesus is powerful right amen and we
[1:02:01] find out that the name it must always be
[1:02:05] kept in reverence it's because above
[1:02:08] every name
[1:02:10] yeah and I'm saying the scripture says
[1:02:13] that the name of Jesus Christ is above
[1:02:15] every name right remember during the
[1:02:20] time of Paul when there were those who
[1:02:23] were making themselves disciples of Paul
[1:02:25] and some of Apollo's and some of us each
[1:02:27] listened and you know and they were they
[1:02:30] were dividing the
[1:02:31] self there were Christians but they were
[1:02:33] actually denominating themselves by
[1:02:36] raising up me that they can call
[1:02:40] themselves apart that's wrong we're not
[1:02:45] a part of any man except the man Christ
[1:02:49] Jesus right so you and I must understand
[1:02:54] he says is Christ divided was Paul
[1:02:57] crucified for you or were you baptized
[1:03:01] in the name of Paul
[1:03:03] there was no salvation in Paul even
[1:03:06] though Paul had the ministry they could
[1:03:09] bring salvation to thousands but the
[1:03:15] name that Paul ministered under was the
[1:03:18] authority of Paul's ministry in that
[1:03:21] name was the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:03:29] talked about william branham but it was
[1:03:34] the name of Jesus Christ that gave our
[1:03:38] prophet the authority is that right he
[1:03:41] told us I forgot what country was in but
[1:03:45] there was working witchcraft and they
[1:03:47] had the table's floating with the chairs
[1:03:50] and he said I cast you out in the name
[1:03:55] of the Father nothing happened in the
[1:03:57] name of the son doesn't happen in the
[1:03:59] name of the Holy Ghost nothing happened
[1:04:01] you know brother madam said demons
[1:04:03] travel by way of that Trinity hello
[1:04:09] somebody he said but when I say in the
[1:04:12] name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:13] he said that kid that chair dropped so
[1:04:15] fast broke all the legs off of him I
[1:04:18] don't know who was holding it up or what
[1:04:21] was holding it up but when they heard
[1:04:24] the name Jesus well those demons had to
[1:04:27] let go of the table hallelujah you see
[1:04:31] when you cold brendham said it like this
[1:04:34] he said when you call on the name of
[1:04:36] Jesus he draw close to you see that's
[1:04:40] why we we don't feel him like we used to
[1:04:42] because we don't call on his name like
[1:04:44] used to but I tell you what I've got a
[1:04:46] wife whenever trouble calm
[1:04:48] she knows the name hallelujah sometimes
[1:04:51] when I'm fly we're flying she all she's
[1:04:54] mothering muttering is Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:04:56] Jesus Jesus chain she knows that that
[1:05:01] name is gonna keep that flame that
[1:05:03] plaintiff light hallelujah amen
[1:05:06] and let me tell you something people of
[1:05:08] God when it comes to the name of Jesus
[1:05:11] we should never forget it it should
[1:05:14] never be a secondary word it meant in
[1:05:17] our vocabulary it should be always
[1:05:20] before us when we wake up thank you
[1:05:22] Jesus when we go to bed thank you Jesus
[1:05:25] when we feelin thank you Jesus he should
[1:05:28] always be there the Bible said if you
[1:05:33] acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways
[1:05:35] he shall direct your path and when you
[1:05:39] acknowledge the Lord you call on his
[1:05:41] name hallelujah you can't say hey boy
[1:05:44] you get nothing or hey mister
[1:05:47] you'll get nothing hallelujah but when
[1:05:50] you call him by his name
[1:05:51] I remember brother Branham said when he
[1:05:54] got saved he said I didn't know how to
[1:05:56] pray he said but dear sir
[1:05:58] see you gotta come in room for this if
[1:06:01] you really God he said you would you
[1:06:04] please ask me sir oh I love that just
[1:06:08] gets my heart in I can you see it you
[1:06:10] know he didn't know he was a prophet
[1:06:12] that didn't know much about Christ he
[1:06:15] didn't even know how to call on his name
[1:06:17] but God knew his heart see when your
[1:06:21] heart is right God will reveal himself
[1:06:24] to you see so we look at this and I keep
[1:06:29] saying that folks because I want people
[1:06:31] to understand that I am seeing a revival
[1:06:33] of his name among the true believers
[1:06:37] because even when I was in the Apostolic
[1:06:40] Church it was always the bishop said
[1:06:43] this and the bishop whatever the bishop
[1:06:44] said but Bishop wasn't God hello you
[1:06:50] know and the prophet of God even says
[1:06:52] this if we lift a man of God up so high
[1:06:55] God will cause him to fall
[1:06:58] to get your attention all for him and
[1:07:00] back Oh God hmm and that's why I tell
[1:07:05] people I said don't be lifting me up
[1:07:08] give the other where armies do that
[1:07:13] sister Lord Jesus Christ y'all
[1:07:14] understand me
[1:07:15] amen now we find out Amen by the grace
[1:07:19] of God the Bible says Amen according to
[1:07:22] Psalms 86 6213 see this name is so
[1:07:26] important understand it was the first uh
[1:07:30] I put it this way wing when the angel
[1:07:33] gave it to to Mary Jesus she she may not
[1:07:37] have thought much about it but when she
[1:07:39] spoke that name in the presence of
[1:07:42] Elizabeth she saw that that name had
[1:07:45] resurrection power he was a bad baby
[1:07:49] daddy in the Elizabeth womb for six
[1:07:52] months and Mary goes over to Elizabeth
[1:07:56] to testify what God had done for her and
[1:07:59] so that a little bit could know that God
[1:08:02] has done for something from me just like
[1:08:04] he did it for you and then all of a
[1:08:06] sudden and this was concerned because
[1:08:08] John has not kicked yet and mary says
[1:08:12] without an angel call came by me and he
[1:08:14] told me I was going to have the son of
[1:08:16] God and I should call his name Jesus who
[1:08:19] it penetrated so much so it went into
[1:08:23] the womb of Elizabeth and John begins a
[1:08:25] shout hallelujah he came to life
[1:08:29] hallelujah just by the speaking network
[1:08:32] she that's what the devil has caught us
[1:08:34] he's got us in the place we don't call
[1:08:36] on him enough is this okay
[1:08:41] yeah brother and I hope this is all
[1:08:44] right a brother you know I was preaching
[1:08:46] the message similar to this and you know
[1:08:48] you know we have the brother branham in
[1:08:49] the pillar of fire and all and he asked
[1:08:51] me a question he said what brother man
[1:08:52] brother Brooks he said if I bow down
[1:08:54] before the pitcher and pray to that
[1:08:56] pillar of fire he said is that all right
[1:08:58] I said no tell me I'll probably say yes
[1:09:02] I said no I said first of all that's an
[1:09:06] image of the pillar fire that is not the
[1:09:10] pillar fire
[1:09:12] then I had to explain to him I said
[1:09:15] remember Amen when you had the brass
[1:09:17] Serpent up on the pole that represented
[1:09:21] Christ that represented healing it was a
[1:09:25] foreshadow what Jesus what I'm going to
[1:09:27] do sin being judged on the cross in
[1:09:29] order for those people to live it was a
[1:09:32] mighty thing happening amen because all
[1:09:35] of them were gonna be bitten and died by
[1:09:37] these snake bites
[1:09:38] remember everybody that looked up they
[1:09:40] acknowledge their sins and their
[1:09:42] transgressions and because they did it
[1:09:45] they lived but everybody that dropped
[1:09:48] their head wasn't ready to confess what
[1:09:50] they had done so they died then what
[1:09:54] happened after that it became a
[1:09:57] worshipping idol they began to worship
[1:10:01] that thing that thing wasn't God it was
[1:10:05] their obedience to what God told them to
[1:10:08] do that brought the healing you can burn
[1:10:13] a picture of brother Branham amen with
[1:10:15] that pillar of fire but you're not
[1:10:16] hurting brother Branham another pillar
[1:10:17] fire I wouldn't take a chance you know
[1:10:23] what I mean I cuz I reverence the
[1:10:24] picture but you don't bow to it you know
[1:10:30] when people do that they need the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost because the Holy Ghost won't let
[1:10:34] you do that if God said don't go down to
[1:10:38] a graven image you know or any kind of
[1:10:40] image you know you got to tear it dinner
[1:10:43] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:10:45] well it's amazing because you know
[1:10:47] people have gotten to the place where
[1:10:48] they don't even know what worship is and
[1:10:51] they're guilty of it I'm Wersching
[1:10:54] everything but God it is okay I'm not
[1:10:59] fussing I'm trying to share I'm just
[1:11:03] trying to exalt the name of Jesus
[1:11:05] because I realized amen it's not exalted
[1:11:07] it's not sad enough you don't you know
[1:11:09] even preachers don't even call on his
[1:11:11] name enough but we need to you know when
[1:11:18] the last time you heard acts 2:38 repent
[1:11:20] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ for the remission of sin you said
[1:11:23] well we don't need to do that
[1:11:25] yes we do we've got young fellows and
[1:11:27] folks coming up that need to hear that
[1:11:30] and know the reasons for that
[1:11:35] see it's the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:38] it's the rejected stone he was to reject
[1:11:42] the stone did not did not Peter preached
[1:11:45] on it he said but just this the same
[1:11:48] Jesus God has made him both Lord and
[1:11:51] Christ he's not on the heel he's not
[1:11:54] only only the foundation but he said
[1:11:57] capping off of the building you can't
[1:12:00] change it because the Bible says
[1:12:02] according to Hebrews 13 and 8 he's the
[1:12:04] same yesterday today and forever you
[1:12:09] know I look at the problem of God and
[1:12:10] how he loved the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:12:13] people seem to miss it his love was in
[1:12:19] Jesus not in himself or no other
[1:12:22] preacher
[1:12:23] oh come on somebody give ear o Lord unto
[1:12:30] my prayer and attend to the voice of my
[1:12:33] supplication in the day of my trouble I
[1:12:36] will call upon me for that will answer
[1:12:39] me among the gods there is none like
[1:12:42] unto thee O Lord neither are there are
[1:12:45] any works like unto thy works all
[1:12:49] nations whom thou has made shall come
[1:12:53] and worship before thee O Lord and shall
[1:12:56] what glory by thy name and we have come
[1:13:02] in this age to glory saw his name read
[1:13:08] the book of Acts all through Acts when
[1:13:12] they tried to glorify the men of God
[1:13:14] they turned them back to Jesus we didn't
[1:13:19] do nothing
[1:13:20] remember they even tried to worship Him
[1:13:23] says no no no I don't want that this
[1:13:27] belong to Jesus Christ it is he who has
[1:13:30] done these miracles is that what I
[1:13:34] probably did he did the same thing he
[1:13:38] said come in sister
[1:13:39] he said ah I wish I could heal you he
[1:13:41] said but I can't do nothing said he's
[1:13:44] the one that heals hallelujah he said
[1:13:48] and many times oh if I could heal
[1:13:50] everybody in this building I would do it
[1:13:52] he said but I can't do it he has to do
[1:13:56] it is that right
[1:13:57] he said even Jesus he said Jesus himself
[1:14:00] never healed one person when I first
[1:14:04] heard that I'm like world he says right
[1:14:06] he said jesus said I can do nothing
[1:14:09] except I see the father do it teach so
[1:14:13] we must understand people though we are
[1:14:15] the house of God that our power in our
[1:14:18] authority is in the name of the Lord
[1:14:21] Jesus Christ don't come with no new name
[1:14:27] that he's got some kind of new me that
[1:14:30] will be given but the Bible says neither
[1:14:32] is there salvation under heaven there's
[1:14:36] no salvation in any other name under
[1:14:38] heaven except the name Jesus Christ and
[1:14:42] as long as we under heaven that's his
[1:14:45] name he can't change it it's his name
[1:14:51] people said well you know the seals open
[1:14:54] and he gave himself a new name well if
[1:14:56] he did you wouldn't know it and if he
[1:14:57] did like brother man who said if you
[1:14:58] knew the new name you wouldn't be able
[1:15:00] to tell it so somebody said well I know
[1:15:03] his new name you say you liar
[1:15:05] what is it they tell you a name you know
[1:15:08] the line but thou are great and doing
[1:15:18] wondrous things thou art God alone teach
[1:15:22] me thy way O God O Lord I will walk in
[1:15:26] that truth unite my heart to fear what
[1:15:29] thy name don't use his name around me
[1:15:32] loosely I feel that name because the
[1:15:36] name of Jesus Christ is not some sound
[1:15:39] it scary its power its eternal y'all
[1:15:47] hearing saying Amen it is it's amazing
[1:15:49] that he will allow
[1:15:51] although lips to say his name teach me
[1:15:59] that way or Lord I will walk in that
[1:16:01] truth unite my heart to fear thy name I
[1:16:03] will praise thee O Lord my God with all
[1:16:06] my heart and will I will glorify the
[1:16:08] name forevermore
[1:16:10] hi Steve a saying of thy name thy name
[1:16:12] thy name thy name you know he had a
[1:16:18] seven redemptive days and all those
[1:16:22] names according to the Prophet God was
[1:16:24] in that one name Jesus
[1:16:26] think about it folks here he was yeah ha
[1:16:30] ha Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide
[1:16:33] Jehovah Rapha our healer Jehovah Shalom

[1:16:42] shepherd Joe over some our Lord is
[1:16:45] present and you know Joe over tsking
[1:16:47] it's all through the word and when you
[1:16:49] call it Jesus you get a seven fold a
[1:16:55] Sevenfold power that comes in that name
[1:16:58] the devil can't escape it there's no
[1:17:01] hiding place when you're calling the
[1:17:04] name of Jesus is that right now listen
[1:17:07] I'm gonna say it like this if the whole
[1:17:08] heaven the family of God is named after
[1:17:10] Jesus
[1:17:11] can you imagine you in a situation you
[1:17:14] can't see what's going on in beyond the
[1:17:17] veil but the proper God comes along he
[1:17:19] says now he said I get Hades off oh you
[1:17:23] know was he largest servant he said
[1:17:24] whatever his name was but you know he
[1:17:27] you know what I'm saying and then he
[1:17:28] says Lord open up my servants eyes he
[1:17:34] did watch him n Chariots of Fire
[1:17:38] encompassing them and he like had
[1:17:41] already told him listen don't you
[1:17:43] understand he meant there more of them
[1:17:45] more of us than them if that was
[1:17:50] yesterday it is the day
[1:17:54] and a host of angels encompass one man
[1:18:00] and the purpose at the age of the Lord

[1:18:34] never lose sight of the name of Jesus
[1:18:37] Christ because if Jesus said oh one
[1:18:42] would come in another's name and you
[1:18:44] will receive it but when I come in my
[1:18:46] name you won't receive me brother Bantam
[1:18:50] goes in the blasphemous name he says all

[1:19:20] rehearsal if I would have been in there
[1:19:22] in the rehearsal I would like you got to
[1:19:24] get somebody else to marry you because I
[1:19:25] marrying you without a veil that's the
[1:19:29] word why is it important for the Veil
[1:19:32] the veil is symbolic of you losing your
[1:19:37] headship women sisters is that Alright
[1:19:43] when you put that veil over your head

[1:20:31] what I've been not sick sometime them
[1:20:35] next get still you and I must understand
[1:20:43] when our husband and wives work together
[1:20:45] Satan's afraid of you Satan is afraid of
[1:20:50] you when there's unity in the house he
[1:20:55] knows that a wife and a husband when
[1:20:57] they don't want Accord they are dynamite
[1:21:00] he's afraid of you because he knows that
[1:21:04] you can accomplish so much more being on
[1:21:07] one Accord a house divided can't stand
[1:21:10] he can come in and he can conquer you
[1:21:12] but when that wife stands by her husband

[1:23:50] would he be able to do he couldn't do
[1:23:55] nothing until I showed him I'm the one

[1:24:38] thing about you and Elysa you come to
[1:24:41] marry me you understand me
[1:24:44] let's see people don't understand God

[1:24:50] your wife came home she's working with
[1:24:52] somebody of something she'd come home
[1:24:54] talking about him all the time you might
[1:24:57] fight it awhile but a little jealousy
[1:25:01] going to rise up and say wait a min hold
[1:25:03] it I don't know what's going on but if
[1:25:08] you don't stop calling on that name
[1:25:09] you're gonna have to find another job
[1:25:12] I'm coming up and seeing who this guy is
[1:25:16] now if you love her you gonna do that
[1:25:22] know your wife don't talk about northern
[1:25:25] man but you that way
[1:25:33] that's okay so you got to understand God
[1:25:36] the same way right you got a call on the
[1:25:40] name of the Lord Shiva you've got to
[1:25:42] give honor where honor to that is where
[1:25:44] the revival is that's where it starts
[1:25:47] that's where it ends is that right when
[1:25:50] the Holy Ghost came down amen and an
[1:25:52] infant in them Peter went through all
[1:25:55] history talking about the page arrives
[1:25:57] and all of this thing
[1:25:58] but at the wall he said this is that and
[1:26:02] he preached Jesus you know there's so
[1:26:11] many people in this message that don't
[1:26:13] even know nothing about Calvary they
[1:26:16] can't explain how Kihara got saved what
[1:26:21] the blood of Jesus means to them
[1:26:25] hallelujah and it's nothing wrong with
[1:26:28] I'm not trying to take anything from the
[1:26:30] Prophet or Paul or Peter John or
[1:26:32] anything all of them did what they were
[1:26:34] supposed to do but folks understand they
[1:26:38] were in his head he wasn't in theirs he
[1:26:46] understand me the cell
[1:26:48] stars was in here in the right hand of
[1:26:50] him him who Jesus if I'm making sense he
[1:26:57] held them in his hand so what he was a
[1:26:59] he was doing the work he was the one
[1:27:01] creating he was the one that opened the
[1:27:03] eyes of the blind he we who Jesus Christ
[1:27:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:27:10] brother Branham was a man who came that
[1:27:14] God used to declare that means to make
[1:27:17] you know to emphasize that he's the same
[1:27:20] yesterday today and forever we do him
[1:27:26] injustice sometimes because he wouldn't
[1:27:30] have it the way we do it sometimes you
[1:27:35] love the Lord as to 36 and 39 says
[1:27:39] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:27:41] know assuredly that God had made the
[1:27:42] same Jesus whom you have crucified both
[1:27:44] Lord and Christ now when they heard this
[1:27:47] they were pricked in their heart and
[1:27:48] said unto Peter and the rest of the
[1:27:50] Apostles men and brethren what shall we
[1:27:52] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[1:27:55] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:27:57] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:27:58] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:28:00] of the Holy Ghost for the promise is
[1:28:02] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:28:04] them afar off even as many as the Lord
[1:28:07] our God shall call who that name can
[1:28:12] never stop it will never die y'all hear
[1:28:16] what I'm sayin so let me say it like
[1:28:18] this you know how people say the voice
[1:28:20] of the rock are the voice of the
[1:28:23] Resurrection is in the bride you've
[1:28:25] heard that you've heard people say well
[1:28:27] people gonna one day get go by the
[1:28:29] gravesites I don't know whether you
[1:28:30] heard that and call people up don't
[1:28:32] believe that that's not true that's
[1:28:35] error the voice of the
[1:28:40] Archangel is the holy ghost the voice of
[1:28:44] the bridegroom is the holy ghost
[1:28:48] hallelujah and because you got it in you
[1:28:51] you'll be able to hear him
[1:28:53] he alone stood out at the grave and said
[1:28:57] Lazarus come forth he alone and because
[1:29:03] Lazarus was a seed of God he heard the
[1:29:06] voice you know you got to understand
[1:29:14] that how people twist this message and
[1:29:16] when they do they get a bad crop of
[1:29:20] stuff right so you say well what do you
[1:29:23] mean brother so I want you to understand
[1:29:25] people that their take brother branham's
[1:29:27] quote and their twist it to me something
[1:29:30] like it's a deep revelation but
[1:29:32] understand everything must go back here
[1:29:34] it must strike the Urim of tharam is
[1:29:38] that right brother branham said it
[1:29:40] himself when the angel came to me he
[1:29:44] would tell me anything I'll go back to
[1:29:46] this book am I making sense see what it
[1:29:52] is you don't want to take nothing away
[1:29:54] from the Lord Jesus Christ did you know
[1:29:58] that the Word of God is perfect the
[1:30:01] Bible said is so perfect you can try it
[1:30:03] if you like it's tried but let me tell
[1:30:08] you something there's no failure in this
[1:30:10] word listen everything that the prophet
[1:30:15] of God preached about Jesus Jesus
[1:30:18] vindicated it that's how you and I know
[1:30:22] it was Jesus Christ he was preaching and
[1:30:24] he's Jesus Christ who was doing it and
[1:30:27] then because he vindicated it when he
[1:30:31] told about that pillar fire above his
[1:30:33] head they didn't want to believe it and
[1:30:35] one day Jesus himself came down it took
[1:30:41] a picture right so you know it is warm
[1:30:45] in here and I know y'all fighting that
[1:30:46] sleep hallelujah hey man I'm just trying
[1:30:50] to help I'm not gonna be long but my
[1:30:52] opponents
[1:30:53] amen when we look at this thing we see
[1:30:55] even by the grace of God that the name
[1:30:57] of Jesus every knee shall bow every
[1:30:59] tongue shall confess so you say well
[1:31:01] what do you mean by that just name know
[1:31:03] everything named when Adam named those
[1:31:07] animals in the garden there was a
[1:31:09] certain characteristics but the
[1:31:11] characteristics of the animal is what
[1:31:14] gave Adam the name when he said hog that
[1:31:18] Hall was the kind of animal a man that
[1:31:21] he slop in all kind of stuff now he knew
[1:31:24] that that animal was gonna eat slop when
[1:31:27] that Elmer at that time more than likely
[1:31:28] had never eaten slop before because
[1:31:29] there was nothing dying but he knew and
[1:31:34] when he called that thing a dog wad over
[1:31:38] and you know dogs are so cute some of
[1:31:41] them I don't like that I don't care for
[1:31:43] the sloppy can but you know the ones
[1:31:45] that are really cute you know you you
[1:31:51] know look and you think sometime they so
[1:31:53] smart you say they should have been
[1:31:54] human my lady sheep she catch attitudes
[1:32:02] and everything especially Tom if I come
[1:32:04] home and I'm she's jumping and jumping
[1:32:06] and I'm ignoring her because I'm busy
[1:32:07] she said to herself you can see it in
[1:32:10] eyes I get you back that next day I come
[1:32:13] home and she won't move she might even
[1:32:17] stand up and turn our back but it's
[1:32:25] something about the dog you know what I
[1:32:27] mean I don't have preached on that
[1:32:28] because I do have a love for dogs you
[1:32:31] know you look at that thing and God
[1:32:33] calls us Gentile dogs we have our bad
[1:32:36] habits but we know how to worship the
[1:32:38] master hallelujah we may go back and
[1:32:43] turn like a hog to the slop but we know
[1:32:47] our master amen you love the Lord
[1:32:53] listen jesus answered according to John
[1:32:56] 12 saying they always come that the son
[1:32:58] of man should be glorified verily verily
[1:33:00] I say unto you except a corn of wheat
[1:33:03] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:33:05] alone
[1:33:06] but it if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:33:09] fruit he that loveth his life shall lose
[1:33:12] it and he that hated his life in this
[1:33:14] world shall keep it unto life eternal If
[1:33:17] any man served me let him follow me
[1:33:20] where I am there shall also my servant
[1:33:23] be If any man serve me him will my
[1:33:27] father on earth the understand me if you
[1:33:30] serve Jesus Christ let me put it this
[1:33:33] way
[1:33:33] God will vindicate you but it must be
[1:33:40] Jesus Christ who you're following
[1:33:45] hallelujah now in my so troubled and
[1:33:48] what shall I say father save me from
[1:33:51] this hour but for this cause came I unto
[1:33:55] this hour that's why I love God hosting
[1:33:58] now he's telling you he says Lord save
[1:34:00] me from this hour but it was for this
[1:34:04] cause I came into this this hour this
[1:34:07] world I was born to be the Lamb of God I
[1:34:10] was born to suffer for mankind and I and
[1:34:15] even though my flesh don't want to do it
[1:34:16] let your will be done
[1:34:18] see that's the bride of Jesus right it's
[1:34:20] not that every time God asked you to do
[1:34:22] something or praise the Lord I want to
[1:34:24] do it no there's going to be times you
[1:34:27] don't want to do it but he still know
[1:34:31] you will because it is you to humble
[1:34:34] yourself oh it's the truth you know
[1:34:41] Jonah was rebellious
[1:34:42] I'm not going my fact this is time for
[1:34:47] me to take a holiday and I'm skipping
[1:34:49] town I'm going down there with the
[1:34:54] yacht's are nice
[1:34:55] he gets on the boat not knowing he's in
[1:35:00] the will of God you can't run from him
[1:35:03] folks
[1:35:04] see God he knows how to wake he does
[1:35:06] things where you think you running into
[1:35:08] the air you're getting right where I
[1:35:09] want you right oh that's the truth he
[1:35:13] didn't know how else to get Moses out of
[1:35:15] Egypt how I'm gonna get Moses out of
[1:35:17] Egypt and I'm over here on that mountain
[1:35:21] inspires Moses I'm a leader I'm a leader
[1:35:24] and then all of a sudden that same zeal
[1:35:26] calls him to kill an Egyptian he gets
[1:35:30] kicked out of Egypt and now he's gonna
[1:35:31] end up where right where God wants him
[1:35:34] to be see look and sometimes that's why
[1:35:38] it's not so good to judge people or
[1:35:40] judge their lives too early you don't
[1:35:43] know what God is doing you don't know
[1:35:52] you know you can see it but you don't
[1:35:54] see a prostitute on the street and you
[1:35:56] might think she's going to hell you know
[1:35:58] she might even help tattoos all the way
[1:36:00] up to her skull but you don't know
[1:36:02] what's on the inside
[1:36:04] don't let see that's the devil right
[1:36:07] there right that's the devil even trying
[1:36:09] to make you fear or hate that so you
[1:36:12] won't given the gospel given the gospel
[1:36:16] because the reason why people do that
[1:36:18] kind of stuff is they want attention is
[1:36:24] that true oh i'ma tell you the truth
[1:36:26] most women that literally dress if
[1:36:29] you're Fame like only wants attention
[1:36:32] somewhere they like love somewhere and
[1:36:35] they'll do whatever they can do to get a
[1:36:38] little bit of tension right it's just
[1:36:40] that little childish thing that comes
[1:36:42] out of us sometime
[1:36:43] right it's that's right like most
[1:36:46] children most children if they're not
[1:36:48] getting attention they would rather get
[1:36:49] a beatin they wanna beat least mama no
[1:36:53] daddy no he spared me of some attention
[1:36:58] but that ain't the way God wants you to
[1:37:01] be anyway let me move on we're too here
[1:37:03] to glorify His name I've got to hurry
[1:37:06] glorify it means to reverence and
[1:37:09] respect it means to cause to be or treat
[1:37:11] as being most splendid excellent etc
[1:37:14] then would normally be considered to
[1:37:17] honor it praise admiration or worship
[1:37:19] extol to make glorious investment Lord -
[1:37:23] praise the glory of God especially as an
[1:37:26] act of worship
[1:37:29] he understand me so when you say Jesus
[1:37:33] you're not saying it in a common way put
[1:37:36] some love in it put some love in and so
[1:37:39] people can know there's love coming
[1:37:41] through that Jesus huh
[1:37:43] you know and that's what God knows when
[1:37:45] when you working in a just casual you
[1:37:48] know I'm saying you know it's the way
[1:37:50] y'all women know you my wife could say
[1:37:53] we call I call her sister Ruby or
[1:37:55] something and she sister Brooks and she
[1:37:56] called me brother Brooks but sometime
[1:37:58] it's the tone the way she called me when
[1:38:00] I know I know what she won't and she
[1:38:03] says in in a certain way I'm like oh man
[1:38:05] what did I do wrong but then there's
[1:38:09] another way she can say it you know to
[1:38:12] me you know she put some love in it and
[1:38:21] that's audience with Jesus you supposed
[1:38:23] to put some love in it don't make him
[1:38:25] your errand boy you put some love in it
[1:38:29] let me let me say it like this remember
[1:38:32] when David was going to go down there
[1:38:34] and kill what's-his-name the one
[1:38:39] that fool neighbor neighbor huh neighbor
[1:38:42] right
[1:38:43] his name was food yes wouldn't anyway
[1:38:48] and Abigail comes out and said don't you
[1:38:50] know his name is food but what did she
[1:38:55] do she put love so much love it caught
[1:38:59] Davis attention Oh David
[1:39:01] we know you a mighty man we don't heard
[1:39:05] of your reputation
[1:39:06] y'all him say huh me oh she didn't even
[1:39:09] say it like this but she come said you
[1:39:11] know I got all your photos up on the
[1:39:13] wall no she did say like that but she
[1:39:16] put so much love in it
[1:39:18] that she sincerely cared for him now she
[1:39:23] didn't push the husband aside you know
[1:39:25] his name neighbor his knees that means
[1:39:27] he's a food but you date it don't fall
[1:39:33] in the same trap God to get him but
[1:39:37] David you don't want God to get you
[1:39:39] because you didn't have a lot of blood
[1:39:40] on your hand you don't want to do this
[1:39:41] and your anger you know what who said
[1:39:43] she worked it she worked it and then she
[1:39:45] topped it off with
[1:39:46] oh just to prove to you that I mean when
[1:39:52] I say David said I'm coming back for you
[1:39:58] you ever them say see you gotta realize
[1:40:01] these things are set in the scripture so
[1:40:03] we'll know how to approach God with
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:07] troubles in the house you don't your
[1:40:09] troubles in your home or troubles in
[1:40:11] your life you don't approach God like
[1:40:12] he's an Arab I love I just need you to
[1:40:15] do that no you need to love on him for a
[1:40:17] while
[1:40:17] god I just so thank you Lord you're so
[1:40:20] wonderful to me and God you done did
[1:40:22] this now give him a testimony service
[1:40:25] and lord I know if you did that
[1:40:28] yesterday you can do it for me today
[1:40:29] father God you know I love you I feel
[1:40:33] like God now you can't deal with that
[1:40:34] you say Oh what all whether you won't
[1:40:37] right that's what David said is that
[1:40:40] right I'm sorry
[1:40:41] that's what King uh a steward said to
[1:40:43] Esther when Esther then put all ice
[1:40:44] cream in the cake out stuff like that he
[1:40:46] said you can have the half of my king
[1:40:49] see that is the effect God trying to
[1:40:53] tell us the effect we have on him with
[1:40:56] the right approach those things are not
[1:41:00] just setting in the Bible for you to
[1:41:01] like a Cinderella story is there to help
[1:41:05] you understand God's Way of thinking hmm
[1:41:14] John 12 I'm almost done you just with
[1:41:17] this segment I wish I anyway he says now
[1:41:20] is the judgment of this world
[1:41:21] now shall the prince of this world be
[1:41:23] cast out and I if I be lifted up from
[1:41:27] the earth will draw all men unto me then
[1:41:30] he said signifying what death he should
[1:41:33] die do you believe that the Bible said
[1:41:36] if you lift him up
[1:41:38] if you lift up the name of Jesus he
[1:41:42] would draw all men unto Him you don't
[1:41:47] even have to preach a whole sermon to
[1:41:49] somebody you just tell them let me yeah
[1:41:51] can I just give you a testimony
[1:41:54] let me tell you something what God did
[1:41:57] for me today the Lord Jesus did this for
[1:41:59] me today
[1:42:00] you'll be surprised and how many people
[1:42:02] want to hear something some good news
[1:42:04] everything they're getting nowadays bad
[1:42:07] news and you can tell them right now
[1:42:09] this is the season to talk to them about
[1:42:12] Jesus and you know you don't need
[1:42:14] nothing well I mean the message and I'm
[1:42:17] following the message of william branham
[1:42:19] that will come that will come but get
[1:42:24] their attention with Calvary with Jesus
[1:42:27] I'll let them know that God is already
[1:42:29] died for you how many of y'all we have a
[1:42:33] witness like that you understand what
[1:42:35] I'm saying
[1:42:36] and I'm not saying you know you don't
[1:42:37] leave you can't leave Malachi 4 out he's
[1:42:40] part of the word
[1:42:41] but my point is you don't stop with him
[1:42:45] that's what John said don't stop with me
[1:42:49] I'm not even worthy to unloose his
[1:42:51] latches there's one coming after me I'm
[1:42:54] pointing you to the direction in the
[1:42:55] direction you should we go after you
[1:42:58] leave me even the Prophet God said I
[1:43:01] must decrease and he must increase he
[1:43:04] pointed us he's the only one you know
[1:43:07] Billy Graham couldn't do it all robbers
[1:43:08] couldn't do it none of them folks
[1:43:10] Kenneth Hagin none of them could direct
[1:43:12] us to the truth Jesus Christ
[1:43:14] it was Malachi 4 because he was a
[1:43:16] prophet God revealed to him the real
[1:43:19] Jesus in a deceiving age like this so we
[1:43:26] got the real deal so therefore we should
[1:43:29] have the real results yes you understand
[1:43:37] me even even the Prophet God tried to
[1:43:38] live weaning the people off of him at
[1:43:40] time y'all remember that remember that
[1:43:43] lady who had already pray for that baby
[1:43:46] she had pray for and God had already
[1:43:48] healed the baby the Holy Spirit talking
[1:43:51] to the lady you go pray for right and
[1:43:54] then when brother Branham gets up there
[1:43:56] he says because she felt unworthy why
[1:43:58] should I pray for him when the prophet
[1:43:59] of God is here hello and God using you
[1:44:05] and he using him he is a property to
[1:44:08] make your property but God using you go
[1:44:11] pray we are party
[1:44:14] people that's what people don't
[1:44:15] understand we are body when brother
[1:44:17] Bantam got up there he said you already
[1:44:19] healed your baby's already delivered
[1:44:21] that lady up in the bathroom with that
[1:44:23] funny whatever dress that was she pray
[1:44:25] for you it was at that time God healed
[1:44:27] you he said minister pastors you have
[1:44:33] the same Authority I have you can pray
[1:44:36] for the sick you can lay hands and pray
[1:44:39] for the sick so he was trying to get the
[1:44:43] people not to make it a one-man army
[1:44:45] this is a body hallelujah is this okay
[1:44:52] but we all do it by the same authority
[1:44:55] whose authority what daughter you get
[1:44:58] what school did you come from I come
[1:44:59] from me ology school of the saints
[1:45:06] hallelujah but what is your what is your
[1:45:09] degree my degree is a HGT degree Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost degree hallelujah
[1:45:16] yeah I guess what I graduated with
[1:45:19] honors I have the right to preach the
[1:45:24] name of Jesus right oh come on somebody
[1:45:27] it's the name of Jesus Christ the devil
[1:45:30] is trying to get the church to lose
[1:45:32] sight oh right
[1:45:36] I think it's the Methodist Church they
[1:45:38] put out the books no longer do they sing
[1:45:40] about the blood how long has it been
[1:45:42] you've heard songs on the blood of Jesus
[1:45:46] Christ you remove the blood of Jesus you
[1:45:51] ain't got nothing it's just okay you
[1:45:56] know I want people to understand there
[1:45:58] is a balance to it you know I've heard
[1:46:00] people and I myself I've come you know
[1:46:02] you know and people misunderstand
[1:46:04] because you you you you saying things
[1:46:06] about William Branham and you don't
[1:46:07] understand we're not trying to take away
[1:46:09] from the matter what God did for him
[1:46:11] that fact I can't Holly wait to me he's
[1:46:14] he's I can't explain it all I know is
[1:46:16] that in my life he's second in line with
[1:46:19] Jesus
[1:46:25] you don't have to say it that way but I
[1:46:26] know I know one thing I want to see he
[1:46:29] and God gone granted that I would see
[1:46:32] him before I see him right I'm gonna see
[1:46:36] William Branham before I see Jesus you
[1:46:39] say oh that's not right yes it is that
[1:46:41] that resurrection brother Branham said
[1:46:43] there'll be waves
[1:46:46] he said Ephesus - get up Smyrna get up
[1:46:52] he said I'd be wave after wave after
[1:46:55] wave your leader yo William Branham
[1:46:59] would get up with this bride age did you
[1:47:05] all know that he said because he's got
[1:47:07] to stand with his people like Paul
[1:47:09] Stewart here so we don't all get up at
[1:47:14] the same time it's a wave of the Holy
[1:47:17] Ghost if you've ever been in a service
[1:47:18] like that you know what I'm talking
[1:47:20] about
[1:47:20] that's old-time services I hadn't seen
[1:47:22] one of them I guess that we had one up
[1:47:24] there and I'm in the women's retreat but
[1:47:26] I missed out on the day were telling me
[1:47:28] about it how that way came in there and
[1:47:30] God feel the people all of a sudden they
[1:47:32] thought it was quieting down here come
[1:47:33] the way McKee going to God I remember
[1:47:38] those times amen mm-hmm I can find your
[1:47:43] quote where he said the other night did
[1:47:45] when I was preaching in I win
[1:47:47] the church is flooded our church that
[1:47:49] anointing mm-hmm see God knows what he's
[1:47:58] doing right and then we'll meet Jesus in
[1:48:02] the end we meet everybody else here but
[1:48:06] we meet Jesus Christ in the air hmm is
[1:48:10] that the Bible all right okay you love
[1:48:12] the Lord now my point is sisters when I
[1:48:15] had that thing on my head you are giving
[1:48:18] over our sisters and brothers we're
[1:48:20] giving our authority over to Jesus
[1:48:22] Christ right now it's a modern day thing
[1:48:24] where people don't want to take their
[1:48:26] husband's name why do you think David
[1:48:28] the devil did that he's trying to break
[1:48:32] down the Bible like it means nothing but
[1:48:35] sister when a man gives you his name you
[1:48:38] supposed a hole that
[1:48:39] in reverence and respect you know uh if
[1:48:43] my wife was here she would say I want
[1:48:45] you to know that I am sister Isiah Bruce
[1:48:50] she believes Ruby out because that's the
[1:48:55] way it used to be you just took his name
[1:48:59] of course you kept your name on the
[1:49:00] birth certificate but when it came to
[1:49:03] addressing you were sister Isiah Brooks
[1:49:06] or whatever your husband's name wow
[1:49:08] that's that's the way I knew it and you
[1:49:12] know what you was a proud of it if he
[1:49:15] was a drunk he was still proud of it
[1:49:18] right it's just the way it is so anyway
[1:49:22] we look at the same and women don't want
[1:49:23] to give it up no more this woman this
[1:49:26] American spirit is anointing all kinds
[1:49:29] of folks yeah you know they don't even
[1:49:33] want to say you know obey your husband
[1:49:36] obey you better earn that if he won't
[1:49:41] meet you obey you know what but you know
[1:49:47] what a man i'ma tell you brothers you
[1:49:50] know when you love your wives you can
[1:49:51] get her to a place where she will and it
[1:49:53] will be out of love and not not because
[1:49:55] it's a commandment you won't even have
[1:49:58] to ask her to do nothing she'll be jump
[1:50:00] into it because she loves you so much oh
[1:50:02] I know y'all like that aren't you I'm
[1:50:07] just teasing you now I'm working with
[1:50:09] you but my point is something to work
[1:50:12] toward right now husband y'all know you
[1:50:14] got to be good husbands to that's what
[1:50:18] you ought to be but every time I think
[1:50:20] about that kind of a thing I think about
[1:50:21] that woman who had a husband who was an
[1:50:23] alcoholic and she was a Christian yeah I
[1:50:27] love that story here's this boy down
[1:50:29] there with his boys and you know they're
[1:50:31] talking hollering well you know I just
[1:50:33] don't believe in Christianity because

[1:51:23] floor right yeah no she didn't say that
[1:51:27] she fell down and she says must Jesus
[1:51:31] bear the cross alone and all the world
[1:51:35] go free when those guys saw that woman
[1:51:39] acting in the inspiration of the word it
[1:51:43] convicted them and they got saved huh
[1:51:49] she is that like people will see they do
[1:51:53] billion don't mean nothing everybody's
[1:51:55] rebellion but when they see humility

[1:52:00] life somebody might say you're stupid
[1:52:02] but they're gonna be somebody said wow
[1:52:04] that's powerful that's powerful whatever
[1:52:08] that is I want some of that right oh
[1:52:11] yeah I didn't have the Holy Ghost at
[1:52:13] first but I saw them people jumping and
[1:52:15] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[1:52:16] running I said oh god I ain't got it
[1:52:19] like that before I know the fire came on
[1:52:23] me and I were out there dancing like I
[1:52:24] ain't never danced before and it didn't
[1:52:29] stop there
[1:52:31] God had already told me my mother had
[1:52:34] the Holy Ghost and she told me she says
[1:52:35] she said and my mother couldn't read or
[1:52:37] write but she said junior before she
[1:52:39] died she said God garden gonna leave you
[1:52:41] at that church she said God gonna bring
[1:52:43] you to a greater light she said you wait
[1:52:46] now don't go nowhere she says go be
[1:52:48] times it's gonna be hard at this church
[1:52:49] but you wait
[1:52:51] cuz God gonna send you a greater light
[1:52:53] and out of all the Apostolic churches in
[1:52:56] Columbia South Carolina
[1:52:58] God sent some people at my church who
[1:53:01] knew the message
[1:53:03] I waited and when God gave me your
[1:53:07] understanding I was there at a picnic
[1:53:09] when I heard his voice again he said
[1:53:11] this is the thing that your mama talk to
[1:53:13] you about this is that greater life see
[1:53:16] nobody can take this from me I don't
[1:53:20] care what the world say I don't care
[1:53:23] what these people in the message doing
[1:53:25] and all they doing and saying I'm
[1:53:26] telling you right now this message is of
[1:53:29] God and everything is promised it's
[1:53:33] going to bring to pass you don't have to
[1:53:36] wrestle with it
[1:53:37] it will live its way through you
[1:53:40] hallelujah I know it's true I've had
[1:53:47] experiences that don't ask me why I
[1:53:48] don't know why God give me all these
[1:53:50] experiences but it sometimes make me
[1:53:51] afraid because you know I said Lord
[1:53:53] Israel had all these experiences and
[1:53:55] they were lost I'm gonna be like that
[1:53:57] make me dumb I'd rather not have nothing
[1:53:59] and know that I'm saving gonna be
[1:54:00] raptured then they have all this stuff
[1:54:02] you know to me but God said yet and
[1:54:04] still they were still with Joshua and
[1:54:05] Caleb I said yes no thank you
[1:54:08] they saw it and they crossed over
[1:54:11] Amen you love the Lord but it's the name
[1:54:14] of Jesus listen how many of us are
[1:54:17] willing to get thrown in jail you know
[1:54:19] one of the things in our me that really
[1:54:22] inspired me on this message because you
[1:54:25] remember in Las Vegas where all those
[1:54:27] people got killed there a couple of
[1:54:28] weeks ago and you saw in the you to
[1:54:30] where these preachers were preaching
[1:54:32] warning them not to go into the concert
[1:54:34] did you all see that and all I could
[1:54:36] think about was Noah in the ark and they
[1:54:39] were making fun at the man getting all
[1:54:41] up in his face
[1:54:42] he wasn't afraid he told him and these
[1:54:45] were people who were Christian or call
[1:54:46] them so he said this one man was stupid
[1:54:48] drunk and he's drunk he's a beloved
[1:54:51] Christian I'm serious I'm a Christian
[1:54:52] and the man said well you can't be a
[1:54:53] Christian drinking and worshipping the
[1:54:55] devil like that but he didn't know maybe
[1:54:58] he belong to a denomination and he
[1:54:59] thought he was a Christian it wasn't
[1:55:01] wrong and sometimes I wonder because I
[1:55:04] said Lord was he one of the ones that
[1:55:05] got shot there were various ones women
[1:55:10] and men making mockery of the man not
[1:55:13] knowing that they were going into a
[1:55:14] chamber of death
[1:55:17] see God is faithful and if gotta use a
[1:55:20] street preacher like that
[1:55:21] what about us what about us warning
[1:55:28] before judgment none of those people
[1:55:30] they all thought they'd go come out of
[1:55:32] that place and they got in there and
[1:55:33] that man was running that gun like a
[1:55:35] machine gun and you know what they first
[1:55:37] thought it was firecrackers people
[1:55:42] people people see that's why I don't go
[1:55:44] in crowds they accept you going to the
[1:55:46] church you're going to the church I
[1:55:47] don't mind dying in there they couldn't
[1:55:48] come in there but more than likely they
[1:55:50] won't right we know they do it right
[1:55:53] right but I don't go nowhere
[1:55:55] my mom my wife and I you know she goes
[1:55:58] down to the farmers market I don't even
[1:55:59] go there no more I said cuz that's just
[1:56:01] the right place some devil inspired
[1:56:04] person is gonna come and start shooting
[1:56:06] up I'm not afraid to die but I don't
[1:56:09] need to go nowhere I don't need to go
[1:56:11] you might say where you leading a boring
[1:56:13] life I am my choice in Jesus I don't
[1:56:20] know I don't need all of the world extra
[1:56:22] current extra stuff I'm serious I really
[1:56:25] don't I don't need that whiskey they
[1:56:28] wine and nothing like that I don't need
[1:56:30] no party and banging and all that I
[1:56:31] don't need many times when I'm down
[1:56:35] that's all I could do is call on the
[1:56:37] name of Jesus I'm telling you I'm
[1:56:40] telling you you go home and practices
[1:56:42] sometimes just say Jesus Jesus Lord

[1:59:41] in fiction I don't know what it was but
[1:59:43] I know I looked in my mirror and I
[1:59:45] couldn't see the back of my throat so I
[1:59:46] got scared this is about three or four
[1:59:47] o'clock in the morning didn't want to

[1:59:53] not like me coming in there the shift
[1:59:55] and change and they by themselves and
[1:59:56] the doctor was upset and first of all
[2:00:00] they let's just let me wait in there and
[2:00:01] when he came in he had gotten a q-tip
[2:00:03] and he punching in the back he opened up
[2:00:06] car I mean just pain getting I'm like
[2:00:09] and then we finished I said oh I didn't

[2:00:14] mouth because I was in so much pain I
[2:00:15] said oh Jesus he said hold up I'm coming
[2:00:24] right back he went out the door probably
[2:00:27] asked God for forgiveness I don't know

[2:00:37] witnessing to him about the Lord Jesus
[2:00:39] Christ see the name of Jesus I stopped a
[2:00:42] devil right in the track see that power
[2:00:48] is in the name folks that's what I'm
[2:00:50] trying to tell you the devil that's your
[2:00:52] name that represents you you you when
[2:00:54] you say Jesus that's like a woman in
[2:00:57] distress calling her husband and if he's
[2:01:03] a good husband he's coming to your
[2:01:04] rescue
[2:01:05] right so when you look and you see the
[2:01:08] power of the name of Jesus Christ amen
[2:01:10] and understand Amen that everything is
[2:01:13] must bow hmm that's why I love Esther
[2:01:20] because Esther displayed her authority
[2:01:22] even when the King didn't understand
[2:01:24] what was going on Esther winning and she
[2:01:25] told Naaman and all of his family up a

[2:01:49] word or deed do it all in the name of
[2:01:50] the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and
[2:01:52] the Father by him
[2:01:55] huh that's God coming in vindicating you
[2:01:58] because you are using his name and he
[2:02:00] wants you to use it whatsoever you do in
[2:02:04] Word or in deed right giving thanks
[2:02:09] always for all things unto God and the
[2:02:11] father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:02:13] Christ

[2:02:18] another in the fear of God see in the
[2:02:22] name of Jesus you and I are order to
[2:02:24] submit ourselves one to Adani this is a
[2:02:29] body situation right amen you love a god
[2:02:33] got I've got a quote here and then I'm
[2:02:36] then I'm gonna let you go t we and I
[2:02:39] must understand that God means business
[2:02:43] and you know this is a love affair
[2:02:45] honestly I'm enjoying Jesus I really uh
[2:02:48] like I said this morning I enjoy being a
[2:02:50] Christian I have my problems like
[2:02:52] everybody else but my my whole goal I
[2:02:55] want I don't want to be just a Christian
[2:02:58] you understand what I'm saying
[2:02:59] I I want to make a difference I will
[2:03:03] garden you know he's like we sang today
[2:03:05] he knows my name well I want him I wanna
[2:03:09] you know I don't I just cannot stand
[2:03:11] going anywhere
[2:03:12] if a person is not knowing what I am I
[2:03:16] don't want them figuring out how I'll
[2:03:19] tell them and they can watch me if they
[2:03:21] want to right I'm a Christian I preached
[2:03:27] Jesus wherever I go when I go to the the
[2:03:30] stores and and all of that
[2:03:32] I've had people comment I wait sometimes
[2:03:33] I'll smile I speak to him and I just
[2:03:36] wait for that door to open and when it
[2:03:39] does guess who comes to the door goes
[2:03:41] out Jesus some people like it and some
[2:03:44] don't but I don't care I'm searching for
[2:03:47] my kind mmm that's what I'm looking for
[2:03:52] my kind amongst all this darkness I'm
[2:03:56] looking for my kind and that kind is the
[2:03:58] word kind
[2:04:00] hallelujah of the Lord and we don't look
[2:04:03] far more how we gonna fight we
[2:04:05] we're here commissioned to find the rest
[2:04:08] of our body the rest of our family lost
[2:04:11] in war somewhere amnesia or something
[2:04:14] we're here we're supposed to go look for
[2:04:17] them it's okay
[2:04:21] cheek in that church age book what
[2:04:25] brother Branham said God told him to
[2:04:26] take up this pin and write those pages
[2:04:28] are so precious precious to me that I
[2:04:30] cannot even explain to you where some
[2:04:33] people don't want to acknowledge it but
[2:04:35] the bride of Jesus Christ knows the
[2:04:37] voice of her bridegroom and when you
[2:04:41] hear that you know that had to come from
[2:04:42] God because no man could have made
[2:04:45] anything up like that up and I'm not
[2:04:47] going to read all of it but I read
[2:04:48] something to you because I want you to
[2:04:50] understand that God did such a unique
[2:04:52] job when it came to his plan of
[2:04:55] salvation it cannot be duplicated or
[2:04:57] copied it's so Pat and it's so right
[2:05:01] it's so rich and we look at this thing
[2:05:04] and says what if that she remaineth in
[2:05:05] you you cannot see sin and we just look
[2:05:08] but that is powerful that God put a seed
[2:05:12] in you and me and he said the best seed
[2:05:17] remaineth in you you cannot commit sin
[2:05:21] that means there is no way you can
[2:05:25] disbelieve unbelief is not a word in
[2:05:28] your category you know you know it's not
[2:05:32] it's not that and we're not talking
[2:05:34] about flesh we're talking about soul if
[2:05:37] that's so that's see in you has been
[2:05:40] quickened you that's God and you do and
[2:05:43] God cannot disbelieve its word that's
[2:05:47] that's why the Bible says meditate you
[2:05:49] know why it tells you to meditate
[2:05:50] because meditation takes you beyond your
[2:05:53] flesh beyond your spirit right into your
[2:05:56] soul and when you see what's in your
[2:06:00] soul that's where your power is that's
[2:06:03] your power right in the area right in it
[2:06:05] that's your power natural spirit that's
[2:06:08] soul riding there with Jesus live death
[2:06:11] that's where you are and that's the real
[2:06:14] you that's the real you
[2:06:19] this ain't you it's just an image of you
[2:06:22] and God's gonna tear this thing apart
[2:06:25] and rebuild it but the real you is
[2:06:30] inside that Holies alone is that's the
[2:06:32] real you the devil say look at what
[2:06:35] you've done
[2:06:36] Paul said I didn't do nothing he said
[2:06:38] that was my flesh that wasn't me
[2:06:39] I love Paul Paul knew how to shut the
[2:06:44] devil's mouth didn't he say he said that
[2:06:50] ain't me I didn't do that
[2:06:51] my flesh needed now here's what I'm
[2:06:55] trying to say to you the law of
[2:06:57] reproduction bring forth of its kind we
[2:07:02] should we read Genesis all those years
[2:07:04] we never would have really under the
[2:07:06] third the depth of it itself God sent
[2:07:08] Malakoff forward to us unfolding that
[2:07:10] word to us showing it and we saw it we
[2:07:12] knew it we didn't understand it
[2:07:14] corn brain for corn alpha brain for
[2:07:16] apples peaches peaches whatever now they
[2:07:18] just mix it all up and you know and you
[2:07:21] can't see it don't paint blue that
[2:07:26] harbored true good taste good anyway but
[2:07:29] it's dead
[2:07:31] come on now who in here don't like
[2:07:34] seedless grapes now I'm different
[2:07:40] because I like my watermelon with seeds
[2:07:42] for some reason seeds in the watermelon
[2:07:44] gives it a different taste and I like
[2:07:46] the idea of a spitting them out you know
[2:07:50] it's something about that you know boys
[2:07:52] you should love it let's see help me
[2:07:56] Jesus like I'm sorry I don't mean
[2:07:59] humorous but you know if it I still like
[2:08:02] that like I like my chicken and people
[2:08:04] you want you want a chicken basket only
[2:08:06] if it's got bone in it I don't like
[2:08:09] chicken with fillets I like my bone the
[2:08:12] bone gives it flavor
[2:08:19] and y'all know y'all not eating chicken
[2:08:21] right chicken is what God made she
[2:08:27] called is what the man is me it's hybrid
[2:08:33] ya hear what I'm saying you know what
[2:08:37] you go down in the country where they
[2:08:38] were they raising those those chickens
[2:08:40] and stuff like that you know and you
[2:08:42] know they aint got no all that funny
[2:08:44] stuff they don't put on them that's real
[2:08:45] chicken
[2:08:46] the real chicken the meaning is
[2:08:48] different colors that kind of chicken
[2:08:51] don't get on in between your teeth you
[2:08:54] got to work with that chicken that
[2:08:57] chicken
[2:08:58] the real chicken makes you tough that
[2:09:01] hybrid makes you saw well it'd be good
[2:09:06] y'all know it is fried up no but
[2:09:09] nevertheless it's not so good for you
[2:09:10] yeah let me move on Allah forgive me
[2:09:14] please I'm not trying to be humorous but
[2:09:17] let me read on the law of reproduction
[2:09:19] bring forth of this kind these last days
[2:09:22] true church bride comes through the air
[2:09:24] stone will be the super church super
[2:09:28] race me as it's near the head y'all
[2:09:31] don't heard it's a great head stone now
[2:09:32] how are you and I what will make us a
[2:09:37] super Church the super God did you know
[2:09:44] there's nothing to a bomb it was just a
[2:09:47] shell it's what's in the shell that is
[2:09:52] the power of the bomb a man without God
[2:09:55] ain't nothing but a shell but if you put
[2:09:59] God in him he's omnipotent he's
[2:10:04] all-powerful that's what I try to tell
[2:10:07] these kids I said don't y'all know y'all
[2:10:09] in the image of God you should never you
[2:10:12] dumb don't you know God don't like that
[2:10:13] God has never created a dumb child and I
[2:10:19] believe with all my heart every child
[2:10:21] has the ability of scoring a hundred if
[2:10:26] they want to and they can believe it it
[2:10:29] might take one child a little longer
[2:10:31] than the other
[2:10:32] but they still made in the image of God
[2:10:37] do you love the Lord I just believe it
[2:10:39] that way
[2:10:40] I don't believe in no stupid kid and all
[2:10:42] that no I don't sorry they might go
[2:10:45] through some trauma but these traumas
[2:10:46] they can be taken out of and be raised
[2:10:49] up in a normal way anyway I don't know
[2:10:52] why I said that but anyway let's move on
[2:10:53] so what they will be a church like so
[2:10:56] much like him even they would be in his
[2:10:59] very image in the order to be united
[2:11:02] with him they will be one they would be
[2:11:05] the very manifestation of word of the
[2:11:07] Living God
[2:11:07] listen denominations can never produce
[2:11:10] this see because you understand it's the
[2:11:12] seed it's what God put in you you're not
[2:11:16] doing it it's God in you doing it in
[2:11:20] other words God impersonate himself in
[2:11:23] you that's what he did he impersonated
[2:11:27] himself in the property impersonates
[2:11:28] himself in you the move is on the rise
[2:11:31] but what was the thing that you and I
[2:11:33] are failing to do with we're family to
[2:11:36] stay in the presence of the son because
[2:11:41] he said if we would be in the presence
[2:11:43] of the Sun we would be ripened in the
[2:11:48] world prayer right whatever it takes to
[2:11:53] stay in his presence that is what will
[2:11:55] bring us to maturity you love the Lord
[2:11:59] and then when you began to say things in
[2:12:02] the name of Jesus Christ it'll come to
[2:12:04] pass everything because you'll be
[2:12:09] inspired by him to do it just like God
[2:12:11] told me to bake by that lady's shoes she
[2:12:13] it was God I did it in the name of Jesus
[2:12:17] and I wanted to let that know that woman
[2:12:19] no I came in Jesus name you understand
[2:12:22] me I don't want to leave nothing God
[2:12:24] does I don't want nobody but he's a good
[2:12:27] man no no I'm not the good man the good
[2:12:30] man is a man who's inspired me to do the
[2:12:32] good thing you love the Lord God is good
[2:12:41] to us
[2:12:44] in the morning when I rise in the
[2:12:50] morning when I rise here in the morning
