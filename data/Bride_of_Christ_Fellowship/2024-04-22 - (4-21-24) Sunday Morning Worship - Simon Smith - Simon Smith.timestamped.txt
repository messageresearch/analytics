[0:00] poon that got that assembly started and
[0:03] we have do our did our best to remain a
[0:05] lighthouse there by God's grace in that
[0:08] uh little town
[0:12] there so and regarding that picture
[0:16] brother Jesse sent there that was a
[0:18] uh that was a hard thing for me to do I
[0:21] I um I'm just going to tell you be
[0:24] honest here obviously we always want to
[0:25] be honest but I want to tell you the
[0:27] backstory behind that
[0:30] uh in
[0:31] 2015 uh brother cam wanted me to get
[0:34] ordained and I turned him
[0:36] down and within a couple months my
[0:38] Apprentice died and I always felt like
[0:40] that was the Lord being angry with me
[0:44] and not bringing judgment to me so I've
[0:47] been kind of
[0:48] running uh from this uh maybe whatever
[0:52] this is uh calling or whatever you want
[0:55] to say uh so it was a very humbling
[0:59] thing to get up there
[1:01] and um do that knowing that that my
[1:06] apprentice's life could be the reason he
[1:08] lost it is because of me
[1:12] and uh my wife knows how many times I've
[1:14] wanted to get out of teaching the Bible
[1:17] and doing Bible studies and ministering
[1:19] here or there just uh because you don't
[1:21] feel called you don't feel uh worthy to
[1:24] do it and um it is a dangerous thing
[1:28] obviously we all we all will be judged
[1:30] on that the great day on what we do what
[1:32] we think what we say on uh how we act
[1:34] and those sort of things but saints of
[1:36] God then to the ministry it's now uh
[1:39] here we have to come here and try to
[1:40] find the very mind of God and what God
[1:42] places on your heart and then bring it
[1:44] forth to the wife and bride of Christ
[1:47] and that is a serious thing when you
[1:49] speak to the wife of God you want to be
[1:52] in a certain condition and say the right
[1:55] things so uh in that being said um let's
[2:00] see here I don't know if Sister Casa can
[2:03] get this going for me I hooked up on the
[2:05] other one uh not the not this one but on
[2:10] the other one we'll see but I have a uh
[2:13] PowerPoint by God's grace so this is a
[2:15] little thought that I was listening to a
[2:16] sermon I just jumped out at me and I
[2:18] want to kind of and it led me down a
[2:21] kind of a the same path but on a little
[2:24] side path there and I want to go this
[2:25] way by God's grace this morning and it's
[2:28] a simple study but I want you to to see
[2:30] what what we're up
[2:33] against what our loved ones are
[2:36] under and what we've been called out of
[2:40] so it's a very simple uh study but
[2:43] saints of God the power behind us and
[2:46] what we're fighting and what we're
[2:47] battling is
[2:49] uh maybe more than I even realized as
[2:53] far as the implications of what uh the
[2:57] devil has done in this day and in the
[2:59] age ages that have been before and the
[3:02] system the spiritual system that's been
[3:04] set up um uh to capture the souls of
[3:09] man so and there's so much more to this
[3:12] than we could even now say the
[3:14] see so if we could maybe we'll stand
[3:17] here by God's grace and go to uh the
[3:20] book of Ephesians
[3:24] 6 as my pastor there he he dived in he's
[3:27] kind of went off this topic recently and
[3:29] went into something just as
[3:31] marvelous U but here in Ephesians as we
[3:35] want to be Ephesians uh in this last day
[3:39] in Ephesians 6 vers uh verse
[3:42] 10 through
[3:47] 13 let me see if I can get there
[3:54] myself Ephesians
[3:56] 6 verse 10
[3:59] through 13 so let's say let's read the
[4:03] scripture here as we approach the king
[4:06] Our Savior our Lord as I heard the
[4:08] prophet say he says many people want him
[4:09] to be uh their God and savior but not
[4:13] many want him to be their lord his he
[4:15] wants uh we want him to be our lord of
[4:17] our lives and to rule and guide us and
[4:20] tell us what to do and be obedient to
[4:22] that that's our that's our hearts
[4:24] cry uh Ephesians 6 ver10 says finally my
[4:29] brethren be strong in the Lord and the
[4:31] power of His might put on the whole
[4:34] armor of God that you may be able to
[4:35] stand against the Ws of the devil and
[4:38] look at verse 12 for we wrestle not
[4:42] against flesh and
[4:44] blood he says uh but
[4:48] principalities and against Powers
[4:50] against the rulers of the darkness of
[4:52] this world against spiritual High
[4:53] wickedness in high places
[4:57] right wherefore take unto you the whole
[4:59] AR of God that you may be able to
[5:01] withstand in the evil day and having
[5:03] done all to
[5:08] stand let's say a word of
[5:12] prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you
[5:14] Lord God and Lord you've been more than
[5:16] wonderful to us Lord God and Lord as we
[5:18] see this day approaching Lord and we
[5:21] come together even the more the Bible
[5:23] says Lord because we're supposed to come
[5:25] together and assemble Lord at your house
[5:27] God it's a it's a commandment God it's
[5:29] it's not a suggestion
[5:31] Lord and Lord Jesus Lord we ask that you
[5:35] would Minister Lord to these people God
[5:37] lord lord all I can do is open my mouth
[5:38] Lord but I want your very thoughts and
[5:40] your minds Lord if you want me to get
[5:41] off this topic Lord and provide the very
[5:44] thoughts God lord for I believe Lord you
[5:46] dwell in US Lord God lord and we are
[5:47] your temples God lord and Lord God we
[5:50] want to clean we want to keep clean
[5:51] temples Lord just real Sanctified and
[5:54] set aside for you Lord and for your
[5:56] kingdom Lord that we could win souls
[5:58] Lord Lord even at this moment right here

[6:03] your to your bride here God lord and
[6:05] Lord we certainly love and appreciate
[6:07] Lord God and Lord I want as you loved us
[6:10] God lord we want our love to grow
[6:11] towards you more Lord God and more Lord
[6:15] Lord give each one Lord a double portion
[6:16] th Holy Ghost Lord be with us this
[6:18] morning Lord as we do our best Lord to
[6:20] yield to you Lord God in your spirit we
[6:23] love you bless the people God In The
[6:25] Name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[6:27] seated by God's grace
[6:38] well it's good to be back and um know
[6:41] the weird the strange thing of course is
[6:43] as soon as brother Jesse and brother cam
[6:46] uh ordained me into the ministry I've
[6:47] got two
[6:49] invitations I was gone two weeks ago to
[6:53] the Amish Church there in nvar and then
[6:56] I was then the week after that I was at
[6:58] Amish Church in or exus we say like the
[7:01] the Christian the new Christian Church
[7:02] in new uh Junction City and then here I
[7:05] am this week and then I get a break and
[7:07] then I go back to the church in Navar
[7:10] there uh so the Lord has put me in
[7:12] service uh and the beautiful thing it's
[7:15] all a small assembly so just tiny groups
[7:19] where I don't feel uncomfortable or
[7:21] however uh so we want to get into this
[7:23] thought here and uh I'll tell you what
[7:25] those uh the brothers there and both
[7:28] those uh assemblies in Nar and Junction
[7:32] City are wonderful Saints and I'm trying
[7:35] to bring whatever I get invitation the
[7:37] thoughts the I see what my the assembly
[7:40] I'm a part of at my home Church there
[7:42] the things we battle I try to encourage
[7:44] them and get them to watch out for these
[7:46] things so it doesn't take place in their
[7:49] assembly you know to warn as the the
[7:51] spirit of God always wants to warn then
[7:54] that's before judgment God always warns
[7:55] the people so we want to bring forth as
[7:59] far as a thought to them a way of seeing
[8:01] thing a different angle to uh give them
[8:04] to be aware that the devil is a roaring
[8:06] lion and he comes out to to kill kill uh
[8:09] kill steal and destroy the assembly he
[8:12] as my pastor one time did a study on
[8:13] sheep he says he know you the first
[8:16] indication of a sick sheep is uh uh the
[8:19] Sheep will separate itself from the
[8:21] assembly so that's what we want is we
[8:24] want to keep the people all together
[8:26] closer and closer drawing one with
[8:28] another so
[8:30] uh this morning I'd like to teach on by
[8:32] God's grace uh I want to speak on maybe
[8:34] the real war and with a subtopic of the
[8:39] Unseen um now getting back to the
[8:41] scripture notice here as we
[8:45] see he says the Bible in said in verse
[8:47] 12 he says for we wrestle not against
[8:49] flesh and blood so as we are Christians
[8:53] and we become Christians and we are
[8:55] standing as Christians the very Wars
[8:57] that we go through are not not between
[9:00] you and your brother you and your sister
[9:02] or anything like that though a friction
[9:04] may appear though though a disagreement
[9:07] or however whatever would take place
[9:09] before in the in the assembly between
[9:12] two individuals or three individuals or
[9:14] five individuals or if there's an
[9:15] uprising against the pastor or an
[9:17] uprising against the member of the
[9:18] assembly or however saints of God we do
[9:20] not wrestle against flesh and blood but
[9:23] the Bible declares here that it's
[9:25] against rulers of the darkness against
[9:27] Powers against principalities against
[9:29] Spirit sh wickedness in high places in
[9:31] other words what we see here in the
[9:33] natural is not the realest thing the
[9:36] greatest battle we have right now is in
[9:38] the spiritual realm oh Lord God if we
[9:40] could just Lord ask you this morning if
[9:42] you could open our eyes to a spiritual
[9:44] realm and see what is battling us what
[9:47] is fighting Us in this realm right in
[9:49] this room right now because there's two
[9:51] forces two Spirits Among Us right now
[9:54] and that is the Lord Jesus Christ the
[9:55] only true and living God and of course
[9:57] we have Satan his lowly de demons sure
[10:00] absolutely so those are the things that
[10:02] we battle those are the things that are
[10:04] affecting us right now I'll say like
[10:05] this many times when I was in Lima I'd
[10:07] get so tired in church that I would
[10:09] start falling asleep and as soon as uh
[10:11] our pastor there brother Brooks would
[10:12] say something he just say in such a way
[10:14] and it felt that that heaviness that
[10:16] tiredness would be lifted off and I'd be
[10:19] wide awake from there on so it shows me
[10:21] right there that was a tired Spirit a
[10:23] weary Spirit trying to get on me try to
[10:25] close my eyes take my mind off the
[10:27] scripture and get my mind to wander and
[10:29] shut down my flesh oh my so so so
[10:32] Spirits have power uh those those sort
[10:35] of things have a certain anointing to
[10:37] them as well and of course you know all
[10:39] those things by God's grace um uh so
[10:43] that is what we're fighting everything
[10:45] we see in the natural what is the
[10:46] Ukraine and Russia War those are two
[10:48] Spirits fighting right there is it the
[10:51] spirit of God and this one it could be
[10:52] two demons fighting right there because
[10:54] the Bible says what Satan's kingdom is
[10:57] divided sure there's no strength to it
[11:00] whatsoever he was already been conquered
[11:02] so they are already a weak people
[11:04] they're already weak uhh entities right
[11:06] there weak uh weaken their power
[11:08] according to the power of Christ sure
[11:10] and now we see Israel and now Hamas and
[11:12] Iran and all those sort of things what
[11:14] is what there's spirits that are doing
[11:16] those things right and of course God is
[11:18] in full control of it all amen sure we
[11:21] see something evil take place we know
[11:23] that's not the hand of God but God may
[11:25] have asked a spirit to come down and
[11:27] deceive or do this or do that why
[11:29] because God's word cannot come back void
[11:31] and it must everything must take place
[11:33] at a certain time at a specific people
[11:36] at a specific area as well so we know
[11:38] that God is in full control one thing
[11:40] for certain I was talking with a brother
[11:42] and he was uh bashing and and and of
[11:45] course it's easy to do our lovely
[11:47] present
[11:49] there if that's what you want to call
[11:51] him he's our president and he is our
[11:52] President Joe Biden right but now I said
[11:55] to the brother he he was kind of
[11:56] downplaying him which I which is it's
[12:00] not easy to it's yeah it's automatic so
[12:05] that's wow uh when you see Insanity what
[12:08] do you what do you do when you see
[12:10] someone do something completely and act
[12:12] a certain way you're speechless you're
[12:15] just you're left without words just in
[12:17] all of the thing I tell just as John saw
[12:20] the great of Revelation he says
[12:21] and he was astonished at this woman my
[12:24] what do what do you say right so as he
[12:27] was talking I said well God allowed Joe
[12:29] Biden to get in presence as a judgment
[12:32] to this people oh my and look what he
[12:34] brought in the White House all these
[12:36] crazy and insane kind of things of
[12:38] transgender colored hair just people who
[12:41] are completely out of their mind saints
[12:43] of God it's gone it's too far gone man
[12:46] it'll never come back right now as we
[12:49] get into these things I want to read a
[12:50] quote here now notice he says Christians
[12:52] the whole armor of Christianity is Faith
[12:55] right you've got to believe in
[12:56] everything that was ordained for you as
[12:58] an offens weapon and defensive weapon
[13:01] everything that was given to you you
[13:02] must have faith that that it was given
[13:05] to you for the thing he says he says
[13:07] everything that we have seen everything
[13:09] that we have is
[13:11] unseen everything he mentioned in that
[13:13] armor is unseen every everything you say
[13:16] oh I love this person or I love this
[13:17] person I love my mom I where is that
[13:19] love at give me a glass of that love
[13:21] because I'm a little low this morning
[13:23] I'd like to have a cup of what you have
[13:25] but you cannot produce it because it's
[13:26] in the Unseen right there a spiritual
[13:29] thing even felo love is in the spirit
[13:32] realm right it's affections sure uh and
[13:34] but then of course we know the agape
[13:36] love is the spirit of God and that's
[13:38] also in the Unseen he says everything
[13:40] that we have is unseen the only things
[13:42] that is real is unseen unexplained he
[13:45] says the things that can be explained
[13:47] are not
[13:50] real everything we see right now is less
[13:54] real is not even I'll say this more is
[13:57] it not even close to what is the Unseen
[14:00] right as I drive down the highways and I
[14:02] don't know why this affects me so much
[14:03] but every time I see a dead animal
[14:05] whether it's a squirrel whether it's a
[14:07] chipmunk or a deer or whatever I say
[14:09] Lord God have mercy I do not like to see
[14:13] death I don't like to see it I don't
[14:15] like to see it on the road just laying
[14:16] there and people and then I my heart
[14:18] goes out for those perished animals but
[14:20] I really believe that God is in full
[14:22] control and he loses nothing the very
[14:26] mind that spoke that deer and that
[14:28] squirrel or that into existence
[14:30] knows exactly where the spirit of that
[14:32] animal is right now today amen there is
[14:35] nothing lost that can be lost absolutely
[14:37] he says now notice he says he says they
[14:39] are explained are not real they are
[14:40] superficial and die but the things that
[14:42] cannot be explained are Immortal in the
[14:45] whole real amen and Saints of god that's
[14:48] literally and I say it like this this is
[14:50] the power of what God gave us what was
[14:52] one of the things that he gave us that
[14:54] is in the Unseen it is our very words
[14:56] that we speak out are in the Unseen you
[14:59] you hear I am opening my mouth and
[15:00] whatever is projecting out of this mouth
[15:03] is words or language but we cannot see
[15:06] this language or words being projected
[15:07] and enter into your ears you can't see
[15:10] any of it so it's in the spiritual realm
[15:12] that what the voice and the words and
[15:14] and noise travels in the Unseen but in
[15:17] the Unseen these things can take great
[15:19] effect to you these things can change
[15:21] lives and save souls or they can bring
[15:23] condemnation or lost souls sure by what
[15:26] the very unseen words of the power the
[15:29] Bible says the power of the mouth of
[15:30] life and death is in the mouth sure then
[15:33] that's all in the Unseen that power of
[15:35] the mouth he says what is in the Unseen
[15:38] and it carries life or it carries death
[15:41] sure he says but the things that can be
[15:43] not explained or Immortal in the whole
[15:44] realm he says look at the armor of
[15:46] Christianity love what part of you is
[15:48] love joy uh Faith longsuffering meekness
[15:51] patience all these things are unseen you
[15:54] can literally walk up to someone on a
[15:55] job site cuz that's where I work on a
[15:56] job site and you can come to a certain
[15:58] man in within 10 seconds you can tell if
[16:00] this man is
[16:02] impatient if he's got a temper or if
[16:04] he's just relax and chill why because
[16:07] out of the abundance of the the the
[16:09] heart the mouth speaketh sure brother
[16:11] Bram said he says you can know a person
[16:13] in two minutes just what comes out of
[16:14] their mouth he said that about someone
[16:16] who has the Holy Ghost you can tell and
[16:18] he said in two or five minutes however
[16:20] he said you could tell if he's got the
[16:21] holy ghost or
[16:24] not just by judging in the Unseen realm
[16:27] the things that he that that the
[16:29] couldn't even uh uh uh literally
[16:30] physically see but he could pick up the
[16:32] spirit of the words he could literally
[16:34] pick up what was speaking back to him
[16:36] amen sure he says not none of these
[16:39] things you can't see them they're unseen
[16:41] he says yet we believe them SS sints of
[16:43] God everything we believe are the very
[16:45] religion that God has sent us is unseen
[16:47] yes we have not even seen our savior in
[16:50] the flesh we haven't even seen the
[16:52] prophet of Malachi 4 In the Flesh all we
[16:56] have is a is a picture of it just like a
[16:58] the I saw this my my lovely Kent hovind
[17:02] he'd go up in his little places and he'
[17:04] say and he show a picture of on the
[17:05] screen of his wife he says this is not
[17:07] my wife this is just a picture of
[17:09] her right sure so we have pictures of
[17:12] the prophet he say he say but that's
[17:14] that's just a picture of him that's not
[17:16] him sure so everything we have we take
[17:18] we are we are literally in the in the
[17:20] era of the greatest Faith right here
[17:22] we're going to need that great faith for
[17:24] this Rapture right sure for this body
[17:26] change absolutely he says he says now he
[17:29] they unseen yet we believe them Love
[17:31] Never Dies faith is in is the victory we
[17:34] believe these things that we don't
[17:39] see so all the powers everything that
[17:43] that that that destinat or or
[17:45] predestines our end whether we go up or
[17:47] whether we go down or the very things
[17:49] that we go through is all in the Unseen
[17:52] the path that we live is in the Unseen
[17:55] the the things that we encounter the
[17:57] things that we fight are in the unseen
[17:59] realm sure and they're in another
[18:01] dimension sure now let's see here as I
[18:05] was sharing there with uh um the Saints
[18:07] in Junction City he says he says in
[18:09] Romans 10 verse1 17 so then Faith cometh
[18:12] by hearing so notice Faith which the
[18:15] Bible says we we go jump right here now
[18:16] what is Faith he says faith is a
[18:19] substance of things hoped for and the
[18:21] evidence of Things Not
[18:24] Seen so this faith is unseen it's in
[18:28] another Dimension it's another realm he
[18:30] says but he said the way you get this un
[18:33] dimens this unseen substance he says is
[18:36] by hearing the word of God now we have
[18:38] to continually hear the word of God
[18:40] because notice what it says so then
[18:41] Faith cometh it never said it comes
[18:44] right then the very second you hear your
[18:46] first sermon do you get Faith uhh for
[18:48] healing not necessarily the first time
[18:50] you hear the baptism of the name of
[18:52] Jesus Christ you receive the faith for
[18:53] the Holy Ghost not necessarily he says
[18:55] but what says the faith cometh by
[18:57] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[19:00] this all takes place in another
[19:01] dimension this all takes place in
[19:03] another realm the invisible and yet that
[19:06] invisible realm is able to what affect
[19:08] us our flesh and our spirit absolutely
[19:10] it affects the entire being of the
[19:12] person absolutely what because why God
[19:14] made it in such a way that it would
[19:16] deceive the very elected oh my it could
[19:19] deceive the Lost absolutely this has to
[19:21] be this remember this whole story is not
[19:23] even it is for Christ but it's also for
[19:26] his bride the whole intention of the
[19:29] whole thing is what we see the very we
[19:31] see the first Adam struggle with the
[19:34] what with with with what the invisible
[19:36] God was struggling before he became God
[19:38] right and that was what he said then he
[19:40] became
[19:43] lonely before he was God he was all he
[19:45] was all by himself dwelling his
[19:47] attributes and he was lonely he wanted
[19:50] someone to spend eternity with he wanted
[19:52] someone right here that would love him
[19:54] and he loved her amen and that would be
[19:56] what the bride of Christ amen the entire
[19:59] thing is for his wife that's the entire
[20:01] we know that now let's continue on here
[20:03] I got a long ways uh by God's grace
[20:05] maybe maybe not now I want to start this
[20:09] here uh the invisible realm and saints
[20:13] of God I hope by the end of this that
[20:14] you were
[20:16] encouraged because a lot of us had no
[20:18] idea what we were caught
[20:21] into and the power of what was done to
[20:24] us in religious
[20:26] Realms so let's look here by God's grace
[20:29] um I always love this quote this really
[20:31] explains so many things by God's grace
[20:35] he says now so Baum got Israel to commit
[20:38] fornication do you know that the
[20:40] physical fornication is the very same
[20:42] spirit that lies in organized
[20:45] religion so notice he goes he goes
[20:47] physical fornication other words two
[20:49] people coming together to have the wrong
[20:51] act right he says this joining together
[20:54] this joining together he says the exact
[20:56] same he says Spirit that's an organized
[20:59] religion so what is fornication is
[21:02] without a marriage vow right it's an Act
[21:05] without a marriage vow without marriage
[21:07] ceremony without a real uh for for
[21:11] someone that you you you dedicate you
[21:14] you you you you give your whole life to
[21:16] that other person right so this is just
[21:18] for pleasure we say like that he says in
[21:20] the very same spirit that lays an
[21:22] organized religion now notice organized
[21:25] religion what is that organized religion
[21:27] is someone who Jesus Christ is not the
[21:29] head of the church oh my they rejected
[21:32] the husband now and they are running
[21:33] around and doing all these sort of
[21:35] things he said I said the spirit of
[21:37] fornication is the spirit of
[21:39] organization so notice now what does
[21:41] this take place here how he say he say
[21:44] all fornications will have their place
[21:45] in the Lake of Fire this is what God
[21:46] thinks of organization yes sir the
[21:48] and her daughters will be in the Lake of
[21:49] Fire but now think about this this is a
[21:51] physical act but it means something in
[21:53] the spiritual realm this physical act
[21:56] right here is a I like the in the
[21:58] physical that's the physical that's the
[22:00] type of what takes place in the
[22:02] spiritual in the ecclesiastical
[22:05] realm yes and there's a joining there
[22:09] there's something that takes place there
[22:11] denominations are not of God they never
[22:13] have been and never will be it's the
[22:15] wrong spirit so notice the very wrong
[22:17] The Same Spirit that causes a unmarried
[22:20] woman and unmarried man to commit acts
[22:22] there is the exact same spirit that
[22:25] takes place as what we see in the
[22:27] Baptist and the assembly to God in in
[22:29] the Catholic church and all those sort
[22:31] of things that's the exact same spirit
[22:34] because remember the spirits were here
[22:36] before this thing this thing was even in
[22:38] motion they were up up in heaven
[22:40] worshiping God right and then they were
[22:42] deceived by Satan and then we know from
[22:44] there but that same Spirit those Spirits
[22:45] were separated themselves from Christ
[22:48] because the prophet said he says he said
[22:50] Satan set up his kingdom on the North
[22:52] Side of
[22:53] Heaven A separation he says denomination
[22:57] not God he has never even been never
[22:58] will be it's a wrong spirit that
[23:00] separates the people of God into
[23:01] hierarchy and leoty and it's therefore a
[23:03] wrong spirit that separates the people
[23:05] from the people right he says he says
[23:07] that's what organization and
[23:08] denominations do it's organizing they
[23:10] separate themselves from the word of God
[23:12] and bring themselves into spiritual
[23:16] adultery so we could literally I say
[23:18] this in the Physical Realm a young man
[23:20] and a young girl could keep themselves
[23:23] pure from all in uh from all all all
[23:28] filth and and those sort of things right
[23:30] but if they join up then with the false
[23:32] church and they move into that sort of
[23:34] Realm they're doing the exact same thing
[23:36] to
[23:37] God and yet can yet they have sincere
[23:40] Hearts sincere motives they're trying to
[23:43] do God a service without it being in his
[23:45] word we'll say it like that right and
[23:47] come a lot of times I'll say this I was
[23:49] in the same boat in that exact same
[23:51] thing we do it to with
[23:53] ignorance we were brought up under a
[23:56] certain religion we're brought up in a
[23:57] certain Church were brought up in to do
[23:59] religion in a certain kind of way and
[24:01] what God God then got he lets and I like
[24:04] this I was just as filthy as I could be
[24:05] I almost when I was in the world as as
[24:08] was in the Assemblies of
[24:10] God it was bad it's it was completely
[24:13] embarrassed I really repent so now um in
[24:17] this same thought I want you to look at
[24:19] the scripture here in 1 Corinthians 6:15
[24:22] he says know ye not that your bodies are
[24:23] the members of Christ shall I then to
[24:27] take the members he say of Christ and
[24:29] make them the members of a harlot he
[24:31] says God
[24:33] forbid now he's talking spiritual or or
[24:36] even natural but we can also apply this
[24:38] in the spiritual right he says what know
[24:40] ye not that he which is joined to a
[24:42] harlot is one
[24:44] body so now notice something when when
[24:47] when in the natural if when somebody
[24:49] goes out to the bars or the dance clubs
[24:51] and a man sees a woman and this and this
[24:52] and things take place they actually join
[24:55] it's a spiritual joining together
[24:59] they actually not only they come
[25:00] together in the flesh but they also it's
[25:01] a spiritual joining and the Bible
[25:04] declares they become one
[25:08] flesh whether they know it or not there
[25:11] something in the spiritual takes place
[25:14] right
[25:15] there he says should we do that and he
[25:18] says God forbid what know you not that
[25:20] he which is joined to a harlot is one
[25:22] body for two saith he shall be one flesh
[25:26] so L when they come to do that same Paul
[25:28] is actually connecting this to a
[25:30] marriage act because he's going right
[25:32] back to uh uh literally what what uh um
[25:35] uh the first Adam said or Adam said he
[25:38] says he says man and woman come together
[25:39] and they must uh become one flesh bone
[25:41] of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh he says
[25:43] and then leave the father and mother so
[25:45] he's literally bringing this back he
[25:46] says he says but they're performing the
[25:48] exact same act it's a Marriage Act he's
[25:51] bringing this to a marriage a spiritual
[25:53] marriage he says and but uh uh uh but
[25:56] it's but now notice he says but he that
[25:58] is joined under the spirit unto the Lord
[26:00] is one
[26:02] Spirit he says flee fornication every
[26:05] every sin that man goeth is without the
[26:07] body but he that committeth fornication
[26:09] sinth against his own body uh he says
[26:12] what what you uh know ye not that your
[26:14] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[26:17] which is in you which ye have of God and
[26:19] ye are not your
[26:21] own amen so here how many was bought
[26:23] with the price how many recognized the
[26:25] blood of Jesus Christ on that day on the
[26:27] day of Cal y hanging from the cross that
[26:30] was our sacrifice and by that spirit
[26:32] that left him that came back on his
[26:34] church we are joined with him in one
[26:36] spirit and one body amen and that is the
[26:38] what the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[26:40] amen and we are the bride of Christ by
[26:43] faith amen amen because what we can't
[26:46] prove it can where's my where's my
[26:47] where's my little plaque that says I am
[26:49] the bride of Christ I don't have one but
[26:51] I'm taking it by faith amen because I've
[26:53] seen what he's called me to and I de see
[26:55] the word that he's delivering to me and
[26:57] that I'm eating and I believe this is
[26:59] fresh Mana amen this is something that
[27:01] God has ordained that that that no one
[27:03] else can take from me what what it
[27:05] saying in the in the third seal he says
[27:07] touch not the oil and the wine the devil
[27:10] has no he cannot take anything from you
[27:13] he can't take Revelation from you and SS
[27:15] of God that's a mystery of why others
[27:17] are falling away in this hour from the
[27:19] message yes Hallelujah take not touch
[27:22] not the oil and wine did they really
[27:24] have the wine did they really drink that
[27:26] wine down and and really live effect and
[27:28] give them stipulation oh my right
[27:31] hallelujah or did they actually have the
[27:33] wine but they failed to have the oil as
[27:35] well which the oil is the keeper the oil
[27:38] is the keeper for 20 years you can go
[27:39] preach this gospel but if the Holy Ghost
[27:42] keeper if the one that the Bible says
[27:44] God knoweth and he has the seal he knows
[27:46] those that are his amen and that that
[27:48] right there right there is the keeper he
[27:50] is the one that's holding us in his hand
[27:52] absolutely as Christ held the Seven
[27:54] Stars in his right hand he also is more
[27:57] than if he could keep that Seven Stars
[27:59] how much more his bride amen how much
[28:01] more the ones that he loved not his
[28:03] servants in his right hand but his very
[28:05] the apple of his heart the apple of his
[28:07] eye the bride of Christ amen absolutely
[28:11] he will keep us amen he said he would he
[28:13] would never leave nor forsake you amen
[28:15] absolutely praise God he is able and I'm
[28:18] trusting in Him we're play putting all
[28:20] our faith and trusting in his word that
[28:22] he is faithful to finish this work amen
[28:26] as he started a work in your life this
[28:28] morning
[28:30] absolutely look back one year ago look
[28:33] back 5 years ago look back 20 years ago
[28:36] and tell me tell me if God has not
[28:38] changed your life if he's not brought
[28:40] you to a higher place if he's not what
[28:43] done Miracles and signs and all those
[28:45] things and not only that but he shared
[28:47] what the
[28:50] Mysteries the mysteries of the Kingdom
[28:52] of Heaven are given to you and that is
[28:56] only for the bride it's not for the m
[28:58] multitudes it is for his people the
[29:00] mysteries of God Amen what is the what
[29:03] did the prophet say the evidence of the
[29:05] Holy Ghost was it wasn't Divine love he
[29:07] says he said it was receiving the
[29:09] revealed word for your
[29:12] hour brother bradam was 60 years ago
[29:15] what about this hour amen we should be
[29:17] growing and brother said he says in this
[29:19] generation he said I hope you're
[29:20] catching it he said I hope you're
[29:21] catching the things that I'm bringing
[29:23] forth he says but if there comes another
[29:25] generation he says no doubt he there'll
[29:27] be higher than this one Amen in what
[29:29] Revelation and spiritual understanding
[29:31] absolutely why because we're getting
[29:33] closer to the Head amen we're getting
[29:35] closer to our husband amen sure as I
[29:37] shared in uh and I'll say it like this
[29:40] why do denominations have such a problem
[29:42] when I was in a denomination they never
[29:44] taught from the Old Testament hardly
[29:48] ever proess how much how much Old
[29:50] Testament did you hear outside of David
[29:52] killing Goliath and knowing
[29:54] the do you know why they can't preach
[29:57] the Old Testament do you know why
[29:59] why because the Old Testament is Shadow
[30:02] and
[30:06] type to have a shadow you must have an
[30:11] image but if you have the wrong image or
[30:14] the right or the wrong right
[30:16] thing when you bring the wrong thing if
[30:20] you bring a threers down it's not going
[30:23] to line up with the scripture in the Old
[30:24] Testament if you bring a false baptism
[30:27] down it's not going to line up if you
[30:28] bring the false god of false religion
[30:30] it'll never fit the shadow at all so
[30:33] they have no ability to understand the
[30:35] Old Testament the shadows and types when
[30:37] I was in Thailand a couple times ago I
[30:39] taught on Joseph the perfect type of
[30:41] Christ and they were blown away because
[30:42] they had never seen it why because they
[30:44] have the wrong interpretation of the New
[30:46] Testament you take the right New
[30:48] Testament you the revelation of the New
[30:50] Testament you bring it down to the
[30:52] Shadow and it's going to fit
[30:54] perfectly it's not going to be distorted
[30:56] all the details will be in the exact
[30:58] same and you'll be able to place this
[31:00] place that place that and it's under the
[31:02] amen
[31:04] sure do you see what we're seeing here
[31:06] by God's grace
[31:08] now dealing with uh adultery spiritually
[31:11] fornication spiritually we want to look
[31:14] in now how how would this take place now
[31:15] notice he says he that which is joined
[31:17] to a harlot how did this man how did
[31:20] this person be joined to a
[31:23] harlot what had to take place right here
[31:27] he says shall I take the members of
[31:28] Christ and make the members of Harlot
[31:29] how would someone do that anyhow how is
[31:32] it possible that they could take the
[31:33] members of Christ and bring them to a
[31:39] hearted it's through how she
[31:42] speaks it's through the very words that
[31:45] Usher out of the harlot's
[31:47] mouth now notice my son attend unto my
[31:52] wisdom and bow thine ear to thy
[31:54] understanding now notice here Solomon
[31:56] says he listen to what I'm saying he
[31:59] says that thou regardest that mayest
[32:01] discard regard discretion and that thy
[32:04] lips may keep knowledge he says keep
[32:06] these things right here right for what
[32:08] because this is our battle this is our
[32:10] sword of the spirit comes right out of
[32:11] our lips right he says for the lips of a
[32:14] strange woman drop as
[32:16] honeycomb remember when uh Jonathan was
[32:18] out in the field he's everybody's weary
[32:20] tired he saw honey drop from the sky and
[32:22] he hit it with a stick and put his mouth
[32:24] he says he says it was enlightening
[32:26] honey yes it was stimulation to him it
[32:29] gave him strength some kind of a meat
[32:31] from the honey right from the bees and
[32:33] now here this that Harlot woman will
[32:35] have something he is as a honeycomb it's
[32:38] not real honeycomb but it's as a
[32:40] honeycomb it be something that will be
[32:42] so tasty so good he says and her mouth
[32:45] is smoother than the Holy
[32:50] Ghost how can how can the mouth of a
[32:53] harlot or the words of a harlot be
[32:54] smoother than the Holy
[32:56] Ghost but the holy the Holy Ghost is
[32:59] rigid the Holy Ghost says you've got to
[33:02] stay with my word but what's smoother
[33:04] than honey oh you can do whatever you
[33:06] want you can do oh it's okay they didn't
[33:09] really mean that or or this scripture
[33:11] really doesn't mean that that's smoother
[33:12] than the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost
[33:13] stands here right here and says if you
[33:15] mess that up life and death stands right
[33:18] here if you cross this line you're going
[33:20] to the wrong territory I'll say like
[33:22] this would we be
[33:24] able if God would permit it which he
[33:27] will not but if he would ever permit
[33:29] this that he would come down in the
[33:30] flesh and pastor church one more
[33:33] time would you be able to handle Jesus
[33:36] as your pastor right
[33:39] right let me play my
[33:42] part Jesus would say I'm gonna suffer
[33:45] and die and I'll be like Lord You're Not
[33:48] Gonna Die that's not and he says Get
[33:50] Behind Me
[33:53] Satan whoa and all all the 11 disciples
[33:57] are like H who's controlling who's
[33:59] controlling
[34:00] Simon wonder what Spirits in
[34:04] Simon could you handle Jesus as your
[34:14] pastor he says but her end is bitter as
[34:16] warmwood sharp as a two-edged sword he
[34:18] says sharp as a two-edged sword just as
[34:25] cutting her feet go down to death her
[34:27] steps take hold on her hell lest thou
[34:30] should us Ponder the the path of Life
[34:32] her ways are movable in other words
[34:34] she'll take you off the path this way
[34:36] path this way what God said he says the
[34:38] the the the gate is straight and narrow
[34:40] which leadth unto eternal life but she
[34:42] will what take you off the path he says
[34:45] her ways are movable that thou sh that
[34:47] thou canest not know them hear me now
[34:49] therefore oh my children depart not from
[34:51] the words of my mouth what are the words
[34:53] of mouth of his mouth right here we have
[34:56] to stick with the scripture stick with
[34:58] the Bible now
[35:00] notice right here another thing Solomon
[35:04] actually according to what he says he
[35:05] literally eyewitnessed this the Bible
[35:07] says he was looking out of the casement
[35:09] of his house there out of casement of
[35:10] his where he was standing and he saw
[35:12] this young man he says void of
[35:14] understanding void of discretion had no
[35:16] re he was simple he just was just
[35:18] walking around and and this woman takes
[35:20] the Bible says and he caught him and
[35:22] kissed him with an imputed M mouth or
[35:25] however you want to say it and now
[35:26] notice when she's speaking to
[35:28] him come let us let us take our fill of
[35:31] Love unto the morning let us Solace
[35:33] ourselves with loves for the good man is
[35:35] not home he has gone along Journey he
[35:36] says he had taken a bad bag of money
[35:39] with him and will come home at the day
[35:41] appointed but with her Fair much fair
[35:47] speech I remember a battle years ago I
[35:50] was going against Pastor versus me
[35:53] versus pastor and people were watching
[35:56] and I said brother and I was speaking to
[35:58] the pastor I said we've got to be
[35:59] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[36:01] the pastor says well God knows my heart
[36:04] do you really think it really matters if
[36:06] it's Father's holy ghost or Lord Jesus
[36:08] Christ and I said yes but to those that
[36:11] are hearing they heard his reasoning and
[36:13] it was smoother than the very spirit
[36:15] that was speaking out of me staying
[36:17] stick with the word of God it's pleasing
[36:20] itching ears things that oh that's
[36:22] that's right I mean does it really
[36:23] matter there's reason it away right
[36:28] and with her much fair speech she caused
[36:30] him to yield what stop for a moment stop
[36:33] for a second and with flattering of her
[36:35] lips she forced him once he caused once
[36:39] he yielded she had
[36:41] him once he stopped for one second she
[36:44] literally grabbed them by the arm and
[36:45] there they
[36:48] went
[36:50] now I want to go to where I'm going here
[36:52] by God's
[36:53] grace in
[36:57] Revelation 171 we know who the mother of
[36:59] harlots
[37:00] is and this is more of a Protestant
[37:03] little study here by God's
[37:04] grace but there's a certain
[37:07] section I thought was absolutely
[37:10] phenomenal he says here come one of the
[37:12] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[37:14] he says and talked with me saying
[37:16] comeing come up hi come hither you have
[37:18] to come up hither he's already there he
[37:20] says come hither and I'll show the the
[37:21] Judgment of the great which sits
[37:23] upon many Waters with whom the kings of
[37:25] the Earth have committed fornication no
[37:27] notice the same spirit that Paul is
[37:29] addressing there The Same Spirit of that
[37:31] is what the spirit of
[37:33] organization which have committed what
[37:35] spiritual organization or fornication
[37:38] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[37:39] been made drunk with the wine of her
[37:41] fornication with her
[37:47] organization what did she do she
[37:48] organized
[37:50] everything when Lord when the Lord LED
[37:52] Martin Luther out what did she do she
[37:54] infiltrated and organized when Wes come
[37:57] out he they infiltrated and organized
[38:01] and now there's thousands and thousands
[38:03] and thousands of churches that are under
[38:04] the head of the Catholic church and they
[38:06] don't even know
[38:09] it he says he carried me away in the
[38:11] spirit in the wilderness and I saw a
[38:12] woman sit with seven with with a Scarlet
[38:14] colored Beast full of names of blasphemy
[38:16] having seven heads and 10 horns and the
[38:18] woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
[38:20] color and decked with gold and precious
[38:21] stones and Pearls now notice having a
[38:23] golden cup in her hand full of
[38:25] Abominations and filthiness of
[38:28] fornication
[38:31] right and have committed fornication
[38:33] with her with the wine of her
[38:36] fornication what was her wine
[38:37] Abominations and
[38:39] filthiness anything that's that God
[38:42] hates they were for it anything that was
[38:44] against the scripture of God they were
[38:46] for and they performed it he says and
[38:48] upon her forehead was a name written
[38:50] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[38:51] harlots and Abominations of the
[38:56] earth so now
[38:58] notice in Revelations
[39:01] 19
[39:04] 6 so the angel
[39:07] shows John the bapt or John the
[39:11] Revelator St John and shows him the
[39:14] great and then here in Revelations
[39:19] 19:7 at the right at the coming of
[39:22] Christ with the bride to take
[39:25] over in verse 7 he says let us be glad
[39:28] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[39:30] the marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[39:35] wife hath made herself
[39:39] ready so the eagle Prophet took John
[39:44] showed him the great
[39:46] and then just two chapters
[39:48] afterwards we find out that J the eagle
[39:52] is showing the prophet or sorry or John
[39:56] he says shows him the coming of the Lord
[39:57] the marriage of the Lamb I just like
[39:59] this brother I just talked with brother
[40:00] Brooks and in one of his dreams when he
[40:01] was very
[40:03] young that he was he had made the
[40:05] Rapture and he was playing the
[40:07] tambourine going into heaven he says and
[40:09] when he got to the gates there he was
[40:11] playing the
[40:12] tambourine he says and he saw Jesus he
[40:15] said in in his in his mind the thought
[40:17] entered he's not going to let me
[40:19] in and he started to step back and as he
[40:22] stepped back he says Jesus moved quicker
[40:25] and grabbed him and picked him him up
[40:27] like a man with a woman and kissed
[40:34] him and I said and I'll speak one today
[40:37] about and he was rehearsing that story
[40:39] to me that that Vision he had or that
[40:41] dream and I said brother Brooks you
[40:43] know the kiss is right before the
[40:47] wedding
[40:49] supper and he's like brother that's
[40:51] right I said brother even though we're
[40:53] the wife we're technically not married
[40:54] yet he has to come and get her perform
[40:58] everything we do in a marriage ceremony
[40:59] must be performed
[41:01] exactly so there's a vows that takes
[41:04] place which is what he planting he gives
[41:05] us what the token which is the Holy
[41:06] Ghost and then when he comes for her he
[41:08] picks her up kisses her as the man would
[41:10] kiss his bride lifting the veil reveals
[41:13] her who she is then then he takes her to
[41:16] the wedding supper then for the
[41:17] honeymoon is the Thousand-Year
[41:19] Millennium Reign Hallelujah I said
[41:21] that's exactly right he's like yeah but
[41:22] that's that's
[41:23] good he says but notice he says and his
[41:26] wife hath made her s ready now the
[41:28] question I read this and I said why is
[41:30] this placed
[41:32] here why is the wife hath made herself
[41:34] ready in Revelations 19 and not in
[41:37] Revelations
[41:39] 3 why is it not why is this
[41:46] here alls I know is that whatever was
[41:48] said to her
[41:50] before had to have alerted her to what
[41:53] she must
[41:55] do and what was the last last thing she
[41:57] heard from Heaven what was the last
[41:59] thing she heard from Heaven before
[42:01] this it it's right here in Revelations
[42:05] 18 verse one and after these things I
[42:08] saw another Angel come down from heaven
[42:10] having great power and the Earth was
[42:12] lightened with his glory and he cried
[42:14] mighy with a strong voice saying to
[42:15] Babylon the great is H is Fallen has
[42:17] fallen has become the habitation of
[42:18] devils and the hold of every foul uh
[42:20] spirit and the cage of every unclean and
[42:22] hateful bird All Nations have drunk from
[42:25] the wine of the wrath of her fornication
[42:27] and the kings of the Earth have
[42:28] committed fornication with her and the
[42:30] merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich
[42:32] through the abundance of her Delicacies
[42:34] who's the who's the Mercers who's the
[42:35] Mercers of the earth Bill
[42:39] Gates all these big owners the big
[42:41] companies who's making the big money the
[42:43] real merchants of the Earth the ones
[42:46] causing
[42:47] inflation the ones selling they're
[42:50] upping the price so much higher than
[42:52] than they are now notice they've all
[42:54] committed fornication other words
[42:55] they've all organized into an
[42:57] into an organization what is that the
[42:59] image directed to the Beast they have to
[43:01] come into this what and it'll they'll
[43:03] take the mark by and it's what a one
[43:05] world church and then if you go into
[43:07] that one World Church you have literally
[43:09] done these
[43:10] things but what was the ver what was the
[43:12] voice to the bride and I heard another
[43:14] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[43:17] my
[43:18] people my people my wife my bride he
[43:21] says come out over my people that be not
[43:23] partakers of her sins and that you
[43:25] receive not of her plagues this is what
[43:26] we have have to
[43:28] do this is what we must do get away from
[43:32] every Catholic Doctrine every Catholic
[43:34] tradition all those sort of things must
[43:36] go anything that's anti- word or against
[43:38] the word not found in the word of God
[43:40] must go right that's how the bride makes
[43:42] herself ready now notice what the
[43:44] prophet of God said here he says all the
[43:46] things which are dainty good all
[43:47] departed from thee and thou shalt find
[43:49] them the more this is exactly organized
[43:50] Church the last day for it says in verse
[43:52] four come out people he says notice
[43:54] remember what's taking place here
[43:58] everything in the Book of Revelation is
[44:00] taking place in chronological order but
[44:02] John is being handw walked by that angel
[44:06] through time he's literally taking a
[44:08] 2,000 year walk with the angel who was
[44:11] commissioned by Jesus to bring him and
[44:13] reveal these things and as we see these
[44:15] things he says he says come out of my
[44:17] people the Rapture has not yet taken
[44:19] place the bride is not gone when these
[44:21] terrible conditions of the rich false
[44:23] Church
[44:24] exist so we're here
[44:27] that's
[44:27] why now notice Harvest Time yes Harvest
[44:31] Time the two vines that grew together
[44:33] entwined their branches are now to be
[44:35] separated the fruits of those Vines
[44:37] which were at such variance will be
[44:39] gathered into separate Garners the two
[44:41] spirits will go into separate
[44:42] destinations he says now is it time to
[44:45] heed the final call that comes only to
[44:48] the wheat
[44:50] bride amen well brother I've I've
[44:53] witnessed to so many people brother
[44:55] Jesse how many how many postcards have
[44:57] you sent out in this this town
[45:00] thousands and
[45:03] thousands but this call to come out is
[45:06] only for the wheat
[45:09] bride and comes only to the wheat
[45:12] Bride come out over my people my
[45:14] partakers of sins and that ye the wheat
[45:17] receive not her Terror plagues Great
[45:19] Tribulation of six se old Matthew
[45:23] 24 how come we can hear this call how
[45:25] come we can hear this how do we receive
[45:28] this and it comes down to this as I I
[45:32] was looking into this I saw a couple
[45:34] quotes and just blew up in my face and I
[45:37] saw the power of what we're dealing with
[45:41] here and that's why the Bible says to
[45:43] come with all
[45:46] longsuffering the Bible says love
[45:48] conquer all and I hope by the end of
[45:50] this you'll see that if a man can get so
[45:54] in a spot to where he's anointed of God
[45:56] to to speak to a lost or Fallen brother
[46:00] or lost or Fallen sister that God can
[46:02] actually break that
[46:05] thing now look here what was revealed in
[46:08] Revelation 13 the two beasts one out of
[46:10] the water one out of the sand one of the
[46:12] land now notice he says I saw one of the
[46:14] heads that weread wounded in the death
[46:16] and the deadly wound was healed and all
[46:17] the world wondered at the Beast now
[46:18] notice that we know this took place in
[46:20] the time of Constantine when it from
[46:22] went from religious or or or or or
[46:24] military might to Papa might he says and
[46:26] and now notice there was given to him a
[46:28] mouth speaking great BL things to
[46:29] blasphemies he say and he opened his
[46:31] mouth and blasphemy and blasphemy
[46:33] against God number
[46:35] one number two to blaspheme his
[46:39] name number three and his Tabernacle he
[46:42] says and them that dwell in Earth
[46:44] there's four blasphemies like four horse
[46:47] riders interesting now four four insects
[46:53] right I'm sure many of you know what
[46:55] these are but we're going to rehearse
[46:56] them real quick
[46:57] he says and he opened his mouth as in
[46:59] blasphemy what's the first thing that
[47:01] would that
[47:03] defiled open his mouth just like a
[47:06] harlot like a woman trying to lure and
[47:09] deceive and pull away conquer he says
[47:12] teaching for com doctrines the
[47:14] Commandments of
[47:15] men hey high-m minded lovers of pleasure
[47:18] having a form of godliness and denying
[47:19] the power thereof that's the mouth of
[47:23] blasphemy now remember these are unseen
[47:26] powers here this is his way he's working
[47:29] through the Unseen the the dimensions
[47:31] the Realms then he says and he
[47:33] blasphemed the name of
[47:37] God changing the name to titles and
[47:39] refusing to do
[47:43] otherwise
[47:45] right here's the other two I found
[47:47] another in another sermon he says to
[47:50] blashe his name give him a title his
[47:52] Tabernacle which is the Holy Spirit
[47:53] dwelling place to take a place place in
[47:57] Rome a Vatican City you can just go down
[47:59] and blashe blashe by saying that they
[48:01] were
[48:04] intercessors these four things these
[48:07] four things were the power that was
[48:09] given to to them or to him to deceive
[48:13] the
[48:14] world with these Powers notice these are
[48:18] spoken
[48:24] powers and there was given him a mouse
[48:26] speaking great things and blasphemies
[48:28] and power was given unto him to continue
[48:30] 42
[48:32] months you know that's the tribulation
[48:34] there now let's continue
[48:39] on now
[48:41] notice the Antichrist Spirit was already
[48:45] working in the New Testament
[48:49] Church it already come down to a place
[48:52] where St Paul had visited the Galatians
[48:54] or when he was writing a letter to the
[48:56] Galatians
[48:57] and he'd come inspected he heard things
[48:59] he saw whatever whatever he says and in
[49:02] his Ser in his his letter he says oh
[49:04] foolish galations who hath bewish you
[49:06] that you should not obey the truth he
[49:08] literally called it
[49:11] witchcraft because the early church was
[49:13] given Grace there was nothing given to
[49:16] the Gentiles there's no there was no
[49:18] Feast we had to do no no uh other the
[49:20] only thing it's given to is what feet
[49:22] washing baptism and
[49:25] communion to add to this is witchcraft
[49:28] yes sir he called it to be witch
[49:31] witchcraft it is satanic it is in the
[49:35] spiritual realm now and yet in that
[49:37] church and write a branch off of the
[49:40] book of Acts and we find now something
[49:42] at taken place people had now notice
[49:44] what did they do did they do on purpose
[49:46] they probably did on purpose the Jews
[49:48] were doing these things trying to bring
[49:49] them right but they were under the wrong
[49:51] spirit and when you're under the wrong
[49:53] Spirit you'll bring forth the wrong word
[49:55] and therefore be anti- word if you're
[49:57] anti- word you're Antichrist and if
[49:58] you're Antichrist then you're you're
[50:00] lost you're
[50:01] done and the Antichrist word the
[50:03] Antichrist Spirit what is witchcraft yes
[50:07] sir now notice he says the what's that
[50:10] witchcraft uh mean by false
[50:13] representations to be
[50:16] witch I'm going to go into something
[50:17] real simple but it's so
[50:21] powerful how many people we witnessed to
[50:23] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[50:25] trying to wind them in and a brother
[50:28] just text me the other day said brother
[50:30] Sai he goes should I lead with the
[50:31] prophet when I'm witnessing or should I
[50:32] lead with the scripture I said well
[50:33] brother I've I I that's been a battle
[50:36] the whole time I just kind of lead with
[50:37] the scripture with Jesus and this and
[50:39] that and however and just try and win
[50:40] him to the word of God because the word
[50:42] if I can get him to the word of God
[50:43] they'll have a foundation if I can get
[50:45] him to the word of God they'll get the
[50:46] promise of the Holy
[50:49] Ghost would we lead him to a veil the
[50:51] prophet
[50:53] Veil I'll say this God can do anything
[50:56] many people have heard uh uh those sort
[50:59] of things just like uh MAA said I'll
[51:01] give you Malachi
[51:04] 4 but she was already a Christian but
[51:07] when she prayed
[51:08] for for brother
[51:10] Brandon the spirit said I'll give you
[51:12] him right hey go hey God and every
[51:15] person's built differently every person
[51:18] has a different kind of hunger I like
[51:21] medium rare steaks others like medium
[51:23] what others like medium rare steaks with
[51:26] with with a Pittsburgh touch to it where
[51:28] they free fry the outside burn it others
[51:31] like this other like that everybody has
[51:32] their own kind of taste God knows what
[51:34] is what your soul hungers and he knows
[51:36] the way that's going to catch you every
[51:38] fish is not going to bite the same kind
[51:40] of bait amen every fish want some fish
[51:43] are hungry at other times other fish
[51:45] aren't oh my sure now I want you to show
[51:49] I want you to see the power of
[51:52] this look here oh brother side that's
[51:55] really really simple yeah
[52:01] this right
[52:03] here has more power than we even maybe
[52:09] understand something takes place right
[52:13] here remember
[52:15] this is the lion Throne guard the lion
[52:19] Zoom the zoom on the East Gate is
[52:22] guarding the way into the East Gate
[52:26] that was what was on be on the throne of
[52:28] Heaven up there when John saw it these
[52:30] four beasts guarding the gate this was
[52:32] the East Gate
[52:35] guarding this is a guard you can't get
[52:37] past this unless you catch
[52:43] Revelation now notice he
[52:48] says I love this he says I was in the
[52:50] spear isn't that wonderful my I love
[52:52] that you could just call those words the
[52:54] whole of the Christian Life
[52:57] we've got to be in the spirit every time
[53:00] we leave our houses every time we leave
[53:01] our cars and in our houses and in our
[53:03] cars we must be in the spirit live there
[53:06] how many want to live in the spirit of
[53:08] God absolutely we want to walk in the
[53:10] light as he is in the light amen walking
[53:12] with him as the prophet God got lost up
[53:14] in the mountains or or directly after he
[53:16] called that storm out and the he's heard
[53:18] he's heard the Holy Ghost say come walk
[53:20] with me brother I would love to and they
[53:22] walked by what after the third poll took
[53:24] place now notice he says uh
[53:27] he says I will pray in the spirit he
[53:29] says I will sing in the spirit I'll live
[53:30] in the spirit if there's anything good
[53:31] that will come to me and has to be
[53:33] revealed by the spirit there's no way
[53:35] other
[53:37] way I can't teach it no one can preach
[53:39] it it has to be revealed by the spirit
[53:42] but in order to get the Revelation
[53:44] you've got to get in the
[53:47] spirit he says and then it has to be
[53:49] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[53:51] word because we have to make sure it's
[53:52] the right Spirit revealing it amen he
[53:54] says he says and made manifest by the
[53:56] results it
[53:58] Bears now notice what he says after
[54:02] this look at it this way all too many
[54:05] people read the Bible where it says in
[54:07] Acts 238 repent be baptized every one of
[54:09] you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[54:10] remission of sins and you shall receive
[54:11] the gift of hly ghost and they just pass
[54:13] right on they don't see
[54:17] it why don't they see it if they saw it
[54:21] by getting in the spirit
[54:26] does anyone remember that time when the
[54:28] baptism was revealed to
[54:30] them little did you know you were in the
[54:33] spirit at that time there had to be such
[54:36] a hunger for the word the truth that
[54:39] even though I was baptized twice wrong
[54:42] way one as a Catholic sprinkled baby and
[54:44] then as a Pentecostal father's Holy
[54:46] Ghost baptism when I saw that truth I
[54:49] was hungering I must have been in the
[54:51] spirit amen and when you were baptized
[54:54] in the name of Jesus Christ and this was
[54:55] revealed to you you were in the spirit
[54:57] and you didn't even know
[55:00] it well brother he was just doing a
[55:02] Bible study or somebody just witnessed
[55:03] this to me and they won me and I said
[55:05] I've getting baptized you were in the
[55:06] spirit when that was real real to you
[55:09] Hallelujah they would know that if they
[55:12] wanted to receive the Holy Spirit they
[55:13] would need to repent be baptized in the
[55:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[55:16] God would be Duty bound to fulfill his
[55:18] word by filling them with the Holy Ghost
[55:21] this they never got in his spirit
[55:28] or it would happen to them exactly as
[55:30] the word said
[55:34] right so if they not if they didn't get
[55:36] in the spirit of
[55:38] Christ What Spirit were they under yes
[55:42] sir there's only two yes sir pray to God
[55:46] for a revelation by his spirit that is
[55:48] the first step getting in the
[55:50] spirit
[55:53] now I want to I want to show you these
[55:55] things right
[55:57] here baptism of holy go Holy
[56:01] Spirit he says now in Galatians 1 18
[56:04] Paul said if an angel from heaven comes
[56:05] down bright shining Angel what is he
[56:06] speaking of a revelation in other words
[56:08] this false if a Man reveals something
[56:10] else or or even Paul himself come and
[56:12] reveal something to him gives you
[56:13] Revelation if it's not if it doesn't
[56:15] line up with the original it's false
[56:17] right he said what's he speaking of a
[56:19] revelation blessed be the name of the
[56:21] Lord it doesn't matter how good your
[56:22] Revelation is it has to come what back
[56:24] to yourm right we know those things he
[56:26] says falsely he says find me one place
[56:28] where anybody was ever baptized in the
[56:30] name of father and Holy Ghost it's not
[56:32] written in the sacred writings what is
[56:34] it it's a Dogma that started with the
[56:36] Catholic church right I know this is
[56:38] Basics but I'm telling you there's some
[56:39] this is why this is why we're not
[56:42] winning as many Souls as we
[56:46] need because remember we're not Waring
[56:48] against this brother or sister in
[56:50] denomination we're trying
[56:52] to they are held by something yes
[56:56] something has caught
[57:04] them and there they brought forth false
[57:07] water baptism to sprinkling in the name
[57:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ the Father the
[57:10] Holy Ghost Jesus said under the
[57:12] inspiration he gave to John he says you
[57:14] have a name that you're living but
[57:15] you're dead father son Holy Ghost is a
[57:17] dying name that's
[57:19] right when you are
[57:21] baptized I'll say this because that's
[57:23] not really baptized
[57:26] that's a false baptism yes when Peter
[57:30] was dealing with the 12 disciples in
[57:32] Ephesus or passing through the upper
[57:34] Coast he said not didn't do not he says
[57:36] he says You must be baptized re-baptized
[57:39] did he say re-baptized
[57:41] no he said you must be baptized John's
[57:44] baptism wasn't even the real baptism he
[57:47] did not say re-baptized he says You must
[57:49] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[57:52] there's only one baptism everything else
[57:55] is false outdated or obsolete well let's
[57:58] go walk to the Red Sea that's
[58:01] obsolete by about 4,000 years right
[58:04] now he says it's a dying name that's why
[58:08] we see no victory in our loved ones that
[58:11] our religious
[58:14] ones let me tell you a little personal
[58:16] experience Switzerland Germany and the
[58:18] places that I've been how does the
[58:20] fortune teller's Works how does evil
[58:24] spirits travel
[58:28] think on this let this soak in how do
[58:33] evil spirits travel remember they the
[58:36] evil spirits can't travel with the true
[58:39] word of God because how can be two be
[58:42] together and be uh unagreed how can two
[58:45] be how's how it go uh how could be two
[58:48] be
[58:49] joined I can't walk together and
[58:52] disagree right thank you brother he says
[58:55] how does evil travel evil spirits travel
[58:58] I want you to believe want you to
[58:59] believe me as your pastor CU you're the
[59:01] one I'm speaking to Devil's travel in
[59:04] the name of the father son Holy
[59:08] Ghost when I was sprinkled as a
[59:11] baby demons started guiding my
[59:19] life Pastor Jesse we've been at a couple
[59:22] of our cousins weddings and what did the
[59:24] pastors marry them in the name in
[59:27] in the name of the father son and they
[59:29] they they they spoke this in their
[59:33] marriage vows and my wife literally was
[59:36] speak we were speaking this on the way
[59:37] here and she goes she goes
[59:39] Z why do you think America has so many
[59:45] divorces because literally when that
[59:47] Pastor that denominational Pastor
[59:48] marries two individuals and says I marry
[59:51] you in the name of the father son Holy
[59:52] Ghost demons are transferred individ
[59:56] indiv invisibly through those
[1:00:00] words and it takes
[1:00:05] effect and it's what through
[1:00:10] a Devils travel in the name of the
[1:00:12] father Holy Ghost they cut feathers and
[1:00:14] everything else and they throw them
[1:00:15] spells on each other through the name of
[1:00:17] the father ghost it call it call it the
[1:00:19] three High
[1:00:22] names this is what we're
[1:00:24] battling why can't they see the Lord
[1:00:27] Jesus Christ because they're consumed by
[1:00:30] religious Devils blinding their
[1:00:35] eyes I was I feel like I was led to a
[1:00:38] certain brother one time I met him in a
[1:00:40] shoe Sho
[1:00:42] store and he got me involved this in
[1:00:45] this business but I was only joined that
[1:00:47] business to witness to them and Beth is
[1:00:50] my witness after every one of those
[1:00:53] business meetings I witnessed to him
[1:00:56] baptism it took three months every
[1:01:00] Sunday night for two hours after this we
[1:01:03] we' get home at one o'clock in the
[1:01:04] morning every Sunday for like three
[1:01:06] months it took three months for them
[1:01:08] even for one to see the baptism name of
[1:01:10] Jesus Christ and for three months all
[1:01:13] like did was go over baptism again and
[1:01:16] again and again and again for three
[1:01:21] months we didn't talk about
[1:01:22] predestination we didn't talk about the
[1:01:24] mother harlots we didn't talk about
[1:01:25] anything else I hit baptism for three
[1:01:28] months it took three months for even one
[1:01:33] to get
[1:01:36] baptized for him to even see
[1:01:41] it and you know what he did after that
[1:01:44] after I B he actually wanted me to
[1:01:45] baptize him baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:01:46] Christ and then he went to his old
[1:01:48] pastor and because now we're moving on
[1:01:50] to
[1:01:53] godhead I'm like he went behind back and
[1:01:56] says hey I'm I'm going to go he came me
[1:01:58] and him met in a parking lot every time

[1:02:00] in the parking lot afterwards and during
[1:02:02] the week we s in the parking lot talking

[1:02:23] them got

[1:02:30] them and he's like yeah he goes I
[1:02:33] recorded it you want to listen I said
[1:02:34] absolutely and he starts playing the
[1:02:37] conversation between him and his pastor
[1:02:39] and the pastor says oh no that's that's
[1:02:41] Lord Jesus Christ is invalid it's not
[1:02:43] and I said that's a lie that's a lie
[1:02:45] that's a lie come on come on sir you
[1:02:47] know that's a lie you that's a lie he's
[1:02:49] said well s I'm just I'm just gonna stay
[1:02:50] where I'm at and I was
[1:02:52] so hurt I I accepted the the defeat I
[1:02:55] was like fine pretty
[1:02:57] good that's fine all right well as you
[1:03:00] feel lad and this and this then he goes
[1:03:02] but I had a
[1:03:05] dream I said and then just kind of bring
[1:03:08] me relief I said tell me your dream tell
[1:03:10] me your Dream It's Over anyhow right
[1:03:14] what does it matter I said tell me your
[1:03:15] dream he goes Simon he goes I was in a
[1:03:17] parking lot and as soon as he said
[1:03:19] parking lot I said this has to do with
[1:03:23] us I go he goes when I was in that
[1:03:26] parking lot I saw Jesus over in the
[1:03:29] distance he said his body was perfect
[1:03:31] like I would think he says but his face
[1:03:33] his head was all messed up his teeth
[1:03:36] were shooting this way and that way and
[1:03:38] his his eyes were disfigured and he was
[1:03:39] all messed up he said and I started
[1:03:42] walking to Jesus he says and as I walked
[1:03:45] to Christ he like double duty to me like
[1:03:49] he said before I knew it he say he was
[1:03:50] right there in my face like this he said
[1:03:52] and he was boss he just called a boss
[1:03:55] you see the face of Cris it's seriously
[1:03:57] look looking right at the Creator he
[1:03:59] said but when he when that when Jesus
[1:04:01] got right to his face he said his head
[1:04:02] was perfectly perfectly
[1:04:04] perfect he go s do you know what that
[1:04:07] means I said absolutely I know what that
[1:04:09] means I said if you would draw closer to
[1:04:13] Jesus he will reveal the godhead see
[1:04:16] right now the godheads is all messed up
[1:04:18] I said but said I said but if you draw
[1:04:20] closer to him he said he said the
[1:04:22] godhead will become clear to you and
[1:04:25] when I said that the holy ghost in the
[1:04:28] car dropped on him and he started go
[1:04:31] like this and for five minutes the Holy
[1:04:34] Ghost took over his body and he couldn't
[1:04:36] move and His Hands start going like
[1:04:38] this and all he could do was move his
[1:04:41] eyes to mean I'm just like get him Lord
[1:04:42] get
[1:04:44] him and after about five minutes it
[1:04:46] started coming off and he's like and he
[1:04:49] comes three he's like s what was that I
[1:04:50] said that I said I'll just say his name
[1:04:53] I said
[1:04:53] Eric you wouldn't believe his
[1:04:56] servant you wouldn't believe what I was
[1:04:58] trying to teach you for four months I
[1:05:01] said so God had to come down and prove
[1:05:03] to you literally when I spoke that the
[1:05:05] Holy Ghost showed up and proved that it
[1:05:06] was right I said now you have to make a
[1:05:09] choice guess what now he believes
[1:05:12] Oneness but then he hasn't come back
[1:05:17] since Devils travel in the name of the
[1:05:20] father and Holy Ghost they blind the
[1:05:22] people what do those demons do what
[1:05:24] those Devils do they come in the person
[1:05:26] when they get baptized in the name of
[1:05:28] the father ghost those demons now are
[1:05:29] attached to him through through them
[1:05:32] through them and they start the
[1:05:33] reasoning
[1:05:35] process because remember they can't do
[1:05:37] much to the flesh but in the where did
[1:05:39] Eve fall in the in the spirit realm in
[1:05:42] the mind realm reasoning affections uh
[1:05:44] all those sort of things right
[1:05:47] there in Switzerland he says I stood by
[1:05:50] the hands of the post like that where
[1:05:52] the honest men and women died where they
[1:05:53] cut their tongues and burnt their eyes
[1:05:55] and everything out hot rods that
[1:05:57] prostitute Catholic Church not only that
[1:05:58] but they early anglicans to church
[1:06:01] churches too he says and your Protestant
[1:06:03] churches did the same thing and they
[1:06:05] throw those
[1:06:06] spells by the father Son and Holy
[1:06:10] Ghost it literally looks like to
[1:06:13] me the what is the point of the Catholic
[1:06:15] Church they're to control the people
[1:06:18] remember they if they go off the word
[1:06:20] they that false word that hybrid word
[1:06:22] takes an effect on people it is a
[1:06:26] spiritual realm we're dealing with is a
[1:06:28] spiritual effect and if that in fact I I
[1:06:31] was at the Junction City and they showed
[1:06:33] me a a video uh brother Chad Lamb did on
[1:06:36] baptism and he showed and and I think it
[1:06:39] was brother Frank that was under brother
[1:06:40] Chad that found it but literally he
[1:06:42] found a video from 2016 where the pope
[1:06:46] literally
[1:06:47] said anyone that's got our baptism is
[1:06:51] ours why would he say that
[1:06:55] that's right if that baptism didn't have
[1:06:57] any power that's right if that baptism
[1:07:00] didn't connect to people in the
[1:07:01] spiritual
[1:07:03] realm it's a
[1:07:06] channel so here they are these are what
[1:07:09] F ghost is a
[1:07:11] spell when without the proper
[1:07:16] understanding look here he says how did
[1:07:19] I know there was a living God not until
[1:07:20] somebody a theology somebody's
[1:07:22] intellectual conception of some
[1:07:23] emotional period that passed through an
[1:07:25] age gone by as infidels would tell us
[1:07:27] but one day Down Yonder I found him and
[1:07:28] talked him face to face that made things
[1:07:30] different he said
[1:07:32] spiritualism Works
[1:07:34] through Father Son and Holy Ghost I
[1:07:37] stood in meeting where those witches was
[1:07:39] a working now he says spiritualism Works
[1:07:43] through
[1:07:45] that this is a
[1:07:48] gateway this right
[1:07:50] here this is a this is a baptism of
[1:07:53] death demons travel through this baptism
[1:07:56] what was the first two things the
[1:07:58] Catholic Church changed baptism and
[1:08:01] godhead and look at everything that
[1:08:03] flooded in and then now the prophet of
[1:08:05] God connects this baptism to
[1:08:11] spiritualism what's
[1:08:19] spiritualism here's the Apostles Creed
[1:08:22] everybody know that don't they have a
[1:08:24] song didn't thir day or something like
[1:08:25] Apostles Creed song or somebody I I
[1:08:28] believe in God the Father Almighty
[1:08:30] creator of heavens and the Earth Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ his only son our Lord uh our Lord
[1:08:33] who was born conceived by the Holy Ghost
[1:08:34] born of Virgin Mary suffered was under
[1:08:37] crucified and then gets all this stuff
[1:08:40] which is relatively right I believe in
[1:08:43] the Holy Spirit the Holy Catholic Church
[1:08:47] the communion
[1:08:49] of
[1:08:51] saints the Forgiveness of sins the
[1:08:53] resurrection of the body and the life of
[1:08:55] everlasting
[1:08:56] amen so
[1:08:58] through what' he
[1:09:00] say he says Spiritual Works through
[1:09:03] father son Holy
[1:09:07] Ghost now the Catholic Church believes
[1:09:09] the intercession or the communion of
[1:09:11] saints of dead people to go and die it's
[1:09:13] purely a spirit a form of spiritualism
[1:09:16] right right and the Protestant church
[1:09:19] right in their own homemade Apostles
[1:09:21] Creed so what do he say a lot of the
[1:09:24] Protestants have a adopted the Apostles
[1:09:26] Creed right and I'll say like this one
[1:09:28] of my old foremen he was at the time and
[1:09:30] he's not saved right now but at the time
[1:09:31] he was a free Baptist he says he opened
[1:09:33] his free Baptist Bible study his Bible
[1:09:35] they gave him from the free Baptist he
[1:09:37] says and in that was the Apostles Creed
[1:09:40] and he said the Holy Roman Catholic
[1:09:42] Church the Baptists had already adopted
[1:09:44] this in put it in their
[1:09:47] Bible the Holy Roman Catholic Church is
[1:09:50] in I believe in them the Baptist the
[1:09:52] free
[1:09:53] Baptist and the pro church right in her
[1:09:56] homemade Apostles Creed which is never
[1:09:57] something found in the Bible they say
[1:09:59] they believe in the Holy Roman Catholic
[1:10:01] church and they believe in the community
[1:10:02] of saints which blings brings P prism
[1:10:05] into spiritualism as
[1:10:08] well now they're connected but where was
[1:10:11] the start in father son Holy Ghost
[1:10:15] baptism what brother say about the
[1:10:17] Catholic church he says what's your uh
[1:10:20] opinion you're just a non-catholic
[1:10:21] aren't you he says no sir I'm a
[1:10:22] Protestant he said you don't protest he
[1:10:24] says I do protest not the people but the
[1:10:26] church's Doctrine see he says what's
[1:10:29] your opinion of the church I'm sorry you
[1:10:30] asked that he says go ahead say it I
[1:10:33] asked you he said what brother what the
[1:10:35] what did Malachi 4 say about the
[1:10:39] Revelation 1718 the highest form of
[1:10:42] spiritualism that I know of he said
[1:10:44] spiritualism yes
[1:10:46] sir I mean not the Church of Satan not
[1:10:50] witches and warlocks he said but the
[1:10:51] Catholic church is the highest form of
[1:10:53] speaking they have buil ions praying to
[1:10:56] dead people
[1:10:58] billions and sometimes they get oil out
[1:11:01] of their hands or foreheads out of
[1:11:02] statues and blood and all those sort of
[1:11:04] things it's it has a
[1:11:05] fact because why have
[1:11:09] power he says anything that intercedes
[1:11:11] with the dead is spiritualism all them
[1:11:13] women walk he says going down the street
[1:11:15] pulling the Rocks like things doing pent
[1:11:17] he says pent to a dead woman who her
[1:11:20] lover is killed and makes her a saint
[1:11:21] calls her canonized by the church he I
[1:11:24] said that's spiritualism
[1:11:29] so when we go out witnessing from here
[1:11:31] on remember how they were
[1:11:34] baptized you know how much more success
[1:11:37] I have witnessing on uh at the job site
[1:11:39] of people who are not religious and
[1:11:41] they're able to even see serpent
[1:11:43] seed I witnessed to a a religious man
[1:11:46] years ago and I said man you need to get
[1:11:48] re-baptized he says I'm already saved
[1:11:50] you're telling me what I've do what
[1:11:51] what's all this effect because he had
[1:11:53] God was cleaning him up he's likeyou
[1:11:55] telling me I got to re baptize I've
[1:11:56] already seen results and it rejected
[1:11:59] baptism right there and I moved on to a
[1:12:01] painter guy who was talking completely
[1:12:03] filth I started hitting with serice seed
[1:12:05] and he says I see it and I'm like here's
[1:12:08] a religious man that what he baptized
[1:12:11] father Holy Ghost and then once you
[1:12:12] reveal the truth behind it he can't
[1:12:14] receive it and I goes to complete
[1:12:16] Heathen and he's able to see receive one
[1:12:18] of the Mysteries of the Kingdom of
[1:12:21] Heaven did he continue on no but he saw
[1:12:24] it it was revealed to him he's like I
[1:12:26] see
[1:12:27] that
[1:12:29] unreal now what is spiritualism a a
[1:12:32] system of belief or religious practice
[1:12:34] based on supposed communion with the
[1:12:35] dead Saints or dead with the spirits of
[1:12:38] the Dead especially through
[1:12:41] mediums now in closing
[1:12:47] here my pastor's
[1:12:50] been uh brother Cam's been preaching on
[1:12:53] preparation
[1:12:56] for the New Testament Church
[1:12:59] ages and he's going through David's life
[1:13:02] and showing everything that must take
[1:13:04] place before the book of Acts in the Old
[1:13:08] Testament and as he was teaching
[1:13:11] this uh listen to another sermon and
[1:13:14] things start
[1:13:17] jumping if you look at King
[1:13:20] Saul King Saul was a type of
[1:13:24] denomination Minister brother said he
[1:13:26] was a high Mighty denominational man
[1:13:27] ecclesiastical vests and all those sort
[1:13:29] of things and the shields were doctrines
[1:13:31] and all those sort of things right all
[1:13:32] that he was
[1:13:33] completely
[1:13:37] denominational and we know that King
[1:13:40] Saul committed two great
[1:13:42] sins
[1:13:49] he he literally sacrificed when he
[1:13:52] should not done the sacrifice right
[1:13:56] the prophet Samuel was supposed to
[1:13:57] sacrifice and he did not wait long
[1:13:59] enough to sacrifice and Saul said I
[1:14:01] forced myself because of the
[1:14:04] people and
[1:14:07] then after that God continued to move
[1:14:10] through him it says he says now he say
[1:14:12] when I get you this King he says destroy
[1:14:14] all the AMCs destroy them
[1:14:18] all they went into battle and Saul
[1:14:22] said Saul said to Samuel I've done all
[1:14:27] I've kept every word every
[1:14:29] commandment Samuel's like what's the
[1:14:31] bleeding of the sheep I hear what's this
[1:14:34] mooing of the
[1:14:35] cows what are these other animals he
[1:14:37] says and what's this what's the king
[1:14:39] here you left alive what's he doing
[1:14:41] here and Samuel said he says the kingdom
[1:14:44] is rent from
[1:14:46] you it's
[1:14:48] over
[1:14:50] right now notice
[1:14:57] he says Thou Hast done foolishly thou
[1:14:59] has not kept the Commandment of the Lord
[1:15:01] thy God which he commanded thee for now
[1:15:03] would the Lord have established th
[1:15:04] Kingdom forever in Israel and now the
[1:15:07] kingdom shall not continue the Lord has
[1:15:08] saw a man after his own heart the Lord
[1:15:11] hath commanded him to be Captain over
[1:15:13] his people so at this point right here
[1:15:18] does everyone remember as soon as this
[1:15:20] point God now has to go and Hunt himself
[1:15:23] a man after his own heart and he finds
[1:15:25] David right and as soon as the prophet
[1:15:28] goes and takes the Horn of oil and
[1:15:30] anoints David the Bible says the spirit
[1:15:32] of the Lord was with David from that
[1:15:34] point on and we see the very next verse
[1:15:37] after that that an evil spirit was sent
[1:15:39] by God onto
[1:15:41] Saul so look at the connection right
[1:15:44] here now notice the denominational now
[1:15:46] has since passed their day of judgment
[1:15:49] or pass their day of Grace I'll say like
[1:15:51] that and then now the true anointing is
[1:15:53] on the true and now the denomination was
[1:15:56] catch a different kind of spirit now
[1:15:58] notice what takes place when he catches
[1:15:59] this evil
[1:16:03] spirit the spirit starts uh giving saw
[1:16:08] horrible times nightmares dreams however
[1:16:11] whatever you say something get him just
[1:16:12] in a bad attitude all the time and he
[1:16:14] has to find someone to bring those evil
[1:16:17] spirits off of him and we know the story
[1:16:20] how uh the a man said he said King Saul
[1:16:23] he said I've heard of a man the son of
[1:16:25] Jesse he says that will play before you
[1:16:27] with his hand on the harp and he said
[1:16:29] bring him and and and and David gets
[1:16:32] there and starts playing the
[1:16:34] harp maybe not singing maybe he was
[1:16:36] asked to sing and song sings a beautiful
[1:16:38] song but he doesn't like it where did I
[1:16:40] get that thought from and then he plays
[1:16:42] continue plays and the Bible said the
[1:16:44] evil spirit departs from
[1:16:46] him he said hey I want you with me
[1:16:49] always because he saw the spirit of God
[1:16:51] on this young man
[1:16:55] and we know the story
[1:16:56] how uh now notice for Rebellion is the
[1:17:00] sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is
[1:17:02] the iniquity the iniquity and
[1:17:09] idolatry so
[1:17:12] as as that evil spirit would start
[1:17:15] dealing with
[1:17:19] Saul remember this is the this is the
[1:17:22] this is a type in Shadow
[1:17:25] we know what a good spirit does what we
[1:17:26] know what the Holy Ghost does and we
[1:17:28] know what the Antichrist Spirit
[1:17:30] does now remember the one who received
[1:17:33] the anointing oil from the horn the one
[1:17:36] who received the presence of God from
[1:17:37] the horn had a
[1:17:40] name what was his
[1:17:43] name
[1:17:48] David David was his name David was the
[1:17:53] one who was the Shepherd David was the
[1:17:56] one who fought the bear and the lion and
[1:17:58] slew them David was one was the one who
[1:18:01] took down Goliath with a sling and one
[1:18:05] stone David was his
[1:18:10] name but from the very time that Saul
[1:18:14] received that evil
[1:18:15] spirit what did Saul call
[1:18:19] David he would not call him by name but
[1:18:23] he would call him by time
[1:18:25] [Laughter]
[1:18:32] idles an evil spirit keeping the name
[1:18:37] hidden Time After
[1:18:40] Time who is this he said and Saul's
[1:18:42] anger was kindled against Jonathan he
[1:18:44] said thou son of a perverse rebellious
[1:18:46] woman do not I confuse it thou has
[1:18:48] chosen
[1:18:50] David the son of
[1:18:53] Jesse and yet David at one point was one
[1:18:56] of the head leaders of Saul taking he
[1:18:59] said once he once he saw the people like
[1:19:01] David more than himself he said he eyed
[1:19:03] him from that day and separated him from
[1:19:05] him and then David went out before him
[1:19:08] as one of his great commanders and
[1:19:10] mighty leaders and went out Bes and the
[1:19:12] Bible said he'd be saved to behav
[1:19:13] himself more wisely than all the rest so
[1:19:17] Sol s Saul knew his name was David but
[1:19:21] once he received the evil spirit he only
[1:19:23] would refer to him and as
[1:19:26] titles good
[1:19:29] amen see what the evil spirit does and
[1:19:33] when he bring the tit he would hide the
[1:19:35] name of the people but the people knew
[1:19:37] he was referring because they understood
[1:19:38] who the titles
[1:19:40] represented but one by one he says for
[1:19:43] as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon
[1:19:45] the ground Thou shalt be established nor
[1:19:47] thy
[1:19:49] kingdom then sa and servant stood about
[1:19:51] me hear y you bites will the will David
[1:19:54] he says will the son of Jesse give
[1:19:56] everyone who
[1:19:58] fields that all of you have conspired
[1:20:01] against me and there's not there's none
[1:20:02] that showeth me that my son hath made a
[1:20:04] league with the son of
[1:20:07] Jesse title switching the name for
[1:20:11] titles shows the denominational spe is
[1:20:15] one and the
[1:20:18] same ah he says and Saul said unto him
[1:20:23] why hast thou conspired against me thou
[1:20:25] and the son of
[1:20:27] Jesse the
[1:20:32] title son of Jesse no that's Malachi
[1:20:35] brother
[1:20:39] [Laughter]
[1:20:43] okay now notice what amlc look what the
[1:20:46] priesthood refers him to and amalec
[1:20:49] answered the king and said who is so
[1:20:50] faithful among you of all thy servants
[1:20:53] as the son of Jesse the priesthood had a
[1:20:55] revelation the TR priesthood had the
[1:20:58] revelation of the name of
[1:21:03] David which is the King's son-in-law Oh
[1:21:06] my he doesn't refer him to as a son of
[1:21:08] Jesse but the son of the king oh my
[1:21:13] David and David's young man came and
[1:21:15] said to nabal according to all those
[1:21:17] words the same of as of David and ceased
[1:21:19] and nabal answered David's servants and
[1:21:21] said who is David and who is the son of
[1:21:23] Jesse he said ' there are many servants
[1:21:26] nowadays that break away from every man
[1:21:28] from his master so when Saul started
[1:21:31] referring to him as the son of David
[1:21:34] everyone in that area referred to him as
[1:21:36] the son of David as well and already got
[1:21:39] to who nabal who is a foolish
[1:21:43] man foolish virgin maybe
[1:21:51] lost didn't even know who David was
[1:21:53] who's the son Jesse
[1:21:55] ain't nobody
[1:21:57] him
[1:22:04] now would Saul ever use the name of
[1:22:07] David again or would he always refer to
[1:22:10] him as the son of
[1:22:14] Jesse Remember the Time Saul went after
[1:22:17] David one more time said I heard among
[1:22:20] the Wilderness here and he went in and
[1:22:21] they found a cave and like hey let's
[1:22:23] just stay tonight in the the cave and
[1:22:24] call it good they said all right and the
[1:22:26] Bible said that David and his mighty men
[1:22:27] were hiding in that
[1:22:31] cave and the Bible said a deep sleep
[1:22:33] Came Upon all them and as let me as the
[1:22:37] Mighty Men says David now's your chance
[1:22:40] the Lord has re Avenged you and you're
[1:22:43] the only guy that can do
[1:22:49] it David goes out with the spear
[1:22:54] you know how that song
[1:22:56] goes I love it goes like this and all
[1:23:00] the mighty man he's he did it he slew
[1:23:03] the he slew he slew the king now he's
[1:23:06] the King David comes back with a little
[1:23:08] clo did he do it did he do it no he say
[1:23:11] I'll not touch God's
[1:23:15] anointing but the Bible said in his
[1:23:17] heart just renting his cloth His Garment
[1:23:20] rented his heart it broke him
[1:23:27] so David stayed his servants with these
[1:23:29] words and suffered them to rise not
[1:23:30] against Saul but Saul rose up out of the
[1:23:32] cave and went his way didn't even know
[1:23:35] anything had taken
[1:23:37] place so David also Rose after and went
[1:23:40] out of the cave and cried after
[1:23:43] Saul my Lord the
[1:23:46] king then Saul looked behind him he says
[1:23:49] David he says stooped his face to the
[1:23:50] ground and bowed
[1:23:53] himself David said unto Saul why hast
[1:23:56] thou why hearest thou men's words saying
[1:23:58] behold David seeketh thy hurt behold
[1:24:01] this this day thine eyes have seen how
[1:24:03] the Lord has delivered thee today in my
[1:24:05] hand in the cave and some bade me kill
[1:24:08] thee but my eyes spared thee he says and
[1:24:11] I have not put away I have not put forth
[1:24:13] my hand against thee my Lord for he is
[1:24:16] the Lord's anointed look what he's
[1:24:18] coming out of his heart Saul I could I
[1:24:22] had you God put you right in my hands
[1:24:26] God is with me I could have took the
[1:24:29] crown right now in fact they were
[1:24:32] pressuring me to do it they wanted me to
[1:24:34] do it what they want to get out of the
[1:24:35] Wilderness they want to get back they
[1:24:37] want to they want fields and ven wordss
[1:24:38] they want to they want to take over the
[1:24:40] Nations for God they want to start this
[1:24:42] ministry now he says and I said
[1:24:47] no he says more over my father see see
[1:24:50] the skirt of the robe of my hand for I
[1:24:52] have cut off thy skirt thy robe and kill
[1:24:54] thee not know thou and see that there is
[1:24:56] no evil nor transgression in my hand and
[1:24:59] I have not sinned against thee yet thou
[1:25:01] htest my soul to take
[1:25:05] it the Lord's judge between me and thee
[1:25:07] and the Lord's avenge me of thee but my
[1:25:10] eye ha uh but my hand has not been upon
[1:25:12] thee as the Lord as sayith the proverb
[1:25:15] of the Ancients wickedness proceeded
[1:25:16] from the wicked but my hand shall not be
[1:25:18] upon thee after whom is the king of
[1:25:20] Israel come out after whom thou dust
[1:25:23] after a dog a dead dog after flee the
[1:25:25] Lord therefore judged between me and
[1:25:27] thee and see and plead my cause and
[1:25:30] deliver me out of thy hand and it came
[1:25:32] to pass as David had made an end of the
[1:25:35] speaking of the words of the Saul that
[1:25:36] Saul said is this thy voice my son of
[1:25:41] Jesse now he starts speaking to him
[1:25:44] something had
[1:25:46] broken and he
[1:25:49] realized that David was
[1:25:52] righteous and he switched back from
[1:25:54] titles and then calls him David goes
[1:25:57] right back to the
[1:26:01] name remember with them titles comes an
[1:26:05] evil spirit those e that that titles
[1:26:08] brings or carries an evil spirit saints
[1:26:12] of God how are we going to win these
[1:26:15] people we're going to have to get in the
[1:26:17] spirit of God to say the right as David
[1:26:20] said the right thing to Saul
[1:26:24] if David would not came out of the cage
[1:26:26] cave and revealed things to him and
[1:26:28] spoken that Saul would have went on and
[1:26:30] did what he did and just still been
[1:26:31] angry and this and this but right here
[1:26:34] at this time David felt led to go and
[1:26:36] speak to the man at a certain time in a
[1:26:39] certain kind of way and a certain kind
[1:26:41] of tone under the anointing of
[1:26:44] God and He restored his name right back
[1:26:46] to
[1:26:48] him amen he says Thou Art more righteous
[1:26:50] than I and and thou and and for and and
[1:26:54] for thou Hast rewarded me good whereas I
[1:26:56] reward thee evil now why is it D why did
[1:26:58] he want to we hide the name of David
[1:27:01] because the name of David means loving
[1:27:04] or
[1:27:06] beloved he was a type of Christ and God
[1:27:09] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:27:12] well
[1:27:16] pleased amen he did not want to call him
[1:27:19] beloved of the
[1:27:21] Lord he would not refer to he did not
[1:27:23] want to we acknowledge that what the God
[1:27:26] loved him loved David and the spirit of
[1:27:28] God was with David he would not
[1:27:30] acknowledge it what this evil spirit
[1:27:32] within him good but after David brought
[1:27:35] it in such a way he brought it back he
[1:27:37] says you are the Beloved of the
[1:27:40] Lord amen let's
[1:27:43] rise amen says by God's grace I kept you
[1:27:45] an hour and 20 sorry well not sorry but
[1:27:48] I wanted you to see these things it was
[1:27:51] just a basic study on
[1:27:53] baptism but it shows you what we're
[1:27:55] dealing with
[1:27:56] here that Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:27:59] baptism
[1:28:00] is a dangerous
[1:28:03] thing I I was false baptized twice and
[1:28:07] God kept me out of it he kept me from he
[1:28:10] pulled me right from those things in
[1:28:13] fact last I knew I still had the little
[1:28:14] card from the Catholic church I should
[1:28:15] find it and burn it
[1:28:19] right but he pulled us
[1:28:22] out and for those of you who are never
[1:28:24] baptized or false baptized father and
[1:28:27] Holy Ghost blessings of the Lord are
[1:28:29] with
[1:28:30] you but saints of God pray for
[1:28:35] Revelation I just heard a brother say
[1:28:37] this he said he said first of all we
[1:28:38] need Revelation and then we need to get
[1:28:41] into action even though it's even though
[1:28:44] something is revealed to us we still
[1:28:46] have to take an action
[1:28:48] for well I see it I see it AB but what
[1:28:51] are you going to do about it now amen
[1:28:53] amen so
[1:28:54] we trust all is well Hearts Minds clear
[1:28:57] saints of God be encouraged God look
[1:29:00] what God has blessed you with the
[1:29:03] correct baptism you've been baptized in
[1:29:05] the name of Jesus Christ no Devils can
[1:29:08] get through the the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:10] baptism there's only one spirit that is
[1:29:13] Promised through that
[1:29:15] baptism there's only one Spirit
[1:29:18] guarantees you the Holy Ghost and that
[1:29:20] what that the spirit of God guarantees
[1:29:22] you that because who spoke of Peter on
[1:29:24] that day the Holy Ghost amen Peter says
[1:29:27] this is the way he says and you shall
[1:29:28] receive eternal life amen you at that
[1:29:31] time when you receive him what you will
[1:29:33] be bride amen there's nothing can stop
[1:29:37] it straight is the gate and narrow is
[1:29:40] the way that straight gate is a water
[1:29:44] way that Waterway
[1:29:47] carries one Spirit only one Spirit can
[1:29:50] operate right there
[1:29:52] hallelujah amen praise God God all
[1:29:54] Hearts Minds clear SS God if you have
[1:29:56] something on burden on your heart this
[1:29:57] morning if you need something we will
[1:29:58] pray for you by God's grace and all the
[1:30:00] sort of things but the Lord is
[1:30:02] good remember the Bible said these are
[1:30:04] what what Paul say he said these are the
[1:30:06] unsearchable riches of
[1:30:09] Christ there are things hidden in
[1:30:12] here there are things hidden in the
[1:30:15] quotes there are Greater Heights of
[1:30:18] understanding and Revelation that we
[1:30:19] need to get to Hallelujah because
[1:30:22] remember we're not fighting the war for
[1:30:23] our El did David fight the war for
[1:30:26] himself he was fighting for all of
[1:30:28] Israel he was fighting for God to take
[1:30:31] full control of the Kingdom absolutely
[1:30:33] for that area that was the promised
[1:30:36] land remember the book does not
[1:30:39] shut until that last Soul receives the
[1:30:42] Holy Ghost Hallelujah he says at that
[1:30:46] time of the closing he's let him be
[1:30:47] filthy that is filthy still him that is
[1:30:49] righteous righteous still him is unjust
[1:30:50] still he says and him that is Holy be
[1:30:52] holy still saints of God let us find
[1:30:55] these last few and pull them out shut
[1:30:58] that uh demonic Lifeline that evil
[1:31:00] spirit Lifeline of that
[1:31:03] baptism because once they it's amazing
[1:31:05] how the devil knew that the devil
[1:31:06] changed baptism and God itad and through
[1:31:09] that came everything the persecution the
[1:31:13] the evilness the the the the drunken
[1:31:15] with the blood of saints the riches
[1:31:16] everything came through that baptism and
[1:31:18] somehow the devil knew it because
[1:31:21] remember it's off the word you're no
[1:31:23] longer with Christ
[1:31:26] amen let's let's just say a word of
[1:31:28] prayer musicians if you want to come and
[1:31:30] play Here by God's grace something
[1:31:32] nice the Lord is so mindful to us he has
[1:31:36] kept us he has shown us Great and Mighty
[1:31:41] things but just going over this to me
[1:31:43] when I studied this out I said man he
[1:31:46] delivered me even at that first initial
[1:31:50] point where I was hungering for more
[1:31:52] word and the first first thing one of
[1:31:54] the first things that God brought was to
[1:31:56] me through brother Craig brother Brooks
[1:31:57] was baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:59] this is the way this is the way out this
[1:32:02] is the way to eternal life this is the
[1:32:04] correct path right here Saints and I'm
[1:32:06] so I'm grateful now I'm grateful more
[1:32:08] now right now than I was back then I was
[1:32:11] so stirred up back then I was so excited
[1:32:13] but here right now I
[1:32:15] see that if I wouldn't have rejected
[1:32:17] that what I would have been
[1:32:24] there are people right now from my old
[1:32:26] church that rejected this baptism and
[1:32:29] now they have DJ Services at weddings
[1:32:32] and they're playing Michael Jackson and
[1:32:34] Metallica and the last time I saw on
[1:32:36] Facebook one of them has a beer right on
[1:32:38] there and these are Minister one is a
[1:32:40] minister singing in the church
[1:32:42] denomination Church they have beers now
[1:32:44] they have this
[1:32:47] that I meet a lot of Christians on the
[1:32:51] church they're still cussing and
[1:32:52] swearing there is no difference because
[1:32:55] when they get baptized that way that's
[1:32:57] the lifeline of the devil when you go
[1:33:00] off one word what does it do it opens
[1:33:03] the that's literally the crack that lets
[1:33:06] demons enter
[1:33:07] in and remember it's a spiritual thing
[1:33:11] what is baptism you're dying with Christ
[1:33:14] you're dying with your mate you're
[1:33:16] literally taking on uh when he died on
[1:33:18] the cross that's what that represents
[1:33:19] you're dying with him by baptism into
[1:33:22] that so it's a spiritual coming into a
[1:33:24] covenant with him you're coming to a
[1:33:25] marriage with him and if you do that
[1:33:27] wrong you're coming into another
[1:33:29] marriage a different marriage in the
[1:33:31] wrong way yes sir and with that wrong
[1:33:34] marriage comes the wrong things
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:39] amen so let's just let's just bow our
[1:33:42] heads here by God's grace let's lift our
[1:33:43] hands to the
[1:33:45] Lord let's say a word of prayer dear

[1:36:12] sints of God what if he would not have
[1:36:14] showed us this how many demons would I
[1:36:17] have had on
[1:36:18] me thousands TW I mean my goodness out
[1:36:23] of our genetics what we see our parents
[1:36:26] right depression that depression
[1:36:30] Spirit got a stronghold on my daddy our
[1:36:34] daddy but by the end the Lord's going to
[1:36:36] Lord's going to take care of
[1:36:38] that when he rises once more when the
[1:36:40] Holy Ghost Rises once more and comes on
[1:36:43] the seed for his bride things are going
[1:36:46] to take
[1:36:48] place let us let us yield ourselves once
[1:36:51] again say Lord God I commit my life back
[1:36:54] to you and from this day forward Lord
[1:36:57] God Lord God no matter what someone says
[1:37:00] no matter what someone
[1:37:02] does I know it's just flesh it's not
[1:37:07] them you find the most wicked man in the
[1:37:10] world the one that's killed a million
[1:37:12] people on their deathbed they'll be
[1:37:15] crying because they're just
[1:37:18] flesh when that evil anointing comes off
[1:37:21] them I guarantee they regret what
[1:37:24] they've
[1:37:28] done remember that giant man that tried
[1:37:30] to kill brother brandom that
[1:37:33] Maniac I'm gonna I'm gonna rip you from
[1:37:35] limb to limb brother B said he had every
[1:37:37] Power to do
[1:37:38] it but before that demon possessed man
[1:37:41] could get to him the Holy Ghost said he
[1:37:44] says but you he says who challenged the
[1:37:45] Holy Ghost will fall before my feet and
[1:37:48] that Maniac fell and the police are like
[1:37:50] what are we going to do he said just
[1:37:51] leave him be he says is he healed he
[1:37:55] says no he loves that Spirit when he
[1:37:57] comes back he says he'll be exactly the
[1:38:00] same just haul them
[1:38:03] off but I guarantee you if we could get
[1:38:05] someone free from those Spirits they'd
[1:38:07] become a normal happy individual
[1:38:11] Hallelujah let me ask you like this most
[1:38:14] babies the most babies are born are they
[1:38:16] happy or they mean they want to be they
[1:38:19] want to be happy they want to smile and
[1:38:21] giggle and laugh and go go right they
[1:38:23] want to do all that if you treat him
[1:38:25] that way if you nurture them that way
[1:38:27] they're going to be
[1:38:28] happy but if you get a parent with a bad
[1:38:31] Spirit on them an evil spirit that child
[1:38:33] will be angry and hateful and throw and
[1:38:35] talk back and all those sort of things
[1:38:36] The Same Spirit that was on the parents
[1:38:38] who jumps to the
[1:38:41] children it's the same with the false
[1:38:43] church if the church has a false
[1:38:45] Doctrine false Spirit it'll jump onto
