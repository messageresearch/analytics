he's a day above all day thank you Lord and you're worthy of o breeze and my heart the sea I agree [Applause] ha ha ok we're going to finish fires here in church age tonight more willing by God's grace Revelation chapter 2 I believe it's verse 26 was it 24 so I revelation 2:20 for revelation to 24 so I feel real good to finish something don't you like to finish something I just need to finish something I don't like long projects like to get it done but I've had a good week of finishing things you know I finally I clean out the whole the whole house downstairs and the whole garage now if you like Matt we're really making progress but I feel good and that's how it is with God don't you love to see God's Word fulfilled and God's Word finish oh you reach a milestone in the Lord just think thank the Lord yesterday was our 14th anniversary my own eyes hey that's good to finish another year so we're thankful God has been so merciful we just have nice a nice long walk yesterday and just talking about God is just so graciously provided everything and to think of the next 14 years we'll look what God's done the last 14 years what might he do the next 14 if he tarries you know I'll be 50 years old for many years it's hard to think of that that's anyhow I always felt like I'd be the young person I thought the rapture would come as I was young man you know we just don't know no Matt knows there they are but we'll give our whole life to Christ in relation to 24 we'll just read you know why don't we why don't we just go down to verse let's just look at the reward let's go down to verse 26 to the overcomer let's just read 26 and 27 the rest of that is pretty from there we've been preaching on that you know often on verse 26 let's read that together one two three and you can overcometh and keepeth my works unto the head they didn't would I get a power over the nation's let's pause right there what does he give the overcomer power over nations to rule over nations that is such an amazing promise doesn't that just make you feel little me I could be one that could rule over a nation a little minute that's the process the promise of God it will not fail let's read verse 27 one two three and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I receive my that's that one more word for every kid Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord thank you for your mercy les is preaching without word and father help us to grow grace knowledge of you these church ages have meant so much to me more God they've shown me things in my life I needed to see they show me as you probably said the secret to serving Christ is to increase your service give more of yourself to Jesus as time goes on Lord it's discern things in the churches I know but I'm aware of you are so we thank you Lord in order to think that so much Lord you thought so much of this series in 1960 that you said unknown tongue after unknown tongue after prophecy after prophecy as you prophet preached these and then you ended it by sending down the pillar of fire in the tabernacle Lord God to vindicate the fact that you were interpreting this portion of Scripture to your bride nor it makes help me Lord Jesus the light I just pretty bless the Saints that came out that's those live streaming we all just came for one purpose the Lord let your word flow through us Lord leaders fear might flow through us and we might be true Christians and Jesus Christ every said god bless you see you there praise God so again we'll look at the RT of interchange I just said everybody know my family is at Lakeside it's near is near Kelly's Island it's like our vacation you know and sometimes I'll do that you know if we have three services every week times 52 weeks my maths right that's 156 services so one or two of them I let them stay you know just relax because they're so far away and plus we're planning on letting them stay and I was going to come back and preach but plus Karis is sick she was throwing up three times last night I was up from 3:00 a.m. till 6 a.m. I fell back asleep after that after everybody else got up but she's sick so we pray for her you know that God would keep her in touch that's where my family is at tonight and so I just want everybody know about that by the grace of the Lord I think that's all I want to say so let's look at this here again you know this is part 7 I like to finish in 7 7 is a good finishing number you know the seven days of creation seven churches and everything so and of course you know on this thought we've reviewed that quite often we call it where Columba is ministry there and let's begin here I'm going to look at tonight I'm going to look at the main part we're going to end with is the stars because because one of the reward was the star so he gives you the morning star that's verse 28 actually didn't read that forgive me I'll read it that revelation 228 forgive me and I'll give him the morning star so we're in end with looking at some natural stars you know it in the stars in the Bible look at just a few facts about stars I'll tell you I started studying it it's way over my head okay I can't explain radiation I can't explain plasma I just I'm not there but we know the stars are real you know we know there's great facts about it but jesus said if you overcome Satan I'll give you the Morningstar who's the Morningstar Christ and I'm going to give you myself what a problem how many want that reward you get it but the Bible said in Revelation 21 he overcomes inherits all things you get every reward from every Church age if you overcome in your day hallelujah so that's what I serve the Lord I want to serve only be more like Christ and I want I want to glorify Him praise God I believe his promises are for us so the promise of those dark days so 20 verses 24 and 25 that's why we didn't read it as I knew we'd read it here in the sermon Jesus says but I say to you and unto the rest of Thyatira as many as have not in this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which you have already hold fast till I come program said now before we go to the promised let me show you again that the church has spoken up by the spirit in this book has two vines whose inter winding branches composed are actually speaking to two different churches in here right but as I say to you and unto the rest of Thyatira as many of us have not this doctrine what doctrine was of the doctor who Jezebel so we go back here look at that map again remember the spirit of Jessica the doctrine of Jezebel started taking over here it started off as just a saying you know and then it came into a doctorate then it came into the Pope and then it came into the Roman Catholic Church ruling here and they had the doctrine of Jezebel which was what a woman ruling over the church right in the case it was a false Antichrist fear it was the Roman Catholic Church it was human leadership it was Satan's leadership ruling over the people right that's what the spirit of Jezebel was we labored on that the woman the Roman Catholic Church dominated the church rather than the Holy Spirit dominating the church so that's what was happening here so let me skip back to where we were so he says but as I say to you it and on the rest of those in Thyatira as many as have not this doctrine see we don't have that doctrine here the Roman Catholic churches the denominations will not rule over us the word rules over us how many would say them were the word rules over you it's not the church bylaws you'll have to have those for legal purposes but that's not really what rules us it's the word praise God and a true church and we buy something the word that we've forgotten the bylaws we should put in the bylaws is it's just a it's just a way to govern the church you have to have that now bad except there it is Christ is speaking to the two groups one has the doctrine the other doesn't there they are scattered abroad across the nations with each one's doctrine opposing other one is of God knowing his depths the other is safety knowing the depths of Satan so did you catch that in verse 24 the true church does not know the depths of Satan the true church knows the depths of God praise the Lord and that's what he's saying here one has the depth of God the other has the depths of saints you'll see you're going to go deeper when one way or the other as we show it on Sunday you're going to get either closer to God or further away from God after this service right you learn one of the other we got to go deeper in Christ or deeper into sin what we want to go deeper in Christ amen and how we'll do that is by obeying the doctrine of Christ I want to drop us in here because to true doctrine is the same that is the Holy Spirit truth because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth so we have a true doctrine it has to be the true Holy Spirit teaching it right it has to be because the Bible's of the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth if you teach true things then the true spirit must be behind that number brother Hamza that's one thing say you can't do he can't preach the word by word by word you can't preach a full true sermon right yet you can't live a full Christian life you get old true Christian doctrine but the power of God in us will accomplish that amen because remember it's more than just doctrine as more than just well cerfancy one God water baptism it's more than that right because those are all true things but you have the power behind that in other words you got to obey those things and then you got to be able to have faith in Christ and operate the power of God and once you have all that David head he got out of the word plus power and that's what they were astonished at Jesus when Jesus preached they were astonished at his teaching because his word was with power not only did he teach the right thing he had the power of God behind it hey hey right he had signs wonders and miracles so did Paul Paul smoked eel eel itis blind number that and they the Bible said the deputy looked at this when they saw what was done they were astonished at the doctrine of the Lord I didn't know God allowed this God would give a temporary judgment on somebody for trying to stop somebody else from here in the Word of God that's part of the doctrine of God in other words God gives temporary punishments upon people never seen it mother grandma gave an example he said if somebody runs from God they'll put them on their back in the hospital praise the Lord like I told a brother that recently left this church I said the reason you're having surgery is because you're running from God and he's laying he laid on his back in a hospital running from the Lord is that right that's the doctor that's the teaching if you don't run to God and you try to run away from God and if your God shouted he's going to come after you direct you right that's 1st Corinthians 5 right Paul said get that other church who's sleeping with his stepmother and give him over to Satan that his soul might be safe see that's the doctor to the Lord like I told you I teach a lot of doctrine but I know when people are hungry and pulling on the Word of God God does miracles I love that every time somebody needs something forgot it goes upon the preaching when I'm preaching God can help them amen I can show you the dates that happen because I read right now the servant days would be what a testimony I could I can show you the days that people pull the healing out of the Holy Spirit through a Kip and so for you you can go back and say well this is when God touches me this is when God healed me some of God saved me and you go back and show and the Holy Spirit when you're pulling upon the Word of God and that's what we're talking about now we read this a few weeks ago although Timothy take heed to yourself so what is your life creature that's what I try to do watch your life take heed watch yourself and unto the doctor be careful what you teach continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and then the early that's why I cried out to God before I preached to you because I want to be saved and I want you to be saying whatever church you go to God leads away from here you want a feature that will preach something that will save them and save you nice and Lord because your Shepherd is going to lead you one way or the other deeper into God or deeper to Satan that right that's what's going to happen it's going to happen because the word doctor means instruction or learning we have to come to church to learn something praise God and even if it's just one thing praise the Lord because you've all gone to classes where you didn't learn a whole lot in that class but if you got one thing on that class wasn't worth it absolutely that's right because remember this is you know you can learn something to remember Jesus had to teaches disciples the doctrine of prayer and fasting for miracles he said howbeit this kind goeth this Devils these Devils don't go out but by prayer and fasting so see there's doctor that will help us to do miracles how many believe that that's why doctors are born we got to teach well this is the kind of situation we need a pass and pray and I met her church I remember fasted and prayed and then Christopher was healed just I think a month after that - we came here with prayer and fasting in that church of you well last year and just wasn't a matter I've been you know II told brother Jose remember the Samuel Boavista pray forth Jose brother Jose sent me the printout from the doctors statement saying that he has no more cancer that was a few months if everybody got forgot the dead government we prayed and fasted and God healed the boy and they sent the picture he said the Jose said that they sent it to him he said to me CY doctrine is so far you have to teach people how to get the channel the Holy Spirit and then wait upon God till he does it and praise the Lord let me just make something in here I just you know this okay to me you know something I just mentioned a little earlier you know this thought kind of came to me if we're not getting much out of church services there's something we can do about that let me give you let me give you a type when you eat every meal does it have to be a brand new food you've never eaten before does it have to be yeah no I think the same thing almost every week and I love it this is where you'll receive your natural diet because as a pastor you know I know a lot of those things keep coming up over and over the services but Church how is God going to lead us into algebra if we don't all do the ABCs I want to go deeper in Christ I'm going but we've got to obey the ABCs first to get through the algebra understand that so so does four servings I feel like the Holy Spirit like as I prayed every set was every Saturday for services and this is what the Lord places of all my heart I'm preaching this what brother Branham said I'm trying to teach what just for brother Graham say but if it feels like it's not fresher and new then you have to take the tight to the natural well I'm tired of the same food at home if all you have is broccoli every Tuesday night oh we only have fish and Roxy every Wednesday night if you're hungry it doesn't matter you're happy to eat it and brothers you better be your wife you'll be kind of disappointed in your head it might hurt her feelings well Friday night pizza night oh well we had pizza last party but if you're hungry it doesn't matter and so see that's the thing let me come to church and we hear the same thing or it feels like there's nothing new then we got to be careful are we feed on why are we hungry for the word of God maybe it's because we're other things we shouldn't be feeding up sometimes I would sometimes out of my fast food on the way home I was really hungry and I come to suffer and my wife would say why aren't you hungry i slaved over the you know that she wouldn't say that but she didn't slave over the food in the kitchen why I was not hungry because I ate something else are you understand so people go to church and they're not hungry for the preacher why because they're feeding on other things they're watching like a brother told me a good testimony said brother Jeff since I did this now he did this he did a huge sacrifice for the penal got recently I'm not going to tell you you might be able figure it out but a brother gave a huge sacrifice for the kingdom of God I'm talking about thousand dollars and lots of time and he come back and said brother Jesse I've been on a cloud nine sins he said I've only watched two videos on YouTube the last two or three weeks so what was he telling me he was telling me before that sacrifice he was spending too much time on YouTube and then she said hey man so see he's feeding on that but then when he gets away from that sacrifice and dedicates all this time to God and really gets into a chair the Holy Spirit that was not being on that any morning the words become more alive that help hope that helps you that helps me that's why I wrote it down here because I was praying here I know let me make sure I see that so I can eat the same thing every Monday I could have this every morning I can have a bowl of granola and yogurt I'm as happy as a lark I'm just a happiest guy because I'm hungry for it I've developed a taste for it and if you've developed a taste for this message you're hungry for it a night the word is that right that's right and so see we've got to take that approach know what we say what you know so Jessie teach a lot of doctor what that but the doctrine is so you can understand the things of God and you can start and we can all start operating more in it don't want I bring more net absolutely praise God so I just want to lay that out there that'd just give that testimony see the Word of God is fresh into just if we're only feeding on that but if we snack on things of the world won't taste so good right so we don't want to do that so that's one lay that in there by God's grace now but man moves on to this Jesus says out put upon you no other burden remember the burden was to just work more work for Jesus that was the burden of Thyatira just work more you're the Ox anointing number just labor just give yourself as a sacrifice just give more to Christ motor Adam says that the word for burdens weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages or Thyatira was either bend or be broken but out to the Catholic Church or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each a each had its pressures now program stops there that's the pressure of Thyatira now the yellow here he goes into our pressure remember our pressure just as they had the pressure you either join our church or die our pressure is this right here the pressure of riches you better make more money you better get rich you better that's the same question so just just never got the pressure but we both have pressure soft living all you have to sacrifice so let's just take it easy don't pass and pray it don't get more time to God just relax rest I don't get me wrong we all need rest and if not you're going to going to have a heart attack look I'm warning people don't go too hard you're gonna have a heart attack so if you like your health suffer and you need to rest more what if it just well you know you have to do that if you got plenty energy but you're not doing some for God and we're living too soft and the third thing is nervous tension Saint wants to make us so nervous you got a battle that constantly nervousness attention got do this and got it that got do that well right now said these are our pressures in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in so true this for age seems to have had a clear-cut burden it was to defy Rome stand up for the word even in the Dead Sea that was their burn defy Rome what's our burden defy riches defy soft living defy tension I won't be nervous why because price is giving me peace a that we were there at Lake area now there's a sign they put up and said what does peace mean to you and some people wrote all vacations and sunsets and parents in love and I wrote peace has a name Jesus Christ what does peace mean to you Christ a yeah so see Saint wants it make us nervous and oh you gotta do this go do that let me tell you something to give you let me remind you the secret pray before you start your dad put everything in prayer say God I hope you get that everything I need to get done I know you'll do it pray before here to watch God bring everything to pass and and this is I've had more responsibility as time has gone on first I was just pastor and so first I was just pastor and Sunday School was superintendent and trustee now about that I'm song leader treasurer and deacon and church and I'm plus I got more kids right and I got more jobs as scrum not only do I teach I got to do a CTA rep I got in other things I got Bible club on top of that and I just had more and more responsibilities what's the heat of that how do you balance everything prayer but Branson Martin Luther as time went on he had more jobs and more responsibilities the way he had everything was praying more amen if you have more job you need more prayer amen that's the only way people how do you handle that brother someone's brother left a note on there how do you handle it's like you have to do everything to the terms how do you handle that and I just say it just God's grace but prayers the key because we'll all have heard is we all have nervous but we have a choice we can either become nervous or we can have peace about it a maid that Christ will help me so listen church here's our three Rick pressures these are legacy of pressures soft living riches and nervous you but here is three sides that you're hot for Christ member that is three Senate so there's three tensions but there's three sides you're hot what is it a passion to know the word the second thing a fervent desire I just want to please God and the third they reach out and cry out for things in the spirit all God do signs wonders and miracles use me for your kingdom help me to win souls amen hoping to be led by the Holy Spirit so see prayer prayers and all he's coming to church you know reading your Bible just these simple things if we do the simple things as they taught these things will feel like the burdens happening and Jesus will break those feathers hey that isn't set here there hallelujah he'll break those fetters that's right amen church alright let's keep going here now Jesus says they have not known the depths of Satan so the true church does not know the depths of Satan Clarett makes this comment it seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase actually it is simple to know what is meant let us first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the depth of Satan so by the RAM gives us the scripture for the depth of God there's action scriptures that says what the depth of God it is you want to see it it's Ephesians 3:16 if you don't want you I'm gonna show it to you I know you want to do Ephesians 3:16 is the depths of God here's here's what a depth of God is that he would grant to you accorded the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man so what is being deep in God having God's strength inside of you amen just going inward with God's strength in you gon know yo coming over coming to church whatever God's going to the grocery store go in there with the strength of God that is the depths of God that Christ may dwell in your hearts by fate so what is it how do you go deeper in God letting more of him and live in you having them always on your heart always have his words on and songs upon your lips and all these things that's the depth of body that being rooted and grounded in love so you're just so as the best iPhone app said what evidence all the ghost is being so in love for God you just want to do something for God a man you may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God so this is a death of God just keeping Christ on your lips having a strong inner inner being you know having the Holy Spirit in you so you're ready to talk to it someone who doesn't know about God you know I've had a lot of times with family this weekend they've asked you about different things I'm able to say well we follow brother Rams message I've been able to share that with them and just ready to share it my god that's great so I'm prayed up I'm studied up I can't wait for the nasty praise God anybody able to say that with the family members you know he's from Jefferson deal and prophet and all these things you know and so we want to have that fullness in us so we see you know we we pray and we're always we're ready to give an answer for the hope that life is entertainment 1st Peter 3:15 says that now according to these verses when a man experiences the death of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the Spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the death of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this so now know the depth of God is of the Satanism depth of God is having a personal experience Oh crisis with you all the time you're ready to you know you're fully anointed you know you're on fire the depth of Satan is he tries to destroy that and it seems like God's far away and I can't do nothing for God you ever been there never been battled you know he says he's tried to defeat you my man says Satan will always attempt to make a substitute for the reality of God I don't care about my life you ever get yourself down on that thought we always battled my buddy right we always thought that he don't care about you oh gods don't do nothing in your life God I want to use is there even a God say get behind me Satan Manny the Word of God is true amen he's a reality but only if I don't feel to our life and I'm going to press it until I've you freeze to the heart because I know it's a reality how does they do it you will take away the knowledge of the truth of God destroy the word by putting forth his own yeah I've gotten are you sure there's going to be a rapture are you sure mother Brenda was a prophet are you sure that was thus saith the Lord see how he does that he's always making him doubt the promises of God right he will then substitute the personal Christ in our myths in church when those times what you must you do but Graham said just be like Jesus go back to the word it is written it is written the biggest Christian when he falls to his knees and hopes the Word of God can defeat Satan at any time any place at any moment a man just go to the word go to your prayer and quote the Word of God and watch God's word for bail amen another guy I'll just be honest you over an hour ago Lake Erie there's all kinds of women robbed walk around all kind of in modesty and I've been such victory by just put my head down and say Lord Jesus on to say something just go to the scripture I know you're watching me and my heart is going to be pure before yay men and I'm going to get the victory praise guy got an act that actively say those things up so what about I'm walking in the depths of God passing on any petty should end abomination that's why I hate more weather sometimes much something hate as I don't like to if I don't like to go certain places with the weather's hot I like hot weather I don't like to snow so much but I got it we got all going to be careful then have certain battles women have other battles and how do we overcome it by not doubting the word putting our full confidence in the Word of God he's my strength thing bet he will do it as he calls Israel to the same by human being reigning as king instead of God this is Sadie saying we'll let a human reign over the people rather than Christ now here's what I was going to get to on Sunday I never got his remember when I mentioned this on Sunday here are Satan's biggest deception the born-again experience will be rejected in vain for a church joint that is Satan's biggest deception he lets people join the churches but they're not born again and they go further than the depths of Satan rather going in the onus of the Deaf's of God well how do you know what we have to come to church right because I preach all the time while the Bible preaches it all the time Jesus preached it all the time that was his example always going to church but you see he wanted to go to church but not go deeper in Christ but see we got to go to church and go deeper in Christ and it's going to take what a reality it's going to take passing down anything that would keep us from our first love we've got to keep all that sin up and then we'll go deeper in Christ get stronger in Christ it's exactly right the depths of Satan had been entered into in that age and the fruit of that death of Satan which our lives murders and horrible crimes came forth from it see that's my turn I can look at my life and I know I've been pastoring here 11 years I can look back over 11 years and I can see God is taking me deeper in him because I don't see these things I don't see lies murders it even spiritualize it and even spiritual murders and horrible crimes I don't see that my life I see fruit of the Spirit I see patients I see forgiveness I see long-suffering I see love and power see that's what we must Steve we must look at our lives and say my very good fruit of the Spirit or not god help us to bear the rice banana and this should be the birth of every message church do we have born-again experiences or just church joiners that's what we need me the board again extremes nice job on the do you amen now let's look at the rewards here I got a few more but I got more in a few I got about 24 sighs well some of them go faster than others like some of them are just visuals of stars I just wanted and the solar system in the galaxy I just want to again show this just to give us an idea of how great God is now the rewards we read this earlier Eve overcometh and keepeth my works to the end to him when I get a power of the nations now we preach on that a few weeks ago remember my dear son I know thy works for that boat you were here you guys were like you I ended that sermon by showing out Milgram said if we do God's works for the end will rule over nations so I've already kind of showed that reward so I'm not going to later on that so much because we've already showed that those that do the works of God than the faith of God and therein the bride of God and they live in the at holy city the future home that's right and they sit on Christ seat in judgment as well amen now he says that he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith others that finishes the chapter and now we're to go to the church age book comments on this okay then we're going to close the stars from the Bible we'll look at some scriptures on the stars now I think you'll be blessed I was so stirred up by looking at those scriptures about mine am I really a sorry I believe I am a pain by the moon as well yes I'm the mood but I'm also sorry see because you can fit both types we'll look at that just a moment the moon represents the church right and the stars represent believers so you have both your bold types so we get to that I'm going to close with that he that overcometh and keepeth my works to the end Aram said it's very evident from the remarks of the sphere on works that the Lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentioned work so does God now he works yes God wants to see us doing righteous works and now he says that he who keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be giving power over the nation's and will be a strong capable unbending ruler who can code so powerfully listen it with any situation you get in other words you can handle any situation that comes your way no matter who comes to rebuke you no matter who comes to correct you no matter who comes to cut you out no matter who comes to tell you lie about you or make you look evil you can stand out on the word and handle any situation by the Holy Spirit ah that's what I want right here I want the character of Christ to handle any situation that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if you need me so see if you keep Jesus said if you keep my words to the end you'll be like a ruler who breaks all their enemies in with a rod of iron a head look at that hallelujah so see this is quite a statement Jesus says the works you have to overcome by doing the works now can I take this one moment here let me I was working on this sermon and I didn't get to about an ellipse let me just go down to smooth over these real quick I got to a lot of works for women this week number I was preaching on I know that works here some works for our sisters doing alms deeds like selling coats and garments for people God recognize that as a woman doing a good work modest clothing is a works for women that's a work they do shame face of this like humility sobriety's stayin sober you know no serious and focused on the Lord not silliness childbearing silent learning that's a word for God when our sister sits there silently learns and doesn't try to free them which nobody does in our church we're dead but with that full subjection to husbands the Bible said his good work that's a good work hide it to get home keeping the home a real holy place that's a work of a sister so sisters say well I don't do nothing for God but if you're doing this if you're creating a rather atmosphere at home you're working for God it's not going to get to this but I want to drop it in here to encourage our sisters tonight I'm requiring there I'm sorry requiring their parents I'm sorry never quote that well I didn't look that up so I spelled that wrong and I didn't look it up so forgive me I don't have that supplications and prayers Nate and I still pray every day pray every night bring up your a sugar knowledge of the Lord Lodge strangers now a woman can only do that you know if her husband was there we don't have male/female alone right or like brother Graham's mother member she she turned her house into a boarding house or in other words a motel when a Charles died so see she would have rooms that had locks on the door so she she had her own room locked yourself in there you know at nighttime and then men would stay at her house and rent it out like a you know like a hotel I won't work something if it a wash the Saints D how many systems do that you see that's that's a good work that's why we need to do communion pretty soon it's been well I think Easter was last time do communion let me do that again by God's grace relieved the afflicted anytime our sisters are see someone who's afflicted and going through a hard time if you try to bring any relief to them you've done a good work and then guide the house that kind of goes with your piety at home things like that and brothers I didn't get a whole lot of time to go through those but there's a lot of works for meto and preaching loving their wives not provoking the children providing for your own family so you go to work that's a good work to do but God you know that there's more examples I didn't get to and then there's works for everybody like if you clothe the naked or if you feed those who don't have daily food those are works Jay said that's that's more that's faith in action when you help somebody out so male or female helping our people is a good word for God and Jesus said if you do this to the end you'll rule over Nations hey you think we should not take these things lightly because if we do these things I'm talking about a page to I'm talking about all these other you know keeping the whole just we wouldn't say simple things but if we do that he makes us rule over nations all right what a promise Church right remember Anna she ministered in Temple my prayers and fasting I didn't get to those but if we look at the sinful works we'll know what the opposite is like keeping your body pure from any sexual sin or death that's another work a good work of God worshiping in the spirit and truth you know able from blood came raw fruits and what does that represent today you must bring the Holy Ghost worship right the life of God we must operate fruits that's not something that doesn't have life in it we must our worship must have life in it but what's that we want our hearts must be burden for the word glory and if we're rich which is all of America Church which is all of us we must have a portion of our money that we set aside to give to the poor maybe do it through your offerings maybe you know but those that are rich in the world must be ready to distribute Paul told Timothy he says all those rich people they got to be ready to distribute so we're all rich here we are we're all rich whether we like it or not get out compared to the rest of the world so is that not by God's grace like I said I need to go through all the men works for our men here I sure got to go through the sisters oh that helps our sisters tonight by God's grace oh come on kid open that you're joking I try this yeah the trouble earlier I'm not surely still no oh come on tell me about tribal of another one here and then see that little bit of it all right praise the Lord amen amen forgive me yeah now I want to bring this point out to you member this club let me have said none this is not the church ages this is perfect faith he says perfect faith is a master of all circumstances now the reason I brought us focus brother Graham said when you're really anointed you can hit you can cope with any situation you're not scared anybody comes up to you and bring up your passion Jesse I read when you did this in high school you can stand there and say that's the old me that's not the new Jesse that's the old dead man that's the sinner Jesse not on the saint amen amen I brought it up because he said we have to be able to handle every circumstance brother have says perfect faith is the master of all circumstances what's faith face faith is the evidence of things not see it's a substance of things not seen so what is a holy spirit perfect faith masters all circumstances programs it no matter what it is a masters it now just watch when you believe anything you anything that you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances that don't have one thing to do with it see a masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the Lord's reveal that this certain things going to happen you just speak it and go on now I put a note here now notice Romans 7 19 st. Paul did not master every circumstance but the faith of Christ in him did so should I mean in other words we are going to fail in certain circumstances but faith will try us or faith will strike us for the next time and the next time we can be a master that circumvent every single before like for example when I first got hired and teeth to teach I was real real nervous around my principles would it witness very much but after a few years after a few failures I'll be honest I'd ask God to forgive me I didn't stand up from things I was real nervous you know just real nervous after a few years I remember my second principal I walked in the office one time and he pulled out it was 2011 I remember that he put up a website and he's on the website it did you know the world is going to end tomorrow cool and Saturday was that old man made the prediction that the world was going to head on that Saturday 2011 you probably member that yeah I forget his name he died now which I'm not surprised because he used the name of Lord and predicted the end of the world and did happen and he missed it twice hit remember his name's Emily remember his name okay remember his anyways he predicted that in the world and my principal was a homosexual and I knew it but let me show you I was ashamed before my old boss because I was young but I failed but God gave me Burton faith so he said you know the world's going to end tomorrow and I looked right at him and I said no sir it's not going to end tomorrow I said you know why because the Bible said you should not fear any man who makes a prediction in the name of Lord and it doesn't come to pass and this man has already predicted that in the world and it failed and the Bible said that you should not fear him it's not going to end tomorrow amen now a few years before by the Amen I would not have been able to say that but my boss was in there open homosexual there I am quoting the Word of God to it hey man what masters that circumstance I did shy words and what about them is he later so I can talk about things of God you're homosexual ops I want to bed you I stood right here on the word what was it it was faith and her buffet masters that situation you know he such a sentence it um interesting and that was it but see I just stood there and now notice even if we never talked about it afterwards but the point is the next day came and he had to admit Jesse was right about that right because he prophesied the name of Lord and it didn't go the best and this is on that day God answer for that that was one time I a believer spoke the word to him and he should recognize that's the Spirit of Truth and he could have submitted that he could salt for more of that right because he saw the Word of God in action amen I like that and I didn't play to say that that just Haiti need always hear about that to me because before I'd be scared to witness to my principal but give me a few years give me some time in prayer and watch perfect bathing master every circumstance they met all said there are things when I want to do good I get people so there's times that we will fail because we are not the master of every circumstance faith is the master of every circumstance Christ is the master of every circumstance then Christ in us masters every circumstance Amen I just want to make sure I've differentiate that because every time you just think well I'm the master you'll fail and you'll maybe start doubting this close you always have this quote you have to know it's not me it's Christ in me amen now rotor I'll get back to this stuff about how will rule over nations he says the believers demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very sons in other words we don't rule like Christ's rule he's God this Laurentian is very amazing I read this on Sunday if you remember that this is going to be very amazing when God's children can rule like Jesus did on earth when we can master every situation like Jesus did he's a man that that will be very amazing so when religious people come and give you questions about the Bible and not the fart wonder Jesus didn't shy away what'd he do sometimes he would question what what what do you say about it right and he never said well we believe John the Baptist or not you know but you know the Scriptures I'm talking about of it sometimes he answered their questions with questions sometimes he just told them the truth from the beginning it was not so about marriage and divorce so see he mastered every circumstance so we have to see our lives becoming more like Christ when were confronted when we have you know battles with unbelievers or religious people we must see ourselves getting the victory praise God which is just as simplest standing and not bending not compromising on what we believe praise God not compromising on what we believe that's standing on the word raise God hope that makes sense our power must be just like the sons we must overcome every detractor every deceiver every deceiver men every false preacher whoever it is we must overcome that amen now it was on but let us look at this promise in the light of the age powerful role mistake back in and joining I'm sorry employ two kings and armies and legislators breaks and grinds all before it she's killed millions and hungers to kill millions more who will not bow to her she entirely sets up kings or brings them below whenever she can yeah or gay her interference has actually caused nations to fall because she has determined to destroy the elect of God this is all what Satan did during the fire to church each her works are the worst the devil for she murders and lies as did he but there is coming a day where the Lord is going to say bring these my enemies the forum meet and slay them now let's turn their booklet we're not hearing the whole parable but this parable is very much similar to Matthew 25 in the parable of the five teams remember that parable let's go to Luke 19 I just want to show this real quick this really bless my heart and I won't I won't linger on this like I said I won't think around this one I hope you let it preach the whole thing tonight I know that to why I preach the old very well but not tonight if you let him do that tonight now in Luke 19:11 227 we have the parable it's a very similar parable to the parable talents I want you to see this year let's look at verse 15 and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he could commanded these servants to be called in to him to whom he had given the money that they might know how much every man had gained by training the very similar thing Jesus goes away he left them with money then he comes back later so what'd you do with my money right Jesus left and he gave us what he gave us gifts he gave us actual money too you know he gave us all these resources he's going to come back to say what'd you do with it what I do is it what you do is look at the hood he answers he look at verse 16 then came the first saying lord I have gained ten pounds by a tenfold increase that's a pretty good increase I'm not a financial guy but that's pretty good verse 17 he says he said to him well now good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little have valid or T over ten one sees remember rule over nations here this rule over cities I can't imagine that church I don't know I can hardly rule on finances you know sometimes I wonder about that how has God let me rule I always gave my tithes and offerings you know I try to get all to try to these things but it seems like I never get where I want to get you know understand what I'm saying if you know hi I'm trouble if I have to nervous about this how could I will over ten cities but jesus said if you're faithful with your finances paid with our talents you'll rule over cities not just cities but those cities must be part of nations that's right now you know the next one right verse 18 and the second came saying Lord I found a paid five pounds and he said likewise then behold also the over five cities so see it's the same kind of thing as the parable of five talents if you're faithful what it gives you it makes you will over much now the last person was the faithful you know Jesus says come you'll slay them things like that so does everybody see how that connects to that tonight if you're if you do the worst of God he'll make you rule over nations right and here's another example if you're faithful with what God gives you the rule over cities now those are red-letter eternal words I believe it madam says that's what is happening here at the church age then shall the righteous be with their Lord when his righteous indignation will fall upon the blasphemers the righteous coming with him in glory shall destroy the who destroyed the earth and made havoc on the saints of God this was the age of turning the chief of terrible distress but a day is coming with true shocker male and who shall stand it inspired me safe only the redeemed of the Lord Hey now here's I want to get you this one we can do and I want to try finished about 10 minutes over and I will give him the morning star oh here's the reward keep working for Jesus keep working for Jesus and the reward is the morning star to rule and I'm giving you the morning star according to revelation 22:16 2nd Peter 1:19 Jesus is the morning star the spirit therefore is making a promise to the elect of the Dark Ages relative to himself and then in the ages to come and we've already stated Jesus identifies himself with the messengers of each age they receive from him the revelation of the word for his period this word revelation reigns the elect of God out of the world and into full union with Jesus Christ now how you feel I know that's happened to me I was I started the world and I didn't draw out of the room and I'm brought into the fullness of Christ how do I know it's happened to be I used to never love Church I hated turns I hated any of these things I hate the sake of my life but now I love of a man a man I know is happy to be Church these messengers are called stars because they shine with a borrowed light or reflected light of the Sun even Jesus see the messengers were just stars like Jesus they're also called stars because they are holders of the light at night thus and the darkness of sin they bring the light of God to his people hello this is the Dark Ages it is especially dark for the word of the Lord is almost entirely hidden from the people now is your the most high is almost ceased death has overcome vast numbers of the believers until their ranks are decimated so there's very few Christians the things of God at the lowest add to this state and it seemed this second would surely conquer God's people now look at some of this if ever of people needed a promised embrace in the land where there is no night it was the people of the Dark Ages and that is why the sphere is promising them the Morningstar ha and that a beautiful there the darkest of all ages so Jesus gives us the bow so if you live for me I'll give you the morning side because it's so dark I'll give you the brightest thing there is I'll give you my life amen he's telling that that the Chiefs are even Jesus who twelve and light under which no man can approach will in the future Kingdom illuminate them by his own personal presence he would not be using the Stars or messengers that give light in the darkness any longer it will only it will be Jesus himself speaking of face to face as he shares his kingdom with them so did you guess that after we get new bodies and every gold the millennium and into the future hope we're not gonna need the seven messengers anymore because Christ is the light but right now we need the light the brother Adam rose because Christ Himself isn't here we need that we need that seven star don't we need to listen those things we may hear brother branham amen that's why we must not worship brother Branham or any other man in the blood of the future Oh God will not use brother Graham to be a light like he did when brother Brandon was upon the earth Christ will be the light once Jesus arrives will not need the messengers anymore because we will be changed into a mortal being but until then we need the light of brother ends message got to keep going back to the message whatever Graham say what the messengers say why is he's God's car is an amen amen hallelujah now getting back to the quote here's her program finishes it and I'm going to starzone be brief on them it is the morning started it's visible by the light of the Sun commences to shine when our Sun Jesus comes there will be no further need of messengers he will bring us his message of cheer himself and as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter in our perfect day what else could we desire above Jesus himself well or to me what brother and sister the only reward we want is Jesus hey man why because he is the light he said he's like she's everything is that he everything even perfect everything amen he hath an ear let him hear what the spirit stayed to the churches amen even so Lord God by thy spirit let us hear thy truth you know church for years I was raised in church for years I heard preaching about streets of gold and it never did anything to me to me for years I heard preaching about mansions I don't care I've never made nothing to me I didn't care about the mansions I don't care I have the smallest house I don't care what it is I just want to see Jesus amen he's the one that died for me I don't really I mean we want to hurt her worse but we just do them because we love the Lord again those things have never met no a goal that's as clear as a crystal glass city you know as gold as clear as a crystal of that we can't explain that I don't even care about that I just want to see the nail prints in his hand a man I want to see the the prints in his feet I would have CD web I don't ask him you know all the questions I've had praise God and I would hear his answers hey head and I want to worship Him and just lay his feet and throw my crown at his feet say thank you you're the one that helped you overcome it hey what's your shred that help me earth this problem only through you I could do the same thing you see that so we won't get brother branham once we get new body change but until then we need his message image was the doctrine of God amen the doctrine of God now let's close the stars here what is a star now this is the things I can't explain all the way so you have to bear with me of stars any massive self luminous celestial body of gas that shines by radiation derived from its internal energy sources of the tens of billions of trillions of stars composing the observable universe only a very small percentage or visible to the naked eye you can't even see we can't even see very little fraction so what's a star a star has energy inside itself that burns on its own and that's why I want to tie the gear it has its own energy it doesn't get energy from anything else it's got its own energy praise God and that's what we're supposed to be stars burning with our own energy I don't have you amen that's enough you're right not to get an idea here I just want to get you an idea of the galaxies again so you can start understanding this here's the earth the earth is a part of our solar system right the solar system is a part of this Milky Way galaxy the Milky Way galaxy is part of a local group of galaxies a local group of galaxies is a part of a local supercluster and thus there's many super clusters in the known universe billions and trillions of stars and jesus said I'll give you the morning star if you overcome I will give you the morning star I'll give you an illuminating light I'll give you a burning energy that will be beyond anything you could ask her thing amen I'll be what is that that's eternal life amen exactly right just to give you a thought on this we see part of the Milky Way from Earth we can see this galaxy that we're living and this was taken in Yosemite National Park in California you ever go there bad you're Ontario since the origin okay you did no kidding Gloria there's times of the year where you can see part of that and help you a galaxy right than that that's what you see just weren't just up we're just up speck in that spiral ring out so we go back weird so part of that this is what we saw part of this we're right here but we can see part of that just in California you can see that because of the glory of God now this is an RVT can do it justice neither can you I mean your computer they can look pretty good on your computer man but this TV can't give justice it must be an old model but it's so glorious I mean the star such a this source of strength now the the Britannica says the Sun is the star on which the earth and other components of the sources are involved it is the dominant body of the system constituting more than 99% of its entire mass in sources of the Sun is the source of an enormous amount of energy a portion which provides earth with the light and heat necessary to support life now did you know a solar system all stays intact by the pull of the Sun understand that the Sun goes on all the planets right and that's called the gravitational pull so the Sun is pulling all of all the parts of the solar system it's keeping them in place because the Sun is falling on them who's pulling on you to come to church tonight amen who's pulling on you to keep your prayer life and I we've got it's the Sun it's Christ a to heaven if you didn't have that pull you would just fly further away from the Sun right the earth pfeiffer the rate of the Sun and everything would die I say thank God that I feel the polling and see what people wander away from church it's very serious wonder away from God they eat cold on God and they left their god-given position wondering listen that this is the greatest better and father listened to today well Graham said but when everybody stays in their position like our solar system he said what do you have you have a solar system you have a New Testament church that's why I begin to all get into our position and stay right where God wants us and stay attracted to the Sun we can see more of God aim ahead we've seen God is able you see God he listen but we can see more of God if we can just get into position but see he's pulling on me praise God the sun's radius I'm just going to blow your mind away with just like my mind was blown away miles really the sun's radius is a hundred times the 109 times that of Earth here's the radius from the center to the outward circumference of the body the sons of ass is 330 thousand times out of earth the mass is just amount of matter that something has the average distance from the - the Sun is 93 million miles because sometimes it gets closer to the Sun right when it's in its orbit you know sometimes it gets so closer sometimes they'll further away so the average distance 93 million miles ah the sun's light travels at 183 thousand miles per second you know how many miles it is around the around the earth over five thousand if you go around the earth one time you've only traveled about 5,000 miles praise the Lord but light travels 183 miles per second that's the power of the lighting of the Sun and it takes eight minutes for the light to reach the Earth from 93 million miles away and Jesus says I'm the morning star I'm this one giving out the light I'm the one that can cross this distance in no time and even just like those three Hebrew children right but Christ shut down and said no Gabriel this is a god-sized job I'm going down there to stand with those three Hebrew children why did he cross all time and eternity and comes down and stand amidst the fire don't you know God wants to do that for us tonight even if it's to come into our lives in our situation and he present with us here tonight hey then because he could go so fast a minute we just must believe his promise so here's the here's the earth in comparison to the Sun I will read one time you can fit a million earths inside the Sun because the mass a million earths fit inside the Sun that's how great this is and the Sun is just an average star if you look at stars it's just average there's a lot like metal juice in and read Rigel there's all kinds of stars at a much bigger than the Sun but that's how small and insignificant earth is that's how great the Sun is now let's look at a few scriptures as we close I already took 10 minutes just give me about five more so I hit the highlights here and I'm time to preach all these - want to preach a few bible scriptures on the stars and joke 22 stars are noted for their height what makes them special is how high they are what makes an eagle special how high they can fly you see God heavenly places God is above us God is the great one right and that is what makes it so great is there so far above us now stars can be sealed according to Joe but number we've got to seal the Holy Ghost so I'm not sure how that works out a star the mouse and stars are sealed so not sure how that works stars are ordained just like us about Jesus says I've ordained you to go preach the gospel amen God ordained all the stars in their place so are we ordained stars have their own burning which is like a Holy Ghost because the Bible said did not our hearts burn within us how did it ain't men stars are they the numbered by God just like you've got a name and just like God knows the number of hairs on your head stars praise God with their life the Bible said the stars are praising God by shining the light and the bruggman said the light is the promised word manifested or visible so when we live the message of our hour about holy dressing and holy living and the baptism of Holy Ghost we are lights in this dark world and we are giving God praise just by living the word that's preached to us hey man we are the light with a manifestation this word is real mermaidman when we live it when you live this you are the light of the world we just can't sit there on paper just be a servant we've got to go live it and when we live it we're shining light in any minute and that gives God praise they've been saying one it is throne above the stars of God so stars can be angels stars can be believers others he wanted his throne above everything one you want to be the highest age you want to be higher than God higher than all the believers stars represent the seed of Abraham's that's where you and I come in the Bible says we're seed of Abraham through faith not by the blood any more not by the natural genealogy but by spiritual genealogy by believing in Christ the Bible said that stars representing the 12 tribes of Israel did you know stars represent soul-winners let's read that it's going to Daniel Cho petrified oh this is worth it to read it when you win a soul to God it's you now our become a star you are shining Daniel 12:3 we're almost to Daniel 12 in our series on which is lesson almost done with that what do you want to read that but but Adam you agree okay Daniel 12:3 thank you sir and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament that they that turn many to righteousness and sorrows forever and ever amen when we win souls and turn somebody to Christ we're shining like the night sky where that night sky dissolving the galaxy mummy Wade that's what we are we are now shining lights for God well why because our light is shining on others and it's impacting others right light you cannot exist on this earth without the Sun so it is when you pass the life of God into somebody you've now become a son to them and your light of Christ is shined out to them and life comes forth how do we be a soul winner a man as I want more than anything else is to win souls for Christ Jesus had his own star the Bible said they saw the star in the East they were in the we East that had travel west following a star so stars are guides they met right sorry guys so the Holy Spirit is up star to us it's guiding us to Christ and then they amen stars represent Christ he's taught to starve jqe Christ is the bright and Morning Star the Holy Ghost is a star because the Bible is that this is my star sermon the Dave stars are risen in our hearts member that on Easter earth angels are considered stars in Revelation 12 for because of the serpent drew a third of the stars of heaven with his tail down to earth right a third of the angels he brought with him and wandering stars we'll get to that the Bible said Cain was a wandering star remember he said God I'm a vagabond I'm a bag about it a wanderer I can't live like this people are going to kill many gods who I'll set a mark on you so he kills you what'd he do he just wander around run around he never found his close to duty you know church you should rejoice if you found your post to duty his cane never found it he just wandered here he wanted there I'm it of this getting out of that that's what people in other message well I think this is pretty good I'll go out of it I'll go out of the year I run there we got to find our position Seiler like a star headed a the head find your position and stand there how their young under the week the bible said here there are four spring one of them okay this is where there's so many seed of abraham it's as the stars of the sky multitude as the sad much is by the seashore numerable but the Bible said he tells the number the stars he caught them all by their names God knows every one of those needs those trillions of stars just like he knows every Christian a man so we cannot number the stars their innumerable to us just like the sand of the sea but God knows the number aren't you glad God knows your name God knows who you are God knows where you should be you know every single one of them here's the one who we said earlier so the day star arise in your hearts but that's the Holy Ghost is lighting on the day star rising or the rising of the Sun amen we're almost a few more here with me here Jude 1:13 is what we said earlier raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of Darkness forever see when people wonder from church and church to shows they might be lost I'll just try this one we'll see they get mad at that one I'll go to next one I get mad that one go next month they've got to confess that sinner they're going to take that same sin to the next church they're going to take that same broken heart to the next church right let me take that same scarred condition I got started this preacher hurt me or this sister hurt me and if they don't ask forgiveness for that and work that out they take that same star to the next trick that when somebody hurts on that that was her to get hurt again and the Bible says somebody hurts you don't talk to them they're choosing to be hurt no choosing to be there to rather be a victor I'm a lot teachers I want to be a victim how to be a victor other than I've known too many victims all everybody just hurt me everybody let your job to go to that go see that be a victim be a victor being overcomer amen amen because that's who rules the nations over comers hey glory let matters vote and we today sitting here one of the other is going to control us so let's cast out evil one let's take our position with the stars of the heavens under incent as the Bible says wandering stars over the book of Jude foaming out their own shame and we don't want to be wandering stars wonder if this is right I wonder if that is right I wonder if this what happened I wonder how it could be don't wander stay like those stars of the heaven as a real soldier at his post of duty stand there but leaving life and death Amon that's why I can stay here on a Wednesday night screeching of more people I know my coach to duty I know where God placed me in the star it is a solar system Academy and I understand their like I posted duty just like the Sun standard that that's positioning ahead I'm going to find my position in Christ and give it everything I got hallelujah I'm going to burn for Christ in that position and I'm just going to be an example for Christ so you should wonder the same thing now this is just introduced just for it to remind you when judgment comes many of the stars will withdraw shining your light this is quite a thing I talk about in astronomy I can't explain this but many of those bands or stars will stop shining they're out of the Bible censor the Sun the moon should go dark and the stars shall withdraw their shine and this reminds us that what the bride is off the earth when the bride goes up in the rapture the light of God goes and so God is going to show that in the skies by having those stars burn out and they're going to lose the light why because the light of the Holy Ghost just left the earth never to see that God is giving science and in the head is to show what's going to happen I would already have it on the earth the light left the real Holy Ghost left and now it's getting dark so that's in the sixth seal and on time to go that as in the the third trumpet and the fourth trumpet remember brother have said all the trumpets took place under that sixth seal for Trump let's get our feet I'm a closer to this if I get you standing I'm going to close I went over what I said forgive me but let me finish this I got three more slides just great give me a leg out here after we were side stars give eight and why do they give light to rule over the day and for signs and seasons did you know that you are given the light you're the light of Christ so you'll rule over this this dark earth and so you can be assigned to somebody else like I was assigned to my homosexual principal I was assigned to him that the Word of God is true I was assigned to him Ezekiel was made assigned to the house of his for that scripture just as the Stars your scientist is going to happen so are you and I scientists everybody else to decorate jesus said when the times the Gentiles ends there should be signs in the Sun and the moon and the stars look at Psalms 37 7 the Sun to rule the day by day for his nursing the forever the moon the stars to rule by night what's the moon represent it represents you the church it represents the life of the Sun does the moon have any power of its own any light of its own no it only reflects the light of the Sun that represents the church the church has no power its own it only reflects the light of Jesus Christ but the Bible will also see this the moon rules the nighttime it rules it visits the brightest thing in the night sky so does the church rule when Christ left the earth but now that the Bible said we're stars as well see we fit both types we're both the moon and the stars we're not wandering stars we're in position stars serving a purpose we're giving light in life to others because the Bible says here for by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ I hope you're enjoying the victory in Christ and I are you joy today great just as the Sun rules rules the day the Stars rule the night the moon rose tonight so we ruin this dark Laodicea filthiness is that rather than that our lives rule people see how do you lift this how do you do this you do it by the light of Christ I got a call from a brother that recent left the church we probably figured out who was but I got a call from him he said you know Jesse said I tell people where I'm at now that there's a man I know a pastor I know that actually lives the message and he said their friends are like no way he actually lives what he preaches I said you go to Jesse's house you will find TV stations you won't find dirty magazines he actually lives what he believes and I was just asking well thank you but that's really humped I was just humbled by that and his friends were raised domestic churches what is it if we have a real light of Christ we are we're a ruler over the sinful world there are some real stars out there and then there's our are some real people out there who are actually taking the word that they have and take it home and making their homes places the holiness amen and these young people can hardly how could something actually this message because it's not me living in its Christ living its Christ today you if it's Christ in you ain't a man you just say jesus take the wheel Jesus take the reins you rule my life for me and when you surrender it's Christ man there's one glory of the Moon and there's another glory the Stars amen there's a certain glory on the bride home she just she has no light of her own it's just Christ but there's also another glowing mind that glory that star has a self-illuminating fire inside of it it's got a self it's got power than itself it just he's burning and burning and both of them are on glory that shows us about Christ in us it's another way to look at it when amen but how does other way to look at it one way we're the moon one way we're star one way Oz we reflect a surprising another way is I've got the Holy Ghost in me and I can't stop burning hey man and we live the life of Christ in front of all these tart all these dark situations and dark people we stand there like stars of heaven you love the Lord tonight amen amen I think I'm a better coach because I could I can keep going let me just go take some I'm going to keep to be done by now do you enjoy that tonight and I hope enjoyed I should enjoyed it by God's grace amen praise the Lord but I just our heads here how many regions they bow just pray for me help me to rule in this life in this dark day help me to rule by the Holy Spirit god bless those things Heavenly Father you see those hands Lord while this message is so so packed Lord this word of God is so packed with truce father we just want to be lights we just want to be stars Lord we read it in Daniel that when we live a godly life when we live righteously Lord God and turn others to Christ we are like the brightness of the firmament of the heavens we are like a star that's burning and shining Oh God help us Lord a continue to be lights

Christ it's that couple help us to be signs Lord just as stars our side is the head of more God and finally just like the moon on that day we'll just say Lord it was your light shining off me and on that day Lord will just say well it was a fire burning in me that just kept burning and shining and glowing the light of Christ it's what you made me or God you are named me you gave me a name this is Jesus Christ your name me you place me at Akron you place me where I need to be and Lord I just stood up my position by your grace and Lord I was just the star shining for Christ Jesus that's just a night Lord and that's what reward I'm looking forward to Lord to be given the Morningstar to be given the light of all lights to be given the love of all loves to see the face of Jesus Christ just a year into your face will never be nothing else I can want more than that I don't you know my heart I don't care about streets of gold and crystal season those are all beautiful parts I know they're part of the gospel are those part of the Garden of Eden but that's not what's attracting me to obey the Word of God it's because of Christ who died for me who took my place who took my sins that I might be made righteous well granted Lord hallelujah Jesus help us to rule in this life by your light we thank you for this service in Jesus Christ's name the church said even let's just praise Him
