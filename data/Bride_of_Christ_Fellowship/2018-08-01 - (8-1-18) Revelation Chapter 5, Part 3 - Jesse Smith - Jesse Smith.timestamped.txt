[24:30] now submit we'll just do one Sunday
[24:33] service this Sunday because I want to
[24:35] make sure we get good rest before our
[24:37] trip Monday to Jeffersonville so we'll
[24:39] try to leave at 5:00 a.m. so let's talk
[24:41] about that tonight so we look forward to
[24:44] that but let's just do one Sunday
[24:45] service this Sunday
[24:48] and then we look forward to the
[24:49] Jeffersonville trip on Monday I called
[24:52] ahead and talked to sister Donna there
[24:55] at the voice of God and she said random
[24:57] Tabernacle was open from 12:00 to 4:00
[24:59] on Monday we can go any time but then
[25:01] our voice of God tours at 3:15 so voice
[25:06] of God is only 15 minutes away from the
[25:08] Branham tabernacle so we'll stay to like
[25:10] from 12:00 to 12:30 Lord willing and
[25:12] then we'll head up to the voice of God
[25:14] by God's grace so looking forward to
[25:16] that it's going to be a wonderful time
[25:17] in the Lord let's just do then one
[25:19] Sunday service
[25:20] this Sunday by God's grace also brother
[25:22] brother John and his family Sunday will
[25:25] be their last service with us so we'll
[25:28] probably invite them up on Sunday
[25:29] morning and we'll just all get in the
[25:31] line and we'll just shake their hands
[25:32] and hug them and you know give a
[25:35] official send-off pray for them and so

[25:41] for their testimony and their their
[25:44] founding members of this church back in
[25:46] 2006 and they've been with us this whole
[25:48] time so we're we're gonna miss them a
[25:50] lot
[25:50] but we can clearly see God's hand
[25:51] calling them to Michigan so we're just
[25:55] thankful for God's grace and God's
[25:56] provision God is so faithful so we'll
[26:00] just have one service and I think your

[26:07] mine so I've tried to get your variety
[26:10] of preachers and God has men speaking

[37:54] of God Malachi could you unplug my iPad
[38:01] and bring it up here please I'd like to
[38:04] go to Revelation chapter 5 tonight well
[38:08] let's look at Part 3 thank you sir
[38:09] part three of Revelation chapter five
[38:16] I'm gonna try to preach about 45 minutes
[38:18] to an hour and I sent out an email this
[38:21] morning that I want to address how
[38:24] brother Adam resigned so I want to take
[38:26] a few moments after preaching and
[38:28] address that so the church kind of knows
[38:30] about that we've tried to do that
[38:34] whenever a elected officer would resign
[38:39] we've just tried to let the church know
[38:40] so they have an understanding and so I
[38:43] like to share about that after we
[38:46] preached by the grace of the Lord so
[38:50] Revelation chapter 5 I like to start at
[38:58] verse 8 if we can I believe this is
[39:01] where we left off last Wednesday night
[39:09] thank you geez
[39:11] praise God why don't we if we could i'll
[39:20] read verses i'll read verses 8 9 10 11
[39:27] and 12 and then maybe we'll all read
[39:29] verse 13 together that's kind of what
[39:31] we'll look at tonight by God's grace
[39:32] I'll start with verse 8 but I'll stop
[39:35] when we can all read on verse 8
[39:37] I'm sorry verse 13 pardon me verse 8
[39:42] I'll read it and when he had taken the
[39:44] book the four beasts and four and twenty
[39:46] elders fell down before the lamb having
[39:49] every one of them harps and golden vials
[39:51] full of odours which are the prayers of
[39:54] saints and they sung a new song saying
[39:56] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[39:58] open the seals thereof for thou was
[40:00] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[40:02] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[40:04] and people and nation and has made us
[40:07] unto our God kings and priests and we
[40:09] shall reign on the earth and I beheld
[40:13] and heard the voice of many angels round
[40:14] about the throne and the beasts and the
[40:17] elders and the number of them was ten
[40:19] thousand times ten thousand and
[40:22] thousands of thousands talk about a
[40:26] fellowship amen talk about a church
[40:29] service oh the Bible says no eye has
[40:32] seen no ear is heard what God has
[40:35] prepared for those that love him
[40:37] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[40:40] all worshiping one person Jesus Christ
[40:44] saying with a loud voice worthy is a
[40:46] land that was slain to receive power and
[40:49] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[40:52] and glory and blessing notice there are
[40:54] seven elements they're worshiping
[40:57] they're seven attributes of Christ
[40:58] they're worshiping on Sunday morning
[41:00] we'll probably I want to preach a
[41:01] message on God's numbers in the Bible
[41:03] I've been studying on God's numbers and
[41:05] you probably read about that a little
[41:07] bit you know brother man talks a lot
[41:08] about it so I'll probably preach on that
[41:09] on Sunday morning Lord willing verse 13
[41:12] let's read this together just verse
[41:14] thirteen one two three and every
[41:16] creature which is in heaven and on the
[41:19] earth and under the earth and such as
[41:23] are in the sea
[41:24] and all that are in them heard I saying
[41:27] blessing and honor and glory and power
[41:31] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[41:35] and unto the lamb forever and ever I'll
[41:38] read verse 14 and the four beasts said
[41:41] amen and the four and twenty elders fell
[41:43] down and worshiped him that liveth for
[41:46] ever and ever amen
[41:48] what a scene that is praise God oh my
[41:52] just imagine all the thousands upon
[41:54] millions all falling down to worship our
[41:57] Lord Jesus Christ is he worthy of your
[41:59] praise tonight there's brother Graham
[42:02] said there's really nothing you can do
[42:03] he said you get on your knees he said
[42:04] you could take off your shoes there's
[42:06] really nothing that we can do to really
[42:08] suffice or humble ourselves enough it's
[42:11] just it's we just must do as much as we
[42:13] can humble ourselves by the grace of God
[42:14] as much as we can he meant let's just
[42:17] have one more word of Prayer Heavenly
[42:18] Father as we approach your word Lord we
[42:20] read your word just take this vessel
[42:22] Lord use me use the people Lord use
[42:25] these vessels of clay father I just pray
[42:27] you to speak to every heart tonight Lord
[42:28] God and Lord let your Holy Spirit Lord
[42:31] give us Lord these thoughts that will
[42:33] strengthen us feed us and encourage us
[42:35] here tonight Lord God we give you all
[42:37] the glory and all the honor and praise
[42:39] in Jesus Christ's name and everybody
[42:41] said amen god bless she's been seated
[42:44] praise God I like to review just a
[43:00] moment before we look at the rest of
[43:01] this chapter after excuse me I'm feeling
[43:05] a little tired I had a late conversation
[43:07] last night with another pastor I'll tell
[43:08] a little bit more about it and I already
[43:11] hadn't got enough sleep the night before
[43:12] so I think it much sleep last night so
[43:13] I'm just kind of a little tired tonight
[43:15] so you have to bear with me here I'm
[43:17] trying to trying to overcome I could
[43:20] have just got off and said you know I'm
[43:21] not feeling very well but I'm trying to
[43:23] overcome by God's grace I'm just
[43:24] pressing through and trust God will give
[43:27] me some good rest tonight by God's grace
[43:28] so this is part 3 part 81 of this series
[43:32] and that's just review and part one we
[43:34] looked at how the book was sealed in
[43:36] Revelation chapter 5
[43:38] it needed to be open which will look at
[43:40] nor willing next week in Chapter six and
[43:43] then we saw I just I was using a lot of
[43:46] Bertram's quotes he showed how a seal in
[43:48] the scripture is is signifying a
[43:52] finished work and he laid in the
[43:54] adoption of I'm sorry the adopter and
[43:55] rather of adoption and the fullness of
[43:58] the adoption which is the body change at
[44:00] the rapture how the seal is an earnest
[44:03] or down payment of all of our
[44:06] inheritance which is a brand-new body
[44:08] and then we looked at how the spirit if
[44:10] you have the spirit of adoption you'll
[44:12] cry out Abba Father have you been crying
[44:14] that out in prayer lately I hope you
[44:16] have I know I have that's been one of my
[44:17] first things I'll say when I go in the
[44:19] prayer closet is Abba I come to you this
[44:21] is our time together Abba this isn't
[44:24] this is your my time here as I pray amen
[44:27] he's our Father and we took time in part
[44:30] one to look at the misunderstanding of
[44:32] the backside people some people
[44:34] misunderstood brother Rams quotes and
[44:36] and they thought there was something
[44:38] outside of the Bible that they were
[44:39] looking for but we found out that
[44:42] brother Branham said there that there's
[44:45] really all we need to be ready for the
[44:47] rapture is what's already written in the
[44:48] Bible we don't have to add to the Bible
[44:50] we certainly can't take away from the
[44:52] Bible and we must not overlook the
[44:55] scripture that's in the Bible so a lot
[44:58] of people are some people have
[44:59] misunderstood the backside of the book
[45:01] now I don't fully understand it but I
[45:03] know this I know we're not to add or
[45:05] take away to the Word of God so we're
[45:07] not looking for any any brother to come
[45:09] with a new revelation oh I got something
[45:11] that's outside the Bible you've never
[45:13] heard it before
[45:13] and we would say nonsense we get
[45:16] nonsense how many read the Bible all the
[45:18] way through if you if you've read the
[45:19] Bible all the way through you've heard
[45:21] it or read it all before but what we
[45:22] need now is the Holy Spirit to quicken
[45:24] that to us to make it alive to say yes
[45:27] that's me I want to as Jesus found his
[45:31] place in the scripture I want to find my
[45:33] place in the scripture hey man she
[45:35] doesn't have to go outside the scrolls
[45:37] or the Bible he had to go inside the
[45:39] Bible to find what was written of him to
[45:41] do praise God and we looked at how the
[45:43] thunders were revealed and were the
[45:47] revelations contained the seven seals in
[45:49] fact a brother from a brother named
[45:50] Clemente from
[45:52] Anna emailed me this morning and said he
[45:54] knew your brother William and he said
[45:55] are the thunders reveal and I said yes
[45:57] sir he said I agree so I don't know if
[46:00] you talked to him or what but he said he
[46:03] knew you
[46:03] his name's Clemente from Ghana but I
[46:06] said yes brother I said yes and so I
[46:07] sent him a link to the sermon I said I
[46:09] believe there brother BAM said they were
[46:11] revealed in the seals and that's in
[46:13] questions that answer 64 so now that
[46:17] they've been revealed what are we
[46:18] supposed to do we're supposed to be our
[46:19] lives thundering out God's Word your
[46:22] life as Bo Jim kept saying on Sunday
[46:24] morning your life is to preach the
[46:26] gospel to other people so your life
[46:29] should be thundering out holiness
[46:30] thundering out godliness thundering out
[46:32] obedience to all the people around you
[46:35] amen and we looked at how the Seventh
[46:38] Seal is the literal day and hour of
[46:40] Christ's second coming for the rapture
[46:42] and that was part one last week we
[46:45] looked at part two the book in heaven
[46:47] was and is the book of redemption it's
[46:49] still the book of redemption
[46:50] we saw how mankind was is and will be
[46:54] redeemed back to all that Adam had in
[46:56] the garden before sin entered what I
[46:58] mean by that is Jesus has already
[47:00] purchased all of our rights back but we
[47:02] don't have the fullness of them that
[47:04] comes at the body change amen
[47:06] then we'll have the fullness of all the
[47:09] redemption and then we saw that John
[47:12] wept because without a redeemer all the
[47:15] creation was lost or they would never
[47:18] return to the or be restored back to the
[47:22] conditions in the Garden of Eden
[47:24] we saw that that's why he wept he didn't
[47:26] weep for any other reason he was weeping
[47:28] because without the contents of that
[47:30] book all these rights would not be
[47:33] restored to God's people amen he and
[47:36] then Satan would remain god of this
[47:38] world but he's not going to always be
[47:40] God of this world
[47:41] one day Jesus Christ will be the full
[47:43] god of this world over every Kingdom and
[47:45] every nation amen don't get me wrong he
[47:48] is in a sense but the Bible said Satan's
[47:49] influencing all the nations now all the
[47:53] governments now he's the main influencer
[47:54] but one day Jesus Christ will rule every
[47:57] nation amen every government hallelujah
[47:59] and that'll be in the Millennium and
[48:03] then we saw why the fifth
[48:04] chapter would be confusing and one way
[48:08] brother man brother has won once he
[48:10] steps off that that mercy seat
[48:12] redemptions overs that's why some people
[48:14] have read revelation five listen brother
[48:16] branham and they thought when Christ
[48:17] comes forward the book and loosed the
[48:19] seal they say redemptions already over
[48:21] but they've just misunderstood the
[48:24] quotes that's that's that's the only way
[48:26] that we can explain it and so I believe
[48:28] revelation five was fulfilled around
[48:31] 1963 sometime around there may be right
[48:34] in March I don't know but then I believe
[48:37] Christ went and sat back down as the
[48:40] mediator on the throne or the mercy seat
[48:43] in heaven that's just my thought I don't
[48:45] really have a I don't really have a
[48:47] scripture on that but there's many
[48:49] quotes after the seals where brother
[48:50] Branham says that Jesus is seated on the
[48:52] throne right now he's mediator and the
[48:55] Bible clearly says he's the mediator
[48:56] right now he's the high priest there's
[48:58] one mediator between God and man that's
[49:00] the man Christ Jesus amen so we know
[49:03] that's what that must have been what
[49:05] happened because the Bible can't
[49:07] contradict itself and so we saw that
[49:09] Mercy's not over even though the seals
[49:12] have been open Mercy's not over brother
[49:13] man said never think that because you're
[49:15] still here if you're still here there's
[49:17] still mercy praise God and brother man
[49:20] said Jesus's act in Revelation five is
[49:22] the most sublime thing in the scripture
[49:25] it's the most awe-inspiring thing and
[49:28] and last Wednesday the Holy Ghost came
[49:30] upon me I could hardly stop crying at
[49:31] the end of service remember that just
[49:33] how it just struck me how sublime it was
[49:35] it was so so powerful that we would be
[49:39] under Satan's Dominion unless Christ
[49:41] came and opened the seals amen
[49:44] aren't you glad he opened the seals
[49:46] without the contents we would be under
[49:49] the bondage of sin we'd we'd remain
[49:51] there in heaven and not be able to come
[49:52] back to earth and and all these things
[49:54] without Christ coming to loose those
[49:56] seals Satan would remain God in the
[49:58] world but he came and did it he came and
[50:00] fulfilled the word he came and redeemed
[50:02] us all and now we can rejoice he's gonna
[50:04] finish the redemption process the most
[50:07] sublime thing in scripture amen
[50:09] hallelujah now let's look tonight at
[50:12] some fresh thoughts here maybe fresh to
[50:15] you or maybe I don't know how much you
[50:18] in Chapter five or the breach sermon but
[50:20] we'll be taking a few quotes from the
[50:22] breach by God's grace
[50:23] so verses 8 to 10 I read them earlier
[50:26] and this is where the the beasts and the
[50:29] elders fall down and they have the vows
[50:31] of prayers they sing a new song and they
[50:34] say you're worthy because you were slain
[50:37] for every kindred tongue nation people
[50:39] and it's made us kings and priests unto
[50:42] God and we shall reign on the earth
[50:46] so let's look what brother Branham says
[50:47] now this was the scripture we don't have
[50:49] to read it I just kind of paraphrase it
[50:51] for you brother man reads this and then
[50:54] he says that that's those that's under
[50:56] the altar that had prayed for long ago
[51:00] so both am speaking of the the 24 elders
[51:02] they prayed for long ago they had prayed
[51:05] for Redemption prayed for resurrection
[51:08] and here these elders are pouring out
[51:11] the prayers before because now we've got
[51:13] a representative now we got a kinsman in
[51:15] heaven that's come forth to make his
[51:18] claims amen
[51:19] so these these elders and the beasts
[51:23] there's all these golden vials I don't
[51:25] know which ones have the golden vials I
[51:26] don't know if both the the beasts have
[51:28] them or just the 24 elders but the the
[51:31] the 4 or the the beasts or elders are
[51:34] bringing forth all these prayers and
[51:36] they're so thankful they're so thankful
[51:38] that now all these prayers that God has
[51:40] kept in heaven are going to be answered
[51:42] soon amen
[51:44] they've been prayed for all these 6,000
[51:46] years all these prayers of 6,000 years
[51:49] God resurrect me Lord I don't want to
[51:51] die but if I do raise me up amen
[51:54] hallelujah job said though though my
[51:57] skin worms will eat my flesh yet in my
[51:59] flesh I shall see God amen all these
[52:02] prayers for thousands of years about I
[52:04] don't want to die brother have said
[52:06] man's greatest fear was death did you
[52:08] know that man's greatest fear was death
[52:11] and so now they see Christ come to
[52:14] reveal the book he comes to take the
[52:15] book and the outers get our rejoicing
[52:17] and they bring all these prayers hopes
[52:20] for resurrection hope for restoration
[52:22] hope for eternal peace hope for eternal
[52:25] love amen
[52:26] hope for eternal health all these hopes
[52:28] all these prayers are now going to be
[52:30] performed and they can't
[52:31] but shouted rejoice amen hallelujah they
[52:35] see Redemption is going to be finished
[52:37] God is going to finish the work that he
[52:39] started amen Oh hallelujah on these
[52:43] prayers four thousand years old six
[52:45] thousand year old prayers God heard
[52:47] every one of them God's gonna answer all
[52:49] of them Amen now look at my RAM says he
[52:54] says this about verse 10 and has made us
[52:57] unto God kings and priests and we shall
[53:00] reign on the earth look at Bob Arum says
[53:02] they wanted to come back and here they
[53:06] are going back to be kings and priests
[53:10] glory to God I feel good enough to speak
[53:13] in tongues brother Matt says he said oh
[53:15] he's and the people start rejoicing he
[53:17] says look here now here it seems like I
[53:19] ain't got enough language I could praise
[53:21] him with it I need one that I don't even
[53:23] know
[53:24] notice the church that you get catches
[53:27] in heaven these Saints are missing the
[53:30] earth how could they miss the earth
[53:34] there's perfect joy in heaven you know
[53:36] there's perfect peace and and there's
[53:38] there's beasts worshiping and it's holy
[53:40] holy holy
[53:41] but brother Ian tells us the Saints
[53:43] we're missing the earth now the reason
[53:48] they're missing the earth is because
[53:49] they have an attraction to it the earth
[53:51] is their future home amen and also
[53:55] they're missing a part of their their
[53:57] being their physical bodies are still on
[53:59] the earth and so because a part of them
[54:01] is on the earth they're longing to go
[54:03] back to the earth from dust thou art and
[54:06] dust that will return so these these
[54:09] theophanies of these four and twenty
[54:11] elders they're longing they feel they
[54:13] still feel a connection to the earth
[54:14] because their bodies are down there on
[54:16] the earth by the rhythm says they wanted
[54:20] to come back you would think why in the
[54:22] world would I ever want to come back
[54:23] this Satan's eating down here but see
[54:25] then then theophany bodies and they know
[54:28] when we come back we're going to rule on
[54:30] that earth amen when I come back there
[54:33] Satan will be put chained up with a
[54:36] chain of circumstance in the bottomless
[54:38] pit praise God and they're longing to go
[54:41] back they're longing to get my body back
[54:43] and to take my position
[54:45] on the heirs they want to go back to
[54:47] earth and we all say all our homes in
[54:49] heaven that's true but our home in
[54:50] heaven is going to come down to earth
[54:52] amen hallelujah because the Bible said
[54:56] blessed are the meek for they shall
[54:58] inherit the earth even though they're in
[55:00] heaven they want to go back to earth
[55:02] because that their inheritance amen
[55:04] there's something on the earth that God
[55:07] has called them to be a steward over to
[55:09] rule over and they want to go back and
[55:11] take their position amen and it's not
[55:13] just going to be a temporary one brother
[55:15] William it's going to be an eternal one
[55:17] amen
[55:18] eternally they will be on this earth in
[55:21] the position God has called them to be
[55:23] in praise God amen and this is where
[55:26] heaven comes down to earth so see we say
[55:29] or we're looking for a country who's
[55:31] bitter makers God Jesus is preparing
[55:33] that city right now Jesus is preparing
[55:36] that country right now he said I go to
[55:38] prepare a place for you amen he's
[55:41] preparing says in the future home Jesus
[55:43] is preparing the New Jerusalem right now
[55:45] so yes we're longing for our country are
[55:48] our real home is in heaven
[55:50] but then heaven is going to come down to
[55:51] earth amen hallelujah remember that when
[55:57] Bo Graham said about Abraham and Hosea
[55:58] premise because I mean I remember here
[56:00] he he always likes Abraham he's always
[56:03] talked about Abraham brother and said
[56:04] Abraham was looking for his future home
[56:06] he was just looking from side to side
[56:08] he's looking for this country's builder
[56:10] makers God brother and said the whole
[56:12] time it wasn't down here he said all you
[56:14] had to do was look up the New Jerusalem
[56:18] praise God he knew it was somewhere he
[56:20] knew it was in this vicinity but the
[56:22] whole time it was just right above him
[56:24] in a few years Jesus would come to the
[56:26] earth and then Jesus would go back to
[56:28] heaven and he'd begin construction on
[56:30] that gate great country how many know
[56:32] how many know that there's a great
[56:33] attraction for you to heaven amen
[56:35] do you feel that traction you're locked
[56:37] are you groaning for heaven praise God
[56:39] well once you get there then you'll
[56:41] grown to come back to earth amen I don't
[56:44] know yeah because a part of you came
[56:46] from the earth amen and that's part of
[56:48] your possession as well hallelujah oh ma
[56:51] thank you Jesus so see that's what the
[56:55] these 424 hours are so happy they're so
[56:58] thankful they've got the prayers - look
[57:00] what Abraham britainís we're looking
[57:02] look at your break this we're looking at
[57:03] Solomon and David pregnant they've got
[57:05] all these prayers from all these
[57:07] thousands of years and they know oh god
[57:09] is going to finish it God is gonna
[57:11] complete what he started and then we're
[57:13] going back to the earth we've enjoyed
[57:15] heaven but I sure want to go back to the
[57:17] earth they meant Oh hallelujah verse 11
[57:21] now this is where the voice of the
[57:25] Angels they all thousands upon thousands
[57:28] they say worthy was a lamb this is the
[57:31] Sevenfold worship here now let's see
[57:33] what brother M says he said listen what
[57:35] a Jubilee going on when they seen that
[57:39] lamb come and take that book or
[57:40] Redemption the souls screamed out we'll
[57:45] get at it Oh everything the elders fell
[57:47] down they poured out the prayers of the
[57:49] Saints what there was represented a
[57:51] kinsman for us they fell on their faces
[57:55] then they sang a song and said thou art
[57:57] worthy for you were slain watch and look
[58:00] at these angels amen now this is what I
[58:05] don't understand
[58:07] if heaven is shouting and rejoicing that
[58:09] the seals are going to be open how much
[58:12] more should we rejoice on the earth that
[58:14] they are open or inside of this when was
[58:17] the last time you rejoiced because the
[58:19] seals were open every time I cast down
[58:22] sin I should rejoice that the seals are
[58:24] open amen because the seals revealed how
[58:27] Satan comes he comes as a deceptive
[58:30] white horse rider right that's what the
[58:33] seals did it showed us how Satan works
[58:35] he tries to trick you into sin first but
[58:38] he God give you the line anointing to be
[58:40] bold against that devil amen hallelujah
[58:43] now we know the Antichrist spirit has
[58:45] progressed we're now he's like a pale
[58:46] horse rider and now we're supposed to
[58:48] have the eagle anointing but the seals
[58:50] reveal both to us it reveals how Satan
[58:53] attacks us with the white innocence and
[58:55] also how he tries to kill people with
[58:57] spiritual death the seals would be all
[58:59] of that the whole Bible became a new
[59:01] Bible when the seals were revealed amen
[59:03] Oh an order to at least it ought to be
[59:05] coming up new Bible to us that's right
[59:09] he said what did you believe going on in
[59:12] heaven when that lamb leaves the
[59:13] intercessory box to come here to possess
[59:16] his claim you know what you know that
[59:18] got next to John he must have saw his
[59:21] name wrote there now be careful because
[59:25] John would have only seen his name
[59:27] written once the book was open
[59:28] so in Chapter five he hasn't seen his
[59:31] unless his name was on the back side of
[59:32] the book that's the only thing I could
[59:34] say brother you guys understand you
[59:36] understand unless his name was because
[59:38] the book there's still seven seals
[59:39] around it so this might be true but if
[59:42] it was then then Jesus had all 24 elders
[59:44] names on the back side of the book that
[59:46] may be possible but brother Han doesn't
[59:48] tell us that I'm just letting you know
[59:50] if this is a Lamb's Book of Life and the
[59:52] names are inside then then that couldn't
[59:55] happen to later but I'm just letting you
[59:57] know so you understand when M seals
[1:00:00] Brooks that means the book would be open
[1:00:02] he must have got real happy listen what
[1:00:05] he said alright just a minute here it's
[1:00:09] a good thought but Ram said talk about a
[1:00:13] Jubilee talk about a time when the lamb
[1:00:16] walk for see the books even sealed in
[1:00:19] heaven the mysteries are and prevents
[1:00:21] says say is my name there bro Graham
[1:00:23] says I don't know I hope it is how many
[1:00:29] hoping your names on the Lamb's Book of
[1:00:31] Life as well I'm hoping that there is
[1:00:33] there as well but if it is it was put on
[1:00:36] that book before the foundation of the
[1:00:38] world but the first thing that
[1:00:41] represented that Redemption come the
[1:00:42] Lamb that had been slain from the
[1:00:44] foundation world and he took the glory
[1:00:46] open the book now this is when in the
[1:00:48] breach message that the crowd gets the
[1:00:50] loudest at this point because they're
[1:00:52] realizing that revelation five and six
[1:00:55] are going to be fulfilled in the next
[1:00:57] few days see he took the book opened the
[1:01:01] book torn off the seals and sent it down
[1:01:03] to earth to his seventh angel to reveal
[1:01:06] it to his people and at this point you
[1:01:08] can't even hear brother Branham because
[1:01:10] the people are so rejoicing that this
[1:01:12] book is going to be revealed to God's
[1:01:14] bride amen Oh hallelujah he said oh my
[1:01:18] what happened the screams of shouts the
[1:01:19] hallelujah the anointed the power of the
[1:01:22] the manifestation all of heaven couldn't
[1:01:25] stop rejoicing and singing when they
[1:01:27] knew this books going to be reveal I'll
[1:01:29] tell you if heaven energy ever ever
[1:01:31] enters your yo do the same thing when
[1:01:34] God reveals his revelations to you
[1:01:36] praise God hallelujah no cameras after
[1:01:39] this you know the seals are before any
[1:01:42] time God reveals any true to you it
[1:01:44] makes you want to shout and rejoice amen
[1:01:46] because the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[1:01:48] against the heavenly revelation Amen
[1:01:51] Alleluia that's right and so the people
[1:01:58] are rejoicing Oh programs the seventh
[1:02:00] angel we understand this God is going to
[1:02:02] break the seals right now and all heaven
[1:02:04] is shouting and so Oliver starts
[1:02:06] shouting there must have been an echo
[1:02:08] and now when they were worshiping there
[1:02:10] must been an echo to come down to earth
[1:02:11] Oh glory
[1:02:14] now I'm going I'm skipping to a
[1:02:15] different message program just to show
[1:02:17] you how humble brother Brandon is now
[1:02:19] he's talking about the book of life
[1:02:20] brother man said brother Brandon can you
[1:02:22] prove that you're there no sir I cannot
[1:02:24] prove it look how humble it look how
[1:02:27] humble he is Church I've heard quotes
[1:02:30] recently when I listen brother BAM says
[1:02:32] I hope I'm in the bride he says I don't
[1:02:34] have those up here but I could find them
[1:02:35] for you I hope look how humble look how
[1:02:38] look how a little he made himself he
[1:02:41] never bragged and made himself arrogant
[1:02:43] or better than other people he was not
[1:02:44] full of pride he was full of God's love
[1:02:48] see brother have said God could use me
[1:02:50] for a to love something else I'm God I'm
[1:02:52] glad God didn't I'm God fit amen and you
[1:02:59] the same way see he can use me for a
[1:03:02] tool for evil as well but I believe in
[1:03:04] my faith I'm saved not by now John saved
[1:03:06] by faith that's the way you're saved
[1:03:08] that's the way we're all saved now I
[1:03:10] don't put this up here so you'll walk
[1:03:12] around and wonder I don't know if my
[1:03:13] name's on the book I don't know if I'm
[1:03:14] saying I'll know whatever that's not why
[1:03:17] I'm reading I'm saying that to show how
[1:03:18] humble he is so we don't get prideful
[1:03:20] and exalt ourselves above the Methodists
[1:03:22] to make ourselves better than the
[1:03:25] Pentecostals alright my family's my
[1:03:27] mom's in Pentecostal church I'm not
[1:03:28] exalting myself above her I'm just
[1:03:30] saying more has been revealed in her
[1:03:32] church has
[1:03:34] and they can live a higher life if
[1:03:35] they'll receive that God has torn off
[1:03:37] these seven seals off the ball came
[1:03:39] ahead there's a higher life they can
[1:03:41] live but I can't prove that my name's
[1:03:44] there my life will prove if my name's
[1:03:46] they're very men so will yours we're not
[1:03:50] to go around and say well they're all
[1:03:51] going to hell there are a bunch of
[1:03:52] serpents II know God could use you as a
[1:03:55] serpent seed and church even in our
[1:03:59] failures this is why I sent a quote to
[1:04:01] brother William today even in our
[1:04:03] failures God wants to us to be so humble
[1:04:05] that we realized we're not that we're
[1:04:08] not above sin brother Branham I sent the
[1:04:12] court developer him I mentioned here
[1:04:13] brother Branham took six months and he
[1:04:15] said he in his prayer meetings he said
[1:04:17] or healing campaigns he said bring me
[1:04:19] all the hard cases first and brother BAM
[1:04:22] said when I did that he said I was
[1:04:24] walking in Balaam shoes now brother
[1:04:27] Branham was not a Balaam he was God's
[1:04:29] true prophet but you understand what
[1:04:32] he's saying he's saying I know I know
[1:04:34] what it's like to misuse a gift of God
[1:04:36] he said because i disobeyed the angels
[1:04:39] voice the angel never told me bring the
[1:04:41] hardest cases the Angels just said pray
[1:04:43] for the sick and he made it a show
[1:04:46] brother Brad made it a show that's what
[1:04:47] the coach says and he put himself in
[1:04:49] Balaam shoes misusing the gift of God
[1:04:52] now how many can relate to that for
[1:04:54] example how many of ever felt like Jonah
[1:04:56] and you've left the Friends of God and
[1:04:58] the church said everybody ought to shout
[1:05:01] amens I'm done that means oh you mean
[1:05:04] you've never left the perfect will of
[1:05:05] God you never made a mistake and didn't
[1:05:08] walk in the will of God of course you
[1:05:09] and I have of course I have of course
[1:05:13] you and I have run from the presence of
[1:05:14] the Lord are you with me Church so see
[1:05:17] what I'm saying is that we can all
[1:05:19] relate what it feels like oh I'm in
[1:05:21] Jonah's shoes today I should have I went
[1:05:23] the wrong way I should have done this
[1:05:25] instead of that but that doesn't mean
[1:05:28] where Jonah but it means we can relate
[1:05:30] to his experience and that's what this
[1:05:32] is saying here I'm not sure I'm not
[1:05:33] showing you you this so you'll feel bad
[1:05:35] I don't know if my name's there by faith
[1:05:37] you must confess your names there the
[1:05:40] Bible said with your mouth confession is
[1:05:42] made under salvation amen you've got to
[1:05:45] confess it I believe he say
[1:05:47] how do you know because I'm dead to the
[1:05:49] things of the world the old man is
[1:05:51] crucified and now I'm a new man in
[1:05:52] Christ Jesus I don't desire the things
[1:05:55] of the world I don't obey the lusts of
[1:05:57] the flesh
[1:05:58] I'm led by the Holy Spirit and so now
[1:06:01] with your mouth you confess that i'm
[1:06:03] saved i'm saved by faith just like
[1:06:06] brother Brad was saved by faith so am i
[1:06:08] hey man are you with me Church and I got
[1:06:14] this when this always helps me out I
[1:06:16] mentioned it before you prior to when
[1:06:18] the first seal brother man talks about
[1:06:19] people who complain why don't want to
[1:06:21] have to let my hair grow long I don't
[1:06:23] want to stop smoking program said let me
[1:06:26] tell you something if your name was
[1:06:28] placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:06:30] the foundation world you'll be so happy
[1:06:32] to do it in other words obey the Bible
[1:06:34] you can't wait for the minute to do it
[1:06:36] praise God amen so he gives us some
[1:06:40] encouragement that's how you know your
[1:06:42] name's there because you want to obey
[1:06:44] all of God's Word now amen
[1:06:48] so yeah we want to be humble like
[1:06:50] brother Graham we wanted to be humble
[1:06:51] like that but we also want some
[1:06:53] encouragement because the Bible said
[1:06:55] make your calling and election sure
[1:06:57] prove to everybody whether you're wise
[1:07:00] or foolish virgin prove to people in the
[1:07:03] morning you can you should wake up and
[1:07:04] tell the devil devil I'm going to
[1:07:06] improve I'm gonna prove to you today
[1:07:08] that I'm a wise virgin or if you're
[1:07:12] struggling with being a borderline
[1:07:14] believer then well I'm gonna prove to
[1:07:15] you today I'm not a borderline believer
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:19] prove it the Bible says you can prove
[1:07:22] the perfect will of God the Bible said
[1:07:25] cast down anything that exalts itself
[1:07:27] against the Word of God dude the Bible
[1:07:31] said take any thought in the captivity
[1:07:32] that exalts itself against the Word of
[1:07:35] God because the weapons of our warfare
[1:07:36] are not carnal but they're money to God
[1:07:40] by pulling down many strongholds if
[1:07:42] you've got a stronghold you've got to
[1:07:44] pull it out and speak in Jesus Christ's
[1:07:47] name and the church said you've got to
[1:07:53] pull down if you let a strong a
[1:07:55] stronghold build up of of anger against
[1:07:59] somebody you got to pull that down
[1:08:00] Jesus Christ name praise the Lord if
[1:08:04] you've got a stronghold of fear you've
[1:08:06] got to pull that down and say I'm not
[1:08:07] afraid in Jesus Christ name if you've
[1:08:11] got a stronghold of lust you've got to
[1:08:13] say Lord forgive me my lust I'm pulling
[1:08:15] down this stronghold I won't give in to
[1:08:17] that lust anymore and I'm doing it in
[1:08:19] Jesus Christ's name are you with me
[1:08:21] church I hope you can understand thank
[1:08:26] you lord
[1:08:28] okay now let me go back to this quote
[1:08:30] yeah here it is an old John who've been
[1:08:32] standing there our brother crying why
[1:08:35] why he said everything in having
[1:08:36] everything he knows everything in the
[1:08:37] sea heard me holler amen blessings honor
[1:08:40] might empower be to him that lives
[1:08:42] forever and ever now remember last week
[1:08:44] John looked everywhere for someone
[1:08:47] worthy so he had access to go in the
[1:08:50] middle of the earth somehow by vision I
[1:08:54] don't know under the earth on the earth
[1:08:58] he was able to quickly search around the
[1:09:00] earth for anybody worthy and then he was
[1:09:01] able to do a roll call and having
[1:09:03] anybody worthy up here and when no one
[1:09:07] was found he started crying he said no
[1:09:10] one so he did a full search of the whole
[1:09:12] universe can I say like that he did a
[1:09:15] full search of that Hall of somehow got
[1:09:18] into a full search of the universe and
[1:09:19] knowing it's not worthy uh-huh
[1:09:24] but here he sees Christ come forth and
[1:09:27] when he sees him comes forth he gets so
[1:09:30] happy now here's why he gets happy you
[1:09:35] and maybe you wondered how come
[1:09:36] everything heard him scream and shout
[1:09:38] here's why Brennan tells us he said talk
[1:09:41] about a happy time when them seals broke
[1:09:44] John must have look in when the seals
[1:09:47] broke and seen in and Cena passed the
[1:09:51] curtain of time and said there's John so
[1:09:56] John looked in and said there's John
[1:09:59] John looked into heaven and said there's
[1:10:02] John he's one of the 24 elders and the
[1:10:07] church said and there John must have
[1:10:09] looked at and said oh there I am and
[1:10:11] I've got a corner or crown on and I've
[1:10:13] got
[1:10:14] Frode right next to Jesus Christ and
[1:10:18] when he saw that brother madam said he
[1:10:20] got so happy he said everything in
[1:10:22] heaven cried out didn't he everything in
[1:10:24] heaven everything in earth everything
[1:10:26] beneath the earth every creature
[1:10:27] everything else heard me saying amen
[1:10:29] blessing glory wisdom power might and
[1:10:31] riches belong to him amen why did
[1:10:34] everybody hear everybody heard him
[1:10:36] because he had already searched
[1:10:38] everywhere amen he already searched
[1:10:40] everywhere and then when he saw that he
[1:10:43] was predestinated to sit on the throne
[1:10:45] in heaven but God let his voice go to
[1:10:49] every place that he serves as a witness
[1:10:51] that Jesus Christ would restore him and
[1:10:54] Jesus Christ had a place for it in other
[1:10:57] words he knew he was predestinated and
[1:10:59] he knew he was going to make it amen
[1:11:01] he knew there is no devil in hell that
[1:11:03] could keep him from the service of the
[1:11:05] Lord amen
[1:11:06] in other words he knew he wasn't going
[1:11:08] to hell he knew he wasn't going to the
[1:11:10] tribulation oh man he knew he was going
[1:11:13] in the rapture Church and if you go
[1:11:15] revelation then I'm not going to hell
[1:11:17] I'm not going to tribulation I'm going
[1:11:20] in the rapture how do you know because I
[1:11:21] saw myself in the vision of God amen
[1:11:24] hallelujah so because he searched all
[1:11:28] these locations on the universe God lets
[1:11:30] all the universe here is shouting and
[1:11:32] rejoicing that he made it over I made it
[1:11:35] over and now I see my theophany there it
[1:11:40] is
[1:11:41] John saws the Alpha knee brace God he
[1:11:44] saw Cioffi there's Jeb he's one of those
[1:11:47] 24 elders and I made it over Amazing
[1:11:50] Grace how sweet the sound I made it over
[1:11:53] amen and all of heaven all creation
[1:11:56] everything even hail hears him shout
[1:11:58] hallelujah I made it I won't be lost I'm
[1:12:01] a victor
[1:12:02] I'm an overcomer I ever came in my day
[1:12:05] by the blood of Jesus Christ oh I want
[1:12:08] to make somebody happy tonight amen John
[1:12:13] looked and seen a past occurred of time
[1:12:17] I'm going to make it they've tried to
[1:12:20] burn the Holy Ghost out of me with oil
[1:12:22] they and now I'm gonna Island they're
[1:12:25] scorpions and snakes all over here and
[1:12:27] said even though I'm in the midst of
[1:12:28] these trials I'm gonna make it
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:33] so he shouts and though Jesus Christ is
[1:12:36] gonna overcome and then I'm gonna make
[1:12:40] it I see myself in God's plan I see that
[1:12:43] I am an overcomer and once he got back
[1:12:47] from this vision church where as well
[1:12:48] don't tell us his major theme was love
[1:12:51] one another but BAM said when John was
[1:12:55] told to preach he would sit in the
[1:12:57] corner of the church and people would
[1:12:59] leave and he'd say little children love
[1:13:01] one another that's all he would say a
[1:13:04] man who saw himself in heaven a man who
[1:13:08] knew I have a place at the throne of God
[1:13:10] I'm not foolish virgin I'm wise virgin
[1:13:14] his greatest advice to all the people on
[1:13:17] earth that were still struggling am I
[1:13:18] gonna make her not his greatest advice
[1:13:20] is make sure you love one another I hope
[1:13:24] we can be encouraged tonight that you
[1:13:26] know our our main battle is just loving
[1:13:28] each other right here did you know that
[1:13:29] Jesus said you know my disciples because
[1:13:32] they love other disciples your hardest
[1:13:36] when your hardest battles will be to
[1:13:37] love people in this church right here
[1:13:39] you understand that and John with all
[1:13:43] that understanding John I also kind of
[1:13:47] said like this John now you start to
[1:13:48] walk by faith but part of it he'd
[1:13:51] already seen it by sight he knew he was
[1:13:53] going to make it by the grace of Lord
[1:13:54] does every understand like he had seen
[1:13:56] it by faith by faith he saw himself
[1:13:58] there
[1:13:59] oh my and if only we can love one
[1:14:03] another can you be patient with me for a
[1:14:05] few more years to the rapture can you be
[1:14:06] patient with me I hope so
[1:14:08] I'll try to be patient with you I'll try
[1:14:12] to love you if you'll love me back we
[1:14:15] all love one another
[1:14:16] we've just got to have divine love for
[1:14:18] each other and if we love each other
[1:14:20] then we can love sinners the last thing
[1:14:25] he said before he died we know little
[1:14:28] children love one another
[1:14:29] the last letter he wrote was all about
[1:14:30] love first John one two and three it's
[1:14:32] all about love love one another so John
[1:14:38] himself and the vision he was one of the
[1:14:40] 24 hours because Jesus had promised this
[1:14:42] to him during his earthly ministry John
[1:14:46] remembered I remember when we were
[1:14:47] having communion that night and Jesus
[1:14:50] told me he said truly I say to you John
[1:14:53] that you follow me and in the
[1:14:55] regeneration when the Son of man shall
[1:14:57] sit on throne of his glory you shall sit
[1:14:59] upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve
[1:15:01] tribes of Israel and there John sees
[1:15:03] there's my throne and then I am with
[1:15:07] those twelve tribe leaders but I'm going
[1:15:09] to rule over them and John sees that he
[1:15:11] can't help but shout a little bit if
[1:15:13] your prayers ever get answered you might
[1:15:15] shout a little bit by the grace of God
[1:15:17] Church is that right if you know God's
[1:15:19] gonna answer your prayer but have said
[1:15:21] you can meet just as happy even if you
[1:15:23] don't have it yet you can be just as
[1:15:25] happy because you've got the purchased
[1:15:27] power of your request amen believes that
[1:15:29] you can be just as happy with
[1:15:30] twenty-five cents to buy a loaf of bread
[1:15:32] even though you're starboard
[1:15:34] you can be just as happy with a quarter
[1:15:36] as she would be with the bread and
[1:15:38] that's what John is saying here he can
[1:15:40] be just as happy even though he's not on
[1:15:41] the throne yet he has the purchase price
[1:15:44] he has the revelation that he will sit
[1:15:46] on the throne a man shouting when the
[1:15:56] when the when the revelation come that
[1:15:58] the Lamb the Redeemer our kinsman had
[1:16:00] come back from the throne of me tutorial
[1:16:02] and it walked out here to take his
[1:16:03] possession there brother Ram starts
[1:16:05] singing soon the lamb will take his
[1:16:08] bride to be ever at his side so brother
[1:16:12] I'm singing this about revelation five
[1:16:13] he comes forth to claim the contents
[1:16:16] that are in his book right but we know
[1:16:18] of course that takes place at the
[1:16:19] seventh seal but the same point is that
[1:16:22] one day Jesus is going to call all those
[1:16:24] names on the book shout voice
[1:16:27] Trump the Trump of God is going to call
[1:16:29] us the Bible said our bodies get changed
[1:16:31] at the last Trump and the church said so
[1:16:34] that last Trump must be the calling of
[1:16:35] the names the spiritual name mrs. Jesus
[1:16:38] Christ is time for you to rise rise in
[1:16:40] power rise in love rise in a body change
[1:16:43] rise in the rapture rise in Holy Ghost
[1:16:46] power rise and meet your husband in the
[1:16:48] air
[1:16:49] hey man hallelujah now let me ask you
[1:16:58] this question I'm almost done because I
[1:16:59] wanted to finish at 8:30 so I have about
[1:17:01] 15 or 20 minutes to talk about the
[1:17:04] resignation here but I want to ask you
[1:17:10] John saw himself in the vision and it
[1:17:13] made him shout so much that all heaven
[1:17:16] earth and beneath the earth heard him
[1:17:17] shout because he saw he was
[1:17:20] predestinated god help us to see that
[1:17:26] we're predestinated so I want to say I
[1:17:30] just want to just give you some thoughts
[1:17:32] here can you see yourself in these three
[1:17:34] visions or dreams now I'm going to read
[1:17:36] them again can you see yourself in the
[1:17:39] preview of the bride you see yourself in
[1:17:40] that vision do you see yourself in the
[1:17:43] vision of beyond the curtain of time and
[1:17:45] you see your self in the vision of
[1:17:47] brother Rams mother's dream about
[1:17:49] walking up the Kings Highway and if you
[1:17:53] don't remember those visions I'm gonna
[1:17:53] read em to you tonight they're kind of
[1:17:54] hungry the short version okay the
[1:17:57] preview the ride right this is from the
[1:18:00] rapture 1965 brother Ram said this I
[1:18:05] stood there and seen a beautiful little
[1:18:07] lady lady just correctly dressed and
[1:18:09] things marching this way there was
[1:18:11] somebody standing by him in the vision
[1:18:12] and they said the preview of the bride I
[1:18:14] seen her go by they come on this side
[1:18:16] and went around so program saw the true
[1:18:17] Bride of Christ pass and then he said oh
[1:18:20] then I heard it coming he said the Asian
[1:18:24] Church you talk about filth
[1:18:26] here come the European Church he said
[1:18:30] then I heard a rock-and-roll coming it
[1:18:32] was Miss America and she didn't even
[1:18:34] have on any clothes she had papers like
[1:18:36] newspapers grey hold in front of her
[1:18:38] dancing by rock-and-roll Miss America
[1:18:41] the church I stood there in his presence
[1:18:44] I thought oh God as a minister if that's
[1:18:46] the best we could do oh oh you know how
[1:18:48] you feel I thought oh god hide me if I
[1:18:52] could just get away from here if all
[1:18:53] that we've done all that we've tried to
[1:18:55] produce is this one it's produced all
[1:18:57] this preaching has produced this a rock
[1:18:59] and roll Church
[1:19:02] and then when all than women passed by
[1:19:03] he says short hair painted faces he said
[1:19:10] they were supposed to be virgins the
[1:19:12] Christ and when she passed by I turned
[1:19:14] my head and holding this in front of me
[1:19:16] it was disgraceful he was even covering
[1:19:17] his face he says I couldn't stand it and
[1:19:21] him standing there and me that no as the
[1:19:25] minutes of the church I said oh god I
[1:19:26] can't look at let me die let me fade
[1:19:29] away he was so embarrassed by the
[1:19:30] American Church don't you get
[1:19:32] embarrassed when you see churches like
[1:19:34] that and as soon as it went out so now
[1:19:37] the American church is past now which
[1:19:40] part of the vision are you in are you
[1:19:42] part of that American Church are you
[1:19:44] part of this next church it's coming up
[1:19:45] I hope you're a part of this next church
[1:19:48] coming up I believe you are and as soon
[1:19:51] as it went out every time he said one of
[1:19:53] them would come they go in a certain
[1:19:55] place they would drop off so those
[1:19:56] churches are going down to hell he says
[1:20:01] then I heard something like onward
[1:20:03] Christian soldiers I looked and Here
[1:20:05] Come the sainted bunch of little girls
[1:20:07] just exactly the way they was all
[1:20:10] correctly dressed their hair hanging way
[1:20:12] back down their back smooth clean
[1:20:15] marching like this to the step of the
[1:20:17] gospel she was the word I'll say it
[1:20:21] again
[1:20:21] she was the word the other church was
[1:20:25] not the word this church was the word
[1:20:28] Amen they looked like one out of every
[1:20:31] nation I was looking at as they passed
[1:20:33] by and seen them passed by instead of
[1:20:35] going down he said they started going up
[1:20:39] amen I noticed one of them trying to or
[1:20:42] three of them trying to get out of line
[1:20:43] and I screamed stay vine and the vision
[1:20:46] left mean I was standing in the room
[1:20:47] screaming stay vine stay in line like

[1:21:10] either if by faith we are either the
[1:21:13] church that's staying in line the whole
[1:21:14] time or
[1:21:15] trying to step out a little bit and
[1:21:17] enjoy some things of the world and we
[1:21:19] need to hear brother Ram scream out say

[1:22:31] staying in line oh thank you Lord that's
[1:22:35] what we need to do tonight see ourselves
[1:22:37] in the vision how many want to see
[1:22:39] yourself in the vision the bram said she
[1:22:45] has to be molded and made in the image
[1:22:46] of Christ and Christ is the word he said
[1:22:50] there cannot be one thing added to the
[1:22:52] word so this bride was getting out of
[1:22:54] line she was starting to add to the word
[1:22:55] well we can do this and we're allowed to
[1:22:59] this we're allowed to do that and the
[1:23:02] Prophet said stay and stay in line stop
[1:23:06] adding to the word just stay with the
[1:23:08] pure Word of God don't overlook the word
[1:23:14] can you see yourself in the in the
[1:23:16] vision praise the Lord beyond the
[1:23:20] current of time this is from rejected
[1:23:22] King May 15 1960 brother man
[1:23:28] was the it was a different it wasn't
[1:23:30] like any vision he ever had he called it
[1:23:32] the translation when he went behind the
[1:23:34] curtain of time and when I hit that
[1:23:37] little place I never seen so many people
[1:23:38] come running screaming all our precious
[1:23:41] brother and I looked and young women
[1:23:43] maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they
[1:23:45] were throwing their arms around me and
[1:23:46] screaming our precious brother Here Come
[1:23:48] young men in the brilliance of young
[1:23:50] manhood and their eyes glistening look
[1:23:51] like stars on a darkened night beautiful
[1:23:57] he said their teeth as wide as pearls he
[1:24:04] said and they were screaming grabbing me
[1:24:06] screaming all our precious brother and I
[1:24:08] stopped and I looked and I was young I
[1:24:10] looked back at my old body laying there
[1:24:11] with my hands behind my head I said I
[1:24:13] don't understand this and these young
[1:24:15] women throwing their arms around me
[1:24:16] talked about how their bodies were
[1:24:17] changed and men and women can hug in
[1:24:19] that dimension because all the sex
[1:24:20] glands are gone Jesus said they'll be
[1:24:22] just like the angels which means angels
[1:24:24] don't have physical bodies they don't
[1:24:26] have sex glands right that's what Jesus
[1:24:28] said he said and he said there was no
[1:24:34] yesterday or no tomorrow they never got
[1:24:36] tired I never seen such pretty women all
[1:24:38] my life they had hair down their
[1:24:40] waistline long skirts to their feet and
[1:24:41] they were just hugging me it wasn't a
[1:24:43] hug like my own sister sitting here
[1:24:45] would hug me they were not kissing I was
[1:24:47] not kissing them it was something he
[1:24:48] said I don't have the vocabulary
[1:24:50] he said perfection wouldn't touch it and
[1:24:54] I looked this way in that way and we're
[1:24:56] coming by the thousands and I said I
[1:24:57] don't understand this and alas he said
[1:24:59] here come hope his first wife
[1:25:02] that was my first wife she run and never
[1:25:05] said my husband now look at this doesn't
[1:25:09] say my husband she hugged me and said my
[1:25:12] precious brother and when she hugged me
[1:25:16] there was another woman standing there
[1:25:18] that hugged me and then a hope heard
[1:25:20] this woman so home just hugged him
[1:25:21] quickly and it's hard hugging other
[1:25:22] women because God has no respecter of
[1:25:25] persons and the church shouted look at
[1:25:31] my man
[1:25:31] I said what's this I let throw Grantha I
[1:25:33] can understand this but hope seemed like
[1:25:35] a guest of honor she was no different
[1:25:38] but just like a guest of honor to hope
[1:25:42] didn't get any special privileges above
[1:25:43] everybody else she didn't even call him
[1:25:45] husband just called him my brother and
[1:25:49] then I heard a voice and you know the
[1:25:50] rest of it program said thus saith the
[1:25:52] Lord it'll take perfect love to put you
[1:25:55] in that place for that's all that was
[1:25:57] there hey man
[1:26:00] Laurie so can you can you see yourself

[1:26:12] precious brother James browning or
[1:26:14] anyone that's going on before you would
[1:26:17] just love everybody you know hold

[1:27:11] all precious to me and everybody here
[1:27:13] should be precious to you now the last
[1:27:19] dream brother branham said his mom
[1:27:23] didn't have many dreams but when she did
[1:27:25] they came to pass and this isn't it as
[1:27:28] the rising of the Sun March I'm sorry
[1:27:29] April 18 1965 this was when brother
[1:27:36] started just started preaching and his
[1:27:37] mom had a dream and standing by the side
[1:27:41] of three steps oh brother I'm standing
[1:27:42] by the side of three steps here we have
[1:27:43] one step so imagine one two three
[1:27:47] brother I'm standing right next to the
[1:27:48] three steps and you know why that is
[1:27:51] because he's the one that preached the
[1:27:53] three works of grace and he said he
[1:27:56] preached out his whole ministry God
[1:27:57] revealed that's the way to be saved
[1:27:59] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:28:02] Holy Ghost he said and I was standing
[1:28:06] preaching to everybody that they must
[1:28:07] walk up these three steps before they
[1:28:09] hit that highway amen he said and then
[1:28:15] on the highways a little pearly white
[1:28:17] line run right up to the doors of heaven
[1:28:19] to the pearly gates can you imagine that
[1:28:21] that's what we're happening at that's
[1:28:22] what's happening right now first god
[1:28:24] amen we're supposed to walk up three
[1:28:27] steps get the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:28:28] once we get the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] our feet should stay on this white
[1:28:32] narrow path and we should keep our eyes
[1:28:34] on the pearly gates amen they're going
[1:28:37] to open one for me because I'm born
[1:28:39] again I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:41] I'm walking on God's narrow road I can
[1:28:45] see myself in that vision praise God I'm
[1:28:47] walking the narrow road hallelujah and
[1:28:53] brother have said if that ain't my
[1:28:54] message exactly today justification
[1:28:56] sanctification baptism only goes and I
[1:28:59] was saying that a person has to come by
[1:29:01] these three steps and be able to walk
[1:29:03] that way and then he said a lady in
[1:29:04] spiked heeled shoes high-heeled shoes
[1:29:07] tried to come and said wait a minute
[1:29:09] sister you can't walk that highway with
[1:29:11] that and she said ah don't believe him
[1:29:15] he's a madman don't believe him I'll
[1:29:16] show you I can be justified Satan if I
[1:29:18] feel the Holy Ghost and still walk like
[1:29:19] that and I just let her go that's the
[1:29:23] same way people are today with brother
[1:29:25] Branham oh brother Graham wasn't right
[1:29:26] about that and he didn't he didn't
[1:29:27] preach before he wasn't a prophet he
[1:29:29] wasn't all these things like that I'll
[1:29:30] be careful what you're listening
[1:29:32] teachers that man was the prophet of God
[1:29:35] and you've got to respect him if you
[1:29:37] expect to make it on that white narrow
[1:29:39] road because he's that seventh angel
[1:29:42] he's that seven star that's shining his
[1:29:44] life is that example that we've all got
[1:29:46] to attain to
[1:29:48] that shining light of the the gospel the
[1:29:50] fire of Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:53] I just let her let her go I couldn't
[1:29:56] know more about it couldn't stop her and
[1:29:57] she jumped on the highway looked back
[1:29:59] and said see I told you I can't walk it
[1:30:00] see they can pretend to act like they're
[1:30:02] Holy Ghost field for a while but pretty
[1:30:05] soon their folly will find them out she
[1:30:08] tried she tried to impersonate it and
[1:30:10] can you imagine and spiked high some of
[1:30:12] your sisters I may be that warm I I
[1:30:13] never warm you know he tried to run the
[1:30:15] path and there'd the pearly gates she
[1:30:18] look good good I can you know I can but
[1:30:19] I can live the Holy Ghost live and wear
[1:30:22] high heels
[1:30:23] no man said no you can't he said you
[1:30:27] know the Bible said they'd have
[1:30:29] outstretched necks he quotes Isaiah
[1:30:30] chapter 3 which that's the text I used
[1:30:32] to make that high-heeled video they got
[1:30:35] they got one time yeah and they got high
[1:30:38] stretch necks and they're tinkling as
[1:30:41] they go on all the descriptions of high
[1:30:43] heels and there's nothing new Under the
[1:30:44] Sun they had high heels Israel at high
[1:30:47] heels
[1:30:47] just like America's got high heels today
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:52] after a while the road got narrower and
[1:30:55] narrower hallelujah and that woman was
[1:31:01] falling into those flames
[1:31:03] she started reeling mincing like that
[1:31:06] and off she fell off the narrow road but
[1:31:09] Ram said he heard the screams of the
[1:31:11] flames and everything like that and
[1:31:13] brother BAM said he turned around to the
[1:31:14] people and said see and brother Branham
[1:31:19] says she just obeyed everything but one
[1:31:20] word one word don't wear high heels
[1:31:25] don't push out yourself you know try to
[1:31:27] attract men science has proved it women
[1:31:29] are get more sexual looks and lust when
[1:31:32] they wear high heels science has proved
[1:31:34] it it pushes out their body it puts our
[1:31:36] body in a way that's not supposed to be
[1:31:39] now can you see yourself in this one can
[1:31:44] you see yourself I'm walking on the
[1:31:47] Kings Highway
[1:31:47] I've been justified like this I got
[1:31:50] baptized in Jesus Christ name who is
[1:31:53] commit of I got sanctified by the Holy
[1:31:56] Spirit see one step now I'm not stepping
[1:32:00] up here you're crazy if you think I'm
[1:32:01] stepping up here
[1:32:02] but one that there's three steps
[1:32:04] beautiful here we go 1 2 3 I've got the
[1:32:08] bats and once you get the Holy Ghost
[1:32:10] you're not done
[1:32:11] you've got to walk the narrow road honey
[1:32:15] when I walk that narrow road and as you
[1:32:18] as you go longer and Christianity is
[1:32:20] gets more narrow you gotta walk you
[1:32:22] gotta watch your life more closely now
[1:32:23] more than ever don't you brother Jose
[1:32:26] you don't get Lacs on God you've got to
[1:32:29] be more careful how you serve the Lord
[1:32:30] because Jesus said it's a narrow way
[1:32:32] that leads to life broad is the way that
[1:32:34] leads to destruction and you got to make
[1:32:36] sure every step of my life every move I
[1:32:38] make everything I do is right along this
[1:32:41] narrow road we don't get cold on God we
[1:32:44] know we don't get a weak on God we got
[1:32:46] to stay strong in the Holy Spirit we've
[1:32:49] got to keep our eye Salvin orient in our
[1:32:51] eyes so we can see that white road that
[1:32:53] leads to the pearly gates can't you see
[1:32:55] the bright lights shine it's just about
[1:32:57] home time Church I can see my father
[1:33:00] staying at the pearly gates amen but
[1:33:04] it's a narrow road
[1:33:05] what is it God's put me to the test cuz
[1:33:07] he knows I'll overcome your teacher give
[1:33:10] you a test because they know you studied
[1:33:12] well at least I hope you study that's
[1:33:14] why I give tests make sure they studied
[1:33:15] make sure they learn what they're
[1:33:16] supposed to learn now I'm gonna just go
[1:33:20] through this real quick here here's
[1:33:22] brother BAE I'm giving the altar call so
[1:33:24] how does he end this sermon about you
[1:33:27] know John shouting and all universe
[1:33:29] heard him
[1:33:29] Hansie end the sermon like this before
[1:33:32] we do that senator friend or lukewarm
[1:33:33] church member do you just have a
[1:33:35] membership in a church and do not have a
[1:33:37] membership or if you only have a
[1:33:39] membership you'd be pretty well as well
[1:33:41] off without it
[1:33:42] you need a birth you must come by the
[1:33:46] blood you must come to something that
[1:33:48] spots the sin away - there's no more
[1:33:50] remembrance of it how does brother
[1:33:52] Graham and this mighty sermon about John
[1:33:54] shouting and rejoicing Jesus taking the
[1:33:57] book he's saying we all must be born
[1:33:59] again if you haven't made preparation
[1:34:04] yet to meet the Lamb in the air and by
[1:34:06] the look at this by the power invested
[1:34:07] me by my commission given by Almighty
[1:34:10] God and ministered to me be by an angel
[1:34:13] a pillar of light I charge you
[1:34:15] the name of Jesus Christ don't try to
[1:34:18] meet him with only a membership of a
[1:34:19] lodge he said a church of the earth now
[1:34:23] notice the Prophet is charging the
[1:34:25] people just like Jesus charged his
[1:34:27] followers to be born again you must be
[1:34:29] born again but I'm saying you cannot try
[1:34:32] to get to heaven and make the rapture
[1:34:34] with a church membership I charge you I
[1:34:36] command you you must seek the baptism of
[1:34:38] the Holy Ghost the word charge means the
[1:34:40] command or order he said come while the
[1:34:44] mediator as far as I know is thrown
[1:34:46] throw making intercessions because there
[1:34:48] will come a day when you'll want to come
[1:34:50] and there'll be no mediator that's
[1:34:52] speaking the tribulation receive the
[1:34:54] hour we're living in the seven churches
[1:34:55] in the mysteries of God become what they
[1:34:57] have at the vindicated spirit of God
[1:34:58] showing everything that he promised in
[1:35:00] the last days how much more time is left
[1:35:02] sinner friend
[1:35:03] come father there may be some here
[1:35:06] tonight here without hope and they are
[1:35:08] intelligent human beings and now if the
[1:35:10] blood still lays on the mercy seat let
[1:35:12] the lamb walk down from the throne to
[1:35:14] their heart tonight look at this in this
[1:35:16] beautiful language and reveal to them
[1:35:18] that they are lost and with bloody hands
[1:35:21] say come well it's time to come in that
[1:35:24] beautiful but man paints it like Jesus
[1:35:27] will come all the way down to your heart
[1:35:29] with bloody hands as they come to me
[1:35:31] while there's time they'll show you his
[1:35:33] nail scarred hands he'll show you the
[1:35:35] scar and his side he'll show he'll
[1:35:38] become so personal he'll come right to
[1:35:40] knock on your heart's door how many have
[1:35:43] opened that door of their heart to him
