[2:23] thank you for your patience here
[2:26] so i want to finish this out maybe i can
[2:28] finish this series up by god's grace we
[2:30] looked at david a lot and looked at old
[2:32] testament mighty men and we looked at
[2:34] new testament mighty men and then we
[2:35] looked at paul's a mighty man last time
[2:38] we just looked at scriptures you can use
[2:39] to be mighty
[2:40] over different battles that you'll face
[2:42] and so we'll continue on that here
[2:43] tonight and these are scriptures that
[2:46] you'll learn i'll share the scripture
[2:47] that has really helped me
[2:49] many times
[2:51] when i've been discouraged and i
[2:52] wondered where's god or i'm doubting if
[2:54] i'm doubting in a certain situation i'll
[2:56] share the verse that i go to or i should
[2:58] say like this the verse is the holy
[2:59] ghost directly to you and i'll share
[3:01] brother branham's you might be surprised
[3:02] brother ham said he had a verse he
[3:03] always went to i don't know if you're i
[3:05] don't know if you're familiar with it
[3:06] but uh i was reminded that and i went
[3:08] and studied it out
[3:09] and uh he would always go to the book of
[3:11] romans he said whenever he got
[3:12] discouraged
[3:14] so uh this just means hopefully
[3:16] hopefully an uplifting sermon here i'm
[3:18] sorry i'm a little tired you know the
[3:19] other night i only got four hours of
[3:20] sleep i'm still trying to recover for
[3:22] that i just woke up and my mind was on
[3:24] i'm like okay i gotta get ready for
[3:25] school you know
[3:26] so just a little teeny bit tired you
[3:28] know but other than that we're doing
[3:30] okay by god's grace so
[3:32] the purpose again was to increase our
[3:34] faith in god and so he can work mightily
[3:36] in our lives and we don't want to miss
[3:37] god in the daily work that god is doing
[3:40] we're thankful for all the great
[3:41] testimonies and the miracles that god
[3:43] does but we also know god works in us
[3:45] mightily just to overcome our trials
[3:48] right and so uh we want god's word to
[3:51] work mightily in our daily lives praise
[3:53] god
[3:54] and so hopefully we're being able to use
[3:56] some of these scriptures and they're
[3:57] going to strengthen us you know when we
[3:58] need them the most that's what i'm
[4:00] trusting the holy spirit will bring all
[4:02] things to our remembrance
[4:03] praise god so
[4:07] paul told timothy your faith in the holy
[4:09] scriptures make you mighty
[4:12] and we know they make us mighty to
[4:13] overcome and so
[4:15] if you're ever feeling unseen by god
[4:17] here's a few verses that would encourage
[4:19] you to remember that god sees you okay
[4:22] humble yourselves therefore under the
[4:24] mighty hand of god that he may exalt you
[4:26] in due time casting all your care on him
[4:29] for he careth for you praise god so
[4:32] always remember that god cares for you
[4:34] and remember church you don't have to
[4:35] carry your burdens right you don't have
[4:37] to carry your cares
[4:38] you know i found i found it like this
[4:40] serving the lord for 20 some years now
[4:42] 22 years
[4:43] i found that
[4:45] i'm always going to have burdens i'm
[4:46] always going to have something i'm
[4:47] struggling with but i can either choose
[4:49] to care about it or i can cast it on the
[4:51] lord i found this though it's always
[4:53] going to be on my mind but i don't have
[4:54] to carry the stress of it
[4:56] i don't have to carry the worry of it
[4:58] like i know i've got certain bills i got
[5:00] to pay right you know i know i got this
[5:02] to take care of it i got to get that
[5:03] done before this certain day and i've
[5:05] got different things i got this meeting
[5:07] coming up with that brother who's sister
[5:08] that's upset with me you know or
[5:10] whatever
[5:10] i got this whatever phone call set up
[5:12] with this individual
[5:14] i realize though this the little bit of
[5:16] pressure is always going to be there but
[5:18] if i can have a good prayer meeting and
[5:19] if i can worship god and if i can have
[5:21] the holy spirit fall on me
[5:23] and anoint me afresh in some special way
[5:25] and i can get the joy of the lord back
[5:27] then it doesn't bother me as much
[5:28] because i've been able to cast the care
[5:30] of the lord for example
[5:32] i'm not caring about it i'm not worried
[5:34] about it it's going to be there i know i
[5:36] know i've got to approach it but it's
[5:38] not the same level of struggle praise
[5:40] god so that reminds me that i'm seen by
[5:42] god praise god god sees me because he
[5:45] says i'll take your care amen praise god
[5:48] in other words the whole time i'm
[5:49] struggling with stress god is saying
[5:51] give me that stress oh yeah
[5:53] why
[5:54] in other words if we were stressed out
[5:55] he'd be saying why are you stressed out
[5:56] give me your give me your problems i'll
[5:58] take care of your problems
[6:00] how do you can say amen to that right
[6:02] you know you you're always gonna have
[6:03] problems right some are more severe than
[6:05] others but god is literally saying you
[6:08] don't have to hold those problems i'll
[6:09] take care of those problems
[6:11] so i just thought if you feel like
[6:13] you're unseen remember he cares for you
[6:15] and he's asking you just give me those
[6:17] cares
[6:18] let me lighten that burden a little bit
[6:20] there you go
[6:21] the bible says we have light afflictions
[6:23] amen amen and we can't let these light
[6:25] afflictions feel too heavy we've got to
[6:28] have a way through prayer and
[6:29] remembering god he sees us he's looking
[6:32] on us we got to remember that that's
[6:33] what these services are for you come
[6:35] here and like i said i was tapping on
[6:36] this other side i'm going to tap on it
[6:38] again this is a place you can just leave
[6:39] it there praise god
[6:41] it's a great physical reminder that this
[6:43] is a place i can leave it there i gave
[6:45] it to god and i can walk away free
[6:47] i can walk away knowing that i don't
[6:49] have to care about it anymore god's
[6:50] gonna take care of it praise god
[6:52] and church how many can say amen that
[6:54] you know the times when you cast your
[6:56] care of the lord whatever the problem is
[6:58] it always works out and it's not as bad
[6:59] as what you thought it was gonna be
[7:01] right in most cases it's not as bad as
[7:04] what it's going to be
[7:06] so that means god sees you and he's
[7:08] saying why why would you struggle just
[7:10] give me that problem praise god because
[7:12] i care for you i'm going to help you
[7:13] through this this trial
[7:15] so this scripture has been a great
[7:16] blessing as you know you study and
[7:18] remember that god cares remember he can
[7:20] care because he became flesh that's
[7:22] right right jesus can be touched by the
[7:25] feeling of our infirmities amen praise
[7:27] god that means when you pray church and
[7:30] when we pray and ask god to help us god
[7:32] can feel the stress jesus knows what
[7:34] it's like
[7:35] i should say jesus can feel the stress
[7:36] the invisible spirit can't feel the
[7:38] stress but jesus's human body
[7:41] now glorified can still feel the stress
[7:43] amen praise god because he's got that
[7:45] human spirit he's got the human spirit
[7:47] he can be touched that means he can feel
[7:49] the affirmative affirmity that you're
[7:51] going through praise god that physical
[7:53] body praise god he knows he remembers
[7:55] what that's like
[7:57] and so we thank god that he wants to
[7:59] take our burdens and then but we've got
[8:01] to remember lord help me to cast them on
[8:03] you praise god
[8:04] amen
[8:05] oh this one was on my mind this morning
[8:06] too uh
[8:08] are not two sparrows sold for a farthing
[8:10] a farthing was just a fraction of a
[8:12] penny
[8:14] of course inflation has been huge since
[8:15] then and one of them shall not fall on
[8:18] the ground without your father so god
[8:19] knows every bird that just passed away
[8:21] and laying out there on the ground
[8:23] right how many times my children found
[8:25] little birds and animals laying out
[8:26] there right they passed away i've seen a
[8:27] bird to summer oh poor bird passed away
[8:30] just
[8:30] a robin remember robin was out by
[8:33] uh out by our road i'm actually a one
[8:35] minute got hit by a car
[8:37] in other words even a robin that gets
[8:38] hit by a car god knew what happened to
[8:40] him
[8:42] god sees that in other words god's eyes
[8:44] are on his whole of his creation amen
[8:47] and jesus said but even greater than
[8:48] that the very hairs of your head are all
[8:51] numbered
[8:52] praise god he's got a certain account he
[8:54] knows in other words he knows every
[8:56] detail about you you are seen satan says
[8:59] you're not god doesn't see you he's you
[9:01] know
[9:01] you're too small but the bible said god
[9:04] does see and god does count your hairs
[9:06] amen in other words god counts your
[9:08] problems and god counts your breaths and
[9:10] he comes to everything he knows
[9:12] everything praise god
[9:13] and he cares so he said because i i know
[9:16] the number of your hairs don't fear
[9:19] fear not because you're more valuable
[9:21] than the spirit amen amen amen you mean
[9:24] more to me than the birds we love birds
[9:26] we love all nature but they don't have
[9:28] souls praise god but you've got a soul
[9:30] praise god if god
[9:32] god sent his son jesus to die to redeem
[9:34] your soul amen he sent jesus to pay the
[9:37] price for your sins so you don't have to
[9:40] pay for your sin you have to suffer for
[9:42] your sin the wages of your sin was death
[9:45] right in other words the payment what
[9:48] you deserve for your sins the wages of
[9:50] sin is dead you deserve death but jesus
[9:52] died for you so you don't have to die
[9:54] eternally amen
[9:56] he paid the wages right that you owe he
[9:59] paid your debt praise god he took your
[10:02] suffering upon you and then he says you
[10:04] are more valuable
[10:05] you meet you're more valuable than all
[10:07] the other nature all the other creation
[10:09] you're in my very image amen amen
[10:12] so don't fear praise god amen
[10:14] you're seen by god
[10:16] god sees you amen
[10:19] praise the lord
[10:22] you know just in my humble life course i
[10:23] was raised in america
[10:25] even in my poor state even when we had
[10:27] all those buckets collected in the rain
[10:28] the scripture tells me that god was
[10:30] thinking about me then amen
[10:32] god brought me through the hardest times
[10:34] praise god when i would uh nature every
[10:37] day i go to school i'd almost wear the
[10:38] same sweatpants every day we are that
[10:41] poor sometime i had these black
[10:42] sweatpants i love them but by the time i
[10:44] wore them about a year brother they had
[10:45] to hold them and i kind of got
[10:47] embarrassed you know
[10:49] but they're my favorite sweatpants i
[10:50] still remember those sweatpants
[10:52] they had like a school logo on the side
[10:54] and we just didn't have a whole lot of
[10:55] clothes you know even then i had six
[10:57] kids you know
[10:58] but even at my lowest god still knew all
[11:01] the errors on my head amen he still
[11:03] provided
[11:04] and he tells us don't fear because your
[11:07] value is great
[11:08] and as we as we thought as we prayed
[11:10] earlier our father who art in heaven
[11:12] hallowed be your name your father has a
[11:14] great view watching your life praise god
[11:17] he's got a view all the way up in heaven
[11:19] amen
[11:20] he's got a great view he can look down
[11:21] and see how there's some birds and
[11:22] there's a plant there's austin there's
[11:24] lena their sister naomi and our sister
[11:26] huh there's brother william i see all
[11:28] the children i'm watching over them i
[11:30] know all their hairs i know all their
[11:32] breasts i know everything about them and
[11:33] i'm gonna provide for them praise god
[11:36] there's nothing to fear because your
[11:38] father is watching over you praise god
[11:41] these are mighty these scriptures should
[11:42] make us mighty in our faith amen praise
[11:45] god
[11:46] not to fear
[11:47] because we're more valuable god knows
[11:49] about everything that falls everything
[11:50] that raises everything that grows god
[11:52] knows the number of all of it praise god
[11:54] so our lives are easily in this skate in
[11:56] this nail start hand praise god easily
[11:58] nothing to fear
[12:00] not a depression i know austin has a
[12:02] great testimony of overcoming depression
[12:03] i listened to that uh podcast last week
[12:06] great he said as soon as he got back the
[12:08] depression left praise god amen
[12:10] what a difference just being amongst
[12:11] christian makes praise god hallelujah
[12:14] being uh right where you're supposed to
[12:15] be like that song says right where i'm
[12:17] supposed to be praise god
[12:19] it uh brings you out of depression
[12:21] remember the greatest depression
[12:22] recorded in the bible was when jesus was
[12:24] in the garden of gethsemane
[12:26] that was the bible said he was very
[12:28] heavy if you click on that word heavy
[12:29] and the greek it means depression
[12:32] so no one ever suffered depression worse
[12:34] than jesus
[12:35] because he was so depressed he was
[12:37] sweating blood
[12:39] right and when was the last time you
[12:40] sweated blood because you were so
[12:41] depressed
[12:43] just never happened
[12:44] so the greatest amount of stress ever on
[12:47] an individual was jesus christ
[12:50] the weight of the world the sin of the
[12:51] whole world
[12:52] and think about that church i mean even
[12:54] he had the garden of e garden get
[12:56] somebody there sweating drops of blood
[12:58] and and remember uh not not too long
[13:00] before that moses and elijah visited him
[13:03] to speak of him of his deceased
[13:06] so he had heavenly visitations he had
[13:08] angel visitations he had the saints
[13:10] visit him he had all these visitations
[13:12] to prepare him and yet it was still the
[13:14] most stressful most depressing thing you
[13:17] could ever go through think about that
[13:18] to be left by god he was left by god he
[13:21] said my god my god why are you forsaking
[13:23] me
[13:24] so there could be no greater depression
[13:26] than being forsaken by god but yet jesus
[13:29] went through it and he did it with the
[13:31] right attitude the attitude
[13:33] [Applause]
[13:36] he sweat drops of blood in depression so
[13:38] i didn't have to praise god
[13:40] [Music]
[13:41] thank god he then
[13:44] he went through depression so we don't
[13:45] have to praise god he was depressed so
[13:48] you could be set free from depression
[13:50] brother austin amen
[13:51] i don't know you praise god so we really
[13:53] got to keep these things in mind praise
[13:54] god that if jesus overcame all these
[13:56] things for us we don't have to remain in
[13:58] them yes we've got to walk through them
[14:00] yes we've got to be tempted with them
[14:02] we've got to go through all these trials
[14:04] right we've got to go through tests
[14:05] we've got to overcome something if we
[14:06] want to be overcomers
[14:08] but we must remember that jesus already
[14:11] paid the price to free us from all these
[14:13] praise god and he's given us scriptures
[14:15] to make us mighty to overcome them
[14:17] praise god amen and we don't have to
[14:19] live in them we got to battle them but
[14:21] we don't have to be defeated we don't
[14:23] have to be slaves to them that's right
[14:25] in other words i will not be a slave to
[14:27] depression amen i will not be a slave uh
[14:31] to feeling i'm all alone
[14:33] or god doesn't see me
[14:34] i'm not gonna be a slave to having a
[14:36] pity party
[14:38] right we're all gonna feel like it we're
[14:40] gonna get discouraged but we've got to
[14:41] overcome that how are you gonna overcome
[14:44] god does see me he sees these these
[14:47] hairs he numbers all of them praise god
[14:50] he's aware of my problems he's aware of
[14:53] what i'm going through praise god he is
[14:55] mindful of them and he said don't fear
[14:56] in other words have faith in your trials
[14:58] amen amen
[14:59] have faith in your child church amen
[15:03] so here's a great good scripture on
[15:04] overcoming depression david writes my
[15:07] soul thirsts for god for the living god
[15:09] when shall i come and appear before god
[15:11] in other words he wouldn't get in the
[15:12] presence of god when am i going to be in
[15:13] the presence of god
[15:15] now look my tears have been my meet day
[15:17] and night i think amen sings the songs
[15:19] about this uh
[15:20] all my tears have been my
[15:22] it's a shane's chainsaw i can't remember
[15:24] do you remember what it was now okay
[15:26] what is it called
[15:27] i'm not fond of living water okay yeah
[15:29] we found it yeah maybe we'll see that if
[15:31] we can at the end
[15:35] so david what are you eating every day
[15:37] tears
[15:39] now let's look at this while they
[15:40] continually say to me where's your god
[15:42] now church look at that look at the
[15:44] pressure david went through
[15:46] i mean
[15:47] look at that people are where's your guy
[15:50] and you're crying all the time if you
[15:51] walk up why are you crying where's your
[15:53] god i thought you said god loved you
[15:55] i thought you said god was your heavenly
[15:56] father he is
[15:58] but david david was suffering so much
[16:01] he's crying every day and my mockers are
[16:03] coming up saying where's god how come
[16:04] god hasn't answered your prayers where's
[16:06] that anointing that you got anointed
[16:08] with think about that brother
[16:09] see that anointing that natural
[16:11] anointing regard eventually drying up
[16:13] but the anointing in the soul can never
[16:15] dry up
[16:18] they poured oil on his
[16:20] head naturally but for us in the new
[16:22] testament we get a spiritual anointing
[16:24] that can never leave praise god and we
[16:27] can say our soul runs over praise god
[16:29] amen
[16:31] may it be so church maybe so that the
[16:33] anointing overflows out of our soul into
[16:36] our mind and onto our bodies so we can
[16:38] worship god amen amen
[16:40] but look at this look at the persecution
[16:42] reminds me of something that you went
[16:43] through sister you know with all the all
[16:45] the verbal persecution you've gone
[16:47] through in your life
[16:49] is your god
[16:51] where's god i thought you said you're a
[16:52] believer i thought god was the healer
[16:54] brother said if i prayed for a thousand
[16:56] people remember this quote and they all
[16:58] died the next morning i pray for divine
[17:00] healing
[17:02] that's the kind of faith that he had
[17:03] praise god
[17:05] that's why these people come out against
[17:06] brother brown and say well i got the
[17:07] prayer line and i didn't get healed
[17:10] well that that either wasn't god's will
[17:12] or you didn't believe or there's all
[17:13] those reasons god doesn't do divine
[17:14] healing but what about all the people
[17:16] that god healed amen what about all
[17:18] those great testimonies praise god
[17:21] and the fact is even if you get healed
[17:23] eventually you're going to get sick
[17:24] whether it's a week later or a month
[17:26] later or a year later you're eventually
[17:27] going to get sick anyway
[17:29] right but what about all the miracles
[17:31] praise god did they forget about that
[17:33] but see the devil say where's god
[17:34] where's god so we've got to cast that
[17:36] aside we can't be depressed
[17:38] right david was definitely the state of
[17:40] depression which he probably should have
[17:41] been because of being a fugitive
[17:44] but he says but then look he asked
[17:46] himself this is a good question see
[17:48] whenever we're struggling you'll notice
[17:50] whenever you're in the midst of a battle
[17:52] some positive thing will just suddenly
[17:54] come to your mind oh that's gone amen
[17:56] that's god trying to encourage you amen
[17:59] that's the holy spirit bringing
[18:00] everything to our remembrance praise god
[18:02] amen
[18:04] where's your god where's your god where
[18:05] god all of a sudden it's like heaven
[18:07] opens up and it pours down this saw on
[18:09] your mind
[18:10] why are you cast down
[18:12] my soul oh yeah it's like that song of
[18:14] gratitude come with my soul don't you
[18:17] get shy on me praise god don't get shy
[18:18] on me praise god
[18:20] we look at we take too much time to look
[18:21] at the natural instead of looking at the
[18:23] spiritual praise god we look at the
[18:25] earthly instead of looking up to
[18:27] heavenly praise god
[18:28] amen look at this where's your god and
[18:30] all of a sudden
[18:32] then the real questions come why are you
[18:34] cast down
[18:36] see the devil's question is where's god
[18:38] but the real question is why are you why
[18:40] are you cast down why why would you be
[18:41] discouraged
[18:43] why would you made this courage why are
[18:45] thou disquieted in me
[18:47] hope thou and god amen for i shall yet
[18:51] praise him for the help of his
[18:52] countenance praise god
[18:54] in other words i'm going to get the
[18:56] victory eventually i'm going to get back
[18:57] to the house of god and i'm going to
[18:59] give god praise i have hope in jesus
[19:01] amen amen all my hope is in jesus amen
[19:05] amen all my yesterdays are gone praise
[19:07] god i love that song my hope is in jesus
[19:09] name
[19:10] all my sins are forgiven i've been
[19:12] washing the blood praise god
[19:15] see so when you're depressed and
[19:17] everyone uh the devil's saying where's
[19:18] god where's god god will send a question
[19:20] to you why would you be cast
[19:22] out why are you quiet get up and praise
[19:25] the lord
[19:28] god help us amen i know you will praise
[19:31] god god will help us amen amen
[19:33] to get up and praise the lord despite
[19:35] our trials amen
[19:37] hallelujah
[19:39] don't ever lose your hope church what is
[19:40] depression you feel hopeless right
[19:42] austin remember you're talking about
[19:43] that in your testimony

[19:48] to work what's the good of taking a
[19:50] shower right what's the good of anything
[19:52] feel hopeless
[19:54] like there's no hope
[19:56] right
[19:57] and we bat we'll go through that we'll
[19:58] battle through that
[20:00] but it just takes one question from god
[20:02] glory that's why i remember said i can
[20:04] say all these words but one word from
[20:06] god will change the whole situation
[20:09] amen day and night cry day and night

[20:14] but one word from god says praise god i
[20:16] will get back to the house of god i know

[21:52] okay good praise the lord
[21:54] so
[21:55] who wants to know brother ramsey's go to
[21:56] verse when he got discouraged right here
[21:58] i hear this
[21:59] romans 4 brother i never would have
[22:01] guessed
[22:02] i never would have guessed it i got a
[22:03] quote before too so i'm not making this
[22:04] up
[22:06] romans 4 19
[22:07] and abraham being not weak in faith
[22:11] he would consider not his own body now
[22:13] dead
[22:14] when he was about a hundred years old
[22:16] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[22:19] so church abraham was looking at his
[22:21] body i'm dead my body doesn't work
[22:23] anymore to have a child
[22:25] we all know what i'm saying right my
[22:26] body's not working but yet i believe in
[22:28] god
[22:30] i don't see any i don't see any ability
[22:32] in my body to have a child
[22:35] but yet god can make it happen amen
[22:37] he staggered not at the promise of god
[22:40] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[22:43] giving glory to god amen
[22:47] and being fully persuaded that what he
[22:49] had promised he was able to perform amen
[22:52] oh my what a beautiful promise
[22:54] a 99 year old man
[22:57] right he was a hundred when he had isaac
[23:00] his wife was 90. sarah was 90. a 100
[23:02] year old man
[23:04] even though every every symptom said he
[23:07] can't have a son every symptom said he
[23:09] used his his body organs are dead to
[23:11] produce a child yet he didn't consider
[23:14] that he remembered thus saith the lord
[23:16] amen
[23:18] amen
[23:20] and when you would see abraham he was
[23:22] always at church giving god glory amen
[23:25] and of course he had some of his moments
[23:27] of depression too right we know he had
[23:28] his moments of lie right we know he had
[23:30] his moments of stumbling
[23:32] but the bible said you would find him he
[23:35] didn't stagger at the promise of god so
[23:37] in other words when he stumbled he got
[23:38] back up
[23:40] when he made a mistake he said forgive
[23:42] me and he kept trying to serve god
[23:44] hallelujah he was strong in faith giving
[23:47] god glory can we give god some glory
[23:49] tonight praise god
[23:50] we should let's all say glory to god
[23:52] heaven glory to god in the midst of my
[23:54] trials let's say it again ready glory to
[23:56] god no matter what you're going through
[23:58] give god the glory
[24:00] don't stagger at the promise of god
[24:02] don't stagger at god's process to make
[24:05] you wait don't be discouraged in that
[24:07] trust god if he brought you this far
[24:09] he's gonna bring you the rest of the way
[24:11] praise god
[24:12] he won't fail you he's a faithful father
[24:15] he's numbered the very hairs of your
[24:16] head amen
[24:19] so here's the quote brother says
[24:20] listen this
[24:22] who against hope this is from works his
[24:23] faith expressed look at that brother a
[24:25] month before he died
[24:27] exactly almost exactly a month minus two
[24:29] days before he died
[24:32] against hope all hope was gone oh let's
[24:35] look at this brother every time i go to
[24:37] feeling a little blue
[24:38] here's the chapter i turn to
[24:41] and that's something we got we have a
[24:42] little peek into a prophet's life
[24:45] whenever he got discouraged
[24:47] where should i go should i go to alcohol
[24:49] did he go to the bottom
[24:51] every time he got blue how about
[24:52] cigarettes
[24:54] oh no
[24:55] how about movie theaters no no you
[24:58] didn't know how to move
[25:02] we can name a million things did he go
[25:04] to his bank account
[25:06] no
[25:07] every time i get blue i go to chapter
[25:10] four of the book of romans praise god oh
[25:12] may god help us every time we get
[25:14] discouraged go to a sermon go to a song
[25:17] text a brother or sister do something
[25:19] but go to the word of god amen amen amen
[25:22] brother sister might give you the word
[25:24] of god right
[25:25] give me a verse on this sir
[25:27] can you pray for me with this situation
[25:30] every time i feel a little sad a little
[25:31] depressed i go to romans chapter 4.
[25:33] that's right
[25:36] he said see who quickens the dead and
[25:39] call those things which were not as
[25:41] though they were god said so so whenever
[25:43] program got discouraged he said god said
[25:45] this
[25:46] god's word said this god promised him so
[25:49] i'm going to believe it praise god i'm
[25:51] going to keep encouraging myself in the
[25:53] lord that god's promise can't fail
[25:55] praise god amen
[25:58] whenever i get blue
[26:00] i turn to romans chapter four
[26:02] good one to remember right by the way
[26:03] that's a pretty good one remember
[26:05] may god bring that to my
[26:08] remembrance now i'm going to get past
[26:10] that he just quotes that scripture i
[26:12] just read
[26:15] now you remember this one i just i
[26:16] preached two years ago so i'm gonna
[26:18] bring it back up i mentioned a few weeks
[26:19] ago
[26:20] what about talked about imperfect faith
[26:22] yeah that's why i was listening to it
[26:24] you talked about people that would drive
[26:26] a long distance to go to their services
[26:28] i appreciate that effort some of you
[26:29] will drive home tonight because you got
[26:31] to go to work by daylight in the morning
[26:33] i know it's hard and then when i think i
[26:35] get spells too you know i get moody
[26:37] brother and got moody sometimes
[26:39] i get to a spot where what gets me is i
[26:41] get in those spells when i'm all
[26:44] overworked
[26:47] and satan comes telling me why nobody
[26:49] cares for you
[26:50] you haven't got a friend in the world
[26:52] see
[26:53] now remember i'm not immune to that
[26:55] temptation honestly
[26:56] i love brother graham he was so honest i
[26:58] thought he was a true christian true
[27:00] holy ghost real christian i can totally
[27:02] relate to him in many not in everything
[27:04] but not in divisions but everything
[27:05] about everything else his battle against
[27:07] sin and his victories
[27:10] see i got to overcome that oh brother i
[27:12] had to overcome the blues
[27:15] brother brown had to overcome that
[27:17] nobody cares for you
[27:18] nobody likes you
[27:21] you have no friends
[27:24] no one even nobody even thinks about you
[27:26] brother
[27:28] he says and then when i look back and
[27:30] see something like this all these people
[27:31] driving this distance
[27:33] i put it right back in satan's face and
[27:35] say what about that he said that helps
[27:37] me overcome what about that praise god
[27:40] the t-shirts in your life look for
[27:42] moments when you know someone loves you
[27:46] look for moments when you see god
[27:48] answering your prayers so when satan
[27:49] comes back you can stick that in satan's
[27:51] face and say look at this
[27:53] you're wrong
[27:54] god's people love me i am god does see
[27:57] me praise god god does care me pray god
[27:59] does care
[28:00] how do he's provided for me before he'll
[28:03] provide for me again praise god amen
[28:06] hallelujah
[28:07] so see the devil always puts things in
[28:09] your ear why don't you put something in
[28:11] his ear
[28:13] give him back right
[28:14] what is that what do they say give him a
[28:16] taste of his own medicine right
[28:18] he's giving you this poison medicine why
[28:19] don't you give him some some of your
[28:20] good medicine
[28:22] some of god's medicine amen
[28:24] that's what i said moses had a medicine
[28:27] cabinet
[28:28] and his medicine cabinet was psalms 103
[28:30] praise god that's right i'm the lord thy
[28:32] god that heals all thy diseases amen
[28:35] amen
[28:37] praise god see satan's always putting
[28:39] something in your face put something in
[28:40] his face that's right
[28:42] put the word of god in his face
[28:45] praise the lord
[28:47] oh god doesn't care about me put well
[28:49] satan the bible said god has the very
[28:51] hairs of my head number so i'm not
[28:53] afraid about anything amen that's a
[28:55] mighty that's a mighty christian right
[28:56] there
[28:57] see because if not satan will get the
[28:58] victory over here then you'll be
[28:59] depressed and discouraged week after
[29:02] week month after month praise god
[29:04] looks like when you come to church
[29:06] you're eating sour patch kids or
[29:07] something like that because you're
[29:09] so sour
[29:11] want to smile at anybody
[29:12] i heard a preacher sit down with them
[29:14] you can sour patch kids all the time
[29:18] no smiling when you should be smiling at
[29:20] church
[29:21] just be happy praise god amen god died
[29:24] for you he said it's time to die for you
[29:25] praise god
[29:27] he cares he wants you to cast those
[29:29] characters he doesn't want you to be
[29:30] stressed out he doesn't want you
[29:32] depressed he wants you to know that he's
[29:33] right there with you praise god
[29:36] amen amen it's about time we put
[29:38] something in the devil's face
[29:40] right now the trouble is when we get our
[29:42] phones sometimes we put the we get
[29:44] accidentally get the wrong thing in our
[29:45] face right
[29:46] that's the devil too
[29:48] but we got to put something in devil's
[29:49] face
[29:51] so this is what the word of god says
[29:52] praise god
[29:55] hallelujah
[29:57] that's what i was doing on sunday
[29:58] remember last sunday i was talking no
[30:00] last wednesday night i was preaching
[30:01] about the roe v wade see whatever satan
[30:03] says tells me oh god god doesn't hear
[30:05] your prayers god doesn't hear prayers
[30:07] about this nation i just can take that
[30:09] roving weight and i can stick it right
[30:10] into the devil's face
[30:11] and said i prayed for this i cried for
[30:13] this for three or four years and god
[30:15] heard my prayer god does care amen amen
[30:18] he cares about the unborn children
[30:21] did you know idaho
[30:23] indiana what was the other one america i
[30:24] know indiana and another state
[30:27] just passed laws there's absolutely no
[30:29] abortion in those states anymore
[30:31] now of course some of those sinners are
[30:32] going to go outside the state and get
[30:33] abortions but think how many lives are
[30:35] being saved
[30:36] people won't have abortions now because
[30:38] it's illegal
[30:40] i thought glory to god god's gonna honor
[30:41] those states amen
[30:43] hallelujah see so when i get to victory
[30:45] i can stick it in satan's face too
[30:47] praise god
[30:48] hallelujah but man would say these
[30:50] people drive all night devil so get
[30:52] behind me
[30:54] these people care for me i've got
[30:56] friends who drive hundreds of miles just
[30:58] to see me just to hear me preach i've
[31:00] got lots of friends and they love jesus
[31:02] and we're on jesus side and jesus cares
[31:04] about me praise god
[31:06] put that in the devil's face
[31:09] be mighty in the word of god hallelujah
[31:14] praise the lord
[31:18] sometimes we don't feel like we're loved
[31:20] right
[31:20] but faith in the scriptures makes us
[31:22] feel loved
[31:24] remember i had all these notes to preach
[31:25] a few weeks ago i never got to it and i
[31:27] had all these other thoughts so i added
[31:29] a few here tonight but
[31:31] when you feel unloved the bible says
[31:33] this is what i've been going through
[31:34] over the last few years ever since i
[31:36] preached on that sermon uh
[31:38] the i am remember i preach that i am
[31:41] i preach all the uh the i am scriptures
[31:43] i am who you say i am there's a song
[31:45] that has that ever since i preached that
[31:47] i saw the scripture i'm like oh my lord
[31:49] this whole time i've been forgetting
[31:51] that i am god's beloved
[31:53] that's what i am i can tell the devil
[31:55] well you're devil you're going to get
[31:56] burned in the lake of fire but i am
[31:58] god's beloved amen that's what i am amen
[32:01] because god said so i didn't say so god
[32:03] said so
[32:04] and i believe god's word above my own i
[32:06] believe god's word above the devil's
[32:08] word amen amen even us whom we have
[32:10] called not the jews only but also of the
[32:13] gentiles that's what you are gentile
[32:16] as he said in the book of hosea which is
[32:18] oc and the
[32:20] in the greek
[32:21] translated english i will call them my
[32:24] people which were not my people and her
[32:26] my beloved which was not my beloved so
[32:29] church we we could honestly say as
[32:31] gentiles we were not god's beloved a
[32:33] little over 2 000 years ago but now we
[32:36] are right now there was a time when we
[32:38] weren't there's a time when maybe my
[32:39] ancestors way down the line we're not
[32:42] god's beloved but today i am god's
[32:45] beloved he cares about me all the hairs
[32:47] on my head are numbered praise god i'm

[32:57] midst of my deepest trials amen amen
[33:00] when he said i am his beloved amen which
[33:03] one of you would let your beloved go

[33:08] temptation is common to man anything
[33:10] you're going through somebody else
[33:11] already went through it right
[33:14] may not be somebody in the church but
[33:15] somebody somewhere has gone through what
[33:17] you're going through already

[33:22] and remember church you can't trust your
[33:23] feelings all the time

[33:34] of all this proof
[33:36] around you

[33:48] lord

[34:03] god commended or proved his love to us
[34:07] while we were yet sinners christ died
[34:09] for us
[34:10] the very proof god loves you is in the
[34:12] cross of jesus christ
[34:14] we don't have to look any further than
[34:16] the cross
[34:18] when you see the cross that's god's love
[34:20] amen that's why i like when people wear
[34:22] that around their neck they don't have
[34:23] to i don't do it but i like sitting on

[34:26] love that cross praise god
[34:28] reminds me of god's love for me praise

[35:34] doubt church amen
[35:35] and this is my go-to verse here's
[35:38] so many times i have doubt
[35:40] i doubt how's this going to work out
[35:42] did i do something wrong like is god
[35:44] gonna punish me if i don't do this or if
[35:47] i don't make this choice is god gonna i
[35:48] just doubt so many times you know not
[35:50] having a dad it's like i always doubt
[35:52] because i never had a dad like i never
[35:53] had dad just there
[35:54] he just wasn't there all the time you
[35:56] know i feel like as a man you need a
[35:58] good male role model right so i feel
[36:00] like i've always had doubt issues you
[36:01] know am i doing this right am i a
[36:04] failure uh you know i just always i've
[36:06] always battled that always

[36:10] god
[36:11] hopefully my kids don't have to but i
[36:13] see i talked to some of my siblings and
[36:14] they battled the same thing doubt just
[36:16] because dad was never there
[36:18] uh
[36:19] that you know
[36:20] it's just been difficult for us you know
[36:22] not having a dad a broken home that's
[36:24] kind of the effect of a broken home
[36:26] at least i've seen my life so this is my
[36:28] go-to verse brother william many times
[36:30] i've noticed over the last few years
[36:31] i've heard brother ben talk about his
[36:32] go-to verse sometimes i'll be struggling
[36:34] i'll be all stressed out on my phone or
[36:36] i just go to prayer and the verse that
[36:38] was it feels like it comes down from
[36:40] heaven is trust in the lord with all
[36:43] your heart amen see i'm doubting i'm
[36:46] dying i'm just going to work out how is
[36:48] this going to happen i don't even know
[36:49] what's going to what is going to happen
[36:50] next how is this going to work out we're
[36:52] going to have a church or uh are we
[36:54] gonna are we is anyone gonna die before
[36:56] the rapture are we gonna live to the
[36:57] rapture i get all these worries all
[36:58] these stresses how can you pay for this
[37:00] medical expense how's all this gonna
[37:02] happen and it's like a verse will come
[37:03] down saying trust in the lord without
[37:05] you stop doubting trust in god amen amen
[37:09] instead of putting all your energy into
[37:10] dieting put all your energy into
[37:12] trusting praise god that's my go-to
[37:14] verse
[37:15] because it's like god bringing me to the
[37:17] verse
[37:18] not that i'm perfect like every time i
[37:19] battle okay i'm going to proverbs
[37:21] chapter 3.
[37:22] i'm human
[37:23] but i notice in the midst of my
[37:25] wondering in the midst of my doubt in
[37:27] the midst of my fear i noticed this
[37:29] verse comes to me most often amen amen
[37:31] in church you know i memorized this
[37:32] verse when i was in fifth grade
[37:35] remember when i told you i went with my
[37:37] friend to this bible class it was called
[37:39] word of life bible class i went with my
[37:40] friend eric
[37:42] i remember i told you that this is
[37:43] before i bought that worldly music cd
[37:45] that led me away from the lord one of
[37:47] the first verses i memorized that that
[37:48] bible fast is this one right here
[37:51] trust the lord with all your heart and
[37:53] lean not to your own understanding see
[37:55] i'm always trying to lead to with my own
[37:57] understanding how can i understand this
[37:59] so i can figure it out how can i solve
[38:01] the problem
[38:02] and that's where i get problems because
[38:03] i can't
[38:05] i can't solve the problem
[38:08] but i noticed when i get victory is when
[38:10] this verse will come to my mind and i'll
[38:12] and i'll figure out that's right i can't
[38:15] i can't solve it anyway i i have no pr i
[38:17] have no power over the universe but i
[38:19] know somebody who does have power in the
[38:21] universe amen hallelujah and he told me
[38:24] to cast my cares on him and he'll take
[38:27] care of our problems praise god
[38:31] and then i remember this in all thy in
[38:33] all my ways acknowledge him and he will
[38:35] make my past straight amen i've just got
[38:37] to trust in the lord
[38:40] i can't figure it out
[38:42] i can't work it out only jesus can work
[38:44] amen
[38:46] so i've noticed this is the verse the
[38:48] holy spirit brings to me in my moments
[38:50] of doubt my moments of
[38:52] of depression we say just minor i've
[38:54] never been through it like some of some
[38:56] but
[38:58] this verse will come like shooting down
[39:00] from heaven and i'm glad because jesus
[39:01] said the holy ghost will bring all these
[39:03] things to your remembrance amen this is
[39:05] the one god has proved to me this is the
[39:06] one that god has written upon my heart
[39:08] so many years ago when i was in fifth
[39:10] grade and it keeps coming back to me in
[39:12] my darkest hours praise god amen trust
[39:14] in god don't trust in yourself amen
[39:17] you cannot work it out you can't solve
[39:19] the problem you've got to trust in god
[39:25] now this is kind of related you know
[39:26] with depression but anxiety
[39:29] some scriptures overcome anxiety
[39:32] i heard uh charles spurgeon said he was
[39:34] a preacher in the uh
[39:36] the 1800s
[39:38] and he said i love the i will verses of
[39:40] god because that's not somebody saying
[39:43] now god will still do what he told a
[39:45] prophet he would do but when god says i
[39:48] will
[39:49] that's even better praise god
[39:52] god is saying god's not telling a
[39:54] prophet to tell them i will do this god
[39:56] is saying i will do this
[39:59] that's what isaiah 41 i think this might
[40:01] have been haven's verse right fear thou
[40:03] not for i am with thee be not dismayed
[40:06] for i am thy god i am thy god i will
[40:09] strengthen the yea i will help thee yay
[40:11] yes i will uphold you with the right
[40:14] hand of my righteousness
[40:17] god is saying yes i'm with you
[40:19] yes i will strengthen you yes i will
[40:22] help you and yes i will hold you up when
[40:25] you feel like you're going to fall i'm
[40:26] going to be the one that holds you up
[40:28] praise god amen in other words don't
[40:30] worry about falling i'm going to catch
[40:31] you amen
[40:33] i've got you right i've got your back
[40:34] right right
[40:37] in other words i'm your safety net
[40:38] nature
[40:40] god is your safety net i will catch you
[40:42] before you fall praise god
[40:44] i'm right there there's nothing to fear
[40:46] i will do it i'm faithful i care about
[40:49] you i love you praise god don't worry
[40:51] about it don't stress about it i'm your
[40:53] safety net praise god
[40:55] i'm your security
[40:57] praise god now if i was your security i
[40:59] could help you for a little bit but i
[41:01] couldn't help you all the time
[41:02] now the great part is i'm not your
[41:04] security net got your security net
[41:06] praise god because i'll let you down my
[41:07] net sometimes rips it like that
[41:10] but i get discouraged i can't help it i
[41:12] couldn't help you the way you need help
[41:14] but god is greater than any man
[41:17] god cannot lie god is faithful he ever
[41:19] lives to be your safety net praise god
[41:22] amen amen
[41:24] is your strength in time of trouble
[41:28] he will uphold you with his right hand
[41:30] of righteousness
[41:32] his hand will be right there when you
[41:34] feel like you can't go on any further
[41:35] his hand will be right there to grab you
[41:37] under your hand and say come on come on
[41:39] haven't come up
[41:40] i'm your right hand on righteousness
[41:42] ain't gonna happen
[41:43] who reach out that hand he'll grab a
[41:45] hold of your hand and he'll carry you
[41:47] through praise god
[41:48] they'll lead you through the darkest
[41:50] times the darkest hours
[41:52] so the bible said don't worry about
[41:55] anything the bible says do not worry
[41:57] about anything
[42:00] you're worried about the inflation
[42:02] worried about end of the world
[42:05] they try to make us worry about nuclear
[42:07] problems you know
[42:08] we try to make you worry about all these
[42:10] things but the bible specifically says
[42:12] don't worry about anything
[42:15] but in every dark trial right every
[42:18] every test by prayer that's that's why i
[42:20] always preach on prayer right
[42:22] spend time with god prayer and
[42:24] supplication of supplication is
[42:25] interceding for other people
[42:27] by prayer and interceding with
[42:29] thanksgiving
[42:30] let your requests be made known unto god
[42:32] amen
[42:35] and the peace of god that's why i like
[42:37] that song all my ways are known to you
[42:39] oh what peace that i have found
[42:41] hallelujah
[42:42] oh what peace that i have found wherever
[42:45] i may be
[42:46] all my ways are known to you oh lord all
[42:49] my ways are known to you see he's right
[42:52] there what peace what great peace do you
[42:54] find what when we pray with thanksgiving
[42:57] that's when we find the peace of god
[42:59] the bible promises if you pray this way
[43:02] the peace of god will come over you
[43:04] don't even understand it the peace of
[43:06] god is going to come on you and it's
[43:07] going to guard your heart and mind
[43:09] through jesus christ amen it's going to
[43:11] keep you in the right place
[43:13] if you cast all your worries cast all
[43:16] your anxieties on god because he cares
[43:18] for you
[43:20] aren't you glad to care church aren't
[43:22] you glad tonight amen praise
[43:25] preach 40 minutes okay so i'm going to
[43:27] try to finish up here hopefully i always
[43:29] think i'm gonna
[43:30] get done
[43:32] so the guaranteed
[43:34] the guaranteed scriptures are i will i
[43:36] will strengthen you i will uphold you i
[43:39] will guide you i'll help you praise god
[43:41] if you just cast your cares upon me
[43:44] i promise my peace will come to you
[43:46] i promise
[43:49] praise god
[43:51] but it takes what it takes a person who
[43:52] will pray some of the time or every time
[43:55] god wants us to pray every time
[43:57] we won't be perfect but he says in every
[44:00] trial in everything by prayer and
[44:02] supplication
[44:05] he says i'll give you the peace of god
[44:06] if you want the peace of god
[44:11] makes me want to sing peace of god cover
[44:12] me up only we had amen here
[44:16] we could probably do it that guy could
[44:17] provide you back there
[44:21] my voice is out you know once i get back
[44:22] to school i talk all day you know so
[44:24] i need some help back there but i need a
[44:26] song later so
[44:28] so when you feel like you're a failure
[44:30] how many never felt like you're a
[44:31] failure you don't raise your hand
[44:32] i felt like that many times
[44:34] i remember last time when i went through
[44:36] my school test last year uh you know to
[44:38] get graded as a teacher nature i was
[44:39] getting graded the first let you get two
[44:41] lessons right the first lesson i got to
[44:44] see
[44:45] and i didn't realize i was so
[44:47] discouraged i'm like what do you mean i
[44:48] was like reading the i got a c on the
[44:50] first one i thought oh i'm gonna have to
[44:53] tell the church now i didn't get an a
[44:54] i'm not the best teacher i could be
[44:56] i was so discouraged but then i read it
[44:58] i read it and i said oh yeah you can you
[45:00] can actually raise your score on the
[45:02] next
[45:03] observation i'm like ah glory
[45:05] i was feeling like a failure until i
[45:07] read the fine print i had to read a
[45:08] little more and i realized i didn't have
[45:10] to be a failure i get a chance to redeem
[45:12] myself
[45:13] i've forgotten a couple of things i was
[45:15] like oh yeah i got to do this and that's
[45:16] right i gotta give this option for the
[45:18] kids i gotta get more options
[45:20] i gotta give challenges in the lesson
[45:21] but also i gotta
[45:23] i also gotta uh make it easier for some
[45:25] kids in the lesson if they can't do what
[45:27] i'm asking them to do
[45:29] and so i i took courage i felt i felt
[45:31] like a failure for a few weeks
[45:33] then i took courage and the next time i
[45:35] i made the corrections then when my
[45:38] principal came in i
[45:39] i i did the best i could i got his
[45:42] emails and oh you got you got
[45:44] outstanding is this you earned the
[45:45] highest grade as a teacher
[45:47] now this is just one small example of
[45:49] church
[45:50] but failure on the job can haunt you
[45:52] right
[45:54] nobody here wants to fail in their job
[45:57] you see that's one area where i
[45:58] struggled you know last year i was
[45:59] feeling like a failure for a couple
[46:00] weeks like god i've given you all this
[46:02] you know i've given you a dollar i've
[46:04] given you a part of my whole life for
[46:05] you and i don't want to become a
[46:07] average teacher
[46:09] i feel like a failure
[46:11] but then when i read and studied and i
[46:13] said oh i didn't realize this now i can
[46:15] overcome my god's grace amen
[46:17] so i got the highest grade by god's
[46:19] grace
[46:21] now spiritually that's just a natural
[46:22] example the more important one is
[46:23] spiritual now thanks be unto god which
[46:26] always everybody say always ready oh
[46:28] that sometimes always causes you
[46:31] to triumph in christ in other words god
[46:33] always makes me the winner
[46:36] praise god amen
[46:39] god always makes me the victory
[46:42] so picture yourself like on a track or
[46:45] picture yourself like in a contest who's
[46:47] always going to get top place nature you
[46:49] are
[46:51] the devils are always going to be
[46:52] overcome by god in you
[46:55] sisterhood you're always going to be on
[46:56] top of the podium
[46:58] i got my picture up there a couple times
[46:59] as a state champ you know i was on top i
[47:01] felt pretty good everybody's cheering
[47:03] for me i felt pretty good
[47:06] but that's nothing compared to this
[47:08] where in spiritual matters god always
[47:10] raises you up above the enemy oh i'm
[47:12] gonna take a praise god always not
[47:15] sometimes i lost some but i won some but
[47:18] in this case brother william you don't
[47:19] lose any time you win all the time
[47:22] praise
[47:23] i'm always going to overcome satan
[47:25] praise god
[47:26] right why because christ is causing me
[47:28] ah amen there there's that hand that
[47:31] hell that reaches out when i fall he
[47:33] grabs me and he causes me to win the
[47:35] battle praise god
[47:37] oh hallelujah
[47:38] not sometimes always amen amen
[47:42] hallelujah
[47:44] i'm always the winner
[47:46] but i know it's by grace
[47:48] right
[47:49] so not something i brag on but i realize
[47:51] he's causing me because i've dedicated
[47:53] my life i surrendered my life to him he
[47:56] takes full responsibility for me man
[48:00] just like a real husband right a real
[48:01] husband's not gonna let his wife
[48:03] uh you know get abused or or get
[48:06] neglected a real man is going to provide
[48:08] for his wife all the time
[48:10] amen that's why when we when we run out
[48:12] of eggs sisterhood and it's 10 o'clock
[48:14] at night i say i'm going to go buy eggs
[48:16] tonight a giant eagle praise god i'm
[48:17] going to make that extra half hour trip
[48:19] and i'm gonna i'm gonna always cause my
[48:21] family to have food in other words
[48:23] i'm not gonna let them laugh
[48:26] that's just a small example what about
[48:28] people that give their lives and really
[48:29] sacrifice really sacrifice really
[48:32] struggle
[48:33] but if i won't let my natural family uh
[48:36] have once what about a god
[48:38] and not church see we ought to give god
[48:40] thanks this ought to make us thankful
[48:42] god you always make me the victor praise
[48:44] god amen thank you for making me the
[48:46] victor amen i'm not the loser i'm the
[48:49] winner praise god
[48:51] i'm always the winner hallelujah
[48:54] he's always making me win because i'm
[48:56] his beloved praise god
[49:01] and he makes and this makes manifest the
[49:04] savor or the smell the anointing of his
[49:08] knowledge by us in every place
[49:11] in other words wherever god's people are
[49:13] you can always smell the aroma of the
[49:15] holy spirit amen
[49:17] oh this is a place of victory that's
[49:18] what i like what i feel when i come into
[49:19] church i feel victorious when i come to
[49:21] church
[49:22] i smell god's victory here i smell god's
[49:25] uh
[49:26] god's holy anointing oil here praise god
[49:28] this is a place where god's glory dwells
[49:31] this is a place where god's victory is
[49:33] one he's always causing us here by
[49:35] coming to hear the word and praying and
[49:37] worshiping god has given us the victory

[55:07] so there's
[55:08] faith in the scriptures will make you
[55:10] overcome laziness
[55:11] that's something we really got a battle
[55:12] in laodicea right
[55:16] psalm chapter 2 be wise now therefore o
[55:19] ye kings be instructed you judges of the
[55:21] north now look he's talking to kings
[55:22] natural but what are you you're a
[55:24] spiritual king

[55:26] spiritual kingdom
[55:28] serve the lord with fear and rejoice
[55:30] with trembling look at that how can you
[55:32] rejoice while trembling but yet the
[55:34] bible says you can

[55:37] yet you're rejoicing oh jesus loves me
[55:39] he died for me oh thank god for another
[55:41] chance thank god for second chances
[55:43] right you're just rejoicing that god has
[55:45] had mercy on you
[55:47] kiss the son see worship jesus love
[55:49] jesus
[55:50] lest he be angry you perish from the way
[55:52] when his wrath is kindled
[55:54] but a little blessed are all day that
[55:56] put their trust in him amen
[56:00] but the point i want to get to instead
[56:01] of being lazy
[56:02] tremble before the lord
[56:04] right lacy's like i don't want to get
[56:06] close to god i just want to stay in my
[56:08] attitude
[56:10] but when you
[56:11] when you get out of that laziness you
[56:13] tremble the presence of god lord this
[56:15] day is important lord i want to redeem
[56:17] this time i don't want to waste one day
[56:19] serving god
[56:21] when you tremble in prayer you tremble
[56:23] in the presence of god
[56:28] and then look you kiss the son you
[56:29] worship jesus
[56:30] right you love jesus roman said when a
[56:32] woman kisses dirty feet
[56:35] kissed it you make all those kissing
[56:37] sounds he walked she washed uh jesus
[56:39] feet with the head of her hair
[56:41] and that's how we should we should just
[56:43] watch jesus we should love jesus worship
[56:45] him with all we have amen me i like to
[56:47] close my eyes and
[56:50] wait my arms like to stomp and clap
[56:52] shout hallelujah praise god
[56:55] show jesus your love that's what i'm
[56:56] saying amen show jesus how much you love
[56:59] him that's right kiss the son or else
[57:01] he's gonna be angry
[57:03] in other words don't kiss the world kiss
[57:05] the lord jesus christ that's right show
[57:07] jesus your greatest affections how many
[57:09] would do that by god's place
[57:12] i'm going to skip past that one i'm
[57:13] going to go right to this one let's go
[57:14] to this let's stand maokai you can come
[57:16] we'll just read this one and we'll
[57:17] finish up here so i'm already at almost
[57:19] an hour yeah i'm at 50
[57:21] 55.
[57:24] it's almost impossible to preach
[57:27] 30 minutes
[57:29] philippians 2 12 wherefore my beloved
[57:31] paul says as ye have always obeyed not
[57:33] in my presence only but now much more my
[57:36] absence
[57:37] work out your own salvation with fear
[57:40] from me what a great verse this was
[57:41] reminded to me last week i thought oh my
[57:43] forgot all about this verse
[57:47] sometimes you wonder am i even saved
[57:50] am i sure i got saved
[57:53] paul says the way to stay humble is to
[57:56] always keep an attitude of fear and
[57:58] trouble that's right
[58:01] so not a lazy attitude like oh i'm god's
[58:03] bride and
[58:05] god let me get away with anything that's
[58:07] that's not the right attitude
[58:10] right
[58:10] right attitude is lord help me always to
[58:13] work out my salvation with fear and
[58:15] trembling
[58:21] because it is god working in you both to
[58:24] will and do as good pleasure so church
[58:27] see god works the best with us when
[58:29] we're
[58:30] weak and trembling
[58:32] when we fear when we're when we're just
[58:34] honestly reverent around his word that's
[58:36] when god works the best in us
[58:39] when we can tremble i know it's hard
[58:40] when you've got a pastor preaching every
[58:41] week but when those moments come when
[58:43] you can tremble at what i'm preaching
[58:45] when that really shakes you that's
[58:47] that's a good sign
[58:48] that's where we need to be amen we have
[58:50] to be there every single service on
[58:51] seriousness there's rejoicing and
[58:53] i believe in all that shouting
[58:55] i i can shout with the best i can shout
[58:57] out to my voice goes out
[58:59] but see you know you're working you know
[59:01] you're close
[59:02] to god you know
[59:04] uh you're assured of your salvation when
[59:06] you have such sincerity that you tremble
[59:08] in god's presence
[59:11] you might cry
[59:13] you might weep
[59:14] but that's how you know you're on the
[59:16] right path you're not lazy in your walk
[59:18] with god but you tremble at the word of
[59:20] god
[59:23] the bible says do all things without
[59:25] murmurings and disputes without
[59:27] complaining and then
[59:28] divisions amongst the people
[59:31] try not to complain and try not to
[59:32] dispute with other people trying to
[59:34] argue with other people
[59:37] great verses aren't they
[59:38] these are verses not for weak men these
[59:40] are verses for mighty men amen amen
[59:42] these are verses for not weak women
[59:46] not weak children
[59:48] mighty children
