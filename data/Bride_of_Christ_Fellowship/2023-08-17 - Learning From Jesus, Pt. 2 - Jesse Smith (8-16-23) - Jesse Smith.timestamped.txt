[0:00] that you know about that I try to let
[0:01] you know about all the little things
[0:02] like that and
[0:03] in case you wonder where people are you
[0:05] know you wonder what's going on and we
[0:07] just want to keep everybody in the loop
[0:08] let me preach for about an hour here by
[0:10] the grace of Lord we'll kind of see how
[0:11] this goes
[0:13] school's back in session so I want to
[0:15] try to watch or for the for the girls
[0:16] it's almost back in session for me so I
[0:19] want to be mindful of the time so if you
[0:21] would uh I have some quotes or
[0:22] scriptures to to show
[0:25] by God's grace
[0:31] trying to think if there's anything else
[0:32] I want to share I put a podcast out
[0:34] yesterday about the lies coming out of
[0:37] Jeffersonville I put out a video today
[0:39] about the 12 different phrases or
[0:41] terminology for the baptism of the Holy
[0:43] Ghost
[0:44] Jesus says when you're converted
[0:45] strengthen your brethren it's also a
[0:47] seal it's born again it's New Birth
[0:50] uh there's 12 of them there's probably
[0:52] more than that but that just takes away
[0:54] all the confusion about the baptism of
[0:57] the Holy Ghost it's that one in
[0:58] self-same event where the soul is filled
[1:01] with God's spirit
[1:03] so I like to uh look here again tonight
[1:05] learning from Jesus and I kind of
[1:07] started the last sermon that was when we
[1:09] had our guest here from Napoleon brother
[1:11] Derek in the family
[1:12] uh they were here that that night I
[1:14] think I was wearing a green shirt too
[1:15] because I was listening to the sermon
[1:16] might actually be the same shirt
[1:19] I was in the sermon but kind of started
[1:21] off by saying you know
[1:23] some people have a misunderstanding of
[1:25] the word learn and uh it's not a bad
[1:28] word in fact it's a good Bible word uh
[1:30] it's used almost 70 times in the Bible
[1:32] as I'm looking at it again today so it's
[1:34] not a bad word at all
[1:36] but we saw there's two kinds of learning
[1:38] there's intellectual learning and then
[1:40] there's spiritual learning right so any
[1:43] there can be good intellectual learning
[1:45] as well like the girls probably learned
[1:46] something at school today did you learn
[1:48] something at school you probably learned
[1:50] how to obey your teacher right all your
[1:52] teachers new rules that's what I do the
[1:54] first two days of school I really Hammer
[1:55] the rules
[1:56] then everything goes a little more
[1:57] smoothly by God's grace
[2:00] but there's nothing wrong with learning
[2:02] uh even in the natural as we'll see with
[2:03] you know Shadrach Meshach and Bendigo
[2:05] Daniel there's nothing wrong with
[2:06] learning natural things but when any
[2:08] learning uh in the intellectual
[2:10] contradicts God's word then it's sinful
[2:13] learning
[2:15] but any spiritual learning about God of
[2:18] course is what we're after Hallelujah we
[2:21] want to grow as Christians we all know
[2:23] what it feels like to become stagnant
[2:25] and we got to make sure we don't become
[2:27] stagnant
[2:28] right because what happens when a water
[2:30] gets stagnant it's become deadly right
[2:32] and make you spiritually sick
[2:34] we all know what it's like to be
[2:36] spiritually sick right we don't feel
[2:37] like being around God's people we know
[2:39] if you like spending time with God uh
[2:41] and we're caught up in the sins and and
[2:43] maybe trials and maybe uh addictions or
[2:46] bad habits or something like that we
[2:48] don't want to be caught up in that we
[2:49] want to be a healthy Christian praise
[2:51] God Amen but we saw how uh you know
[2:54] learning might be a bad word in some
[2:56] message churches but not in true message
[2:58] churches because learning is a Bible
[3:00] word hallelujah and it's what Jesus said
[3:03] in our text Jesus said learn of me
[3:05] because I meek and lowly and just as a
[3:08] review you know I think I have just a
[3:09] slide there for just a quick review that
[3:12] you know learning is is what Jesus wants
[3:14] us to do and when Jesus teaches us most
[3:16] often it's very gentle because he said
[3:19] I'm meek and lowly
[3:20] right aren't you glad for a gentle
[3:22] teacher like Jesus praise God now there
[3:24] are some times he's got to rebuke us
[3:26] because we are rebelling against the
[3:28] word of God
[3:29] right we all know what that's like we
[3:32] know we're a disobeying God we haven't
[3:33] repented or something but then we'll get
[3:35] maybe something loud in a sermon or
[3:36] whether it's brother Branham or here or
[3:38] something in life maybe it'll be a car
[3:40] accident maybe it'll be something
[3:41] that'll Shake us up and oh we should
[3:43] have done I should have made this right
[3:45] sooner right but it's kind of like a
[3:47] strong rebuke
[3:49] but most often Jesus says I Meek lowly
[3:52] in heart and he just said come and be
[3:55] yoked unto me and learn of me Hallelujah
[3:59] and so I want to just just go right into
[4:01] these new verses here because the time
[4:03] is short and you never know how it's
[4:04] going to go I don't know how it's going
[4:06] to go uh the first time learn is used in
[4:09] the Bible and we'll just hit the
[4:10] highlights I'm not going to go through
[4:11] all 70 is with Laban and Jacob a member
[4:15] uh of course Jacob was uh running for
[4:18] his life right but God was still with
[4:20] him Hallelujah he was still
[4:22] predestinated to have the birthright
[4:24] hallelujah amen although he got it you
[4:26] know in a deceptive kind of way he's
[4:28] going to pay for it but he still was
[4:30] predestinated to have it praise God
[4:32] and so he served Laban remember 14 years
[4:35] uh for his two wives and then he got two
[4:38] concubines beside that and then his
[4:40] father-in-law told him you're not taking
[4:41] any more wives so he just had those four
[4:43] and he made the vow
[4:45] but uh Jacob said give me my wives and
[4:48] my children for whom I have served thee
[4:50] and let me go for thou knowest my
[4:51] service which I have done thee and label
[4:54] it said unto him I pray thee if I have
[4:56] found favor in thine eyes Terry or wait
[4:59] for I've learned my experience that the
[5:01] Lord has blessed me for thy sake I like
[5:04] that he learned by experience that God
[5:07] was with his son-in-law
[5:09] praise God
[5:10] Hallelujah I think there's examples I
[5:13] could give you know in my life and other
[5:14] people's lives where just someone's
[5:17] connection to a message believer
[5:19] helps them to see God's blessing on
[5:21] their lives I talked to you here before
[5:23] but I've had numerous family members of
[5:25] ours and Christians of mine that are not
[5:27] in the message that come to our our
[5:30] house and our church and they know
[5:32] something's different about our family
[5:34] in fact I'll just say it you know my mom
[5:36] cried three hours and the first time she
[5:38] come to visit us after staying with us
[5:40] for three or four days she cried for
[5:41] three hours straight all the way home
[5:43] and she said your family's perfect now
[5:45] you know my family's not perfect but it
[5:48] was the love and interactions and the
[5:50] forgiveness and maybe those three days
[5:52] our children weren't arguing at all
[5:53] that's not every day
[5:56] because we're human
[5:58] but whatever it was whenever
[6:01] I mean my mom we three hours
[6:03] now I hope that's what happened to the
[6:05] Goodwin family by God's grace something
[6:07] similar like that I know I got some more
[6:09] text from Dwayne so he really enjoyed
[6:11] being with us by God's grace and I
[6:13] shared your podcast with him your
[6:15] testimony I shared my testimony with
[6:16] them and he's really thankful to have
[6:18] come by God's grace I told him I said
[6:21] brother now we're connected forever
[6:23] lean is a part of our church we're
[6:25] connected forever brother Hallelujah
[6:28] so always be able to encourage him and
[6:31] maybe uh of course glean from him too
[6:32] I'm sure there's something God has
[6:33] showed him that we can learn as well by
[6:35] God's grace
[6:38] but I just like this a person who is not
[6:40] maybe necessarily part of the message
[6:42] right just related to someone in the
[6:43] message he learned by experience that
[6:46] God really blesses this message believer
[6:48] Hallelujah that's what I want to be I
[6:50] want to be such a a dedicated Christian
[6:52] I want to be such a faithful Christian
[6:54] that people that are around me they
[6:56] learn by experience that God blesses me
[6:58] and not just with natural things but
[7:00] spiritual things as well amen hallelujah
[7:03] as that's what we want we want people uh
[7:06] to see that God's blessing is on our
[7:08] lives Hallelujah and of course Church
[7:10] the most powerful thing they can see on
[7:12] our lives what is it going to be it's
[7:13] going to be the fruits of the spirit
[7:14] love joy peace gentleness patience
[7:17] long-suffering all those fruits of the
[7:19] spirit because that's the whole end of
[7:21] Christianity
[7:22] that's the whole point of Christianity
[7:24] so someone can feel the love of God from
[7:26] you praise God they can see real Joy on
[7:28] the Christian praise God that's the
[7:29] whole point of it Hallelujah is to see
[7:32] the fruit of the spirit genuine fruit of
[7:34] the spirit like I told you Dwayne says
[7:37] he said when I went up to you he said he
[7:38] said I go up to all these other pastors
[7:40] and he's like oh these guys aren't
[7:41] pastors he said I'll walk up to the U.S
[7:42] and there's a pastor that's what he told
[7:45] me he said I walk up to the other I
[7:47] shake these other pastors hands he's
[7:49] like nah
[7:51] he's about with you he said I feel I
[7:54] feel life you know that's what he told
[7:56] me like nah like one man I'm not a not a
[7:59] pastor
[8:00] I'm glad I'm like a yeah Pastor or
[8:02] something like that
[8:04] but now this this idea here in Moses
[8:08] Moses times
[8:09] in the pentateuch or the Torah the first
[8:11] five books of the Old Testament I didn't
[8:14] put all them in there there's probably
[8:15] like five six or seven of scriptures
[8:17] just like these that God wants us to
[8:20] learn to obey the word of God
[8:22] a church be encouraged like I said last
[8:24] time if you haven't learned obey
[8:26] something you haven't learned it yet but
[8:29] you will praise God right just haven't
[8:31] got there yet
[8:33] amen you'll get there Hallelujah and
[8:36] there's things I want to attain to
[8:38] praise God
[8:39] like I I like to get to the spot where
[8:42] I'm I'm so sensitive to the holy spirit
[8:44] that everybody can enjoy every sermon I
[8:46] preach in that that nobody walks out of
[8:49] here feel like they wasted a sermon are
[8:51] they wasted I wasted their time I hope
[8:54] you know I hope that's never happened
[8:55] but it you know I I never I want to be
[8:57] so sensitive to the holy spirit that
[8:59] everybody will leave here each time I
[9:00] don't know if it's possible but I think
[9:01] it is Maybe by God's grace
[9:03] each person can leave here inside got
[9:05] something from God tonight Hallelujah
[9:09] that's something I want to learn how to
[9:10] do I want to learn how to grow and obey
[9:13] the voice of the Holy Spirit like if God
[9:14] has ordained a pastor give uh then there
[9:18] has to be a way I could be in the
[9:19] channel where everybody gets blessed
[9:20] every time
[9:21] just like brother Brandon right he was a
[9:23] prophet so what happened every time he
[9:25] would say Lord I'm waiting for your
[9:26] angel to be here and then he could do
[9:28] the discernment the prayer line right
[9:30] and the program could do that well then
[9:31] perhaps I I want to do that as a pastor
[9:33] not discerned but I want to feed God's
[9:35] people every time
[9:37] so if God can do it the pastor gift then
[9:39] he's got to do it I'm sorry with a
[9:40] prophet gift he can do with the pastor
[9:42] the teacher evangelist and Apostle right
[9:45] Define full ministry
[9:47] he said now Moses says only take heed to
[9:51] yourself and keep thy Soul diligently
[9:53] lest thou forget the things which thine
[9:55] eyes have seen unless they depart from
[9:58] thy heart all the days of thy life but
[10:00] teach them thy sons and thy Sons see how
[10:02] important it is to remember all the good
[10:04] testimonies in your life
[10:06] you don't want to forget those you want
[10:08] to remember what God has done for you
[10:11] amen don't don't let those things depart
[10:13] out of your life
[10:14] Hallelujah now
[10:17] let me share this with you I think I can
[10:19] just share it on here I have a document
[10:21] where I keep track and I have every
[10:23] every Sunday night let's see if I can
[10:25] pull it up here
[10:30] where is it
[10:32] I have a list of church testimonies
[10:34] first
[10:36] so I don't want to forget all of our uh
[10:38] testimonies
[10:41] yeah yeah so here's 2023 each Sunday
[10:46] night and I know you can't read it but
[10:47] don't worry about that just as the point
[10:49] uh I'm sorry
[10:51] it's the point that every Sunday night I
[10:52] got a reminder write down to any
[10:54] testimonies from church
[10:55] so I just started that this year so
[10:57] here's January 1st Kristen was sick and
[10:59] exhausted Lena came and asked if she
[11:01] could pray for Christian truly breast or
[11:03] truly blessed Chris Christian sorry
[11:07] January 4th amen said he felt the wind
[11:09] of the Holy Spirit on Wednesday night
[11:10] service after I preached on part five of
[11:12] praise the name of the dance amen
[11:13] shouted and praise God as I prayed for
[11:15] Revival his first love not long after
[11:17] that he had trouble with the appendix
[11:18] surgery
[11:20] so how he needed that he needed that
[11:21] anointing before he had this trial
[11:23] and so now I I went back to 2011 2012 so
[11:29] what maybe someday I'll just preach a
[11:30] service on all these testimonies here by
[11:32] God's grace
[11:34] so I wanna I wanna take that to heart I
[11:36] want to remember the memorials Joshua
[11:38] all right you're over the Joshua Army I
[11:42] want to remember what God has done so I
[11:44] don't forget praise God
[11:46] especially for the it's actually my
[11:48] responsibility and parents for the Next
[11:50] Generation to teach the children right
[11:52] that's that's what happened to Israel
[11:54] they didn't teach the Next Generation
[11:56] all the testimonies
[11:58] all right there's going to be a time
[12:00] or Malachi and Lydia I'm gonna go and
[12:02] call some names irritation they're gonna
[12:03] have to get on their faces and pray
[12:05] before every service
[12:07] because they're going to be they might
[12:08] be running the church
[12:09] they might be the leaders in the church
[12:12] right
[12:13] it's gonna come a time when
[12:15] daddy's gonna get old
[12:18] daddy man go crazy
[12:20] let's hope not
[12:24] the point is there's going to come a
[12:26] time when every generation has to seek
[12:28] God that's right
[12:29] Hallelujah
[12:31] and this is my this is my time to see
[12:33] God
[12:35] I've got to preach until the Holy Spirit
[12:37] comes I got to preach so people are
[12:38] blessed I gotta pray until God blesses
[12:40] the people praise God
[12:42] each and every person has to do that
[12:46] he says especially the day that thou
[12:48] sent us before the Lord thy God in auram
[12:50] when the Lord said unto me gather me the
[12:52] people together and I will make them
[12:53] hear my words that they may what learn
[12:56] to fear me all the days that they shall
[12:59] live upon the earth I remember when
[13:01] sister know we said that fear of the
[13:02] Lord's servant was really important for
[13:03] her it was for me too I'm sure it was
[13:05] for all of us
[13:07] remember we can just we can we can just
[13:09] kind of summarize or or just boil it
[13:12] down to are we fearing God or not praise
[13:14] God that's really good what we can boil
[13:15] it down to
[13:16] are we walking in respect unto God are
[13:20] we remembering God's Commandments or not
[13:22] you came tonight so I believe you are by
[13:24] God's grace
[13:25] amen if you don't want to hear the word
[13:27] of God you would not have come
[13:28] Hallelujah
[13:30] see God said
[13:32] remember the testimonies gather the
[13:34] people make them hear the words let them
[13:36] come to church right he says make that's
[13:38] why I said make I'm not going to make
[13:39] you go to church I'm going to encourage
[13:40] you to come to church I can't make you
[13:42] come to church I've never made anybody
[13:44] come to church
[13:45] but I want to make it sound like
[13:46] legalism my brother said you ought to be
[13:48] a legalist about coming to church at
[13:50] least at the beginning he said to get
[13:52] the good habit of coming to church and
[13:53] he laughs he laughs but it wasn't
[13:55] legalist he laughed it was a joke he
[13:58] said they may learn to fear me all the
[14:00] days that they shall live upon the Earth
[14:01] and that they may teach their children
[14:03] praise God
[14:06] and Moses called on Israel said I'm hero
[14:08] Israel the statutes and judgments which
[14:10] I speak in your ears this day that ye
[14:12] may learn them and keep them and do them
[14:15] so see there are scriptures we want to
[14:18] be able to fulfill we want to be able to
[14:20] do it but we've got to learn how to do
[14:22] it praise God like I've got I think two
[14:25] or three texts or emails over the last
[14:27] few weeks people want to learn how to
[14:28] fast
[14:29] I don't know if it's in this church or
[14:31] not I know one for sure is not in this
[14:32] church
[14:33] and I said you just start oh yeah I saw
[14:36] Chris at Walmart twice on Monday and I
[14:38] invited him back to church
[14:39] I saw him so that's what we're praying
[14:41] for we're praying for him I told him
[14:42] virtues praying for him
[14:45] doing okay he's trying to go to the Air
[14:46] Force but let's we'll keep him in prayer
[14:48] I said brother we're praying yeah we
[14:50] prayed that you wouldn't go to Arizona
[14:51] and he laughed
[14:56] well you know there's things we want to
[14:58] be able to do we want to obey him but we
[15:00] are not there yet
[15:01] right but we got to learn how to do them
[15:04] we got to learn how to obey in order to
[15:08] keep God's Commandments but God is
[15:09] patient
[15:10] right
[15:12] think about it I don't get upset with
[15:14] first graders if they can't do
[15:16] multiplication because it's not time for
[15:18] them to do multiplication
[15:19] and even when they're a year behind I
[15:21] don't get impatient with them I just
[15:23] still show them love
[15:25] because everybody develops at a
[15:26] different rate
[15:28] so I told the brothers I said just skip
[15:29] one meal just start with the morning
[15:31] like it's easiest to fast when you're on
[15:33] a roll already like going into the next
[15:35] day right you fast all night so just
[15:37] keep it going in the morning I said try
[15:39] to fast skip breakfast then and try to
[15:41] go to lunch and then if you can get to
[15:43] lunch sometime try to go to supper
[15:46] right try to do that and then try to
[15:48] develop it a couple times a week not
[15:51] only the Bible says gonna make you
[15:52] healthy it's going to make you more
[15:53] spiritual too
[15:55] praise God
[15:58] so I'm just trying to help people learn
[16:00] I mean I love that they want to learn
[16:02] how to fast like that's music to my ears
[16:05] you want to fast you want to give up uh
[16:07] your food you want to give up meals for
[16:08] God oh that were not far from the
[16:11] kingdom hallelujah amen amen
[16:14] remember we've had people who leave this
[16:16] church and believe the message their
[16:17] whole life and never fasted one day in
[16:19] their lives
[16:22] then they want and they battled that
[16:23] they battled that but I said I said
[16:24] don't take that as a rebuke take it as
[16:26] encouragement that now in the year 41
[16:28] now God wants to teach you how to fast
[16:30] right
[16:34] right so these are some beautiful verses
[16:36] Psalms 106 34. my wife said that's my
[16:38] word I use all the time that's beautiful
[16:39] so
[16:40] if I overuse that please pardon me but
[16:42] you know what I'm talking about they did
[16:43] not destroy the Nations concerning the
[16:45] Lord whom the Lord commanded them Israel
[16:47] but were mingled among the Heathen and
[16:49] learned their work so we got to be very
[16:51] careful who we mingle with
[16:53] and they serve their Idols which were a
[16:55] snare unto them
[16:57] so we see idolatry you know uh
[17:01] we can learn bad habits when we hang
[17:03] around the wrong people right
[17:05] right
[17:06] when we mingle with the wrong influences
[17:10] and that's what happened to Israel
[17:12] think think about that church think it's
[17:15] just hard for us to understand sometimes
[17:16] they saw the pillar of fire every night
[17:19] they saw the cloud by day every day they
[17:22] saw the waters parted the Red Sea they
[17:25] walked on dry land
[17:27] and yet they still forgot about God and
[17:30] they still made the golden calf and they
[17:32] still complained ten times
[17:34] right
[17:36] sometimes it's hard for us to understand
[17:39] it just shows how short uh such a sharp
[17:43] memory we have because we're human right
[17:46] now I like one thing though Joshua and
[17:49] Caleb were not that kind Hallelujah
[17:51] glory amen why because the Bible said
[17:54] they had a different spear Hallelujah
[17:57] they have the whole death of Greater
[17:58] Holy Ghost anointing in their minds
[18:00] Hallelujah in other words Joshua and
[18:02] Caleb renewed their minds every single
[18:04] day praise God
[18:07] amen see they mingle with unbelievers
[18:10] and they learn how to sin rather than
[18:12] learning how to obey God
[18:15] so that's the bad example of learning we
[18:18] want to avoid that I like this I will
[18:20] praise thee with uprightness of heart
[18:22] now brightness means I've obeyed the
[18:24] word of God
[18:28] see praise follows learning I learned
[18:32] something new during the sermon now I
[18:33] can praise God at the end Hallelujah
[18:37] it is good for me that I've been
[18:39] Afflicted that I might learn nice
[18:41] statutes that does that remind you of
[18:42] Jesus and Hebrews Jesus learned
[18:45] obedience through the things that he
[18:46] suffered like and then sometimes we get
[18:50] discouraged why am I suffering why am I
[18:52] going through this and sometimes I think
[18:54] God wants to say it's to teach you a
[18:56] lesson
[18:57] is to teach you how to be a better
[18:59] Christian
[19:01] now we all know Financial battles right
[19:03] what does that teach us to be trusting
[19:05] God right we all go through seasons of
[19:08] Lost seasons of more what is it to do to
[19:11] teach us to trust in God and not the
[19:14] Bible said not in uncertain riches right
[19:17] right
[19:19] Hallelujah but see church sometimes we
[19:22] suffer to learn to obey God's statutes
[19:25] to learn to obey God's commands
[19:29] a wise man will hear Proverbs 1 5 says
[19:32] and will increase learning and a man of
[19:35] understanding shall attain unto wise
[19:37] counsels
[19:38] Hallelujah
[19:40] so see church we got to open our ear to
[19:42] hearing the right thing the right kind
[19:45] of learning right like I had a friend in
[19:48] the Lord contact me and uh today he was
[19:50] sending me voice messages and he kind of
[19:52] calls me his mentor
[19:54] and he said yeah I've been reading these
[19:56] other books he said but I need to get
[19:57] back to the Bible
[19:59] he said I just I read these books so I
[20:00] could have a better career and he said I
[20:03] need to get back to the Bible I thought
[20:04] that's a good that's a good desire
[20:06] that's great a lot of people don't catch
[20:08] that right A lot of people like we had
[20:10] it here one time at the church years ago
[20:11] the person no longer goes here but my
[20:13] wife and I remember the very day this
[20:15] person came to us and and this person
[20:16] said I'm going to stop studying the
[20:18] scripture so much and I'm gonna start
[20:19] studying business
[20:21] and that was the way out
[20:22] that was the way out of coming to every
[20:24] service that was a way out of lots of
[20:26] other things I don't want to give too
[20:27] many details but my wife and I
[20:29] specifically remember that day
[20:31] now it's okay to study business it's
[20:33] okay to study Finance it's okay okay to
[20:35] study whatever you want to study
[20:36] but make sure we increase our learning
[20:39] in the word of God hallelujah and if two
[20:42] or three services is not enough then
[20:43] guess what you got to do it during the
[20:45] week too praise God
[20:46] Hallelujah
[20:50] that's what I do every day I try to
[20:51] listen to a sermon every day now uh
[20:53] today I was listening to brother Brandon
[20:54] uh some days like this and Tim Pruitt
[20:56] Donnie Reagan uh cams when they're
[20:58] available just like me I don't put all
[21:01] my sermons on there
[21:02] but I like that I've always got to stay
[21:04] in the preaching I got to stay in the
[21:05] channel of hearing the word of God I
[21:07] want to increase my learning Hallelujah
[21:09] give instruction to a wise man and he
[21:12] will yet be wiser
[21:14] but see wise people want to know more
[21:16] things like these people want to know
[21:17] how to fast
[21:19] what their shows they're getting wisdom
[21:20] praise God they want to know how to be
[21:24] wiser
[21:25] teach a just man and he will increase
[21:27] the learning
[21:29] like remember that Mike guy I talked
[21:30] about last Wednesday night I met with
[21:32] him he said he's not reading my book he
[21:33] said this is full of great things I said
[21:36] well I know a great person that wrote it
[21:37] it was Jesus it wasn't me but he said
[21:39] this is full of great things see he
[21:41] wants to learn amen he wants to increase
[21:43] his learning praise God
[21:46] Hallelujah so see when I when I try to
[21:49] teach or try to instruct on things we
[21:51] can do it will make us wiser by God's
[21:53] grace
[21:54] Hallelujah
[21:57] the wise and heart Shall be Called
[21:59] prudent
[22:00] that means understanding and the
[22:02] sweetness of the lips increases learning
[22:06] understanding is a Wellspring of Life
[22:08] unto him that hath it but the
[22:10] instruction of fools is folly so look at
[22:14] this Wellspring sweetness I mean what a
[22:16] sweet life probably would if you like
[22:18] what fresh water is Flowing your life
[22:20] will become wiser right gain more learn
[22:23] more about the Lord praise God
[22:26] the heart of the wise teaches his mouth
[22:28] and addeth learning to his lips
[22:31] all right so that's what we want to do
[22:33] we want to be able to learn and then
[22:35] take what we've learned right and then
[22:37] share that with other people
[22:39] right that's what brother ram calls he
[22:41] calls that exercising your spiritual
[22:43] muscles
[22:44] but Iran says many times people come to
[22:45] church and he says that spiritually they
[22:48] get overweight on hearing the word but
[22:50] not acting on the word
[22:52] he said but when you hear it and go talk
[22:54] to somebody else he said that's
[22:55] spiritually exercising your muscles
[22:57] amen he says so we're not spiritually
[23:00] obese he says right
[23:03] Hallelujah I like that amen
[23:06] that's happened numerous times sometimes
[23:08] people send me a text and I'm like I
[23:10] don't know what to say and I'll think
[23:11] Lord what did I preach last week and
[23:14] then I'll send whatever inspired thought
[23:16] I had I said to a man uh what's his name
[23:18] I can't remember his name
[23:20] Perry I said unto the man Perry my wife
[23:22] through my wife I met this guy with the
[23:24] herbs
[23:25] and I just sent him this thought and
[23:27] he's like wow I need I just needed that
[23:28] right now
[23:30] and then I think I told you that
[23:31] testimony with brother Irvin down there
[23:32] in Junction City my wife sent me a verse
[23:35] and I said I thought Irvin right away I
[23:38] sent to him and brother Irvin said I
[23:39] needed that verse at that moment because
[23:41] I was going through depression and
[23:43] battling discouragement think about that
[23:45] my wife just texted me I'm like I could
[23:47] have said hey I think I just held down
[23:48] and liked it with a heart or something
[23:50] you know how you hold on heard it but I
[23:52] thought well I should do something with
[23:53] this
[23:54] no this reminds me brother Irvin I'll
[23:56] send it to him and that little text
[23:58] helped him come out a little depression
[24:00] praise God
[24:02] a little text
[24:03] just a little just a little care about
[24:06] other people
[24:09] don't you like that when you get an
[24:10] encouraging text
[24:11] amen hallelujah means a lot
[24:15] wise learn fools do not
[24:17] I love what Isaiah 1 says of course I
[24:19] love all these scriptures probably over
[24:21] say that too much wash you make you
[24:23] clean put away the evil of your duties
[24:25] from before my eyes cease to do evil
[24:28] learn to do well seek judgment relieve
[24:31] the oppressed judge the fatherless plead
[24:34] for the Widow
[24:35] come now and let us reason together
[24:37] saith the Lord though your sins be as
[24:39] Scarlet they should be white as snow
[24:41] though they be red like Crimson they
[24:43] shall be as whoa hallelujah amen
[24:45] hallelujah praise God that's what that's
[24:47] what the blood of Jesus Christ does you
[24:49] might be dirty you might be red with sin
[24:51] but Jesus blood will give you a white
[24:53] garments Hallelujah like Lena's dress on
[24:55] the Saturday praise God Amen makes her
[24:57] closing where's Victoria's got white
[24:59] clothes on tonight too I said don't you
[25:01] get any food on that that's real pretty
[25:02] white right there
[25:03] that's what the Bible says
[25:05] obeying God learn to do well gives you
[25:08] white garments Hallelujah
[25:10] amen
[25:14] see we got to learn to do well
[25:16] we got to put away evil put away
[25:18] Temptation seek judgment seek Lord what
[25:21] would you judge in this situation
[25:24] uh
[25:25] like Austin sent me a text right on
[25:27] Monday what would you do in this
[25:28] situation I want he wanted my judgment I
[25:30] thought that's a good man right there
[25:31] that's a good man
[25:32] right
[25:35] that's what I want I want sometimes I
[25:36] seek out judgment from other people what
[25:38] would you do what do you think sisters
[25:40] what time you want to have a service
[25:41] room if we have a late we have a late
[25:43] service on a Thursday or Friday night I
[25:46] need to I need people's judgment praise
[25:48] God
[25:51] with My Soul have I desired the end of
[25:53] the night yay with my spirit Within Me
[25:56] will I seek thee early for when thy
[25:57] judgments are in the earth now think
[25:58] about this when God's judgments are in
[26:00] the earth then happens to the world will
[26:02] learn righteousness now look what
[26:03] happened today they took God out of the
[26:06] schools they took God out of the
[26:06] government they took God out of
[26:08] everything and look what we got a bunch
[26:10] of heathens yeah right a bunch of
[26:13] absolute insane people but the
[26:16] opposite's true when God's word is in
[26:18] the earth they learn to be righteous
[26:20] praise God
[26:21] Hallelujah
[26:23] Church honestly I don't know where what
[26:24] to think about the world right now like
[26:26] I listen to a few different uh news
[26:27] sources One Source is showing how most
[26:30] Nations outside of the West are actually
[26:33] turning from the woke movement
[26:35] like especially African nations
[26:37] they will not take the they will not
[26:39] take the woke agenda a lot of them
[26:41] Outlaw homosexuality as well which
[26:44] praise God for them
[26:47] and they're more aligning with the more
[26:48] Traditional Values like Russia and China
[26:51] because they're they're against Western
[26:53] Nations and some of the European nations
[26:56] that are going woke
[27:00] so it's just interesting uh you know
[27:02] because we're always watching watching
[27:03] them praying how soon is the rapture
[27:07] I ask myself that every day
[27:09] but it's just interesting
[27:11] so what I'm saying is some Nations
[27:13] actually the majority of Nations it
[27:15] seems like are actually moving away from
[27:17] the woke agenda
[27:18] which would mean there are at least
[27:20] they're honoring some of God's judgments
[27:22] in the Earth
[27:23] which is interesting
[27:29] oh and uh you know just a follow-up I
[27:31] did I did uh read uh watch a few videos
[27:33] on remember that Catholic event I was
[27:35] telling you about the change it was
[27:37] called where they're having all those
[27:38] guest speakers up there remember that a
[27:40] few weeks ago
[27:41] um the pope went there and the pope said
[27:44] um he said our church has no doors
[27:46] because it's open for everybody
[27:49] and he said it's just like a mother like
[27:51] a mother at her house she wants
[27:52] everybody to come in everyone everyone
[27:54] everyone and he's speaking of Mother
[27:56] Mary
[27:58] so
[28:00] um and there was there was many hundred
[28:02] I think there was a hundred thousand or
[28:03] so youth all came into that event and so
[28:06] it was just more propaganda from the
[28:07] Roman Catholic church and more mothers
[28:09] trying to include everybody everybody's
[28:11] included the Pope says through Mary
[28:13] where's Jesus in all this right where's
[28:16] Jesus
[28:18] so again look at this it's perfect
[28:19] mystery Babylon right the woman it all
[28:22] exalts the woman Mary
[28:23] exalt in the Roman Catholic church right
[28:25] exalting uh and I thought no door Jesus
[28:28] is the door that's right
[28:29] you got no doors of course that's why
[28:31] the goats get
[28:33] it but every True Church of God has a
[28:35] door Christ is the door Hallelujah
[28:37] the Bible said if you climb in another
[28:39] way you're not fit for the kingdom
[28:40] Hallelujah
[28:41] amen
[28:44] let favor be shown to the wicked yet he
[28:46] will not learn righteousness in the land
[28:48] of uprightness will he deal unjustly and
[28:50] will not behold the Majesty of the Lord
[28:53] we're in a title of famine for the
[28:55] hearing of the word remember Amos 8
[28:57] 11-12
[28:58] it's a spiritual famine for the hearing
[29:01] of the word of God that's why uh we need
[29:03] more of God's judgments in the earth I
[29:05] don't know how it's going to go like I
[29:06] said with the Rapture I'm not quite sure
[29:08] how that's going to go
[29:10] Isaiah 50 verse 4 the Lord God hath
[29:12] given me the tongue of the learn I like
[29:14] this one that I should know how to speak
[29:16] a word in season to him that's weary he
[29:18] awakeneth morning by morning he waketh
[29:21] awakeneth mind ear to hear as the
[29:25] Learned who wants to be a blessing and
[29:27] uplift others praise God I think that's
[29:29] beautiful
[29:30] God gave Isaiah a tongue of the Learned
[29:33] of course he learned from God that he
[29:35] should know how to give someone a word
[29:37] in due season
[29:39] Hallelujah
[29:41] you ever seen somebody who's down in the
[29:42] dumps and just like you wish you could
[29:43] just say something to help them out how
[29:45] many ever seen that before right amen
[29:47] that's what Isaiah is saying God made me
[29:49] to do that now I just remember chapter
[29:51] one right or chat was it no I'm sorry it
[29:53] was chapter
[29:54] earlier in the book I forget Which
[29:56] chapter it is but God sent a coal down
[29:58] from heaven
[29:59] to clean off Isaiah's mouth right yes
[30:02] right so this is what we need we need
[30:04] the fire of the Holy Ghost to cleanse
[30:07] our lips
[30:08] that's right
[30:09] God take out any foolishness out of my
[30:11] mouth I'm talking about me amen right
[30:13] and I'm sure you'd say Amen take the
[30:15] nonsense out of my mouth the foolishness
[30:16] help me to just speak your word praise
[30:18] God I could be a word and do season to
[30:21] somebody praise God
[30:23] the awakeneth Morning by morning he he
[30:25] waketh my ear now look at that in order
[30:27] for him to speak he's got to waken early
[30:29] to hear the word of God then he can
[30:30] speak it to somebody
[30:32] amen
[30:35] he's got to learn to do that now here's
[30:36] a scripture about Daniel and his three
[30:38] friends the Bible said there was no
[30:39] blemish in them I'm going to skip a
[30:41] little bit skillful and all wisdom
[30:44] and uh they were able to be taught by
[30:47] the Chaldeans to teach and learn of
[30:50] their language
[30:51] and the Bible said God gave them skill
[30:53] in learning and wisdom
[30:56] now think about that God made them smart
[31:00] God did
[31:01] right now I don't think God makes
[31:03] anybody dumb
[31:05] right right now we know there's levels
[31:07] of intelligence but everyone is
[31:09] intelligent yeah
[31:10] yeah right it's the enemy that wants
[31:12] people to waste their memory away right
[31:15] right or waste uh waste their intellect
[31:18] God wants us to learn the word of God
[31:20] hallelujah
[31:21] and then because they could learn all
[31:24] this then God used them for great
[31:26] testimonies
[31:27] how many preachers have preached on the
[31:29] fourth man in the fire because Shadrach
[31:31] Meshach and Abednego learn the science
[31:34] right right
[31:35] how many preachers amen hallelujah how
[31:39] many preachers that preached on Daniel
[31:41] even if you're thrown into lines then
[31:43] God will stop the lion's mouth praise
[31:45] God God's with you the Lions then God's
[31:48] with you in the Fire come on
[31:50] God God sent an angel you just got to
[31:52] wait 21 days and he'll break through
[31:53] praise God just wait on the angel
[31:57] now these were only possible because
[32:00] they learned the natural things that
[32:03] they were teaching
[32:04] that's why you tell those children like
[32:06] Brahman said about education learn as
[32:08] much as you can just never let education
[32:11] uh go above God's word
[32:13] don't believe the evolution nonsense
[32:15] right right you might have to put it on
[32:17] the test to get it right but even if you
[32:19] just miss one you still get a 96 you
[32:20] know
[32:23] I'm not telling anybody to get a bad
[32:25] grade
[32:26] but the point is
[32:28] God wants to use all of it praise God
[32:31] like I've had people over the years tell
[32:32] me your brother Jesse I really like your
[32:34] videos well I learned to do that when I
[32:35] was in college for teaching
[32:38] right a lot a lot of people don't do
[32:40] their videos now I know they're not as
[32:41] nice as Austin could do really nice ones
[32:43] so she's like he does really good ones
[32:47] but the point was like I couldn't you
[32:49] know if I went and went to school maybe
[32:50] I would not have been able to do that
[32:52] and I could not have helped the people
[32:53] the way I couldn't help them now by
[32:54] God's grace
[32:55] like there's just certain things I'm
[32:57] glad I learned I'm glad I learned these
[32:59] natural things they're not going to be a
[33:00] blessing to somebody else praise God
[33:04] when the Pharisees saw it I'm getting
[33:06] the New Testament now
[33:08] when the Pharisees saw it they said on
[33:09] his disciples why he is your master with
[33:11] Republicans and sinners when Jesus heard
[33:13] that he said to them they that be whole
[33:15] need not a physician but they that are
[33:18] sick now look Jesus was always battling
[33:20] these critical spirits
[33:22] oh hey it's like he couldn't do anything
[33:25] right and yet he was doing everything
[33:26] right right
[33:28] right but these Pharisees and says she's
[33:30] just constantly criticism the publicans
[33:32] and the herodians lawyers scribes
[33:34] everybody was criticizing him all the
[33:36] time but brother Adam said he lived
[33:38] above the criticism Hallelujah
[33:40] amen he didn't let anything deter praise
[33:42] God he just kept looking to the father
[33:44] whatever the father said that's what he
[33:46] said whatever the father said to you
[33:47] that's what he knew that's what we
[33:49] should do always do what the father says
[33:51] hallelujah
[33:53] I like what Jesus says
[33:55] he corrects him he said the reason
[33:58] they're they're getting well is because
[34:00] they're sick
[34:01] right and he's basically telling them
[34:03] you don't can't even realize your
[34:05] sickness
[34:06] right at least they can recognize they
[34:08] need salvation he said you can't even
[34:10] recognize your saved he said you need to
[34:13] go and learn what this scripture means I
[34:15] will have mercy and not sacrifice
[34:19] in other words the Pharisees would
[34:21] sacrifice remember they would divide the
[34:23] tithe of every mitt and spice and they'd
[34:25] make sure down to the very ounce they
[34:27] tie the right amount but yet they they
[34:29] were too holy in their eyes to go
[34:31] minister to Zacchaeus or minister to
[34:33] marry Magdalene or some of these other
[34:35] people they consider dirty and Jesus
[34:37] said you need to go learn something
[34:39] praise God you need to learn to go have
[34:41] mercy on people events instead of being
[34:43] self-righteous and legalistic you need
[34:46] to learn what the scripture says you you
[34:48] have a you have a understanding but you
[34:50] don't have the real spiritual revelation
[34:52] of God's word yeah
[34:54] yeah I've not come to call the righteous
[34:56] he says the self-righteous but Sinners
[34:59] to repentance Hallelujah
[35:01] I like that Jesus brings out the real
[35:03] rebuke these were the Learned people he
[35:06] says you need to go learn something
[35:07] right
[35:10] is that how we overcome the devil just
[35:12] through the opposite of what the devil
[35:13] says
[35:15] right the devil says I'm so learned and
[35:17] Jesus says you need to go learn that's
[35:19] right right
[35:22] Satan condemns you just turn it right
[35:24] back on him
[35:25] right like you're a hypocrite no Satan
[35:27] you're the biggest hypocrite right right
[35:31] you're a failure God doesn't love you no
[35:33] God loves me the Bible says so
[35:36] Hallelujah you're the one that's
[35:37] rejected God's love
[35:39] you turn it right back on and praise God
[35:43] amen no
[35:44] we're watching Israel brother says watch
[35:47] Israel right right we watch and pray
[35:51] and some people can't understand this
[35:52] Jesus says now learn a parable of the
[35:54] Fig Tree the Fig Tree is always Israel I
[35:57] don't have time to go back and get that
[35:58] I don't have those scriptures actually
[35:59] ready but I could teach that
[36:01] when his branch is yet tend to remember
[36:03] said Israel is my son
[36:05] and he put it forth leaves you know that
[36:08] summer is nine so likewise he when you
[36:11] shall see all these things know that
[36:12] it's near even at the doors verily I
[36:15] send you this generation shall not pass
[36:16] so all these things were filled now on
[36:18] another world event I've been listening
[36:20] to Israel and Israel's government is
[36:23] basically going right leaning in other
[36:25] words they're getting more and more
[36:27] conservative but the judges are all
[36:29] liberal the Supreme Court is all liberal
[36:31] right so there's a great move in Israel
[36:33] getting back to the word of God Amen
[36:36] it's just the Supreme Court Justices
[36:39] that are undoing all the good
[36:41] all right but I'm just letting you know
[36:43] the trend is going towards those 144
[36:46] 000. Hallelujah so see we got to learn
[36:49] that as we see Israel get more and more
[36:52] obedient to the word of God of course we
[36:54] know the Rapture is closer Hallelujah
[36:55] right
[36:58] and there's going to come a time when
[37:00] this generation shall not pass until we
[37:03] see everything prophesied for Israel it
[37:05] will come to pass like I've said this
[37:07] numerous times church if we start seeing
[37:09] them build the temple we know the
[37:11] Rapture is really close
[37:13] I'll be calling prayer meetings every
[37:15] night
[37:15] or service every night or whatever you
[37:17] know if we start seeing that
[37:19] right just like if we see the United
[37:22] States start changing these laws against
[37:24] Christians right it's almost go time
[37:26] right
[37:28] right it's almost time
[37:29] to go remember the Bible said you gotta
[37:31] in the time of that of rain you got to
[37:32] cry out for the latter rain remember
[37:33] that scripture
[37:35] that's right
[37:36] remember all the trials are to do what
[37:38] trials draw us closer to God
[37:41] when it was time for the disciples to
[37:43] get the Holy Ghost God had to use
[37:44] pressure to get them the Holy Ghost the
[37:46] the day of Pentecost right all the
[37:49] pressure of a rest and all these things
[37:50] God's gonna drive us to whatever we need
[37:52] for rapturing Faith praise God Amen
[37:58] amen now I use this verse last time said
[38:01] this verse but rather said is that
[38:03] evidence of the Holy Ghost In other
[38:05] words every child of God who's born
[38:06] again can learn from God
[38:09] they want to learn from God because
[38:10] God's their father praise God
[38:13] Hallelujah
[38:14] I don't expect Malachi and Lydia to
[38:16] learn from other dads I expect them to
[38:18] learn from me praise God
[38:20] watch my life Hallelujah watch what I do
[38:23] because they're my children
[38:27] he said it is written the prophets and
[38:29] they shall all be taught of God every
[38:31] man therefore that hath heard and has
[38:33] learned of the father cometh unto me
[38:38] Hallelujah
[38:39] see every true child of God will come to
[38:41] this word and want a real understanding
[38:43] of it
[38:44] right a real understanding
[38:48] I like this one too Acts 26 and as he
[38:52] thus spayed for himself Festus the ruler
[38:54] Senate with the loud voice Paul Thou Art
[38:56] man I'm sorry Thou Art beside themselves
[38:58] thyself much learning doth make me mad
[39:01] now he was preaching to him about Jesus
[39:03] dying resurrecting
[39:05] he says you're mad you're crazy but he
[39:07] said I am not man most normal Festus but
[39:10] speak forth the words of truth and
[39:12] soberness Hallelujah see Paul wasn't
[39:15] crazy
[39:16] he had much Revelation that's why he was
[39:19] talking the way he was talking yeah amen
[39:23] remember Paul said Jesus revealed
[39:25] himself to me that he might reveal his
[39:28] son in me praise God in other words God
[39:30] wanted to reveal Christ in Paul through
[39:32] his sufferings praise God yeah
[39:35] through this testimony through the
[39:36] supernatural
[39:38] so see if that's just accused him of the
[39:41] wrong kind of learning but Paul said I
[39:43] haven't got the wrong learning I've got
[39:44] the right learning praise God
[39:47] I speak the words of truth and soberness
[39:49] hallelujah
[39:50] amen so that's that proves speaking the
[39:54] truth sometimes will make you look crazy
[39:56] Hallelujah anybody ever been called
[39:59] Crazy by a friend or family member yes
[40:01] right what is it it's the learning of
[40:03] the Holy Ghost that does that praise God
[40:06] we're not crazy we're just speaking the
[40:08] truth in love Hallelujah
[40:09] amen
[40:11] Romans 15 3 for even Christ please God
[40:13] himself but I mention I'll go back to
[40:15] the Roman series eventually but as it is
[40:17] written the reproaches of them that
[40:18] reproach thee fell on me
[40:21] for whatsoever things were written
[40:22] before time were written for our
[40:24] learning that we through patience and
[40:27] comfort of the scriptures might have
[40:30] hope Hallelujah Church men died to write
[40:33] these Bible books so we can learn how to
[40:36] serve God Amen Hallelujah they shed
[40:38] their blood Martyrs like we saw on on
[40:40] Sunday they got the martyrs Crown they
[40:43] shed their blood so you can learn to be
[40:45] patient you could get comfort from the
[40:47] scriptures and you can have hope
[40:49] Hallelujah
[40:50] men and men died for this word of God
[40:53] so you can learn how to be more patient
[40:57] are you learning tonight amen
[41:00] you can comfort from the word of God we
[41:02] get Hope from the word of God
[41:07] see anybody that says oh brother yes
[41:08] he's preaching on learning here anybody
[41:10] that would say oh we don't need to learn
[41:11] about God well what does the Bible say
[41:14] the Bible said you've got to learn
[41:15] remember learning is just it's another
[41:17] form of understanding and how do we get
[41:19] understanding through Revelation Okay so
[41:22] learning is a byproduct of getting a
[41:24] revelation Hallelujah
[41:26] appreciate that last time but I'm not
[41:28] going to go back to that Romans 16 17
[41:30] now beseech you I beg you Brethren mark
[41:32] them which caused divisions and offenses
[41:34] contrary to the doctrine which you've
[41:36] heard that's why I call people's names
[41:37] sometimes I'm marking them because the
[41:39] Bible said to mark them
[41:43] and avoid them right so in our case we
[41:45] won't listen to them online right or
[41:48] won't go where to where they're
[41:49] preaching at
[41:50] I mark them and say avoid them stay away
[41:54] from their influence
[41:56] for they that are such serve not our
[41:59] Lord Jesus Christ anyone dividing the
[42:02] body of Christ and I will say this one
[42:03] example is with people doing Church
[42:05] splits
[42:06] not all the time sometimes the church
[42:08] split is a good thing if the Cur if the
[42:10] church is off the word of God then it's
[42:12] a good thing to have a church split but
[42:15] if some preacher just wants some money
[42:17] and he splits the church just to get
[42:18] some Tide money that's sin
[42:21] right right so I always want to have
[42:23] that balance sometimes the church but is
[42:25] a good thing if the old church or the
[42:27] former church is deep in sin
[42:30] right that's why I you know I haven't
[42:32] made the video yet but some of these
[42:34] people that are leaving the message I'm
[42:35] glad they've left some of the message
[42:37] churches because they're not real
[42:38] message churches
[42:40] their sin failed message churches
[42:43] so I'm glad they left that I just wish
[42:45] they went to a real Message Church like
[42:47] ours
[42:48] Hallelujah
[42:49] where we preach the Bible Hallelujah
[42:52] where we believe the word of God where
[42:54] we stand on thus saith the Lord and
[42:56] we're not Fanatics
[42:57] program said never make yourself odd to
[43:00] be a Christian
[43:01] that's why at the wedding I didn't bring
[43:03] out the third pole at the wedding
[43:05] I'm not trying to be odd to be a
[43:07] Christian
[43:08] a real Christian a Holy Ghost Field
[43:11] Saint
[43:13] right right that's why I didn't bring
[43:14] out the Seven Seals at the sermon yeah
[43:17] right
[43:19] right
[43:21] I could have I could have reached on the
[43:24] seven seams
[43:25] now people do people because people say
[43:27] the Seven Seals are coming lord well
[43:29] that's the marriage seal some people say
[43:31] that I could have brought that in you
[43:33] know that you know when we go in the
[43:34] Rapture that's the seven seal it was our
[43:36] Rapture seal and Austin are experiencing
[43:39] a seven seal sermon or Seven Seals
[43:42] spiritually today
[43:43] I could have went that but I don't want
[43:45] to be odd to be a Christian if they
[43:46] don't even understand the blood of Jesus
[43:48] Christ how they how are people going to
[43:49] catch the revelation of the Seven Seals
[43:51] right that's why I tried to hammer or
[43:53] just labor on the blood what does the
[43:55] blood do what does the blood do right
[43:56] how are Australia going to manifest
[44:00] Jesus Christ to the world the Bible says
[44:02] their marriage will reveal Jesus Christ
[44:04] it's a mystery it's through their Love
[44:06] Of Christ one for another
[44:08] and their love for the church that's how
[44:11] the mystery of Jesus Christ and the
[44:13] church will be seen through us and Lena
[44:15] their love that they have right right
[44:17] like my crying mama three hours back
[44:19] home
[44:20] she saw the mystery of revelation of a
[44:22] marriage or marriage right there right
[44:24] there that's right Hallelujah
[44:28] foreign
[44:30] people that split churches or cause
[44:32] divisions amongst even churches
[44:35] they are serving themselves they're not
[44:37] serving God there's usually it's always
[44:39] money behind it
[44:41] money or power or
[44:44] money power influence or
[44:46] evil relationships
[44:49] but they're serving themselves their own
[44:51] belly is their God
[44:53] not the Lord Jesus Christ because they
[44:56] divide people with the word of God
[44:57] rather than uniting people
[45:01] and by Goods words and fair speeches
[45:03] deceive the hearts of the simple to see
[45:05] sound Doctrine keeps us away from
[45:07] deceivers and that's why I get zealous
[45:09] you know this movement is making every
[45:12] word brother Ram said thus saith the
[45:13] Lord they're taken away from my Jesus
[45:16] they're making him equal to Jesus he's
[45:18] not equal to Jesus he's a servant of
[45:20] Jesus Hallelujah and that makes me
[45:23] jealous
[45:24] they're still they're taking taking an
[45:26] attitude that only belongs to Christ and
[45:28] they're giving it to brother random
[45:29] brother said don't do that to me praise
[45:31] God
[45:32] he said he said I'm a sinner saved by
[45:34] grace not meant to live he said I didn't
[45:36] say that to be home or praise God he
[45:38] said give all this grace to Jesus Christ
[45:40] Hallelujah
[45:41] amen so I just get a little zealous
[45:44] praise God I ought to that's my Lord
[45:45] that's my savior praise God
[45:51] and all these things brother and I have
[45:53] in a figure transferred to myself into
[45:55] Apollos for your sakes
[45:57] now ye might learn in us not to think of
[46:00] men above that which is written and that
[46:04] no one of you be puffed up for one
[46:07] against another
[46:08] so the Corinthians had to learn not to
[46:12] participate in the goat debate
[46:15] is what Paul says
[46:16] I want you to learn not to think above
[46:20] men which is written now don't get me
[46:21] wrong preachers get double honor the
[46:23] Bible says
[46:24] right give them double honor and the
[46:26] Bible says honor all brethren
[46:28] so we all give each other honor but we
[46:31] shouldn't give honor that's above the
[46:33] word of God that's right we got to learn
[46:35] how to do that
[46:36] now it's usually not it's never a
[46:38] problem here that I've ever seen
[46:39] no one ever wants to fall down and can I
[46:42] worship the ground that you walk on
[46:43] brother no one's ever said that thank
[46:45] God
[46:46] Hallelujah
[46:48] I just told you that one time I was down
[46:49] in Columbus and we preached and we had
[46:51] numerous Miracles and that right that
[46:53] service and that brother come up and he
[46:55] asked my wife he said his name was James
[46:57] and he said what is it like to live with
[47:00] brother Jesse
[47:02] she's like that's pretty good no and
[47:06] sometimes because sometimes bad
[47:08] that'd be the truth
[47:10] right maybe she's laughing now you got
[47:13] any live streamers on there
[47:15] but it was just really I mean God really
[47:17] moved to that service and the brother
[47:18] was like now he's really mature now he
[47:21] said later he said later things that
[47:22] kind of hurt our feelings you know he's
[47:24] kind of making fun of our the size of
[47:26] our family and our our van I didn't like
[47:30] that
[47:31] but it just showed his immaturity like
[47:33] what is it like
[47:36] to level be like living with anybody
[47:37] else
[47:39] but remember the Bible says in First
[47:41] Corinthians 3 verse 7.
[47:43] the the preacher who sows sees and the
[47:46] preacher who waters are nothing it's God
[47:48] who gives the increase right so there's
[47:50] that aspect we give them double honor
[47:52] but yet the man can't bring any increase
[47:55] man can't bring Revival God brings
[47:57] Revival amen hallelujah
[48:00] I just like to be there when it happens
[48:02] amen
[48:04] I don't know when the wind's gonna blow
[48:06] but the wind's gonna blow Hallelujah
[48:08] I'm ready for that breeze too
[48:11] and my wife sent me this scripture let's
[48:12] got your Bible Isaiah 10 verse 15. she
[48:15] sent me this a couple days ago I thought
[48:16] wow that's really good
[48:19] and again this this scripture emphasizes
[48:21] how we're Tools in God's hand that's
[48:23] what brother always said Maria said I am
[48:25] just a microphone in the hand of God
[48:28] right right we don't just praise wow
[48:30] that was a great one you hear somebody
[48:31] like Austin's saying really good right
[48:32] on Saturday also saying really good that
[48:35] was the best love song I've ever heard
[48:36] brother
[48:37] that was really great but after he got
[48:39] done I didn't go up and say wow that
[48:41] microphone that was that was really
[48:42] great how did how did that microphone do
[48:43] that
[48:44] it was the voice in front of the
[48:46] microphone right
[48:48] right and that's what it is
[48:51] really when we
[48:55] ezer's just like
[48:56] wow well this is really nice and that's
[48:58] smooth and that's black and look at that
[49:00] Gold Line I mean right right it's just
[49:01] the microphone right that's right
[49:04] Hallelujah
[49:07] Isaiah 10 15.
[49:11] that microphone's gonna rot one day
[49:13] microphone's gonna get uh dust all over
[49:16] it's gonna stop working at some point
[49:19] Isaiah 10 verse 15.
[49:21] shall the ax boast itself against him
[49:24] that he was there with
[49:26] this is actually gonna say look look
[49:27] what I've done
[49:29] uh you know you were look at me look
[49:32] what I've done no the ax doesn't get the
[49:34] glory it's the humor that it's got all
[49:35] the power
[49:38] or shall the saw magnify itself against
[49:40] him that shaketh it look what I've done
[49:43] look what I've done no the guy can just
[49:45] drop this song Let's get another selfie
[49:46] once okay
[49:48] right as if the rod should shake itself
[49:50] against them that lift it up look at me
[49:52] look at this the microphone say look how
[49:54] great I am well look how fantastic I am
[49:57] the microphone's nothing right
[50:00] see in one way we're nothing
[50:02] but one way God could only work by using
[50:05] us praise God
[50:06] see it's just that balance we gotta keep
[50:09] we got to learn the right balance now
[50:11] we've got to hear
[50:13] right
[50:14] but we just want to make sure don't
[50:15] creep in
[50:16] that's why I preached out a series on
[50:18] doctrines of Devils last year I want to
[50:20] make sure I saw it creeping in in all
[50:22] these churches almost every sermon I
[50:23] listen to like I said our children went
[50:24] to youth meeting and this is the first
[50:26] thing the guy preached
[50:28] right
[50:30] why is he is it starts it starts at the
[50:32] top with the big name preachers and I
[50:34] love them but it works their way down if
[50:35] they think about your influence now
[50:37] let's apply that to ourselves let's be
[50:39] careful what we say
[50:41] I especially got to be careful what I
[50:43] say because whenever I say you might
[50:44] pick up on it
[50:45] because I'm influencing you three times
[50:47] a week at least
[50:49] right so we've got to be very careful
[50:50] how I use my influence and so do you
[50:53] especially parents right
[50:57] like they say uh with school teachers
[50:59] and parents the parents always joke
[51:00] around and say uh Mr Smith just believe
[51:03] half of what my children say and I'll
[51:05] just believe half of what they tell me
[51:06] happens at school
[51:07] I said okay that's good
[51:11] foreign
[51:13] let's finish that scripture
[51:14] them that lift it up
[51:17] oh staff should lift up itself as if it
[51:19] were no wood like I like it could lift
[51:22] itself up like the staff of Moses could
[51:24] lift itself up and I'll do this without
[51:25] Moses you can't do nothing without Moses
[51:27] that's right we can't do nothing without
[51:29] Jesus Hallelujah
[51:31] so again the Bible says he that preaches
[51:34] he that Waters is nothing God is the one
[51:36] that gives an increase
[51:38] in other words like Birmingham said I
[51:40] was just there when it happened
[51:42] brother Adam said I wasn't the voice
[51:44] that spoke on the river in 1933 that
[51:47] said as John the Baptist was sent with
[51:48] the forerun the first coming so your
[51:50] message is set to four on the second
[51:52] coming brother I said I was just there
[51:53] when it happened praise God
[51:55] amen
[52:01] I got about seven minutes here um
[52:05] yeah I I wanted to get to this thought
[52:07] uh I better I'll just read the quote and
[52:10] I'll do maybe deal with it on Sunday by
[52:11] God's or I won't preach Sunday so maybe
[52:14] next time
[52:15] I wanted to end the the sermon with that
[52:17] thought about how brother random grew
[52:19] and learn more about Divine Healing
[52:22] so for Years brother Ann would say
[52:24] um he would say
[52:26] the positive mental attitude toward any
[52:29] promise of God will bring it to pass
[52:32] right how many you've heard that before
[52:34] well
[52:36] he stopped saying it about a year and a
[52:38] half before his death
[52:40] because I I believe the Lord helped him
[52:42] to grow in his teaching on Divine
[52:44] Healing
[52:45] okay so think about that
[52:50] you know the right mental attitude
[52:51] toward any promise of God will bring it
[52:54] to pass
[52:55] okay
[52:57] so what if somebody took that and uh
[53:00] they were going after a promise that
[53:02] wasn't for them
[53:04] okay
[53:07] so like I'm trying to think about a a
[53:10] simple promise
[53:13] you know just like uh I don't know maybe
[53:15] a prophet or a dream you know let's say
[53:17] someone wants to try to be a prophet or
[53:19] something like that and they found a
[53:20] promise where it made it seem like in
[53:21] the Bible like like if they could just
[53:23] do this they would get that I'll just
[53:25] use the one like uh people will
[53:28] misconstrue like uh Jesus fasted for 40
[53:31] days right
[53:33] and then he had this great overcoming
[53:35] victory
[53:36] and someone someone might misunderstand
[53:38] that promise and say if I just fast 40
[53:40] days and I'll be able to defeat the
[53:41] Devil
[53:42] right well that that promise might not
[53:45] apply to you
[53:47] right God might not be leading you to
[53:49] fast for 40 days right
[53:51] right now one of our remember brother uh
[53:55] remember Levi the former Amish guy who
[53:57] come here with the black hair and kind
[53:59] of curls down under
[54:00] his daughter fasted for 45 days and she
[54:03] said she got the Holy Ghost
[54:05] that's wonderful I think she's 20
[54:08] 20 something 28 29 I can't remember
[54:11] anyways but the point was that news went
[54:13] down to the church down there in
[54:15] Junction City and they asked me last
[54:16] Thursday I say brother now think about
[54:18] this a nursing mother asked me do I need
[54:20] to fast 40 days to get the Holy Ghost a
[54:22] nursing mom and I said no sir
[54:25] I said no you feed that baby God gave
[54:28] you that baby but I appreciated that her
[54:30] sincerity don't you
[54:32] that's that was pretty powerful
[54:36] and I told her I said no
[54:38] I said the Bible doesn't say thou shalt
[54:40] fast 40 days to get the Holy Ghost
[54:43] and I quoted Acts 2 38 because I
[54:46] said the Bible says repent
[54:49] but you shall be filled amen
[54:51] that's right you didn't say when
[54:54] right
[54:56] and you gotta look at all five times the
[54:57] Holy Ghost fell for the first time they
[54:59] had to wait 10 days uh the second time
[55:01] they had to wait to get hands laid on
[55:03] him by Peter James and John
[55:06] the third time was cornelius's house
[55:08] they got the Holy Ghost Riders the
[55:09] preacher preached amen they didn't have
[55:12] to get on their knees they could just
[55:13] say amen and the Holy Ghost fell and
[55:15] then praise God
[55:17] fourth time was uh
[55:20] Acts 19
[55:21] it was down in Ephesus
[55:23] and they already believed in Jesus Peter
[55:26] and Paul said have you received the Holy
[55:27] Ghost since you believed they said we
[55:28] don't even know there is a baptism Holy
[55:30] Ghost what were you baptized I got the I
[55:33] got John's baptism he said there's
[55:34] another baptism you need to get baptized
[55:36] and then after they were baptized he
[55:38] laid their hands on them and they spoke
[55:39] in tongues and got the Holy Ghost
[55:42] it's different than all the other ones
[55:44] and then Paul got the Holy Ghost shortly
[55:46] after the scales fell off his eyes he
[55:47] got the Holy Ghost
[55:50] so in other words I told him every
[55:52] situation is different
[55:54] I said with my wife and I the Holy Ghost
[55:56] came at a time we weren't really
[55:57] expecting it the day after my wedding
[55:59] I wasn't really expecting that amen I
[56:02] was just trying to get to church
[56:05] laughs
[56:08] uh my wife down there uh I told sir
[56:10] reading her Bible by the beach the ghost
[56:12] fell on her right before work amen
[56:15] before work getting up I don't know if
[56:17] she's getting up early or just you know
[56:18] work was later that morning but she went
[56:19] on there to pray Holy Ghost found her
[56:21] she cried worshiped the Lord felt power
[56:24] and was different had power after that
[56:27] that's what it is it's power to be a
[56:29] witness
[56:30] Hallelujah
[56:31] but not everybody knows exactly brother
[56:33] man said he got it in a shed
[56:36] brother Samuel Browning he's the pastor
[56:37] up there a Sheffield where you went to
[56:39] those youth meetings he got the Holy
[56:40] Ghost and his brother Bill Sanchez's
[56:43] basement next on his knees next to the
[56:45] dog kennel
[56:47] that dog container
[56:49] in his in that basement he they pray
[56:52] right there and he said the Holy Ghost
[56:53] found him right there and he
[56:54] screenshotted and praised the Lord
[56:55] that's where God the Holy Ghost next to
[56:57] a dog
[56:58] amen amen amen
[57:01] brother tells the story that one man I
[57:02] can't remember his name was Robinson
[57:05] and uh
[57:07] everybody tells that story and he he was
[57:09] working in the field he got so hungry
[57:11] for the Holy Ghost
[57:12] he said he stopped his oxen right there
[57:15] and he said he got on his knees and said
[57:16] Lord if you don't find if you don't send
[57:18] me the Holy Ghost now they're gonna find
[57:20] my body my dead body laying here
[57:23] the story was the Holy Ghost fell on him
[57:25] amen he got desperate
[57:28] and then he said there was a real
[57:29] Aristocrat or smart kind of guy he said
[57:32] I want the Holy Ghost he went to this
[57:33] meeting uh with the southerners with a a
[57:36] black church
[57:38] and the man said I was the Holy Ghost
[57:40] and the the black Pastor he said he said
[57:43] okay come over here little man tells the
[57:45] story
[57:46] he says I went to Holy Ghost he said
[57:48] okay come over here it's right over
[57:49] there in the pig pen
[57:51] and the man's like I'm not going to the
[57:53] big bed he said that's the way you got
[57:54] to come to get it God and led him to do
[57:56] that
[57:57] and he fought he argued for a while he
[57:59] said no the holy spirit said so and
[58:01] according to brother I'm sorry a smart
[58:04] guy the election guy he got there and as
[58:05] soon as his knees hit the mud he started
[58:07] praising God and the Holy Ghost fell on
[58:09] the praise God it's just like Naaman
[58:11] right Naaman didn't want to go down to
[58:12] the dirty Jordan River but that was
[58:14] God's will praise God that's right in
[58:16] other words you gotta lose your pride
[58:18] Gotta Lose your status and just want God
[58:21] in your heart praise God
[58:23] amen hallelujah
[58:26] I'm happy to say that Hua and amen loss
[58:29] are there Pride right here at this altar
[58:31] amen and God the Holy Ghost amen power
[58:34] of the witness
[58:35] and you need that power
[58:38] amen's needed that power
[58:40] for the trials of Life they've gone
[58:41] through I
[58:42] have the power for the trial so I've
[58:44] gone through in my life that's right
[58:46] because I wouldn't have been able to
[58:47] maybe handle it without it
[58:50] Hallelujah
[58:51] I just don't need the power for
[58:52] numericals and and helping people I need
[58:55] the power to overcome the enemy too
[59:00] now it's eight o'clock
[59:03] hard to believe
[59:05] so I'll just close with this and then
[59:06] next time I'll I'll go over the Divine
[59:09] Healing uh
[59:11] okay I said anyone that's not learning
[59:13] right now there's something wrong in
[59:15] your life
[59:18] okay that's why I like to go you know
[59:19] sometimes I like to go to these new
[59:21] topics or I like to go right through a
[59:23] whole book of the Bible because that
[59:24] guarantees we're learning something
[59:27] right again it guarantees me every time
[59:30] like when I went back to Esther I
[59:32] learned something new every time
[59:33] right
[59:35] when I preach on the Song of Solomon I
[59:36] learned something new every time
[59:38] that's why it's so important because
[59:40] really I mean we we don't read the Bible
[59:43] as much as we should right right let's
[59:45] just be honest we got busy lives
[59:47] right but the Bible doesn't say thou
[59:48] shalt read the Bible four hours a day or
[59:50] you're back to the Bible don't say that
[59:53] we just got to see God more
[59:55] but I'm saying you know remember all
[59:57] these things are written for our
[59:59] learning the Bible says remember we just
[1:00:01] read that right
[1:00:03] so if we're not learning about God if
[1:00:05] we're not learning about the word
[1:00:06] something's wrong with us
[1:00:09] now we don't want to be wrong we want to
[1:00:11] be right amen
[1:00:13] amen and you're familiar with this I've
[1:00:14] used it you know numerous times over the
[1:00:16] years there's my hour this last quote
[1:00:18] like you're learning to swim you know
[1:00:19] you splash the water and go across the
[1:00:21] pool I made her now after you learn to
[1:00:25] swim more graceful is a stroke and it
[1:00:26] don't wear you out so much see that's it
[1:00:28] you learn how to do it and and cut every
[1:00:30] corner make it better and that's more of
[1:00:32] an ease see a little boy that never
[1:00:34] walked would try to walk down the aisle
[1:00:36] here he would fall down a dozen times to
[1:00:38] be wore out before he got there
[1:00:40] but anyone who knows how to walk an
[1:00:42] athlete would rock right down that aisle
[1:00:44] and never even notice doing it well he
[1:00:46] had he had that to start with that's
[1:00:47] what he is now what's the same way with
[1:00:49] preaching Divine Healing or anything
[1:00:51] else as you go along you begin to learn
[1:00:55] if you don't there's something wrong
[1:00:58] so you've got to learn and you've got to
[1:01:00] learn how to accept God and what it
[1:01:02] really means
[1:01:05] so maybe next time I just I want to make
[1:01:06] a whole video and make it public as well
[1:01:08] I want to preach a whole sermon on how
[1:01:10] brother Adam grew in his understanding
[1:01:11] on Divine Healing
[1:01:16] so I would just generalize it like this
[1:01:18] at the beginning of Brothers Ministry he
[1:01:20] would put the emphasis on you've got to
[1:01:22] believe you've got to believe you've got
[1:01:24] to believe
[1:01:25] but by the end of it he's like you got
[1:01:27] to seek God for God's will
[1:01:30] big difference yeah yeah right right if
[1:01:32] I was awesome at six tonight I'd say
[1:01:34] you've got to believe it's your job it's
[1:01:35] well what if you don't get the healing
[1:01:37] tonight he might feel bad
[1:01:39] right
[1:01:42] but it's totally different when you say
[1:01:43] seek God for it right
[1:01:46] ask the Lord what his will is for the
[1:01:48] situation
[1:01:49] and that's where program got to the end
[1:01:51] and this sermon works as Faith expresses
[1:01:53] I preached it a number of years ago
[1:01:57] he he says we allow Divine Healing
[1:01:59] sometimes we say well this guy didn't
[1:02:00] have enough Faith this guy didn't do
[1:02:02] this or that and church one thing I
[1:02:04] found that's been very destructive at
[1:02:07] least in one church is when people in
[1:02:09] the church criticize somebody for
[1:02:10] missing their healing
[1:02:12] I've seen it destroy
[1:02:14] not destroy fully but I would say
[1:02:17] destroy relationships in a church
[1:02:20] when people in the church criticize
[1:02:22] somebody else and say you missed your
[1:02:24] healing but yet these people are healthy
[1:02:26] all the time
[1:02:28] they don't get sick a lot well it's easy
[1:02:30] for them to say you missed your healing
[1:02:32] because they're not they're not sick
[1:02:34] I've seen it really hurt people
[1:02:37] that's why sometimes I'll go back to
[1:02:40] this and share whenever you're seeking
[1:02:42] God for something you've got to find his
[1:02:44] will first amen that's right gotta find
[1:02:47] his will it's not always God's will to
[1:02:49] heal right
[1:02:50] or save well that's the hard one
[1:02:53] right because we don't want to see
[1:02:54] people lost right
[1:02:57] right that's why I bring that out
[1:02:58] because I've seen that destroy
[1:03:00] relationships in a church
[1:03:03] where people accuse someone of you
[1:03:05] didn't have enough Faith you missed your
[1:03:07] healing
[1:03:08] and then brother Graham says at the end
[1:03:09] of the sermon he said it you can't work
[1:03:11] yourself into it that's right if you
[1:03:14] ever had Faith to be healed God gave it
[1:03:16] to you by Grace
[1:03:18] by Grace amen now I know there's a
[1:03:21] balance of that right because Jesus
[1:03:23] could not do many mighty Miracles
[1:03:24] because of what people's unbelief right
[1:03:27] right but they were already unbelievers
[1:03:29] to begin with what I'm saying is that
[1:03:31] you're a Believer and I don't want you
[1:03:33] to be discouraged
[1:03:35] I want you to be encouraged praise God I
[1:03:37] want you to keep seeking God for
[1:03:38] whatever you're seeking God for praise
[1:03:40] God Amen amen until God makes his will
[1:03:42] known keep seeking God
[1:03:44] you're turning to Faith you wouldn't be
[1:03:46] here if you did that thing Hallelujah
[1:03:48] you got great faith Hallelujah
[1:03:53] there's a reason for that there's a
[1:03:55] reason sometimes it's unconfessed sin
[1:03:57] you could pour a gallon of oil on a
[1:03:59] person and scream till you got hoarse
[1:04:01] it'll never move that devil no sir
[1:04:02] you've got to confess that that's what
[1:04:04] discernment does say go and make that
[1:04:06] right bring that secret out right
[1:04:08] but it's slow doing that you see and
[1:04:10] then the rest of them get impatient and
[1:04:13] say I never I never got prayed for but
[1:04:15] we want to find a way now what takes
[1:04:18] place the real basic of Divine Healing
[1:04:21] let's stand to our feet I'm gonna stop
[1:04:22] right there my God's Grace said
[1:04:23] musicians can come
[1:04:28] learning from Jesus how many glad to
[1:04:29] learn from Jesus today
[1:04:33] like I said there are many things I want
[1:04:35] to learn
[1:04:36] uh as a Christian I want to learn
[1:04:38] especially as a preacher to make things
[1:04:39] so simple that everyone here can
[1:04:41] understand even the deepest topics like
[1:04:44] the Thunders or the third pole or the
[1:04:46] Rapture whatever it may be
[1:04:48] I want to learn how to make things so
[1:04:50] simple
[1:04:51] that whether you know Lena had also been
[1:04:53] here a year and a half or two years or
[1:04:54] whatever that I I can but I can yield to
[1:04:57] the Holy Spirit to make something so
[1:04:59] simple they can catch it
[1:05:01] maybe not the maybe not the fullness of
[1:05:03] it
[1:05:05] but just to make it so simple and take
[1:05:07] all the maybe confusion out or all the
[1:05:10] any doubt or any any questions out of it
[1:05:14] I'd like to learn how to do that by
[1:05:15] God's grace like I said I like to learn
[1:05:17] to yield to the Holy Spirit now this is
[1:05:19] what I really like to learn how to do
[1:05:20] amen to preach where the secrets of your
[1:05:24] heart will be revealed
[1:05:26] and you'll know God is talking right to
[1:05:28] you that's what I like to do
[1:05:30] that would be the greatest blessing of
[1:05:31] my life if I could learn how to do that
[1:05:34] that way I know God's children are
[1:05:35] getting fed God's word
[1:05:38] God's sheep can leave here full that's
[1:05:41] what I want I want God's people to enjoy
[1:05:43] the word of God enjoy worshiping enjoy
[1:05:46] praying
[1:05:47] I want you to feel God's presence praise
[1:05:49] God
[1:05:50] I love like like I always tell you my
[1:05:52] testimonials you know why I tell you
[1:05:53] that because that encourages me I hope
[1:05:54] it encourages you too amen
[1:05:58] I want everybody to be encouraged by
[1:06:00] God's grace keep fighting the good fight
[1:06:01] of Faith there's a crowd awaiting you
[1:06:03] there's a crap
[1:06:05] the endurance crowd
[1:06:07] Hallelujah
[1:06:09] you will have it by God's grace
[1:06:13] so let's bow our heads I think I'm going
[1:06:14] to end like I did last time you know
[1:06:16] think in your heart what what is what do
[1:06:18] you feel like God wants you
[1:06:20] to learn oh yeah there's a whole lot I
[1:06:22] didn't get to okay that I'm glad I could
[1:06:23] separate dude I was a hold on I had to
[1:06:25] hold other things on
[1:06:27] the bride tree and everything like that
