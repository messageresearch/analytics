[45:09] raised the Lord oh the joy the Lord is
[45:15] our strength amen let's take our Bibles
[45:17] here tonight I'd like to preach a little
[45:20] thought that I mentioned on Sunday
[45:23] I like to preach on doctrine the saves I
[45:25] like to preach on that tonight let's go
[45:27] to first Timothy kind of a little
[45:30] thought I felt like the Holy Spirit
[45:33] quick into my heart there so I believe
[45:38] it's first Timothy just a moment while I
[45:39] find a note here
[45:48] first Timothy 4:11 first Timothy 4:11
[45:58] first Timothy 4:11
[46:19] we like to read 11 down to 16 by the
[46:22] grace of the Lord be there say Amen
[46:25] these things command and teach let no
[46:28] man despise thy youth so this was the
[46:30] scripture before I was praying about
[46:32] deciding to pastor I just opened up my
[46:34] Bible the one time I've ever done that
[46:36] and my eyes fell right on that scripture
[46:37] right to verse 12 but no man despise thy
[46:40] youth but be thou an example of the
[46:42] believers in Word in conversation in
[46:45] charity and faith I'm sorry in spirit in
[46:48] faith in purity till i come give
[46:51] attendance to reading to exhortation to
[46:53] doctrine neglect not the gift that is in
[46:58] thee which was given thee by prophecy
[47:00] with the laying on of the hands of the
[47:02] presbytery meditate upon these things
[47:05] give thyself wholly to them that thou
[47:09] profiting may appear to all take heed
[47:13] unto thyself so he's talking to a
[47:15] preacher a young preacher named Timothy
[47:17] take heed to yourself and unto the
[47:20] doctrine so see there's really just one
[47:22] doctrine really there's just only one
[47:25] faith take heed to the one doctrine
[47:29] continue in them for in doing this thou
[47:33] shalt both save thyself and them that
[47:37] hear thee if you can preach the right
[47:41] doctrine and live it and apply it to
[47:43] your life and preach it and the people
[47:46] receive it everybody's gonna be saved oh
[47:49] my what a responsibility church let's
[47:52] just bow our heads if you have a need on
[47:53] your heart let's make it known unto God
[47:55] by raising your hand Heavenly Father
[47:57] Lord we're true the word the climax here
[47:59] of the service Lord we've loved
[48:02] worshiping you we're so thankful you're
[48:04] coming back again Lord God Satan will be
[48:08] bound a thousand years will have no
[48:10] tempter then after you come back to
[48:13] earth again oh how we longed for that
[48:15] Lord how we get weary sometimes in the
[48:18] battle of over temptation but Lord as we
[48:21] heard on Sunday we've got keys Lord to
[48:23] be able to lock ourselves into Christ
[48:26] and and Lord flee resist the devil and
[48:29] he flees from us
[48:30] thank you for those keys or we're
[48:33] looking forward to that coming Lord
[48:34] prepares tonight Lord with this little
[48:37] message Lord it trust to be a blessing
[48:38] to the hearts of the people anoint me
[48:40] Lord anoint your people for thy glory in
[48:42] Jesus Christ name and the church said
[48:45] Amen god bless you just being seated
[48:47] praise the Lord I'd like to call this
[48:50] doctrine the saves it's kind of a simple
[48:53] thought here tonight I was preaching on
[48:57] Sunday under the inspiration of the Holy
[48:59] Spirit and it just kind of got quickened
[49:01] to me a little bit here you know I just
[49:05] heard you know and I don't mean to be
[49:06] I'm not critical or anything about just
[49:08] her different preachers say you know
[49:10] they kind of kind of a harsh on doctrine
[49:15] you know the for example one that I
[49:17] heard is the message is not a doctrine
[49:19] it's a person and so that kind of saying
[49:22] we don't need doctrine we just need the
[49:25] person of Christ so I think I think some
[49:31] things need to be taught through the
[49:32] scripture and I think we'll understand
[49:34] that I want to get back to that quote
[49:35] because I I agree with it to a point but
[49:39] I don't think that is actually rightly
[49:42] divided I really don't think that's
[49:44] right Lee divided so we started here
[49:47] with our text
[49:49] Paul Paul thought the Lord was coming in
[49:53] his day how many know that he thought he
[49:55] was coming in his day John thought he
[49:57] was coming in his day Peter thought he
[49:59] was coming in his day
[50:00] all the saints thought he was coming his
[50:02] day and now Paul you know he's writing
[50:06] to Timothy and he tells Timothy give
[50:09] your attendance to reading exhortation
[50:13] and doctrine okay exhortation of course
[50:16] is communication with the Saints
[50:18] exhorting edifying communicating to the
[50:21] Saints and doctrine simply know what the
[50:25] word doctor means what word first comes
[50:28] your mind anybody got an idea
[50:32] kind of like that yeah it means
[50:34] instruction instruction the word
[50:37] doctrine literally means instruction in
[50:40] the Greek now that oughta maybe if you
[50:43] remember I don't I don't say
[50:44] you have to but when we were preaching
[50:46] to him the wisdom series with proverbs
[50:48] and Ecclesiastes and I'm still not done
[50:49] on that by the way I preached a whole
[50:52] message on instruction growing
[50:55] increasing understanding increasing
[50:57] instruction right so we'll get to that
[51:00] too
[51:01] but Paul's telling Timothy you must give
[51:04] yourself to doctrine pay attention to
[51:07] reading pay attention to speaking pay
[51:09] attention to instruction do not neglect
[51:13] the gift then he says take heed unto
[51:16] yourself and then he goes back to the
[51:17] doctrine watch your life make sure you
[51:21] live the right life and make sure you're
[51:23] instructing the people the right way and
[51:27] that's been my own desire is to instruct
[51:30] you to be ready for the rapture right if
[51:34] you're not called to the rapture though
[51:35] then mom I'm gonna instruct you to be as
[51:38] why era's good if a foolish virgin as
[51:40] you can be right because we love
[51:42] everybody you know we don't know who's
[51:43] who but we love everybody but
[51:46] instructing to be as wise as you can be
[51:48] and to be as much as a virgin as you can
[51:51] to Christ right be as pure as you can to
[51:53] Jesus Christ amen and I realize that
[51:57] brother Branham says there's three kinds
[51:59] of believers in every Church how many
[52:00] understand you got that they got quotes
[52:03] like that and we know Satan doesn't sit
[52:06] out there in the nomination so much he
[52:07] actually tries to target the real bride
[52:09] amen remember we heard that quote last
[52:11] week where where brother Branham said I
[52:14] said Branham Tabernacle will lose your
[52:16] strength how are they gonna lose their
[52:17] strength he said through gossip one
[52:20] person getting the wrong spirit on him
[52:22] and saying something bad about somebody
[52:23] else he said that's how they're gonna
[52:26] lose their strength but he said there'll
[52:28] be some saved out of Jeffersonville he
[52:30] said there'll be some going the rapture
[52:31] out of Texas or Colorado or New York and
[52:35] we see that by God's grace so I want to
[52:40] make sure I read that verse 16 again
[52:41] take heed unto thyself so preachers must
[52:44] really watch their own lives and unto
[52:47] the doctrine the instruction that they
[52:48] give the church continue in them for in
[52:51] doing this thou shalt both save thyself
[52:53] and them that hear thee so a preacher
[52:58] must understand salvation before the
[53:02] people can the preacher has to be saved
[53:04] first in order to point people to
[53:06] salvation a preachers gotta be filled
[53:09] with the Holy Ghost first before he can
[53:11] point people to the Holy Ghost right
[53:15] he's got to be born again and so that's
[53:18] true as well with doctrine now let me go
[53:23] really read the the definition of
[53:24] doctrine it's the Greek word did a
[53:28] Scalia which means instruction doctrine
[53:33] learning teaching instruction doctrine
[53:36] was so important that Jesus's last
[53:38] Commission was go forth into all the
[53:40] world and do what teach nations to
[53:45] observe all that I command
[53:46] so doctrine and teaching are kind of go
[53:49] together you cannot teach the word
[53:51] without giving doctrine you can't you
[53:55] have to have boat you is the one in the
[53:57] same teaching is doctrine if you're
[54:00] teaching on how to pray teach you on how
[54:02] to fast teach you and how to receive the
[54:04] Holy Ghost there's in steps and
[54:06] instructions you must do in church of
[54:08] your spiritual even teaching how to get
[54:10] saved is a doctrine because what is it
[54:13] involved repentance how do we be saved
[54:16] repent and be baptized
[54:18] that's instruction that's doctrine so we
[54:22] do not even have salvation without a
[54:25] doctorate amen you can't you and I can't
[54:27] even get saved unless we have a doctrine
[54:30] that's true every sermon any preacher
[54:36] ever preached was doctrine
[54:40] hallelujah and see that's what I've
[54:42] heard preachers make it sound like it's
[54:44] not that's not true every sermon that
[54:47] was ever preached that told you to do
[54:49] something or or appointed you to do
[54:51] something to instruct in you anything
[54:53] was doctrine have you ever heard a
[54:55] sermon that did not instruct you to do
[54:57] anything I hope not I hope not here I
[55:05] know I heard someone I was in
[55:07] denomination to just about different
[55:10] things you know different
[55:12] politics and stuff you know movies and
[55:14] entertainment sports hopefully in the
[55:17] message hopefully in our message Church
[55:21] our sister churches hopefully every
[55:23] sermon you've heard has been instructing
[55:25] you to do something you know many times
[55:28] with our sermon church is instruction on
[55:30] how to live a more sanctified life its
[55:34] instruction how to repent or when to
[55:36] repent or what you need to repent of
[55:38] it's instruction in those areas every
[55:41] sermon has instruction in if it's a real
[55:45] sermon you can't you can't say well I'm
[55:46] just preaching salvation and there's no
[55:48] doctrine here wrong got the wrong idea
[55:51] you got a confusion right there has to
[55:56] be some instruction I want to be saying
[55:58] oh just what must I do just be saved
[56:02] does that sound like it's right no just
[56:05] believe what do you mean believe even
[56:07] the demons believe but what makes what
[56:11] makes our belief different from the
[56:13] demons because we repent and we be
[56:16] baptized right and we humble ourselves
[56:18] that we obey we obey the Word of God
[56:21] amen
[56:22] because we know what the Word of God
[56:24] instructs us to do praise God because
[56:27] hearers are not justified only but doers
[56:31] doers of the instruction that's been
[56:34] given to us so I hope I've already
[56:37] remoulded your whole thought about
[56:39] doctrine within the last 2 minutes of
[56:40] this sermon every sermon is doctrine and
[56:44] you cannot be saved you and I cannot be
[56:47] saved without doctrine program said
[56:50] doctrine is based on God's Word not on
[56:53] experience people can have experiences
[56:57] of everything he talks about going on
[56:58] the jungles and women sacrificing their
[57:00] babies with sincerity and witchdoctors
[57:03] drinking blood out of a skull and people
[57:05] saying they have all kinds of sensations
[57:07] and all these things he said that's not
[57:09] doctor and he said you can't base your
[57:10] doctrine on experiences it's got to be
[57:13] based upon the Word of God program said
[57:18] this and I found the quote in 1961
[57:20] brother have said any man that has not a
[57:24] doctrine
[57:25] not a ministry hallelujah a preacher
[57:30] isn't even a preacher
[57:32] unless he's first got a doctrine that's
[57:35] what your prophet said and the church
[57:37] said that's what my prophet said you're
[57:40] not a preacher unless you have a
[57:42] doctrine some type of instruction if
[57:44] you're not getting up here to tell
[57:46] people what to do you're not even
[57:47] preaching you're supposed to point them
[57:50] and tell them what to do let's say you
[57:52] just get up here and you go over the
[57:54] events of the rapture you know the shop
[57:55] Boise Trump and it's really not you know
[57:57] and if you just tell the order of events
[58:00] or let's say you just tell the order of
[58:01] events of Jesus's resurrection or
[58:03] something like that
[58:03] that's wonderful but that's not really
[58:05] doctrine yet we got to bring it down to
[58:08] have you received the shout have you
[58:11] heard the shout and what do you need to
[58:13] do to hear the shout amen
[58:16] what steps do I need to do to know that
[58:19] I've really heard the shout and I trim
[58:21] my lamp and get in order and I go out to
[58:23] meet Jesus amen with my lamp trimmed in
[58:26] here what an instruction you see so yeah
[58:29] I guess you could have a message
[58:30] preacher you know just preach all these
[58:32] maybe all these types of Christ with
[58:34] Joseph and Boaz and all these you could
[58:35] do that and that's wonderful and just
[58:38] like the numbers like the numbers series
[58:40] I've been preaching that's wonderful to
[58:41] have all those numbers but how does that
[58:43] apply to you like we saw last week one
[58:46] thing that clearly applies to us is the
[58:48] complete worship of seven we can worship
[58:50] more with our complete hearts amen we
[58:53] should be worshiping with our complete
[58:55] hearts we should be under the sit number
[58:58] six we should be an anointed man or
[59:00] woman for the kingdom of God that's
[59:02] because that's the only real humans that
[59:04] are on the earth everybody else is just
[59:06] a beast that's anointed of the spirit of
[59:08] the devil but we are the real humans
[59:11] real were the real redeemed son of
[59:13] Adam's race amen hallelujah we have to
[59:17] fulfill that six and you look for the
[59:20] number five you must experience God's
[59:22] grace amen and we know the instruction
[59:25] to do that in acts 2:38 we know the
[59:27] instructions to receive God's grace but
[59:30] every preacher that doesn't have a
[59:33] doctrine doesn't have a preaching
[59:34] ministry and that's a direct quote by
[59:37] the way so you can look that up
[59:39] now I must say this to brother Ham said
[59:45] a church without a doctrine is just like
[59:48] a jellyfish
[59:51] hey brother Jes you're preaching too
[59:54] much doctrine you got to preach more on
[59:55] the word or you got to preach more on
[59:57] the gospel well fine I'll leave my
[59:59] doctrines behind and I'll just change
[1:00:01] our church to the jellyfish Church the
[1:00:04] jellyfish fellowship we're absent
[1:00:09] without a doctrine he said the church is
[1:00:12] just like a jellyfish and that's a
[1:00:14] direct quote it has no backbone so we've
[1:00:22] got to have backbone in it so my dad
[1:00:24] said you've got to have backbone and you
[1:00:25] don't have backbone without doctrine so
[1:00:27] what do we need doctrine and now also
[1:00:31] backbone but teeth also so you got a
[1:00:36] backbone you've gotta have teeth because
[1:00:38] the Church of God must eat the bread of
[1:00:39] life God give us a back mow so we can
[1:00:44] stand up against Satan and then give us
[1:00:46] teeth that we can chew and feast on this
[1:00:48] word amen glory oh we don't you too much
[1:00:53] doctrine you're too much instruction Oh
[1:00:55] nonsense
[1:00:57] that's either a prideful spear ignorant
[1:00:59] spirit or some type of other spear
[1:01:01] critical spirit maybe something like
[1:01:03] that a church without a doctrine is a
[1:01:06] jellyfish last time I checked Eagles
[1:01:09] lambs doves lions all got backbones is
[1:01:17] that right church hallelujah we gotta
[1:01:21] have a backbone we got to know what we
[1:01:23] believe we got a know where we stand
[1:01:24] number without the fivefold ministry
[1:01:26] you'll be carried around about every
[1:01:29] wind of false doctrine carried from this
[1:01:33] idea of that idea of that idea we need a
[1:01:36] solid backbone Church that's not a
[1:01:39] jellyfish amen
[1:01:40] that knows where they stand that
[1:01:42] believes every word and lives by it amen
[1:01:45] they have instructions how to get ready
[1:01:47] for the rapture praise the Lord
[1:01:52] you want the Holy Ghost pray up and he
[1:01:54] gives all the steps so one thing for
[1:01:56] sure we can say our instructions are
[1:01:58] pretty easy last time I put together
[1:02:01] that telescope I'll tell you about is
[1:02:03] about 50 steps instructions well the
[1:02:06] Holy Ghost is pretty easy repent me
[1:02:07] baptize pray until you get the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost that's pretty easy Church pretty
[1:02:13] easy instruction manual and the church
[1:02:14] said this isn't a fool will not air in
[1:02:19] this instruction amen a fool Isaiah 35
[1:02:24] said a fool won't miss the way of
[1:02:26] holiness and the highway of holiness
[1:02:28] praise God the way of holiness because
[1:02:31] we know a highway has two lanes but the
[1:02:32] way of holiness is going up and the
[1:02:34] fools go down right a fool not err
[1:02:37] foolish version will not air this even
[1:02:40] though understand virgin to the word now
[1:02:45] in that series on wisdom and which I'm
[1:02:50] still working on proverbs 1:7 the fear
[1:02:52] of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:02:53] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[1:02:56] instruction so now we know if these
[1:03:02] these things are not repented of now we
[1:03:04] know what kind of message churches they
[1:03:06] are if they say they don't need more
[1:03:09] doctrine they're foolish virgin because
[1:03:12] foolish despise instruction fools
[1:03:20] despise it that's proverbs 1:7 and
[1:03:24] church even if we can we can preach all
[1:03:26] the doctor we want but if we don't apply
[1:03:28] to our lives we're just as foolish
[1:03:30] praise God or just as foolish if we
[1:03:33] don't become better Christians through
[1:03:35] our services we're just as foolish as
[1:03:37] any other person hearing it doesn't make
[1:03:42] us justified but doing makes us
[1:03:43] justified amen proverbs 4:13 take fast
[1:03:48] hold on instruction so that means a real
[1:03:51] strong grip hold on to what you've been
[1:03:54] instructed to do from the Word of God by
[1:03:57] the Holy Spirit hold on to it with a
[1:03:58] tight grip let her not go for she is thy
[1:04:03] life now
[1:04:06] now we're starting to get somewhere when
[1:04:08] you hold on to instruction I got to do
[1:04:10] this this this so please God when you
[1:04:12] hold on to that you're close to life now
[1:04:17] you can't separate instruction from life
[1:04:20] instruction leads to life praise the
[1:04:24] Lord a few years ago when I taught third
[1:04:27] grade we were given instructions on how
[1:04:29] to bring life to the with the chickens
[1:04:32] eggs and the incubator I think they
[1:04:34] bought us an incubator and I had to
[1:04:36] follow directions to bring forth the
[1:04:38] chickens out of the incubator if I
[1:04:41] followed directions it brought forth
[1:04:42] life amen hallelujah
[1:04:45] and we don't want incubator chickens
[1:04:47] here we want a real eagle egg that's
[1:04:49] been under the real mother eagle amen
[1:04:51] and the dead because they take turns
[1:04:54] dad will sit on for a while mom will go

[1:05:54] sounds very foolish doesn't it
[1:05:57] fools despise instruction they can't be
[1:06:00] taught
[1:06:00] my brother said a mule can't be taught
[1:06:02] anything new but a thoroughbred can be
[1:06:05] taught something praise the Lord we need
[1:06:09] to be able to come to church and be
[1:06:10] taught and instructed on the Word of God
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:15] that's just plain
[1:06:17] Bible instruction doctrine the wise love
[1:06:21] doctrine fools hate it they spot despise
[1:06:24] it praise the Lord
[1:06:27] let's go to John 7:15 if you got your
[1:06:29] Bible John 7:15 I mentioned this earlier
[1:06:34] is everybody feeling okay tonight
[1:06:37] already feeling fine praise the Lord I'm
[1:06:42] feeling good Robert 7:15 and the Jews
[1:06:48] marveled saying how know of this man
[1:06:50] letters having never learned jesus
[1:06:52] answered them and said my doctrine is
[1:06:53] not mine but his that sent me huh Jesus
[1:06:56] Christ had doctrine the Lord Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ peace preached doctrine yeah and
[1:07:02] church he said it wasn't even his it was
[1:07:04] borrowed amen it was loaned it was
[1:07:08] taught from his Heavenly Father
[1:07:09] hallelujah amen
[1:07:13] mark 1118 here's what real doctrine
[1:07:17] produces mark 1118 this is why no
[1:07:20] doctrine so important I've never ever
[1:07:23] thought once in my life doctrine wasn't
[1:07:25] important
[1:07:25] in fact I've always known true doctrine
[1:07:28] proves you're in the right false
[1:07:30] doctrine proves you're in the wrong mark
[1:07:33] 11 18
[1:07:41] now at this point Jesus had already
[1:07:43] cursed the fig tree with the spoken word
[1:07:46] and then he comes in this is the second
[1:07:50] time he's cleanse the temple member he
[1:07:52] cleaned it at the beginning of his
[1:07:54] ministry and he cleaned it at the end
[1:07:56] Alpha and Omega amen
[1:07:58] they getting it in hallelujah so we know
[1:08:03] God's gonna clean the church at the end
[1:08:04] for us to praise the Lord
[1:08:07] we all need a good cleaning out that's
[1:08:11] if you want to be in the rapture now I
[1:08:13] like to be in the rapture Lord clean us
[1:08:16] out so he's already exercised all these
[1:08:20] spoken word and all this and then a
[1:08:22] verse verse 18 and the scribes and the
[1:08:26] chief priests heard it and saw how they
[1:08:28] might destroy him for they feared him
[1:08:29] because all the people was astonished at
[1:08:31] his doctrine this guy instructs us to do
[1:08:36] pretty strange things get out of the
[1:08:38] money other church get all the other
[1:08:40] lakhs of days ago spirits out of the
[1:08:42] church get all the greed out of the
[1:08:44] church and he thought it so much he
[1:08:46] drove him out with a rope and cord
[1:08:48] praise God
[1:08:49] what kind of doctrine is this guy he
[1:08:51] really wants a clean church and they're
[1:08:53] astonished at his doctrine praise God
[1:08:55] but he didn't get his doctrine on his
[1:08:57] own he got it from the father and Church
[1:09:00] that's what we can say too we're not
[1:09:02] preaching brother branham's doctrine
[1:09:04] we're preaching Jesus Christ doctrine
[1:09:06] that he gave to brother Branham let me
[1:09:09] understand that it wasn't like program
[1:09:13] thought of this thought of these new
[1:09:15] thoughts and then it was written on the
[1:09:16] Bible no brother Branham was restoring
[1:09:18] what the original doctrine wardi was
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:21] he was restoring the faith of the
[1:09:24] Apostolic fathers jesus said in John
[1:09:28] 8:28 I do nothing of myself as I speak
[1:09:32] the fog I only speak what the father has
[1:09:35] taught me amen in John 12 jesus said my
[1:09:42] father gave me commandment what to speak
[1:09:45] everything Jesus taught was from the
[1:09:47] father in John 14 10 he said the words I
[1:09:51] speak unto you I speak not of myself
[1:09:54] a man in John 14 24 he said the word he
[1:09:59] here is not mine but the fathers that
[1:10:02] sent me now go to mark chapter 1 here's
[1:10:06] here's the one I was looking for this is
[1:10:07] the one mark chapter 1 1 21 this is
[1:10:17] where I cast out demons in Capernaum in
[1:10:21] the synagogue there's a man with an
[1:10:23] unclean spirit don't we have that today
[1:10:24] too people come to church with unclean
[1:10:27] spirits in the church god help us to
[1:10:29] cast everyone out by the Spirit of God
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:33] all right we don't want lying spirits we
[1:10:35] know what lustful spirits we don't want
[1:10:37] critical spirits we don't want prideful
[1:10:39] spirits and we cast them out in Jesus
[1:10:41] Christ's name Amen
[1:10:44] and we've seen it recently like I said
[1:10:46] with the Critical spirits I've seen God
[1:10:48] do it amen
[1:10:51] God does that and that's the power of
[1:10:55] his doctrine amen glory mark 1:21 now
[1:11:00] through 28 now he said I'm gonna skip
[1:11:02] ahead verse 25 and Jesus rebuked him
[1:11:05] saying hold thy peace and come out of
[1:11:07] him and when the unclean spirit had torn
[1:11:08] him he cried with a loud voice he came
[1:11:10] out of him and they were all amazed in
[1:11:12] so much they questioned among themselves
[1:11:13] saying what new thing is this what new
[1:11:16] doctrine is this casting out Devils is a
[1:11:21] doctrine in the church said to operate
[1:11:26] in the power of God you must know the
[1:11:28] instructions of God like bro man taught
[1:11:31] us before somebody can be here they've
[1:11:33] got to confess their sins or that Devils
[1:11:35] not going to move what is that that's
[1:11:37] instruction that's doctrine how many
[1:11:39] want the doctrine of God amen
[1:11:40] what new dot we ever seen preachers cast
[1:11:43] out demons like this before
[1:11:44] what new doctrine is this this is the
[1:11:46] doctrine of their heavenly Father come
[1:11:49] down to earth in his earthly saying
[1:11:51] hallelujah and now he sends us forth
[1:11:54] just as the father sent him forth fill
[1:11:56] them with the Holy Ghost and send them
[1:11:58] forth as I have my father sent me so
[1:12:00] send I you praise God and let me sit on
[1:12:02] this church so God has sent you out to
[1:12:04] your field each one of you have a field
[1:12:07] of ministry right Church
[1:12:08] and he has sent you the same way if you
[1:12:11] filled only ghosts he sent you the same
[1:12:12] way to take the Word of God take the
[1:12:15] power of God take the doctrine of God
[1:12:17] and manifest it in your life
[1:12:19] hey man ha ha ha thank you Jesus glory
[1:12:24] for with authority commandeth he even
[1:12:27] the unclean spirits and they do obey Him
[1:12:30] what new doctrine is this so power and
[1:12:34] doctrine go hand in hand I hope that
[1:12:38] makes sense does that help everybody ok
[1:12:41] I hope so by the grace of the Lord let
[1:12:47] me read a few quotations brother Branham
[1:12:52] was kind of a talking to a Catholic
[1:12:55] priest lately he said the mr. Branum are
[1:12:57] you a non Catholic or Protestant I said
[1:13:00] a Protestant he said then you protest us
[1:13:02] I said no sir
[1:13:03] I do not protest the people it's the
[1:13:07] church the doctrine of the church
[1:13:11] remember Timothy said be careful or Paul
[1:13:13] told Timothy be careful there'll be
[1:13:15] doctrines of devils Devils can teach
[1:13:18] really slick right Devils can make it
[1:13:22] sound so sweet like you're in the bride
[1:13:26] age here in the Millennium already and
[1:13:28] there's nothing you've never yet and you
[1:13:31] can't even sinner or you've got a second
[1:13:33] soul now and now you can put away your
[1:13:35] old life and get a new one and it's
[1:13:37] alright oh it sounds so slick and it's
[1:13:40] so sweet but it's a lie from the pit of
[1:13:42] hell
[1:13:43] amen doctrines of devils now we are in
[1:13:48] the bride age in your soul
[1:13:50] but we're still living in Laodicea
[1:13:52] that's right
[1:13:55] he said are you then you call yourself a
[1:13:57] Baptist or Presbyterian no sir just a
[1:13:59] Christian well where do you form your
[1:14:03] own form of doctrine to be a Christian
[1:14:05] you have to have a basic form of
[1:14:06] doctrine
[1:14:07] I said that's true brother says to be a
[1:14:09] Christian you've got to have a basic
[1:14:11] form of doctrine a head you are so
[1:14:14] you're not even a Christian without
[1:14:15] Doctor and amen nor are you a preacher
[1:14:20] without a doctrine you can't be a
[1:14:22] Christian without instruction and you
[1:14:24] can't be a preacher without instruction
[1:14:26] that's scorned a brother branham of
[1:14:28] course the Bible too he said that's true
[1:14:32] he said I get my form of instruction
[1:14:34] it's the Bible well that's the history
[1:14:38] of the Catholic Church I said the
[1:14:40] apostles were Catholics he said yes sir
[1:14:42] I said all right I'm going to admit that
[1:14:43] that's right I said then why don't you
[1:14:45] say stay also with the scripture he said
[1:14:47] you see Christ getting the church power
[1:14:49] to change the scripture anytime they
[1:14:50] want to now that's where that devil
[1:14:52] slipped right in there they said oh the
[1:14:55] scripture is our doctrine but Christ
[1:14:59] gave the church the power to change the
[1:15:01] scripture and brother Graham picks it up
[1:15:04] he picks up that lie he said well then
[1:15:07] you've changed and you've got it what
[1:15:09] you got today he said then you've
[1:15:11] changed and got it what you got today he
[1:15:14] said yes sir I said then I want to ask
[1:15:15] you something then Christ must not be
[1:15:17] pleased with it because of on upon the
[1:15:20] first church he poured out the Holy
[1:15:22] Ghost that he healed the sick raise the
[1:15:24] dead cast out Devils and done great
[1:15:26] mighty miracles under the doctrine of
[1:15:28] the first Catholic Church and it hasn't
[1:15:31] been seen in the Catholic Church since
[1:15:32] they changed the doctrine hey hey
[1:15:39] brother Branham says the the original
[1:15:41] apostolic faith is called the doctrine
[1:15:43] of the first Catholic Church that's a
[1:15:47] great wave came to bring back to us the
[1:15:49] doctrine of the first universal Church
[1:15:51] we are a Catholic Church we are a
[1:15:54] universal Church but only Universal
[1:15:56] through the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:15:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you
[1:16:00] don't have that or the either one of
[1:16:02] those a brother of Christ the Baptist
[1:16:03] all he goes you're not yet a part of the
[1:16:05] universal Church you might get it on the
[1:16:08] day of judgment you might get in as a
[1:16:11] sheep gets in right at that the white
[1:16:13] throne doesn't you might get in for
[1:16:15] being into the Bride of Christ but until
[1:16:17] then you're not really a part of it only
[1:16:19] those who are born again only those who
[1:16:21] have the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:16:23] Christ that's the universal Church oh
[1:16:25] that's right amen
[1:16:32] tells us this he said I do not agree
[1:16:35] with organization because they would say
[1:16:38] we believe this with a comma he says I'm
[1:16:41] sorry he said well we believe this
[1:16:42] period that's all wrong see if you end
[1:16:44] your doctor with a comma we believe this
[1:16:47] Plus as much as God wants to add to it
[1:16:49] but when you say we believe this period
[1:16:51] and that's all then you shut God right
[1:16:53] out of it see and that's the way the
[1:16:55] organization's do they end it with the
[1:16:57] period so every denomination ends it
[1:17:02] with a period and God can't reveal any
[1:17:04] more after that
[1:17:05] now jerks we got to be careful the
[1:17:07] message we have we we have all of our
[1:17:09] doctrines but how many know there's
[1:17:11] going to be a revelation come and
[1:17:13] program calls it's the revelation of the
[1:17:16] rapture he said the bride is waiting for
[1:17:20] the revelation of the rapture there's a
[1:17:23] rapture to come it's a revelation he
[1:17:26] also calls it the latter rain
[1:17:27] that's the revelation we're waiting for
[1:17:30] is the revelation of the latter rain
[1:17:32] that will change our bodies in the
[1:17:34] moment and a twinkling of an eye so
[1:17:38] after all my rapture doctrine shout
[1:17:41] voice Trump changed it's wink of an eye
[1:17:43] glorified body theophany where you get
[1:17:48] up after all that I put a comma and I'm
[1:17:50] waiting for latter rain amen
[1:17:53] I'm waiting for faith that falls to
[1:17:55] receive it and then to be changed on
[1:17:58] Eluga I'm waiting for that I don't put a
[1:18:00] beard because I'm waiting for a ladder
[1:18:02] rain face hey man that's exactly right
[1:18:11] now I hope you understand that you got
[1:18:13] to balance that statement - for example
[1:18:17] with water baptism let's make it real
[1:18:19] simple
[1:18:19] I believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:24] baptism is the only Bible baptism comma
[1:18:29] well I don't know if you need to come on
[1:18:31] that one we might take a period on that
[1:18:34] you understand what I'm saying
[1:18:36] what could be added it you and I we have
[1:18:39] searched the book of Acts there's no
[1:18:41] other baptisms other than the Lord Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ so
[1:18:45] understand you understand what I'm
[1:18:46] saying like you know we don't want to
[1:18:50] put a period on God but there's some
[1:18:52] doctrines where there's gonna there's
[1:18:54] not gonna be any any change to that
[1:18:57] understand but there are doctrines that
[1:19:00] we need more revelation on right like
[1:19:03] the shout voice Trump I know for sure
[1:19:05] the voice and I know for sure the Trump
[1:19:08] because they haven't happened yet
[1:19:09] and if they haven't happened yet then we
[1:19:11] still need more revelation of them
[1:19:13] praise God in other words we need to be
[1:19:17] in the spirit of prophecy when they come
[1:19:19] to pass and that will only come by
[1:19:21] staying with all the word that God has
[1:19:23] revealed to us amen so hope you
[1:19:26] understand that I agree we must end our
[1:19:28] doctrine with a comma but we got to be
[1:19:33] careful what we mean by that oh well
[1:19:35] maybe there'll be a new baptism and and
[1:19:37] we'll all have a new water baptism when
[1:19:39] brother Branham is raised back and he
[1:19:41] flies around the world in a jet knocked
[1:19:43] yeah
[1:19:44] that's false you see you see how you got
[1:19:48] to be careful you want to be careful
[1:19:50] with that statement too we we just need
[1:19:52] the wisdom of God now this quote applies
[1:19:55] to organization right so every move of
[1:19:58] God must keep an open heart for more
[1:20:00] revelation of God's Word amen you and I
[1:20:04] let's keep an open heart for more
[1:20:05] revelation of God's Word especially in
[1:20:08] our daily lives for example if you have
[1:20:10] a gift of divine healing you and I must
[1:20:11] be open with the comma to receive more
[1:20:14] instruction on divine healing so we can
[1:20:16] grow in our ministries they men or like
[1:20:20] a mother or a father well I know all
[1:20:23] everything about being a mother period
[1:20:25] no don't what appeared there put a comma
[1:20:26] there God may reveal something to you
[1:20:29] that you maybe never heard before or I'm
[1:20:33] the perfect father I'm a perfect pastor
[1:20:35] period I know everything about it no put
[1:20:37] a comma there so we can grow and learn
[1:20:39] and we can be humble about it
[1:20:40] and say God perhaps there's something
[1:20:42] I'm missing I know there must be if the
[1:20:44] rapture had taken place
[1:20:45] I need more you momentum says this in
[1:20:50] question is an answer 61 program said
[1:20:54] the Lord gave me a vision remember when
[1:20:56] he went out in Chicago before 300
[1:20:57] Trinitarian preachers and they all
[1:20:59] agreed to
[1:20:59] all wanted tapes on water baptism and
[1:21:01] they agreed to come down to the
[1:21:02] tabernacle but they never came well they
[1:21:05] have said he the Lord told me and gave
[1:21:07] me a vision and told me where we'd be
[1:21:09] and what to do I said there before 300
[1:21:11] Trinitarian ministers and I said now if
[1:21:13] I am so wrong in this doctrine of water
[1:21:16] baptism some of you men stand up here
[1:21:19] and show me where I'm wrong by the
[1:21:21] scriptures without your textbook if
[1:21:26] there is no such thing as a serpent seed
[1:21:29] or something like that then I've been
[1:21:30] teaching just come here and show me by
[1:21:32] the scriptures nobody move rather have
[1:21:38] said it was a quietest group of
[1:21:40] preachers you've ever heard in your life
[1:21:43] this prove and disprove water baptism
[1:21:46] this proofs over and seen by the Bible
[1:21:48] crickets okay good there's nothing that
[1:21:53] there's no scripture that disproves
[1:21:55] water baptism in Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:57] there's no scripture he says nobody move
[1:22:02] because it can't be done haha that's
[1:22:06] true not to be different but it's just
[1:22:08] the truth
[1:22:09] it's the word no one can debate that
[1:22:12] that's the Word of God no one can do it
[1:22:14] Church do you realize that nobody can
[1:22:16] obey our doctrine our doctrine is so
[1:22:18] sound it's nothing but thus saith the
[1:22:20] Lord amen
[1:22:21] there is no debate about it it's the
[1:22:24] word and there's only one word there's
[1:22:25] only one faith there's only one doctrine
[1:22:27] and we've got it amen
[1:22:29] there's no debate now they'll debate
[1:22:32] with us but as long as we stand on the
[1:22:34] word there's no debate about it because
[1:22:36] you add to it you can't take away from
[1:22:38] it and we believe just what's in here
[1:22:41] that's it hallelujah program said it
[1:22:44] can't be proven wrong the serpent seed
[1:22:46] cannot be proven wrong oh so we say I
[1:22:49] approve brother branham wrong I approve
[1:22:50] the serpent seed wrong I prove that
[1:22:52] Godhead wrong it can't be done
[1:22:55] you're gonna see fella or sister here to
[1:22:58] see it cannot be done you can't prove
[1:23:00] God's revelation wrong you're not going
[1:23:02] to prove the Bible wrong because jesus
[1:23:04] said thy Word is truth that's right now
[1:23:10] let's look
[1:23:10] this year brother branham said he came
[1:23:14] back to restore the original Pentecostal
[1:23:17] preaching without doctrine does that
[1:23:19] sound right no he said he came back to
[1:23:23] restore the original Pentecostal
[1:23:25] doctrine so I don't know what people
[1:23:28] crow I don't like that word I don't know
[1:23:30] what their current about saying we don't
[1:23:32] need doctrine I don't understand that
[1:23:34] they must have missed these quotes and
[1:23:36] we're just giving the benefit of doubt
[1:23:37] they must have missed the quote but what
[1:23:40] I have said in Messiah 1961 how was the
[1:23:45] book of Acts roast are reading it he
[1:23:49] says a light before the going out this
[1:23:51] open door that said before the church
[1:23:52] watch and see if it doesn't come some of
[1:23:54] these days God will send the Elijah just
[1:23:57] as certain I'm standing in this pulpit
[1:23:59] he will send and that Elijah will shake
[1:24:02] the people right back to the original
[1:24:05] Pentecostal doctrine
[1:24:07] I'd like to use one of you in as example
[1:24:09] but I'm not but I like to come over and
[1:24:11] shake somebody but the man said his
[1:24:13] ministry is to shake you to the original
[1:24:16] Picasso doctor a man to shake people so
[1:24:23] they'll kind of wake up a little bit
[1:24:24] from their slumber and realize I've been
[1:24:26] instructed to rock in the whole time I
[1:24:28] need to be instructed the way the
[1:24:30] Apostles instructed them amen the man
[1:24:34] said that came to shake his ministry
[1:24:35] came to shake you back to Pentecostal
[1:24:37] instruction oh yeah hey man I said like
[1:24:41] this God shake me again amen shake me
[1:24:44] sir I've been fooling with the doctrine
[1:24:45] every word of it every chapter every
[1:24:47] verse every line amen shake me enjoy the
[1:24:50] Pentecostal doctrine is in my heart and
[1:24:53] soul praise God
[1:24:54] hey man shake me up move change things
[1:24:58] in my right do what you must do until my
[1:25:00] doctor matches the Bible amen and many
[1:25:05] of us have experienced that
[1:25:06] how many lives how many of your lives
[1:25:08] have been shaken by hardships trials
[1:25:10] tests and shaking you to get right with
[1:25:12] the Word of God
[1:25:15] happens to me all the time brother Aaron
[1:25:19] I'm wrong on this I'm wrong Lynette
[1:25:21] God's got to shake me to get me back
[1:25:22] right but I love him for it that proves
[1:25:25] I'm one of his children if you can meet
[1:25:27] if you can't be corrected you're a
[1:25:29] bastard child but all those that he
[1:25:31] loves those he corrects and our doctrine
[1:25:36] cannot be proven wrong can't be debated
[1:25:40] in the Feast of the trumpets now I don't
[1:25:42] understand all these statements but I'm
[1:25:44] just gonna read the ones that I do and
[1:25:45] between the six trumpet and the seventh
[1:25:48] trumpet there's a prophet to appear
[1:25:50] before the Gentiles to call the people
[1:25:52] back to the original Pentecostal
[1:25:55] doctrine and the two witnesses of
[1:25:59] revelation 11 appear to the Jews to send
[1:26:02] them to Jesus while the church is being
[1:26:03] taken up all of them prophets amen
[1:26:06] the word Lord cannot be broken brother
[1:26:09] branham's ministry was calling us back
[1:26:11] to the original Pentecostal doctrine I
[1:26:17] have a few quotes where brother Branham
[1:26:20] connects the message to doctrine now
[1:26:26] before I read those let me go over that
[1:26:27] statement again I've heard it said the
[1:26:29] message is not a doctrine it's a person
[1:26:32] well it depends which quote you use in
[1:26:35] the rapture 1965 brother Branham said
[1:26:39] the message is the scriptures that God
[1:26:41] is presently fulfilling right now the
[1:26:45] message is the scriptures that God is
[1:26:47] fulfilling right now so in one sense the
[1:26:50] message is doctrine it's the doctrine as
[1:26:54] the teaching that God's doing right now
[1:26:56] is God telling us to go build a natural
[1:26:59] ark right now and float down the Nile
[1:27:02] like brother himself if Moses would have
[1:27:06] tried that it would have been out of
[1:27:07] season it's the dot so the message is
[1:27:11] the doctrine now you might say the
[1:27:13] message is the Holy Ghost inspired
[1:27:15] doctrine you might say that a member of
[1:27:19] brother
[1:27:20] is not the message because I said this
[1:27:21] before and program said it he said I may
[1:27:23] not do it but this message will forerun
[1:27:25] the second coming of Jesus Christ and he
[1:27:30] said this message will introduce Jesus
[1:27:32] Christ to the world the message
[1:27:36] introduces Jesus Christ the message
[1:27:39] introduces Jesus Christ the message
[1:27:44] introduces Jesus Christ so what is the
[1:27:47] message it's the word for this hour
[1:27:50] it's the instruction for this hour
[1:27:53] praise God I hope that's plain now I've
[1:28:01] gone I've gone to this this before and
[1:28:03] maybe you have you caught it before I
[1:28:05] hope you caught it before sometimes
[1:28:06] people make every quote brother Branham
[1:28:08] said they call it the message it's not
[1:28:11] he was a man when brother Branham
[1:28:15] preached the Bible that's the message
[1:28:17] when brother Branham said my daughter's
[1:28:19] going to take my place as a prophet that
[1:28:21] was not the message or when he said
[1:28:24] Billy Paul was my Joseph that was not
[1:28:27] the message okay are you with me church
[1:28:30] that's not the message the message is
[1:28:33] the Word of God that God's fulfilling
[1:28:36] today and that message introduces us to
[1:28:38] Jesus the Holy Ghost amen
[1:28:41] yes that's the right understanding so I
[1:28:45] would say the message is the scripture
[1:28:48] the the biblical doctrine that God is
[1:28:51] fulfilling right now and it points us to
[1:28:54] Jesus Christ can I can you give me a
[1:28:58] second let me pull that quote this
[1:29:00] message will introduces Jesus Christ to
[1:29:02] the world is that okay can somebody say
[1:29:05] Amen so I know I'm not wasting your time
[1:29:06] I think I heard - okay praise the Lord
[1:29:09] I just want everyone
[1:29:13] be fully assured of this here all right
[1:29:20] I know it's in the look away to Jesus
[1:29:23] yeah here it is program said I do
[1:29:27] believe that we're so close to the
[1:29:28] rapture that would never die was old age
[1:29:30] that's see every believer always think
[1:29:32] the rapture is gonna take place in their
[1:29:33] life
[1:29:34] he said yeah at 54 years old I'll never
[1:29:38] die with old age until he's here brother
[1:29:40] man thought it would be before he got
[1:29:42] old and died that that's because that's
[1:29:45] because that's you know you know why
[1:29:46] they feel that because Jesus is living
[1:29:48] inside of them and because he's inside
[1:29:50] of them I feel like he's gonna come I
[1:29:52] feel like he's gonna come the rest one's
[1:29:54] gonna come because a part of them is
[1:29:56] already here yeah that's why we feel
[1:29:59] like he's gonna come in all day because
[1:30:01] a part of him is already in us amen
[1:30:05] see unless I'm shot or killed or
[1:30:08] something another some way kill just old
[1:30:11] age won't kill me until he's come and I
[1:30:13] believe that now remember 2009 was one
[1:30:18] hundred year anniversary and I want to
[1:30:20] say this I've never said that before
[1:30:21] but according to Scripture according to
[1:30:23] what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago
[1:30:25] on the river down there in 1933 rather
[1:30:27] what he said everything has happened
[1:30:29] just exactly I may not do it but this
[1:30:32] message will introduce Jesus Christ to
[1:30:35] the world as John the Baptist was for
[1:30:38] one to send the the first coming so is
[1:30:41] the message to forerun the second coming
[1:30:44] and John said behold the lamb of God
[1:30:47] which takes away the sin the world see
[1:30:49] so it's it's paralleled in every way and
[1:30:51] I know it the message will go on and the
[1:30:54] message is going on in Bride of Christ
[1:30:56] fellowship amen how do think the message
[1:30:58] is going on today not jellyfish
[1:31:01] fellowship but Bride of Christ
[1:31:03] fellowship amen because you don't have a
[1:31:07] church unless you got doctrine and you
[1:31:09] don't have a preacher
[1:31:10] unless you got doctrine so that's
[1:31:11] paragraph 52 look away to Jesus was that
[1:31:15] helpful by God's grace I hope that helps
[1:31:18] somebody now here's the quotes about him
[1:31:20] he makes it sound like message and
[1:31:22] doctrine are one in the same trying to
[1:31:25] do God a service in 1965
[1:31:27] November 27th we have false
[1:31:30] impersonators rise up what's they to do
[1:31:33] to deceive the Bible said they would as
[1:31:35] generous and Jambres withstood Moses so
[1:31:38] will these in the last day see they do
[1:31:40] the same thing come right along
[1:31:41] impersonating it just exactly be careful
[1:31:44] watch the doctrine of the Bible how are
[1:31:48] you going to know Janus and RAM jammers
[1:31:50] you got to watch the doctrine of the
[1:31:52] Bible what's the message that follows
[1:31:57] those signs still the same old school
[1:32:01] message he said forget it so nervous no
[1:32:06] matter how many miracles the nominations
[1:32:07] have watch the doctrine behind it watch
[1:32:10] the message behind it and if it's the
[1:32:12] same old word same old Billy Graham or
[1:32:14] Roberts thing speaking tongues just be
[1:32:16] saved to live a good life if it's the
[1:32:18] same old thing forget about it
[1:32:20] look for someone who's got the message
[1:32:21] of the hour amen let's tell you not just
[1:32:25] live a good life or try to get rich and
[1:32:27] be prosperous all these things but the
[1:32:29] other thing is that the real message is
[1:32:31] get ready to meet him we're going in the
[1:32:33] rapture we're meeting him in the air
[1:32:35] ain't it that's different
[1:32:37] Billy Graham didn't preach that all
[1:32:39] robbers didn't preach that brother
[1:32:41] William man go and preach that and
[1:32:43] that's what we preach amen
[1:32:45] that's the message it's a different
[1:32:47] message it's not the same message as
[1:32:50] those brothers preached spiritual food
[1:32:54] and new season July 1865 but the Lord
[1:32:59] gave me what I should do in my message
[1:33:01] but then he said do the work of
[1:33:03] evangelist make full proof of your
[1:33:04] ministry for the hour arrive when they
[1:33:06] will not endure sound doctrine
[1:33:10] so that was brother Rams message was to
[1:33:12] preach the word to preach sound doctrine
[1:33:17] sister got here it just blows my mind
[1:33:20] sometimes people say we don't need
[1:33:21] doctor the message is doctrine because
[1:33:27] the his message was to preach sound
[1:33:29] doctrine apostolic doctrine Bible
[1:33:32] doctrine rapture doctrine Holy Ghost
[1:33:34] doctrine amen
[1:33:36] that's the message
[1:33:38] instructions on how to marry the right
[1:33:40] way right how to baptize the right way
[1:33:43] be filled with only ghosts how to use
[1:33:45] gifts how do all these things
[1:33:47] that's the message instructions on how
[1:33:49] to please God amen
[1:33:54] well Graham said if that hasn't come now
[1:33:56] what his commission has come to pass he
[1:33:58] says every church denomination has
[1:34:01] turned me down can you imagine I believe
[1:34:04] in not could turn down by a few churches
[1:34:06] he's turned on by every denomination
[1:34:09] they wouldn't endure sound doctrine so
[1:34:13] program says my message is sound
[1:34:15] doctrine but after their own lusts
[1:34:19] though bring their own teachers in and
[1:34:21] they'll be turning the fables and they
[1:34:22] will do great things that exploit like
[1:34:24] Janice and Jambres that would Sid Moses
[1:34:26] but their folly will be made manifest
[1:34:29] praise the Lord here's another one
[1:34:34] brother Branham is ordaining brother
[1:34:36] Capps as a preacher in 1965 it's April
[1:34:39] 18th
[1:34:39] he said that's bow our heads and pray
[1:34:41] for brother Cavs dear God the Temple
[1:34:44] Post has moved again and has seen the
[1:34:45] spirit of the quickening life working in
[1:34:47] our brother I pray God as he feels this
[1:34:49] from above that says that he must go we
[1:34:52] lay hands on him as your elders lord and
[1:34:54] give him the right hand of fellowship
[1:34:55] and lay our hands upon him and pass the
[1:34:57] blessings of God upon him that you'll
[1:34:59] anoint his lips his thinking his entire
[1:35:02] being and may take this message of the
[1:35:04] gospel to every crack and corner that's
[1:35:07] your calling to it
[1:35:08] granite Lord give it we give you our
[1:35:10] brother as a servant of yours in the
[1:35:12] name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:13] Frances amen he says preach the word my
[1:35:16] young brother be in season and out of
[1:35:18] season reprove rebuke with all on
[1:35:20] suffering and doctrine god bless you
[1:35:23] brother so brother Branham ordains
[1:35:25] preachers and tells them take the
[1:35:27] message and preach the right doctrine
[1:35:29] amen it's one the same doctrine and the
[1:35:33] message are one of the same true
[1:35:35] doctrine sound doctrine he says with all
[1:35:38] long-suffering and doctrine pray
[1:35:44] God all right let me read one more I got
[1:35:50] a couple more this is from 1965 this C
[1:35:58] does not air with a shock just about
[1:36:01] okay it's just about six months after
[1:36:03] that I had my first baptism down here on
[1:36:05] the river when the light came down in
[1:36:06] 1933 it's Spring Street many of you
[1:36:08] people what might want to go down and
[1:36:10] take a look at it at Spring Street in
[1:36:12] water right the riverfront and there's
[1:36:14] where the angel Lord appeared in public
[1:36:16] first and at two o'clock one afternoon
[1:36:18] and the voice came from it saying as
[1:36:20] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:36:21] first coming your message were forerun
[1:36:24] the second coming this is 30 years later
[1:36:26] and Here I am tonight still proclaiming
[1:36:28] that message and around the world it's
[1:36:31] went and I'm glad to be back in my
[1:36:32] hometown tonight to represent this Lord
[1:36:35] Jesus Christ that I still love with all
[1:36:37] my heart
[1:36:38] each day he grows sweeter than he was
[1:36:41] the day before does anybody else have
[1:36:43] that testimony here tonight
[1:36:44] does Jesus grow sweeter each day than he
[1:36:47] was the day before oh that's beautiful
[1:36:51] he's 60s 56 years old he said each day
[1:36:54] Jesus gets sweeter than he was yesterday
[1:36:56] I can say amen to that I read Psalms 22
[1:36:58] this morning I cried like a baby in my
[1:37:00] prayer closet Jesus said I'm a worm I'm
[1:37:03] not even a man he said all my bones they
[1:37:07] stare at me I thought oh God if Jesus
[1:37:11] was a worm what am i and I was getting
[1:37:13] out of my car at work and I saw a little
[1:37:14] worm there I thought man that's me I'm
[1:37:17] lower than that because Jesus said I
[1:37:19] have no I'm not a man I'm a worm because
[1:37:23] all the sin was placed upon him his
[1:37:25] bones severed him so he's on the cross
[1:37:27] and he can see his bones and they're
[1:37:29] staring at him ripped to shreds why'd he
[1:37:32] do it he did it to love you and I he did
[1:37:35] it to save you and I and I go my prayer
[1:37:39] closet I could hardly I just got to
[1:37:40] cover my face because of God's holy
[1:37:42] presence because how great and how
[1:37:44] loving is Who am I I'm nothing who is
[1:37:47] Jesus Christ he's God amen hallelujah
[1:37:50] the god of this message
[1:37:52] i'li the god of this holy ghost'
[1:37:55] doctrine that we preach amen
[1:37:58] each day he grows sweeter than he was
[1:38:00] the day before I've never changed one
[1:38:02] iota in my doctrine he said I preached
[1:38:06] the same message since 1933 I've never
[1:38:09] changed one iota in my doctrine the
[1:38:15] first thing I started with I still
[1:38:17] believe the same thing tonight he's the
[1:38:20] same yesterday today and forever and I
[1:38:22] can say amen to that I started preaching
[1:38:23] in 2004 I haven't changed one iota my
[1:38:26] doctrine I still preach the same thing
[1:38:28] brother Branham preached there might be
[1:38:30] some little miners there I'm working on
[1:38:31] and trying to understand the Feast of
[1:38:33] the trumpets and all these things like
[1:38:34] that but I've kept the faith with all
[1:38:37] the major doctrines why because there's
[1:38:39] only one doctrine amen that's the
[1:38:41] doctrine of the Bible and we don't
[1:38:43] change it one iota that's right he's the
[1:38:48] same yesterday today and forever now I
[1:38:50] have a message that I'm responsible for
[1:38:56] amen
[1:38:57] okay so I have a whole lot of Scripture
[1:39:04] but I'm gonna try to bring this down too
[1:39:06] close here here let me read a few more
[1:39:14] the indictment 1963 remember I said that
[1:39:16] on Sunday what were the preachers
[1:39:17] indicted for their false doctrine
[1:39:22] program said and today I indict this
[1:39:25] bunch of ordained ministers in their
[1:39:27] Creed's and denominations they are
[1:39:29] crucifying to the people the very God
[1:39:32] that they claim they love and serve
[1:39:35] crucifying Jesus Christ afresh the
[1:39:38] ministers I indict these ministers in
[1:39:42] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ upon
[1:39:44] their doctrine remember indictment is a
[1:39:49] true accusation it's a proven accusation
[1:39:53] so preachers can be proven to be wrong
[1:39:56] rightly accused because of what what
[1:40:00] they taught about the Bible what they
[1:40:02] instructed the people to do that's why I
[1:40:04] say don't put TV in your home you better
[1:40:08] not
[1:40:08] that's an instruct
[1:40:10] setting a wicked thing before your eyes
[1:40:12] if you got a smartphone you better not
[1:40:14] put evil things in front of your eyes or
[1:40:15] else it's time to get rid of that thing
[1:40:17] it's become an evil thing to you praise
[1:40:20] the Lord
[1:40:20] that's instruction don't you do it
[1:40:22] you'll never be born again and taking
[1:40:23] all the trash out of your house amen now
[1:40:31] I can say a few things here maybe I
[1:40:32] think I will their parent says usually
[1:40:34] when that happened that's God telling me
[1:40:36] to do it but recently that we've seen
[1:40:39] some people fall away from the message
[1:40:41] I've seen some people personal friends
[1:40:44] and things like that fall away from the
[1:40:45] message and come to find out years later
[1:40:47] after he's all the all these years it
[1:40:49] looks like they've been sincere I come
[1:40:50] to find out after all these years
[1:40:52] certain people in the family would let
[1:40:55] TV and movies filthy movies into their
[1:40:57] home and watch him on the weekends and
[1:41:01] then after all these years fall the way
[1:41:04] I'm talking just like Lion King or
[1:41:09] Disney movies which are filthy anyway
[1:41:12] and the church said okay good praise the
[1:41:15] Lord don't bring Disney in your home
[1:41:18] right I'm talking about
[1:41:23] and one particular and that the reason
[1:41:24] I'm saying this is because I've talked
[1:41:26] to the person about it and they repented
[1:41:27] of it after I preached on it so I know
[1:41:29] what I'm talking about
[1:41:30] I'm talking about the movie Titanic
[1:41:32] where they a woman strips down and she's
[1:41:35] completely naked on the camera there and
[1:41:36] men and women and women and men making
[1:41:38] love and all kinds of what is that
[1:41:40] that's adultery
[1:41:41] that's seeds of hell that's seeds of sin
[1:41:45] and yet claiming to be in the message
[1:41:47] for all these years and then we come to
[1:41:49] find out recently they fall away for the
[1:41:51] message and this whole time demons have
[1:41:55] been living in their homes and for so
[1:41:58] many years brother bill they could they
[1:42:00] had brother Bruce so for so many years
[1:42:02] they could pretend to be so
[1:42:03] sanctimonious they could even shout and
[1:42:05] scream and cry brother William for so
[1:42:09] many years you thought oh these people
[1:42:10] are the examples of the church come to
[1:42:14] find out demons have been dwelling in
[1:42:17] their home all these years well no
[1:42:19] wonder they can go and take off their
[1:42:21] skirts and put on short shorts no wonder
[1:42:23] they
[1:42:23] knew that because demons have been
[1:42:25] laying their trash has been rotting in
[1:42:28] their hole for decades and they didn't
[1:42:30] do nothing about it what we need is a
[1:42:32] clean outhouse
[1:42:33] that's unleavened with saying Amen
[1:42:35] that's the only way the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:38] going to get into your home if it's it
[1:42:40] all cleaned out people can act pious
[1:42:43] it's like the Pharisees and said I
[1:42:44] believe the message I believe the
[1:42:46] message the only way you believe the
[1:42:47] message is if you believe in the
[1:42:49] doctrine of the Scriptures amen and you
[1:42:52] don't take any sin you don't win
[1:42:54] anything come in your home but you live
[1:42:56] godly righteous and holy and the
[1:42:58] doctrine you become part of the doctrine
[1:43:00] amen the doctrine lives in you praise
[1:43:02] God amen and I know that from personal
[1:43:07] experience from talking to people on the
[1:43:09] phone at the altar about coming up for
[1:43:12] prayer I know exactly what I'm talking
[1:43:14] about
[1:43:16] so if you let dirty shows come in
[1:43:18] shame on you you're not gonna be born
[1:43:20] again that's called instruction get the
[1:43:25] trash get all the trash out of the house
[1:43:27] you got sexy clothes to own your home
[1:43:29] sisters get it out Wright brothers took
[1:43:33] out those old dirty magazines old videos
[1:43:35] you like of simple things old dirty
[1:43:37] music get that out of your home you'll
[1:43:40] never move on with God until
[1:43:42] everything's out that's the instruction
[1:43:44] of the message of the hour and the
[1:43:47] church said that's the Bible unleavened
[1:43:50] feast there can be no leaven in the home
[1:43:57] so I
[1:43:59] just thought I hope that was a help to
[1:44:00] somebody hope that just just trying to
[1:44:03] just try to let you know the reality of
[1:44:04] it you can you can fool people for
[1:44:06] decades but pretty soon by their fruits
[1:44:08] you'll know them and like I preached
[1:44:12] here a while ago if people like and I
[1:44:14] preached it right to that person's face
[1:44:15] I just felt letting the Holy Spirit's
[1:44:17] one of those times I just felt like John
[1:44:19] the Baptist growing up right under
[1:44:20] prophets Herod's face and say you're the
[1:44:22] man because this person told me about it
[1:44:25] right before the sermon that they're
[1:44:27] watching the Titanic and all these sexy
[1:44:28] movies like that and I felt that
[1:44:31] righteous signa nation look I'm gonna
[1:44:32] preach it anyway I don't care what they
[1:44:34] say I don't care who they are this is
[1:44:36] God's Word we're talking about here this
[1:44:38] is the message I walked right up in
[1:44:42] their face and preached it I said if you
[1:44:44] watch dirty movies the sex on them and
[1:44:46] all these things like that you're
[1:44:47] probably not even saved I said because
[1:44:51] lot was saved but when he looked at this
[1:44:54] homosexuality the Bible said it grieved
[1:44:56] him and yet these people that say they
[1:44:58] believe the message they watch sex
[1:45:00] scenes and it don't even grieve them
[1:45:01] they're probably not even saved and yet
[1:45:06] acting like they're saved acting like
[1:45:08] their leaders acting like their there's
[1:45:09] somebody to look up to nonsense
[1:45:17] righteousness holiness godliness a love
[1:45:21] for purity a love for sanctification a
[1:45:24] love for clean out the house a love for
[1:45:26] an unloving home that's what we need
[1:45:29] today jesus said he that loves me is he
[1:45:31] that keeps my commands amen glory and I
[1:45:36] know I hop on that a lot but I got to
[1:45:37] I'm trying to cheat I'm trying to keep
[1:45:39] the church clean I'm trying to keep my
[1:45:42] life clean I'm trying to take heed to
[1:45:44] myself that you and I both be saved and
[1:45:54] I did that one time I family you know
[1:45:56] some other family was at a service this
[1:45:57] was different service and I knew my
[1:46:00] family walked in there with makeup on
[1:46:01] their face sister Naomi sometimes it's
[1:46:05] hard to be a preacher and I knew it and
[1:46:08] sometimes it's hard to when you're
[1:46:10] family sitting right there and the Holy
[1:46:12] Spirit puts on my heart to ball out
[1:46:14] their makeup and I'm back there in the
[1:46:17] office studying Lord are you sure my
[1:46:24] family's out there with the message or
[1:46:26] I'm sorry my family's out there with
[1:46:28] makeup on and short skirts sure you want
[1:46:31] me to preach this but about the time I
[1:46:33] get the call out start tapping the foot
[1:46:39] pretty soon to get under the anointing I
[1:46:41] don't fear anybody after that I got a
[1:46:45] wrestle it out in there and I've said it
[1:46:48] to it's a Jezebel spirit to wear makeup
[1:46:50] it shows there something false on the
[1:46:52] inside it's a false face it's not even
[1:46:58] real I just stand there and spit in the
[1:47:02] family
[1:47:02] and pretty soon part of it after the
[1:47:05] servers that come up and my brother or
[1:47:07] the different ones the families took my
[1:47:08] hand and they say everything you said
[1:47:11] was absolutely the truth I said
[1:47:13] hallelujah now do they change their ways
[1:47:16] you bet they didn't but they couldn't
[1:47:20] argue they couldn't argue with this
[1:47:24] doctrine amen because you can't argue
[1:47:26] with it I preached on tattoos and my
[1:47:31] family members got a tattoo he said
[1:47:33] you're right Jesse I'm wrong and that
[1:47:35] the the the other children are telling
[1:47:37] them see dad you should not I got a
[1:47:38] tattoo a tattoo is a sin in the mouths
[1:47:40] of babes thou has perfected praise Amen
[1:47:45] God give us a backbone amen honey what a
[1:47:48] backbone for Christ let me try to close
[1:47:50] this magis I love the Lord amen
[1:47:52] I know you do too or else you wouldn't
[1:47:54] be here let me close
[1:48:05] the only way you would know Jesus's
[1:48:08] first coming was by doctrine because
[1:48:14] there was no specific portion in the
[1:48:17] Bible in the Old Testament that had all
[1:48:19] the details the details were not just
[1:48:22] all in one book the details were
[1:48:23] scattered all over you had some details
[1:48:26] in Malachi you had some in Genesis you
[1:48:30] had some in Habakkuk right yet some in
[1:48:33] Haggai Zechariah Isaiah the Deuteronomy
[1:48:38] you have all these details the only way
[1:48:40] you would have been recognized Christ
[1:48:43] coming was to take all those scriptures
[1:48:45] and putting together and a doctrine and
[1:48:47] teach and be able to say he's front he
[1:48:49] was born in Bethlehem right he's born of
[1:48:53] a virgin Isiah and put all the other put
[1:48:55] all of them together and have a doctrine
[1:48:57] have instruction and then you would know
[1:48:59] this is the very Christ and the same
[1:49:02] things true in his second coming you got
[1:49:06] to put 1st Thessalonians 4 together with
[1:49:08] 1st Corinthians 15 you got to put that
[1:49:11] together with Malachi 4 or 5 and 6
[1:49:13] Elisha coming before the end of the
[1:49:14] world you got to put it together with
[1:49:16] Revelation 10 7 even brother branham's
[1:49:18] ministry you have to have a doctrine on
[1:49:20] it you have to show instruction how
[1:49:22] Jesus said Elisha truly shall come first
[1:49:25] and restore all things it takes doctrine
[1:49:29] it's not just one scripture where you oh
[1:49:31] now I can prove with the random this is
[1:49:33] brother as ministry know well I can
[1:49:35] prove the rapture because I don't one
[1:49:36] scripture no you need a doctor and you
[1:49:37] need instruction from all parts of the
[1:49:39] Bible that all line up and you can say
[1:49:42] this is the true teaching this all
[1:49:44] proves this instructs us to know Jesus
[1:49:46] Christ's second coming praise the Lord
[1:49:56] now I'm turn to Matthew 13 I got a
[1:49:58] couple more things to say
[1:50:10] and you can better believe I'm going to
[1:50:12] that meeting there with the sisters and
[1:50:13] I'm ready to ball out some sin there -
[1:50:15] by God's grace on a first take heat of
[1:50:17] myself to make sure my heart's right but
[1:50:20] I know one thing if people are cold and
[1:50:23] lukewarm and on fire we it's pretty
[1:50:25] simple according to our doctrine it's
[1:50:27] pretty a simple Accord on instruction
[1:50:28] what's going on sin sin has got into the
[1:50:32] house sin something dead has come into a
[1:50:36] house that's why people get lukewarm get
[1:50:39] cold on God backslide
[1:50:41] sin some death some trash has been
[1:50:45] allowed to come into their house and
[1:50:46] they didn't get rid of it don't you just
[1:50:50] love the simplicity of the gospel it's
[1:50:52] so simple okay it's just so simple God
[1:50:55] makes it so simple so we don't miss it
[1:51:00] now Matthew 13 this thought just came to
[1:51:05] me I've been writing in my free time
[1:51:07] I've been writing a text for another
[1:51:10] book about the twelve Bible mysteries
[1:51:12] that program talked about and serves us
[1:51:14] at the end time but I believe it's the
[1:51:17] yeah it's the sixth yes the sixth the
[1:51:23] six mystery in Matthew 13 45 remember
[1:51:27] there's a Sevenfold mystery of the
[1:51:28] kingdom of God and that Sevenfold
[1:51:30] mystery reveals all the truths of
[1:51:33] revelations about the kingdom of heaven
[1:51:35] the sixth one is the pearl-grey price
[1:51:38] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[1:51:39] a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who
[1:51:43] when he had found one pearl great price
[1:51:45] went and sold all that he had and bought
[1:51:48] it so this parable speaks of seeking so
[1:51:56] he was seeking many goodly pearls see
[1:51:58] that he was seeking many things he was
[1:52:01] seeking all these different things but
[1:52:02] when he found the one pearl of great
[1:52:04] price
[1:52:04] he stopped seeking all that and he saw
[1:52:07] the one pearl of great price see with
[1:52:11] doctrine with doctor we've got to seek
[1:52:13] one thing we've got to seek what does
[1:52:15] God want for us what is God instructing
[1:52:18] for us right now we're so tempted
[1:52:21] because Google is like a search engine
[1:52:22] and everything we want to find out go to
[1:52:25] Google go to Google go to Google but God
[1:52:28] saying you got to stop searching for
[1:52:29] other pearls and you got to find the one
[1:52:31] pro great price and seek after that if
[1:52:35] my life is there's questions about my
[1:52:37] life there's questions about this
[1:52:38] questions about that we've got to stop
[1:52:40] seeking for other pearls and we got to
[1:52:42] find the one pearl of great price the
[1:52:44] instruction of God's word amen see the
[1:52:49] six parable is about what you search for
[1:52:52] the fifth parable is about possessions
[1:52:55] he went and sold all his possessions to
[1:52:58] get that treasure in the field so the
[1:53:01] sixth one is about what are we searching
[1:53:02] for and this is the age of the search
[1:53:04] engines of Google Google and Bing and
[1:53:06] all these other ones that you search for
[1:53:08] this is the age of searching goodly
[1:53:10] things searching all these things but
[1:53:12] we've got to search God's word for the
[1:53:14] instruction for this day instruction
[1:53:19] search for God what am I supposed to
[1:53:21] what do I do next
[1:53:23] I've done this this this what do I do
[1:53:24] next search for the instruction it's
[1:53:27] right here in the Word of God here's my
[1:53:32] last quote I hope you like it I wonder
[1:53:35] if you've been waiting for this quote
[1:53:37] you'll find I guess we'll find out after
[1:53:39] this we'll see who shouts amen the
[1:53:41] loudest in 1961 brother Epson you must
[1:53:44] be born again but man said this now I
[1:53:47] thought it'd be a good idea maybe that I
[1:53:49] would lay aside my New Year's message
[1:53:51] until tonight so he's preaching on New
[1:53:53] Year's Eve the morning and go back in
[1:53:57] some Sunday school scriptures and take a
[1:53:59] text and talk for a while on one of the
[1:54:02] most vital subjects that I know
[1:54:08] it's a doctrine that our Lord first
[1:54:12] preached oh thank you Jesus amen
[1:54:18] who knows Jesus's first doctrine that he
[1:54:22] ever preached
[1:54:24] does anybody know Jesus first doctrine
[1:54:26] just say it out loud anybody not well I
[1:54:30] stumped the class tonight I did think I
[1:54:34] can do that i stumped the class but read
[1:54:40] said one of the I'm going to preach on
[1:54:42] one of the most vital subjects that I
[1:54:43] know of in the Bible it's a doctrine
[1:54:45] that our Lord first preached the first
[1:54:47] doctrine that Jesus Christ ever preached
[1:54:50] who knows what it is do you know now
[1:54:57] I like how you're trying sorry but no
[1:55:00] that's not it I appreciate the effort he
[1:55:04] said now God bless his word and I want
[1:55:06] to take the subject this morning on
[1:55:08] Jesus Christ first doctrine what would
[1:55:11] be the first thing Jesus Christ would
[1:55:13] ever preach for instruction city and
[1:55:20] sister you must be born again
[1:55:25] but have said the first doctrine of
[1:55:28] Jesus was you must be born again that
[1:55:32] was his first doctrine Jesus let's send
[1:55:38] our feet amen
[1:55:39] the first doctrine ever preached by God
[1:55:43] himself in flesh was you must be born
[1:55:47] again and appreciate to a Sanhedrin
[1:55:49] preacher named Nicodemus and he still
[1:55:53] don't understand it now how am I gonna
[1:55:55] go back in my mom's belly let's see
[1:55:59] maybe that skin stretch is really big
[1:56:01] I'm not sure maybe there's a way to
[1:56:04] stretch I don't know
[1:56:05] and Jesus like are you are you serious
[1:56:09] you're a master in Israel and you think
[1:56:10] you're gonna enter into your ma your
[1:56:11] mother's womb again so what is
[1:56:17] have to give him instruction he says
[1:56:21] verily I say unto you except ye repent
[1:56:23] which kind of goes along with it you
[1:56:25] must be born to get so that's the first
[1:56:28] instruction Jesus doctor you must repent
[1:56:32] amen
[1:56:33] we must repent say we're alone turn from
[1:56:37] our evil ways not seek to be involved in
[1:56:41] the things of the world but turn from
[1:56:42] the things of the world and be fully
[1:56:44] involved in the things of Christ you
[1:56:46] must be born again
[1:56:48] his first doctrine and church let me say
[1:56:51] this if you haven't caught it yet
[1:56:53] without Jesus first doctrine you're not
[1:56:57] going in the rapture but with Jesus
[1:56:59] first right with his first doctrine if
[1:57:01] you receive Jesus first doctor you've
[1:57:04] got a ticket to the rapture we're not
[1:57:08] going in the rapture without doctrine
[1:57:11] and people are saying well we don't need
[1:57:14] all the doctrine the message is not a
[1:57:16] doctrine oh you're not getting in the
[1:57:19] rapture without the doctrine of Christ
[1:57:22] is that right Church I guess I just got
[1:57:26] a little bit uh was it wrath and
[1:57:30] indignation about that because I love
[1:57:33] doctrine there's nothing I love more
[1:57:35] than the doctrine of Jesus Christ
[1:57:38] because it's instruction for me to the
[1:57:41] way of life instruction leads to life
[1:57:45] and what is life the Holy Ghost high
[1:57:48] powers we already read in Proverbs keep
[1:57:51] instruction and you'll go in the way of
[1:57:53] the Holy Ghost life amen
[1:57:57] Oh hallelujah I felt the anointing all
[1:57:59] week this week hallelujah
[1:58:02] I knew this is the Word of God this is
[1:58:04] the truth we need God's doctrine
[1:58:06] brother bearers brought us back to the
[1:58:08] Pentecostal doctrine and without that
[1:58:11] doctrine we are not going in the rapture
[1:58:13] how many thank the Lord for that let's
[1:58:16] give the Lord balls a little Bramson is
[1:58:24] one of the most vital subjects is the
[1:58:26] baptism of the holy ghost that's the
[1:58:29] ticket to be a part of his wife
[1:58:31] be born again not be born to the flesh
[1:58:35] and water again but be born of the Holy
[1:58:37] Ghost
[1:58:38] I hope this sermon has been a help I
[1:58:42] hope you see this is doctrine that's
[1:58:44] saved God's doctrine is doctrine that
[1:58:46] saves you fills you and ultimately
[1:58:49] raptures you okay now church there's
[1:58:56] about a thousand quotes on doctrine I
[1:58:58] didn't get I didn't even scratch the
[1:58:59] surface of it I just tried to limit it
[1:59:02] because there's so many I tried message
[1:59:05] doctrine or apostolic dr. and all these
[1:59:08] things like that my message but I hope I
[1:59:12] hope everybody can see if you can see
[1:59:14] that we need doctrine can you give me a
[1:59:16] Amen praise the Lord
[1:59:19] and I'm not speaking evil of anybody
[1:59:21] here tonight but I'm giving warnings
[1:59:23] especially those that would say evil
[1:59:24] things against God's doctrine and I
[1:59:27] think it's just a misunderstanding
[1:59:28] kind of like that summer we preached on
[1:59:30] the jeffersonville right sweet people
[1:59:36] but our doctrine only comes from this
[1:59:39] word of God and then the true test of it
[1:59:43] for right is if we love everybody anyway
[1:59:46] right program said I'd rather have the
[1:59:49] right spirit than the right doctrine but
[1:59:50] guess what we can have both Paul had
[1:59:53] both I've heard people say the whole
[1:59:55] time they say well I'd rather have the
[1:59:57] right sphere than the right doctor
[1:59:58] making it sound like they don't even
[1:59:59] know the right doctrine Church we know
[2:00:01] the right doctrine we got to have the
[2:00:03] right spirit to the right spirit and the
[2:00:08] right doctrine and if you've got the
[2:00:10] Holy Ghost you will have both because
[2:00:12] the Holy Ghost leads you into all truth
[2:00:16] you can't say well I got the Holy Ghost
[2:00:18] but I don't quite understand doctrine
[2:00:19] you can't say that because the Holy
[2:00:22] Ghost guides you to the right doctrine I
[2:00:25] hope everybody can see it so they could
[2:00:27] everybody see it tonight I've tried to
[2:00:29] just be real plain I just tried to be
[2:00:32] real straight with you I hope you can
[2:00:34] see the importance of doctrine by the
[2:00:36] grace of God I wonder how many times I
[2:00:40] said that word in this sermon doctrine
[2:00:43] but my prayers that it was no matter how
[2:00:45] many times I said it that it was written
[2:00:47] upon your hearts that the doctor yet you
[2:00:50] follow the doctrine of the Apostles
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:59] forgive me I got one more scripture see
[2:01:04] I'm a pastor I can do that second John 9
[2:01:09] and 11 bear with me
[2:01:14] he pulled up their second John 9 11 9 10
[2:01:19] 11 whosoever transgresseth and abideth
[2:01:22] not in the doctrine of Christ hath not
[2:01:24] God you don't even have God unless you
[2:01:28] have the right doctrine he that abideth
[2:01:32] in the doctrine of Christ he hath both
[2:01:33] the father and the son you can't have
[2:01:38] Christ you can't have the father without
[2:01:39] the right doctrine if there come any of
[2:01:44] you and bring not this doctrine receive
[2:01:47] him not in your house what about all
[2:01:49] that love I rather have the right love
[2:01:51] right spirit the right doctrine what
[2:01:53] about all that love see it's got to be
[2:01:54] balanced out we got to balance out all
[2:01:56] these quotes because this scripture says
[2:01:58] if you don't have the right doctrine
[2:01:59] don't even let him in your house
[2:02:00] somebody keeps preaching that returned
[2:02:03] ministry stuff or whatever whatever they
[2:02:04] preach two souls or whatever they preach
[2:02:06] don't even let them in your house and
[2:02:09] look you can say I've got the right
[2:02:11] spirit because the Bible says so I love
[2:02:14] them but you're not coming to my house
[2:02:15] if you're trying to promote false
[2:02:17] doctrine you're trying to bring Devils
[2:02:18] into my house I love you I've got the
[2:02:22] right spirit neither bid him Godspeed
[2:02:27] for he that biddeth him God speed is the
[2:02:30] partaker of his evil deeds
[2:02:34] [Music]

[2:02:42] for the original doctrine by God's grace
