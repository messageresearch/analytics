[36:11] love of God praise the Lord so thank the
[36:13] Lord for that hallelujah let's go to

[38:29] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[38:34] reasonable service and be not conformed
[38:37] to this world but be transformed by the
[38:41] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[38:44] what is that good and acceptable and
[38:47] perfect will of God amen let's have a
[38:49] word of Prayer if you have a need on
[38:50] your heart just make it known unto God
[38:52] here have any father Lord we so
[38:54] as we said Laura so many encouraging
[38:56] things this week Lord were happy to see
[38:58] the love of God moving in people's lives
[39:00] even those we disagree with Laura can
[39:02] recognize us as Christians and love and
[39:05] we thank your father thank you for the
[39:06] great life changing you're doing in my
[39:08] cousin's life Lord and continue to mold
[39:11] and shape our lives Lord God may we go
[39:13] from glory to glory then we go from
[39:15] faith to faith from revelation to
[39:17] revelation from victory to victory from
[39:20] footstep to footstep Lord God help us
[39:22] here tonight Lord God we're gathered in
[39:24] your holy name Jesus and we ask you to
[39:26] anoint us for your glory teach us Lord
[39:28] strengthen us help us to understand Lord
[39:31] most of all let us be changed Lord to be
[39:34] more like you father God for your
[39:36] prophet Paul said Lord the thing that
[39:38] avails is a new creature in Christ Jesus
[39:40] something that will prevail is Lord a
[39:43] person that's new
[39:45] a person who is refresh in the presence
[39:48] of God quick to obey and becomes a new
[39:50] creature so help us Lord tonight we love
[39:53] you Lord bless those that are physically
[39:54] gathered here thank you for their
[39:55] sacrifice to come out to the house of
[39:57] God and bless those livestreaming that
[39:59] are hungry and thirsting for your word
[40:00] in Jesus Christ's name
[40:02] that's her said amen god bless you me
[40:04] and see the praise god
[40:12] all right so lord we
[40:14] like to look at a few verses here and I
[40:18] want like I said I want to spend a lot
[40:19] of my time building up to marriage yeah
[40:22] you get switch over there thank you hon
[40:25] remember on Sunday morning we're looking
[40:27] at four of these things I thought were
[40:29] really inspired Paul says don't be drunk
[40:33] on wine but be filled with the spirit
[40:35] and the four things he mentioned are
[40:38] really easy things to do right as far as
[40:40] it's not a very hard list now it's more
[40:44] challenging to our flesh right but these
[40:47] things should be pretty easy we should
[40:49] be singing together in our homes right
[40:53] and in our churches we should be singing
[40:56] alone amen
[40:57] we should be making a joy the Bible said
[40:59] making a joyful noise a melody in your
[41:01] heart to the Lord and then we'll look
[41:05] out here just a moment verse 20 give
[41:07] thanks again it's interesting that he
[41:10] says it again and then Lord willing
[41:12] tonight we'll look at this elevating
[41:14] others that's a hard thing to do for a
[41:17] lot of people it's humility so we'll
[41:22] look at that
[41:22] Lord willing there's a lot to be said
[41:24] about that in scripture the Bible acts
[41:26] use the word submission so submit
[41:28] submission and submission is like you
[41:31] humbling yourself and it elevates others
[41:33] there's 40 scriptures in the New
[41:34] Testament but talk about submitting
[41:36] ourselves to other people so we won't
[41:38] look at a few of those tonight by the
[41:41] grace of God now who knows what a
[41:43] brother am say what is the way up how do
[41:45] you go up higher in God does anybody
[41:46] know go down right the way up is down
[41:51] right so if we want to get how many want
[41:54] to be closer to God so the way up is to
[41:57] go down and humble yourself when you
[42:00] exalt others as far as not worship them
[42:03] but when you when you place their needs
[42:06] above yours and when you encourage
[42:08] others say good things about others and
[42:12] humble yourself or find a way to serve
[42:14] other people that actually gets you
[42:16] closer to God's heart amen and so we
[42:19] will look at that tonight by God's grace
[42:21] just briefly there's a numerous
[42:23] scriptures when look at but let's if you
[42:25] got your Bibles let's go to Ephesians 5
[42:27] verse 20 hopefully this week you've
[42:33] enjoyed that singing and felt the
[42:35] anointing in your life and your home you
[42:37] know and your work I have to you know
[42:40] singing together singing alone
[42:41] worshiping the Lord together just
[42:44] walking around the house or doing chores
[42:45] singing to the Lord and your heart it's
[42:48] a great victory Paul says that's a sign
[42:51] of walking in the spirit
[42:53] now of course we know church that's the
[42:55] anointing in the human spirit and that's
[42:57] the anointing we need all the time amen
[42:59] if you're born again you have that
[43:01] anointing drilling in your soul your
[43:02] nature it's changed you have life you
[43:06] have a living nature it's a little
[43:09] sating from your soul your will your
[43:12] desire is to do the will of God but we
[43:14] need the anointing to refresh our minds
[43:18] and that's how we do it we sing together
[43:19] we sing by ourselves
[43:21] and now in verse 20 he says giving
[43:25] thanks always for all things unto God
[43:28] and the father in the name of our Lord
[43:32] Jesus Christ now I think it's beautiful
[43:35] there where the Bible says giving thanks
[43:38] and everything did you notice earlier in
[43:41] the chapter and verse 4 we preached on
[43:43] this last week I believe last Wednesday
[43:45] it says neither filthiness nor foolish
[43:48] talking nor jesting which are not
[43:50] convenient but rather giving of thanks
[43:53] so twice in the same chapter within the
[43:57] same the same sort of thoughts
[43:59] Paul saying give thanks he says don't
[44:02] joke around
[44:03] don't say filthy things it's never
[44:06] convenience never good to say things
[44:08] like that he says give thanks and then
[44:10] he goes through how you need to be wise
[44:12] redeem the time we're walking the light
[44:15] redeemed the time they says give thanks
[44:17] he said what singing the spirit be
[44:19] thankful or not yes seeing spirit they
[44:21] says be thankful and everything amen
[44:23] what a way to just emphasize be thankful
[44:27] have you had any hard times this week so
[44:29] far if you have we can say thank you
[44:31] Lord for the hard times right
[44:33] he said give thanks and everything have
[44:36] you had any difficult interactions with
[44:39] friends or difficult text message
[44:41] have you seen anything that's kind of
[44:43] discouraged you maybe about the
[44:44] coronavirus the news about that if we've
[44:47] seen anything about that we should give
[44:49] thanks and say somehow God is going to
[44:51] be glorified in this remember there's a
[44:53] list I read you on Sunday after so every
[44:55] two year three years or some virus that
[44:57] goes through Ebola Zika you name it
[45:00] slime flu every couple of years we
[45:01] there's there's another virus but thank
[45:04] God every every year there's the blood
[45:06] of Jesus Christ amen
[45:07] there's healing praise God there's a
[45:09] mercy you know and and I just saw a
[45:12] Facebook post today just I was on a few
[45:15] seconds but it said in the time you can
[45:17] read a Facebook post you know maybe one
[45:20] coronavirus person has died but in that
[45:22] same time how many abortions took place
[45:24] how many people died from the flu how
[45:27] many people were killed in car accidents
[45:28] so we got a red take these things in the
[45:30] perspective and pray for mercy for all
[45:33] people praise God pray for mercy ask God
[45:36] to give us grace and wisdom and
[45:38] protection protect our loved ones and
[45:40] protect our nation protect our our
[45:43] people protect our families you know we
[45:45] should be constantly praying but in
[45:47] everything give thanks for this is the
[45:49] will of God in Christ Jesus so twice our
[45:54] mouths are made to give thanks praise
[45:58] God remember we read that quote on
[46:00] Sunday where brother BAM said he told
[46:02] the person battling with nervousness and
[46:04] anxiety put a smile on your face
[46:07] he said don't let a frown come upon your
[46:10] face give thanks and the Holy Spirit
[46:13] will give you a victory over that spirit
[46:15] amen uh-huh what a blessing amen and
[46:18] this week I've been careful to smile
[46:20] more Irishmen smiling at the kids more
[46:22] at school I've been smiling more at
[46:24] adults you know I'm just trying to put
[46:26] on a smile even when I don't feel like
[46:27] it I just kind of felt it I've got to
[46:31] keep that frown off I got to keep the
[46:32] anger and the worry and the fear we've
[46:35] got to just keep that off and choose to
[46:37] be thankful because that's what pleases
[46:39] the Lord amen he said is the will of God
[46:43] so we want to walk in the spirit we got
[46:46] to sing we got to be with the Saints we
[46:48] got to sing with the Saints and we got
[46:49] to give thanks and this is a sign of the
[46:54] anointing
[46:54] in the human spirit praise God now the
[46:58] word thanks means expressing gratitude
[47:00] and always this is why you know I'm not
[47:03] on Facebook very much because a lot of
[47:05] times on Facebook it's a good and bad
[47:07] you know you get good to get bad but I
[47:09] try at least on my page and my wife I
[47:11] know we always try to just be happy
[47:13] about things so just talk about good
[47:14] things I've never yet done one political
[47:17] post to make anybody look bad I don't
[47:20] plan starting anytime soon because the
[47:23] Bible says we should give thanks in all
[47:24] things you notice a lot of my facebook
[47:27] posts start with thankful to Lord for
[47:29] this I'm thankful for the Lord to that I
[47:31] don't want to say anything negative if I
[47:33] have something negative I need to go
[47:34] talk to that person or talk to the Lord
[47:36] about it praise God
[47:38] now there's times course we got to
[47:40] preach on sin but here the Bible tells
[47:42] us give thanks and everything give
[47:44] thanks not some things but in all things
[47:47] and then give the thanks unto God and
[47:52] the father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:55] that's all that's what I taught the kids
[47:56] at school I said if you do an Instagram
[47:58] post or if you do a Facebook post can
[48:00] you poke can you post that in the name
[48:02] of Jesus Christ
[48:03] can you post that to the Father in the
[48:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I want
[48:09] to make sure that my text messages and
[48:11] my phone calls I can say all of them in
[48:13] the name of Jesus Christ thanking the
[48:15] father it's a great it's a great lesson
[48:17] to keep in mind if we want to walk in
[48:19] the spirit we've got to praise God we
[48:22] got a worship dog I love God from our
[48:23] hearts and we have to be thankful and
[48:26] make sure everything we say is
[48:27] expressing our gratitude to God amen
[48:32] and even if even if we get criticized
[48:35] when you say thank the Lord if they're
[48:37] right well then thank you Lord for
[48:38] correcting me if they're wrong say
[48:41] praise the Lord that God so thought God
[48:43] thought so much of my walk that you let
[48:45] the enemy persecute me I hate him head
[48:48] brace God thank the Lord because well
[48:52] Graham said God loves to test his
[48:54] children I remember that quote he loves
[48:56] to do it because he loves the scene he
[48:58] knows how they're gonna respond they're
[49:00] gonna respond with the right spirit
[49:01] praise God we respond in victory they
[49:04] responded by overcoming by the blood of
[49:07] the Lamb and the
[49:08] word of their testimony he loves the
[49:10] testa's children hey man how do you yeah
[49:15] and I'll tell you about more about today
[49:17] behind quiet an attack today I had such
[49:18] an attack today that my felt I thought
[49:20] my heart was gonna get pump out of my
[49:22] shirt because I was criticized a little
[49:26] bit today but I'll tell you about it
[49:28] more Lord willing in the future but as
[49:29] things go about their their course I'll
[49:33] stay like that so in everything we can
[49:36] give thanks because God wants to see us
[49:38] recognize that God is the head over
[49:42] every situation God's not surprised by
[49:45] our difficult situations God knew all
[49:47] about it God allowed it and God's gonna
[49:49] bring us through it praise God amen so
[49:52] he wants to see that we have that same
[49:54] faith at the same God that was with us
[49:56] in their last trial is the same God
[49:59] who's gonna be with us in this trial so
[50:01] we should still sing we should still
[50:03] give thanks we should still act like a
[50:05] Christian act like a son or daughter of
[50:07] God and not a sinner right we should act
[50:10] like a real child of God and this is how
[50:12] real children of God act they give
[50:14] thanks they worship and they praise the
[50:16] Lord because they know God is in control
[50:18] praise God and God will not be mocked
[50:21] whatever a man reaps that will he so
[50:23] praise God and if we're if for I'm sorry
[50:27] we're sewing I'm sorry that was he so is
[50:29] that will he reap if we're sewing
[50:31] worship hallelujah if we're sewing
[50:33] singing if we're sowing seeds of
[50:35] Thanksgiving we're gonna reap great
[50:37] fruit of the Spirit praise God that's
[50:40] right amen thank the Lord
[50:43] now this is I got two more major points
[50:46] I wanted to spend the rest of my time on
[50:47] I know I said that kind of early but
[50:49] that's true I do want to spend my most
[50:51] of my time with the next verse I want to
[50:54] spend the rest of the time on here
[50:56] before we get to 22 now in 21 the Bible
[51:01] says submitting yourselves one to
[51:04] another in the fear of God so if we want
[51:07] to walk in the spirit we got to sing we
[51:09] got to give thanks we got to sing it
[51:11] from our hearts with people we got to
[51:13] give thanks and then we have to elevate
[51:14] others or humble ourselves
[51:17] now here's per me little dry throat
[51:21] here's the Greek definition of
[51:23] submission it means to be subordinate to
[51:28] obey to be under obedience to put under
[51:33] subdue to be subject to to submit
[51:36] yourself rather simple definitions right
[51:39] Paul says submit yourselves one to
[51:43] another okay so what does that mean
[51:46] George it doesn't mean that we owe that
[51:48] only you only submit to the pastor no no
[51:52] we submit one to another right it goes
[51:56] from Pastor to the congregation and then
[51:58] from husband to wife and sometimes
[52:00] children to parents right you submit
[52:02] like if you're wrong you should submit
[52:04] and say you're wrong praise God but if
[52:08] you're right be humble about it but be
[52:10] right right because we're all gonna make
[52:13] mistakes
[52:14] we're all gonna fall short of the glory
[52:15] of God program says you know you'll
[52:17] never go to a perfect Church right
[52:19] you'll never you'll never be a perfect
[52:21] human being we want to be we strive to
[52:24] be well you'll never be perfect in that
[52:27] of yourself so the Bible says we submit
[52:30] ourselves unto others and why do we do
[52:35] it we do it in the fear of God
[52:37] now that word fear means alarm or fright
[52:42] or terror so we obey others when when
[52:48] it's right we we put ourselves under
[52:53] obedience to others because we fear God
[52:57] so we have a healthy fear of God we are
[53:01] frightened at the power of Jesus Christ
[53:03] are we not we are we send in great
[53:07] terror of his power because we know our
[53:10] lives and all lives are held in his hand
[53:13] how many realize you're not guaranteed
[53:15] tomorrow the Lord could take me home
[53:18] tomorrow he could take you home tomorrow
[53:20] he could take anyone and think of the
[53:22] ones you love the most your family he
[53:24] could take any of those home tomorrow
[53:25] and he would be right in doing it if it
[53:28] was his time right you know went to a
[53:32] few
[53:33] Monday for sister Marion she was 74 yet
[53:36] people were weeping and crying because
[53:39] they thought it was too early but Church
[53:42] God knows the right time and don't get
[53:45] me wrong when our loved ones passed we
[53:47] all should mourn right and not mourning
[53:49] because we don't know where they are but
[53:51] mourning because we lost their
[53:52] fellowship right we but but the Bible
[53:57] said precious in the sight Lord is the
[53:58] death of the saints you should have
[54:00] heard some of the testimonies while we
[54:01] were there one of them was all the
[54:05] people that got married like my wife and
[54:07] I this sister drove three hours across
[54:11] the state and she only knew us for maybe
[54:12] a year
[54:13] and come to our wedding reception we
[54:15] were my wife and I were poor I'm not
[54:18] gonna say dirt poor but we were pretty
[54:19] poor but she brought three or three or
[54:22] four huge containers maybe 20 pounds of
[54:25] rice to our wedding reception and
[54:27] basically paid for most of our wedding
[54:28] reception this woman that passed away
[54:30] she was such a saint there was a couple
[54:33] brothers there that visited a couple
[54:35] weeks a couple of shows a couple of
[54:37] months probably a year ago brother
[54:38] visited his name was Isaac and he and
[54:45] his friends would go get drunk and have
[54:47] sand parties and they'd be covered in
[54:48] beaten in beach sand and everything like
[54:50] that and the house they would go to
[54:54] coming home would be that sister's house
[54:56] her and her husband because they were so
[54:58] loving they were rank sinners now these
[55:01] men were rank sinners then their drunken
[55:03] and smoking weed and every all the
[55:05] smells all over them and they would walk
[55:07] in her house and she would care for them
[55:09] she would feed them soup she'd help them
[55:12] to change give him a clean set of
[55:15] clothes to change into
[55:16] he said she would even tuck them into
[55:19] bed and pray for them and they're still
[55:22] coming down from there hi and this just
[55:24] was at one time it was time and time and
[55:27] time again you want to talk about a
[55:29] saint you want to talk about someone
[55:31] who's who who has patience and has the
[55:34] fruit of the Holy Spirit and he's and he
[55:37] started crying his name is Isaac he
[55:38] started crying right there we're outside
[55:40] just all the kid running around he's
[55:42] crying he said and she never removed me
[55:44] one time she and her husband Bill
[55:46] pray for me they just prayed for me now
[55:49] what was she doing she was elevating
[55:52] others above herself praise God and she
[55:56] and he said because of the love of her
[55:58] and the love of Jesus Christ all their
[56:00] prayers he eventually gave his heart to
[56:02] Lord because of the way he was treated
[56:04] by these people he knew and he knew he
[56:06] was wrong what he was doing he heard the
[56:08] word even his wife you know he was one
[56:10] that this guy was married in fact during
[56:12] some of the times he was getting drunk
[56:13] like this with children and even that he
[56:16] knew he was wrong he saw the love of
[56:18] Jesus Christ through this sister and the
[56:20] kindness of God led him to repentance
[56:22] amen what a saint and people think they
[56:26] can't do anything for God your whenever
[56:29] you elevate others whenever you serve
[56:30] others you're doing something for God
[56:33] remember the greatest among you is not
[56:35] the the smartest the greatest among you
[56:37] is the servant those who concern I told
[56:41] that brother I said there's gonna be a
[56:42] lot of surprise on Judgment Day the
[56:45] people we thought were great and the
[56:47] people who God sees are great it's those
[56:50] who serve it's those who humble
[56:53] themselves now she never said it was
[56:55] okay to smoke to get drunk she never
[56:57] said what she did she just served them
[56:59] and showed them love and another thing
[57:02] was the one of the Deacons there told me
[57:05] every service she put a prayer request
[57:07] and said Saints please pray for my
[57:09] children to be saved and won I won
[57:11] they're not all say but one by one they
[57:13] got saved over the years there's just a
[57:15] couple more left to be saved
[57:17] amen and the the Deacon even admitted he
[57:21] said sometimes mother Jesse I struggle
[57:22] with that like why would you put it in
[57:24] every week and why but he said I realize
[57:26] it was her faith she was overcoming any
[57:30] doubt and unbelief and just trusting in
[57:32] the Living God and making her requests
[57:34] made known unto God and look what God
[57:36] did praise God
[57:38] they can look back at it now decades
[57:40] later ten years so we mean to be
[57:42] encouraged
[57:42] let's keep praying that's not telling a
[57:45] case you know all her prayers for
[57:46] adamant and all these children all of
[57:48] our prayers for Adam now we can see the
[57:50] fruit of it praise God
[57:51] we haven't seen it yet but I believe we
[57:53] will see it praise God eight months
[57:55] without getting drunk eight months
[57:57] without going back to drugs and listen
[57:59] about
[58:00] Brannen and praying and going to church
[58:01] and and reading his Bible and and to see
[58:04] all these prayers that we thought were
[58:06] they ever heard of course they were
[58:08] heard amen hallelujah
[58:11] and so we need to take these testimonies
[58:12] and be encouraged right and give thanks
[58:15] amen and find ways that we can serve
[58:17] others now with most of us it's with our
[58:19] families if we can serve just our
[58:22] families that will teach us the humility
[58:25] we need praise God on a daily basis just
[58:28] to serve just to keep investing just to
[58:31] keep humbling ourselves and just to lift
[58:33] up others and help out others praise God
[58:36] amen glory see we do it in the fear of
[58:40] God because we respect God we know God
[58:44] can take away your life at any moment we
[58:46] can know God can pull our car any moment
[58:51] we know God doesn't play around right we
[58:55] know God can he can strike us he can
[58:57] strike someone with a sickness he could
[58:59] strike someone with a car accident as a
[59:02] test he can allow it right he can allow
[59:04] it as a test so we understand the fear
[59:06] of the Lord and that's how that's the
[59:10] only way we can elevate others is when
[59:12] we remember how great God is in the fear
[59:16] of the Lord
[59:16] submit yourselves to others in the fear
[59:19] of the Lord because you know how great
[59:20] God is
[59:21] remember if John said if you can't love
[59:24] the people if you can't submit and serve
[59:26] the people that you can see you can't
[59:28] serve the god that you can't see right
[59:30] if you can't love and humble yourself
[59:32] and serve the people you see you'll
[59:34] never serve God because you can't see
[59:36] him right so we have to be able to serve
[59:40] those that we can see and then that
[59:42] proves we truly serve God now I want to
[59:46] look at there's at least 1 2 3 4 5 6
[59:50] examples about serving others so let's
[59:53] look at this real quick if you got your
[59:56] Bibles let's go to Roman's of 13 might
[1:00:02] want to just that's right now Romans 13
[1:00:05] I was gonna might want to keep your
[1:00:06] place but you know we probably will go
[1:00:07] back to Ephesians
[1:00:11] Romans 13:1 now as we read us remember
[1:00:20] Paul's writing this to Christians in the
[1:00:23] Roman government or I'm starting the
[1:00:24] Roman society Roman society look at
[1:00:30] verse 1 then every soul be subject unto
[1:00:32] the higher powers for there's no power
[1:00:35] but of God the powers that be are
[1:00:37] deigned of God so let's just stop for a
[1:00:40] moment the powers in America ordained of
[1:00:44] God and most the time we're thankful for
[1:00:47] it God ordained the government that we
[1:00:52] have in America thank God because people
[1:00:54] prayed for it they fasted for it when we
[1:00:56] went through that in history the first
[1:00:57] few presidents called prayer and fasting
[1:00:59] days Abraham Lincoln called prayer and
[1:01:01] fasting days thank God for our
[1:01:02] government praise God he said let every
[1:01:06] soul not just some every soul obey the
[1:01:09] higher powers who sever therefore
[1:01:13] resisteth the power resisteth the
[1:01:15] ordinance of God and they that resist
[1:01:17] shall receive to themselves damnation
[1:01:19] now what does even Paul says if you
[1:01:22] can't obey the natural laws damnation is
[1:01:25] going to come upon you verse 3 for
[1:01:29] rulers are not a terror to good works
[1:01:31] but to the evil will thou then not to be
[1:01:35] afraid of the power do that which is
[1:01:38] good and thou shalt have praise of the
[1:01:41] same you know you got to be careful with
[1:01:43] people that speak bad about police
[1:01:45] officers right I know there's some
[1:01:47] corrupt ones there's a lot of Krupp
[1:01:48] preachers there's a lot of corrupt moms
[1:01:50] there's a lot of Krupp dads right but if
[1:01:55] someone is keep attacking the government
[1:01:57] they don't understand what they're
[1:01:59] saying as far as the the godly laws
[1:02:01] they've got the wrong idea they're in a
[1:02:04] bad spiritual condition someone's like
[1:02:10] like I said there's bad cops there's bad
[1:02:12] teachers I know there's bad teachers in
[1:02:13] our school system no doubt about it but
[1:02:16] if you do
[1:02:18] do good you don't fear the powers
[1:02:20] because you're under the law of Liberty
[1:02:22] memory looked at that last week you're
[1:02:24] under the law of Liberty and so
[1:02:26] apologist says if you can't obey man's
[1:02:29] law you're gonna be damned by God's law
[1:02:32] that's right
[1:02:34] look at verse four four he's the
[1:02:36] minister of God to thee for good
[1:02:38] speaking of leaders on the earth but if
[1:02:42] thou do that which I'm sorry yeah nobody
[1:02:44] thought do that which is evil be afraid
[1:02:45] for he beareth not the sword in vain for
[1:02:48] he is the minister of God a revenger to
[1:02:50] execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
[1:02:53] so obviously sometimes God pours out his
[1:02:57] judgments through the laws of the land a
[1:02:59] lot of those people in jail deserve to
[1:03:02] be in jail right some of the sentences
[1:03:06] they get they deserve it because of the
[1:03:09] evil of the law of man they wouldn't
[1:03:11] obey the law of man but the law of man
[1:03:13] was based on the law of God right with
[1:03:16] drugs and violence and and and abuse and
[1:03:19] all these things that's based upon God's
[1:03:22] law
[1:03:23] and if they won't obey man's law God's
[1:03:25] God's law is gonna catch him eventually
[1:03:31] so did you see him
[1:03:33] let every soul be subject so we got to
[1:03:36] humble ourselves humble ourselves to law
[1:03:39] I've seen it with this too a lot of
[1:03:41] people will speak evil the speed limit
[1:03:43] laws you ever seen a message person do
[1:03:45] that they'll speak evil about the and
[1:03:49] think they can speed and break the laws
[1:03:52] that's wrong that's the wrong attitude
[1:03:55] they shouldn't they shouldn't go against
[1:03:57] the laws of the land like I said I go
[1:04:00] five miles per hour over all right we
[1:04:03] say five is Grace but if people speak
[1:04:06] evil of that like if they speak evil of
[1:04:08] our leaders and evil the laws it shows
[1:04:12] they're in a wrong spiritual condition
[1:04:14] speak evil cops
[1:04:16] enforcers of the law Paul says they're
[1:04:19] damned if they do this they don't obey
[1:04:21] God's laws on earth or man's laws rather
[1:04:23] he said they'll be damned verse five
[1:04:28] wherefore he must needs be subject not
[1:04:31] only for wrath but also for conscience
[1:04:33] sake so see people will walk around in
[1:04:35] message churches and they'll have an
[1:04:37] evil conscience on their conscience
[1:04:39] because they know they're not obeying
[1:04:40] the law of the land like they don't
[1:04:42] report all the money they made on taxes
[1:04:44] that's the evil conscience right they
[1:04:47] don't drive the right speed limit that's
[1:04:49] an evil conscience and you watch it and
[1:04:52] I just want let me read this quote here
[1:04:54] by God's grace I found a good quote
[1:04:55] today it's in from the sermon enticing
[1:05:00] spirits 1955 he said amongst a lot of
[1:05:06] people we find where emotions and so
[1:05:08] forth there comes paddling's and
[1:05:10] backbiting
[1:05:11] ever seen that the church backbiting to
[1:05:13] the church and all kind of ungodly
[1:05:16] things brother that soul fork acid in
[1:05:18] the church it's demon power so when
[1:05:22] people are gossiping about others and
[1:05:24] backbiting and making them look bad to
[1:05:26] other people in the church he said
[1:05:27] that's demon power spirit of men and
[1:05:31] women who get among one another and try
[1:05:32] to push off and say this one's not right
[1:05:35] and that one's not right and that one's
[1:05:36] not right so brother I'm saying if
[1:05:38] somebody's in the church saying that
[1:05:39] person is wrong that and they're making
[1:05:41] everybody else look bad to try to make
[1:05:43] themselves look good
[1:05:44] program said that's a demon power and it
[1:05:50] goes on to say if you'll chain times out
[1:05:53] of 10 it's the very person making the
[1:05:57] stir that's not right with God
[1:06:00] he said amen God hates this cord among
[1:06:04] brethren so church let's watch watch our
[1:06:07] church watch other churches see who's
[1:06:09] making stirs about other people publicly
[1:06:13] right and see who's trying to make peace
[1:06:16] with everybody because he said 9 times
[1:06:20] out of 10 the person who's backbiting
[1:06:23] and speaking evil about people in the
[1:06:25] church they're the ones who are not
[1:06:27] right with God all right
[1:06:31] that's true be Reverend be holy love God
[1:06:37] stand by him as long as your life is
[1:06:40] giving up with the Bible with purity of
[1:06:42] heart purity of thought love towards
[1:06:44] your brother trying your best to up
[1:06:46] build the kingdom of God and doing those
[1:06:48] things dressing right living right
[1:06:50] talking right going the right places
[1:06:52] then you can have all the motions you
[1:06:53] want to and everyone will believe it he
[1:06:55] said Jesus said you're the salt of the
[1:06:57] earth amen thank that are mine he said
[1:07:04] if you be salty the world will be
[1:07:07] thirsty you get salty they'll be thirsty
[1:07:10] oh my so see church look and see who's
[1:07:16] condemning others and look and see who's
[1:07:18] building others up saying nice things
[1:07:20] about people that's what the scrip
[1:07:29] says conscience see people's conscience
[1:07:32] they it weighs on them those demons if
[1:07:35] they're in people's lives they're not if
[1:07:37] they're not confess and cast out those
[1:07:39] demons will start attacking other people
[1:07:42] so always watch who is the one accusing
[1:07:45] someone else who started the accusation
[1:07:48] nine times out of ten is the person
[1:07:51] who's got the wrong spirit and then
[1:07:58] watch who is watch who is communicating
[1:08:01] with love because when you really love
[1:08:05] somebody you want to correct them you're
[1:08:06] gonna come across in a kind way then the
[1:08:09] Bible say that we're tender-hearted and
[1:08:10] weary preach on that last week don't
[1:08:13] speak wrath things the Bible said but be
[1:08:15] tender-hearted forgiving people from
[1:08:18] your hearts
[1:08:21] watch how someone tries to bring
[1:08:23] correction oh thank you Jesus why
[1:08:29] because we fear God if I got the wrong
[1:08:32] attitude God's not gonna let me get away
[1:08:34] with that he's gonna correct me right
[1:08:37] same thing for all of us if we plant the
[1:08:41] wrong seeds we're gonna reap the
[1:08:42] whirlwind right so why do we live why do
[1:08:46] we humble ourselves because we fear God
[1:08:49] we know God is watching us what a great
[1:08:56] lesson so now you look and see the legal
[1:09:00] part of your life
[1:09:01] you have to humble yourself to the law
[1:09:07] let me tell lose it again here maybe
[1:09:10] another way god help us if if we know
[1:09:15] we're breaking the law then god help us
[1:09:16] to make it right praise God if we know
[1:09:23] we're breaking the law may the
[1:09:24] conviction of the Holy Spirit come so
[1:09:26] strongly on any of us if we're breaking
[1:09:29] the law that will go back and and do
[1:09:32] what's right or else then what good is
[1:09:36] what good is trying to serve God if we
[1:09:40] can't obey
[1:09:40] these natural laws however use of the
[1:09:42] spiritual law of working in the holy
[1:09:44] spirit and signs miracles and wonders
[1:09:46] how we can ever get there we're not only
[1:09:49] going to get there if we keep the little
[1:09:52] things right and if you can trust us
[1:09:54] with the little things then you can
[1:09:55] trust us with the more responsible
[1:09:57] things praise God this is also in first
[1:10:03] Peter 2:13 so I'm going to turn there
[1:10:05] first Peter 2:13 first Peter 2:13 now it
[1:10:19] says this submit yourselves to every
[1:10:21] ordinance of man for the lord's sake
[1:10:24] whether it be to the king as supreme or
[1:10:28] unto governors as unto them that are
[1:10:30] sent by him by the punishment of
[1:10:32] evildoers and for the praise of them
[1:10:35] that do well for so for so is the will
[1:10:39] of God that with well doing you may put
[1:10:41] to silence the ignorance of foolish men
[1:10:43] right so Paul Peter says by obeying the
[1:10:47] laws of the land the sinners don't have
[1:10:51] a chance to bring reproach upon Christ
[1:10:55] they'll say wow that brother obeys the
[1:10:58] law that sister honors man that's just
[1:11:01] that brother obeys man he humbles
[1:11:04] himself the man amen Peter said humble
[1:11:07] yourself to the laws of man for God's
[1:11:10] sake amen what you have thought about
[1:11:14] Jesus have become breaking all the laws
[1:11:16] people would not a thought he was very
[1:11:19] good right we would not thought he
[1:11:21] wasn't very holy but he came and kept
[1:11:23] all the laws praise God he broke all the
[1:11:26] Pharisees man-made traditions but he
[1:11:29] kept the law of God and he kept the law
[1:11:31] of man amen hallelujah of course we
[1:11:35] should break man-made denominational
[1:11:38] laws hallelujah thank the Lord so Peter
[1:11:44] says submit to the government for God's
[1:11:47] sake
[1:11:54] now let's go to another one here
[1:11:56] first Corinthians 16 16 I want you to
[1:12:01] see in the scripture I think it's more
[1:12:05] powerful don't you when you see it
[1:12:07] yourself and we get to just look at it I
[1:12:09] think it's more powerful phrase God now
[1:12:18] it's kind of difficult to understand the
[1:12:21] verse 16 let's go up to 15 I beseech you
[1:12:25] brethren you know the house of stephanas
[1:12:27] that it is the firstfruits of achaia and
[1:12:33] that they have addicted themselves to
[1:12:36] the ministry of the saints so it seems
[1:12:41] like this house of stephanas is busy
[1:12:44] serving the people of god that's hard to
[1:12:47] know how exactly they're ministering
[1:12:50] there but let's go to verse 16 that you
[1:12:54] submit yourselves unto such unto
[1:12:56] everyone that help with with us and
[1:12:58] laborious they go to 17 I'm glad of the
[1:13:01] coming of stephanas and fortunatus and
[1:13:04] aquellas for that which was lacking on
[1:13:07] your part they have supplied for they
[1:13:09] have refreshed my spirit and yours
[1:13:11] therefore acknowledge me them that are
[1:13:14] such okay so somehow they're meeting the
[1:13:18] needs of Paul and the other believers
[1:13:22] now perhaps they were meeting the
[1:13:25] physical needs right perhaps they were
[1:13:26] feeding the poor perhaps they were
[1:13:29] feeding the poor Christians maybe they
[1:13:31] were paying their rent or helping him
[1:13:32] out with their bills right maybe here
[1:13:36] the Bible said just refreshing them
[1:13:38] fellowship with them giving their time
[1:13:40] maybe doing Bible studies Paul said he
[1:13:43] said submit yourselves to the house of
[1:13:45] stephanas maybe they're having Church in
[1:13:47] his house right because there was other
[1:13:51] people that had churches in their house
[1:13:53] like Aquila and Priscilla they had a
[1:13:54] church in their house so Paul says
[1:13:57] submit yourself to the house of
[1:13:59] stephanas maybe he was the pastor maybe
[1:14:01] he wasn't but he said Oh in other words
[1:14:04] obey them
[1:14:05] if they ask you to do something obey
[1:14:09] submit yourself so now we can see two
[1:14:14] areas you submit in the area of
[1:14:16] government and you submit you're at
[1:14:18] yourself to your brothers and sisters
[1:14:21] praise God in Christ submit yourself
[1:14:23] they're trying to serve other people
[1:14:25] they're trying to help people submit
[1:14:28] yourself and serve others now the way
[1:14:35] that you and I might see it is if we're
[1:14:36] talking after church on a Sunday right
[1:14:38] because that's when we see most of the
[1:14:39] saints you talk to somebody and you find
[1:14:43] out they need help so the way to
[1:14:46] minister to them is to say can I call
[1:14:48] you up and talk about this
[1:14:49] how can I help you out with some food or
[1:14:52] can help you out somehow find a way we
[1:14:55] can minister and serve others and meet
[1:14:58] the needs of others it's a great way to
[1:15:01] do it or you find out someone from
[1:15:05] another church needs help or they're
[1:15:08] their mother and father that don't even
[1:15:10] go to our church is it a isn't it a
[1:15:12] godly thing if we can help out somebody
[1:15:14] who doesn't go to our church yes submit
[1:15:18] the body say submit yourselves to that
[1:15:20] house submit yourself to the leadership
[1:15:22] of these believers who are serving the
[1:15:26] city the Corinthians submit yourselves
[1:15:33] what I've seen it like when we first
[1:15:35] come in the message you know the church
[1:15:41] he went to his Lima Bible believers but
[1:15:43] there was a little gathering there and
[1:15:46] every Saturday night at one of the
[1:15:48] brothers houses we would go and have
[1:15:50] church service there now here's just a
[1:15:53] little example when you go to somebody's
[1:15:58] house you want to be a good guest right
[1:16:01] we would have Church Church in their
[1:16:04] house they clean out their their living
[1:16:06] room so we could have service they put a
[1:16:08] pulpit in their chairs now what kind of
[1:16:10] guest would we have been if they said
[1:16:12] can you take your shoes off at the door
[1:16:13] said no I'm keeping my shoes on I don't
[1:16:16] wear holy we don't take our shoes off in
[1:16:18] church well if you're in somebody else's
[1:16:21] house submit yourself right or how'd you
[1:16:25] feel of you wet in their bathroom and
[1:16:27] then just the you know just left some
[1:16:29] toilet paper on the floor left your
[1:16:31] tissue on the for you or just you made
[1:16:33] it all dirty
[1:16:34] you should humble yourself right serve
[1:16:37] that person clean up their bathroom form
[1:16:40] right he's saying submit yourself to the
[1:16:42] house of stephanas because they're
[1:16:44] ministering to the city so whatever
[1:16:47] that's a good example when I went there
[1:16:49] if they asked me could you could you
[1:16:51] move your car and park somewhere else we
[1:16:53] don't get upset humble yourself right
[1:16:56] and think of any way you can humble
[1:16:59] yourself and honor other people of
[1:17:02] course in those days they'd have cars
[1:17:03] but can you move your chariot or
[1:17:06] something you know just find a way to
[1:17:08] humble yourself to other Christians obey
[1:17:11] the government and try to humble
[1:17:12] yourself to other Christians a real
[1:17:15] question Christian who walks in the
[1:17:17] spirit submits themselves to other
[1:17:19] Christians when that when they can now
[1:17:25] let's go to another one
[1:17:28] Philippians 2:3 this is why we do it
[1:17:30] flip Ian's to three Philippians 2:3
[1:17:45] relations Ephesians Philippians
[1:17:46] Colossians so Philippians 2:3
[1:17:50] now here's a believer or here's Paul
[1:17:53] writing about having the mind of Christ
[1:17:55] how many want the mind of Christ tonight
[1:17:57] you want to think just like Jesus that's
[1:17:59] what he's talking about verse to fulfill
[1:18:02] you my joy that you be like-minded
[1:18:04] having the same love being of one Accord
[1:18:05] of one mind let nothing be done through
[1:18:08] strife or vainglory so don't do anything
[1:18:12] on purpose to kind of rattle the other
[1:18:15] guy's nerves right don't do anything for
[1:18:20] your glory okay so don't try to just
[1:18:24] ruffle somebody's feathers you ever see
[1:18:26] that I've seen it people try to ruffle
[1:18:28] their feathers on purpose to kind of get
[1:18:30] under their skin Paul says don't do that
[1:18:33] he said don't do things for vain glory
[1:18:35] to lift yourself up take the mind of
[1:18:37] Christ verse two having the same love
[1:18:43] being of one Accord of one mind let
[1:18:47] nothing be done through
[1:18:48] I'm sorry verse 4 look not every man on
[1:18:51] his own things but every man also on the
[1:18:54] things of others I've seen people that
[1:18:59] in our church that have had moving
[1:19:02] expenses to move from one place to
[1:19:03] another and I've seen Christians go up
[1:19:05] and give them money to help them out
[1:19:06] here at our church that's a good thing
[1:19:09] to do submit yourselves right help them
[1:19:12] out you know somebody's struggling find
[1:19:15] a way to help them out if you can just
[1:19:17] help somebody move right just help
[1:19:19] somebody move from their old house to
[1:19:21] new house you don't do it for money but
[1:19:23] just do something nice that can I help
[1:19:25] you out you need any help with that look
[1:19:28] to everyone else's needs and see how you
[1:19:30] can help them out now that's a real
[1:19:34] Christian life let this mind be in you
[1:19:36] which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:19:40] submit yourselves one to another he says
[1:19:43] in the fear of God so this is why you do
[1:19:48] it you esteem others better than
[1:19:49] yourselves and that doesn't mean like oh
[1:19:52] there are better Christian in me
[1:19:53] no you just esteem their needs better
[1:19:55] they need this meant more than I need my
[1:19:57] needs met they're not a better person or
[1:20:00] I'm not the worst person but I feel like
[1:20:02] I need to help them out more than I need
[1:20:03] to help myself out so does it mean we
[1:20:08] think oh they're a better person mean it
[1:20:09] doesn't mean you give yourself a pity
[1:20:11] party right and beat yourself up because
[1:20:13] remember about have said it's true you
[1:20:15] and I are only as strong as our
[1:20:16] confession if you say I'm a miserable
[1:20:19] Christian if I say I'm a weak Christian
[1:20:21] I'm gonna act like one
[1:20:22] so there's a part of that where we have
[1:20:25] to confess I'm strong in the Lord I'm
[1:20:27] gonna put on the full armor of God
[1:20:28] I don't maybe I maybe didn't have the
[1:20:30] great best start today but I'm gonna
[1:20:32] take the shoot of faith I'm gonna take
[1:20:33] the sort of spirit and I'm gonna praise
[1:20:35] in the heart I'm going to change the
[1:20:37] atmosphere I'll be strong today praise
[1:20:38] God it's not like oh they're wise virgin
[1:20:41] I'm a foolish that's that's not what
[1:20:43] we're talking about here we're not we're
[1:20:46] not to do that but mother says you're
[1:20:48] all set you're supposed to have the kind
[1:20:50] of faith that if anybody's going the
[1:20:51] rapture in this city it's gonna be me
[1:20:53] and that's not that's not in Pride but
[1:20:56] that's in that's in confidence right
[1:20:59] that's an expectation Lord I'm I look at
[1:21:03] my life and I'm so sincere if one person
[1:21:05] is gonna make it let it be me praise God
[1:21:08] in other words you are so pressing on
[1:21:11] toward the mark of the high calling in
[1:21:12] Christ that you know you're selling out
[1:21:14] you've surrendered everything and you're
[1:21:17] not trying to be better than other
[1:21:18] people but if one person is gonna make
[1:21:20] it I'm gonna press toward the mark
[1:21:22] I'm gonna lay aside every weight and I'm
[1:21:24] gonna be the one who achieves the prize
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:28] but not that I'm better than that person
[1:21:30] a church like you and I understand we go
[1:21:33] to work and I mingle with the people I'm
[1:21:35] no better than them but I can obey God
[1:21:39] better than them but I'm not no better
[1:21:42] than them right because my life is a
[1:21:44] vapor - I get weak I get tired I get
[1:21:46] headaches I get cranky I fall short of
[1:21:49] God's glory - I'm not better than them
[1:21:53] far as the value of there's there so um
[1:21:55] no better but I do want to serve the
[1:21:58] moment to humble themselves I can please
[1:22:00] God and I can be a better Christian than
[1:22:02] I was yesterday praise God but we don't
[1:22:06] do anything through strife or I'm gonna
[1:22:08] get back at them or vainglory to make
[1:22:10] myself look good we don't do that that's
[1:22:14] not the Spirit of Christ that's already
[1:22:16] about 40 minutes already set my timer
[1:22:18] here so let me just give me ten more
[1:22:19] here I'll try to preach 50 minutes by
[1:22:22] God's grace now let's read another
[1:22:26] scripture real briefly here where was it
[1:22:32] yeah that girthy and 7-1 this is for
[1:22:35] real familiar Saint Corinthians 7:1 now
[1:22:38] this is about the fear of God number we
[1:22:40] talked about that submit yourselves to
[1:22:43] each other in the fear of God sinker
[1:22:46] these seven one says having therefore
[1:22:49] these promises dearly beloved let us
[1:22:51] cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
[1:22:54] the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness
[1:22:56] in the fear of God so see we've got two
[1:23:00] daily cleanse ourselves in the fear of
[1:23:03] God and then we submit to our submit to
[1:23:07] others in the fear of God as well so in
[1:23:11] both of these things we see how great
[1:23:13] God is we see how powerful God is and
[1:23:17] because of how great is because we fear
[1:23:19] him we're gonna serve others and we're
[1:23:21] gonna try to live a more Clinton or
[1:23:23] clean life every day now tell you my
[1:23:26] video on the morning routine has not
[1:23:27] been very popular and I was a little
[1:23:30] surprised but then afterwards I wasn't
[1:23:32] kind of like well not many people want
[1:23:34] to really seek God in the morning so
[1:23:36] most people aren't gonna click on that
[1:23:37] they're gonna click on something that's
[1:23:39] not they'll click on something that
[1:23:41] shows where someone else is wrong but
[1:23:43] not themselves that's true that's true
[1:23:47] people are quick to click on all what's
[1:23:49] wrong with them what's wrong with them
[1:23:50] now how about you and Italian up to
[1:23:52] God's Word oh my I see fearing God is a
[1:23:58] requirement to go up the stature of a
[1:24:01] perfect man
[1:24:03] because you're perfecting holiness in
[1:24:05] the fear of God we must fear God the
[1:24:08] people that really fear God are gonna
[1:24:09] live a more holy life because they
[1:24:12] perfect holiness in the fear of God
[1:24:14] because they know God's power and his
[1:24:18] laws they fear God so they obey God so
[1:24:21] they clean out their lives more and more
[1:24:22] and more because they want to please God
[1:24:24] and because of that and the fear of God
[1:24:28] they submit themselves they humble
[1:24:30] themselves and sometimes they'll always
[1:24:32] they'll hum of themselves to the
[1:24:33] government when it's when it's with the
[1:24:35] word go home of themselves to church
[1:24:37] members and they'll humming themselves
[1:24:40] to church leaders here's what we see
[1:24:42] next Hebrews 13:17 I've read this a
[1:24:45] couple times over the last few years
[1:24:46] Hebrews 13:17 17 the Bible says obey
[1:24:54] them that have the rule over you and
[1:24:56] submit yourselves for they watch for
[1:24:58] your souls as they that must give
[1:25:00] account that they may do it with joy and
[1:25:02] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[1:25:05] for you okay so now we've seen three
[1:25:08] levels you submit yourself to the
[1:25:10] government you submit yourselves to
[1:25:12] other Christians and the third ones you
[1:25:14] submit yourself to the pastor right
[1:25:16] submit yourselves to the Deacons now we
[1:25:18] don't have deacons here I'm the only
[1:25:19] Deacon here but you submit yourselves to
[1:25:22] Christians to the church leaders and you
[1:25:24] submit yourself to the government praise
[1:25:25] God and then now you submit yourself set
[1:25:30] older believers now this is just not
[1:25:33] just believers but the older believers
[1:25:36] who've been around longest serving the
[1:25:37] Lord that's in 1st Peter 5:5 1st Peter
[1:25:42] 5:5 verse 5 likewise he younger younger
[1:25:47] younger submit yourselves unto the elder
[1:25:52] yay all of you be subject one to another
[1:25:55] and be clothed with humility for God
[1:25:57] resists the proud God is working against
[1:26:00] the prideful but he giveth grace to the
[1:26:04] humble hey hey
[1:26:05] Alleluia thank the Lord God is resisting
[1:26:10] he's fighting against the proud but he
[1:26:13] gives grace he gives more favor to the
[1:26:15] humble
[1:26:17] so see now there's I think there was
[1:26:20] four levels there submit to the
[1:26:21] government submit to other Christians
[1:26:23] who have ministries submit to the
[1:26:25] leaders in the church and then submit to
[1:26:27] the oldest believers who have been
[1:26:29] serving God the longest in the church
[1:26:31] all these areas especially the younger
[1:26:35] ones right young children submit
[1:26:39] yourselves to the older Christians now
[1:26:41] only if it's in the will of God I had
[1:26:44] somebody come up a couple years ago and
[1:26:46] I was preaching about and they missed
[1:26:49] totally misunderstood it and I tried to
[1:26:50] correct them I don't know if they ever
[1:26:51] received or not they come up and
[1:26:53] questioned me afterwards in this room
[1:26:55] you know and but they were saying how I
[1:26:59] was saying I read a quote where brother
[1:27:00] Adam says if someone does you wrong go
[1:27:02] ahead let him do you wrong a humble
[1:27:04] yourself and take it and they tried to
[1:27:06] make it sound like I was saying that
[1:27:08] children should be allowed themselves to
[1:27:11] get hit by adults
[1:27:12] never never never
[1:27:16] we never submit to sin we only submit to
[1:27:21] obedience and children if anybody hurts
[1:27:24] you let me know right away I'll go talk
[1:27:26] to them right do not let anyone hurt you
[1:27:29] now if they're correcting you by the
[1:27:31] word that's different right but nobody
[1:27:35] should touch the children except their
[1:27:36] parents and the parents that have to do
[1:27:38] it with godliness as well they have to
[1:27:41] bring the rod but they shouldn't it
[1:27:43] doesn't go over to oh it doesn't go
[1:27:44] overboard right so many times shirts
[1:27:48] were misunderstood when we say submit
[1:27:49] yourself home of yourself we're not
[1:27:51] saying it's okay to be abused never
[1:27:53] abuse is never right never we're saying
[1:27:58] let don't always be selfish right never
[1:28:02] be selfish go along with the leadership
[1:28:05] of older Christians go along with the
[1:28:08] leadership of the pastor the Deacons go
[1:28:10] along with the leadership of the
[1:28:13] government as long as it lines up with
[1:28:15] God's Word but children no one should
[1:28:18] ever hurt you do you children understand
[1:28:19] no one should ever hurt you your parents
[1:28:23] have
[1:28:24] to discipline you but that shouldn't go
[1:28:25] into hurting you by abuse or anything
[1:28:29] that's right so please don't
[1:28:32] misunderstand that when we say submit
[1:28:35] doesn't mean get abused and get hurt
[1:28:37] that's not what it means it means humble
[1:28:40] yourself too I say like this humble
[1:28:46] yourself to die out to your will and do
[1:28:48] someone else's will as long as it lines
[1:28:51] up with God's will praise God
[1:28:54] see submission to others is a sign of
[1:28:58] wisdom because the fear of the Lord is
[1:29:01] the beginning of wisdom
[1:29:02] right and you submit yourselves in the
[1:29:05] fear of the Lord so only the wise will
[1:29:09] do these things only the wise will sing
[1:29:11] together with the spirit only the wise
[1:29:13] will sing from their hearts only the
[1:29:15] wise will give thanks and everything and
[1:29:17] only the wise will submit themselves to
[1:29:19] other Christians because it's a sign of
[1:29:23] wisdom as we read earlier in the chapter
[1:29:28] now let's read the next
[1:29:30] first let's go ahead and stand and
[1:29:31] musician you can come here let's read
[1:29:34] the last verse patience 5:22 visions
[1:29:52] 5:22 Lord willing next Wednesday we'll
[1:29:55] begin looking at this if the Lord would
[1:29:56] help us seasons 5 22 wives submit
[1:30:09] yourselves unto your own husband's as
[1:30:11] unto the Lord let's read verse 25
[1:30:15] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:30:19] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:30:21] for it now it's hard to tell church it's
[1:30:27] hard to tell how powerful these words
[1:30:29] are but if you live in Ephesus when Paul
[1:30:33] wrote this this and you would and you
[1:30:36] were a sinner beforehand this would have
[1:30:39] been like red lights shocking you right
[1:30:45] I'll say like this if you were a sinner
[1:30:47] if you were a sinner read this it
[1:30:49] would've been like what cuz we'll see it
[1:30:53] next week the culture was so different
[1:30:57] than today women and children were
[1:31:00] treated like dogs in this society men
[1:31:05] had all the unquestionable power men
[1:31:08] could have their children done away with
[1:31:11] I'll just say it like that just if they
[1:31:14] wanted to have their whites done away
[1:31:17] with men had all the power because they
[1:31:21] were sinners they were in the and some
[1:31:23] of the grossest sins and I won't go into
[1:31:25] details next week but we'll look at just
[1:31:27] a few details but to try to understand
[1:31:31] this
[1:31:31] this command Paul saying if you got the
[1:31:34] Spirit of Christ women will submit to
[1:31:36] the husbands and then husbands will love
[1:31:39] their wives and then the
[1:31:42] children will submit to the parents this
[1:31:46] was a culture shaking teaching it was
[1:31:50] hard to understand but how could they
[1:31:53] submit themselves they could submit
[1:31:55] themselves to others because they submit
[1:31:57] themselves to Christ and because they
[1:32:01] saw Christ submit himself unto God
[1:32:04] praise God
[1:32:08] let's just play that humble thyself in
[1:32:10] the side of the Lord let's play there
[1:32:12] then we'll choose a but that song we
[1:32:14] sing that when I want you as weas we
[1:32:16] choose the fear of the Lord now as we
[1:32:27] close tonight let's think about that
[1:32:29] let's meditate on that submission
[1:32:33] elevating others my prayer for tonight
[1:32:38] is that the Lord would open my eyes to
[1:32:42] see who I can serve more and I'll stop
[1:32:46] putting my eyes on myself and put my
[1:32:48] eyes on other people and just find
[1:32:51] simple ways that I can go serving other
[1:32:53] people how can I help them
[1:32:57] how can I obey the government better
[1:33:00] right how can i how can I honor the
[1:33:05] elders in our church how can I help
[1:33:09] someone's ministry in our church let's
[1:33:14] pray and meditate on that and ask the
[1:33:16] Lord to show us how can we submit to one
