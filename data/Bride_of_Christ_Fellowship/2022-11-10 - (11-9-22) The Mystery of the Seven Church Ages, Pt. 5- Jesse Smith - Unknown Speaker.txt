okay yeah sorry about that uh Revelation chapter 1 verse 20. yeah pardon me sure yeah yeah we walked in it was really cold so then I yeah yeah that's okay yeah if you get cold feel free to move you know if you two get colder everybody gets cold thank you I appreciate that yeah oh yeah there's a lock on the on the side of that my God's grace yeah no it's okay I'm always thankful you know you should go to the church in New York sometime brother they're in a they're in a room about 10 times the length of this and it's probably this this wide and they have fans all up and down uh it's really so and the and the the restroom is right next to the pulpit so when somebody's got to go to the restroom they got to go right up there right in front of everybody to use the restroom and there's only one restroom and there's about 200 people in the church it's it was really something but you know God's with them and God ministers to them so God will minister to us here tonight by God's grace so I'd like to continue this thought we're looking at the church ages this is part five The Mystery of the seven Church ages it's Revelation chapter one verse 20 Revelation 1 verse 20. so we're happy to have again brother Chris and brother Chris now some of this may sound brand new to you right how long have you been a Christian oh you're looking for answers okay I'm sorry I misunderstood sorry brother my father I must have assisted that will you come to the right place if you want answers praise God because the Bible's got all these answers that's the Bible has all the answers to praise God so yes thank you Christopher praise God so yeah you may hear lots of new things tonight and hopefully that'll interest you to want to come back and hear the word of God and and read the scriptures so Hallelujah let's read this on three one two three The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saw us in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sauce are the seven churches God bless you as you're being seen and praise God may God as blessings in the dream of his word you can turn my mic on now honey I'll just wait to the end yeah that's okay I'm sorry I should have told about that it's just been a crazy busy day okay so it seems like we're we just gotta make it here through the service and hopefully as a service goes on you know uh the sweetness of the holy spirit will guide us yeah I'm always a little nervous on Wednesday night I come right into service out of work I had an incredibly awful day today but um thank God that God protected everybody that's all I can say thank God God protected Everybody by his grace and his Mercy so thank the Lord you can switch over I just want to show a few pictures here um but we try to use a few visuals here by the grace of God and we're trying to get this in order here tonight this is part five here we've been looking at the uh the seven churches letters to the seven churches in the Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation is the final book in the entire Bible it contains a prophecy of the last two thousand years everything that has happened in the last two thousand years all the major spiritual events uh contains many of those events and also tells what's going to happen after Jesus comes back the second time praise God so we have a a we have a great we have a great glimpse into the current day the past 2000 years and also eternity to come by the grace of God what a privilege praise God what a privilege so we like to look uh at this thought you know I just thought I'd show this picture here to kind of give you just a visual here in Revelation we see Jesus Christ standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and the Bible says a sword goes out of his mouth he has hair white as wool he has this this robe this Vester uh hearing his feet are like brass and each one of these has a special meaning in fact there are seven details about Jesus Christ in this picture I'm not going to go through those today but but the main two I want to point out are the Seven Stars and the Seven uh golden candlesticks Jesus tells us these Seven stars represent seven men that would come to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ on Earth over these last uh 2000 years praise God and they would all shine with the same Light of Christ Hallelujah in other words their their preaching would be about Christ it would be the most accurate uh sermons about Jesus Christ uh their light their lights would Shine Jesus said they'd be like a city on a hill that could not be hidden praise God hallelujah he said he would say you are the light of the world praise God hallelujah and so God Jesus chose seven important men down through the last two thousand years and he revealed himself to each and every one but each of these Stars went to each of the seven candlesticks or different time periods over the last two thousand years okay so that's why each there's one star above each Candlestick so each time period got one messenger who would preach Jesus Christ the most accurate with the most power praise God with the most uh Vindication that Jesus Christ was still alive amen hallelujah thank God I know Jesus is still alive tonight praise God hallelujah we can't force them to do Miracles we can ask him we can't force him to show himself in fact some of us have never even heard the voice of God or anything like that maybe never even seen a vision or something but we've seen the spirit of God or we know the spirit of God speaks to our our minds it speaks to our souls and we see God answer our prayers and we many of us have seen Miracles but we can't necessarily prove him ourselves but we've experienced the power of God and we know Jesus Christ is alive today praise God he makes us known or He makes himself known in each way uh or each one of our lives in a unique way each one each one of us have a unique testimony praise God like us and God allowed him to get get into the depths of of addiction and then then Jesus Christ brings them out of that praise God Saves them from a certain death and and suicide attempts and all these things and just say he rescues him out of there it's the power of Jesus Christ to change your life amen hallelujah it's just a beautiful thing and each one of us you know I was I was raised in poverty and and uh uh and went to college up here to play football for Akron and almost seemed like I had the whole world in front of me you know that but then God takes takes my health and and uh brings me to Christ and now I preach the gospel praise God so from a poverty-stricken uh sinner complete sinner into a real servant of Jesus Christ praise God it's a great testimony praise God although each one of us have a unique testimony Hallelujah and God is reveals himself in each person's life and he asks each person to shine the light of Jesus Christ praise God and so that's what we're here today and as always to serve the Lord Jesus Christ now these seven candlesticks are represented by these seven time periods one two three four five six seven okay so each each of those candlesticks represent a different time period here we are we're in 2022. uh here we are in the time period we're in the laodicean church age or we're in the the time of laodicea the Bible calls it uh where the the word uh laodicea means the people's rights we're in an age where people have more rights than ever but they're choosing the right to do sin rather than the right to do the Bible ways God's ways uh they're they're they're they're they're choosing now uh there's a law in in California now to have abortions 28 days after birth after birth yeah it's there it's it was on the ballot if I'm not mistaken it's true after now if you've ever seen what happens in a real abortion it's horrific it's completely it takes a demon-possessed person to do something like that it's just incredibly incredibly Wicked and we're recently reminded of that we saw a little video of that recently just it's incredibly heartbreaking I started crying it's just it's incredibly Wicked but that's what word and that's what we're the age and the right so people have a right even if you're a human you have a right to call yourself a tree or a bird or you have the right as a man to call yourself a woman or a woman to call himself a man it's it's insanity but that's the age that we're living in it's people's rights they want their own rights to live in sin and and reject the Bible and reject God's truth uh they want that right and so they're allowed that right but we've got a right to live in Holiness praise God Amen we've got a right to obey the Bible praise God and show the love of Jesus Christ where where the world is filled with love for sin and love for wickedness but we have a love for the truth we have a love for Holiness praise God we have a love for treating one another with true Godly respects Hallelujah and a real a real Christian Life Hallelujah the only real life there is is a Christian Life Hallelujah ever other life is selfish and uh self-serving praise God and will end in separation from God in the Lake of Fire but a life that serves God a life that loves Jesus Christ will live eternally praise God amen amen hallelujah so each of these each of these time periods was one of those seven candlesticks that we saw so Ephesus amurna uh pergamos thyrotera Sardis Philadelphia laodicea each one of those represents a uh a time period and then the stars represent a man I'm gonna try to get to this one I'm gonna have to skip that that's got motions on it but this is what I want to get to next so each of the Stars was a man Paul was a mighty of course an extremely mighty man of God we'd say in humility iranius marked in Columba Martin Luther John Wesley We Believe William Branham was the last messenger here to the the seven Church ages so I just want to meditate on this here thought for just a moment here by the grace of God let me set a timer here and we'll just try to review this here now the section I want to look at tonight is the gaining and losing and restoring of Truth during the church ages so before getting into the church ages I think it's important for you to see by the scripture that Jesus gave the church so much truth that's what this white represents here the white represents truth that Jesus gave to them right but by the end of the age they lost some of that truth right the Believers have started compromising not not the True Believers right but but we'd say the the foolish virgin they started compromising the real Holy Ghost believer they'll never compromise on anything praise God hallelujah amen but it's those that are not born again they're the ones that will compromise on the word of God hallelujah but a real born-again child of God how can you compromise when Jesus Christ permanently lives in your soul praise God it's impossible to compromise amen it's impossible because Jesus the Bible said Jesus will guide us into all truth praise God we're not finding less truth we're finding more truth amen amen every service every video we put out or whatever on YouTube everything we're finding more truth in the scriptures we're finding more ways to live holy amen we're finding more Victory Hallelujah more more strength amen are there more promises amen we find more Victory amen we find more and more we can find more truth all the time that's the plan of a Believer we are so in other words we're in that last day you and I are the light praise God we're the small group that has the light of Truth uh Paul says the light of Life another way to say it praise God the light of life so we're going to see this we're going to see how the truth slowly diminished over the course of all these years and then it was a little bit restored and then just a little bit at the end time this is how Jesus describes the seven Church ages it's completely accurate it's completely scriptural praise God as you study the Book of Revelation chapters two and three all right now it was uh God's desire to give the light and then God's desire to restore the light okay because God is showing something with this God's showing something with losing strength and then regaining strength God is showing something there God is showing he's a god of restoration praise God hallelujah he always does that now we know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but Jesus never said the church is the same yesterday today and forever and that's what the church ages prove the church would change right there would be a different uh they would lose some truce we're going to get to a little bit they would lose some things they would miss out they would miss uh different Revelations they would lose track but they would stay true to God's word they would as much as they knew they would stay true to that it's all it's all plain right there in the Book of Revelation but then Jesus says I'm going to restore all that at the end time we're not living in a season of loss we're living in a season of gain praise God I'll say like this we're living in the last season of gain amen we're living in the last time when we're going to have the truth restored when we our questions will be answered praise God hallelujah when the seals are taken off the book Church we're living in the age of the open book praise God the Bible is not a spiritually closed book to us where we we look at it and we don't understand we understand the Bible and we can point to the Bible and tell and tell these Mysteries and how they've been revealed we can tell the true Doctrine we can TR we can tell how man lives by every word of God that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen we can tell how the Saints live we can tell how how how the how they were led by the Holy Spirit how they had the teaching how they lived their lives and we can look at our lives and say it's exactly the same today praise God hallelujah amen that's exactly right I believe that now Jesus calls these men stars and I just want to look at a few verses because this is a time of great Darkness upon the Earth it's a time of spiritual Darkness now if you got your Bibles uh let's go to Acts Chapter 13 Verse 47 just swear so you can see where I love it Jesus Christ says there's going to be seven Angel stars and then Jesus Christ calls the first one Paul a light to the Gentiles Hallelujah so that gives us continuity or that gives us the same Revelation uh in the book of Acts as in the Book of Revelation so acts 13 47. Linda you want to read that and I can tell you got it thank you amen hallelujah isn't that beautiful Jesus says I'm setting you as a light to the Nations praise God is that right a light to the Nations Paul Paul a former man who was Stand By and Watch Christians murdered now instead of watching them murdered uh he's trying to save their lives praise God he's trying to get them out of prison right he's trying to rescue them a man that used to hate Christians now he loves Christians and now he was Darkness but now he's light praise God Jesus called him to be light Jesus called you and I to be light as well praise God thank the Lord now I'm going to go to chapter 26 verse 18 and 23. 26 18 and 23. Jesus says it again 26 18-23 to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me so the gospel takes you from total darkness spiritual Darkness a life of lying and stealing right and cussing and and Witchcraft right and drug addiction it takes you from a life of sexual immorality sexual sin it takes you from a life of Darkness into a life of Holiness praise God it takes you from Darkness to life that's what the real gospel does amen hallelujah the fact is most churches are not real churches the fact is most churches are are deceived churches they're actually synagogues of Satan because they deny the very word of God that Jesus said praise God they deny the light that Jesus sent through Paul and John and Peter thank God for the light praise God the fact that we have the life shows we are children of the light amen because we live the light we preach the light amen hallelujah We Share the Light Hallelujah we love the life our lives are the light of the world Amen Gloria Hallelujah verse 23. that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should arise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles how many lead Paul was the light of the age you say you're the light you're the light in darkness and you're going to shine the light to the Nations sound like sounds like a light to me praise God Hallelujah so we can see it and Jesus says I am the light of the world in John 8 12 you don't have to turn there he that filed me listen shall not walk in darkness that's how you know if you're following Christ you're not walking in darkness you're walking in the light praise God you can see I'm not walking in sin I'm walking in obedience to the word of God I know where I'm walking amen because the light is shining on my path Hallelujah I know where I'm walking I know where I'm going this world is Darkness this world is all spiritual Darkness praise God but Jesus Christ is the light of the world and then his light shines through each one of us and then we are light to others praise God amen now we've begun We Begin this church age with uh the book of Acts begins with all the power and all the word praise God and we know we're not going to go there but we know Joel 2 23-26 says I will restore all that they had the beginning through the former rain the latter rain uh Joel says I'll restore saith the Lord he said their Vats will be full of wine and oil praise God Amen they'll not be ashamed of the Gospel Hallelujah so we know the beginning and the end will have the restoration now there was a lot of Believers there's a lot less Believers today Jesus said few there be that find it at the end time okay so there's a lot more Believers a lot less Believers today but the fact is the same that they'll have the same power the same word the same manifestations the same truth the same life it's the same holiday all the time Hallelujah thank God it's the same light all the time praise God the light of the world Jesus Christ Hallelujah now in between though we see there's going to be a time where we're lacking the fullness of the word and Power here so between these we have a lack of the word and the power because Jesus said I'll restore right I'll restore saith the Lord now at Pentecost at the beginning of the church they had full word and full power we know they had the full word of God because uh the these disciples wrote down the four gospels Paul wrote 13 let us think of that 13 letters ah I only got two books out Paul had 13 letters out that were thus saith though mine aren't even thus say the Lord but Paul 13 thus saith the Lord letters my it's amazing wrote most of the New Testament Canon there as far as the doctrine and number of letters but they also have the fullness of power lame men were healed at the beginning praise God people were healed just by getting in the shadow of Peter praise God now Church Jesus is the same today if you come to church like that if you in other words if you find the perfect will of God for healing if you find the perfect will of God there's nothing going to stop the perfect will of God for moving on your behalf amen we saw that with sister Marie right when she was bleeding she come to church you just she just knew it was going to happen and then she stopped bleeding right during the service because that's what Jesus does amen hallelujah because it was that it was her perfect it was it was the perfect will of God for that time to get the miracle now she started to suffer all those whatever they were months or years she said to suffer with the bleeding but when it came time I love it it was the right time the right anointing the right word of the right amount of faith in other words God will give you sufficient amount of Grace for the sufficient hour praise God hey man in other words God is going to prepare you for these Works God is going to make sure these Works come to pass because his word cannot fail praise God and he and he will show up in your life he will prove the member of the Bible said eventually he'll have everybody bowed down at the feet of the Believers remember we preached on that last month eventually everyone's got to bow down but even in your life God will prove in your life to others that you are the True Believer praise God just because you're so and so I'm gonna let you change days that you work praise God just because of of who you are praise God amen now they had all the power they had the Bible said they had great Witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus let's read that acts 4 33. Malachi you want to get that acts 4 33. now see Church the early apostles were given this lying anointing it was this bold great power right we all want to see more power we're praying we're believing for more power we believe that will be restored praise God we can see it in our lives praise God but this early church had this line anointing so we got to look at the line anointing and kind of compare it to the eagle anointing this is more for our church you know the uh our regular church not for our visitor you know we got to see they're both spiritual Powers praise God but they're slightly different just like The Lion and the ox are slightly different right just like the the ox and the man are slightly different but then you have the eagle the Flying Eagle anointing but look at uh Malachi you read that acts 4 33. litmus of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon the wall all right so great power they were had this great lion power praise God the line of the tribal Judah Jesus Christ Hallelujah and God gave that to them but you find as we go through the church ages we see less and less of the power less and less of the truth but then God starts restoring a church we must never feel bad where God placed Us in this thing right some of us wish we could live in here you know maybe I would I'd say I wish we could live there and seen all the great power and demonstration and things like that well that was for their day but God chose for me to live in this day praise God and so I've got to get under the anointing of the holy spirit for this day be as faithful as I can to it be as diligent the Bible said make your calling and election sure praise God give all your heart soul mind is Right fall under the anointing of this spiritual ego ego has a great eyesight Eagles can watch Eagles can see Eagles Fly Above the world and that's the anointing that we have we're setting in Heavenly places we not we're we're not going to be the sons of God someday we're the sons of God right now praise God Amen now you're not one day I'm a daughter of God you always were a daughter of God Amen and when the spirit of God is on you and then when you're walking the power of God then you're walking as a son and daughter of God and you're led by the holy spirit amen Hallelujah thank you Jesus and then Peter said we have all things that pertain to life and godliness so all the spiritual uh blessings that we need today are available to us uh and then remember when Paul was there in Ephesus at the beginning Paul declared the whole Council of God to them in three years now of course he didn't he didn't have to preach the Book of Revelation right because it wasn't even written yet so I don't know if you need another year to preach Revelation or not but I could preach it may be shorter than that but it took three years to give him or for him to give the whole counsel of God now it's true church not all the churches had all the letters at the beginning but what they did have was the Holy Ghost praise God and I'll say like this the Holy Ghost is sufficient the Holy Ghost can make you live these words even if you don't even know what they are and the church said Hallelujah the Bible is a blessing but it's not absolutely absolutely necessary to live the Christian life because they didn't have all those letters at the beginning they didn't write Matthew Mark or Luke and John Joe 30 or 40 50 years after Jesus already left what were they feasting on their prayer lives amen hallelujah the writings of the prophets amen the Old Testament and God was sufficient even though they felt like or even though we might think they didn't have enough they had plenty because they had Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah that'll encourage us Church we've got Bibles we've got phones we've got everything we got everything we could possibly want so we need more of Jesus praise God that ought to be encouragement to us and Jesus word was still true he said I'll still guide you into all truth even though they didn't have all the New Testament Canon we'd say most of those people at the early church on the day of Pentecost Brothers they never got to read the book of Revelation because they already died and passed on right that was 30 A.D 30 A.D The Book of Revelation wasn't coming for 60 or 70 more years but could they live a Christian Life absolutely praise God why because Jesus lived inside of them Jesus took his Abode in in their souls Hallelujah Hallelujah and then he lived his life through them that's what we did they let Christ live his life through us hallelujah but thank God we got a whole bunch of reminders right here that they didn't have Hallelujah no Jesus had said all things must be restored so let's read that Matthew 17 11 uh brother uh Austin you want to read that when you get that acts 17 11. I'm sorry Matthew 17 11 I'm sorry Matthew I always mix those up I guess I mix that one on the podcast one time Matthew 17 11. here Jesus says all things must be restored before the end time answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come store all things all right thank you brother praise God so a man with the spirit of Elijah has to restore all things this could not be uh Elijah the tishbite to come back from the dead to restore Moses's law because Hebrews 8 says the law is decaying wax old and Vanishing away that's what Hebrews 8 13 says so Jesus is speaking about another man who had the spirit of Elijah to restore the New Testament truce praise God hallelujah that's exactly what we'll see in the Book of Revelation chapter 11 right Moses and Elijah they're not going to point to the law they're going to point to Jesus praise God they're going to prepare them to receive what the Gentiles just gave back or what God took from the Gentiles and he grafted the the Jews back into it he's going to get them ready for Christ praise God Hallelujah now next we're not going to go through these just for time's sake because I want to get to some of these other uh visuals here tonight but if we read Daniel 12 verse 4 Daniel 12 verse 9 with Revelation 10 7 1-11 and Matthew 24 verse 14. we come to this conclusion the end of human history cannot come until the mystery of God is finished and preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations amen this can only happen in the age of Technology right because let's read Daniel 12 verse 4 though let's read that Daniel 12 4. sister who would you want to read that when you get that thank you Daniel 12 verse 4. so this scripture speaks of the technology age amen thank you sister so the book is closed the Bible gives a symbolism like it's sealed up no one's going to really understand this book until the time of the end when knowledge is increased praise God where they can now send people up to space every day they can make strips to space and come back if they want to right they have that they have that knowledge right you can fly around the world and how many hours can you get around the world now anybody know I forget but it was it's not very it's not very long especially if you're in the military you can go pretty fast break the sound barrier knowledge has increased and but this is the time when God's word is restored praise God also I was looking up about the Industrial Revolution for our day and and yeah our our uh our lifespan is now about 75 to 80 years that's twice what it was before the Industrial Age so before Henry Ford and the Model T right before this time when knowledge is increased and we have assembly lines and just now it's unheard of robots on assembly lines not humans robots right knowledge has increased at this time and so this is the age of people's rights this is the age of the end time at this time the Bible has to be made known amen Glory now I also want to read Ecclesiastes 3 verse 6. Ecclesiastes 3 verse 6. I'll try to get there by God's grace because the Bible does say there is a season a time to give and a time to lose Ecclesiastes 3 verse 6. a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away so here we we all know there's times to get and lose in the natural those are sometimes hard Seasons right but they're good they're good teachers and so it is in the spiritual there's a time to get spiritual things but there's a time to lose spiritual things and that's what we see in the church ages they would begin losing some truce okay I want to maybe look at uh some of these here uh in just a moment now they would begin losing through the first four one two three four the first four ages they would begin losing the truce the power the revelation and part of that of course was due to the Roman Catholic Church destroying all the Bibles or most of the Bibles in the people's language right but restoration will begin in the fifth sixth and seventh you'd have restoration now this is like an unto a corn of wheat let's go to John 12 24 if you have your Bible John 12 24. John 12 24. so this losing and then gaining again is likened unto the death of a seed a death has to be buried it has to rot and then it has to then it brings forth life and so that's what God is showing in the seven Church ages he's showing the life of a seed praise God verse 24 verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit Hallelujah and that's what we see in the church ages it started off as a great a great strong plant but then it slowly Withers away and it's almost cut off it almost dies completely in the fourth age it's called the Dark Ages the depths of Satan Jesus called it but then it has a little life it Springs forth uh in the last three Ages which uh wheat has three stages right the ear the stalk and the corn amen that's what we see three stages at the end praise God Amen thank God that's what Jesus said Hallelujah in The Book of Mark as well that's what he said it would be like so the church would slowly die and lose truth and grow through the first four ages when the fifth age it would begin a reformation and the seed would spring forth in strength until it would grow back and be restored in truth but then in the final age we would have all things restored According To Jesus how many believe that hallelujah praise God now in the midst of these seven Church ages though Jesus talks to both the workers of iniquity and the workers of righteousness he's talking to both groups and notice both groups are religious so that proves again it's good to go to church but it's better to do what the Bible says when you go to church praise God because if you just go to church and you know what the Bible says the Bible says you're like a wolf in sheep's clothing you look like you're real humble and sweet on the outside but inwardly you're dangerous right you're you're you're out to devour people you're ought to destroy people's lives and and just uh focus on your life and again selfish right because a wolf is a selfish creature right only hunting for themselves and they're not a humble creature like a a sheep would be humble or something like that it's a very violent and aggressive type of an animal well that's what Jesus said they're like wolves and sheep's clothing so those are workers of iniquity but we are to be workers of righteousness Hallelujah amen now I want to take a moment here let me just break off into this here and we'll kind of see how far I go here but let me see I thought I tried to save some of these Pages here I just thought since we had Chris as a visitor here I told him we have this YouTube channel um I just wanted to see some of the here's some of the things the church has lost okay now my most popular or our most popular event I always say are because I couldn't do without all your support our most popular video only has 300 000 views but is makeup in the Bible the Bible says makeup is wrong the Bible said makeup is a sin because it's a prideful thing for a woman to put on makeup or a man now today probably just mentioned just as many men put on makeup as women do almost probably it's so sad it's so so it's so sad why would someone need to put on makeup if God gave them a beautiful face why would you why would they need that the Bible says you're already fearfully and wonderfully made but see Satan pressures you oh you're not you're not pretty enough for you've got to look like this movie star no you don't need that because that movie star is not after Christ that movie stars after money right or selfish ambitions but that's so that's kind of what uh uh that's one truth that's been lost and the Bible actually calls that modesty let's look at that let's look at First Timothy chapter two if you got your Bible First Timothy 2. First Timothy 2. verse nine First Timothy 2 verse 9. all right it says in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame-facedenness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works now we'll just stop right there now there's a whole lot in those two verses right there there's a lot in there but again the pressure to spend lots of money to make yourself look so rich or so uh so successful right costly costly necklaces costly Rings costly jewelry right and what the Bible says we have must wear modest clothing right modest and shame-based innocent so not a proud face like look look look or watch my watch my YouTube video and I'll show you how to paint a certain kind of a face and they get millions and millions of views on that that shame faces that's not humility that's Pride that's vanity praise God see they don't obey the word of God now there's three times in the Old Testament where God condemned makeup but we don't have time to read that but you can watch that video brother if you like to Chris by God's grace long hair the Bible says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair the New Testament says women should not cut their hair and men should not let their hair grow long right women should have long hair men should have short hair that's the Bible God never asked a Godly woman to cut her hair okay so these are the things the church has lost the church has lost this there's books been written about it I wrote a book about it I mean it's been lost but the church is getting it back today hallelujah amen it's restoring Christian modesty Hallelujah that's a pretty good title there no this that one's on kind of understate the Lord this is on cross-dressing the Bible says we should have different garments for men and women but now what do they do they mix it today right and mix it today and now they can change their gender or whatever it's ridiculous it's against the Bible and the Bible calls that an Abomination it's a disgusting thing in the sight of God and and understand we love all these Sinners brother Chris we love all them but we got to preach it hard because that's the truth and their voices are so loud we got to get God's voice out there too right yeah that's right God did that amen God did that why chromosome amen that's right and then there's a video about uh modest clothing the next one is serpent seed in the Garden of Eden Even Adam did not eat an apple there's nothing in the Bible that says they ate apple right they had a sexual adulterous affair Eve had adultery with the serpent because the serpent was a standing up creature in the Bible and It produced a hybrid Offspring named Kane right and God said there's two different offsprings if you read Genesis let's read Genesis 3 15. God said there are two different offsprings in the in in the world now today they're all mixed so now it's not a you're it's not your natural seed line now it's your spiritual seed line Genesis chapter 3 verse 15. this has been lost now some people misuse this Doctrine for racism purposes it's awful it's so awful but the reality of it is is that there was two offsprings in the Garden of Eden there's an offspring of the serpent which was a man like being but then God cursed him on his belly like he is today but then there's also the Godly Offspring Adam and Eve did come together and did have a son right Abel and then he died of course Cain killed him the serpency killed the righteous seed and then but then God raised up Seth right fast forward 20 uh 2500 years they're all intermarried and it doesn't matter who you're born of anymore and neither does it matter today who your mom or who your dad is it matters who your spiritual daddy is amen hallelujah praise God doesn't matter who your mom or dad is it matters do you is God your father and if he is that you'll live the life that he gave you praise God you live the life that he gave you in the word of God you'll you'll have the seed of you receive that the Bible says you receive the seed of God Amen then you're born again by The Incorruptible the Eternal the spiritual seed of God hallelujah hallelujah so Genesis 3 15 God himself said there's two different offsprings and an apple doesn't produce two offsprings if it does let's do it today right let's show me today where apples can produce two different kinds of families you're not going to find that right and the Bible said another place Cain was not of Adam Cain was of the wicked one his daddy was a wicked person the serpent all right now we got Genesis 3 15. sorry for putting you on the spot there sister who I feel bad now so if I put you on the spot forgive me sorry I kind of felt bad about that so forgive me Lydia forgive me I don't mean to call everybody on the spot tonight here first uh Genesis 3 15. and I will put enmity which means hatred between thee God's talking to the serpent The Serpent and the woman and between the thy seed the serpent seed and her seed that seed means offspring God said I'm going to put hatred between the Serpent's Offspring and I'm sorry the woman Eve's Offspring it shall bruise thy head so God is telling the serpent Jesus Christ the woman seed is going to bruise your head on the cross hallelujah amen take all of his power away hallelujah amen and thou shalt bruise his heel so the serpent the serpent or death would strike Jesus on the cross but he would also crush the curse of death on the cross amen thank God Amen amen so there's two offsprings in the Bible that's a great mystery now jewelry there's a great balance on jewelry that's one that's misunderstood today God never asked anyone to to make themselves bleed to wear jewelry some jewelry is acceptable but anytime you make yourself bleed the Bible said anything that makes you bleed when you cut yourself to make yourself bleed the Bible says that's a demon possession those people are not filled with God's spirit because God will not cause you uh to destroy your own body that's not God's not behind that right in the Bible anybody with demons on them they cut themselves all the time right people do that today right God never asked anyone to do that that's been lost but the church today or the the church is out there not our church the churches out there are filled with people like that because it's been lost oh my thank God that He restored this is making me more happy for restoration than I think I ever have been amen hallelujah you see it Church you see it now the Bible said there was high heels in the Old Testament we actually did a bible study on that a couple weeks ago we're not going to go that but high heels pushes up the woman right pushes up the woman so it pushes up her her body parts makes her more attractive to the man she's more of a object of Temptation okay anybody could see that any man could see that right it's that's a sin that's sin uh now the trinity the Trinity is a lie God is not three persons God's one person it's not even logical how can three people be one person I'll sit by brother amen how could us three be one person it's impossible we're three separate persons right you're not exactly like your husband right sister but amen you're not exactly like your wife right but most churches say today three persons are one God it's nonsense it's not even in the Bible it's a complete lie but that was lost down Through the Ages but today we have the truth restored amen amen and along with that when you be baptized you don't call on the titles of god father son of the Holy Ghost you call on the name of Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's been lost but today a priest will sprinkle you with water and say you're baptized baptized means to immerse amen the actual word baptism means to immerse you put you underwater it doesn't mean to sprinkle no one was ever sprinkled in the Bible with water they were sprinkled with blood in the Old Testament but now in the New Testament it's not a it's not a sprinkling of water it's an immersion in water that you go completely under the water and we say I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the Bible Way praise God it's been lost next the Roman Catholic Church is a mystery the Roman Catholic Church is the most guilty of all churches of sin she sits on Seven Hills she worships statues the priests are pedophiles most of them it's just it's some of the most wicked things so are the nuns so many of the nuns it's just uh I got I got a whole chapter on it I gotta so so Chris if you want to some good reading I got some good reading for you here I don't know if you're a reader or not but hallelujah it's gonna it's gonna help you it's really gonna help you it's really going to help you but I got a whole chapter on this we again we love Roman Catholics but we're calling them to come out of that because that's what Jesus said come out of her my people that's that's where our voice is to call them out because if not you are potato our partaker in their wickedness and their sins and iniquities okay the Rapture is a great mystery I'm not going to look into that one here's a good one uh Chris you might like most churches say hell lasts eternally but that's wrong hell is not Eternal according to the Bible God's not going to torment people without end how could God torment people for millions of years when they only sinned for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 or 70. what kind of God would do that you wouldn't do that right if so if if one of your loved ones robbed a bank or killed somebody or something like that you don't want them in jail rotting away their whole life you want them to have mercy you want to end at some point what kind of person who wanted to be God would never do that and the Bible makes it clear amen let's read it amen it's first John no murder has eternal life hallelujah amen First John 3 15. first John it's in the back of the Bible it's just it's just such a contradiction the same people that say he's the god of love he's got to love he's got gotta love yet if you disobey him you got to burn eternally that's not love that's not love yeah debunk what do you mean by debunk can you explain that yes yes they haven't uh spent enough time in prayer seeking God because Jesus said if you ask and seek you will find it they're not spending enough time seeking the word of God see they get distracted by Sports they get distracted by movies they get distracted by careers instead of Jesus said if you want to find the truth he said you've got to search for it like gold now I've never sought gold right I've never been there but you read about it and they would just dig dig dig until they Struck it that's how a Christian is we dig dig till we strike it amen did we find something real praise God because they're trained like in a school rather they're training to school and then they just go out and do what everybody else does but how do they know the school is right did Jesus set up that school no so yeah that's a great question brother great question so it's not Eternal so let's read that first John brother also you want to read that brother First John 3 15. well I'm sorry it's wrong first First John 3 15. I'm sorry was that John 3 15. first John oh I'm sorry yeah you're good whosoever hated his brother is a murderer and you know Murder huh eternal life abiding you amen thank you sir anyone who goes to hell is a murderer does not have eternal life so they cannot live eternally that is just simple logic it's completely uh common sense you cannot live eternally unless you have eternal life you cannot have eternal life unless you have Jesus Christ praise God amen so we see it's a great revelation another one is there's no women preachers in the Bible so that's an important Revelation there as well so I may I may just because maybe do about 20 more minutes here by God's grace yeah thank you sir let me pull up this one too I want to show another one here this would be a great one for Chris and good reminder for us all I found in these last few years of you know debating and and interacting with people that uh uh disbelieve the word of God or they get a lot of mix-up is they don't understand that man has three parts okay every every person every human being has three parts okay so if you can catch us tonight Chris you've caught a good you've caught a good thing okay each one of us has three parts let's read uh first Thessalonians 5 23. what was your other friend brother Austin that came over on the remember we witnessed to him Sam Sam this is what helped Brother Sam no we'll keep praying for him but this scripture really helped him first Thessalonians 5 23 Lydia you got that on can you read that thank you congratulations amen so Jesus wants to preserve all these blameless Jesus wants to make you uh forgiven in every area your body your spirit or mind and your soul this is such a crucial thing to understand okay so God's spirit can fall on all three parts but then God's spirit can leave two of those parts one of them it never leaves okay and this is why it's so so confusing people can live good for a certain amount of years and then totally turn away and be and live like a devil that's because the spirit of God never got into the deepest part of their being they didn't let God all the way into their life they kept some of the areas of their life from God they didn't want God to get into those eras usually it's money right or relationships right a husband or a wife or a second husband or second third husband third wife something like that something that's selfish like that see they get the Holy Spirit on their body they feel they'll cry they'll speak in tongues they'll shout they'll screen their prophesy they'll dance around the church or something like that but then that spirit is going to leave and if they don't have God's word in their mind then their mind is going to go back to the things of the world but some people can get it in their mind and know a little bit about God like you're talking about and but they'll warn you and say if you don't get saved you're going to burn eternally well that's because they never really got down God never got deep and down enough into their soul to show them that that's not God's nature praise God 's not going to destroy people for Eternal eternity God's not going to let them suffer eternally okay but see God's got to get deeper down and and the more you open up yourself to God the more God can show himself in your life and then what Jesus called it when you let God in all the way Jesus called it the baptism of the Holy Spirit In other words God's spirit comes in there and fills up your soul praise God that's what Jesus said amen your soul is immersed in the spirit of God hallelujah that's exactly what the word of God says amen now murderers they can have God's spirit out here they can feel good they can live clean but then they can this anointing will leave and they'll go out and murder right now if they repent of that then they can be saved they can still be saved because they've accepted God in their minds but they've got to let God clean them out totally clean out their minds totally and then God will come into their soul so God's trying to work from the outside in right God's trying to clean out clean out your actions your mind and then God wants to live in your soul praise God Hallelujah that's right that's exactly what Jesus says he says your soul must be baptized with the Holy Ghost right amen that's a great Revelation right there it's a great mystery people don't understand if they repent yeah if they repent now that means like repent means to three things repent means uh to make amends for your sin so if you can do some if you can right or wrong you did that's one of the things hate your sin is the second one and the third thing is change your mind about your sin so repentance actually has three parts to it so if somebody who is the worst of the worst could actually do all those three things yes they could be saved okay that's a great question Chris great great question Hallelujah all right how am I doing here okay doing good by God's grace okay so we can see these are a lot of the truths that were lost here down through the down Through the Ages the church lost and that's why churches today lack so much they haven't received the restoration of the word of God everything I've showed you is in the Bible but they don't believe it yet they carry Bibles to church like you do they sit in here preaching like you do but they don't believe the whole book but we're Believers of the whole book amen all of it praise God like I was telling my brother I was talking to a preacher on the way to church or on the way from home for work I was saying I said I'm not afraid of any question I don't have the answer to every question but I'm not afraid if I've got the truth I'm not afraid to show the truth aren't afraid of a question right if I've got the truth if I've got gold I'm not afraid to put that gold in the fire Amen Let It Burn praise God because it's going to come out more gold because it's actually going to come out with more Purity amen get more of the drops out praise God so the more we answer questions by the Bible the more truth we actually gain we can't run from questions we have to accept them we have to let the spirit of God guide us into more truth praise God amen now here's a great problem the Bible says uh what what the problem with some people that come to church they try to come to Christ but they don't depart from iniquity so let's look at that one here he that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity that's second Timothy 2 19. I just thought I'd show this people can get a good start serving Jesus but if if they don't keep the spirit of God coming in deeper and deeper if they don't let more of God in then they'll start picking up bad habits again like I said like sexual sins or drug addictions okay any Pleasures any lusts of the world they'll let that in and they won't let God clean out their lives so God can't come in because they keep their life so dirty and filthy all right that's quite plain to say that but that's about as plain as I know how to say it II Timothy 2 19. nevertheless the foundation of God's standeth Shore having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his in other words God knows the real believer aren't you glad he knows your church all right so God he knows your name he knows your address praise God he knows your desires Hallelujah he knows everything you need amen and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity okay iniquity is purposeful sinning right lawlessness well I can just do whatever I want Jesus Loves Me I can sin enjoy all the sins I want no you can't you're not letting the spirit of God into your being you're actually pushing him out when you sin right the Bible says every time it's we sin it's a spirit of Disobedience every time we sin we're letting the devil's thoughts in so we got to kick those thoughts out we got to let God thoughts in praise God Hallelujah a lot of different ways we could go but I hope you can see it by God's grace we can see how the truth or the churches today not ours but churches today are not accepting the restoration preached from the Bible Hallelujah but God said this was the time he was going to restore it at the time when knowledge is increased oh my Hallelujah when they can stick a wire up Jose's arteries and clear out his his stroke and his heart attack they can stick a wire up there and do the work a wire in the veins now if that's not knowledge increased I don't know what it is how do you do that how in the world can you do that knowledge has increased and so that's what we that's where we live in that we're living in this time here now let me bring this down in a place to close here it's almost 8 30 here by God's grace okay so God said let me get back to another picture here we'll close with that thought oh just so you know Chris here this God in the beginning God wants us to cover from our shoulders down to our shins just you know that's in the Bible I can show you but see most people walk around today like this in the summertime right so it's in the Bible it's all it's all through there but the church has lost that I can go to church with sexy clothes on or no clothes on or whatever uh it's it's sin it's sin it's a Disobedience to the word of God okay so let me close with this thought here hopefully that loads we're heaven a little slow loading there okay so the church was like a seed I'll just close with that one it was a seed it had to go down to the ground and die but then it would bring forth in a restoration praise God so it started off with a lot of Believers all on fire but then slowly the truth and the number got smaller smaller smaller and then we had a little bit of Revival in the 1500s through Martin Luther John Wesley's age was was the most in these last three ages that was the age of the open door Jesus said missionary work but now I guess we're going upward I really don't know what that means I don't know what is that what does that line mean I don't know maybe we're going up I don't know somebody knows tell me praise God I must have missed it when I was listening to the sermons I missed that part see it goes up down upside I'm not sure I'm not sure that must be the restoration I don't really know all right but it's spoken to every Church age it's spoken to everyone and so there's a there's a a a fullness of the power in the word losing it gaining a little bit and then at the end we get the restoration back to the beginning Hallelujah all right now uh by the grace of God help me Jesus Hallelujah I'll think about a scripture I could close with here let's go to I just feel like I close with this one John 3 this one came to my mind John 3 16. we'll close with this one I'm sure Chris has maybe heard have you heard John 3 16 Chris for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son okay well it's great brother that's great perfect Matthew Mark Luke John it's the fourth book in the New Testament I've covered a lot of topics but I did that on purpose you know I kind of I felt it's been nice these last few months we've had a number of visitors right it's been really wonderful and uh I'm so thankful for that by God's grace John 3 16 and so uh like when Janine came or yeah Jeannie came um you know God really spoke to her there but uh you know I just want to share the truth with them so they can hear it praise God by God's grace just try to summarize it the best we can and thank you for your patience I know a lot of this is reviewed to us but I hope it's a good review by God's grace hope you enjoyed the review I always love reviewing the church ages amen hallelujah thank you God is so faithful praise God I'm so thankful how God leads us amen he just gives us right what we need at the right time John 3 16. this is probably Chris the most popular verse in the Bible actually because it summarizes what God did to save sinful lost people like us it's so beautiful this is such a beautiful beautiful scripture for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he had nothing greater to give than his son Jesus that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so God promises if you believe in my son that he is the Son of God and that he died for your sins and he rose to forgive you and fill you with power right that power we said he wants to get from the outside work his way in he said if you believe that he said I'll give you everlasting life praise God oh it's a beautiful beautiful trade praise God how could a person turn that down in their sound mind God sent his son to die for you he took your sin to give you his righteousness the Divine exchange praise God it's the most beautiful message there ever was in the face of the Earth praise God God so loved us he said his son he placed all his sin on Jesus all the sin of the entire world history was on Jesus he was beaten like no man could ever be beaten he didn't even look like a man in the face that's how bad he was beaten and he paid he was the lamb he was the sacrifice that died for us and then because all sin was placed upon him now God can put forgiveness and righteousness on all the Believers who trust in the sacrifice amen we're not getting to Heaven by our goodness praise God we're getting to Heaven by his righteousness praise God by our sacrifice he paid for our sins and so because of that like we're I'm preaching today because of that because of his sacrifice I want to obey all his Commandments how could I turn down such matches love how could I be a part of his kingdom if I don't listen to the king praise God I've got to listen to the king because the king died for me amen the king Rose for me praise God the king said his Spirit here to to work in me praise God and to prove that he's alive he's getting our people ready for our Rapture Hallelujah a Rapture means a snatching away God Jesus is going to snatch away his bride right before all the destruction comes upon the Earth Armageddon different things like that the the Great Tribulation yes sir yes sir that's exactly right fire and burnstone that's exactly right yes sir because that because you're right because the same conditions in Sodom are the same today they're just going to get more worse to be like that in Sodom Chris I don't know if you did you ever read Sodom in the Book of Genesis yes great great well if you get a chance it's Revelation I'm sorry Genesis Chapter 18 and 19. it was so bad men were in gangs going all over the city bus trying to bust into houses to have sodomy like that's I have kids here so that's that's all I can say and they even wanted Angels the Angels God sent Angels there and he put He put Flesh on them they were even going to come after the Angels but the angel struck them blind because God gave him power to protect themselves that that's how awful it was and and the the cops or the police that day let it roam and look at today how they want to defund the cops insanity so it's just it's becoming more and some of those cities are just like Sodom look at Chicago I mean they kill them they're all these deaths it's just it's just like Sodom and Gomorrah Detroit yeah yes you're very well versed on that you can see the Sodom conditions of today very good very good that's exactly what Jesus said Jesus actually said that in Luke 17. Jesus said as it was in the days of lot which was Sodom so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man you got some good got some good thoughts there brother very good thoughts very scriptural thoughts let's finish with this here Hallelujah verse 17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn The World God didn't want to condemn the world he wanted them to be saved but most of them will turn down the truth Verse 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned see once we believe in Jesus Christ we're no longer condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already see they they spend their lives living in condemnation because they won't accept Jesus Christ Well church that means we don't live in condemnation so why why do we let the devil sometimes make us live in condemnation let's live in forgiveness praise God let's live in Victory Hallelujah let's live with overcoming power praise God I'm not condemned I'm forgiven praise God amen hallelujah and yes I'm going to sin every day I'm trapped in this body right but I asked Jesus every day forgive me Father forgive me Lord God forgive me try me again verse 18. he that believe let's do the second half but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God there's power in the name of Jesus but also I think he's trying to brother Chris trying to find a key up and get to John there that's John 3 18. yeah sorry about that brother John John chapter 3. Hallelujah don't you love that the Turning of the pages of the scriptures praise God Hallelujah yes sir thank you brother now Jesus said these are remember these are red letter words I don't know if your Bible has red letter words does it oh it does beautiful praise God you got a good Bible there King James got a King James red letter Edition Hallelujah now we just read how God did not send Jesus to condemn the world but very few people are actually going to believe on him so he has to condemn them because they won't accept forgiveness they won't accept the Holy Spirit verse 19. and this is the condemnation According To Jesus that light is coming to the world and Men love what they loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so this is why God is going to condemn most of the world because God has sent light but they'd rather live in the darkness they'd rather turn off the lights and say I don't want to believe God's word I just want to live in the dark I just want to live in sin and that's why God is going to condemn sinners because they won't let the light in praise God verse 20 for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light so these are these people hate the Bible they hate God they hate the truth when you tell them the truth they want to shut you down on social media they want to ban you right they want to they want to buy them they want to bomb you right they literally want to kill you we beat you up hurt you run you over with a car because they hate the light they hate the truth their lives are led by hatred but our lives
