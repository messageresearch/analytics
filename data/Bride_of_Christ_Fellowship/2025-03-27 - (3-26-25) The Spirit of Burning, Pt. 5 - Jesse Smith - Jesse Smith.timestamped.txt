[0:00] Thank you, sir. Good to see you
[0:02] tonight. So, we're looking at the spirit
[0:04] of burning tonight. This is part five.
[0:06] And at the end, I got a real just a real
[0:07] sweet little special testimony I'll
[0:09] share at the end by God's grace. So,
[0:11] thankful for God's amazing
[0:13] grace. Trust the series has been a
[0:15] blessing to you. It's been a refreshing
[0:17] to me and uh the testimony is about is
[0:20] about that as well. I'm
[0:23] sorry. Luke chapter 24, we'll go to
[0:25] verse 26. by God's
[0:34] grace.
[0:40] 24:26. Just want to start here and then
[0:42] by God's grace we'll
[0:44] move to Psalm 39 in just a moment. But
[0:47] let's read two verses here in Luke 24.
[0:50] 24:26.
[1:05] 246. Let's uh let's read 26 together.
[1:09] Can we read that together? On three. 1 2
[1:11] 3. Ought not Christ to have suffered
[1:14] these things and to enter into his
[1:18] glory? If you go down now to verse 46,
[1:22] uh later as Jesus meets with the other
[1:25] disciples that night on resurrection
[1:27] night in verse 46, he talks about the
[1:30] suffering again. Suffering again. Verse
[1:33] 46. Let's read that on three. One, two,
[1:36] three. And said unto them, thus it is
[1:39] written and thus it behooved Christ to
[1:42] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[1:45] third day.
[1:47] Now this whole uh series has been about
[1:49] the spirit of burning. Hallelujah. And
[1:52] we saw that in the scripture where uh
[1:54] they said they their hearts were burning
[1:56] in verse 32. They said one unto another,
[1:58] "Did not our heart burn within us while
[2:00] he talked with us by the way and while
[2:03] he opened to us the scriptures?" Praise
[2:05] God. So now if you turn your Bibles
[2:08] there to Psalm 39, please. Psalm 39.
[2:12] I wasn't planning on preaching this
[2:13] today till I got deeper in study and
[2:16] kind of felt the the tug of the Holy
[2:18] Spirit. It's just something to just
[2:20] experience as a minister uh tugs you a
[2:22] certain way. You know, you feel a
[2:24] certain way, but then all these things
[2:26] start uh opening up, it seems. And so,
[2:28] I'm just trying to follow the leading of
[2:29] the Lord tonight. I trust to be a help
[2:31] uh to somebody here tonight. Psalm 39
[2:37] here. Now, in verse three is what we're
[2:40] going to read there. Notice uh here
[2:41] David experiences the spirit of burning,
[2:44] right? That's what we've been looking
[2:45] at. How the spirit of God doesn't burn.
[2:47] I mean, it does burn outside of us, but
[2:49] we're looking at when it burns inside of
[2:51] us. We're looking at a inner burning.
[2:54] Praise God. This is something you can't
[2:56] prove to the skeptics, right? The
[2:57] atheists, you can't prove this to them,
[2:59] right? Like brother, like brother saw,
[3:01] the atheists, well, let me feel God. Let
[3:03] me see God. This is something brother
[3:06] Brandham said. But if you repent and
[3:07] come the same way that I came to God,
[3:09] then you would know God's real, right?
[3:11] Then you would feel the spirit of
[3:13] burning. If you repent the same way
[3:14] brother Brandham did or any believer,
[3:17] praise God. Hallelujah. So Psalm 39
[3:20] verse three. Let's read that and then
[3:21] we'll have you be seated on three. One,
[3:24] two, three. My heart was hot within me
[3:27] while I was musing the fire burned. Then
[3:31] spake I with my tongue. May God add his
[3:34] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[3:36] may be
[3:38] seated. So I will set a timer here uh
[3:41] school nights. I try to watch the time.
[3:44] So we missed you on Sunday. We had a
[3:46] great service down there in Junction
[3:47] City. And uh just tried to minister to
[3:49] them the best we could. And I'm glad
[3:51] brother Brian was led by the Holy Spirit
[3:52] to say what he said. I love that when I
[3:55] leave and somebody comes in and they
[3:56] pick up right where things I've been
[3:57] preaching. He was preaching on Isaiah 6.
[4:00] I've just been preaching on Isaiah 6. Uh
[4:02] the 11. And he's just so many things. I
[4:04] I was driving home with Caris and
[4:06] Victoria. I was just smiling the whole
[4:07] time I listen to this sermon like, "Oh
[4:08] my, God is so good. God is so faithful.
[4:10] He just knows what we have need of."
[4:12] Truly approves he's a discerner of the
[4:14] thoughts intents of our hearts. So we're
[4:16] thankful for that by God's amazing
[4:18] grace. Now, you probably want to keep
[4:19] your spot there in Psalm 39. We'll be
[4:21] coming back there. It's a very short
[4:22] chapter. We'll be coming back there here
[4:24] at the second part maybe of this service
[4:27] uh or sermon by God's grace. But let's
[4:29] go to Isaiah 4 where we learn about
[4:31] where I learned about the spirit of
[4:32] burning aresh. Of course, I've read
[4:33] through the Bible numerous times, but uh
[4:36] this particular scripture didn't strike
[4:38] me until uh last month and that's when I
[4:40] started preaching on it. I was so struck
[4:42] by this uh the the the phrase here, the
[4:45] phrase the spirit of
[4:49] burning. And so it's inspired me. I hope
[4:53] it's inspired you. And like I said, I'll
[4:54] give it a course. They don't even go to
[4:55] our church, but I'm not going to say
[4:56] their name, of course, on the live
[4:57] stream, but um if you want to know after
[4:59] service, I'll tell you. I'm sure the
[5:00] person wouldn't mind. Verse four or
[5:03] verse uh yes, verse
[5:06] four. When the Lord shall have washed
[5:09] away the filth of the daughters of Zion.
[5:11] Remember, these are those daughters with
[5:12] all the chains, the bracelets, the
[5:14] mufflers, the bonnets, the high heels,
[5:16] the rings, the nose jewels uh in chapter
[5:19] 3. Mincing as they go, prideful,
[5:23] stretched forth next, uh, wanting eyes.
[5:26] Did I say that right? How do you say it?
[5:28] Want I can never say that word right.
[5:30] Wanted. And see, tinkling with their
[5:33] feet. See, always drawing attention to
[5:34] themselves, right? That's why that's
[5:35] where we get the high heels. And of
[5:37] course, they're stretched forth necks
[5:38] and the way it props them up. And then,
[5:41] uh, that's the filth he's talking about.
[5:42] So, ver back to chapter 4, verse four.
[5:45] When the Lord washes all that filth
[5:47] away, how does he do it?
[5:50] And he shall purge the blood of
[5:52] Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
[5:54] spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
[5:57] burning.
[5:59] Hallelujah. And then the Lord will
[6:01] create Mount Zion, of course, which is
[6:03] the new Jerusalem. Praise God. How many
[6:05] looking forward to that by God's grace?
[6:06] Just this week, I might preach on
[6:07] Sunday. I saw the new Jerusalem is in
[6:10] Isaiah chapter 60. I never seen it
[6:12] before, but it's right there. Five
[6:13] examples. I maybe I'll preach that
[6:15] Sunday by the grace of God. I think I
[6:17] preached on the No, I didn't preach
[6:18] future home to you. I preached it to the
[6:19] Junction City Saints last year. Okay.
[6:22] So, now as we look down through this
[6:23] series here, uh the first one we looked
[6:25] at was in Isaiah 6. Isaiah experienced
[6:28] the spirit of burning because the Holy
[6:30] Ghost or an angel brought down a coal
[6:32] off to the fire of the altar and put it
[6:34] on his lips. And when but he had to
[6:36] first do the spirit of judgment. And
[6:38] that's that's the point we're looking at
[6:39] in this series. You have to judge
[6:41] yourself as a sinner or as uh one who
[6:45] fails, one who makes mistakes. you. In
[6:47] other words, you have to confess your
[6:49] faults first before God can clean you.
[6:51] Hallelujah. It's just like that man.
[6:53] Remember I was I said we were singing
[6:55] that song uh you know I was thinking of
[6:56] that man where Jesus said you know two
[6:58] men went down to the uh two men went
[7:00] down to the temple to pray and one man's
[7:01] like thank God I'm not like that guy and
[7:04] Jesus said he didn't get nothing from
[7:05] God. It was the guy who said God be
[7:07] merciful to me. The other guy saying how
[7:09] much I fast how much I pray. Now we
[7:11] should all do those things but when it
[7:13] becomes a brag you're in the wrong
[7:14] spirit. That's pride. That's not
[7:17] humility. That's not a true joy. Like,
[7:18] thank God. Now, we ought to have joy.
[7:20] Thank God I can fast if you can. Now, we
[7:22] don't expect the pregnant mothers to
[7:23] fast or the little children. We don't
[7:25] expect you to fast. But when you get to
[7:27] a mature age with Christ, you'll want to
[7:29] fast. The spirit of God will lead you to
[7:31] fast. Hallelujah. Because it's in the
[7:34] scripture. But, uh, the the man who was
[7:36] justified said, "God, be merciful to me.
[7:38] I can't even hardly raise my head to
[7:40] heaven, but I'm a sinner." And so,
[7:42] that's the spirit of judgment. The
[7:44] spirit of judgment came upon that man.
[7:45] He judged himself as a sinner.
[7:47] Hallelujah. And we'll always judge our
[7:50] flesh as sinful. Right? And often our
[7:52] minds, every day our minds will think
[7:54] some evil sin. And we got to confess
[7:56] that as well. But if you're born again,
[7:58] the soul can never sin because the soul
[8:00] is born again of the incorruptible seed
[8:02] of God. It's a part of God. Hallelujah.
[8:05] Your soul has a part of the living God.
[8:07] Hallelujah. Glory. So, we see the spirit
[8:10] of judgment must come on ourselves. For
[8:12] me, it was I I had to confess, you know,
[8:14] I'm guilty of hating my father and I'm
[8:16] guilty of watching too many sports and
[8:18] watching evil movies. I I'm I'm guilty
[8:20] of wasting so much time. I'm guilty of
[8:22] smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco.
[8:24] Uh and that's just as a sinner. Now,
[8:26] there's more when I become a believer,
[8:27] right? There's things there's I still I
[8:29] still fall short of God's glory. But as
[8:31] the example of getting first saved, you
[8:33] got to confess all that. Say, I've said
[8:35] evil things. I've cursed people. I've
[8:36] said awful curse words. I've said all
[8:38] these things. God, forgive me. I'm
[8:40] guilty of hell. But because of grace, I
[8:42] believe I'll be forgiven. Hallelujah.
[8:44] Because of the blood of Christ, I have a
[8:46] place in heaven. There's a place in
[8:48] heaven for me in my father's mansion.
[8:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. That's right.
[8:52] By the grace of God, not by works, lest
[8:54] any man should boast. Hallelujah. But
[8:56] then, brother Ram says, "You do works
[8:58] because of your appreciation for God."
[8:59] Hallelujah. And Brian preached, remember
[9:01] Brian preached? He said, "We should be
[9:02] zealous for good works." How many
[9:04] remember that from Sunday? So, see,
[9:06] works are not something we get excited
[9:08] for to try to make it to heaven. works
[9:10] is something we get excited about to
[9:11] please the God who's in heaven.
[9:14] Hallelujah. Glory. God bless you,
[9:16] brother. Good to see you, brother Clark.
[9:19] Hallelujah. So, we see the first one
[9:21] that we looked at in our series was
[9:23] Isaiah experienced burning to put him
[9:25] into service. And church, that's what we
[9:27] looked at. You can't even start a
[9:28] ministry till first the Holy Ghost has
[9:31] judged you and then burned out your sin
[9:33] desire. Then you're into service.
[9:36] Hallelujah.
[9:37] And so over these last few years, you
[9:39] know, we see preachers that have
[9:40] preached 30, 40 years, fall away, leave
[9:42] the message, it showed they never got
[9:44] the spirit of burning because they would
[9:46] not have left the service God called
[9:48] them to. If they had the real spirit of
[9:50] burning because you never see Isaiah
[9:52] when when they said, "We're going to saw
[9:53] you in half, Isaiah. We're going to cut
[9:55] you with saws." We don't see him uh
[9:57] recanting and saying, "No, I don't
[9:58] believe the message. I don't believe
[9:59] these visions. I don't believe uh in the
[10:01] prophecies." No, he took it because he
[10:03] was a true believer. Praise God. He
[10:06] experienced the fire of God touch his
[10:07] mouth. Hallelujah.
[10:10] Glory. So see the spirit of burning puts
[10:13] you into service.
[10:15] Hallelujah. And then we looked at
[10:17] Jeremiah in our series. He also uh
[10:20] experienced burning. He said it's like
[10:22] fire shut up in my bones.
[10:25] Hallelujah. But that wasn't to put him
[10:27] into service. That was to keep him from
[10:29] quitting his service. Because in the
[10:32] verse, he said, I he said, uh uh I got
[10:35] to the spot, I'm not even going to talk
[10:36] about God anymore because of all my
[10:38] stocks I'm in and the persecution. I'm
[10:40] done preaching for God. I'm done
[10:41] prophesying. But the Holy Ghost came on
[10:43] him and said, uh that he's going to be
[10:45] burning again. And he said, I've got to
[10:47] speak for God. I feel it inside of me.
[10:49] Praise God. So that shows when you're at
[10:51] your weakest physically, call out to
[10:54] God, and God will send the fire to put
[10:56] you back into service. Hallelujah.
[10:58] That's right, church. Keep you from
[11:00] quitting. And we saw brother Ram
[11:01] happened the same thing to brother
[11:02] Random. He almost quit after Hope and
[11:05] Sharon Rose were taken off the scene. He
[11:07] almost quit. But God wouldn't let him
[11:08] quit. Hallelujah. And God won't lo God
[11:11] won't let you quit either, saints. How
[11:12] many believe that? He won't let you quit
[11:15] because he knows your heart. He knows
[11:16] you don't want to quit. We just go
[11:18] through awful mind battles. The Bible
[11:20] calls them strongholds, right? Castles.
[11:23] Uh brother calls them cl complexes. We
[11:25] just go through those. But God breaks
[11:27] every chain. Hallelujah. That's right.
[11:29] Glory to God. The third one we saw was
[11:31] just as we read tonight, Cleopus and his
[11:33] friend on that seven mile walk. It seems
[11:36] like it was about a two or two and a
[11:37] half hour walk if you're going about the
[11:39] regular
[11:40] pace. And they were so discouraged.
[11:42] Brother calls them brokenhearted
[11:45] disciples. You don't have to raise your
[11:47] hand, but who's ever been there where
[11:48] you had a broken heart and you thought
[11:50] you you thought all hope was gone,
[11:52] right? And so what does the what does
[11:55] God do? He himself comes in the form of
[11:58] his son. Praise God. steps out and
[12:00] starts preaching to them about himself.
[12:03] Praise God. And by the end of it, they
[12:05] invite him in. They say, "Don't leave
[12:06] us. Oh, you got to stay the night. We
[12:07] got to oh, please come eat with us." And
[12:10] then he did something that he was known
[12:11] for. He broke the bread. And in the
[12:13] breaking of the bread, the breaking of
[12:15] the food and the ministering of the
[12:17] food. That's how he was known. That's
[12:19] always how Jesus is known. When he gives
[12:21] a word to you that you need in due
[12:23] season. Praise God. That's how we know
[12:25] Jesus. Praise God. When you're
[12:27] struggling, when you're going through
[12:28] difficult times and you feel like
[12:30] quitting or there's tragedies in life
[12:32] and God comes around and gives you a
[12:33] fresh piece of bread, a fresh food,
[12:35] something for your soul that your soul
[12:37] needs. Praise God. In America, we don't
[12:39] run out of bread, but in America, we
[12:41] need spiritual bread. Hallelujah.
[12:44] So we don't starve ourselves and try to
[12:46] go to other things, worldly things uh to
[12:49] for the pleasures of this world like
[12:51] they go to Snow White or something like
[12:52] that. a bunch of nonsense trying to
[12:54] satisfy the soul with a bunch of sinful
[12:56] stuff like that. That's trash. That's
[12:59] Tommy rot that will never satisfy. It'll
[13:01] leave you wanting more of the world. But
[13:03] when you get God's word, it'll only want
[13:05] help you to want more of God's word.
[13:07] Hallelujah. Not more of the things of
[13:09] the world. Praise God.
[13:12] Hallelujah. So, Cleopus and his friend
[13:16] felt the burning to revive their service
[13:19] when they were going through doubts. And
[13:22] brother Ram said, "The Bible says the
[13:23] Holy Ghost is the dissolver of doubts."
[13:26] So if you have doubts tonight, let's
[13:27] look to Christ. Hallelujah. I can't help
[13:29] you. Only Jesus can help you.
[13:31] Hallelujah. Now, his servants can pray
[13:33] for you. They can preach and all these
[13:34] things, but it's God. You got to pull on
[13:36] God. God will give you what your heart
[13:38] desires. Hallelujah. He said, "This is
[13:40] the way." He said, "This is the
[13:42] preaching is the way to raise faith.
[13:44] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[13:46] the word of God." Hallelujah. It's God's
[13:49] way to raise faith. It's God's way to
[13:51] get the fire back in your life. Praise
[13:53] God. We all need it at times. Everybody
[13:54] should say amen sometime. Hallelujah.
[13:56] That I need the fire. I need a fire
[13:58] restored. I need the burning back in my
[14:00] life. I need a revival. Praise God.
[14:02] Everybody ought to say that at some
[14:04] point. Hallelujah. If not, you're only
[14:06] lying to yourself. Praise God. That's
[14:09] right. Now, I left off this and I just
[14:11] want to spend uh a moment here maybe
[14:14] five minutes. I'll say maybe five
[14:15] minutes. We'll see. Just mentioning that
[14:18] suffering aspect for our text. I read
[14:20] where Jesus says, "Ought not the the
[14:22] Messiah to suffer." See, they thought,
[14:24] and as we looked at it, they thought the
[14:26] Messiah was going to come in, take down
[14:28] Rome, and bring in the millennium. They
[14:30] thought it was a millennium move. Oh,
[14:33] but little did they know, God had to get
[14:34] a gentile bride. Little did they know,
[14:36] brother Claude and Patrick, you were in
[14:38] the mind of God. He couldn't start the
[14:40] millennium yet because he had to find
[14:42] you, Brother Austin. Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:44] Is that right, Brother Chris? He had to
[14:46] come looking for you. Amen. He said,
[14:48] "There's other sheep in other folds.
[14:50] I've got to bring into my fold."
[14:52] Hallelujah. Amen. He He He could have
[14:55] left us. Yes. He could have left us out
[14:56] there, Brother Chris. He could have left
[14:57] us out there amongst the goats, but his
[14:59] love constrained him to leave the 99 and
[15:02] go get his one gentile bride.
[15:04] Hallelujah. Oh my. Glory to God. So the
[15:08] apostles and all the believers in Christ
[15:10] at that time did not under understand
[15:12] the suffering of God's Messiah, God's
[15:15] servant, the branch.
[15:17] They only thought about ruling and
[15:18] reigning and restoring the kingdom, the
[15:20] natural kingdom of Israel instead of the
[15:22] spiritual kingdom of
[15:24] Christ. Look at Acts 1 vers6. I'm going
[15:27] to get you on a little exercise in your
[15:28] your wrist here tonight. Acts 16. When
[15:32] they therefore were come together, they
[15:33] asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at
[15:35] this time restore again the kingdom of
[15:37] Israel? Now, think about this. He just
[15:39] resurrected. He's showing himself alive
[15:41] like he's in a glorified body. And what
[15:44] do they want to see? They want to see a
[15:46] temple
[15:47] rebuilt and they're not even thinking
[15:49] about all these billions of people down
[15:51] through the years that have will never
[15:53] would never have a chance to receive
[15:54] Christ if Christ doesn't go to them. And
[15:57] it's okay, church. Sounds a lot like you
[15:58] and I, right? We always think about
[15:59] ourselves. And the church said, "Oh,
[16:01] good. There's a few." Amen. Some people
[16:02] honest people. Hallelujah. Right? We're
[16:05] just human. We're just uh we just think
[16:07] about ourselves too much. Right? Like
[16:09] brother Brooks used to say, "Look at a
[16:10] picture of you and who's the first
[16:12] person you look at?" yourself, not other
[16:14] people. Right? I always struck me as
[16:16] funny. I still do the same thing today.
[16:18] How's that? Is he looking okay? Like it
[16:22] matters. Like it
[16:24] matters. But of course, they're thinking
[16:26] about themselves. When is the kingdom of
[16:28] Israel? When is this going to be
[16:29] restored? Like the days of Solomon and
[16:34] greater. But of course, Jesus was doing
[16:36] something
[16:38] different. And also Luke 19:11's here.
[16:41] So we get to get you A few good
[16:42] scriptures there, hun. Luke 19:11. While
[16:45] they were listening to this, he went on
[16:47] to tell them a parable because he was
[16:49] near to Jerusalem. And the people
[16:50] thought that kingdom of God was going to
[16:53] appear once. And they're talking about
[16:55] the millennial
[16:56] kingdom, right? So he tells a story.
[16:59] He's going to take the kingdom from the
[17:00] Jews and give it to the Gentiles. And
[17:03] the Jews like knew he was talking. So
[17:05] they got mad. Are you preaching on me
[17:07] again tonight? Yes. Jesus said, "I'm
[17:09] preaching on you again tonight because
[17:11] you failed to repent." I heard a
[17:14] preacher say this week. It's such a
[17:15] truth. Jesus used some of the harshest
[17:17] words against the people that wouldn't
[17:18] repent. Den of vipers,
[17:21] hypocrites, twofold uh more the sons of
[17:25] hell than your
[17:26] fathers. I mean, if anybody was harsh
[17:28] against hypocrisy and false religion, it
[17:31] was Christ. So, Christ servants will do
[17:33] some of the same. Praise God.
[17:36] I couldn't. So, it was expected. They
[17:40] were expecting the millennium. Oh, this
[17:42] is time for the millennium, saints,
[17:43] which that's an okay thing. But they
[17:45] didn't know the mystery. Ephesians 3
[17:46] says it was the mystery of God breaking
[17:48] down the wall between the Jew and
[17:50] Gentiles and bringing one group
[17:52] together. Amen. The fellowship of the
[17:54] mystery. Hallelujah.
[17:57] Glory. John 6:14 and 15. H, if you want
[18:00] to get that. John 6:14 and 15. After the
[18:04] people saw the sign Jesus performed,
[18:06] they began to say, "Surely this is the
[18:08] prophet who is to come into the world."
[18:10] Jesus knowing that they intended to come
[18:12] and make him king by force withdrew
[18:14] again to a mountain by himself. This is
[18:16] how much they were focused on the
[18:18] millennium. They were literally going to
[18:20] force him to be the king. But listen,
[18:23] you can't force God to do anything. We
[18:25] listen listen. You've heard all people
[18:27] kind of they try to speak this, they try
[18:29] to speak that in existence, they try to
[18:31] do the third pole. They can do whatever
[18:32] they want, but if God don't lead it,
[18:34] it's not gonna happen. Hallelujah. See,
[18:37] they try to make things happen by force.
[18:39] You got to be led by the Holy Ghost to
[18:41] speak the word of God. Amen. How do you
[18:43] know? Because all your sins are
[18:44] confessed and you just feel and you just
[18:46] yield to the Holy Spirit and you realize
[18:48] it's not you, it's Christ in you.
[18:50] Hallelujah. Amen. That's right. All
[18:53] these people say, "The Lord told me
[18:54] this. The Lord told me that. Uh, well,
[18:56] God's going to do this. God gonna do
[18:57] that. Let's see what God does."
[18:58] Hallelujah. That's always always sit
[19:00] back and see what he's going to do.
[19:02] Praise
[19:03] God. The crowd wanted to force him to be
[19:06] king. Force him in the millennium. Just
[19:07] like Satan offered him the millennium,
[19:09] right? He said, "Just bow down and
[19:10] worship me and I'll give you these
[19:12] kingdoms right now. Give the millennium
[19:13] right now." And Jesus said, "It's
[19:15] written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy
[19:17] God only. Thou shalt have no other gods
[19:19] before me." Hallelujah. Jesus knew too
[19:22] much of the word. And church, we want to
[19:23] get to the spot where we know too much
[19:25] of the word. Or not too much, but we
[19:27] know more of the word. Sorry. We want to
[19:29] get to the spot where we know enough
[19:30] word to defeat Satan. Hallelujah. That's
[19:33] right. Now, see, just like us, church,
[19:36] just like us, many times we don't see
[19:38] the the suffering that was necessary.
[19:41] So, that's a good example. Uh Isaiah 60
[19:44] is let's just let's just briefly go over
[19:46] Isaiah 60. We might as
[19:48] well. Isaiah 60 and then we'll go to
[19:51] Isaiah 53. Isaiah I'm reading through
[19:52] this. This has been one of the most
[19:54] tremendous books. Again, just a
[19:55] reminder.
[19:57] Isaiah
[19:59] 60. Now look how this is this is now
[20:01] brother Ram used verses one and two uh
[20:04] when he preached uh what's the name of
[20:05] that I just let's just slip my mind is
[20:08] the very first sermon of 1964
[20:10] uh sorry I can't remember it but he
[20:13] preached arise shine for thy light has
[20:14] come in the glory of the shalom there it
[20:15] is my mercy goodness the first sermon of
[20:18] 1964 shalom and he preached it twice
[20:20] there at the beginning so this was his
[20:22] text but if you continue reading this is
[20:24] about the millennium
[20:27] hallelujah now look at verse 11
[20:29] therefore For thy gate shall open
[20:30] continually. They shall not be shut by
[20:32] day or night, that men may bring unto
[20:34] thee the forces of the Gentiles, that
[20:36] their kings may be brought in. Any Bible
[20:38] reader knows that's Revelation 21. The
[20:41] Bible said, "The gates will not be shut,
[20:43] and the kings of the earth will bring
[20:45] their glory and honor into the city."
[20:47] Hallelujah. That's
[20:50] right. Now, let's keep going. Turn uh go
[20:54] a little further in the in the chapter.
[20:55] Look at verse 18. Violence shall no more
[20:57] be heard in thy land. This has to be the
[21:00] new Jerusalem because there's there's
[21:01] violence during the millennium. That's
[21:04] right. There's even deception in the
[21:06] millennium because Satan goes around and
[21:07] deceives all the the all the four
[21:09] corners of the world and brings them up
[21:10] against
[21:11] Jerusalem. Right. Hallelujah. And notice
[21:16] at the end of verse 18, thy thou shalt
[21:18] call thy walls salvation and thy gates
[21:20] praise. And that's what we got, church.
[21:22] When we when we know we're saved and
[21:24] we've got uh praise in our lips, we've
[21:26] got protection. We got the walls of
[21:28] protection and we've got the gates so
[21:30] the Holy Ghost can come into our lives.
[21:32] Hallelujah. We got walls. We got a hedge
[21:34] about us. Amen. Just like Job. We've got
[21:36] a hedge of salvation. Hallelujah. When
[21:38] we confess our sins, we're walking in
[21:40] the word. God sets a hedge about his
[21:42] people. Praise God. Amen. Look at verse
[21:44] 19. Any Bible reader will know this. The
[21:46] sun shall be no more thy light by day,
[21:49] neither for brightness, but the moon
[21:51] give light unto thee, but the Lord shall
[21:53] be unto thee an everlasting light. We
[21:55] don't need the sun. We won't need the
[21:57] moon because Christ is the light. Glory.
[22:00] Verse 20. Thy sun shall no more go down,
[22:03] neither shall thy moon withdraw itself,
[22:05] for the Lord shall be thine everlasting
[22:08] light. And the church said, so the Jews
[22:10] are thinking of this this scripture and
[22:12] Isaiah 2 and all these uh Isaiah 66 and
[22:15] Isaiah 65, all these chapters I preached
[22:17] last year on the millennium, right? All
[22:19] these they're thinking about all these
[22:20] other ones, but they miss Isaiah 53.
[22:23] Let's go there briefly. And again, I've
[22:26] said this before. If if I should go to
[22:27] the grave uh at my funeral, I want this
[22:30] chapter read by God's grace. Read Isaiah
[22:33] 53. So someone will know that Jesse
[22:35] Smith's sins was healed by Jesus Christ.
[22:38] Hallelujah. That's right. Isaiah
[22:43] 53. Now, at the end of verse two, it
[22:45] says, "There's no beauty that we would
[22:46] desire him." That's why that's a great
[22:47] picture of Christ. He's not a beautiful
[22:48] man. Look, he hasn't trimmed his beard.
[22:50] He don't have big muscles. He don't look
[22:52] real happy. He looks like a sorrowing
[22:55] suh sorrowing servant, right? Like a
[22:57] weeping
[22:58] prophet. And if you look at the actual
[23:00] painting, he's looking at the rich young
[23:02] ruler. Rich young ruler is over here.
[23:03] And he looks all dowled up and he's all
[23:05] all he's all got his hair trimmed and
[23:07] his beard trimmed, probably has makeup
[23:09] on and all kinds of stuff like that.
[23:10] He's got his big rings on, his necklace
[23:12] on. And here's Jesus, a plain old, we'd
[23:14] say, peasant. No beauty that we desire
[23:17] him. Hallelujah. That's right. Verse
[23:20] three. For he's despised and rejected a
[23:22] man, a man of sorrows and acquainted
[23:23] with grief, and we hid, as it were, our
[23:25] faces from him. He was despised, and we
[23:27] esteemed him not. That includes you and
[23:29] I. Praise God. We all would have ran.
[23:32] People, you know, they they look down on
[23:34] uh uh Adam and Eve. You and I would have
[23:36] done the same thing. I heard a man
[23:37] discredit Adam and Eve this week. I'm
[23:39] like, bro, you would have done the same
[23:40] thing. Or, bro, whatever you want to
[23:42] say, you would have done the same thing.
[23:45] And it'll get down on all these people
[23:47] like from the Old Testament. You would
[23:48] have done the same thing because the
[23:49] Holy Ghost wasn't yet given. Praise God.
[23:52] Till Jesus was glorified. Praise God.
[23:54] That's right. We all would have ran.
[23:57] Verse four. Surely he hath borne our
[23:59] griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we
[24:00] did esteem him stricken and smitten of
[24:02] God and afflicted. Now, here's what they
[24:04] were missing. Verse five. He was wounded
[24:06] for our transgressions. He was bruised
[24:08] for our iniquities. The chastisement of
[24:10] our peace was upon him, and with his
[24:12] stripes we are healed. And the church
[24:14] said, look at verse 10. for it pleased
[24:17] the Lord to bruise him. That pleased
[24:19] God. It's something outside of our our
[24:21] feeling and our emotion. We can't quite
[24:23] understand that without the perfect
[24:25] divine love of God. We see pain and we
[24:27] see a crucified Christ and we just uh we
[24:30] don't like to think about that. But it
[24:32] pleased God because it met God's
[24:34] requirements. Hallelujah. Uh because the
[24:36] Bible said because of that Jesus would
[24:39] see his seed. He would see his children
[24:41] become forgiven, filled with the Holy
[24:43] Ghost, and given mansions in heaven. And
[24:45] I'm going to keep preaching on the
[24:46] mansion tonight. Praise God. Because we
[24:48] sang that song. And that's what the
[24:49] future home is. Amen. That's what the
[24:51] new Jerusalem is. All those mansions
[24:53] leading up to the top of the mountain,
[24:54] the holy mountain. Hallelujah. Glory.
[24:57] Where the lamb is the temple. Where the
[24:59] lamb is the light. Hallelujah. And you
[25:01] and I get to see the face of the lamb.
[25:03] Hallelujah. It's going to shine brighter
[25:05] than the sun. And the church said,
[25:07] brighter than the sun, the face of Jesus
[25:10] Christ. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[25:15] So see we see him uh the suffering. This
[25:18] is suffering. This is the part they
[25:20] miss. They saw in churches just like you
[25:22] and I. You and I alls we see is the
[25:23] rapture scriptures right? Shout voice
[25:25] trump changed in a moment twink of an
[25:27] eye. Caught up to meet the Lord and
[25:28] everything. Oh glory. But what if
[25:30] there's suffering before that? What if
[25:32] there is a squeeze time? Well, let's not
[25:35] talk about that too much. Well, we we
[25:36] don't have to. But if it's God's will,
[25:38] it's going to happen. Praise God. And so
[25:41] we ought to be prepared to suffer like
[25:42] our Lord suffered for us. Praise God. If
[25:44] it goes down to that. We don't know.
[25:46] Like there we don't have a thus sayith
[25:47] the Lord on it. We don't know. But we
[25:49] got to be ready. We what I'm saying is
[25:51] don't don't look past suffering like
[25:52] like s like suffering is never going to
[25:55] happen to us. It's going to happen to
[25:56] us. Praise God. Like you've heard it
[25:59] said it uh tragedy visits every home at
[26:01] some
[26:02] point. Right? It's going to uh visit.
[26:04] Death comes knocking at every home at
[26:07] some point, whether expected or
[26:10] unexpected. Like I I'll tell Mai Malai,
[26:12] we were driving up from Tennessee,
[26:13] remember after the youth meeting, and I
[26:15] I'm not going to name his name, but a
[26:16] young man, he's got to be 25. And he was
[26:18] talking about when his grandfather
[26:19] unexpectedly died, and he's still crying
[26:21] in the seat next to me, still crying
[26:23] about it. And he was a godly preacher,
[26:26] one of my uh
[26:28] mentors. Still when it's unexpected like
[26:31] that. And and and he was crying. And
[26:33] he's just telling me, "But I'm glad the
[26:35] day before he had the heart attack, I
[26:36] got I just felt led to tell him how much
[26:38] I loved him." Look how merciful God is.
[26:40] Praise
[26:41] God. God is so gracious. God is so
[26:44] merciful. Oh, now what if he would have
[26:45] been walking in the flesh and he would
[26:47] have missed that opportunity. See,
[26:49] church, we always want to walk in the
[26:50] spirit. Praise God. And I told you that
[26:52] story. Remember, two summers ago? I
[26:53] don't you No, you don't remember. So,
[26:54] I'm sorry.
[26:56] You uh his name was uh King. What was
[26:59] his first name? Tenny. Tennis King. That
[27:02] was his name. Tennis King. like a tennis
[27:03] king, but tennis was his first thing. I
[27:06] was going to get our milk one night. It
[27:07] was a th No, it would have been a
[27:09] Wednesday.
[27:10] Yeah. And we've talked scores of times.
[27:14] I don't want to exaggerate too much. I
[27:15] exaggerate way too much. But for some
[27:18] reason that it was a summer, it was a
[27:19] fall night. It was in August right
[27:21] before school
[27:22] started. And we were just talking. I
[27:24] said, "How you doing, Tenny?" He's like,
[27:25] "Oh, you know, doing okay. Doing okay."
[27:27] And he just kind of looked discouraged.
[27:28] And I started said I said, "Tenny, I
[27:30] said he got I said something like this.
[27:31] something along this along these lines.
[27:32] I can't remember, but I said, "Tenny,
[27:34] God loves you so much. He's, you know,
[27:35] he's got a gray beard and he's an old
[27:36] man. He's a Catholic man, but he always
[27:39] respected me. We had different talks. We
[27:41] disagreed on some things, but he always
[27:42] respected me and I respected him. And
[27:44] he's given us, he's allowed us to have
[27:45] our our our milk in his fridge for uh 15
[27:49] years now. Bless his heart. He shares
[27:51] his electricity with us. Doesn't even
[27:53] charge us." Well, he did. Now, his wife
[27:55] does. But for some some reason, church,
[27:57] it was right before church, right? You
[27:58] know, it was a Wednesday night. picking
[27:59] up milk, coming uh just going there. And
[28:02] I just felt something come on me. I just
[28:04] like I'm going to encourage this guy. I
[28:05] said, "Ten, you've been a great father.
[28:07] You've raised four children." No, five
[28:08] children. And he had
[28:10] quadruplets. No, he had six. He had six
[28:12] children. But how many did he have at
[28:14] one time? Quadruplets. Four at one time.
[28:17] And that was their first one, right?
[28:18] That was their first birth. Yeah, it was
[28:20] because the younger ones are younger.
[28:22] Yeah. Not going to be wrong on that,
[28:23] too. So, forgive
[28:25] me. I said I said, "Tenny, I said,"
[28:28] Tenny, you have fed these children their
[28:30] whole life. I said, "You have
[28:33] sacrificed." And as I was talking, he
[28:35] just got more and more encouraged. Like
[28:37] I saw his shoulders go up, brother. You
[28:38] know how he did pretty soon. He's
[28:41] feeling pretty good. I'm like, "Tenny,
[28:43] God loves you." I said, "God is going to
[28:45] honor you for I said, "You've been true
[28:46] to your wife all these years. True. You
[28:48] have been faithful to your wife. You've
[28:51] loved those children." I said, "Every
[28:52] time I see your picture around here," he
[28:53] said, "You're hugging one of your
[28:54] grandchildren." He's like, I just love
[28:55] the
[28:56] grandchildren. I'm like, Tenny, you're a
[28:58] man after my own heart. So, children,
[29:02] have some grandchildren sometime soon,
[29:03] okay? But get married first. Get married
[29:05] first. We're going to have our own baby
[29:07] pretty soon, too, by God's grace. We
[29:09] love babies around here. Hallelujah. But
[29:12] I was just, you know, I just felt the
[29:14] spirit of God come over me. Two days
[29:15] later, I get a text. He
[29:17] died. So, right before he died, God, and
[29:21] there was no reason for me to do this.
[29:22] God anointed me. I was walking in the
[29:24] spirit getting ready to preach and God
[29:26] anointed me to kind of cheer him up and
[29:28] lift him up. I said, "There's going to
[29:29] be a great place for you in heaven,
[29:30] Tenny, because he is faithful to his
[29:31] wife, faithful to his children." I said,
[29:33] "You have honored the Lord." He's like,
[29:34] "Well, yeah, by God's grace or you know,
[29:37] that's what I say, but his humble way,
[29:38] he had another way to say it." There's
[29:40] another striking example of how if
[29:42] you're loving God and if you're walking
[29:43] the spirit, God will prepare you to go
[29:46] on to the other side. Praise God. Amen.
[29:49] Glory.
[29:50] And I could go to that funeral just in
[29:52] peace in my heart. Uh, and I would just
[29:54] kept saying it was all by the love of
[29:56] God. All by the the blood of Jesus
[29:57] Christ. God did this and you've honored
[29:59] God. God will honor you. Praise God.
[30:01] That's what the Bible says. That's what
[30:03] s that's what uh uh God told Samuel. He
[30:07] said, Eli, because you didn't honor me,
[30:09] you honored your sons above me. He said,
[30:11] God's going to take your position away.
[30:13] But then uh but then he said, "But those
[30:16] that honor God, God will honor them."
[30:19] Hallelujah. That's right. Glory. Sorry
[30:21] if I'm clapping too loud, Lydia. I'm
[30:25] sorry. Now, I think I'll just move on
[30:27] here now. So, it's the suffering that
[30:30] sometimes we don't like to talk about.
[30:32] We don't like to experience, but it's
[30:34] part of the Christian journey. How many
[30:35] can say amen to that? You must suffer.
[30:39] Hallelujah. Well, look at that. Okay. I
[30:41] didn't had some notes in there. I didn't
[30:42] even know I was gonna uh Well, just tied
[30:45] it all together. Well, that's just for
[30:46] me. uh Acts 17:2 and 3 again as Paul as
[30:50] his manner was went in unto them and
[30:52] three Sabbaths day reason them without
[30:54] the scriptures. People say, "Oh, you
[30:55] shouldn't debate, brother Jesse. You
[30:56] shouldn't debate." Paul
[30:57] debated. It's just people are ignorant.
[31:00] They just don't. It's sad. They don't
[31:01] know the scripture. May God help them.
[31:02] May God help them. Opening and alleging
[31:05] that Christ must needs have suffered and
[31:07] risen again from the dead and that this
[31:09] Jesus whom I preach unto you is
[31:13] Christ. See, what do they miss? They
[31:16] miss the suffering part of it. Everybody
[31:18] loves the glory of the millennium.
[31:19] Everybody loves the glory of the new
[31:20] temple, the glory of the a man ruling a
[31:23] rod of iron over every nation. Everybody
[31:25] loves the glory of that, but it takes
[31:27] suffering before
[31:29] that. Now, there's four reasons we
[31:31] suffer at least. Let's review these. I
[31:32] preached on I preached these down to to
[31:34] the Junction City Saints there on
[31:35] Sunday. It's to the reason we suffer is
[31:39] to so we can judge ourselves. There's a
[31:40] spirit of judgment.
[31:43] 2 Timothy 2:12 and then Job
[31:45] 42:6 2 Timothy
[31:49] 2:12. Very good, huh? You're doing
[31:51] great. If we suffer, we shall also reign
[31:53] with him. If we deny him, he will also
[31:55] deny us. Okay? So suffering, we have to
[31:58] suffer in order to
[32:00] reign. But the first reason we suffer to
[32:03] reign is to see our judgment. The spirit
[32:06] of judgment has to come upon us. We have
[32:07] to judge. My I said some awful things. I
[32:09] did some awful things. I thought some
[32:11] awful things. I pulled some bad deals. I
[32:13] did some sinful things. We must have the
[32:15] Holy Spirit judge us. Not eternally, but
[32:19] in the current time. Hallelujah. Job
[32:22] 42:6. Here's where Job judges judges
[32:25] himself. Job
[32:28] 42:6. Now, after God come down, rebuke
[32:30] him, he didn't say, "Oh, what a great
[32:31] believer I am. I'm tops on on God's
[32:34] list." And he was. He was tops as the
[32:36] greatest man in heaven.
[32:39] But after God got done with him, he
[32:40] thought he was nothing. Church, that
[32:42] what God would do to you. Keep us
[32:43] humble. If not, you got the wrong
[32:46] spirit. You got a prideful spirit. He's
[32:48] the greatest man on earth to God. But
[32:51] God humbles him so he thinks he's lower
[32:53] than a snake's belly. Right? You've
[32:56] heard it said like that. He didn't
[32:58] think, "Oh boy, I'm so great. I passed
[32:59] the test. Oh, brother so and so, sister
[33:01] so and so, you really passed the test."
[33:03] Like, you know, we try to encourage each
[33:04] other here, you know?
[33:06] But when he saw his sins, he said, "I
[33:09] hate myself, my sin nature." Who doesn't
[33:12] hate their sin nature here tonight? I
[33:13] hope you don't. I mean, hope you I hope
[33:15] you hate your sin nature. I hope you
[33:16] don't love it. You're in trouble if you
[33:17] love your sin nature. But he realized,
[33:19] "Wow, I'm not." And remember, I gave I
[33:21] texted Brother Irvvin the verses where
[33:23] Job actually said, "I'm more just than
[33:25] God. I'm a better judge than God. I'm
[33:28] more fair than God." And Job even said,
[33:30] "I'm more righteous than God." Sound
[33:32] familiar to you? Yeah. Yeah, it's the
[33:34] message preachers that are calling
[33:35] themselves the greatest of all time
[33:36] right now. Sound familiar? They're
[33:39] greater. They're saying they're great,
[33:40] the greatest prophet, the greatest
[33:41] congregations. Message preachers today
[33:43] are calling themselves the greatest of
[33:44] all time. Where'd they get that? Uh they
[33:47] got it from uh they got it from Job
[33:48] before he actually knew why he was
[33:50] suffering. Yeah, that's right. That's a
[33:52] scripture. Let's read it. Then you got
[33:54] it. And then uh you know that it's uh
[33:57] right there in the scripture. There it
[33:59] is. Okay. Job 32:2. Hun. Job 32:2.
[34:03] Elahoo gets so mad at Job because he's
[34:05] glorifying himself. He's exalting
[34:08] himself. Remember, Job did great things.
[34:10] Uh he helped the widow. He helped the uh
[34:12] the fatherless. Uh he even made a vow
[34:16] never to lust after a woman, right? He
[34:18] was pure with his thoughts. What a man
[34:20] he was. He sacrificed for his children.
[34:22] He prayed for his children. Burned
[34:24] animal sacrifices in case his children
[34:27] uh would sin. He did sacrifices for his
[34:30] children. What a great man he was. He
[34:33] was a great man, but he was also a human
[34:35] like you and
[34:37] I. Job 32:2. Then was kindled the wrath
[34:40] of Elahu, the son of Berichel or Barelo,
[34:43] maybe I don't know. The buzzite of the
[34:45] kindred of ram against Job was his wrath
[34:47] kindled because he justified himself
[34:50] rather than God. Job said, "Why am I
[34:53] suffering? Why am I going through this?
[34:54] Something must be wrong with God." In
[34:56] fact, the opposite was true. Something
[34:58] was wrong with Job. Hallelujah. Because
[35:00] no man is greater than God. Can you like
[35:02] remember Simon brother preach it? Simon
[35:04] preach it to us. He said if this is all
[35:05] the remember Simon said of if this is
[35:07] all the knowledge in the world you don't
[35:08] even know
[35:10] that let alone a fourth or a half or
[35:13] three4s. Who wants to do a fraction
[35:15] lesson? I'm a school teacher. I could do
[35:17] a little bit of that. Not not too much.
[35:19] See we we hardly know
[35:22] anything, right? But Job's saying I'm
[35:24] greater I'm I'm a better judge at things
[35:26] than God
[35:28] is. That's why Job says I hate myself. I
[35:31] I hate I hate when I get in the flesh.
[35:33] And the church said, I hope you can say
[35:35] that with an honest heart. I do, too. I
[35:36] hate when I get in the flesh and make a
[35:38] mistake. I don't want to do that. But
[35:40] God allows us to do that so we'll be
[35:42] more humble. We'll have self judgment
[35:43] and recognize, wow, I'm really nothing.
[35:45] I can do nothing without Christ. Right.
[35:48] John 15:5. No, but we're not going to
[35:50] read that one. Uh Job
[35:52] 35:2. Thinkst thou this to be right,
[35:55] that thou saidest, my righteousness is
[35:57] more than God. He thought he was more
[35:59] right, brother Chris, than God was. He
[36:02] thought he could get things more right
[36:04] than God could. Well, I've already
[36:05] judged this. I already know what they're
[36:07] going to say. I already know what they
[36:08] think. I already know all this. I know
[36:10] what I know all about it. And Elahu
[36:13] says, "No, you don't." Remember Elahu
[36:16] said, "Can you go find the treasures of
[36:17] snow? I'd like you to bring some That's
[36:19] what No, I'm sorry. God told that to
[36:20] Job. Can you go find the treasures of
[36:22] snow and bring them out for us, Job?
[36:24] Where were you when I laid the
[36:25] foundations of the earth?" That means he
[36:26] wasn't there when he laid the
[36:28] foundations of the earth. That means
[36:29] that was angels and not not men, right?
[36:33] That stumbles people, but they just
[36:35] don't think about it very deeply. Job
[36:37] wasn't standing there. That was angels
[36:39] standing there. If Job was standing
[36:40] there, he would have said, "Yeah, I
[36:41] remember that. I was there. I was I was
[36:43] one of the sons of God. It was angels,
[36:45] church. It was
[36:46] angels." It's it's so hard sometimes for
[36:48] people to to grow in grace and knowledge
[36:50] of the Lord. He said, "My righteousness
[36:52] is more than
[36:53] God's." See, now think about that. He's
[36:56] going through trials. He's lost all of
[36:57] his family. Now, we can see why he might
[36:59] say stuff, right? Because he lost all
[37:00] his family. He made all those
[37:01] sacrifices. He'd been so diligent in his
[37:04] mind, you know, made all these uh good
[37:06] acts of giving to the
[37:08] poor, but when it came down to it, he
[37:10] got in the flesh. Maybe that maybe it
[37:12] was the boils that put him over the
[37:14] top. None of us have had boils like
[37:16] that. So, we can't even we can't even
[37:18] begin to understand what Job went
[37:19] through. Not even a little bit. Unless
[37:21] you're covered in boils, you lose all
[37:22] your hair, baldness, and boils on top of
[37:25] your head. I'm talking about boils on
[37:27] your head. No more hair, now boils,
[37:31] right? So, he suffered, but that's one
[37:34] reason you suffer. So, you'll you'll get
[37:37] a real realization of how sinful you
[37:39] really
[37:40] are, right? Your flesh, I'm talking
[37:42] about, and your mind can be sinful, too,
[37:44] because you're three parts. Another
[37:46] reason you suffer is to learn to obey
[37:48] the word of God, right? Just like even
[37:51] the Lord Jesus had to bring his flesh
[37:52] into subjection. Jesus never sinned, but
[37:54] he was tempted uh and he had to bring
[37:57] his physical body into subjection to the
[38:00] word. Hebrews 5'8 tells us that. Hebrews
[38:05] 5'8. Though he were a son, yet he
[38:07] learned he obedience by the things which
[38:10] he suffered. So all the name calling,
[38:13] right? all the crowds gathered around
[38:15] him, all the things that he went
[38:16] through, all all the all the questions
[38:18] and all the traps they were setting for
[38:20] him, he learned through all that, he
[38:22] learned to obey
[38:23] God. Yes. So why do you suffer? So
[38:26] you'll judge yourself sinful. Second,
[38:28] why do you suffer? You need to obey
[38:31] better. Third, why do you suffer?
[38:33] Suffer, sorry. So you can have greater
[38:35] fruitfulness. John
[38:37] 15:2A. John 15:2.
[38:40] See, when you suffer, you get humbled,
[38:42] and then you can serve God
[38:44] better.
[38:46] Hallelujah. Every branch in me that
[38:48] beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and
[38:49] every branch that beareth fruit, he
[38:51] purgeth it, that it may bring forth more
[38:53] fruit. None of us like to be cut, but
[38:56] God has to cut his children. And if we
[38:58] apply other scriptures, if he don't cut
[39:00] you, you're not a child of God. Because
[39:02] he said, "As many as I love, I rebuke
[39:03] and chasen." Every son, in Hebrews 12,
[39:05] every son and daughter must be chasened.
[39:07] Hallelujah.
[39:09] must be trained. Hallelujah. Right,
[39:12] Lydia and Malachi. You case, you see it
[39:13] at the orchard, right? You trim them up.
[39:15] They're trimming them up now. You've
[39:16] seen it for how many years? They come
[39:18] back even greater. We've seen it at our
[39:19] house, right? Trimmed up our
[39:20] blueberries. Now they're all over the
[39:21] place. Just got to make sure those
[39:23] animals don't get them. Huh? See, you'll
[39:26] be more fruitful after you suffer.
[39:28] You'll come back and want to give God
[39:29] more of your time, more of your love.
[39:32] Hallelujah. or as a parent, if you make
[39:34] a mistake and you suffer, you go through
[39:36] suffering, that'll make you be more
[39:38] diligent with the next child.
[39:40] Hallelujah. Parents should say amen on
[39:42] that one. Amen, brother Jess. I'm saying
[39:44] amen, too. James
[39:47] 5:11. Another reason you suffer is to be
[39:50] a testimony to
[39:52] others. Behold, we count them happy
[39:54] which endure. Ye've heard of the
[39:56] patience of Job, and have seen the end
[39:58] of the Lord, that the Lord is very
[39:59] pitiful, and of tender mercy.
[40:02] Now, the two examples I gave, you know,
[40:05] my dad left me when I I think I was 12.
[40:06] So, my dad divorced my wife or or my
[40:08] mom, sorry, dad divorced
[40:10] mom. And so, I can minister, I can
[40:13] relate to people that have had divorces
[40:14] in their lives because I've suffered
[40:16] through that. I've I've felt where I
[40:17] felt alone like I wish daddy would come
[40:19] home. Where's my dad? Where's daddy?
[40:21] I've I've suffered through that. Right?
[40:23] So, because I've I've done that, now I
[40:25] can relate to somebody like that. Now,
[40:28] another thing I brought, now this is a
[40:30] little different angle, but when I was a
[40:31] sinner, I really got into really evil
[40:33] magazines and pictures and movies. I'm
[40:35] just being very general, but I had to
[40:37] suffer to overcome
[40:39] that. And church, last summer, I
[40:41] preached at three different churches on
[40:43] pornography. And I saw probably Malachi
[40:46] was there. I probably saw 15, 20 men,
[40:48] maybe more. I'm trying not to be over
[40:50] try not to over exaggerate. We saw grown
[40:53] men fall on the ground weeping and
[40:56] crying and trying to overcome
[40:57] pornography. They never could have heard
[40:59] me preach on that if I had not suffered
[41:01] through it first. And the church said,
[41:03] "So see even in your weaknesses, even
[41:05] the things you battle, you know, as
[41:07] you're grow trying to become a
[41:08] Christian, even that as all ordained by
[41:10] God, so you can minister to somebody
[41:12] else." Praise God. Amen.
[41:15] So all the harsh events of my life or
[41:18] the the tragedies or even my mistakes,
[41:20] my sinful desires, my suffering, trying
[41:22] to overcome things, even through all
[41:24] that, it can all be channeled to give
[41:26] God glory.
[41:29] Hallelujah. And church, God is so
[41:31] faithful. He'll bring people to you that
[41:33] need that you need to testify to.
[41:39] Right? You I could have went there. I
[41:41] could have thought, well, there's all
[41:41] these men in here. And you know what the
[41:42] thought came to me? It was last year.
[41:44] The thought came to me like, "How come
[41:45] all these men never say amen? How come
[41:47] they never shout? How come they never do
[41:49] any? They never get in the service. They
[41:50] don't pray before service. They don't
[41:52] pray after service. They It's because
[41:54] they're addicted to their phones.
[41:55] They're addicted to pornography. They're
[41:57] giving their love to
[41:59] Delilah. They're they're giving their
[42:01] heart to pornography. They're giving God
[42:03] their strength. They come to church, but
[42:05] they don't get nothing out of it because
[42:06] they're already they're already filled
[42:08] with all the the love of the world.
[42:10] They're making love to the world.
[42:11] They're flirting with the world. They're
[42:13] feasting from the world's table so
[42:14] they're not hungry from God's table.
[42:16] Hallelujah. And that struck me in that
[42:18] month. It struck me in that month when I
[42:19] had those three invitations. And God
[42:21] vindicated it. And church, it did so
[42:23] well. One of the guys confessed his
[42:24] porn. And then he even went back and
[42:26] said, "I stole thousands of dollars from
[42:27] my dad." And I said, "You go tell your
[42:30] dad right now." And he did. And the next
[42:32] day he was dancing when I preached on
[42:34] dancing for the
[42:35] Lord. Glory. Amen. He was the only one
[42:38] dancing the church other than me.
[42:41] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[42:43] Amen. Because when you got the victory,
[42:45] you got to let it out. Praise God.
[42:47] Hallelujah. It's either a season of
[42:49] mourning or dancing. Well, it's my
[42:50] season of dance. And if I have nothing
[42:52] to mourn over, it's my time to dance and
[42:54] praise the Lord. Because God looks down
[42:56] and said, "That's a man. That's a
[42:57] daughter after my own heart." Praise
[42:59] God. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[43:04] Glory. So, see, you you think, why am I
[43:07] struggling with this sin? Why am I
[43:09] boundless? You're suffering through it
[43:11] so you can be a help to somebody else.
[43:14] Hallelujah. Now, I'm sure I could think
[43:16] of more, but those are just two from
[43:19] Sunday. I'm about 40 minutes. Everybody
[43:22] still with me by God's grace? I know you
[43:25] appreciate you. Okay, let's move on. I'm
[43:27] going to now here. This is the main
[43:28] thought, but I thought, well, I got to
[43:30] finish up that other thought before I
[43:31] get to the next thought. Okay, so so
[43:33] this is the fifth example of burning.
[43:36] And we read it. David. David, a man
[43:38] after of God's own heart. Now, how many
[43:40] think that's the best show they've ever
[43:41] seen? Oh, you don't have to raise your
[43:42] hands. I'm talking about David Sight and
[43:45] Sound. That's my favorite movie of all
[43:46] time. Nobody can beat that. By God's
[43:48] grace, unless they come out with David
[43:49] part
[43:51] two. Psalm 39. Let's go there. By God's
[43:53] grace. Psalm 39. I'm having a good time
[43:55] tonight. Praise God. I'm happy in the
[43:57] Lord. Praise God. See what God is doing
[43:58] around us and who's been so faithful to
[44:00] us. Praise God. Psalm 39.
[44:04] And church, the joy of the Lord is your
[44:06] strength. You want to be stronger, get
[44:09] happy in Jesus. Sing to Jesus. Worship
[44:12] Jesus. Love
[44:13] Jesus. Psalm
[44:21] 39. So, the spirit of God puts you into
[44:23] service. The spirit of God keeps you
[44:26] from quitting your service. The spirit
[44:28] of God dissolves all your doubts about
[44:30] your service. And let's see what the
[44:32] spirit of burning here does to David
[44:34] here. Now, there's proof that this is a
[44:37] desperate cry from David. And it seems
[44:40] like there's proof this was even before
[44:41] he was king. This seems to be during the
[44:43] time he was running from Saul. So,
[44:46] everybody picture that. Imagine your
[44:47] father-in-law or your mother-in-law
[44:50] chasing you down to kill you. Now, some
[44:52] it might be more real than others. Okay?
[44:54] If that's the case, then I'm very
[44:56] sorry. It's time to pray.
[45:01] Hallelujah. And I I forget how many
[45:03] years it was. I forget if he ran maybe
[45:05] seven or 13 years. I can't remember the
[45:06] exact number, but he ran for years
[45:09] trying to just spare his
[45:12] life. So chapter 39 verse
[45:16] one. Now in here we should see the two
[45:20] spirits talking about justification and
[45:22] sanctification. The spirit of judgment
[45:23] is a spirit of justification. Right? You
[45:25] got to get just before God. You can't
[45:27] get just before God until you say, "God,
[45:29] I'm guilty of sin." And tell God, "I'm
[45:32] guilty of this sin. I can't overcome it
[45:35] except by your power. I have no power
[45:37] myself." I mean, how can I overcome? I
[45:38] can't overcome unless you give me your
[45:40] power. And then greater is he that's in
[45:41] me than he that's in the world.
[45:43] Hallelujah. But you don't get that until
[45:45] you first admit you're a sinner or you
[45:47] made mistakes. Now, you're a saint, too.
[45:49] You're a king and priest of God. I'm
[45:50] saying I'm talking about your flesh.
[45:51] Your flesh has the sinful nature, right?
[45:55] I'm not trying to make you say, "I'm a
[45:56] sinner. Leave this place. I'm a s." No,
[45:57] you're a saint. Praise God. But you've
[45:59] got to battle that sin nature. You got
[46:00] to admit you've fallen to the sin
[46:03] nature. Probably every day. Abraham
[46:05] says, "Every day, then other times he
[46:06] says, you know, you can live so close to
[46:08] God, Satan doesn't know what to do with
[46:09] you."
[46:13] Hallelujah. Now, there's proof. Verses 1
[46:15] and two, we see the spirit of judgment.
[46:17] Look what David says in 1 and two. Then
[46:18] we'll go down to verse 11 and 13. 11,
[46:20] 12, 13. So verses one and two, I said I
[46:23] will take heed to my ways. Notice I'm
[46:26] really going to watch my ways here. That
[46:28] I sin not with my tongue. So that mean
[46:30] that that must mean before he was saying
[46:32] some sinful things. Now church, we all
[46:34] do it when we
[46:35] complain, right? Whenever we complain
[46:38] and talk about how hard things is, how
[46:40] bad we got it, why don't God show up,
[46:42] that's a sin. It's idol words, right?
[46:45] And we're all guilty, right? So we just
[46:48] have to repent. Now look what you can
[46:49] tell. He's admitting, "I sin with my
[46:53] mouth." A lot of us sin with our thumbs,
[46:56] right? Or sin with our voice speaking to
[46:58] our phone. But we we're just we're
[47:01] sinners in the in the in the flesh. So
[47:03] we need the grace of God every day.
[47:06] Okay? I will keep my mouth with a bridal
[47:09] while the wicked is before me. Now look,
[47:11] look at the zeal in him now. He's like,
[47:12] I'm going to hold my sin. I'm going to
[47:14] keep this thing chained up. It's Well,
[47:15] you know about dogs. Of course, if
[47:17] anybody knows about dogs, keeping a real
[47:18] mad dog chained up like I'm going to
[47:20] bridle this. I'm going to keep him on
[47:21] the leash, right? He ain't getting off
[47:22] this leash or she or whatever. That's
[47:24] what David said. I'm going to watch my
[47:25] tongue so I don't say sinful things
[47:27] again. I'm really determined not to say
[47:30] something sinful
[47:32] today. Sound like he knew he was sinning
[47:35] with his mouth. So God had to show him
[47:36] he was wrong with some of his words.
[47:39] Verse two, I was done with silence. So
[47:41] he had to just get totally silent.
[47:43] Christian, that's what we need
[47:44] sometimes. just a quiet stop talking
[47:46] right stop talking that remember that's
[47:48] what me told brother Brandham she said
[47:50] Bill you're talking too much shame on
[47:52] you don't don't say things like that
[47:53] remember he had a nine day a nine-day
[47:55] sinus infection his temperature was 105
[47:57] for nine days brother Brandham and then
[48:00] by the end of that every preacher had
[48:01] prayed for him come by and he never got
[48:03] well and so he goes to ma ma come here
[48:05] maybe God never called me to preach
[48:07] maybe I shouldn't be preaching and she
[48:09] said close your mouth bill don't you're
[48:11] saying foolish things and brother said
[48:13] it kind of rebuked me a little And I
[48:14] liked it. Hallelujah. Praise God. She
[48:19] and she said just something along the
[48:20] lines of just just be quiet. Just keep
[48:22] quiet. So David had to learn the same
[48:25] thing. Stop talking about all the
[48:27] negative. Just keep quiet. Just trust in
[48:29] God. Hallelujah. That's for me. That's
[48:31] for everybody here. Hallelujah.
[48:33] Sometimes it's better just not to talk.
[48:36] Right? I tell those first graders all
[48:37] the time that say if you have nothing
[48:38] good to say, don't say nothing at all.
[48:41] Right? And I'm preaching to
[48:43] myself. Oh, there's my 45 minutes. Okay,
[48:46] that's for only 45. That was an hour.
[48:47] That was
[48:48] 45. I know you I know you be patient
[48:50] with the
[48:52] word. Verse two. I was done with
[48:54] silence. I held my peace even from good
[48:56] and my sorrow was stirred. Now go down
[48:59] to verse 11. Now verse 11, 12,3 again
[49:02] shows uh how he knew he was wrong and he
[49:04] was really trying to overcome his sin
[49:07] that he battled.
[49:10] when thou rebukest correct man for
[49:13] iniquity. So he's talking about himself.
[49:16] Thou makest his beauty to consume away
[49:18] like a a
[49:19] moth. Surely every man is vanity. Say
[49:22] and how many know David is included in
[49:24] every man. And the church said he didn't
[49:26] say every man but
[49:28] me. He said every man is full of
[49:31] vanity and every man has iniquity.
[49:34] Hallelujah. Now the remember I I
[49:36] preached that to that sermon to you last
[49:38] last winter. Uh the Bible says we must
[49:42] depart from iniquity. Let him that
[49:44] nameth the name of Christ, how many
[49:46] raise your hand if you're nameing the
[49:46] name of Jesus. You you live for Jesus.
[49:48] Okay. The Bible said if you name the
[49:50] name of Christ, depart from your
[49:51] iniquity. That means you're going to
[49:52] have iniquity. That means you're going
[49:54] to have to have some sin that you
[49:56] actively walk away from and you're going
[49:57] to stop giving into that
[50:00] sin. David said the same thing. Every
[50:03] man that battles iniquity. Verse 12,
[50:06] hear my prayers. This is a prayer, a
[50:08] song that I'm sorry, a prayer that
[50:09] turned into a
[50:11] song. Glory. Oh Lord, hear my prayer, oh
[50:14] Lord, and give ear unto my cry. Hold not
[50:16] thy peace at my tears. He's crying while
[50:18] he's singing this. In other words, he is
[50:21] so ashamed. How did I say that right by
[50:23] my wife? I said that right by my
[50:25] husband. I said that right in public.
[50:27] And I said that online. That's for me. I
[50:30] said that in the sermon on
[50:32] accident. And it meant so it was so hurt
[50:35] him. He was crying about this. Oh God,
[50:36] I'm really going to watch my words
[50:38] tonight. I'm really not I'm just not
[50:40] going to say anything because I've said
[50:42] such foolish things at times. Now, when
[50:45] were you and I that serious about our
[50:46] words? See, it just shows we need a
[50:48] renewal, right? We need the Holy Spirit
[50:50] to renew everything. Doesn't he make all
[50:52] things new? Praise God. Any man that's
[50:53] in Christ, isn't he a new creature? Old
[50:56] things have passed away. Behold, all
[50:57] things
[50:58] become. We're probably singing all
[51:00] things become new.
[51:04] Verse 13. No, I'm sorry. I didn't finish
[51:06] 12. Peace at my tears, for I am a
[51:08] stranger with thee and a sojourer as all
[51:10] my fathers are. In other words, I'm no
[51:12] better than anybody. I'm just like all
[51:13] the other men that are sojouring on this
[51:16] earth looking for a city whose builder
[51:19] and maker's God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:22] That's what we're looking for. Amen.
[51:23] We're looking for the future home.
[51:24] Praise God. We're looking for the
[51:25] millennium first and then we're looking
[51:27] for the new Jerusalem. Praise God.
[51:29] Brother Ram said it's always just right
[51:30] up. Look up. That's where it is.
[51:32] That's the home you're looking for. It's
[51:34] up. Brother said, "Where's my portion?"
[51:36] The Holy Spirit said, "Look up. Your
[51:38] portion's in heaven. Not some big
[51:40] university, not some big
[51:42] building. Your portion's in heaven." How
[51:44] many glad your portion is in heaven? I'd
[51:45] rather have it in heaven than here on
[51:47] the earth where moth will and thieves
[51:49] will break through and destroy. I'd
[51:51] rather have it in heaven. Praise God.
[51:53] I'd rather take the way with the Lord's
[51:55] despised
[51:57] few.
[51:58] Hallelujah. Glory. What a
[52:02] joy. Verse 13. Oh, spare me. Now look,
[52:06] spare me. So that means, look at this.
[52:08] So spare me that I may recover my
[52:10] strength before I go hence and be no
[52:13] more. So that means the spirit of God.
[52:16] Now the word spare means to look at
[52:18] closely with your face. If you look it
[52:20] up in the the the Hebrew. So in other
[52:22] words, David David's like, God is he's
[52:25] he's looking right at me telling me I've
[52:26] got sin. I'm just like every other man.
[52:30] He said, 'Oh, spare me that I may
[52:31] recover strength. So, he's weakened. He
[52:34] sinned with his mouth and he's weak. He
[52:36] said, "I'm not strong like I used to
[52:37] be." He said, "Spare me. Uh, the spirit
[52:39] of judgment is upon
[52:41] me."
[52:43] Hallelujah. Look it up. It's right
[52:46] there. He says, "Before I go hence and
[52:49] be no more." In other words, God, God,
[52:52] let the judgment pass from me before
[52:53] it's my time to
[52:56] die. Now, church, there's clues in here.
[52:59] This was before he was
[53:01] king because after he was king, he wrote
[53:05] uh he wrote Psalm 51. No, I'm sorry.
[53:07] Yeah. Yeah. After he was king uh and
[53:10] married Basheba, that firstborn died.
[53:13] But what did he say then? He said, "I I
[53:16] I'm sorry. He won't come to me. I will
[53:18] go to him." Now, here he says, "I'll be
[53:21] no more." So, look, he grew over the
[53:24] course of his life. He realized if I
[53:26] die, I'm really not dead. I just changed
[53:29] location. Hallelujah. Right here. He's
[53:32] worried. I'll be no more. I lose
[53:33] everything on this earth and I lose
[53:35] everything and uh all my life is gone.
[53:38] I'm just like my my fathers and I leave
[53:40] my riches to somebody else. He's all
[53:41] worried about the natural things. But by
[53:43] by the time he's a king over all Israel,
[53:46] he realizes this is all going to stay
[53:48] here. I'm going to a greater reward. I'm
[53:50] going to meet God. Hallelujah.
[53:52] But here he's worried about I'll be no
[53:54] more. I'm going to lose the rest of my
[53:55] life. I won't be here on the earth. Big
[53:57] deal. Oh, you're with Jesus.
[54:00] Hallelujah. Big deal. Oh, you miss out
[54:03] on all the back
[54:04] pain. Well, you don't know about that
[54:06] unless you're 44 like me. Hallelujah. Or
[54:09] the shoulder pain and all the old
[54:10] injuries from
[54:14] sports. See, David's saying, "Oh, spare
[54:17] me, God, that I'm so weak right now.
[54:19] Your your presence is your your spirit
[54:21] of judgment is upon me so harshly.
[54:23] restore my strength before I go and
[54:26] before I'm no more, before my life is
[54:30] over. So, can everybody see the spirit
[54:32] of judgment was upon him? He recognized
[54:34] I'm I work iniquity. I say evil words. I
[54:37] sin with my mouth. Can everybody see
[54:40] that? Now, the spirit of burning is in
[54:42] verse three. My heart was hot within me.
[54:44] While I was musing, that's
[54:47] meditating. The fire burned. Then spake
[54:50] I with my tongue. So David has realized
[54:53] I I constantly say sinful things. Oh God
[54:57] have mercy on us. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[54:59] have mercy on us. I'm talking about me.
[55:02] I'm talking about in our own lives. We
[55:03] say things we shouldn't say. At least
[55:05] David could admit it. And the church
[55:06] said at least he couldn't admit it
[55:08] because he had the spirit of God on him.
[55:09] We should be able to admit it as well.
[55:11] Sometimes we say sinful
[55:13] things. And so he said once he repents
[55:15] of that and he he he really watches his
[55:18] mouth. He said the spirit of God started
[55:20] burning in him. glory. As he meditated
[55:22] upon God's word, the spirit of God
[55:25] started burning and now he's ready to
[55:27] talk. That's how I feel on many a
[55:29] Wednesday night and a Sunday morning. I
[55:31] can't get wait to get out there and
[55:32] preach what the Lord's put on my heart.
[55:34] Amen. It just be like it's burning in
[55:36] there. Just can't wait to share
[55:39] it. Look, what does he say now? As the
[55:42] fires on him, what does he say? Verse
[55:44] four. Lord, make me to know mine end and
[55:47] the measure of my days what it is that I
[55:50] might know how frail I am. Not how great
[55:53] I am, how frail I am. So the spirit of
[55:57] God had caused him to repent. And he's
[55:59] like, I don't want to sin like I've been
[56:01] doing. And so the spirit of God gets on
[56:03] him and said, God, how much longer do I
[56:05] have to serve you? Do I got 40 more
[56:08] years? That's what I asked the Lord.
[56:09] Lord, do I have 40 more years to preach?
[56:11] Will I live that long?
[56:13] What have I got left? The spirit of God
[56:16] moves on him and he's been being chased
[56:17] around by his father-in-law and narrowly
[56:20] escaped death so many times. He's
[56:22] sinning. He's saying all these sinful
[56:24] words. He said, "Oh God, I want to know
[56:25] how much time do I have
[56:28] left." That's what the spirit of God
[56:30] will do. It'll make you glory. It'll
[56:32] make you redeem the time because the
[56:34] days are evil. Praise God. And guess
[56:36] what? The evil is often your and my own
[56:38] sin. That's the evil of our days. We put
[56:41] ourselves, we say the wrong thing, do
[56:43] the wrong thing. We put ourselves in
[56:44] troubles, troublesome situations because
[56:46] of our own sin, snares of the devil that
[56:49] we walk right into
[56:52] sometimes. We know, we know it's wrong,
[56:54] we know we shouldn't do it. We still do
[56:55] it sometimes. We walked right into the
[56:58] snare of the
[57:00] devil. But what does the spirit of God
[57:02] say? Lord, make me to know my end.
[57:04] What's going to be my end? I've been
[57:06] chased. I've been being chased for all
[57:08] these years. What's going to be my end?
[57:10] How long will I live? What's the measure
[57:12] of my
[57:13] days? Am I going to live till I'm 70? Or
[57:16] if I'm if I'm strong, brother Austin,
[57:17] I'll get to 80. Well, I'm over halfway
[57:20] there, so I better enjoy it. Sometimes I
[57:22] joke around with my children, but it's a
[57:24] reality. I got maybe less less of my I
[57:26] have half less than half of my life
[57:28] left. I don't have much time, right? But
[57:31] when we think about that and in in a
[57:33] positive way to serve the Lord, it's a
[57:35] good thing. Praise God. It restores our
[57:37] strength. It's the spirit of God saying,
[57:39] "Lord, how much time do I have left?
[57:40] God, help me to redeem the time. Help me
[57:42] to do what I'm supposed to do." Praise
[57:44] God. Help me not to sin with my lips.
[57:49] That's
[57:50] right. Help me to know how frail I am,
[57:53] church. That will keep you on your
[57:55] knees. You make a few mistakes and do
[57:56] some really embarrassing sins, that will
[57:58] help you get on your knees every day and
[58:01] say, "God, give me grace today. Help me
[58:03] not to fall short.
[58:10] Look at it. This is a man after whose
[58:13] heart? God's own heart. Hallelujah. A
[58:17] man after God's own
[58:19] heart. Give me a burning sensation so I
[58:22] will be careful what I say. Give me a
[58:25] burning sensation so I can have an idea
[58:27] how frail I am, how weak I am, how
[58:29] easily tricked I am into sin.
[58:33] How easily we just give into little
[58:34] jokes and little stories, not even
[58:36] realizing we grieve the Holy Ghost till
[58:38] later.
[58:47] Like I told you this story. I had one
[58:49] person it was what? Last year last year
[58:53] I had one person uh was disappointed in
[58:56] me and they came right to my face and
[58:58] said I promise you I will not tell
[59:00] anybody about this that I'm disappointed
[59:02] in you and I and of course I believed I
[59:04] was
[59:05] innocent. That person went that same
[59:08] very same day that person told me that
[59:10] they went off walking and came talking
[59:13] with somebody at a park someone else who
[59:15] didn't like me. And that person lured
[59:18] the person in to gossiping about me. And
[59:21] how do I know? Because the person called
[59:23] me up and repented and told me the whole
[59:26] story. Church, we can be like that. I'm
[59:28] leaving here. I'm never doing that
[59:30] again. And and then within a few hours,
[59:32] we give into it was only three hours,
[59:33] maybe less, maybe two hours. I won't do
[59:36] that again. I'm I'm determined. I I
[59:38] promise. And we go back and lie right
[59:41] through our teeth.
[59:43] Now, I appreciate the spirit of God that
[59:44] brought the the repentance, don't you?
[59:47] Hallelujah. But that's the point I'm
[59:49] making. We're so easily so easily
[59:52] somebody just has to bring it up again
[59:53] and then we forget about the promises we
[59:55] made or forget about the pledge we made
[59:57] or oh, I'll try to do better. You forget
[59:59] all about
[1:00:01] that. That's why God gives us grace.
[1:00:04] Hallelujah. That's why God gives us
[1:00:06] mercy.
[1:00:11] So when the fire of God's on you, you'll
[1:00:12] say, "God, help me to know. Am I bride
[1:00:15] or am I foolish
[1:00:17] virgin? Am I going to go in the rapture
[1:00:19] or am I going to the grave?" There's
[1:00:20] nothing wrong with wondering that. The
[1:00:22] spirit of God makes you wonder that.
[1:00:24] Huh? Yeah, that's right. The spirit of
[1:00:27] God. And Lord, help me to see how frail
[1:00:30] I am. Help, show me how weak I am in the
[1:00:32] flesh so I can strengthen my spirit so I
[1:00:36] don't fall again into that same sin.
[1:00:39] Does everybody understand that?
[1:00:42] Verse five, behold, thou hast made my
[1:00:44] days as a hand breath. Remember hand
[1:00:46] breath, elbow to the middle finger. My
[1:00:48] days are like this. Well, if I'm 44 and
[1:00:51] I start right here, I'm already a little
[1:00:52] past halfway. I'm getting towards the
[1:00:55] end, church. I know I always joke around
[1:00:57] about that, but that's the
[1:00:59] truth. And mine age is as nothing before
[1:01:02] thee. So here he says now he know
[1:01:04] recognize he's in eternity. Verily,
[1:01:06] every man at his best day is altogether
[1:01:08] vanity. Malc and I have been going to
[1:01:10] the gym. We walk past those big uh those
[1:01:13] big posters of Arnold Schwarzenegger and
[1:01:15] those old ladies are tapping at his
[1:01:16] muscles like that's really
[1:01:18] big. Look at him
[1:01:21] now. Yeah, he might have a little bit
[1:01:22] but he's nothing like he was. He's all
[1:01:25] all thinned up and everything. It's all
[1:01:28] together. And what did it get
[1:01:30] him? He committed adultery against his
[1:01:33] wife. His wife left him. His first wife
[1:01:35] left him with a nanny. He committed
[1:01:37] adultery with a nanny. Where's that get
[1:01:39] you? Where's that money and all that
[1:01:40] fame and muscle? Where did that get you?
[1:01:42] On the road to hell. Because the Bible
[1:01:44] said the adulterous woman will take a
[1:01:46] man to the roads of hell. Leads him to
[1:01:48] hell. I hope he
[1:01:51] repents. But all every man, no matter
[1:01:53] how great you are, no matter how great
[1:01:54] they have muscles and all money they
[1:01:56] got, it's altogether vain. The only
[1:01:58] thing that matters, as Solomon said, is
[1:02:00] fear the Lord and keep his commands.
[1:02:02] Hallelujah. Now I'm spitting. Forgive
[1:02:06] me. That's right, church. That's
[1:02:09] right. Surely they are disqu I'm sorry,
[1:02:12] disqued in vain. Verse six, he heth up
[1:02:14] riches and knoweth not who shall gather
[1:02:16] them. Then they're worried about who's
[1:02:17] going to get my uh who's going to get my
[1:02:19] inheritance? Who how's it going to
[1:02:20] happen? Like that even matters. Is your
[1:02:23] soul ready for heaven? That's the
[1:02:27] question. Surely I'm sorry. I already
[1:02:30] read that. Verse seven. And now Lord,
[1:02:32] what uh what wait I for? My hope is in
[1:02:36] thee. So the spirit of God is on him
[1:02:38] saying, "God, I can only hope in you. I
[1:02:40] can't hope in riches. I've got to watch
[1:02:43] my tongue." Hallelujah. Help me to know
[1:02:45] what's my end going to be. What's the
[1:02:47] end of my life going to
[1:02:50] be? You know that one preacher I told
[1:02:52] you who died and his uh uh his grandson
[1:02:56] was crying about it. That man told me,
[1:02:58] no, I'm sorry. It was that man's uh wife
[1:03:01] told me that he had said, "I don't want
[1:03:04] to suffer when I die. I just want to go
[1:03:05] quickly." And God even answered that
[1:03:08] prayer because he had a heart attack. He
[1:03:10] didn't feel nothing and then he didn't
[1:03:11] respond. They lifellighted him to the
[1:03:13] hospital and he never responded after
[1:03:15] that. So even in that little thing he
[1:03:17] wanted he wanted to know his end. He
[1:03:19] asked for his end to come out a certain
[1:03:20] way and God even honored that. Talk
[1:03:22] about the love of
[1:03:24] God. The love of
[1:03:28] God. Verse eight. Deliver me from all my
[1:03:31] transgressions. And the church said,
[1:03:33] "Deliver me from myself." Hallelujah.
[1:03:37] Deliver me from my own worst enemy,
[1:03:40] myself.
[1:03:41] Yourself. Make me not the reproach of
[1:03:44] the foolish. Help. In other words, help
[1:03:46] me not to sin and say evil things around
[1:03:47] foolish people that will then make fun
[1:03:49] of me and mock me and then they'll
[1:03:50] they'll basically bring reproach upon
[1:03:52] Christ. There's my hour. I'm almost
[1:03:55] done. Just can't get away from that hour
[1:03:57] sermon. Just can't get away from it.
[1:03:59] Verse nine. I was dumb. I open not my
[1:04:02] mouth because thou did it. Amen. So see,
[1:04:05] God intervenes. When that burning fire
[1:04:07] of the Holy Ghost is on you, it'll
[1:04:08] intervene and keep you from
[1:04:11] sinning. That's right,
[1:04:14] church. Verse 10, remove thy stroke away
[1:04:17] from me. I am consumed by the blow of
[1:04:20] thine hand. So he even considers it
[1:04:22] God's chastening. God is giving him a
[1:04:25] we'd say a
[1:04:27] spanking because of his what? His words,
[1:04:29] right? his iniquity, his evil
[1:04:31] words. So, see, you get the spirit of
[1:04:33] judgment first. Judge yourself. Have you
[1:04:35] been sinning? Well, admit it, confess
[1:04:37] it, and then the Holy Ghost will come on
[1:04:39] you. You'll try to do better next time.
[1:04:41] And you will do better. Hallelujah. You
[1:04:43] will because it's God delivering you.
[1:04:45] It's God becoming your hope and your
[1:04:47] strength. Hallelujah. My hope is in
[1:04:51] Christ. Verse 11. When thou with rebukes
[1:04:56] dust correct man for his iniquity, thou
[1:04:58] makest his beauty to consume away like a
[1:05:00] moth. Surely every man is v in vanity.
[1:05:02] Sa. So meditate on that, right? Say
[1:05:05] meditate on
[1:05:07] that. Hear my prayer, oh Lord, and give
[1:05:10] ear unto my cry. Hold not thy peace at
[1:05:12] my tears. Hallelujah. For I am a
[1:05:14] stranger with thee and a sojourer as all
[1:05:18] my fathers were. Oh, spare me that I may
[1:05:20] recover strength before I go hence and
[1:05:22] be no more. Now, church, I could make a
[1:05:25] I could make an argument. He was strong.
[1:05:27] You know why I say that? Because he was
[1:05:30] watching what came out of his mouth.
[1:05:33] That's when you and I are strong. When
[1:05:34] we're trying not to sin, we're just not
[1:05:37] walking around say, "Well, it's okay. I
[1:05:39] can do this. I can say that. I can do
[1:05:40] whatever I want." No. But when you're
[1:05:42] when you're weak, glory, when you're
[1:05:43] weak, then you're strong. Hallelujah.
[1:05:46] See that? But he felt weak because of
[1:05:48] the the the judgment of God upon him,
[1:05:51] the burning of God upon him. Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] He said, "God, I feel weak. God, make me
[1:05:57] strong. My hope is in you, Jesus."
[1:05:59] Hallelujah. Oh, that's the only hope we
[1:06:01] got tonight, church. The only hope you
[1:06:03] brothers got to overcome the the the
[1:06:05] pleasure of this world. The only hope
[1:06:06] you brothers got is Jesus. That's it.
[1:06:09] Hallelujah. Sisters, the temptations you
[1:06:11] battle, the only hope you have is Jesus
[1:06:13] Christ. That's the only way you're going
[1:06:15] to overcome. He's the only hope you
[1:06:17] have. Praise God. To be honest before
[1:06:19] him, confess your sins. Let the spirit
[1:06:21] of judgment anoint you. Confess your
[1:06:23] sins to God. You don't have to tell me.
[1:06:24] Confess it to Jesus. Hallelujah. And
[1:06:26] then the spirit of God will come upon
[1:06:28] you and burn up any desires, make you
[1:06:31] clean. And in this case, hallelujah.
[1:06:34] What does the Holy Ghost
[1:06:37] do for Isaiah? Burning put him into
[1:06:40] service. Jeremiah, the burning kept him
[1:06:43] from quitting his service. Cleopus and
[1:06:46] his friend. The burning dissolved his
[1:06:47] their doubts about their service. And
[1:06:49] with David, he had the burning to know
[1:06:52] and understand the length of his
[1:06:56] service. God was going to show him how
[1:06:58] long a life he lived. Hallelujah. That
[1:07:01] was his question. How much time do I
[1:07:04] got? What's the measure of my days,
[1:07:06] Lord? What's going to be the end? How's
[1:07:08] it all going to turn out?
[1:07:11] And the Holy Ghost and fire burnt in his
[1:07:14] heart and said, "Deliverance comes from
[1:07:17] God. My hope is in God." See, once you
[1:07:19] have God as your hope, it doesn't matter
[1:07:21] what the ending is because you already
[1:07:22] got the you already got the answer.
[1:07:24] Amen. Hallelujah. You've already got
[1:07:26] Christ, the living hope. Hallelujah.
[1:07:28] He's our peace. He's our hope. He's our
[1:07:29] victory. He's our life. He's everything.
[1:07:31] Praise God. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:07:34] Musicians can come.
