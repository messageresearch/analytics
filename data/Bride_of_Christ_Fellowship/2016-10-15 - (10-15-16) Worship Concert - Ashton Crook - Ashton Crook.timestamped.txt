[16:06] you may be seated before he comes here
[16:08] we I just want to introduce again
[16:09] brother Ashton's been a great friend to
[16:11] me tremendous example with his music as
[16:14] I was telling brother Austin here he's
[16:17] an aspiring musician I said you're in
[16:19] the right place tonight because you're
[16:20] gonna see a brother who is consecrated
[16:23] he gives his time and his efforts and
[16:26] supports fully supports the the the
[16:28] gifts and talents that God has given to
[16:30] him and they've been such a tremendous
[16:32] blessing in my life Austin as a young
[16:33] Christian his music was such a a key
[16:36] influence in my life and I really thank
[16:38] God for that and it continues to be a
[16:40] great blessing too so I know we can all
[16:42] gain a lot from tonight and praise is so
[16:45] wonderful so he's all the way from Lima
[16:47] so we're very appreciative of the travel
[16:49] he made if you don't have one of his two
[16:51] CDs let me know if you can't afford it
[16:53] I'll buy you one I bought the church on
[16:55] some about two three years ago so if you
[16:56] need some good Christian music that's it
[16:58] by God Grace you really like that so as
[17:01] our brother comes he's going to come and
[17:02] sing I think first with the mic got a
[17:04] little bit of adjusting to do with the
[17:06] sound and so forth like that let's give
[17:07] the Lord Round of Applause
[17:12] as it's very kind appreciate the
[17:16] introduction um I just thank you guys so
[17:19] much for the opportunity to uh come here
[17:21] tonight I'm G have to kind of stand
[17:22] probably over here with the soundtracks
[17:24] it's where the speakers are so you can
[17:25] actually hear the music so it's not like
[17:27] anybody's in the front row anyway
[17:31] but anyway just really appreciate the
[17:32] opportunity to come here tonight and and
[17:34] sing and be a blessing and I don't want
[17:35] this to be about me I want this to about
[17:37] the Lord the purpose is not to be seen
[17:39] or heard the purpose is to glorify the
[17:41] Lord so these uh these songs the Lord
[17:43] has given over over a process of time I
[17:46] probably started writing songs when I
[17:48] was the first album I did was back in
[17:52] 200 2007 I think it was so it was it I'd
[17:56] been writing songs before then but never
[17:58] really really did anything with them um
[18:02] but and i' I've looked back over the
[18:03] years and and my songwriting my style
[18:05] has definitely changed and I I feel like
[18:08] the songs that I'm writing currently are
[18:10] much more reflective of who I am
[18:12] whenever you see a song somebody who
[18:13] writes a song or even a minister what
[18:16] what what they are what they're bringing
[18:17] forth whether it be a sermon or a song
[18:19] that they're actually writing it's a
[18:21] reflection of who they are who they are
[18:23] their hearts and it's reflection of
[18:25] where they are with God it really really
[18:27] is so sometimes I I've struggled in the
[18:30] past with actually getting up and
[18:31] singing a song in front of people
[18:32] because I feel like I'm just totally
[18:33] laying my heart out on the table for
[18:34] everybody to see in a congregation um
[18:37] because there there's one of the songs
[18:38] here tonight that and I'll go into a
[18:40] little bit more um just it's it's
[18:42] reflective of where I am at that
[18:43] particular time in my life and what
[18:45] maybe situation I was going through
[18:46] different trial different circumstance
[18:48] whatever it was so sometimes you you
[18:51] struggle with being transparent in front
[18:52] of a bunch of people um and you know I'm
[18:55] sure pastors and ministers feel that way
[18:57] with sermons they feel like I'm just
[18:59] gonna totally offend everybody or
[19:02] totally um make people think of me
[19:05] poorly or or you know whatever it may be
[19:07] but the gifts and callings without
[19:09] repentance and they're not for ourselves
[19:11] they're for the body of Christ and
[19:12] they're ultimately for God so I just
[19:14] pray this is a blessing tonight I've got
[19:15] some cheat sheets in my pockets with
[19:17] words if anybody feels like singing in I
[19:20] know I know lot lot of the kids here
[19:22] know some of these songs so please feel
[19:23] free to sing along you can also then
[19:25] help me out the words and if I won't
[19:27] forget anything
[19:29] you can go ahead brother Jesse with
[19:30] first

[23:30] no actually I I wrote it after I got
[23:32] done watching a
[23:34] movie long story um so we we'll go to uh
[23:38] the next one this song is a an old old
[23:41] old song I can't remember how long I
[23:43] wrote this song but uh it's on my my
[23:45] first album which I look back at that
[23:47] first album and just want to shake my
[23:48] head sometimes but um could I have a
[23:51] little more mic if it's
[23:54] possible so anyway this is an old old
[23:58] song and hope it's a blessing to
[24:01] [Music]
[24:05] you when the burdens get too heavy and
[24:10] the load you cannot Bear for the trials
[24:15] all surround you and you feel like no
[24:19] one
[24:20] cares well there's a strength that's
[24:23] stronger than yours and that strength is
[24:27] the Lord for he's got a set of
[24:31] shoulders that are
[24:33] stronger yours so just cast your heavy
[24:39] bir cast them on the
[24:44] Lord for God will help you bear your
[24:48] load if you'll just trust his word why
[24:52] don't you cast your heavy
[24:56] bir cast them all the
[25:01] Lord for he's got a set of shoulders
[25:05] that a
[25:08] strongs
[25:15] amen you don't need to Bear your trials
[25:19] alone your trials God will
[25:23] bear if he sees a little Sparrow fall
[25:27] then for you you he surely
[25:30] cares God's counted every one of your
[25:34] hairs and he knows your beginning and
[25:37] end so just cast your burdens on him for
[25:43] you can depend on him why don't cast
[25:47] your heavy
[25:49] bir cast them on the
[25:54] Lord for God will help you be your load
[25:59] if you'll just trust his word why don't
[26:03] you cast your heavy
[26:06] bir cast them on the
[26:11] Lord for he's got a set of shoulders
[26:16] that
[26:17] stronger your
[26:21] well why don't you cast your heavy
[26:26] bird cast them on the
[26:31] Lord for God will help you bear your
[26:35] load if you'll just trust his word why
[26:39] don't you cast your
[26:43] heavy cast them on
[26:48] Lord he a of shoulders that are stronger
[26:54] than yours well he's a got a set
[27:07] shoulders
[27:09] stronger
[27:12] [Music]
[27:13] yours
[27:15] [Music]
[27:19] amen you know I think so often we do try
[27:22] to Bear our trials alone and and I like
[27:25] I like the one part of the song where it
[27:27] says he'll you know he'll bear our
[27:29] burdens if we'll just trust his word
[27:31] amen we got to trust his word that what
[27:33] he says that he will do but if we're not
[27:35] trusting his word then he's not
[27:38] obligated to to Bear our burdens for us
[27:40] and and I think so oftentimes we we try
[27:43] to Bear our burdens ourselves you know
[27:45] we try to be our own burden bear we try
[27:47] to be our own strongman our own ox but
[27:51] but we got to trust his word we
[27:54] absolutely have to trust his word
[27:56] um this next song is is also an old one
[28:00] it it goes back to um my brother at the
[28:03] time in his life he was trying to go
[28:04] through some this is been probably 10
[28:07] years ago he was going through some
[28:08] decisions in his life and just kind of a
[28:10] turning point with what am I going to do
[28:12] with my career what am going to do with
[28:13] my future all that kind of stuff you
[28:15] know he was at the time he was at a
[28:18] marable marriageable age and looking to
[28:21] start his career going to college just
[28:23] had multiple decisions in his life that
[28:25] he was trying to to find what what is
[28:26] the best thing to do what should I do in
[28:29] this situation ETA so he went to uh
[28:31] brother Barry coffee and was talking
[28:33] with brother Barry coffee and asking him
[28:35] some questions about you know you know
[28:37] his future and and what's the best way
[28:39] to make this decision and and brother
[28:41] Barry just said just stop just enjoy the
[28:45] journey just enjoy the journey and I
[28:47] think so oftentimes we we get so focused
[28:49] on what do I do with this what do I do
[28:52] with this what am I going to do with
[28:53] this situation how do I make this
[28:54] decision and and really it just comes
[28:57] down to we're on a journey and the Lord
[28:59] is with us on that Journey he's never
[29:00] going to leave us or forsake us he stays
[29:03] with us he's never going to leave us so
[29:05] just enjoy the journey and just trust
[29:08] him that he is our guide he's never
[29:10] going to put anything in front of our
[29:12] paths that he doesn't know is going to
[29:14] it's already he's already planned it he
[29:16] already knows what's coming down the
[29:18] pike so to speak so nothing catches God
[29:21] by surprise Hallelujah he's got it all
[29:23] in control so just enjoy the journey
[29:26] okay just just rest just trust in him
[29:29] and and and if we keep taking things
[29:31] back and and and we do that when we say
[29:34] well what am I going to do about this
[29:35] what I going to do about that that's
[29:36] what worry and anxiety comes in is when
[29:38] we're trying to take the control
[29:39] ourselves but if we just enjoy the
[29:42] journey and just commit it to the Lord
[29:45] he will our gentle Shepherd will never
[29:47] lead us astray so that's that's where
[29:49] this song comes
[29:57] in
[30:00] [Music]
[30:07] are you worried about
[30:10] tomorrow does your future seem
[30:13] unclear are you facing many trials and
[30:18] overwhelmed by your
[30:20] [Music]
[30:21] fears just trust in Jesus for he can
[30:25] take your doubts away
[30:28] L to his gentle voice
[30:33] [Music]
[30:35] he's enjoy the journey for I've got a
[30:39] plan for

[31:17] rough and have you lost your way are you
[31:21] trusting another
[31:23] guide and has he led you astray
[31:29] give the map to Jesus for he's been this
[31:32] way

[32:27] me leave the way and your darkest night
[32:31] will soon become the breaking of the
[32:39] day
[32:41] [Music]
[32:56] amen
[33:18] this next one
[33:21] um it's just been a few months ago can I
[33:24] have a little more with Mike a chance
[33:28] testing testing that it's better I don't
[33:30] know if it's too much though we'll
[33:36] see thank
[33:42] [Music]
[33:54] you there was a a situation of change in
[33:57] our lives
[33:59] and you know sometimes change is good
[34:01] and sometimes
[34:03] all all change is
[34:06] wonderful let's just put it that way
[34:09] because without change we would never
[34:10] grow right we would always stay stagnant
[34:13] we would never overcome who would never
[34:14] grow um and some but sometimes you know
[34:17] when God brings change into our lives
[34:19] the flesh doesn't like it very much
[34:21] right which is this was kind of the
[34:22] situation I was in was kind of in a
[34:25] situation where I was out of my
[34:27] completely out of my comfort zone
[34:28] completely out of my what I wanted in my
[34:31] flesh so to speak and was basically
[34:34] thrown into situation that I I knew as
[34:35] of God and knew I was walking with God
[34:37] and God was in it and he was ordaining
[34:39] all of it but my flesh didn't like it
[34:41] very much and I literally felt very very
[34:43] much alone and very much kind of like
[34:45] Elijah felt on the back side of the
[34:46] desert and there's there's
[34:48] been you know when Elijah was on the
[34:51] backside of the desert he he was a
[34:53] prophet and he had undergone a great
[34:56] moment in his life of inspiration we had
[34:58] a word from the Lord and he had came up
[35:00] to this big big peak so to speak in his
[35:03] ministry had this word from the Lord for
[35:05] the the current situation in his day and
[35:08] then right after that the inspiration
[35:10] left and he crashed so to speak he
[35:13] crashed emotionally physically he was
[35:15] exhausted and that happens a lot of
[35:17] times with inspiration is you you get
[35:18] this inspiration this word from the Lord
[35:20] and then you you have a very low time
[35:22] and he he felt at that point in time of
[35:24] his life that he was on the back side of
[35:26] the desert and was feeling very you know
[35:29] alone and very empty and worthless so to
[35:31] speak felt like he had no point in his
[35:34] life you know at that point in time you
[35:36] know why am I here why did I why did God
[35:39] just bring me to this why did God fead
[35:41] me in this and now just lead me to this
[35:44] you know all all of this was for nothing
[35:47] and and it was in that time when God
[35:49] spoke to him but didn't speak to them
[35:51] through the howling winds or the fire or
[35:53] you know great big loud noises or signs
[35:56] and wonders but it just spoke to him
[35:58] through a still Small Voice and and that
[36:01] was in and this this story in the Bible
[36:03] came to
[36:04] me and it it reminded me that when we're
[36:08] on the back side of the desert the word
[36:10] of God is our everything that that is
[36:13] what we have is is the word of God
[36:16] because it is our bread it is our food
[36:18] it is our drink it is all that we have
[36:20] need of is in the word of God so it's in
[36:22] those backside of the desert when that
[36:24] word of God comes forth and speaks to us
[36:26] and reminds us that we are not alone we
[36:28] are not in this situation for not that
[36:30] God is in this so this is that's kind of
[36:33] where this comes from
[36:37] [Music]
[36:42] so I'm on the backside of the
[36:47] desert it's a dry
[36:51] Wilderness empty be and
[36:55] broken void
[36:59] lifeless I sit under the juniper
[37:02] tree feeling worthless
[37:07] inside
[37:09] thirsty and
[37:11] hungry for bread to sustain my life I
[37:16] hear a still Small Voice M the howling
[37:23] winds his words Quicken my soul

[48:25] St
[48:35] this next song has has meant a lot to me
[48:37] over the years there was a time in my
[48:39] life when I was experiencing a lot of
[48:40] anxiety and different things in my life
[48:42] were going on and and this this the lord
[48:44] gave me this song and it's always been
[48:47] there you know it's always sometimes
[48:50] when you have a gift you don't realize
[48:52] that or you need to reminded that the
[48:54] gift isn't for yourself all right you
[48:56] know it's other people but there are
[48:57] times when your gift comes along and
[48:59] blesses you when when God gives you
[49:01] something and it comes along and it
[49:02] actually blesses you and ministers to
[49:04] you at a time when you needed the most
[49:06] and that's kind of where this song has
[49:07] come in there's been other times
[49:09] throughout my life when I when I was

[49:34] glad that we have a hiding place covert
[49:36] from the storm a sanctuary a place that
[49:39] we can go we know that we are safe and
[49:43] and it's our own fault if we leave The
[49:45] Refuge that's our own fault you know we
[49:46] have to stay behind the Refuge behind
[49:48] that wall of the word but we have a

[55:28] thank you Jesus thank
[55:38] you
[55:55] Hallelujah
[56:02] this next one I'm going to skip thater
[56:04] to the end brother Jesse go
[56:06] to further up and further in um this
[56:10] next one actually kind of a story behind
[56:13] it um it comes from the last battle by
[56:17] CS Lewis the the phrase the last battle
[56:20] the the phrase there's a phrase in the
[56:21] last battle by CS Lewis where all the
[56:24] animals are they've entered into the new
[56:26] Narnia they've entered into the new land
[56:29] the new world and um they one of them
[56:33] says I think it might be the Raven or I
[56:35] can't remember which one it says come
[56:36] further up come further in and uh that
[56:39] just always struck me and and how that
[56:43] this this world that we have is a shadow
[56:46] of of what we have to come it is just a
[56:49] shadow of what is of the reality that we
[56:52] have to come amen
[56:55] and
[56:57] and what I what I liked about that book
[56:59] was that it it showed that the reality
[57:01] is being just so much more crystal clear
[57:04] so much more real so much more beautiful
[57:06] so much more vibrant so many more colors
[57:10] um and and we and we have a reality that
[57:13] that is that is ahead of us yeah we just
[57:15] have to come further up and come further
[57:17] in in in the word and in Christ and then
[57:21] the uh now we see through a glass Darkly
[57:24] but then face to face so now we're
[57:26] looking through a glass Darkly so to
[57:27] speak we're we're in the flesh we're in
[57:30] these in these bodies of Flesh in this
[57:32] world that is so dark but then we shall
[57:34] know is even we are also as as we are
[57:36] known because then will be our reality
[57:39] um and so that that's kind of where this
[57:42] this song comes from is uh is is come
[57:45] further up come further and that's it I
[57:48] had I actually written this song years
[57:51] years years ago and and just and didn't
[57:54] like the version didn't like the way it
[57:55] was coming out so I just kind of put on
[57:57] the shelf and said I'm just going to
[57:58] wait and just give it to the Lord and
[58:00] let see what happens and at that time
[58:02] and then you know several years ago at
[58:04] the ministry change CER at BCF and and
[58:08] and that that song came back to me and
[58:10] and the song just totally changed itself
[58:14] under a different ministry under a
[58:15] different headship that I don't believe
[58:17] that could have ever been that way under
[58:18] the previous Ministry and and so it it
[58:21] definitely was much more what I wanted
[58:24] it to be so to speak so
[58:27] [Music]
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:36] [Music]
[58:45] there's darkness in the
[58:49] land it's black as

[1:03:39] let you can skip to
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:44] um don't pull away from
[1:03:48] God there's
[1:03:51] a probably oh probably 10 years ago at
[1:03:56] the time our our church youth group had
[1:03:58] a uh a little prayer group so to speak a
[1:04:01] little prayer group that met on Mondays
[1:04:03] or Tuesday evenings every evening and it
[1:04:05] was just the youth it was mostly the
[1:04:06] older youth that would would meet and
[1:04:08] have a prayer meeting um and it was a
[1:04:10] really really nice time to that kind of
[1:04:13] bound the the youth together in a very
[1:04:15] very special way I know there's
[1:04:17] definitely some relationships and
[1:04:18] friendships that were forged in that
[1:04:21] time under you know under a good
[1:04:22] atmosphere under prayer that have
[1:04:25] definitely endured so you know so to
[1:04:27] speak because there was very special you
[1:04:29] had the group of core group of kids
[1:04:31] young people in their latter teens in
[1:04:33] early 20s that were really committed on
[1:04:35] fire for the Lord and were really trying
[1:04:37] to serve the Lord and we're and were
[1:04:40] there at the prayer meeting for the
[1:04:41] right reasons and it was led by you know
[1:04:43] the older youth um so anyway there was
[1:04:46] there was a young man who had started
[1:04:47] coming to the church for for a while and
[1:04:50] everybody had he had had an addiction
[1:04:52] with with pornography um and with some
[1:04:56] with some struggles in his life and he
[1:05:00] had actually lost his wife as a result
[1:05:03] of the his addictions and struggles and
[1:05:06] um he was trying to get his life back
[1:05:10] you know right with God and he was
[1:05:12] started coming to church and was was
[1:05:14] trying to do what was right and
[1:05:15] everybody was investing a lot in his
[1:05:17] life and praying for him and and really
[1:05:20] trying to encourage him and be a friend
[1:05:22] to him in a time when he really needed
[1:05:24] that most um and so the process of time
[1:05:28] went on and he was coming to church and
[1:05:29] he was coming to the youth prayer
[1:05:30] meetings and trying to do what was right
[1:05:31] and then all of a sudden he just kind of
[1:05:33] quit coming and just and just completely
[1:05:35] stopped and just pulled away from
[1:05:37] everybody wouldn't wouldn't return phone
[1:05:39] calls wouldn't you return texts quit
[1:05:41] coming to church quit quit coming to the
[1:05:43] the prayer meetings all of this and it
[1:05:45] just and everybody just was very very
[1:05:48] heartbroken because they had spent so
[1:05:49] much of their time and their energy and
[1:05:51] their emotions and prayers and into this
[1:05:54] young man and and to see him just
[1:05:57] basically you know withdraw from all of
[1:06:00] that and and it it was very very sad and
[1:06:02] very heartbreaking he ended up um he's
[1:06:05] not serving the lord as best I know now
[1:06:08] but he you know
[1:06:10] had had gone through this period of time
[1:06:12] of you know kind of Revival in his life
[1:06:15] and then just kind of pulled away from
[1:06:17] God and it and it's so typical of of
[1:06:20] human
[1:06:21] beings and it you it goes all the way
[1:06:23] back to the Garden of Eden when when and
[1:06:25] Eve sinned that rather than go to the
[1:06:31] one who could be their source of healing
[1:06:34] and Redemption and
[1:06:37] salvation they did what human beings
[1:06:40] are from the beginning of time they're
[1:06:43] going to pull away withdraw
[1:06:45] hide and and that's the last thing that
[1:06:48] any of us need to do when we're
[1:06:49] struggling the last thing we need to do
[1:06:52] is is to pull away and withdraw and
[1:06:54] isolate ourselves because when we
[1:06:55] isolate ourselves the devil then is able
[1:06:58] to work and is able to speak to us and
[1:07:01] is we're on his playing Ground so to
[1:07:04] speak you know when we isolate ourselves
[1:07:05] and withdraw from God and from other
[1:07:07] fellow Believers that is when the devil
[1:07:09] is able to to get in and and work and
[1:07:12] move and speak his lies and and and so I
[1:07:16] think so that's where this song came
[1:07:18] from it actually it came from this young
[1:07:21] man and um you know it's a very very sad
[1:07:24] situation but it's it's always this song
[1:07:27] has always meant a lot to me because it
[1:07:29] it it has a has a very dear memory it
[1:07:32] has a very special time in my life um
[1:07:35] when I was you know trying to witness to
[1:07:37] somebody and and and trying to be a
[1:07:40] blessing and and it was heart-wrenching
[1:07:42] it truly was heart-wrenching when you
[1:07:43] give all of yourself and your faith and
[1:07:46] what you hold the closest to you try to
[1:07:49] give that to somebody and they receive
[1:07:51] it and then they turn away from you and
[1:07:53] drop it and and and walk away from all
[1:07:56] of it it it is heart-wrenching because
[1:07:58] that's you have what they need you have
[1:08:01] life you have the words of life to give
[1:08:03] to
[1:08:04] them and and Christ is all that we need
[1:08:08] he is our everything he's completely all
[1:08:10] that we need um so that's that's where
[1:08:12] this song comes from there's it's it's
[1:08:14] just been a very special I remember I as
[1:08:16] I had written the song I I I and
[1:08:19] everybody had we were we were at the
[1:08:20] youth meeting at that time and I had
[1:08:22] just written the song and everybody was
[1:08:24] actually you know was was very
[1:08:25] devastated very hurt and I sang the song
[1:08:27] and people were crying because they they
[1:08:30] it resonated with their heart it
[1:08:32] resonated with who they were and and and
[1:08:34] the struggle that was going on in their
[1:08:36] lives at that time so this has always
[1:08:38] just been one of my my favorites and you
