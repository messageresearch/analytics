[42:49] much to me this video right here so
[42:52] we're very thankful for that
[42:53] one thing's for sure you cannot destroy
[42:56] God's truth and when we make just these
[42:59] simple videos there I make them you know
[43:01] and I post them there Satan will never
[43:03] be able to stop the truth of God it is
[43:06] going to get to every seat of God that
[43:07] needs to hear it and so like we'll see
[43:09] tonight where look at some of the
[43:10] missionaries from the Philadelphia
[43:13] Church you're actually one in particular
[43:14] but we'll see that no matter how how it
[43:18] seemed like they struggled God was in it
[43:20] amen God was saving souls in the midst
[43:22] of it and God was going to plant and use
[43:25] that those efforts of the missionaries
[43:27] and use the efforts of the preachers to
[43:29] bring forth more souls into the kingdom
[43:32] of God so we're just trying to do that
[43:34] by God's grace like I said share the
[43:37] Word of God here and thank you asking
[43:39] God to direct it to every path every
[43:42] person that needs to hear the message of
[43:43] the hour now you and I received it most
[43:45] of us through Bible studies right but
[43:48] there are some of us that may have
[43:49] received it through the internet like
[43:50] maybe brother Adam you know through
[43:51] sister but maybe he received it there or
[43:54] maybe he first heard about it through
[43:55] the internet so we want God to use
[43:57] whatever channel he chooses to bring the
[44:01] message to God's people amen
[44:04] so let's look at this here tonight we're
[44:05] on part nine here of this series in part
[44:09] 49 of the overall series and we read our
[44:12] text tonight it was I know thy works
[44:14] behold I have set before thee an open
[44:16] door and no man can shut it for thou
[44:18] hast a little strength and has kept my
[44:20] word and it's not denied my name Amen
[44:25] now
[44:28] I'm gonna skip past that one now I'm
[44:31] gonna try to finish tonight on this
[44:32] thought of the open door there was so
[44:36] much in the 1960's sermon like I said he
[44:38] spent almost an hour and a half just on
[44:40] the open door thoughts and so tonight I
[44:43] want to try to finish on the open door
[44:45] and then next time we'll keep going into
[44:48] some more of the thoughts like the
[44:49] reward and the promise to the believer
[44:52] all the promises so let's start with
[44:55] this here the Prophet said now getting
[44:57] back to the open mission of door of the
[45:00] Philadelphia Church age it did not have
[45:02] the open door power it ought to have had
[45:05] notice in the same verse he mentions
[45:07] this open door he says thou has a little
[45:09] strength that's right the power of the
[45:12] Spirit was missing in that age I mean oh
[45:14] John Wesley had some miracles right we
[45:16] know some another gentleman had miracles
[45:17] but as a whole the power of God was
[45:20] missing the Word was well preached it
[45:24] was well able to make Souls wise unto
[45:26] salvation but the great power of God
[45:29] that showed forth his mighty works that
[45:30] made bear his arm in behalf of his own
[45:34] was missing except amongst the scattered
[45:35] groups yet praise God it was growing and
[45:40] had increased over what they had in the
[45:43] Reformation
[45:44] how many can say praise God for that God
[45:47] was starting to restore remember in the
[45:50] Sardis Church age was Luther's church
[45:52] age brother Branham said that dead stock
[45:54] or that dead plant went to seed in the
[45:57] seed brought forth and brought forth the
[45:59] stock right and then that was Luther's
[46:01] age of stock and then now we're getting
[46:03] some leaves with Wesley hallelujah but
[46:07] praise God it's growing
[46:08] how many can say thank God the Word of
[46:11] God is growing in my life remember
[46:14] brother Graham said never judge yourself
[46:15] by how many miracles you do but judge
[46:17] yourself by how much fruit of the Spirit
[46:19] you're presently producing so you see
[46:21] your life producing forgiveness
[46:23] producing long-suffering producing
[46:25] patience producing love amen if you see
[46:28] yourself producing these things then we
[46:30] ought to praise God for that because
[46:32] it's important see it was growing and
[46:34] increased over what they had in the
[46:36] Reformation now remember I showed this a
[46:39] couple weeks ago no one was here except
[46:40] Malachi and Lydia's I don't know who was
[46:42] able to watch this but I just wanted to
[46:44] give a little visual this was the age of
[46:47] the open door Satan
[46:49] married Satan married the church and
[46:51] state and Pergamos and the Prophet said
[46:54] God gave them three ages because
[46:57] everything's finished in threes but then
[46:59] in this Philadelphia age now they now
[47:01] Jesus gets the open door right because
[47:03] he gets these last two ages to fully
[47:05] open the door of the word of the name of
[47:09] God who he is
[47:10] all the strength of God the power of God
[47:12] the the revelation of the Godhead that's
[47:15] the open door because Jesus said I am
[47:17] the door amen
[47:19] so we know we're a part of this and are
[47:22] our last ages the continuation of the
[47:25] Philadelphia Church age and I just again
[47:27] have this little sorry I don't mean to
[47:29] keep going over that but Luther Wesley
[47:31] there's where their lives overlap
[47:33] there's brother branham's day
[47:34] here's what I want to get to brother
[47:36] Branham said the open age open door age
[47:38] continues until the rapture so it starts
[47:40] in Wesley's day and it continues to our
[47:44] day
[47:46] now I want to look at this missionary
[47:48] named William Carey I'm never read
[47:49] anything about his life
[47:50] anyone know okay so this is all new
[47:52] praise God I think you appreciate his
[47:54] testimony it was in this age the
[47:57] Philadelphia Church age that the man we
[47:59] often call the father of missions went
[48:01] out William Carey a village shoemaker
[48:05] who Pass heard the peculiar Baptist
[48:07] Church of at Moulton England mightily
[48:11] aroused the people by preaching on
[48:12] whether the command was given to the
[48:14] Apostles to teach all nations was not a
[48:17] blah blah I'm sorry obligatory on all
[48:21] succeeding ministers to the end of the
[48:23] world seeing that accompanying promise
[48:25] was of equal extent amen now he started
[48:30] his ministry kind of right after John
[48:32] Wesley died if you look at his we look
[48:34] at his life span next from 1761 to 1834
[48:37] so he was actually reading the writings
[48:40] of John Wesley and being inspired by the
[48:42] messenger of the hour aren't you glad
[48:43] that we can be inspired by the
[48:45] messengers of our hour I'm sorry the
[48:47] messenger rather of our our brother
[48:49] Branham through the power of the Holy
[48:50] Ghost we can read his sermons just like
[48:53] William Carey was reading the sermons of
[48:55] the messenger of his hour John Wesley
[48:57] praise God and that ought to inspire us
[49:00] and that's what inspired me to make all
[49:01] those teaching videos you know that that
[49:03] now have over a quarter million views
[49:05] what inspired me was that I thought
[49:07] everybody deserves a chance to hear the
[49:10] message of the hour and it was my burn
[49:13] and I said if my family and I said if my
[49:14] family and friends won't come to church
[49:16] maybe at least they'll watch it on
[49:18] YouTube right that was my burden
[49:20] everybody needs to hear this and and so
[49:23] I didn't I didn't feel like to travel
[49:24] overseas at that time so I said well
[49:27] I'll just sit down and make some
[49:28] teaching videos and I'm glad to see God
[49:29] using them but that's the inspiration I
[49:32] got from brother Branham because brother
[49:33] Branham said it's not fair that people
[49:35] get to hear the message over and over
[49:36] and then people overseas only get to
[49:38] hear at one time or maybe they don't get
[49:40] to hear so we want to give the
[49:42] opportunity for people to hear the word
[49:44] of God
[49:45] now I says he was fought by the
[49:49] Calvinists who had gone to the extreme
[49:51] of the doctrine of election believing
[49:53] that all who will be saved will be saved
[49:55] and missionary work would be against the
[49:57] work of the Spirit
[49:58] can you imagine the stiff starchy people
[50:01] that he faced can you imagine
[50:04] they're like oh you don't to go overseas
[50:06] oh just stay here and just serve God
[50:09] here you don't have to sacrifice you
[50:12] have to go out there and preach in other
[50:13] words you have to go to on the streets
[50:14] you have to send missionaries Oh God's
[50:17] going to save whoever he wants and he
[50:19] had to go against that demon in the name
[50:21] of Jesus amen
[50:23] he had to go against that lying spirit I
[50:25] would say all you it's not for you we
[50:28] don't need to do all that we don't we
[50:30] have to put our lives on the line and
[50:32] I'm guaranteed and well you know it by
[50:34] history that many souls were saved
[50:36] because of this man's ministry amen
[50:39] think about that if he would just
[50:41] believed all the discouraging evil
[50:43] spirits and said just make your life
[50:44] easy make your life as simple and as
[50:47] easy and as luxurious as possible but he
[50:51] went against that grain because he had
[50:53] the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen
[50:55] to see Church we should look at our
[50:57] lives and say alright what's our real
[50:59] goal in life is it to make our lives
[51:00] easier or to try to win a soul for Jesus
[51:03] we have to we have to order our lives
[51:06] and he literally changed his life in
[51:08] order to save stalls and you and I
[51:10] should have the same thing at some point
[51:12] we should have put more money into
[51:13] missions or or do something have some
[51:15] type of ministry that's what I'm gonna
[51:17] try to get to at the end have do
[51:18] something have some type of ministry to
[51:20] try to do something for Jesus amen
[51:23] now he saw the father of missions and he
[51:28] was live from 73 years from night 1761
[51:32] to 1834 and he was a missionary to India
[51:37] so just get that picture in your mind
[51:39] there of this fella here William Carey
[51:42] mighty man he the father of missionaries
[51:45] to India and he's actually called the
[51:46] father of the modern missionary movement
[51:49] because he actually left England there
[51:52] and I went into India and so we'll learn
[51:55] a little bit about that he said but
[51:58] Andrew fuller helped mr. Kerry by his
[52:00] preaching and fundraising so he got help
[52:02] fundraising such was there effect that a
[52:05] society was formed to spread the gospel
[52:07] to all nations in 1792
[52:10] this society sent out Kerry who
[52:12] signally blessed of God and winning
[52:14] souls in India in 1795 and aroused
[52:18] Christianity formed the London
[52:19] Missionary Society which went which we
[52:21] well know raised millions of pounds and
[52:24] sent thousands of missionaries over the
[52:26] years to accomplish desires of the Lord
[52:28] the Spirit of God was moving another
[52:30] sheep might well have been the cry of
[52:32] the heart of those earnest believers now
[52:37] this guy has quite a testimony he was he
[52:40] moved to India 30 to 2 years old and
[52:43] this was after a prayer meeting when he
[52:45] was 19 he was 19 years old the history
[52:48] says he walked in the prayer meeting he
[52:50] started pray and he said God to touch
[52:52] his heart and gave his heart to Lord a
[52:53] 19 years old and then he started being a
[52:56] shoe cobbler first he was fixing the
[52:57] shoes and then he became a little higher
[52:59] in society became a shoemaker and then
[53:01] he started attending the church and
[53:03] after he got saved of course and then
[53:05] pretty soon they invited him to preach
[53:06] so they must have saw something his life
[53:07] about preaching and then pretty soon he
[53:11] just had a burden he'd read the
[53:12] scripture and he had this burden too to
[53:15] want to win souls so he kept writing
[53:17] these letters and and pretty soon he
[53:18] wrote like a book we called her a
[53:20] pamphlet he wrote a book about the need
[53:22] to go overseas and it started gaining
[53:24] some steam and getting some support and
[53:27] so at 32 he moved to India as wife
[53:31] didn't want to go first she was pregnant
[53:33] but he kind of talked her into it and
[53:35] she went along with him now when he got
[53:39] there he experienced many many hardships
[53:42] these are just a few of them the death
[53:44] of some of his children his children got
[53:46] sick the death of some of the
[53:48] missionaries he was working with but the
[53:51] thing that was great that was beautiful
[53:53] about it as soon as one of them died he
[53:55] would send backward and they would send
[53:57] another missionary see they were fully
[53:59] committed to the work Amen now how many
[54:02] people do we know that are willing to go
[54:04] today there's not many the harvest is
[54:07] plentiful but the laborers are few right
[54:08] but see that's one thing when they
[54:10] caught the vision of that open door age
[54:13] they really got behind it they prayed
[54:15] about it and as soon as one man would
[54:17] fall they'd send another amen
[54:19] yes and that's kind of how it is that
[54:22] real Churches of God when somebody
[54:24] leaves the office or when someone
[54:26] leaves or something like that there's
[54:27] somebody step in there and take the
[54:29] position hey man just like on a sports
[54:32] team you know they say when somebody
[54:34] gets hurt what do they say next man up
[54:35] you heard that saying before how do they
[54:38] say they say no in sports all the time
[54:40] you know or they call it reload that's
[54:43] what they call they've got to reload the
[54:45] gun and and we're gonna fire again
[54:47] because that's that's how successful
[54:49] they are they just know they can reload
[54:51] and they've got the same result well
[54:52] that's how God's army is amen hallelujah
[54:55] brother and there's a cult brother band
[54:57] said if a man of God won't do God's will
[55:01] I'm just paraphrasing and preached in a
[55:02] certain place but a man who said God
[55:04] will raise up somebody else to do it
[55:06] amen because God's will is going to be
[55:09] accomplished hallelujah for example like
[55:12] if I want to preach here in a car and
[55:13] guess what God would raise up somebody
[55:15] else same hand and there's hungry souls
[55:17] to come and hear the Word of God God
[55:19] will raise up somebody else because God
[55:21] is gonna is plan is gonna be
[55:23] accomplished amen
[55:24] nothing can port the plan of all 90 God
[55:26] hey man now what was sad though some of
[55:30] it some of his opposition was incredibly
[55:32] hard his wife didn't want to go to India
[55:36] so what happened was she had numerous
[55:38] mental breakdowns and even went insane
[55:41] by the end of her life and the history
[55:44] without what I was reading there on the
[55:45] website said that he the friends told
[55:49] him you know send her to an institution
[55:49] you know she would just go and spell she
[55:53] lost her mind she lost her kids the
[55:54] conditions and any were so bad it just
[55:56] she wasn't ready for it and then
[55:59] suffered with diseases and like I said
[56:01] children dying she had met many mental
[56:04] breakdowns but he had to put it put up
[56:08] with that and we stayed in a loving way
[56:09] you know he we wouldn't send her away he
[56:11] kept her there at the home and and he
[56:15] dealt with that their printing presses
[56:18] burned down on numerous occasions for
[56:20] six months they wouldn't be able to
[56:21] print the gospel tracts and and print
[56:24] out the truth he translated the New
[56:27] Testament can you imagine the entire New
[56:29] Testament he translated in numerous
[56:32] languages and dialects and then he even
[56:35] translated the Old Testament
[56:37] because the people in India didn't have
[56:40] it in their language so he had a burden
[56:42] one man had a burden and the people saw
[56:45] he had a burden and they backed him up
[56:47] and supported him praise God they raised
[56:49] all the money back home in England and
[56:51] they sent it over to him to support him
[56:53] and he was there labouring laboring and
[56:55] the history said he believed he was
[56:57] there some 48 years and never took one
[56:59] furlong they said or one vacation a real
[57:03] man not there's anything wrong with
[57:04] vacation but he was fully devoted to the
[57:06] work God called him to do over there an
[57:09] Indy founded the College for a Christian
[57:11] college and then even helped write a
[57:13] dictionary end of his life to help these
[57:15] Indians to know what words meant in the
[57:19] English and this is the beautiful part
[57:21] out of all these 40 I believe 43 years
[57:24] in India at the end of his life that
[57:26] counted 700 converts to Christianity
[57:29] Amen hallelujah did God know what he was
[57:32] doing Church how many would be happy to
[57:35] get a tenth of that I'd be happy to get
[57:36] 70 souls 1 right I mean what a wonderful
[57:42] man of God the father of missionaries
[57:44] and our brother Samson Shetty told me
[57:46] that is now around us a million some
[57:48] Christians in India well this man was
[57:50] the first one to take it there hey man
[57:52] and let's see God bless those 700 sold
[57:56] and what do we got now over a million
[57:58] Christians in India see how God will
[58:01] multiply our efforts for the kingdom of
[58:02] God but we got to be willing to do our
[58:05] part no matter how small no matter how
[58:07] difficult we must be willing to do our
[58:10] part I'm willing to do my part by God's
[58:11] grace hey man I trust you are too now
[58:15] this reminded me because my Bible
[58:17] reading this morning I read a chapter in
[58:18] every morning every night my Bible
[58:20] reading this morning was 2nd Corinthians
[58:21] 11 so let's go there I just want to go
[58:23] over Paul sufferings again if you
[58:25] haven't read this in a while you'll be
[58:27] blessed Paul was
[58:33] in actually church he used the word
[58:36] boast he was trying to boast on what he
[58:39] had suffered for the kingdom of God and
[58:41] he was trying to prove to the Corinthian
[58:43] church that he was not a minister of
[58:45] Satan but he was a true man of God and
[58:47] the way he showed it was through all the
[58:50] things that he suffered for the gospel
[58:55] you and I when we suffer it's difficult
[58:57] right but we have to go through the
[58:59] suffering that proves we are who we are
[59:02] amen now you know verses 1 2 & 3 are
[59:08] very familiar with us because they deal
[59:09] with Eve and how he how she was beguiled
[59:12] from the truth and lost her virginity
[59:15] what the scripture tells us there he's
[59:18] like him do it in verse 2 now in verse 4
[59:21] Paul tells us there people are coming
[59:25] preaching another Jesus that Paul did
[59:27] not preach look at verse 5 but I suppose
[59:30] I was not a whit behind the very
[59:32] chiefest apostles and brotherman took it
[59:35] a first step further and said he was the
[59:36] greatest missionary praise God he said I
[59:41] don't believe I'm the least bit behind
[59:43] the very chiefest of apostle we say
[59:45] Peter with the keys right I was not a
[59:48] little bit behind him and brother Brahim
[59:49] said Paul was even a greater missionary
[59:51] than Peter look at verse 6 I like this
[59:55] but though I be rude in speech how many
[59:58] sometimes listen to brother branham and
[59:59] thought that's pretty rude that's hard
[1:00:01] to understand my wife and I were talked
[1:00:03] about that that might be hard for some
[1:00:04] languages to interpret some of his
[1:00:06] stories some of his words on his
[1:00:09] kentucky dialect his terminology right
[1:00:12] is vocabulary from tucky kentucky right
[1:00:15] see Paul was rude in speech he wasn't
[1:00:18] the most eloquent man right but yet not
[1:00:23] yet not in knowledge but we have been
[1:00:25] through Lee made manifest among you in
[1:00:28] all things amen even though it wasn't
[1:00:30] the smoothest talker God made manifest
[1:00:33] to you that I was a true man of God
[1:00:35] that's what he's saying
[1:00:36] look at verse 7 have I committed an
[1:00:38] offence in abasing myself that I might
[1:00:39] be exalted because I preached to you the
[1:00:42] gospel Christ reading look what he says
[1:00:43] I robbed other churches and of course he
[1:00:46] doesn't mean robbed or steal
[1:00:48] but I robbed other churches taking wages
[1:00:50] them to do you service Paul is trying to
[1:00:52] show how much he loves them
[1:00:54] he's saying I'm not a false preacher he
[1:00:57] said I took from other churches I took
[1:00:59] the offerings and I gave them to you see
[1:01:03] how we try to prove that we love each
[1:01:04] other we try to give each other things
[1:01:06] because we love each other
[1:01:08] and if you love somebody you want to
[1:01:09] help them amen especially of the
[1:01:12] household of God the Bible said the
[1:01:14] Bible said we should especially do good
[1:01:16] to those of the household of faith you
[1:01:18] should be especially good to one another
[1:01:21] here at Bride of Christ fellowship amen
[1:01:23] that's exactly right number two skip
[1:01:28] down a little bit here look at verse 10
[1:01:33] he's now verse 10 he says where he's
[1:01:34] gonna start boasting now you don't mean
[1:01:35] brag as a prideful way but he's trying
[1:01:38] to get them to see all that he has
[1:01:40] suffered to bring them the gospel
[1:01:42] look at verse 10 as the truth of Christ
[1:01:45] is in me no man shall stop me of this
[1:01:47] boasting in the readings of a ki
[1:01:49] wherefore because I love you not God
[1:01:52] knoweth but what I do that I will do
[1:01:55] that I may cut off occasion from them
[1:01:56] which desire occasion that we're and
[1:01:59] they glory they may be found even as we
[1:02:03] so see he's trying to they're trying to
[1:02:05] put a bad name on Paul but he said
[1:02:08] listen this is I'm glorying and what
[1:02:09] Christ has done in me now look at verse
[1:02:11] 13 here's the deception of Satan for
[1:02:16] such are false apostles deceitful
[1:02:20] workers transforming themselves into the
[1:02:24] apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[1:02:27] Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:02:29] angel of light therefore it is no great
[1:02:33] thing if his ministers so see Satan's
[1:02:35] preachers are also called ministers
[1:02:37] right they're servants we're going to
[1:02:39] serve one of the other I want to serve
[1:02:41] the Lord Jesus Christ Prince are
[1:02:43] actually called ministers of Satan he
[1:02:48] said as the
[1:02:49] but he said what if his ministers also
[1:02:51] be transformed as the ministers of
[1:02:53] righteousness whose end should be
[1:02:55] according to their works see they look
[1:02:57] like they're righteous they look like
[1:02:59] they're bringing the light but Paul says
[1:03:01] you'll know them by their works and
[1:03:04] Jesus said you'll know them by their
[1:03:06] fruits amen how do they have the fruit
[1:03:09] of the Spirit or is it corrupt fruit
[1:03:11] that's how you know you look at their
[1:03:12] works what is their life producing what
[1:03:14] the kind of life do they live that's how
[1:03:16] you know now I believe by God's grace
[1:03:18] I'll say like this I'm happy that I
[1:03:21] learned the gospel from a real man of
[1:03:22] God brother Brooks and brother Craig
[1:03:24] there are true men of God their works
[1:03:26] have shown that they're not interested
[1:03:28] in money women or popularity they're
[1:03:30] interested in the Word of God and I've
[1:03:33] tried to model my life exactly like them
[1:03:35] amen hallelujah look at verse 16 I say
[1:03:39] again let no man think me a fool of
[1:03:41] other wise yet as a fool received me
[1:03:44] that I may boast myself a little so look
[1:03:45] he said I'm gonna boast a little now
[1:03:48] this is not prideful understand he's not
[1:03:50] being prideful he's trying to get them
[1:03:52] to see his works amen now as we read
[1:03:55] this list think about what works you
[1:03:58] suffered you might have suffered the
[1:03:59] loss of a job for Christ you might have
[1:04:01] suffered the loss of family you might
[1:04:03] have suffered the loss of friends you
[1:04:05] might have suffered the loss of
[1:04:07] different relationships or or perks or
[1:04:09] privileges but look at how much he lost
[1:04:13] this is a real man of God amen
[1:04:17] look at this verse let's go down to
[1:04:21] verse 18 seeing that many glory after
[1:04:23] the flesh our glory also now of course
[1:04:25] they were glorifying probably money
[1:04:27] they're probably glorifying they're a
[1:04:28] number of the size of their churches or
[1:04:31] their size of their money but Paul said
[1:04:33] I'm gonna glory let me tell you what my
[1:04:35] flesh has been through for the gospel
[1:04:38] verse 19 for ye suffer fools gladly
[1:04:42] seeing yourselves are wise Oh high for
[1:04:47] ye suffer if a man bring you into
[1:04:48] bondage of a man devour you if a man
[1:04:49] take you if a man exalt himself of men
[1:04:52] smite you on the face I speak as
[1:04:54] concerning reproach as though we had
[1:04:56] been weak howbeit we're in soever Enya's
[1:05:00] boat I speak foolishly I am bold also
[1:05:02] are they Hebrews so my are the
[1:05:04] Israelites oh my are they the seed of
[1:05:06] Abraham so am I so see all these false
[1:05:09] apostles have all the same
[1:05:11] qualifications seemingly as Paul but
[1:05:14] Paul's trying to say watch their works
[1:05:16] the false apostles will corrupt your
[1:05:19] minds they'll take you from a life of
[1:05:21] righteousness and they'll they'll teach
[1:05:23] you to walk in unrighteousness they'll
[1:05:25] teach you to love sin rather than teach
[1:05:27] you to love the word that's right verse
[1:05:31] 23 are they ministers of Christ I speak
[1:05:34] as a fool I am more I hear here we go in
[1:05:38] Labor's more abundant in stripes above
[1:05:42] measure in prisons more frequent in
[1:05:47] deaths oft now we're just getting
[1:05:51] started so let's stop right there he
[1:05:53] labored more than everybody he got
[1:05:55] stripes on his back he got whipped for
[1:05:58] being a Christian he labored as a
[1:06:00] Christian and he was in prison
[1:06:01] frequently my goodness can you imagine
[1:06:06] following a preacher like that he's
[1:06:08] constantly in prison while they do it in
[1:06:09] Iran all right
[1:06:10] they do it over some of these other
[1:06:12] other countries their preachers get put
[1:06:14] in prison now look at verse 24 of the
[1:06:18] Jews five times received I forty stripes
[1:06:21] save one five times thrice was i beaten
[1:06:27] with rods once I was stoned thrice I
[1:06:31] suffered shipwreck look at this a night
[1:06:34] in a day I we've been in the deep so
[1:06:35] he's probably hanging on to a part of
[1:06:37] the ship or a piece of wood for a whole
[1:06:38] night in a day I think your arms would
[1:06:41] get tired after a while trying to stay
[1:06:44] afloat so you don't drown but yet he did
[1:06:46] that why'd he do all this for the
[1:06:48] Gospels sake to try to win souls to try
[1:06:52] to stay alive write more letters
[1:06:53] encourage the churches he's trying to
[1:06:55] show them I'm not in this for the money
[1:06:57] women in popularity I'm in this because
[1:06:59] Jesus called me to this amen in
[1:07:03] journeyings often she didn't get to stay
[1:07:05] in one place in perils of waters he had
[1:07:08] trouble in the water in perils of
[1:07:09] robbers constantly getting robbed in
[1:07:13] perils
[1:07:14] my own countrymen in perils by the
[1:07:16] heathen in perils in the city in perils
[1:07:19] in the wilderness in perils in the sea
[1:07:20] in perils among false brethren people
[1:07:24] that say their message believers but
[1:07:26] they're really not they just get you in
[1:07:28] trouble
[1:07:28] watch the people around you see if they
[1:07:30] get you blessings or see if they get you
[1:07:32] in trouble then you'll know if they're
[1:07:36] real brethren or if they're false
[1:07:37] brethren amen in weariness and
[1:07:41] painfulness in watchings often in hunger
[1:07:44] and thirst I like this in fastings often
[1:07:47] in cold and nakedness this sounds like a
[1:07:51] luxurious life does this sound like the
[1:07:53] TV preachers who have their own Jets or
[1:07:58] one of them even have his own airport he
[1:08:02] has his own Airport yeah it's the
[1:08:03] International and Airport of so-and-so
[1:08:05] and when he got in his jet an airport
[1:08:08] he took his jet out and he flew it
[1:08:09] across as his congregation clapped Oh
[1:08:13] church that's so sad this guy was the
[1:08:16] real man of God was beating all the time
[1:08:18] put in jail constant weariness constant
[1:08:23] painfulness constant hunger thirst think
[1:08:26] about the hundreds of millions of
[1:08:28] dollars that could have been used to
[1:08:29] feed the poor so to buy that jet plane
[1:08:33] think about that and actually the next
[1:08:37] jage book if you read it the next part
[1:08:39] is the false Jews they say they're Jews
[1:08:41] and they're not and brother branham goes
[1:08:43] through the spirit of Judas how it's all
[1:08:44] after the money so that's what we're at
[1:08:47] next after this one it's all after the
[1:08:50] money and brother Ram says it's going
[1:08:53] for big churches and big this and big
[1:08:55] that and all these kind of big things
[1:08:56] Paul was not that way remember at the
[1:08:59] end he said go get my one coat memory
[1:09:00] tone he told Timothy he said bring my
[1:09:03] coat with you one coat look at this
[1:09:08] verse 28 now this verse 28 is going to
[1:09:10] apply to look at our next preacher we're
[1:09:11] looking at Charles Spurgeon in a few
[1:09:13] minutes but look at verse 28 beside
[1:09:15] those things which are without that
[1:09:17] which cometh upon me daily the care of
[1:09:19] all the churches can you imagine he went
[1:09:22] through all these troubles and then he'd
[1:09:23] get a letter he get a messenger and said
[1:09:25] oh the church at Philippi needs this oh
[1:09:27] the church in Jerusalem needs this oh
[1:09:29] the church at Rome they need more food
[1:09:31] or or they need clothes or or the
[1:09:34] pastor's over at a class that got locked
[1:09:37] up in prison and all these weights and
[1:09:39] all these burdens are on his heart can
[1:09:41] you imagine now we can I guess we can
[1:09:45] relate in one way because if you're on
[1:09:47] Facebook or if you do text with people
[1:09:48] or and you get prayer requests from
[1:09:50] around the world how many how many see
[1:09:52] those you know someone will die here so
[1:09:55] someone's in jail they're like that's
[1:09:57] how it is on Facebook you get all kinds
[1:09:58] there's all kinds of Prayer and it just
[1:09:59] seems like we're overloaded right
[1:10:00] there's there's times would just seem
[1:10:02] like there's all kinds of requests
[1:10:04] that's just a simple that's a small
[1:10:06] taste of what the Apostle Paul went
[1:10:08] through and now as we'll see Charles
[1:10:10] Spurgeon East's at least I think 60
[1:10:13] churches or 60 groups he was constantly
[1:10:15] caring about every single day trying to
[1:10:18] meet their needs I think he said he got
[1:10:20] 500 letters a week can you imagine I
[1:10:22] don't even get 500 emails a week and he
[1:10:26] wasn't typing them off like on our iPads
[1:10:28] like we had today
[1:10:29] he was hand writing letters back to all
[1:10:32] these people 500 a week now Paul of
[1:10:36] course would had a greater burden a
[1:10:37] greater ministry because he was the
[1:10:39] messenger for the Aged so see upon all
[1:10:42] these physical problems robbers
[1:10:44] shipwrecks beatings print imprisonment
[1:10:46] all these things on top of all that he
[1:10:48] had to care for all the churches as well
[1:10:51] so I felt really encouraged that for
[1:10:53] this I feel like I I felt like I had a
[1:10:55] lot to think about but I really don't I
[1:10:57] don't really have much compared to this
[1:10:59] now look at verse 29 who was weak and
[1:11:01] I'm not weak so which of these preachers
[1:11:03] are saying all my life is hard Paul
[1:11:05] saying my life's hard who's offended and
[1:11:08] I burn not Paul saying I'm get offended
[1:11:12] if I must needs glory how a glory of the
[1:11:14] things which concern my infirmities my
[1:11:17] struggles see my struggles prove I'm a
[1:11:20] true man of God you know why because the
[1:11:22] spirit Antichrist hates the Spirit of
[1:11:24] Christ and the spirit of Antichrist
[1:11:27] wants to kill the real true spirit of
[1:11:29] Christ amen but what Ishmael wanted to
[1:11:32] Ishmael was mocking and making fun of
[1:11:33] Isaac and that's what Paul picks it up
[1:11:35] and says see that spirit hates the true
[1:11:38] spirit of God and so we have to go
[1:11:40] through trials and tribulations people
[1:11:41] aren't gonna like us but we've got to
[1:11:43] stay on the beaten path of the gospel
[1:11:45] amen they're not gonna like us because
[1:11:47] of what we believe and how we live look
[1:11:53] at verse 31 the God and father of our
[1:11:54] Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed for
[1:11:56] evermore knoweth that I lie not in
[1:12:00] Damascus the governor under artists the
[1:12:03] king kept the city of de Matt I'm sorry
[1:12:05] damascena with the garrison desirous to
[1:12:08] apprehend me oh my so even the king said
[1:12:12] a garrison around the city and but in
[1:12:14] verse 33 and through a window and a
[1:12:16] basket was it let down by the wall and
[1:12:17] escaped his hands a king of a city was
[1:12:21] trying to lock me in and keep me in the
[1:12:22] city but God made a way out through the
[1:12:24] window kind of reminds me about the
[1:12:26] windows of heaven are being opened amen
[1:12:28] there's a window escape window he could
[1:12:30] get out don't you know the Bible said
[1:12:32] God always gives a way of escape to the
[1:12:34] believer hey man unless it's your time
[1:12:36] to go or unless it's your time to suffer
[1:12:38] God will make a way of escape amen now
[1:12:41] let's finish up here here I'm sorry let
[1:12:44] me use this and the next quote is about
[1:12:46] this part about a college huh me know
[1:12:48] God used to be in building those
[1:12:50] colleges how many how many understand
[1:12:51] that God used to support the seminaries
[1:12:54] he used to does he do it today
[1:12:56] most likely not what I mean by that is
[1:13:00] he might allow a seminary just because
[1:13:03] the message hasn't got there
[1:13:04] yet does every understand what I'm
[1:13:06] trying to say if that's the greatest
[1:13:08] light they have that might be the only
[1:13:10] way the message of Christ can be spread
[1:13:12] in that area so God may use that today
[1:13:14] until the message of the hour comes
[1:13:16] let's look at this brother man tells us
[1:13:18] this then we find out in the next age
[1:13:20] which was the Reformers age Philadelphia
[1:13:22] God sent out the wisdom of a man a man
[1:13:25] like had on the Beast which was the
[1:13:27] power that went forth in the Reformers
[1:13:29] did you notice no matter that the people
[1:13:32] are no wonder that the people these days
[1:13:34] still living a hangover like it wasn't
[1:13:35] the Reformers age because they just seen
[1:13:38] the ecclesiastical way of looking at it
[1:13:40] they seen it in the way that the
[1:13:41] seminaries had been taught that was
[1:13:43] God's Way at one time but we've live a
[1:13:47] past that that does that help you out
[1:13:50] building a college William Carey
[1:13:53] building a cow's Charles Spurgeon having
[1:13:55] a college named after him that was God's
[1:13:57] Way at one time but we've lived a past
[1:14:00] that hey men all right now let's look at
[1:14:04] the next thought here I want to get more
[1:14:07] into this this wisdom of man and then
[1:14:11] we'll look at Charles Spurgeon here now
[1:14:13] brother man I'm close to the scripture
[1:14:15] here I believe it's revelation 3:9 now
[1:14:16] it's a little strength that has kept my
[1:14:17] word and it's not denied my name
[1:14:20] now we've already mentioned how the
[1:14:22] strength was returning it was the power
[1:14:24] of the Inquisition had waned how many
[1:14:26] matter what the Inquisition was the
[1:14:28] Roman Catholic Church would enquire
[1:14:30] people if they had any suspicions about
[1:14:33] them going against the Roman Catholic
[1:14:35] Church they could arrest you on the spot
[1:14:36] and they could take you in and ask you
[1:14:39] questions and they would torture you
[1:14:41] look it up on Wikipedia look it up in
[1:14:44] the encyclopedia they could torture you
[1:14:46] or to try to get answers out of you if
[1:14:49] they thought you said anything against
[1:14:51] the Roman Catholic harlot system that
[1:14:54] was the Inquisition it reached its
[1:14:56] height in the twelfth century so around
[1:14:58] 1100 AD
[1:14:59] so not really that long ago not read
[1:15:01] that long ago that's when it reaches
[1:15:03] height but now that was 1180 now we're
[1:15:06] at you know the 1700 right at 1800 so
[1:15:10] this is about you know 600 or 700 years
[1:15:12] later the power of the Inquisition
[1:15:15] Inquisition had waned people left their
[1:15:18] home
[1:15:18] and demanded a freedom of worship the
[1:15:21] yoke of the hierarchy was being broken
[1:15:23] the governments are finding it wise not
[1:15:25] to champion one segment against another
[1:15:27] in fact well-meaning but poorly led
[1:15:29] people were fighting were willing to
[1:15:31] wage war to defend their religious
[1:15:33] rights do you see that at one time God
[1:15:36] was behind the men and women fighting
[1:15:39] for their religious rights God was
[1:15:41] behind that just like the pilgrims right
[1:15:44] just like just like George Washington
[1:15:46] and and all these founding fathers that
[1:15:49] fought and had all these armies and wars
[1:15:52] oh my all the wars that we our country
[1:15:57] has gone through God was behind it in
[1:15:59] one way I say like this it was the
[1:16:01] permissive will of God in order to
[1:16:03] spread the gospel amen
[1:16:07] perhaps the greatest show strength of
[1:16:09] religion this age was the fact that
[1:16:11] though France found revolution the great
[1:16:13] Wesleyan revival kept the revolution
[1:16:15] away from what Great Britain and saved
[1:16:17] her to be an instrument in the hand of
[1:16:19] God for many glorious years hey man
[1:16:23] hallelujah now here's where I want to
[1:16:25] get to as Satan raised up his and
[1:16:28] listen this isn't a Philadelphia Church
[1:16:29] age Saint was raising up hordes of free
[1:16:32] thinkers well I think it's okay if we do
[1:16:34] this I think it's okay if we do that as
[1:16:37] the originators of communism rose up as
[1:16:40] liberal theologians spread their filthy
[1:16:43] wares God raised up mighty warriors of
[1:16:46] the faith now listen to this and the
[1:16:49] greatest works of Christian literature
[1:16:51] and teaching and preaching came from
[1:16:55] this era did you catch that the greatest
[1:16:58] books in Christianity came from the
[1:17:00] Philadelphia Church age praise God the
[1:17:03] greatest preaching the greatest amount
[1:17:05] of preaching took place in the
[1:17:08] Philadelphia Church age now look what he
[1:17:11] says next never has it's preachers and
[1:17:13] teachers been matched and never will
[1:17:17] they be that's pretty powerful statement
[1:17:21] isn't it because that includes brother
[1:17:23] branham's age the Laodicean Church age
[1:17:25] and that includes myself as a preacher
[1:17:27] that includes all the preachers right
[1:17:30] see this
[1:17:31] so there were so many preachers and the
[1:17:33] preaching was so so vast that it will
[1:17:37] never be matched it was so great because
[1:17:39] it was the beginning of the age of the
[1:17:41] open door now raise your hand if you
[1:17:45] heard of these anyone ever heard of the
[1:17:46] word in the name Spurgeon before no one

[1:17:54] have Barnes on my computer I read his
[1:17:56] commentaries Albert Barnes Bishop's I
[1:17:58] don't know him okay came from this area

[1:18:02] moment they preach taught and wrote the
[1:18:04] word they glorified his name what a
[1:18:07] compliment you see you see why God is

[1:18:13] God blessing literature why was God
[1:18:15] blessing colleges amen
[1:18:17] why was God blessing books and and all
[1:18:20] their preaching God was blessing it
[1:18:22] because they were obedient to the
[1:18:24] anointing of their our aim ahead
[1:18:26] hallelujah you see we've got to be
[1:18:28] obedient to the anointing of our hour
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] the flying eagle is program likens under
[1:18:34] revelation we've got to live the
[1:18:36] revelation that's been given to us and
[1:18:38] it's not to build colleges is not
[1:18:40] necessarily literature it's to manifest
[1:18:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and take
[1:18:46] the gospel to every nation and getting
[1:18:48] by preaching the gospel manifests the
[1:18:51] Living Christ so that others can receive
[1:18:54] the cry this Christ and live above the
[1:18:56] things of the world the denominational
[1:18:58] chicken yards are you with me to live
[1:19:00] above denominational chicken yards which
[1:19:02] always produce death but the high high
[1:19:05] fly above that and live in heavenly
[1:19:07] places in Christ Jesus
[1:19:09] hey man glory that's why god bless these
[1:19:12] people because they accepted it well
[1:19:14] I've got to have the man anointing I've
[1:19:16] got to be more wise I've got to do all
[1:19:18] this books and I've got to make colleges
[1:19:20] and I've got to do all this god bless
[1:19:21] them because they accepted 90 you and I
[1:19:24] must accept our anointing to you amen
[1:19:26] let's look at the prints of preachers
[1:19:28] you know they called him that they
[1:19:30] called him the Charles Spurgeon the
[1:19:32] Prince of preachers that's his nickname
[1:19:34] the Prince of preachers so he only lived
[1:19:38] 57 years so died quite young there he
[1:19:42] had numerous diseases there attend of
[1:19:44] his life
[1:19:45] but he was a pastor and author in London
[1:19:47] England and you're gonna see some of his
[1:19:50] words are like Paul's where Paul where
[1:19:54] the daily cares of the churches came
[1:19:56] upon some of these men now this
[1:20:00] gentleman right here was known for his
[1:20:01] eloquence II in other words people would
[1:20:04] listen to his ability to talk and his
[1:20:08] ability to produce the right words and
[1:20:11] his vocabulary and he was known as a
[1:20:14] very eloquent man and how many know
[1:20:15] that's okay huh me ever read about
[1:20:18] Apollo sin the Bible you read about
[1:20:20] Apollo's Polo's rich and if you read a
[1:20:23] read of Apollo same ah okay a couple
[1:20:25] people have okay let's get your Bibles
[1:20:27] there let's go let's go to read let's go
[1:20:28] to acts 19 then acts 18 X 18 now
[1:20:39] remember what did Paul say Paul said I
[1:20:41] was rude in speech so was Paul's
[1:20:44] preaching all fine and dandy and perfect
[1:20:47] no but Apollo's was the Bible calls
[1:20:53] Apollo's eloquent and I'm looking up
[1:20:56] real quick to make sure I got the right
[1:20:57] scripture yeah X 18 24 now this is what
[1:21:02] Charles Spurgeon reminded me of Apollo's
[1:21:05] who would pass through at Ephesus X 18
[1:21:11] 24 November there are some preachers
[1:21:14] that are really eloquent my like I could
[1:21:16] name a few like Dwayne Lawson Danny
[1:21:19] Reagan you know they they never say one
[1:21:21] word wrong you know I'm appear say I
[1:21:22] hope forgive me forgive me you know
[1:21:26] there's just different kinds and brother
[1:21:28] branham you know he wasn't his eloquent
[1:21:30] yes there was times he was a very
[1:21:32] eloquent sermons no doubt about that
[1:21:33] but he even admitted he said I'm not
[1:21:35] much he said I'm not very eloquent but
[1:21:39] see God has all kinds of right don't you
[1:21:41] love God's variety see acts 18 24 and a
[1:21:45] certain junior in Apollo's born in
[1:21:47] Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in
[1:21:49] the scriptures came to Ephesus
[1:21:51] this man was instructing the way of the
[1:21:53] Lord and being fervor in the spirit he
[1:21:55] spake and taught diligently the things
[1:21:56] of the Lord knowing only the baptism of
[1:21:58] if you know the story he got these
[1:22:01] people Church to a real sanctification
[1:22:03] and that's my desire for everyone in our
[1:22:06] church who's not fully sanctified I want
[1:22:08] my preaching to bring them to
[1:22:10] sanctification and then the baptism of
[1:22:12] the Holy Ghost and I don't care who God
[1:22:14] uses to do it I know as a pastor I have
[1:22:16] to feed the church most often I point
[1:22:18] them to the sheep food the Word of God
[1:22:20] history brother Rams message which is
[1:22:21] the Word of God
[1:22:23] sheep food for our day but it doesn't
[1:22:26] really matter you know what my role in
[1:22:28] it is as far as we just want to see
[1:22:30] people sanctified and we would as we see
[1:22:33] people feel what the Holy Ghost because
[1:22:35] if they get the Holy Ghost they're
[1:22:36] sealed to the day of their Redemption
[1:22:38] and they're gonna be a true witness of
[1:22:40] Jesus Christ in Akron Ohio amen
[1:22:42] and you have to worry which side are
[1:22:44] they on their life shows which side
[1:22:46] they're on amen they're not the
[1:22:48] followers that the leaders amen they're
[1:22:51] the pillars of the church amen those
[1:22:52] that are really born again they're the
[1:22:54] ones that love God and brother have said
[1:22:56] if there's only two people there
[1:22:57] there'll be one of those two that are
[1:22:59] there in church I don't know yeah there
[1:23:02] are the pillars they're the ones that
[1:23:04] you know they're making they're calling
[1:23:05] election sure praise God so see God has
[1:23:10] really eloquent men now go to first
[1:23:12] Corinthians I'm just typing up another
[1:23:13] scripture I want to show you just as a
[1:23:15] reminder yeah 1st Corinthians 3 for
[1:23:19] there you go there it is that's why I
[1:23:21] appreciate these technology here I can
[1:23:23] look up the scriptures real fast
[1:23:25] first Corinthians 3 for now the thing to
[1:23:32] do is find out which ministry God has
[1:23:35] placed you under whatever gift it is and
[1:23:37] and sit under that gift and obey the
[1:23:41] Word of God under that gift it might be
[1:23:43] a very eloquent man it might be a man
[1:23:45] who's rude in speech but the thing to do
[1:23:47] is make sure they're preaching Jesus
[1:23:48] Christ amen
[1:23:50] and they're not a minister of Satan
[1:23:52] disguised as a minister of light then
[1:23:57] that's out that's how we must look at
[1:23:59] their works by their fruits they're
[1:24:01] known are they preaching a cankered word
[1:24:03] or is the word rightly divided amen
[1:24:06] first Corinthians three look at
[1:24:12] let's just read the whole thing verse 1
[1:24:14] and I brethren could not speak on us
[1:24:16] under spiritual but as unto carnal even
[1:24:19] as babes in Christ
[1:24:20] can you imagine Paul could not teach
[1:24:22] them deep things because they were
[1:24:23] babies and you know why they were
[1:24:25] preacher lovers they loved the preachers
[1:24:27] more than they loved Christ
[1:24:29] that's when you know if someone's really
[1:24:31] immature spiritually they can praise
[1:24:33] every other preacher but not other ones
[1:24:36] but they fall in love with this preacher
[1:24:38] but they don't like the other ones see
[1:24:40] because they're worshiping a man is it a
[1:24:42] worshipping Christ that right and that
[1:24:46] shows they're just babies they're not
[1:24:49] really mature Christians because the
[1:24:50] mature Christian looks past the man and
[1:24:52] sees the word look at verse 2 I fed you
[1:24:55] with milk and not with meat for a
[1:24:57] hitherto you were not able to bear it
[1:24:58] neither yet now are you able see he knew
[1:25:00] they just couldn't handle the preaching
[1:25:02] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[1:25:05] is among you listen envying strife and
[1:25:09] divisions are ye not carnal and walk as
[1:25:12] men so because of their love for man
[1:25:16] rather than Christ they had envying
[1:25:18] somebody envied this person or they
[1:25:21] wanted that person they want to be like
[1:25:22] that person or one of that person's
[1:25:24] position or job or calling in the church
[1:25:26] or something
[1:25:26] strife divisions arguments amongst
[1:25:30] believers and Paul said I can't teach
[1:25:32] you deep things because you argue you
[1:25:34] fuss too much you send too much you're
[1:25:37] too spiritually immature I can't teach
[1:25:39] you deeper things how many want to be a
[1:25:41] church that God can teach us deeper
[1:25:42] things I want to go into deeper things I
[1:25:45] know you do too so we've got to be
[1:25:47] spiritual we got to forgive and love
[1:25:48] verse 4 for while one say if I'm
[1:25:52] appalled look and see that and this is
[1:25:54] just in their church somebody says well
[1:25:55] I'm appalled another one says I'm
[1:25:57] Apollo's and another says what's the
[1:26:02] next one
[1:26:02] sorry I lost my spot oh he said are you
[1:26:04] not carnal verse five who that is Paul
[1:26:07] who's the Polo's but ministers by whom
[1:26:09] he believed even as the Lord gave to
[1:26:13] every man see that God will give every
[1:26:16] man who wants to be saved a preacher
[1:26:18] they can sit under can you say amen to
[1:26:20] that
[1:26:20] every man God gives a preacher to every
[1:26:23] man God will send somebody to acronym
[1:26:25] God knew vague was gonna be here in his
[1:26:27] family God knew it so we had to send a
[1:26:29] preacher here just like in Lima God had
[1:26:31] to send a preacher there because all the
[1:26:33] believers are just like brother cam God
[1:26:35] had to send a preacher there in a
[1:26:36] poignant because he knew there be souls
[1:26:38] there God has given a ministry to every
[1:26:40] believer that once one yes
[1:26:43] look at verse 6 I love this I have
[1:26:46] planted Apollo's watered but God gave
[1:26:50] the increase
[1:26:51] amen let me say like this brother
[1:26:53] branham Planeta that's actually in the
[1:26:55] church age book glory that's actually in
[1:26:58] the sermon the seeds of the spoken words
[1:27:02] original seed that's actually that
[1:27:04] sermon brother Branham said there was
[1:27:05] three seeds plant in the end time he
[1:27:07] said it was the the true seed and
[1:27:08] brother barons ministry he said there
[1:27:10] was the Pentecostal scene which all
[1:27:11] Roberts planted and then he says there's
[1:27:13] the evangelical see the Billy Graham
[1:27:15] seed and now we can see what the seeds
[1:27:20] produced we can see that the Billy
[1:27:23] Graham seed produces Reverend people but
[1:27:26] all the women cut their hair and paint
[1:27:28] their faces and they all wear pants we
[1:27:31] can look at the old hobbits and what's
[1:27:32] that Bruce people that believe in a lot
[1:27:34] of speaking in tongues big universities
[1:27:36] or Roberts universities huge millions of
[1:27:40] millions of dollars but they're after
[1:27:43] money remember old Roberts sister Connie
[1:27:46] remember that when Oral Roberts I was I
[1:27:48] was just a child but he went on TV and
[1:27:50] said God told me if I don't get five
[1:27:51] million dollars to build this building
[1:27:53] he's going to kill me you remember that
[1:27:54] you can look it up it's on YouTube now
[1:27:57] Church I don't know if that was God or
[1:27:58] not but it doesn't sound like it does it
[1:28:01] sound like it like God's gonna kill me
[1:28:02] if you don't give me five million
[1:28:04] dollars that doesn't sound like Christ
[1:28:05] what did Paul just say Paul said I was
[1:28:08] constantly in prison I've constantly
[1:28:11] weak my constant didn't have food I was
[1:28:14] fasting all the time I had all these bad
[1:28:16] situations I was going through all these
[1:28:17] hardships and another man say well you
[1:28:19] know see you got to send me five million
[1:28:22] dollars that doesn't sound like God it
[1:28:24] just doesn't it just doesn't seem like
[1:28:26] I'm not saying it wasn't but it doesn't
[1:28:28] fit that cause it fit the nature of God
[1:28:30] God's humble nature you see that now
[1:28:37] look at
[1:28:37] this is why I'm saying brother brand
[1:28:38] implanted and I'm just watering what he
[1:28:40] planted can ever say man I'm showing you
[1:28:43] a breath I'm just trying to share with
[1:28:44] you why brother Branham talked I'm just
[1:28:47] trying to water the seeds that he
[1:28:48] planted as the messenger of the hour
[1:28:52] look at this
[1:28:53] I like verse 7 this keeps all of us
[1:28:55] preachers humble so then neither is he
[1:28:58] that planteth anything so brother
[1:28:59] Branham neither he that watereth any
[1:29:02] other preacher but it's God that gives
[1:29:04] the increase I'm nothing I'm just
[1:29:07] watering I'm just I'm just like a
[1:29:08] gardener out there watering right I'm
[1:29:13] just the one wanders I got I'm just I
[1:29:14] just got the hose out there when you
[1:29:16] drive by one of those places you see a
[1:29:18] guy with the hose that's just me I'm
[1:29:20] just I'm just holding the hose
[1:29:22] I'm just watering but the well even the
[1:29:25] water won't do nothing it's about that
[1:29:26] increase from the Sun amen
[1:29:28] the waters needed the plantings needed
[1:29:30] but it's all about that Sun quickening
[1:29:32] that seed amen
[1:29:34] it's God that gets all the glory amen
[1:29:36] now he that planteth and he that
[1:29:40] watereth are one so see all the
[1:29:41] preachers they all just work together
[1:29:42] what don't exalt Paul and Peter and
[1:29:44] Apollo swell my preachers better than
[1:29:47] your preacher
[1:29:47] we don't exalt men we exalt Christ he
[1:29:51] said an every man shall receive his own
[1:29:53] reward according to his own labor amen
[1:29:57] now I just was added help by God's grace
[1:30:01] see there were some really eloquent men
[1:30:03] this was the most one of the most
[1:30:05] eloquent preachers there ever was
[1:30:07] Charles Spurgeon he was a prolific
[1:30:10] author of many types of works including
[1:30:12] he wrote sermons he wrote an
[1:30:14] autobiography he wrote commentaries
[1:30:15] books on prayer devotionals magazines
[1:30:18] poetry hymns and more so he at least
[1:30:20] eight a or more kinds of writing this
[1:30:23] guy was constantly writing had to
[1:30:25] glorify Christ here look at his quotes
[1:30:28] Church look at this just a moment here I
[1:30:30] got this off a website I'm sorry it's so
[1:30:32] small don't try to read it the year he
[1:30:34] turned 40 he delivered a message to his
[1:30:36] pastors conference with one word title
[1:30:39] forward he said in every ministers life
[1:30:41] there should be traces of stern labor
[1:30:45] brethren do something do something do
[1:30:49] some
[1:30:50] well committees waste their time over
[1:30:52] resolutions is the denominations do
[1:30:54] something while societies and unions are
[1:30:57] making khuns
[1:30:58] constitutions let us win souls too often
[1:31:01] we discuss and discuss and discuss while
[1:31:03] Satan only laughs and asleep get to work
[1:31:05] and quit yourselves like men I like that
[1:31:09] so he was even trying to rebuke the
[1:31:11] pastors there he's 40 years old I'm 37
[1:31:13] he's at 40 years old he's trying to
[1:31:15] rebuke these pastors saying do something
[1:31:17] don't argue about all these types of
[1:31:19] things try to win a soul for Jesus and
[1:31:23] here's where was his motivation at the
[1:31:25] bottom
[1:31:25] he said meditate on the deep solemnity
[1:31:28] upon the fate of the lost sinner in
[1:31:31] other words think about what it would be
[1:31:32] like if someone went to hell that you
[1:31:33] knew shun all views of future punishment
[1:31:37] with or which would make it appear less
[1:31:40] terrible so anything that would say well
[1:31:42] hell's not that bad Spurgeon said shun
[1:31:45] that hell is going to be awful he said
[1:31:50] and so take the edge off your anxiety to
[1:31:52] save immortals from the quenchless faith
[1:31:54] flame think much also of the bliss of
[1:31:57] the sinner saved and the like holy
[1:32:00] Baxter dear I've rich arguments from the
[1:32:02] Saints everlasting rest there will be no
[1:32:04] fear of your being lethargic if you are
[1:32:06] continually familiar with eternal
[1:32:08] realities amen
[1:32:11] in other words you won't be a lazy
[1:32:12] Christian if all you're thinking about
[1:32:14] is getting so saved for eternity so they
[1:32:16] don't go to hell amen glory my children
[1:32:20] can they might remember this from Sunday
[1:32:21] night I was praying at Sunday nights and
[1:32:22] God it looks like Adam was praying
[1:32:24] tonight I was saying God save souls I
[1:32:26] said give us souls like brother vang and
[1:32:29] I was naming some of your names and all
[1:32:30] these saints that some come so
[1:32:32] faithfully the house of God give us
[1:32:34] souls that will love Jesus Christ with
[1:32:35] all their hearts that'll serve God here
[1:32:38] in Akron amen
[1:32:39] I was praying that at home I don't know
[1:32:40] if you remember that when I said that
[1:32:41] children on Sunday night but this is
[1:32:43] what he's saying give us Souls think
[1:32:46] about and think about this what if
[1:32:48] brother vang wasn't here what if brother
[1:32:50] Adam wasn't here what if sister Connie
[1:32:53] wasn't here and what if I wasn't here
[1:32:54] and we're still in the world can you
[1:32:56] imagine what church would be like
[1:32:57] without each one of us here we'd be we'd
[1:33:01] be missing the joy or the
[1:33:03] strength of another brother and sister
[1:33:05] in Christ we'd be missing your lick of
[1:33:07] fire amen right is that right and to see
[1:33:11] someone going to hell and the imagine
[1:33:14] that person can you imagine me out in
[1:33:15] the bar tonight
[1:33:17] you know cussing and smoking and
[1:33:19] watching the football game the bowl game
[1:33:22] tonight or whatever more and maybe
[1:33:24] divorced three times or can you imagine
[1:33:26] because some of my uncles are like that
[1:33:28] my answer like that and that might have
[1:33:31] been went through my family but now
[1:33:33] think about the grace of Jesus Christ so
[1:33:35] aren't you so glad assignment witness to
[1:33:37] me no way my soul to the message hey now
[1:33:40] you place your name in there amen
[1:33:42] it's so blessed it's a blessing thing
[1:33:45] that you're here and not out at the
[1:33:47] world thank God for that amen now help
[1:33:50] us to leave her tonight and praying and
[1:33:52] saying God help me to save her soul to
[1:33:54] get them out of the chains of Satan and
[1:33:56] bring them to the marvelous light of
[1:33:57] Christ he said this will keep you from
[1:34:00] being a lazy Christian if you think
[1:34:02] about how awful hell is and how glorious
[1:34:05] of me to have that person in the house
[1:34:07] of God and eternally say by the blood of
[1:34:09] Jesus Christ the Prince of preachers
[1:34:14] here's another quote okay now this is
[1:34:17] where just like Paul in 2nd Corinthians
[1:34:19] 11 look at this no one no one living
[1:34:22] knows the toil and care I have to bear
[1:34:25] it look what Charles Spurgeon said I
[1:34:27] have to look after the orphanage he had
[1:34:29] an orphanage I have charge of a church
[1:34:32] with 4,000 members orphanage 4,000
[1:34:37] sometimes there are marriages and
[1:34:39] burials to be undertaken he said there's
[1:34:42] a weekly sermon to be revised he too
[1:34:44] preached one sermon a week the sort of
[1:34:47] trial that was a magazine to be edited
[1:34:49] he had to edit his week or magazine I
[1:34:51] don't know how many times I went up and
[1:34:52] beside all that a week the average of
[1:34:55] 500 letters to be answered can you
[1:34:57] imagine that church orphanage 4,000
[1:35:00] people marriages burials I got a news
[1:35:04] letter and on top of all that 500
[1:35:07] letters the top of all that a wife and
[1:35:09] children and the church said amen
[1:35:13] Paul said on top of all my beatings and
[1:35:16] scourge
[1:35:16] and shipwrecks on top of all that I have
[1:35:19] all the cares of every church I've
[1:35:20] started I care so much for them I wanted
[1:35:23] what their needs to be met one I don't
[1:35:25] want them to struggle and Charles
[1:35:27] Spurgeon is saying the same thing
[1:35:29] this however is only half of my duty for
[1:35:31] there are innumerable churches
[1:35:33] established by friends with the affairs
[1:35:35] of which I'm closely a connected to say
[1:35:39] nothing of the case of difficulty which
[1:35:40] are constantly being referred to me to
[1:35:43] see them some of these preachers or
[1:35:45] deacons couldn't figure it out let's
[1:35:46] take it the pastor Spurgeon and he
[1:35:49] wasn't complaining he's just saying no
[1:35:51] one knows the toil no one knows the bird
[1:35:54] and I go through may God help us to be
[1:35:56] content with the burden that we have
[1:35:59] because I can't relate to this I went
[1:36:01] one day I was getting so overwhelmed I
[1:36:03] said honey look at look at this I've
[1:36:05] wrote 15 emails today and I was feeling
[1:36:08] overwhelmed and this guy 500 letters per
[1:36:12] week so if you do and that was a big day
[1:36:15] so if I did 15 emails times 7 you can do
[1:36:17] I can't do the math right now anybody
[1:36:19] got that I'll just run up 20 to 7 there
[1:36:22] you go there's 140 the most I have in a
[1:36:24] week is 140 maximum right and here he's
[1:36:28] got 500 letters in a week I look at this
[1:36:33] on his 50th birthday 66 organizations
[1:36:36] was read that he founded and conducted
[1:36:40] so he at least went to 66 other churches
[1:36:42] organizations Lord Shaftesbury
[1:36:46] was there and said this is a list I'm
[1:36:48] sorry this list of associations
[1:36:50] instituted by his genius and
[1:36:51] superintendent by his care were more
[1:36:53] than enough to occupy the minds and
[1:36:55] hearts of 50 ordinary men 4000 members
[1:37:00] 66 organizations can you imagine the
[1:37:03] head church now look at this David
[1:37:05] Livingstone asked them how do you manage
[1:37:06] to do two men's work in a single day
[1:37:08] look at his answer you've forgotten
[1:37:11] there's two of us
[1:37:13] flower amen hallelujah so sisters like
[1:37:18] for my wife or sisters with children how
[1:37:20] can you handle this number of children
[1:37:22] how can you handle this hockey number
[1:37:23] that I said you forgot there's two
[1:37:25] people raising these children
[1:37:28] there's two people pastoring this church
[1:37:29] or there's two people are running our
[1:37:32] home it's not just me he said it's me
[1:37:34] and Christ
[1:37:35] it's Christ and me the hope of glory so
[1:37:43] we don't feel so bad anymore doing about
[1:37:44] how busy our lives are our lives can't
[1:37:47] even compare to these lives and this was
[1:37:50] a member of the greatest age of
[1:37:52] preachers the greatest age of literature
[1:37:53] the greatest age of Christian missionary
[1:37:55] work and he died at 5757
[1:38:01] remember brother Bosworth member he
[1:38:02] didn't even start his ministry his real
[1:38:04] ministry till 75 did you remember that
[1:38:06] he went to programs meeting he's already
[1:38:08] retired pastor he's like I've just
[1:38:10] enjoyed just just gonna enjoy life he
[1:38:12] saw that discernment of brother Branham
[1:38:14] and he hopped on board and preached
[1:38:15] though he was 84 I think nine more years
[1:38:17] in ministry and he said those last nine
[1:38:19] years were greater than all the other
[1:38:21] years combined because why the prophet
[1:38:24] of God was there he saw the gift of God
[1:38:26] he saw that star the star for his age
[1:38:29] amen
[1:38:29] he saw the candlestick for his age
[1:38:31] burning the light of Christ and a man
[1:38:33] named William Branham he saw that and
[1:38:35] those nine years with mother Branham
[1:38:37] were greater than all the other ones
[1:38:38] combined by now Church why do we go
[1:38:41] through this because Paul arms are Peter
[1:38:43] wrote beloved I write unto you to which
[1:38:46] I both stir up your pure Minds by way of
[1:38:49] remembrance I want you to remember what
[1:38:52] Paul went through I want you to remember
[1:38:54] what William Carey went through and I
[1:38:56] want to remember what Charles Spurgeon
[1:38:58] went through and if we can remember what
[1:39:01] they went through
[1:39:02] how many would leave here encouraged and
[1:39:04] say wow they had a lot more to deal with
[1:39:06] than I did they're busier than I am I
[1:39:08] can take courage and I can serve Christ
[1:39:10] with more courage I won't be discouraged
[1:39:14] I won't complain I won't cause strife
[1:39:17] and divisions I'll be thankful with a
[1:39:19] lot God has given me and Lord just
[1:39:21] helped me to be more faithful with it
[1:39:23] Eamon I got five minutes here let me oh
[1:39:25] I'm not gonna be able to this here I was
[1:39:31] gonna read through a couple more pages
[1:39:32] let's just go to this one here let's
[1:39:33] close this let's go to revelation 3:11
[1:39:35] I'm gonna close to this I think I get to
[1:39:36] this in five minutes Oh
[1:39:40] tonight by God's grace it really
[1:39:42] encouraged me as I was reading through
[1:39:43] this praying to this this morning I
[1:39:44] thought my God he really gave me this at
[1:39:47] a very appropriate time when I feel
[1:39:49] overwhelmed or I feel like I got a lot
[1:39:50] on my plate
[1:39:51] I look at this and I don't have nothing
[1:39:53] on my plate I just got to be faithful
[1:39:56] with what God has given to me that's
[1:39:58] very little compared to what other men
[1:39:59] have gone through revelation 3:11 behold
[1:40:12] I come quickly hold that fast which thou
[1:40:15] has that no man take thy crown so right
[1:40:20] around now takes this thought on hold
[1:40:22] fast hold fast on what you have I'm
[1:40:26] grateful for what you have spiritually
[1:40:29] the Bible says you have all spiritual
[1:40:31] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[1:40:32] Jesus all those blessings I'm very
[1:40:35] grateful for the blessings I have amen
[1:40:38] now I just got three quotes here we
[1:40:40] don't need to comment on the thought
[1:40:42] that he is coming quickly so we don't
[1:40:44] need to say much about that we know that
[1:40:46] he's come he is because we are in the
[1:40:49] end of the last days aren't we but he
[1:40:51] goes on to say hold fast that what you
[1:40:52] have that no man take your crown it is
[1:40:59] in the myths of a time of great trouble
[1:41:01] that Jesus comes and with his coming
[1:41:05] there's a resurrection many are to come
[1:41:07] forth out of the dust and rise with
[1:41:09] those who are alive but waiting for his
[1:41:11] return and these will be given crowns
[1:41:14] why because they are sons of God they
[1:41:18] are kings
[1:41:20] with him they are reigning with him that
[1:41:24] is what the crown signifies reigning and
[1:41:27] ruling with the great king himself that
[1:41:29] is the promise to all those who suffer
[1:41:32] with him here on earth all those who
[1:41:36] endure patiently knowing that God the
[1:41:38] just judge would reward them they who
[1:41:41] gave up all for him and committed all to
[1:41:45] him will sit down in his throne and
[1:41:48] share in his glorious Kingdom doesn't
[1:41:51] that stir your heart how many
[1:41:53] our enduring patiently waiting for the
[1:41:56] coming of Lord sometimes aren't we're
[1:41:58] tempted to go back out or we're tempted
[1:42:01] to do things we we know we shouldn't do
[1:42:03] but we choose to endure patiently
[1:42:06] waiting a con upon the coming of the
[1:42:08] Lord Amen Church we have we given up all
[1:42:13] for him that's what it says here to be a
[1:42:16] real king we have to give up everything
[1:42:18] for Jesus you know a lot of times people
[1:42:21] as we said people aren't willing to give
[1:42:22] up family members they're not willing to
[1:42:24] give up jobs or they're not willing to
[1:42:26] give up associations or friends they're
[1:42:28] not willing to give up beliefs they're
[1:42:31] not wanting to give up how they were
[1:42:32] raised
[1:42:33] but a Christian is when they give up
[1:42:34] everything for Jesus and not only give
[1:42:38] it up but give it to him amen sometimes
[1:42:42] we can walk away from our past but it
[1:42:43] never gets under the blood it's got to
[1:42:46] get under blood in other words say
[1:42:47] father I forgive that person or father
[1:42:49] forgive me see we got to give that to
[1:42:52] him and say God forgive me help me to
[1:42:55] forgive them we have to commit we have
[1:42:58] to leave everything for him and then
[1:42:59] have to commit everything in his hands
[1:43:02] that's beautiful last quote you can
[1:43:05] stand every feet let's stand here I'll
[1:43:07] make sure we finish oh I know look this
