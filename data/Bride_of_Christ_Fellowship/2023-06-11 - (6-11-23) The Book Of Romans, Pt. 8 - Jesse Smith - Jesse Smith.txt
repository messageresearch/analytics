========================================
hey lady it's good to be in the house of Lord you see all the saints today God bless you everyone of you let's go to Romans chapter 4. to start at verse 11 again going to continue on this series I got some good feedback from Wednesday so I'm really glad that saints were blessed I was blessed too the word of God always makes us blessed Hallelujah that's where I find all my blessings is in the word of God hallelujah worshiping Jesus singing to Jesus being around God's people praise God praise the Lord let's go to Romans chapter 4 verse 11. we saw about Simon yesterday he wants to thank everybody for the prayers you know it's feeling a lot better by God's grace you think of him remember him in prayer you know surgery there so Romans chapter 4 verse 11 and 12. we'll read this again but on Wednesday I'll do a little more Lord winning on Abraham today than try to move beyond that but it kind of depends on if you're pulling on Abraham now like Wednesday night you know Brother Ray had a good testimony he said he was having all these struggles just getting to church and he said every time that happens God many times will move in a great way so he was so rejoicing you heard him testify like after service everybody was so patient he just he was so moved by the word he's like he just told me like six testimonies he said let's pray for these people that they can find Christ and pray for him and different he was just so stirred up by the word of God because it's a revelation as Abraham walked by faith we do the same so we're so thankful for God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah Abraham is the father in other words he's the example we look at his life and that's how we live as well praise God we'll choose to follow God we'll choose to give God praise we'll choose to walk in the past of obedience praise God Romans 4 11 and 12. okay so I'll read verse 11 and then we'll all read verse 12. verse 11 says and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also let's read verse 12 ready one two three and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only pardon me but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised amen let's have one more word of prayer you have a need on your heart Let's Make a known it to God father God we thank you for your amazing grace Amazing Love Jesus we sing for all that you've done for us you're so worthy of all of our praise all of our worship Lord God we just want to walk in the steps of Our Father Abraham you gave his life as an example Lord God of how we can walk

Christ's name whatever he said amen God bless you praise God I do have some uh slides to show here by the grace of Lord we're thankful again for all God's uh love and compassion to us and I also want to say you know last Sunday we had Brother Kyle visit right and he was saying afterwards I'll just share what Austin told me you know he was sharing afterwards he had never been or rarely been to a service where there was so much clapping and singing and shouting the shout he said he he just wanted to Scream and Shout or something didn't he say that but Austin I just I just want to encourage you you know like I as we worship we create an atmosphere and that's what people want to be a part of you know I got to talk to him afterwards and he was like Wow and then he told Austin like everything things were so different there people were so inviting people were so loving and even said about you know as me as a minister he's like wow the pastor was so welcoming and loving he said he said the deacons and so forth that his Catholic Church don't even want to take his hand Harley they got Mass on and you know so just just know that you know you're making a difference on people and your life speaks louder than any words you can say the love of Jesus Christ that we show and we try to show by God's grace to all people it speaks very loudly so hopefully he'll come back and but I oh he's on his way okay well Glory I hope he comes um but you know that meant a lot to me when Austin told me that and uh you know I just we just I love how we just treat everybody like their family you know that's what we got to keep doing just keep treating everybody like their family loving them and praying by God's grace and I just I just thought it was so beautiful you know I had those two sermons to preach and when Austin Austin came rushing in and during the song service I thought well this is strange you know I'm glad you did because when he when he told me Kyle was coming I wanted to preach a message that he could understand and it really was you know and then I saved you know the other Souls that were in prison you know for the evening I just just wonderful then to hear him to hear how he was impacted by something simple like that I knew Austin was led to the Lord and you were all led the Lord to sing and greet him and clap the way you did you know it's just really wonderful you know made me feel happy you know to see how God's love shines God's love is just you can't deny it praise God it's like it's like the difference between night and day praise God right God's love shines like like like the sunlight or he's gone so just want to encourage everybody to keep showing the love of Jesus Christ praise God so I want to just I want to briefly go over the scripture here I added some new notes we started with this one the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only so Abraham is our father even though we're not Jews the Jews are known for circumcision of the males on the eighth day they circumcise all male boys and and that circumcision was is what God told them to do and that entitles them to the benefits of the Covenant but now in the New Testament Paul says Abraham's Our Father even though we're not Jews and the Bible said who we also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised so Abraham had Faith before we saw I showed you on Wednesday nine years before he got the the command to circumcise he already had Faith before that and he was already a child of God before that he was already righteous he was already called of God he was already God's friend amen hallelujah he was already see the fact that God was already talking to him proved he was already the friend of God Amen and so when you can look at our your life and my life and when we when we can first see oh that's when God started talking to me that was proof you were already a child of God Amen because that's what the Bible says he was already talking to you he's already dealing with you amen hallelujah thank God and but then as you go on God he continues to be your father and he continues to guide you deeper into relationship with him in other words you get to know your father better Hallelujah hallelujah amen Thank God now so let's consider what faith was in Abraham's life what was it Faith was simply believing God's promise right in other words Abraham just had to believe God's revelation to him as long as he believed what God spoke to him he was walking by faith right Abraham didn't have to guess what God wanted him to do that's when he got in trouble when he tried to make it come to pass right when he tried to figure out he and Sarah tried to figure out what God wanted them to do when they tried to figure it out that's when they got in trouble but they didn't have to do that what they had to do was just patiently wait we saw in Hebrews chapter 6 right a Wednesday night the Bible said he just had to patiently endure right and then that would that would bring the promise to pass amen same thing is true for us we have to obey what God is currently revealed to us and not try to add to it or take away from it just obey it praise God and not try to make God's promise come to pass or something of our own ability we and what I mean by that is oh make it come to pass by sinning because that's what Abraham and Sarah did right they sinned right they they should not have taken another uh they should not have married Hagar right Abraham should not have done that that was a sin right it should not have happened now the Customs allowed it but really like Jesus said Jesus said you should have gone back to the beginning one man one woman right and Abraham should have known that he knew the story of Adam and Eve right and it should not have happened because look what it produced It produced Ishmael seed and a wild man and produced a group of rebels to the word of God they've now created their own God right Allah and it's gone the wrong direction and so Abraham's our father and when we walk in faith we walk in what God has revealed to us we walk in the promises of the Bible praise God all right now I want to just briefly go over this again here I'm going to flip back to this in a moment I show this and I know it's really blurry I know uh so I don't expect you to read it but it's just a visual for me because I want to read it uh but I just want to review each item and look at each move of Abraham wasn't by faith or was it not okay so the first time he's 75 years old and God tells him to separate from his family so he did but he took a long lot which he should not have done Now it worked out for Lots good right looked out worked out for Abraham's good too right the Bible said all things work together for good to them to love the Lord right Even in our mistakes the good of it is that we learn what not to do praise God and then we can Pat you know if time goes on like brothers said then we can leave footprints in the sands of time and say you know well Malachi Lydia here's where your dad and mom obeyed or here's where Dad made a mistake don't do what Dad did right here right uh you know I can look at some of the mistakes from my Early Childhood or my early adulthood I could say Malachi don't do this you're a man don't do this maybe I'll do that when I'm preaching here soon I can say Lydia don't do like Daddy did right here you know that's that's where I made a big mistake I filed the wrong crowd there I should have stayed with the word of God you know uh and and so Abraham here he partially obeys I put a red dot there he partially obeyed so the red means a mistake he partially obeyed but he didn't fully obey and I think if we're honest you know all of us would say when we get saved we obey some but we don't obey everything so that we all start like that right in other words I'll say like this when we first got saved we didn't get saved and then get the Holy Ghost on the same day right you gotta you got to get Justified you gotta and then you gotta get Sanctified praise God so I think it's a beautiful uh it's a beautiful representation of what we go through Hallelujah and so there he's walking by faith so was he walking by faith yes okay and then he got a covenant you know he got the Covenant uh then he journeyed up to Canaan that was all by faith he was walking by faith all right but the next step was because the drought like we're going through now right right of course not as half as bad because of the drought he left where God told him to go so at that time he wasn't walking by he wasn't walking in faith but I want to ask you what was was God was God upset with what was God upset with him was God done with him did God want him to throw him away and get him a new person to work with no Abraham was still his chosen you're still his chosen amen you might leave the he left where God told him to be God said be there he left and went down to Egypt he was in complete Disobedience but God never left him praise God God even had to have Pharaoh have accept Abraham's prayer praise God Abraham lied to pharaoh and then God still stood on Abraham's side you know I just finished job yesterday and the same thing happened in job spoke some things against God God comes out and rebukes job right God said you made yourself righteous more than me and then job said I repent and Dustin ashes I uttered things I didn't understand I've heard with my ears but now I see so God rebukes job and then a few verses later God tells the three friends job said what was right but it wasn't all right right it wasn't all right it also shows how quick God is to forgive it's his true servants amen and then God makes them you know sacrifice and have job pray for them to forgive them of their mistakes in other words they wouldn't be forgiven unless they humble themselves to God's servant job well in each case is pharaoh and Joe's three friends had to recognize who was the one walking in the real walk of faith and God honored them because they were really walking in faith Church let's be like Abraham let's be like job let's obey God with all of our heart soul mind and strength let's be the friend of God hallelujah we do that by obeying God's word hallelujah we are by the grace of God it's the same story there God always takes the side of the person who's going to believe him the most yes we still have failures but God's looking and he's watching seeing which group is actually believing more of my promises and that's a group I stand beside amen hallelujah all right just like with Abraham Allah who is God really with Abraham or lot he was really with Abraham a lot was saved but the one he was dealing with the most was Abraham and lot just benefited from the the benefits of being around Abraham so it is with us right we we should we should live close to God we should be the ones serving God loving God and then people should notice wow I'm blessed just being around you praise God that's right that's true amen hallelujah that's true praise God thank the Lord so was he walking by faith well not really because he disobeyed but then he got on back on the right track right and he left Egypt and went up to Bethel then he got right back on the right track and then that's where God then uh communed with him and shortly after that He restored a lot and he met Melchizedek look at this he just disobeyed God and then he meets God that ought to encourage us even if we make a mistake say God forgive me I wouldn't experience something with you today praise God Lord I made a mistake there's Brother Kyle God bless you sir hallelujah amen good to see you Hallelujah so God so he failed God but God didn't give up on Abraham Hallelujah God visits him and then God even though he failed God says well now I'm going to use you as a warrior and you're going to go save your brother from his his addictions I'll say like that amen Hallelujah yeah you failed me God said to Abraham but now I'm going to use you you're going to go restore your brother in his vaccinating condition restore him back to the faith that's exactly what Abraham did and then God met Abraham and then Abraham had Community with God Amen oh so see how God God always restores our relationship with him we're the ones who fail we're the ones who make mistakes God is quick to forgive and then he's quick to bring us back into his will and then use us to bless other people amen he doesn't throw us away and says that's the 10th time you fail me I'm done with you no God said I forgive you now I want to use you again praise God amen he doesn't Throw the Clay Away Hallelujah he's the Potter amen thank God he just puts us back on the wheel and molds us and shapes us and uses us amen he gives us a fresh start praise God that's what God did to Abraham that's what God will do with Abraham's children praise God amen Hallelujah I notice then God God called a separation Abraham was a much stronger believer than lot and so God had to separate them at some point and and God allowed the situations well I need to separate this person they're a good believer but they're they don't want to live as high as I want to live and so Abraham had to separate himself and I love Abraham's Christian Behavior he gave lie he said a lot we got to separate now you get the first choice isn't that isn't that a Christian thing to do that's called preferring your brother above yourself you get the First Choice lock whatever way you go I'll go the other way because we don't have enough room here there's not enough room here for all of our resources we don't have enough room for all these cattle and all these sheep and oxen and everything we got to separate ways and sure sometimes you'll see that in your life you'll have a close friend but God will have to separate you from that person because they're not truly wanting to live more of God's word like you want to live amen Hallelujah God did it with Abraham God has to do it with us the Bible said we walk in the steps of faithful Abraham praise God think of how many people down through the years we've had good friends and they'll be our friends for a while but then they choose a more worldly path so lot said well he looked out and he said I want to go to that rich City but it was full of homosexuals and the first the Bible said he said by Abraham and then he was plant he was he he put his tents in the in the wilderness but then he he he he left there and he moved closer and then the next time we see him he's one of the judges in the gates and and the Bible said he went there because he saw their Gardens he saw all their finances he saw all the prosperity but where did Prosperity get his family it got us most of his family lost and he forgot about brother said he forgot about Abraham and Sarah and their promise seed why was that important because that promise seed he'll go Isaac Jacob and it would produce the holy nation it would produce the holy Tabernacle It produced the Ark of the Covenant pretty soon It produced a Moses pretty soon in producing Joshua amen hallelujah pretty soon to producer David Hallelujah and the Solomon and lot was saying well I can't wait around for that promise I want to go have Prosperity now Church the real Prosperity is obeying God's word amen we can't we can't make decisions based upon what we see we got a base conditions and decisions upon what God's word says so although lot was richer maybe maybe and had more Prosperity as it seemed in a well-gardened area Abraham was was closer to God because he was out here in the wilderness he lived a life separate unto God he had 300 servants he sent the servants out you go watch the Sheep you got the goats you take the cattle and Sarah and I are going to stay here and we will manage everything but they didn't no it was it was busy can you imagine 300 servants I only have 21 kids in my class it's hard to remember it's hard to think of 300 300 servants how do I do this but still although it was busy and crazy and 300 people around here it was better than living with homosexuals and I'm not I'm not I'm not condemning them God will judge them we warned them and we asked God that that God would reveal himself to them so they can and we try to warn them to come out but church we got a choice we can either live closer to the world or we can live a life that's separated unto God Amen amen oh and he lived away from those worldly things he lived away from the city he lived out in a place where he and God could have Fellowship praise God I want you to notice the Bible never said God smoked a lot down there in Sodom God only spoke to the man Abraham who was separated unto God Amen he chose I'm not going to live those they're Sinners I'm not going to live amongst that but what I'm going to do is I'm going to live out here where my and the Bible said he trained his family and his servants to obey the word of God hallelujah let's read that Genesis 18. I want you to get that you know people always say Abraham was a man of Faith man of Faith that's true but what was it about his faith that was so important it was important because he obeyed and then he trained others to obey that's why coming to church and reading your Bible and worshiping God is so incredibly important learning to obey right and it's okay to make mistakes God's not looking at your mistakes he's looking at the finished product Hallelujah doesn't focus on yes Abraham is going to pay for his mistakes he was going to deal with the consequences but God was looking at I'm producing something a great sea lion is coming through you you're the star of something great and Church of God dairies Our Lives will be the start of something great praise God which the great thing is a family or relatives or people that come after us people that we've Inspire to serve Jesus Christ so the gospel can keep going it's got to go to Every Nation it's got to go to Every Nation gets a chance to hear and we're doing our part right here in Akron amen but the great thing is passing on the blessing of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen Genesis 18 Hallelujah ah 1817. remember church God never went down there to Sodom God never went he only sent his angels down there because it was such a wicked thing God wouldn't even go down there now the Lord is talking to Abraham in verse 17 and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do which was destroying Sodom and Gomorrah seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him so what kind of man was Abraham he was a man that kept the word of God he's a man and now it's time children I'm going to teach you the word of God now it's time to read our Bibles it's time to sing praise to God today Hallelujah it's time to obey the scriptures it's time to remember God today in other words do like I've done get to know God hear God's voice obey God's word let's be not let's not be distracted by money and riches like love and we will pray for him and we'll rescue him like Abraham did we'll help him when he's down and discouraged we'll help him but let's live a different life let's live holy unto God hallelujah because God's worthy of that now go in your Bible says II Peter chapter two now let's see what the Bible said about lot this is a fresh I mean it's a good scripture but it's kind of fresh thought to me like this second Peter chapter two now it's verse verse six yeah so picture you got one group living in the city over here lot who's a Believer he was saved but then you have Abraham over here who was saved a Believer but he through him God was going to do greater things than Lots because he kept the word of God so Abraham's out here having Bible studies yeah Abraham's teaching all the service let's have Bible studies but law in the city is just trying to survive because of all the wickedness he's around yes Abraham's busy he's busy and sometimes he's like in I'm in over my head over all these jobs and animals and servants but we're still going to focus on the word of God I'm not going to be moved away from that I'm not going to be tempted to go anywhere else I know God's calling me and I'm going to keep his word praise God hallelujah and that's what we must walk in his steps praise God amen but look what look what lot went through verse six and turning the cities of sodomor into ashes condemn them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly so God made an example of Sodom and Gomorrah because of the the men were sodomites right they were homosexual men God made them an example by destroying them with a sulfur uh right and burning ashes and sulfur fire Brimstone that's where it is there and that's an example of what God is going to do okay God's gonna do it again in this time we don't know when but but that's what the Bible said God's going to destroy he's going to pour out the the seven Trumpets the seven vows and the three woes Upon A group of people that after Jesus has saved his bride he's race snatched away his bride taking him to the the wedding reception then yes God has to pour out wrath upon all those who rejected the truth just like Sodom and Gomorrah verse 7 and he delivered just lot Vex with a filthy conversation of the wicked so God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah but before that he saved three people three in a city of thousands only three people could be saved now did God let them burn no God save them praise God because God is gracious but look what the Bible look what the Bible said he was vexed lot lived a vexed life yet he was a Christian Vex means torment now church only you know how much torment you go through each day I don't know how much torment you go to but if you're having my battles and going through torment all the time and you're under torment and life just seems hard and struggles then you're probably more like a lot rather than Abraham you might be saved you might be a believer but lot was he had to Bow the torment every day was torment he's trying to live a believer's life he's trying to be a believer but every day was torment where Abraham's over in here yeah it's busy there's a lot going on but we get to know the word of God over here praise God Abraham didn't have to look out and see men assaulting one another I'll just say it like that men in the streets assaulting one another sexually Abraham didn't have to see that out there in the fields he got to see the animals out there hallelujah praise God he got to see all the the animals and and he got to see his the pastures praise God the food growing and The Vineyards and all these things he got to see he's a wealthy man but he wasn't vexed lot was vexed and tormented every day Church there's something to be said to have a life of Peace in 2023. there's something to be said there's something valuable in having peace in your heart when you lay your head down at night praise God lot did not have that oh peace is such a valuable thing praise God and you can't pay money for it you got to pay and sacrifice amen the Bible says buy the truth and sell it not and that means this that means rejecting the wrong and accepting the right praise God Hallelujah so like a lot choosing he chose to live there that was his choice praise God he didn't have to do that he chose to live with the worldly things Abraham didn't Abraham chose different he said I'll go to a place where I can train my family where I can keep the word of God where I can hear the voice of God lot wasn't hearing the voice of God never visited a lot in there a lot only got saved right at the end by grace the angels I don't know if you read that Brother Kyle lately the Angels literally had to pull him out they had to grab him by the he just wanted to stay and of course he had loved ones there and really didn't want to leave but he he so was he was so connected to the world and riches and money and family all there and yet he wanted to stay he wanted to stay living a Vex life church let me just say like this you know we don't have to stay where we are there's a way out amen there's a way out of a tormented life there's a way out of what you if you feel trapped you don't have to feel trapped forever you don't have to feel tormented forever come out like Abraham amen separate yourself from family friends and riches and whatever you're saying get away from the torment of life and come out here and live a peaceful life with Abraham praise God amen Hallelujah I did that years ago I'll tell Kyle and uh for Kyle and and Chris amen Hallelujah thank God amen hallelujah so when I was 19 I just got saved but I was around a lot of guys that they went to church but they'd also drink Coronas and then also watch filthy movies and I knew that was wrong and I had to make a choice and they were trying to tell me oh you can be a pastor and you can do this and I had to make a choice I I believe they were Believers but I was living in torment so I had my Abraham moment right am I going to continue and say uh yeah be more popular I have more friends I had more likes on Facebook I would have had more of that but it would have been constant torment so I thank God I made my choice praise God Amen I had to forsake all my friends and they think I'm crazy to this day that's fine I think they're crazy for staying inside of that's what I think but I had to make my way come out with God's despised view to live a life of peace to obey the word of God to learn to to to handle the word of God and know God and because of that we can hear God's voice amen amen Glory and that all happened there he had finally a deception so he lived with uh we'd say he lived with weaker Believers but then he had to separate himself Hallelujah he rested a lot as well and then after he rescues lot then he gets a covenant by sacrifice let's go let's go to that let's go to I'm sorry yeah same second Peter we never read verse eight that's what I want to read verse 8. verse 8 sorry II Peter 2 verse 8. church it's all about if you want to live a life of Peace it's all about what you see and what you hear if you say brother Jefferson I really would like to have peace in my life okay well then be careful what you're seeing and be careful what you're hearing amen look at verse 8. because the Bible said he was Vex and verse 8 why would this righteous man be tormented why would God let a man be tormented well the thing is God didn't want him to be but lot wanted to be tormented he wanted to live there God will let you have your choice God the Bible the Bible says God loved him so much he pulled him out of there with angels in other words lot wanted to live in that kind of Lifestyle yet he was tormented by it see that's why people will continue into their evil addictions because they still love it but they gotta hate it and then they gotta repent of it and then they gotta come out of it praise God if they want peace if they want to walk with God if they want to walk in faith they've got to come out of it praise God amen verse eight for that righteous man dwelling among them he's dwelling with homosexual men that would with Mobs of men that will go around and ravish people that's what he was living among in seeing and hearing Vex is righteous so from day to day with their unlawful Deeds so he was trying to live a life of Peace but then he'd see things and be like Oh I'm tormented then he'd hear things imagine the cries that he would hear these men would go after other men that and so seeing that oh then hearing that that's what he chose to live in but at any time he could have went out and said Abraham surely there's a couple acres out here right here sure there's just give me two acres you know Abraham bro I had hundreds of Acres right surely you know we can separate a little a little bit further than yeah I'm kind of close to you but he chose to live in that he kept seeing the sodomy he kept hearing the side of me and he never left it God wants us to leave that praise God you have the choice you need to be like LA or Abraham let's be Abraham and Sarah amen stop looking at those things and stop listening those things and you'll be a real abrahamic believer praise God that's all I gotta do don't put yourself around it praise God that's what lot did he put himself around it so that's what caused the torment he saw it and heard it all the time we got must be very careful what we see in here that will produce either a atmosphere of Torment or an atmosphere of peace and the church said Glory Hallelujah okay now go to Genesis 15. even today we must choose every day to have an atmosphere of peace Genesis 15. I just want to go down again and just review this real quick I mentioned it on Wednesday now let's go to verse 8 Genesis 15. let's just read this is a small portion of scripture I feel led to do this and he said Lord God wherewith I'm sorry whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it now God I just told him you know your seed's going to be as a number of stars you're going to have all these uh descendants all these things and he said God how do I know verse 9 and he said to him take me and heifer of three years old and a shego of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon five sacrifices and he took them unto all I'm sorry and took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another and the birds divided he not so he takes five animals he cuts them down the middle right which represents a covenant right when you make a covenant something's got to die something's right there has to be a sacrifice to make a promise I'm promising on the life of this that this animal is going to die I'm promising to keep my part of the bargain so he he cuts God tells him cut five animals in half right the next verse so death had to happen blood had to be shed for him to know that God was going to be with him blood had to be shed and thank God the blood of Jesus Christ was shed for us amen amen amen we don't need any other sacrifice there's one sacrifice once and for all Hallelujah the blood of Jesus now he didn't divide the birds because that represented uh Birds rep usually represent the Holy Spirit if they're good clean Birds verse 11. and when the files came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away now brother Brandon says these other files represent uh as a type represent evil spirits and so when we make a sacrifice to God evil spirits are going to come down and attack us to try to get us distracted away from the Covenant God made with us so what do you have to do shoe those lies away say Satan get behind me get out of here praise God kind of like we had to shoot those Lambs away out of the graduation party yesterday they kept coming in they were sweet Lambs but they keep wanting to eat all Lydia's food and everything like that and we got to keep shooting them away well Abraham had to do that Satan get away from these sacrifices These Are Holy sacrifices in other words Satan get away from my holy life I'm trying to obey God here I'm trying to hear God's voice Satan get away I rebuke you in Jesus Christ's name amen that's what Abraham had to do he had to shoot all the birds away from the sacrifice that God had told him to do we got to shoot away all these unclean spirits the Bible said the false church is a cage of unclean and hateful Birds right so uh a false church is like a cage where there's all kinds of meat birds and evil birds in there and so what do you gotta do you gotta get the birds out amen gotta cast The Devils out amen I cast these lies out I cast this lust out I cast this greed out I cast this Pride out in Jesus Christ's name amen get it on Abraham amen hallelujah praise God oh thank God verse 12 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo and of great Darkness fell upon him so God puts him to sleep after the sacrifice are made the blood's been shed and the birds are drove away God puts him to sleep and in this great of Darkness falls upon him and he said unto Abraham and Abraham's sleeping no of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger land that is not theirs that was score speaking of when Israel went down into Egypt and they were slaves for 440 years and Shall Serve them and they shall flick them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards they shall come out with a great substance and thou shalt go thy wave I'm sorry go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in the good old age amen what a blessing to know that well the end of my life is going to be in peace what a confirmation God gave to Abraham Hallelujah the god in other words God's going to take care of my future and when I die it's gonna be I'm gonna die in peace praise God all right the main thing is peace with God hallelujah that's the best thing peace of God you have a question brother Chris yeah yeah and then each time he visits him he visits him again each time he gives him more and more Revelation about his life but at this point he tells him your end will be peace and then he tells them what's going to happen to his descendants they're going to be so many but they're going to go down to Egypt they got to be slaves he said but I'm going to bring them out with the mighty hand so imagine that they had to either write these down or they had to pass these prophecies onto their children remember remember Grandpa Abraham said we're we're going to go down to be safe but God's going to bring us out remember the prophet said it amen the word of God said it God's word says it the vision says it and for us it's the Bible said it praise God if the Bible said it I believe it praise God it's God's promise to Abraham seed Hallelujah God will protect us amen Before Destruction comes God will rescue his church he'll rap you his church off the Earth we don't go through the wrath of God we're not ordained the Wrath we're ordained a Salvation Hallelujah hey man Glory look at verse 16 but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for iniquity the amorites is not yet full in other words God had to let these people in the Promised Land do more and more sin so that now God was fair and just in pouring out his wrath upon them imagine that God gave them 400 more years to repent but they failed to repent and after those 400 years God said now I'm going to destroy you by Joshua that's what he did except for the giving Grace Hallelujah now look America's coming up on 250 right coming up on 250. now we know that America will never repent as a whole but we can have little revivals in the midst of America why because I'm one of them my life has been revived amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so we don't know how long God will be merciful to America but we can we can be the abrahamites praise God we can be Abraham's seed right here in America praise God we can be the righteous ones that's right now he says verse 17 I mean it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces okay now I want to go actually uh go back up to verse 12 that great of Darkness uh brother Ram said uh that was God letting Abraham know about the of death and Hell right he's letting Abraham know he puts him to sleep he says this is the horrors of death he said but then but now if we look there in verse 17. a smoking furnace a burning lamp passed between those pieces what was that smoking and burning left that was the Holy Spirit that was the pillar of Fire and the Bible said it has to pass between those pieces because that was God saying Abraham I'm I made a covenant with you and I'm coming between these pieces that means I'm approving of this Covenant and I'm going to keep my end of the Covenant praise God I'm coming in the midst of this Covenant you know like two brothers will shake hands and we'll agree right we'll agree okay that's a covenant you're sure you're gonna do that okay I'll do I'll do my part too okay so we passed between and we make a covenant like this well God come down and pass between the sacrifice Abraham's lying there and God said I'm you you made the sacrifice I've received your sacrifice amen I've received it I'm passing through here in other words I'm going to remember all these sacrifices I remember your life I'm going to remember you because I always keep my Covenant praise God I always keep my promises amen you obey me you kept the sacrifice I'm passing here to to show you I'm passing through showing you I'll keep my end of the bargain amen because we know man we know no man can keep his end of the bargain right with God I'm talking about which one of us can obey every word of God and we'll never do it you'll hardly make it through a day with if you make it through a day praise God but you're going to mess up the next day right or pretty soon thereafter God said see Abraham you have nothing to do with this amen praise God I'm doing something I'm raising up a sea lion I'm raising up a people and eventually out of that sea lion after after David and Solomon and all these men finally come God's son Jesus Christ amen he starts to come in with the with the Jews that will receive them and then the Gentiles praise God which is US amen hallelujah remember this was a covenant to Abraham and all of his seed so God passes between these pieces and said this is my Covenant I agree with this Covenant I'm keeping this Covenant verse 18. in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land now they weren't going to possess it for 400 more years now none of us would like to wait 400 years for a promise why because we're going to die but this is what God was telling Abraham and he it was his job to pass this down Abraham just he said go out and look at look from coast to coast from east to west your land your seat is going to possess all this and it took 400 years but then they started possessing it right and then what was it uh was it 200 more years later David finally got those Outer Banks of the territory and David finally possessed all the pieces of the promised land that God had given sometimes the promises of God go slowly church right sometimes but we always want to see the Promise right now give me the promise now sometimes the God's clock moves kind of slow we want to speed up and Lord I want all these problems I want all these Blessings Now and God said you got to wait on my time Hallelujah the Divine time lose lose a lot slower than what we want in other words we might not see the Rapture in our life but we can go if we have to go down to the Grave we'll say with our last breath we'll say surely Jesus come quickly Lord Jesus Hallelujah with our last breath amen just like John Wesley's last breath what was his last last breath he said he said but the best part of his is god with is with us he died saying thank God God is with us now why can't we live and say God Is With Us amen we should be able to live and say thank God that God is with us praise God amen if he died like that we ought to live like that praise God amen thank God see they want the land they weren't going to possess it for 400 years but God's promise can never fail they inherited the land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates and you can look it up it's in second chronicles where David actually possesses all the way to the river Euphrates he finally possesses that all these hundreds of years later and then he names those Seven Nations that they defeat okay so I want you to see that Covenant this proves when when God makes a covenant the man has nothing to do with it in other words God just chose that man by grace and God is going to help that man obey all the promises hallelujah amen hallelujah God in other words God had a special chosen person and God was going to help Abraham and Sarah believe they didn't believe all the time as the timeline says right now look church right after this right after this Mighty visitation Abraham lets his wife talking into marrying another woman Hagar Abraham's move by the vision oh God told me my seeds like this he said it hasn't happened yet and Sarah's like well maybe it's through my handmade maybe that's how it's going to come okay Sarah I'll take another woman of course his flesh probably like that but God didn't like it right think about that and now did God give up on Abraham God's not going to give up on you either praise God that's the encouragement we can get out here because the Bible said we walk in the steps of Father Abraham praise God amen now that was an awful mistake right just like we make awful mistakes I'm going to emphasize that just as much I make awful mistakes but yet God doesn't leave me I fail God right we fall short but God stays with us he keeps pointing us he keeps having visitations to us amen where he lets us know he's still with us praise God he's going to bring his promise to pass and then the next chapter God says you got to circumcise all the males ishmael's born he's getting he says you got to circumcise all the mess and then remember 17 let's read 17-17 Genesis 17 17. now one reason Abraham laughed was because God had not yet God didn't tell him at the beginning that it was going to come through Sarah now the right thing to do is just wait on God not try to make God's word come to pass but just wait on God obey God my brother I said live a humble Christian Life don't make yourself odd to be a Christian don't make yourself some strange and Supernatural Christian that as sees all these visions and dreams which you might you know or how you hear all these voices all the time and but then they don't turn out to be true now that's nobody here but that's what some people do in other churches try to make themselves so mystical and I'm a minor Prophet I'm the great one that's the rise a bunch of nonsense but man should just live a humble life like Abraham praise God and obey the word of God train yourself train your family your friends train yourselves to obey God's word hallelujah live a separated life under Christ you know Genesis 17 17. now here's where God tells Abraham it's going to come through Sarah actually let's let's uh read 15 and God said to Abraham ask for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name and I'll bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that's a hundred years old and shall God that is 90 years old bear I'm sorry is there Sarah that is 90 years old bear notice he didn't he said this in his heart he didn't say it out loud like God how is Sarah gonna bear he just said it in his heart but he's laughing he falls down now church we know God has a sense of humor but this was not a joke by God this was not a sense of humor moment like when Jesus said go tell her that fox that today I preach and tomorrow I'll keep preaching you know he called Herod a fox that was a god sense of humor because that's what he was a Sly old Fox right he listened to John the Baptist but then he let his he let his second wife and the daughter dance sexy dances he's a Sly Fox sometimes he obeyed John the Baptist sometimes he was in the sensual things of the world God help us to be holy praise God that's a fox right so God has a sense of humor there in Jesus but this is not God trying to make Abraham laugh this is God trying to raise Abraham's faith didn't remember Church Abraham's laughter could not stop the promise of God hallelujah Abraham's unbelief could not stop God's word from coming to pass your belief my unbelief any of our unbelief will not stop God's promise Hallelujah in other words God will push aside your laughter God will push aside and say I'm moving on anyway you just got to follow praise God your life and doesn't change me you're laughing doesn't move me in fact I knew You're gonna laugh praise God he knew he was going to laugh but look he just had these experiences he makes a mistake and then God tries to encourage him he gets a covenant and then he laughs at God again he laughs I should say again he laughed at God for the first time my goodness and so Abraham is not this model of total Perfection he never made a mistake he was a holy uh perfect Christian all the time like we'd say he had his failures Church he had his mistakes he partially obey God he completely ran away from God's will for his life that'd be today like somebody running away from our church right or somebody moving away from our church right or somebody who has a good church and they totally leave complete they try to get as far away from it that's the one Abraham did but Abraham was still a child of God and God still brought him back hallelujah amen that's how we know he's a child of God God brings you back Hallelujah you can't stay away too long so God said sir you come on back praise God [Music] that's amen all of us they're so vain God's gonna say come on back now it's time to come back in fact I'm going to make the situation so bad you've got to come back I'm gonna let your like Abraham I'm gonna let your lies catch up to you or you don't want to be around those kings that want your wives anymore or your wife I like to leave this guy he's after my wife all the time I'm gonna leave him I'm gonna go back to where I'm supposed to be may God make us so uncomfortable in our mistakes that it drives us to obedience praise God amen now and then I want to I gotta slide on this I just want to show this one maybe I'll let me skip ahead I want to go to where the Lord appears to him in just a moment so let's now so far what what have we learned each time Abraham moved by faith it was an act of obedience right so in other words if someone says I'm going to take a step of Faith what they're saying what they should be saying is I'm going to obey exactly what God Said taking a step of faith is not hoping it happens like just jumping off a cliff I hope somebody catches me That's what Satan tried to do with Jesus see he didn't do it because God didn't tell him to do it praise God Amen a step of faith is a step of obedience is what I'm trying to say Amen in other words Abraham was a man of Faith which means Abraham obeyed God and that's what the Bible said by faith Abraham was called out and he went to a place he'd never been to receive her inheritance he obeyed so Faith obeys the word of God hallelujah and he went out not knowing he didn't know all the details but he still obeyed all that God showed him and that's what we do we obey all the details in God's word that we know that's why we read it every day that's why we say I'm going to go back and hear more preaching because there's more details I got to obey Hallelujah so it's not a step ahead well I hope God will do this I hope God I mean that's okay to have those but that's not faith faith is I obey what God told me to do Hallelujah so we see each move of Abraham every time he moved by faith it was the act of obedience praise God I just want to make that clear I've covered that over the years but I want to cover that now these are a different type of subject but I want to read these because I'm reading through the whole book for if they which are other law be heirs faith is made void so if keeping a list of rules uh if keeping enlisted rules is the right step then there's no there's no need of faith right remember faith is just trust confidence in God so if your Works uh can bring God's promise to pass them we don't need to trust God you can trust in yourself in other words it's the great argument saying it's a great idea that we cannot work and earn salvation we've got to believe God and when we believe we obey God and the promise made of none effects so if we can work it up and earn it then we don't need God's promises we can save ourselves but we know we can't do that because the law Works Wrath right for where no law is there's no transgression now there's a verse here I want to get to where the Bible said God wink to ignorance and it's in Acts 17 29 where there's no law there's no transgression so if you drive down the street and there's no sign there that says you know 45 miles per hour which I got to pay attention to more sadly but if there's no law if there's no sign there then they can't throw you in jail or they can't give you a ticket right because there's no sign there there's no law there but if there is a sign there then they can give you a ticket which I know about for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is like a gold or silver or stone Graven by art or man's device there's no piece of art this is we know this is not God it's just a picture that represents God but there's no gold or stone or there's no statue that that God is actually containing that statue and the Bible said the times of this ignorance God winked at got winked at it but now he commands everywhere all men everywhere to repent because he's appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained Christ whereof he hath given Assurance unto all men in that he raised him from the dead oh my the one who's going to judge the world is the one who raised from the dead praise God only one man has done that Christ I want you to notice this wink at ignorance it doesn't mean God overlooked their idolatry like God was okay it's okay for you to worship statues that's not what it means because the Bible says all those that that don't have the Jewish law are a law unto themselves because God has written right and wrong in every heart and we already preach on that that's in Romans 2. in other words whether you have a Bible or not you're still accountable on the day of judgment because God put right and wrong inside your hearts okay so this means this meaning of God winked at it winked at ignorance means less severe punishment because they had a lack of knowledge so all these Gentiles without Moses's law they did idolatry and things like that let's say they went to hell well their punishment will be less severe than the Jews that had idols and went to hell because the Jews knew better right and God just winked at it God overlooked and said well they didn't have it but they still knew it was wrong like any man knows any man knows a wooden statue won't talk back to you like a totem pole will never talk back to you any man that's honest and goes up there the totem pole would never talk back it's just it's a it's a any man knows that praise God any man knows that but the Bible said here in the Bible Jesus tells us here the servant that knew the Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes in other words the more preaching you hear if you disobey it the greater your punishment is but the more preaching you hear that you obey it the greater your reward is amen praise God Amen but he that knew not those that didn't know so much of the Bible and did things worthy of Stripes shall be beaten with few stripes For unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask them more so we so God has given us much understanding of the Bible but we've got more responsibility now you've got to obey it come on Abraham we've got to obey we got to stay separated from Sodom and Gomorrah you gotta gotta be train yourself up in the word of God hallelujah train yourself up don't live in torment live in peace Hallelujah don't live in torment live in Victory amen don't live in torment living happiness and joy praise God ah thank God like my testimony Kyle and Chris I didn't get saved until I was 19. so for 19 well some of those years I don't remember but for let's say 12 of those years eight and thirteen those years I was living in torment because I was running from God I was trying to drown it out with dirty magazines and dirty movies and on Sports and that it's only pleasurable for a little season sin is only pleasure over a season but I was living in torment until I finally repented and when I raised my hands and cried I felt like all the way to the world fell off me and I drove back to Akron I was on cloud nine I took down all my swimsuit pictures I took I threw away all my Snoop Dogg and Metallica said I'm a brand new creation I'm a brand new man amen where's that Bible praise God somebody give me that Bible amen you know they gave me a Bible as a graduation president I never opened it until I got saved now I'm so glad they gave it to me I started highlighting that up on the first night I got back I remember Sunday night I started reading I think I started in Matthew I think I started Matthew Hallelujah amen it became real it became a life of Peace a victory yeah I got trials but they don't last forever praise God trials don't last troubles don't last always that song says troubles don't last always amen now see when God Winks at ignorance it just means less severe punishment because they lack the knowledge because they but they could have cried out for more knowledge the Bible said all those that not shall shall have it open all those who ask shall receive all those who seek after it shall find it that's what the Bible says everybody has a desire to know God therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure which is stable fast or firm to all the seed how many want to Sure promise I want a sure problem I want a stable promise that that God is going to save me and this is not to that only witches of the law but to that also which is the the faith of Abraham who is the father of us let's say the word all can we oh a double l oh the promises of Abraham is to all of you today praise God it's to every one of us praise God the same promises Abraham had are our promises to God will bless you Hallelujah he'll bless your seed he'll be with you he'll forgive you he'll give you eternal life all the blessings of Abraham are to you praise God amen so see This Promise of blessing and not just not just uh not not just future blessing but blessings now these blessings of the Bible said Abraham's he would bless everybody on this earth now now we know God makes some poor some rich but God promised to bless us to some degree naturally now if we obey the word of God This Promise of future blessings and present is through faith which is a gift so to get the promise you got to receive God's gift let me just pretend here now I've given Lydia a phone before so this isn't too far from the truth I say honey this is your first phone it's a gift from me to you right now how did she receive that the promises through faith which is a gift that's Faith hold that up that's Faith remember say faith right Faith that's a gift and now this promise that was a gift showing that she's going to receive whatever later on you know you're gonna once I die you're gonna have all my all my hops honey you get all my house you get all my land all three quarters of an acre you get all of it yeah that's what God's saying I'm giving you the gift of faith so that's proof you get all the blessings later praise God Amen it's a gift right I've given you two phones right I've never asked for it back have I it's a gift of Grace get the grace and This Promise is firm that's a firm promise that's a firm testimony that I'm going to keep my promise amen the fact that you have faith the fact that you have trust in God that's the evidence you get the promise amen this is the evidence she's going to get my inheritance or however we do it let me get it if the Lord Terry is still that long that's the that's the evidence and this is firm this is sure God don't break his promises amen not a man that he's alive praise God God is a supernatural eternal spirit that keeps every promise Hallelujah amen he's not moved by emotions he's not moved by the world he's not moved by politics he's moved by one thing that's his pleasure Hallelujah oh Glory and Abraham's your spiritual father so we call it and remember Jesus said we call no man on this Earth father now that's different than saying Daddy or something like that speaking of spiritual leaders the Bible says Jesus said call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven so never call me Father Jesse because I'm not your daddy now my children can call me Daddy but Jesus had called no man on the earth father now here's why Paul's uh with the Bible I don't have the verse but the Bible says later um the Bible says in job don't give men flattering titles because it leads to their downfall right that's why we don't give like oh your Holy Father Jesse I ain't holy except Jesus inside of me praise God my body ain't holy my mind ain't always holy the only thing holy is the holy spirit inside me praise God so I'm not holy all the time right like I only got the holy spirit in here praise God that's what the Bible said don't call no man father Jesse nice to see you today don't bow down to me I'm nothing I need to bow down before God hallelujah he said I write not these things to shame you Paul says but as my beloved Sons I warn you so it's a warning for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ so there's lots of preachers out there right you have not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I've begotten you through the gospel so the person who first won you to Christ they're like a spiritual father to you right as long as you like the preacher or whoever it is whoever one whichever preacher you first heard and you stay under their teaching they're like a spiritual father to you okay so for me the spiritual father for me was the chapel brother that's why I got saved in the chapel those preachers were like my spiritual fathers I'm thankful for them but then I come to this greater Revelation uh the Bible calls it the restoration of all things and acts we come to this restoration Ministry and now brother Brooks is like my spiritual father he's out in Iowa he was a he's the one that told me about Christ but got me to Christ I'll take that back down but now God doesn't do that though just so you know God doesn't give out gifts and give them back Hallelujah so so see we acknowledge the men as fathers well this was this man was a spiritual father to me but we avoid calling them Father because the Bible said flattering titles yeah let me look it up here get your Bibles let's go to the Book of Job I'll show you that in job I just read that a few uh days ago that's why I always want you to call me uh just call me brother because I'm your brother it's job 32 yeah there's job 32. job 32 uh 30 21 22. the Bible said let me I pray or let me not I pray you accept any man's person neither let me give flattering titles unto men for I know not to give flowering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away now that means from his presence right because people can live all all types of years on the earth and we have all kinds of titles holy Reverend Dr Divine whatever father Divine whatever they want to call them but that means God's presence will leave that person when they start flattering themselves see that's why we shouldn't flatter anybody we should tell people the truth and this is right in the Bible right this is Romans let's write in the Bible so just so you know now I do like when people call me like Pastor sometimes that face makes me feel good but if that becomes a stumbling zone I'll let you know praise God or you might know too if my life goes off the word of God but I'd like to be called your brother we should all call one other brothers praise God now go to verse 17 as is written I made thee a father of many and I'm almost ready to close here give me 15 more minutes here give myself a physical reminder I may be a father of many nations Abraham before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and called those things which not be as though they were amen Abraham believed God and Abraham quickened the deadness of Sarah's womb Sarah's womb was dead it wasn't produced in any eggs right sorry to get so graphic sometimes but Abraham's loins were not producing seed anymore they were dead that's why Abraham labs how could God how could I have pleasure with Sarah that's what Sarah said how can I pleasure with my Lord God you really told a good one right there wow you're quite quite funny Lord God's like I ain't joking I don't tell lies I don't tell jokes like that but God had to make their deadness alive again and Abraham I'll show you the point at some point Abraham started calling those things that were not as though they were in other words Abraham got to a spot where he said my loins are alive even though they were he was still 99 year old Abraham hey Abraham you're supposed to be the father of Nations where's all your seed bless God I'm going to have it pretty soon by God's grace I don't see any uh I don't see any children they have other than Ishmael Sarah's not going to have any kids well bless God she's going to because God said so praise God God's Gonna Change My Body he's going to take away my deadness and he's going to put life inside of me that's what the Bible said oh I got this cook in my back but thank God I'm gonna get a brand new body someday hallelujah thank God my eyes are blurry but one day I'm going to see a promised son come right through Sarah amen oh oh he started calling those things that were not as though they were and people thought it was an insane man but sometimes the promises of God make you look insane praise God because the unbelievers can't believe God's promise but to you God's promise is true God's promise is real and so you can call those things that are not as though they already are praise God amen amen hallelujah trusting in the will of God hallelujah he called them as though they were even though they weren't so like it would have been like when Austin was gone you know the girls would have said Austin's coming back Austin's coming back that's probably what they were doing you know Austin's coming if it was God's will which it was or someone's sick and you say that person is going to be made well Jose is going to be well right Jose's heart condition is going to be well right really yeah is that what happened this year Hallelujah we called those things that were not as though they were hallelujah amen but it's got to be first revealed by God it can't be hope it's got to be faith now now I've said this before there's nothing wrong with hoping someone's going to get better you hope all you want but you wait until God reveals it by faith then you know for sure like with that dog right we're hoping the dog gets better it's a small thing to us it might be a great thing to this person we're hoping it but if a word if a word from God a revelation would come now you've got faith in that that dog's gonna be well or whatever it may be that's what I'm saying it's so okay to help it's okay to hope hope hope but it's different when you got faith praise God because that's I know what God wants me to do I know what God's will is now here's what Abraham did who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations now look he was going against hope all the hopes was gone in other words brother Brandon says oh the hopes are gone but he still believed God Can Make Me a father of many nations amen I have no reason to hope the only source of hope I have is God's word amen church we all take encouragement from that if nothing else speaks of any positive for us and we find something positive in the Bible let's believe the Bible praise God believed against hope there was no hopes so he had hope even though nothing told him to Hope according to that which is spoken so shy so it was based upon God's word so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith so now we know what weak faith is weak faith is hearing God's word and not believing it not calling it as though it is Abraham considered not his own body now dead where he was about 100 years old neither the deadness of Sarah's womb so again his loins weren't where they were dead no more no more production of seed right and she had no more production of eggs no ovaries weren't producing anything but Abraham didn't even consider that because he had experience with God Amen even after he left God even after he lied you might have lied you might have left God you might do all these things the thing is come back to God Amen come back to God hear God's voice again Hallelujah God will speak to you again got to encourage you God will make sure he keeps his promise to you praise God amen we make all these promises and sometimes break them but when God makes a promise he ain't breaking not on one of them amen glory praise God and he'll be with us even if we break a promise or make a make a mistake he'll be with us praise God now brother Adam says he reads this and brothers says the brother man was a prophet who died in 1965 just you know by the cow he's a mighty man of God a wonderful servant of God maybe I should have left him too high but he was a prophet of God true prophet of God and he reads us he says who against hope he said against hope all hopes is gone oh every time I get it feeling a little can I say it depressed here's the chapter I turn to Romans chapter 4. so church when you when you know you're getting depressed or you know you're getting discouraged you need a knockout punch for the devil remember I preached that sermon knockout punches so when brother Brown was getting depressed he said I need to knock out Satan where do I go where am I going to get my my strength I'm going to get it from Romans chapter 4. Hey brother I'm gonna start reading saying oh he said against hope he believed in Hope Oh I should hope I may be a father of Nations he called those things that were not as though they were God said so who again so believed in Hope Hallelujah so anytime we're blue we need to find a God said so promise that's Satan's job to trick us deceive us to try to get us to go down into Sodom but it's God's job to help us get out of there praise God it's God's job to give us knockout punches to knock the devil stop talking to me Satan get behind me praise God Amen give him a couple Jabs or right cross an uppercut knock him out so he's not bothering you so you're bothering him praise God amen praise God in other words you're testifying about God's word you're telling people about Jesus you're giving God glory praise God even if you don't feel like it brother Austin Hallelujah like I like you do you do a good job you have you'll have uh migraines and you'll just keep giving God glory you'll ask for prayer even when having a migraine now that's real good faith right there do you have a migraine today bye anyway okay well we're gonna pray for you at the end buddy yeah that's your seat of Abraham brother amen thank God so brother when I'm depressed I go to Romans 4 that will encourage me to overcome my depression so from church he battled a critical spirit he's critical of other people they're always he's always nitpicking at others any battle depression he battled fear alone he's like he's like every time the devil the devil come and say you have no friends nobody loves you and then he say he'll go out in the parking lot remember that and he'll look at the license plates of the people that came to hear him preach they'd be from Alabama Georgia and he lived in Indiana so he's sick that in the devil's face the devil you told me nobody loves me people will drive from other states just to come hear me preach so devil you're a liar here's a knockout punch Hallelujah Jesus Loves Me his people love me I got friends that care about me amen I believe God's promise I'm a child of Abraham praise God don't let the devil lie to us we got to knock him out with the word of God we've got to overcome our depression overcome our anxiety our fears Hallelujah and we do that by the word of God amen now be not weak in faith you consider not his own body now dead even though it was dead now think about that as a man amen things weren't working I'm just going to say like that nothing was working and he said it's going to work someday this testosterone is going to kick in again someday it's not working right now but it's going to kick in it hasn't worked for years but it's coming back that's Faith amen why because God said so amen God said you and Sarah will have a son and you'll call him what you did when I first came to you you'll call him laughter Isaac because you laughed at me to remind you never laugh at the promise of God hallelujah amen [Applause] church at 99 years old he laughed and church think about this but Austin within one year God was going to do the mightiest miracle in Abraham's life he was one year away from that promise and he still didn't believe it he was less than a year away can you imagine that think about that church which miracles do we want to see are just right around the corner which ones are just one year away oh if we could look into the future I wish I wish YouTube had a feature where I could scroll into the future what's future sermons and what testimonies are going to happen I'd like to check ahead in advance I'll come back and prophesy of course I wouldn't be right so I'd like to know what is God going to do in a year what will happen next year of 2024 what's going to happen what what works is Gaga knew we're one year away but one year away he was laughing saying oh Sarah and I right this is going to work like our body's gonna work again right right and God had to come and say no you are going to have it by Sarah God had to strengthen his faith and he did it within one year church we might be one year away from something great we've had great testimonies we have great wonderful testimonies God has done great things but there's more God might be visiting us and it might be one just one year away how did Sarah how did Sarah go from deadness her ovaries weren't working she's like oh how can I pleasure with my my husband Abraham Abraham I'm 90 years how did she go from that to being a beautiful young woman that abimelech wanted to marry and he said wow Abraham your 90 year old wife she's beautiful I'm taking her I'm sorry your 90 year old sister I'm gonna take her she wasn't as hunched over 90 year old woman hi Abraham remember to follow you I'm Abraham's sister God had already started changing this beautiful woman um I could walk like an old woman I really can't walk like a beautiful woman I'll get my wife up here see but how did Sarah do it Church how'd she do it same way Abraham did it praise God God sent his strength amen God gave him a visitation God sent Faith to them God sent revelation God sent his power to them amen same thing for you and I we walk in the same step when God's Gonna fulfill his word he'll Supply the power amen oh Hallelujah through faith also Sarah herself what'd you do receive strength so she was serving God at some point God just started sending she's like I'm receiving the blessing I'm receiving the word of God I'm calling those things not as though they were my body's going to transform I'm going to get a body change brother Jose I'm going to walk right into my body change I'm gonna have a brand new body and his time as the days went on that year there she kept getting stronger and healthier and younger praise God Amen Hallelujah she's received strength from God God would would send his spirit and she'd see the transformations she looked in the mirror or the looking glasses well there's a lot less white hair today and look at that my back's straightened out a little bit I got a little bit I'm not all hunched over I'm a little bit straighter today Abraham it's happening he's like that's right honey you keep speaking it hallelujah it's going to come to pass amen I noticed today I was uh uh I don't need anybody walking stick anymore and I can walk without my walking stick I'm say I'm coming in the promise of God God sending his restraint and I'm receiving it praise God so they looked or said to both they had to receive both spiritual and physical strength to conceive they needed both in the spiritual Promises of God they've got to call those things that are that uh that they're not as though they were and they had to receive strength for their physical body now if they can believe for their body to be made young we can believe for our bodies to be healed no matter the sickness that's right no matter the condition right no matter no matter whatever the dysfunction is let's ask God say God send me your strength because if you send your strength things will start changing praise God Hallelujah the Bible said they both receive the strength as Romans 4 19 Abraham's body was dead he didn't have the testosterone to be a man right and reproduce you had to receive that strength so let's ask God for strength to believe his promises Hallelujah Lord I need strength to do what I need Lord I need strength to fulfill what promise what do you want me to do Lord give me strength and I'll do it despite my failures despite the times I Stumble if I could stumble here without hurting myself actually I could stumble Abraham stumbled many times but he kept getting up all righteous man falls seven times but the Lord lifts him up praise God he stumbled many a time he stumbled along life's journey and take Hagar he'd stumble and laugh at God God couldn't do that for me God never gave up on him God kept encouraging him and God would say I'm sending my strength receive my strength today another visitation I'm going to keep visiting you until you believe that's what God's gonna do for us he's going to keep visiting us so we believe praise God almost done that's my 15 minutes right there so let me finish I just want to get through these last few scriptures yeah these last I'll just this will be my last slide okay and then the Bible said Romans 4 20. he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief now I just showed you all the Staggering but the Bible records as no staggering that's because God forgets all sins how can he stagger with Hagar how can he stagger with Egyptian king how can he stagger with abimelech and the Bible said he don't stagger because God forgives all sins the Bible said he washes them away with his blood the Bible said he separates them as far as the East is from the West the Bible says he throws our sins in the sea of forgetfulness and they speak all the way down to the bottom you never see him again God looks at Abraham's life and said he didn't stagger but he laughed we just right where he laughed but the Bible said that laughter wasn't a it wasn't a stumbling Stone your mistakes will not stop you from reaching your destination praise God your mistakes will not be a staggering point where okay I give up I'm going back to the world now your mistakes will never do that your state your mistakes will be learning examples amen your mistakes will be stepping stones praise God to higher faith more trust in God and strength to receive God's word hallelujah now look at this church I'm closing with this God this means god quickly forgave Abraham's unbelief even when he laughed at him Austin Abraham and Sarah both laughed and lied in the face of God Sarah lied in the face of God Abraham laughed in his face and yet God forgave them and said they never staggered they never fell short oh that's what I want God to say about me now okay he never staggered at the promise of God he kept believing for healing for miracles for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he saw it sometimes amen hallelujah Revival Services amen or wherever or at the altar right here we saw it at the altar amen now look at this when he was 99 he didn't believe but at some point during this 99th year he received the faith to believe notice Genesis 18 12 God visits Abraham and Sarah and tells him again I'm going to read that in verse 10 God said I will certainly return to you according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and the Bible never said Abraham left now what does this prove to you the more experiences you have with God the more you're going to believe in him the longer you serve God the more you're going to trust him you might have laughed and disbelieved last year but not this year because you're getting stronger and God is visiting you more you see more of God's love God's helping you to believe amen Glory this time Abram Abraham left last chapter but this time sister who he's not laughing anymore he's saying amen glory to God Amen the Bible said he was strong in faith giving God the glory praise God oh at the beginning of the year he was laughing now here we're at the end of the year and he's saying glory to God it's going to happen praise God only Sarah laughed Abraham wasn't laughing anymore because God was helping him be stronger in his faith his visitations from God Abraham's experiences were persuading him and that's what we need to pray for more visitations from god let's stand to our feet we're going to pray for that today and also what else we're going to pray for amen we can do that Hallelujah the Bible says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem amen that's exactly right that's exactly right wasn't there something I said we're going to pray for though Austin's migraine yeah that's right that's right yes let's worship here and then when we feel that the Lord we'll call him up and we'll just join together in prayer by God's grace Hallelujah Saints you are the children of Abraham and I showed you today we just showed you in the scripture This Promise is to all who believe Harmony believe in Jesus Christ today these promises to Abraham are to you to you to your children to their children Hallelujah to every believer these promises are true so let's pray for a visitation from God I had something else on there for prayer what did I let's pray yes strength to receive the promise of God let's pray for visitations let's pray for strength because God took two people that had impossibility of doing what God wanted them to do and God gave them the strength to do it God made it possible because With God all things shall be possible Hallelujah let's bow our heads here let's pray for strength and let's pray for our visitation Holy Spirit heavenly father I just want to humble myself going all glory to the Risen Christ today we have hope because Jesus Christ has raised from the dead amen one day you'll judge this whole world by one man who judges World by Christ Lord we believe
