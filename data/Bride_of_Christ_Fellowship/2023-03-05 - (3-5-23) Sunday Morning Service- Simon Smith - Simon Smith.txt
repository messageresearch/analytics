TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Christ even at the cross he had to go to the Cross to save that very last one that was ordained for that Resurrection we would take just place just what days afterwards but he had to get that one on the cross and if the Lord Jesus Christ ordained all those things and he saw all those things and what he would have to go through and and that last final one I kept thinking about that last final one I mean his heart was not satisfied until that thief on the right was crying out for salvation and asked him to be there on that day so we see the Lord is Mindful and he will go the distance he will go to the farthest reaches of the earth and the world the greatest pain to save that last one and now he has he's not here in a Corporal body but he's here in our body a lot of us well why did I have to go through this in my life and and there's things we're going to be going through here shortly that's going to display some of those same same things you know I mean our brothers and sisters for the last two thousand years around the world have suffered tremendously so we expect we wonder what's coming our way so okay let's just have a reading of the word here we'll get into this by God's grace and to a study here this is just was kind of was that for the home there for the campus preaching my pastor there and then just these thoughts just came started coming to my mind and uh we're gonna see how that goes and let me see here my little guy is that sorry okay so here we go we're gonna dive into this by God's grace always be it trust us be a blessing Genesis 45 let's read that verse 1. so this is one of the few times I actually had something fresh here that I did not teach at home and so I might meet Emma sister Emmy happy that maybe she didn't hear this one yet or maybe something uh newer so that's this 45 verse 1. let's read that Joseph could not re refrain himself before all them and stood by them and he cried because every cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard wow he was that the burden the releasing of all that pain and and like you're missing a family member and uh like someone who passed on you know and you long to see them again and hear now uh in all of the Joseph's Mighty never thought he would maybe see his brothers again ever and his dad and then finding out his dad's still alive and all the hope and all the excitement and all the joy for a restoration if you will and notice how he cried out verse 3 and Joseph said unto his Brethren he says I am Joseph but they only knew him they'd only met him through what Zephaniah he was given what a new name and they didn't know him by that new name they didn't know him as what savior of the whole world which is means saving the whole world or however he says I am Joseph doth my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his brother and come near to me I pray you and they came near and said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold into Egypt imagine the fear and regret and just the automatic reverence silence I just petrifying fear I'll say like that nevertheless now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life North verse 6. for these two years half the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earring nor Harvest so let's say a word of Prayer the father Lord Jesus Lord we love you Lord we thank you for the state and though we thank you for this time we've gathered together Lord and Lord God you've ordained all these things Lord even right now Lord we ask Lord you would be with Pastor Jesse Lord and oh God you know everything about this situation Lord Jesus we pray Lord you would make yourself manifest among the people there Lord and Lord God may it be so refreshing Lord to hear the true word of God and Lord for certain you know this invitation came for no for a reason of no reason of not Lord but Lord there must be a hungering in someone's heart Lord there must be a sheep there Lord crying come help come help and Lord God you sent one of your servants said oh God lord and drove a long way Lord to bring forth your man of this day Lord God will be with him Lord strength of God lord even if he speaks right now Lord may you guide his words his lips God his very actions Lord today Lord God be with them Lord I know we certainly love and appreciate you Lord bless the service as well you may have receipts Well when things certainly we know is the uh your pastor is very equipped to introduce someone to the message of the hour to bring forth the word I'll say like this a old friend of mine called me and he of course needs me to do some Plumbing so I went over to his compound as if I would call it because that's kind of what it is and I started roughing in two bathrooms for I mean I'm working down there and it's a two-level school he's splitting the top half to live in and I'm working down in the basement of course I had to cut the concrete Hammer gunned it out tie into a sanitary and run it up and just started running lines Branch off hit the water lines I got the entire Place running uh and as I'm working it used to be an old church school and sisters are God bless you oh yeah I talk about restoration and so I'm working down there and I'm they placed all my pipe and fittings in the hallway there and as I'm walking to the hallway and look and they have this picture sorry I have a little bit of so I'm walking and there's a picture laying on the floor leaning against the wall and it's a picture of someone had drawn it was a painting all the painting of all these fruits and it's in like an old basket there's fruits of grapes and oranges and apples and this and this and I kept thinking oh man that's a that's a fruit drawing you know of all this fruit I guess uh guess who the artist was J.R Smith and I kept wondering I was like J.R Jay Jesse Ray Smith and I said well certainly he has the fruits of the spirit so God sent a man there to Amish country with the fruit of the spirit and I was actually going to ask them to give that so I give the brother Jesse because he definitely Bears I know I'll be honest uh brother Jesse had me teach their the Sunday School Lord there for the children uh a while back and then he told me he had taught a little bit on something a certain topic I said send it to me brother the link and he sent me to me and here he is sitting here and he was going through certain topics and at the end he'd say two collapse and and I was like wow that's very good we could see he had he was built for children for teaching and and the Bible says a pastor must be apt to teach and uh certainly we saw I was just I didn't get a chance to respond to that to the video but I watched it I was like wow it was fantastic and young sisters are super uh spiritually industrial Powerhouse mental thinking deep thinkers uh I mean I heard some of the questions that's why that's why brother Jesse taught on that one so it was a really really encouraging to see them interact with their pastor and just ask some deep questions on uh I believe that was on the vows or the Nazareth vows and I'm like wow my goodness wow anyhow it was impressive I said thank the Lord for those things you know and how the I mean children of this age are asking questions and have the understanding to ask a question you must be able to think about it and understand it and be able to focus enough to bring those thoughts forward and then wow it was just I'm not trying I mean it just it was just a blessing to see so anyhow Let's uh let's see here let's get into this here by God's grace so I was thinking uh you know we uh I was down for a little little break a little vacation down in Texas to see brother Randy and sister Lindsay and a really good time they just being around them I just there's no stress you know there's some people you talk with and some people you interact with and you see virtue you know you just lose virtue because it takes so much strength or you know to be around or to fellowship or it takes sometimes just take and then for some reason you know brother Randy just just like hanging out with my brothers you know it's just there's no virtue left or or taking or it's just equal there's nothing there's no energy being you're just relaxing together and enjoying each other just there's no stress there's no effort or energy put forth so and then he shared that uh and I share these I share this because we're very close to the end here now uh just recently wasn't January or February or however it was it was announced that the the big economic forums the the leaders of the day have now went through their practice run on a global collapse uh so I don't know if you remember back in 2019 uh they had a forum or a meeting and a test run or a war games on a uh on a global plan or pandemic pandemic if you want to say it also we'll just say it's pandemic okay so they had that test run and it wasn't just a couple of months and boom here we are March 2020 and uh it started and here they had test run it before and they announced it and here here it is so now they have just did their war games with the economic World collapse how many months do we have left a year a year and a half this thing is coming fast and I want to as that thing was relayed to me and I looked at the article and I was like oh my goodness we're very very close this thing is coming you young eyes you're going to see a lot here but remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if there the Bible says ye must become like a child and which is which is what you just believe all things you have faith in your mama you have faith in your daddy and the children will have so much faith in God almost maybe more powerful Faith just an absolute ability to believe the word of God and receive from him so us adults might need them as well we'll see but I believe God is going to bring his Rapture and Grace his rapturing faith into the Believers and just fully I say let's press it out and it'll be made manifest so I want to teach on this topic here what will we see first so I want I want to to elaborate on this I want to maybe do a little study it'll be just a real simple study remember as the disciples saw Christ leave into the clouds and Ascend and leave their Bible said there was two men standing and I said why are you guys gazing up into the sky he says that which you just saw will come the exact same way as he left so uh the second coming will be just like or something like the first coming so and a couple of years ago in the midst of uh people leaving the message I did a little study and I think Jesse said he did the same kind of study but I went through and I I found all as far as I could found as many uh interpretations speaking in tongues interpretations through the prophet's message and I want you I want to play I want you to see this one again okay because I pulled this up because it reminds me of what's taking place okay this is not something uh that was uh just because it's just going to happen out of nowhere this was planned altogether now notice this is 1959 he says now listen friends if there's anyone here Among Us that if anywhere down along his life's journey that a little bitterness has come into your heart hear me get out of there now right he says get that don't let nothing now notice as he's saying about getting the bitterness out of your heart and letting just live love one another notice a sister just kicks up speaks in another tongue he's and then the brother gives the message so you can actually listen to this and now here's the interpretation I had to listen to it and then type it out and it took me these things take me a while because I'm slow typer about 10 words a minute he says yay now notice this is the interpretation he says yay my people I speak unto thee as my Prophet has stood in the midst of thee and declared my holy word he says I speak unto thee by my spirit saith the almighty God he says you've heard my prophet he says but now it's time for me to speak right this is the holy spirit speaking now using the gifts within the local assembly the local church and now he's conveying a message and what is he's trying to convey here he says I have spoken days gone by concerning these things even this very hour there are great plans being made yes that shall bring the hour of Destruction upon this Fair land the Holy Ghost knows all things the Holy Ghost was in the very rooms where these great men are planning the very destruction of America the taking over the entire world and the Holy Ghost here calls this out this is before conspiracy theories before people even suspected the government 1959 it was America everybody wore their flags and had you know running their Flags here and that had their flags on their on their lawns and everywhere whatever he was proud to be American what they had just recently ten years before that won the second world war ma the Baby Boomers are hitting they're growing up they're getting jobs now they're back home what America is prospering America is at one of the heights of itself even this very hour there are great plans being made yea that shall bring the hour of Destruction upon this Fair land even in this world tonight they are spiritual forces being gathered together that shall come against thee my people look at this he's telling you there's something coming for you he's warning isn't this the grace of God that he's warning you about what is coming now it continues on but I say unto thee unto thee be thou not discouraged in that day nor our brother sigh if the economy drops and the money fails what will we be what will we eat we're going to be we're going to be out in the streets and we're gonna what did the holy spirit this isn't even a prophet the prophet you have to discern you have to you have to weigh what the prophet says you have to you have to pray with the prophet says you know we got but this here is the holy this is a thus saith the Lord he says be not discouraged in that day nor hour sorry Friday I core drilled a whole like third 20 or 30 holes concrete and I just breed concrete dust all day sorry that was a little sick for I say that I am the great almighty God yeah even as I took my children in the land took my children from the land of bondage yay even as I also brought them in brought them in the wilderness to the promised land even so shall I take thee home with me what have we got to worry about and I say unto thee my people be not discouraged but put thy trust in the almighty God Sister Christian you've got a lot of children how are you going to feed all those children do you have enough plantain plants on your property to feed indefinitely Or what we're going to be trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ in that hour let's say when brother Jesse and Sister Christian all those children get so hungry they might look in their backyard and plants just start growing up like Jack the Beanstalk and giant fruits start making manifests anything can happen hey we're not we're not dealing with a God who cannot save his right arm is Not wax cold or sh or short or lacks of strength we have a powerful God this morning and what we are going to need him and we're going to have to what we're not going to be silent about it we're going to have to lift up our voices and cry into the Lord and say Lord God Deliver Us from this evil Lord you are the great provider you're the great savior amen praise God all things are possible anything you desire if you're hungry just ask if you're walking in the will of God just ask and he will deliver amen inspired on that one for I say that I have loved thee with my great love behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great Dreadful day of the Lord what we've heard the word we've heard the restoration we understand if there's a church that's tall well it's definitely this church right for I say that I love thee with thy great love and I have called thee out of the world of sin and speak these words that thou mightest be chosen be chosen people that in thee might might manifest my power and Glory uh as un uh I'm not sure what that thing is the US unto thee that out that thou might be encouraged power and Glory uh maybe unto her power saints of God this is a thus saith the Lord this is a prophecy from 1959 reaction to an action so as these things start hovering towards you what is at his what is his reaction to them coming against you he's going to take you he's going to deliver you all these things are going to be he promised it right here now as we are entering into these things what will we see first what will we see first now notice here in II Thessalonians 2 and 9 he says let's start verse 8 and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now notice this is when the Antichrist is revealed there is uh brother Kim we were talking the other night and he said he said they're trying to push this Pope in right now they're trying to push him out and bring in another one so this might be the one I mean all even the even the Catholic prophecies uh are saying this there's going to be a bad Pope there's going to be another one rise up there's going to be one that is bad and of course we know this so we know exactly who this is uh but he said the bride won't see him necessarily in that mode now and he shall come with what even him whose work coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness and unrighteousness and then the perish because they received what not the love of the truth see saying to God that's why we are to love the truth what is the truth well the prophet said this and the prophet said this but what is the truth he said over here a different way he said that he would hear a totally different way this one he said different he said it Opposite over here but what is the truth that's why we need what the Holy Ghost to take all these quotes even even the scripture well it says right here uh this and it says right here this but we need to what rightly divide the word of God Amen now notice but we want truth we want to know exactly the precise path with all Clarity with everything that's just so it's just so clear as a glass I'll say like that so we know exactly what the word of God is saying to us in each day and each minute an hour now and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie because they did not care to find out what the truth is once you reject truth you go into darkness right once you reject the light there's nothing but Blackness right now as we go into this what shall we see first now remember there's only two Spirits working there is the Holy Ghost God himself Spirit form and there's the Antichrist which is the Devil Himself everything will be between those two right there and the prophet God I have I saw a quote the other day he said he said when this thing comes he says everybody's in the Middle Ground most most people in the world right now are in the middle ground he says but when this law is passed he says when this thing starts forming up he says there will be no middle ground left he says what he said he said everyone is going to have to make a decision and take a stand here or take a stand here they're going to have to choose right then now notice now look at the power I want you to look at the power of unity of coming together you know in Psalms 133 verse 1 through whatever 3-4 the Bible said how sweet is it for Brethren to dwell in unity right you know when when this brother needs this and brother Malachi says brother amen can you give us the advice some work advice on this or this or that and how I did this and you know brother man okay I could call Uncle cam say okay how do you TIG weld so good and this and this or brother Dustin how do you lay out these pipe Fighters and this and that and whatever or brother uh brother uh uh Vang how do you how do you do the CNN machine and this and this what he now he can pull from older brothers other older men and then they'll give them his knowledge and whatever and and vice versa with the sisters and brother sister I'm just feeling so much lower today can you pray for me the sister will pray and God will answer and bring to deliverance and what God loved those things when we take care of one another we look out for one another what the Bible says what he dwelleth he said he's pleased for those who dwell on these it's like what the anointing oil that came over what Aaron's beard right it's like the holy ghost coming on God is so pleased with that that well he'll bring the Holy Spirit down on them kind of people now and that's the unity of his people but now look at the unity of the faults here in Genesis 11. you know me and my wife were talking about this about a month ago notice here in Genesis 11. and the whole earth was of one language and one's speech they were so Unified freshly after Noah's Ark they what gathered together and now they're what they have a plan I heard one brother said he says they're doing this he says to take Vengeance on God for destroying uh their fathers in the pre-flood era right now Notice season and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East now notice they left the East and everything was supposed to be good in the East if you do the study on the East Gate he says that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelled there and they said one to another go-to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly that they may uh and they shall and they had brick for stone and slime from mortar and they said go go to let us build us a city in a tower whose top May reach unto Heaven what were they going to do when they reach up to heaven they're going to try and take over but their whole goal was to build this thing and reach up into heaven now notice he says and let us make a name this is full denomination right here this is full what serpent seed he says lest we be scattered upon abroad on the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the men build and now notice the Lord knows all things he came down checked it out and he's like okay well they're really up to something sure he says and the Lord said behold the people is one and they will have and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them see the power of unity because that Unity brings a faith it builds something I'll say listen if we're all uh uh I'll say this not Cleveland Browns fans because we always lose but if we're like uh let's say another team that wins a lot and we all had our gear on and sisters would get their numbers and have their jerseys on and brothers would have to paint their chests and this and that and and we can all gather and we'll have we're going to a church football game and we're you know we'd all have we'd all be rallied together we'd be like yeah yeah yeah we're gonna go watch our team win right and just the faith of it we're believing but what God God honors what faith that's why people are getting healed at Beatles concerts people are going to heal by what Elvis concerts those things one because they had faith in what they were doing and through that Faith they were receiving what they needed at that time but now here's a people who's imagined something that are going to build something and that's so much faith and belief that they could do it God said they would actually be able to do it what did God do you think God the Lord Jesus Christ was scared he says go to let us go down he says and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's language did he say hey guys let's Angels let's write all these language books we're going to drop all these there's going to be a Chinese there's going to be Lao language there's going to be a English language there's going to be a a a Spanish language there's going to be a and then the Russian language and they're gonna drop all these books off and these people are going to have to learn their languages and this and that and then they'll be they'll forget everything they knew no God literally just came down and reprogram their minds did it say he had to teach them their language no that's how powerful the Lord Jesus Christ is when he comes down he just says well they're going to do that but guess what I'm just going to go here and reprogram them I'm just gonna put them all to sleep and when they wake up they're not going to know how to talk to each other that's how just how easy it is for him does it seem like it was a hard battle to win no it was not a hard battle it was very very simple he just come on down says well and then they wake up and they're like they couldn't understand each other's words right now notice that's exactly what God did so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of the Earth and they left they left off to build this city there it is God defeated him one time they're going to go Ascend it in they're going to take over they're going to judge God for judging them they're the fathers and this and this however God just said no and that's just not going to happen sorry could he do it yeah he could do it but I'm not going to let you do it right now notice here let's just read these things because how how what about Unity how's it going to bring these things what we'll see what will we see first right and Joseph nourished his father and his brother and he's in all his father's house with bread according to the families and now notice here as this drought as the spamming gets worse and worse let's just examine this now notice this is right this is in God's Playbook God allowed this God set this famine God allowed these things to take place and now notice Satan is watching this and Satan's taking notes look how the people react with as they run out of money look how the people act as they get hungry look at the people act how they get anxious and how they get desperate and what would they do here and notice how they do this and he's watching every family and he's just watching every person he's learning their the weaknesses of the flesh I'll see it like that Genesis 47 verse 13 and there is no bread in all the land and the famine was very sore so the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine they're getting weak they realize nothing's growing they're two three years in at this point he says and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt in other words they took all their money and bought as much food as they could to last them what as long as possible year he says and Joseph brought all the money to Pharaoh's house and when the money failed in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto pharah or sorry Joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money failing there was an economic collapse and Joseph said give your cattle and I'll give you for your cattle if money fail says okay you don't have any money fine what do you have when I know you have animals and this and that he says give me your animals so notice it was a slow walk people at work are like oh I've got guns and I've got this saved up how long is that going to last you the devil's very patient too it was remember the prophet of God I was like this Jesus prophesied of that tree that would grow up and that was a seed to have a mustard and all the fowls of the air he said that was the prophecy of what's coming 2 000 years ago and God allowed those things he washed those things and he just let the what the devil take his time and this and this and God take his time as well and Joseph said give your cattle he says I'll give you for your cattle is for money and they brought their cattle into Joseph and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for asses and and he fed them with bread for their cattle for that year wow we're good we're saved for another year they're just kicking the can of debt down one more year the uh the ceiling the dead ceiling's been going on just we're going to raise it one more time and when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my Lord how that our money is spent our Lord also hath our herds and cattles there is not there is not all left in the sight of the Lord but our bodies and our lands selling themselves now will come down to therefore shall we die before nine eyes he says both we in our land by us and our land for bread and we in our land will be servants unto the Pharaoh and give us sea that we may live and not die and the lands be not desolate so here they they're at the point now where it's by us by us and we will be owned by you and they willingly gave up themselves as property and sold themselves out to pharaoh and notice here verse 25 and they said thou has saved Our Lives they were very very happy for it should they be absolutely this was a good one I would have loved to been right there too absolutely God what God used Joseph to save us praise God and Joseph what was a type of Christ but now notice what's coming is going to be working as the work of the devil now notice but also here we see in verse 22 only the land of the priests bought he not for the priest had a portion assigned to them of pharaoh and to eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold out their lands now notice all the ones were an exemption or the essential workers were the priests why the prophet of God said he says he says he says when this economical move comes he says the ministers the preachers will be tempted to give in to serve what in the world church instead of being not being able to serve God in the public eye at all but they'll also receive a little reward for that as well as my plumbing inspector says he says he says about the American he says we have the best politicians money can buy and pretty soon they'll have the best priest money can buy his will sure now let's continue on here now notice here he says what will happen he says he says just exactly like it was in the days of Noah that won the day of Mercy that one day he's at the door of Mercy will be closed then the scripture says the sanctuary becomes Smoky that means uh the intercessor will be gone I'll say like this saints of God is Christ come down and is is God is the Lord Jesus Christ off the mercy seat right now no we see that as your pastors down in Amish Country trying to win souls for Christ it shows what the grace is still here amen God is still up on that Mercy Seat what interceding what for our sins what by his Precious Blood amen now he says now he goes how I could speak of different things as we know that right promised here in the last days we see it right before us he says he says another red light flashing carrying along among our women he says things like that they're doing we see we see it's pointing every Milestone or milepost everything every needle every Compass is set straight unto his coming we're at the end now notice here's what a lot of I'll say this there's I've heard this a lot in in my little listings of ministers we're at the end there is nothing else I know to happen but the coming of the Lord now he says this in 1963 after the seals and people say look he says we have nothing there's nothing else coming the just the coming Lord the Rapture that's all we're going to see that's the only thing next The Prophet's coming done what he did this and this we're restored we're all back and such and such but is this the truth is this fully the Revelation is this the just one quote Revelation no now notice here's number two uh quote he says I can't say the Lord told me he says I can't see the I can't say the Lord told me so this is not as of saith the Lord he says but I believe that this generation living now will witness that Rapture that's how close I believe I can't see nothing else coming but it's not thus saith the Lord but what did Jesus tell us we would see first before the Rapture what did Jesus say we would see first oh Malachi 4 absolutely but what's after that notice here we know the parable of the wheat in the tears but notice in verse 30 let both grow together until the Harvest we're there now we're at the Harvest time we see the maturity of insanity we see the the full of fruitation of confusion if Satan is the father of Lies and lies bring forth confusion and he's the author of all confusion here we are we have arrived we're at what the Harvest Time and in the time of the Harvest I'll say to the Reapers go ye gather first the tares this is what we're going to see first is the Gathering of the tares well brother Sai they were gathering in The ecumenical council but remember in 2014 Tony Palmer went down there he says the lutherans have joined with us the Methodist said for joined with us he says uh the the this and that and he said but no Evangelical has joined up with us yet but they're going to but what are we what are we going to see first The Binding of these tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn but first we're going to see this Gathering as your pastor did what a little study on the Asbury Revival it was complete worship for weeks and weeks and weeks with no word no there's Doctrine we had a minister come a while back says we got to lay down all our Doctrine I'm like oh no no no no the doctrine is the heart and soul of God Almighty absolutely saints of God you better know your Doctrine you better stick with the doctrine and say nothing contrary to what was revealed to this hour to this day amen now so are these things were those things prophesied this coming against like we saw in 1959 that prophecy that come up says he says they're planning destruction right now for this for you they're coming after you now notice here in Psalms 83. a song or Psalm of ASAP keep not thou silent oh God no notice it's in a time of Silence what was Silence about half an hour that seventh seal the coming of the Lord there was silence for about we know the Revelation from the first to the sixth seals we know exactly what that we know the Seven Seals broken up into three parts right and that first part was what the seven Thunders but in that time between those releases of those things he says there's a time of Silence he says well God hold thy peace and not be still hold not thy peace and be not still oh God for thine enemies have make make a tumult and they they hate thee shall lift up their heads they have taken crafty counsel this is exactly what that's Holy Ghost what the Holy Spirit spoke to them in 1958 he says they've taken crafty counsel against thy people and a consulted against thy hidden ones who are these hidden ones those that have been born again those that have received the Holy Ghost those that are what are hidden in Christ Jesus amen this is you he says they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of Israel be no more no more in remembrance for they have consulted together with one consent notice all of them came together who who came together and confronted confederated against the team together the Tabernacles or the churches or the prophet of God said The Lodges the Beast lodges these have what come together against what the Bride of Jesus Christ the Tabernacles The Lodges of Edom ishmaelites the Moab a MOAB the hagaronites all these ice boom you name them all come together to want to destroy God's people now notice what does it say verse 12 who said let us make take to ourselves the houses of God in possession what the prophet God say in the church age book he says when this thing comes down he says they're going to take your churches and make them storehouses they're just going to take them over and for stores for military or however right there exactly what exactly in the scripture right there it is they're going to take we're not going to be able to win worship here we'll have to go on the ground we'll be hiding under the feathers the wings of Jehovah but now notice what does God said oh my God he says make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind as the fire burned now notice this is what the Gathering of the tares right here they have gathered together to what come and destroy the wheat but notice as they gather God God knows it he says he says as the stubborn before the wind and as a fire burneth of a wood he says and the Flames said the mountains on fire he says notice he says bind him he says and they'll be burnt that's exactly right now there's a quote where the BAM said he says he says you better run from denomination he says you better run from organization with all your might he says flee from it stay away from anything that looks organized because what is the denomination is the mark of the beast absolutely he said Trinity is a what the mark of the beast now notice he says uh now what do they do now all of them he says no Jesus said in the last days he would bind first he'd bind all what the tares is that right boy he says they're sure binding up now World Council church has got them every one Pentecostals and all he says they're all bound together for the burning that's exactly right uh-huh separating separating them for from the wheat praise God for that he says that's right he says separating them all out unbelievers don't walk in their way he says don't go by their learning he says come by the word of God he said that's right don't be dismayed at the signs of God true signs of Heaven that's right now let me say like this the other night I was eating some pizza sweet Lemmy over here Pastor cam and Emma's like brother Psy what was that thing you're talking about three levels of hell and I reiterated it and my pastor goes what quotes that and I go well I don't know and that thing got on my mind and I go somebody in this message taught me that so what I do yesterday I started looking for that quote I started looking for this I could not find it so I had to I asked a little Emma to forgive me for that but I'll tell you like this we've been in this message 20 years now plus some of us but I heard things and I was taught things that were not necessarily true and I'm still finding these things out that those things that were false I'm still reiterating them and teaching them and telling people about these and yet there's nothing to them as far as I know now keep looking for those quotes but see that's how we've got to be so careful and here I told my sweetheart niece right here something I could not even prove I said oh my goodness God have mercy on me it almost said it it sent like almost like a chill through my my body and I was like it's Emma Jane that's nobody like a Lydia or a Malachi these are these are the I'm related to these These are leaning on things out they see me as a teacher of the Bible I said man I've got to be even more clear I've got to be so careful you've got to prove these things I got to make sure what I'm saying is correct I'm gonna put such an urgency as just something in my heart I was like God forgive me so I want I mean I'm so sorry I said those things and I've taught that before I believe but it was because I had heard it's from someone in the message or was taught it by someone the message and I just took it as gospel but that's a as far as I know right now that was not that's not in the word now there is the Bible says a lowest town and a greater sins and those sort of things but I have to study it a little more so I want to retract to that thing so I I publicly asked your forgiveness sir especially from him on if I taught it before here so now let's continue on here but that just really shook me and I was like God Mercy where did I hear that hear that now notice let's continue on here we're at 44 minutes everybody okay now notice I wanna I wanna I wanna take you down a little Trail here as I thought about uniting and coming together and as we said before there's only two Spirits there's the Holy Ghost and there's the devil and everyone is controlled by one of those two spirits and if you look at Israel after Mount Sinai and the Ten Commandments God set up a priesthood and that priesthood was good for a while and then it began to go downhill and then because they went downhill God if you read Isaiah if you read Jeremiah and Ezekiel God blast the priesthood it was all because of them that the people fell and the God was angry of the people and then God sent them what into captivity and they went into captivity with a priesthood but they come out then with something different and as we see now the coming up of Christ and when Jesus started appear on Earth and those sort of things we find things set up that are not priesthoods like they were in the beginning but it was something different now look at this notice the prophet of God comes on the scene John and the same John had his Raymond and camels here and leather girdle around his loins and his meat was Locus and Wild Honey thank God it wasn't spiders or scorpions he says then went out to him Jerusalem and jujita and all the land around Jordan and were baptized of him and Jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism you know Pharisees were disagreeing they were separate groups well I don't believe it this way and I don't believe it this way well I'm a fair sealer I'm a sadducee right I'm a scriber however there was groups or factions of priesthood but notice when the when the Prophet come on the scene they laid down all their Doctrine and their fussing and fighting and all their disagreement to come and see what this new thing was to say that was when they showed up there's John baptizing the Pharisees looked over sagacy and said bring it man put up your dukes 50 Styles right no you see that but they came and they said okay we better check this out ourselves and they said yeah let's do that let's just examine them do a little cross-examination to this man baptizing notice how they came together and to examine his baptism just like the prophet of God says he's don't do not get baptized in the fathers and Holy Ghost he says but what get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen and even today right now the Pharisees and Sadducees come to this baptism and they still refuse to get baptized in the name amen and now notice what the prophet calls them he says oh Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come now notice look at the name of the Pharisees I love Gill I just love Gill and Barnes they're my favorite favorite he says but now this being the first place in which is mentioned in giving is made of the Pharisees and the Sadducees it may not be amiss to give some accounts of them once for all to begin with the Pharisees and first for their namesake some derive this word from for a Tas which means divide or to make a breach Fair as which was we saw right after the flood when the earth began to separate right or the however the lands or however people he says whom Perez had his name right there in Genesis 38 29 he says the Pharisees who separate themselves from the people as righteous persons we're called the Visas or the divided so here we see what this is the original Nicolaitans they were a group of ministers who just separated themselves from the people and from another group of ministers he says another place because the Pharisees were divided from the Jews uh on the account of the Superfluous or however you want to say that flower sir us observations they also took their name from their disagreement I'll just continue on here he says the Pharisees according to the name certain divided and seditious persons and true it is that the sect also meddled with the Affairs of the government okay this is amazing where the Nicolaitans started what in the Ephesian Church age and at on the second Church age or right around that and 325 A.D that Nickelodeon that religious group then joined up with political Rome the government this is one of their traits he says we're a very ambitious of being concerned of them now notice they wanted to mingle with the government and religion they were ready for the marriage even back then for what with Rome that's the nature of that spirit I saw that I was like praise God that's exactly right now notice then came to him certain of the Sadducees now notice they all gathered together see John the Baptist and now the Savages come and examine Christ now himself and they try to trick him they came to him certain Sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they said unto a master and they asked the question and we know what the question we know the answer to the story and all those sort of things and Christ answered them in such a way he says you neither know God nor the power of God nor the afterlife nor the angels you don't know anything and he answered them in such a way it confounded them they didn't ask any meaningful questions after that but notice these two groups and Matthew 16 1 the Pharisees also with the sageties came and tempting Desiring him that she would show them a sign from heaven now notice once again a year or two later after John the Baptist they come together again lay down all their differences because remember it's between two spirits the holy who had the Holy Ghost Jesus did and who had the spirit of the devil they did right there and now notice those of one Accord they're just a different flavor of religion Pharisees Baptist methodists Catholic Presbyterian and a call you name it they're going to lay down all their Doctrine all their differences and they're come going to come and examine you the ones with the Holy Ghost you see what battle we're in for now remember the world what spirit is the world under what spirit is modern religion under what is everything majority apart or under the spirit of the devil and there's only one small group and that is the bride of Christ who are under the spirit of the Holy Ghost and that's why all the world will come against the bride of Christ because they're going to unify and come after them as we saw in Psalms now here's two major players in Christ examination in uh looking at Christ himself and is this a wicked man to be persecuted both Roman from Rome what would join these two together because we see they were enemies beforehand let's look at look look Luke 23 verse 6. then pilate heard of Galilee when piler heard of Galilee he asked whether this man be a Galilean pilot didn't want to do with him and they said well he's a galley and he's like oh he's out of my jurisdiction I can't judge this guy I'm sorry again I said we have to send him down to Herod that's his this is his deal now right he gets his tries to wash his hands there because what beforehand he found no fault with him as well and as soon as he knew that he belonged in the Harris jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time and when Herod saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad for he was desires to see him a long season be it heard of the many things of him and he hoped that he had seen some miracle done by him then he questioned him in many words but he answered him nothing he says the chief priest and the Scribe stood for him and he accusing now notice how the chief frees the religious were with Herod they're with the religious and they're trying to bring accusation they're right with the government right there and Herod with his men set war against him and not and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate so here comes Herod said just wrap him up in something pretty almost as a gift back to Pilate in other words these are heathens complete heathens and pilate must have thought that was kind of funny how he did that and notice the some kind of respect how one would send this one to the other and the other one sent it back and said no this is I can't judge it maybe you're greater than me and they kind of just made friends hear the Bible said and at that same day pile inherent were made friends together for before they were empty between themselves but notice the unity came when it come down to Jesus Christ the religious leaders of the world are going to come down and gather together what to fight who Jesus Christ and his bride can China and the U.S government and England get together no you see what our news is portraying everybody's against everybody trust no one there's their their government this and their government's that and the Russians are spying the Americans Americans find the Russians and all this this but once it comes down to a religious move and the manifestation of the sons of God are on the earth they're going to lay down all the and they're going to be friends like they've never been before because the Bible said what he says at that time he says what there's going to be ten Kings Ten Kings rise up that will serve underneath that Beast system they're all going to have the same equal rights King from Russia King from China King from this and king from that they're going to be all gathered together and we're just one big world Kingdom praise God they're gonna say but notice how fast friends they become at the coming of Christ and when the chief priest therefore and he offer saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucifying crucify him pilate said unto him taking him and crucify him he says for I find no fault in him and honest leader government leader examines Christ and what finds no fault in him I heard just down in Texas the brother he preached a sermon he said he said you know all they had to do in the Old Testament at the time of the sacrifice was a man would go out to his flock and we'd find a lamb and he would examine the lamb himself he could comb through it looking for this perfect no blemishes right oh it's a male it's a male absolutely okay this and this and he would take that lamb all the way to Jerusalem for sacrifice and then now he did his due diligence but that wasn't good enough now the priest himself would have to look over that lamb and inspect it and this and this and now when the priest said that lamb is good and they slew the land that was approved and qualified and said this one is Flawless as blemish then the man could say absolutely he's putting his trust in that sacrifice and then not no longer in himself see so notice as even the Heathen would examine Jesus Christ and say there was no fault in him the father himself said he said this is my beloved Son and who I'm well pleased hear ye him what when the father found no fault in him as well amen and that's why you as the bride of Christ you can look at yourself says this isn't good but our sacrifice was enough amen this sacrifice the sacrifice the the the persecution uh the the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was good enough his blood that lamb was good amen and then what you are clean if that lamb was clean then now you are clean amen because you become the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen I just thought that was fantastic now I find no fault in him but now notice with the Pharisees and Sadducees once again they do in John 19 11 Jesus said thou Christ have no power at all against me except that we're given from thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto him hath the greater sin and from thenceforth saw a pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out saying if thou let this man go Thou Art not Caesar's friend therefore whosoever maketh him a king speaketh against Caesar notice how fast these religious were able to what claim someone else as their King their natural King instead of what the King of Kings amen sure he says when pilate therefore heard the saying he brought Jesus forth and sat him down in the Judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement for the uh but in the Hebrews called gabatha Jesus and it was a preparing preparation of the Passover by the sixth hour and he said to the Jews behold your king now notice what was their testimony behold your king was this their King absolutely shall I crucify your king he says and the priests Chief priests answered he says we have no King but Caesar notice they went right back and intermingled with politics and this and this and we have no president but Trump we have no president but bideness no did they deny the word of God right here absolutely look at this in Psalms 24 verse 7 lift up your heads oh ye gates and be come up he says you Everlasting doors he says and the king of glory shall come in all the way through the Old Testament the Bible says what God is their King there is no other king amen now that might be a natural King but they knew the real Jews knew there is none King but what the Lord Jesus Christ amen his name was and the old was what Jehovah or or else or Elohim or however you want to say it but what they had a real spiritual King amen he says who is the king of glory he says the bat the Lord strong and mighty he says the Lord Mighty in battle amen he says lift up your head so he Gates even lift them up the Everlasting doors he's in the king of glories shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory how could they deny how could they say what they have no King but Caesar but here was a scripture a powerful Psalm what that displayed and revealed that there God was their King amen bye but what is the same spirit that wanted a king and Saul was in them absolutely unbelievable here's a whole bunch of scriptures God saying the Holy Spirit through David saying what God is our King God is our King they completely denied they did not want to serve him they did not know I said like this we have no King but Caesar what was John the Baptist ministry behold the kingdom of God is here John goes to prison Jesus said the kingdom of God is here and if there's a new kingdom coming there must be a new king coming into order amen hallelujah praise be to God and what the kingdom of God cometh not without observation but what is the spirit within you amen is a spiritual Kingdom and they wanted nothing to do with a spiritual Kingdom amen praise be to God yes his word is right now did that stop them there absolutely not well some some historians are saying that Herod and Pilate uh they had they made friends another kind of way had nothing to do with Jesus but it must have been like a secret thing or a sign or they made like a financial deal or had nothing to do with Christ but notice what the Bible the Holy Ghost Records about this in Acts 4 and 23 and being let go they went to their own company reported all that the chief priests and others had done under them and when they heard that they lift up their voices to God with one Accord and said Lord he says Thou Art God which has made the heavens and earth he says in the sea and all that is in them who by the mouth of his servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up he says and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ amen see all this all everyone that came had anything to do with this was what anointing of the devil because what the right here they're pulling from the scripture they're showing that what the devil and orchestrated all this through bringing Unity of the Heathen and the lost to do this he's for a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou Hast anointed thou has anointed he says both heard and Pat pontus pilate and with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together Anointed with what a spirit of delusion an antichrist Spirit what all the devil working everything notice the devil was working and God allowed them to be anointed that way to believe a lie and not want the truth bye you're going to watch this you are going to watch this take place here in the next couple months and years it's going to get stronger as the church age book said he said well he says as this religious movement becomes more and more political and they gain and they push the pressure it's going to be harder he said well it's going to be harder and harder to resist to lose our rights and our privileges whatever decide you won't be able to drive your sweet sweet 2012 truck okay I guess I'll walk I have a bicycle we don't know what's coming we know something's coming but what it's called all going to be they're all going to be anointed for this remember we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spirits and powers and principalities sure now notice here once again further into the perfect book of Acts Church Paul comes to a counsel as Paul begins to give his testimony this and this in verse one there Paul earnestly beholding the council and said men and brother and I I have lived in all good conscience before God unto this day and the high priest and US commanded them that stood by him to Smite him on the mouth then Paul said unto him God so smite thee thou white of all for since now to judge me after the law and commands me to submit in a country to the law they said thou revius God's high priest and then Paul said I which not Brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people no it's the Holy Ghost quickly brought in that scripture said man I shouldn't have done that I sorry I should not have done that but now Paul seeing himself called in a problem here and the Holy Ghost gives him wisdom and he's looking in the crowd he's trying to discern he said Lord God open these things up reveal to me what this Count's all about but when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other a Pharisees he cried out in the council he said oh there's my there's my ticket out right there he says God just revealed it he needed what God gave him wisdom how what to bring forth a division they all came together against what God's anointed but when the God's anointed saw who was together he used what the Bible said well he says be wise of the serpent but be General as a dove he says oh he says guys I'm a Pharisee another substantities are like and he cried out in the council he's met my brother he says I'm a Pharisee the son of a Pharisee look at my lineage he says of the hope of the Rapture resurrection of that he's in my called the question what'd he bring up he brought up a Doctrine and that Doctrine started a war right there and the Bible said Paul walked right out the people got so upset in the Bible said they're going to rip him the pieces but then I believe it was one of their their leaders here let's just read it uh he says and when they arose a great Ascension the chief Captain fearing less Paul would have been teared to Pieces commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force among them and bring him into the castle God brought him safely through the entire thing I there was one time I was in the council like that and God performed miraculously I mean so so what so what is this what was the whole persecution what was the whole point of the persecution to bring to be a witness of Jesus Christ in his resurrection and power and his gospel and that's all that pleased the Lord said Paul that's what you're supposed to do just tell him about me it's all that's all you need to do I preserved you but wait you've got one more mission you've got one more mission that might not be something greater than this just say I stand with the revelation of this hour the true way of baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ and there's only one person in the godhead and that's all that God might have you say or do or perform before these councils and just stand on the word of God and the night following the Lord stood by him Soldier messenger that's what a star be of good cheer Paul thou has testified of me in Jerusalem you did it exactly he said so then thou must bear witness also yeah in Rome am y so what you did here just threw over this other other place here absolutely here we go and the ten horns which thou sawest are Ten Kings which have received no Kingdom have yet it's coming they're about ready to get it but receive power receive power as kings one hour he's having one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast see what this is all about Jesus is coming and they want to try and defeat him I was witnessing to my Apprentice I said Apprentice man boy I said you watch the movies about the aliens and he's like yeah I like you ever notice that the aliens always want to destroy the Earth and they're always going to take over the Earth but somehow miraculously some giant amazing pilot comes out in uh the troops gathered together and there's a president rise up and gathers all the people the nations of all the world and we've got to come together and defeat on this Independence Day that was worldly a long time ago we watched the movie I watched that movie shorthand how's Ethan now and they all gathered together and they're out there f-16s blowing up these things that can like move the speed of light and they somehow defeat them all I said what are they trying to convey what are they trying to do to people right here I told them about this scripture I said they're trying to get the people to believe that they can defeat an alien someone that comes from up there coming down here to take over and what will these Ten Kings do they'll try to make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords and King of Kings amen now notice he's coming by himself and they that are with him are called The Chosen and faithful so what are we going to see first before the Rapture we're going to see The Binding of the tares fully we're gonna see that they're going to gather very rapidly now let's stand here I know I've been an hour hour and 10 11 right now now so let me let me read this for you Jesus said The Binding of tears that would gather the read The ecumenical move would bind the tares together for the Terrors must be bound first and through their and though their end is burning they are not burnt at their binding they're not burnt at their binding right he says but a reserved to a later date which is at the end of the Thousand Years or the second Resurrection but once the tares are bound the Rapture can take place see what we're gonna see what we're seeing we're on the verge of this right now if they said oh the leaders the The Heavy Hitters of this world supposedly said we're gonna do a practice run a little game here dropping the world economy they did it with the Coronavirus couldn't even couldn't even drink Starbucks couldn't even go out to eat half the time my wife had to make food at home think about you demonstrate and if that took place what about this next big thing coming but once the tears are bound the Rapture can take place and does so at some time between the binding and the revelation of the Antichrist they're pinpointed right there so as we see these things Gathering up and now they're going to usher in something new there's going to be something on the religious stage in the Catholic Church we're going to see it Pope so and so is going to go down and they're going to have their little conclave with the super smokes and this smoke and that smoke and rising up to their stack and however somewhere in between these binding and that the Rapture will take place let's look at this one more here but just when she is noticed Arena tears which have the first names until now have grown side by side than harvested when what niac sign out to accomplish has finally come to pass past with all the might of the organization the church the false Church turns from any Vestige of Truth and with political might reinforces herself with State backing see there it is the Clayton see what the Pharisees do go from religious and stay backing married once again and sets out to eradicate Forever The True Believer but just when she's about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is garnered is gathered into the Garner no longer with a wheat and tears gross side by side notice the Rapture takes place right there it's very very close together he says the evil spirit of church full of iniquity will be revealed as the Mustard Seed which grew into a tree where and lodged the files of the air at her head will be the Antichrist and the Mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must be true to the bride of Christ will mature and her ripeness shall be an identification with her Lord by the means of the word and her head who will come to her is the is the mystery of the godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against this True Vine notice a three-fold force the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did notice not only will she take a Rapture but before the Rapture as this binding and the Antichrist revealed in between there will be the full manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God than the rapture so this is what we're looking forward to this is what's going to take place we've got a brother in our church right now brother Freddie Hayes my brother Cam's preaching and he starts talking about the squeeze and the power of God and this and this he starts giggling he's like because he's excited for the coming Lord I'm just kind of like oh he's like Lord help me help me help me help me I'm like David I said Lord strengthen me keep me Hallelujah Lord God watch over this little one absolutely praise me to God amen I'm going to cry out until he does something absolutely now he says she'll do the very acts and power that Jesus did and as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come will come that the bride and groom would be uh Forever United can you come up and play here saints of God this is just something on my heart I just felt led the teacher because it doesn't seem like it could really happen can anyone imagine we can't go gas we can't go get no gas the bank accounts are shut down remember the Great Depression who do you remember if you studied and looked at the Great Depression when that collapse hit people went to the banks to get their money and the banks closed and you could get no money to do anything we're almost 100 years from that was that set up absolutely set up is this one set up absolutely set up Holy Ghost said so now let's let's read a couple quotes here not trying to leave you in in suspicion or just anxiety or however but he says he says uh he said he would bundle the tears first sure they're bundling up together all the World Council churches everything is of them going where it's all headed for that gives the church a chance to grow then see what we've been doing the last year since you've heard this word we've been growing our pastor has taught a study Wednesday on Deception what was Matthew 24 24 he said to be so close as to deceive the very elected and brother cam brought that deception what horse rider had deception horse rider in the first church age and what was the first church age Revelation in the church age is Ephesus and Smyrna it was the nickelatins that brought the deception that's why it's so important to be able to identify the Deeds because it's going to be a deception get a little persecution where you're not fed so well everything will have to be pushed together God's got a way of doing things you know when I haven't eaten for a day or two you think I'll be praying a two-minute prayer a three-minute prayer no it's going to be all-nighters back to all night prayer meetings until we hear from him it won't be seeking his hands anymore he'll be seeking his face seeking the very presence of God say Lord God deliver me amen let's play a little something special here football as well I am I feel it high alert we are the generation of
