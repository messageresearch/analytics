[34:18] thought tonight uh
[34:20] you know we have a we're having a youth
[34:22] service on saturday night so i kind of
[34:24] want to preach a little thought to the
[34:25] youth i want to kind of preach it here

[34:29] first
[34:30] and then uh preach them there brother
[34:32] cams saturday night we'll do you service
[34:34] and sunday morning just one service
[34:36] there so
[34:36] i'd like to go to first timothy four
[34:38] let's let's look at this thought
[34:40] i just want to take this thought let no
[34:42] man despise thy youth i just want to
[34:44] look at that just a general
[34:45] thought kind of to the youth this
[34:48] evening by god's grace
[34:52] so first timothy 4 verse 12 then we'll
[34:55] read our memory verse for
[35:00] may
[35:14] hmm
[35:17] first timothy 4 12.
[35:27] let's read that together just that one
[35:29] verse with uh plenty time tonight so we
[35:31] won't be in a rush or anything like that
[35:33] read that one verse and we'll read our
[35:34] memory verse for this month let's read
[35:36] that together on three
[35:38] one two three let no man
[35:41] despise thy youth but be thou
[35:44] an example of the believers in word
[35:48] in conversation in charity
[35:51] in spirit in faith in purity
[35:55] notice he listed six areas of a young
[35:58] man's life
[35:59] i thought that was really striking sixes
[36:01] the number of anointed man or fallen man
[36:04] right there's six pieces of armor and
[36:06] the full armor of god
[36:08] so it's very interesting the holy spirit
[36:10] led paul to name
[36:12] six areas of a young man's life let's go
[36:15] to psalm 19
[36:16] verse 13.
[36:43] praise god psalms 1 i'm sorry psalms 19
[36:45] verse 13 sorry
[36:52] all right let's read verses 13 and 14
[36:54] and may the holy spirit write this upon
[36:56] our hearts
[36:56] by god's grace the words of our mouth
[36:58] the meditation of our heart be
[36:59] acceptable in this god's sight
[37:01] verse 13 let's begin on three one two
[37:04] three
[37:05] keep back thy servant also from
[37:08] presumptuous sins
[37:10] let them not have dominion over me
[37:13] then shall i be upright and i
[37:16] shall be innocent from the great
[37:19] transgression
[37:20] let the words of my mouth and the
[37:23] meditation
[37:24] of my heart be acceptable in thy
[37:28] sight oh lord my strength and my
[37:31] redeemer let's have a word of prayer if
[37:32] you have
[37:33] a need on your heart tonight let's ask
[37:34] the lord to minister to us here
[37:37] we surely need god's grace uh tonight so
[37:39] let's go before the lord here heavenly
[37:41] father god we love you
[37:42] we bless your holy name lord we love you
[37:44] because you first loved us lord god
[37:47] we're just returning back lord are our
[37:50] humble expressions of love
[37:51] oh lord we know your love is unchanging
[37:53] your love uh
[37:54] is eternal father you loved us before
[37:57] the foundation of the world
[37:58] wrote our names on the lamb's book of
[38:00] life before the foundation of the world
[38:03] we recognize it here tonight that you
[38:05] loved us with this eternal love and lord
[38:07] we want to return our love to you father
[38:09] lord we want to take expression lord
[38:11] from this the scripture we're going to
[38:12] express
[38:13] this word lord god we want to uh be
[38:15] examples lord god
[38:17] and we want to lord live a life that's
[38:20] worthy of the gospel lord jesus
[38:22] so i pray you'd help us tonight father
[38:23] as we preach to the youth and
[38:25] lord imagine we're all young here
[38:27] tonight with me being the oldest lord
[38:30] uh i pray lord jesus you'd speak to
[38:32] every heart and prepare us for this
[38:33] weekend lord the ministry and also
[38:35] brother keith coming in lord

[38:38] weekend guide me by the holy spirit lord
[38:41] god may you speak
[38:42] words of life to us in jesus christ's
[38:44] name and the saint said
[38:46] amen god bless you as being seen to
[38:47] praise god
[38:54] all right so let's look to the scripture
[38:57] here let no man despise thy youth
[38:59] uh the same idea be thou an example look
[39:02] at this for a few moments here
[39:05] as i said i would like to uh
[39:08] you know start i've been directing my
[39:10] thoughts i've been writing down some
[39:11] different thoughts about preaching to
[39:12] the youth here
[39:13] this weekend and so i just want to kind
[39:15] of get this
[39:16] uh thought out and hope to be a blessing
[39:18] to you
[39:20] uh let's let's go back to first timothy
[39:22] four and i think
[39:23] i'll just background a little bit you
[39:25] can kind of get the context of this
[39:26] verse
[39:28] from first timothy 4.
[39:32] remember this book is a paul's first
[39:34] letter there to timothy
[39:36] it was his second to last letter he
[39:38] wrote before he was martyred
[39:39] right at the end of his life second
[39:41] timothy was actually the last letter he
[39:43] wrote
[39:45] and so remember this is the book of
[39:48] uh he warns about false teachers in
[39:50] chapter one
[39:51] how christ came to save sinners and and
[39:53] he was an example a pattern of
[39:56] how people would be saved you know
[39:58] blasphemers could be saved right
[40:00] the wretched the the the worst of all
[40:02] sinners could be saved paul was the
[40:04] example of that
[40:05] in chapter two that's the famous chapter
[40:08] for
[40:08] praying for the government right and
[40:11] then also women wearing modest clothing
[40:13] that's a good one
[40:14] chapter two and why women aren't called
[40:16] to preach chapter two
[40:18] then he shows how men are called to
[40:19] preach but they have to meet
[40:20] requirements
[40:22] uh bishop requirements deacon
[40:24] requirements
[40:25] in chapter three and he ends chapter
[40:27] three with the mystery of godliness
[40:29] which we believe
[40:30] i believe is the statue of a perfect man
[40:33] because god was manifest in the flesh
[40:36] and christ is the mystery of godliness
[40:38] in other words he shows us
[40:40] how to be godly uh god restored
[40:43] uh godliness to man through christ jesus
[40:46] and we live through the spirit of jesus
[40:48] christ we follow his example
[40:50] that's the chapter three now chapter
[40:53] four is where we pick up this is kind of
[40:55] where
[40:55] paul you know he has i think a couple
[40:57] more chapters here i think two more
[40:59] chapters yeah to deal with
[41:00] uh timothy uh and as we start reading
[41:04] here i've listened and read a few things
[41:06] timothy's either in his early 30s or
[41:08] he's about 40 years old
[41:11] so uh the ones i read said he probably
[41:14] got saved around 16
[41:16] through paul's ministry that's why paul
[41:18] would call him my son
[41:21] so he's probably 30 so this is maybe 15
[41:23] or 20 years
[41:24] after timothy was saved through paul's
[41:26] ministry
[41:28] timothy being a very instrumental part
[41:30] of paul's ministry
[41:32] and just learning how learning from him
[41:34] as a son would a father
[41:36] just being around him constantly kind of
[41:38] like the elisha and elijah type
[41:40] right uh or a disciple or a master and a
[41:45] disciple right just learning right there
[41:47] following along
[41:48] in his ministry but uh so
[41:53] i might say uh this scripture could
[41:55] apply to me i'm still 40. i'm 40 right
[41:58] so
[41:58] i could although i think i'm old or
[42:01] maybe joke around that i'm old i guess i
[42:02] would be a youth according to the
[42:04] scripture
[42:05] let no man despise your youth so paul
[42:08] was uh
[42:08] paul was speaking to timothy here as a
[42:10] young man
[42:12] but i want to just i want to just read
[42:13] through this chapter verse 1
[42:15] and i want to go down to verse 12 to
[42:17] kind of get you to see
[42:18] some of the background i mentioned some
[42:20] of it in the earlier chapters but i want
[42:22] to
[42:22] just read through it here verse 1 says
[42:24] now the spirit speaketh expressly
[42:27] that in the latter times some shall
[42:29] depart from the faith
[42:30] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[42:33] doctrines of devils
[42:35] okay so we know uh we we know this is of
[42:38] course fulfilled today
[42:40] uh later paul or paul tells the
[42:42] thessalonians i can church i'm sorry
[42:43] earlier
[42:44] paul told the thessalon thessalonican
[42:46] church he said that many would depart
[42:49] from the faith
[42:51] so we see this was something paul was
[42:52] constantly writing about
[42:54] that there was going to be a great
[42:55] falling away remember he said that in
[42:56] second thessalonians chapter 2
[43:00] and they would take doctrines of devils
[43:02] so that means devils
[43:03] have teachings right devils have
[43:05] instruction
[43:07] and it will never lead you to
[43:08] righteousness it would always lead you
[43:10] to unrighteousness there's doctrines
[43:13] that specifically come
[43:14] from devils right now doctrine means
[43:17] instruction it's actually telling you
[43:19] what to do
[43:20] right i heard a good thought i thought
[43:22] it was an interesting thought teaching
[43:23] is telling you what to do
[43:25] preaching is urging you to do it i
[43:28] thought that was a good thought
[43:30] and you know doctrine and teaching is
[43:31] telling this is how it happens
[43:33] but then preaching is urging you maybe
[43:36] rebuking you
[43:36] right putting a great burden on you to
[43:41] do it
[43:42] i thought that was a good a good
[43:43] illustration good way to say it
[43:46] uh because we have to have both we have
[43:47] to have preaching and teaching
[43:49] right so uh there are devils
[43:53] that are teaching devilish instruction
[43:57] in other words they're telling you the
[43:58] wrong steps right
[44:00] and we've been mentioning it you know
[44:02] with our false teachers we looked at
[44:03] false preachers last month
[44:05] how they'll instruct people to marry a
[44:07] second time or marry a third time that's
[44:08] a doctrine of a devil right
[44:10] that's a doctrine of a devil okay uh
[44:14] it's okay to allow tv shows and all
[44:16] kinds of evil things in your home that's
[44:18] a doctrine of a devil
[44:20] right so a lot of these things can be
[44:22] easily picked up on
[44:23] now verse two he starts getting into a
[44:25] few examples that were affecting
[44:26] timothy verse two speaking lies in
[44:29] hypocrisy so
[44:30] hypocritical lies having their
[44:33] conscience seared with a hot iron
[44:36] so these people can no longer feel the
[44:38] effects of false doctrine
[44:40] a church i don't want to get to that
[44:41] spot i always want to have a sensitivity
[44:43] to false doctrine
[44:46] like that buzzer we talked about brother
[44:47] brown said that you got buzzers there to
[44:48] protect your life
[44:50] but if if people keep sinning and keep
[44:53] accepting false doctrine
[44:54] that buzzer they'll stop hearing the
[44:55] buzzer right because the bible says
[44:58] their conscience is seared
[44:59] no more feeling they can't feel that
[45:01] anymore they don't have a sensitivity to
[45:03] the holy spirit
[45:04] i always want to be sensitive to the
[45:05] holy spirit where i'll be able to detect
[45:07] a lie
[45:09] i'll be able to detect if a preacher is
[45:11] maybe uh
[45:13] if i could just say like this if a
[45:14] preacher's got a complex
[45:16] they're really preaching hard on
[45:18] somebody and they're not really trying
[45:20] to help people they're trying to bash
[45:21] people right i'm guilty of that i've
[45:24] done that in the past
[45:25] because i've had complexes in the past
[45:27] i've asked the lord to forgive me
[45:29] you know preachers are human preachers
[45:32] are fallible
[45:33] but they still need to be sensitive to
[45:35] correction by the holy spirit
[45:37] right so that's the point i want to make
[45:39] here that paul
[45:40] was telling timothy demons have doctrine
[45:43] demons have steps they take in order to
[45:47] get the wrong result
[45:49] right they want to get the main result
[45:51] they want is iniquity because we talked
[45:52] about that workers of iniquity
[45:54] that's the main result demons want they
[45:56] want to instruct people so they remain
[45:59] enslaved in in pleasure right
[46:02] and the pleasures of sin for a season
[46:04] the bible says
[46:06] so that's where a devilish doctrine will
[46:08] take someone
[46:09] into total deception into sin
[46:13] now verse three forbidding to mary so
[46:15] this was a demon lie that was coming
[46:18] through uh local preachers that timothy
[46:20] was battling
[46:23] timothy's a young preacher so some
[46:26] preachers were
[46:27] forbidding people to marry and paul said
[46:30] that's a
[46:30] hypocritical lie that's a doctrine of a
[46:32] devil
[46:34] oh the rapture is soon to come and don't
[46:36] bother getting married that's a lie
[46:39] right that's a lie commanding to abstain
[46:41] from meat you can't eat meat you got to
[46:43] be a vegetarian
[46:44] that's a lie
[46:47] which god hath created to be received
[46:48] with thanksgiving of them which believe
[46:50] and know the truth for every creature of
[46:52] god is good
[46:53] and nothing to be refused if it be
[46:55] received for thanksgiving for sanctified
[46:57] by the word of god and prayers this was
[46:58] a big deal
[47:00] remember diet was a big deal in those
[47:02] days because they were coming out of
[47:04] judaism
[47:04] where they had a very strict diet into
[47:06] oh now you have all these liberties
[47:08] now you can eat this type of food it was
[47:10] a big deal
[47:11] so demons demons knew that was a big
[47:14] deal in that day
[47:15] so demons tried to anoint people to kind
[47:18] of get some of those
[47:19] ideas back right in other words to bring
[47:22] legalism back into the word and back
[47:24] into grace
[47:26] and so a doctrine of a devil would do
[47:28] that they tried to bring legalism
[47:30] back into grace but paul has to tell
[47:34] them
[47:35] watch out for those guys that say you
[47:37] can't eat meat watch out for those guys
[47:38] watch out for those guys that say you
[47:39] can't marry
[47:41] right you got to be single to the
[47:43] rapture
[47:45] so he has to correct them now verse 6
[47:49] if thou put the brethren in remembrance
[47:51] of these things now
[47:52] look at that that was the big trial that
[47:56] day
[47:57] marriage and then diet
[48:01] and that was a trial that they had to
[48:02] overcome the church what about our
[48:04] trials
[48:05] lebron tells us the pleasures of riches
[48:09] laziness and worldliness right now i may
[48:12] have misquoted that a little bit from
[48:13] the church age book
[48:14] oh soft live easy living soft living
[48:16] riches and cares of this world
[48:19] that's what we've got to overcome right
[48:21] so in other words the laodicean church
[48:23] age
[48:24] that's what we've got to overcome but in
[48:25] those days it was your diet you
[48:27] you know the devil would really try to
[48:29] get people on diet
[48:30] you really try to get them on you need
[48:32] to remain single to the rapture
[48:34] and you you you just you got to overcome
[48:36] those passions and you can't marry
[48:38] you know but paul said the opposite if
[48:40] you burn you should marry
[48:42] look at the wisdom of god on paul there
[48:45] but
[48:45] then paul said well i'd i'd have you you
[48:48] know to know that my gift is i could be
[48:49] single i don't know
[48:50] i don't have that problem right but the
[48:53] the devil was working in a false
[48:55] doctrine to get people to
[48:56] you know think they were more holy
[48:58] because of their diet or things they
[49:00] couldn't marry because the rapture is
[49:01] too close
[49:04] he said but you must you must
[49:07] be put them in remembrance and let's
[49:09] finish verse six thou shalt be a good
[49:11] minister of jesus christ
[49:14] and nourished up in the words of faith
[49:16] and of good doctrine
[49:18] whereunto thou hast attained in other
[49:20] words the preacher has to attain
[49:22] good living first or holy living first
[49:24] and then he can bring the people up to
[49:26] that type of lifestyle
[49:28] praise god now let's look at the word
[49:30] nurse nourish means
[49:32] to educate or so when you educate
[49:35] i'm sure you know you do a little at a
[49:36] time right it's just one day at a time
[49:39] one
[49:39] one little lesson at a time until you
[49:41] nurse them and educate them
[49:43] that's amazing for me to see how like
[49:44] some of my children like you know haven
[49:46] and
[49:47] working on like addition and
[49:48] multiplication but then lydia's back
[49:50] there doing chemistry you know it's
[49:52] just it's kind of like mind-boggling to
[49:54] me to remember that oh yeah lydia used
[49:55] to do that
[49:57] but but educating one day at a time
[49:59] takes you up to the spot where you can
[50:00] do
[50:01] chemistry and logic and latin and all
[50:04] kinds of things that lydia's smarter
[50:06] than me
[50:07] when it comes to those things that's
[50:10] that's nourishing right just a little
[50:11] bit of food
[50:12] a day is going to build up a pretty big
[50:14] child right a little bit of knowledge a
[50:15] day is going to bring up a pretty smart
[50:17] person
[50:18] right if you read the right books right
[50:20] if you read the right books pretty soon
[50:21] a little bit more difficult each day
[50:24] pretty soon they got a pretty good
[50:25] educated child
[50:26] right or you say young person well
[50:28] that's what the bible says the preacher
[50:30] does
[50:30] he gives you a little bit of nourishment
[50:32] a little bit builds you up
[50:34] uh in words of faith and doctrine he
[50:36] builds you up slowly
[50:38] that's why i like preaching through
[50:39] books of the bible right now sometimes
[50:41] i'll just jump like like this one i'm
[50:42] just jumping from one place to another
[50:44] but
[50:44] like preaching all the way through
[50:45] philippians or all the way through
[50:47] ephesians
[50:47] or like i did years ago i went all the
[50:49] way through daniel when we first got in
[50:51] here
[50:51] i went through all the way through the
[50:52] whole book of daniel i preached that
[50:54] whole book
[50:55] i like to just nourish you up a little
[50:57] bit at a time right we preached the
[50:58] whole way through the book of revelation
[50:59] a couple years ago right
[51:01] just nourishing just building you up and
[51:04] now a lot and when we do that church we
[51:05] find
[51:06] that we're able to grow a lot right and
[51:08] then when someone brings a scripture out
[51:10] of revelation like i just saw this week
[51:13] oh yeah somebody tried to say uh a false
[51:16] doctrine about brother branham that said
[51:17] uh
[51:18] the blood moons have already taken place
[51:20] and they
[51:21] they they play a quote by brother
[51:23] branham and they they misquote brother
[51:24] branham
[51:25] but we know because we've gone through
[51:27] the seals that the blood moons don't
[51:29] happen until the sixth seal
[51:31] in other words here's a here's a message
[51:32] believer and they're so
[51:35] they're so unnourished in the word of
[51:37] god they're so immature
[51:39] they don't they haven't even read and
[51:40] studied enough to know that the blood
[51:42] moons don't happen until the sixth seal
[51:44] until the tribulation
[51:45] in other words we won't see it because
[51:47] we'll be in the rapture praise god
[51:49] amen and they're and they're actually
[51:52] the title of the youtube video was
[51:54] that the blood moons has already been
[51:55] prophesied and fulfilled
[51:57] and that's nonsense because we know what
[51:59] the sixth seal says the sixth seal says
[52:02] the moons will turn to blood right and
[52:04] the sun won't give us light anymore
[52:06] i mean there's and then that was given
[52:08] thus saith the lord brother adam gives
[52:10] us the seals
[52:10] with thus saith the lord so what i'm
[52:12] saying is that god see when we
[52:14] when we follow god's way of slowly going
[52:17] through the books and teaching all the
[52:18] word of god
[52:19] and nourishing strengthening up you
[52:22] become a pretty solid christian
[52:24] and there's those devils are going to
[52:26] have a hard time deceiving you
[52:28] on some of these issues that don't mean
[52:30] we're we're free from battles we have a
[52:32] battles in other ways
[52:33] but we should be mature and the bible
[52:35] says we should grow up and attain
[52:38] unto faith and good doctrine praise god
[52:42] and paul said timothy you'll be a good
[52:44] preacher if you can
[52:46] build the people up this way that's what
[52:48] i want to be
[52:49] verse 7 but refuse profane and old wives
[52:53] fables in other words don't preach
[52:54] people's feelings preach the word
[52:57] and exercise thyself rather unto
[53:00] godliness so we don't want to be fables
[53:02] which is a tale
[53:03] or a fiction or a myth right we're not
[53:06] interested in old
[53:08] wives fables and tales we want to be
[53:10] exercised we want to devote our minds
[53:13] to godliness right to living holy praise
[53:16] god we don't want to see how loose we
[53:17] can be
[53:18] we want to see how holy we can live amen
[53:21] that's exercise now so we're either
[53:24] exiting ourselves with fiction
[53:26] or with holiness right that's why we got
[53:29] to be careful what especially as we get
[53:30] older what kind of books we read
[53:33] right or what kind of videos we watch
[53:35] because any fiction video
[53:36] anything that's fiction got to be very
[53:38] careful right because that could take
[53:40] you into thoughts
[53:41] that don't pertain to godliness right
[53:43] that's what he says right there
[53:46] okay so but you have to be exercised
[53:49] into godly things
[53:50] so as we come we become more mature in
[53:52] christ we got to be more interested in
[53:55] holiness how can i live a whole
[53:56] life how can i pray more how can i learn
[53:59] more about god
[54:00] right how can i how can i be a better
[54:02] witness like these are the things
[54:04] we want to be how can i be more patient
[54:06] right how can i be
[54:08] more loving how can i be uh how can i
[54:10] memorize more scripture right
[54:12] these are issues that that we should be
[54:15] interested in praise god
[54:17] not fiction tales right but the reality
[54:20] of gospel the gospel
[54:21] the fact that we're going to heaven and
[54:23] we want to be ready to go to heaven when
[54:24] jesus
[54:25] returns amen verse 8 for bodily exercise
[54:29] profiteth little so see there's only a
[54:32] little uh
[54:33] benefit for keeping your body healthy
[54:35] but godliness is profitable
[54:37] unto all things having promise of the
[54:40] life that now
[54:40] is and that which is to come may i just
[54:43] inject though
[54:44] see people will say this you know body
[54:45] exercise profits little but then
[54:47] today people get they look at that and
[54:49] they say well i don't have to work out
[54:51] or i don't have to exercise my body and
[54:52] they get really lazy and unhealthy
[54:54] because they'll eat too much ice cream
[54:56] right or they'll drink too much pop
[54:59] right which basically is asking for
[55:01] cancer
[55:02] right if you want cancer drink a lot of
[55:04] pop i mean
[55:05] diet or not diet that you're going to
[55:07] get you're pretty prone to get cancer
[55:09] right
[55:10] but see they'll take that and they'll
[55:12] they won't have the right balance with
[55:13] that right
[55:14] they won't remember that in bible days
[55:16] everybody worked hard
[55:18] if you didn't work hard you didn't eat
[55:21] hello
[55:22] you couldn't sit back and do nothing
[55:24] that's what paul said if they don't work
[55:26] they don't eat and so you had to be a
[55:28] hard worker
[55:29] right you had to the bible said be
[55:31] fervent in business paul said
[55:33] don't be a slawful lazy person be
[55:35] fervent in other words be the best you
[55:37] can praise god
[55:39] i had a parent write me a note today and
[55:40] they just you know tomorrow's the last
[55:42] day of school so
[55:43] they wrote me a note and said they said
[55:45] my daughter comes home and she says all
[55:46] this about you she says you truly found
[55:48] your calling in life you were born to be
[55:50] a teacher
[55:50] i thought well praise the lord i thank
[55:52] you lord i just in other words i just
[55:54] want to be the best i can be right
[55:56] i want to do what god's called me to do
[55:57] i don't want to try to impersonate
[55:59] somebody else
[56:00] i just want to be what god's called me
[56:01] to be right so that gave me a little bit
[56:03] of encouragement today
[56:04] uh to be the best i can be at what i'm
[56:07] doing
[56:09] and try to find the will of god but he
[56:12] said so see we don't want to
[56:13] uh we don't let our bodies go we but we
[56:17] but we can't we can't overemphasize the
[56:19] body right
[56:20] uh we have to but we have to exercise
[56:22] ourselves unto godliness
[56:24] and you'll see the blessings of of that
[56:27] right now
[56:28] and in the future and in heaven of
[56:30] things to come
[56:32] praise god so we'll see blessings now if
[56:35] we live godly
[56:36] and blessings to come praise the lord
[56:42] verse 9. this is a faithful saying and
[56:44] worthy of all ex
[56:45] acceptation uh that means yeah okay that
[56:49] they don't give a different definition
[56:51] verse 10 for therefore we both labor and
[56:53] suffer reproach
[56:54] because we trust in the living god so
[56:57] paul's telling timothy
[56:58] we are being reproached which means
[57:01] railed at
[57:02] taunted upbraided
[57:06] defamed so people are mocking us
[57:09] that's what paul says because when we
[57:11] live a godly life
[57:12] people are going to mock us right
[57:16] people are going to make fun of us right
[57:18] that's what he's saying here
[57:20] we labor and we suffer mocking
[57:23] right we suffer this reproach because we
[57:26] trust in the living god who's the savior
[57:28] of all men
[57:30] especially of those that believe now you
[57:32] can see in america and on the news
[57:34] right now there's a lot of anti-semitism
[57:38] right a lot of people are glad the jews
[57:40] were being bombed you see that in the
[57:41] liberal media not the conservative but
[57:43] the liberal media
[57:44] they're actually rejoicing that jews are
[57:46] dying well that same idea is going to
[57:48] come to christians before the rapture
[57:51] right because they're going to change
[57:52] the laws to kill anybody that disagrees
[57:54] with the beast
[57:56] right the roman catholic church so you
[57:58] can see it growing i
[57:59] i'm just 40. i've never seen
[58:02] anti-semitism
[58:04] so so public before this is the worst
[58:07] i've ever seen it where
[58:08] p you know the liberals and the
[58:09] democrats actually rejoicing that jews
[58:11] are dying
[58:13] that's god's covenant people right but
[58:15] that's under the noah or sorry the moses
[58:18] covenant
[58:18] we're the new covenant people so you
[58:20] know it's gonna if it's on them it's
[58:22] gonna come to us right eventually
[58:24] we don't know if it'll be in our
[58:26] lifetime or the next generation or the
[58:27] next
[58:28] we don't know but we if we see it
[58:29] growing now on the jews
[58:31] then it's gonna grow on us as well
[58:35] so i'm at we imagine that's only going
[58:37] to increase
[58:38] right it's only going to increase the
[58:40] hatred well that's what paul said
[58:42] paul said they're suffering reproach and
[58:45] we know for us
[58:46] it's only going to grow now i feel like
[58:49] this i feel blessed too
[58:50] because i feel like god's kind of he's
[58:51] going to hide us under the shadow of his
[58:53] wing right now
[58:55] right we're in america we're an actor we
[58:57] got a real small church most of our
[58:58] lives are pretty wonderful right
[59:01] so i feel i'm just saying i'm just
[59:02] thanking the lord i feel very protected
[59:04] right now
[59:05] so i thank the lord for that but that
[59:08] may not always be that way
[59:10] right it might not always be that way
[59:11] and we have to have job's faith
[59:13] the lord gives the lord takes away
[59:15] blessed be the name of the lord if the
[59:16] lord would take away our
[59:18] covering of protection we have to suffer
[59:20] more reproach or physical violence or
[59:22] someone tried to hurt us or something
[59:23] like that
[59:24] we'd have to stand there with the love
[59:26] of jesus christ and we have to be a real
[59:28] christian we have to bear
[59:29] some more reproach right because right
[59:31] now we just get reproached from family
[59:33] right
[59:33] family friends maybe but it's light
[59:37] compared to like being beaten or shot at
[59:40] or
[59:40] something like paul like the sword right
[59:44] or daley being robbed like he had to
[59:46] suffer right robbers and all the evil
[59:48] men and all kinds of things
[59:50] so we got to keep that in mind and i'm
[59:52] trying to get to the young people i just
[59:53] i
[59:54] i guess i didn't realize i'm stopping so
[59:55] much
[59:57] but he's telling timothy you're
[59:58] suffering reproach right
[1:00:00] because we trust in the living god he's
[1:00:02] the savior of all men especially
[1:00:04] of them that believe in other words
[1:00:08] he's able to save all men but especially
[1:00:11] those who believe
[1:00:12] are mainly those that believe right
[1:00:16] now verse 11 these things command and
[1:00:18] teach
[1:00:21] can you pull that up there these things
[1:00:22] command and teach that's verse
[1:00:26] 11. thanks lydia now what was the last
[1:00:29] time you heard your church friend say oh
[1:00:30] we got good commands at church today
[1:00:33] the preacher commanded me to do
[1:00:34] something now who would like who's ever
[1:00:36] said that
[1:00:38] right but paul says to timothy these
[1:00:40] things command and
[1:00:41] teach right
[1:00:45] oh that guy's uh he's on an ego trip
[1:00:48] he's given us commands
[1:00:50] no we're giving commands from the lord
[1:00:52] jesus christ we're giving
[1:00:53] we're giving ways to eternal life right
[1:00:55] we're giving wisdom
[1:00:56] to eternal life we're commanding the
[1:00:59] people of god to obey the word of god
[1:01:01] right commanding and teaching
[1:01:05] i'll say like this i've got a right to
[1:01:07] command the word of god
[1:01:08] as long as i live it amen hallelujah
[1:01:12] praise god
[1:01:13] that's why i've got the right i've got
[1:01:14] the right to command those brothers
[1:01:16] and our sisters if you can't handle a
[1:01:18] cell phone i've got the right to command
[1:01:20] you to give it up and get rid of it if
[1:01:21] you can't handle it
[1:01:23] because i'm living it i'm not a slave to
[1:01:25] it right i'm not
[1:01:26] i'm not addicted to these things like so
[1:01:28] many people are
[1:01:29] and they're trapped in sin i've got a
[1:01:31] right to command it because i never ask
[1:01:33] anybody to live higher or to do
[1:01:36] something that i'm not already doing
[1:01:37] praise
[1:01:38] god i've got a right to command
[1:01:41] people to obey the word of god if i'm
[1:01:43] obeying it
[1:01:46] because he said don't let no man despise
[1:01:47] your youth and i'm young
[1:01:51] at least according to paul
[1:01:54] that's right let no man despise thy
[1:01:56] youth
[1:01:58] that's verse 12. so we have to command
[1:02:02] and teach these things to live a sound
[1:02:05] doctrine write
[1:02:06] don't give heed to lies and uh doctrines
[1:02:09] of devils
[1:02:10] we must command people that's why i've
[1:02:13] commanded people
[1:02:15] uh don't mix with those jeffersonville
[1:02:17] people
[1:02:18] i've commanded people to do that but
[1:02:20] some of them didn't believe me
[1:02:22] right because that's a seducing spirit
[1:02:25] it's getting them in the spirit of
[1:02:27] idolatry
[1:02:29] and it breaks the word of god now i'm up
[1:02:31] to 10 false doctrines that i've been
[1:02:32] sharing with people they've got 10 false
[1:02:34] doctrines up to this point
[1:02:36] and when people actually hear the the
[1:02:39] the relatives of the prophet say some of
[1:02:40] those things they're blown away
[1:02:43] they are and it just keeps building went
[1:02:45] from seven eight nine now i've got ten
[1:02:49] that's a spirit that's a doctrine of a
[1:02:51] devil and i've got a right to command
[1:02:53] people to stay away from it
[1:02:56] right because they'll start worshipping
[1:02:57] a man instead of jesus christ
[1:02:59] okay now now here's where i want to get
[1:03:01] to after all those what was that
[1:03:03] 20 minutes i didn't mean to say that
[1:03:05] long on it verse 12
[1:03:07] let no man despise thy youth
[1:03:10] but be thou an example of the believers
[1:03:12] in word
[1:03:14] in conversation in charity in spirit
[1:03:17] in faith in purity now i'm going to get
[1:03:20] back to this scripture
[1:03:23] but paul tells timothy don't let anyone
[1:03:25] despise you because you're young
[1:03:28] see in those days it was very respectful
[1:03:30] to be an older person
[1:03:32] it's flipped right today most people no
[1:03:35] not amongst christians but amongst
[1:03:36] worldly people it's flip now the cool
[1:03:38] people are the young people
[1:03:41] right who's the most who's the most
[1:03:42] popular people on twitter oh it's the
[1:03:44] young
[1:03:45] female singers right
[1:03:48] or the handsome young guy who sings the
[1:03:50] new song
[1:03:51] like we're looking at the other week at
[1:03:53] the most youtube views ever and it was
[1:03:55] this spanish guy who sings about
[1:03:56] being desperate for love he's got like
[1:03:59] five billion views on one of his songs
[1:04:01] like that
[1:04:02] like what wisdom what good is that song
[1:04:04] ever doing anybody
[1:04:05] nothing it's just it's getting them
[1:04:07] probably stds and
[1:04:09] uh abortions and that's probably
[1:04:11] probably what it's doing right
[1:04:12] but that's what the world exalts and
[1:04:14] they probably did in that day too
[1:04:17] but paul says but real wisdom is found
[1:04:20] in
[1:04:21] in age if you're sincere
[1:04:24] remember they asked brother brown
[1:04:25] brother they said brother brown if you
[1:04:27] could live
[1:04:28] one of the quarters of a hundred years
[1:04:30] which one would it be zero to
[1:04:31] twenty-five
[1:04:32] lebron said if i was an athlete it'd be
[1:04:33] zero to twenty-five
[1:04:36] he said if i was a young parent be
[1:04:37] twenty-five to fifty
[1:04:39] he said but i would choose from 75 to
[1:04:42] 100.
[1:04:44] he said because i know more about it
[1:04:48] he said i'd be able to use my energy the
[1:04:50] right way i know more answers
[1:04:52] he said if i could choose any of those
[1:04:54] quarters you know 50 to 75
[1:04:56] uh 75 to 50 i'd choose 75 to 100 brother
[1:04:59] graham said that
[1:05:00] if i was guaranteed 25 years on this
[1:05:02] earth
[1:05:03] which years would i want the most from
[1:05:05] 75 to 100
[1:05:07] church most of us aren't even halfway
[1:05:09] there right
[1:05:11] that would be his choice because he said
[1:05:14] i no more i have the wisdom of god
[1:05:16] what's the one principle thing that we
[1:05:18] should seek in this life the wisdom of
[1:05:20] god amen
[1:05:23] but paul says don't let anyone even
[1:05:26] though you're not old
[1:05:27] don't let anyone despise your youth
[1:05:32] now verse 13 how you can do this so for
[1:05:35] our young people how we can do this and
[1:05:36] all of us right we're all young
[1:05:38] now of course this is for ministers
[1:05:39] right
[1:05:41] but the bible says we should all be
[1:05:42] followers of them who
[1:05:44] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:05:48] promises
[1:05:50] okay so verse 13 until i come you have
[1:05:52] attendance to reading
[1:05:55] now that's actually reading so church we
[1:05:57] need to be reading god the bible right
[1:05:59] and message books and you can read my
[1:06:01] book because i'm your pastor
[1:06:02] and the ones that come out hopefully
[1:06:04] soon i've heard from my guy for a while
[1:06:05] but
[1:06:06] read to exhortation exhortation means
[1:06:11] comfort or entreaty so comfort so
[1:06:16] read a lot comfort people and then
[1:06:18] doctrine instruction
[1:06:21] so how can you be an example to someone
[1:06:23] the bible says read a lot
[1:06:26] glad we got some readers in here
[1:06:31] exhort comfort people so in other words
[1:06:33] look for people who are hurting
[1:06:35] and try to minister to them like we said
[1:06:36] on sunday right minister to someone
[1:06:40] and then doctrine now this is for
[1:06:42] preachers of course but we are we should
[1:06:43] all be interested in doctrine
[1:06:44] instruction now verse 14 now church this
[1:06:47] applies to everybody
[1:06:49] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[1:06:50] because jesus said everybody's got at
[1:06:52] least one talent amen
[1:06:55] some two some five
[1:06:58] so even though this is spoken to a
[1:07:00] preacher everybody can do something here
[1:07:03] so this is the way to be an example
[1:07:07] focus on your gift don't ignore your
[1:07:08] gift but focus on your gift
[1:07:10] listen to what people have said well i
[1:07:12] really enjoyed how you do this or why i
[1:07:13] really
[1:07:14] felt god when you did this and oh my i
[1:07:16] was really blessed when you did this or
[1:07:17] did that
[1:07:18] look and see how god has gifted you and
[1:07:21] don't avoid that
[1:07:22] but devote yourself to it right like how
[1:07:26] did
[1:07:26] anna how did anna the prophetess
[1:07:28] eventually see
[1:07:29] jesus you know the baby the bible said
[1:07:31] she prayed and fasted
[1:07:33] and then she saw the she saw the
[1:07:35] prophecy of jesus come to pass
[1:07:37] so see she was devoted she didn't
[1:07:39] neglect her gift she prayed and fasted
[1:07:41] and ministered to the lord
[1:07:43] and prayed in the temple praise god
[1:07:46] hallelujah so that's how you do it you
[1:07:48] just got to focus on that
[1:07:50] and and consecrate your body right
[1:07:52] consecrate your mind
[1:07:54] focus on reading and and studying the
[1:07:56] word of god and loving god worshiping
[1:07:58] god
[1:07:58] and being fasting praying and then god
[1:08:02] will bless your talents
[1:08:03] because that's what the bible says which
[1:08:05] was given me by the prophecy
[1:08:07] with the laying on the hands of the
[1:08:10] presbyter
[1:08:11] presbytery so no doubt timothy you know
[1:08:14] they were they must have been laying the
[1:08:15] hands on timothy and some people
[1:08:17] prophesied and said thus saith the lord
[1:08:18] you've got a gift of teaching or
[1:08:20] you've got a gift to be a pastor because
[1:08:21] he was a pastor this time in ephesus
[1:08:23] thus saith the lord you're going to be
[1:08:24] the pastor in ephesus you know he had
[1:08:26] so paul reminds him you've got prophecy
[1:08:28] over your life
[1:08:30] but just because you got prophecy
[1:08:31] doesn't mean you can sit back and be
[1:08:33] lazy
[1:08:34] you've got to you've got to focus on
[1:08:36] that gift and give yourself completely
[1:08:38] to it praise god
[1:08:40] you're a young man don't waste those
[1:08:42] young years use those years focused on
[1:08:44] what god has placed in your life amen
[1:08:51] verse 15 meditate upon these things so
[1:08:53] think about all
[1:08:55] the things god has placed in your life
[1:08:57] meditate
[1:08:58] upon them meditate that's our memory
[1:09:00] verse for this month right
[1:09:01] it means revolve in your mind revolve it
[1:09:05] in your mind
[1:09:05] over and over go over that again
[1:09:09] give thyself holy to them
[1:09:12] so how many want to make the most of
[1:09:14] your youth
[1:09:16] find out what god has blessed your life
[1:09:19] with like sister you might have divine
[1:09:20] healing because remember when you prayed
[1:09:21] for your uh your hubby there
[1:09:23] and god anointed you and you so the
[1:09:26] testimony was
[1:09:27] amen woke up sick right and you just
[1:09:29] laid your hand
[1:09:30] on him and your your hand went numb
[1:09:32] right your arm went numb is that right
[1:09:34] is that about right
[1:09:39] in a dream that's right
[1:09:43] did did he feel the numbness or did you
[1:09:45] feel it i felt it whether his brother
[1:09:47] amen said he was instantly healed that
[1:09:49] might be a gift of uh healing in your
[1:09:51] life
[1:09:54] and so that's just i just kind of came
[1:09:56] to me because i was looking at you you
[1:09:56] know
[1:09:57] i'm just trying to think of the things
[1:09:59] give yourself holy to them in other
[1:10:01] words uh
[1:10:02] just say lord if you want to if you want
[1:10:03] me to pray for somebody
[1:10:05] here i'm i'm going to focus on that i'm
[1:10:07] going to remember the scriptures
[1:10:09] i'm going to i'm going to build up faith
[1:10:11] in case someone needs prayer today
[1:10:12] praise god
[1:10:14] see that your profiting may appear to
[1:10:17] all because we can all see how
[1:10:20] the saints have grown in our
[1:10:22] congregation right
[1:10:24] we talk about that our family talks
[1:10:25] about all the time we've seen growth in
[1:10:26] our sisters and
[1:10:27] and the saints all the saints that come
[1:10:29] faithfully we've seen growth in their
[1:10:30] lives
[1:10:32] right i hope you've seen it in my life
[1:10:34] if not something's wrong but i believe
[1:10:36] i've grown
[1:10:36] i just don't think about it very much
[1:10:38] but see we meditate we give ourselves
[1:10:40] and then everybody sees the prophet on
[1:10:44] your life
[1:10:45] or the advancement is a better word
[1:10:48] everybody sees you advance
[1:10:49] in faith amen everybody sees you advance
[1:10:53] in faith in entrusting god and
[1:10:56] confidence in the word of god amen
[1:10:58] not getting weaker not falling back but
[1:11:00] raising higher amen
[1:11:04] going from glory to a higher glory amen
[1:11:08] going from a faith to a higher faith
[1:11:11] praise god amen
[1:11:14] that's how you do it you focus on what
[1:11:17] you know god has placed in your life
[1:11:18] you focus on that read on that devote
[1:11:21] yourself to that and then
[1:11:22] everybody will see when god blesses your
[1:11:24] life everybody will see that
[1:11:28] verse 16 take keen unto thyself
[1:11:31] and unto the doctrine that's what uh
[1:11:34] what a recommendation
[1:11:35] take heed to yourself what's he mean it
[1:11:38] means to
[1:11:39] retain it means to mark
[1:11:42] mark yourself and unto the under look at
[1:11:45] your life and mark how you've been doing
[1:11:47] right take a real
[1:11:48] inventory of your life what kind of
[1:11:50] christian am i living what kind of life
[1:11:52] am i living
[1:11:53] mark it look at it examine yourself
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:57] and and also mark the doctrine continue
[1:12:01] in them
[1:12:01] for in doing this thou shalt both save
[1:12:04] yourself
[1:12:05] and them that hear thee
[1:12:08] okay so a preacher if he meditates upon
[1:12:11] the word and gives people instruction
[1:12:14] and tells him what to do and if he
[1:12:16] meditates on that and keeps revolving
[1:12:18] around that
[1:12:19] meditating on that then that will lead
[1:12:21] to his salvation
[1:12:22] and the salvation of those that are
[1:12:25] listening to him amen
[1:12:26] church i hope one day i can stand before
[1:12:28] jesus and as a pastor
[1:12:30] i can present the whole church that all
[1:12:32] these souls were saved
[1:12:33] because i preached christ's word amen
[1:12:36] that's my desire
[1:12:37] and not because of me but the bible says
[1:12:39] the preacher is connected to the ones
[1:12:41] he's preaching to
[1:12:43] amen not only is he saved but the people
[1:12:46] are saying
[1:12:47] amen oh that's my greatest desire praise
[1:12:49] god
[1:12:50] is that i be saved and then those that
[1:12:52] hear me are saved
[1:12:54] by preaching the acceptable words of the
[1:12:56] lord amen
[1:12:57] hallelujah how do you do that you
[1:13:00] meditate on the word
[1:13:01] you just you totally focus on the word
[1:13:04] of god give yourself completely to the
[1:13:06] word of god
[1:13:07] that's what i've tried to do praise god
[1:13:09] i tried to give myself completely to the
[1:13:11] word of the lord
[1:13:14] okay so now in this context let's just
[1:13:17] take a few minutes
[1:13:18] here and i'll come back to it in just a
[1:13:19] moment
[1:13:23] i want to uh yeah i also want to
[1:13:27] advise uh just with a few scripture now
[1:13:30] go to
[1:13:31] second timothy 2 19. let's go there
[1:13:34] ii timothy 2 19.
[1:13:40] let me just give a little word of uh
[1:13:43] advice
[1:13:43] here we say i'm sorry not vice word of
[1:13:46] wisdom rather
[1:13:47] from paul to timothy second timothy 2
[1:13:51] 19.
[1:13:58] uh nevertheless the foundation of god
[1:14:00] standeth sure having this seal the lord
[1:14:02] knoweth them that are his
[1:14:03] let everyone that name at the name of
[1:14:04] christ depart from iniquity
[1:14:07] okay so that's young and old right
[1:14:09] anyone who's names christ
[1:14:10] should depart from iniquity which is
[1:14:13] knowledgeable sinner
[1:14:14] sin that you're aware of anything that
[1:14:15] you're aware of any sin you should leave
[1:14:18] it
[1:14:20] verse 20. but in the great house there
[1:14:21] are not only vessels of gold and of
[1:14:23] silver
[1:14:24] and of wood and of earth are some of
[1:14:25] honor and some of the dishonor let me
[1:14:26] stop right there see people will
[1:14:28] uh these people that leave the message
[1:14:30] i've been listening to some of them
[1:14:31] their podcasts
[1:14:33] they say that message people make
[1:14:34] themselves an elite group
[1:14:36] right they're in other words they're
[1:14:38] prideful and exalting themselves let me
[1:14:40] say this some people may do
[1:14:41] but a real christian who's filled with
[1:14:43] the holy ghost with the power of god
[1:14:45] in real humility is an elite person
[1:14:49] just because gold is more elite than
[1:14:51] silver
[1:14:54] so a real christian doesn't exalt
[1:14:56] himself it's god exalting him praise god
[1:14:59] or her praise god hallelujah because we
[1:15:02] can never exalt ourselves
[1:15:04] in fact all we can do is humble
[1:15:06] ourselves amen
[1:15:07] and then when we humble ourselves god
[1:15:09] exalts us praise god
[1:15:11] remember jesus said many will find the
[1:15:13] way to life
[1:15:15] no few will find the way so there is an
[1:15:17] elite group
[1:15:18] of christians a few that find that
[1:15:21] narrow road and they are gold quality
[1:15:24] yes sir there are elite christians today
[1:15:26] praise god
[1:15:28] not by their own calling or their own
[1:15:30] proclamation but by god's word
[1:15:35] so see these people that leave the
[1:15:37] message they they bash message people
[1:15:39] but the reality is
[1:15:40] the ones that are sincere they are an
[1:15:42] elite group of christians because they
[1:15:43] keep all the word of god
[1:15:51] so you know i'm not done with that yeah
[1:15:52] i'm done there now go to verse 22. here
[1:15:54] it is
[1:15:54] flee also loose i'm sorry youthful lust
[1:15:59] so see you know there's going to be lust
[1:16:01] when you're younger they're more
[1:16:02] attractive when you're younger
[1:16:05] like music and parties and not for us
[1:16:08] video games videos you know what are the
[1:16:11] youth like video
[1:16:13] you have to flee the youthful lusts
[1:16:16] drugs and feelings and popularity right
[1:16:20] when you're younger those things matter
[1:16:22] like i can remember going back to high
[1:16:24] school
[1:16:24] i just wanted everybody to like me so i
[1:16:26] do i do a lot of sinful things just for
[1:16:28] people to like me
[1:16:29] but now i could care less what people
[1:16:30] say i gotta
[1:16:32] care less what my co-worker across the
[1:16:34] hallway says i don't care what they say
[1:16:35] i don't care what they do
[1:16:36] like i don't mean nothing to me i don't
[1:16:38] feel any pressure about what they're
[1:16:40] you know that doesn't mean nothing to me
[1:16:43] like if
[1:16:43] if some of the teachers want to do that
[1:16:44] that doesn't mean nothing i'm not going
[1:16:46] to do that that
[1:16:47] doesn't bother me at all i don't care to
[1:16:49] be singled out because i know who i'm
[1:16:50] standing with i'm standing with christ
[1:16:52] praise god
[1:16:53] they're separating their self from
[1:16:54] christ i'm joining myself to christ amen
[1:16:57] i'd rather stand with jesus than the
[1:16:59] whole world praise god so see it's it's
[1:17:02] a
[1:17:03] it's a as i get older those things mean
[1:17:05] less to me i don't care what i'm
[1:17:07] i don't care what any church thinks of
[1:17:08] me or a preacher thinks to me all i care
[1:17:10] is what jesus thinks of me amen
[1:17:12] praise god now but follow righteousness
[1:17:15] faith charity peace with them that call
[1:17:17] on the lord out of a
[1:17:19] pure heart so young people need to find
[1:17:23] people that are pure in heart and then
[1:17:25] they need to follow the pure in heart
[1:17:29] those that are following pure things
[1:17:34] okay so he just gives that uh he just
[1:17:36] gives that great advice there
[1:17:38] verse 23 but the foolish and unlearned
[1:17:40] questions avoid
[1:17:41] knowing that they do gender strifes
[1:17:46] verse 24 the servant of the lord must
[1:17:48] not strive
[1:17:50] but be gentle unto all men apt to teach
[1:17:53] and patient when you see a preacher he
[1:17:55] just wants to fight and bicker and argue
[1:17:56] and fuss all the time
[1:17:58] he's probably got he's probably got a
[1:17:59] complex or he's not born again
[1:18:02] right because even when we disagree we
[1:18:03] can be gentle
[1:18:05] right
[1:18:08] so i just want to give that advice that
[1:18:10] as a young person
[1:18:12] it's best to flee unless you've got a
[1:18:15] strong anointing to stand there in the
[1:18:17] face of a
[1:18:18] youthful lust or a temptation unless you
[1:18:20] have that strong anointing where god you
[1:18:22] know god's there
[1:18:23] you should just walk away like joseph
[1:18:26] remember potiphar's wife's tugging on
[1:18:28] him said oh
[1:18:29] lie with me every day lie with me like
[1:18:31] what'd he do he just ran away
[1:18:34] right that didn't mean he was weak that
[1:18:35] showed he was strong praise god
[1:18:38] see flee the youthful lusts
[1:18:41] that shows you're strong when you're
[1:18:43] able when it's right there presented
[1:18:45] before you but you're able to turn the
[1:18:46] devil down
[1:18:48] and leave the devil right amen leave
[1:18:51] that situation get out of the situation
[1:18:53] that shows more power praise god
[1:18:56] hallelujah
[1:19:05] i was just looking at a few my notes
[1:19:06] here like i didn't have them all
[1:19:07] organized like i like to
[1:19:12] okay so uh i'm going to try to close in
[1:19:14] just a few minutes here but let me close
[1:19:15] with a few thoughts
[1:19:16] remember church god can use many young
[1:19:18] people
[1:19:20] anyone who surrendered to him samuel was
[1:19:23] just
[1:19:23] he just got done nursing and god
[1:19:26] uses him by speaking to him there at the
[1:19:29] house of the lord
[1:19:31] right and he had to use a young man
[1:19:35] samuel because the old men
[1:19:38] were committing adultery the priests
[1:19:39] were committing adultery the two sons of
[1:19:41] eli
[1:19:43] and then eli was letting it go on
[1:19:47] he was an old dodie grandpa he just let
[1:19:50] the kids sin do whatever they want
[1:19:52] and he was getting big and large he was
[1:19:54] he wasn't taking care of his body right
[1:19:56] then the bible just say that right you
[1:19:59] gotta you gotta exercise yourself to
[1:20:01] godliness right
[1:20:02] it's not godly to become overweight it's
[1:20:04] not it's not golly
[1:20:05] to become addicted to food hello that's
[1:20:08] still a devil right it's still a devil
[1:20:10] a food addiction that's a devil
[1:20:13] so god had to use a young man
[1:20:16] and speak to him through the holy spirit
[1:20:20] and even give him words of correction
[1:20:24] so much so remember that eli come up and
[1:20:26] said samuel
[1:20:27] tell me what the lord told you what did
[1:20:29] samuel do he told him
[1:20:30] look at that a young young boy wouldn't
[1:20:33] hold back on an old preacher
[1:20:37] now that's a good example of let no man
[1:20:39] despise your youth
[1:20:41] samuel was in such a condition even as a
[1:20:43] young child god could speak to him and
[1:20:45] give him words of correction for the
[1:20:47] older generation
[1:20:49] and he was still able to do it with
[1:20:50] grace
[1:20:52] may god help our young people to be like
[1:20:54] that where they're so dedicated even at
[1:20:56] a young age
[1:20:57] god can give a word god can give a dream
[1:20:59] god can give a
[1:21:00] a doctrine a revelation that it can be
[1:21:04] taught to other people
[1:21:07] praise god
[1:21:11] what a good example how about that uh
[1:21:12] little jewish maid that was a slave of
[1:21:15] naaman
[1:21:16] we like that uh we like the audio drama
[1:21:20] about that
[1:21:21] uh there's a little audio drama where
[1:21:24] a girl wants to be like that little maid
[1:21:27] but look at that
[1:21:28] she's a slave right to a heathen king
[1:21:33] but even as a young girl she's able to
[1:21:35] look past even though being mistreated
[1:21:37] being a slave she's able to say naaman i
[1:21:40] know a prophet and he might give you
[1:21:42] might get healed by going to that
[1:21:44] prophet
[1:21:45] a little girl is going to point a grown
[1:21:47] man
[1:21:48] to his healing praise god amen
[1:21:51] hallelujah
[1:21:52] a little child might be able to appoint
[1:21:54] us to repentance amen
[1:21:57] or forgiveness right or some
[1:22:01] some spiritual trait we might be lacking
[1:22:03] we might
[1:22:04] be humbled by a little child speaking
[1:22:07] the word of god and it makes us want to
[1:22:09] live that way
[1:22:11] that's what god used in that day for a
[1:22:13] man the center is
[1:22:14] not a centurion but he was a general and
[1:22:17] he was able to get
[1:22:18] healed from leprosy all because of a
[1:22:19] little girl
[1:22:21] god speaking through a little girl right
[1:22:24] we want to be vessels where god can
[1:22:25] speak through us right
[1:22:26] and people can be healed people can be
[1:22:28] helped
[1:22:30] right david was such a obedient young
[1:22:33] young man there
[1:22:36] he could write songs and praise god now
[1:22:39] shepherding is not a very
[1:22:42] it's not a very high calling right all
[1:22:44] his brothers are at the war but he's out
[1:22:45] there with the sheep
[1:22:47] they're out there you know trying to get
[1:22:48] victories and they got shield and armor
[1:22:51] and david's just got a sling and a staff
[1:22:53] that's all he's got
[1:22:55] he's got sheep to feed and he gets to
[1:22:57] pet him and he gets to feed him and
[1:22:59] he gets to hold him and but but then god
[1:23:02] gives him some great victories right he
[1:23:03] gets to fight a lion and a bear praise
[1:23:05] god
[1:23:06] you get to experience the power of god
[1:23:10] and then god gets to use him to destroy
[1:23:13] uh goliath right as a young man
[1:23:17] in other words god was telling him let
[1:23:19] no man despise your youth amen
[1:23:22] but be the example of the believers
[1:23:24] remember when he went into the camp his
[1:23:26] question was
[1:23:27] his question wasn't how great is goliath
[1:23:30] his question was
[1:23:32] what does the person get who slays this
[1:23:34] guy amen
[1:23:36] that's the example praise god right
[1:23:39] here's an example
[1:23:41] he was thinking about what does the what
[1:23:42] can i get if i have faith and defeat
[1:23:45] this
[1:23:45] fella in other words i'm i'm an
[1:23:48] overcomer
[1:23:49] i've already seen god save me from great
[1:23:51] enemies
[1:23:52] god can use me to deliver the nation of
[1:23:55] israel praise god
[1:23:56] i face very fierce people or very fierce
[1:23:59] enemies just like goliath he was
[1:24:02] thinking about the victories
[1:24:03] not about failures praise god see he
[1:24:06] just meditated on the songs of god right
[1:24:09] and the songs encouraged him right
[1:24:11] he just sang songs and played the harp
[1:24:13] and he was always in the presence of the
[1:24:15] lord he meditated on those things
[1:24:17] so he came in ready for battle praise
[1:24:19] god well everybody else was afraid
[1:24:21] and fearful and discouraged david was
[1:24:23] encouraged david was ready to overcome
[1:24:25] even as a teenager praise god ah
[1:24:29] that's striking there's 45 minutes i'm
[1:24:31] gonna try to close here
[1:24:35] david did that and then the people
[1:24:39] started singing david has killed his
[1:24:40] ten thousands and all he done was killed
[1:24:43] goliath
[1:24:45] right he might have killed a bear in a
[1:24:46] lion but not
[1:24:48] probably not ten thousand lions right
[1:24:51] but his faith was so intense right it
[1:24:54] was he was so devoted to god he had such
[1:24:56] a conviction
[1:24:57] that they attributed to him many great
[1:24:59] victories
[1:25:01] but this is an example of a young person
[1:25:04] praise god
[1:25:06] now we already went through joseph right
[1:25:09] but we never see joseph complaining even
[1:25:11] though he's thrown in the pit
[1:25:13] even though he's sold in uh you know
[1:25:16] uh to potiphar's house he never he never
[1:25:19] gave up he just kept
[1:25:20] doing his best work he kept faithfully
[1:25:22] serving god all those days right
[1:25:24] and then god raised him up he went down
[1:25:25] to the prison we never see him given up
[1:25:27] he was an example there church that's a
[1:25:29] great example right there
[1:25:30] be an example no matter where you are
[1:25:33] no matter how god how high god takes you
[1:25:36] or how low god takes you
[1:25:38] always be an example of living a
[1:25:40] righteous life
[1:25:41] we never find joseph giving in to
[1:25:44] depression or giving in to
[1:25:45] living a defeated life but he always was
[1:25:48] an example
[1:25:49] and god blessed his hands in everything
[1:25:51] that he touched
[1:25:52] praise god he was an example
[1:25:57] praise god
[1:26:02] look at mary a little teenage virgin
[1:26:04] girl
[1:26:06] and of all the people god could have
[1:26:07] chose uh
[1:26:09] to do a virgin birth by overshadowing of
[1:26:11] the holy ghost he chose mary
[1:26:14] right and now what is her what is her
[1:26:16] great attribute pondering
[1:26:18] the things of god because even after the
[1:26:20] angels spoke these things she still had
[1:26:21] to
[1:26:22] the bible said she kept them in her
[1:26:23] heart which means we can choose to keep
[1:26:25] the word in our hearts or we can choose
[1:26:27] not to keep the word in our hearts
[1:26:29] so we want to choose to keep the word in
[1:26:31] our heart the bible said she kept these
[1:26:33] things right
[1:26:34] she pondered them in her heart
[1:26:37] all the things the lord has spoken to me
[1:26:39] i'm going to keep thinking about that
[1:26:41] right all those things uh like
[1:26:45] any fresh thought you have you should
[1:26:46] keep that and ponder that in your heart
[1:26:49] like i've been thinking about a lot
[1:26:50] about how i'm strong and very courageous
[1:26:52] right like joshua
[1:26:53] i've been keeping that in my heart i'm
[1:26:56] taking land
[1:26:57] i'm not getting defeated i'm an
[1:26:59] overcomer praise god
[1:27:02] god's going to do more miracles in my
[1:27:04] ministry
[1:27:05] like i'm taking more land praise god i'm
[1:27:08] not being defeated i'm not falling back
[1:27:11] i'm pressing on into the things of god
[1:27:13] praise god
[1:27:15] i'm strong and very courageous right
[1:27:19] that's what god called me to be so we
[1:27:22] meditate on those things and remember
[1:27:24] we're the joshua army praise god
[1:27:26] we're a we're a new love praise god
[1:27:28] we're not an old love
[1:27:30] we're a new love hallelujah i'm going to
[1:27:32] get back into last sunday's message
[1:27:34] right we're not an old sinful church
[1:27:37] we're a new church we're a blood wash
[1:27:39] church amen we're an
[1:27:41] on fire church we have to remember what
[1:27:43] god said about us amen
[1:27:45] and live that amen live it
[1:27:50] see meditate on those things like mary
[1:27:52] kept thinking about it kept thinking
[1:27:53] about it
[1:27:55] and then the hebrew children they had no
[1:27:57] revelation that god was going to
[1:27:59] step with step in the fire with them god
[1:28:01] didn't tell them in advance hey i'm
[1:28:03] gonna save you from the fire
[1:28:05] they said all we know whether god saves
[1:28:07] us or not we have no revelation
[1:28:09] our only revelation is i'll not bow down
[1:28:12] i'll not become a worshiper of a man
[1:28:14] i'll only worship jehovah that's how we
[1:28:17] are
[1:28:17] church we may not know the revelation of
[1:28:19] that no man knows the revelation
[1:28:21] of the day and the hour but we we don't
[1:28:23] know if god will let us
[1:28:25] die and go to the grave or not i don't
[1:28:27] know if i'll preach some of your
[1:28:28] funerals or not or someone else will
[1:28:29] preach my funeral
[1:28:30] i don't know what god will do but will
[1:28:32] not give in to sin
[1:28:34] will not give into this laoceian world
[1:28:36] will obey god's word only amen
[1:28:39] hallelujah however many days we have how
[1:28:41] many ever years god gives us
[1:28:43] we're going to give our youth we'll give
[1:28:45] our middle age give our old age
[1:28:47] we'll give everything we have to jesus
[1:28:49] christ
[1:28:54] i like those three hebrew children they
[1:28:55] had no revelation
[1:28:58] if there was going to be a miracle or
[1:28:59] not but all's they knew
[1:29:01] they had a revelation that i am not to
[1:29:03] bow down to idols
[1:29:05] what does that show us live whatever
[1:29:07] revelation you have just live as high
[1:29:09] as the revelation that god gives you and
[1:29:12] he'll show up in great ways in your life
[1:29:14] praise god amen
[1:29:16] hallelujah
[1:29:22] now
[1:29:25] now i want to find that scripture real
[1:29:26] quick when i became a man i put away
[1:29:27] childish things was that
[1:29:30] first corinthians 13.
[1:29:34] yeah first corinthians 13 11. he put
[1:29:35] that up there real quick i'm almost done
[1:29:38] that was my 10 minutes so i'm going over
[1:29:40] my 45 now i'm going over my 55 so
[1:29:42] forgive me
[1:29:46] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:29:49] understood as a child i thought as a
[1:29:50] child but when i became a man i put
[1:29:52] childish things away
[1:29:54] this is speaking of love so if you've
[1:29:56] got the love of god right
[1:29:57] charity this is charity so when you've
[1:30:00] got the love of god you put away
[1:30:02] childish things that
[1:30:06] that doesn't mean you don't play with
[1:30:07] your little brothers and sisters
[1:30:09] right that's not what that means
[1:30:14] it means when you have a choice of
[1:30:16] mature things or childish things
[1:30:19] do you play angry birds or do you read
[1:30:20] your bible right
[1:30:23] hopefully my children shouldn't have
[1:30:24] angry birds on their phones or tablets
[1:30:26] if so
[1:30:27] if not i'm going to come and delete it
[1:30:29] but
[1:30:30] when i became a man when i became full
[1:30:32] of charity and divine love
[1:30:34] i put away frivolous things
[1:30:41] right go to the next verse first 12. can
[1:30:43] you go to verse 2.
[1:30:47] now we see through as a glass darkly but
[1:30:49] then face to face in other words
[1:30:51] i put away childish things because i
[1:30:53] know one day i'm gonna see jesus face to
[1:30:55] face
[1:30:56] he said i see things darkly now right
[1:31:00] now look even as a sold out christian
[1:31:03] things aren't always
[1:31:04] absolutely clear he says we see through
[1:31:06] a glass and it's kind of dark
[1:31:08] there's some things that are still a
[1:31:09] little bit you know like we're not sure
[1:31:12] about the squeeze right right we're not
[1:31:14] sure exactly what's going to happen are
[1:31:16] we going to be hunted down or not
[1:31:17] totally
[1:31:18] so we see through a glass but darkly
[1:31:21] right but he said i became a mature
[1:31:24] christian
[1:31:25] when i put away childish things and i
[1:31:27] began focusing on the most important
[1:31:29] things in life
[1:31:30] christianity christian principles godly
[1:31:33] living praise god
[1:31:35] i put away childish things
[1:31:39] so you can still be a child and have fun
[1:31:41] right and have fun with your friends
[1:31:44] but then also be mature a mature
[1:31:46] christian as well
[1:31:48] you guys ever see that picture of
[1:31:49] brother branham there's a picture of
[1:31:51] brother branham and he's out hunting and
[1:31:52] he has this
[1:31:53] coffee pot and he's going like this
[1:31:56] and they got a picture of him doing that
[1:31:57] he was making a joke
[1:31:59] so he could let off the pressure a
[1:32:01] little bit there's videos where they got
[1:32:02] him and his son they're kind of
[1:32:04] playing with each other's hat and him
[1:32:06] and billy paul pretending like they're
[1:32:07] boxing you know they
[1:32:10] you know we become a man you put away
[1:32:12] childish things but you can still laugh
[1:32:14] a little bit and have to have some jokes
[1:32:16] you know
[1:32:17] but when you have a choice between this
[1:32:19] is my time to grow am i going to
[1:32:20] choose this could be my time to to to
[1:32:24] wholly give myself to the word or am i
[1:32:26] just going to kind of waste my time in
[1:32:27] things that don't really matter
[1:32:29] well you've got to you got to realize
[1:32:31] that when you're young you got to devote
[1:32:32] that to the lord
[1:32:35] right there's times for that
[1:32:38] and as you grow as a christian you grow
[1:32:40] up more into those
[1:32:41] more mature things the holy things of
[1:32:43] god
[1:32:45] and you know why you do it because the
[1:32:46] bible says when you exercise yourself in
[1:32:48] that
[1:32:49] now you see the blessings now right
[1:32:52] you see blessings now plus you got
[1:32:54] blessings of things to come
[1:32:56] all right i'm closing with this now i'm
[1:32:58] really gonna try to close here
[1:33:00] i know you all love me i appreciate that
[1:33:03] first timothy 4 12. let's go back there
[1:33:06] i want to challenge our young people
[1:33:08] are you the example of all of these six
[1:33:12] attributes that's how i'm gonna
[1:33:13] challenge young people i kind of feel
[1:33:14] led to finish on this
[1:33:16] scripture in other words if i said i
[1:33:20] want to find an example
[1:33:23] of someone who speaks the word
[1:33:26] or says the right words
[1:33:32] yeah just this is just words speaking
[1:33:34] the word
[1:33:35] so your common words i want to find an
[1:33:37] example who could i find that
[1:33:39] they just say all the right things
[1:33:41] they're just real humble and
[1:33:43] their words are seasoned with grace i
[1:33:45] wonder who that example is
[1:33:48] which young person is it
[1:33:51] praise god because that's what he says
[1:33:53] he says you be an example
[1:33:56] don't let anybody despise you just
[1:33:57] because you're young doesn't mean you
[1:33:58] can't say the right things and say
[1:34:00] spiritual things
[1:34:02] not that you're trying to impress people
[1:34:03] but you do it out of the love of god in
[1:34:05] your heart
[1:34:06] in other words you don't want to say
[1:34:07] foolish words you don't want to
[1:34:11] uh you don't want to weaken people's
[1:34:12] faith you want to build people's faith
[1:34:14] up
[1:34:16] so are you the example young person are

[1:34:24] put your name young person

[1:34:29] lydia acacia malcolm haven
[1:34:34] they're the example of saying the right
[1:34:36] word
[1:34:37] because that's what paul is saying be an
[1:34:39] example timothy
[1:34:45] next in conversation conversation just
[1:34:48] means your behavior
[1:34:50] wow the best behave the best behaved
[1:34:52] people i saw at the church were

[1:35:02] don't wait for other people to do it you
[1:35:04] be the good example
[1:35:06] you behave like a real christian ought
[1:35:08] to
[1:35:09] remember how do you get there church you
[1:35:11] gotta give yourself to reading

[1:35:52] showing affection amongst the young
[1:35:54] people
[1:35:55] who really let you know that you're
[1:35:57] loved
[1:36:00] should be should be a real christian
[1:36:02] right all christians will be like that
[1:36:03] but paul challenges timothy you be the
[1:36:06] example preacher
[1:36:08] you let everybody feel your affection
[1:36:09] tell them how much you love them and why
[1:36:11] you love them
[1:36:12] thank them for what they do right show
[1:36:15] them
[1:36:16] anybody can say it but you got to act on
[1:36:18] it praise god
[1:36:22] in spirit now spirit means
[1:36:26] your disposition right so if you're down
[1:36:29] in the dumps

[1:37:05] the word of god says
[1:37:06] you're an example of trust in god
[1:37:10] so when you get bad news instead of
[1:37:13] screaming and worrying about it you say
[1:37:14] well lord the lord's going to make a way
[1:37:16] somehow

[1:41:36] know there's a lot of older preachers
[1:41:37] and people really look up to them
[1:41:39] that's great but that doesn't mean that

[1:41:46] not me challenging you it's
[1:41:48] paul challenging you don't let people
