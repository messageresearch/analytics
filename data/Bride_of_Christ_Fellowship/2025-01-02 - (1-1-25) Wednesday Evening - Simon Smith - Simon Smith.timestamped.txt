[0:00] and worshiping the Lord God knows I need
[0:02] that
[0:04] help uh I I'm just going to be honest
[0:06] here a little bit here which I mean uh
[0:08] being I say gu transparent uh I've been
[0:12] singing the Praises of the Lord since uh
[0:14] literally became a Christian in 20 the
[0:17] spring of 2000 and I still cannot
[0:19] remember a lot of these songs I
[0:21] literally need I need a book or I need
[0:23] these uh the words putting up there I
[0:25] don't know why uh for those of you who
[0:27] know my
[0:28] mother and how my wife uh uh got to see
[0:33] some things last night we took my mom
[0:35] out to e for the New Year's there to and
[0:37] she just forgets this forgets that I'm
[0:39] like man Lord I know where it comes
[0:42] from I just we're just believing that
[0:45] maybe God will uh deliver me there with
[0:48] my dad's memory my dad has a really good
[0:49] memory uh brother Jesse's got a
[0:51] phenomenal memory brother Cam's got a
[0:52] memory uh I think all my brothers and
[0:55] sisters got memories but uh I'm I'm
[0:57] asking the Lord to bring maybe 2025 will
[1:00] the year of the memory for me amen I'd
[1:02] like to write that on my uh testimony
[1:04] list here so uh let's read a scripture
[1:06] here and then we will uh be seated in
[1:11] Matthew uh
[1:13] 26 let me get there myself by God's
[1:21] grace I don't have a lot tonight but
[1:24] we'll see how the Lord uses it thanks
[1:27] God every every time I get behind a
[1:29] Pulpit I say Lord God I want to yield
[1:31] more I want to let you speak and I want
[1:34] the things that you want me to say to
[1:36] come to my heart and then I can Usher
[1:38] them out and Lord God the things you
[1:39] don't want me to say Lord God give me
[1:41] that little check uh you know when uh
[1:44] brother B was preaching that seventh
[1:45] seal he got to a certain point it was in
[1:47] paragraph 261 he says go no further stop
[1:52] here and what he do he continued
[1:54] on he felt a check right there he says
[1:56] look I've got it written down he's a go
[1:58] no he stop right here but he continued
[1:59] on and the Holy Ghost made him record
[2:01] that very ending part of that so uh I
[2:05] want the Lord to stop me when I'm
[2:06] supposed to not say things and and of
[2:08] course may he utter things out when he
[2:10] needs to do them so in Matthew 26 verse
[2:13] uh let's jump to verse

[2:20] standing he says and as they were

[2:28] and break it
[2:30] and gave it to the disciples and said
[2:32] take eat this is my
[2:35] body and he took the cup and gave thanks
[2:38] and gave it to them saying drink ye all
[2:42] of it for this is the blood of the new
[2:45] testament which is shed for many for the
[2:47] remission of
[2:48] sins but I say unto you I will not drink

[5:45] maybe I not even ask her to do or
[5:47] however but it really some things uh
[5:49] especially really really please me I'll
[5:51] say like this tonight my wife drove me
[5:54] all the way from home to here while I
[5:55] was
[5:56] studying we had a read a long I've been
[5:59] having a long three weeks of uh uh
[6:02] ministering teaching and preaching and
[6:06] uh then we do obviously working through
[6:08] the day physical labor and then we do
[6:11] little side jobs helped a brother this
[6:13] morning with his sub pump his sub pump
[6:15] went out his basement was full eight
[6:16] inches of water to the rescue right
[6:19] that's what plumbers do we're always on
[6:21] call so uh we're tired and I tried to
[6:24] get back to study in time and I really
[6:26] didn't get a thought and then about 5:07
[6:28] I told my wife I I finally got a thought
[6:30] and then here we are she Faithfully
[6:32] drove God bless you my
[6:34] love I thank the Lord for her uh she's

[6:40] um you're amazed that the Lord has
[6:43] someone that can actually handle

[6:52] wife that God would continue to give her

[7:10] give you the very thought the lord gave
[7:12] me saints of God it's the new year it's
[7:15] it's this time where we start we reflect
[7:17] what does this what what does this time
[7:18] usually do to us it gives us a time to
[7:21] reflect back in what God has done in our
[7:23] lives where we've been before where we
[7:26] want to go you know they say um
[7:28] businessmen and people who want to
[7:30] accomplish great things they always said
[7:32] he said you've got to have a plan you've
[7:34] got to have a fiveyear you got to have
[7:36] where they always ask they ask someone
[7:38] new where do you want to be a year from
[7:39] now where do you want to be five years
[7:41] from now where do you want to be 10
[7:43] years from now you got to have a plan
[7:44] you got to have a have goals you got to
[7:46] have an Outlook you got to have
[7:48] something you want to strive to do some
[7:50] kind of accomplishment you want to uh H
[7:53] move into something you want to say I
[7:55] I've worked and and and in those goals
[7:58] you set for the years and months and
[7:59] weeks you want to have something
[8:01] something an accomplishment something a
[8:03] reward something you can say look I
[8:04] started this thing right here and now
[8:07] look where I'm at right here and I've
[8:08] done exactly what I set out to do amen
[8:10] so the saints of God that's where we are
[8:13] uh uh and it doesn't necessarily be on
[8:16] uh on a new year but every day SS of God
[8:18] I'll say like this every day is a battle
[8:21] a battle that is uh as just Waring and
[8:25] raging in our minds and hearts and souls
[8:28] and our flesh obvious this thing has
[8:30] once nothing to do with God's will this
[8:34] body this flesh gets tired SS of God I
[8:36] wish uh I work with a gentleman uh his
[8:39] body wakes up at 3: a 3:30 or 3:00 a.m.
[8:42] every morning and I'm like and and then
[8:43] he goes to work at 7 and I'm like I'm
[8:45] just in awe I was like I wish I had that
[8:47] kind of free time where your my body
[8:49] doesn't shut down you know or he just
[8:51] wakes up and then you in that kind of a
[8:53] lifestyle you could get up and pray and
[8:56] study for hours before work would even
[8:58] start would that be awesome of course he
[9:00] goes to bed at 9 9:30 I have trouble I'm
[9:03] usually getting home about 10 10:30
[9:04] whatever I'm doing right so uh I got a
[9:07] schedule things I I learned how to do
[9:08] these things here by God's grace and uh
[9:10] maybe a little bit of slow learner but
[9:12] uh uh tonight Saints I'd like to speak
[9:15] on a sign
[9:18] overlooked and with a subtopic
[9:23] of let's say a busy
[9:26] wife a sign overlooked with a sub
[9:30] topic uh or subtitle of a busy wife a
[9:34] sign
[9:37] overlooked now
[9:39] uh there's there's two really I'll say
[9:42] like this in your life or in
[9:45] lives as the young ones here would be
[9:48] growing up uh and I'll say for the young
[9:50] ones uh there are things you're looking
[9:53] forward to there there's going to be two
[9:55] major things that take place in your
[9:57] life um and one of them is number one
[10:01] usually is uh and should be of course is
[10:03] getting married that is one of the
[10:06] biggest days in your life that's the one
[10:08] of the most life-changing events you
[10:11] will have is number one getting married
[10:13] number two then after that for not
[10:15] necessarily even well even for the
[10:17] husband but mostly for a woman it would
[10:19] be having a child those two spots in
[10:22] life I think are the most life altering
[10:26] things that uh and greatest decision you
[10:29] could make for the outcome on the
[10:33] remainder of your life all right so when
[10:35] you get married young sisters young
[10:37] Brothers there uh depending on who you
[10:40] marry will determine the rest of your
[10:42] life okay and SS of God and then of
[10:45] course once you get married then of
[10:46] course uh Lord willing uh the children
[10:48] will start to come and this and that and
[10:49] however and you want those children to
[10:51] can of course and once those children
[10:53] start arriving your life takes a drastic
[10:55] turn a drastic change takes place and in
[10:59] fact some of the uh young men I'm
[11:01] working with they they're getting
[11:02] married they've had children and now
[11:03] they're like man brother Sai uh time uh
[11:06] I don't have time for myself I don't
[11:08] have time for my wife guess what I'm
[11:10] doing I'm watching over my children so
[11:13] their whole goal is literally uh their
[11:15] whole goal is uh going home and spending
[11:17] time with their children giving their
[11:19] wife a break and then spending time with
[11:21] the children Daddy's playing with the
[11:23] young boy Daddy's playing with the young
[11:24] girl and those sort of things and SS of
[11:26] God
[11:27] uh uh here we are at this this time
[11:29] Saints uh but now think about now that's
[11:32] the the natural what about the spiritual
[11:36] what about the spiritual things that God
[11:38] is that we're looking forward to do or
[11:40] to be with with Christ right we're
[11:42] looking forward to this
[11:43] Rapture we're looking forward to what
[11:45] the moving of God we're looking we're
[11:47] waiting for uh uh the coming of the Lord
[11:50] to to and the Bible says that he will
[11:52] come and descend with a shout voice and
[11:54] Trump SS of God that's how he's going to
[11:57] usher in this Rapture that's how he's
[11:59] going going to make move in our lives in
[12:01] such a way uh and those sort of things
[12:03] but uh you I I I'd like to read this
[12:05] scripture here in Matthew 25: 1-12 and
[12:09] saints of God just think on these things
[12:11] you've heard it a thousand times but
[12:14] remember what was today one day one day
[12:16] closer to the
[12:18] Rapture when I first heard this message
[12:20] at the end of 2001 I thought wow George
[12:23] Bush is present uh he's got big ears
[12:25] this could be this could be the guy and
[12:28] then 2005 2004 rolls around uh okay uh
[12:32] then then the next big one is 2012 and
[12:34] oh man everybody saying 2012 is it
[12:36] that's it it's over after that the the
[12:39] the Mayan calendars are pointing to this
[12:41] dat and sure enough 2012 Here Comes
[12:44] 2013 like wow Lord when is you when are
[12:46] you coming Lord God the prophet of God
[12:48] went off the scene in
[12:50] 65 here we are in
[12:52] 2025 60 years later right
[12:57] amazing I thought I thought Lea was
[13:00] supposed to be a short age quick Short
[13:01] age a quick short work the prophet
[13:04] himself could see passed
[13:06] 1977 1977 comes around all the message
[13:09] people quitting their jobs and this and
[13:11] that building all their money together
[13:12] and they're just like we're waiting on
[13:14] this place waiting for the Rapture 2
[13:16] 1977 goes on and they're like wow and
[13:19] what people started falling
[13:22] away but SS of God at this time this in
[13:25] fact in this
[13:26] age this is Le
[13:28] oia it's a time of
[13:30] Darkness but the Bible said in the
[13:32] evening time there would be light but SS
[13:35] of God in that time of Darkness we've
[13:36] got to have confidence that God has
[13:38] given us light I say like this this
[13:40] Bible if you have a question let's ask
[13:42] the author
[13:44] sometime well maybe brethen so and so or
[13:46] sister so so would Happ but SS of God if
[13:48] we get down on our knees and ask the
[13:50] Lord Jesus Christ to reveal where we
[13:52] even are he can reveal right now where
[13:54] we are in this Bible and what he and and
[13:57] God what did he do God sent a prophet
[13:59] and then he said and he gave us these
[14:00] Clues he says watch
[14:03] Israel watch Israel and see exactly
[14:06] that's God's time piece right we see the
[14:09] battle raging over a year now with what
[14:12] Israel Israel is fighting her enemies
[14:14] has the devil increased in your life
[14:16] like it has in their life SS of God
[14:19] absolutely I've been to some Churches
[14:20] there and they and they come up to after
[14:21] service they said brother
[14:23] Simon I feel like I yesterday I felt
[14:26] like I was going to quit
[14:29] take my wife and just head out and go
[14:31] brother Sai I thought I was I I I I I
[14:34] thought I I I I'm having so many mind
[14:36] battles I don't even want to get up and
[14:38] work and go to work I don't want to do
[14:40] this I don't want to do that I'm just
[14:42] I'm just so tired and I and and the
[14:44] whole thing say to God this is where
[14:46] we've got now we've got to find the
[14:47] balance in life we we've got to prepare
[14:50] ourselves for the Rapture right we've
[14:51] got to prepare ourselves for these sort
[14:53] of things but we've also have to balance
[14:55] this life that God gave us amen we still
[14:57] have to plant our potatoes we still got
[14:59] to what do the things we need to do this
[15:01] sister right here sister Kaa she's got
[15:03] to prepare for what's coming in the next
[15:05] years if God sister uh Lydia's already
[15:08] taking college courses writing for my my
[15:11] my mother was writing telling me
[15:12] phenomenal things about your writings
[15:15] she's like Simon she said Simon you got
[15:17] to read some idious things they're
[15:18] amazing I can't even fathom how she gets
[15:21] these thoughts out of her mind and I'm
[15:22] like okay okay awesome sweet praise the
[15:24] Lord what she's preparing for her future
[15:26] she's what getting things ready
[15:29] depending on when God would anoint a man
[15:30] to come here sweep her off her feet
[15:33] which we're trusting is the Lord Jesus
[15:34] Christ but come may come sweeping off
[15:36] her feet what and take her and then uh
[15:38] change her have a name change right uh
[15:40] but God knows all these things than to
[15:41] God that's the part of the battle right
[15:43] this is this these are the things the
[15:46] the daily things the daily Necessities
[15:49] that we need right those things that
[15:51] we're trying to strive and trying to uh
[15:53] plan for this and plan for that why
[15:55] because uh uh God even though God is our
[15:57] provider he was he part of the curse
[16:00] that came in Genesis 3 was what Adam he
[16:03] says Adam you're going to have to work
[16:04] by the sweat of your BR brow right and
[16:08] of course with the E with with Eve
[16:09] you're you're going to have in
[16:10] childbearing you're going to have a
[16:11] sorrow and all those sort of things but
[16:13] SS of God we still have to battle we
[16:15] have to deal with what the effects of
[16:16] that first sin the original sin my
[16:18] goodness absolutely now sure we all have
[16:20] plans and have dreams oh if we could
[16:22] just do this and that and maybe God
[16:23] would you know but uh give us this and
[16:25] give us that but sints of God we've got
[16:26] to just continue on and give give God
[16:29] his space what is our plan for tonight
[16:32] when you go home say Lord what is your
[16:33] plan for my life Lord God make it plain
[16:36] because remember we don't know what's
[16:38] coming ahead we don't know we just hit
[16:40] 2000 we don't know what's coming
[16:42] tomorrow maybe God wants to turn a
[16:44] corner in your life maybe God wants to
[16:46] do something what well this is how it's
[16:48] always been we just do this we do this
[16:50] we do this every day it's the same thing
[16:52] every day but maybe in that that cycle
[16:54] that you're in there's danger up ahead
[16:57] and God says you know what today hey I
[16:59] want you to do this instead break that
[17:01] cycle to get you out of Harm's Way amen
[17:03] than God we're talking about serious
[17:05] things remember that was the point of
[17:06] the having all nine spiritual gifts in
[17:08] the church if we could get someone what
[17:10] someone so in the spirit of God to where
[17:12] what they would speak in tongues and
[17:14] then the interpretation come out and it
[17:15] be a mature gift and then what also
[17:18] something specific come out and say uh
[17:20] uh sister Toba uh tomorrow when when
[17:23] you're out chasing the chickens and
[17:24] you're all collecting eggs there's going
[17:25] to be a coyote coming and next time when
[17:28] you go out I want you to bring your big
[17:29] sisters with you instead of you because
[17:30] they would get eaten by that coyote
[17:31] right so so we want I'm justay I'm just
[17:33] making a story here so so what we need
[17:35] the leadership of the Holy Ghost we want
[17:38] God to lead and guide us what in our
[17:41] lives also not only in the spirit and
[17:43] truth but we want we want also in our
[17:45] lives protection what we want to hedge
[17:47] us about us to what the devil remember
[17:49] the devil knows us better than we the
[17:51] devil has been studying Humanity for
[17:53] 6,000
[17:55] years one by one look in the Old
[17:58] Testament every major prophet in fact
[18:00] any Prophet Satan has got them to
[18:04] fall think about that remember that that
[18:07] the Bible doesn't give the name of the
[18:08] Prophet The Prophet said uh God told the
[18:10] prophet says go speak to the king he
[18:12] says don't say anything to anyone on the
[18:14] way there he says and any on your way
[18:15] back don't say nothing just head right
[18:17] back the exact same way you came and the
[18:19] prophet did that he said he's on his way
[18:20] someone said hey God he said no I got I
[18:22] got I got something to do he goes to the
[18:24] prophet or go go goes to the king says
[18:26] thus thus thus thus sayith the Lord blah
[18:27] blah blah and he's done says he does
[18:29] exactly that turns around starts heading
[18:30] out and then here comes a false lying
[18:32] Prophet what and brought a different
[18:34] word said oh the Lord spoke to me as
[18:36] well so you're supposed to come to my
[18:37] house right now notice one of the things
[18:39] see all these things in the Old
[18:41] Testament for what learning if God shows
[18:44] you something and someone around comes
[18:46] around says you something different then
[18:47] you better stick with the original
[18:49] Revelation but remember that Revelation
[18:51] has come to come to this now notice that
[18:54] that first prophet he had thus sayith
[18:56] the Lord that old lying Prophet did not
[18:58] have thus a lord say the Lord he was a
[19:01] liar and what it caused the young
[19:03] prophet's death because he listened to
[19:04] someone else amen just like Moses what
[19:08] the Moses uh the people worked him up
[19:10] for 40 years imagine complaining people
[19:15] for 40 years people thirsty people
[19:19] hungry more maybe your mother would know
[19:20] a little bit about that people hungry
[19:22] people thirsty maybe Big Sisters would
[19:24] know something about that maybe wives
[19:26] would know something about that I'm
[19:28] hungry I'm thirsty I'm cold I'm tired
[19:31] this and this and after 40 years Moses
[19:33] is just
[19:35] like he says Lord now finally at 4 years
[19:38] they said there're we're still thirsty
[19:40] Moses we're still thirsty give us
[19:42] something to drink Moses just grabs the
[19:43] staff and just
[19:46] [Music]
[19:47] like he goes and speaks to the Lord said
[19:50] Lord what would I do with this
[19:51] rebellious
[19:53] people the Lord said go speak to the
[19:55] Rock Moses is like alls I heard was
[20:00] Smite he grabs his he grabs his much
[20:04] like Babe Ruth grabs his Lumber there
[20:06] and just smites the
[20:08] Rock and by that
[20:11] Temptation who allow who made him do
[20:13] that the devil anointing the people to
[20:16] drive them completely
[20:18] insane who who who made them people like
[20:20] that shouldn't those people be so Glory
[20:22] so thankful to God to bring him out of
[20:24] Egypt shouldn't those people so be so
[20:26] thankful what that the Holy Ghost they
[20:28] left Egypt and they're just at the time
[20:30] here when now they were going northward
[20:32] they're ready to take the promised land
[20:34] but right before the promised land they

[21:09] place him
[21:10] first that's a
[21:12] promise amen now let's continue
[21:17] here Matthew 251 then shall the Kingdom
[21:20] of Heaven be liken of 10 virgins which
[21:21] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[21:23] the bridegroom man it's a little hot in
[21:24] here he says five of them were wise and
[21:27] five were foolish he says they that were
[21:28] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[21:31] with them but the wise took oil in their
[21:32] vessels with their lamps while the
[21:34] bridegroom carried they all slumbered
[21:36] and slept and at midnight there was a
[21:38] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh
[21:40] but go ye out to meet
[21:41] him then all the virgins arose and trim
[21:44] their lamps saints of
[21:47] God that's going to
[21:50] happen even though that's a parable
[21:52] that's a real life event that is going
[21:55] to take place
[21:58] there's coming a Time Saints where we're
[22:01] going to hear a voice we're going to
[22:03] hear something supernaturally there's
[22:06] coming a time where we literally we're
[22:08] going to say we're going to hear go out
[22:10] to meet
[22:12] him Jesus is at that point ready to go
[22:15] what is what is this Parable what is
[22:17] Matthew 25 it is what the husband coming
[22:20] for the bride it is literally a marriage
[22:23] ceremony it's it's literally what it is
[22:25] he's coming to rescue his wife because

[22:36] wise give us of your oil for our lamps
[22:39] are gone out
[22:43] amen now we all know the we all know
[22:45] that we've been through that ride what
[22:47] was the oil represent the oil represents
[22:49] the Holy Spirit what does the lamp
[22:51] represents according to what I'm seeing
[22:52] in the scripture uh is literally is the
[22:54] word of
[22:56] God but remember this is at dark time
[22:58] time they had the lamps they all had the
[23:01] lamps and what was that lamp that lamp
[23:02] was to light the path to direct so you
[23:05] could see where you're going saints of
[23:07] God but remember it's just not any lamp
[23:09] it can't be a denominational lamp you go
[23:11] you I like this uh if you if we could uh
[23:14] like I maybe I said this before however
[23:16] I've said this somewhere else but if we
[23:17] could take a little field trip right now
[23:20] if we get say hey let's let's go jump in
[23:22] the old landship right back out here
[23:24] right all of us just packing there me

[23:30] real tight we go in there and hey let's
[23:31] go to another church and we go to
[23:33] another church maybe a Catholic or
[23:35] Lutheran or Presbyterian or how whatever
[23:37] church is you're going to hear we go in
[23:39] there and listen we're going to hear
[23:40] they don't know exactly where what time
[23:42] it is right
[23:44] now they're bringing false ideas they're
[23:46] bringing false thoughts they still
[23:48] believe in this and believe in that and
[23:49] however there some uh uh you know uh
[23:52] think the bride goes through the
[23:53] tribulation something they they take the
[23:55] Rapture after the tribulation s of God
[23:56] they have no idea what's going on but
[23:58] that's why God has sent us a word that's
[24:01] God has sent us a revelation of Where We
[24:03] Are Tonight SS of God that Jesus said
[24:06] when you see that fig tree blooming he
[24:08] says he says the generation that see
[24:10] that shall not pass away till all these
[24:12] things be fulfilled we are in that time
[24:15] Israel I like
[24:17] this my pastor been hope back home been
[24:19] preaching on uh a little bit a couple
[24:21] weeks
[24:22] ago on the rebuilding of the temple you
[24:26] know who's supposed to be here Cyrus
[24:28] there's supposed to be a Cyrus a man
[24:31] anointed to help what rebuild the Third
[24:33] Temple
[24:35] now in f in Donald Trump's
[24:38] first four years Israel declared him as
[24:42] Osiris in fact I was in Thailand I was
[24:44] teaching that I was teaching there he is
[24:46] there's Cyrus there's he's going to
[24:47] rebuild the Third Temple and then boom
[24:48] he did not do it and then he get got
[24:50] shifted over we lost four years and then
[24:53] now come around here he is again and I
[24:56] wonder if he will rebuild this Temple
[25:01] let me just show you something here I me
[25:02] and my wife about three weeks ago we had
[25:04] read the book of
[25:07] Ezra and uh we were reading it and man
[25:10] there was some things that really was
[25:13] interesting
[25:14] Saints in Ezra 1 you know to in Ezra 1
[25:19] King Cyrus says he says that God spoke
[25:22] to King Cyrus says go tell them Jews
[25:24] allow them Jews give them all the
[25:25] resources help them rebuild the Third
[25:27] Temple or a temple rebuild the
[25:30] Temple and the Jews with joy they went
[25:33] out and started Gathering material they
[25:35] asked for this this and they started
[25:36] building and then another group we see
[25:38] in chapter three or four another group
[25:40] rose up and said hey we don't want you
[25:42] to rebuild this thing and they sent a
[25:44] letter to the new king another king that
[25:46] had risen up at that time or another
[25:47] king and the King they said he say he
[25:49] says go back and look at Israel's
[25:51] history has Israel ever paid homage have
[25:53] they ever paid taxes or retributions to
[25:56] the kingdoms been over them and search
[25:57] it out in history so the king he went up
[25:59] he read he says no they've never done
[26:01] that and he said shut it
[26:03] down so notice we see the anointing of
[26:05] the Holy Ghost move towards what the
[26:07] rebuilding of the temple and then the
[26:09] devil what shuts it down but then
[26:12] another king Rises up and says uh uh in
[26:15] fact brother cam brought this out
[26:16] beautifully how God had to anoint two
[26:19] prophets to come two prophets to come
[26:22] and help them and force them to start
[26:23] rebuilding and then as they rebuilding
[26:26] another group said hey you're not
[26:27] supposed to be rebuilding and they said
[26:29] he said go search the history go search
[26:31] history and see if King Cyrus did not
[26:33] tell us to do this so notice and then
[26:35] they of course they went back in history
[26:36] and found out yes King Cyrus did tell us
[26:39] to go and rebuild these things amen so
[26:42] come back around to King Cyrus's word
[26:44] again what to rebuild that Temple amen
[26:47] now here's something I seen But as as
[26:49] and then they started rebuilding they
[26:50] rebuild it and at the time of the
[26:54] rebuilding uh at the time of the
[26:57] rebuilding
[26:59] they had to go back to the word of
[27:01] God that because remember they had
[27:04] rebuilt the entire Tabernacle or the the
[27:06] temple or however you want to say the
[27:07] Tabernacle the temple they had rebuilt
[27:09] it and now they wanted to go into
[27:10] worship but in order to be accepted by
[27:12] the Holy Ghost in order to be accepted
[27:14] by Jehovah or God they had to what they
[27:16] had to what get themselves clean they
[27:18] had to go back and receive the word now
[27:20] look what took place here and I want you
[27:22] to think
[27:24] spiritually in Ezra 91
[27:28] after building this what Ezra said hey
[27:30] he was a teacher of the Old Testament he
[27:32] was a teacher of the word now notice in
[27:34] Ezra 9:1 now I use these scriptures in
[27:38] the original sin study but think
[27:40] spiritually about what needs to take
[27:42] place to be accepted he says now when
[27:45] these things were done the princes came
[27:46] to me saying the people of Israel notice
[27:49] the people of Israel and the priests and
[27:52] the levit notice they're all guilty what
[27:55] are they guilty of
[27:58] have not separated themselves from the L
[28:01] people of the lands doing according to
[28:03] their Abominations even of the
[28:05] Canaanites the Hittites the perizzites
[28:06] the je jebusites the ammonites the
[28:08] moabites the Egyptians and the amorites
[28:10] for they have taken of their daughters
[28:12] for themselves and for their sons so
[28:15] that the holy seed have mingled
[28:16] themselves with the people of the lands
[28:17] yay the hand of the chief the hand of
[28:19] the princes and the rulers have been
[28:21] Chief in the
[28:22] trespasses so what they have to do what
[28:25] notice Hees say they have taken for
[28:27] themselves wise
[28:29] or women what and then married into them
[28:32] what was what was Revelation 17 what was
[28:34] the mystery of the great that she
[28:36] had daughters she had harlots so notice
[28:39] these people have what in in spiritual
[28:41] sense they've went to the false churches
[28:44] and in doing that and going to false
[28:46] churches notice this and so that the
[28:48] holy seed have mingled themselves with
[28:50] the people of those lands if you go back
[28:52] to Matthew 13 remember the parable the
[28:54] sewer he was sowing seed he was sewing
[28:57] what the word word of God but if you go
[28:59] to a wrong Church a false Church
[29:01] whatever it be because remember Jesus
[29:02] said I'll bind the tears first and then
[29:04] I'll take the weed up into the Garner he
[29:06] say into the barn air he says what
[29:08] notice what takes place after they join
[29:10] themselves in false church is what the
[29:12] holy seed or the word will be
[29:14] mingled saints of God the whole key of
[29:17] everything what was the what was what
[29:19] started the very Act of the original sin
[29:22] was what the serpent mingling the word
[29:25] with a woman with a church a false
[29:28] preacher comeing and mingle the word
[29:29] with the true church which is Eve right
[29:32] saints of God it's just like uh it's
[29:34] just like the New Testament Ephesian age
[29:36] amen sure
[29:38] now that's that that right there so that
[29:41] the holy seed have mingled
[29:44] themselves that's that's the part that
[29:47] we we've got to make sure that we're
[29:48] doing everything correctly amen now in
[29:52] this sort of thing now I'm G to move on
[29:53] here by God's grace I wanted to share
[29:55] that with you
[29:56] now in you know like this a sign
[30:00] overlooked a ready wife or sorry a busy
[30:04] wife
[30:06] right look at John 14 John 14:1 he says
[30:10] let not your heart be troubled ye
[30:12] believe in God he says believe also in
[30:14] me he says for in my father's house are
[30:16] many mansions if it were not so I would
[30:18] I would have told you I go to prepare a
[30:21] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[30:24] place for you I will come again and
[30:26] receive you unto myself and where I am
[30:28] there ye may also be uh may be also and
[30:32] whether I I go you know in the way you
[30:34] know so
[30:35] notice if we're a wife of Christ Christ
[30:39] said 2,000 years ago he's going to a
[30:40] place to prepare us something he's going
[30:43] over there to prepare us a house a
[30:45] mansion right we have a faithful husband
[30:49] trust me he's not just laying around
[30:51] there he's what interceding for our sins
[30:54] he's applying the blood and the mercy
[30:55] see what we are completely spotless
[30:57] according to what the Revelation brought
[30:59] to us in this day the the what he said
[31:01] the bride was deceived she was tricked
[31:03] into this thing there's no you're not
[31:05] guilty of
[31:06] anything now but here's our husband he's
[31:09] ready he's going to be ready when he
[31:11] comes that place is done when he comes
[31:14] well all things are ready now he says go
[31:17] what get people ready for the feast sure
[31:20] now now the beautiful thing about that
[31:23] is that we see now notice he's got a
[31:24] place prepared and in John 14:24
[31:28] look at his prayer he says he says uh he
[31:33] says uh John 14:24 he says father I will
[31:36] that they also whom thou has given me be
[31:38] with me where I am see his one desire
[31:42] his one request to the father was what
[31:44] that he wanted to be with us he wanted
[31:47] us to be with him amen he wants his wife
[31:50] to be attached and join to the husband
[31:53] he wants us to be attached to what the
[31:54] Holy Ghost amen sure the saints of God
[31:57] so notice
[31:58] that's where we want to be we want to be
[32:00] where is the bride is going to be the
[32:01] bride is going to be in the perfect will
[32:02] of God and in what the anointing are
[32:05] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost we
[32:08] might not feel it all the time we might
[32:10] not think we're God's always with us but
[32:12] s of God he is always with us he's
[32:15] always near when we go off here we say
[32:17] something we shouldn't what brother said
[32:18] he said that little bird that little
[32:20] Dove flies does not the presence of the
[32:22] Holy Ghost does not leave us in our
[32:24] souls but the Holy Spirit then will lift
[32:26] off and go sit on a little branch we're
[32:28] waiting for us to repent so what he can
[32:29] come right on back with us amen
[32:31] absolutely and that's the promise we
[32:33] have tonight Saints is that what all we
[32:35] have to do is live right speak right
[32:37] talk right do the right things and what
[32:39] the Holy Ghost presence will be among
[32:41] us about three weeks ago I was at a
[32:43] service and I didn't I didn't know which
[32:45] way to go I was like Lord do you want me
[32:47] here you want me here so on the way

[32:50] want to know you I just had this weird
[32:51] prayer I said Lord I want to know that

[33:10] use and I got up there I said saints of
[33:12] God this service is for you the word the
[33:17] sermon I have this this this this

[35:27] something wrong and what the Holy Ghost
[35:28] will bring back to him says oh forgive
[35:30] me let me reread that scripture ah there
[35:32] it is that's it and he went taught it
[35:34] right amen sure he says when she found
[35:37] it she called her friends and her
[35:39] neighbors together saying Rejoice with
[35:41] me he says for I found the peace which I
[35:43] had lost likewise I say unto you that
[35:46] when there is joy in the presence of the
[35:47] angels of God when over one sinner that
[35:50] repented now notice this was a type of
[35:52] the Bride no notice the husband was not
[35:54] at home because if the husband would
[35:56] have came home and found one those
[35:57] things all lost she could have been
[35:59] stoned or divorced or kicked out however
[36:01] want to say it she could have been not
[36:03] been the wife anymore sure just like
[36:04] bashai right now what do those things
[36:09] mean what do those coins represent thank
[36:11] God we have a prophet he says in those
[36:13] days they didn't have wedding rings they
[36:15] had a tablet they call it a tablet they
[36:17] put it on their head it had 10 coins it
[36:19] around their head and it was a signed
[36:21] that they were a married woman and no
[36:23] man was to fool around with them no boys
[36:25] to flirt with them he say they were
[36:26] married each one of those coins he says
[36:29] if only had time but I haven't I'm going
[36:31] to try and keep my words as close as
[36:32] possible I could tell you what each one
[36:34] of those coins meant it first it was
[36:37] first placed in there that each coin
[36:38] meant a certain virtue of the woman the
[36:42] first meaning her love towards a husband
[36:44] second her pledged The Virtue to live
[36:45] clean him the third and fourth fifth
[36:47] n9th 10th right he says if you want to
[36:49] look it up he says look in Galatians 5
[36:52] he gives us the clue what do those 10
[36:54] coins represents he says look in
[36:56] Galatians 5 he says which is love joy
[37:01] peace right but if you go to Galatians 5
[37:05] and22 we only find
[37:10] nine but the fruit of the spirit is love
[37:14] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[37:19] goodness Faith meekness and Temperance
[37:23] nine but the prophet said there's 10
[37:28] the the parable says there're 10 he says
[37:31] against such there is no
[37:34] law but you know the Holy Ghost didn't
[37:36] stop there in Ephesians now notice what
[37:39] was the Ephesians the Ephesians was the
[37:40] mature bride the Ephesians was the
[37:43] mature word that church that came out of
[37:45] the book of Acts the one that uh the
[37:47] prophet of God the one the prophet God
[37:49] likened to Joshua coming up going what
[37:51] into the promised land taking the
[37:53] promised land they would have the 10th
[37:55] coin in a Ephesians 5 verse 8 now notice
[38:01] it's talking about Darkness as well for
[38:03] ye were sometimes Darkness but now you
[38:06] are light in the Lord walk as children
[38:08] of light there's that woman with that
[38:10] candle lit right there looking looking
[38:12] right see now she had Joy she had peace
[38:14] but there was one thing she was missing
[38:16] before the husband came
[38:17] home what was what was she missing what
[38:20] took place in this age he says he say
[38:23] for the fruit he says but the fruit of
[38:25] the spirit is all goodness and
[38:26] righteousness and truth SS of God that
[38:29] last that last coin that last silver
[38:32] coin of Salvation that we needed was
[38:34] what the truth of God the truth of the
[38:37] word of God that had to be what restored
[38:40] that was the one king that was the one
[38:42] coin that was lost all the way back in
[38:44] Ephesians but it's revealed what to the
[38:46] by the Holy Ghost revealed to the
[38:48] prophet these coins meant that and that
[38:50] was the truth of the word the truth what
[38:52] is the truth it's the revelation of the
[38:55] Bible what is the truth it's the
[38:57] revelation of Jesus
[38:59] Christ that's what we need is the
[39:01] revelation of Jesus Christ and it's not
[39:04] word it's not word alone but it's
[39:06] Revelation what upon this church he says
[39:09] Upon This Rock he says I'll build my
[39:11] church upon the Revelation or the truth
[39:14] amen yeah that's exactly right he says
[39:18] now the fruit of the spirit is all
[39:19] goodness and righteousness and Truth
[39:20] proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
[39:24] he says have no fellowship with the
[39:25] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[39:27] repr prove them amen SS of God everybody
[39:30] got their 10 coins right here absolutely
[39:31] let me check oh yeah we've got the truth
[39:33] we got Spirit we got joy we got all
[39:35] those sort of
[39:36] things and then you can walk up
[39:38] confidently when the when you see when
[39:40] you open your windows and you see the
[39:42] husband coming you can walk to the door
[39:43] and say I've got all 10 I've got all the
[39:47] fruits of the spirit and SS of God that
[39:48] one and it's like like husband husband
[39:50] thank God you're home but notice I had
[39:52] lost one but what it was restored and
[39:54] that was the truth amen now I know what
[39:56] as he come she could catch the
[39:58] revelation of Jesus Christ say yes
[40:00] that's him amen then you'll know is him
[40:02] Amen in fact like the hus the wife the
[40:04] wife will know the husband the wife
[40:06] should know the husband of the word amen
[40:10] now there's something that took place
[40:12] about a couple of Sundays ago and I I
[40:15] got online I started researching some of
[40:17] the secrets of the the Catholic church
[40:20] and the depths of that and how they come
[40:21] in a church and but defile and I seen a
[40:24] lot of things very similar uh but then
[40:27] with that came another testimony of a
[40:29] woman who is married to a uh of a
[40:31] Catholic
[40:33] priest and she did not even know that he
[40:36] was a
[40:37] priest they lived together for so many
[40:40] years 10 15 20 years and she had no idea
[40:43] until the very end that he was she was
[40:45] that he was a
[40:47] priest she obviously didn't know her
[40:49] husband that well that husband was a man
[40:52] of Deceit would you say a man of Bal
[40:55] right sure but what a true true wife of
[40:58] Christ the true wife of Jesus Christ
[40:59] would know him better than anyone else
[41:02] not by just word even though word's good
[41:04] but he'll know that she'll know the
[41:06] moving of the spirit she'll she'll know
[41:08] how he's trying to connect to her amen
[41:11] he'll know she'll know how he's trying
[41:12] to speak to her amen yes
[41:16] now look what the prophet God says
[41:20] here now dealing with Matthew 25 he says
[41:22] now You' got to keep that sleeping
[41:24] virgin that church nominal confessional
[41:26] see you've got to get to that church
[41:28] that's the Jew first the Jew first which
[41:30] is a blinded person waiting on the
[41:32] sideline you got to get up to the next
[41:33] step which is the sleeping virgin who
[41:35] was dilatory he calls the foolish virgin
[41:38] those that missed the Rapture those that
[41:39] were in the word that believe the true
[41:41] word that had the lamps they had the
[41:43] word for their hour but the Holy Ghost
[41:44] was lacking from their life he calls
[41:46] them the sleeping virgin and he calls
[41:48] them dilator right we know those things
[41:50] right now what does dilator mean dilator
[41:53] means literally draw out or extending in
[41:56] time uh uh tardy applied to things uh
[42:01] that you're not supposed to be applying
[42:02] to dor counsels and measures in other
[42:04] words you're late or
[42:08] tardy but remember we're dealing with
[42:10] the bride of Christ what is dilator what
[42:12] is dilator mean in Matthew
[42:15] 25 they failed to receive the baptism of
[42:18] the Holy Ghost they failed to receive
[42:21] they were failed to be born again they
[42:24] failed to receive the very life of their
[42:26] husband that came into them and sealed
[42:28] them until the day of the Redemption
[42:30] right that was the only that was the one
[42:32] thing that they were late to they did
[42:33] everything else because the Bible called
[42:35] them F virgins right they were clean
[42:37] Pure Living but they failed they were
[42:39] little late to receiving the receiving
[42:41] his life
[42:42] right
[42:45] now do you know of anyone else that's
[42:47] dilator in the in the in the message
[42:49] that brother called
[42:51] dilator let me jump here
[42:57] in fact Let me let me let me read you a
[42:58] quote here brother BR said about himself
[43:01] he says I'm guilty I'm guilty of not
[43:03] doing the job of God like I should do
[43:07] I'm confessing it that I'm wrong I'm
[43:09] asking God to be merciful to me I'm
[43:11] looking out here and seeing the
[43:12] opportunities I've missed you missed any
[43:14] my opportunities witnessing absolutely I
[43:16] have too I have missed because of the
[43:18] petty things little old insignificant
[43:21] things that didn't mean nothing I'm
[43:22] ashamed of myself as a gospel Minister
[43:25] before you I Repent before God and ask
[43:26] God to forgive me and the church to
[43:28] forgive me for being so dilatory about
[43:30] the work of God so you can have the Holy
[43:33] Ghost but are you doing the work of God
[43:35] what is God's perfect will for your life
[43:38] you're going to see what he says
[43:40] here he says everyone telling you to do
[43:43] something to do you've got a program
[43:45] you've got something to do nonsense I
[43:47] know God's program it's written out here
[43:48] in the Bible Bible I'm ashamed to myself
[43:51] as a minister of the Gospel 1 million
[43:54] Souls I've won he says I ought to have
[43:56] won 10 million Souls I'm way
[44:00] behind how many Souls have we won say to
[44:04] God it is
[44:07] difficult there's one young man he just
[44:10] topped out two years ago he's pipe
[44:12] fitter I've been hitting him up with
[44:13] gospel for about two years since I've
[44:15] known him three years and finally we're
[44:17] going back and forth at a job he's like
[44:19] Simon the Greek Orthodox with the truth
[44:21] blah blah there's there's no other truth
[44:23] but Greek Orthodox that's who his wife
[44:24] is you know this and I said brother I
[44:26] want you to listen to one thing I told
[44:29] him I said the Catholic church is the
[44:30] root of the problem he's like brother
[44:32] I'm telling you I don't think I said
[44:34] listen to 50 years in a church of roow
[44:37] and I sent him that one quick by Micah
[44:40] pure I sent that one first one and I
[44:42] said all you have to do is hit play and
[44:44] one by one it'll come and you'll listen
[44:46] to the whole thing two weeks later I got
[44:47] a text from him he said brother he said
[44:49] actually called brother he said Simon
[44:52] thank you for recommending that he goes
[44:53] I had no idea how deep this was
[44:58] I said I didn't even
[45:00] know the depth of how far this thing is
[45:03] entangled in other words it's pretty
[45:05] much gone I said it was gone back in the
[45:07] 1850s it was gone so finally the God God
[45:11] opened his eyes to see that saints of
[45:13] God he opened his eyes to but now
[45:15] where's he at still I said he want the
[45:17] Bible stud let's go silence but at least
[45:20] he saw this now remember these are seeds
[45:22] we're planting we're supposed to be
[45:24] planting seeds what of Truth in the
[45:26] individuals that we know that we that we
[45:28] work around we're around those sort of
[45:29] things we're trying to work live the
[45:31] best kind of life we can right now he
[45:36] says he says I'm way behind he says now
[45:39] look what he says here how about
[45:42] you how many Souls have you won since
[45:44] you've been been in
[45:47] Christ Christianity goes from one to
[45:50] another see how it's supposed to Once
[45:53] once someone gets baptized in the name
[45:54] of Jesus Christ gets the filling of the
[45:56] Holy Ghost whether be whatever kind of
[45:58] time period once you receive the baptism
[45:59] of the ho ghost we should be what
[46:01] witnessing machines we should be living
[46:03] this the kind of life like I say this
[46:05] sometimes the sisters up here come and
[46:06] say say brother Simon come pray for my
[46:09] my friend I want Sav SS of God that's
[46:11] that's that's what I'm talking about
[46:13] what interceding for your loved ones for
[46:15] your friends for your lost people that
[46:17] you know s of God that's that's soul
[46:20] travail see now it's what I heard a
[46:23] brother say one time he says uh the
[46:25] shepherd does not produce sheep sheep
[46:27] produce sheep right it should go from
[46:29] one to another they should be able to
[46:31] look at your lives as a sister a
[46:33] sister's not called to preach but here
[46:34] she is living her life living dressing
[46:37] holy leaving her hair uncut living a
[46:39] clean kind of life and just by walking a
[46:42] certain kind of way acting and with
[46:43] Chase
[46:45] conversation just the way you handle you
[46:48] the the very words that come out of your
[46:49] mouth you can win souls just by the
[46:52] gentleness of your voice
[46:58] how many times it happen I don't know
[47:00] but the Bible says that's how it should
[47:03] be that's the power the sisters have is
[47:06] just that Meek quiet Spirit which is of
[47:09] great price the Bible says he says how
[47:11] many Souls have you won since you've
[47:13] been a Christian if you're not winning
[47:14] Souls you are guilty as you are Barren
[47:16] you have brought shame onto the church
[47:19] and the gospel God have mercy on me it's
[47:22] been a long time since I want a soul
[47:24] we're witnessing I just I in fact the
[47:27] last couple weeks I've hand out many
[47:28] baptism tracks and I said hey read this
[47:31] pray on this this is the way to get
[47:32] baptized one guy completely ignored me
[47:35] the other guy said oh I'll check that
[47:37] out all right check it out never hear
[47:38] from back from but saints were trying to
[47:40] not just and I'll say this a lot of
[47:42] people what what brother Ram say he said
[47:44] the hardest thing that ever to ever take
[47:46] place the hardest thing to take place on
[47:48] Earth is what for one person to believe
[47:55] another you know the thing is the Bible
[47:57] says that uh God uses the foolishness of
[48:00] the world to confound the
[48:03] wise and if there's a I'll like this if
[48:05] there's one that looks like foolish
[48:07] it's I'm the least Smart in my company
[48:09] I'm the smallest in my company they're
[48:11] like Simon I know you're a good plumber
[48:13] but uh really we supposed to do like
[48:14] that they don't have any confidence in
[48:17] me I was running a I was with a job and
[48:20] they put an apprentice to run this big
[48:21] job and I The Apprentice is like hey Sim
[48:23] what I do here I said me I would do this
[48:24] this this he goes I'll call somebody
[48:26] else and I'm
[48:28] like wait a second I've only got nine
[48:30] years to retire and you're going to ask
[48:31] someone else about what I do
[48:33] professionally
[48:34] okay but what it's so hard they won't
[48:37] even believe me in my Plumbing stuff let
[48:40] alone in the Gospel of Jesus
[48:43] Christ it is so difficult for someone to
[48:47] believe a
[48:48] Christian what does it come down to what
[48:50] does it it comes down to election as
[48:52] many as are ordained to life will
[48:55] receive it and that's it SS of God we we
[48:58] witness we teach you know how many times
[49:00] I've offered Bible studies hundreds and

[50:41] shame to the church how many people did
[50:43] you get out here for a Wednesday night

[50:46] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[50:48] before Christ you're guilty in your
[50:49] place is at the altar I invite you to
[50:51] come with me for repentance amen saints
[50:54] of God let's get out there and invite
[50:56] people people in invite people to come
[50:58] to what hear the gospel sure
[51:04] now in Luke
[51:06] 10:38 now it came to pass as they went
[51:09] that he entered into a certain V Village
[51:11] and a certain woman named Martha
[51:13] received him into her house and she had
[51:16] a sister called Mary which also sat at
[51:18] Jesus's feet and heard his word but
[51:20] Martha was cumed about with much serving
[51:22] and came to him and said Lord thust not
[51:24] now care that my sister came left me to
[51:27] serve alone bid her therefore that she
[51:29] come help me so here is a woman the
[51:31] Bible said that Jesus loved Mary Martha
[51:33] and Lazarus and Jesus came into the
[51:36] house they invited Jesus into the house
[51:39] and what did Jesus do Jesus automatic he
[51:41] starts preaching he starts teaching the
[51:42] word of God but here is Martha now
[51:45] remember there's two two separate
[51:46] churches here there's two different
[51:47] women here one was this Mary was like
[51:51] Jesus come in and her eyes were locked
[51:53] on Christ she washed her every Mo
[51:57] movement wased his every eye movement
[51:59] his the way he was walking and then
[52:01] finally found when Jesus found a seat
[52:04] she found a seat as close as she could
[52:06] get without messing with the brothers as
[52:08] close as she could get to him and just
[52:10] started listening while the other sister
[52:12] Martha was busy okay wow I've got Jesus
[52:16] here I've got Jesus here all right do
[52:17] you need a glass of water with with ice
[52:20] with was ice crushed okay just just warm
[52:22] look warm water uh wait no hot water you
[52:24] want some tea okay you guys hungry
[52:27] and all the time Jesus is preaching he's
[52:29] teaching these things and she's all
[52:31] about serving what the people in the
[52:33] house why because not because notice but
[52:36] remember her heart her heart was what
[52:38] Jesus is here but I want to be doing
[52:40] something for I want to be hospitable I
[52:42] want to do these sort of things right
[52:44] and finally she got the point where
[52:45] she's so fed up she's like well this is
[52:48] and she sees her sister there just
[52:49] sitting there doing
[52:52] nothing and she starts she stops what
[52:55] she's doing she's eyeing her sister
[52:56] going
[52:59] and finally says hold the
[53:01] service Jesus Lord I'm doing everything
[53:05] I can for the people around you please
[53:08] tell my sister to help and she says
[53:11] Martha Mary has chosen the better
[53:14] part that's what you're supposed to be
[53:18] doing he says but you are cumbered with
[53:20] so much serving you're overdoing
[53:23] yourself you're extend you're extending
[53:24] all your energy when PA I want you to do
[53:27] is sit
[53:28] here and listen to me
[53:31] speak and Martha was like oh
[53:37] okay now is is Martha a type of the
[53:39] foolish virgin what' Jesus say is Martha
[53:42] Martha Thou Art careful and troubled
[53:44] about many things but one thing is
[53:47] needful and Mary hath chosen that good
[53:50] part which shall not be taken away from
[53:53] her now I want to tell you something
[53:55] about Martha a lot of people say well
[53:57] she's foolish virgin she's the type of
[53:59] the foolish virgin she's this that man
[54:01] she's no good and D but if you look what
[54:04] brother Bram said about it Martha she
[54:07] was aware that he was in other words
[54:10] when Jesus entered the house she knew he
[54:12] was there she knew he was preaching and
[54:14] that was the most important thing she
[54:17] knew those things she was I'm sure she
[54:18] was listening because it was the word of
[54:20] God but she's so busy about doing this
[54:22] and that but look what the prophet says
[54:25] he says she was Dil she she he calls him
[54:27] dilator she was busy and things about
[54:30] keeping her house clean yes but when The
[54:33] Showdown
[54:35] came Martha when The Showdown came she
[54:40] showed her color yes sir Mary other what
[54:43] was a showdown when their brother died
[54:45] Lazarus died they gave a call out Jesus
[54:48] our brother Lazarus the one you love is
[54:50] sick he's dying and Jesus said I'll be
[54:53] there a little bit later give me some
[54:54] time
[54:57] and then as soon as Lazarus died they
[54:58] had the ceremony Mary Martha crying oh
[55:02] my
[55:04] brother Mary goes in the house just
[55:07] starts weeping and then about a day
[55:10] after four
[55:12] days Jesus comes walking down and who
[55:16] catches wind of Jesus first Mary or
[55:19] Martha who caught the the coming of the
[55:22] Lord Jesus Christ first it was Martha
[55:25] see so she had she knew what he could do
[55:28] she always was a Believer she was
[55:30] already believed that all things were
[55:33] possible
[55:34] right he says at the time of The
[55:36] Showdown she showed her color yes sir
[55:39] many was sitting weeping because their
[55:41] brother was dead Mary was he says but
[55:42] Martha went out and met the Living Word
[55:45] saints of God at that time before in
[55:48] that first situation looked like Martha
[55:50] was not going to make it but when Christ
[55:52] come on the scene when it was time for a
[55:54] miracle when God when he Supernatural
[55:57] intervention the one was ordained for
[55:59] that was Martha amen she showed that
[56:02] what she was not going to look at in
[56:03] other words Mary was consumed even
[56:05] though she heard the word she was
[56:07] consumed by a dead body by a dead corpse
[56:10] that was impossible there's nothing
[56:12] could be done right here but what Martha
[56:14] went out and thought all things were
[56:16] Possible only believe amen and look if
[56:19] you look at the way she approached him
[56:20] says Lord if you had been here my
[56:23] brother would have not died right but
[56:25] even now what soever thou sayth he says
[56:27] it will take place amen and Jesus said
[56:30] your brother will rise again she goes I
[56:32] know he's going to rise it'll it'll be
[56:34] right then and Jesus said he said I am
[56:36] the resurrection and the life see right
[56:39] there saints of God she approached him
[56:41] correctly there was nothing negative she
[56:43] says I believe I believe I believe in
[56:45] what God Said Lazarus rise up
[56:48] amen it prove Martha was a True Believer
[56:52] what that through Martha what the
[56:54] supernatural take place you know brother
[56:57] bam like in the scripture in uh in John
[56:59] I believe was John 12 or John 10 John 10
[57:02] 11 there with Marth when Lazarus RIS up
[57:04] he Likens that to the Rapture
[57:06] type if you listen to The Rapture
[57:08] Rapture message what and Martha was
[57:10] right in the Battle of it right in the
[57:11] heat of it now
[57:13] notice Martha went out and met the
[57:15] Living Word in the beginning was uh the
[57:17] word and the Word was with God and the
[57:18] Word was made was made was God and the
[57:20] Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us
[57:22] he he was the Living Word of God that's
[57:25] right God's word made manest in other
[57:26] words there's there's coming a
[57:29] time if you if you read John 14-17 Jesus
[57:33] is bringing forth Mysteries that was my
[57:36] pastor just preached on this about three
[57:37] four months ago Jesus was bringing forth
[57:40] his last message to the church without
[57:42] Judas and in this message he literally
[57:45] says he says there's coming a time
[57:47] there's coming an hour he say well I
[57:49] will be in the Father the father in me
[57:50] and I will be in you he says and you
[57:52] will know
[57:54] it see in this Darkness saints of God
[57:57] Jesus ordained this this thing to get so
[57:59] dark what's right what's true where are
[58:01] we at how much time do we have left he
[58:04] he he allowed this to be so dark that
[58:06] he's going he himself is going to rise
[58:08] up in us it's not going to be by Our Own
[58:11] Strength it's not going to be by your
[58:12] own intellect or wisdom it's not it
[58:14] never comes by man's Wisdom sints of God
[58:16] it comes by what the wisdom of the Holy
[58:18] Ghost amen but it takes a you have to be
[58:21] a yielded vessel to brother said he's
[58:24] you got to let all your desire your
[58:26] Wills your minds your thoughts your
[58:28] ideas die out and let the word of God
[58:30] come into you s what does that mean I
[58:33] don't know but he'll interpret it on
[58:34] that
[58:35] day we'll find out trust me when it
[58:38] comes to pass we'll say is this not that
[58:40] which was prophesied is this not that
[58:43] which was amen he said yes absolutely
[58:45] now let's continue
[58:47] on he says so Martha went up come up and
[58:50] she fell down at his feet said Lord Lord
[58:52] that's what he was he says if you'd have
[58:54] been here my father my brother would not
[58:56] have died see yes he says but even now
[58:59] whatsoever you ask God God will do it he
[59:01] says oh there we are and there you are
[59:03] no she had Faith but remember she was so
[59:06] busy at the beginning but remember by
[59:07] the time her H her brother died she had
[59:10] a little bit of resting time to think on
[59:11] these
[59:13] things she's watching her brother
[59:16] die praying Jehovah send Jesus way send
[59:20] a letter to Jesus Jesus come please come
[59:23] and she watched Lazarus take the last
[59:25] breath
[59:27] but in her mind what' she say the things
[59:30] that were in her mind she says man if
[59:32] only Jesus would have made it if only
[59:34] the Lord Would Have Made It If Only God
[59:37] would have made it if only he had been
[59:39] here Mary Mary's just crying just crying
[59:42] Marth was just like man if he only been
[59:44] here things would be different right now
[59:46] if he would just got here why because I
[59:48] believe I know if he'd have been here it
[59:50] been done just like that woman to Touch
[59:51] the Hem of His Garment all she do she
[59:53] all she said was I believe I have to
[59:55] touch that I'm going to going to get
[59:56] healed and what the faith in her reached
[59:58] out and touched that what that faith
[59:59] became manifest that Faith activated her
[1:00:02] hand and what it took place it took
[1:00:06] place now
[1:00:09] amen what is it she's acting she wanted
[1:00:11] to see a miracle so she's finding out
[1:00:13] what the word says she says I believe
[1:00:15] the word it's standing there in the form
[1:00:17] of the Son of God his words is not uh
[1:00:19] his words is not his not me that
[1:00:22] speaketh but the father that dwelleth in
[1:00:23] me he says whatsoever cometh out of thy
[1:00:26] your your little lips of yours that
[1:00:28] speaketh I'll have I'll believe it's the
[1:00:29] commission of of God oh my there we are
[1:00:32] the Messiah the anointed one he says you
[1:00:35] are God's anointed one he says you are
[1:00:37] God's anointed one all you have to do is
[1:00:39] ask
[1:00:40] God even though Jesus Is Not In the
[1:00:42] Flesh right now he's right here going
[1:00:45] through the service he's right here I'm
[1:00:47] not a prophet I can't see the the pillar
[1:00:49] of fire moving but I know this he is
[1:00:51] here work trying to work on our hearts
[1:00:54] work on our minds work on our Souls by
[1:00:56] the preaching of the word amen now let
[1:01:00] continue now notice a busy
[1:01:04] wife Matthew 221 Jesus answered and
[1:01:08] spake to them again many parables and
[1:01:10] said the Kingdom of Heaven is liken to a
[1:01:12] King which made a marriage for his
[1:01:16] son and they sent forth his servants to
[1:01:19] call them that are bidden to the wedding
[1:01:20] and they would not
[1:01:22] come again he sent forth many servants
[1:01:24] saying tell them which are bidden behold
[1:01:26] I have prepared my dinner and my ox and
[1:01:28] my fatlings are killed and all things
[1:01:30] are ready come unto the marriage and
[1:01:32] they made light of it and went their
[1:01:34] ways one to his farm and another to his
[1:01:38] merchandise notice Farm they were seemed
[1:01:41] like they were wealthy they had things
[1:01:43] there was more
[1:01:45] important saints of
[1:01:47] God let's not get too busy for
[1:01:52] Jesus you are the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] I just read a quote uh I'm sorry it was
[1:02:00] a scripture and the scripture said the
[1:02:03] evil in the the evil man in his thoughts
[1:02:07] are not all with God in other words God
[1:02:09] is not in all his
[1:02:11] thoughts so that's why as we wake up
[1:02:14] tomorrow morning as we go home tonight
[1:02:16] as we do go about our lives tomorrow
[1:02:18] Christ must be in every
[1:02:21] thought every one of us has challenges
[1:02:23] tomorrow what are we going to do for
[1:02:25] this what are we going to do for that
[1:02:26] Lord Make A Way Lord God what even in
[1:02:29] the little things he cares he is a big
[1:02:31] God but he cares about the little things
[1:02:32] as well and a lot of times that we can
[1:02:35] we can ask him for advice we can ask him
[1:02:37] for his way on the little things the big
[1:02:38] things the bigger tunnels the bigger
[1:02:40] roads will open up and say ah there it
[1:02:42] was but we've got to start on this small
[1:02:44] way
[1:02:47] first we can't there's one I like I I
[1:02:50] really think right now SS God I think
[1:02:51] the problem with the bride right now is
[1:02:54] she we are too busy
[1:02:57] the wife is too
[1:03:02] busy I'm not calling anyone I'm just
[1:03:04] saying in general I know this to be true
[1:03:07] because I watch it in my own
[1:03:09] life uh this takes I was like this
[1:03:11] plumbing plumbing has been Cur become a
[1:03:13] curse everyone wants to Plum it right he
[1:03:16] said they made light of it and went
[1:03:18] their ways one to his farm another to
[1:03:20] his merchandise and the remnant took his
[1:03:22] servants and entreated them spitefully
[1:03:24] and slew them uh but when the king heard
[1:03:26] of it he was wroth and sent forth his
[1:03:28] armies and destroy those murderers that
[1:03:29] burn up their city and burn up their
[1:03:31] City then said he to the servants the
[1:03:32] wedding is ready but when but they which
[1:03:35] were bidden were not
[1:03:37] worthy so how do you become worthy put
[1:03:40] Jesus
[1:03:42] first and let's just start let me just
[1:03:44] say like this let me start with the
[1:03:45] simple things just normal Church
[1:03:52] attendance David by the Holy Ghost said
[1:03:55] better is one day in his
[1:03:58] courts than a thousand
[1:04:03] elsewhere better is one day in his
[1:04:06] courts than a
[1:04:08] thousand days
[1:04:11] elsewhere if you get that
[1:04:18] Revelation go either therefore into the
[1:04:20] highways and as many as ye shall find
[1:04:23] bid to the
[1:04:26] marriage so those guests went out into
[1:04:28] the highways and gathered together as
[1:04:30] many as they found both good both bad
[1:04:32] and good you see who's coming to this
[1:04:34] Rapture do you see who's coming to the
[1:04:36] Rapture someone is
[1:04:39] bad hey hey sister can you go witness
[1:04:42] that can you go witness that sister no
[1:04:43] she's pretty bad yeah that's the one
[1:04:44] that's the guy I mean that's the girl
[1:04:46] yeah that bad girl with all these you
[1:04:47] know half his arm tattooed and you know
[1:04:50] looking like Mike Tyson whatever that's
[1:04:52] the one God wants her a lot of times the
[1:04:54] Bible said that's the one that's going
[1:04:56] to come the ones that look unsavable the
[1:04:58] ones that look what that's impossible
[1:05:00] for God the ones that look like they
[1:05:01] have nothing to do with Christ but
[1:05:03] remember it's not the outward appearance
[1:05:05] God lookth at the heart amen God looks
[1:05:08] right down here who who are they
[1:05:12] really who are they
[1:05:16] really so the servants went out to the
[1:05:18] highways and gathered together all as
[1:05:20] many has been found both good and bad
[1:05:21] bad and good and the wedding was
[1:05:23] furnished with guests
[1:05:28] you know why I say we're too

[1:05:51] spirit will be more able to work around
[1:05:53] it you know his whole life his one of
[1:05:55] his dreams was to literally set aside to
[1:05:58] find a congregation to come back and

[1:07:32] night and the vision had me up and then
[1:07:33] usually Visions work me pretty tired
[1:07:35] hard that's the reason these meetings

[1:07:39] off preach and then a few nights and
[1:07:41] have a healing service and then back and
[1:07:43] I'm trying to make myself adjusted to
[1:07:45] meetings he says where we're going to
[1:07:46] get a big tent and stay for three or
[1:07:48] four weeks at a time in a place he
[1:07:52] always wanted to do this 8 2265
[1:07:56] he says but we've got one of the most
[1:07:57] Dreadful times to go through he's
[1:07:58] talking about this coming right before
[1:08:00] the squeeze right before the Great
[1:08:02] Tribulation comes he says there's a
[1:08:04] dreadful times are coming you know what
[1:08:06] we have right now here now here Golden
[1:08:08] Memories golden times you're at peace
[1:08:12] anybody worried about some guy coming
[1:08:13] here and and with his with a big gun and
[1:08:16] saying are you a Christian are you a
[1:08:17] Christian you worried about that right
[1:08:19] now no we're not worried about that but
[1:08:21] there's coming a
[1:08:22] time where that's going to strike that
[1:08:25] thing those those things are going to
[1:08:26] take
[1:08:28] place he says we've got one of the most
[1:08:31] Dreadful times to go through that ever
[1:08:33] laid before human beings and I'm just
[1:08:35] waiting for the hour when we can get
[1:08:37] everybody can take a chance we can get
[1:08:40] off from work and spend a few days where
[1:08:42] we can get up somewhere where I can
[1:08:43] speak on those plagues and things that's
[1:08:45] to fall in the last days and throw about
[1:08:47] two or three weeks together and bring it
[1:08:50] together if the Lord lets me live to do
[1:08:52] that inspire me to do those things that
[1:08:53] will drop in see he always wanted the
[1:08:56] people what to get away from their lives
[1:08:58] and come so the presence of God can move
[1:09:01] his in his way
[1:09:03] now in closing
[1:09:07] here I find this I found this so
[1:09:09] interesting when I was coming driving up
[1:09:11] my wife was driving and I was sitting
[1:09:13] there and I was just looking at this in
[1:09:15] Luke
[1:09:19] 24 and behold two of them 13 and behold
[1:09:23] two of them went from the same Day to a
[1:09:25] village called emus which was from
[1:09:28] Jerusalem about three score furlongs and
[1:09:30] they talked together of all the things
[1:09:32] which had happened and it came to pass
[1:09:34] that while they communed together in
[1:09:35] reason Jesus himself Drew near and went
[1:09:39] with
[1:09:40] them you know why Jesus was able to draw
[1:09:42] near them they were not working they
[1:09:45] were just walking together they were
[1:09:48] traveling they had nothing on their
[1:09:50] minds something tremendous had just
[1:09:52] taken place there was nothing on their
[1:09:53] minds and what they were just walking
[1:09:55] together together and all their whole
[1:09:57] bodies their whole uh everything about
[1:09:59] them was consumed about this Jesus
[1:10:02] Christ all their heart their thoughts
[1:10:05] everything was like I thought he was
[1:10:06] supposed to be the
[1:10:09] one they were downtrodden they were sad
[1:10:12] they were all they were
[1:10:14] broken now
[1:10:17] look and it came to pass while they
[1:10:19] commune together and reason Jesus
[1:10:20] himself Drew near and went with them see
[1:10:24] SS of God that's why we're supposed to
[1:10:25] to talk about him all the time we're
[1:10:28] supposed to be thinking about him all
[1:10:29] the time what He will draw nigh to you
[1:10:32] he will come around you and what dwell
[1:10:35] within you we've got to have our minds
[1:10:37] and thoughts set on him yeah but now
[1:10:40] notice he says but their eyes were
[1:10:42] Holden that they should not know him and
[1:10:44] he said to him what manner of
[1:10:45] communications are these that you have
[1:10:47] one to another as you walk and are sad
[1:10:50] look at Jesus he's an actor he is
[1:10:54] literally putting on a
[1:10:56] show but notice he this was all ordained
[1:11:00] he was waiting this was he knew this was
[1:11:02] going to take place when he died on the
[1:11:04] cross and resurrected he knew people
[1:11:06] were his children his sheep were going
[1:11:08] to be consumed by him his memory the
[1:11:11] thoughts of him and everything notice
[1:11:13] why were they cons why were they
[1:11:14] concerned about some man that just hang
[1:11:15] on the cross there was something special
[1:11:17] about him he was the Messiah he was a
[1:11:20] prophet something big he was supposed to
[1:11:22] bring something a change amen right show
[1:11:25] and then now notice as they began to
[1:11:27] talk with him Jesus in what in his uh
[1:11:30] however you say his new body however he
[1:11:32] drew near to him appeared to them and he
[1:11:34] asked them a question what an actor talk
[1:11:38] about an
[1:11:41] actor he says what manner of
[1:11:43] communications are these that have said
[1:11:44] wonder why you why you as you walk why
[1:11:46] are you so sad what was he doing he was
[1:11:49] drawing out their heart he's drawing out
[1:11:52] their affection towards him they're
[1:11:53] drawing out in other words he wants
[1:11:55] wants them to confess what he was to
[1:11:57] them he wanted to know what you thought
[1:11:59] about him and what he was supposed to do
[1:12:02] notice he was in fact I this deep down
[1:12:04] in his heart he was so happy that they
[1:12:06] were sad why because they wanted to know
[1:12:09] they wanted to know why why did he leave
[1:12:12] I tell this one time I got a filling of
[1:12:13] the Holy Ghost and I was depressed for
[1:12:15] probably six months why because when
[1:12:16] you're in that presence of the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost and he comes down and he comes and
[1:12:20] fills you and joy and peace and just
[1:12:22] love and then all of a sudden you feel
[1:12:24] it leaving saints of God there's
[1:12:27] something oh I just we can't wait till
[1:12:30] we are fully in the presence of God for
[1:12:33] the rest of our lives for eternity to be
[1:12:36] stuck with him amen there's one place I
[1:12:39] want to be in his presence to live there
[1:12:41] daily all the time with him amen have
[1:12:44] you been there where the presence of God
[1:12:45] Amen where the Holy Ghost comes and it's
[1:12:47] joy unspeakable you shout you jump you
[1:12:50] praise God you can't even control it you
[1:12:52] can't stop all you say is I love you I
[1:12:54] love you love you amen
[1:12:58] yes and one of them whose name was Copus
[1:13:01] answered said to him art thou only a
[1:13:03] stranger in Jerusalem and H has th not
[1:13:05] noed the things which are come to pass
[1:13:06] in these days and he said look at him
[1:13:08] what
[1:13:09] things tell me more tell me more the
[1:13:13] husband says to the wife tell me about
[1:13:14] myself what do you expected me to do
[1:13:16] what do you think I was going to do
[1:13:17] absolutely I want to hear what your
[1:13:19] thoughts are how do you love me I
[1:13:20] thought well I know you heard about this
[1:13:22] and heard about that but what do you
[1:13:23] think about it amen and they said said
[1:13:25] unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth oh
[1:13:27] my goodness when when they said his
[1:13:30] name what I mean when when I was like
[1:13:32] this when John the Baptist when the when
[1:13:34] the womb of Elizabeth and he heard
[1:13:35] Jesus's name is sprung up to life and I
[1:13:38] wonder how Christ felt when they said
[1:13:40] Jesus of Nazareth oh my goodness that
[1:13:42] reflection his name bouncing off him
[1:13:45] back to them oh my goodness think about
[1:13:47] it this had to be such a joy to
[1:13:51] Christ yeah he says what things they
[1:13:56] said concerning Jesus of Nazareth which
[1:13:57] is a prophet Mighty in deed and word
[1:14:00] before God and all the people they
[1:14:02] literally exalted him he says he was the
[1:14:03] man he say and how the chief priests and
[1:14:06] the rulers delivered and be condemned to
[1:14:07] death and crucified but we trusted that
[1:14:11] it would have been he who should have
[1:14:13] redeemed Israel look at that they
[1:14:15] thought this they literally thought this
[1:14:17] is it we're going to be free Saints
[1:14:19] we're going to be free there's no more
[1:14:20] the Romans going to be gone this is
[1:14:22] we're going to be free Israel is going
[1:14:24] to become a ation freed again and we're
[1:14:26] going to have our rulers sit on the
[1:14:27] throne what with a rod of iron this is
[1:14:30] Christ this is Jesus this is the Messiah
[1:14:32] right that's what they
[1:14:35] thought and they speak out and they
[1:14:37] speak out but now notice how but notice
[1:14:39] as they thought about these things look
[1:14:42] how we rebuke
[1:14:45] them you know I'll say like
[1:14:48] this do we have a distorted view of
[1:14:52] Christ is Jesus just someone who like
[1:14:55] that'll let you say whatever you want to
[1:14:57] say is Jesus someone that's going to let
[1:14:59] you think whatever you want to
[1:15:01] think if you look at Christ when he's
[1:15:04] dealing with his disciples he rebuked
[1:15:07] them every single
[1:15:09] time why because the word has to set
[1:15:12] them in order a true shepherd with the
[1:15:16] staff which represented the word or the
[1:15:17] name of Jesus Christ has to keep the
[1:15:19] sheep in line remember he can't lose one
[1:15:23] so he's got to keep if this sheep's off
[1:15:25] or this sheep's off he's got to hey hey
[1:15:27] hey hey hey hey remember the Bible says
[1:15:29] about how how he had to break the or or
[1:15:31] or that Pro the parable talk about
[1:15:32] breaking the leg of the Lamb what
[1:15:34] because it went off this one kept
[1:15:36] wandering this one kept wandering so he
[1:15:37] had to break the lamb and the brother
[1:15:39] said oh that's kind of cruel he says no
[1:15:41] it's not it shows the shepherd really
[1:15:43] loved them amen absolutely and SS God a
[1:15:45] lot of times when we get off the will of
[1:15:46] God God will absolutely spank us he will
[1:15:50] chastise us harder than we think we
[1:15:52] ought to be
[1:15:53] chastised in fact oh man that was was
[1:15:55] really tough but here we are I like this
[1:15:58] another thing I was on my with my wife
[1:16:00] two months ago
[1:16:02] walking and I was frustrated with
[1:16:04] certain things going on and I was just
[1:16:06] venting to my wife we walking a dog in
[1:16:09] the darkness I said bth I said this this
[1:16:12] this and all of a sudden I sprained my
[1:16:15] right ankle and I was like Oh and it was
[1:16:17] good it was a it was a it was a rough
[1:16:18] one and you know what I kept doing I
[1:16:20] kept venting and I was like and I
[1:16:22] sprayed my left
[1:16:25] I thought I broke both my ankles I'm
[1:16:26] like oh I got work tomorrow and I look
[1:16:28] at my wife I said Beth I'm not going to
[1:16:31] say anything
[1:16:34] more you know what it took a month for
[1:16:36] those to heal up that's how bad it
[1:16:38] was but you know what he was teaching
[1:16:41] me because you have to control your
[1:16:47] mouth you wanted you want to vent about
[1:16:49] something go to
[1:16:52] prayer he will SP
[1:16:56] in ways you don't want to get
[1:16:58] spanked and I need these ankles to work
[1:17:01] I had to go to work and walk on ladders
[1:17:03] and this this with
[1:17:04] my every step you almost feel like it's
[1:17:06] going to go again
[1:17:08] right saints of
[1:17:10] God keep your mouth be in
[1:17:14] prayer now notice here closing here and
[1:17:18] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[1:17:20] he expounded unto them in all the
[1:17:23] scriptures and the things concerning
[1:17:25] himself he started preaching to him he
[1:17:28] started doing Bible study with them he
[1:17:30] started breaking down the word of God he
[1:17:32] was what revealing the word he was
[1:17:34] teaching them that this was see this
[1:17:37] remember back here this was that
[1:17:38] remember this back here in David
[1:17:39] remember David 22 David 24 David 25 uh
[1:17:42] David 30 David all he remember these
[1:17:44] things that's what it was and they're
[1:17:46] going who is
[1:17:51] this and as they drew nigh into the
[1:17:53] village
[1:17:55] with he they went he made those as he
[1:17:58] would have gone
[1:17:59] further but they constrained him saying
[1:18:01] abide with us for it is towards evening
[1:18:04] he says and the day is far spent and he
[1:18:06] went to T with them so notice what's the
[1:18:10] thing now look at this brother says
[1:18:14] 41664 so he turned around and said all
[1:18:16] right I'll go in so he got inside he
[1:18:19] says now that's the main
[1:18:22] thing whenever you hear something about
[1:18:24] the word and you're just like H and it
[1:18:26] draws you just invite Christ in with
[1:18:29] you invite him in remember that what was
[1:18:32] remember what was Matthew what was the
[1:18:34] Leo's thing I behold I stand at the door
[1:18:37] and
[1:18:38] knock you've got to invite him into what
[1:18:41] have communion what are they doing they
[1:18:42] said H there's something he knows a
[1:18:44] little bit more than we know let's
[1:18:45] invite him in I want to hear Lord what
[1:18:47] you I want to hear what this man has to
[1:18:50] say though you couldn't understand the
[1:18:53] word you it's too deep or something
[1:18:55] other you don't understand it you're
[1:18:57] full of in other
[1:18:59] words I've seen this
[1:19:02] firsthand well brother so and so is too
[1:19:04] deep so and so is this this preacher is
[1:19:07] this this preacher sints of
[1:19:08] God why is why is it too deep for
[1:19:13] you why are you not understanding these
[1:19:16] things why is it you know why because
[1:19:20] the wife is too
[1:19:23] busy you're too busy if you come in
[1:19:27] here and your mind's over there if your
[1:19:30] man's mind's out here if you're thinking
[1:19:32] about later tonight think tomorrow you
[1:19:33] are too busy you're too consumed it show
[1:19:35] that proves you're too consumed for side
[1:19:37] that's hard I know because I battle
[1:19:39] too but that proves you're too busy if
[1:19:42] you can't come here and focus on the
[1:19:45] word of God because remember brother
[1:19:47] said he say if you can get in the spirit
[1:19:49] he said you would receive things he said
[1:19:51] that's part of the key is receiving the
[1:19:53] word of God you know brother said he
[1:19:55] said he says when you heard acts 238 he
[1:19:57] says the reason you received acts 238 he
[1:19:59] says because you were in the spirit of
[1:20:01] the
[1:20:03] word what everything nothing was nothing
[1:20:06] is more important except what hearing
[1:20:08] the word you can literally be in Martha
[1:20:09] and enter into a merry
[1:20:11] mode absolutely Martha can be do this
[1:20:13] then it's thought as soon as it time to
[1:20:15] listen to the word Martha's
[1:20:19] like let me hear it right absolutely
[1:20:25] he says though you couldn't understand
[1:20:27] the word yeah it's too deep or something
[1:20:28] other you can't understand it you're so
[1:20:30] full of different Creeds and this one
[1:20:32] said that and this one said that your
[1:20:34] poor mind so you don't think what to so
[1:20:37] don't think what to think I'll tell you
[1:20:38] what to do just like they they did say
[1:20:41] come in Lord and abide with me tonight
[1:20:43] will you just come in and stay with me
[1:20:49] now and as it came to pass as he sat at
[1:20:53] meat with them he he took the bread and
[1:20:56] blessed it and break and gave it to
[1:20:59] them you know what the prophet God said
[1:21:00] he
[1:21:03] say as these two are walking down the
[1:21:05] road to
[1:21:07] Emmas Here Comes Christ and joins them
[1:21:10] with and the Bible says God withhold the
[1:21:12] eyes but why couldn't they see
[1:21:15] him why couldn't they see him because he
[1:21:17] held his ey their eyes right but when
[1:21:19] they he was not fully revealed to them
[1:21:22] not even in the house did they reveal
[1:21:24] right then but he had to do something
[1:21:26] that he did before at the
[1:21:29] communion once he took that bread it was
[1:21:32] time to eat that it was time to
[1:21:33] Fellowship time for communion we'll say
[1:21:35] like that and he took that bread and
[1:21:38] they were watching they said there's
[1:21:39] something different about him and as
[1:21:41] Jesus went and grabbed that piece of
[1:21:44] bread and he blessed it the way he said
[1:21:48] things the way he
[1:21:50] moved and then he broke it in such a way
[1:21:55] they knew that it was
[1:21:59] Christ by the moving I'll say this just
[1:22:01] say by the moving of the spirit they
[1:22:05] could tell now notice he already
[1:22:07] preached to them and they still didn't
[1:22:08] know him SS of God why have where are we
[1:22:11] at yet we've been here for 20 plus years
[1:22:13] 2015 20 10 whatever how where you're at
[1:22:15] in in life we've heard preaching we've
[1:22:18] had sermon after sermon what the
[1:22:20] breaking of the word and yet we still
[1:22:22] haven't recognized that he's fully here
[1:22:27] if we knew he was here tonight we'd have
[1:22:30] more response what we'd have more what
[1:22:33] more hunger for him absolutely we would
[1:22:35] have all we would know he's here and we
[1:22:36] what get in the spirit and start
[1:22:37] worshiping why because he's here Christ
[1:22:39] is here right now absolutely he says and
[1:22:43] their eyes were open they knew him and
[1:22:44] he vanished out of their sight and they
[1:22:46] said one to another did not our heart
[1:22:48] burn within us while he talked with us
[1:22:50] by the way and while he opened to us the
[1:22:52] scriptures so even though we sit here
[1:22:55] service after service and the word opens
[1:22:56] up wow wow there it is wow look at this
[1:22:59] Shadow watch watch this type wow look at
[1:23:01] it run all the way from here Genesis
[1:23:03] Revelations watch and look in the New
[1:23:04] Testament and Shadow right here in the
[1:23:05] old look at all these things but saints
[1:23:07] of God there's coming a time where we
[1:23:08] know he's going to be here he's going to
[1:23:11] reveal himself
[1:23:13] here because he did that back then but
[1:23:17] look at the condition of the people
[1:23:19] brother said he said there's one quote
[1:23:20] he says it's going to look like the
[1:23:22] message has failed
[1:23:24] remember that quote he says it looks
[1:23:26] like it's going to have failed Brothers
[1:23:28] we sit at this church no one's getting
[1:23:32] filled with the Holy Ghost and we're
[1:23:33] waiting for the Holy Ghost to come down
[1:23:35] and man I'm so tired I'm exhausted the
[1:23:39] Bible said they that wait on the Lord he
[1:23:41] says what God will renew their strength
[1:23:43] Like an
[1:23:44] Eagle wait on God don't try to produce
[1:23:47] it yourself don't try don't try to
[1:23:49] produce it but what wait on God and he
[1:23:51] will send the anointing amen let's stand
[1:23:54] here by God's grace I've been a little
[1:24:05] longer God let the people tonight though
[1:24:08] they don't understand the Scriptures it
[1:24:10] may be a riddle to them just let each
[1:24:13] one say then Lord Jesus you who are
[1:24:16] present come and abide with me I have
[1:24:18] need amen now this obviously wasn't a
[1:24:21] deep service but saints of God there's
[1:24:23] certain things we are still Lord God is
[1:24:27] this right is this right is this right
[1:24:29] Lord God continue to give us Revelation
[1:24:31] and understanding on the word of God
[1:24:34] there's confusion all around the message
[1:24:36] even complete all kinds of different
[1:24:39] ideas but what is the truth right we
[1:24:42] want to know the full truth and I
[1:24:43] believe the Holy Ghost will bring it at
[1:24:45] its time right I found a quote about a
[1:24:49] year and a half ago brother Ram said he
[1:24:50] says all these doctrinal disputes he
[1:24:52] says will be solved when p cost
[1:24:58] comes amen All Hearts Minds clear saints
[1:25:02] of God let me read more scripture you
[1:25:04] the the musicians when you come up play
[1:25:05] here a little bit
[1:25:10] softly in 2 Corinthians
[1:25:13] 3:6 who also ha made us able Ministers
[1:25:16] of the New Testament not of the letter
[1:25:19] but of the spirit for the letter kth but
[1:25:22] the spirit giveth life
[1:25:26] see the spirit giveth life when you sit
[1:25:29] in a service we should be so in tune
[1:25:31] with the preaching of the word by with
[1:25:33] what the spirit is saying that it
[1:25:34] becomes alive to us it gives us life it
[1:25:36] gives us
[1:25:41] strength he says how shall not the
[1:25:44] ministration of the spirit be rather
[1:25:46] glorious than the Old Testament thans of
[1:25:48] God in this day this word is powerful
[1:25:51] this Revelation that received is what
[1:25:53] life
[1:25:56] giving I taught in uh nvar on
[1:26:08] Sunday I said uh what did they
[1:26:14] say I said we have to ask for
[1:26:17] Revelation more than
[1:26:20] anything
[1:26:22] reality SS of God my mind goes back to
[1:26:25] that woman that I met that Japanese
[1:26:27] woman she prayed five hours a day for
[1:26:31] months and then she started hearing the
[1:26:33] voice of God and the voice of God told
[1:26:36] her what to do every
[1:26:39] day that's what we need we need more
[1:26:42] communion with
[1:26:44] him but what what do we have to do I
[1:26:47] don't know if I put this in here
[1:26:57] I didn't put the quote in here you know
[1:27:00] what he said brother Ram said he says
[1:27:01] we're too
[1:27:03] busy we're so filled with the cares and
[1:27:06] concerns of the
[1:27:08] life that literally we might start the
[1:27:11] day out right and finish the day out
[1:27:12] right but what about in
[1:27:14] between we're supposed to walk in the
[1:27:18] spirit not just wake up in the spirit
[1:27:20] and go to sleep in the spirit but we're
[1:27:22] supposed to walk in the spirit the holy
[1:27:24] spirit of God Amen how many want to walk
[1:27:27] in the spirit of God how many want his
[1:27:29] guidance and protection how many want
[1:27:30] his Revelation given us through every
[1:27:32] day what we have need of Amen praise the
[1:27:35] Lord let's just bow our
[1:27:38] heads dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you
[1:27:41] and Lord God lord sorry Lord for a
[1:27:43] little cut up service Lord Lord Jesus
[1:27:45] Lord just one of your little ones here
[1:27:47] just trying to do you uh trying to yield
[1:27:49] to your spirit God the very thought you
[1:27:51] gave me but Lord God in my heart the dep
[1:27:54] of My Heart Lord I want to become less
[1:27:57] busy Lord I want Time Lord I want to
[1:28:00] take I want to make time to listen to a
[1:28:04] service every day to study your word
[1:28:08] thoroughly God not just read a chapter
[1:28:10] not just read two chapters but Lord
[1:28:12] study it every
[1:28:15] day Lord Jesus Lord in the Bible says
[1:28:17] the bereans were most more noble than
[1:28:19] than the rest for they uh studied the
[1:28:21] word with all ready Readiness of mind
[1:28:24] they were addicted to the ministry Lord
[1:28:26] Lord Jesus this we have to come up
[1:28:28] higher we have to come to a spot God
[1:28:30] lord where you are life and all the rest
[1:28:33] is death Lord Jesus Lord to where Lord
[1:28:36] we don't care about what takes place in
[1:28:38] our lives have we won a soul have we
[1:28:41] been pleasing to our
[1:28:44] husband Lord and I know you want us to
[1:28:46] do our little things but Lord God is not
[1:28:49] your business the the kingdom the
[1:28:52] father's business more important God
[1:28:54] than all
[1:28:56] things are not we supposed to be
[1:28:58] concerned about the house of God the
[1:29:00] spiritual House of God before even our
[1:29:01] natural
[1:29:04] house you know the scripture says Lord
[1:29:06] Jesus
