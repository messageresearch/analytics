========================================

second Samuel chapter 6. verse 14 II Samuel 6 verse 14. I'd like to preach part five on praise Jesus's name in the dance second Samuel chapter 6. 6 14. second Samuel 6 verse 14 praise God let's just read verse 14 together and then I'm going to read 15 16 and 17 but let's read 14 with one voice let's begin on three one two three and David danced before the Lord with all his might and David was girded with a linen ephod remember the linen ephod was a priest garment it was that outward garment that actually had the urum and thumb on it I showed a picture of it not long ago so here's David as a priest and we know he was already King right and we know he also was a prophet so this is David becoming Prophet priest and King over the Ark of the Covenant and over the Tabernacle of the lord we would say in fact this has been a time where it's been called The Tabernacle of David before it was a tabernacle of Moses and here becomes the Tabernacle of David praise God verse 15. so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David McCall Saul's daughter looked through a window and saw David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart now notice it doesn't call him a call David's wife in this location in this scripture see how it's differentiating her she's not being spiritual this moment she's being carnal so it doesn't say McCall David's wife it says McCall Saul's daughter verse 17 and they brought in the ark of the Lord and set it in his place notice his place so the ark is given a male designation set in his place in the midst of the Tabernacle that David had pitched for it and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord amen may God add His blessings to the Ring of his word you may be seated by God's grace I have a few uh slides to show here by God's grace so I'd like to look at part five I'm using that former picture that I used with uh the the Mount Zion series and we looked at Mount Zion a couple years ago if I'm not mistaken I'd like to continue on this thought of Praise Jesus name and the dance now just so you know our brother this might be new to brother Austin certainly probably sister Nina and brother Chris but um in Jerusalem the very center of Jerusalem or the very focus of God's capital of Jerusalem our two main mountains well three main mountains here you have Mount olives that's where Jesus prayed you know he prayed on the Mount of Olives before he his crucifixion and uh Mount Moriah of course this is where the current Muslim Shrine is but this is where the House of David would have been the House of David would have been here and then the Tabernacle of David would have been here Mount Zion is the the actually the city it's The Old City which is right next to Mount Moriah but in general yeah just my brother in general this whole this whole location here is is called Mount Zion in general yeah brother Chris do you have a question yeah so I preached on that were you here when I preached on that when I uh when I showed it let me see if I can find it real quick so the Tabernacle Moses set up a tabernacle and then uh David brought the Tabernacle here to Jerusalem I know I preached out it recently let me see if I got the picture here I thought you were here when I taught it but it had been a few been a little bit here let me see if I can find it real quick Tabernacle yes this was the tabernacle but let me see if I can so this was the tabernacle uh that Moses set up and of course remember two million people surround all there's two million Israelites and they all came out of Egypt and God actually called them out to start a church because the church means they called out people and so once they got out of Egypt in the wilderness then God had Moses established the Tabernacle this is a place of God's dwelling so yeah is that first time for me okay and so there's three courts remember you had the outer Court here where they sacrificed the animals that represent Jesus's death on the cross then you had the holy place so this is this is justification you're forgiven sanctification you get ready to go into the last place is the prince of gods that's where the presence of God would fall okay so does that sound familiar good brother praise God and so David took uh parts of this that's we're going to get to tonight he didn't take all of this but David took parts of this to Jerusalem so this is out in the wilderness but the Tabernacle was was in in transition it was transitioning from the Wilderness to Jerusalem and uh and then you know of course then you know after David then you had the Temple of Solomon I'd like to preach on that again this year or not again but preach it for the first time this year so uh now here let me yeah since I'm here it's actually probably pretty good it's time to show this okay so when David set it up you know this this would be Mount Moriah of course and then this is the lower parts of that this is coming down that hill this would have been Mount Zion over here and so remember remember this when David took the city you know Joshua never took Jerusalem because it was a stronghold but it was David who finally took Mount Zion and they got there through the secret place the the secret passage praise God and Hallelujah that's a beautiful type of the secret works you know secret prey secret fasting uh Secret almsgiving so you you you you possess this location through the secret place Hallelujah dwelling in the secret place with Christ oh it's a beautiful time I preached a couple years ago not real fresh on it tonight but um anyways now this is Solomon's Temple brother but when David was here they didn't have the this they didn't have like this huge bill or this massive building they had just the tents like I showed you on the other picture okay so this is the times of Solomon where they actually had the temple built so um so I'm not I'll preach on that later but I'll actually I'm going to Lord willing close tonight's service with that thought so that's kind of where we're going bro so does that help by God's grace all right yeah thank you brother no those are great questions and you know I guess I got some other pictures look at it as well yeah here's another shot at it uh for Solomon's day you know this is from the south looking North okay so this is the Mount of Olives this is Mount Moriah and then this is Mount Zion but the whole thing altogether was called Mount Zion just because it's the general term it means the elevated place the high place Hallelujah all right so that's Solomon's Temple and this is called the city of David of course we're the king king would live and uh the people here okay so let me get back to where I was going here all right so yeah we started here uh with praise His name in the dancing I kind of want to build up eventually look a little bit closer at David's uh bringing the ark into the city of David praise God Jerusalem okay so David brought it here so this is where David would have brought the ark he would have brought it here because this would have been where the the Tabernacle of Moses which now would have been the Tabernacle of David would have been established all right praise God okay so we read our text now before getting into that I just want to go over this uh this thought because this is you know David bringing the ark is a type of the church having Revival okay uh there's also there's a numerous typesuit as well I I typed it also to the rapture I don't know if you remember that but we're supposed to have a Mount Zion Showdown how many remember that from spoken words Original Seed brother man preached on that um and so I just want to read this first I I plan to preach this in part two of this series but I never got to it so you know David's ark or David David bringing the ark to uh the position is a type of Revival okay so it's like when we would leave our first love and then God would bring us back to our first love so our first love is when we're first Saved or we're first filled with the Holy Ghost we're total obedience to God In Love With God meditating on God all the time but then we leave that because we go through trials and temptations right and we're not drawn away by uh God we're drawn away by our own lust the Bible says we get enticed and then lust lust gets less conceives and then we sin and then the end of sin is death but before that death stage praise God God brings us repentance hallelujah amen God doesn't let us die amen because we've already passed from Death unto life amen thank God so see out of those four steps a real Christian only gets to the third step they never get to the fourth because God brings them back amen he brings them back to their first love amen hallelujah thank God Amen what a blessing now brother Adam I got a little bit of reading to do so bear with me brother Ram you know is preaching on Revelation 2 verse 4. nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love and church we all do it so this is a sermon for everybody this applies to everybody everybody should be able to say Amen at some point right because we all fall short of God's glory to understand this leaving the first love you must realize that spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message is into the entire age which lasted about 120 years and just a side note this year 2023 is a hundred and uh it's the same length as the Ephesian Church age just so you know there's some people that have said oh the laosian church a is going to be the shortest age well guess what they're wrong they're wrong because now it's the same and there's never there's never a scripture for that to begin with so see it was all human presumption and how to look now they look like fools that's why I'm a real man of God won't go that far now if he does he'll say this is my own opinion he won't make it an absolute thing right now pick him back up its message then is to all the generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival one generation only to see the fires fading in the next right now Church really I'm like a third generation from Brother Branham right because brother random uh would be like a hundred and something by now he'd be like let's see 100 uh 122. he'd be I think 122. I'm not mistaken no 100 uh 12. brother Brown would be 112. right now so his son is about 65 or something like that Joseph so that's like the age of my dad my dad's 72. so so just think about that now brother his his generation had a genuine Holy Ghost Revival and the church said remember I showed you at least six six kinds of revivals remember I showed you that I might preach at brother cams that might be a help to them right and so the next generation is responsible to have the same Holy Ghost Revival if they don't then they've failed the grace of God right but see here now you know each generation has to have Revival so I would be in the the we say that maybe the second generation after brother Branham right and then my children guess what you're the third generation right see that so we see uh one generation having Revival but the fires fade in the next in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no Vestige whatsoever of that original Flame now look I'm the third generation so I don't want to be just a slightly glowing Ember I want to be a fire that everybody can see I want to have a burning fire experience where the fire of God is burning in my life praise God now say like this it burns up sin praise God amen hallelujah and church I believe that I believe I am a burning fire because I can listen to brother random sermons and I can hear how they go and you have different kinds of sermons some are Revival servants some are just teaching sermons right sudden there's loud shouts other there's not and so there's a variety right and that's what we have today we have a variety of some Services people Shout Scream dance praise the Lord other ones are just more hot a quiet more humble repentance type of sermons seeking God type of sermons so I believe I'm not just a small Ember I believe I've got a real fire praise God I believe I've been faithful in my generation to the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God right I know for sure compared to my mom in the denominational generation my wife's uh family you know their denominational experience we know we can tell our lives are on fire for Jesus praise God amen right we can see the fires burning in our generation but sometime it's going to be Lydia Malachi's generation they've got to have the same fire praise God same devotion remember Jesus said you never decrease your works you increase your works praise God the last works are greater than the first Works amen oh Hallelujah so he goes to the fourth generation isn't that interesting because now we're kind of the fourth generation Malachi and Lydia your generation is the fourth generation then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than is there any truth to Apostolic succession Hallelujah so each person has to have their own experience with God each person has to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost has to go in that third court with the temp with the Tabernacle right outer core inner core holiest of holies each person must go in the presence of God and experience the fire of God the voice of God they must have an experience with Christ themselves it isn't in the word you start out with Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but now they've taken a denominational name and are now Baptist methodists Etc I'm gonna stop right there a lot of tape churches are are denominations like they were contacting me this week some of the guys and not the pastor but and they were saying they were saying Christ Our Joseph that's what they say Christ Our Joseph the great prophet is here that's what they call them because they believe he's filled with the Holy Ghost and Brother Joseph is a major prophet that's what they say friends that is an absolute denomination because they say there's no mistakes on the tapes and I said I got a video with 70 mistakes on the tapes I said the only way you say there's no mistakes on the tapes is if you're insane and you have the spirit of idolatry and you have the Antichrist Spirit on you and it all goes back to what is the message the message is not a bunch of tapes the message is the scriptures God has fulfilled and is fulfilling right now praise God because Revelation 10 7 is already fulfilled but we're not Revelation 10 7. we're Revelation 10 8 9 10 and 11 praise God that's what's God doing right now we're eating the book church at least we ought to be eating the book praise God I'm eating the book I'm eating the Bible praise God I'm feasting on the revelations in the Bible Hallelujah see that's what we're doing so Revelation 10 7 is fulfilled but we're moving on and that's the message the message is the scriptures God is doing right now but the tape church I believe is an absolute denomination and they have a denominational name they call themselves Tate churches that's exactly what they are too they're not Christians now I believe some of them are Christians but I don't know how many only God knows because to say brother Branham is infallible that's idolatry and to not correct that proves you do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right see church we have to be born out of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore now church we can take a lesson from that and we've got to look at our lives and that's why I like listening to sermons from last year or years ago are you are you are you and I the same or not am I the same preacher or not Hallelujah and see we either go we either get closer to God we either grow closer to God or we backslide Hallelujah I believe I'm closer to God now than I was back then praise God but each one of us have to look at that are we on fire now at less or more than last year right I don't mean that just because we pass into the new year I'm not talking like last week I'm talking about just you know last year like last January 2022 so you have to make sure we don't leave our first love and we got to say devoted to Christ and keep the fire burning Saints amen Hallelujah kind of hot in here can you go turn down the heat Malachi just turn it down to 62. because with all the bodies in here it warms up around it's a little uncomfortable to me now look here it is there's three things now I usually put this on a list but I didn't have time today the fervent desire to please God here's how you know you're at your first love you have a fervent desire to please God you have a passion to know his word that means read your Bible pray listen to sermons you want to know more about the word and you have the cry for reaching out in the spirit you want the spirit to move amen you want more of the spirit in your life praise God oh God dude pour out great blessings Amen in other words you're pleading with Heaven praise God so those three things will prove that you are still on fire you you've got your first love praise God I'm talking about in your mind now not your soul and your mind right because if you're born again that that seal your soul is sealed to the day of redemption see now church we can't let our fire for God fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God is cooled off and become a bit formal that's why it's good to dance around the church right so it's not so formal like every service is the same we stand up we sing three songs we sit down we listen to a sermon we all stand up and pray we leave it shouldn't be formed not every service is the same like sometimes I call you up to pray I might do that tonight you never know I don't know we'll kind of see how you feel that how we feel led by the Holy Spirit we might dance tonight we might not it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God now there's nothing wrong with setting out a dance service nothing wrong with that there's nothing out with nothing wrong with setting aside a prayer service or a Divine Healing service there's nothing wrong with that but the reality of it is we can't have a formal attitude we got to get past well we're just coming to church it's more than that we're coming in the presence of God Amen we're reaching out in the spirit for God do more tonight praise God see it's like it's a it's a fervent desire it's a seeking of God yeah so it's it's that's what it is this is the first love I'm passionate about God's word amen I really want to please God and I want the spirit to move tonight praise God Hallelujah church I believe a lot of you have done a great job of that praise God I believe a lot of you have done a great job of that because we've had such wonderful meetings here these last few months I mean all year but you know it goes up and down right right we go through battles I go through battles you go through battle we all go through battles but consistently we're you know we always come back praise God amen he said this that is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them member Church never really care about what the world thinks about you so much care about what God thinks about you and the way to know is talk to God right spend time with God you should feel you see you should have a passion for the word that's how you know you feel good good toward God God I want more of your word give me more of your Revelation give me more of your understanding I want more of you not like I'm going to hide from you that's like Adam and Eve when they sin right hiding from God I don't want to get in the presence of God I don't want to spend time with God that's when we know we left our first love and instead of running from God we should run to God that's how you get your first love back amen that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like the other nations see we don't want to be like other message churches we want to be like the book of Acts amen so that's how you know we're on fire we're not looking to other churches to be our pattern we want to be like the book of Acts and we're making steps to be like the book of Acts amen Hallelujah when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that's the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do and start doing the things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior now we've seen people coming here they didn't change their dress when they fell away they just changed their behavior right they still dress holy they didn't wear tank tops they didn't wear short shorts or short skirts the men didn't wear short shorts they still wear pants but they change their behavior and their attitude toward the word of God see they get lacks they get lazy see they don't want to pray or they don't want to please God fervently they don't have a passion for his word they're lazy towards the word and they don't reach out in the spirit they say well if the spirit moves tonight that's okay if it doesn't that's fine either way our attitude should be we we really want to see the spirit move praise God and I'm gonna do everything in my power to help the spirit moving in other words make myself a sacrifice Hallelujah sacrifice my ideas sacrifice my body and give give God every fiber of my being Hallelujah that's what Ephesians means it means relax and drifting the cycle of Revival and death has never let's say never never see that's why this is going to be a constant part of our Lives if you don't know it already there's going to be season you feel like you're dying so you've got you got to say God sit and send me Revival give me a Revival it's it's just Cycles we're going to go through it I feel like I go through on a weekly weekly basis up and down up and down like I said it gets more challenging because I'm getting a little older you know all you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dress like Christians went to church prayed all night took the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches in Worship in the homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build find new churches they put in a choir listen instead of singing to God for themselves in other words you sing for me I want to sit back and listen no God wants you to sing all of you are in the choir Hallelujah that's right I'm in the choir we're all part of the bride of Christ Fellowship choir amen they organize the movement and ran it by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read now for us it might not be books it might be websites right or apps see they do things they they should not have done they let down the bar so see you had bars set up I'm not going to leave this I'm going to stay in this place with God but then they let down the bars and let things come in and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone Hallelujah see what does Joy relate to Joy relates to dancing right rejoicing dancers are rejoicing thing the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that's left so see we want to fire and church we realize that you know we got to come here and we've actually got to get in the spirit it takes a while to build up a fire right it takes a while you got to build it up especially if the wind's blowing you got to have a lot of dead things you got to have dry things it takes a while and so we come to church and we've got to just stay in the atmosphere we got to keep adding the logs on there and pretty soon if we're just in that atmospheric church we'll have a nice burden fire here praise God that's my brother Adam that's what he would do he would preach until there was a climax and that's when they pray for the sick when the fire is at its hardest amen when the fire's at its hottest that's when you bring the prayer requests up amen Hallelujah that's what I want to do I want to preach until it's like a fire and then let's call the sick up then praise God Hallelujah that's what I need to grow in as well but see that's what we're doing we're gonna we gotta you know press out of our minds you know out of the cares of the world we got to come in the presence of God we got to build up that fire we got to have a passion to know his word amen uh fervent desire to please him Hallelujah and cry out for the Holy Spirit to move amongst us praise God amen Hallelujah and then Brother Band said a few moments ago did I skip one okay no a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose their their love first John 5 3 says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments okay see so the passion to know his word uh that's that's wanting to hear more of the word but the fervent desire to please him that's the obedience he's talking about here that first part of those three aspects of being on fire I'm going to obey the word of God I'm going to do everything in my power to obey the word of God now you're getting on fire praise God now you're getting back to your first love I'm not gonna pull down the bars so I can let this sin in I'm going to fight that sin off I'm going to put the bars up I'm going to ask God to be a wall to protect me from that I'm going to stay behind God's fortification amen see now you know you're on fire praise the Lord hallelujah I think that's the last one yeah one little deviation from that word listen was a step away from Christ see so one little thing like uh just press play one little deviation have brother Branham preach instead of a living preacher one deviation is a step away from Christ right or one deviation there's no dancing in the church or there's there's no speaking in tongues in the church right there's no uh there's no Liberty there's no clapping in the church you know whatever whatever man-made Creed they put forth it stifles the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit wants to move God wants to be worshiped amen God came here to worship God Amen we came here to glorify God we came here to stay on fire Hallelujah this is the house of the Lord amen this is the glory of the Lord this is the presence of God God is here amen God's here to bless you God's here to strengthen you God's here to answer prayers amen how many times has God answer a prayer here many times right sometimes right after service brother right out there we go and pray in there somebody's right up here God answers right here amen it's God's spirit see that's why I'm so blessed by our church now can we groan it yes but I'm thankful I know we're on fire praise God hallelujah that's right I'm not a second generation message believer I'm not a third generation now naturally I am but I'm a first generation child of God I'm a first generation Church of the firstborn amen amen not second born I'm Church of the firstborn amen I believe the same gospel of Paul preach amen I've had the same experience Paul had amen I met Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost amen I didn't see a vision like like the pillar of fire I felt like I saw a vision when I got the Holy Ghost though a vision of the Cross what else could have been Hallelujah but I preached the same word we live the same truth we're growing in Grace and knowledge of the Lord we're looking at the glory of God the Bible said and we're being changed in that Glory from glory to glory amen like that sign I have at my house we don't change the message the message changes us praise God right wasn't last month the first Services we've had where we have dance and services are we changing less like the word or more like the word more like the word amen see after what after 16 years of service see we're becoming more free we're becoming more like the word of God more like the book of Acts more like real worshipers see we're growing into it all the time we're not falling away we're actually pressing in the violent take the kingdom of God by force amen Hallelujah oh it's beautiful teachers we can see ourselves grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord let's see one little deviation steps away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout and I hear they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time when it's all over watch and see if they're in that word walking in it living in it see now this is what a lot of Pentecostals have now a few message churches have that right where they actually have free worship but are they living the word when they go home so see we want both how many want great emotional times of shouting and rejoicing I do I don't want to come to church to be a a depression party I don't want to pass my depression on to you I want to pass my joy on to you amen I'm going to pass my strength unto you praise God just like a body I want to pass the oxygen I want to pass the life-giving resource amen I want life to flow from me to you amen or vice versa Hallelujah right where we strengthen each other where life flows through the body we keep each other alive we keep strengthening each other praise God we pray for one another we intercede for one another Hallelujah we provoke one another unto good works amen Gloria I love this he says they say they love God but their lives tell another story May our lives at home tell the same story that we tell the church Hallelujah Glory that's right he said I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they love God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian Church something is happening to you someone is trying to either add to the word or take from it but they're doing it so subtly that you can't see it they haven't made a move so big you can see it out there in the open it's undercover and they're bringing it by way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late amen hallelujah let's all say praise the Lord can we praise the Lord amen see Church it's like that diesel nickel Aid and some whatever the sin is it always starts as a saying well this is what we do or this is what we say and if it's a false saying that's what it is it's a decent nicolatum then it becomes uh something the preacher preaches all the time right and then it becomes the unbending way right and the Bible said Jesus hates the Deeds of the Nicolaitans but brother Brown says Jesus hates powerless religion so what do we need we need a religion that's got power in it power to clean our lives amen power to make us Shout power to make us dance amen power to heal the sick Hallelujah power to give us dreams and visions and prophecies amen power to tell the future praise God amen power to discern power to to to give words of knowledge words of wisdom power do Miracles see religion God loves a religion with power in it praise God amen that's what I love writing out testimonies and I go back and see you you know sometimes the enemy fights me in they say he says you do too much teaching that's what I like to make a list of all the times the power of God has moved I'm making a pretty good list right now I started this week at home I'm making a pretty good list of all the testimonies where I know God moved there I know the power of God moved on that person I know God see because uh I just want to remember the Bible says sir up your minds by way of remembrance not not not to dwell on those but just as an encouragement God is with me God is with you amen and so God wants power in our religion Hallelujah thank you Lord like the last time was when I was dancing with the headache and I told you I had a headache my headache was throbbing I think it was part two my head was throbbing with this headache and I said I'll just praise God no matter I'll Just Dance even if I got a headache by then a service the headache was gone now that doesn't rarely happen right usually I got to go to bed with a headache or something like that hey right really I don't get well yeah sometimes I'll have headaches for weeks on end because I'm not sleeping enough that's my thought but there I got a headache during service and I preach the word of God I dance and worship Jesus I get in the spear and the headache's gone praise God that's never happened before for me so it shows God it has power in this Holy Ghost religion praise God amen Glory so yes I preached many sermons with headaches and God then has answered numerous uh numerous requests even though I have a headache right but see God keeps showing us more and more there's power in this word there's power in this word just stay dedicated God's teaching us lessons Hallelujah everything has a time and season praise God God makes everything beautiful in his time praise God the best things are yet to come praise God amen Hallelujah because the Rapture is yet to come Hallelujah the body changes yet to come thank God now I want to look at history of the Ark now let me put the picture up there of the Ark so brother Chris can see it so have you seen that before brother right so Noah's Ark was a boat that's a good the same word Arc right it's a box right like a box but this is the ark that was in that third room in the holiest of holies and this represents the presence of God okay so we sang we sing that song right before commune with me commune means to talk right so we say that song come in with me between the wings of the cherubim so God told Moses I will talk to you from right in the middle of those angels and God did God talked with Aaron in between those I don't know if he talked to Moses I don't think Moses went in there I have to look that one up but this is in other words this was the prince of God okay so I want to look at that here now I got the let's look at the history of the Ark so page 264. I was studying here uh I'm going to use this as just a quick reference here so the Ark of the Covenant there's 30 minutes already where'd that time go now the ark started of course in the days of Moses and when Moses set up the Tabernacle Brother inside of it Moses put three things he put the stone tables of the law that had the Ten Commandments on it he put Manna which was Heavenly Angel bread okay and then he put a budding rod in Almond branch okay and each one represented something for us today okay the law represents God writing the law on our hearts because the Bible said God writes the word on the fleshly tables of our hearts okay so see when we get born again God writes the word on your heart okay second the Manna represents the bread of life because Jesus said I am the bread of life that come down from heaven he said give us this day our daily bread so the Manna represents the fresh word of God that you get every day on your spiritual journey hallelujah praise God so God writes it permanently in your heart but then also God gives you fresh Manna every single day Hallelujah oh my that's so true amen isn't that true I mean it's amazing you can listen to a sermon you've heard so many times but then something will come out it'll pop out like ah I forgot about there ah I need that for today praise God like I was listening to leadership brother Graham's last sermon you know he did a communion taping but it wasn't a sermon in brotherbraham's last sermon he said this may be my final message before I die right and it just stuck out to me like wow and brother Branham is hammering on getting born again the baptism Holy Ghost don't get it on just your your body and your mind get it in the soul praise God it says last message and he said this may be my last message praise God it's beautiful and he was so sincere just bringing down the word to the people it's more than a church experience don't be a church be a bride Hallelujah right A lot of people could get called out but not everybody goes all the way to the promised land let's go all the way to the promised land amen Hallelujah so Moses brother oh yeah I'm sorry the last one was the rod the rod represents a resurrected life because the Almond Branch was dead brother but when they put it in the holies of holies the next day they went in and it brought back to life and it had almonds fresh almonds on it so it's a dead branch that came back to life that represents how we are new creatures in Christ Jesus yes I were born again yes good Hallelujah from Death unto life the Bible says we were dead in our sins remember Ephesians chapter 2 we're dead in our sins and trespasses but God has quick enough or made us alive okay so written upon the heart it's your daily bread also and it's also uh here uh what's the last one oh a resurrected life he's resurrected he's given you you were dead but now you're alive praise God now I just want to briefly Trace through the history Moses had of course when he finished the Tabernacle this was the meeting place between the Lord and Moses and uh I want to skip down here yeah here let me look at some of the names here yeah here I'm just going to do a quick list here's about uh 12 names here of the Ark here it's called the Ark of the testimony because I had the testimony of the word of God in there the law it's called the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord Covenant is the the promise or the oath God made with Israel it's called the Ark of the Lord God it's called the Ark of the Lord God the Lord of all the Earth it's called The Ark of God it's called The Holy Ark it's called The Ark of thy strength amen amen oh think about that isn't there strength in the law of God's word isn't there strength in a resurrected life praise God isn't there strength in your daily bread Hallelujah the Ark of God's strength oh I love it it's called Eight the Ark of the Covenant of God as ninth is called the Ark of the Covenant tenth is called the Ark of the Lord 11th is called the Ark of the god of Israel and last is called the Ark of shittenwood it's right there's 12 names 12. number of it number of uh tribes isn't that interesting there's 12 names there Hallelujah now a church member of the Ark say with Moses until Joshua then the ark took Joshua into the promised land crossing the Jordan the ark opened up the way the prince of God will always open up the way for us you know the prince of God will go before you and it will prepare the way for you that's right next they took the ark and circled Jericho praise God and Jericho fell now the ark only had to lost that one time there at the beginning when they when Aiken had to sit in the camp right but then they got the sin out and they got the victory Hallelujah and then the ark was positioned between Mount evil the Mount of cursing and mount garazim the Mount of blessing we preach on that in Joshua chapter eight it's been a long time but remember remember they were camped on both sides of the mountain and they were they were citing they were reciting the law to both sides blessing if you do this curse if you do that it's been a while since I preached that one so I don't expect you to remember that one that was Joshua chapter eight but then church the ark went to gilgall when the land was divided right with Joshua Joshua 9 6. then the ark went to Shiloh in Joshua 18 then the ark went to Chic gem in Joshua 24. and then the ark went back to Shiloh again even in the days of the judges now in the days of the judges the ark went in captivity to the Philistines it was taken out of Shiloh at the Battle of afek and Ebenezer and then the ark went to the house of Dagon remember the the Dagon God fell before the ark ah Hallelujah God always makes and every enemy fall at his feet praise God then the ark went to gath that was Goliath place right Gas City then the ark went to Akron but there was plagues and death at ekron but the ark was still in the hand of the Gentiles but then the ark was at Beth shamesh returned on a new cart uh with a trespass offering of the Philistines but the men of shabesh were slain looking for for looking into the ark and 50 000 70 people died because they looked into the ark they tried to touch that resurrected life when they weren't they weren't ordained to do that so you got to be ordained to go in the presence of God right and then the ark was at courageath jerion for 20 years and the Ark was possibly at gibea for a short time under Saul's reign now when Once then the art got back to cure Jeff jirim and David fetched for the ark but he brought it on a new cart right and then the oxen stumbled that now look at the Beast can't handle look beasts aren't made to handle the word of God right but that's what we got today a bunch of Beast preachers right we got a bunch of lion preachers false Doctrine preaching teachers right money hungry preachers what are they the bunch of beasts the Bible says the Bible says they are brewed beasts they have eyes full of adultery and they cannot cease from sinning praise God they are addicted to sin and the Bible calls them beasts and see beasts were trying to carry the ark God never required peace God said let men do it amen let men carry the word on their shoulders praise God Amen because it's right above their heart amen right their hearts right under that it's above their heart right see they're holding the word of God the prince of God is near to their hearts okay and so then remember David didn't know what to do so the ark went to the house of Obed Edom for three months and God blessed his house for three months God's presence will always bless your house Hallelujah Church you just bring God's presence in your house and God will bless it praise God bring the word into your house and watch the Holy Spirit bless your house in ways you can't even describe Hallelujah right but then three months later David finally understood how to do it now I want to read the verses to get to this point eventually I'm going to get to this point when David brought the ark he didn't bring the whole Tabernacle with him he just brought the ark and the tent he did not bring that animal sacrifices with him now we know it said he was sacrificed to animals but the Bible said they left the the Brazen Altar and other things they left that at another location gibia okay so this will tie in eventually here if I can ever get to the end of the sermon here now go to First chronicles 16 38 let's go there first chronicles 16 38. and church there's a real spiritual reason why the Tabernacle was divided I'm going to try to get close with that hopefully God's Great something you could probably see it it was I'm sorry first chronicles 16 38. first chronicles 16 38 it's right after second uh first and second Kings and chronicles kings Kings Chronicles first chronicles 16 38 Lydia you gotta can you read that okay all right now go to First Chronicles 21 29 just a few pages yeah there it is look at this church for the Tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon so see now you have a divided Temple right or Tabernacle the Tabernacle is divided so it looks like you have the Brazen altar at gibeon where they sacrifice animals but then the holy place and the voice of holies was at Jerusalem amen now I'm not Zion amen oh it's gonna it's gonna come into play eventually so just bear with me here I think you'll see it by God's grace that's a beautiful thought I wondered about this for at least a couple years since I preached this okay so you can see now that's where we are here now let me give you the rest of the history now of course uh after David died Solomon built a temple I want to preach on that hopefully this year I had a request to preach on that my brother Paul actually asked me to preach on that and I've actually wanted to and so I bought a book on it um so Solomon of course uh brings the Ark in the house of God and of course the ark stay there now the final mention of the Ark was Jeremy in the Old Testament was Jeremiah 3 16 and 17. so let's read that Jeremiah 3 16 and 17. Jeremiah 3 16 and 17. now this is the last mention the church but remember there is going to be another physical Ark and that's going to be in Revelation 11 when Israel rebuilds the temple and according to Daniel chapter 9 they will re-establish animal worship for three and a half years but that one's not mentioned by name it's not mentioned by The Ark in Revelation 11 it just says uh they'll have a temple and then Daniel 9 says the Antichrist will cut cut the Covenant in the midst of the week he'll cause the daily sacrifice to be stopped in the midst of the week so at the halfway point of the Great Tribulation the Antichrist will break the Covenant and he'll take control he'll try to stop the worship in the Tabernacle there okay so Jeremiah 3 16 and 17. it should come to pass when ye be multiplied an increase in the land and those days saith the Lord they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visited neither shall that be done anymore Hallelujah verse 17 at that time they shall call Jerusalem that Throne of the Lord and All Nations shall be gathered into it to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their heart now this looks like the Millennium to me right because we're not going to need an ark anymore why because we're going to see Jesus Christ himself amen amen there won't need to be anymore Ark right because there there's no need for us to look for the presence of God the prince of God is in his son Christ amen hallelujah praise God remember like uh uh Ezekiel 48 says the prince of God is going to flow into that Temple that Temple the the Millennium Temple must be anointed Jesus is already anointed praise God but the anointing comes in the temple when Jesus comes into the temple praise God that's right amen the millennial Temple praise God Christ comes in the temple and we're all there in white robes Hallelujah with glorified bodies amen that can vanish at a moment and reappear and never sleep praise God hallelujah you can eat if we want we don't have to praise God but we're in glorified bodies dressing white with rods of iron that rule the Nations praise God Hallelujah so that's the last time the ark is mentioned in the Old Testament there's got to come a time when they're not even going to think about the ark anymore because Christ is there hallelujah thank God Amen all right now I already read what the ark represents all those things represents the prince of God it represents the glory of God it represents communion with God all right now we looked at the arc there there's the picture again I want to do a little bit more on David's dancing here so bear with me I want to read this here out of off of page 120. so we see there's actually two portions of scripture that record David bring in the ark it's first Chronicles 15 and second Samuel 6 as we just read here Hallelujah now the Bible says this was a March where they would sacrifice every six Paces they would sacrifice literal animals right so there was a lot of sacrifice going on in terms how many know God loves sacrifice you sacrificed to come here tonight some of you worked hard all day right but you made a sacrifice to come here well now you now you got one of the steps praise God right but don't stop there keep bringing more worship praise God that's part of it amen Hallelujah but they also had singing shouting the sound of coronets trumpet symbols sultries and harps and we got some pretty good sultries and harps over here praise God Hallelujah just waiting for somebody to jump on that Cajon pretty soon right God's grace what do you think Victoria Hallelujah somebody the women of Israel dance in and out and between in those great processions it certainly was not a quiet service right but one of great joy gladness and excitement and enthusiasm David played and danced with all of his might before the Lord the singers and musicians sang and play with all their their might the ark was the center of Attraction amen Hallelujah to see the ark the prince of God was coming back into position the prince of God was coming into the city of God amen hallelujah the glory of God was coming back to its rightful position amen the glory of God was predestinated to be their Church the prince of God is predestinated to be here with us amen because we're Believers and wherever two or three are gathered there Christ is the supernatural one in their midst Hallelujah it's predestinated to be here praise God Hallelujah it's ordained this is the position of God's presence Hallelujah thank you Lord but then we see of course the wrong side we see the Macau side right everybody else is dancing enjoying it she should have come down and got into worship but the Bible said the word uh the word the ark the ark discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart oh my goodness there it is amen the presence of God the word of God coming in and it discerned everybody's heart that's what it is tonight the word of God preached it will discern your heart praise God which side are we going to be on the McCall side or the David side let's be on David's side Hallelujah let's be real worshipers amen let's Rejoice that the prince of God is here praise God this is a Revival message amen well you could say maybe it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost message for those that are seeking the Baptist the Holy Ghost which I know numerous are that's the kind of message this is praise God because the presence of God is coming into his rightful position with shouting rejoicing praise wherever God is there's noise amen hallelujah Hallelujah unless let me say this let me let me balance that unless you're isolated with God right because then when Elijah was isolated with God it was what a still small voice right so see sometimes God's presence in the community it's loud it's rejoicing sometimes when you're isolated with God just you and God it's that still a small voice you got to listen for it Lord is this exactly you I want to make sure let me check that by the word to make sure that's a scriptural voice that's why I loved who his testimony we put out today she had twice time she heard the voice of God the first time it said don't or take off those take off those earrings boy that's a scriptural voice sister amen and she's like am I going crazy and then the voice said again take off those earrings and the boy said turn off that Christmas music right beautiful testimony mine isn't that beautiful how the Holy Spirit discerns our hearts that's so beautiful and what a privilege God speaks to you like that sister that's beautiful see that's the voice of God we have the privilege but it was a still small voice right God speaks right in your car too amen I like that amen you can sneak in your house in your car in the service out there in the bathroom right Haven you can he can speak a word of encourage him in the bathroom again Hallelujah if you need an encouraging word God wants to speak God wants to be present God wants us to reach out for the spirit praise God that shows we're on fire thank God Amen Hallelujah she could have been down there worshiping but the word discerned the thoughts and intents of her heart bye now what did she see now look at this all she saw was the flesh and church that's what we got to be careful we got to look past the flesh she looked at the Flesh and said what a fanatic he took off his King's robes he's got priest robes on he's the king he shouting and dancing what are all My Maids going to think about that she was only looking at the flesh she didn't see the spirit oh hallelujah oh and that beautiful church that's why people come here all they see is just fleshly stuff oh he you know he stutters when he preaches he screams too loud he spits all they see is a flesh they don't see the spirit of God moving in the souls moving behind the scene they don't hear the voice of God in the midst of it praise God they just see a bunch of Fanatics and people raiding their hands and shouting and rejoicing they only see flesh but we see more than that we see the Unseen we see angels we see the Holy Spirit we see God Discerning thoughts and intents we see God answering prayer we see the spirit praise God that's all Michael saw was the flesh I just see him a Madman jumping out there well let me be a Madman let me be with the spirit and if you don't like that Nicole watch this and she just Praises God and worships and praise God all they see is the flesh that's all they want to see but if you're a Christian you'll see the spirit behind it praise God you'll see the joy in the word coming where the Bible says and for this purpose the Bible said the David was rejoicing because now he could inquire of God and talk to God amen amen oh church let me say that like this you're not talking to God in denomination you're talking to God here and the message of the hour praise God I know because I was Raising it you were raising the money God was not talking to us there God's talking here with Revelations of thus saith the Lord hallelujah they were talking Jesse you need to be baptized and Firestone Holy Ghost I'm like okay that wasn't God talking right and the church said that wasn't God talking I wasn't going to hear God there oh Jesse it's okay for you to get a tattoo and all these things like that no no that wasn't God talking huh Jesse it's okay for you to buy alcohol on your birthday and let's have a late night and get drunk which we didn't get drunk that night but I did buy alcohol my 21st birthday that's what they said but God was saying no don't drink that have some new wine amen I got some better wine than that of Corona praise God I got wine Corona don't know nothing about praise God I got the joy of the Lord the strength of God hallelujah Hallelujah but see all the McCall all a Judas sees is the flesh they don't see the life behind it they don't see the joy behind it said David lost all his pride so she didn't see the humility behind it Church it takes a humble person to dance in the church now I know some people do it pridefully but by God's grace we're not doing it pridefully we're doing it because we want to be free and we want to Worship the Lord hallelujah thank God Hallelujah see David had to get humble and then he could dance before the Lord then he could Worship the Lord but all she saw was the flesh she didn't look at that oh my goodness that whole time Church all she saw was the flesh she didn't even see the Ark of God coming in the prince of God see that's what how it is people come here they'll miss the actual preaching of the word of God the prince of God God heals cancer God heals tumors God Saves Souls God fills Souls with the Holy Ghost they miss all they miss the ark they miss the voice of God they miss the Revelation to thus say Lord all they see is flesh oh it's a small church and they're Fanatics and the guy spits and everybody's in one Accord everybody's dressing humble like that they miss the Ark of God they miss the presence of God but thank God we enjoy it we invite the presence of God hallelujah that's what we see when we come to church praise God the prince of God she missed the ark she missed the word of God blessed are your eyes for they see the word of God blessed are your ears for they hear the word of God don't look so much of the flesh Church the flesh is going to let you down look to the holy ghost look to what the word of God is saying look to the voice of God look to the life behind the flesh Hallelujah oh it's a beautiful thought she did not see the Ark of God and she did not return into the Lord's presence she kept her distance look at that she kept her distance from the Holy Ghost she said I don't want any of that fanaticism now look everybody else is down there they were cheering David on and David is saying this saw us thousands of David said no no doubt they were worshiping God they were praising God all these women and men praising God but she sat up there and wouldn't even praise God she wouldn't come down with the Holy Rollers well you at least did a good thing about coming down here with the Holy Rollers Hallelujah that's a good step praise God but she stayed way up there ignored the ark ignored the prince of God stayed aside and when it come down to talk to those Holy Rollers she didn't have anything good to say about him just criticism so let's say something good about somebody I said you want somebody to say something good about you say good say something good about somebody else praise God see church we got to say good things Hallelujah Glory oh that's a beautiful thought now Church here's a few thoughts I want to bring out here I think I might have mentioned them earlier you know when I dance it's usually under control right I don't look like I'm out of control and so my thought was this if you can have a prescribed or a practice song special like how many times did awesome practice the song before you sing it I know I practice my shoulder song at home before I kill right if I can practice a song that I believe the holy spirit's anointing why can't I practice a dancing at the Holy Holy Ghost to get anointed right just like brothers says it's okay for children to have Holy Ghost plays like a Christmas play at their Church which a lot of the churches do right I know the church uh the grams go to now they have a Christmas play they have an Easter play they have all these plays that's fine but if they if they believe that's light of the Holy Spirit then why can't maybe they do but I'm not using them an example if I'm just saying why can't we have a a planned out dance service because you plan out for the song special in the Holy Ghost Falls you plan out for a play and sometimes people got saved at the place right they can remember the Canada Church so see if you can practice those why can't you practice dancing in the spirit Paul said if I sing let me sing in the spirit oh there it is if I pray let me pray in the spirit if I Dance Let Me dance in the spirit praise God Not In the Flesh not in sin not in Pride but in humility and worship to God hallelujah look Church David was under control of the spirit but Abraham said he lost all of his pride and he was just happy so while they were killing the animals every now look every six spaces so here he would dance then he'd go one two three four five six and then when it stopped right here they killed six more animals and he would glorify God he did all these stops in between he'd come over here and dance he's leaping and praising God Amen but he was under control he was just so happy the prince of God is here now look Church especially on that second time look he knew he was going to go dance again so you can't say well you can only dance when it's unplanned if so then David broke the scripture but there's no scripture on that the Bible says praise His name in the dance and the church said Hallelujah so see you can't say or it's only spontaneous dancing no David didn't the second time wasn't spontaneous the second time in fact he repeated it right three months later the first time he danced USA died three months later he danced again and wouldn't that be great if we could dance every three months I just thought I'd throw that in there would that be greater three four times a year right 12 divided by three is four four times a year you we dance and praise the Lord wouldn't that be great Hallelujah so see Church there's liberty in the Holy Spirit in fact every time we're Joyful We ought to give God a little dance praise God ought to Rejoice to say thank you Jesus for every blessing Hallelujah all you've done for me thank you for the cross thank you for the blood thank you for our new life thank you for the resurrection praise God thank you for the law of God on my heart thank you for the man of the daily word of my soul and thank you that I'm a new creature I'm a resurrected life Hallelujah thank you for the Ark of my life Hallelujah thank God Amen Glory I'm almost at an hour remember what did Mount Zion represent what did this mountain represent it represents the place where God dwells it represents the place of salvation this is a whole list remember I preached to them there's like 30 of these there's 25 of these verses about what Zion is the place of strength it's the place of joy of the whole Earth come on Church come on it's a place to join Hallelujah oh not my here you know I forgot that verse take your Bibles here I forgot that verse they just come to me now um First Chronicles 13 3 yeah First Chronicles 13 3. brother Malcolm why don't you read that when you get there first Chronicles 13 3. this is what makes the message Church different from the domination like I said I can't go to a dominational church and let me inquire like let's say I went to the Baptist Church let me inquire should my wife wear earrings can we do that at the Baptist Church can we inquire of the Lord what are they going to say of course you can see they're not inquiring to the Lord see that in that beautiful doctor I never really thought about that till today this is a beautiful type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I love it man now I'm going to read that see the whole time that denomination preacher right so he didn't have the word so he couldn't inquire of God he started off good you know following your lord and humility but then when the troubles came he didn't have the ark there to consult he wasn't seeking God's will he wasn't seeking God's perfect will church he didn't want to know God's will he wanted his will he wanted to please the people I don't want to please you I want to please God hallelujah I hope you say this hey I don't want to please any man or pastor's opinion I want to please God hallelujah kind I want to be kind to you but we want to please God we're here to please the Lord Jesus Christ and church that's the difference in our church brother Austin you can inquire of God and find a Bible answer praise God they told me I could smoke cigarettes they told me I could I could drink alcohol they told me my wife could wear sexy clothes they told me my wife could wear makeup and shirts because they weren't inquiring of God thank god brother we can inquire give me high five buddy we can inquire God when you read this word the Holy Spirit Will point you the word of God hallelujah and we could know exactly what the word says about something Hallelujah oh it's beautiful church it's beautiful what a type it is of the New Testament believer right go to the denomination you inquire the Lord on certain things they'll let you do almost anything as long as you come to church right but David was different David who said I want the word in my presence I want to live in the presence of the word I want to go in my prayer closet and I want to hear the voice of God Amen amen that's what happens many times for me I'll be praying and then a scripture will come and I'll preach on it right then somebody say oh that's what I needed well God gave it to me it wasn't me it was God right right it's just God you know that's how we do it we got to go and inquire of God we get the prince of God and God drops down his inspiration the thought of God the mind of Christ comes to us praise God and that's what the ark is in our lives the prince of God the glory of God in our lives oh there's so much things it is there's 25 things it is 25 I've already preached an hour so I've ever I need to close the close here pretty soon but Zion is the place where the lord's name is declared and praised right so here you can bring any question brother Chris I hope you do buddy you can bring any question in this church and by the grace of God we'll inquire God we'll look in the word and give you the best answer we can and I promise you if you went to domination they give you the wrong answer nine times out of ten nine times out of ten how do I know because I was Raising one right and I when I got saved I went into denominations Zion is the place of God's blessing how do you want to be blessed that's I don't want to be cursed one thing I want is God's blessing in My Life Church Zion is a place of God's rest and his habitation forever no wonder David rejoiced no wonder this is where God's going to dwell of all the cities on the earth God is here of all the denominations of all the churches God's in this church Hallelujah because we inquire of God God gives us the answer God gives us the truth God leads us he speaks to us he guides us and his name is declared here hallelujah oh it's beautiful design is the place where the word of the Lord is taught Zion is a place of shouting singing in Comfort oh thank you Lord Isaiah 12 6 said cry out and Shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of Thee that's why we Shout God is awesome in this place Hallelujah I better find a place to go it's already been an hour so I wanted to close here I want to close here let me yeah he's on the way to church Malachi's driving that gives me a little bit more time to study let me just show you while I was driving on the road this all this was fresh it just came to me while I was driving so I didn't have time to put on the slideshow okay I didn't have time to type out all the nice nice readable legible handwriting didn't have time to type it out but this all came while I was driving I was I've never really seen this before now here we have the three Old Testament Tabernacles right you have Moses's then it would come to David's Tabernacle and then it come to Solomon's Temple and the church said let me see did I yeah this is my last one so I'm gonna try to close it I'm going to try to close here now Moses is Tabernacle was temporary right it was in transit right and I'll say like this it was out of position it was going somewhere right and so Moses Tabernacle is a type of the Old Testament praise God it wasn't in position right they were constantly it was temporary the Bible said the law vanishes away now that scripture right there Hebrews chapter 8. the law is old and Decay and waxeth and vanishes the way right now here's the one that brother Jose said after 32 years God showed him this revelation when it came to David David finally possessed the entire Promised Land all that was given to Joshua 500 years David finally conquers all of it and Jose as you heard him testify he couldn't understand why was what about the what why did he wear or what was how was David the priest you know because Jesus Christ is prophet priest and King and Jose said for 32 years I wondered how is David a time of Christ I see the prophet I see he's king of saints but how is he preached amen and then God led me to preach on Mount Zion where David when the word of God came when the prince of God came into a position David took off his kingly robe he's still King he's still anointed king he still prophesying with his heart amen but now he becomes the priest ah now he said sacrifice here sacrifice here praise God here praise God here now he becomes priests and then He blesses the people and sends them away with food now he's both Prophet King and he's priests Hallelujah a perfect type of Jesus Christ Hallelujah thank God Amen oh it's so beautiful now even though here in David's side it was still temporary materials mostly wood right but now it's in position and remember Church the sacrificial part was separated from there it's almost as if they didn't need sacrifices anymore not that they didn't but it was a type the old animal sacrifice the old way of sins was separated from it Church said [Applause] right because the raising altar I run into the scripture was there at gibea so the sacrifices of Moses were elsewhere so Moses there it is Moses stayed separate from David the law stayed separate from David in Moses day they had no singers they had no worshipers but David when the word of God when the word of God got to its position he said I want this many men singing I want that many women singing I want musicians there this is going to be a house of worship Praise of God is going to flow out of this church night and day Hallelujah ah but the Moses and sacrificial system was separate that's a perfect type see David typed the New Testament Church and give you was the blinded Jews the current condition we're in right now we're not together we're separated here we are we're dancing and praising God we're worshiping God the glory of God the word of God the prince of God is with the Gentiles amen but the Jews don't have that all they've got is the old formal system of Moses I about shot him when I was driving I had to contain myself now okay because you're driving I don't want to distract him and get him in a car accident I had to contain myself like there it is Glory thank God Amen a perfect time Jesus Christ is Prophet priest and King right now praise

praise God oh no I'm wearing yacht but I'm trying to close here this is this is glorious to me oh thank you Lord we inquire the Bible says in Hebrews 12 22 we are now come to Mount Zion we are there

Mount Zion Mount Sinai was death Mount Zion was three thousand Souls on the day of Pentecost saved three thousand died it died at Mount Sinai three thousand were saved at Mount Zion thank you Jesus

Millennium they're all going to be gold they're going to have deity they're all going to have the nature of Christ Hallelujah Oh Glory the art I'm sorry the Temple of Solomon was a permanent dwelling place for God's presence brother this type selenium notice it was built by a Jew the son of David Jesus Christ the son of David but he had Gentile helpers and the church said he had two men named Hiram or Hiram I don't know I think it's Hiram two kings named hiron brought him all the cedar all the wood precious stones the Jew the son of David could not build it without the Gentiles get your Bibles go to Isaiah 65 21. this Dwelling Place of God was going to have both Jews and Gentiles build it and it was going to be a permanent dwelling place for the prince of God oh I can't wait brother I can't build nothing here but I can't wait in that window I'm gonna I'm gonna understand how to build in there I can't hardly put two pieces of wood together with a nail but over there sister I'm gonna know how to do it God's Gonna download me with some wisdom Hallelujah Isaiah 65 21. you got it with amen he read 21 and 22. let's say praise the Lord can we praise the Lord here you have Gentiles building and you have the son of man building ah beautiful Church these were all types for us to enjoy but where are we at now Saints we're at the Tabernacle of David that's where we are a place where we can ask God our questions and God will answer us brother every question in my life almost God has answered me I said God why do we have a small church and God set Brother Ray in here to protect me to protect my children that's why we're small Church it took years but I inquired of God and I would lay here but I would lay here and cry right here at this altar God why is our church so small I'm preaching my heart out I just want to be a full-time pastor and God had to give me a thus saith the Lord for through Brother Ray it's to protect you and your children so then I can say hallelujah he talks back I inquired of God and God talked back amen hallelujah thank God and then people come from mega churches and come here and say this is such a loving place I'd rather have a few with the love of Christ than a million with a bunch of divisive spirits because the Bible said God hates division God hates when brothers are in conflict and sisters are in conflict with one another God loves the unity of the Holy Spirit let's stand to our feet praise God let's give God a round of applause musicians can come oh thank you Lord amen thank you Jesus I don't have all my answers brother but almost all my aunts all my main questions God has answered here and the friends of Christ where the Holy Ghost is here we inquire of God and God shows us the answers to our questions Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus let me show brother Christians I think I got to open right here 's a few pictures brother Chris of the Solomon's Temple so it was totally covered in gold this was the uh holy place the second the second the second room and this was just not this was natural this was built 3000 years ago it was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar there's another the side view of it the outer Court place to clean holy place there's the two cherubim right they come in and talk to they'd hear Jesus they'd hear the Holy Ghost speak right there there's another view of it just looking that one's a little more blurry but yeah they got the Brazen altar they'd wash here they'd kill the animals here they want the priest would wash here and then there's all the different uh we'll go through this Lord willing we'll go through all the the pieces and what they represent it's very similar to the Tabernacle Moses and there's the Queen of Sheba come in there you had 12 lines six Lions on each side and she just fainted She fainted this house is in order what brother Ram say all they did was rally around the preaching gift that God gave them Church all we gotta do is Rally around my gift rally around brother amen's preaching gift and the church said all he's got to do is Rally around the ministers that come in here just rally just support them pray for them pull on the gift of God and our hearts will faint at what God will do Hallelujah he's already done great things Church he like I told you he's done enough in my life where if he doesn't do anything else he was so
