[32:25] at purpose again tonight and I just like
[32:29] look at this little thought of God's
[32:30] planned or God planned your purpose I
[32:33] want to look at that here tonight by
[32:35] God's grace so I can timothy 1 verse 9
[32:47] so let's begin on three let's all read
[32:49] this together if you can let's read it
[32:51] on three one two three who has saved us
[32:54] and called us with an holy calling not
[32:58] according to our works but according to
[33:01] his own purpose and grace which was
[33:04] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[33:08] world began how many believe that
[33:09] tonight God has a holy calling he saved
[33:12] you for to be holy not according to your
[33:15] works but according to his purpose his
[33:18] intent and his grace in your life
[33:21] Amen I'm so glad he's called me for his
[33:23] purpose I just have to do his purpose
[33:25] you and I just have to do his purpose on
[33:27] this earth and of course if he asked you
[33:29] to do something he's gonna help you do
[33:31] it that's how word of Prayer let's just
[33:33] bow our heads if you have a need on your
[33:34] heart tonight just make it known unto
[33:35] the Lord Heavenly Father Lord you see
[33:38] the hands raised you see the hearts
[33:39] raised Lord God and Lord you're aware of
[33:42] each one of these people Lord they're
[33:44] your children they're your creation
[33:45] they're your masterpiece dear God and I
[33:48] pray Lord you administer to each one by
[33:50] your word help me to get out of your way
[33:52] and father let your your liberty and
[33:54] your power and your love and your your
[33:56] care just flow from the Word of God here
[33:59] tonight may each person feel your divine
[34:01] presence may each person hear from
[34:02] heaven O God and may you minister Lord
[34:05] to us and may you continue to guide us
[34:07] and direct us and as you promised
[34:09] lead us into all truth dear God we're
[34:11] looking for your coming Lord God we're
[34:13] watching and waiting we're praying O God
[34:15] Lord were where we're designing every
[34:19] each day of our life Lord God to point
[34:21] to you to glorify you
[34:22] you're the purpose of our lives and
[34:24] father we want to live according to thy
[34:26] purpose that you've made known to us
[34:28] Lord Granite Lord here tonight that you
[34:30] speak to every heart in Jesus Christ's
[34:32] name and the church said Amen god bless
[34:34] she's been seated praise God so I want
[34:38] to get right to this thought here and
[34:42] try to get be very cautious at the time
[34:44] here by His grace so I do have quotes
[34:49] again here by the grace of Lord I would
[34:51] look at a little bit on our thoughts or
[34:52] our purpose and then look at brother
[34:54] branham's purpose and then after that I
[34:56] like to look at the purpose that God had
[34:59] for
[35:00] one of brother Rams friends which is
[35:02] quite striking so I'm gonna move it up
[35:06] here I don't know how many have have how
[35:11] many have studied garnet peak is anyone
[35:14] ever studied his funeral message by the
[35:16] random preach does anybody ever study
[35:17] that Jose do ever so okay so I want to
[35:20] end with that and look at that year
[35:23] tonight to kind of give you an idea
[35:25] about how God has planned he's planned
[35:28] your purpose we talked about this a
[35:32] little bit about how how God has a plan
[35:35] or a purpose for you and it's not your
[35:36] choice it's God's choice and so we have
[35:39] to be humble enough to listen and like
[35:42] we said on on Monday night we have to
[35:44] ask God God what's your plan for my life
[35:46] what's your purpose for my life and so
[35:49] you want to look at that here again
[35:50] briefly tonight we read our text it's a
[35:53] holy calling and it's God's own purpose
[35:56] that was given in Christ before the
[35:58] world began this has already planned out
[36:01] it's already orchestrated just like you
[36:04] and I would see someone build a building
[36:06] or would you build something
[36:08] there's blueprints it's already planned
[36:10] out and we just have to ask God to show
[36:12] us what his blueprint is all about and
[36:15] then we have to walk in it now I pulled
[36:17] a little bit of inspiration again from
[36:19] this book Purpose Driven Life and and
[36:21] the second chapter starts off with these
[36:23] words you're not an accident and this
[36:26] kind of shows the the plan this is
[36:28] another way to say that God has planned
[36:30] for you to be here so it says you are
[36:32] not an accident your birth was no mishap
[36:35] or mistake your life is no fluke of
[36:38] nature your parents may not have planned
[36:41] for you but God did was anybody a
[36:44] surprise in here I know I wasn't but my
[36:48] mom wanted me to be a girl so when I
[36:50] came out she's a little disappointed
[36:52] because she already had three boys I
[36:53] know a little bit I was a little
[36:55] disappointment to my parents you know of
[36:57] course in a little way because my mom
[37:00] said we were hoping you'd be a girl but
[37:03] the next one was so see God was not at
[37:06] all surprised by your birth in fact he
[37:08] expected you to come long before you
[37:12] were conceived by your parents you were
[37:13] conceived
[37:14] in the mind of God he thought of you
[37:16] first
[37:17] it is not fate nor chance nor luck nor
[37:20] coincidence that you are breathing at
[37:21] this very moment you're alive because
[37:23] God wanted to create you the Bible says
[37:26] the Lord will fulfill his purpose for
[37:28] you so I want to just read those
[37:30] scriptures this is our text now we
[37:32] remember this one it's very familiar
[37:33] he's chosen us in him before the
[37:36] foundation of the world so we are
[37:39] already in the mind of God we were
[37:41] chosen in his thoughts that we should be
[37:43] holy so I can prove by these two
[37:45] scriptures that God's purpose for you
[37:47] and I is to be holy that is part of the
[37:51] purpose of your life to see it to live
[37:53] as holy as you possibly can how many
[37:56] started out twenty nineteen living holy
[37:57] for Jesus amen hallelujah I have and I
[38:02] trust you are as well now this is the
[38:04] scripture that's referenced the Lord
[38:06] will perfect that which concern with me
[38:08] the Psalms writer says now perfect means
[38:12] to complete to bring to an end all that
[38:15] God has planned for me God will bring me
[38:17] to that end he says thy mercy O Lord
[38:21] endureth forever forsake not the works
[38:23] of thine hands so God will bring
[38:26] holiness to completion remember holiness
[38:28] is part of your calling so God will make
[38:31] you more holy amen
[38:33] if you're willing to yield yourself if
[38:35] you're willing to surrender to God God
[38:38] will make you more holy in other words
[38:40] God will make you fall more in love with
[38:41] him amen because he'll perfect that
[38:44] which concern with me whatever God's
[38:47] plan is for me he's going to bring it to
[38:49] pass and that mate reminds us of
[38:52] Philippians 1 verses 2 to 6 grace be
[38:56] unto you and peace from God our Father
[38:58] and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank
[39:00] my god upon every remembrance of you
[39:02] always in every prayer of mine for you
[39:04] all making requests with joy for your
[39:07] fellowship in the gospel from the first
[39:09] day until now being confident of this
[39:12] very thing that he which hath begun a
[39:14] good work in you will perform it until
[39:17] the day of Jesus Christ amen so Paul
[39:21] would remember the Philippians every
[39:23] time he prayed he thought of the
[39:25] Philippians he says here and he was
[39:28] he was assured God would finish what he
[39:31] started until the day of Jesus Christ
[39:33] amen
[39:34] now he said the rider says God
[39:37] prescribed every single detail of your
[39:39] body he deliberately chose your race the
[39:42] color of your skin your hair because
[39:44] remember every hair is numbered and
[39:46] every other feature he custom made your
[39:49] body just the way he wanted it he also
[39:51] determined the natural talents you would
[39:53] possess and the uniqueness of your
[39:55] personality
[39:57] the Bible says I'm just gonna read the
[39:59] Bible says I will praise thee David said
[40:01] from fearfully and wonderfully made
[40:03] marvelous are thy works and my that my
[40:07] soul knoweth right well hallelujah now
[40:10] we you know the the world doesn't want
[40:13] us to think we're wonderful but we
[40:14] really are wonderful God has made our
[40:17] bodies in a wonderful way not to make us
[40:19] a proud or anything like that but just
[40:22] to acknowledge when God made God made us
[40:25] he made something special praise God he
[40:27] did a great creation and he says my
[40:29] substance which means the bones was not
[40:32] hid from me when I was made in secret
[40:34] and curiously raw and the lowest parts
[40:37] of the earth you know they can see
[40:39] inside of a mother's womb and in the
[40:41] third month they can see that the bones
[40:43] are forming all the bones are there and
[40:46] from that third month they're there and
[40:48] they just spread out and they become
[40:49] more and more identified that there's
[40:52] 300 bones when a baby 3 months a baby in
[40:56] the womb has 300 bones you know as it's
[40:58] born and everything all those bones kind
[41:00] of they kind of go smaller and a smaller
[41:04] number and they end up with 209 when
[41:06] it's born so the bones kind of fuse
[41:09] together there's less bones as it grows
[41:13] but these were not hid from God in other
[41:15] words God can see right into the womb
[41:17] praise the Lord
[41:18] God's right there he knows exactly
[41:21] nothing's hid from God so God's been
[41:23] watching you but well before you were
[41:25] out of the womb God even watched you
[41:27] while you're in the womb brace of the
[41:28] heart that's what the Bible said wasn't
[41:30] hid from God God didn't just say oh
[41:34] there's Jesse when I was born you know
[41:36] he was there he knew he had it all
[41:38] planned out it wasn't hid from him it
[41:40] was a wonderful thing that God was
[41:42] doing he said when I was made in secret
[41:45] and curiously wrought the lowest parts
[41:46] of the earth nine eyes that see my
[41:49] substance yet being unperfect and in thy
[41:52] book all my members were written which
[41:54] in continuance were fashioned when as
[41:57] yet there was none of them so all of
[41:59] your members and one translation says
[42:01] all your days God saw all your days in
[42:05] his book were already written when we
[42:09] didn't even realize them God knew the
[42:11] number of our days and he says how
[42:13] precious are thy thoughts unto me O God
[42:16] how great is the sum of them so see
[42:20] God's plan should be precious to us God
[42:22] has a book of each one of us write the
[42:25] Bible said his book thy book all my
[42:28] members were written praise God
[42:30] so God's book has us written in there he
[42:32] knows all about us it's all in there and
[42:34] David said it should be precious to us
[42:37] God's thoughts about us God's plan for
[42:40] us should be precious to us amen in
[42:42] other words in other words we should say
[42:44] God thank you for my life thank you for
[42:46] what you're doing in my life you knew
[42:48] all about this would happen well before
[42:50] it even happened I have confidence in
[42:53] you I have confidence in your plan it's
[42:55] precious to me my life is precious thank
[42:58] you for giving it to me help me to be
[43:00] thankful he glory
[43:02] how precious are your thoughts in other
[43:04] words how precious is the Word of God
[43:07] because these are God's thoughts and he
[43:09] said how great is this some of them
[43:12] hallelujah God made you for a reason he
[43:17] also decided when you would be born and
[43:20] how long you would live he planned the
[43:23] days of your life
[43:24] choosing the exact time of your birth
[43:26] and death and we just read those
[43:28] scriptures so he knew when you would be
[43:31] born and how long you would live the
[43:33] Bible said there's a time to be born and
[43:35] a time to die a time to plant a time to
[43:38] pluck up that which is planted so the
[43:41] Bible said teach us to number our days
[43:43] that we may apply or enter our hearts
[43:47] unto wisdom so teach us to remember that
[43:51] we just have a certain limited number of
[43:53] days a church
[43:55] we keep that in mind we can either let
[43:57] that go the wrong way interfere or it
[43:59] can go the right way into faith and
[44:01] motivation or I've only got let's say
[44:04] I'm 38 let's say you know the God
[44:05] promises a man 70 years right so let's
[44:08] say I got I'm almost forty so I got
[44:10] thirty two more years let's say God you
[44:13] know that either make us go into fear
[44:15] and depression or that'll make us go
[44:16] into faith and confidence Lord use these
[44:19] last 40 years of my life help me to use
[44:22] them for your glory I know they're going
[44:25] to end soon so help me to seize the day
[44:27] help me to redeem the time help me to
[44:29] live for you help me to give you
[44:31] everything I got with joy because I know
[44:34] I don't have forever help me to live as
[44:36] close to you as I can because I know
[44:38] I've only got a certain number of days
[44:39] amen help me to make like like that sign
[44:42] says the high school where I teach I
[44:45] don't teach at the building but where in
[44:47] my district it says don't count the days
[44:49] make the days count I like that don't
[44:53] count the days how many days left I got
[44:55] no make the days count let this day be
[44:58] to the glory of God help me use this day
[45:01] to tell others about Jesus Christ amen
[45:04] hallelujah so see when you number your
[45:08] days off only got this many days I'm
[45:11] gonna make these days count you apply or
[45:13] you enter into wisdom and I've and I can
[45:18] thank the Lord that I gave my heart to
[45:19] God at 19 I've been able to give my 20s
[45:22] to Jesus Christ
[45:23] so I spent in 20 from 20 to 25 learning
[45:27] about the Word of God and I spent 25 to
[45:29] 30 being a pastor then I spent thirty to
[45:33] thirty eight where I am now I spent all
[45:35] that time preaching loving Jesus and
[45:37] being a pastor raising my family I'm
[45:39] thankful that I've entered into the
[45:41] wisdom of God I haven't left my family
[45:43] and chased after alcohol or or anything
[45:46] evil like that or sensuality or any
[45:49] carnality like that I've tried to apply
[45:52] my heart to wisdom to invest in the
[45:56] things of God and we have people on
[45:58] Facebook now that are asking us to write
[45:59] a book about how to do marriage and
[46:01] parenting because people can see Christ
[46:04] in our lives
[46:05] amen because it's not it's not me
[46:09] it's not me it's taking the glory it's
[46:12] only by the blood of Jesus Christ so
[46:15] that we can see the blood of Jesus
[46:16] Christ must be applied to our lives and
[46:18] it's applied to our lives
[46:21] it becomes wisdom it becomes the way of
[46:23] God that's right amen so teach us to
[46:27] number our days hallelujah that will
[46:30] live wise lives now this is one I forgot
[46:32] to write so I've got your Bible go to
[46:34] acts 17 here I forgot to put this one
[46:36] down on the slide I've referenced this
[46:40] over the years I can't remember the last
[46:41] time I preached it well let's just go
[46:43] ahead and read it here acts 17:26 let's
[46:52] go to actually of 17 22 now the writer
[46:55] says God also planned where he planned
[46:57] when you would be born when you would
[46:59] die and then he planned of course where
[47:01] you would be born at and where you'd
[47:03] live for his purpose because he had a
[47:07] purpose for you to be born in Ghana we
[47:11] had a purpose for you to be born in Ohio
[47:12] or which one was it brother Nicaragua he
[47:16] had a purpose for you to be born in
[47:17] Nicaragua it's a purpose God knew the
[47:21] purpose your race and nationality are no
[47:24] accident God left no detail to chance he
[47:27] planned it all for his purpose and this
[47:29] is where the Bible said Paul is up on
[47:31] Mars Hill in acts 17 22 then Paul stood
[47:34] up in the midst of Mars Hill and said
[47:36] you men of Athens I perceive that in all
[47:39] things you are too superstitious for I
[47:41] passed by and beheld your devotions I
[47:43] found an altar with this inscription to
[47:45] the unknown God whom therefore you
[47:48] ignorantly worship Him declare I unto
[47:50] you
[47:52] verse 24 God that made the world and all
[47:56] things therein seeing that he is Lord of
[47:58] Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples
[48:00] made with hands neither is worship with
[48:04] man's hands as though he needed anything
[48:06] seeing he giveth to all life and breath
[48:10] and all things verse 26 and hath made of
[48:14] one blood all nations of men for to
[48:16] dwell on all the face of the earth now
[48:18] here it is and hath determine the times
[48:21] before appointed
[48:23] and the bounds of their habitation so
[48:26] God determined the time you'd be born
[48:28] and God also determined the country or
[48:31] the habitation you'd be born in praise
[48:34] God hallelujah now look at verse 27 that
[48:39] they should seek after the Lord if haply
[48:42] they might feel after him and find him
[48:44] though he be not far from every one of
[48:47] us for in him we live and move and have
[48:50] our being as certain also of your own
[48:53] poets have said for ye also are his
[48:57] offspring amen aren't you glad you're
[49:00] the offspring of God or you're a child
[49:02] of God you are God's offspring now we're
[49:06] gonna get to this a little later but God
[49:08] determined where you be born because
[49:10] where you would be born would help you
[49:13] to seek the Lord praise God that's what
[49:18] the Bible says you were born in a
[49:19] certain place because being born in that
[49:22] place would help you to seek after God
[49:25] had you been born in a different place
[49:27] you might not have to sought after God
[49:29] like we can look at Jose's life and he
[49:32] was born in a certain place so he could
[49:33] meet his current wife and be introduced
[49:35] to the message right brother that right
[49:38] we're gonna look at this Garnett peak at
[49:40] the end he was born in a country where
[49:43] there was tobacco fields all around and
[49:46] brother Brahim said that was his desire
[49:48] to be a bat aback o farmer but he said
[49:52] when he was when when the message came
[49:54] to Garnett peak he had this he had a
[49:57] plan to be a tobacco farmer but he
[49:59] turned that down in order to gain Christ
[50:01] he had to be born in a certain place and
[50:04] the only attraction that the highest
[50:07] attraction of his life would be to be a
[50:10] tobacco farmer well I'm gonna brace
[50:12] tobacco and I'm gonna sell tobacco so I
[50:15] can sell it and make some money and that
[50:17] actually drove him the emptiness of that
[50:20] drove him to accept Jesus Christ in the
[50:23] message amen
[50:25] so in your life God has placed you here
[50:28] God has placed me here in this place
[50:31] here where where we were placed here and
[50:34] then now we look around and see
[50:36] and I thank God where God placed me
[50:38] right there in Liberty senator Ohio
[50:40] it's an hour north of Lima brother and
[50:42] brother Brandon would visit Lima all the
[50:44] time honey
[50:46] amen thank you Lord and so so when Simon
[50:51] after September 11th after Simon was
[50:55] shook up by September 11th he saw an
[50:57] advertisement for a Bible study he went
[50:59] to that Bible study and he learned about
[51:01] the message of God a man so he was close
[51:05] to a message church God determined that
[51:09] we'd be close to that church to meet
[51:10] brother Brooks and meet brother Craig
[51:12] and meet all these sayings and the ones
[51:14] of the brother and sister Brown that
[51:16] went to brother Adams church we got to
[51:18] meet them and staying at their a house a
[51:20] few nights God determined that God
[51:23] placed us in a position where we'd be
[51:25] able to hear the word I'm glad he did it
[51:27] praise God amen other God determined
[51:33] that God knew I'd received the message
[51:35] just by studying the scripture with
[51:37] brother Craig God knew that was how I
[51:39] needed to receive it praise God so God
[51:44] determined that we should seek after the
[51:46] Lord God determined when we'd be born
[51:48] where are we we born so that we would
[51:50] seek after God hallelujah
[51:52] look at verse 29 for as much then as we
[51:56] are the offspring of God we ought not to
[51:58] think that Godhead is like on the gold
[52:00] or silver stone graven by art and man's
[52:03] device alright just let's pause right
[52:08] there now that's got me thinking there
[52:13] let me just uh that got me thinking here
[52:16] let me switch over just a minute did you
[52:17] see this I did you see the Pope's prayer
[52:20] it just got me thinking did you see the
[52:23] the Pope had a prayer yesterday and his
[52:27] prayer was not to Jesus for the new year
[52:30] it was to Mary I can show you the link
[52:32] this is the Catholic knew this is their
[52:34] own this is their own website so like we
[52:39] just read the Godhead is not liking on
[52:41] the stone silver or gold or silver stone
[52:44] graven by art and man's device and look
[52:46] there's a golden Mary in Jesus who looks
[52:48] greater in that picture
[52:50] marry her Jesus Mary looks greater and
[52:54] in this prayer for 2019 the prayer is to
[52:57] mother Mary
[52:58] he said we we fly to your protection
[53:02] see they're running to Mary but we're
[53:04] running to Jesus amen hallelujah they
[53:07] run to Mary they which is a false god
[53:09] which is evil spirits they run to to
[53:12] Mary but we run into a tower the
[53:15] righteous run into the tower the name of
[53:17] Jesus Christ and they're saying amen
[53:20] we see they're making the Godhead unto
[53:22] gold just what the scripture says they
[53:24] shouldn't do there's update there's a
[53:27] ghost picture there she got earrings on
[53:31] the Bible condemns earrings in that so
[53:34] sad Church they Dec them in gold and all
[53:36] these precious gold and the Bible says
[53:38] right there do not make the Godhead to
[53:40] like it any gold or silver anything like
[53:42] that
[53:43] you're not striking I thought mine well
[53:46] I thought well I better show that to the
[53:47] church just to see where they're headed
[53:48] the Pope's praying for their unity he's
[53:51] praying for all those things and he's
[53:52] praying to Mary God keep us a million
[53:54] miles away from that thank you lord
[53:56] hey God give us grace to love people
[53:58] that that are so caught and too seen by
[54:00] that they don't even understand what
[54:02] they know or they don't even understand
[54:04] what they believe oh my just thought I'd
[54:08] share that with you alright it's all for
[54:11] a purpose so God planned that you'd live
[54:14] in Ohio so you'd have a message Church
[54:16] here in Akron is that right
[54:18] God God desires right the Bible said you
[54:21] gather more as you see that Day
[54:23] approaching so gathering together is not
[54:26] an option it's a command if God has to
[54:28] command you to do it he's going to have
[54:30] a church here for you to gather with
[54:32] amen
[54:33] it's all ordained of God it's all in
[54:35] God's purpose we just have to do God's
[54:37] purpose amen now he said most amazing
[54:43] God decided how you would be born
[54:45] regardless of the circumstances of your
[54:47] birth or who your parents are God had a
[54:50] plan in creating you it doesn't matter
[54:52] whether your parents were good or bad or
[54:54] indifferent God knew that those two
[54:56] individuals was that's exactly the right
[54:58] genetic makeup to create the custom you
[55:01] that he had in mind they
[55:03] the DNA God wanted to make you that's
[55:07] right
[55:07] while there are illegitimate parents
[55:09] there are no illegitimate children I
[55:12] like the Hat de menthe glory many
[55:16] children are unplanned by their parents
[55:18] but they are not unplanned by God God's
[55:21] purpose took into account human air and
[55:23] even sin honey remember Tim Tebow and
[55:26] remember him that football player he's
[55:28] an NFL the doctors told his mom to abort
[55:32] him because they looked at the
[55:35] ultrasound and they thought he would be
[55:36] mentally or didn't have enough
[55:39] oxygen and look she could have she could
[55:42] have took in that and said oh well I
[55:45] better aboard I better kill off this
[55:46] life but look what came out of this life
[55:48] a man that will stand there on the TV
[55:51] and say I think the Lord and Savior my
[55:53] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and whether
[55:55] he's you know wise or foolish now we
[55:57] have our opinion right but whether he's
[56:00] wise or foolish it's a life that that
[56:02] the world said wasn't worth living the
[56:04] DNA wasn't going to be any good
[56:06] but look how God can redeem when doctors
[56:09] are wrong when man is wrong look how
[56:11] great God is to redeem from the pits of
[56:13] hell amen hallelujah there's so many
[56:17] examples of like of that where doctors
[56:20] and and maybe mothers and fathers you
[56:22] know didn't think there would be
[56:23] anything good about life but when given
[56:25] a chance God redeems life from the grave
[56:28] amen hallelujah God never does anything
[56:32] accidentally he never makes mistakes he
[56:34] has a reason for everything he creates
[56:36] every plant and every animal was planned
[56:38] by God and every person was designed
[56:40] with the purpose in mind
[56:41] God's motive for creating you as his
[56:43] love the Bible said long before he laid
[56:46] the foundations he had us in mind he had
[56:48] a settled on us as the focus of his love
[56:51] and that was from Ephesians 1:4 let me
[56:54] go back to that one theevans one for ya
[56:58] the Bible says we should be holy and
[57:00] without blame before him in love it's
[57:03] all about love God created us because he
[57:05] loved us and now he wants us to love him
[57:07] back right now
[57:11] instead here he said like the attribute
[57:15] see it is in God and attribute as your
[57:17] thought God in the beginning the eternal
[57:19] he wasn't even a God he wasn't he was
[57:21] the eternal he wasn't even God he God is
[57:23] an object of worship or something see so
[57:25] he wasn't even that he was Elohim the
[57:27] eternal but in him was thoughts he
[57:30] wanted to become material and what he
[57:32] knew then he spoke a word and the word
[57:34] was materialized that's the whole
[57:35] picture from Genesis to Revelation is
[57:37] nothing wrong it's Elohim materializing
[57:41] so he can be touched feel and in the
[57:43] millennium
[57:44] there's hello him sitting on the throne
[57:46] see that's right
[57:47] with all subjects around him that he
[57:49] predestinated before the foundation of
[57:52] the world imagine how that's gonna feel
[57:54] for God now of course God is not like
[57:55] you and I but God had him in his mind
[57:58] and then manifested them throughout
[58:00] these six thousand years and then pretty
[58:02] soon in the Millennium for a thousand
[58:04] years here the very image of his mind
[58:06] now comes it comes into a reality praise
[58:09] the Lord
[58:10] Ava had his thoughts come to reality
[58:14] hallelujah brother and said there's like
[58:18] a man building chimes or making chimes
[58:20] the motor each bells got to ring
[58:23] different from each other the same
[58:25] materials but so much I earn so much
[58:27] steel so much rest to make it give the
[58:30] ting he says that's the way God did God
[58:33] read this one - that one - the what that
[58:36] one - one - one - this one - one till he
[58:39] got exactly what he wanted so that's
[58:41] what God did with you he put your
[58:42] grandparents together then put your
[58:44] parents together and here you come
[58:46] you're exactly what God wanted you to be
[58:49] so you could have a special sound to
[58:51] your life a special testimony to your
[58:53] life Amen God either made you to be a
[58:56] man to be a godly man have a special
[58:58] ring as a man or a special woman a woman
[59:01] has a special testimony and to overcome
[59:04] certain things and at the end of it has
[59:06] such a sweet testimony God's going to
[59:08] use that testimony on judgement day to
[59:11] condemn all those that that wouldn't
[59:13] serve Him but it'll stand as a witness
[59:15] that Jesus Christ was real in this
[59:17] generation amen so God read this one and
[59:21] that one and put all these together your
[59:23] mother and father and then you
[59:24] have a special testimony he said that's
[59:27] how he came down God and veiled himself
[59:30] in a pillar of fire down through the
[59:32] prophets than into the Son of God which
[59:34] he was God see it's the same God
[59:36] bringing out exactly from perfection of
[59:38] perfection from glory into glory that's
[59:40] the way the church goes
[59:43] hallelujah from glory to glory now look
[59:48] what the liquidus the Bible says here
[59:50] but God who is rich in mercy for his
[59:52] great love wherewith he loved us you
[59:54] feel love tonight you should feel the
[59:57] love of God tonight you shouldn't feel
[59:59] hatred toward God or disappointment God
[1:00:02] is disappointed in you or God's trying
[1:00:04] to condemn you the Bible doesn't say
[1:00:06] God's trying to do that the Bible said
[1:00:08] God wants to show us how much he loves
[1:00:10] us amen his great love wherewith he
[1:00:14] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:00:16] hath quickened us together with Christ
[1:00:18] by grace you are saved and hath raised
[1:00:21] us up together and made us sit together
[1:00:23] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:00:27] what kind of love does he have for us
[1:00:29] great love now look at this God loved
[1:00:33] you in great love for this purpose that
[1:00:35] in the ages to come he might show the
[1:00:38] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[1:00:40] kindness toward us through Jesus Christ
[1:00:43] so once we get to heaven
[1:00:45] God is going to show us all his great
[1:00:48] love over and over and over again I
[1:00:51] later yeah praise God amen there's so
[1:00:54] many things we don't know about yet God
[1:00:57] through it all as expresses love to us
[1:01:00] constantly faithfully over and over and
[1:01:03] it's so great he's going to take ages
[1:01:05] and ages and times and cycles and
[1:01:09] seasons and over and over again to show
[1:01:11] us all of his great love oh thank you
[1:01:17] lord
[1:01:18] it's kind of like you know think about
[1:01:20] this you know my teacher that's dying
[1:01:22] you know he has over probably like a
[1:01:25] hundred comments on Facebook just people
[1:01:28] thanking him and then today I went there
[1:01:30] to the the the hospice care and he had
[1:01:32] 40 greeting cards and each one people
[1:01:35] were thanking him now I could have went
[1:01:37] I went through those
[1:01:38] I just briefly went through them maybe
[1:01:40] for 30 minutes but I'd imagine if I
[1:01:42] write each of those it'd probably take
[1:01:44] me about two hours and so two hours
[1:01:48] you'd spend saying wow look at look at
[1:01:50] the appreciation for this for this man
[1:01:53] there's two hours we could just spend
[1:01:55] telling this person how much he's loved
[1:01:58] and Jesus you know he came so that we
[1:02:04] might take years and years and years not
[1:02:07] just a few hours but years and ages
[1:02:10] trying to understand how much he loves
[1:02:12] us not to ours but Ages amen
[1:02:17] why did God love us with a great way so
[1:02:20] that in ages to come he could show us
[1:02:23] this great kindness that he gave us by
[1:02:26] grace for by grace ye are saved through
[1:02:29] faith and that not of works it's the
[1:02:31] gift of God it's a great gift now that
[1:02:35] works lest any man should boast
[1:02:37] there'll be no bragging on the Day of
[1:02:39] Judgment Church there'll be no bragging
[1:02:40] over there it'll be all by God's grace
[1:02:42] that we did it but he'll take ages and
[1:02:46] so well this is where I was kind to you
[1:02:48] here this is where I express my grace to
[1:02:51] you right here this is where I showed
[1:02:53] mercy to you this is where I showed love
[1:02:55] and he'll take ages and ages to do that
[1:02:57] and we'll just all sit there say
[1:02:59] hallelujah thank you Lord well praise
[1:03:02] have been praise him and say mine well
[1:03:05] worship him and love him for ages as he
[1:03:08] shows us his great love that he's given
[1:03:10] to us and say wasn't you Jesse it wasn't
[1:03:15] you brother branham it wasn't you you
[1:03:17] put your name in there brother Malik
[1:03:18] over there
[1:03:19] it wasn't you it was my grace that did
[1:03:21] it for you oh thank you Lord and this
[1:03:25] then the passage ends with this for we
[1:03:27] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:03:30] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:03:33] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:03:35] them see God we're we're a planned out
[1:03:40] product we were an invention God
[1:03:42] invented with a special purpose in mind
[1:03:44] and nobody could do that better than we
[1:03:47] could there's something God has some
[1:03:49] work God has for you and I to do
[1:03:52] and there's nobody better that could do
[1:03:54] it than you because you're his
[1:03:56] workmanship and he created you not to
[1:03:59] fail but he created you unto good works
[1:04:01] not the new bad works and fail he
[1:04:03] created you to succeed and do what he
[1:04:05] called you to do in something good amen
[1:04:09] and all's you gotta do is walk in it
[1:04:11] he's got a walk in obedience to his
[1:04:13] calling in your life praise God and he's
[1:04:16] ordained you to it he's called you to it
[1:04:18] to walk in this plan for your life
[1:04:23] hallelujah now let's take a few moments
[1:04:25] to look at programs purpose Josie and I
[1:04:27] were talking about this a little bit a
[1:04:28] few nights ago
[1:04:30] now there's many things that could be
[1:04:32] said about the purpose of brother
[1:04:33] Branham but I'm just taking the quotes
[1:04:35] or brother BAM said I was born to this
[1:04:37] or I was called to do that those are
[1:04:39] those are the quotes I looked up and
[1:04:41] here's what I found about program's
[1:04:43] purpose now when the ancient Lord first
[1:04:46] met me he said now you were born to play
[1:04:49] video games make moonshine that's what
[1:04:56] does dad wanted them to do right you
[1:05:00] were born to pray for sick people and
[1:05:05] you take this gift to the peoples of the
[1:05:08] world
[1:05:10] so all Christians are born to take our
[1:05:13] gifts and use them you were born to pray
[1:05:22] for sick people so there was just a
[1:05:24] certain way brother Aaron well Jose
[1:05:26] there's just a certain way that brother
[1:05:28] Branham bowed his head and prayed hey I
[1:05:32] didn't hear you he could do in such a
[1:05:34] way that other people couldn't do it
[1:05:37] that way where you can hear and you can
[1:05:39] hear on the tape right when you listen
[1:05:41] he could pray and you know he was
[1:05:43] touching the heart of God amen
[1:05:47] he was born to do that it was in him to
[1:05:50] do that
[1:05:51] he had a way didn't have to shout all
[1:05:53] the time he'd have to yell then there's
[1:05:54] times I've heard him yell and I've heard
[1:05:56] him yell to people stand up on that
[1:05:59] wheelchair receive your healing and
[1:06:00] everybody goes wow at other times I've
[1:06:02] heard him just say God's gonna do it for
[1:06:04] you just real sweet humble
[1:06:06] in the name of Jesus receive your
[1:06:08] healing he was born to do that like he
[1:06:15] said like he said in his own testimony
[1:06:16] before he was saved he would spend his
[1:06:18] Sunday morning shining his model Ford
[1:06:20] car and he said he said oh what a waste
[1:06:23] of time he said that's the one thing I
[1:06:25] did rob from God I did steal from God he
[1:06:28] said I stole God's time he said instead
[1:06:31] of shining up my Ford I could have been
[1:06:34] trying to win souls amen
[1:06:39] so he wasn't just born to pray he
[1:06:42] actually had to go and take that to
[1:06:44] someone else because he had the calling
[1:06:47] of an evangelist
[1:06:49] now here's again where he says it I'm
[1:06:51] just gonna skip down a little bit he
[1:06:55] said I never studied on divine healing
[1:06:57] or anything in the Bible but he said you
[1:07:00] were born to pray for sick people take a
[1:07:02] gift of divine healing now I I put that
[1:07:10] quote up there and in particular because
[1:07:12] divine healing is one of the nine gifts
[1:07:14] of the Holy Spirit so his his purpose in
[1:07:18] life was directly directly associated
[1:07:21] with one of the nine gifts of the holy
[1:07:22] spirit that's what I mentioned on a
[1:07:25] Monday night that I believe Church that
[1:07:28] you and I have some of those nine gifts
[1:07:31] of the Holy Spirit and our lives are
[1:07:33] directly tied to them our purpose in
[1:07:37] life is directly tied to the gifts God
[1:07:41] has placed in our life why would God
[1:07:43] give you a gift if he doesn't want you
[1:07:45] to use it now he wants you to use it in
[1:07:47] his time and season right and it has to
[1:07:50] be according to his time his purpose his
[1:07:52] season his word all those five must I
[1:07:55] program taught us it must be according
[1:07:57] to those but remember that he gave
[1:07:59] everybody talents he gave everybody a
[1:08:01] gift we were born to do something with
[1:08:04] that gift and we got to make sure we do
[1:08:05] it I like this quote where he said
[1:08:13] and the angel said this is all to
[1:08:15] indicate that you were born to pray for
[1:08:17] sick people well what did I know about
[1:08:19] praying for sick people I was just a
[1:08:20] local Baptist pastor and I looked at him
[1:08:22] again he was very kind seemed like the
[1:08:24] fear begin to leave say like that when
[1:08:26] the Angels around the fear begins to
[1:08:28] leave when the Holy Ghost is here Church
[1:08:30] the fear begins to leave amen when you
[1:08:33] start singing God's praise when you
[1:08:35] start quoting God's Word that's when the
[1:08:37] fear goes haha hey man and I said sir
[1:08:43] I'm uneducated I could do no such things
[1:08:45] as you have you've told me to do because
[1:08:47] he had just said that you'll go to all
[1:08:49] the world you'll be praying for Kings
[1:08:50] potentates monarchs and how could I do
[1:08:53] that when I was just a grammar school
[1:08:55] education see I never received the Holy
[1:08:57] Ghost as yet so God even told him before
[1:08:59] he received the Holy Ghost what are you
[1:09:00] supposed to do so God might tell you the
[1:09:03] same you might know well God gave me
[1:09:05] this I was born to do that but you might
[1:09:07] not be born again so the thing to do is
[1:09:09] get born again
[1:09:10] and then do what God's called you to do
[1:09:12] like geez like Jesus told the disciples
[1:09:14] they all had their preaching gifts they
[1:09:17] all had the ability to cast out Devils
[1:09:18] but he said go wait until you're gonna
[1:09:20] do with a power from on high then you'll
[1:09:23] be a witness then you won't deny me in
[1:09:26] front of a little made girl that's
[1:09:28] accusing you and your life is on the
[1:09:29] line and you won't deny me you'll stand
[1:09:31] up for me
[1:09:33] so get even you might know or make me
[1:09:36] you don't know but even if you don't
[1:09:37] know the thing to do is get born-again
[1:09:39] live a holy life you know holiness is
[1:09:41] the purpose of God let God make you more
[1:09:43] holy and then get power and then God
[1:09:46] will show you what to do with your life
[1:09:47] amen he said these things are strange to
[1:09:53] me and I know nothing about them and I
[1:09:54] looked up again to speak to him and I
[1:09:55] said sir I could not do that and he said
[1:09:58] as Moses was sent with two gifts to
[1:10:00] prove to the people to vindicate that he
[1:10:02] had been son of God you are given two
[1:10:04] gifts amen so God's going to give you
[1:10:07] something to prove to you see his gifts
[1:10:10] was proving to him and to everybody else
[1:10:12] that God had sent him amen and that's
[1:10:16] what God does with your gift God has
[1:10:17] given you gifts in your life to prove to
[1:10:20] you and other people that God is with
[1:10:22] you that God's going to help you do
[1:10:24] these things
[1:10:27] right hope you can see that see this is
[1:10:32] what I want to show this to brother
[1:10:34] Graham tells the same story of the angel
[1:10:37] he said watch God puts it right back in
[1:10:39] the people's lap you were going to pray
[1:10:44] for sick people if you can get them to
[1:10:47] believe so God will first tell you your
[1:10:50] gift but say oh it's in your lap now
[1:10:52] you've got to be responsible with that
[1:10:54] gift amen praise God
[1:10:56] you can't just try to be half hazard
[1:10:58] with it you in other words you can't
[1:11:00] ignore it
[1:11:01] you can't forsake it you got to be
[1:11:02] devoted to the gift God has given to you
[1:11:06] just like with the talents you got to go
[1:11:08] invest it you got to go make sure it
[1:11:10] gets more it gets greater so God will
[1:11:14] give you something God's giving you
[1:11:15] something but now you have to invest in
[1:11:18] it I said they won't believe so see he
[1:11:21] keeps putting back on him well what
[1:11:23] God's giving you it well they won't
[1:11:24] believe so the angel keeps giving more
[1:11:26] answers try to get off his doubt away he
[1:11:30] said I'll give you two signs buy this
[1:11:31] they'll believe notice then these signs
[1:11:33] they were they've rallied for them the
[1:11:35] signpost instead of the Commission
[1:11:37] believing they that you were sent to
[1:11:39] pray so responsibility comes with gifts
[1:11:42] and this is my brother Brandon said God
[1:11:44] doesn't manifest more gifts in people's
[1:11:46] lives
[1:11:46] it's because he can't trust them yet
[1:11:49] they're not as faithful as they need to
[1:11:51] be with the gift in other words they
[1:11:53] don't pray about their gift
[1:11:54] they don't even meditate on their gift
[1:11:56] they don't study the Bible about their
[1:11:57] gift so God doesn't let those gifts
[1:12:01] manifest in their life because you have
[1:12:02] to be trustworthy with the gift how many
[1:12:06] understand that so God what God will
[1:12:09] give you a gift but then he puts it
[1:12:10] right back in your lap now what are you
[1:12:12] gonna do with that what are you gonna do
[1:12:15] with it did brother Branham sit at home
[1:12:20] then and just have a home service after
[1:12:23] this meeting with the angel no he
[1:12:26] started a church and he got the
[1:12:28] preaching and he preached free free
[1:12:30] until he went to special meetings then
[1:12:31] until God exploded his ministry right
[1:12:34] then went around the world seven times
[1:12:37] he had something to do with that he
[1:12:39] couldn't send there knew nothing
[1:12:41] he had to act on what he knew the Bible
[1:12:42] said look God even honored him in his
[1:12:45] ignorance because he was the least
[1:12:46] trying to do something with what God
[1:12:48] told him to do that's what you and I
[1:12:49] need a new church if we're not sure what
[1:12:51] to do everything to do let's do
[1:12:53] something with what God's given us but
[1:12:58] see now most people just sit back it and
[1:12:59] in any Church not just message churches
[1:13:01] but any church they just sit back and
[1:13:03] let the preacher do everything right let
[1:13:05] the song leader do everything not really
[1:13:08] realizing that God has placed something
[1:13:10] in our lives and were responsible to God
[1:13:13] with the talents he's given to us praise
[1:13:16] God that's what we're gonna get to
[1:13:19] eventually is this gift in your life for
[1:13:21] you you need to be identify and say what
[1:13:23] is God done supernaturally in my life
[1:13:25] that has blessed people or helped other
[1:13:27] people what is God calling me to do and
[1:13:29] then once you know you got to give
[1:13:31] yourself to that Feast of the trumpets I
[1:13:37] love this and so will it be with the
[1:13:42] bride and so it is on the bride
[1:13:43] we unworthy creatures deserving of hell
[1:13:46] but his grace holds us through it look
[1:13:48] at how many loss and blind
[1:13:49] how many sinners was there in the world
[1:13:51] the hour I got saved I think about that
[1:13:54] how many of my friends were out there
[1:13:57] that could have been saved but yet God
[1:13:59] chose me God let the rest of my friends
[1:14:02] go through college get drunk and live
[1:14:04] worldly lives and get divorces and in
[1:14:06] and out of in more relationships but yet
[1:14:08] God called me out of all those people
[1:14:10] hey man see God knew what he was doing
[1:14:13] God had a plan and God's gonna perfect
[1:14:15] and finish that plan we just gotta walk
[1:14:18] according to the plan God save me for a
[1:14:21] purpose and I'm determined not lazy I'm
[1:14:27] determined by his will to do that
[1:14:30] purpose I don't care what anything else
[1:14:32] goes I want to do it so church you need
[1:14:37] determination if you're gonna fulfill
[1:14:39] God's purpose in your life you've got to
[1:14:41] be determined you got to be focused you
[1:14:42] got to know God called me to do this I'm
[1:14:45] not gonna let anything discourage me
[1:14:47] praise God hallelujah
[1:14:52] so he was determined even at 55 years
[1:14:55] old
[1:14:56] 64 I'm determined to do my purpose in
[1:14:58] life now here's the smile I was sharing
[1:15:02] with brother Jose and the eye or when I
[1:15:04] see the churches they're great glamour
[1:15:05] the rich had need of nothing layer to
[1:15:07] see and they say see the mismo wretched
[1:15:09] blind they pat you on the shoulders want
[1:15:11] you to compromise with them he said I
[1:15:13] was born for a purpose that's the
[1:15:15] condemned that thing and called out he
[1:15:17] said this I do I was born to pray for
[1:15:21] sick people and I was born to condemn
[1:15:24] the Laodicean lazy boys I was born to
[1:15:29] condemn the legacy in spirit of how
[1:15:32] they're rich and increased with Goods oh
[1:15:34] just compromise just say we're all
[1:15:36] saving just say we're all the same we're
[1:15:38] not all the same he said I was can I was
[1:15:40] born to condemn that in other words I
[1:15:43] was born to call out that Antichrist
[1:15:44] spirit now I didn't get to Jeremiah one
[1:15:49] maybe I'll get to that next time cuz I
[1:15:50] got to keep going I didn't set a timer
[1:15:53] here this is my first timer sit now you
[1:15:56] remember this brother branham asked why
[1:15:57] would God bring me here you ever
[1:15:59] wondered that why did God bring me to
[1:16:02] Akron why did God bring me to Ohio why
[1:16:06] did God bring me here and this is at the
[1:16:08] end of brother branham's life you
[1:16:10] remember this story brother man he I'll
[1:16:13] just go through it quickly he's how in
[1:16:15] Arizona and he doesn't know he's asking
[1:16:17] God God he doesn't see God moving like
[1:16:20] he did this at the end of his life and
[1:16:25] God called him away from Jefferson
[1:16:27] billion a house paid off a house through
[1:16:30] the church there a parsonage he had he
[1:16:33] said a growing thriving Church and God
[1:16:35] called him out of that church to Arizona
[1:16:38] he said I said well I had to come out
[1:16:41] here and separate myself come to this
[1:16:43] desert and I thought wonder why God
[1:16:45] would bring me to a desert out there
[1:16:46] where there's nothing but scorpions and
[1:16:48] gila monsters never wonder that why
[1:16:52] would God call me out here well I have
[1:16:54] wonder that many times why would God
[1:16:56] call me to Pastor a small church all I
[1:16:58] want is a big church so I can just
[1:17:00] pastor full time that's what my flesh
[1:17:01] wants I like to just devote all my
[1:17:04] energy to preaching
[1:17:06] but it seems like God didn't call me to
[1:17:08] that as much as I might like that but
[1:17:12] you wonder why did God bring me out here
[1:17:16] and so you remember the story I read it
[1:17:18] Bota have said not only is it a natural
[1:17:20] desert it's a spiritual desert can
[1:17:24] anybody relate to that
[1:17:25] I feel like Akron is a pretty spiritual
[1:17:28] desert place we don't see people getting
[1:17:31] saved all the time right it's a pretty
[1:17:33] much a spiritual desert why would God
[1:17:35] call us out in the desert and he said
[1:17:39] see even though it's a natural desert he
[1:17:41] said we've got that's the teach us a
[1:17:42] lesson that we have to stand under the
[1:17:44] Spirit of God and your life becomes
[1:17:46] sweet and tender like water brings this
[1:17:48] grass and soft buds in Arizona it won't
[1:17:51] grow these trees would be cactus these
[1:17:54] leaves just wind up and make snickery
[1:17:55] that's the way it is when you get dry
[1:17:57] around the church everybody's sticking
[1:17:59] to one another you know hope we're not
[1:18:02] poking each other and bothering each
[1:18:04] other right with thorns every time I go
[1:18:07] around Jose I'll chose it why you got to
[1:18:08] say that Malachi oh man okay why you
[1:18:11] gotta say those things hope we're not
[1:18:13] sticking each other around the church if
[1:18:14] we are we're in a real desert place but
[1:18:18] you don't do that I know Jose doesn't do
[1:18:20] that now Qaeda knew that so say he said
[1:18:26] even then even the natural things are to
[1:18:28] point us the spiritual things
[1:18:30] so church the reason actor in such a
[1:18:32] desert place is to remind us that in the
[1:18:35] midst of a desert we've got to receive
[1:18:37] the waters of God
[1:18:38] we've got to be the ones because on the
[1:18:41] day of judgment God's going to ask us
[1:18:42] you later to see a rich blind wretched
[1:18:45] all these things naked miserable but yet
[1:18:47] you overcame that God's going to say you
[1:18:49] did it because you saw the conditions
[1:18:52] and you chose to live above those
[1:18:54] conditions you receive the former aid
[1:18:57] and if we live to the rapture will
[1:18:59] receive the latter rain amen but you
[1:19:02] have to swirl they they go after the
[1:19:04] natural things they go after the big
[1:19:05] church a big money all these things but
[1:19:07] we've got to go after Christ so then the
[1:19:12] spiritual desert is even they're
[1:19:13] supposed to remind us to be spiritually
[1:19:15] on fire do you mean a spiritual spot
[1:19:17] where we love Jesus Christ with all of
[1:19:19] our hearts
[1:19:21] and some something said to me maybe
[1:19:23] you're ratting on God's job
[1:19:25] so even Satan's whispering in his mouth
[1:19:27] well maybe a whisper in his ear
[1:19:29] maybe maybe you're not serving God
[1:19:31] enough maybe you're not you're not doing
[1:19:33] the right way so I prayed for a vision
[1:19:35] and Meeta just got me a new Bible and
[1:19:37] brother Brown from Ohio that's the man
[1:19:39] that I met brother Brown brother Tom
[1:19:41] Brown he's passed on now I stayed at his
[1:19:43] house
[1:19:43] one time up from Ohio got me a new Bible
[1:19:46] both them at the same time at Christmas
[1:19:47] I went got one of the new Bibles I said
[1:19:50] Lord the days gone by you had Urim and
[1:19:52] Thummim let me say this he says let me
[1:19:56] say don't do this it's not a good thing
[1:19:57] but I said Lord I used to be when a
[1:19:59] dreamer dreamed a dream they took it
[1:20:01] down the Urim and Thummim and told it
[1:20:02] and if the Urim Thummim flashed the
[1:20:04] lights back in a supernatural light the
[1:20:06] dream was true I said but the priesthood
[1:20:08] that the Urim and Thummim has done away
[1:20:10] with your Bibles Hyrum Thummim now Lord
[1:20:13] may I never do this again but I've asked
[1:20:15] you and prayed to you to give me a
[1:20:16] vision speak to me about why I'm
[1:20:18] dreaming these dreams what have I done
[1:20:19] if I've harmed if I've done anything to
[1:20:21] any person in the world let me know I'll
[1:20:23] go make it right look at that does that
[1:20:25] sound like a real godly repentance he's
[1:20:27] not seeing God he's wondered God called
[1:20:29] him away from everything that was
[1:20:31] growing and thriving in Jeffersonville
[1:20:32] and now he's out in the desert all alone
[1:20:34] the preachers won't invite him to preach
[1:20:36] he's saying God show me a vision why am
[1:20:38] I here I wonder why I'm here
[1:20:41] he's if I'd done anything to anybody let
[1:20:44] me know how go make it right and yet the
[1:20:47] whole time he's right amen the whole
[1:20:51] time he's wondering am i right saying
[1:20:53] saying you didn't read it you read it
[1:20:54] out God's job you didn't do the right
[1:20:56] thing and the whole time he's right
[1:20:57] before God talk about mind battles
[1:20:59] Church now this is a mind battle for a
[1:21:03] 55 year old man who has gone around the
[1:21:07] world seven times he's done everything
[1:21:08] he could for Jesus Christ and this is
[1:21:11] the mind battle he puts on a 55 year old
[1:21:13] Christian veteran who's got the sword of
[1:21:15] the Spirit he's got all the armor of God
[1:21:17] on and this is the battle looks like
[1:21:19] you're out here doing nothing for God
[1:21:22] looks like God sent you out here to
[1:21:25] separate you because you just have a nun
[1:21:26] faith you have a nun good enough job God
[1:21:30] give me a vision
[1:21:31] God why my other show me why God doesn't
[1:21:34] give a vision so his last resort is to
[1:21:36] say God I'm gonna open this Bible and
[1:21:38] whenever I point to just show me what
[1:21:40] you want me to be show me why I'm out
[1:21:42] here his last-ditch effort can I say
[1:21:45] like that he prayed he's asked for
[1:21:48] visions no answer so he opens his Bible
[1:21:51] and I said surely there's something the
[1:21:55] Word of God from Genesis to Revelation
[1:21:56] to some character that you dealt with
[1:21:59] would be the same basis that would be my
[1:22:01] question anyone ever ever anyone ever
[1:22:03] have any questions for God if somebody
[1:22:06] has done something you get after them
[1:22:08] about it then let me turn to that place
[1:22:09] in the Bible and if somebody whatever
[1:22:11] they've done it'll lean my way where
[1:22:13] I've done wrong or something you want me
[1:22:15] to do haven't done let me see the
[1:22:16] character in the Bible like that I
[1:22:18] closed my eyes just that my Bible fall
[1:22:20] open and my finger on a scripture
[1:22:22] Genesis 24/7 let me read that he just
[1:22:27] let the Bible fall open Genesis 24/7 the
[1:22:35] Lord God of heaven which took me from my
[1:22:37] father's house and from the land of my
[1:22:39] kindred and which spake unto me and that
[1:22:41] swear unto me saying unto the I see will
[1:22:43] I give this land he shall send His angel
[1:22:45] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[1:22:47] unto my son from thence amen
[1:22:49] that's Abraham telling Eliezer go out
[1:22:53] and find a wife for my son Isaac and the
[1:22:55] angel of the Lord will be with you yet
[1:22:58] this whole time he's like where's the
[1:22:59] angel where's the vision where's all
[1:23:01] these things and yet God showed him
[1:23:03] there he's with you you're just going
[1:23:05] through trial praise God he said he was
[1:23:11] being set
[1:23:12] to hunt the bride for Isaac children
[1:23:14] over me sure that's that's right with
[1:23:16] the rest of my message pulling out the
[1:23:18] bride
[1:23:19] so God called him out away from
[1:23:22] Jeffersonville so he could go preach at
[1:23:24] other places out there in the Arizona
[1:23:27] area because he says it next
[1:23:31] he said Justin I'm skipping down just
[1:23:34] the perfect message back to the word go
[1:23:36] get that bride that's my dude that's
[1:23:37] where I'm here for that's what I'm
[1:23:38] trying to do is call out a bride he said
[1:23:40] I'm in Arizona to try to call out a
[1:23:42] bride so the muscleman bride members
[1:23:45] that would not have heard about Jesus
[1:23:47] unless brother Branham had moved out
[1:23:49] there amen
[1:23:50] look at Arizona now look at all the
[1:23:51] churches out there serving God look at
[1:23:54] that so God had to separate him from his
[1:23:56] family everything he loved the growing
[1:23:58] thriving church and had to let him go
[1:24:00] through these mind battles in order to
[1:24:02] fulfill the purpose of being Eleazar
[1:24:05] amen hallelujah so his first commission
[1:24:11] was in 1946 the angelic visit in the
[1:24:15] cave see he said May 7th 1946 Green Mill
[1:24:20] Indiana there was an angel come the room
[1:24:22] where I was out a man talking and that's
[1:24:24] where he said about the two gifts he
[1:24:28] said that was the Commission he said
[1:24:30] you're born this world to pray for sick
[1:24:31] people and if you get two people to
[1:24:33] believe you will be sincere when you
[1:24:34] pray nothing shall stand before your
[1:24:36] prayer that was the Commission it's
[1:24:39] Anna's first Commission in 1946 then you
[1:24:42] remember in 1962 God kind of changed it
[1:24:45] a little bit and God took him away from
[1:24:48] going out and praying for the sick
[1:24:50] people and told him to stay in
[1:24:52] Jeffersonville and store up tapes in
[1:24:54] 1962 this is from April so I remember
[1:24:59] Abraham said in the dream I had there
[1:25:00] not long ago I in this dream I was
[1:25:02] supposed to be storing up food in this
[1:25:03] tabernacle you see here in the dream how
[1:25:06] many members in a few weeks ago I
[1:25:07] couldn't give you the interpretation of
[1:25:09] it and it won't take me very long I'll
[1:25:10] just tell you if we'd like to hear it
[1:25:12] nobody says Amen so brother Mayer had a
[1:25:14] dream with his wife and the dream he saw
[1:25:16] George six-second Smith training and
[1:25:19] beating men up in the boxing ring
[1:25:23] and he said dreams are funny no a just I
[1:25:25] looked at my wife in the dream I said
[1:25:27] wife you know he'd give me my first
[1:25:28] training and then you know the dreams
[1:25:30] are funny I come down to a big seat so
[1:25:33] it went from a boxing ring where he sees
[1:25:36] this first trainer and it switches over
[1:25:38] to a sea where there's a bow and two men
[1:25:41] in the boat and the waters are real
[1:25:47] choppy and meet it wasn't with me then
[1:25:48] my wife and the boatsman come over here
[1:25:52] and handed me a little canoe about two
[1:25:54] foot and a half three foot lungs that
[1:25:56] sound like a good boat 2 by 3 I'm like a
[1:25:59] good boat you want to sail the seven
[1:26:01] season two by three see God's not trying
[1:26:05] to confuse us he's not the author of
[1:26:06] confusion looking Church look closely at
[1:26:09] your dreams look closely at the Word of
[1:26:12] God that's been preached to you look
[1:26:13] closely at it God's not trying to hide
[1:26:15] it from us it was a real white just
[1:26:19] plastic and he said here's your bow and
[1:26:21] I said oh I couldn't cross him that he
[1:26:23] said well that'll run 50 miles an hour
[1:26:25] up and up down this way I said am i up
[1:26:28] and down the shore but it won't out
[1:26:29] there he said well go with them and I
[1:26:32] looked in here said brother Woods and
[1:26:33] brothers fred sauceman the two brothers
[1:26:36] was with me the night I dreamed the
[1:26:37] dream and they were setting the green
[1:26:39] canoe with a lot of rigging in at camp
[1:26:40] and rigging tents and so forth they're
[1:26:41] sitting there he said go with them I
[1:26:43] said they're not even boat men I know
[1:26:47] that I said I'm a boat man I know about
[1:26:49] the canoe to handle it but they'll never
[1:26:51] they couldn't make it
[1:26:53] I wouldn't go like that anyhow so
[1:26:56] they're sitting in this 2 by 3 boat with
[1:26:59] all their camping gear in there saying
[1:27:01] let's go sail across this ocean but the
[1:27:04] man said I can't go like that
[1:27:06] he said well they love you he said well
[1:27:09] why don't you go back here and store up
[1:27:16] how many one know the interpretation of
[1:27:18] this dream say no this interpretation so
[1:27:21] I went back in the little place where
[1:27:23] we've been out a little place called
[1:27:24] Klondike about 40 miles from any
[1:27:25] civilization one little store for the
[1:27:28] ranchers and things look like it was a
[1:27:29] Klondike and it turned out to be this
[1:27:31] tabernacle so after the the CC and they
[1:27:35] went to this
[1:27:37] naik and it turned out to be a
[1:27:39] tabernacle and I was standing there
[1:27:41] calling in great barrels of the
[1:27:42] prettiest food I ever seen radishes
[1:27:44] three foot long turnips greens potatoes
[1:27:47] everything he said stole in plenty of it
[1:27:51] see how his standing there just storing
[1:27:53] it in then brother man woke up and
[1:27:55] here's the interpretation of that but
[1:27:58] the random said George Smith represented
[1:28:01] brother Rams first training in the
[1:28:02] prayer lines so Mena and brother bran
[1:28:05] were saying there there that's my first
[1:28:07] trainer that was my first training was
[1:28:09] in the prayer lines in other words the
[1:28:10] first pole the boat represented going
[1:28:14] overseas on an invitation from brother
[1:28:17] Argan bright brother argan bright wanted
[1:28:20] to set up meetings where they preach one
[1:28:22] service and then the rest of it would be
[1:28:24] a vacation and brother may have said no
[1:28:29] there's not even enough preaching to
[1:28:31] call me across the sea in other words I
[1:28:33] shouldn't go across the sea for just one
[1:28:35] service he said so there's the
[1:28:39] interpretation of the dream and then as
[1:28:41] they went along brother argabright
[1:28:43] cancelled the meetings so everything he
[1:28:46] had set up to go across the seas got
[1:28:47] cancelled it didn't work out and God was
[1:28:52] showing him that he's to stay home and
[1:28:53] store up tapes and Meeta had to tell me
[1:28:58] that she didn't want to go so first they
[1:29:00] wanted to go and then she said I didn't
[1:29:02] she didn't want to go and brother are
[1:29:05] termites called and said we have to
[1:29:06] leave on the 20th of May she said that's
[1:29:08] out that's out the children's just taken
[1:29:10] their examination then can't go so the
[1:29:14] children going to school and taking a
[1:29:16] test was a sign to brother Branham that
[1:29:19] he can't take his family overseas you
[1:29:21] see how brother branham a valued
[1:29:23] education you see how we should value
[1:29:25] our education for our children brother
[1:29:29] man took this as a sign all the kids got
[1:29:31] to take their tests it's the it's the
[1:29:33] end-of-the-year test they can't leave so
[1:29:35] we can't go overseas and have a
[1:29:36] preaching and a vacation trip see how
[1:29:39] important education is Church see she
[1:29:44] had it turned down herself because she
[1:29:45] was the one included it was her vacation
[1:29:47] and there it was even dreams
[1:29:49] everything's for a meaning
[1:29:50] everything has got something somewhere
[1:29:52] so dreams have interpretations now what
[1:29:57] I am to do is these things I'm teaching
[1:29:59] on here storing up this food and getting
[1:30:00] them up I want to go now
[1:30:02] I have no definite leading to any place
[1:30:04] but I'm going sowing seeds sent by
[1:30:06] somewhere or by some sent by somewhere
[1:30:09] started so that was on April 1st program
[1:30:13] told this dream that he had about
[1:30:15] storing up food and then he goes from
[1:30:18] April May June July August September
[1:30:20] October November December he goes for
[1:30:22] nine months preaching at the Bram
[1:30:24] Tabernacle mostly storing up all these
[1:30:27] tapes and then he you know this morning
[1:30:33] and that morning on April 1st he took
[1:30:35] his text to preach wisdom versus faith
[1:30:37] and he said now what are we doing trying
[1:30:39] to this morning follow what the Lord
[1:30:41] said lay up food amen so brother
[1:30:45] branham's Commission was in 1946 go pray
[1:30:47] for the sick people but then he had a
[1:30:49] dream in 1962 to go overseas but then
[1:30:53] God told him don't take it it's not
[1:30:55] going to work the boat's not big enough
[1:30:56] store up food so he follows this next
[1:31:00] leading of the Lord what am I saying
[1:31:02] Church we have to follow the voice of
[1:31:04] the Holy Spirit from one leading to the
[1:31:06] next leading if you don't know where God
[1:31:09] caught or what you're supposed to be
[1:31:11] doing look to the last time that God
[1:31:13] called you to do something when was the
[1:31:16] last time your knew you knew you were
[1:31:17] walking the perfect will of God and go
[1:31:20] with that
[1:31:20] praise God go with that brother who
[1:31:24] stayed with that he stayed with doing
[1:31:26] the will of God until God gave him a
[1:31:28] fresh leadership or a fresh word from
[1:31:31] heaven hey hallelujah and he did it
[1:31:34] through a dream the first one was by an
[1:31:37] angel and then God gave these
[1:31:39] supernatural dreams to get him to stay
[1:31:41] home and store up tapes for nine months
[1:31:43] and then in December of 1962 you know he
[1:31:50] got his new Commission and that was to
[1:31:51] go out west praise God in services as
[1:31:57] the end time brother Rams telling the
[1:31:58] vision of when he saw the seven angels
[1:32:01] form the cloud and I'm just going to
[1:32:02] skip ahead he said Lord what
[1:32:04] this vision mean and then it come to me
[1:32:07] not a voice just me
[1:32:08] oh that the angel of the Lord coming to
[1:32:10] give me my new commission and when I
[1:32:13] thought that I just raised up my hand
[1:32:14] said Oh Lord Jesus what will you have me
[1:32:16] to do amen
[1:32:19] now he had been told this vision in 1956
[1:32:25] so he had to wait seven years for the
[1:32:28] interpretation are we willing to wait
[1:32:31] seven years Church for God to show us
[1:32:33] the interpretation it away seven years
[1:32:38] the provision was in 1956 he talks about
[1:32:41] the third pole seven years waiting on
[1:32:44] the Lord I think that was hard might
[1:32:47] have been but Church if you waited upon
[1:32:49] the Lord if you're a real eagle you
[1:32:51] won't get discouraged
[1:32:52] you'll renew your strength Amen Alleluia
[1:32:57] so went from 1946 to 1963 basically on
[1:33:03] one commission that you know the last
[1:33:07] nine months of it yeah he stayed home
[1:33:08] there but then in 1963 he knew him to go
[1:33:11] out west a new Commission and that was
[1:33:14] the third pole because he says it anoint
[1:33:15] it ones at the end time third pole the
[1:33:18] opening of the word the mysteries
[1:33:19] revealed no more there's no more higher
[1:33:22] order to reveal the word than profits
[1:33:24] but the only way the profit can be
[1:33:26] vindicated I'm sorry yeah is by the word
[1:33:31] and remember the third pole was the
[1:33:33] opening of them seven seals two real the
[1:33:35] hidden truth that's been sealed in the
[1:33:36] word all right is everybody okay with
[1:33:42] that by God's grace I'm closing with
[1:33:45] this let me close with this this young
[1:33:47] man's life so we can see the purpose in
[1:33:50] brother Adams life clearly he was called
[1:33:53] to pray for the sick he was called to
[1:33:55] condemn organizations can already see it
[1:33:56] okay and he stayed with his Commission
[1:34:00] that he knew God had called him to stay
[1:34:03] with he stay with that till God did
[1:34:05] something new in his life
[1:34:07] and church we have to do the same thing
[1:34:09] we can't get discouraged well God when
[1:34:11] you're gonna do something new God when
[1:34:12] are you gonna reveal this to me we've
[1:34:14] got to stay positive
[1:34:16] we've got to stay in love with Jesus
[1:34:18] we've got to not look to symptoms not
[1:34:20] look to circumstances but look to the
[1:34:23] Word of God amen
[1:34:25] don't get discouraged don't get
[1:34:27] discouraged in waiting don't get
[1:34:28] defeated stay strong stay confident be
[1:34:31] comforted this very thing the thing that
[1:34:33] God started you he'll perform it to the
[1:34:35] day of Jesus Christ we're talking about
[1:34:39] your purpose we're talking about the
[1:34:41] purpose God placed you on this earth
[1:34:45] now one look at this humble little boy
[1:34:48] there's garnet peak 15 years old he's
[1:34:52] diagnosed with polio I think he lived
[1:34:56] one or two years I just want to close
[1:35:01] with this because I was listening to
[1:35:04] this week and I was just so encouraged
[1:35:07] because remember God had a plan for
[1:35:09] brother Branham and listen God had a
[1:35:11] plan for this little boy even though he
[1:35:14] died at 16 or 17 God still had a purpose
[1:35:17] for him and I think this would be
[1:35:20] humbling for us to see here tonight that
[1:35:22] no matter what your life looks like God
[1:35:25] had a plan for it and you have to be
[1:35:28] able to look back at or look at your
[1:35:30] life and see what did God call me to do
[1:35:32] what is God's purpose for my life and we
[1:35:35] must accept God's purpose for our lives
[1:35:38] now brother Branham is giving the
[1:35:40] funeral he's preaching the funeral of
[1:35:43] garnet peak and this is at the end of 63
[1:35:48] I believe yeah the end of 63 and he's
[1:35:52] preaching you can hear he's preaching to
[1:35:54] his mother and father and family members
[1:35:56] of a boy who just passed away sixteen or
[1:36:00] seventeen year old boy now I said this
[1:36:04] little cold frame laying here none of us
[1:36:06] can say but what he's a part of the
[1:36:08] great economy of God's creation he's a
[1:36:10] part of God's creation he's a man a
[1:36:12] human being that God created he lay
[1:36:15] sleeping now the thing of it is is if he
[1:36:19] served God's purpose in his life then
[1:36:21] there's got to be a resurrection for
[1:36:23] garnet there's no way of getting around
[1:36:26] it he said this is not the end of garnet
[1:36:30] so if we
[1:36:32] God's purpose there'll be a resurrection
[1:36:34] for us he said I'm so happy as far as I
[1:36:38] know within the reach of my
[1:36:40] understandings by the Word of God and by
[1:36:42] the witness of the Holy Spirit this boy
[1:36:44] met that condition he was born of the
[1:36:48] Spirit of God a changed man the Spirit
[1:36:50] of God was upon the little fella he was
[1:36:52] a staunch Christian he served God's
[1:36:55] purpose maybe it was for a short time
[1:37:02] but sometimes God trains men for years
[1:37:07] to get a few days of service out of him
[1:37:11] John the Baptist here's examples John
[1:37:15] the Baptist was 30 years by himself in
[1:37:17] the wilderness for six months of service
[1:37:20] six times three is what I'm sorry
[1:37:23] six times 30 is what 180 God trained him
[1:37:28] for thirty years in the wilderness for a
[1:37:30] hundred eighty days of service 180 days
[1:37:34] and when God described in Isaiah he said
[1:37:37] the mountains will be brought down and
[1:37:39] the valleys will be raised up for a
[1:37:41] hundred eighty days of preaching that's
[1:37:44] how powerful preaching and repentance is
[1:37:47] hey I didn't hear you praise God amen
[1:37:49] and the Bible said he had no miracle
[1:37:52] other than the miracle of repentance and
[1:37:55] water baptism
[1:37:56] amen 180 days and you just went through
[1:38:00] 365 in 2018 he said sometimes
[1:38:07] God will train a man for years for just
[1:38:10] a few days of service not goodness he
[1:38:15] said Jesus Christ was 30 years old for
[1:38:17] three and a half years of service for
[1:38:21] the crucifixion God trains men brings
[1:38:25] him up it's his purpose time is with man
[1:38:28] eternity is with God I believe God
[1:38:34] brought this little boy here on earth
[1:38:35] for a purpose and if you notice right
[1:38:40] the time of his sickness and things this
[1:38:42] struck him for a purpose brother Branham
[1:38:46] said polio was part of God's purpose
[1:38:49] that's what brother Branham says God
[1:38:55] could have made the boy sound and well
[1:38:58] but what he do instead of taking his
[1:39:00] life he let him get up just where he
[1:39:02] wasn't going to die so the his test his
[1:39:06] story as he would get sick call brother
[1:39:07] Branham he get better he gets sick but I
[1:39:10] call brother and me he keep getting
[1:39:11] better and better and better better he
[1:39:15] says but neither did polio kill him he
[1:39:18] didn't die by polios actually influenza
[1:39:20] killed him he didn't die from polio he
[1:39:25] said no other disease killed him that we
[1:39:27] prayed for he and I so every disease
[1:39:28] they prayed for God healed him now the
[1:39:31] last one brother Graham couldn't pray
[1:39:32] him for because he was in a service
[1:39:34] preaching and as soon as he got out he
[1:39:36] went to pray for him but the brother
[1:39:37] said he died at 6 p.m. so he did have a
[1:39:40] chance to pray for him he said and all
[1:39:43] the rest of the Christians around here
[1:39:45] prayed for him it never it never did
[1:39:47] that he said it was Garn it's time to go
[1:39:51] he must he had served his purpose a 17
[1:39:55] year old boy had served his purpose he
[1:39:59] come to Christ he'd been Germanized
[1:40:02] Dorie what if he would have died before
[1:40:05] being germanized polio drove him to God
[1:40:13] amen hallelujah
[1:40:15] think about job's trials Jerome's trial
[1:40:19] seeing his children die draw
[1:40:21] we're not to the devil and drove him to
[1:40:23] God amen hallelujah
[1:40:27] polio drives this man this young boy to
[1:40:32] God sometimes we think why did God allow
[1:40:36] this sure all trials are supposed to
[1:40:38] direct us to God
[1:40:42] polio drove him to God now listen he was
[1:40:45] to be a tobacco auctioneer what he had
[1:40:48] his money I said it wrong earlier not a
[1:40:50] tobacco planter a farmer up tobacco
[1:40:52] auctioneer can I get 25 25 25 about 30 -
[1:40:56] 30 35 40 40 40 145 pity pity is that
[1:40:59] ridiculous or what that's what he wanted
[1:41:02] to be that was in his mind oh if I could
[1:41:04] just grow up and be an NBA basketball
[1:41:06] player that's the same thing as saying
[1:41:09] oh if I could just grow up and be a
[1:41:10] tobacco auctioneer so because he had
[1:41:15] this in his mind brother Branham said
[1:41:17] that's what he had in his mind but that
[1:41:20] wasn't his purpose at all
[1:41:23] hey man how do I know yeah we knew that
[1:41:26] his purpose was to be a Christian
[1:41:31] hallelujah what was your desire before
[1:41:34] you became a Christian I was to go to
[1:41:36] the NFL that was my desire and be a week
[1:41:39] of rich so I could buy my mom a house
[1:41:40] that was my desire but now I'm trying to
[1:41:43] praying that God will give Jesus my
[1:41:45] mother a house in the New Jerusalem
[1:41:46] that's my prayer now he said now if he
[1:41:52] was a tobacco auctioneer somebody might
[1:41:54] have said maybe 78 five years from now
[1:41:56] if the world should stand that long
[1:41:58] garnet was a great auction ear maybe
[1:42:04] that's all the minister could have said
[1:42:05] to this funeral he was a great auction
[1:42:08] hear how sad is that how sad would that
[1:42:12] be if somebody said oh he was just a
[1:42:13] great accountant all she was was a great
[1:42:16] baseball player but instead brother man
[1:42:19] said but what can we say today he's a
[1:42:22] Christian as an auctioneer without the
[1:42:25] germ of life that's just a memory of
[1:42:27] that generation he done among a few men
[1:42:29] but now he's amongst the immortal
[1:42:33] I'll tell ya Laurie a tobacco auctioneer
[1:42:38] might get you some praise of men a few
[1:42:40] men right but a life lived a Christian
[1:42:44] life Dermott eyes that the Holy Ghost
[1:42:45] will get you all kinds of shouting and
[1:42:49] rejoicing with the presence of the
[1:42:50] Angels amen hallelujah
[1:42:56] buh-bam said the last time I spoke to
[1:42:59] him I said brother garnet if you knew
[1:43:03] that you could be well and strong like
[1:43:05] these other boys run up and down the
[1:43:06] roads here with your hot rod running up
[1:43:08] and down the roads and drinking alcohol
[1:43:10] and would not know this message that I
[1:43:13] know he said garnet said I wouldn't swap
[1:43:17] this for ten thousand lives like that
[1:43:21] amen
[1:43:22] in other words if you could give up the
[1:43:25] polio you'd have to give up Christ but
[1:43:28] then you could have all this time
[1:43:29] running around on hot rods he said I
[1:43:31] wouldn't give up Christ for 10,000 lives
[1:43:34] on a hot rod with drunks and women and
[1:43:36] all things like that he said that was a
[1:43:38] real true Christian praise God a young
[1:43:45] I'm sorry eighteen year old boy so I
[1:43:47] said seventeen eighteen eighteen year
[1:43:49] old boys find handsome looking young men
[1:43:51] would probably been a regular target for
[1:43:53] the devil but God had to throw them in
[1:43:56] that stage of polio to get out of him to
[1:43:59] serve the purpose look at his patience
[1:44:02] his testimonies among you neighbors look
[1:44:04] what he was how this little life has
[1:44:06] spoke to so many of you that at the day
[1:44:09] of judgment his life will testify right
[1:44:11] back against you he says he was an
[1:44:14] example of what God wanted him to be he
[1:44:17] served God's purpose that's Ann Murphy
[1:44:26] well
[1:44:27] of course we hate to see this young man
[1:44:29] lying there like that just look like in
[1:44:31] the prime of life but you know he says
[1:44:37] when you take a flower out of your
[1:44:39] flower garden to make a bouquet you
[1:44:41] don't always take the old ones he says
[1:44:47] sometimes you have to take a bud a bud
[1:44:51] has to serve your purpose in a bouquet
[1:44:53] he said maybe God wanted a bud and
[1:44:58] that's what he picked on here for a bud
[1:45:01] for his altar in glory amen hallelujah
[1:45:07] with a guarantee of everything
[1:45:09] testifying that he will rise again our
[1:45:12] face as he right he'll rise again the
[1:45:14] word says arise again the moon the Stars
[1:45:17] the Sun the flowers nature everything
[1:45:20] says he'll rise again I'll tell you why
[1:45:24] because the seed of eternal life was
[1:45:27] planted and germanized in his soul so he
[1:45:31] says all these things testify that he'll
[1:45:34] rise again praise God I'll stop right
[1:45:40] there by the grace of Lord you can
[1:45:42] switch over to songs here
