[45:12] God
[45:14] amen glory let's take our Bibles tonight
[45:16] by God's
[45:17] grace I've been uh let's go to Daniel
[45:20] chapter one I've been looking at uh
[45:21] doing a series on the Book of Daniel you
[45:23] know it's only 12 chapters so I'd like
[45:25] to start a series on that tonight Daniel
[45:27] chapter 1 we'll go to verse one by God's
[45:35] grace so we're going to keep doing the
[45:37] church ages we'll probably look at them
[45:38] on Sunday by God's grace but I like to
[45:40] do a couple different thoughts at the
[45:42] same time I'm still looking at the the
[45:44] the proof of God series I did one on
[45:46] that and i' been studying on that too
[45:48] and just waiting for the inspiration you
[45:50] know for each message and uh studying on
[45:52] that by God's grace but I want to go to
[45:54] Daniel chapter 1 tonight
[45:57] and we'll look at a purposed heart
[45:59] tonight that's a little subtitle Daniel
[46:01] chapter 1 a purposed
[46:03] heart Daniel's heart was purposed to
[46:07] obey the word of the Lord so we want to
[46:08] look at that that great attribute of
[46:09] that great man of
[46:11] God in Daniel chapter
[46:14] one I'm really uh quite inspired I think
[46:17] I've been looking at this for a few
[46:18] weeks want to look at Daniel um but I
[46:22] really I'm really inspired to go to the
[46:23] prophetic part at the end of the book
[46:25] like chapter 78 8 9 10 11 and 12 I
[46:28] really want to I want to just build my
[46:29] way up there by God's grace so we can
[46:31] get a good picture of the whole
[46:33] chapter and as we're working with of
[46:35] course Revelation I believe it all tied
[46:38] together by God's grace So Daniel
[46:40] chapter
[46:41] 1 we just
[46:45] um we'll just read uh well I said verse
[46:49] one but let's go to
[46:51] verse eight let's just read one verse
[46:53] tonight I want to just focus on verse
[46:55] eight well when we start preaching
[46:56] preach 1 through eight but I want to
[46:58] just read
[47:03] eight now the word purpose means
[47:06] directed or set upon So Daniel directed
[47:10] in his heart so he had a direction he
[47:13] had a he he had a goal he knew what he
[47:14] was doing in verse
[47:16] eight let's read this together just
[47:19] verse eight 1 two 3 but Daniel purposed
[47:22] in his heart that he would not defile
[47:25] himself with the portion of the king's
[47:27] meat nor with the wine which he drank
[47:31] therefore he requested of the prince of
[47:33] the Unix that he might not defile
[47:35] himself
[47:37] amen praise God how many want to keep
[47:39] themselves pure praise God and stay stay
[47:41] from being defiled amen let's just bow
[47:43] our heads on your heart just make it
[47:45] known unto God as we pray heavenly
[47:47] father as your Prophet said we are in
[47:49] the midst of a modern Babylon Daniel was
[47:53] here in physical Babylon but Lord we're
[47:55] in the midst of uh literal Babylon Lord
[47:58] a modern Babylon an age of Destruction
[48:01] and confusion and perversion and father
[48:03] we want to look at Daniel's life and we
[48:05] want to look at all the prophetic Lord
[48:07] but we want to look at his holy life
[48:09] Lord his purpose Heart Lord for that
[48:12] will mean a lot to us I believe as this
[48:14] series goes on we thank you Lord for
[48:16] this word that we've read help us to
[48:18] purpose in our hearts that we won't be
[48:19] defiled with anything from the world
[48:21] Grant it Lord Jesus as we give you glory
[48:23] tonight and help us to preach this Thy
[48:25] word help us all to believe your word
[48:27] with all of our hearts in Jesus Christ's
[48:29] name everybody said amen God bless you
[48:31] to being seated praise
[48:38] God i' like to take this thought here
[48:40] tonight A A purposed heart we'll look at
[48:42] Daniel Mali I have a few slides here so
[48:46] you're ready bu can flip
[48:52] over so um I'll just show a little bit
[48:55] of a timeline I want to kind of do a
[48:56] little back background on Daniel tonight
[48:58] and preach maybe those first eight
[48:59] verses or
[49:01] so I think you'll be blessed and I got
[49:04] some quotes from brother brandom and
[49:05] everything like that so let's just start
[49:07] there I just found this one on the
[49:08] internet I like that one Daniel's kind
[49:10] of like telling him no we don't want the
[49:12] Kings meet you know so uh purpose heart
[49:16] uh let's look at Daniel here tonight so
[49:18] let's do a little background here on
[49:21] Daniel I'm going to read a little bit
[49:23] from the scoffield background here so
[49:25] they have like you know they have
[49:27] summaries you know before each book so
[49:28] I'm going to read a little bit out of
[49:29] here to get a little background on
[49:32] Daniel and let me uh while you're you
[49:34] know while I'm reading this let me skip
[49:35] ahead to here so you get an idea where
[49:38] we are in history okay so this is of
[49:39] course when Christ was
[49:41] born uh getting an idea this is where
[49:43] Solomon was Solomon was ruling about a
[49:45] thousand BC and so Daniel's born about
[49:49] 623 BC if my math is right because um
[49:53] the history says in 607 he was taken
[49:56] into Babylon at 16 years old that's
[50:00] that's what one historical article I
[50:02] said so um I just trust those guys and
[50:04] if they're they're probably not if
[50:05] they're wrong they're probably not too
[50:06] wrong they're probably pretty close
[50:09] because they've done a lot they've done
[50:10] their homework um so I just want to
[50:13] while you're looking at that I just like
[50:14] to read this here Daniel was like
[50:16] Ezekiel and was a Jewish captive in
[50:19] Babylon so Ezekiel was in the same spot
[50:21] he was in a different spot uh but still
[50:24] a captive Daniel was of royal or
[50:27] princely descent as we'll see so he he
[50:29] was of a family a rich family we'd say
[50:31] he was in a highly respected royal
[50:34] family so he wasn't some he wasn't a
[50:36] poor person or he wasn't a beggar or
[50:38] anything like that he was raised in we'd
[50:40] say wealth and privilege uh he was
[50:42] living a privileged
[50:44] life for his Rank and his comeliness he
[50:47] was trained for Palace
[50:50] service okay so when Babylon brought him
[50:52] over they knew he was a royal family and
[50:55] because he would lived such a maybe a
[50:57] blessed life they wanted to train him to
[50:59] be a servant in the Palace of
[51:03] Nebuchadnezzar now it says in the
[51:06] polluted atmosphere of an oriental Court
[51:08] he lived a life of singular piety or
[51:11] Holiness and separateness and usefulness
[51:14] so he's very holy and he's very useful
[51:16] to his employer don't you want to be
[51:18] like that don't you want your boss or
[51:20] your employer look at you and say my
[51:21] they're very useful to me because they
[51:23] they're so obedient they do exactly what
[51:26] I asked them to do
[51:27] he was a very good
[51:28] worker his long life extended from
[51:31] Nebuchadnezzar all the way to
[51:33] Cyrus he was a contemporary of Jeremiah
[51:37] so at the same time contemporary means
[51:39] ministering at the same time so while
[51:40] Daniel was uh serving right there in
[51:43] Babylon these men of God were also
[51:45] during his lifetime ministering which
[51:48] were Jeremiah just in different location
[51:51] Ezekiel and then Joshua the high priest
[51:53] of the restoration Ezra and zerubabel so
[51:56] Daniel during Daniel's Ministry in
[51:58] Babylon uh there was a revival going on
[52:00] in Israel they were rebuilding the
[52:02] temple under zerubabel and Nehemiah
[52:04] they're real reestablishing that so this
[52:07] also gives us courage to know that while
[52:09] God is blessing the Revival in Israel
[52:11] God's still with Daniel praise God
[52:14] Daniel no matter where you are Church no
[52:16] matter where you find yourself all alone
[52:18] or with the big crowd the big church or
[52:20] the small Church no matter where you
[52:21] find yourself God is with anybody who
[52:23] serves him amen anybody that will love
[52:26] him and keep his commands God will be
[52:28] with him
[52:30] Hallelujah so we see that it's all about
[52:33] the same time here
[52:37] now it says Daniel is distinctively the
[52:40] prophet of the times of the Gentiles so
[52:42] if you got your Bible let's go to Luke
[52:44] 21:24 I don't have it up there but uh
[52:46] I'll just I want you to see it Luke
[52:49] 21:24 some of you are familiar with this
[52:52] uh but let's read that Luke 21:24
[52:58] I'll get it in my
[53:00] Bible he's the prophet of the times of
[53:03] the
[53:05] Gentiles and how many know we're still
[53:06] in the times of Gentiles amen right now
[53:08] we're still in the times of the Gentiles
[53:10] Gentiles have Grace Gentiles are grasped
[53:12] into the life of God the tree of God and
[53:15] and we're what not what what's now is
[53:16] growing is the bride tree praise God the
[53:19] Bride of Jesus Christ the Gentile bride
[53:22] she's gra that Branch was grafted in now
[53:24] she's becoming a a mature tree praise
[53:26] God looking to the coming of the Lord
[53:29] amen now verse
[53:34] 24 okay let's read 24 and they shall
[53:37] fall by the edge of the sword and shall
[53:39] be led away captive into all nations and
[53:42] Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the
[53:45] Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
[53:48] be
[53:49] fulfilled now let's back up to verse 20
[53:52] can we just go to chapter 21 verse 20
[53:53] let's back up a little bit now remember
[53:55] what did Jesus just say Jesus said that
[53:57] Israel would be carried away captive
[53:58] again right and they were they were
[54:01] again spread by who does anybody
[54:02] remember by Titus remember in 87 8070
[54:06] Titus uh came to Jerusalem he destroyed
[54:09] the temple blood ran out of the temple
[54:11] like a river they said uh so many
[54:13] killings in there because they rejected
[54:15] their Messiah and so Jesus connects uh
[54:20] this this event here and he connects it
[54:22] to the times of the Gentiles let's go to
[54:24] verse 20 when you shall Jerusalem
[54:27] compass with armies then know that the
[54:29] Desolation thereof is nine that was the
[54:31] armies of Titus of
[54:33] course then let them which are in Judea
[54:36] flee to the mountains and let them which
[54:38] are in the midst of it depart out and
[54:40] let not them that are in the countries
[54:42] enter there
[54:43] into so don't come back into Jerusalem
[54:46] because uh Rome's going to take over
[54:48] verse 22 for these be the days of
[54:50] Vengeance that all things which are
[54:52] written may be fulfilled W but woe unto
[54:54] them that are with child and them that
[54:56] give suck in those days for there shall
[54:58] be great distress in the land and wrath
[55:01] upon this people praise God then we get
[55:05] to the scripture we just read and they
[55:07] shall fall by the edge of the sword
[55:09] speaking of Israel and shall be led away
[55:11] captive in all nations and Jerusalem
[55:13] shall be trotten down of the Gentiles
[55:15] into the times of the
[55:17] Gentiles be
[55:18] fulfilled okay praise God so I think
[55:20] everybody can see that uh by God's grace
[55:23] So Daniel is the prophet to the times of
[55:26] the the Gentiles which means he foretold
[55:28] when they would start and he foretold
[55:30] when they would finish amen by God's
[55:33] grace now no man knows the day of the
[55:34] hour but Daniel told all the events of
[55:36] the Daniel's 70 weeks right the 490
[55:39] years and we still got three and a half
[55:41] years of those left amen three and a
[55:44] half years a half of the 70th week is
[55:46] still unfulfilled so the Jews still have
[55:49] that much time uh to serve the Lord and
[55:51] they'll get that under the ministry of
[55:53] God's two prophets Moses and Elijah
[55:56] so now let's go back to uh Daniel
[55:58] chapter
[56:02] 1 and uh let's look at verse one let's
[56:05] kind of build our way up here and we'll
[56:06] see how far we can get here so anyways I
[56:10] just put this slide up there that you
[56:11] know I was reading on the britanica and
[56:13] they said well Daniel had a lot of
[56:14] things wrong and uh Daniel had
[56:16] prophecies that were wrong and dates
[56:18] that were wrong and how many believe
[56:19] Daniel didn't have it wrong I believe
[56:21] Daniel had it right I believe
[56:23] britannica's got it wrong by God's grace
[56:26] because Jesus validated Daniel and we
[56:28] just read it we just read it now uh
[56:33] actually yeah let's we'll just read this
[56:34] up here uh Jesus mentions Daniel right
[56:37] here now this is spoken of the same
[56:40] scripture here that we referenced but
[56:41] it's just a parallel passage which means
[56:44] Luke 21 was speaking of the same thing
[56:46] we see in D or Matthew chapter 24 it's
[56:49] the same
[56:50] thing when ye therefore shall see the
[56:53] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[56:56] Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy
[56:58] Place who so readeth let him understand
[57:02] then let them which be in Judea flee
[57:04] into the mountains let him which is on
[57:06] the housetop not come down to take
[57:08] anything out of his house so we get the
[57:11] same idea the same idea when the daily
[57:14] sacrifice was taken away when Titus came
[57:17] in uh history says that Christians left
[57:19] Jerusalem four years before Titus came
[57:21] the Holy Spirit had warned them to leave
[57:24] see God always keeps the Holy Spirit
[57:26] Filled from destruction God always
[57:28] protects his children but at at some
[57:30] point they surrounded Israel and then uh
[57:33] they basically starved Israel out it was
[57:36] one of the awfulest uh uh sieges ever
[57:39] recorded in history when Rome and Titus
[57:41] surrounded Jerusalem and starved them
[57:44] for four or five years and uh so much so
[57:46] they had no animals left and the daily
[57:48] sacrifice was taken away and Jesus
[57:51] mentioned it here uh that they would
[57:54] have to flee to the mountains
[57:56] and many of them that did uh some of
[57:58] them made it but many that didn't were
[58:00] slaughtered even though they tried to
[58:01] flee they were
[58:03] slaughtered but I want you to see that
[58:05] here that Jesus validated Daniel the
[58:07] Prophet like some people say oh Jonah
[58:10] how could Jonah be a true story how
[58:11] could there be such a fish how could
[58:13] there be a whale that size to swallow a
[58:15] fish but the fact is Jesus referenced
[58:18] Jonah GE Jesus said as Jonas was in the
[58:21] belly of the whale three days and three
[58:23] nights so the son of man must be in the
[58:24] heart of the earth three days and three
[58:25] nights how many you know that so a real
[58:29] believer looks at the words of Christ
[58:30] and said I'm either going to believe
[58:32] science or so-called science right
[58:34] science falsely so-called remember that
[58:36] when we preach on that it's science
[58:38] falsely socalled it's not really science
[58:40] amen uh just lot so many of them are
[58:42] lies but are we going to believe a lie
[58:45] from a scientific organization or we
[58:47] gonna believe Jesus Christ let's stand
[58:49] with Jesus Christ amen If he if he
[58:52] validated Jonah if he validated Daniel
[58:54] then he'll validate us as well because
[58:56] we believe it amen we're not believing
[58:58] anything that contradicts God's holy
[59:00] word amen so now let's go back to Daniel
[59:04] chapter 1 here now now we can go back
[59:06] there I just want to make sure I read
[59:07] that that Jesus validated uh Daniel the
[59:13] Prophet all
[59:15] right now as you read this the meaning
[59:18] of the name Daniel it means God is my
[59:21] judge which is an interesting uh meaning
[59:24] to his name there God is my judge
[59:27] I'll say like this he sure acted like
[59:28] God was going to judge him because he he
[59:29] watched his life amen not in a bad way
[59:33] but in a good way God was watching over
[59:35] his life and his name means God is my
[59:37] judge he's probably 16 years old when
[59:40] taken into captivity and brought to
[59:42] Babylon in 607
[59:44] BC all right so I'm going to put it back
[59:46] up on that again so you can see that
[59:48] light that timeline there now let's go
[59:51] to Daniel chapter 1 verse one we'll
[59:52] start looking at the scriptures here
[59:57] in the third year of the reign of jeim
[1:00:00] king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King
[1:00:02] of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged
[1:00:06] it and the lord gave jeho Kim King of
[1:00:09] Judah into his hand with part of the
[1:00:11] vessels of the house of God which he
[1:00:13] carried into the land of shinar to the
[1:00:16] house of his God and he brought the
[1:00:18] vessels into the Treasure House of his
[1:00:21] God and the King spake
[1:00:24] unto aspan the master of his unic that
[1:00:27] he should bring certain of the children
[1:00:29] of Israel and of the king's seed and of
[1:00:32] the princes praise God so here's your
[1:00:35] scripture if you say well brother Jess
[1:00:37] where does it say the Bible said that
[1:00:38] Daniel was of the king's seed right here
[1:00:40] verse three certain of the king seed so
[1:00:43] he was somewhere down the lineage uh and
[1:00:46] one of the descendants of one of the
[1:00:48] Kings
[1:00:50] here now verse four children in whom was
[1:00:54] no blemish but well favored and skillful
[1:00:58] in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge
[1:01:02] and understanding science so these were
[1:01:04] scientific Jews they were very smart
[1:01:06] they understood science and such as had
[1:01:08] ability in them to stand the king's
[1:01:11] Palace and whom they might teach the
[1:01:13] learning and the tongue of the Chans So
[1:01:17] Daniel 16 and they look around and say
[1:01:19] well we're some good boys we're some
[1:01:22] strong smart men a young men that we can
[1:01:24] teach our wisdom and our understanding
[1:01:26] and they found some they found him they
[1:01:28] were in the King's family and Daniel was
[1:01:30] one of them so Daniel like we said he
[1:01:32] wasn't uh wasn't a poor boy he wasn't a
[1:01:35] cast out he was in the very one of the
[1:01:37] most highly favored of all the children
[1:01:40] so see God can use people out of the
[1:01:41] rich house as well right like we said
[1:01:43] now it's hard for a rich man to be saved
[1:01:45] but God can save a rich man right we've
[1:01:47] been looking at you know how in the
[1:01:49] samon church age how things are always
[1:01:51] God usually has poor people poor people
[1:01:53] poor people and he usually does but
[1:01:55] here's a time where he had a godly man
[1:01:57] who was actually of a well-favored home
[1:02:00] of a we'd say Royal
[1:02:03] seed verse five and the King appointed
[1:02:06] them a daily provision of the king's
[1:02:09] meat and of the wine which he drank so
[1:02:13] nourishing them three years that at the
[1:02:15] end thereof they might stand before the
[1:02:19] king so look even the king had a little
[1:02:22] a time period where he wanted to train
[1:02:23] them up for three years so if he's 16 he
[1:02:26] have to be 19 right if it was three
[1:02:27] years if that was the actual date the
[1:02:30] king's got to prepare need a lot of
[1:02:32] training need a lot of understanding a
[1:02:34] lot of teaching have to learn all the
[1:02:36] customs of the Babylonians and so the
[1:02:38] king say well give me be three
[1:02:40] years uh before you stand before the
[1:02:43] king now verse six now among these were
[1:02:46] of the children of Judah
[1:02:48] Daniel haniah mishel and
[1:02:52] Azariah unto whom I'm sorry it's verse
[1:02:55] seven on whom the prince of the unic
[1:02:58] gave names for he gave unto Daniel the
[1:03:00] name of belto shazar and to hananiah of
[1:03:04] Shadrach and unto mishel of meach and to
[1:03:08] Azariah
[1:03:10] Abednego verse eight here's what we like
[1:03:13] by God's grace but Daniel purposed in
[1:03:16] his heart that he would not defile
[1:03:18] himself with the portion of the king's
[1:03:21] meat nor with the
[1:03:24] wine which he drank therefore he
[1:03:26] requested of the prince of the Unix that
[1:03:28] he might not defile
[1:03:31] himself now God had brought Daniel into
[1:03:34] favor and tender love with the prince of
[1:03:38] the
[1:03:38] Unix
[1:03:40] amen by now I got some quotes where
[1:03:43] brother BR talks about this in just a
[1:03:45] minute
[1:03:47] um so we'll look at that shortly here I
[1:03:51] want to look something up real quick
[1:03:58] pardon
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] me now let's look at verse uh 10
[1:04:06] here verse 10 and the prince of the unic
[1:04:09] said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king
[1:04:12] who ha appointed your meat and your
[1:04:14] drink for why should he see your faces
[1:04:17] worse liking than the children which are
[1:04:19] of your sort then shall you
[1:04:22] make me in danger my head to the king so
[1:04:27] the servant's like if you don't obey if
[1:04:28] I don't make you obey the King's Command
[1:04:31] he's going to take my head so you got to
[1:04:33] do what I ask you to do verse 11 then
[1:04:36] said Daniel to melzar whom the prince of
[1:04:39] the Unix had set over Daniel hananiah
[1:04:41] and mishel and Azariah prove thy
[1:04:44] servants I beseech thee 10 days so give
[1:04:46] us 10 days let us test this for 10
[1:04:50] days and let uh them give us pulse to
[1:04:54] eat
[1:04:56] and water to
[1:04:57] drink then let our countenances be
[1:05:00] looked upon before thee and the
[1:05:02] countenance of the children that eat
[1:05:04] things me as thou seest deal with thy
[1:05:09] servants so he consented to them in this
[1:05:12] matter and prove them 10 days
[1:05:17] amen so I want you to notice Daniel's
[1:05:20] heart in verse
[1:05:21] eight he purposed in his heart he would
[1:05:24] not defile him self so he sent a
[1:05:26] direction even though I'm living in
[1:05:29] Babylon I've got a direction I've got a
[1:05:32] uh I've got a goal I've got a reach I
[1:05:34] cannot defile myself against the word of
[1:05:37] God I've got to keep God's word I've got
[1:05:40] to honor God's word I've got to live a
[1:05:42] Godly life even though very few people
[1:05:44] are going to live it amen in the midst
[1:05:46] of sinners in other words I've got to
[1:05:48] have that purpose I've got to be in
[1:05:50] other words I've got I've got to already
[1:05:52] have it decided I've already got to have
[1:05:53] an answer when someone comes up and
[1:05:55] offers me drugs I've already got to have
[1:05:57] it decided when someone comes up and
[1:05:59] offers me free tickets to the movies
[1:06:02] praise God I've already got to have it
[1:06:04] decided when someone says well don't you
[1:06:06] want to skip church and go somewhere
[1:06:07] this or that or don't you w to uh do
[1:06:09] this or that don't you want to go do
[1:06:11] this and go look at that and go that
[1:06:12] you've already got to have a purpose in
[1:06:14] your heart that I'm not going to do that
[1:06:16] because I'm not going to defile myself
[1:06:18] amen and at now church at 16 years old
[1:06:21] he had this how many wish you would have
[1:06:23] had at 16 I wish I would have I wish I
[1:06:26] got it about 19 that's when I really got
[1:06:27] my purpose in my heart to serve the Lord
[1:06:29] so I was about three years behind but
[1:06:31] Daniel was 16 years
[1:06:34] old and at the pressure of can you
[1:06:36] imagine like can you imagine being 16
[1:06:38] years old in the White House okay and
[1:06:40] they say we got to eat Donald Trump's
[1:06:42] food you got to eat his diet you know
[1:06:44] that's kind of like the same thing you
[1:06:46] got to eat their diet and you gotta
[1:06:48] follow all the laws of the land right
[1:06:50] because that Nebuchadnezzar was uh the
[1:06:52] world ruler at that time he was even
[1:06:54] greater than Donald Trump was far as
[1:06:56] ruler and so forth like
[1:06:58] that so he said I've already got a
[1:07:00] purpose I've already got a direction I'm
[1:07:02] not going to follow
[1:07:05] myself not with the meat and not with
[1:07:08] the wine so what does he do he ask his
[1:07:11] boss for a
[1:07:12] request praise God so when your job asks
[1:07:15] you to do something contrary to God's
[1:07:16] word this is how you approach him you
[1:07:18] approach him with
[1:07:19] wisdom you make a request can I please
[1:07:23] now for sisters I've talked to numerous
[1:07:24] sisters on the phone phone this last
[1:07:26] year different ones that called me one
[1:07:27] from called me from New Jersey and said
[1:07:29] well what if my my employer says I can't
[1:07:31] wear skirts and I said well ask your
[1:07:33] employer if you
[1:07:34] can and she's like oh I never thought
[1:07:36] about
[1:07:38] that she just saw everybody wearing
[1:07:41] pants and I so she called me and said
[1:07:43] you know from New Jersey and said well I
[1:07:45] drive into New York City and work there
[1:07:46] every day you know I and I got to dress
[1:07:48] like all the people there I said well
[1:07:50] why don't you ask if you don't have to
[1:07:52] because that's what Daniel did Daniel
[1:07:54] just asked and he requested said would
[1:07:56] it be possible that I keep my
[1:07:58] convictions and still work here that's
[1:08:01] what we should do if your employer ask
[1:08:03] you to break God's word say please I I I
[1:08:05] appreciate this job I don't want to
[1:08:07] break God's word I want to keep God's
[1:08:09] word that's what Daniel did he didn't
[1:08:12] fight anybody he didn't Slaughter
[1:08:13] anybody he didn't try to kill anybody he
[1:08:15] just made a humble
[1:08:17] request 16 years old too he's not even a
[1:08:21] grown man we'd say as far as 21 years
[1:08:23] old
[1:08:26] so he makes a request I just want to
[1:08:28] keep myself pure and in verse
[1:08:32] n God had brought Daniel so during this
[1:08:35] time God brought Daniel into favor and
[1:08:37] tender love with the prince of the Unix
[1:08:40] now I want to go back to slide
[1:08:44] here maybe I didn't copy it oh I think I
[1:08:47] did here pardon me I did uh if you got
[1:08:48] your Bibles I think it's right here yeah
[1:08:51] go to Daniel 9:23 look at
[1:08:53] this Daniel 1 n and Daniel 123 kind of
[1:08:57] tie
[1:08:59] together I'm going to put this in here
[1:09:01] real
[1:09:07] quick did you catch that church that
[1:09:10] even the Sinners fell in love with
[1:09:11] Daniel everybody see that the unic
[1:09:14] started to love this guy just being
[1:09:17] around him a 16y old man they just
[1:09:19] started falling in love with
[1:09:21] Daniel well later we're going to find
[1:09:23] out why he had an excellent Spirit on
[1:09:26] he had the right Spirit on
[1:09:29] him now we know there's very aggressive
[1:09:31] men of God in the Bible like like Samson
[1:09:33] right he didn't try to make friends with
[1:09:35] the Philistines he whipped them so see
[1:09:39] God's got a variety how many you believe
[1:09:40] that God has the variety some people are
[1:09:43] more uh gung-ho you know some Believers
[1:09:45] are more take it like brother B said
[1:09:48] Bulldog faith and they're not GNA you
[1:09:50] know they're not going to take anything
[1:09:51] you know but look how look how G Daniel
[1:09:56] was he was a very gentle and careful uh
[1:10:01] and had an excellent spirit that means
[1:10:03] his Spirit wasn't contrary you know it
[1:10:04] wasn't wasn't an evil spirit it was the
[1:10:07] right Spirit he knew how to approach
[1:10:08] people he knew how to approach Sinners
[1:10:10] if the right Spirit on him amen he never
[1:10:12] exalted himself above the Sinners right
[1:10:15] he knew he was had a high calling but he
[1:10:17] treated them with respect how many want
[1:10:18] to show respect to all the Sinners I do
[1:10:21] want to respect all of them if Jesus
[1:10:23] called Judas friend we should call our
[1:10:25] enemies friends as well amen now Daniel
[1:10:28] 9:23 I'm not there anybody got that i'
[1:10:30] like to read that Daniel 9:23 brother
[1:10:32] Adam thank you
[1:10:33] sir at the beginning of the supplication
[1:10:36] the Commandments came forth and I am
[1:10:40] come to show thee for thou art greatly
[1:10:43] beloved therefore understand the the
[1:10:46] manner and consider the vision amen
[1:10:49] praise
[1:10:51] God now if you read in verse 21 who's
[1:10:54] speaking in Daniel here
[1:10:56] Gabriel Gabriel's an angel right he's an
[1:10:59] angel and Gabriel tells him Daniel your
[1:11:02] prayer was heard you're greatly beloved
[1:11:05] now if an angel told me I was greatly
[1:11:07] beloved I'd Rejoice amen because Angel
[1:11:11] is a messenger of God is that right so
[1:11:14] he's bringing God's message so God must
[1:11:16] have told Gabriel tell Daniel I love him
[1:11:18] greatly praise God and God loves us
[1:11:22] greatly amen the Bible said where with
[1:11:23] the great love he hath loved us amen
[1:11:26] but here it gets a personal note from
[1:11:28] God you're greatly
[1:11:30] loved so not only did God love him but
[1:11:33] even the Sinners Babylonians loved him I
[1:11:36] hope that can be your testimony I hope
[1:11:37] when you go out in the world I hope
[1:11:39] people fall in love with you because
[1:11:40] you're so sweet and kind praise God now
[1:11:43] not compromising with sin not laughing
[1:11:45] at adultery or not not laughing at dirty
[1:11:48] jokes or not joining in cussing or
[1:11:50] joining in that's not I'm talking about
[1:11:52] but just being kind and respectful and
[1:11:54] realizing in that that's a person that
[1:11:56] God created there's a soul behind that
[1:11:59] body and that soul is worth 10,000
[1:12:01] worlds amen Daniel had an excellent
[1:12:05] Spirit not an argumentative Spirit not a
[1:12:08] critical spirit not a depressed Spirit
[1:12:11] he had an excellent Spirit Hallelujah
[1:12:13] now look at now Daniel
[1:12:15] 10:11 Daniel 1011
[1:12:26] Daniel 10:11
[1:12:31] there all right verse
[1:12:37] 11 and he said unto me oh Daniel a man
[1:12:39] greatly
[1:12:41] beloved Hallelujah understand the words
[1:12:44] that I speak unto thee and stand upright
[1:12:47] For unto thee am I now sent and when he
[1:12:49] had spoken this word unto me I stood
[1:12:52] trembling ah praise God
[1:12:56] look at this great life that he lived
[1:12:58] amen what a wonderful man of
[1:13:01] God so I give you three witnesses
[1:13:04] there history says he was loved by by
[1:13:08] his co-workers praise God he was loved
[1:13:10] on the job Sinners loved him and not
[1:13:13] only that but more importantly God loved
[1:13:15] him
[1:13:17] amen and let me uh can I just look that
[1:13:21] up real quick I want to show because
[1:13:22] brother Austin's here tonight so happy
[1:13:23] to have him here tonight but let me look
[1:13:25] that up where a great love wherewith he

[1:13:40] love where and he loved us does God love

[1:13:52] didn't earn salvation Grace saved you
[1:13:54] amen unmar favor because his great love
[1:13:59] wherewith he loved us so not only did
[1:14:01] God love Daniel greatly he loved you
[1:14:03] greatly too praise God now the beautiful
[1:14:06] thing I want to show on that slide
[1:14:07] though what I found reading was that
[1:14:10] remember uh Daniel had intimate
[1:14:13] communion with God remember he prayed
[1:14:15] three times a
[1:14:16] day he prayed in the morning on his
[1:14:18] knees at noon and the evening time he
[1:14:20] played prayed at least three times a day
[1:14:23] he took time out of his work he go pray
[1:14:25] took time in the morning took time in
[1:14:26] the evening he prayed out three times a
[1:14:28] day how many want to do that by God's
[1:14:29] grace
[1:14:31] Hallelujah he was a dedicated
[1:14:35] man so like the Beloved disciple and the
[1:14:39] apocalyptic Seer of the New Testament
[1:14:42] John Daniel also is called a man greatly
[1:14:46] beloved and this is twice by the angel
[1:14:49] of the Lord amen hallelujah now did you
[1:14:52] catch that like brother brandom said did
[1:14:54] you catch that on
[1:14:56] Sunday Daniel was greatly beloved and so
[1:14:59] is St John how many know that they saw
[1:15:01] some of the same Visions anybody know
[1:15:03] that they saw some of the same
[1:15:05] Visions did you know that of the white
[1:15:07] Throne judgment John and Daniel saw the
[1:15:10] same vision of the white Throne judgment
[1:15:12] amen the very same thing and both of
[1:15:16] them are called greatly beloved of God
[1:15:19] Amen is't that interesting praise God
[1:15:22] and both of them wrote uh extremely
[1:15:25] important Prophecies of the future some
[1:15:28] of them we're still waiting on tonight
[1:15:30] by God's grace amen glory let's go back
[1:15:34] to Daniel chapter 1 please let's go back
[1:15:40] there and I think I'm gonna uh read this
[1:15:43] quote
[1:15:47] now I think I use this on
[1:15:50] uh few weeks ago yeah let's read this
[1:15:53] quote from 1953 God talked to Moses we
[1:15:56] read through this story where Daniel
[1:15:57] asked permission as a 16-year-old boy
[1:16:00] can I please not eat the meat can I
[1:16:02] please not drink the wine I've got a
[1:16:04] Kosher diet how many know the Jews have
[1:16:06] a Kosher diet they can't eat certain
[1:16:09] things
[1:16:11] right
[1:16:16] now we'll read this quote in just a
[1:16:18] moment I was looking I was trying to
[1:16:19] look up here the exact foods that they
[1:16:21] couldn't eat because I just thought of
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:25] I can't find a quick list so
[1:16:28] okay
[1:16:32] oh all right well I'll have to look
[1:16:34] again sorry this is the quote and Daniel
[1:16:37] purposed in his heart that he would not
[1:16:38] defile himself with the king's
[1:16:41] meat when you say you're going to do
[1:16:43] anything going to accept your healing or
[1:16:45] you're going to accept the baptism of
[1:16:47] the Holy Ghost that's when the
[1:16:50] devil flies on you with all four feet he
[1:16:53] said that's right
[1:16:56] when he got down there he said he W he
[1:16:57] said what he was going to do the king
[1:16:59] come around and seeing there was an
[1:17:00] excellent spirit in
[1:17:03] Daniel so he said now you put them
[1:17:05] fellows over there and feed him can you
[1:17:07] imagine being 16 years old and you're
[1:17:09] already trained up with excellent Spirit
[1:17:12] what would that be church that would be
[1:17:13] God's gift to you praise God God's Gift
[1:17:16] of certain uh gifts in your life how
[1:17:19] many know Daniel had gifts in his life
[1:17:20] to interpret dreams and Visions how many
[1:17:22] know he had that the brother B in the
[1:17:25] even says the gifts and callings of God
[1:17:26] are without repentance so he's born as a
[1:17:29] proper child he he can interpret visions
[1:17:31] and dreams and this gift is laying in
[1:17:33] his life all the time and then he's
[1:17:35] trained by his uh his Royal seed line

[1:19:22] and doing what God's wants me to do than
[1:19:24] have a whole lot and be away from the
[1:19:26] kingdom of God I'd rather take my way
[1:19:28] with a bunch of little holy rollers and
[1:19:31] live in the presence of God than to
[1:19:32] belong to the biggest church in Chicago
[1:19:34] or akan and be out of the kingdom of God
[1:19:38] hallelujah So Daniel could have had all
[1:19:41] this food he could had the best food you
[1:19:43] could say like this he could have ate
[1:19:44] from what's the best restaurant around
[1:19:45] here he could have ate from kind of well
[1:19:48] tell me your taste if you shout
[1:19:49] something
[1:19:50] out uh Outback there yeah I like Outback
[1:19:54] too yeah
[1:19:56] you could either out eat from Outback
[1:19:57] every night or you got to eat a strict
[1:20:00] vegetarian
[1:20:01] diet and but see if you eat from out
[1:20:04] back you they' put some whiskey on there
[1:20:06] and they you know they put some whiskey
[1:20:09] in your glass and all these things like
[1:20:10] that and Daniel will say like that turn
[1:20:12] turn down out
[1:20:14] back he turned it down and he said I'll
[1:20:17] just take pulse which is just a
[1:20:19] vegetable diet bean diet lentils but in
[1:20:23] one place brother Bram said peas lentils
[1:20:25] and peas and beans can you imagine that
[1:20:27] that's all you eat that and water for 10
[1:20:29] days but you could have Outback every
[1:20:32] night you could have Chipotle every
[1:20:35] night you could have all these things
[1:20:38] but he turns it down because the word
[1:20:40] said he shouldn't eat certain kinds of
[1:20:42] meats he shouldn't drink certain kinds
[1:20:44] of wine and if the word says it Daniel
[1:20:47] when the purpose in his heart I'm GNA
[1:20:49] stand with the word no matter what they
[1:20:52] try to get me to do I'm GNA stand with
[1:20:54] the word I want to tell you church if
[1:20:55] you can get your heart purpose right now
[1:20:57] it'll last you the rest of your life
[1:21:00] amen because Daniel's uh fast forward 60
[1:21:04] years later and they try to get him to
[1:21:06] stop praying and what he turns it down
[1:21:08] because he said I'm purposed in my heart
[1:21:10] No One's Gonna Keep Me From My Prayer
[1:21:13] amen so we find him at 16 years old and
[1:21:16] 80 years old he's so purposed in his
[1:21:18] heart nobody can get him to compromise
[1:21:21] nobody can defile him why because he's
[1:21:23] in love with God
[1:21:27] Amen brother Bram said i' rather have a
[1:21:29] little bit and be in the kingdom of God
[1:21:32] than have everything and be out of the
[1:21:33] kingdom of
[1:21:37] God what's the matter with me tonight
[1:21:39] anyhow let me tell you my brother what
[1:21:41] we need is a good old old time St Paul's
[1:21:44] Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back in
[1:21:47] the church again they fed him this stuff
[1:21:49] for 10 days little old pot of peas if I
[1:21:54] go to eat I'm telling you right now I'm
[1:21:55] not buying Peas I can get peas at the
[1:21:58] Aldi I can I can get peas at home when I
[1:22:00] go out to eat I want to get something I
[1:22:01] usually don't get like I like nice fish
[1:22:04] dishes or something like that you know
[1:22:06] something nice that we don't maybe get
[1:22:07] all the time or uh something something
[1:22:10] something special well he just says I'll
[1:22:13] take this little pot of lentils and
[1:22:15] peas nothing in it to make you
[1:22:18] fat the first thing you know they
[1:22:20] brought Daniel up and the rest of them
[1:22:22] they looked all the boys over he says
[1:22:25] when they brought old Daniel up my his
[1:22:26] cheeks was
[1:22:28] Rosy he was just as Round And as fat as
[1:22:32] he could
[1:22:33] be oh my Hallelujah he said say I
[1:22:38] believe every time they set that little
[1:22:39] pot of peas down before Daniel that God
[1:22:42] just reached over look at this and got a
[1:22:44] bottle of vitamins and poured the whole
[1:22:47] thing into those
[1:22:49] peas he said
[1:22:51] Hallelujah he said he still got them in
[1:22:53] glory tonight if you'll keep his
[1:22:55] Commandments do his will follow after
[1:22:58] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and seek
[1:23:01] to serve God he said amen I feel good he
[1:23:04] said look brother God just fed Daniel
[1:23:06] with some kind of vitamin but I can see
[1:23:09] him standing there just as Round And as
[1:23:11] fat as he could be I can hear one of
[1:23:13] them say say that guy hasn't had too
[1:23:16] much to eat I just give him a corn pone
[1:23:19] every morning that's all he had but God
[1:23:22] said here I'll bless your bread and
[1:23:24] water
[1:23:25] so maybe it was bread maybe it was a
[1:23:26] vegetable bread diet but the point is it
[1:23:29] was scarce food right it wasn't the it
[1:23:32] wasn't the delicious it wasn't the
[1:23:34] delightful food it was the common food
[1:23:38] uh and he and uh that's all he just say
[1:23:40] with that that's the common food the the
[1:23:42] the pulse and
[1:23:44] water and he says it again I'd rather
[1:23:46] live for God and have bread and water
[1:23:48] then live for the devil and have fried
[1:23:50] chicken and ice cream three times a day
[1:23:52] would you sure yes sir
[1:23:55] Daniel just as fat and as round as he
[1:23:57] could be you know and his cheeks was
[1:23:59] just as rosy he walked up there and said
[1:24:01] yes sir your honor yes sir here I am
[1:24:03] looked him over and said my he's done
[1:24:05] out grow his clothes nearly in 10 days
[1:24:09] eating a a cornpone every morning my how
[1:24:12] God will bless somebody that doesn't
[1:24:14] want to be
[1:24:15] defiled listen brother don't desire the
[1:24:17] big things of this world don't be
[1:24:19] satisfied with what God's give you I'm
[1:24:22] sorry Mercy
[1:24:24] but be satisfied with what God's give
[1:24:27] you forgive me I put a word in there be
[1:24:29] satisfied with what God gives you the
[1:24:31] only thing to be is be sure you're in
[1:24:35] the will of God and the church said can
[1:24:36] you say amen amen so see God somehow put
[1:24:41] Supernatural vitamins inside of that
[1:24:45] pulse now you know today there's
[1:24:47] churches that follow this diet did you
[1:24:48] know that they'll go and research the
[1:24:50] Daniel diet it's oh it's big all over
[1:24:52] the Internet churches will follow some
[1:24:53] people made some big money on that
[1:24:55] because I've seen it on TV uh Church uh
[1:24:59] you know TV
[1:25:01] shows so what they'll do is they they
[1:25:03] sell the food they start they say oh you
[1:25:04] want to be successful like Daniel you
[1:25:06] want to be wise like Daniel eat his diet
[1:25:09] and then they sell you the
[1:25:10] food then they make all this money now I
[1:25:14] believe this too I believe if if you eat
[1:25:15] the right Foods I believe you'll be
[1:25:17] healthier don't
[1:25:20] you but the the motivation behind
[1:25:23] Daniel's diet
[1:25:25] was not to be more fit or more healthy
[1:25:28] or uh or to be more strong physically it
[1:25:31] was to stay pure to God's word now don't
[1:25:34] get me wrong God wants somebody who's
[1:25:35] healthy God wants somebody who's not
[1:25:37] gonna Gorge themselves and uh and eat
[1:25:40] too much and be a sloth and things like
[1:25:42] that and be lazy God don't want that but
[1:25:45] his motivation was not to be defiled by
[1:25:48] something that would break the word of
[1:25:51] God that was his main desire as brother
[1:25:53] Ram said because he loved God here and
[1:25:57] he wanted to be in the will of
[1:26:00] God praise the Lord now remember in
[1:26:03] verse 14 he gives in and say okay we'll
[1:26:06] try this for 10
[1:26:08] days and let's see if you're better
[1:26:11] looking than all the other
[1:26:13] ones and the Bible said in verse 15 did
[1:26:16] we read that yet I don't think so at
[1:26:17] verse
[1:26:19] 15 and at the end of the 10 days their
[1:26:21] countenance appeared fair and fatter in
[1:26:23] flesh than all the children which did
[1:26:25] eat the portion of the king's meat so
[1:26:29] God made them healthier on the regular
[1:26:32] food on the scriptural food we'll say
[1:26:34] like that the scriptural food than the
[1:26:35] King's food right and let me say like
[1:26:38] this God will make you spiritual
[1:26:40] healthier on the King on on the God's
[1:26:42] food the scriptural food more than the
[1:26:44] denominational food are you with me the
[1:26:46] fancy food the worldly food God will
[1:26:49] make make you healthier on the word food
[1:26:51] amen hallelujah you'll be stronger
[1:26:54] spiritually you look more like a rugged
[1:26:56] Christian Soldier just eat on God's food
[1:26:59] just eat the words of life from the
[1:27:01] Bible
[1:27:02] amen verse 16 thus Mel melzar took away
[1:27:06] the portion of their meat and the wine
[1:27:09] that they should drink and gave them
[1:27:12] pulse so see they passed the test that's
[1:27:15] what the Bible says remember God said
[1:27:17] about tithe and offerings he said test
[1:27:19] me God said try me pay your tithes and
[1:27:22] offerings and see if I will
[1:27:24] pour open the floodgates of heaven and
[1:27:27] bless you with blessings you can't even
[1:27:28] count God said try me put me to the test
[1:27:32] right and I'm a witness that that's the
[1:27:34] truth but brother brandom used that
[1:27:35] scripture for other scriptures brother
[1:27:38] Bram said would try me put God to the
[1:27:40] test with Divine Healing put God to the
[1:27:43] test with the desire of your heart put
[1:27:45] God to the test with winning souls put
[1:27:47] God to the test with any promise of God
[1:27:49] and see if God don't back up his word
[1:27:52] amen take him to take him out his word
[1:27:54] if the word says it believe it that's
[1:27:57] what faith in God's word does it grabs a
[1:27:59] hold of the word and it won't let go to
[1:28:01] God's word
[1:28:03] amen so see Daniel put God's word to the
[1:28:06] test and God's word won God's word was
[1:28:11] Victorious because he put God's word
[1:28:15] first amen look at verse 17 and as for
[1:28:19] these four children what did God
[1:28:21] do because they kept the Commandments
[1:28:24] God gave them knowledge and skill in all
[1:28:27] learning and
[1:28:29] wisdom and Daniel had understanding in
[1:28:32] all visions and dreams that's a mighty
[1:28:36] gift of God right there now look how
[1:28:39] many how many believe Daniel was an
[1:28:40] important person in the Bible how many
[1:28:41] believe that he was was a very extremely
[1:28:44] important person because of the prophecy
[1:28:46] especially surrounding Israel from the
[1:28:48] from the time he passed away to the time
[1:28:50] of Christ and even up to today his
[1:28:53] prophecy are we're still looking at them
[1:28:55] we're still understanding them we're
[1:28:57] still waiting upon God to bring
[1:28:58] something to pass he's an extremely
[1:29:00] important person so what did God uh how
[1:29:04] did God prepare Daniel God had him live
[1:29:06] a consecrated
[1:29:07] life you see if we want to be used like
[1:29:10] Daniel we gotta live a consecrated life
[1:29:12] like Daniel praise God how many believe
[1:29:15] they got gifts in their life how many
[1:29:16] believe that from God if You' got a gift
[1:29:18] of God in your life you got to be like
[1:29:19] Daniel you got a purpose in your heart
[1:29:22] I'm not going to let anything from the
[1:29:23] world
[1:29:24] Make Me Filthy in God's sight I'm just
[1:29:26] going to keep God's word that's my
[1:29:28] purpose and I'll request uh with
[1:29:31] everyone I meet I request that they'll
[1:29:34] help me and allow me to keep God's
[1:29:37] word
[1:29:39] amen I'm GNA sh I'm gonna share brother
[1:29:41] Adam's testimony with his job brother
[1:29:43] Adam got a te a job here in akan and he
[1:29:46] had told them no working on Sunday
[1:29:48] because of
[1:29:49] church right and they made him work on
[1:29:52] Sunday so he quit the the
[1:29:55] job and I was so blessed I'm like praise
[1:29:58] the Lord amen that's
[1:30:00] beautiful and then a few weeks later God
[1:30:02] gave him the job that he has now he
[1:30:03] never has to work a Saturday or Sunday
[1:30:05] is that
[1:30:06] right praise to me that's a modern-day
[1:30:08] Daniel right there can you say praise
[1:30:11] the Lord put put God to the test praise
[1:30:15] the Lord put take God at his word
[1:30:18] amen if God's word says it you believe
[1:30:21] it that settles it amen I think that's a
[1:30:24] just I thought that was a beautiful
[1:30:26] example of real Christian faith don't
[1:30:29] you always put God's words first
[1:30:36] amen because you got to go about it
[1:30:38] humbly look you got to go about it
[1:30:39] humbly we're not in today Old Testament
[1:30:40] where you can beat somebody up and you
[1:30:42] know hey I'm just like
[1:30:45] Samson those days are past Church aren
[1:30:48] the days of
[1:30:49] today today is a day of love where love
[1:30:53] conquers everything praise God Divine
[1:30:56] love love suffereth long love will never
[1:30:59] fail remember Paul said all those things
[1:31:02] today is the day of the Holy Spirit love
[1:31:04] conquering not violence Jesus said if
[1:31:06] you take the sword or if you take a a
[1:31:08] shotgun you'll die with a shotgun can I
[1:31:10] say it like that you fight with a
[1:31:12] shotgun you're gonna die with a shotgun
[1:31:14] whenever you take the battle that's what
[1:31:16] you're gonna you're gon that's what's
[1:31:17] gonna happen to you and I'll say like
[1:31:18] this I'll take the word to fight with
[1:31:20] amen and let the word fight for me
[1:31:22] hallelujah amen you
[1:31:25] see we should let God do our fighting
[1:31:28] for us let God fight our battles and not
[1:31:32] ourselves and so how do you approach it
[1:31:34] like Daniel Daniel said Daniel just gave
[1:31:36] a request Lord could I ple or Sorry boss
[1:31:39] could I please have this and God
[1:31:41] answered his God answered his
[1:31:43] prayer
[1:31:45] amen and then because of that in verse
[1:31:48] 17 God gave them knowledge which is
[1:31:51] remember understanding they understood
[1:31:54] and skill which are abilities actions so
[1:31:59] understanding and
[1:32:00] skills in all learning and wisdom so
[1:32:04] whatever they learned they had good
[1:32:07] understanding of it can you imagine that
[1:32:09] you imagine picking up a book you could
[1:32:10] read it and then you could do it you
[1:32:12] imagine that my imagine like building
[1:32:16] like a building like this can you
[1:32:17] imagine building a a house or something
[1:32:19] like that and doing all the work
[1:32:21] yourself this is Daniel and these they
[1:32:24] such a gift and a blessing from God they
[1:32:26] live so consecrated that whatever they
[1:32:28] learned God blessed
[1:32:31] them God gave them knowledge and skill
[1:32:34] and all learning all so astrology
[1:32:38] biology right
[1:32:41] ecology philosophy you start naming all
[1:32:44] these ologies and uh he whatever they
[1:32:48] learned God bless them that's what I
[1:32:50] want my life to be amen I want to not
[1:32:52] don't want to be defiled by the things
[1:32:53] of the world I want to live consecrated
[1:32:55] unto Christ
[1:32:58] amen and then Lord bless me let my gifts
[1:33:01] be blessed expand my understanding in
[1:33:04] all my gifts his gifts were visions and
[1:33:06] dreams so God expand my gifts in my life
[1:33:10] let them be used for your glory
[1:33:12] amen now look at Verse
[1:33:15] 18 now at the end of the days of that
[1:33:18] that the king had said he should bring
[1:33:20] them in then the prince of the Unix
[1:33:22] brought them in before neb

[1:33:39] king wow what a beautiful beautiful
[1:33:42] quote
[1:33:43] there verse 20 and in all maners look
[1:33:46] again all you imagine every problem they
[1:33:49] brought to these guys every every test
[1:33:53] every course we'd say they mastered
[1:33:56] everything my goodness what a gift of
[1:33:59] God that was God's gift and yet God's
[1:34:01] got a Revival with two million Jews back
[1:34:04] there over with Nehemiah and Ezra
[1:34:06] and yeah zubal God's got a revival going

[1:34:12] place amen God has not left himself
[1:34:14] without a witness he's got witnesses in
[1:34:16] Aran tonight amen hallelujah though a
[1:34:19] 100,000 people won't serve him and fully

[1:34:26] I'm one of them Hallelujah you should be
[1:34:29] one of them as well live undefiled
[1:34:32] Hallelujah let God give you complete
[1:34:35] blessings in all matters look at verse
[1:34:37] 20 all matters of wisdom understanding
[1:34:40] that the king inquired of them he found
[1:34:43] them 10 times better than all the
[1:34:46] magicians and
[1:34:47] astrologers that were all I'm sorry that
[1:34:50] were in all his
[1:34:52] realm these are some gifted men here and
[1:34:55] Daniel continued even on the first year
[1:34:57] of King Cyrus I'm going to close a
[1:34:59] little bit because I've been preaching
[1:35:00] about an hour here I'm gonna close in
[1:35:02] just a little bit by God's
[1:35:08] grace but I just want to make sure I
[1:35:10] emphasize that
[1:35:11] again they were 10 times
[1:35:15] better than everyone else and M he was
[1:35:17] 16 years old imagine he was competing
[1:35:20] against 20 year olds you know 30 year
[1:35:22] olds uh later on there's susers there's
[1:35:26] uh All The Magicians and everything like
[1:35:29] that and he has made the master of all
[1:35:31] the musici or magicians actually not
[1:35:34] musicians
[1:35:36] magicians he's made the master of all
[1:35:38] the magicians those who have studied the
[1:35:40] uh the Arts I would say like that the
[1:35:43] Arts he's made the top of all them he's
[1:35:47] quite a
[1:35:48] man but what did he try to do he tried
[1:35:50] to live a consecrated walk with the Lord
[1:35:55] amen now I want to read this quote here
[1:35:57] it's going to be kind of small so I
[1:35:58] don't expect you to read it here I found
[1:36:00] it earlier today and I was really
[1:36:01] blessed here's a quote I just read but
[1:36:03] I'm skipping down to this part right
[1:36:06] here can I make that larger no
[1:36:10] sorry now sorry yeah that's so tiny yeah
[1:36:13] you don't have to look at that Daniel
[1:36:15] purpose in his heart brother said that
[1:36:17] he wouldn't defile himself with the
[1:36:19] world he was going to keep the tradition
[1:36:21] that God laid down the Commandments of
[1:36:25] God so he just said you know if God laid
[1:36:28] it if God wrote it in the Bible I'm
[1:36:29] Gonna Keep
[1:36:30] it yeah that's that's all I did he
[1:36:33] purposed in his heart I'm directing my
[1:36:36] heart this is my purpose on life is to
[1:36:38] say pure from the defilement of the
[1:36:41] world
[1:36:43] Amen like for example I was given a I've
[1:36:45] got two gift cards for $50 to go down to
[1:36:47] Regal Cinemas right down there and buy
[1:36:49] movie tickets well guess what I'm not
[1:36:51] letting those defile me
[1:36:54] one of these days I'm going to walk in
[1:36:55] there buy some popcorn and walk out with
[1:36:56] those gift
[1:36:58] cards uh or if they ever get a Christian
[1:37:01] movie in there you would probably never
[1:37:04] but every now and then the Christian
[1:37:06] guys will put out a documentary they
[1:37:07] might have it there but I'm not even
[1:37:08] looking at this
[1:37:09] point I'm given I'm given $50 of
[1:37:13] Temptation right it's just like Daniel
[1:37:16] the King's food is laid right there well
[1:37:18] why don't you go see
[1:37:20] Batman I used to like Rocky why don't
[1:37:22] you go see Rocky babo a new movie I used
[1:37:23] to love those movies when I was a sinner
[1:37:26] but you know what I won't be defiled
[1:37:27] with the king's meat amen they just sit
[1:37:30] there so I can use them I'm use them I
[1:37:32] want to use them with wisdom might go on
[1:37:34] Craigslist and sell them for $45 or
[1:37:37] something like that but you see so see a
[1:37:40] real Christian can have sin presented
[1:37:42] right before him and they'll turn it
[1:37:43] down
[1:37:44] amen I'm not wasting those money those
[1:37:47] families I'm going to use it with wisdom
[1:37:49] I'm not going to be defiled by a free
[1:37:52] pass for sin
[1:37:54] I'm going to live righteously before the
[1:37:55] Lord Jesus
[1:37:56] Christ when all my family leaves the
[1:37:59] other night a few Monday nights ago all
[1:38:00] my family left and I was home by myself
[1:38:02] for three hours guess what I did studied
[1:38:04] and prayed for three
[1:38:05] hours I didn't go on the you you or I
[1:38:08] didn't go on YouTube and watch the
[1:38:09] basketball
[1:38:11] game I didn't try to go over and watch a
[1:38:13] dirty movie for three hours I'm all by
[1:38:16] myself what do I do pray read the word
[1:38:19] of God worship listen to music why
[1:38:21] because I won't be defiled with the
[1:38:22] king's me amen because there's one thing
[1:38:25] I love that's Jesus Christ amen this
[1:38:28] body of course yes is tempted daily by
[1:38:30] everything but I understand that this
[1:38:33] guy is always GNA be fighting against me
[1:38:34] this guy's Never Satisfied you give him
[1:38:36] a little break he gets lazy on God you
[1:38:39] got to keep him in subjection to the
[1:38:41] word of God so we find ourselves when
[1:38:44] we're tempted and sin is laid right
[1:38:45] before us we must turn it down let me
[1:38:48] tell you brother Austin it gets easier
[1:38:49] all the time as you become a Christian
[1:38:51] how many can say Amen to that at first
[1:38:54] it was hard to turn down the cigarettes
[1:38:55] and the chew and now it's no problem at
[1:38:57] all at first it was hard not to go see
[1:39:00] Rocky five and six and seven but now
[1:39:03] it's not hard anymore because I'm
[1:39:05] stronger greater is he that's in you
[1:39:07] than he that's in the world the Christ
[1:39:10] in me is greater than the part of me
[1:39:12] that still lives in this world with
[1:39:13] these five senses my six sense is
[1:39:16] greater than My Five Senses amen
[1:39:18] hallelujah when the five senses want to
[1:39:20] go out and do something wrong or or get
[1:39:22] lazy on God the six sense says I'm
[1:39:25] stronger you listen to me you purpose in
[1:39:27] your heart to be a real servant of God
[1:39:29] God help each one of us to be a real
[1:39:31] servant of God tonight amen purpose in
[1:39:33] your heart so I've got a purpose not to
[1:39:36] be defiled with
[1:39:37] sin as we said on Sunday for sisters you
[1:39:40] have to purpose yourself not even to cut
[1:39:42] your split ends and how did I know that
[1:39:44] was a good discernment for some some
[1:39:46] some in the church I appreciate them let
[1:39:47] me know with their testimonies that was
[1:39:49] really
[1:39:50] wonderful and uh so see everybody gets
[1:39:52] tempted don't they we all get tempted we
[1:39:55] all go through hard times and tested and
[1:39:57] tempted and all these things like that
[1:39:59] but see the Holy Spirit knows exactly
[1:40:00] how to bring his word to you
[1:40:03] amen exactly right I showed you on
[1:40:05] Sunday night that the hair represents
[1:40:07] the Holy Spirit praise God Isaiah 30
[1:40:12] verse one hair on a woman represents the
[1:40:15] holy spirit so when you cut off the hair
[1:40:17] represents the spirit's influence in
[1:40:18] your life you lose part of his
[1:40:21] influence praise God that's what it
[1:40:23] means brother Bram said it represents
[1:40:25] the leadership of the holy spirit so
[1:40:27] when you cut that off you're no longer
[1:40:29] led by the Holy Spirit you're saying I
[1:40:31] don't need your leadership I don't need
[1:40:32] this
[1:40:33] word my what a what a what a what an
[1:40:37] awful thing to
[1:40:39] do and brothers we get tempted like what
[1:40:41] it said with movies dirty jokes Evil
[1:40:44] songs business deals that might be off
[1:40:46] the word of God lustful thoughts right
[1:40:50] maybe thoughts of anger thoughts of
[1:40:52] Revenge thoughts of hatred right all
[1:40:55] these things thoughts of gossip and all
[1:40:56] these things like that and no matter
[1:40:58] what we're tempted with we can all be
[1:40:59] Overcomers we're all more than
[1:41:01] conquerors in Christ Jesus there is no
[1:41:03] excuse for sin right because in every
[1:41:06] trial God Will Make A Way of Escape amen
[1:41:08] there's always a way out praise
[1:41:10] God I was talking about awes there's
[1:41:12] certain sins I did before I got married
[1:41:15] and I just thought there was no way I
[1:41:16] could overcome
[1:41:17] them but as I started serving God and
[1:41:20] started realizing I found that if I
[1:41:23] would just hold out God would make a way
[1:41:25] out out of every Temptation for me if I
[1:41:27] would just hold out and just don't do
[1:41:29] that sin for a little longer just wait a
[1:41:31] little longer hold out on that sin God
[1:41:33] always made a way out amen Glory
[1:41:37] Hallelujah and then as you get Victory
[1:41:39] it becomes addictive praise God it
[1:41:43] becomes a uh it becomes your battlecry
[1:41:47] it just becomes your routine you're a
[1:41:49] Victor and so when Temptation comes
[1:41:51] before you you just conquer you just
[1:41:52] conqu conquer you just cast it down you
[1:41:54] just cast it down you tell Satan to get
[1:41:56] behind you you become more of a
[1:41:58] conqueror it's just like an army you get
[1:42:00] a victory you get on a roll it's hard to
[1:42:02] stop an army that's on a roll amen same
[1:42:05] thing in in life you get on a roll and
[1:42:07] you become a Victor praise God that
[1:42:10] becomes who you
[1:42:12] are let me read this last one
[1:42:17] here this is from Investments
[1:42:20] 1964 so see you might not have read this
[1:42:22] in the Bible but Daniel was making
[1:42:25] Investments to be to have eternal
[1:42:27] life when he would choose to eat pulse
[1:42:31] the the the veeg vegetarian when he was
[1:42:34] doing that he was actually investing in
[1:42:36] eternal life to be
[1:42:38] saved because he was keeping God's
[1:42:41] Commandments the Bible didn't say that
[1:42:43] itself but brother Ram says when you
[1:42:45] obey God's word it's making investment
[1:42:47] in eternal
[1:42:48] life hallelujah
[1:42:51] amen he said d purpose in his heart that
[1:42:54] he wasn't going to defile his
[1:42:59] investment Glory he purpose no matter
[1:43:02] what the world how rich the king gets
[1:43:06] and how much he tries to get me off in
[1:43:07] the things of the world I'm not going to
[1:43:10] do it I'm not going to defile my
[1:43:15] investment look at that church let me
[1:43:17] give you an example like the van we
[1:43:18] bought we almost got it paid off we
[1:43:20] bought that that's an investment right
[1:43:24] so what do you do with the investment
[1:43:25] you take care of it I'm not going to
[1:43:28] defile my investment I'm not going to
[1:43:29] take my van for a spin in the field to
[1:43:31] get it all mudded up like a lot of
[1:43:34] teenage boys do I'll say like that some
[1:43:36] teenage boys that are 30 and 40 too
[1:43:41] unfortunately I'm not going to try to
[1:43:43] squeeze it and park it in a spot where
[1:43:45] there's cars really close by that you
[1:43:47] know somebody's going to ding your your
[1:43:48] van when you get
[1:43:51] out I'm not going to go the whole winter
[1:43:53] without giving it a wash because the
[1:43:55] salt will eat away at the car and
[1:43:58] produce it to make it rust why because
[1:44:01] it's an investment I want it to last a
[1:44:04] long time and what do we want to last
[1:44:06] more longer than eternal life amen our
[1:44:09] walk with god what do we want what's
[1:44:11] more valuable or what's what greater
[1:44:13] investment do we have than our walk with
[1:44:15] Jesus Christ if I'll protect my car and
[1:44:17] I'll take it to get oil change every
[1:44:19] 5,000 miles not three this one's five
[1:44:21] which is nice I'm not defiling
[1:44:24] it they're free for the first 100,000
[1:44:27] miles too which is a blessing but you
[1:44:29] see I'm not going to defile on can you
[1:44:31] imagine me skipping a few oil changes
[1:44:33] brother Adam and then wondering why is
[1:44:35] this van doing so bad it's been 15,000
[1:44:38] miles since I got a oil change and oils
[1:44:41] and burning oils coming out the back and
[1:44:43] and the lights are on I'm just ignoring
[1:44:44] it like well I got to get to church I'll
[1:44:47] take care of it later that would show I
[1:44:49] have a really bad attitude towards my
[1:44:51] investment that I made
[1:44:54] that would show that I really don't
[1:44:55] value what I put into this van I don't
[1:44:58] value that monthly payment that I have
[1:45:00] to do I don't really value that I don't
[1:45:03] want this van to last forever but see
[1:45:05] our walk with God we want it to last
[1:45:07] forever amen that's why we value that's
[1:45:10] why we come get a oil change every
[1:45:12] Sunday night Sunday and Wednesday night
[1:45:15] Hallelujah I say oil change how oil fill
[1:45:18] up amen can I say like that your human
[1:45:21] spirit is what needs filled up not your
[1:45:23] Soul if you're born again your Soul's
[1:45:24] already sealed until the day of your
[1:45:26] Redemption but you need an oil change I
[1:45:29] need oil change in my
[1:45:32] mind because my mind gets some carbon in
[1:45:34] it my mind gets some uh defiling in it
[1:45:38] and it needs clean out praise God it
[1:45:41] gets tired my mind gets tired so when we
[1:45:42] come to church and we worship God we C
[1:45:45] we get all that wash all the trash and
[1:45:46] all the junk and the all the bad parts
[1:45:49] we get all that taken out and we get an
[1:45:52] oil change
[1:45:54] Hallelujah because that's our investment
[1:45:57] amen we're investing in eternal life
[1:46:00] tonight I know we're little number I
[1:46:03] know I can hardly sing I know that I

[1:46:12] lives some of you got saved under my
[1:46:13] Ministry and you've seen it work in the
[1:46:15] Ministries you got saved under is that
[1:46:17] right this word brings eternal life
[1:46:21] amen it's wor worth investing in
[1:46:23] hallelujah amen so that means you put
[1:46:26] your heart into it you put your time
[1:46:28] your resources your money uh your
[1:46:30] thoughts you put everything into God

[1:46:38] my
[1:46:41] investment oh Christian world don't
[1:46:43] defile yourself don't defile your
[1:46:46] investment that you've made in eternal
[1:46:49] life you'll pollute it

[1:46:56] dirty things saying dirty things any sin
[1:46:59] you can read in the Bible it will defile
[1:47:02] your Christian experience and we don't
[1:47:04] want to be polluted we want to be pure
[1:47:06] amen we're investing tonight in the
[1:47:10] greatest investment there could ever be
[1:47:12] made your 401k brother or sister my grow
[1:47:16] my that might be a great investment but
[1:47:17] the stock market May crash and you might
[1:47:19] lose some of that your investment will
[1:47:20] be polluted but I promise you there'll
[1:47:23] be no stock crashing of God's eternal
[1:47:25] life in heaven Hallelujah there'll be no
[1:47:28] crash of that it only grows
[1:47:30] exponentially with dividends and rewards
[1:47:33] amen hallelujah it always doubles amen
[1:47:36] remember five tals turns a 10 three
[1:47:38] turns a six one turns a two it'll always
[1:47:41] double what a percentage of investment
[1:47:43] that is amen it's guaranteed to double
[1:47:46] if you'll invest in it hallelujah
[1:47:50] amen Daniel purposed
[1:47:53] that he wouldn't do it I'm not going to
[1:47:55] be like the rest of the
[1:47:57] Babylonians I'm not going to be like the
[1:47:59] rest of the
[1:48:01] leans praise God like when they all
[1:48:03] dressed up for Halloween last Halloween

[1:48:34] friend anymore and now I'm isolated a
[1:48:37] lot I only got a few Christian friends

[1:49:44] can't yeah I can't for this for some
[1:49:47] reason I can't expand this one Daniel

[1:50:47] I thank you for
[1:50:48] tonight Lord we're looking at a purposed
[1:50:51] heart we're looking at Daniel's
[1:50:53] investment that he made at 16 young
[1:50:56] years old Lord God I remember being 16
[1:50:59] now at 16 years old he said I'm purpose
[1:51:03] I have a direction I'm a young man and I
[1:51:05] think of brother Austin at 20 probably
[1:51:08] the youngest one here closest to that
[1:51:09] Lydia's 12 she's four years away they're
[1:51:12] both four years from
[1:51:14] it and there Daniel's at 16 and he
[1:51:17] stands up to we'd say like a Donald
[1:51:19] Trump Administration he stands up to the
[1:51:22] greatest
[1:51:24] government this government on the face
[1:51:26] of the entire Earth he stands up and
[1:51:28] requests can I please try something else
[1:51:30] I don't want to break God's
[1:51:35] word Lord and then the Bible said Lord
[1:51:37] that you blessed
[1:51:39] him you gave him all learning all
[1:51:42] knowledge all understanding and all
[1:51:44] dreams he was 10 times better than
[1:51:46] everybody else father we're not
[1:51:49] guaranteed to be 10 times better than
[1:51:52] Maybe the other worker on our job or the
[1:51:54] other person in our class or something
[1:51:56] but Lord we want to be this we want to
[1:51:59] be
[1:52:00] undefiled and we want others to look at
[1:52:03] us and say my there's a True Believer in
[1:52:06] the Commandments of
[1:52:07] God they have sin laying right in front
[1:52:10] of them but instead of indulging in it
[1:52:14] their purpose to live pure before
[1:52:19] God because Lord one day we know it
[1:52:22] might hurt now to sacrifice right now
[1:52:24] but one day we know this investment will
[1:52:27] really pay off in great
[1:52:31] dividends when we need you the most when
[1:52:34] Daniel needed you the most you came on
[1:52:37] the scene Lord Jesus and so Lord I thank
[1:52:40] you for that tonight because I know Lord
[1:52:42] you're not a respector of persons if you
[1:52:44] were there for Daniel you were there for
[1:52:46] Gideon you were there for the three
[1:52:47] Hebrew children when they needed you the
[1:52:49] most Ezekiel Jeremiah Lord all these men
[1:52:52] we can name St Paul Shipwrecked three
[1:52:55] times beat five times with 39 lashes I
[1:52:59] believe or three times and you were
[1:53:00] there for him every time he was in death
[1:53:03] often and you often delivered him
[1:53:05] because Lord his heart was purposed to
[1:53:09] serve you he didn't defile himself with
[1:53:12] the blaspheming Jews Lord
[1:53:15] God and Lord tonight I pray for each
[1:53:17] person here each person live streaming
[1:53:20] Lord may they purpose in their heart
[1:53:23] tonight that they'll not be defiled at
[1:53:26] work or in the home or at
[1:53:28] school but they can just live a
[1:53:31] consecrated holy life to you because
[1:53:34] they love
[1:53:35] you Lord you know in my heart I I
[1:53:37] remember being home that night for three
[1:53:39] hours I remember run up the stairs
[1:53:41] hurrying so I could eat a little bit and
[1:53:43] Rush down to study because I just value
[1:53:45] that time that quiet time I just love
[1:53:48] that time with you so much Lord to read
[1:53:51] your word Lord Lord God and to to lay it
