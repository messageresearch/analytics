[37:02] bless you let's take our Bibles here
[37:04] today by the grace of God we just as we
[37:06] said just have one service today I jok
[37:08] with my family I said I'll just preach
[37:09] two and a half hours okay that's all by
[37:12] God's grace Ephesians chapter 3 by God's
[37:14] grace Ephesians chapter
[37:22] 3 Ephesians 3:14 by the grace of the
[37:25] Lord
[37:35] I was mentioning uh I think it was last
[37:37] week I like to preach on the family so
[37:39] you know I'll just preach on that today
[37:40] I was trying to study yesterday I just
[37:43] couldn't get any you know thoughts going
[37:44] and then the thoughts came to me about
[37:46] the family I wanted to preach on the
[37:47] family so I'm going to preach on the
[37:48] family I'm just going to preach on the
[37:50] Christian family this morning by God's
[37:51] grace the Christian
[37:55] family
[37:59] Hallelujah there's uh 75 times the word
[38:02] family is used in the Old Testament it's
[38:04] used one time in the New Testament
[38:07] praise God and this is the one time it's
[38:09] used hallelujah what a comfort Church to
[38:11] know that you know some people say well
[38:14] once I get to heaven then I'll be part
[38:15] of the family of God well according to
[38:17] the Bible you're already a part of the
[38:18] family of God hallelujah thank god let's
[38:22] read this together we'll read uh 14 and
[38:24] 15 by God's grace we can read that
[38:26] together Ephesians 3:14 and 15 let's
[38:29] read that on three 1 2 3 for this cause
[38:32] I bow my knees unto the father of our
[38:36] Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[38:39] family and Heaven and Earth is named now
[38:43] I think I'm just going to read after
[38:44] that a little bit here that he would
[38:46] Grant you according to the riches of his
[38:48] glory to be strengthened with might by
[38:51] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[38:54] May dwell in your hearts by faith that
[38:56] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[38:58] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[39:01] what is the breadth the length the depth
[39:02] the height and to know the love of
[39:04] Christ which passeth knowledge that you
[39:07] might be filled with all the fullness of
[39:10] God and of course we could just keep
[39:11] reading that whole entire book there by
[39:13] God's grace but may God add his Blessing
[39:15] to bring of his word you may be seated
[39:16] praise
[39:19] God so we want to start just with that
[39:22] scripture how Paul said we should bow
[39:23] our knees to the God and father of our
[39:25] Lord Jesus Christ and so here in the
[39:27] scripture he's establishing headship and
[39:29] that's what God has done uh through
[39:32] Christ we know we know God is the
[39:34] invisible Spirit no man has ever seen
[39:36] God no man will ever ever see God
[39:39] hallelujah but God chose to be seen in
[39:42] his son the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[39:45] so we have the headship there and uh of
[39:47] course God is above all and then the
[39:49] Lord Jesus Christ and the other
[39:51] scriptures tell us uh the husband or the
[39:54] man is above the woman Hallelujah for
[39:56] God's order Hallelujah his
[39:59] responsibility glory and so I love the
[40:01] prayer Paul says what was his prayer for
[40:03] the whole family it was that you and I
[40:05] would be strengthened by the spirit
[40:07] Hallelujah in the Inner Man so I trust
[40:10] that's what the Lord will do today here
[40:11] as we uh Minister I trust that the word
[40:13] of God will strengthen you
[40:15] today
[40:17] Hallelujah I listened to a couple
[40:19] sermons on a family yesterday and I got
[40:20] to listen to most of brother Dennis's
[40:22] Ser brother Dennis MCB preach at cams
[40:24] last night it was a surprise to me it
[40:25] just come up on my YouTube YouTube feed
[40:26] I'm like Glory so I kind of listen to
[40:28] that while I was doing chores and uh had
[40:31] a good really enjoyed brother Dennis's
[40:33] thought he was preaching on Focus I
[40:34] thought that's a good thought uh we got
[40:36] to keep our focus on the Lord Jesus
[40:38] Christ Hallelujah now I want to start of
[40:40] course with lots of scripture so have
[40:42] your Bible handy if you could here we're
[40:44] going to be reading some scripture I
[40:45] just thought it'd be good to go over
[40:46] some of these scriptures about family
[40:49] and uh I want to start in Genesis 1819
[40:53] we'll start there we'll kind of work our
[40:55] way down through uh uh the Bible here by
[40:58] God's grace and I preached on family you
[41:00] know many years ago it's been many years
[41:02] uh maybe eight years since I preached on
[41:04] the family here at the church according
[41:06] to my records I just preached on it in
[41:07] last time in 2016 so it's been eight
[41:09] years since I've really preached in-
[41:11] depth about the family uh so like I said
[41:14] I like to write a book about the family
[41:16] uh but I found out it really takes God's
[41:18] anointing to write a book Hallelujah I
[41:20] realized wow to write two of them it was
[41:22] just God's anointing right and then to
[41:23] do the third I'm like I really need
[41:25] God's anointing
[41:26] Hallelujah just not done very
[41:28] easily but you know I've always thought
[41:30] this you know if if if we're going to a
[41:33] meeting in the air of a Godly wedding
[41:35] right we're we're going to a spiritual
[41:37] wedding well then uh well then our lives
[41:40] on Earth should match that the nature of
[41:42] that wedding Hallelujah in other words
[41:43] if we want to be in the spiritual
[41:45] wedding let's make make sure our
[41:46] marriages and our our families are in
[41:48] the right condition right now Hallelujah
[41:50] right if we want to be a part of that
[41:52] Heavenly wedding let's have heaven on
[41:53] Earth right now Glory Hallelujah now we
[41:56] know of course Satan's greatest battle
[41:58] is against the family we see that in
[41:59] Genesis chapter 3 we're not going to
[42:01] read that but we're very vers very well
[42:03] versed in it Satan always attacks God's
[42:07] word right that was his main attack his
[42:09] attack was against God well God's word
[42:11] doesn't mean this and he's discrediting
[42:13] God's word all the time and of course
[42:15] today Satan will dis discredit God's
[42:17] children you know God's uh ministers and
[42:20] God's family but is Satan's main attack
[42:22] is on the word of God he's trying to get
[42:25] us to doubt the word of God and if he
[42:27] can do that then he can get our eyes off
[42:30] the word of God and get us focus on sin
[42:33] and that will bring death the Bible says
[42:35] sin when it matures brings death but
[42:38] Jesus said I come that you might have
[42:39] life and have it more abundantly
[42:41] hallelujah amen so Jesus gives us the
[42:43] power the strength to keep our eyes on
[42:45] the word of God uh despite Satan's
[42:48] attack his main attack is on the home
[42:50] and the family right because we can all
[42:53] come to church we can smile Shake our
[42:54] hands I can hug our Brothers on the neck
[42:57] and we can shake our hands you our
[42:58] sisters and everything seems fine and
[43:00] good here right we can we can hide maybe
[43:02] some things that might be going on in
[43:04] our lives but when we go home we spend
[43:06] the most of our time there right and
[43:08] we're thankful for a holy church we want
[43:09] to have holy Gatherings we don't want
[43:11] any sin here in the church but we
[43:14] understand we spend the most time at
[43:15] home and so of course that's where s
[43:17] Satan will attack us the most there and
[43:19] so we're going to need fortified we're
[43:20] going to need strengthened we're going
[43:22] to need uh Weaponry right we're going to
[43:24] need defensive armor Hallelujah
[43:27] especially when we're in the home if if
[43:29] any place we need the word of God it's
[43:30] in our home Hallelujah Glory because
[43:33] that's where Satan attacks and so we got
[43:35] to have we got to have our armor on
[43:37] remember the Bible tells us in Ephesians
[43:38] 6 we've got to put the armor on every
[43:40] single day don't let a day go by where
[43:43] you don't put God's armor on Hallelujah
[43:46] right put it on in your home put it on
[43:48] uh in the church you you keep God's
[43:50] armor on at all times and then you'll be
[43:53] able to defend yourself against the
[43:55] attacks of the enemy Hallelujah now I
[43:58] wanted to start in Genesis 18:19 as I
[44:02] said thank you hun um the Bible said I
[44:06] love this God God is saying you know he
[44:08] visited Abraham he said for I know him
[44:10] aren't you glad God knows you I love
[44:12] that God knows you because you were
[44:15] predestinated in his mind before the
[44:17] foundation of the world and then we
[44:19] looked at the potter the Potter he
[44:21] already had this plan he's already going
[44:22] to mold you he's already made you a
[44:24] vessel of Honor Hallelujah he knows you
[44:27] amen he gave you he gave you your your
[44:30] life he gave you your your position he
[44:33] gave you your location he's giving you
[44:35] every detail every hair on your head or
[44:38] brothers if you don't got them he took
[44:39] them away too Hallelujah but he he knows
[44:43] every detail Hallelujah he's placed you
[44:45] where exactly where he wants you
[44:46] Hallelujah and he wants you to be a
[44:48] vessel of Honor by love this God says I
[44:51] know Abraham now look he knew lot
[44:53] wouldn't do all these things right right
[44:56] so there's always a difference that's
[44:58] why I love the message God gave to
[44:59] brother brandham because brother Bram
[45:01] majored on wise and foolish version and
[45:03] now we can see this principle All
[45:05] Through the Bible amen the Bible becomes
[45:07] a new Bible Hallelujah you see in a new
[45:09] light you don't see it by Creeds or well
[45:12] well this this you know you don't see it
[45:14] through a well my founder said this and
[45:16] Luther said this and Wesley said that or
[45:18] or Jonathan Edwards said that or
[45:19] Jonathan Gil said that they can all
[45:21] contribute right but we see it through
[45:23] the mind of Christ as the Bible said we
[45:26] have the mind of Christ amen so we can
[45:29] see this God knows the father of the
[45:31] faith Abraham I know him he'll command
[45:34] his children and his household after him
[45:36] that they shall keep the way of the Lord
[45:40] hallelujah so Abraham wasn't going to
[45:42] give his children the wrong commands
[45:43] he's going to command them to obey the
[45:45] word of God right this is our this is
[45:48] our father of the faith how many you
[45:50] understand that he's our example the
[45:53] father must give commands right
[45:56] and he does that by God's grace and
[45:58] they're commanded to keep God's word I
[46:00] love this to do justice and judgment and
[46:04] it means to make the right decision in a
[46:06] case right so parents are like judges
[46:09] right they've got to judge they've got
[46:11] to investigate before they make a
[46:13] judgment Hallelujah and this is what
[46:16] Abraham God knew he would do God knew he
[46:18] would give commands and then they would
[46:20] give the right judgment here's the right
[46:21] way to do it here's the right thing we
[46:23] should do and we're going forward with
[46:25] this judgment Hallelujah I'm doing
[46:28] Justice this is the in other words this
[46:30] is the right thing to do Hallelujah my
[46:32] children must do this I must do this he
[46:35] gave the commands in other words he was
[46:36] a man of order Hallelujah he had his
[46:39] house in order remember church he had
[46:40] 300 servants and he took those 300
[46:43] servants and whipped a real army right
[46:46] that that took Sodom and Gomorrah now
[46:48] that's what I call a real man
[46:50] Hallelujah he didn't have all the he
[46:53] didn't have all the we say the military
[46:55] gear of that day or whatever uh he
[46:57] didn't have all the backing of all these
[46:58] nations alls he had was the backing of
[47:01] God Amen but that's all he needed
[47:03] hallelujah amen and this is the kind of
[47:05] man he was he gave his children commands
[47:08] to keep the word just keep the word and
[47:11] we will do justice and judgment in our
[47:13] home and then when God calls us to fight
[47:16] battles we'll fight the battles
[47:19] Hallelujah you know and when they get to
[47:20] be teenagers then they start fighting
[47:22] some real battles right because they get
[47:24] influenced by friends
[47:26] right like we're seeing at all these
[47:27] youth events now there are great youth
[47:28] events but we can see the battles
[47:31] raging
[47:33] Hallelujah right and there's times for
[47:35] battle Hallelujah and they got to be
[47:36] prepared for battle by the grace of
[47:39] God so this is this household his
[47:42] household was commanded to keep God's
[47:44] word and I thought about this too you
[47:46] know uh Joshua said as for me in my
[47:49] house we will serve the
[47:52] Lord now we get this idea your house is
[47:55] a business because it serves God didn't
[47:58] Jesus say I must be about my father's
[48:01] business right your house is producing
[48:04] something right your home is producing
[48:06] something so I want to take that
[48:07] spiritual application and and let's
[48:09] apply that let let's remember your house
[48:12] is a
[48:13] factory your house is we'll say maybe a
[48:17] a herd you know it's producing something
[48:20] Hallelujah this is what God wants you
[48:22] got to you got to declare my house is
[48:24] going to serve God hallelujah
[48:26] we're not going to serve money or Mammon
[48:28] we're not going to serve
[48:29] pleasure right we're not going to serve
[48:32] idolatry right we are going to serve the
[48:35] Lord Jesus Christ that's what me and my
[48:37] house that's what we're that's what
[48:38] we're called to do we're commanded to do
[48:40] that
[48:41] Hallelujah and the father has to see
[48:43] that the leader the husband he has to
[48:45] see that our household is to serve God
[48:50] that's our whole purpose that's why I
[48:52] tell people when in counseling like
[48:53] we've done with Austin Lena everyone
[48:55] amen who everyone we've had the pleasure
[48:57] to marry it and as I preach other places
[48:59] I preach six or seven marriage Banquets
[49:01] I've always the told the people that put
[49:03] God first in your home don't miss church
[49:06] for nothing Hallelujah because you've
[49:09] got to honor God first God tells you
[49:11] give the first fruits come before him
[49:13] with praise and thanksgiving seek me
[49:15] first and everything else will be added
[49:17] unto you Hallelujah don't let Sports
[49:20] interrupt with the worship of God don't
[49:22] let Pleasures don't let anything
[49:23] interrupt seek God verse hallelujah it's
[49:26] a Bible command and a real man will do
[49:28] that
[49:29] Hallelujah We Believe Gathering more as
[49:32] we see that day approaching we also
[49:33] believe there's times of
[49:35] rest Hallelujah we didn't take a rest in
[49:37] January or February so it just start to
[49:40] it starts to hit me about this time of
[49:41] the year where I go to I go to work on
[49:43] Monday and I I'm just trying to stay
[49:45] awake I'm trying not to during my break
[49:46] I try not to fall asleep sometimes
[49:49] because I need a rest sometimes
[49:51] Hallelujah but this was a man this is
[49:53] what a man's called to do lead his house
[49:57] command his house he should give the
[49:58] orders praise God right now the mother
[50:01] gives the order to the children right
[50:02] but the ultimate order should come from
[50:04] the husband he's the leader Hallelujah
[50:07] he's the father of the faith and I like
[50:10] this if a man will do that then God will
[50:12] bring all his good promises to pass amen
[50:16] hallelujah if the man honors God God
[50:18] will bless the man hallelujah amen and
[50:20] the rest of the family amen this is a
[50:24] Christian family Hallelujah this is how
[50:26] Christian should uh walk and we'll get
[50:29] to it later but this man doesn't rule
[50:30] just by the Iron Fist it's a it's a
[50:33] leadership of
[50:34] love love is the strength of his
[50:37] leadership Hallelujah love and we'll get
[50:40] to it in a little bit you know that uh
[50:42] the Bible just lays it over and over you
[50:45] know and then brother baham tells us you
[50:46] know as the Bible shows to we have some
[50:48] people that are very dogmatic you know
[50:50] they're very iron fisted he said but
[50:51] then you got really kind and gentle
[50:54] people you got God has a variety of
[50:57] leadership right but despite the style
[51:00] of
[51:01] leadership what matters is keeping the
[51:04] commands yes amen you can keep the
[51:06] commands as a a very strict person but
[51:09] you can also keep the commands as a very
[51:11] kind person how do I know because I've
[51:13] seen both right I have preacher friends
[51:16] that are really strict and they're ra
[51:18] super strict and I have other people I
[51:19] try to be the kind
[51:21] leader like you I don't think my
[51:23] children have ever he heard me yell have
[51:25] I ever yelled at home one time and said
[51:28] you get yourself right this is my house
[51:31] and they've never Lydia but the oldest
[51:34] now she said
[51:35] no I'm a more of a Kind leader I like to
[51:38] be like kind but there's nothing wrong
[51:40] with raising your voice god Ra Jesus
[51:42] raised his voice there but see God's God
[51:45] of righty the main thing is love God
[51:47] with all your heart soul mind and
[51:49] strength Hallelujah and love thy
[51:51] neighbor as thyself on these two
[51:54] Commandments hang every law
[51:56] Hallelujah right love fulfills the whole
[51:59] law of God
[52:00] hallelujah I preach like I'm a strict
[52:03] leader at home but I'm really not I'm
[52:04] really by God's grace I tried to
[52:06] be also let's go to Deuteronomy 6 we get
[52:09] these commands Deuteronomy 6 verse6 if
[52:11] you got your Bible there you'd like to
[52:12] read along or case is really fast you
[52:14] can put it up there Deuteronomy
[52:17] 66 just want to go over some of these
[52:19] major verses here that lay down our
[52:22] commands as a Christian family and we'll
[52:24] kind of deal with the fathers here Lord
[52:26] willing we'll look at the mothers and
[52:28] these words which I command thee this
[52:30] day shall be in thine heart right so we
[52:34] we have brother R's message here but we
[52:36] just don't want it here we want it
[52:38] here church I see it all the time I see
[52:41] it all the time I'm not perfect but
[52:42] brother Ram says when you get the Holy
[52:43] Ghost it's like a buzzer that goes off
[52:46] right when you see sin the buzzer goes
[52:48] off that means the message is in your
[52:50] heart amen it protects your life
[52:53] Hallelujah like I can I can listen to a
[52:55] preacher for a few minutes I can get the
[52:56] buzzer right away if he's a if he's a
[52:58] false preacher I've seen it many many
[53:01] times right you you you do too or you
[53:05] meet somebody new just let them talk
[53:07] brother say you could let them talk for
[53:08] a few minutes pretty soon you'll know
[53:09] their spirit and then he says let me go
[53:12] in that brother's home let me look at
[53:13] what's on his walls I say like this let
[53:15] me scroll on his phone for about five
[53:17] minutes I'll tell you what's in his
[53:18] heart Hallelujah let me check his
[53:21] deleted pictures let me check his
[53:23] deleted emails and delet well I can't do
[53:24] deleted but let let me check
[53:27] that right I'll tell you what's in their
[53:29] heart Deuteronomy
[53:31] 6:7 and thou shalt teach them diligently
[53:34] unto thy children now see that's what
[53:36] that's why we try to do that we try to
[53:37] do Bible studies and teach the children
[53:38] but we also have to do it in the
[53:41] home D it's got to be
[53:43] diligent right and now now we know most
[53:45] of us that were raised in denomination
[53:47] for some of us it was just once a Sunday
[53:49] for an hour right if your church that
[53:52] that if your church service was one hour
[53:53] that's all you had that was all the
[53:55] teaching but a real Christian family
[53:57] brings it home yes and every day there's
[54:00] talk about the Bible every day there's
[54:02] an Open Bible Glory every day there's a
[54:04] song of Praise In The House
[54:06] hallelujah it's diligent it's every day
[54:09] teaching the word of God and the home
[54:12] just backs up what's being preached at
[54:14] church remember the Bible said the wives
[54:16] are supposed to ask their husbands at
[54:18] home right then the children if Dad's
[54:21] not there the children ask the mom right
[54:23] if Mom don't know Mom will ask Dad if
[54:25] Dad don't know he can ask the pastor
[54:26] amen but then in our questions and
[54:28] answers you can ask me too amen right
[54:31] but but the Bible said this home is
[54:33] supposed to be established with
[54:35] diligence it's just supposed to be the
[54:37] word the word the word the word
[54:39] hallelujah amen that's how you get the
[54:41] right
[54:42] results and shalt talk of them when thou
[54:45] sest in thine house and when thou
[54:46] walkest by the way and when thou liest
[54:48] down when thou Rises up so you try by
[54:51] God's grace to keep all the focus on the
[54:54] word of God
[54:56] and of course you can talk about uh
[54:58] family issues or issues out in the uh in
[55:01] in the society but you want to bring it
[55:03] all back to what God's word would say
[55:05] what's God's word say about the
[55:07] political environment what's God's word
[55:09] say about the social norms that are
[55:11] changing what does God's word say about
[55:14] it right and if it's a negative thing
[55:16] let's say well let's pray for them
[55:18] Hallelujah let's add let's let's say
[55:20] true to God's word then hallelujah amen
[55:23] it's all it's you got to talk about the
[55:24] things we see it we live here we're of
[55:26] the world I'm sorry we're in the world
[55:28] but we're not of the world
[55:30] Amen let's bring all those conversations
[55:33] back to the word of
[55:35] God verse eight and thou shalt bind them
[55:38] for a sign upon thine hand and they
[55:40] shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
[55:43] and thou shalt write them upon the post
[55:45] of thy house and on the gates so in
[55:48] other words surround yourself with the
[55:50] word of God think about it all the time
[55:53] now Deuteronomy 11:18 is kind of a
[55:55] repeat of this Deuteronomy 11:18
[55:57] therefore shall you lay up these words
[56:00] in your heart and in your soul see that
[56:01] I like that heart would be the mind
[56:04] right and then your soul and bind them
[56:05] for a sign upon your hand that they may
[56:07] be as frontless between your eyes and
[56:09] you shall teach them your children
[56:12] speaking of them when thou sest in thine
[56:14] house and when thou walkest by the way
[56:16] when thou liest down and when thou
[56:17] risest up and thou shalt write them upon
[56:19] the doorpost of thine house and upon thy
[56:21] Gates that your days may be multiplied
[56:23] the days of your children the land which
[56:25] the Lord swear unto your fathers to give
[56:27] them as the days of Heaven upon the
[56:30] Earth amen now these blessings go all
[56:32] the way to verse 25 so I'm not going to
[56:34] read all that but this is echoed by Paul
[56:37] in Ephesians 6 children honor your
[56:41] parents in the Lord for this is right
[56:42] obey your parents in the Lord right
[56:45] honor them and the Bible said you're
[56:46] given a long life so we see a lot of
[56:49] these promises do carry over in some
[56:51] ways to the New Testament Hallelujah
[56:55] and what great promises they are and so
[56:58] it's our duty as parents to teach them
[57:01] to the children or if you don't have
[57:02] children teach them to your nieces and
[57:04] your nephews amen or any children you
[57:07] work with or whatever may be if you if
[57:10] some child is looking up to you you must
[57:12] model to them a real Christian character
[57:14] Hallelujah the real Spirit of Christ
[57:18] Hallelujah like I told you I've had
[57:20] numerous teachers come in over the years
[57:21] and I had just the teacher tell me this
[57:23] week she said I've never been in a class
[57:24] full of so much love Mr Smith and I said
[57:27] that's God's love amen hallelujah I hope
[57:30] it's I hope it's always that way praise
[57:31] God where there's love and there's
[57:33] compassion and there's mercy and there's
[57:35] judgment Hallelujah like the Bible says
[57:38] but it's our duty to teach them to the
[57:41] children and then surround ourselves
[57:43] talk about it as much as we can
[57:45] throughout the day you know I love
[57:47] Saturdays my on Saturdays my wife
[57:49] listens to brother brandom all morning
[57:50] and she'll almost it's almost always she
[57:53] sent me five or six texts here's some
[57:55] quotes from brother brandom and just
[57:56] thoughts I just love it it's something
[57:57] we can talk about then throughout the
[57:58] rest of the week something we can talk
[58:01] about when I get home you know I'm
[58:02] studying usually at the church and I'll
[58:03] just get texts from her and I love
[58:05] hearing all those uh insights that my
[58:07] wife gives me that that that gift of
[58:10] knowledge I believe
[58:11] amen and it just allows us to keep
[58:14] talking about the things of God and then
[58:15] I'll share what I've been studying and
[58:17] I'm kind of what I'm preparing to preach
[58:19] and things on our hearts and that's one
[58:22] way we talk about it and as we start
[58:24] that new tradition
[58:25] uh two months ago every Sunday night
[58:27] before we pray we have all the children
[58:29] share their favorite thing about church
[58:31] service that day it's been wonderful I'm
[58:33] like wow I love to hear what they
[58:35] remember now zans might be like oh
[58:38] hugging Jose or hugging amen or
[58:39] something like that I say well that I
[58:41] guess that counts you know you're with
[58:43] God's
[58:44] people I don't expect him to memorize
[58:46] the sermon yet
[58:48] but but I really like that because I
[58:50] like to see what what the children are
[58:52] taking away from it right because
[58:55] sometimes I'm just like instruct
[58:56] instruct and tell tell tell I like to
[58:58] hear well what up what are you thinking
[59:00] about I like that and guess what I got
[59:02] that from a presbyterian preacher who
[59:03] got it from Jonathan Edwards who was a
[59:05] real man of God he preached sinners in
[59:07] the hands of an Angry God I mean some
[59:09] amazing sermons that was his uh that was
[59:12] his uh tradition on Sunday nights
[59:14] thought what a good tradition by God's
[59:16] grace so we might start that on well
[59:18] can't do Wednesday night maybe we could
[59:19] do it Thursday night yeah Thursday night
[59:21] can you remember one good thing from
[59:22] Wednesday night's uh Gathering
[59:25] Hallelujah but the point is focus
[59:27] everything around the word of God as
[59:29] much as possible praise God now Ezra 8
[59:32] I'm sorry Ezra 8:21 honey can you pull
[59:34] that up
[59:35] there and I'm going to go to Nehemiah
[59:44] 4:14 Ezra
[59:50] 8:21 you know if you remember this you
[59:52] know the uh the Jews were on their way
[59:54] way going back to the promised land
[59:56] after the 70 years of
[59:58] Exile and I just love this I proclaimed
[1:00:01] a fast there at the river ahava that we
[1:00:03] might afflict ourselves before God to
[1:00:05] seek of him a right way for us and for
[1:00:07] our little ones and for all of our
[1:00:09] substance and I just want to pull the
[1:00:11] spiritual lesson out of here they were
[1:00:13] naturally trying to find their way back
[1:00:15] I they were saying these daddies are
[1:00:16] saying I don't know how we're going to
[1:00:17] make the way there I don't know how that
[1:00:19] we're going to make this journey so I
[1:00:21] better fast and I better seek God so we
[1:00:23] can make the way Hallelujah and that's
[1:00:26] what natural dads and moms should do
[1:00:28] today if they don't know the direction
[1:00:30] if they don't know what God's calling
[1:00:31] them if they don't know the next step
[1:00:33] the best thing to do is fast and pray
[1:00:35] seek God's face skip some meals so you
[1:00:38] can have a spiritual meal in the
[1:00:39] presence of God hallelujah amen how many
[1:00:41] times have I done that you know I don't
[1:00:42] know the direction I don't know God's
[1:00:44] will that's what we've done we seek we
[1:00:46] fast we seek God we make the flesh
[1:00:49] uncomfortable so the soul can be
[1:00:51] comforted hallelujah amen like brother
[1:00:54] man said a a fast in the spiritual is a
[1:00:57] feast in the Lord hallelujah when you're
[1:00:59] fasting naturally that's when your soul
[1:01:01] can really Feast on the word of God
[1:01:04] Amen so see we how many want to go the
[1:01:07] right way praise God Jesus is the way
[1:01:10] the word is the way the word is the
[1:01:11] right way Hallelujah so see you got to
[1:01:14] go to some lengths if uh you got to go
[1:01:16] to some lengths of sacrifice if you want
[1:01:18] to find God's way Hallelujah but I find
[1:01:21] most people do that like I told you you
[1:01:23] know some people that left the message
[1:01:24] they've never
[1:01:25] fasted well no wonder their family's
[1:01:28] chosen the wrong way that's just
[1:01:29] striking me right now I never thought
[1:01:30] about that till now no wonder the
[1:01:32] family's going the wrong way with women
[1:01:35] uh crossdressing women cutting hair men
[1:01:37] no backbone to stand don't even know the
[1:01:39] W the right water baptism or now going
[1:01:41] to a a pride Church a pride church that
[1:01:46] celebrates Pride I'm talking about
[1:01:48] sinful Pride homosexuality
[1:01:51] agenda it just proves you know that they
[1:01:54] never really sought the right way right
[1:01:57] they didn't take time to really make it
[1:01:59] real to them amen church God wants to
[1:02:02] meet with each one of us hallelujah God
[1:02:04] said draw nigh to me I will draw nigh to
[1:02:07] you what a promise amen the god of the
[1:02:10] universe will draw nigh to us and show
[1:02:12] us here's the right way that you go I'm
[1:02:15] going to share this now before I forget
[1:02:16] it but years ago when we first started
[1:02:18] the church you know we had uh many a
[1:02:20] couple families well one family in
[1:02:22] particular stopped coming to church
[1:02:25] on Sunday nights and Wednesday nights
[1:02:27] and I thought my heart's breaking we're
[1:02:28] a small church already so I laid at this
[1:02:30] altar right there now it might have been
[1:02:32] known in that room but I laid this Altar
[1:02:33] and I said I was weeping and crying I
[1:02:35] said God I believe we should gather more
[1:02:38] as we see that day approaching I believe
[1:02:40] it's wrong to take my family out of
[1:02:42] church and I said God I I said please
[1:02:45] hear my prayer let my children be filled
[1:02:48] with the Holy Ghost before that family
[1:02:50] before those children as evidence that I
[1:02:52] chose the right way Hallelujah
[1:02:55] amen and by God's grace I can say it
[1:02:57] today Hallelujah that I've got children
[1:02:59] with the Holy Ghost amen because we
[1:03:01] chose the right way Hallelujah the way
[1:03:05] of
[1:03:07] God because my house is a service house
[1:03:10] for the
[1:03:11] Lord my house is a house where that's
[1:03:14] our main focus we're going to serve
[1:03:16] Jesus
[1:03:18] Hallelujah I still was telling my wife
[1:03:19] the other day I still remember lyd and
[1:03:21] Malachi had their bunk beds and I'd go
[1:03:22] up and once they'd fall asleep or I'd C
[1:03:24] maybea and ly were on the bottom and
[1:03:26] Malachi was on the top I wait till
[1:03:27] they're all asleep and I'd say Lord fill
[1:03:29] Malachi with the Holy Ghost In The Name
[1:03:31] of Jesus while he's young so when the
[1:03:34] when the days come he's strong in the
[1:03:36] faith and I Lay My Hands on acia L I
[1:03:38] said Lord fill them with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:40] before the evil days can come Hallelujah
[1:03:42] and God is gracious Hallelujah God is
[1:03:44] good amen but I still got to do my part
[1:03:47] I still got to talk about Jesus in the
[1:03:50] morning in the evening in you're coming
[1:03:52] in you're going Hallelujah talk about
[1:03:55] him amen Malai and I we always pray
[1:03:57] before we go into Taekwondo class don't
[1:03:58] we I say God protect our minds and our
[1:04:02] bodies and if time goes on we're going
[1:04:04] to have our own class one day we're
[1:04:06] going to tell them about
[1:04:08] Jesus we're GNA be preaching from June B
[1:04:12] the ready
[1:04:13] position where are we preaching
[1:04:14] Hallelujah tell them about Jesus because
[1:04:17] you can't separated praise God you're a
[1:04:20] city on a hill that cannot be hidden you
[1:04:22] are the salt of the earth
[1:04:25] Hallelujah that's why this message
[1:04:26] attracted me it was salty right it has
[1:04:28] flavor to it it's got Revelation to it
[1:04:31] it's not a dead Creed it's a living word
[1:04:33] hallelujah I was raised in dead Creeds I
[1:04:36] was raised in denominations but when I
[1:04:38] saw this message it was eternal life
[1:04:40] Hallelujah the living word amen as the
[1:04:42] angel said go tell them the words of
[1:04:44] this life Hallelujah that's what I
[1:04:47] wanted I wanted to live like brother
[1:04:48] Brooks I want to live like brother Craig
[1:04:50] I want to live like Dave lell and by the
[1:04:51] grace of God I live with the same life
[1:04:53] they live The Life of Christ
[1:04:56] hallelujah amen Nehemiah
[1:05:00] 4:14 here's what we need though we need
[1:05:03] men and I looked and Rose up and I said
[1:05:05] to the Nobles and the rulers and the
[1:05:06] rest of the people be ye not afraid of
[1:05:09] them don't be afraid of
[1:05:12] leoa remember the Lord which is great
[1:05:15] and terrible and fight for your brethren
[1:05:17] your sons and your daughters your wives
[1:05:19] and your houses this is when they're
[1:05:21] building the house I'm sorry building
[1:05:22] the wall they re rebuilding the wall of
[1:05:25] Jerusalem and he said don't be afraid of
[1:05:26] the enemies fight for your
[1:05:29] family we know fighting in prayer right
[1:05:32] but it's also fighting in the home as
[1:05:34] far as fighting spirits to show them the
[1:05:36] right the right word of God to teach
[1:05:39] them to obey the word of God it's worth
[1:05:41] the fight
[1:05:42] Hallelujah I can look back and see my
[1:05:45] mom uh was fighting against uh four four
[1:05:48] teenage boys to get them up to go to
[1:05:50] church it was worth the fight now she
[1:05:52] got three preachers out of them
[1:05:54] it's worth a fight amen might not feel
[1:05:57] good in the midst of the fight but keep
[1:05:58] fighting the good fight of Faith
[1:06:00] hallelujah amen think of that three
[1:06:03] preachers beating them with uh beating
[1:06:05] them with bats and spraying them with
[1:06:06] vinegar to get them the house of God now
[1:06:08] they're in the house of God the most
[1:06:10] amen they travel overseas they travel
[1:06:12] Wherever Would wherever the Holy Spirit
[1:06:14] would lead them it's worth the fight
[1:06:16] hallelujah amen she did that basically
[1:06:19] alone my by God's
[1:06:20] grace so remembers Brothers It's a fight
[1:06:23] and mothers too if the husband's not
[1:06:25] there to fight then you fight hallelujah
[1:06:27] amen everybody fights now I want to show
[1:06:30] you again this blessing so Psalm chap 1
[1:06:33] verse one blessed is the man that
[1:06:35] walketh not in the counts of the ungodly
[1:06:37] nor standeth the way of Sinners nor sth
[1:06:40] in the seat of the scornful so a blessed
[1:06:43] man a blessed man is a father a husband
[1:06:45] he'll be blessed because he walks in the
[1:06:48] ways of God so not only does he teach
[1:06:50] his children to do it but he models it
[1:06:51] for them you want to see how to be a
[1:06:54] Godly Man son look at my
[1:06:56] life Hallelujah I've always played with
[1:06:59] this idea I love to wake Malachi up I
[1:07:01] haven't done this yet but I love to wake
[1:07:02] him up at five o'clock when I wake up
[1:07:03] and say come study the Bible with me you
[1:07:05] know maybe one day we'll do that buddy
[1:07:07] my God's great but he's growing a lot he
[1:07:09] needs a lot of
[1:07:10] sleep but he he knows my life the girls
[1:07:14] they know my
[1:07:15] life remember that great teaching uh the
[1:07:18] some scientist studies families and they
[1:07:20] said how what's the best way to teach
[1:07:21] your children they said Step One is
[1:07:23] model
[1:07:25] step two is model and guess what step
[1:07:27] three is
[1:07:29] model if you want your children to learn
[1:07:31] anything model it before them this is
[1:07:34] how we pray this is how we serve God
[1:07:36] this is how we study the Bible like I
[1:07:37] love Zion uh he comes in all the time
[1:07:40] he's like he sees me highlighting he
[1:07:42] says Daddy can I have a Bible where's my
[1:07:43] highlighter so had to buy him some
[1:07:45] highlighters and now he highlights his
[1:07:46] Bible while I'm highlighting mine is
[1:07:49] that just that's the most purest purest
[1:07:51] example I see Daddy highlight in his
[1:07:54] Bible I want to spend and he'll just
[1:07:56] quietly sit there and is he in here no
[1:07:58] he'll just quietly highlight the whole
[1:07:59] time I'm highlighting my Bible I said a
[1:08:01] 20-minute timer to highlight go over the
[1:08:02] scriptures you know or if I'm in my
[1:08:04] prayer closet he'll come in and knock
[1:08:06] and he'll come and sit on his prayer
[1:08:07] closet with me on my little mat there
[1:08:10] I'm sure Mali used to do that too we all
[1:08:11] used to do that together but that's the
[1:08:13] best way if you want uh your children to
[1:08:16] follow God invite them into your
[1:08:19] worship model before them and invite
[1:08:22] them in hallelujah amen like brother Tim
[1:08:24] mimmy that wonderful brother now of
[1:08:26] course we haven't had much Fellowship
[1:08:27] but he's he's now a pastor but I asked
[1:08:30] him you know when I first became a
[1:08:31] pastor my children were little he had
[1:08:33] four daughters and I said they they just
[1:08:36] love the Lord I said brother how'd you
[1:08:38] do it how'd you produce such children
[1:08:39] like that he said we did everything
[1:08:41] together by the word of God so you know
[1:08:44] they did horses you know they uh they
[1:08:47] went to special meetings together
[1:08:48] everything they did they did together
[1:08:50] and that's why you know I don't send my
[1:08:51] children off to camp meetings where none
[1:08:53] of us go go now one day meetings are
[1:08:55] okay but you won't see me send my
[1:08:57] children off well bye and go enjoy a
[1:08:59] week without me being there no I want to
[1:09:01] be there by God's grace they're mine
[1:09:04] until they move
[1:09:05] out right they're they're God's Heritage
[1:09:08] it's God's Heritage to me Hallelujah I'm
[1:09:11] responsible I'm the one who's got to
[1:09:12] answer right just like Eli failed his
[1:09:15] sons Eli failed his sons by not
[1:09:17] correcting them not being there enough
[1:09:21] right he didn't restrain he didn't
[1:09:22] restrain them he should have said said
[1:09:24] stop stealing that fat from the offering
[1:09:25] and stop laying stop laying with these
[1:09:27] women they're not your wives he should
[1:09:29] have been there but he wasn't
[1:09:31] there and so he lost the priesthood
[1:09:34] forever because he wouldn't restrain his
[1:09:37] children but the Bible said the man of
[1:09:39] God in the house of God must rule over
[1:09:41] his wife and children
[1:09:43] Hallelujah that sure helps when they got
[1:09:45] the Holy Ghost because then they can
[1:09:46] kind of rule themselves the Holy Ghost
[1:09:48] will rule them right but until they get
[1:09:50] the Holy Ghost it's our responsibility
[1:09:52] to help rule over for them with
[1:09:56] love right like I told my children I
[1:09:58] never asked them to do anything that I
[1:09:59] haven't done Malai sweeps the floor I've
[1:10:02] done that right uh Mali mowed the grass
[1:10:05] well I mowed it first what uh Mali wash
[1:10:08] dishes I wash dishes first I I'll humble
[1:10:11] myself I can do that by God's grace
[1:10:13] everything I ask him to do I do it first
[1:10:16] I'm not going to ask them like the
[1:10:17] Pharisees they ask you to do things but
[1:10:19] they don't do it themselves they won't
[1:10:21] lift one finger to help anybody out
[1:10:24] that's a real sign of a Pharisee a lazy
[1:10:26] person trying to boss people around
[1:10:29] Hallelujah that's true verse two but his
[1:10:32] Delight is in the law of the Lord what
[1:10:34] does the man of God love so much I love
[1:10:36] the word amen and his law do he meditate
[1:10:40] day and night see it's Satan who wants
[1:10:42] to think oh the word is boring or
[1:10:44] there's nothing new in the Bible That's
[1:10:46] Satan's
[1:10:47] lies God promises if you're a man if
[1:10:49] you're a blessed man and you meditate on
[1:10:51] the word the word will make you happy
[1:10:54] Hallelujah the word you can meditate on
[1:10:56] it day and night and God will show you
[1:10:58] revelation after Revelation from Faith
[1:11:00] to Faith from glory to glory God's word
[1:11:03] is an inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[1:11:06] Hallelujah I've seen it like we just saw
[1:11:09] it with brother Simon getting that great
[1:11:11] revelation of rebaptism in the Old
[1:11:13] Testament wasn't that beautiful my
[1:11:15] goodness I'm still blessed by that
[1:11:17] always wondered where is rebaptism uh
[1:11:20] typed in the Old Testament in the life
[1:11:21] of Joseph two burials one burial in the
[1:11:25] world and one burial in the promise amen
[1:11:28] God let me be buried in Jesus Christ's
[1:11:30] promise Amen Let Me Be planted there
[1:11:34] because I'll rise in the resurrection of
[1:11:35] it
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:39] amen verse three and he shall be like a
[1:11:41] tree planted by the rivers of water that
[1:11:43] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:11:45] his Leaf shall also not wither and
[1:11:48] whosoever I'm sorry whatsoever he doeth
[1:11:51] shall
[1:11:52] prosper Hallelujah now not every
[1:11:55] absolutely everything I've done has
[1:11:57] prospered every single thing but the
[1:11:59] majority of things that I do should
[1:12:01] Prosper if I'm following God right
[1:12:03] because God won't Lead Me In something
[1:12:04] that's not going to be a blessing to the
[1:12:05] body of
[1:12:06] Christ right just this week like I tell
[1:12:09] you every week I get emails people
[1:12:11] blessed I tell you one of the best ones
[1:12:13] if he's listening now one of the best
[1:12:14] ones was my brother Paul he sent me a
[1:12:16] picture last Sunday and he's highlighted
[1:12:17] up my 2021 book just chapter one and I
[1:12:20] started crying I like CU you I forget
[1:12:22] about all these things he's like I don't
[1:12:24] know how God had you do that I just said
[1:12:27] well I just say well thank God I'm glad
[1:12:29] that uh my influence is going out the
[1:12:31] influence God gave me hallelujah it's
[1:12:33] God's word so we want our works to be
[1:12:36] fruitful we want to see uh fruits to our
[1:12:38] lives and our Ministries Hallelujah but
[1:12:41] how do you get that it's being
[1:12:43] blessed it's Matthew 6:33 seeking first
[1:12:46] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:12:49] and everything else will be added unto
[1:12:51] you praise God think about that if you
[1:12:53] just just seek God and seek Holiness and
[1:12:54] seek obedience you get every other
[1:12:57] blessing you get health you get finances
[1:12:59] you get uh uh uh favor you get all these
[1:13:02] things if you just SE God first why
[1:13:04] wouldn't people do it I would think
[1:13:06] they'd be excited to do it but it's
[1:13:07] because they love sin thank God there's
[1:13:09] a people that love Holiness hallelujah
[1:13:12] amen my what a promise if I just do this
[1:13:14] one thing I get everything else if I can
[1:13:17] just go this one way every other
[1:13:19] question is settled hallelujah amen
[1:13:22] thank God Amen a promise let's say all
[1:13:25] things can we all things if I can just
[1:13:28] get this one area of my life amen in
[1:13:31] order I ain't got to worry about
[1:13:33] everything else and that has been
[1:13:35] nothing but the truth in my
[1:13:37] life if I can just keep God first
[1:13:40] everything else is added unto
[1:13:43] me Hallelujah this is a blessed man now
[1:13:47] who meditates day and night in the law
[1:13:49] of
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:54] Isaiah
[1:13:57] 2028 verse one yeah I'm I need to turn
[1:14:00] there y I don't have this one on my
[1:14:01] screen there Psalm 128 so again now
[1:14:05] we're going to look at another thing the
[1:14:08] psalm says about a blessed
[1:14:13] man I love this old Bible brother Rod
[1:14:16] gave me I love it this Thompson Chain
[1:14:18] Bible who's got a Thompson Chain Bible
[1:14:20] anybody got a Thompson Chain boy these
[1:14:22] are awesome bbes
[1:14:23] it's like the whole thing in the back is
[1:14:25] one big Bible study after you get done
[1:14:26] with the Bible and there's all these top
[1:14:28] it's like a topical reference you know
[1:14:29] about family you know about you know
[1:14:31] honor dishonor covenants selfishness I
[1:14:34] mean it's just it's just a treasure
[1:14:35] Trove right that's that's that's my word
[1:14:37] right a treasure Trove of Bible
[1:14:40] Revelation in
[1:14:42] there Isaiah I'm sorry Psalm
[1:14:44] 128 it's only six
[1:14:48] verses and notice blessed is everyone
[1:14:51] that fearth the Lord that walth in his
[1:14:53] ways in other words we're going to look
[1:14:55] at the fear of the Lord just for a
[1:14:56] moment so anyone that fears God and then
[1:14:58] seeks him will be
[1:15:00] blessed so this is what the man has to
[1:15:03] do or the wife if his husband ain't if
[1:15:05] her husband isn't doing it I shouldn't
[1:15:06] say ain't is not doing it they have to
[1:15:09] seek God they have to fear
[1:15:11] God that walketh in his ways see each
[1:15:15] day they walk in obedience to the word
[1:15:17] of God verse two for Thou shalt eat the
[1:15:19] labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be
[1:15:22] and it shall be well with thee so when
[1:15:25] we fear God or respect God honor God by
[1:15:28] obeying his commands the Bible says
[1:15:30] you'll be happy how many happy people
[1:15:33] here
[1:15:34] today how many eating because God's G
[1:15:36] you a good job to labor in thank God
[1:15:41] Hallelujah how many have it well your
[1:15:43] your life is well Hallelujah all's
[1:15:46] well right all's well verse three thy
[1:15:49] wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the
[1:15:51] sides of thine house
[1:15:53] thy children like Olive plants round
[1:15:56] about thy table so he gives this
[1:15:58] illustration now of the blessed man his
[1:16:01] wife is like a Vine right up on the
[1:16:03] house notice it's not far away it's
[1:16:05] right attached to the house it's not
[1:16:07] it's not in the bar right it's not down
[1:16:09] there in the city it's right connected
[1:16:11] to her Ministries in the home Hallelujah
[1:16:13] that's right
[1:16:15] amen and the children are around about
[1:16:17] like Olive
[1:16:19] plants and I read something about olive
[1:16:21] trees from one of the preachers the
[1:16:23] preacher said the Olive Tree will put
[1:16:24] forth all these owls but at the end of
[1:16:26] his life uh all these other trees start
[1:16:29] springing up underneath that Olive Tree
[1:16:31] so when this one goes down the little
[1:16:33] ones are planted right next to it ready
[1:16:35] to come up and start producing more
[1:16:37] fruit and that's what the illustration
[1:16:40] here gives the father's there and he's
[1:16:42] that Olive Tree he's going to be
[1:16:43] fruitful for a season but then it's
[1:16:45] going to come the next season and and
[1:16:47] then his own life glory amen his own
[1:16:50] labors right his own fruit of his own
[1:16:52] life will come up and then they'll
[1:16:54] produce for the Next Generation
[1:16:56] Hallelujah the next season hallelujah
[1:17:00] amen verse four behold that thus shall
[1:17:03] the man be blessed that fearth the Lord
[1:17:07] remember that's honor I honor God
[1:17:09] everywhere at work at home at school in
[1:17:11] my family on the job I honor God I
[1:17:15] respect God everywhere in my
[1:17:18] life Hallelujah the fear of the Lord the
[1:17:21] Lord shall bless thee out of Zion
[1:17:23] and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem
[1:17:25] all the days of thy life Hallelujah so
[1:17:29] God again will bless your entire life
[1:17:32] Hallelujah yay Thou shalt see thy
[1:17:34] children's children grandchildren and
[1:17:36] peace upon Israel peace in the land
[1:17:39] Hallelujah hey church we live in a very
[1:17:41] peaceful state by God's grace right

[1:17:59] think it starts with a a I just saw it
[1:18:00] this morning it was Austin Texas so so I
[1:18:03] mean think about that people live in an
[1:18:06] area like that where there's violence
[1:18:07] and death and destruction no protection
[1:18:10] they've they've really got to trust in
[1:18:12] God right but most most but but look at
[1:18:15] our lives God has blessed us here
[1:18:17] hallelujah God's been merciful great is
[1:18:20] his faithfulness
[1:18:21] Hallelujah so we see this picture of a
[1:18:24] man he's sitting around his table now we
[1:18:26] need more of these at our house then
[1:18:27] that's that's my job because we got busy
[1:18:30] nights but a man with his wife and the
[1:18:33] children all at the table and God said
[1:18:36] happy is that man when he's right there
[1:18:39] Allelujah because this is our
[1:18:41] foreshadowing of Jesus Jesus said I'll
[1:18:43] sit down with you at the marriage supper
[1:18:45] of the lamb and we drink a new of the
[1:18:48] vine Hallelujah we'll have
[1:18:51] communion Jesus the husband will be with
[1:18:53] the bride he that hath the bride is the
[1:18:55] bridegroom Hallelujah and he sits down
[1:18:58] with his family at the communion table
[1:19:00] hallelujah it's a prefigure of that oh I
[1:19:03] love it isn't that beautiful
[1:19:05] my look at Psalm 144 so just turn like
[1:19:09] one or two pages one two it's just three
[1:19:12] pages in my Bible Psalm
[1:19:15] 144:12 that our sons may be as plants
[1:19:18] grown up in their youth that our
[1:19:19] daughters may be as cornerstones
[1:19:22] polished after the similitude similitude
[1:19:25] of a
[1:19:26] palace so look at this God makes men
[1:19:30] like he types men as plants how many
[1:19:34] like when you when what what what you
[1:19:35] plant produces good fruit I like a good
[1:19:38] year where we get a lot of good
[1:19:39] blueberries and blackberries right don't
[1:19:42] you we we that's what the Bible says
[1:19:45] your sons are like that my they're just
[1:19:47] so fruitful and your daughters are
[1:19:50] cornerstones not just of a house but a
[1:19:52] palace
[1:19:53] that's royalty
[1:19:54] Hallelujah your your daughters are the
[1:19:57] royalty of Heaven Hallelujah walking on
[1:19:59] Earth
[1:20:01] amen polished I mean just holy beautiful
[1:20:05] like I was telling all my daughters this
[1:20:06] morning you look holy you look beautiful
[1:20:09] I try to tell all of them if I missed
[1:20:10] anybody forgive me I know I told Caris
[1:20:12] and Haven and Victoria I think I forgot
[1:20:15] lyd lydy you look beautiful today you're
[1:20:17] all polished up in the word of God
[1:20:21] hallelujah
[1:20:23] so this is the imagery that God gives us
[1:20:25] remember the Cornerstone I preached this
[1:20:26] on Mother's Day a few years ago the
[1:20:28] Cornerstone was I'm going to build
[1:20:29] everything on this Stone right here and
[1:20:31] this house is either going to stand or
[1:20:33] fall based upon this
[1:20:35] Cornerstone my house is going to either
[1:20:37] stand or fall based upon the wife I
[1:20:38] chose and thank God I got a great wife
[1:20:41] hallelujah amen I know you Brothers feel
[1:20:43] the same
[1:20:44] Hallelujah because you keep the commands
[1:20:46] of God Amen well R said a man will
[1:20:49] choose he said watch what a man chooses
[1:20:51] to marry that will show what what's in
[1:20:53] his mind the kind of future he's
[1:20:55] planning he said if he chooses some
[1:20:57] Hollywood strip teas the shows are going
[1:20:58] to be divorced within a few little
[1:21:01] bit he said but if he chooses a Godly
[1:21:04] woman who's holy he uh then he's
[1:21:06] choosing a a household that serves God
[1:21:08] hallelujah he's choosing a wonderful
[1:21:10] future a blessed future with the fear of
[1:21:12] the
[1:21:15] Lord
[1:21:19] hallelujah remember the Bible said when
[1:21:22] a man is found a Godly wife he's found a
[1:21:24] good
[1:21:24] thing she is a reward from the Lord
[1:21:29] hallelujah I want to look at uh this one
[1:21:31] again this is one of my favorite verses
[1:21:33] if I ever get to writing that book if
[1:21:34] the Lord carries this is one I'm going
[1:21:35] to use a lot this is going to be a major
[1:21:37] one Genesis 335 Genesis
[1:21:44] 335 I love what Jacob says here I'd sure
[1:21:47] like to preach maybe a series on Jacob I
[1:21:48] see so many beautiful things in his life
[1:21:51] Genesis 30 you're faster than me honey
[1:21:52] thank you and he lifted up his eyes and
[1:21:54] saw the women and children this is Esau
[1:21:56] and said who are th are these I'm sorry
[1:21:58] who are those with thee and he said the
[1:22:00] children which God hath graciously given
[1:22:03] thy
[1:22:05] servant Esau sees all of his children he
[1:22:07] says who are they these are my gifts of
[1:22:09] Grace hallelujah it's God's grace the
[1:22:14] world sees children as burdens but Jacob
[1:22:16] saw him these are my gifts of Grace God
[1:22:18] has given to me in other words God and
[1:22:20] the Bible said the children are a reward
[1:22:23] right so God L down from heaven I want
[1:22:25] to bless them I'm going to give them a
[1:22:26] Lydia I'm going to give them a Malachi
[1:22:28] and I'll list the rest of them later you
[1:22:30] know put your name in there my children
[1:22:32] here your
[1:22:34] rewards your your your God's gracious
[1:22:37] gifts Hallelujah ain't that beautiful
[1:22:39] man I love
[1:22:41] that Hallelujah now let's get to to this
[1:22:44] man Ephesians 5:25 said husbands love
[1:22:47] your wives as Christ loved the
[1:22:51] church now I want to put these quotes up
[1:22:53] here from Brother brand just they're
[1:22:54] nice to review sometimes these are some
[1:22:56] quotes I've used at the marriage uh
[1:22:59] Banquets here so casea if you can just
[1:23:00] switch over
[1:23:06] here I read this book and it was a great
[1:23:08] book and uh it said Brothers your wife
[1:23:11] needs at least five things and I have I
[1:23:15] have scriptures for all these I I preach
[1:23:16] it many times like I said the seven
[1:23:18] marriage Banquets I preach it here
[1:23:20] before but I'm not going to go through
[1:23:21] all of them but I just want to hit just
[1:23:22] a few things and show you how brother
[1:23:24] brandham backed all this up because
[1:23:25] brother Bram was a bible-based prophet
[1:23:28] Hallelujah so a woman a wife needs
[1:23:31] affection so a man's got to learn how to
[1:23:33] show affection so hugging
[1:23:36] handholding uh all the affection that
[1:23:39] she would need to know that she's loved
[1:23:41] and she's cared for right got to have
[1:23:45] affection number two openness and
[1:23:48] honesty sisters want a man that's going
[1:23:50] to tell them what they're really
[1:23:51] thinking
[1:23:53] hallelujah amen don't want to hide
[1:23:55] things now as a man you just keep your
[1:23:58] own sins right you can keep your sins
[1:23:59] between you and God right you don't have
[1:24:00] to tell your wife all your sins I don't
[1:24:03] right because that's between God and me
[1:24:06] I want to live so close to God that my
[1:24:07] wife just sees my good
[1:24:09] parts now she always sometimes sees my
[1:24:11] bad
[1:24:12] parts but she wants someone she needs a
[1:24:15] man who's open and
[1:24:18] honest third she needs conversation she
[1:24:20] needs that man to talk to her listen to
[1:24:23] her he don't have to solve all of her
[1:24:25] problems right sometimes just needs to
[1:24:27] listen right because some problems a man
[1:24:29] can't
[1:24:30] solve right I can be your husband but I
[1:24:33] can't be God I'm talking about that for
[1:24:35] all husbands you know not just my wife I
[1:24:38] can't give you your Soul's desire Only
[1:24:40] God Can fulfill your Soul's
[1:24:41] desire
[1:24:43] right I can be the one your soul loves
[1:24:46] right I can be that person but I can't
[1:24:47] fulfill your entire life I'm not called
[1:24:49] to that I'm called to love you amen but
[1:24:52] I can't meet every single need in your
[1:24:54] life right but I want to love my wife
[1:24:56] with all my strength Hallelujah because
[1:24:58] that in that way I love God's daughter I
[1:25:01] show my love to God by loving God's
[1:25:03] children she needs family commitment
[1:25:05] someone who's committed to the family
[1:25:07] not here today gone tomorrow back again
[1:25:10] like these deadbeat dads right that run
[1:25:12] around and you don't know when they're
[1:25:13] coming back or if they're coming
[1:25:15] back and then she needs financial
[1:25:18] support of course if she's staying at
[1:25:19] home and everything like that but those
[1:25:21] those are those are things we've gone
[1:25:23] over see the brothers who are married
[1:25:25] probably they've already been able to do
[1:25:28] all these five things which is why their
[1:25:30] wives marry them in the first place so
[1:25:32] Brothers if we're not doing those we got
[1:25:34] to be willing to relearn how to love our
[1:25:36] wives better right she wouldn't have
[1:25:38] married you if you were some deadbeat
[1:25:39] guy right Hallelujah but I've said this
[1:25:43] too if the man can get in position by
[1:25:45] the Holy Ghost then the rest of the
[1:25:46] family will fall in position if he can
[1:25:48] really love it if he can really seek God
[1:25:50] Amen if he seeks God first and then
[1:25:52] loves his wife most things are going to
[1:25:54] fall into order pretty simply because
[1:25:56] God said I'm going to add everything
[1:25:57] else that you
[1:25:58] need right if the wife feels love then
[1:26:01] she's going to love the children
[1:26:04] right but uh I just want to if you
[1:26:07] haven't heard these for a while I think
[1:26:08] I put this on YouTube a few weeks ago
[1:26:10] brother Braham said I was talking about
[1:26:11] men losing their affections for their
[1:26:13] wife and don't love them as they did
[1:26:15] when they were sweethearts shame on you
[1:26:19] so brother always right blast the
[1:26:21] immoral women well here he's going to
[1:26:23] blast some immoral
[1:26:24] men right some people might say it's
[1:26:26] about time right but depends which
[1:26:28] sermons you listen to he was
[1:26:31] Elijah Elijah had to ball out Jezebel he
[1:26:34] sure bought out Ahab too brother brother
[1:26:38] would bounce that but the major
[1:26:40] temptation of our day is the the the
[1:26:42] daughters of men right as it was the
[1:26:44] days of Noah so shall be in the days of
[1:26:46] the son of man the sons of God saw who
[1:26:48] the daughters of men so Satan has really
[1:26:50] tried to trap sons of God God today by
[1:26:53] presenting uh sexy dressed women so
[1:26:55] brother R had to blast that with the
[1:26:57] spirit of
[1:26:58] Elijah some people can't handle it well
[1:27:00] that's because they can't handle the
[1:27:01] truth they stumble at The Stumbling
[1:27:04] Stone right the it's a rock of offense
[1:27:08] Jesus his word offends them the Bible
[1:27:10] offends them that's why they
[1:27:14] stumble brother B said you ought to do
[1:27:17] it Brothers she's always your
[1:27:19] sweetheart Hallelujah like in other
[1:27:22] quotes yeah brother M said he said oh
[1:27:25] that's the part she should be and you
[1:27:27] should treat her like that oh never let
[1:27:28] that little honeymoon cease because it
[1:27:30] ain't going to cease in
[1:27:32] heaven it's going to be just perfectly
[1:27:35] one there that's right it's all like
[1:27:37] some women ought to Said Amen to that
[1:27:39] didn't don't
[1:27:40] you I like that he's like he he's
[1:27:43] laughing when he says it I thought more
[1:27:45] sisters should have said Amen on that he
[1:27:47] said you're always balling out women
[1:27:49] like that sister Hickerson why don't you
[1:27:50] say something he said' thank you sister
[1:27:53] Cox that's very good brother Cox that's
[1:27:55] for you ever where you are
[1:27:58] now so I can call out all the brothers
[1:28:00] that's for you Brothers right we need to
[1:28:01] love our wives like it's a
[1:28:03] honeymoon
[1:28:05] Hallelujah we should never forget to
[1:28:07] honor each other always be sweethearts
[1:28:10] never let it
[1:28:11] cease see there's quotes on both sides
[1:28:14] right brother man wasn't always
[1:28:15] preaching against immoral women that's
[1:28:17] the main problem so that's why the
[1:28:19] majority of quotes are on that right but
[1:28:22] brother B also said I love all my
[1:28:23] sisters in Christ he says you're he says
[1:28:27] you're a helpmate to your husband you're
[1:28:29] you're doing the right thing and he
[1:28:30] saids stay in your position but he was
[1:28:32] preaching against that Jezebel spirit
[1:28:34] today right it's on the men preachers
[1:28:37] it's on the churches it's on women right
[1:28:39] it's it's all over the majority of
[1:28:41] people miss the narrow road they go the
[1:28:44] broad road which leads to
[1:28:48] destruction a Catholic boy came to me
[1:28:50] not long ago he and his wife wife was
[1:28:52] separated he said Billy I hate to come
[1:28:54] to you I'm a Catholic and you a
[1:28:55] Protestant now notice did he turn him
[1:28:56] down because he's Catholic I can't help
[1:28:58] you because you're Catholic is that what
[1:28:59] he said no brother Bram had time to help
[1:29:02] Catholics with their
[1:29:03] marriages so should
[1:29:06] you Hallelujah is Nancy a Catholic
[1:29:08] brother okay I thought so that's why I
[1:29:10] was kind of on my
[1:29:13] mind said a priest run me out of my home
[1:29:16] a while ago I said what's the matter
[1:29:18] with him he said well he told me I drink
[1:29:20] a little and of a night I work hard so
[1:29:22] there's this excuse I work hard I need
[1:29:24] this devil I mean
[1:29:27] alcohol right I need this
[1:29:31] relief so making excuses well well Lord
[1:29:35] you know I've just got to do this
[1:29:37] because I'm tired no you don't have to
[1:29:39] do that Bible said if you wait on God he
[1:29:43] restores your strength like the eagle
[1:29:45] Hallelujah so he couldn't wait so he's
[1:29:47] like I got to have a bottle give me some
[1:29:50] alcohol Let Me Drown out the Sorrows of
[1:29:51] my day
[1:29:53] and the priest run him out now I'm never
[1:29:54] going to run you out of your house you
[1:29:57] by God's grace don't don't run me out of
[1:29:59] mine he says my wife thinks I ought to
[1:30:02] come in every night and kiss her and hug
[1:30:03] her and make it out like we was just
[1:30:05] fixing to get married said we married
[1:30:07] got a bunch of
[1:30:10] kids I said whoop wait a minute boy
[1:30:12] you're wrong that's just the same as it
[1:30:15] was before you're married in other words
[1:30:17] you need to act the same as when you got
[1:30:20] married you must always remember she's
[1:30:23] 40 years old now at the time when she
[1:30:25] really needs your
[1:30:27] attention so brother as you get older
[1:30:29] you got to give your wife more attention
[1:30:31] my wife is not and saying amen
[1:30:34] 41 Hallelujah is that isn't that awesome
[1:30:39] God go brother Taps into God's you know
[1:30:41] God's thoughts on these
[1:30:43] things so as you get older brothers when
[1:30:46] you're married you got to give your wife
[1:30:47] more
[1:30:48] attention right and you ought to she's
[1:30:51] part of you like you're helping yourself
[1:30:53] you're helping your family right you're
[1:30:55] this is my people right there's that
[1:30:57] phrase my people these are my people
[1:30:59] this who God gave me these are my
[1:31:01] gracious gifts I'm gonna take care of my
[1:31:03] gifts that God gave me amen if God gave
[1:31:06] them to me there's a reason he gave them
[1:31:07] to me Hallelujah I want to take care of
[1:31:10] them now here's some examples of uh wait
[1:31:13] now what I got after that oh yeah let's
[1:31:14] read these quotes I'm g go back to
[1:31:16] that he said Fellowship comes by
[1:31:20] love and love requires fellowship if you
[1:31:23] want to have Love in Your Homes you got
[1:31:25] to spend time together if you love your
[1:31:27] wife You' just got to get with her and
[1:31:29] talk with her if you love your friend
[1:31:31] you've got to get with him and talk with
[1:31:33] him and if you love God there's got to
[1:31:35] be a basis for Fellowship you cannot
[1:31:36] have fellowship and livelihood without
[1:31:38] these agreements you cannot be married
[1:31:40] without an agreement you cannot have a
[1:31:42] wife without some kind of agreement and
[1:31:43] that agreement is based upon your vow
[1:31:47] your
[1:31:48] promises and that that's that's the
[1:31:50] danger of all these teenagers is trying
[1:31:52] to date in the message in the
[1:31:55] message I didn't ask them but I was
[1:31:56] going to ask ly Malachi how many of that
[1:31:59] just if you give me a ballpark
[1:32:01] percentage how many of that group of
[1:32:02] teens want to date what what would your
[1:32:04] percentage be okay so 99 well not you
[1:32:11] 999 so think about that these are people
[1:32:13] that are supposed to be raised in
[1:32:14] godliness and Holiness in other words I
[1:32:17] won't love you that that that that girl
[1:32:20] to say first shame on you go talk to my
[1:32:21] dad right that's what she should have
[1:32:23] said first then she says I'm not going
[1:32:25] to try to even accept your love until
[1:32:27] you promise me you will love me when I
[1:32:30] turn
[1:32:31] 40 and 50 and
[1:32:35] 60 all the way
[1:32:37] up but see today people they want
[1:32:40] pleasure before the promise promise
[1:32:42] comes
[1:32:43] first promise me first then we'll have
[1:32:46] pleasure right then we'll have all the
[1:32:49] enjoyments of marriage but see they want
[1:32:51] want pleasure before they'll make a
[1:32:53] promise shame on
[1:32:55] them now and this is what I kind of told
[1:32:57] my children and yet these same preachers
[1:32:59] that go to those things will say we've
[1:33:00] got the greatest youth group of all
[1:33:04] time that won't wait on God that want a
[1:33:06] day I'm sorry that don't
[1:33:08] qualify that doesn't speak of greatness
[1:33:11] greatness is obeying the word of God yes
[1:33:14] I'm going to show you the shunamite was
[1:33:15] a great woman the Bible said she was a
[1:33:16] great woman you know why because she
[1:33:18] made a house for Elisha she saw this man
[1:33:21] of God Minister and walk she's like
[1:33:23] hubby let's build this guy a
[1:33:25] house and the Bible said she was a great
[1:33:27] woman because she wanted a place for the
[1:33:29] prophet to
[1:33:30] rest Hallelujah just as simple I just
[1:33:34] want him to have a little easier
[1:33:36] life goodness and the Bible calls her a
[1:33:39] great woman how can we make the
[1:33:41] prophet's life a little easier let's do
[1:33:44] it hubby so they do Hallelujah and God
[1:33:48] said it's a great woman reminds me of
[1:33:50] Jesus I I I've hardly seen such great
[1:33:53] faith I haven't seen great faith in all
[1:33:54] of Israel
[1:33:56] amen somebody that just believes the
[1:33:58] word and will speak the word of God and
[1:34:00] doesn't need God to move everything or
[1:34:02] do every go anywhere just speak the word

[1:34:07] give me the word of God just give me the
[1:34:08] spoken word of God and I'll believe it

[1:34:24] tell her she's the best cook in the
[1:34:25] country I always tell my wife that
[1:34:28] that's how she knows I love her not
[1:34:31] really she likes the fellowship part all
[1:34:34] the things that you know and how pretty
[1:34:36] she is how much you love her if you
[1:34:38] don't do that she'll never know it
[1:34:41] that's the way if you do love her you
[1:34:43] express
[1:34:45] it that's the way we do
[1:34:47] God see I loved it when I'm when I'm
[1:34:49] leading songs or amen's leading songs
[1:34:51] I'm sure we just love to hear the people
[1:34:53] sing from their hearts I like when the
[1:34:55] people sing louder than me I like that
[1:34:58] do you brother Hallelujah I like when we
[1:35:01] all can just en adore Jesus and give him
[1:35:05] praise and just take a few minutes and
[1:35:07] tell him how much we love him hallelujah
[1:35:09] amen worship him see love drives you to
[1:35:14] that right you got to when you really
[1:35:17] love somebody it'll drive you to go out
[1:35:18] of your way to express a little bit of
[1:35:20] love for them
[1:35:23] that's why you know years ago my wife
[1:35:25] and I might remember people say oh don't
[1:35:27] have birthday parties it's sinful don't
[1:35:28] have birthday parties uh Herod had
[1:35:29] birthday parties I don't know if you
[1:35:30] remember this I was like you know and I
[1:35:33] was like well what's wrong with one
[1:35:35] taking one day out of the year to say
[1:35:36] hey I love you I really love you brother
[1:35:41] thank you I love if you weren't here I'd
[1:35:43] be sad right and let alone God's
[1:35:46] gracious gifts to you what's wrong with
[1:35:50] that
[1:35:52] and now it looks so scriptural don't it
[1:35:54] well the only person in the Bible that
[1:35:55] had a birthday party was a sin that's
[1:35:57] true that's true but the Bible says to
[1:36:00] the pure all things are
[1:36:03] pure right and the Bible said the logos
[1:36:06] dance before the Lord he was just
[1:36:08] rejoicing always before the Lord right
[1:36:11] so father and son happy times
[1:36:15] amen hallelujah didn't Jacob give Joseph
[1:36:18] A a rainbow coat of many colors I love
[1:36:21] you son now would have been better if he
[1:36:23] didn't favor him we can kind of see why
[1:36:25] he favored him you know some of his
[1:36:27] other Sons were some Rascals sleeping
[1:36:30] around and doing some murders and all
[1:36:31] kinds of things no wonder he favored him
[1:36:33] but with the real Christian
[1:36:35] family that Daddy ought to do that to
[1:36:37] all of his children right like I told my
[1:36:40] kids they're all going to get a a cell
[1:36:41] phone when they can drive you know
[1:36:43] that's gonna be my gift to them you
[1:36:45] know when they get a certain age you
[1:36:47] know that's when you get this and that
[1:36:49] try to treat them all the Same by the
[1:36:51] ground God's
[1:36:53] grace see love will drive us to express
[1:36:57] our love to our
[1:37:00] family okay um how am I doing okay
[1:37:03] almost at an hour all right now brother
[1:37:05] BR says when when your wife gets in
[1:37:07] menopause he
[1:37:09] says he said perhaps it's your nerve
[1:37:11] sisters when they get into menopause he
[1:37:13] said it's a woman here might be in
[1:37:14] menopause time that's when everything is
[1:37:16] wrong with her and there's nothing wrong
[1:37:18] with her yet everything is wrong with
[1:37:19] her and she's not just putting on she
[1:37:20] really feels that it's just as real any
[1:37:23] person that's nervous is that way and
[1:37:25] don't never disagree and you husbands to
[1:37:28] your wives when they're in that time of
[1:37:30] life if she ever was your sweetheart you
[1:37:33] let her be right then because she needs
[1:37:35] you so see Church there's going to be
[1:37:37] times in our life we got to be ready to
[1:37:39] love at all times I'm talking to the men
[1:37:41] right I'm start with the men because
[1:37:43] you're the leader you're the
[1:37:45] fighter Hallelujah but Satan's going to
[1:37:47] attack you the most to not be a leader
[1:37:49] to not be a fighter he's going to attack
[1:37:51] you to be too
[1:37:53] passive right and not command like you
[1:37:55] ought to and not do justice and judgment
[1:37:58] like you ought to and give it to
[1:37:59] somebody else right wife or whatever
[1:38:02] Church whatever you
[1:38:04] know she needs you she really needs your
[1:38:06] help she needs somebody to help her and
[1:38:08] understand her talk to her take her up
[1:38:10] in your arms like she was your
[1:38:12] sweetheart and she should be and
[1:38:15] understand her because she's going
[1:38:16] through a time that her entire makeup is
[1:38:19] changing hormones right and you must be
[1:38:22] good to her at that time how many people
[1:38:26] have said you're just weak you need a
[1:38:27] you need a Revival you need they might
[1:38:30] criticize a woman going through that
[1:38:32] it's a change of life and men go through
[1:38:34] it too we're gonna have brother Brooks
[1:38:36] here in a few months I can ask him my
[1:38:37] brother can you preach on the change of
[1:38:38] life for
[1:38:40] men many men have done evil things in
[1:38:42] their change of life they've left their
[1:38:44] wives they've left their families
[1:38:46] because their hormones are
[1:38:48] changing right so this is a real thing
[1:38:50] and so what's brother r what's brother
[1:38:51] R's Revelation the Bible
[1:38:53] love choose to love Hallelujah husbands
[1:38:57] love your wives amen as Christ love the
[1:39:01] church I love it we got a real
[1:39:03] bible-based Prophet hallelujah amen
[1:39:06] thank you Jesus love her at that time as
[1:39:09] Ephesians 5:25
[1:39:11] says now notice this now as he comes
[1:39:14] over they come to the now this is a
[1:39:15] different
[1:39:16] quote but I'm talking about how every
[1:39:18] house has three rooms right kitchen uh
[1:39:22] he calls it the Parlor like the living
[1:39:24] room and then the
[1:39:26] bedroom he said see eat he said go in
[1:39:28] the kitchen eat that's that's your
[1:39:30] that's your first next go into your room
[1:39:31] to talk things over recognition making
[1:39:34] all your confession but then when you go
[1:39:36] into the bedroom it's when the married
[1:39:38] life is completed it's ready then life
[1:39:40] is for the little ones and so forth so
[1:39:43] he just gives a simple parallel there's
[1:39:45] eating fellowship and there's love right
[1:39:47] or life or uh
[1:39:49] intimacy and so so but you you got to go
[1:39:52] through all three brother say in other
[1:39:53] words you can't skip any of those you
[1:39:54] got to go through all three you got to
[1:39:56] be together as a family right eat you
[1:39:59] got to have the talk and the fellowship
[1:40:01] and you got to have the intimacy if you
[1:40:02] want a blessed home by God's grace
[1:40:06] Hallelujah all
[1:40:08] right now I'm going to pull off there uh
[1:40:10] the
[1:40:12] attachment everybody feeling good all
[1:40:16] right I'm at an hour right now my timer
[1:40:19] just went off okay all right okay I'm
[1:40:21] feeling pretty good by God's grace
[1:40:23] hopefully you are too you've been a good
[1:40:24] audience here by God's grace I want to
[1:40:26] preach this I don't know if I've ever
[1:40:27] preached this before here so I want to
[1:40:29] preach this uh you know some people are
[1:40:32] called to have children some people may
[1:40:34] not be called to have
[1:40:36] children so I've found this kind of in
[1:40:38] the scripture know in the beginning of
[1:40:40] the scripture God deals with Abraham uh
[1:40:43] and Sarah and talks about how they're
[1:40:44] going to have so many children and he
[1:40:46] said your children will be as the sand
[1:40:48] of the sea right and so there was such a
[1:40:52] burden on them like I think it was one
[1:40:54] of them uh Rachel said give me children
[1:40:56] or I'll die because they knew the
[1:40:58] promise of God right and God eventually
[1:41:01] gave her children but not everybody is
[1:41:03] called to have children you know I have
[1:41:04] family members and things and I'm sure
[1:41:06] some of you do too that they're married
[1:41:07] but they don't have children and so you
[1:41:09] wonder about that but as you see God is
[1:41:11] just a god of variety it's the general
[1:41:14] orders to have children right and it's a
[1:41:17] blessing of God but God has to have
[1:41:19] testimonies from every Walk of Life
[1:41:22] right God's got to have somebody
[1:41:23] overcome cancer or die with cancer and
[1:41:25] still have a Christian testimony
[1:41:27] somebody's God's got to have a family
[1:41:28] with lots of kids 20 right they used to
[1:41:31] some families used to have 20 children
[1:41:33] now that would be pretty hard for me
[1:41:36] I'll just say like that that'd be hard
[1:41:38] to have 20 kids in the
[1:41:40] 2024 with my life but I was called to
[1:41:43] have eight you know by God's grace but
[1:41:46] God has a variety God's going to call
[1:41:47] couples that may not have children just
[1:41:49] like God will call people to be married
[1:41:51] God will call people to be single God
[1:41:53] will call people to be Unix and never
[1:41:55] get married no have no desire so God's
[1:41:58] got to have a testimony in every area I
[1:42:01] found this I was thinking this morning
[1:42:02] you know it's in Luke 20 where the
[1:42:04] Pharisees talked about the woman who
[1:42:06] married seven brothers and she was
[1:42:08] childless she never had children but the
[1:42:10] question was uh who is uh which husband
[1:42:14] is going to she is she going to be
[1:42:15] husband too in the resurrection they're
[1:42:17] trying to trick Jesus and Jesus said
[1:42:19] though we're not giving him marriage in
[1:42:21] the
[1:42:22] resurrection
[1:42:24] right but notice Jesus never said this
[1:42:27] situation couldn't occur right if the if
[1:42:30] the if the Sadducees asked about it then
[1:42:33] there's probably likely something like
[1:42:34] that had happened before so think about
[1:42:36] that a woman married seven men and they
[1:42:38] could never have children and she died
[1:42:40] childless they all died childless but
[1:42:42] Jesus says there I'm going to read it I
[1:42:44] want you to notice what Jesus says Luke
[1:42:49] 20:31
[1:42:53] so I never had seen this thought here
[1:42:54] you know before so I want to preach this
[1:42:56] by God's grace
[1:43:02] 2031 and the third took her and in like
[1:43:04] matter the seven men also and they left
[1:43:07] no children and died last of all the
[1:43:09] woman died also so it said the men left
[1:43:12] no children so that's interesting there
[1:43:13] the thought there I may it was the men's
[1:43:16] bodies that couldn't reproduce last of
[1:43:19] all the woman died also verse 33
[1:43:20] therefore in the resurrection whose wife
[1:43:22] of them is she for seven had her a wife
[1:43:26] and Jesus answered said to them the
[1:43:27] children of this world marry and are
[1:43:29] given in
[1:43:30] marriage but they which shall be
[1:43:32] accounted worthy to obtain that world
[1:43:34] and the resurrection from the dead
[1:43:36] neither Mary nor given in marriage so I
[1:43:38] just want to lay this out here Jesus
[1:43:40] never says this this woman and these men
[1:43:42] couldn't be in the
[1:43:45] resurrection he says those that will be
[1:43:48] there will be counted Worthy and the
[1:43:50] church said in other words you honored
[1:43:53] God you loved God you kept the commands
[1:43:55] with all your heart soul might and
[1:43:56] strength and therefore Jesus said you'll
[1:43:59] walk with me in white because you are
[1:44:01] worthy you received the gift of
[1:44:03] Salvation then the rest of your life
[1:44:05] proved your gratitude for that gift of
[1:44:07] Salvation hallelujah oh amen now here's
[1:44:10] one I was mentioning earlier 2 Kings 4:8
[1:44:13] can you pull it up there and it fell on
[1:44:15] a day that Elisha passed to shunem where
[1:44:20] was a a great woman let's say great
[1:44:23] woman ready great woman in church this
[1:44:25] time she had no
[1:44:27] children and the Bible calls her a great
[1:44:30] woman Hallelujah this might be a good
[1:44:32] Mother's Day message I should have saved
[1:44:35] it for
[1:44:36] me but notice it caused her a great
[1:44:38] woman and she constrained him to eat
[1:44:40] bread and so it was that as often as he
[1:44:43] passed by he turned and thither to eat
[1:44:45] bread right and we we're familiar with
[1:44:47] the story she says H husband let's build
[1:44:50] build a a little place for him to rest I
[1:44:52] think I think they had a table in there
[1:44:54] and a bed and a chair I think that's all
[1:44:55] they had like a bed that's all they
[1:44:58] did and then Elisha goes up and says I'm
[1:45:01] going to give you something thus sayith
[1:45:02] the Lord uh the Bible says the f the man
[1:45:06] was too old to have children but she was
[1:45:08] younger but he says but he says thus
[1:45:10] sayi the Lord you'll have a child this
[1:45:12] time of year you'll Embrace a son and he
[1:45:15] come back later and she had a son but we
[1:45:17] know then later she was out in the field
[1:45:19] and he died
[1:45:21] right remember that but she said all is
[1:45:24] well the shunamite go get the prophet
[1:45:26] and the prophet laid on him you know
[1:45:28] face to face and he woke up and the
[1:45:31] resurrection there he's raised from the
[1:45:32] dead sneezed seven times and He restored
[1:45:35] the boy to the the woman but I want you
[1:45:36] to see the Bible called her a great
[1:45:38] woman before she had children but notice
[1:45:41] 2 Kings 4:28 then she said did I desire
[1:45:45] a son of my Lord this wasn't even a
[1:45:48] desire see because God had at that time
[1:45:51] had called them where they weren't
[1:45:52] called to have children right it was
[1:45:54] that wasn't their calling in life and
[1:45:56] it's really it looks like it wasn't even
[1:45:58] her desire to have him but the Bible
[1:46:00] called her a great woman Hallelujah that
[1:46:03] might make us scratch our heads a little
[1:46:05] bit right but it just shows God has a
[1:46:07] variety of
[1:46:09] Believers right did I not say Do not
[1:46:11] deceive
[1:46:12] me Hallelujah so see some some like this
[1:46:16] woman Jesus talked about some may live
[1:46:19] have seven husbands right and no child
[1:46:21] but they can still be counted worthy of
[1:46:23] the Resurrection other may be like this
[1:46:25] woman where it wasn't their desire God
[1:46:28] did not called them do that maybe she
[1:46:29] maybe she married him at a when he was
[1:46:31] old age and she was
[1:46:32] young right maybe he was a widower but
[1:46:35] she still wanted to be married and that
[1:46:36] was her opportunity to be married so see
[1:46:39] some are called to have children or no
[1:46:41] children others are called to have a
[1:46:43] testimony to seek children from the Lord
[1:46:45] like Hannah like
[1:46:47] Rachel right these women it was their
[1:46:50] that's their calling in life was to seek
[1:46:52] God and their promises were God said
[1:46:55] I'll make make the barren woman a happy
[1:46:57] woman who rejoices in her house with her
[1:46:59] children right you got Promises of that
[1:47:02] but you can also be a great woman for
[1:47:03] God hallelujah you can also be a great
[1:47:06] husband for god without having
[1:47:08] children so it's this great variety God
[1:47:11] gives us amen so I thought I'd preach
[1:47:13] that today I saw that oh that's
[1:47:14] interesting I saw that this morning in
[1:47:15] the
[1:47:16] scripture now let's I'm going to try to
[1:47:18] close with this here let's look at some
[1:47:21] responsibilities of the children I've
[1:47:22] talked about dads right I'm gonna jump
[1:47:24] ahead to the children because we've been
[1:47:26] talking about these youth meetings right
[1:47:28] and they said this last one they went to
[1:47:30] was the best youth youth meeting they
[1:47:31] they've had yet so that was good I was I
[1:47:34] was happy to hear that as a father I was
[1:47:35] happy to hear that by God's
[1:47:38] grace okay so Psalm 119 verse
[1:47:42] 9 got a few more scriptures by God's
[1:47:49] grace
[1:47:52] oh yeah I forgot about this one too yeah
[1:47:53] so
[1:47:56] uh yeah I guess I'll save that one about
[1:47:59] Hezekiah did you know Hezekiah this my
[1:48:01] wife shared this with me I didn't
[1:48:02] realize it but I looked it up too when
[1:48:04] Hezekiah was told he's going to die he
[1:48:05] had no son at that time he had no
[1:48:07] children well now that makes sense why
[1:48:10] he
[1:48:10] would Isaiah said thus say the Lord
[1:48:12] you're going to die what' he do he threw
[1:48:14] himself on the wall and cried and said
[1:48:15] God don't you remember I've served you
[1:48:17] with an honest heart well part of that
[1:48:19] was he had no son he's the king right
[1:48:22] and don't all dads want to see their
[1:48:24] children follow my steps maybe Malachi
[1:48:27] or Zion will be the pastor here one day
[1:48:28] you know that's that's my father's heart
[1:48:30] but it's not it's not my choice it's
[1:48:32] God's
[1:48:34] choice right it's nice if you're son but
[1:48:36] that it's not always the
[1:48:38] case but there's a father okay that's
[1:48:41] just like Hannah then that's just like
[1:48:42] Hannah there's a father throwing himself
[1:48:44] at the mercy of God and God said I'll
[1:48:46] give you 15 more years and he did have
[1:48:48] sons but they were real corrup corrupt I
[1:48:50] don't know if you ever read that
[1:48:52] hezekiah's Sons were real corrupt kind
[1:48:53] of like Samuel's
[1:48:56] Sons so remember look at that God
[1:48:58] honored his desire for the permissive
[1:49:00] will of God it would have been better
[1:49:03] for him to pass on without
[1:49:06] children I I'd never thought about that
[1:49:08] till right now actually as we're
[1:49:11] speaking here by God's grace preaching
[1:49:12] the word of God God would have said it
[1:49:14] would been better but then after God
[1:49:16] gave him the 15 years remember the Bible
[1:49:18] said he did not Render unto God what was
[1:49:20] given to him in other words he didn't he
[1:49:22] didn't do his part God blessed him and
[1:49:24] he should have been very grateful but he
[1:49:26] squandered it right by letting the
[1:49:28] Babylonian princes come in he showed he
[1:49:31] he showed all these Babylon princes all
[1:49:32] the blessings of God see that proves God
[1:49:35] church that proves God wants to hide his
[1:49:37] word from
[1:49:39] people
[1:49:41] right Jesus said Thank you Lord you've
[1:49:43] hidden these things from the wise and

[1:52:23] Glory all right I'm trying to finish up
[1:52:25] here
[1:52:29] Saints Psalm 119 verse 9 that's good for
[1:52:33] my teenagers here my little ones of
[1:52:34] course all of our little
[1:52:37] ones I tell you my I was a reminded this
[1:52:39] week the children are listening because
[1:52:40] Zion comes up
[1:52:43] and he said uh something about oh yeah I
[1:52:46] was saying the I said we had a mouse in
[1:52:48] our house last night I got him though
[1:52:51] but I said Zion he's stealing you know
[1:52:53] our food and he's digging into bags and
[1:52:55] stealing things and Zion said mice are
[1:52:58] an Abomination dad why would mice do an
[1:53:00] Abomination unto the Lord they just I
[1:53:02] said Abomination about 500 times last
[1:53:04] Sunday night by God's grace and the two
[1:53:06] weeks before he's like Daddy that's an
[1:53:08] Abomination I'm like you're exactly
[1:53:10] right that Mouse needs a
[1:53:13] die Judgment day today was Judgment
[1:53:17] Day I said he never asked to come in my
[1:53:20] house this my
[1:53:22] Dominion Psalm 119:9 so uh teenagers
[1:53:27] Beth Beth is the second Hebrew letter of
[1:53:29] the alphabet it means house or
[1:53:33] household so I think it's very fitting
[1:53:36] you know uh with the second letter
[1:53:37] meaning house or household it speaks of
[1:53:39] the
[1:53:39] youth right focusing on the what the
[1:53:42] youth should do in our
[1:53:44] houses where was shall a young man named
[1:53:47] Malachi cleanse his way
[1:53:51] one day I'll say
[1:53:53] James Andy Z how does a young man keep
[1:53:57] his way clean by taking heed that means
[1:54:01] watching guarding
[1:54:03] observing there to according to Thy Word
[1:54:07] in all your life you watch and you you
[1:54:09] guard your life with the word of God you
[1:54:12] guide your path with God's word you keep
[1:54:14] your your life
[1:54:15] clean by guarding it like Lydia and the
[1:54:18] girls were telling me at these youth of
[1:54:19] friend all these girl Lots I say maybe
[1:54:21] half of them are wearing makeup tight
[1:54:24] clothes message
[1:54:26] people did you see a few weeks ago we
[1:54:28] had some young people with makeup
[1:54:31] on in our church everybody see that I
[1:54:35] missed it but my children saw it I was
[1:54:37] all like just happy we had a guest
[1:54:38] preacher you I'm enjoying the word I
[1:54:41] missed it they had to let me
[1:54:43] know I was shocked afterwards I'm like
[1:54:45] how did I miss that brother
[1:54:47] B I'm just so happy you know
[1:54:50] thank God I get a day off I can just
[1:54:52] feed on the word of God I enjoy I enjoy
[1:54:53] it breaks
[1:54:57] too but this is how you keep a clean
[1:54:59] life you honor the word of God young
[1:55:08] man so that's what a clean life does it
[1:55:10] observes the word it guards the life it
[1:55:13] guards your life with the word of God I
[1:55:16] don't care what all my teenager friends
[1:55:17] are doing my life's going to be clean
[1:55:19] amen hallelujah my wife and I had it too
[1:55:22] you know when we first come to the
[1:55:23] message we were young people I was uh 21
[1:55:27] when I heard the message I was a young
[1:55:28] person then Lydia's 20 that's right okay
[1:55:31] Glory well some of my friends didn't
[1:55:33] live so holy they still watch some my
[1:55:34] friends watch movies and you know they
[1:55:38] would go to movie theaters and do all
[1:55:39] kinds of things well my wife and I
[1:55:41] didn't do that I was watching my I was
[1:55:44] surrounded by football players and they
[1:55:45] had money and they had all kinds of
[1:55:47] parties I could have went to all those
[1:55:48] things but I didn't by God's grace I
[1:55:51] went to a couple before I'm talking
[1:55:53] about after I was saved after I was
[1:55:54] saved I never went to any but after I
[1:55:57] heard the word of God I knew I've got to
[1:55:59] keep my way clean I probably didn't even
[1:56:00] know this scripture amen but I knew
[1:56:01] enough about God Amen that if God saved
[1:56:04] me he wants me to uh he wants me to live
[1:56:06] for him Hallelujah if God washed me in
[1:56:09] the blood he wants to keep me clean by
[1:56:10] the blood
[1:56:14] Hallelujah so here we get the full
[1:56:16] effect of a a clean life for a young
[1:56:19] person this is house Beth house so if I
[1:56:22] see if we see sister Beth next week
[1:56:24] we'll say hi sister
[1:56:26] household I'm glad you keep taking care
[1:56:28] of your house sister that's your name
[1:56:31] that's what it means in Hebrew hi sister
[1:56:33] household God bless
[1:56:38] you I'm trying to skip there quicker
[1:56:40] here yeah this is the longest chapter in
[1:56:41] the Bible Psalm
[1:56:43] 119 with my whole heart have I sought
[1:56:46] thee so see what these young people need
[1:56:47] to do they got to seek God with all all
[1:56:49] their hearts oh let me not Wonder from
[1:56:52] thy
[1:56:53] commands Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:56:55] that I might not sin against thee how's
[1:56:58] a young man keep his way clean let the
[1:57:01] word of God be in your heart and Desire
[1:57:03] with everything you've got to live pure
[1:57:05] before
[1:57:07] God right in Malachi saw all these guys
[1:57:10] that you know good friends and good good
[1:57:12] good guys around there some of them are
[1:57:13] doing girl
[1:57:15] chasing chasing girls yet they don't got
[1:57:17] a job don't got no money don't got a
[1:57:20] house in other words you ain't a
[1:57:23] man got no
[1:57:25] business trying to get a girl shame on
[1:57:30] them they've probably been taught better
[1:57:32] but see it's the lust of their eyes in
[1:57:35] church Satan always does it so gradually
[1:57:38] well this is okay you I'll just do a
[1:57:40] little bit here and if you keep that up
[1:57:43] pretty soon it turns into what is going
[1:57:45] on full out dating right we've seen it
[1:57:48] in the message we've seen it where uh
[1:57:51] boys and girls 12 and 15 years old 13
[1:57:54] and 15 will trade clothes they'll you
[1:57:56] know the girls want to wear the
[1:57:57] sweatshirt of the boy and talk on the
[1:57:58] phone all nights to the hour they get
[1:58:01] caught sneaking off together in the
[1:58:04] message that's sin that's not a clean
[1:58:08] way that they're walking the dirty way
[1:58:10] the Bible
[1:58:12] says you know what they need they need a
[1:58:14] dad who's got the Holy
[1:58:16] Ghost Hallelujah because the dad's
[1:58:18] responsible what kind of dad would let
[1:58:20] his girl wander off with the
[1:58:23] boy you don't got enough spiritual you
[1:58:26] don't got enough spiritual understanding
[1:58:27] to know that that boy don't he he hasn't
[1:58:30] done nothing to deserve to spend time
[1:58:31] with my daughter right he's not the head
[1:58:34] of my daughter I
[1:58:36] am I brought her in this world by God's

[1:59:04] testimonies as much as in all riches
[1:59:07] amen if you can say I'd rather hear the
[1:59:09] word of God or the word of God is more
[1:59:11] important to me than $10 million because
[1:59:13] of inflation right you used to say a
[1:59:14] million dollars but the word of God is
[1:59:16] more important to me than $10 million
[1:59:19] that's how a young man say and a young
[1:59:21] woman stays pure like that song says
[1:59:24] we're going to sing that one I'd rather
[1:59:25] have Jesus than men's Applause that's
[1:59:29] I'd rather be true to his dear cause
[1:59:32] Hallelujah than have worldwide Fame I'd
[1:59:35] rather be true to the Holy Name of Jesus
[1:59:38] Hallelujah that's a young man who's
[1:59:40] after the heart of God hallelujah that's
[1:59:42] what I was but I'm a middle-aged man
[1:59:44] amen still call myself a young
[1:59:47] man I will medit Med itate in thy
[1:59:49] precepts and have respect unto thy ways
[1:59:52] I will Delight myself in thy statutes I
[1:59:55] will not forget Thy
[1:59:57] word I'll I'll seek it first every day
[2:00:00] amen how do you how do you remember
[2:00:02] brother Jesse seek it every day
[2:00:05] Hallelujah remind myself Lord or Lord
[2:00:08] help me to remind myself of your
[2:00:10] promises like I told you I've so loved
[2:00:13] going through my old Bible transferring
[2:00:14] all my highlights to my new Bible
[2:00:16] because I get to see all these verses I
[2:00:18] forgot about I'm just overwhelmed I'm
[2:00:20] like my goodness this is talk about
[2:00:22] treasure Hallelujah these are precious
[2:00:25] and I think about down through my life
[2:00:27] so many of these verses were so
[2:00:29] important right when I needed them that
[2:00:32] verse directed my path amen hallelujah
[2:00:35] that verse guided me to the right choice
[2:00:37] Hallelujah so that's more precious than
[2:00:40] gold Hallelujah I could have fallen I
[2:00:42] could have made a mistake I could have
[2:00:44] went Shipwrecked but God's word was
[2:00:46] there to guide me his word was a lamp
[2:00:48] unto my my feet and a light into my path
[2:00:51] hallelujah
[2:00:56] amen Ecclesiastes 12 vers1 remember now
[2:01:00] thy Creator in the days of thy youth
[2:01:03] while the evil days come not like
[2:01:05] brother Phil right we kind of got that
[2:01:06] from his text like he was in the evil
[2:01:08] days it sound like he just wanted to
[2:01:10] passed away right and that's what we see
[2:01:11] with our loved ones sometimes they just
[2:01:13] they're ready to go home tough days
[2:01:16] remember Solomon talked about it it's
[2:01:17] like the lights are going out you know
[2:01:18] it's like you P the shades down and no
[2:01:20] matter what you put on your eyes you
[2:01:21] can't see nothing you're losing your
[2:01:24] eyesight he says nor the years draw nigh
[2:01:27] when thou shalt say I have no pleasure
[2:01:28] in
[2:01:30] them see it's our duty as parents re
[2:01:33] reme remind the children to remember
[2:01:39] God Ecclesiastes 12:13 let us hear the
[2:01:42] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[2:01:43] and keep his Commandments for this is
[2:01:45] the whole Duty or totality that's the
[2:01:48] word there
[2:01:49] in
[2:01:50] Hebrew the totality of man is to fear
[2:01:54] God and keep his commands for God shall
[2:01:56] bring every work into
[2:01:57] judgment with every secret thing whether
[2:02:00] it be good or whether it be
[2:02:02] bad Hallelujah so what is the chief goal
[2:02:05] of man what's the chief end of man to
[2:02:07] fear God and keep his commands remember
[2:02:10] God while you're young aren't you glad
[2:02:12] brother van we heard it when we were
[2:02:13] young think about I was think about you
[2:02:15] brother van think about how God has
[2:02:18] blessed your life because you received
[2:02:19] it when you're young van can think about
[2:02:21] some of his uncles you know even people
[2:02:24] in his family that made awful
[2:02:27] choices because they didn't have the
[2:02:28] message of the hour I was thinking about
[2:02:30] you brother bang on your birthday
[2:02:32] buddy he can see now he can look back
[2:02:35] he's 41 he can look back he can see wow
[2:02:37] God has protected me from this protected
[2:02:39] me from that God has guided all my
[2:02:42] paths he's directed all my steps and
[2:02:45] bang look look at him bless back there
[2:02:46] holding little Andy by God's grace how
[2:02:49] many want to hold Annie me I'm going
[2:02:51] first I want to enjoy that blessing back
[2:02:54] there I was kissing his little
[2:02:57] hand he's a blessed man amen hallelujah
[2:03:01] because he heard the word of God as a
[2:03:02] young man and when some of his family
[2:03:05] went thank God his family some of his
[2:03:07] family did but not all his family stood
[2:03:08] with him but he's able to take a stand
[2:03:11] on the word of God hallelujah as an
[2:03:13] example to the
[2:03:14] family
[2:03:16] Hallelujah I'm trying to close
[2:03:20] I'm close yeah I'm going to close with
[2:03:21] these last two here so last last two
[2:03:23] here Isaiah 335 and 6 I I read this this
[2:03:26] week and I thought oh my goodness how
[2:03:27] have I never preached this scripture
[2:03:31] before so Isaiah 33:5 the Lord is
[2:03:35] exalted that's Jehovah that capital L O
[2:03:37] R D the proper name of god Jehovah the
[2:03:41] Lord is exalted the proper name for he
[2:03:43] dwelleth on high he ha filled Zion with
[2:03:45] judgment and
[2:03:47] righteousness
[2:03:51] so see when God dwells in a place
[2:03:53] there's judgment and righteousness see
[2:03:55] that if God dwelling in
[2:03:57] Zion and judgment and righteousness is
[2:03:59] there then we can look at our lives is
[2:04:01] if God is dwelling in my house if God's
[2:04:03] dwelling with me then there's judgment
[2:04:05] and righteousness in my house judgment
[2:04:08] is again taking each case doing what's
[2:04:10] right and righteousness is then doing
[2:04:12] living that out righteousness you're
[2:04:14] doing what's
[2:04:15] right how do I know God's in my life
[2:04:18] because I'm judging things the right way
[2:04:19] each case I judge by the word and then I
[2:04:22] go and I I do what the what the case
[2:04:25] should should I carry out the the
[2:04:27] Judgment of the case I'll say like that
[2:04:28] I carry out the
[2:04:30] command Hallelujah now the one I want to
[2:04:32] read is six I've never seen this one
[2:04:34] it's been years since I've seen this but
[2:04:35] it was highlighted and wisdom and
[2:04:37] knowledge shall be the
[2:04:40] stability of thy times that jumped off
[2:04:43] the pages at me wow how many ever feel
[2:04:47] like you're living in an un uh an
[2:04:49] unstable time anybody feel like 2024 is
[2:04:52] kind of
[2:04:53] unstable I say the last four years have
[2:04:55] been pretty unstable everything was
[2:04:57] going good till
[2:05:00] 2020 but the Bible says if you're in
[2:05:03] a an uneasy time or a time of shaking
[2:05:07] time of shaking the Bible says if you
[2:05:09] want stability get wisdom and
[2:05:13] knowledge remember the Bible says that
[2:05:16] with all you're getting get wisdom in
[2:05:17] other words wisdom is doing what is
[2:05:19] right it's Sound Advice it's knowing
[2:05:21] what to do and when to do it right
[2:05:24] praise
[2:05:27] God knowing what to do and when to do it
[2:05:30] that's
[2:05:31] wisdom so what is it time to do now what
[2:05:34] should we be doing now the wisdom of God
[2:05:36] shows us what we should be doing now
[2:05:40] Hallelujah right like the wisdom of God
[2:05:42] showed us last year we should be dancing
[2:05:43] and we danced a lot last year we danced
[2:05:45] a little bit this year too I we needed
[2:05:48] that for that that time of our lives it
[2:05:51] shows us this is what should be
[2:05:54] done and also wisdom and knowledge is
[2:05:56] the strength of your salvation your
[2:05:59] deliverance right so wisdom and
[2:06:02] knowledge make you strong and bring
[2:06:03] Deliverance to you and I love this the
[2:06:07] fear of the Lord is your
[2:06:10] treasure right we talked about you know
[2:06:14] a young man must have wisdom and and
[2:06:15] that's greater than all riches right so
[2:06:17] we see a lap over we see the same idea
[2:06:19] here in other words you and I fearing
[2:06:21] God keeping his commands putting in
[2:06:24] first that is our treasure and that made
[2:06:27] me realize that's why I preach on that
[2:06:28] so many times put God first right honor
[2:06:31] God this last few months I found five or
[2:06:33] six verses where it says get up early
[2:06:35] seek God sing to God praise God I didn't
[2:06:38] even realize now till I read this that's
[2:06:41] what this is this is The Treasure of the
[2:06:43] believer worshiping God enjoying God in
[2:06:45] your home enjoying God in the church
[2:06:48] making God your treasure making God more
[2:06:50] valuable than all the riches of God this
[2:06:53] is the blessing of God's people
[2:06:54] hallelujah forgive
[2:06:57] me so what's the stability of your time
[2:07:00] what's the steadiness of your
[2:07:02] time what's the firmness that you stand
[2:07:04] on in in 2024 it's the wisdom and
[2:07:07] knowledge of God and Jesus Christ is
[2:07:09] wisdom
[2:07:10] personified right wisdom is personified
[2:07:14] as wisdom hath builded her house there's
[2:07:16] that feminine attribute right the father
[2:07:18] is like the masculine and the son is
[2:07:20] like the feminine the weaker element
[2:07:21] right so we see Christ is the wisdom of
[2:07:24] God Paul says that Christ is the wisdom
[2:07:26] of
[2:07:27] God I'll never forget Ben Gandy when he
[2:07:30] got out of prison we were over in that
[2:07:31] room there the where you had your
[2:07:33] wedding and where the food was we're in
[2:07:35] that room first time I talked to him we
[2:07:37] talked for like two hours and I said
[2:07:39] brother you know what are you hoping now
[2:07:41] what do you desire from God he said one
[2:07:43] word
[2:07:44] stability that has stayed with me
[2:07:46] brother all these years that was 2015
[2:07:49] eight years
[2:07:51] later think about that a man what's one
[2:07:53] thing if if man we could ask you one
[2:07:55] thing what what would you want and he
[2:07:56] said
[2:07:58] stability right what what's the Bible
[2:08:00] say your stability is the wisdom and
[2:08:03] knowledge of God see knowledge is
[2:08:06] knowing the word that's good but that's
[2:08:07] not enough we need the wisdom of God to
[2:08:09] do the word at the right time
[2:08:13] Hallelujah right and now we can learn we
[2:08:15] can learn from our brother right we can
[2:08:16] learn from brother
[2:08:17] Ben
[2:08:19] right the fruits of people's lives you
[2:08:21] can learn from
[2:08:23] that Hallelujah stability was the word I
[2:08:26] thought my and this was highlighted in
[2:08:28] my old Bible I preached out of it for 14
[2:08:32] years so Church in a time of a time of
[2:08:35] une easiness a time of shaking we need
[2:08:38] stability we need the wisdom and the
[2:08:39] knowledge of the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[2:08:42] how many can say Amen to that I know I'm
[2:08:44] going long here but hold on haven't even
[2:08:45] been I've been an hour and a half right
[2:08:46] now
[2:08:47] here last vers is uh Matthew 6:19 we'll
[2:08:50] close with this one
[2:08:51] here lay not up for yourselves Treasures
[2:08:54] upon the Earth where moth and rust doth
[2:08:57] corrupt and where th thieves break
[2:08:59] through and
[2:09:00] steal now one time I had a uh some
[2:09:02] friends that were married and had
[2:09:04] children and I think I shared this
[2:09:06] before with the church and they were
[2:09:07] very sweet and gracious but they said
[2:09:09] for about 10 years they felt they were
[2:09:10] out of the perfect will of God because
[2:09:12] they were just trying to get a nicer
[2:09:14] home like physically like make it more
[2:09:17] nice and modern but they said while they
[2:09:19] were doing spending all that time
[2:09:20] improving their home they left off on
[2:09:23] the Bible study time with their
[2:09:27] children okay so see that's it's a it's
[2:09:31] a very good application and thank God
[2:09:33] for God's correction because we can all
[2:09:34] go off track sometimes because you know
[2:09:38] we got to be careful brother man says
[2:09:39] make your home a real nice place where
[2:09:41] the children aren't afraid to bring
[2:09:42] their friends right so if people take
[2:09:45] that I don't know if that's what
[2:09:46] happened but some people take that the
[2:09:47] wrong way like who well I better Pony up
[2:09:49] I better take out some loans I better
[2:09:51] work hard I better work
[2:09:53] overtime to make my house super fancy
[2:09:59] modern get that new uh Playstation I
[2:10:02] don't know what they do I don't know
[2:10:04] Roku I don't know you understand just
[2:10:07] give me the latest technology give me
[2:10:08] the let's put all this money into it but
[2:10:11] because of the overfocused on the
[2:10:13] natural they forgot the most important
[2:10:17] thing
[2:10:18] the most important thing is diligently
[2:10:20] teaching your children the word of
[2:10:22] God
[2:10:24] hallelujah seeking God
[2:10:26] first and there that's what they told me
[2:10:29] so the perfect will of God would then be
[2:10:31] just put God first and that all these
[2:10:33] construction projects come at God's
[2:10:35] right time and
[2:10:37] season Hallelujah but don't use a
[2:10:40] project to to leave the word of God
[2:10:44] wisdom would tell you no that's wrong
[2:10:47] wrong timing if I gotta if I got to miss
[2:10:49] out on praising God something's wrong
[2:10:51] with my timing if God gets less in my
[2:10:53] heart less of my love then it ain't time
[2:10:55] for that Hallelujah and the church
[2:11:01] said Jesus said don't lay up Treasures
[2:11:03] here on
[2:11:04] Earth and I'm not you know I'm not
[2:11:06] condemning these people either I'm just
[2:11:07] saying like it just it was a real
[2:11:09] example of someone telling me I'm I'm in
[2:11:11] the per permissive will of God because
[2:11:13] of natural improvements I'm trying to
[2:11:15] make money and time and then leaving out
[2:11:18] the spiritual element to
[2:11:20] it
[2:11:24] Hallelujah verse 20 but lay up for
[2:11:26] yourselves Treasures in Heaven
[2:11:30] Hallelujah where neither moth nor rust
[2:11:32] doth
[2:11:33] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[2:11:37] through nor
[2:11:38] steal for where where your treasure is
[2:11:41] and that's the the treasure is the place
[2:11:43] in which good and precious things are
[2:11:46] collected and laid up
[2:11:50] if I could go in your house or your
[2:11:51] apartment today where would I find the
[2:11:53] treasure do you have like a safe would
[2:11:56] you let me look inside your safe some of
[2:11:58] you well what's inside there can I peek
[2:12:00] in here what Treasures are in
[2:12:02] here but
[2:12:04] really in a spiritual manner if I went
[2:12:06] to your home and I said let me see your
[2:12:08] Treasures you take out your
[2:12:09] Bible and you put it right by your heart
[2:12:12] and say the water baptism Jesus's blood
[2:12:16] the Holy Ghost this is my my treasure so
[2:12:19] where do you hide it in your heart
[2:12:22] Hallelujah now we all have natural
[2:12:24] things we got to take care of right guns
[2:12:26] or whatever we got you know savings
[2:12:29] bonds whatever you got but he said the
[2:12:32] greatest
[2:12:33] treasure Hallelujah is The Treasure of
[2:12:36] wisdom and knowledge being stable in
[2:12:39] these turbulent times Hallelujah the
