========================================

start the live stream now i have uh numerous slides here in maokai but then i'll get to a spot where i didn't have time to get all the slides the reason wasn't that i came across a new thought this morning i usually take sunday morning and put all the thoughts on uh slide somebody could see him but i came across a different thought so i had to kind of deal with that one but god is good and everybody loved the lord this morning amen amen amen just good to see everybody and good to be in the house the lord today by god's grace god is surely merciful to us and nature thanks for all those letters yesterday that was really good i just stacked them all up i said look at all these letters do you want everybody like a thank you letter it was really really kind so thank you that really made me feel good everybody felt real good so thank you um yeah so you know uh over the years i've you know i've had to deal with different topics and we ought to because we're we're the children of god and if anybody's going to get something right it's going to be the believers that's right because they're born again they've got the holy spirit the only way they would is that they had a complex like peter had a complex against the gentiles but then of course god straightens him out that's right and so for father's day i just you know just studying on this all week and i could see the father's hand in this you know because the father ordained the marriage between zipporah and moses brother brown said it was god's choice for moses that you know it was god ordained this marriage praise god and so i just want to start you know with these thoughts that we ended with on wednesday night you know god has a great number of thoughts about you because how many believe you're fearfully and wonderfully made amen amen hallelujah all of us are the bible says your body is a marvelous work of god now again we're not to get ourselves prideful like look how marvelous look how great i am no it's but it's to recognize that god has given you a special uh body he's given you a special existence you're higher above a bug you're higher above an animal praise god in the bible it says you are in the image of god amen the animals are not but you are in the resemblance amen that's what that word image means you are the resemblance of almighty god hallelujah amen and so god makes you this image and then after that he puts his spirit on you praise god to be more like him praise god that's right because we know there's billions of people that do not have the spirit of god on them but we are some of those uh blessed ones amen we're some of those children of god that have god's image physically but also his spiritual likeness hallelujah amen amen a very blessed chosen group if i say you're chosen elect hallelujah to have both god's image naturally and his spirit in you so you can resemble the very character and heart of god hallelujah amen now notice in your books everyone has a book about your life i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry in god's book my fault in god's book all your members so all all the details of your life were written before there was any of them so let's take that to moses and zephora god had already written that they were going to be married praise god god had ordained that now look at you god had ordained your life as well praise god hallelujah and then the bible said these thoughts of god are precious god's plan for our lives amen the things god is ordained for our lives these should be precious to us amen and it's a great amount of them it's a great sub in other words god has taken great consideration into each one of our lives he's considered this and he's considered that trial that we'd face and but yet he'd make a way that we could be overcomer same day he would work everything out for his glory he would make all the trials and all the obstacles and all the the the complexes and you know uh the the difficult portions of our life he'd make it all work out for his glory that we would love him more praise god amen amen because he cannot love us more amen hallelujah god cannot love you more amen god's got eternal love for you praise god but god wants us to love him for amen amen amen amen i told myself i was going to watch my voice because i about preached my voice out on wednesday night shouting all over the place screaming um david said if i would count them there's more than the numbers of sand the thoughts that god has about you and i skipping down here the bible says thy thoughts which are to us words so god has thoughts about us they can't be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they're more than can be numbered now we have a uh it's hard for us to imagine certain numbers like imagine a million what is a million how can you easily picture a million it's very hard to picture right i forget how many hairs are on our heads i forget you remember the number it was in the thousands i think it might have been twenty thousand or some hundred thousand something like that but that gives you an idea of all those hairs on our heads you know uh that gives us an idea now millions you know it's just hard for us to fathom a million billion trillion septillion like we saw the number of stars on wednesday night and just beyond our comprehension but whatever the number is of god's thoughts about us it's higher than we can imagine so we must understand god has every day planned out for our lives amen god has something he's doing with our lives and our relationships and god is going to work everything out for his glory you know we're going to get to some scriptures in a moment and we gotta always have to remember the balance you know god didn't promise us a flowery bed of ease amen he did promise us peace though praise god amen amen as we saw on wednesday night he did promise us all strength amen that's right amen unto so he did promise us that if we're able to accept it because that's the choice we have today and god has thoughts that are towards us thoughts of peace to give us an expected end so we know where we're going glory we know wherever ahead he amen and all god wants us to do in this process is to seek him amen and recognize that he has good thoughts toward us a good plan he's taking us somewhere he's taking us to be more like christ in the stature and the character of jesus christ and trust him and when we make time to seek him and and to to know him he will be found of us amen amen now remember church as we get into this thought about all the nations of the world god's eyes go through the whole earth everybody say whole earth and he's looking for those whose hearts are perfect toward him so he's not just singling out well i'm just going to go through america or i'm just going to go through uh south america or asia or australia he searches the whole earth amen god is looking for people around the whole world and he wants to show himself strong amen amen god wants strong believers in every nation hallelujah and peter said god does not respect persons god made all persons but he does not respect one more than the other he has great love to all of them and the bible says in every nation hallelujah he that fears god and works righteousness god accepts so it's man that draws national boundary lines not god god doesn't say well i can't pass here i won't pass there i'm a little nervous to go there a little scared to go there god doesn't look at any of those god is looking at the heart amen because he does not respect any persons that's the kind of god i serve amen i'm thankful to serve this kind of a holy god now father god loves all the creation of mankind he proved it because i love this because he shed his blood he was slain he was slaughtered he was beaten bloodied and bruised not just for one nation but for all nations and he said i know someone in every nation is going to believe me someone in every nation is going to serve me so i'm going to redeem some out of every nation and i'm making them kings and priests amen [Applause] every nation which means every color every shape every size amen because someone don't like our shape or size if someone don't like our noses you know some of us don't like different attributes about it but god god puts very little emphasis on that when he made jesus he had no beauty that we would desire lord when he made a son in his own image in his own character amen to express the heart of god he made him of no beauty and he made himself of no reputation amen such a humble servant a humble son so god's love and extends to every nation every kindred and then he finds those the bible says they're more noble there it is right there lord god finds that noble blood spiritual blood god finds that noble character amen those who like to seek god those who search the scriptures daily whether these things are so god finds that noble blood in every nation every tongue and he raises them up and makes them spiritual leaders amen not looking at the outside but looking at the inside looking at the motive and the objective of each individual praise god praise god hallelujah amen and remember this is a picture of who the bride of christ so jesus bride is going to be all different skin colors is that right is that right amen program calls it the bribe okay right the bride bouquet all kinds all colors right you know there's white people that have white albino hair did you know that so god's got like all white and then all black and everything on in between i've seen a picture of one today i'm looking online all the different pictures of all the skin colors in the world wow all right all black all the way and everything in between praise god god loves it he's a god of variety praise god remember esau was born a red hairy man how'd [Applause] so there's all shapes and and shades and and colors and god died for them all hallelujah amen and he might redeem some of all that's why he died amen amen remember god's love is so great jesus loved his own which were in the world and loved them until the end so we know god will love us to the end amen and there's nothing that can separate you and i from the love of christ there's no trial or tribulation peril sword persecution famine nakedness uh but here's the bells yes god loves you so much so that's wonderful but don't forget he's got to let you be tested too that's right because he counts you like sheep and so that means in your distress that's when you must become sheep-like glory in the famine in the nakedness and the tribulation the sore in these trials that god allows that's where we got to manifest a sheep nature that's right that's right so other words if i don't have enough food i've got to be humble about it if god lets peril or dangers or sword and someone dies in our family i've got to be like a sheep about it is that right murder if it's a murder like mike mccloskey is one of the greatest examples he was shot by a cop but lived and yet he showed the mercy of god that police officer purposely shot him made him paralyzed in the back but yet when he saw the bible about true friends he said that police officer deserves forgiveness in the church amen amen amazing so see god love we always want to know god loves us but at the same time god is trying to create a character in us that's like christ amen so in all these things in sword and peril and persecution we must be like sheep and when we're like you then we're more than conquerors unto him that loved us amen death life angels principalities powers things present nor things that come nor height death any other creature shall be able to separate the numbers there's no devil there's no there's no fallen angel that can separate us from the love of christ amen no creature amen amen but you're going to have to be like a sheep and you have to suffer at times because god is writing a testimony for this flock can i say like that this god's making a testimony for his sheep hallelujah and how how long are we killed church how long are we going through testing all the day long all the day long now notice god i'm getting in this thought here god wants all men to be saved but he knows not all will be saved and i just love this you know aha was a man who probably was lost everything points to the fact that he was lost and went to hell but even when he humbled himself god took elijah aside as a prophet said can't you see that even the sinner can humble himself and because of this single act of humility i will not let the evil come upon him but i'll save it for the next generation for one simple act of church think about that how often should we humble ourselves this guy did it one time and god said i'll push it off to the next generation bye think about the mercy of god on you and i when we rep of our minor sins he had major sins yet god held off mercy for him in other words how much mercy is god giving to us amen hallelujah that was the logo that was a serve god amen and this man allowed heathen temples to be built right he let his wife murder the prophets murder nabal holy righteous man and yet god said because of that act of humility i will be merciful and i'll push the judgment off to the next generation we serve a gracious god i love when the lord descended moses saw he said lord put me in the cleft of the rock and he covered him with his hand right and the lord passed by he said he said he expressed he proclaimed the name of the lord the character and the character of god was merciful gracious long-suffering abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty in other words i'm going to deal justly with every person whoever wants mercy will have mercy whoever wants uh god whoever wants a rebellion god will give them rebellion but if people want to serve god if people want to be right with god god will make them right god will clear their slaves god will purge them of their sins and god will make them white as snow because he's merciful long suffering gracious now i brought this back last year by the way i don't know if you're here but were you here when i preached on uh the names of god i just did a short series i think i preached two sermons or three sermons i think that was wrong okay hallelujah but uh the bible said it was lord the lord god so when god descended down to moses he said i am jehovah elohim in other words i'm a self-existent strong one that's right glory so who is who is long-suffering who is merciful the self-existent strong god amen hallelujah amen because the lord the word lord of the capital or l-o-r-d is jehovah which means self-existent one who reveals himself that's what scofield summed it up as right okay so i love how god says that the lord god the self-existent strong one the jehovah elohim jehovah elohim merciful gracious the strong one self-existent i will be merciful to you praise god that's right hallelujah and he will forgive iniquity he'll clear the guilty praise god amen he forgives our sins hallelujah remember he visits the iniquity but he also visits the blessings amen of saints on to the next generation as well praise god hallelujah i must get past that now this is why i couldn't get all the thoughts because this thought came to me this morning i better understand esau now because the bible says the children jacob and esau not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of in the call jacob have i love esau have i hated i've always thought just god always you know and this is where i'm growing as a i'm growing as a christian too i used to think god would just hate esau just hated him like i don't like you but as i read all these scriptures i thought well how does that work with all the other verses that god wants everybody to be saved that has to include esau so as i research and look at different uh ministers and different writers they say like albert barnes for this just one example out of many he said this word hatred is not positive hatred but it's merely a less love or the withholding of the expression of affection and if you look up in the bible or if you look up in uh scholars they talk about the word hyperbole and the word hyperbole means a word it's a deliberate exaggeration to emphasize a point it's delivered so god on purpose is saying i've known jacob and esau before the foundational world jacob have i loved esau by hayden he's not saying he hates esau but he's saying because of esau's decisions i can't bless him like i'll bless jacob let me prove it to you god's using hyperbole here to show that god knows the the purpose from the beginning to the end god can't force esau to be saved god can't force jacob to be saved god has to allow them their own free more agency praise god so this is hyperbole because remember i've preached this numerous times over the last few years remember does god god it's thus saith the lord do i have any pleasure that the wicked should die god doesn't delight in wicked people dying that's why we should cry we when people die that are wicked we shouldn't be happy about that we should be sad doesn't god want ahab to turn from his ways didn't god want esau to change from his ways didn't god want judas is scared to turn from his waist pharaoh so see god is greed by sinners he's merciful but he has to deal with them according their choices they must reap whatever they sow and so god is emphasizing jacob about love in other words because of jacob's freemore agency i was able to pour out more blessings on him but i had to be against esau because esau was against me never understand amen stride means to bleed the lord said my spirit will not always strive with man he gave them 2 000 years before noah's flood to repent two thousand years old remember remember the gibby knights they had over 400 years to repent right jericho had over 400 years to repent god gave them space to repent like jezebel but they repented not amen now the giddy night give me nice divorce right but the other nations did not god gave huge windows of grace amen and god was pleading with them that's what he did for israel he said i'm prophet after prophet after prophet yet they stoned them they slew them they killed them and jesus says why can you why do you stone the very prophets i sent you thank god that we received a prophet amen hallelujah we don't stone brother random or try to silence him we listen to him praise god we listen to him point to the bible as we say praise the lord amen amen to determine the human side versus the prophetic side he said be very careful when you're listening that's right he cares that you care 63 of course we probably got that one memorized i love this one here's why god said i hate esau god has to recompense or pay back everyone according to their righteousness so david said i got paid back because i made righteous decisions that's called reaping and sowing now i love this verse 26 i love this with the merciful god will show himself merciful with the upright man will show i'm sorry they're right man that will show thyself upright see sometimes you wonder why did people have it so good or well part of it is because they treated god so good because they like that they they've respected the word of god so well they've honored the word of god amen so so now naturally because of god's spiritual laws they're going to reap good things because they plan on good things amen naturally i like 27 this is just a beautiful portion david by the holy spirit is writing this with the pure i will show myself pure but with the frower now here's esau that will show thyself unsavory throw word is one that was against god so because esau was a member he was because esau was against his parents he was against god esau said just despite my mom and dad i'm gonna go marry a woman outside of the faith and that made his mom say oh i just want to die oh god that jacob would marry a believer right the afflicted people thou will say but thy eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down okay now okay so we have this now here's here's another example of hyperbole did you ever read this and wonder about this jesus said if a man come to me and hate not his father now does god want you to hate your dad if he's not a christian does god really want you to hate your mother your wife your children brethren and sisters if they're not christians and then hate your own life also because god wants you to hate your life i mean god wants you to pray that you'll die no this is hyperbole the church said amen so now it's kind of coming together for me okay brother bang after all these years after 16 years of preaching another thing i'm finally good i'm starting to get this thought here i'm going in grace you know jacob i love esau i hate it but it wasn't the hatred we're talking about like that we would think it's just a lesser love that's right god had to be against him because he was against god but he still was he was he still blessed esau if you look at his lineage god still blessed him families and territories and lambs jesus his own words must be understood he's not telling us to hate our families but he's using hyperbole so we'll have a greater he's emphasizing a point you must love me more than family amen amen amen spiritual family is more important than natural family if your natural family is against the word and you're for the word then we should love those that are with the word more than our natural families amen amen he's not saying hate your dad because he's not a believer hate your mom hate your wife hate your husband because they're not a believer no he's not saying that he's emphasizing the love you need for me is so much greater than everything else in your life because in the very in the very same lifetime he said love your enemies well there he said hate them and then he says love them well can i hate and love at the same time no jesus said if you are upset with a person unjustly he says uh murder he says you're close to the hellfire she says i'm just kind of quoting that i'm misquoting that but not exact quote right in other words if you think evil against someone without a cause you're in danger of hellfire there it is he said your nature hellfire okay so now does jacob and esau make a little more sense god was merciful god was just emphasizing jacob is going to love me more i've already seen his works i've already seen that he's gonna want the birth right more than food amen he's gonna want the spiritual connection the messiah more than natural food and health and prosperity he'll want spiritual blessings more than natural blessings amen write a father's day message look even jesus was kind to judas and he called him friend the satan filled son of perdition he called his friend he's kind and long suffering now i want to begin now looking at this subject here because god chooses interracial marriages now i'm not going to spend a lot of time now here's where i'm going to knock out here uh switch off of my computer and go to the regular scriptures this is where i didn't have enough time to put all these thoughts on uh the slide show so forgive me uh like i said this that thought about esau came to me this morning so i had to study that out and hope that was a blessing by god's grace now you and i understand that we have to take brother graham's words and take them back to the bible but not everybody does right now i have 52 statements that cannot be thus saith the lord and jose's helped me find some of them right brother branham said elisha was on mount transfiguration but it wasn't elisha it was elijah the 80 your body's made of 80 water and petroleum if you drink any petroleum you'll probably die that's how toxic it is so it's a slip of the tongue or slip of understanding like you know you we we know we know better but there are there's what i call i call them either they're either got awful complexes or they're tape worshipers people that make the tapes infallible they're either not saved and they reprobate mine because they love the spirit of idolatry or two they're saved but not born again because they won't be led into more truth or they are born again but they're an awful simple men i'm sorry awful sinful mental complex like brother and said i'm haunted i'm haunted by my conflicts about criticizing people sins don't make you feel good sins make you feel awful if we're really sincere our sins or complexes should make us feel bad it's a it's an awful spiritual state to be in and yet would god still use your gifts yes god as a preacher i know that romans said i come to the pulpit with a uh a bad spirit i'm haunted by my critical spirit so have i come to the pulpit where i don't necessarily feel good i'm battling things in my mind or i'm battling things in my body and you know i'll still preach i'll still yield and god will answer people's prayers and people say i really enjoyed that service i'm like well i was just trying to make it through the service right i mean we all experienced that at times god uses us despite our shortcomings i'm glad and see when people don't do this they're not doing what brother said prove all things by the bible where brother adam get that from the bible so ultimately they're against the bible but i don't need to spend a lot of time on that um because our church is taught in the word of god so i thank the lord for that um now with this idea on mixed uh mixed marriages and interracial marriages i found two observations brother graham never said thus say to the lord regarding this right and he rarely if ever i still haven't i've been searching this these last three four days i still haven't found a bible verse that he gave about it but of course we know he was against us so we'll try to show the balance on that as well and i believe the reason he was against it was because of the cultural violence that was going on in america i don't know how deeply some of us have studied the civil rights movement i'm going to show you some slides a little bit america was i mean still is but america was a very uh uh hateful place to live in many places not every place but in the big cities kind of like it is today right cities are usually the most awful place for sid right because that's what satan did that's what cain did right he went built or he's a vagabond but his descendants built cities and that's where he had the murders and that's where we have uh the center of culture wicked music look at every you know everything you know everything wicked in those cities and where'd you find god out there on those shepherders out there with the sheep baby he's got a prophet out there i need moses with the sheep amen just hang out there over the sheet maybe he's got david out there with the sheep singing songs glorifying god because all creation glorifies the name of the lord amen amen you can be closer to god with sheep dirty smelling sheep than you can with a big city bunch of sinners oh glory amen thank god if you feel more holy with sheep that's right now here's the reason so the reason i think brother man was against it was the main reason was it was illegal united states to have interracial marriages it was illegal can you imagine that it was illegal until 1967 two years after he died and i have a quote where brother adam says it so i'm gonna read that here for you brother ram said the boss the government said let it be what it is permit them to marry and so forth i said that's up to them as an american he said i abide by the laws to me you ought to leave it the way god made it he made white men black men brown men he's a god of variety let them stay the way god made them they talked about if i was a black man i'd want to stay in my class of people if i was chinese yellow i'm going to stay that way he said being that i'm anglo-saxon white let me marry amongst the white teach my children the same and just stay the kind of flower and the color that god made us at the beginning after all he's the one that made it okay so this was in 1962 so five years before the law was changed all right okay so that's just i want to just start with that one that's my honest uh thought now some people say well you should take brother branham's opinion above your own well i would say only if it's in the bible because the bible never told me to take every human opinion of a prophet above anybody else's to see how they put pressure on you like what do you mean your opinion is better than prophet well the bible never said to take every opinion above a prophet if i do that then like brother you told me on wednesday night then i'm gonna take nathan's opinion that's okay for david to build the house of god how about i take that opinion you see how you see how insane they are when you really think about it compared to scripture they are insane they're worshiping brother branham and that's of the devil but we're taking brother back to the word just like everybody should do because we love jesus christ he's the absolute praise god amen or how about elijah he's the only one he's the only prophet left i'll just take his opinion above god's no god said there's seven thousand i'm gonna take god's opinion praise god you see so you could take all those i'll take moses opinion yeah the israel they are a bunch of rebels god said no god said i see them they're like a unicorn they're like this powerful horse you know they're my people because they're bought by the blood well no you got to take a prophet's word above your own opinion i won't do that because the bible doesn't say to do that and i don't care what anybody says about me let them worship brother i only worship jesus christ amen but i still love them and i also pray for them amen but see they can't they won't love me back right that proves who has the love of god amen but listen if you really got the love of god people will draw you out of their circle but you draw them back in amen that's why i say that's why i say this thing i believe some of them can be born again and yet they got the wrong idea on interracial marriage but they've got an awful sinful complex see what i'm saying because peter had an awful one when he wouldn't even eat with gentiles now we don't know how far that went church we don't know how far that went but he was able to be corrected so a real child of god will be able to be corrected on their complexes right that's right and i've still got to write now just so you know i said this and uh the point i still got to write letters to these preachers that are saying these things i still haven't done that this summer we've had just you know my wife was sick that first week then we're on vacation and now we had this you know lost in our life so it's just been already a busy busy summer okay so uh we have those thoughts and it's actually caught like behavior to never question the leader of the group that's a call when you cannot question or ask the leader any questions and you have to just believe them uh blind faith that's a cult that's right that's right jesus christ is the only one who we should believe without any questions amen that's right even then we wonder if things so we pray he reveals it to us or we gotta wait to get the revelation that's right that's why there are cults around the message because they worship brother branham and they're they're evil people they're simple people they need help they need deliverance they need honesty they need the spirit of truth amen that's right they've loved the lie they worshipped the lord we're not of that type because we've got the holy spirit here by god's grace and he is the spirit of truth hallelujah amen now let's get your bibles ready let's get some real good doctrine deuteronomy 7 verse 1 deuteronomy 7 verse 1. church if you're turning there let me get there and then well deuteronomy 7 verse 1. okay let's pretend well i could even use austin or lena or anybody or even myself before we came to the message when we thought about interracial marriage did we think good or bad we thought okay right austin before i was in the message i didn't receive the message that i was 21. now was i uncomfortable with it yes because i was raised in a white area i didn't know one black person until i got to college right i was so isolated because we were poor that's why because we could we didn't have any money to travel we were dirt poor well maybe not dirt floor but pretty close to poor it was when i went to akron and had all these black and asian it was all new to me because all i knew was white farm people i thought i laughed at it now but that i was sheltered i was the one that was being made fun of for being multiracial i was the minority being name called me and then when i went around real minorities i was just i didn't know how to handle myself it was just try to be humble try to learn because they're just uh whenever you're in a new situation don't get nervous how about lena when you moved to ohio was it different than arizona yeah better in some ways not as good in other ways you know it's just a new new environment right but the point i'm making is that had we not when we didn't know program's stance on it we thought it was okay it was just different we you know i'm just uncomfortable because i never knew anybody from any other different uh background than just white and really the only one i knew was actually spanish because my side so when i would go to family gatherings they would talk spanish and sometimes then sometimes english i would just try to you know mainly my grandparents all spoke spanish most of the time that was on my mom's side and so i was just i was just always a little uncomfortable there i didn't know if my grandfather was happy or sad sometimes you can't tell them the words they're saying you know but i know i know they love me you know i know they express love to me but even growing up i was the minority in fact i'll just say like this this is the one where people don't get mad if you say but my brothers and i because we were darker and and mexican they called a that's a really awful name that's a slur name are those have you ever heard that before yeah we were called that growing up i was even called the n-word because i was so dark i get really dark in the summertime i look at maokai maokai's been out well you have to see his arms later i just spent all summer out of the sun so i mean i look i look real dumb i was called the n word and i would go home crying so i was the minority as a mexican i was the minority in a white community i was made not by everybody just there were just these one a couple of evil kids that would do it and so i would go home and cry my parents would see me cry why are you crying well they called me the n word it was because during basketball for the austin i was blocking their shots and i was rebounding i was scoring i was better than some of these guys at basketball so they called me the n-word and so my dad didn't know how to handle it my dad made a joke out of all the problems so my dad said well you're my only black son jesse that's what he would tell me and he was we were laughing about it he just said well you're alone my only black son so i said okay dad i just kind of learned to live with it well it stopped after a few years you know i didn't get it too bad after that but i'm just trying to let you understand like i was raised in an environment where i was the minority and with not knowing the message of brother branham i thought it would marriage interracial marriage was okay because i didn't know anything wrong with it if you just read the bible you don't see anything wrong with it i'm going to say it again in case the people online missed it if you just read the bible you never see anything wrong with it right because the word race is only in the bible four times and it's not talking about ethnic groups it's talking about running a physical race race is a newer modern type of word for ethnicity the real bible words aren't nation that's the real bible word nation because god separated them after tower of babel he suffered them into nations okay now verse 1 when the lord thy god shall bring in the land which thou goest to possess it and has cast away many nations before thee and look the hittites the gergeshites the amorites and the canaanites and notice what are they called nations and the parasites and the divines and the jebusites seven nations greater mighty than that but on the verse three neither shalt thou make any marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son nor his daughter shalt thou take to thy son why why because they were different no actually they were the their neighbors were the exact same skin color as them they're all middle easterners right so they have the same they they all look the same they got darker skin usually black hair right middle easterners think about that iraq syrians you know israelites egyptians they all have the darker skin color right the it's kind of like middle dark black hair brother says that brother says all all the easterners have the dark skin he calls it dark eyes why can't you marry verse 4 for they will turn away thy son from following me amen so god forbid nations that looked alike he forbid them for marion why because of the spiritual influence your spouse will have on you that's why god said the main thing to worry about when getting married is the spiritual influence it's not so much physical it's spiritual that has nothing new physical really nothing physical it's all spiritual okay i'm going to go to joshua 23 12. 23 12 and 13. we'll just read 12 though for time's sake so these are the first times god is saying don't marry don't marry and he's saying it's not because of physical it's because of spiritual if you've just read the bible this is the conclusion you come to but we've got a lot of people around the message that don't want to read the bible shame shame on them brother man's whole message was to restore the apostolic doctrine the faith of the fathers and yes the power amen the same power same doctrine same authority same life same spirit same truth it's all restored by the spirit of elijah amen that's what it's done to our church amen glory joshua 23 12. else if you do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these what nation not racist because that's a modern word it's nations even these that remain among you and you shall make marriages with them and going unto them and they to you no for a certainty the lord thy god will no more drive out any of these nations from before you see because these nations and their idols and their sin that was a snare had nothing to do with the physical it was all about the spiritual influence what is this husband is this husband gonna point you more to christ or point you to the world is this wife gonna point you to jesus christ or try to persuade you to leave that's what god was interested in not physical but spiritual the church said amen so i can find there's three requirements for marriage the first one is you have to marry a believer and brother said that no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstance should always marry believers that's right okay that was 1960 i'm sorry 1959 be certain of god this is true for old testament new testament i just showed you old testament now the new testament malachi people first corinthians 7 39 this is familiar to us but just so you can see it so a believer can marry any believer as long as they're led of the holy spirit uh and it doesn't matter the nation it matters the faith okay so this is the spiritual nation there it is doesn't matter what physical nation you come from it's the spiritual nation the spiritual priesthood hallelujah amen that's right glory bible calls is a holy nation glory okay so there it is uh the wife here's a wife her husband's died uh if her husband's dead she's a liberty to mary to whom she will only in the lord now if paul ever wanted to say don't marry don't marry a different nation this would have been the time to do it but he says only in the lord only marry a believer praise god okay hallelujah now the second one is uh in the new testament the believer could know could not have a living spouse or else it's adultery matthew 5 32 the type you guys going to be busy for a few moments here matthew 5 32 jesus says whosoever puts away his wife safe for the cause of fornication that's like joseph and mary right joseph thought she'd already had fornication was going to put her away of course she didn't because causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that's divorced cometh adultery now in the old testament though you could divorce and remarry with the living spouse but but jesus said that was because of the hardness of their hearts just so you know that was the old testament you probably know that yeah i'm just showing you so a christian has to marry a believer and it can have no living spouse and the third one you must have an honest bow this is important in both the old testament new testament we're not going to read it but numbers 30 verses 1 to 16 talks about all the vows the couple before they're married they have to go through the dads right that's it make sure the vows are honest and everything and then go to uh matthew 19 9 matthew 19 9. this is the great scripture on marriage and divorce along with matthew 5 32 of matthew 19 9 whosoever should put away his wife except be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever married her which is put awake nothing adultery so the new testament if a couple got married and the man found out the wife was dishonest with the vow after they were married he could put her away and marry another but church i would just plead with that man don't you love that woman enough to just stay married to her god hates divorce you'd be surprised i have people email me all the time well this happened at our church uh the woman didn't confess her fortification i said but don't the man love her hasn't she been good to him she's probably he's probably washed his clothes fed him she's probably bored children it's for many people it's an excuse just a lust after another woman absolutely but jesus gives the only way to do it right because we've all heard about it oh they just look for an opportunity because they're lustful and they forget about the fact that they forget about the fact that in the spiritual marriage they're unfaithful to their husband every day because that's why i advise everybody don't put her away even if she didn't confess it that'd be my advice if you want somebody to marry us and go somewhere else i can do it you took a vow you said death to your part i know the vow wasn't honest but pray about it god hates divorce one time in college i met a friend and uh i just come in the message and i learned about you know virginity and uh the importance of you know certain things and this this this friend of mine was gonna marry this girl you know i heard brother talk about you know a wife woman keeping her pure and wanting to marry you know things like that i just thought it was so i just thought thinking i was so beautiful i was a little more immature at that time and i said i said you know you're my friend but you know uh this this woman has like a past history wouldn't you want to have a woman that had no past history and he said i love her so much that i know god's forgiven her and i've forgiven her and i thought here's there i thought that's real love right there but see in my in my immature state i'm like well i'm listening to brother brown all the time but it's good but i just i never really thought outside of just just outside of these sermons i thought wow what a beautiful expression of love and really that man probably had sexual sin he committed right right brothers and so if we're not careful we become self-righteous but god doesn't like self-righteousness amen amen god loves humanity praise god and we've all fallen short of the glory of god amen amen jesus said if you lust in your heart you've already committed adultery well every guy is guilty of that every guy's an adulterer or a fornicator right that's right before marriage or you know whatever so you can make a case you know uh that we could if we want we can be self-righteous and condemn anybody but god the righteous one doesn't do that god expresses mercy amen hallelujah praise god god expresses grace he offers redemption hallelujah amen i wasn't actually planning on preaching on that but so there's only three requirements for marriage both believers no living spouse and then an honest vow but again if you love that person and even if they felt so pressured they lied wouldn't you want to forgive them god hates divorce i know god hates lying too but who hasn't lied who hasn't lied now marriage within nations or can i say races was possible with israel through proselyting or through spiritual conversions okay this is the beautiful part hallelujah glory even in the abrahamic covenant uh keep paul genesis 17 12 malachi god told abraham you i'm going to give you the covenant of circumcision and this is for all the men whether they're jew or gentile because you may get some slaves right you may get some uh uh 17-7 i'm sorry 17-12 sorry 17-12. he said you may get a sojourner and you got to circumcise those men anyway even the gentiles verse 12. you got it is it not working i can just read it okay it's not working okay uh genesis 17 12. oh there you go every man in your generations he that's born your house are bought with money of a stranger which is not of thy seed so any gentile you buy that comes in you've got to circumcise them well now gentiles are going to be in the abrahamic covenant so as long as they convert and as long as they're brought into your your house they gotta follow the covenant that's right okay go to numbers 19 10. this is about this i just want to preach on the waters of separation a few years ago that's a glorious revelation uh he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that so journalist among them for a statue forever remember if they contacted a dead person they could not come to the outer court they touch a dead person or was unclean in any other way everybody in order to get back into fellowship you had to be sprinkled with the waters of separation amen you had to be sprinkled and then wait seven days or three and a half days uh you gotta recognize your guilty wait uh you're unclean get sprinkle wait three and a half days uh then come back three and a half days later then you can come into the congregation praise god hallelujah and so any any any gentile in order to be brought into the faith could be brought in by the same way by the waters of separation that's right no verse by the blood of the lamb amen now from the time of abraham until solomon they had amassed over 153 600 gentiles i put that in my book that's in verse 2 chronicles 2 17 we don't have to read it now imagine that they start out all all jews but give it 500 years now they have a huge portion of their group 153 000 are now gentiles god and brother rabbit says in the church age book he says jezebel was not a daughter of abraham he said as her nor is her induction into the tribes of israel one of spiritual admission as that of ruth the moabitess okay so now we're going to start getting some examples here which i'm sure some of you are familiar with so jezebel did not come into the israel she only come in my marriage she didn't come in by the spiritual process amen she didn't know where she didn't get sprinkled with the waters of separation thank god you've been sprinkled with the waters of separation the blood of jesus christ amen you are brought into the covenant you have a part of the covenant you're heir to the promises of god amen amen in other words you inherit eternal life and a portion of eternal life amen because you've been sprinkled by the blood of jesus christ amen that's right that's how ruth was we'll get to ruth in a minute now i've got uh five examples of godly marriages between different nations or races and i want to remind you jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen i'm the lord thy god and i changed that the first one is joseph and asanav genesis 41 45 god and look at this god arranged an egyptian they were the most evil of all right they were the world power of the time the greatest heathens the enemy and god brings joseph to save the whole world and gives him a gentile life egyptian wife okay brother branham says notice he said joseph given a gentile wife and he bore gentile children half gentile half jew so ephraim and manassas were half breeds and the church said that's kind of a joke yeah that's a joke because i'm a half breed i'm one i'm a half a breed of uh english half a breed of mexican now i've got the dna to prove it i can prove it it's amazing brother they took my dna and they can go down to the very town where my grandparents were born wow and my grandparents don't even have a dna on their system but just because they match so many dnas of different people they can find my dna right to the very town that's the time my grandparents were born in without having any dna from my grandparents i'll tell you dna is powerful but there's more i got a lot more than that by god's rights later on half breed brotherhood said they're half jew half gentile now i just got to ask these questions because i'm going to get to some quotes from brother branham was it wrong for joseph's children to be half greed what do you think no because god ordained their marriage god joseph told his brothers god sent me to egypt amen you didn't send me here god sent me here amen in other words god sent him there and had a gentile wife preparing for her there oh god sent me here to save life so as an f would have been converted to become a jew right because god said never marry amongst an unbeliever praise god that's on the that's on the show too right uh i think nature said did you watch joseph thank you monsters okay yeah so yeah remember remember that on there do you remember when asked you become a believer you remember that yeah i haven't watched it too much that's why i'm asking you i just seen bits and pieces but at first she's like oh there's many gods and joseph's like there's one guy and then later she's like i love you joseph and there's one true god will you marry me no god god ordained it and then at church god took these two boys ibrahimovic half breeds and he gives them a place among the 12 tribes of israel and then god thought so much of these half reads brother william that two of those 24 seats up in heaven are reserved and he's half for eighteen men that's right i didn't even have praise god i'm using having freedom expression because that's what brother adam calls because that's because that's the culture that they were in there's a lot of pressure i'm gonna get that there's a lot of pressure on brother there's a lot of pressure on everybody at that time you know your race and your nationality was a huge thing in those days so see god bless joseph's marriage god ordained that's why the title is god ordains interracial marriages god ordains him at times and he blesses the sons they get they get huge portions of land half tribe of manasseh half of them are on the other side of jordan another half on the other side and it gives them two of the 24 seats around the throne second example moses and zephora we read this one earlier now what's interesting about zappora she was a ethiopian which means a cushite and cushite was the land that was the southernmost part in africa according to the lexicon it means from the most southern parts of the nile river which leads to ethiopia so zipporah is from is it central africa brother where's ethiopia look up ethiopia east east east africa northeast okay so northeast africa so god god finds a woman that he knows will be perfect for his prophet amen a prophet amen god said i need a woman for my prophet it wasn't going to be a hebrew woman it was going to be a cushion ethiopian woman see because it's not our choice church it's god's choice amen god's choosing amen and we either accept god's choice or we get rid of god's choice i'm going to accept god's choice for my life don't you we want to take god's choice god's ways are higher than our ways praise god god's thoughts are greater than our thoughts so zebora is interesting she was a ethiopian but living in the midianite region because her father was a midianite so midian was an area closer to israel so she must have been an immigrant right or she must have moved from ethiopia and now she's living in the midianite land which had a map that's one thing i forgot to get was a map that might help you but either way you don't understand the story moses was hebrew zipporah was ethiopian different nations no doubt different skin colors and god placed them together god stood up for this marriage amen god stood up for his prophet and his prophet's wife amen hallelujah don't you speak against them so see you know years ago when i was in the message when i first come i was i was going to the church in lima this interracial marriage issue became a big deal because one of my pastors children who was black married a white person and it created quite a stir because because of this people message people aren't always that spiritual and not all message people are born again it was a huge deal and i just studied out pray it out and i came to that conclusion god ordained this marriage moses is important god ordained it and i just told the people i said well i said i feel sorry for these people that are speaking against our church and you'd be surprised not not not even the whole church attended the wedding which really showed which side people are wrong it was really sad i mean it's happened one way i was happy for the couple another way i was sad but i came to that conclusion i just said god be merciful for them if they speak against it because then you're speaking against god right and that was that story i told you where a brother said i've got to go against uh a pastor and four of his uh or four other pastors and he called him giants so there was a minister in the message he's still alive but i emailed him about this last summer and he wasn't talking about me actually he was talking about my pastor and the other pastors in the area that supported interracial marriage and this this preacher he lives in texas the texas preacher was against these ohio creatures because they supported interracial marriage and he called himself david and he called the other preachers goliath and giants and this guy's got so much false documents he even said that jesus never carried his cross and he's right there in the bible i mean these people are just so they're just insane the problem is they're not born again the problem is they got hatred in their hearts or they got some bitterness or some pride or something like that they got to get they ought to clean out they ought to root out all the rich and fairness out of their life but that's what god revealed to me woe into them if they speak against it because god's going to fight against them that's right because what god do to disappoint i'm sorry what did god do to marry him god gave her leprosy right okay now i preached on support i think for mother's day didn't i last year i didn't look that up either i should look that up so god chose two different people moses and zipporah from different nationalities or races and brought them together okay while i'm here let me read the good quotes i mean they're all good quotes about moses and sephora they asked brother iran does the scripture mean that god aimed to kill moses for not circumcising his son and yet your brother said yes god was after moses and zipporah was the only one that saved him there so god said i know my prophet at some point is going to be disobedient i need a woman that will take some initiative and go out and obey the bible when her husband does it the church said right now i'm gonna say that again for our brothers god said i need to find a woman who even though her prophet husband isn't obeying the abrahamic covenant she will take initiative and she will go save his life and follow the covenant even when he won't i need a woman with some initiative to obey the word of god amen and the eyes of the lord brother the eyes of the lord went all through hebrew couldn't find anybody in hebrew went through all these lands and the eyes lord come down there to ethiopia there's a woman here's what here's the move that respects god amen she said thou art a bloody house underneath moses and she saved his life church hallelujah the eyes of the lord run to and fro about the earth so that god may show himself strong in every nation how come these guys don't preach that quote because they're not real believers but they got really they're they're in deep in sin but random said again he said was it moses made fun of by his sister and his brother the one time he married a colored girl ethiopian now colored is not the right expression anymore that's not politically correct so i'm sorry if that offends people i'm sorry for the defense people but that's how they talked about in america in the 1960s and 50s so i'm sorry every color is beautiful and really everybody wants to be darker right i mean darker well i shouldn't say that but yeah most people want to be darker right you know who doesn't like who doesn't like a nice tan it just looks beautiful but he said and did they make fun and god happened to be present and heard it was that right he was just present and heard it and he said god said bring them here don't you fear god knowing that i've seen what i've done for that man and showed him the favors see so his brother and sister needed something against moses so they said well he didn't marry a hebrew so let's use that so we can exalt ourselves we have gifts we've seen visions we've we've had dreams and god said don't you know that he's a prophet i'm speaking lift it here i said you just see dreams and visions but i speak lifting here to him that's right weren't you afraid to speak against the man of god for the marriage that i i set up praise god i set that up amen another quote said miriam showed her trespassing too when she laughed moses or laughed at because moses married this negro girl so negro negros again a word we don't use anymore i'm sorry that offends anybody but i'm just reading the quote okay and brother man said and they basically said wasn't there any other girls to be married and so forth god wasn't pleased with that and smote her with leprosy so see miriam was critical of moses and she wanted some of that power and authority so she found the only thing i can criticize moses for is her his marriage to someone who doesn't look like us and god said that's awful god gave her a leprosy but god healed her because of aaron's intercession moses intercession so that shows like miriam must have been the instigator behind it right because mo aaron didn't get the leprosy miranda pursuit she must have won she must been the one like the instigator really trying to find fault with god's prophet right here's what i like this is one of like respects 1961. one day miriam a prophetess and aaron the high priest made fun of moses white because she was ethiopian and they thought well wasn't there enough women of our own group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that's what they thought wasn't there a better person to marry why'd you have to marry out of our nation but said that wasn't moses's choice that was god's choice for moses amen who chose this interracial marriage god had amen who chose joseph's interracial marriage god did god sent [Applause] amen amen amen see how church we got the bible to stand by all the other side they just have arguments they just have quote wars but we don't have quote wars we're not interested in argument we're interested in love and the truth of god amen that points us back to the bible praise god never was popular and ever will be i'm not interested in popularity i'm interested in god's favor amen amen to have the right spirit to have the real love of jesus christ that's what i'm interested in are you two i know i gotta ask you they made fun of it what is choice for marriage and angered god in such a way till he struck miriam the prophetess with full of leprosy moses own sister what was she doing she was making fun and irreverence to god's messenger the messenger of the covenant to that day the very mouthpiece the mouthpiece of god that's right now church if you listen to unveiling of god in 1964 brother branham says in the millennium elohim will sit on the throne the self-existent one with all the subjects that he predestinated from the foundation of the world like a man building chimes like a chime is like a bell each bell's got a different ring from another the same materials but so much iron so much steel so much brass to give it the right team that's exactly what god did he bred this one to that one to that one to this one to that one until he got exactly what he wanted that's how he come down god veiled himself in a pillar of fire through down to the prophets then into the son of god which he was god see he's the same yesterday today and forever bringing out exactly from perfection of perfection from glory to glory that's the way the church goes amen glory amen in other words god needed uh god needed you and so god had your grandparents that grandparent that grandparent that grandparent this grandparent that grandparent he had to breed it all together to your parents coming together and then he got exactly what he wanted he got a person with the right nature right character that he can use and he can strike you and you'll bring forth the right sound amen you'll bring forward the right testimony like for me god had to make me an athlete right so god had my uncles were i guess amazing athletes i don't know most of them were short but i had one tall uncle roger and it looked like i got his height i'm way taller than all my other brothers why am i i don't know but god had to give me this certain bill they say uh they say my grandparents also have some indian blood in them well i don't know about that yet but they say i'd have a certain bill to look a certain way and that's why my dad would call me his only black son you know that's fine but i had to have this sport i had to jump jump high run fast god had to give me this athletic ability in order to bring me to akron in order to humble me get me saved and become a pastor praise god that was in god's book amen that was how precious are god's thoughts up to me praise god i'd be called names because i was darker and i had to be god all kinds of things i'd be mocked and made fun of mistreated but i got through it and now the grace of god is here and i will never repeat that instead of spreading hatred or division or competition i'll spread love amen amen we'll rejoice in every skin color yes we do hallelujah every skin color i told the girls out last year when i preached and i said every skin color is beautiful because god ordained it hallelujah everyone's beautiful i just i was just saying like there's a move today in fashion where people want to be darker you know then that's that's like a women's you know women want to be darker for some reason i like being darker too so i i can relate to that i don't like looking all pale like i'm tired i'm like looking darker just my opinion so those are all those are the positive quotes about moses and the poor all positive i can't find i can't find one negative point about moses and support now it's already 12 let's see i started preaching is it okay how long have i been preaching what's it say over an hour okay well let me just close with these thoughts and then in another service i'll get to uh more more of these thoughts rahab rahab was a canaanite and she married salmon who was a hebrew now the bible specifically forbid israel marin canaanites they could not marry them i already read one to you deuteronomy 7 verse 6 1-6 god said do not marry canaanites and then salmon said can i marry you say will you marry me right heaven it's because rahab was no longer a canaanite spiritually ahead she become a jew spiritually hallelujah she said i believe i receive those two spies i receive the messengers i believe i want the token i want the red scarlet card put that in my house let the blood be upon my house amen yes that's right so now she became a jew spiritual hallelujah and what god do out of that former harlot what did god do out of her god brought boaz out that's right which married ruth a moabite out of them came over out of orbit came jesse i like the ninjas and then out of jesse came david on the day becomes solomon eventually on to jesus christ jesse means wealthy so i thought well maybe not i mean kind of in this world compared to other countries you know but i want to be spiritual wealthy the love of god i can be more valuable what how can we be more rich than to have the love of jesus christ hallelujah amen that's more for me so amen uh so rahab cain and i god said do not marry canaanites except they get married i'm sorry except they become into the faith boaz and boaz married ruth a moabite the bible specifically said well deuteronomy 23 verse 3. look at this church look at this oh my goodness deuteronomy 23 verse 3 and ammonite or moabite shall what not enter into the congregation lord even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the lord forever that church the bible doesn't tell us but do you think god would keep ruth out of the house of god naomi gave her the choice actually naomi told her don't come go back to your family and brother said she made that great decision there yep that's right said she burnt all the bridges behind her amen i think she said i've seen your life naomi i've seen your life and your god will be my god wherever you go i'll go wherever you die i'll die amen i'll confess the name of jehovah the self-existent one hallelujah the strong one hallelujah praise god and then you think god kept her out of the congregation no way no way nothing in history is recorded on that god let a moabite in when he said they can't come in god let her in because she became a spiritual kind of convert now of course you would not let a moabite come in if they were a believer you would keep them out but god had to accept roots because what comes out of ruth again obed jesse david solomon down to jesus christ and she's even mentioned in the genealogy of jesus that's right that's right that's right have amen god bless these canaanites moabites in his very lynch as a reminder that he's the god who loves all nations that he redeemed by the blood every nation get your time and tongue hallelujah amen and i'll make them kings and priests unto god [Applause] amen yeah the fifth one uriah the hittite you're right they hit that other man said one day in heaven he said i want to go up and talk to your eye and say your testimony meant something to me he was the hittite and the bible specifically said kill all the hittites they're supposed to cast them out deuteronomy 7 verse 1. deuteronomy 7 verse 1. remember this one okay there's the hittites i go down to verse uh three maokai neither shalt thou make any marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give to his that's exactly what happened to bathsheba and uriah bathsheba's dead gave bathsheba to uriah a hentai so this is not speaking of this is speaking of sinners never give your believing child to a sinner to marry but we know the story of uriah and i don't you know a lot of veterans went to that david show uriah was he was up there in the area where david was david was in the cave right and there was all these these the 300 men they had debts they had all these problems they come to david and the bible said david made them mighty men in other words uriah come out of the world as a hittite and he recognized there's something different about david this guy's through the judge i'm gonna go sit under his ministry praise god in other words and he taught him out he became a believer he became a mighty man and uriah became one of the top three mighty men killing all kinds of uh evil bad guys and driving out the enemy he became a fearless warrior hallelujah and so once he became a believer yes then i can recognize he's a convert now he's a mighty man now he's mighty in the lower church how many are mighty in the strength of the lord this morning amen well not fear but we'll believe hallelujah amen believe the word of god that makes you mighty amen can you believe god's word so god's word forbid marriage to hittites but yet then bathsheba is allowed to marry uriah because he proved to be a mighty man and had great zeal for israel's god and their army they can only be possible through conversion let's see let let's hit one more and then we'll close here but i'm just buying we're having a good time in here you know i know man that's every service i just laugh about it because it's true i don't know how to happen uh go to philippians 2 verse 19. let's go to this last one i like this one because this one's kind of like me i feel like you know you try to find yourself you and i we try to find ourselves bible examples you know who most resembles our life in the bible i sure like timothy i like you so we've seen old testament examples right well here's a new testament example of a mixed marriage product or the child of a mixed marriage timothy was a product of a greek father and a jewish mother now the bible doesn't say anything about timothy's dad as far as his faith but the bible does say here we go for our mothers again our mothers and grandmothers the paul does say i see in timothy the same faith i've seen in his mother and grandmother see mothers and grandma see what faith you can put in those children i want to say nothing about his dad and here we are on father's day thank god for the mother's day thank god for the fathers but we don't see anything about timothy's dad in there where's his dad i don't know all he knows he's greek which is 916 miles away from israel by way of the bird i just looked it up on google before we got in here that's a long ways away almost a thousand miles away they were not the same nation not the same beliefs but somehow timothy's dad found favor you know with timothy's mom interracial marriage and look what the bible says uh philippians 2 19 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus on you shortly that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state look at verse 20. i love this for i know no man like-minded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things that are jesus christ the prophet of god hallelujah the church age messenger brother he has all these uh three missionary trips he tells the philippians i can't find anyone who's more like-minded than me than this half-breed over here oh no i'm just using that i can't find a jew i can't find a jew with faith like as like-minded as me the closest i can find is timothy timothy has a like mind in other words his mind is just like the prophet's mind amen he thinks just like the messenger of the hour and the messenger always tell you go back to the word of god hallelujah amen amen was timothy a hybrid well it depends how you define it we would say a hybrid of dna right but really it's not a hybrid because all dna is good dna yeah right did you know that i was going to break i didn't preach this on wednesday but when that uh germ and the egg come together they take 23 chromosomes 23 chromosomes and those 46 they write a brand new genetic code that's never been written before think about that eight billion people on the earth but austin and nobody's got a genetic code like you buddy nobody's got a fingerprint like yours they said but amen nobody's got your your unique creation god made the mold and they threw the ball away praise god amen each and every person is a beautifully fearfully wonderfully made beautifully designed creature that god's making god put his stamp on that said that's mine that's another masterpiece that's another finished pride how many billions of people have been down through the age and every single one has a different fingerprint nobody has dna just like yours it's different from everybody else's all right different your special your special kind of breed i don't know each one of you now i could name each one of you right casey you're a special brain hallelujah you're a believer but your physical makeup is also a special unique blend look at verse 21 for all preachers in other words seek their own desires not the things which are jesus christ but you know the proof of timothy that as a son with the father he has served me in the gospel hallelujah did paul say well he's a half breed his dad was agreed because mom's a jew i can't really use this guy no the physical had nothing to do with it amen the it was all about the spiritual it was all about prophet will you teach me your word i want to care about uh i don't care about the word like you care about the word i will sit under you i will learn from you i will i will take everything you can teach me just teach me so i can have a heart like yours amen so i can have a spiritual character like your spiritual character that's what make timothy such a wonderful man now church was there problems because of the interracial marriage yes in acts 16 1-3 the the jews wouldn't receive timothy because he was half-jew half-gentile so he got he went got circumcised in order for them to receive him so are there going to be consequences to having interracial marriage yes when you come against racist people but what's our job our job is to show them the love of god hallelujah that's our job timothy said well the way i can show these these haters towards the gentile these haters of the greek the way i can show them love is i can be circumcised and so when we receive hatred or we receive racism or we receive something we can show grace back and like think like timothy well what can i do to win their souls that's what paul said amen i become all things to all men that i white that i might win some to the faith you won't win them all you hardly win any right but these days but we can win some to the faith the bible said for they knew that his father was agreed so for some people this racial thing is a big issue but the if we're real christians with our hearts we know the truth in the inside their their ignorance or their hatred that doesn't scare us because we've got the love of jesus christ amen amen and we know perfect love casts out all fear amen and church also perfect love will hide a multitude of sins perfect love will hide a multitude of sin let's stand our feet i better stop practicing there's a lot more i got maybe a third done
