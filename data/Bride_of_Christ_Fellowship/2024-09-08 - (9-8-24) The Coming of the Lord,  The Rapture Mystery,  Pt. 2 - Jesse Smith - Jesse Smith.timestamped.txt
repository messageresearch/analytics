[2:58] name and the Saints said
[3:00] amen God bless you as you're being
[3:01] seated praise
[3:10] God so okay I have a few slides here H
[3:13] I'd like to show you know not every
[3:14] Sunday do I uh you know share slides but
[3:17] kind of worked out you know today I'd
[3:18] like to just show a few slides here by
[3:21] the grace of the
[3:24] Lord I don't know will that work okay
[3:26] that worked out good all right praise
[3:28] the Lord
[3:29] I'm going to be referencing you know
[3:31] some of the things I wrote uh in my book
[3:32] because I have a whole chapter on um The
[3:35] Rapture it was easier just to read out
[3:37] of it rather than you know copy and
[3:39] paste it all that because I've already
[3:40] written on it by God's grace so let's
[3:43] look at part two here the coming of the
[3:44] Lord uh the Rapture mystery so we
[3:47] started out with our text you know
[3:49] seeing how the Bible literally calls it
[3:51] a mystery uh there's
[3:54] 12 topics where the Bible calls them
[3:56] mysteries in the New Testament praise
[3:58] God this is one of them amen it's the uh
[4:01] mystery of how we're all changed in a
[4:04] moment and a twinkling of an eye and
[4:07] it's not the whole world is the
[4:09] Believers who are filled with the spirit
[4:10] of God hallelujah those are the ones
[4:12] that will be made ready Hallelujah uh
[4:15] for the Rapture going out to meet Jesus
[4:18] Hallelujah so uh it's called a mystery
[4:20] as we said uh it's one of the the 12 um
[4:24] I think it would be good to see you know
[4:25] that that that some people believe all
[4:27] Christians will go in the Rapture but
[4:29] that's not exactly right uh because they
[4:32] they they fail to see other scriptures
[4:35] there's two types of Christians there's
[4:37] wise Christians who are full of the Holy
[4:39] Ghost full of oil and there's foolish
[4:41] Christians who run out of oil so they're
[4:44] not full of the Holy Ghost now which one
[4:46] do you want to be praise God you have
[4:48] the choice today praise God you can be
[4:50] filled with the spirit with your lamps
[4:52] trimmed and clear or uh people will be
[4:55] uh will fail to make the preparations
[4:57] but now is the time to prepare
[4:59] Hallelujah as long as we've got breath
[5:01] in our lungs and as long as Jesus isn't
[5:03] here yet we've got time to prepare
[5:04] Hallelujah we got time to get the oil
[5:06] Hallelujah so just uh keep your spot
[5:09] there I'll just go back to Matthew 25 I
[5:11] don't have this on my slide so I'll just
[5:13] read it briefly because some people
[5:14] don't uh believe that uh but there's two
[5:17] types of Christians Jesus wouldn't lie
[5:19] to us Jesus is not trying to deceive us
[5:22] now was he speaking in mystery yes he
[5:23] was speaking a mystery because he called
[5:25] or he had Paul called this a mystery and
[5:27] Jesus is the one who revealed this to
[5:29] Paul
[5:30] Paul said in Galatians chapter 1 that he
[5:32] received the Revelation from Jesus
[5:34] Christ and thereby would preach these
[5:37] topics one of them included the Rapture
[5:39] praise God so Matthew 25 uh we'll start
[5:42] at verse one then shall the Kingdom of
[5:44] Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which
[5:46] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[5:48] the
[5:49] bridegroom so in those days I've seen
[5:51] this partially done down in South
[5:53] America in those days uh the bridegroom
[5:56] came at a certain time you know you had
[5:59] you you had the uh you had a bride of
[6:01] course and a groom and they they they
[6:03] never really knew when the wedding was
[6:05] going to take place they knew it was
[6:06] going to be a 7-Day celebration remember
[6:08] that from Jesus's Miracle the can of
[6:10] Galilee Miracle where he uh you know he
[6:12] turned the water to wine uh but in these
[6:15] days you know no one uh when the Jews
[6:17] separ uh celebrated this nobody knew
[6:20] when the bridegroom was coming you had
[6:21] to you had to be willing to to be ready
[6:23] you had to be willing to just drop
[6:24] everything in a moment's time and get
[6:26] ready for the
[6:27] celebration it was such a special moment
[6:29] it was one of the most special moments
[6:31] of every Community right every Jewish
[6:32] Community uh the Bible calls it the
[6:34] voice of the bride and the voice of the
[6:36] bridegroom Hallelujah uh two Souls
[6:39] United as one it was one of the uh
[6:41] happiest days of the year Hallelujah
[6:42] outside of the you know regular feast
[6:44] days and everything well you had to be
[6:46] ready and so uh the Bible said uh that
[6:49] these 10 virgins went forth to meet the
[6:51] bridegroom five of them were wise and
[6:53] five were
[6:55] foolish Hallelujah they that were
[6:58] foolish took their lamps but took no oil
[7:01] with them that means of course extra oil
[7:03] because their lamps had to have some oil
[7:05] in them in order to have light right if
[7:07] you've seen the old style uh oil lamps I
[7:10] there's oil in there but it quickly runs
[7:12] out like that story I told you from
[7:13] Brother Simon within a few hours his
[7:15] lamp his wife's lamp had already run out
[7:17] and the light had grown so dim and he's
[7:19] like what a reminder let's trim our
[7:20] lamps Hallelujah it doesn't last very
[7:22] long you know uh you you got to be you
[7:24] got to be in this for the Long Haul say
[7:26] it like that how many it for the long
[7:28] haul amen that's said if he comes in my
[7:30] lifetime Hallelujah if he doesn't come
[7:32] in my lifetime hallelujah praise God I'm
[7:34] going to be I'll be ready as long as I'm
[7:36] alive I want to be ready for his coming
[7:38] hallelujah amen but see he says it
[7:41] plainly you know uh so some of now
[7:44] virgin means of course no intercourse
[7:45] with the world this is a physical uh
[7:48] condition but it's speaking of a
[7:50] spiritual condition because Paul said in
[7:52] 2 Corinthians uh 11 uh he said that I've
[7:56] I've uh I I prepared you as a Chase
[7:59] virgin to Christ I've I've preached the
[8:01] gospel you've repented and now you're a
[8:03] chased virgin to Christ so other words
[8:05] God wipes away all your immorality and
[8:07] you're pure before God when you get
[8:10] saved Hallelujah so so just getting
[8:12] saved makes you a virgin spiritually in
[8:14] God's eyes hallelujah amen you're free
[8:16] you're forgiven all your past amen what
[8:18] a loving God Amen to forgive all of our
[8:21] past and give us a hope for the future
[8:23] hallelujah amen in his eyes it's it's
[8:25] like we never done it amen we he's
[8:27] washed it away and the Bible said he
[8:29] throws in the sea of forgetfulness
[8:30] praise God hallelujah and the devil
[8:32] tries to bring it back but just say
[8:34] Satan get behind me Hallelujah you're an
[8:37] offense under God you're a liar you're a
[8:38] bluff I only believe the word of God
[8:41] hallelujah we have to tell the devil
[8:43] that he's a liar amen and say get behind
[8:46] me
[8:47] Satan Hallelujah but see the oil took
[8:50] I'm sorry the wise took the extra oil
[8:52] and we're not going to read it but
[8:52] Zechariah 4 says not by might not by
[8:55] power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[8:57] and that spirit is represented by oil
[8:59] oil uh that that feeds into the olive
[9:01] trees right and gives them light uh Hagi
[9:04] and Zechariah are the uh are the
[9:06] representations there in Zechariah
[9:09] Chapter 4 Hallelujah verse 5 while the
[9:11] bridegroom carried they all slumbered
[9:14] and slept so this was this was part of
[9:15] common life you know they'd say it's
[9:17] time for a wedding but then the
[9:19] bridegroom wouldn't come what they're
[9:22] testing Your Allegiance right it's a
[9:24] test of Your Allegiance it's a it's a
[9:26] test of your preparation Hallelujah it
[9:29] was in that day and it is in this day
[9:31] amen hallelujah naturally even in the
[9:34] natural those Jewish families they
[9:36] wanted the people ready to be able to go
[9:38] at any time it showed a respect it
[9:41] showed a reverence for the
[9:43] family Hallelujah it truly did amen you
[9:46] can see it here so they wait so long
[9:48] they start falling asleep because it's a
[9:50] Midnight Cry went out at midnight amen
[9:53] hallelujah now when I saw it was it was
[9:55] a it wasn't a Midnight Cry so it was on
[9:58] a Sunday it was after church I think I
[10:00] just preached on a Sunday morning it was
[10:02] at the church of the firstborn there in
[10:04] Guyana okay uh but this was there was
[10:07] actually opposite in South America in
[10:09] South America the bridegroom sat right
[10:11] at the pulpit they had two chairs right
[10:12] here and he sat there they had a crown
[10:14] on him and they had all like his best
[10:15] clothes and he looked he was all dressed
[10:17] up like Christ amen and he was sat there
[10:21] and they they said uh behold the bride
[10:23] coming so they actually switched it
[10:24] there and so we sat there and it's it's
[10:26] hot it's like 9500 degrees I sat there
[10:29] waiting around for hours you know I
[10:30] stood for a little bit and I sat down
[10:31] for a little bit I stood for a little
[10:33] bit all of a sudden out of nowhere you
[10:34] hear a honk honk honk honk honk and
[10:36] there's the bride with all of her uh
[10:39] bridesmaids in this van and they got all
[10:41] the they got all the bells on the car
[10:43] and they're driving him and then they
[10:45] start the wedding ceremony so that
[10:47] that's how I saw it amen but the
[10:50] actually the opposite is true praise God
[10:52] right Hallelujah Jesus comes back to us
[10:54] he comes back to meet us in the air
[10:57] hallelujah hallelujah amen but it was a
[10:59] nice it was a nice uh kind of prefigure
[11:02] of this of of how you just have to be
[11:04] ready praise God and think about that
[11:06] God is going to have people ready all
[11:08] around the world for the Rapture think
[11:10] about that they're all going to be in
[11:11] one mind Glory I know what mind it is
[11:13] it's the mind of Christ amen it's not
[11:16] the mind of the Republicans or the
[11:17] Democrats it's not it's not their mind
[11:19] it's the mind of Jesus Christ amen
[11:22] they're going to be so in tune with
[11:24] Christ that they're ready to go in the
[11:26] Rapture amen around the world the Holy
[11:29] Spirit Will anoint people to believe as
[11:31] Jesus said whether they're sleeping
[11:33] whether they're working in the field
[11:34] whether they're working on the bread you
[11:36] know at the Mill grinding wherever they
[11:38] are they're going to be ready because
[11:40] the love of God is in their soul the
[11:42] love of God is shed abroad within them
[11:44] by the grace of God hallelujah amen man
[11:48] verse five they fall asleep verse six at
[11:50] midnight there was a cry made behold the
[11:52] bridegroom cometh go out to meet
[11:54] him then all those virgins arose and and
[11:57] trimmed their lamps they had to trim
[11:58] their lamps cuz lamps were almost going
[12:00] out Hallelujah so they trim it and then
[12:03] of course the wise realize oh thank God
[12:06] we've got enough oil but the foolish
[12:08] realized we didn't bring any extra oil
[12:11] now what does this represent it
[12:12] represents there's three parts to every
[12:14] person you have your body you have your
[12:17] mind and your soul that's what it
[12:19] represents Paul says that in 1
[12:21] Thessalonians 5:23 everybody has three
[12:23] parts so see the wise version had extra
[12:26] oil they just didn't have the Holy Ghost
[12:27] they just didn't feel the Holy Ghost on
[12:28] their body they just didn't think about
[12:30] the Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost
[12:32] sealed in their soul praise God right
[12:35] but the foolish virgin didn't they might
[12:37] have had it on their body and in their
[12:39] mind but they weren't born again in the
[12:40] soul that was the whole purpose of the
[12:42] New Testament the New Testament was
[12:44] Jesus said I'm going to give you rest
[12:46] for your not your body not your mind he
[12:48] said in Matthew 11 I'm going to give you
[12:50] rest for your soul Hallelujah that was
[12:53] the purpose of the New Testament
[12:54] Hallelujah was to give people the Holy
[12:57] Ghost in their soul and then Paul calls
[12:59] it Christ in you the hope of glory
[13:03] hallelujah it's a mystery that's another
[13:05] mystery amen along with the Rapture
[13:06] praise God is Christ in the soul of man
[13:09] or woman by the grace of God
[13:12] hallelujah now verse eight the foolish
[13:15] said unto wise give us of your oil for
[13:17] our lamps have gone
[13:18] out but the wise answered saying not so
[13:21] I can't I can't give you the Holy Ghost
[13:23] only Jesus gives the Holy Ghost
[13:25] amen Jesus said John said it John said
[13:28] there's one one coming after me John the
[13:30] Baptist there's one coming after me
[13:32] mightier than me and he will baptize you
[13:34] with the Holy Ghost in fire John said I
[13:37] can baptize you in water even John had
[13:39] the Holy Ghost the Bible said he was
[13:40] filled with the holy ghost from his
[13:41] mother's womb that was in his Spirit
[13:44] right he said but there's one coming
[13:45] after you who after me who's going to
[13:47] give you the holy ghost in a way I can't
[13:49] give it that's the Son of God that's the
[13:51] Messiah that's Jesus Christ that's God
[13:54] in flesh Hallelujah God's going to give
[13:56] you the holy ghost in your soul
[13:58] Hallelujah
[13:59] he's migher than me amen Jesus is the
[14:01] mighty one he's the Holy One amen he's
[14:04] God in flesh amen the almighty God
[14:07] hallelujah amen no man see no man can
[14:11] give you the Holy Ghost don't care what
[14:13] anybody says now God might direct that
[14:15] man or woman to pray for you and and
[14:16] they'll know they'll have a revelation
[14:18] you're going to get it you know but
[14:19] they're not the ones who gave it John
[14:22] said only Jesus can give it amen
[14:25] hallelujah and they'll say like this
[14:27] then you'll spend the rest of your life
[14:29] making sure that that was a genuine
[14:32] experience Hallelujah is that right
[14:34] Church you'll get because what happened
[14:36] after Jesus got the Holy Ghost what' the
[14:37] Holy Ghost do go out in the wilderness
[14:38] it's time for a
[14:40] test because God wanted to make sure
[14:42] that Holy Ghost you got was the real
[14:44] deal and if it's the real deal it will
[14:47] overcome the Gates of Hell amen it'll
[14:50] overcome the high school trials amen
[14:52] it'll overcome the the workers the the
[14:54] adult workers trials amen children's
[14:57] trials it'll help you in the schools
[14:59] this Holy Ghost is everpresent he never
[15:01] leaves he never forsakes he's an
[15:03] everpresent help in time of trouble
[15:07] amen yes
[15:09] amen he said it's better that I leave
[15:11] because then I'll send the Comfort
[15:13] comforter and he'll be with you even in
[15:15] you to the end of the age
[15:17] amen we don't need to Hope and say I
[15:19] wish Jesus body was here you've got the
[15:21] Holy Ghost now amen the Holy Ghost I'll
[15:24] say is more than a match for
[15:26] Satan I'm going to say it again the the
[15:29] Holy Ghost is more than a match for your
[15:32] trials Satan cannot he can't even stand
[15:35] in the presence of Christ
[15:37] hallelujah we're more than conquerors
[15:39] amen we're uh the Bible said uh the
[15:43] power of God is mighty for pulling down
[15:45] strongholds amen we have a weapon that
[15:48] can tear down every chain every gate
[15:50] every obstacle every wall every trial
[15:52] God is more than able we just got to
[15:54] yield to God
[15:56] Amen he does all things in his perfect
[15:58] time Hallelujah he works at the pace of
[16:01] perfection that's
[16:03] right see so verse 8 and9 you know you
[16:06] can't give the Holy Ghost to somebody
[16:08] you can't prepare them for the Rapture
[16:10] you can only prepare yourself for the
[16:11] Rapture you can guide others as a father
[16:14] as a pastor I can guide people but I
[16:16] can't give it myself God's Got to Give
[16:18] It
[16:20] Hallelujah verse
[16:22] 10 and while they went to buy the
[16:24] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[16:26] went in with him to the marriage and the
[16:28] door was shut so see not every Christian
[16:31] not every virgin as a Christian makes
[16:33] the Rapture only those who prepared oil
[16:37] go in the
[16:38] Rapture right and people say oh no
[16:41] that's just a parable just a parable I'm
[16:43] sorry excuse me red letter words are
[16:45] just words no those are words from God
[16:47] Almighty
[16:49] amen because you can see the two kinds
[16:51] of Believers all down through the Bible
[16:53] Hallelujah right you can see it you had
[16:55] Enoch and Noah Enoch lived a higher life
[16:57] than Noah praise God
[16:59] right Abraham and lot Abraham was
[17:01] totally out of Sodom lot kind of hung
[17:03] around there too long and the Bible said
[17:05] lot was scarcely saved from that but
[17:07] Abraham was totally out of it amen you
[17:10] can see it all down through the whole
[17:11] Bible amen it's just laying right there
[17:13] you have David he was a man after God's
[17:15] Own Heart then you had Saul King Saul
[17:17] who barely got saved right at the end he
[17:20] got saved because he stopped chasing
[17:21] David and he went out to fight the
[17:22] Lord's battles he repented of his sins
[17:24] and then David sang about him said he
[17:26] was a mighty like a lion during his
[17:28] lifetime and yet he spent most of his
[17:29] adulthood chasing down David trying to
[17:31] kill
[17:32] him but how did the Holy Spirit anoint
[17:34] David the Holy Spirit anointed David to
[17:36] show that his grace was sufficient even
[17:38] for Saul hallelujah
[17:40] amen God's grace is sufficient even for
[17:43] the thief at the cross in his last dying
[17:45] hours where he started off making fun of
[17:47] Jesus saying save us but within a few
[17:49] hours the Holy Spirit had changed his
[17:51] heart and they said Jesus Remember me
[17:53] when you come into your kingdom and
[17:55] Jesus gave that great consolation not
[17:57] tomorrow today you'll be with me in
[17:59] Paradise amen what a consolation what an
[18:02] expression of Grace that's our savior
[18:05] he's mighty to save he's King Jesus
[18:07] amen let me tell you he's the same
[18:09] yesterday today and forever he can say
[18:12] today that way
[18:14] too
[18:17] Hallelujah that's right so see only
[18:20] those that were ready with extra oil an
[18:23] extra dose of oil an extra portion of
[18:26] oil go into the marriage the marriage is
[18:29] the rapture of
[18:31] course afterward came also the other
[18:33] virgin saying Lord Lord open to us and
[18:35] he answered said to the and said verily
[18:38] I say to you I know you not so they're
[18:39] they're virgins but he doesn't know them
[18:42] intimately like he should know us
[18:44] remember Paul said we got to know him in
[18:46] the power of his resurrection everybody
[18:48] say and and see most people just want to
[18:50] know him in the power show me Miracles
[18:52] show me Miracles but he said I got to
[18:53] know him also in the fellowship of his
[18:56] sufferings
[18:59] that's what most of us don't want to do
[19:00] you you don't to say Amen I'll say amen
[19:02] for you amen right we don't like to
[19:04] suffer for God but we have to learn how
[19:06] to suffer for God he said I want to know
[19:08] him in both ways in the power the glory
[19:12] but I also want to know him in the
[19:13] fellowship of his sufferings so I can be
[19:15] conformed to be like him
[19:18] amen Paul said you only Reign if you
[19:21] overcome suffering now I'm paraphrasing
[19:23] that that's that's not the exact quote
[19:25] from the King James but I'm paraphrasing
[19:27] I taught on it uh not too long long ago
[19:30] now he says that verse 13 watch
[19:32] therefore for you know neither the day
[19:34] nor the hour when the son of man cometh
[19:37] see God is keeping this a secret and
[19:39] remember God's even keeping a secret
[19:41] from
[19:42] Jesus Jesus doesn't even know that's in
[19:46] uh since you're Matthew 25 I just look
[19:48] geography like brother said g uh ge
[19:50] geographically I just look across the
[19:52] page Matthew 24:36 but of that day and
[19:55] hour knoweth no man not the angels of
[19:57] heaven but the father only and then in
[20:00] Mark 13 He says the son doesn't even
[20:02] know it only the father Hallelujah this
[20:06] is such a mystery church we got to be
[20:08] watching and
[20:09] praying we got to be watching and
[20:12] calling on God Hallelujah Lord help me
[20:14] to be ready Lord fill me with your power
[20:16] fill me with your spirit help me to be
[20:18] ready for your coming I don't want to
[20:19] miss it
[20:20] Hallelujah Glory now okay now that's the
[20:23] introduction that wasn't even in my
[20:24] notes amen so he says now of course it's
[20:26] in my heart amen it's written on the
[20:28] fleshly table my heart the mystery the
[20:30] Rapture is called a mystery in 1
[20:32] Corinthians 15:51 now the mysterious
[20:34] part he says it's the moment of the
[20:38] change it's at the unknown day and hour
[20:41] of his coming now for the Deep teaching
[20:43] you remember this the unknown day and
[20:45] hour is the reality form of the seventh
[20:48] seal right because when the seventh seal
[20:51] breaks in a literal reality form the
[20:54] Bible said Heaven is
[20:56] silent There's No Angel singing brother
[20:58] there's no there's no angel Ministry
[21:00] nothing all of Heaven is quiet because
[21:02] Jesus left heaven and he's coming down
[21:05] to earth to meet us in the air amen
[21:07] hallelujah so that's the mystery behind
[21:09] the seven seal now do we have the
[21:11] revelation of it yes it's the unknown
[21:13] day and hour there's no really there's
[21:15] really no symbol to it other than the
[21:17] conditions of Heaven there's no symbols
[21:18] for it like a horse rider or or balances
[21:21] or nothing like that in the first five
[21:22] SEALS or six seals rather there's there
[21:25] there's no symbol to it really that's
[21:27] why it's mysterious that's why it's
[21:28] called a mystery now most of you know
[21:31] this but if you don't you'll be blessed
[21:34] go to Isaiah
[21:35] 25 because when Paul Paul when he says
[21:40] uh death is swallowed
[21:41] up he's actually quoting an Old
[21:44] Testament verse so I thought I'd bring
[21:46] this out here just aesh and looking for
[21:48] more revelation of the Holy Spirit how
[21:50] many believe God's going to give us more
[21:51] Revelation as we approach the Rapture
[21:54] God always does that there it's always a
[21:55] progressive revelation right in the
[21:57] Garden of Eden for th000 years before
[21:59] Jesus God gave their first Messiah
[22:01] prophecy right Thou shalt bruise his
[22:04] head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[22:06] that's the first prophecy of Jesus 4,000
[22:09] years but you fast forward Isaiah
[22:11] started prophesying said a virgin shall
[22:13] conceive Hallelujah Micah said he'll be
[22:16] born in Bethlehem amen and so it was
[22:19] Progressive as you got closer to the
[22:21] first coming you understood more about
[22:23] the coming as we approach the second
[22:25] coming we should understand more about
[22:27] it Hallelujah
[22:29] that's what I'm trusting in amen because
[22:30] again he's the same yesterday today and
[22:34] forever now you're there in Isaiah 25
[22:37] but I'm going to read uh 1 Corinthians
[22:39] 15
[22:40] again verse 54 so when this corruptible
[22:44] shall have put on incorruption and this
[22:46] Mortal shall put on immortality then
[22:49] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[22:52] is written death is swallowed up in
[22:55] Victory so Paul says Jesus showed me
[23:00] that Isaiah
[23:02] 25:8 is the body change that's the
[23:05] mystery of the
[23:07] Rapture
[23:09] hallelujah amen is't that beautiful if
[23:12] you just would have read Austin before
[23:13] you knew about the Rapture Jose if
[23:15] before you knew about the Rapture if you
[23:17] just would have read Isaiah 25 would you
[23:18] have thought oh that's the Rapture of
[23:19] the New Testament Church you would never
[23:22] thought that because it's hidden because
[23:25] it's a mystery glory amen and the
[23:27] Mysteries are for the people of God
[23:29] hallelujah they're to us and our
[23:32] children that we might do all the laws
[23:34] of the Lord amen not legalism now but
[23:37] it's the law of the Holy Spirit now
[23:39] Romans chapter 8 is plain on that we
[23:41] live by the law of the Holy Spirit not
[23:43] by the law of the the Jews hallelujah
[23:46] amen now I'm going to go back to Isaiah
[23:49] 25 in my
[23:51] Bible okay so I read that Paul cites
[23:55] this and just look around uh at at the
[23:58] cont context here look around at the
[24:00] context that's why you might remember I
[24:02] brought some of these things
[24:04] out especially the part about the wine
[24:08] okay now I'm going to start at verse one
[24:10] Lord Thou Art my God I will exalt thee I
[24:12] will praise thy name for thou Hast done
[24:14] wonderful things thy counsels of old are
[24:16] faithfulness and Truth anything said yet
[24:18] about the Gentiles any Gentiles anybody
[24:20] see anything in there no was this
[24:23] originally written to Gentiles not that
[24:25] I can
[24:26] find but God hid the Rapture in this
[24:30] chapter and the Jews they still don't
[24:32] see it to this day and they're not going
[24:33] to see
[24:34] it right they're not going to see it God
[24:37] hid the Rapture for you and I the
[24:39] Gentiles in this chapter what a mighty
[24:42] God we serve
[24:43] amen verse two for thou Hast made of a
[24:46] city and heap of a defense City a ruin a
[24:50] palace of strangers to be no City it
[24:52] shall never be built therefore shall the
[24:55] strong people glorify Thee the city of
[24:57] the Terrible Nations shall fear thee for
[25:01] thou Hast been a strength to the poor a
[25:03] strength to the needy and is distress
[25:05] how many can say Amen to that as I told
[25:08] you we were on food stamps my whole life
[25:09] God was a strength to the poor
[25:12] hallelujah a refuge from the storm a
[25:14] shadow from the heat when the blast of
[25:16] the terrible ones is as a storm against
[25:19] the wall Thou shalt bring down the noise
[25:21] of strangers as the heat in a dry place
[25:24] even the heat with the shadow of a CO of
[25:25] a cloud the branch of the terrible ones
[25:28] shall be brought
[25:29] low now verse
[25:32] six uh speaks of a mountain Hallelujah
[25:36] and in this mountain shall the Lord of
[25:38] hosts make unto all people a feast of
[25:41] fat things a feast of wines on the
[25:44] leaves of fat things full of marrow of
[25:48] wines on the leaves well refined okay so
[25:52] the mountain of course if there's only
[25:54] one mountain it's got to be
[25:56] Jerusalem right either the natural
[25:58] Jerusalem or the New
[26:00] Jerusalem Hallelujah and what are they
[26:02] having they're having a feast so God
[26:04] takes down all the enemies God destroys
[26:06] all the enemies God fights all of our
[26:08] battles Hallelujah and then God will
[26:10] give a feast in his holy
[26:13] mountain verse 7 and he will destroy in
[26:16] this mountain the face of the covering
[26:18] cast over all people and the veil that
[26:21] is spread over all nations so when God
[26:25] has his people gathered there there's
[26:26] feasting there's wine wine represents
[26:28] the stimulation or joy of the Holy Ghost
[26:31] and then God takes away this Veil off
[26:34] the nation's eyes verse eight
[26:38] now let's be honest we don't see the
[26:41] Gentiles really in here it's the
[26:43] mountain of the lord it's it's God's
[26:45] people it's spoken by Isaiah but verse
[26:47] eight is what you and I are trusting in
[26:50] with thus sayeth the
[26:51] Lord how many know the raptures thus
[26:53] sayith the Lord that's what I'm talking
[26:54] about we don't know when we don't have
[26:57] thus sayth Lord on that but we do know
[26:59] the Rapture is thus sayith the Lord amen
[27:01] because it's in the Bible in fact that's
[27:03] what brother r ends the Rapture sermon I
[27:05] listened to it yesterday uh in December
[27:07] 1965 that's what he ended on there's
[27:10] going to be a Rapture it's thus sayith
[27:12] the Lord most people don't think that
[27:14] most people think well Jesus will come
[27:16] back and then we I'll just have a brand
[27:17] new life again no there's lots of things
[27:19] that are going to happen there's lots of
[27:21] events that are in the scripture praise
[27:22] God he's got to come back first and
[27:25] snatch away his wife before he pours out
[27:27] destruction amen what man would let his
[27:30] wife go through all that destruction and
[27:32] the tribulation no man would do that and
[27:34] if we wouldn't do that if I would to do
[27:35] that to my wife then God won't do it to
[27:37] his wife hallelujah amen he's going to
[27:40] snatch her away Hallelujah like the
[27:41] Bible
[27:43] says so you and I our hope is in verse
[27:46] eight he will swallow up death in
[27:50] Victory and the Lord God will wipe away
[27:52] tears from off all
[27:54] faces Hallelujah is there anything
[27:57] you'll be crying about then Jesus will
[27:59] say let me wipe that away let's not cry
[28:01] anymore I'm the answer to all your
[28:03] questions amen I've got all the answers
[28:06] to everything you want to know about
[28:07] amen hallelujah because he's all knowing
[28:10] he knows all things
[28:11] Hallelujah he'll be able to take you
[28:13] know you'll be thinking about something
[28:14] and Jesus will be able to explain
[28:15] something where you stop crying oh
[28:17] praise the Lord it is finished amen
[28:21] hallelujah he knows what's
[28:23] right and the rebuke of his people shall
[28:25] he take away from off the Earth for for
[28:28] the Lord has spoken it and it shall be
[28:31] said in that day Lo This Is Our God ah
[28:33] this is our God this is who he is he
[28:34] loves us we have waited for him and he
[28:37] will save us this and this is the Lord
[28:39] we have waited for him we will be glad
[28:41] and rejoice in his salvation amen for in
[28:44] this mountain shall the hand of the Lord
[28:46] rest and Moab should be trotten down
[28:47] under him even as straw is trotten down
[28:50] for the dung Hill and he shall spread
[28:52] forth his hands in the midst of them as
[28:54] he that swimme spread forth his hands to
[28:56] swim he shall bring down their pride
[28:59] together with The Spoils of their hands
[29:01] and the Fortress of the high Fort of thy
[29:03] walls shall he bring down low lay low
[29:07] and bring to ground even to the dust if
[29:10] you didn't know 1 Corinthians 15 you and
[29:12] I would have no idea that's about us at
[29:15] least one
[29:16] verse
[29:18] Hallelujah at least one verse but we see
[29:21] in this that God breaks down every enemy
[29:24] in order to save in order to give his
[29:27] people the victory praise God right we
[29:30] can all see the one world uh government
[29:32] happening we can all see that with
[29:34] currency going digital anybody can see
[29:36] that anybody can see that with with
[29:39] covid you know uh wrecking the economy
[29:41] and all these things everybody can see
[29:42] that's what eventually it's going to get
[29:44] to it's in the Bible it's Revelation 13
[29:46] we can all see that but God promises
[29:48] there's going to be a people that I'm
[29:50] going to help give them victory over
[29:52] this as the as the world uh rallies
[29:54] against Jesus Christ I'm going to give
[29:56] them Victory I'm going to let I'm gonna
[29:58] let life swallow up death in Victory
[30:00] Hallelujah am I'm gonna because because
[30:04] they're so swallowed up on my word I'm
[30:06] going to let uh their their their
[30:07] physical bodies be swallowed up in a new
[30:09] body praise God Amen that's right
[30:13] amen because you see man does not live
[30:15] by bread alone but by every word that
[30:17] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[30:19] hallelujah and as we keep swallowing and
[30:21] enjoying the word of God and feasting on
[30:23] the word of God we become one with the
[30:25] word and because we eat the book
[30:27] Hallelujah the spirit of God will
[30:28] swallow us up as well Hallelujah how do
[30:31] I say it
[30:32] amen because we swallow the book life
[30:35] will swallow us up
[30:37] hallelujah it's a great promise
[30:39] Hallelujah and see that's what you can
[30:41] tell the devil devil you can't swallow
[30:42] me up because life's going to swallow me
[30:44] up I've got the promise he's like a lion
[30:48] seeking whom he may devour but you can
[30:51] say Satan you can't swallow me up God's
[30:53] already promised me he's swallowing me
[30:55] up
[30:56] Hallelujah ah glory amen hope somebody's
[30:59] being blessed today amen so see now the
[31:02] context I don't know which all those
[31:03] verses in here apply to the Rapture all
[31:05] I know is that verse eight applies
[31:07] because that's what Paul said but there
[31:10] could be some clues in here you know the
[31:11] wine that kind of reminds me of the
[31:13] former and latter rain right new wine
[31:16] and all these things kind of reminds me
[31:17] of that there I've used that before it's
[31:19] possible you know you have uh that could
[31:22] be the former latter rain in there uh
[31:24] the feast As We Gather into the Lord
[31:25] we're feasting with him uh this is our
[31:27] God you know verse 9 he saves us we're
[31:29] saved from the tribulation Hallelujah so
[31:33] there there's many verses that could
[31:34] apply to us but we need God to give us
[31:36] greater Revelation Hallelujah that's why
[31:38] we're here today amen now I just thought
[31:40] I would share this not every Rapture is
[31:42] the
[31:43] same did you know this I just thought
[31:45] this the Holy Spirit brought this to my
[31:46] memory today Elijah and Elisha and the
[31:49] sons of the prophets they knew the day
[31:51] of his
[31:53] Rapture ain't that something not every
[31:55] Rapture is the same Hallelujah but Jesus
[31:58] said you don't know the day or the hour
[32:01] Elijah was privileged to know it and all
[32:03] the the spiritual people around him knew
[32:06] it was the hour I'm sorry the
[32:09] day and he could say this day I'm being
[32:11] raptured now for us we'll never know
[32:14] that day Jesus said no man knows it but
[32:16] I say like this we can know the season
[32:18] of The
[32:19] Rapture amen because that's what Paul
[32:21] said the times and Seasons Brethren you
[32:24] don't have any need that I can write I I
[32:25] write that unto you we'll Rec ize the
[32:28] One World Government we'll recognize
[32:30] these things coming on we'll see it it
[32:32] will not take us surprise we're not
[32:34] groping around in darkness like Blind
[32:36] Mice or something like that our eyes are
[32:38] open we're the children of God God's
[32:40] turned on the light we see what's
[32:42] happening we'll be ready for the body
[32:43] change amen amen that's what the Bible
[32:46] says
[32:47] amen that's not what I say that's what
[32:49] the Bible says
[32:51] hallelujah so see every Rapture is
[32:54] slightly different now what we want to
[32:55] be is like Enoch we want to to be
[32:58] pleasing to the Lord because the Bible
[33:00] said Enoch was not for God took him
[33:03] because he had a testimony that he
[33:05] pleased God right so we want to find
[33:08] that type in the in the Rapture and we
[33:10] want to say Lord help me each day to
[33:12] live a pleasing life unto
[33:14] you that's how I'm going to get prepared
[33:17] for the Rapture that's how I'm going to
[33:18] be ready for the Rapture Hallelujah I
[33:22] feel like I got a good start here
[33:24] amen now I'm going to just lay this in
[33:26] here here's a mystery that I don't quite
[33:28] yet understand this is part of the
[33:29] mystery rather it's part of the mystery
[33:32] I don't quite understand uh here's
[33:35] what's needed for us and I'm sorry
[33:38] here's what's needed for
[33:40] me sorry my throat's getting a little
[33:42] dry it's about the last Trump because it
[33:44] confuses so many Christians which is
[33:47] understandable that's why this is called
[33:48] a
[33:51] mystery okay so Paul said it the Rapture
[33:54] the body change takes place at the last
[33:56] Trump how
[33:58] let me read
[34:03] that Hallelujah yes it's again verse 52
[34:07] 1 Corinthians 15:52 the Bible says in a
[34:10] moment in the twinkling of a eyee that
[34:12] just means like a a twinkle in the eye
[34:14] or like a blink of an eye so fast can't
[34:16] even time it at the last Trump for the
[34:20] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[34:21] be raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[34:24] changed
[34:25] Hallelujah now the reason this confus
[34:27] confuses so many Christians which is
[34:29] understandable remember church God
[34:31] allows people to be uh confused because
[34:34] Jesus said I thank thee father that thou
[34:36] has hid these things from the wise and
[34:38] prudent but reveal them unto babes such
[34:40] as would learn for even so it seemed
[34:43] good in your sight so see God only gives
[34:46] out Revelation to the people who are
[34:48] humble that become his children before
[34:51] him oh God help us to be humble amen am
[34:54] Jesus said he thank God God you hide
[34:56] these Revelations from the prideful
[34:58] people and that's why churches can't see
[35:01] it because they're prideful they trust
[35:02] in their money or their denomination or
[35:04] their attendance or whatever you know
[35:06] they trust in other things their status
[35:08] in life their bank accounts they trust
[35:10] in all those things rather than trusting
[35:12] in God hallelujah so God hides it from
[35:15] them see because they write up their
[35:16] their bylaws and their Creeds right that
[35:19] are unscriptural and they keep changing
[35:21] and they keep allowing more sin into the
[35:23] church that's the devil allowing more
[35:25] sin in the church God makes us more holy
[35:28] Satan makes us Unholy God will make us
[35:31] more holy praise God remember 2
[35:33] Corinthians 7:1 uh Paul said examine
[35:36] yourselves he said and perfect Holiness
[35:39] in the fear of God see that's why
[35:42] denominations always miss the mark and
[35:44] they can be good for a season but a
[35:46] denomination will miss the mark because
[35:48] they don't perfect Holiness they
[35:50] actually allow more
[35:52] unholiness that's right church that's
[35:54] right I know we understand that
[35:56] Hallelujah but this is this is why it's
[35:58] confusing and I'll have a few visuals
[35:59] here in just a
[36:00] moment 1 Corinthians 15:52 calls it a
[36:04] last Trump and I believe 1 Thessalonians
[36:07] 4 also calls it the last
[36:13] Trump okay no it just calls it the Trump
[36:16] of God so I'm reading 1 Thessalonians 4
[36:18] uh 16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[36:20] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[36:22] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[36:25] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[36:28] first so this is the mysterious element
[36:31] of it it's because some people read last
[36:34] Trump and they think the seventh trumpet
[36:37] of Revelation
[36:38] 11 but that's not the right Trump
[36:41] Hallelujah there's a different Trump God
[36:45] has to finish uh God has to finish the
[36:47] Gentile age with a trump
[36:51] hallelujah it's the last Trump to the
[36:53] Gentiles cuz Romans 11 said he cuts off
[36:56] the Gentiles he's going to graph back in
[36:58] the Jews and then the Jews have
[37:02] trumpets Hallelujah any Bible reader
[37:05] should be familiar with that okay if you
[37:07] studied real deep and long Hallelujah
[37:09] sat in the presence of the Lord so see
[37:12] our last Trump for the Gentiles is
[37:14] different from the seventh Trump of
[37:16] Revelation
[37:18] 11:15 Hallelujah so this is a topic I
[37:21] need to study what I need to do I need
[37:23] to find the last Trump for the Feast of
[37:27] P Pentecost or the Feast of Weeks I got
[37:30] to find that in the scripture so brother
[37:31] Austin that's what I'm looking for you
[37:33] find it brother you let me know we're
[37:36] gonna I'm going to go digging for it
[37:37] here hopefully the next few weeks by
[37:38] God's grace now let me show you the
[37:40] calendar now I'm sorry you know it's
[37:42] okay that's actually pretty big okay I
[37:43] thought wouldn't be that big so remember
[37:46] Israel every year Israel has seven
[37:47] feasts right Passover unleavened bread
[37:49] first fruits these are all within three
[37:51] days in March or April they happen three
[37:53] days in a row okay but then 50 days
[37:55] after first fruits you have Pentecost
[37:57] which is also called The Feast of
[37:59] Weeks okay now this lasts for uh 3
[38:01] months and then in the seventh month you
[38:03] have trumpets 10 days later's atonement
[38:06] I forget how many days I think it's
[38:07] seven days later they have Tabernacles
[38:10] okay now they they all had natural they
[38:13] all have natural meanings to the Jews
[38:14] and the natural meaning is down here
[38:16] like we're familiar with that how many
[38:17] you familiar with that raise your hand
[38:18] if you I preach this it's been a I guess
[38:19] it's been a while since I preached this
[38:21] but they all had they all had spiritual
[38:23] meanings so the Passover actually
[38:25] represented Jesus's death the unleavened
[38:27] represented Jesus taking all of our sin
[38:30] down to Hell right the Bible said he
[38:32] descended and preached to the spirits
[38:33] that were in prison and he got the keys
[38:35] of death and Hell praise
[38:37] God right he took care of all our sin
[38:40] and then the first fruits represents his
[38:43] resurrection 50 days later represents
[38:45] the Feast of Pentecost now this Feast
[38:47] has been going on for 2,000
[38:50] years see now this website's uh yeah
[38:54] this I disagree here's where I disagree
[38:56] the trumpets I believe will will call
[38:58] Israel together because it's calling
[39:00] Israel together for what for the day of
[39:03] atonement that's what the Feast of
[39:05] trumpets was about they blow the
[39:07] trumpets and they'd gather for a day of
[39:09] mourning right and then 10 days later
[39:13] then all their sins will be forgiven
[39:16] Hallelujah with the the Two Goats
[39:18] remember the Two Goats the uh uh we went
[39:20] through that before in Leviticus the Two
[39:22] Goats it was the day of atonement but
[39:24] this is symbolic of the 144,000 Jews
[39:27] having all their sins forgiven because a
[39:30] fountain of the blood of Jesus Christ
[39:32] will be open in the House of David
[39:34] Hallelujah Zechariah tells us that
[39:37] amen and then they and then for seven
[39:40] days they sat in booths uh because it
[39:42] reminded them of when they come out of
[39:45] Egypt but for us you know we're not
[39:47] going to set up booths we're going to
[39:48] build houses for a thousand
[39:50] years glory to God Amen everybody see
[39:52] the everybody see the types and then
[39:54] this is the type and then this is the
[39:56] anti-type or fulfillment now what I'm
[39:59] looking for brothers if you read your
[40:01] Bibles here here I'm looking for I got
[40:04] to find a last Trump that ended the
[40:06] Feast of Weeks because remember there
[40:08] was barley Harvest and there was Fruit
[40:09] Harvest in the Feast of Weeks maybe I'll
[40:11] preach a series on that by God's
[40:13] grace okay now the Rapture is not the
[40:16] trumpets because it's calling Israel
[40:18] together for the Forgiveness of sins
[40:20] right the Rapture is not for the
[40:21] Forgiveness of sins we're already
[40:22] forgiven Saints I'm already forgiven how
[40:25] many y are already forgiven by God's
[40:27] grace amen the Bible said you already
[40:29] are you now are the sons of God
[40:31] hallelujah you're already forgiven
[40:33] Colossians 2 says he's already forgiven
[40:35] all your trespasses hallelujah amen you
[40:38] already are but this is calling Israel
[40:40] together to forgive all their sins
[40:42] because they rejected their
[40:44] Messiah right and they said let his
[40:46] blood be upon us and our children and so
[40:48] it has
[40:50] been Mercy Lord so that's just gives you
[40:53] a visual of what I'm looking for in the
[40:55] scripture I need to go study the uh
[40:57] Feast of Weeks brother William and feast
[40:58] of Pentecost I'm talking about in the
[41:00] Old Testament so I can try to find is
[41:02] there some trumpet that that brings to
[41:05] the end of the Harvest so is there some
[41:07] trumpet that gives you a harvest at the
[41:10] end of the Feast of Weeks how many know
[41:11] understand what I'm talking about okay
[41:13] hope it's not hope it's not over your
[41:14] heads I don't think so but it's been a
[41:16] while since I preached it now Church
[41:18] remember brother said some doctrines do
[41:20] not pertain to Salvation such as the
[41:22] coming of the Lord you know whether a
[41:24] person believes the raptures before
[41:28] or after the tribulation that doesn't
[41:29] mean they're not saved it's just they
[41:32] can't understand the mystery that's
[41:33] right right not everybody's going to
[41:35] understand all the Mysteries you get the
[41:37] Mysteries if you humble yourself that's
[41:39] what Jesus said you got to become like a
[41:41] child and then God will reveal the
[41:42] Mysteries to you Hallelujah and you also
[41:46] have to rec you have also have to
[41:47] recognize Revelation 10:7 when Jesus
[41:49] brings down the book and he gives it to
[41:51] the seventh angel which was a man and he
[41:54] and he finishes the mystery of God how
[41:56] many understand that he preaches the
[41:58] mystery of God then we eat the book and
[42:00] we prophesy again amen glory to God now
[42:05] brother bam said the serpen SE doesn't
[42:06] even pertain to Salvation I don't think
[42:09] I had time to put the quote I think I
[42:10] forgot to put the quote on here and of
[42:12] course believing if God's three persons
[42:14] or one person or two persons that
[42:16] doesn't save you or make you lost right
[42:20] now we believe God's one person God
[42:21] never says I'm three persons just
[42:23] because there's a father son holy ghost
[42:25] that Jesus baptism that doesn't mean
[42:26] there's three persons it just means God
[42:28] can manifest himself in as many ways as
[42:29] he wants because here's a study I showed
[42:32] I was reading this week Jesus the Bible
[42:34] said God anointed Jesus with the Holy
[42:37] Ghost well if there's three persons why
[42:40] does uh why does the second person he's
[42:43] already supposed to be God why does he
[42:45] need anointed by another person he's
[42:47] already God and the doctrine says
[42:50] they're already
[42:51] co-equal so their doctrines a lie amen
[42:54] and we don't believe lies amen
[42:58] what if you're already God if you're
[43:00] already the Eternal Son of God why do
[43:01] you need more of God you're already
[43:03] Eternal Son of God it don't make any
[43:05] sense it's a contradiction it's a lie
[43:08] God's not three persons God is one
[43:09] person amen he just changes his mask
[43:12] Hallelujah he just changes manifestation
[43:15] and remember on the day of Pentecost he
[43:16] broke up into 120 fires that don't mean
[43:19] God's 120 persons it just means you
[43:21] can't limit God God is the Holy One he's
[43:23] unlimited he's almighty God hallelujah
[43:26] amen
[43:27] he could have broke himself up into a
[43:29] million Flames it don't matter that
[43:30] don't limit
[43:34] God God said the Bible says uh the
[43:37] Father the word and the Holy Ghost these
[43:38] three are one didn't say three persons
[43:40] it's three manifestations are one
[43:42] Hallelujah that's what the Bible said
[43:44] God was manifest in flesh Amen
[43:48] Hallelujah Jesus was a manifestation an
[43:50] appearing of God not a second person
[43:52] he's the physical image of the person of
[43:55] God hallelujah because God the Father
[43:58] cannot be seen has never been seen will
[44:00] never be seen we only see the father in
[44:03] The Son
[44:05] hallelujah amen
[44:07] hallelujah I just want to thank the Lord
[44:08] for letting me hear his word brother
[44:11] William never my wildest dreams that I
[44:13] ever think I'd preach something like
[44:14] this never I in my life wi dreams that I
[44:16] ever think I'd be a preacher
[44:19] anyways brother was talking about uh in
[44:22] 1963 brother was talking about uh does
[44:25] the bride get raptured before after the
[44:27] tribulation he says the the brother said
[44:30] the brother said well the bride's got to
[44:31] she's got to go through the tribulation
[44:33] to be purged and brother Braham
[44:34] disagreed he said I can't agree with him
[44:37] because I don't see it like that but it
[44:39] doesn't pertain to Salvation it's
[44:40] pertaining to the coming of the Lord he
[44:43] sees the church has got to go through
[44:44] the tribulation period for purification
[44:46] but brother says I don't see that I say
[44:48] the blood of Jesus Christ has already
[44:50] purified the church amen and remember
[44:53] you can't throw out Matthew 25 we
[44:54] already read that there's a wedding
[44:56] going on and some virgins make it and
[44:58] some don't that's Jesus's words he's not
[45:01] lying to us he's telling us the truth we
[45:03] got to have more oil we got to have the
[45:05] Holy Ghost hallelujah amen oh thank the
[45:09] Lord amen see so then all those people
[45:11] really when when when they say that when
[45:13] they say all Christians go to the
[45:14] Rapture what they're doing is they're
[45:15] basically ripping Matthew 25 out of the
[45:17] Bible we don't need that that's not true
[45:19] that doesn't apply to us I'm sorry it
[45:21] applies all the word of God
[45:25] applies see I believe the church Church
[45:27] goes through the tribulation period the
[45:28] church organization so that that's what
[45:30] he means the foolish virgin but the
[45:31] bride the wise virgin does not would you
[45:34] choose a woman you had to purify before
[45:36] you married her see Christ's bride is
[45:38] chosen she's elected she is God's bride
[45:41] the Bride of Jesus
[45:43] Christ now this is a different one but
[45:45] he says I believe it'll be the same
[45:47] thing when Jesus comes again each man
[45:49] has him a chart well he's going to come
[45:51] riding on a white horse the other one
[45:52] said no he's coming on a white
[45:55] cloud he said what difference doesn't
[45:57] make as long as he's coming so see these
[45:59] people will argue they'll call you
[46:01] you're a devil you're a heretic you're
[46:02] all these things it don't even pertain
[46:05] to
[46:06] Salvation the question is have you
[46:08] confessed your sins have you for ask God
[46:10] to forgive you of all your sins and have
[46:11] you received salvation through the blood
[46:13] of Jesus Christ amen is your faith in
[46:15] your denomination or is your faith in
[46:17] the blood of Jesus Christ that's the
[46:18] question amen that's right that's right
[46:21] and then if you say you know my my
[46:22] salvation's in my mom's experience or my
[46:24] grandma or my granddad or my
[46:26] denomination if you say that then you
[46:28] are deceived Hallelujah then you're on
[46:30] your way to hell you this pertains to
[46:32] salvation Salvation is in the blood of
[46:34] Jesus Christ only not a man not a woman
[46:37] not a church Creed not a pope not a
[46:38] cardinal not an Archbishop salvation is
[46:41] by Jesus Christ Alone hallelujah
[46:45] amen that's
[46:49] right he said that's the main thing but
[46:52] they fall out on that that's why I can
[46:54] fellowship with a Catholic I can
[46:55] fellowship with a Baptist I can
[46:57] fellowship with a Pentecostal I can
[46:58] fellowship with all of them as long as
[47:00] we're trusting in the blood of Jesus
[47:02] Christ but if somebody say well you got
[47:04] to pray to Mary to be saved well I said
[47:05] I say I'm sorry I don't believe that I
[47:08] can't have fellowship with you if you're
[47:09] going to say that you know with all the
[47:11] kindness in my heart
[47:14] right see but people will fall out on
[47:16] that one will start a group over here
[47:18] the other one over there just whether
[47:20] he's going to ride a white horse or
[47:21] White Cloud it does it doesn't make any
[47:23] difference just so he comes that's the
[47:25] main thing is to believe is
[47:29] coming Hallelujah now my precious
[47:31] brother now here's where brother R says
[47:33] it he says it with thus sayith the Lord
[47:34] because brother Braham was a
[47:36] prophet I heard a lot of back in 2020 I
[47:38] heard a lot of TV internet preachers say
[47:41] the Lord told me Trump's going to be
[47:43] president he's gonna have two terms in a
[47:45] row and they lied they lied in the name
[47:47] of the Lord they are false prophets but
[47:51] every time brother Ram said thus sayith
[47:52] the Lord it has come to pass we're still
[47:54] waiting on some but we're also still
[47:56] waiting on on Isaiah's prophecy about
[47:57] the
[47:59] Rapture amen hallelujah that was eight
[48:01] let's see 900 years before Christ so
[48:03] 2900 years ago almost 3,000 years we're
[48:05] still waiting on a prophet's prophecy to
[48:07] come to pass see God's people are
[48:10] patient Hallelujah in patience we
[48:12] possess our souls we're still waiting
[48:14] for Isaiah his word to come to pass he
[48:16] had something to come to pass but we're
[48:18] still waiting on some but we will wait
[48:20] on the Lord we'll renew our strength
[48:22] like the ego praise God amen amen glory
[48:27] said now my precious brother look how he
[48:28] calls trinitarians he said you're
[48:30] precious he didn't say you devil you
[48:33] devil possess trinitarian he didn't say
[48:35] that he disagreed With Love Christian
[48:38] love my precious brother I know this is
[48:41] on tape also now don't get
[48:45] excited I love his self-control let me
[48:48] say this with Godly love the hour has
[48:51] come I'm sorry the hour's approach where
[48:53] I can't hold still on these things no
[48:54] more it's too close to the coming see
[48:56] trinitarianism is of the devil because
[48:58] like I told you it contradicts itself
[49:00] it's a false
[49:01] Doctrine why does the second person need
[49:04] to know and the Bible Jesus said the
[49:06] father that dwelleth in me does the
[49:07] works but then the Bible said Jesus
[49:09] filled with the Holy Ghost you mean one
[49:10] person has two other persons inside of
[49:12] him brother what sense does that
[49:15] make huh one person had the Son of God
[49:18] had to get two other people to dwell in
[49:20] Him Sister beus does that make any sense
[49:21] to you no that must mean it's not true
[49:24] because it's not in the Bible either
[49:27] two persons have to anoint another
[49:28] person and then he's fully God and then
[49:30] he then he's anointed what what doesn't
[49:33] make any
[49:34] sense brother man says it's of the devil
[49:37] now look what who who who started this
[49:38] it was the Roman Catholic church now
[49:40] look at all their false doctrines they
[49:41] got now like I said praying to Mary
[49:44] saying you know brother William you and
[49:46] I went to all those churches remember
[49:47] years ago and they would hold up that
[49:49] wafer like it was and they say that
[49:51] wafer is the literal body of Jesus and
[49:54] they give out the cup and say this is
[49:55] the literal blood it's not just one or
[49:57] juice it's actually the blood that's a
[49:59] false that's a lie that's the devil
[50:01] telling you that that that bread doesn't
[50:04] turn into the
[50:05] body the Bible said and mass means a
[50:08] sacrifice they Chris mass or or in this
[50:10] case the Catholic mass it means Jesus is
[50:12] going to be sacrificed
[50:14] again right there but there's the Bible
[50:16] said he only dies one time amen he only
[50:19] dies one time so see the church at start
[50:20] of the Trinity they also have all these
[50:22] other false
[50:23] doctrines because if they don't correct
[50:25] one it's just going to lead to more
[50:28] mistakes it's like leaven you put a
[50:30] little leaven in it's going to impact
[50:31] the whole lump thank God for the
[50:33] unleavened lump of God's Church
[50:36] hallelujah hallelujah Paul Paul said get
[50:39] that Lev them out from among you that
[50:41] you can be a new lump
[50:44] Hallelujah brother said I say that thus
[50:47] sayith the Lord now that's a real
[50:48] prophet of God right there and remember
[50:51] the Trinity Church I don't know why I'm
[50:52] on this so
[50:53] much the Trinity wasn't even formulated
[50:56] till uh 200 years or so after John died
[51:00] the Bible writers didn't even write the
[51:02] Trinity that was all 200 some years
[51:05] after John died the last Apostle died
[51:09] but see they love that they worship that
[51:11] and I've been called a heretic because I
[51:13] don't believe in three persons well the
[51:14] Bible never called it three persons I'd
[51:17] rather believe the Bible than man
[51:19] because Jesus said let no man deceive
[51:21] you by any means and Satan only changed
[51:24] one word in the Bible to Eve he said
[51:26] Thou shalt not surely die and look at
[51:29] all the effects we got because of it now
[51:31] change in one word what about injecting
[51:34] uh two extra words three persons the
[51:36] Bible never said he's three persons look
[51:38] what it's
[51:40] done look where it come from it come
[51:42] from the Nan Council that was around 325
[51:44] ad when the Catholic Church came in
[51:46] rulership the word Trinity is not in the
[51:48] Bible unless you have an amplified Bible
[51:50] I showed that to brother William
[51:52] yesterday Trinity that they put the word
[51:54] in the Amplified Bible don't you be
[51:56] reading Amplified bibles if I see some
[51:58] of you reading Amplified Bible and say
[52:00] can you please consider did you know
[52:01] there's a trinity in there I wouldn't
[52:03] read that version if I were
[52:06] you I don't think you would the word
[52:09] Trinity is not even mentioned entire
[52:10] book of the Bible and as far as three
[52:12] persons that's from Hell there's one God
[52:14] that's exactly right now do you say then
[52:16] do you believe that all those people are
[52:18] trinitarians are of hell no sir look at
[52:21] that see they can be saved even though
[52:23] they only even though they believe in
[52:24] three persons
[52:26] I believe they are Christians but the
[52:28] hours approaching brother when they're
[52:30] sincerely wrong see because remember we
[52:33] preach on the image of the Beast
[52:34] remember the mark of the beast it's
[52:35] going to be connected what's the mark in
[52:36] the forehead it's believing their false
[52:40] doctrines church we better stay awake
[52:42] hallu you I'm talking about naturally
[52:43] and spiritually we better stay awake
[52:45] that's going to be their calling card
[52:47] what aren't you a trinitarian don't you
[52:49] believe the early church fathers I don't
[52:50] believe the early church fathers unless
[52:52] it's the fathers who wrote the Bible
[52:54] which which early fathers you talking
[52:56] about
[52:57] I certainly going to follow Augustine
[52:59] after the things he said I'm going to
[53:01] follow the early church writers the
[53:03] authors of the New Testament praise
[53:05] God all right now I'm not GNA do this I
[53:09] might do this next time on Wednesday but
[53:11] I want you to see this okay uh the word
[53:13] caught
[53:15] up 1 Thessalonians 4:17 we which are
[53:18] alive and remain shall be caught up
[53:21] everybody say caught up ready CGH up
[53:23] here's the Greek word for caught up hard
[53:26] pod
[53:27] harpazo looks like
[53:29] harpazo that's the Greek word now this
[53:32] is used 13 times in the Bible the New
[53:34] Testament so I maybe I'll preach on that
[53:36] on Wednesday just so you can see it I
[53:39] want you to see it now this this helps
[53:41] prove the raptures before the
[53:43] tribulation
[53:45] period right because what does it mean
[53:47] Church These are different ways that
[53:49] authorized version will give you English
[53:52] words to try to understand
[53:54] it so caught up can mean catch up and
[53:57] can take by force not like oh can I
[53:59] please have that pretty pleased devil
[54:01] can I have the church no Jesus is going
[54:03] to come down and say give me my bride
[54:05] that's right amen I'm taking her because
[54:07] I bought her with my own blood
[54:09] Hallelujah sorry Lily I don't mean to
[54:11] scream in your face there she's
[54:12] sleeping sorry Lily bless your heart but
[54:16] Jesus come down and said I'm gonna
[54:17] snatch her up I'm gonna seize I'm going
[54:20] to carry her off by
[54:22] force before the tribulation I'm
[54:25] snatching her away
[54:26] like if I did this I'd say I'm snatching
[54:28] this I need this right now that's Jesus
[54:31] coming in the Rapture it's not like
[54:32] Devil pretty please devil uh pretty
[54:35] pleased devil can I have the bride he
[54:37] don't apologize to nobody hallelujah
[54:40] amen he's taking his bride cuz he bought
[54:43] her he paid for her he gave her extra
[54:45] oil praise God she's got the oil she's
[54:47] ready she heard the Midnight Cry he's
[54:49] taking her because she has made herself
[54:51] ready
[54:52] hallelujah oh my it means to seiz on
[54:57] claim for oneself eagerly see not
[55:01] a I'm going to apologize here uh
[55:03] denominations I'm GNA apologize Den
[55:05] nominations of the Catholic church can I
[55:06] have my bride sorry no it's no
[55:10] apology his wife made herself ready
[55:13] Revelation
[55:15] 19 to snatch out to snatch out or way so
[55:21] just in the very definition of caught up
[55:24] now we use the word rapture the word
[55:25] rapture is not in the King James vers
[55:27] version right but that's a that's a
[55:29] similar word in our language where oh a
[55:31] Rapture means to take away right or
[55:33] caught up in you're caught up into Glory
[55:35] right Rapture I'm raptured up oh I'm
[55:36] enjoying this and raptured feeling right
[55:38] it just means caught up you're in a
[55:40] higher Place higher
[55:41] realm and we don't we don't you know I
[55:44] don't have to call it the Rapture I
[55:45] don't have some I don't have some uh uh
[55:48] I don't have a claim on the word rapture
[55:50] I don't have to call it the Rapture I
[55:51] can call it the catching up I can call
[55:54] it the seizing I can call it whatever
[55:56] the Bible calls it amen but the thing is
[55:59] Jesus is taking her away he claims that
[56:02] church for himself that's what we need
[56:04] to find out today where's the church
[56:06] Jesus claims for himself Hallelujah
[56:09] where's the church who's in the word all
[56:11] the way and is constantly trying to get
[56:13] sin out of her midst and seeing the
[56:15] spirit of God move amongst her
[56:16] Hallelujah not a pretend but a real move
[56:19] of the Holy
[56:20] Ghost how you know it's a real move
[56:22] it'll line up with the word of God
[56:23] that's how you know glory to God
[56:28] now forgive me if I'm wearing you out I
[56:29] I want to go half an hour more I don't
[56:30] know we'll see here by God's grace yeah
[56:32] now I want to get to okay now everybody
[56:33] this should perk everybody up here now
[56:35] this is a recent attack on the
[56:37] pre-tribulation Rapture and I I mean it
[56:39] in the nicest way possible okay because
[56:42] these people they seem like good people
[56:43] now Tucker says he's always believed in
[56:45] God but he went to a fake church he said
[56:47] growing up now that that's his his words
[56:50] now John rich now he's a country singer
[56:52] he started off as a bad singer but now
[56:54] he sings good song good songs for
[56:56] country I don't listen to them I'm not
[56:58] going to start listening to them okay we
[57:00] got enough good musicians we in songs we
[57:02] don't need to listen to people that you
[57:04] wonder about okay but let me tell you
[57:06] him a little bit about him on and you
[57:07] can watch the whole thing it's a I
[57:09] listened to the whole thing on twice two
[57:11] speed you know or 1.75 something like
[57:13] that so his dad was so zealous for the
[57:16] word of God his dad had a scoffield
[57:17] Bible he went to Seminary and he uh he
[57:20] preached the pre-tribulation Rapture
[57:22] until recently I don't know maybe the
[57:24] last few years
[57:26] and so as a boy he saw his dad go to
[57:28] Marty Groth I think at 36 years in a row
[57:30] now I've never been to Marty Groth I
[57:31] don't plan on
[57:33] going because it's just it's an excuse
[57:36] to live in sin and debauchery it's a
[57:39] license for
[57:40] levious it's a licens to sin right but
[57:44] John rich said he saw his dad play
[57:46] Christian songs as the prey would go by
[57:48] and got spit on for 36 years he would be
[57:51] just covered in spit he said but every
[57:54] now and then he said maybe uh maybe one
[57:57] or two times people stop by and say why
[57:59] are you singing and getting spit on you
[58:00] know cuz he's singing about Jesus and
[58:02] all these people are living in sin they
[58:03] don't want to hear Jesus they're getting
[58:05] drunk you know how it is you know some
[58:06] even my kids from first grade they come
[58:08] back and have these Marty girl parties
[58:09] they come back with all these beads on
[58:10] and all these hats and it's just rry
[58:13] they're teaching their first graders to
[58:14] do stuff like that like it's okay it's
[58:16] not okay the Holy Ghost makes you holy
[58:19] praise God and loves Holiness praise God
[58:22] but he said he said his dad was his hero
[58:24] grown up because he'd stand there and
[58:26] just play Jesus songs like The Old
[58:28] Rugged Cross and I'll Fly Away
[58:30] Hallelujah and Amazing Grace amen
[58:32] hallelujah and when the Savior calls I
[58:34] will
[58:35] answer he said and let's say one out of
[58:38] a hundred people that would stopped to
[58:39] talk to him would get saved he said
[58:41] maybe in those 36 years maybe he just
[58:43] saved a hundred
[58:45] people and he said my dad was my hero
[58:48] and so this guy knows knows some of the
[58:50] word of God I respect that let me say I
[58:52] respect that because I've never done
[58:53] that I've only brother Brooks and I only
[58:55] went out in the park did it once or
[58:57] twice we didn't get spit on people
[58:58] started joining us that was nice but
[59:01] this is kind of viral you know it's
[59:02] almost four million way more than videos
[59:04] that I've ever got you know definitely
[59:08] viral but um you know they have a lot of
[59:11] conversation if you want to watch it go
[59:12] to the 38 minute Mark and from there on
[59:15] they kind of talk about uh the mark of
[59:17] the beast and everything like that but
[59:19] our our our uh I'm sorry this this man
[59:22] John he takes a hard stand against
[59:25] anybody who believes in the Scofield
[59:26] bible and I got my Scofield bible right
[59:29] here by God's grace I got my Scofield
[59:31] bible the one I preached with since 2009
[59:33] so this is a very almost 20 years I
[59:35] preached out of this scoffield Bible and
[59:37] church I went and looked scoffield only
[59:39] has brother there's just a few notes on
[59:41] the Rapture it's not like he F it's not
[59:43] like he fills the book and says anyone
[59:45] that doesn't believe in the preach
[59:47] ration Rapture is of the devil he don't
[59:49] even say that he just says there's uh
[59:52] there there's a there's a Rapture before
[59:54] the tribulation and then Jesus C has to
[59:56] come back to the Jews uh for the 144,000
[59:59] and then Jesus has to come back at Armor
[1:00:00] again he just brings out that point that
[1:00:03] there's numerous comings of Jesus how
[1:00:05] many remember that when I said that
[1:00:06] there's numerous comings left of Jesus
[1:00:08] there's the Rapture for the Gentiles
[1:00:10] there's the
[1:00:12] 144,000 uh there's
[1:00:14] Armageddon Hallelujah and then uh yeah
[1:00:17] then he's here yes there's at least
[1:00:18] there's three there's still three more
[1:00:20] comings he's already had one there's at
[1:00:22] least three
[1:00:23] more but most people don't know the
[1:00:26] scripture and so they say oh there's
[1:00:28] only one more coming and think about
[1:00:29] that they put all these different they
[1:00:31] make all these events one event to me
[1:00:33] that's the uh that that that's the
[1:00:36] almost the insanity of it how can you
[1:00:38] make the Rapture and the 144,000 Jews
[1:00:42] and uh uh and Armageddon how can you
[1:00:45] make all that one event in the moment of
[1:00:47] twink of an eye that it's you can't do
[1:00:49] that there's too many things
[1:00:51] happening all right everybody with
[1:00:54] me everybody feeling good
[1:00:57] today I'll give you a chance to
[1:01:00] reset that's what I tell my class all
[1:01:02] right everybody reset
[1:01:03] now there's a video link if you want it
[1:01:06] so this is John Rich's claims at the 39
[1:01:09] minute Mark he said in 1830 John Darby
[1:01:12] introduced a pre-tribulation Rapture now
[1:01:13] I studied Darby I didn't find much bad
[1:01:15] things about him he seemed like a pretty
[1:01:17] good preacher I don't know searched two
[1:01:18] websites got answers and
[1:01:20] Wikipedia I didn't see much bad about
[1:01:22] him but scoffield learned from him and
[1:01:25] and then uh in uh Scofield put this his
[1:01:29] pre-tribulation
[1:01:31] teaching in his first Study Bible it was
[1:01:34] 1909 Scofield put out his first Bible
[1:01:38] now does 1909 mean anything to
[1:01:42] anybody that was when brother Brown was
[1:01:45] born so that's why in
[1:01:48] 2009 Brother Joseph put out a 100-year
[1:01:51] anniversary Bible of the Scofield bible
[1:01:53] with some brother Ram quotes in there
[1:01:55] and was my first scoffield Bible that uh
[1:01:57] Joe and Carrie C gave to me a special
[1:02:00] gift by God's grace you got one too oh
[1:02:03] yeah I think we got one do we glory amen
[1:02:05] that's right yeah that's right
[1:02:07] Hallelujah and so uh John Rich makes
[1:02:10] this claim and he might be right I don't
[1:02:12] know but he makes a claim that it all
[1:02:14] started from John Derby but I say like
[1:02:16] this the pre-tribulation Rapture started
[1:02:18] with
[1:02:19] Paul Hallelujah I believe we can prove
[1:02:22] that by the Bible and then you know on
[1:02:24] the video he reads all of Matthew 24
[1:02:27] John Rich does he reads it to Tucker
[1:02:28] Carson and Tucker Carson he's he's
[1:02:31] actually more humble right now he says
[1:02:33] when the Jehovah's Witnesses knock on
[1:02:34] his door and they want to give you paper
[1:02:36] hey can I give you a paper can I he says
[1:02:38] he reads every one of those now that's a
[1:02:40] sincere man that's a man who's open to
[1:02:44] truth how many of us are that open to
[1:02:46] truth now we we know better right but
[1:02:48] how many of us when we were searching
[1:02:49] for God we're just willing to read and
[1:02:52] learn and uh Tucker said he even bought
[1:02:55] a Bible with no notes in it so he didn't
[1:02:58] get any deception from any man that's
[1:03:00] pretty good that's pretty good I like
[1:03:04] that I like that if I just had a way to
[1:03:07] email him somehow you know anybody got
[1:03:09] his email address I like to text
[1:03:14] him and so Darby was a lawyer turned
[1:03:16] preacher he taught premillennialism
[1:03:19] which means Jesus comes back before the
[1:03:20] Millennium and dispensationalism like
[1:03:23] Gentile Jews right he goes from dis this
[1:03:25] dispensation into the next dispensation
[1:03:27] also the seven Church ages are
[1:03:28] dispensational now scoffield had a very
[1:03:30] sinful past I'm not going to say much
[1:03:32] about it but he had a very sinful past
[1:03:34] that's why some people don't like him
[1:03:35] I'll say like this he lived in adultery
[1:03:37] he was in
[1:03:38] adulterer uh but he turned to a preacher
[1:03:41] and he published his first Study Bible
[1:03:43] in 1909 the same Year brother Bram was
[1:03:44] born now here's Tucker's claim now this
[1:03:47] is what I don't understand if anybody
[1:03:48] can help me on this you're welcome to
[1:03:49] help me Tucker claimed that Scofield's
[1:03:53] commentary his commentary had has had
[1:03:56] massive effects on United States
[1:03:58] politics and resulted in the deaths of
[1:04:00] many people there's the time Mark if you
[1:04:02] want to go listen to it I'm like how is
[1:04:04] the pre-tribulation rapture caused
[1:04:06] people to
[1:04:07] Die the pre-tribulation Rapture I wish I
[1:04:10] could have got more answers on that I
[1:04:12] don't see how it would make anybody
[1:04:14] die then three minutes later John Rich
[1:04:18] tells listeners the supposed danger of
[1:04:21] the Rapture I'm sorry the
[1:04:22] pre-tribulation Rapture he says there's
[1:04:24] danger in teaching that I I've been
[1:04:25] preaching it for uh 20 years I haven't
[1:04:28] seen any danger in it I've seen hope in
[1:04:29] it think about what's the other the
[1:04:31] other thing is if you don't believe in
[1:04:33] the pre tribulation Rapture then you're
[1:04:34] going to suffer through the tribulation
[1:04:36] period there is hope and Jesus says
[1:04:40] remember and Paul says we will not
[1:04:42] obtain the wrath of God but we will
[1:04:45] obtain salvation from the Lord
[1:04:50] hallelujah so John Rich says the danger
[1:04:53] of scoffield and his Bible
[1:04:56] which brother Bram didn't find it to be
[1:04:58] danger did he he took it in the cave and
[1:05:00] the angel met him in the cave
[1:05:03] Hallelujah he said it can't be the mark
[1:05:06] of the beast oh yeah uh John Rich says
[1:05:08] if you're a scoffield Believer he said
[1:05:10] you'll go up to the mark the Beast and
[1:05:11] say oh yeah th this this Mark in your
[1:05:14] hand or head yeah this can't be the mark
[1:05:16] of the beast because I'm still here go
[1:05:18] ahead and sign me up that's what he
[1:05:20] thinks is the
[1:05:22] deception friends that is no deception
[1:05:26] any Bible reader any lover how many love
[1:05:29] Jesus Christ any lover of Jesus Christ
[1:05:31] will know Revelation
[1:05:33] 13 anytime the world is going to force
[1:05:36] you to take a mark of the beast you know
[1:05:38] it's the
[1:05:39] devil in other words that won't deceive
[1:05:42] a real believer and the church said amen
[1:05:45] hallelujah everybody's a little tired
[1:05:46] today okay so I'll try
[1:05:49] to try to see if the Lord will stir us
[1:05:51] back up amen hallelujah because I got to
[1:05:53] finish this thought amen bear with me
[1:05:56] that's understandable praise God we all
[1:05:58] have tired Sundays don't we all have
[1:05:59] tired Sundays anybody have ever have a
[1:06:00] tired Wednesday
[1:06:02] night now what about when you're the
[1:06:04] preacher in it's tired wies tday you got
[1:06:06] to let the songs lift you up and then
[1:06:07] you got to get out of your uh tiredness
[1:06:09] you got to get in the spirit
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:12] hallelujah so he says that's the danger
[1:06:15] well uh I'm still here the world's
[1:06:18] forcing us uh to take a mark to buy or
[1:06:20] sell well sure I'll take it I'm sorry
[1:06:24] the Bible says if your name is on the
[1:06:26] Lamb's Book of Life brother William
[1:06:28] before the foundation of the world you
[1:06:31] won't take the mark of the beast
[1:06:32] Hallelujah you'll be able to recognize
[1:06:34] the Beast the wisdom of God will help
[1:06:37] you recognize the Beast and you'll turn
[1:06:39] on you'll overcome the Beast system
[1:06:41] Hallelujah if your name was on God's
[1:06:43] book Hallelujah before the foundation
[1:06:45] world the elect cannot be deceived
[1:06:48] hallelujah amen glory to God so see this
[1:06:51] is a weak at best weak argument to
[1:06:55] attack our our scoffield Bible and our
[1:06:58] pre-tribulation
[1:07:02] Rapture and then he says when he does
[1:07:04] show up the Antichrist the pope
[1:07:06] Antichrist which the Antichrist is going
[1:07:07] to be a
[1:07:09] pope there the pre-tribulation Believers
[1:07:12] are going to be walking right into a
[1:07:13] buzzell so that's what he thinks he
[1:07:15] thinks Christians who believe Scofield's
[1:07:17] Bible and brother Ram's teaching right
[1:07:19] anybody who believes pre- tribulation
[1:07:20] are walking into a buzs
[1:07:22] saww and they can't see the buzs saww
[1:07:25] I'm sorry the Revelation gives you
[1:07:28] victory over the gates of hell we don't
[1:07:31] walk into the Gates of Hell brother
[1:07:33] William Hallelujah we we overcome the
[1:07:36] Gates of Hell Hallelujah I mean this
[1:07:38] just goes against all common Bible
[1:07:41] knowledge is anybody being helped today
[1:07:43] by God's grace
[1:07:47] Hallelujah and here's what I like about
[1:07:48] Tucker brother William it raises the
[1:07:51] question I wrestle with every day which
[1:07:53] is how do you know what's true
[1:07:56] how do you know what's deception and
[1:07:58] what's
[1:08:00] truth and the brother and and John rich
[1:08:02] said you got to have discernment and
[1:08:04] anyone who's not telling you the word of
[1:08:06] God is a deceiver and I said Amen to
[1:08:08] that Hallelujah and also God sent us a
[1:08:11] prophet named William brandham to point
[1:08:14] us back to the Bible to finish the
[1:08:15] mystery of God with the spirit of Elijah
[1:08:18] to tell us how to get ready for the
[1:08:20] Rapture by pointing us to one thing
[1:08:22] everybody say the Bible ready the Bible
[1:08:24] that's it he pointed us to here every
[1:08:26] man of God every true preacher of God
[1:08:28] will point you right here to the word of
[1:08:29] God hallelujah won't be something
[1:08:31] outside the word you can't add one word
[1:08:33] or take one word away it'll be right
[1:08:35] there in the Bible
[1:08:37] Hallelujah see I think there's hope for
[1:08:39] tuckle Carson Hallelujah I think there's
[1:08:40] hope I know he's done a lot of cuss
[1:08:43] words I've heard him say cuss words and
[1:08:44] I don't listen to him much at all
[1:08:45] anymore but when I saw this I thought oh
[1:08:47] my There's
[1:08:50] Hope now uh let's see
[1:08:55] I've got all this here
[1:09:02] uh let me
[1:09:05] close let me
[1:09:07] close I'm going to close with
[1:09:11] this brother
[1:09:13] brandom came and as I said he gave us
[1:09:16] thus sayeth the Lord how many know that
[1:09:18] by God's grace he gave us I've never
[1:09:20] heard Billy Graham say that I've never
[1:09:21] heard TD Jake say that Joel
[1:09:23] ostein now I've heard Kenneth and say it
[1:09:25] but he was wrong remember he said thus
[1:09:27] sayith the Lord Co you're going to end
[1:09:28] right now it was March of 2020 well Co
[1:09:30] is still going on right we had kids miss
[1:09:33] school recently because of Co CO's still
[1:09:35] going on and he said I command you to
[1:09:37] stop well it actually got worse after
[1:09:38] that that man's a liar he's not a
[1:09:41] prophet of
[1:09:43] God but
[1:09:45] remember um I want to read this here
[1:09:47] it's a reference for me I'm reading it
[1:09:49] here the last sign before the Rapture
[1:09:53] now this is a little deeper here but in
[1:09:55] Genesis
[1:09:56] 18 God foreshadowed the last sign before
[1:10:00] the
[1:10:01] Rapture
[1:10:03] right the last sign and the Rapture is
[1:10:06] typed through Isaac Isaac's birth
[1:10:10] represents Jesus's Second Coming
[1:10:14] Hallelujah that's what we can see
[1:10:15] because it's the coming of the son it's
[1:10:17] the promised coming and in order for
[1:10:20] that to happen Abraham and Sarah had to
[1:10:22] have a body change the Bible said her
[1:10:25] womb was dead and Abraham's strength was
[1:10:29] dead and then but God had to come to him
[1:10:32] in Genesis 17 and say Abraham you're
[1:10:34] gonna have a son through
[1:10:36] Sarah and and Abraham laughed in the
[1:10:39] face of God remember that but what'd he
[1:10:42] do eventually he believed him praise
[1:10:44] God because unbelief does not hinder God
[1:10:49] I thought I'd hear a little louder Amen
[1:10:51] on
[1:10:53] that cuz you're Abraham you're Abraham's
[1:10:56] seed Hallelujah you and I are
[1:10:59] Sarah we don't always just easily
[1:11:01] believe God and you know you and I just
[1:11:05] we never get to the spot where we have
[1:11:07] no no unbelief or no sins we're always
[1:11:09] going to be battling sin right up until
[1:11:11] the time of the Rapture praise
[1:11:13] God but see our unbelief as children of
[1:11:16] God does not hinder the move of God
[1:11:19] hallelujah God will accomplish what he
[1:11:22] said every word in the Bible will be
[1:11:24] fulfilled
[1:11:26] Hallelujah so in Genesis 18 God comes to
[1:11:29] Abraham and Sarah the last time before
[1:11:32] Isaac
[1:11:33] comes remember and God told Abraham
[1:11:37] surely I'll visit you right and Sarah
[1:11:40] will have a son remember that now Sarah
[1:11:43] was right there behind the tent right
[1:11:45] behind the the the tent and she laughed
[1:11:48] at God I'm G to have a son impossible
[1:11:51] how can I have a son and then God called
[1:11:53] her out and said Sarah you laughed and
[1:11:54] she said I didn't didn't I didn't laugh
[1:11:56] she lied in the face of God God said no
[1:11:59] you did
[1:12:00] laugh right so see God forgives our
[1:12:04] lies didn't God forgive rahab's lie
[1:12:08] Hallelujah didn't God forgive Abraham's
[1:12:11] lies how many believe God has a message
[1:12:13] of Grace amen hallelujah our sins God
[1:12:17] forgives if we'll confess
[1:12:20] them and own up remember the I heal your
[1:12:23] backslidings you got to you and I got to
[1:12:25] come to God and say God forgive me bring
[1:12:27] the sacrifice of your lips the calves of
[1:12:29] your lips I was wrong it was my sin it
[1:12:32] was my iniquity receive me return to me
[1:12:34] and God will return to you Hallelujah I
[1:12:37] will heal your backslidings
[1:12:41] Hallelujah so then God told Sarah yes
[1:12:43] I'll visit you according to the time of
[1:12:45] life so next year the very next year was
[1:12:48] when Isaac
[1:12:49] came so in that one year of time Abraham
[1:12:53] and Sarah started slowly getting younger
[1:12:55] and think of that church didn't Abraham
[1:12:57] have six more Sons after that or
[1:12:59] seven who who remembers huh you remember
[1:13:02] Lydia how many sons
[1:13:04] Abraham coutura bore him some sons and I
[1:13:08] mean he was so thoroughly changed Oh my
[1:13:11] he was th so thoroughly changed you know
[1:13:13] after having Isaac he didn't go back to
[1:13:15] being old he still had this body change
[1:13:18] Hallelujah and he had numerous more Sons
[1:13:21] afterwards why because death was
[1:13:23] swallowed up in life Hallelujah amen I'm
[1:13:25] trying to close but I'm enjoying this
[1:13:27] amen I know you are too I know it's just
[1:13:29] a tired tired Sunday here
[1:13:31] hallelujah so what was the last sign
[1:13:34] before Abraham and Sarah's body
[1:13:36] changed it was God revealing the
[1:13:39] thoughts and intents to Sarah's
[1:13:42] heart right and that's what God did in
[1:13:45] brother Brandon's Ministry we have 1,00
[1:13:48] tapes of brother random from when he
[1:13:49] preached from the 40s 50s 60s I would
[1:13:51] say there's maybe a thousand maybe more
[1:13:53] you can hear the prayer lines where
[1:13:55] they'll bring people to before brother
[1:13:56] brandom and he'll tell them their name
[1:13:58] their address their doctor what happened
[1:14:01] he'll tell them all their
[1:14:03] secrets and brother R said this is not
[1:14:05] me this is Jesus giving you a
[1:14:08] sign this is jesus' sign that you're the
[1:14:11] true church if you believe the word of
[1:14:13] God and then remember brother said this
[1:14:16] six
[1:14:17] times he said remember let me tell you
[1:14:20] thus sayith the Lord that's on me this
[1:14:21] is the last sign to the Gentile Church
[1:14:23] before the rapture three days later he
[1:14:25] said thus sayith the holy spirit this is
[1:14:28] your last sign write in your Bible and
[1:14:29] if something Rises beside this greater
[1:14:31] than this call me a false prophet I've
[1:14:34] watched that Malachi for your whole life
[1:14:37] amen I've watched it when is somebody
[1:14:39] gonna rise who can do a greater Ministry
[1:14:41] than brother brandom it's never risen
[1:14:43] they can't even get close like I told
[1:14:46] you Kenneth copen I remember watching
[1:14:47] that it was so sad he stood there and he
[1:14:48] said I stand as a prophet of God and I
[1:14:50] command uh Co to end in March of 2000
[1:14:56] and they're saying praise God it's over
[1:14:57] praise God it's over and it's still
[1:15:00] going he saysi he Saidi I stand in the
[1:15:03] office of a prophet of God that's no
[1:15:04] Prophet that's a false prophet that's a
[1:15:07] charlatan after your money bragging
[1:15:09] about how many uh private planes he
[1:15:12] has Jesus said you can't serve two
[1:15:14] masters either love one and hate the
[1:15:16] other you can't serve M and money and
[1:15:19] god let's serve God hallelujah
[1:15:22] amen third time he said Just remember
[1:15:25] sayith the Lord you'll never in any more
[1:15:27] Gentile Church age ever see a sign to
[1:15:30] succeed this go greater this is the last
[1:15:32] sign of the
[1:15:34] church in 1962 you'll never see another
[1:15:38] sign this is it thus sayith the Lord
[1:15:40] would a prophet of God make a statement
[1:15:42] like that if it wasn't true you're
[1:15:43] receiving your greatest sign your last
[1:15:45] sign before the appearing of Christ
[1:15:48] April 1964 this is the last sign
[1:15:50] remember thus sayith the Lord did you
[1:15:52] ever hear me say that but what it was
[1:15:53] true you're seeing your last sign this
[1:15:55] is scriptural you've seen your last sign
[1:15:57] Pentecost and I was raised in the
[1:15:59] Pentecostal church and I've seen the
[1:16:01] fall of the Pentecostal church and even
[1:16:03] no now more my my mom's still there we
[1:16:05] talk about it even she's seen the Fall
[1:16:07] Away from Holiness into sin and
[1:16:10] immorality even she's to this day she's
[1:16:12] 74 almost she still sees
[1:16:15] it and brother said th it's your last
[1:16:18] sign Pentecost the Pentecostal church
[1:16:20] should have accepted brother R's Bible
[1:16:22] teachings but they still wanted to live
[1:16:24] in sin they they didn't want to they
[1:16:25] didn't want to tally up and Obey God's
[1:16:27] word I saw it my mom saw it
[1:16:31] amen verse and then the last one I'm
[1:16:33] sorry not verse last quote
[1:16:36] 1965 remember Abraham and his group
[1:16:38] never received one more sign from God
[1:16:40] until the promised son arrived how many
[1:16:42] knows that's true that's that sign of
[1:16:44] discernment and the Royal Seed of
[1:16:45] Abraham let me hear you or let me tell
[1:16:47] you thus sayith the Lord you're
[1:16:49] receiving your last sign that's
[1:16:50] according to the scriptures and the
[1:16:52] revelation of God that's in my heart
[1:16:53] that speaks that this is the truth and
[1:16:56] the church said we have six thus saith
[1:17:01] the Lords that we've got the last sign
[1:17:03] before the Rapture it was brother Ram's
[1:17:05] Ministry that Jesus was doing through
[1:17:07] him Discerning the thoughts and intents
[1:17:10] telling them their secrets just like God
[1:17:11] told Sarah her secrets and then there
[1:17:15] and then there was a body change Church
[1:17:16] there's going to be a body change
[1:17:18] Hallelujah I hope we live to see it
[1:17:20] here's my last quote and I'm finished
[1:17:23] after this I'll be done right about
[1:17:24] about 12
[1:17:26] here I heard a preacher preach this
[1:17:28] brother Jose I thought you liked this
[1:17:30] one the church is going to be there
[1:17:32] without one spot or wrinkle how many can
[1:17:34] say Amen to that you're going to the
[1:17:36] church is going to be there that wise
[1:17:38] virgin was there
[1:17:40] right the grace of God will do that
[1:17:44] it'll have to it'll take Grace now what
[1:17:47] does he reference when he says you're
[1:17:49] going to be uh without spot Rinko in the
[1:17:50] Rapture what Bible verse does he
[1:17:52] reference Abraham and Sarah
[1:17:56] he like he talked to Abraham and Sarah
[1:17:57] doubt him well right then he could have
[1:18:00] slayed them right he could have slew
[1:18:02] Sarah right therefore for doubting him
[1:18:03] and laughing at his
[1:18:05] face because that's the worst sin there
[1:18:08] is is unbelief it's the only sin right
[1:18:10] unbelief is the real Sin they just don't
[1:18:12] believe God's
[1:18:14] word and she doubted and laughed within
[1:18:17] herself when the angel discerned her
[1:18:19] through the tent is that right but why
[1:18:22] couldn't he take Sarah because she's
[1:18:24] part of of Abraham he'd had to take
[1:18:27] Abraham too because they were
[1:18:29] one and we are part of Jesus when we're
[1:18:33] in the body of Christ
[1:18:35] Hallelujah not only church were are you
[1:18:38] the part of the body of Christ you were
[1:18:39] in the mind of Christ before the
[1:18:42] foundation if I was in his mind I could
[1:18:44] never get out amen if you're in his mind
[1:18:47] you'll never get out praise God your
