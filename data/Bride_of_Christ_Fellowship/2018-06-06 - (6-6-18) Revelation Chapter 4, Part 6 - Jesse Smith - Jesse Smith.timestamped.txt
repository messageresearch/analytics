[18:54] my wife is one day later on the 21st so
[18:56] I don't want to forget that one also
[19:01] again there's a women's retreat I
[19:03] emailed everybody about it a few days
[19:04] ago
[19:05] if anyone's interesting going it's just
[19:06] a bunch of women that go and they
[19:08] collect you their cellphones they
[19:10] collect your cell phones at check-in and
[19:12] now you can if you have children or
[19:14] things like that that lets you go down
[19:15] and check your cell phones but they
[19:16] actually collect your cell phones so you
[19:19] can just have the whole weekend to pray
[19:20] and hear the Word of God it's really
[19:21] really quite wonderful you know as I
[19:24] just been the preacher there one time
[19:25] but they've been doing it like 10 years
[19:27] now sir brother Vaughn asked me to
[19:29] preach again this September so I would
[19:32] like to do that so if anyone's
[19:35] interested let me know if you can't
[19:36] afford to let me know we could help you
[19:37] out by God's grace we want to support
[19:38] people seeking the Lord and hearing the
[19:40] Word of God if we possibly can and also
[19:44] on the email I did have to because of
[19:47] that meeting with Yvonne I had to adjust
[19:49] brother digs her brother digs will come
[19:51] the following Sunday September 30th so
[19:54] it's a long ways off but I just wanna
[19:55] let you know I don't know if you call it
[19:57] that on the email so brother bender
[19:59] ought to be here June 24th then we have
[20:02] our outreach services all July Jim
[20:04] shumake will be here on July 29th now if
[20:07] he's gonna preach the p.m. service if
[20:09] nobody comes but if somebody comes like
[20:11] a newcomer walks in because we sent out
[20:12] the postcards I think on the 18th of
[20:15] June if nobody new comes I'm just kind
[20:18] of Jim preach you know but if we have
[20:19] new people walk in here I'm sure I'll
[20:21] just preach the what I scheduled to
[20:22] preach and they can hear the word of God
[20:24] because it's all scheduled out and
[20:26] they're coming to hear that so I'm sure
[20:29] brother Jim will be okay with that then
[20:31] brother Keith Randolph will preach of
[20:32] Saturday night August 18th and then
[20:34] Sunday August 19th and then brother
[20:36] Diggs will preach to services on
[20:37] September 30th ok
[20:40] pardon me a few prayer requests here
[20:43] tonight please pray for my wife that you
[20:45] know she probably takes three naps a day
[20:46] she's so tired and worn out so just pray
[20:49] for her and the baby that they'll get a
[20:50] lotta rest by God's grace also a woman
[20:55] named Georgia emailed me and her her
[20:58] brother is addicted to alcohol and she
[21:00] said he he really needs deliverance so I
[21:03] don't know this woman but she wants our
[21:06] prayer so let's just pray that her
[21:07] brother gets deliverance from alcohol
[21:10] also an unspoken need for a brother the
[21:14] courts you know he's estranged from his
[21:16] wife or something he so he's not allowed
[21:18] to see his children ever so I just hold
[21:21] my pray for him tonight and he says I
[21:23] don't know if the Lord you know was
[21:25] punishing me I said well you got to seek
[21:27] his face you know then God will show you
[21:29] you know if it's a test or a punishment
[21:31] so let's pray for this unspoken need and
[21:34] then also Stephanie's friend Stacy I
[21:37] guess she's paralyzed now so whatever
[21:39] whatever was bothering her it's it's got
[21:43] worse so I don't know this woman but I
[21:45] asked I asked F&E can I come see her and
[21:47] she's like I don't know so I said let me
[21:49] know if I can come pray for her and then
[21:51] also a friend of mine named John tried
[21:54] to commit suicide but I guess he's
[21:56] recovering so again I asked for his
[21:58] information to come visit him at the
[21:59] hospital and they said they don't know
[22:00] if I can visit or not so I'm trying to
[22:02] go see these people but I don't know
[22:04] they're just not let me go anyways but
[22:06] we can pray if I can't go there
[22:08] physically we know the Holy Spirit can
[22:09] go to them any other prayer requests

[35:23] though there's so many details or so
[35:25] many scriptures he packs in there it's
[35:27] just a wonderful process but just a slow
[35:29] process and brother Graham said that's
[35:31] always what brother Brandon do he said I

[35:33] so we're fulfilling his desire to go
[35:36] slowly verse by verse through the Word
[35:38] of God and we're grateful for that
[35:40] tonight by God's grace verse five and
[35:42] out of the throne proceeded lightnings
[35:44] and thunderings and voices and there
[35:47] were seven lamps of fire burning before
[35:49] the throne which are the seven spirits
[35:52] of God and before the throne there was a
[35:55] sea of glass like unto crystal and the
[35:58] midst of the throne and round about the
[35:59] throne were four beasts full of eyes
[36:02] before and behind and the first beast
[36:06] was like a lion and the second beast
[36:08] like a calf and the third beast had a
[36:11] face as a man and the fourth beast was
[36:14] like a flying eagle and the four beasts
[36:17] had each of them six wings about him and
[36:19] they were full of eyes within and the
[36:21] rest I'm sorry and they rest not day and

[38:00] 6 of this series by God's grace part 76
[38:06] overall and I want to give an update the
[38:10] the final postcards got approved this
[38:13] week and I asked them to make this stand
[38:17] out but they did the cross instead and
[38:19] I'm like how many times I got to ask him
[38:20] so actually time ran out they had to
[38:22] print them so I just said just leave it
[38:23] as it is just said just send them out
[38:25] I've asked three times they still
[38:27] couldn't get it right so must have been
[38:29] that maybe it was the devil I don't know
[38:30] what it was but I wanted the pillar of
[38:32] fire this to stand out like that and
[38:35] they just couldn't get it but you know
[38:37] this is brother Rams the heart his you
[38:38] know crawling the cross was always on
[38:39] his mind anyway so I thought well you
[38:41] can't really lose anyway you know you
[38:42] got the pillar fire you got the cross so
[38:45] this will be the final one they send out
[38:47] and so in July I will be preaching at 4
[38:50] p.m. will preach thus saith the Lord for
[38:52] today during that service I'm going to
[38:54] show all that thus saith the Lord's
[38:55] brother Ram said about doctrines today
[38:58] that we need to apply today
[38:59] like Trinity he said Trinitarian em is
[39:01] of the devil thus saith the Lord all
[39:03] these things that we need right now
[39:04] today and then the Sunday after that
[39:07] we'll look at thus saith the Lord all
[39:08] the future thus say at the Lord you know
[39:10] about Russia you know science the seven
[39:13] major visions so if anybody gets this
[39:16] postcard and they want to come here that
[39:17] that's what we'll preach on that day
[39:20] July 15th we had preached on the power
[39:22] of Jesus Christ name through the Godhead
[39:24] water baptism casting out Devils
[39:27] everything's done in his name we could
[39:29] even show the seven compound were names
[39:32] compound names of Jehovah
[39:34] you know like brother Simon preached
[39:36] last time he was
[39:36] here we can preach that too and then
[39:39] July 22nd I want to show the 12 New
[39:40] Testament mysteries brother Branham
[39:42] preached and sirs
[39:43] is this the end time and then July 29th
[39:47] the book of Revelation revealed I just
[39:48] want to go a quick sermon about all
[39:52] these basically revealing all the things
[39:55] brother Branham taught about the book of
[39:57] Revelation and that remember that's the
[39:59] day brother of Jim schumake will be here
[40:00] so if nobody shows up you know we'll
[40:03] just let brother Jim preach that night
[40:04] but if people show up that are new
[40:06] they've never heard the message I want
[40:08] to preach that thought they're by God's
[40:10] grace amen so praise God amen we're just
[40:13] trying to go fishing you know
[40:14] one time it struck my heart you know and
[40:17] I thought well I'll never get any new
[40:18] fish if I don't go fishing right you're
[40:20] not gonna fish aren't just gonna jump
[40:22] into your house are they you got to go
[40:24] fishing so I'm trying to do some fishing
[40:26] here by God's grace so you know either
[40:28] way you know I don't I don't know if you
[40:30] ever heard his testimony but before
[40:32] before Simon and myself and this whole
[40:36] group there was about 40 people brother
[40:38] William that came into the message in
[40:40] Lima okay and it was around New Year
[40:44] 2000 2001 okay so there was like a
[40:48] little revival in Lima 40 people got
[40:51] baptized and most of them are still
[40:52] serving the Lord it was a little move of
[40:55] the holy small revival move of the Holy
[40:57] Spirit and to churches sprung out of it
[41:00] this is one and my brother cam searches
[41:02] the other so two churches have sprung
[41:04] out of it so God was just multiplying
[41:06] and it was all under brother Brooks's
[41:09] ministry there in Lima
[41:11] so anyways but the testimony behind that
[41:13] is that before that happened brother
[41:15] Craig and brother Dave Lewallen they
[41:18] sent out a church age book to every
[41:20] Church in Lima and they never heard back
[41:22] from one of them that's a lot of money
[41:25] and that was you know church age book
[41:26] was I think a dollar or two dollars at
[41:27] that time now it's eight dollars but
[41:29] that's a lot of money that's a lot of
[41:31] pastors to send the church age book to
[41:33] so they went fishing they never they
[41:35] never heard back but then I think a year
[41:38] or two after that that's when that
[41:39] revival struck so I'm not predicting
[41:41] your revival but I'm praying for a
[41:42] revival because we can't predict
[41:44] anything but the idea is we want to go
[41:46] fishing we want to see more soul saved
[41:49] now church if we know brother Rams
[41:52] message then I I lived an hour north of
[41:54] Lima brother I live in an hour north and
[41:56] I didn't even know there was a prophet I
[41:58] didn't even know there was a message of
[41:59] the hour I was just raised in Pentecost
[42:01] I thought all there was was miracles and
[42:03] speaking in tongues that's all I thought
[42:04] there was cuz I didn't know better but
[42:06] if brother barons message is right there
[42:08] was something inside of me there was a
[42:09] deep call to the deep and God knew I
[42:12] wanted the message even though I lived
[42:14] in our north of the message so God made
[42:17] away God you know had people witnessed
[42:19] and allowed us to drive down an hour to
[42:21] do Bible studies receive the message
[42:23] then God sent me all the way to Akron
[42:25] now we have a church here by God's grace
[42:26] so you know so we I take that same idea
[42:30] I don't know if there's anyone else in
[42:32] Akron who wants to know the message but
[42:34] I would have wanted someone to come to
[42:36] share the message with me so I'm
[42:38] thankful for those who did share with me
[42:40] now it's our responsibility to go take
[42:42] it to people who never heard it before
[42:44] amen so we're happy to do that that's
[42:46] what we want to do we're probably like
[42:48] $800 when it's all said and done maybe
[42:50] $900 to to do all that but most of it's
[42:52] already paid for
[42:53] and we appreciate any donations for that
[42:55] but our desire doesn't matter our
[42:57] desires just to get the gospel out
[42:58] praise God now let's look at our
[43:01] scripture this was our text this morning
[43:02] I'm sorry this evening sorry and the
[43:05] first thought brother BAM brings in this
[43:07] message is this again this thought about
[43:11] and out of the throne proceeded
[43:13] lightnings and thunderings this is in
[43:15] Revelation 4 verse 5 says and out of the
[43:18] throne proceeded lightnings and
[43:19] thunderings and voices and there were
[43:21] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[43:23] throne okay so
[43:26] brother Branham takes this up and he
[43:28] says he says oh I love this he said
[43:31] don't you
[43:32] he said let's speak on this throne now
[43:34] for a few minutes this is not a throne
[43:37] of mercy Mercy's throne is finished no
[43:39] more mercy house the judgment seat going
[43:42] to be the judgment seat of Christ the
[43:44] judgment seat
[43:45] he said the white throne judgment is
[43:47] there going to be mercy then and he says
[43:51] there's not one stitch or stretch of
[43:54] mercy to be given and that the judgment
[43:57] throne you could scream mercy until you
[43:59] couldn't scream anymore and you just
[44:01] might as well scream out in the air
[44:03] somewhere
[44:03] because there's no more mercy amen so in
[44:07] chapter 4 verse 5 we see a throne where
[44:10] there's no more mercy right it's a
[44:13] picture of after the rapture there's no
[44:14] more mercy to the Gentile people we know
[44:18] that and so the Bible says because John
[44:20] has come up as or a raptured person as
[44:23] the Bride of course is a type of the
[44:25] bride and there's lightnings and
[44:28] thunderings and voices and I just
[44:31] thought this was interesting brother
[44:32] bands that there's not one stretch of
[44:34] mercy to be given God's not going to
[44:38] give anyone any mercy at the white
[44:40] throne judgment but God told us what
[44:43] he's going to give them at the white
[44:44] throne judgement let's go to Revelation
[44:45] 20 verse 12 there is no more mercy God
[44:50] is not judging by mercy at the white
[44:52] throne judgment he's judging by
[44:54] something else amen and the Bible tells
[44:56] us that revelation 20 verse 12 and I saw
[44:59] the dead small and great stand before
[45:02] God I think about it Donald Trump will
[45:06] stand there think about that Barack
[45:08] Obama all these men and women will stand
[45:12] there this the small and great will
[45:14] stand before God and the books rope and
[45:17] another book was opened which is the
[45:18] book of life and the dead were judged
[45:20] out of those things which are written in
[45:22] the books according to their works amen
[45:26] there is no mercy here God is not
[45:30] judging and say well I'll just have
[45:31] mercy God is saying you are going to be
[45:33] judged by what you did
[45:36] plain and simple there's there's no
[45:38] other there's no other there's no more
[45:40] second chances this is only based upon
[45:44] what you did on the earth oh my how how
[45:47] every moment is important they meant hi
[45:50] every moment we must be seeking the
[45:52] leadership of the Lord and the grace of
[45:54] God to make sure that our works glorify
[45:56] God amen there's no mercy here it's only
[46:00] did you do it or did you not what are
[46:03] the books say one of the records say
[46:05] were you good to the bride or not is
[46:08] that right where you're good to the
[46:10] brunt that's what are you to the least
[46:12] of these my brother if you've done it to
[46:14] the least of the Christians the least of
[46:16] the
[46:17] then you've done it unto Christ and
[46:18] they're judged by works look at verse 13
[46:21] and the sea gave up the Dead which were
[46:24] in it and the and death and he'll
[46:26] delivered up the Dead which were in them
[46:28] why there's the death angel and they
[46:31] judged every man according again to
[46:34] their works their works right and death
[46:39] and he'll were cast into the lake of
[46:40] fire
[46:41] this is the second death and whosoever
[46:44] was not found written a book of life was
[46:46] cast into the lake of fire
[46:48] there's not one stretch of mercy given
[46:52] and they're judged by their works now
[46:57] the Prophet said now is the day of mercy
[46:59] he said the reason today's the day of
[47:02] mercy is because the mercy seat is
[47:05] sprinkled with an atonement blood and as
[47:08] long as blood is on the judgement seat
[47:10] then there's no judgment no more it's
[47:12] mercy because something died to stay
[47:15] judgment as long as blood is on the
[47:18] mercy seat it showed that something died
[47:20] to hold judgment back but when the
[47:23] church's raptured the mercy seat becomes
[47:26] a judgment seat
[47:27] Abraham said Adam and Eve made as good
[47:30] an apron as any Methodist Baptist
[47:32] Presbyterian or Pentecostal could make
[47:35] it cover their nakedness but God could
[47:37] see through it so he killed something
[47:39] and took the dead skins of the dead
[47:41] animal and covered it blood had to take
[47:44] its place
[47:45] amen so fig leaf or blood fig leaf or
[47:49] blood a church a church of pretend
[47:53] experience or blood every time we must
[47:56] choose the blood amen we can't choose
[47:58] the cover well I made a mistake this
[48:00] week I've just covered over it and I'm
[48:02] sure God will forget about God does not
[48:04] forget about it we can't cover over any
[48:06] of our decisions or any of our mistakes
[48:08] with the fig leaf a man-made covering or
[48:11] a man produced idea it's all got to come
[48:14] through the blood of Christ and he says
[48:17] think of it the only thing that'll back
[48:19] off God from judgment is blood and
[48:22] there's only one blood that he'll back
[48:24] from and that's his own son when he sees
[48:27] that his own son's blood he'll back off
[48:30] and brother Mannis the old brother I
[48:32] don't never want to stand there at the
[48:34] white throne judgment
[48:35] look at this he said let me stand before
[48:37] a machine-gun I'd rather stand before
[48:40] machine-gun he said let me be cut to
[48:43] pieces let me be sawed inch by inch can
[48:48] you imagine look at he said let anything
[48:51] happen let them split open my belly and
[48:54] burn sulfur and everything else in me he
[48:56] said let my arms and legs be cut off
[48:58] whatever but never let me stand at the
[49:01] white throne judgment before God all
[49:03] right because you're not given any mercy
[49:06] it's just the works that you did and huh
[49:09] me knowing that it's hard without the
[49:11] Holy Spirit's hard to do any works honey
[49:13] no without the Holy Spirit you can't do
[49:15] any good works we have nothing he says
[49:18] let anything be done to me just don't
[49:20] let me stand before the white throne
[49:22] judgment oh my god help us to make sure
[49:25] our works glorify Christ amen then it's
[49:28] him working through us and not us doing
[49:32] it ourselves amen now to back this up
[49:34] brother Ram me you know the lightening
[49:36] of Thunder we went through this a few
[49:37] weeks ago but I'm just gonna skip over a
[49:39] little bit well Ram said the the mercy
[49:43] seat here in Revelation 4 is no longer
[49:47] there's no longer blood there he said
[49:49] because there's lightnings and
[49:50] thunderings and he said real blood on
[49:52] the mercy seat was found in Leviticus 16
[49:55] on the Day of Atonement which I'm sure
[49:57] you're familiar with on the day of
[50:00] atonement one time a year Aaron could go
[50:02] in there and he can offer blood upon the
[50:05] mercy seat and then God would forgive
[50:07] everybody for the all their years sins
[50:10] they men by one man entering behind the
[50:13] veil and the Bible says now that Jesus
[50:16] has entered behind the veil in heaven
[50:18] amen and the Bible said now he
[50:21] sanctifies all of us because Jesus was
[50:24] sanctified he who was sanctified can now
[50:27] sanctify us amen and he's gone behind
[50:30] the veil in heaven we'd say hallelujah
[50:33] mmm said what Aaron did he sprinkled
[50:36] blood on the mercy seat and the mercy
[50:39] seat is the altar where you kneel and
[50:42] ask for mercy now look at this
[50:44] Ronit said god forbid we ever take it
[50:47] out of our churches the old-fashioned
[50:50] altar where men can kneel and call on
[50:53] God for mercy and mercy is rich and
[50:57] flowing free from the blood of the Lord
[51:00] Jesus amen
[51:02] I don't care how small our churches I
[51:04] don't care how small we get or how big
[51:07] we get there's always going to be an
[51:08] altar in this church because of that
[51:11] quote right there he said god forbid
[51:14] that we ever take the altar out of the
[51:17] church where people can come and find
[51:19] salvation and find mercy flowing richly
[51:23] to them amen if you haven't visited this
[51:26] altar lately I'd encourage you to visit
[51:27] the altar right I try to visit it every
[51:30] week by God's grace and keep visiting it
[51:33] because this is a place they don't have
[51:35] to be here but the point is we have to
[51:37] understand that there's a place where we
[51:39] must find mercy but we've got to go
[51:41] there praise God we can't just well I
[51:43] know it's there and not visit it right
[51:46] like a horse taken to the water but not
[51:48] drink it they got to know they got to do
[51:49] more than just go to the water they got
[51:51] to partake in the water and we've got a
[51:53] partake of God's mercy we've got an
[51:55] experience God mercy we've got to feel
[51:58] that we're forgiven we've got to come to
[52:00] church and leave feeling washed feeling
[52:03] clean feeling new again feeling it on
[52:05] fire for Christ again he said god forbid
[52:08] that we ever take it out of our churches
[52:11] this old-fashioned altar so this is a he
[52:14] said this is just a simple
[52:15] representation of the mercy seat that's
[52:18] in heaven where the rich flowing mercy
[52:21] of God comes down to us through the
[52:23] blood of Jesus amen
[52:25] oh I'm so grateful for that but brother
[52:28] says look at revelation boy said notice
[52:30] it is not mercy there's lightnings
[52:34] thunderings and voices and then he goes
[52:37] to Exodus 19 now we read this a few
[52:39] weeks ago but let's go to 1921 because I
[52:42] just want to this thought brother
[52:44] branham pulled out here I just really
[52:45] liked it
[52:49] rivarly I'm sure
[52:51] Exodus 1921 pardon me I'd never heard
[52:54] him say this before this was really nice
[52:59] you know the story you know God warns
[53:01] them and he says don't let any animals
[53:03] come you know before the mountain
[53:05] they'll be struck dead he warns them
[53:07] about his holiness he told them to wash
[53:09] themselves for three days she bought
[53:11] four hands so they're their holy unto
[53:13] the Lord now look at verse 21 Exodus 19
[53:18] 21 now brother ham reads this that he
[53:21] may and let's read it and then I'll read
[53:23] his comments we're focusing on the word
[53:26] gaze look at this he says and the Lord
[53:28] came down upon Mount Sinai on the top of
[53:31] the mount verse 20 and the Lord called
[53:33] Moses up to the top of the mount and
[53:35] Moses went up verse 21 and the Lord said
[53:37] unto Moses go down charge the people
[53:39] lest they break through unto the Lord to
[53:42] gaze and many of them perish now it's
[53:47] interesting brother ram starts preaching
[53:48] on this idea of gazing so God was
[53:51] concerned I don't want people just
[53:52] coming to the mountain because they see
[53:54] my pillar of fire my cloud and they see
[53:57] all this supernatural there he said I
[53:59] don't want people just coming up and
[54:01] just gazing and just kind of looking at
[54:03] it and walking away God doesn't want any
[54:07] half-hearted curious scientific minds
[54:10] trying to study his glory and the church
[54:13] said well they have said look he said
[54:16] people will gaze today he said people
[54:18] sit back in the church and laugh as
[54:21] somebody speaking with tongues or laugh
[54:24] at people dancing in the spirit he said
[54:26] they've gone and blasting the Holy Ghost
[54:28] sealed forever
[54:29] whosoever speaks a word against the Holy
[54:31] Ghost will never be forgiven this world
[54:33] neither in the world to come
[54:34] he said don't gaze upon it he says stay
[54:39] away from it or either accept it I'm
[54:42] glad I've accepted it amen
[54:43] I didn't come to the message to gaze and
[54:46] just kind of wonder what that picture is
[54:47] all about it wonder what that Holy Ghost
[54:49] is all about
[54:50] I wonder the Holy Ghost and me praise
[54:52] God but God warns them do not come to
[54:56] gays this is not just something you look
[54:58] at and examine well maybe I'll do it
[55:00] someday maybe I won't that's not how we
[55:02] come to God we come
[55:04] we sell out everything we leave all the
[55:07] things in the world behind like Elijah
[55:08] we kill all the oxen that we used to
[55:11] work with we cut ourselves free from
[55:13] every contact anyone in the world we cut
[55:16] ourselves free from that we come to
[55:17] Christ with all of our hearts amen
[55:19] just don't come in gaze on it experience
[55:23] it praise God amen that's exactly right
[55:26] now if one commentary I read said this
[55:30] and I really liked he said Moses is
[55:32] warning not to gaze at the Lord on
[55:35] penalty of death
[55:36] shows God's concern to protect the
[55:39] Israelites and to reveal to them his
[55:42] awesome personal reality in other words
[55:45] God was going to protect them I'm going
[55:47] to protect you because he Scott is
[55:49] saying I have a powerful presence amen
[55:52] my presence is holy right remember Jesus
[55:56] presidents were so holy that John fell
[55:58] down like he was dead that's how holy is
[56:01] so God was going to protect them
[56:03] you don't walk around in gays and try to
[56:05] play with the Lord show me America do
[56:07] something fancy show me some fire I want
[56:09] to see a lick of fire you don't come to
[56:10] God like that God's trying to protect
[56:12] you from that he says God cannot be
[56:15] treated as an object of curiosity that
[56:18] one might walk up to examine it will and
[56:22] then walk away from without personal
[56:24] engagement see God doesn't want people
[56:27] that just come to observe him and learn
[56:29] about him just to kind of know about it
[56:31] God wants people to come to him that
[56:33] want to love him and serve him amen
[56:36] they wouldn't experience a relationship
[56:38] with Jesus Christ amen so God was
[56:41] protecting them remember when Moses came
[56:43] the burning bush and brother Branham
[56:44] said he didn't come like a scientist
[56:47] saying well I'm gonna take some of those
[56:49] burnt leaves that are not myrrh and I'm
[56:51] gonna take him back to the laboratory
[56:52] and see why they're not burning
[56:55] he didn't come that way and that's what
[56:57] God's saying here you don't come to just
[56:59] gaze upon it and try to learn something
[57:00] intellectual you come here to listen you
[57:03] come to church to hear the word of God
[57:05] to obey the Word of God to surrender to
[57:09] make yourself a living sacrifice to the
[57:11] voice of God amen
[57:13] that's why we come to church because
[57:16] that's what the boy said take off your
[57:17] shoes
[57:18] and the brother band said if he took off
[57:19] his hat he would have done wrong God's
[57:21] very specific if the Bible says this we
[57:24] need to do what the Bible says the Bible
[57:26] says something else what the Bible says
[57:28] God's very specific God has a very easy
[57:31] approach and it's just simply through
[57:33] obedience to the Word of God glory so
[57:39] it's not just a gaze well well that
[57:40] person is crying and shouting and that's
[57:44] pretty neat when the preacher cries and
[57:46] glorifies the Lord and tries to rejoice
[57:49] and the he casts out Devils and prays
[57:51] for the sick that's kind of neat I want
[57:53] maybe some day that could happen to me
[57:54] that's the wrong approach amen
[57:57] the right approach is God I believe it's
[58:00] real I'm gonna support it with all my
[58:02] heart O Lord and then it happened to me
[58:04] let me be a part of it I'm not here to
[58:06] be curious I'm here to receive Amen so
[58:10] Braham gives us this thought if they
[58:13] come that way it's possible they can be
[58:15] sealed out of the kingdom of God forever
[58:16] for laughing at speaking in tongues
[58:18] blaspheming dancing in the spirit
[58:21] blaspheming emotion and all these things
[58:23] if they do any of they blaspheme any of
[58:25] that just gaze upon it and walk away
[58:27] brother and so they can be cut out of
[58:29] the kingdom of God forever oh my how
[58:33] merciful is God now the second thought
[58:38] he gives is on the voices which are some
[58:41] of us are familiar with here but let's
[58:42] just go through it I don't I don't think
[58:43] I preaches too much here revelation 4:5
[58:47] and all the throne proceeded lightnings
[58:48] and thunderings and voices now brother
[58:52] said the voice on the throne he says
[58:55] notice it's not voice you see but Ram
[58:57] says voices he said not one voice voices
[59:02] plural he says what what is it he said
[59:06] it's God speaking to the church
[59:09] reflecting himself through seven spirits
[59:12] mother and said those voices are God
[59:15] speaking through the seven spirits and
[59:17] we know the seven spirits of God are the
[59:19] ministries that God gave to the seven
[59:21] churches messengers how we know that
[59:23] these are voices Bellaire said when the
[59:26] true anointed of God speaks it's the
[59:29] voice of God to read
[59:31] it is to remove the candlestick now it's
[59:33] pretty serious brother Adam and I were
[59:35] talking about this before service it's
[59:36] pretty serious if people won't listen to
[59:38] brother branham that's pretty serious if
[59:40] you don't have enough love and grace in
[59:42] your heart to listen to the man of God
[59:44] something's wrong with your walk with
[59:46] God is that right we were talking about
[59:49] that and it's so true people that we
[59:50] won't listen to brother Branham they're
[59:52] scared to listen to do it why would they
[59:54] be scared they're scared because there's
[59:55] light there's fire there's life coming
[59:58] out of that voice that's the voice of
[1:00:01] God coming out of that voice we hear the
[1:00:03] voice I've got enough don't get it mixed
[1:00:05] up don't worship brother Bram his
[1:00:07] literal voice wasn't the voice of God
[1:00:08] when he spoke the word then it's God's
[1:00:11] voice coming to us when he's just
[1:00:14] thinking and sharing his thoughts and
[1:00:15] his ideas that's just the man but when
[1:00:17] he gives us a scripture or gives us a
[1:00:19] thus saith the Lord or gives us
[1:00:20] something that the Holy Ghost told him
[1:00:22] now the voice of God has spoken Newhouse
[1:00:24] Amen that's exactly right
[1:00:28] so yes the voice of God was in brother
[1:00:32] Branham but now remember the church his
[1:00:33] book says now the voice is in the bride
[1:00:35] and the voice of God can be in you
[1:00:39] whether you're a man or woman preacher
[1:00:41] or not the voice of God can be in any of
[1:00:43] us when we say what God wants us to say
[1:00:45] it's exactly right so Bob Arum says this
[1:00:52] he says now everybody can't be a
[1:00:54] preacher but you got a voice if you
[1:00:56] can't preach a sermon he said if you're
[1:00:59] a preacher you're called to preach to
[1:01:01] the Pope at the pulpit if you're not
[1:01:03] you're still a preacher but live the
[1:01:05] people a sermon let your sermon be live
[1:01:09] and it's the voice of God that will
[1:01:11] bring reproach to them who reject it
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] so brother M said we're all preachers we
[1:01:19] all preach and declare the gospel some
[1:01:21] way or another by our lives right a
[1:01:24] member in in heaven in Revelation 4 the
[1:01:27] voices are thundering out in judgment
[1:01:30] and brother have said your life will
[1:01:33] Thunder out judgment against all those
[1:01:35] who reject it that you spent time around
[1:01:38] amen he says and they say no one can
[1:01:44] put a finger on his or her life they're
[1:01:46] sweet they're loving if there ever was a
[1:01:48] man of God it's that man or that woman
[1:01:51] see live your sermons
[1:01:53] don't try to preach them if you're not
[1:01:55] called to be a preacher you'll get all
[1:01:56] mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll
[1:01:58] get people tangled up
[1:02:00] well you ruin them and yourself to just
[1:02:02] live your sermon the preachers called to
[1:02:05] preach his and to live it too if you
[1:02:07] can't live it then you stop preaching it
[1:02:09] but you're supposed to live your sermons
[1:02:11] hey man glory he said this is a quote
[1:02:16] you're very familiar with he said all
[1:02:17] right places oh how we need in
[1:02:19] jeffersonville thousands of live voices
[1:02:22] the Thunder of God thundering out in
[1:02:25] sweetness and holiness and purity
[1:02:29] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:02:32] earth today without a blemish yes real
[1:02:34] Christians that's thunder against the
[1:02:38] enemy can the church say Amen glory see
[1:02:43] all these people that you know that got
[1:02:44] mixed up on the thunders they get mixed
[1:02:46] up on all these other things and they're
[1:02:48] they get so mad if you don't see their
[1:02:50] revelation well that's not that the
[1:02:51] quote says you have sweetness when you
[1:02:53] got the thunder of God and they'll cut
[1:02:56] you out of the church and snow you're
[1:02:57] not part of the message and you're not
[1:02:59] you don't see it my way you're not going
[1:03:00] the rapture and you don't follow my
[1:03:02] pastor or not going the rapture
[1:03:03] something's wrong with that because this
[1:03:05] life thunders out sweetness thunders out
[1:03:08] forgiveness and mercy and patience was
[1:03:11] it thundering out the fruits of the Holy
[1:03:13] Spirit in other words the life of Christ
[1:03:15] amen that's just one idea that's just
[1:03:19] one way it expresses itself in the
[1:03:22] expression of Jesus Christ character
[1:03:25] amen the devil don't care how loud you
[1:03:28] can holler the devil don't care how much
[1:03:30] you can jump or how much you can do this
[1:03:31] or shout but what hurts the devil how
[1:03:34] many one heard the devil but what hurts
[1:03:37] the devil is to see that sanctified holy
[1:03:40] life consecrated to God
[1:03:44] ha ha ha he said say anything to them
[1:03:50] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:03:54] can be and move right on oh my
[1:03:57] that throws them away that's the thunder
[1:03:59] that shakes the devil you can say
[1:04:03] anything oh brother Jesse you know you
[1:04:05] look pretty ugly tonight or you're the
[1:04:08] worst preacher I've ever heard and if I
[1:04:10] got the life of Christ I can say well
[1:04:12] praise the Lord anyhow god bless you
[1:04:14] have a good night you know can I help
[1:04:17] you with anything you need any help
[1:04:18] after church here can help you see
[1:04:21] that's the real Christian when you can
[1:04:23] and that thunders against safety because
[1:04:26] that's what the Bible says do not
[1:04:27] overcome evil by evil but overcome evil
[1:04:30] with good amen and when you bless those
[1:04:34] who curse us Bible says like pouring
[1:04:36] coals of fire upon their head so when
[1:04:38] you bless them back you are making the
[1:04:41] devil mad amen you cause up the devil's
[1:04:44] in that person that said evil to you and
[1:04:46] now you're making them feel bad because
[1:04:48] you're living holy praise God and that
[1:04:51] shake that hurts the devil the Bible
[1:04:53] that's what I said it hurts the devil
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:57] Oh glory well the band said I don't care
[1:05:02] if you can preach like Oral Roberts or
[1:05:03] Billy Graham he said God don't pay no
[1:05:06] attention to anything that I get he says
[1:05:08] the devil just sit back and laugh but
[1:05:10] the devil sees the life that you live he
[1:05:14] sees how we treat our brothers and
[1:05:15] sisters doesn't he he sees how we treat
[1:05:17] sinners who sin against us at work or at
[1:05:20] school right he sees how we treat them
[1:05:22] and that's the real life of Christ amen
[1:05:28] program gives the example necks of the
[1:05:30] disciples trying to cast out the demon
[1:05:32] you know the child and they couldn't do
[1:05:33] it and brother Bram said see he said
[1:05:37] look he said Jesus come real quietly
[1:05:40] after that he said Jesus walked walked
[1:05:41] up real quietly and just cast the demon
[1:05:44] off he said he knowed he had a he said
[1:05:48] he said not only a sermon but Jesus had
[1:05:50] a life not only a sermon he said come
[1:05:53] out of him that done it quietly he knows
[1:05:55] what he was talking about he knows what
[1:05:57] he's doing so Jesus must have been
[1:05:59] praying even more quietly than the
[1:06:01] disciples get out of their devil get out
[1:06:04] of there they just couldn't do it they
[1:06:06] said all your disciples couldn't cast
[1:06:08] him out Jesus walk right down there real
[1:06:10] quiet I said
[1:06:11] devil leave go like he said you know
[1:06:14] like what the maniac of gather or
[1:06:15] something like that
[1:06:16] go devil command you to leave and it
[1:06:18] listened to him because of the life that
[1:06:21] he lived amen that's what we need Church
[1:06:24] we need the voice of God living through
[1:06:26] us praise the Lord now program gives us
[1:06:30] another thought on this in the church
[1:06:31] age book well Adam said there's voices
[1:06:34] he says what is uh what is uh
[1:06:37] so he says waters represent multitudes
[1:06:40] of voices according to revelation 17 15
[1:06:43] he says what is it waters he says our
[1:06:47] voices of multitudes of witnesses who by
[1:06:51] the Holy Spirit all through the ages has
[1:06:53] testified to Christ and preaches gospel
[1:06:56] it will be the voice of every man rising
[1:07:00] in judgment against the sinner who would
[1:07:03] not take warning so now we see
[1:07:05] lightnings thunderings and voices and
[1:07:08] with the by brother Aaron tells us these
[1:07:10] voices are the lives and the voices of
[1:07:13] the seven messengers but now Bertram
[1:07:15] tells us also these are the voices of
[1:07:17] all the believers amen so your voice is
[1:07:20] in that voice amen he said the voices of
[1:07:25] the seven message will be heard loud and
[1:07:27] clear those faithful preachers who
[1:07:29] preach the saving power of Jesus who
[1:07:31] preached water baptism in Jesus name
[1:07:33] who preached the infilling and power of
[1:07:35] the Holy Ghost who stood with the word
[1:07:38] more than they stood with their own
[1:07:40] lives but have said all of them were the
[1:07:45] voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:47] down through the ages now notice all of
[1:07:51] them so people that worship brother
[1:07:52] Brandon said he's the only voice of God
[1:07:54] he's that's wrong because brother
[1:07:56] Branham said all seven of them were
[1:07:58] voices of God down through the age see
[1:08:01] now somebody that lot worship another
[1:08:02] brand they'll get upset with you read
[1:08:04] this because brother branham's the voice
[1:08:06] he's the only voice of God but see what
[1:08:09] the Prophet teaches us is that all seven
[1:08:12] had the voice of God amen
[1:08:14] which is right hallelujah
[1:08:18] now let's move to the next thought here
[1:08:20] by the grace Lourdes this is one we
[1:08:22] already went over
[1:08:24] I'm sorry let me go back yeah the
[1:08:27] spirits of God is yeah you're familiar
[1:08:29] this but brother Aaron tells us here he
[1:08:30] said these seven spirits is not
[1:08:33] altogether meaning that God is seven
[1:08:35] spirits but the seven manifestations of
[1:08:37] the same Holy Spirit amen so these seven
[1:08:41] lamps are actually manifestations of the
[1:08:43] one Holy Spirit one spirit manifested in
[1:08:47] seven ways and then program tells us the
[1:08:49] seven spirits before the throat is the
[1:08:52] spirit that was in each of the seven
[1:08:54] messengers giving them their ministries
[1:08:57] for the age in which they lived
[1:08:59] praise God so it's one spirit manifested
[1:09:02] in seven ways just like there's one Holy
[1:09:05] Spirit who has nine gifts of the Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit program tell us the same thing
[1:09:09] there's one Holy Spirit but he has nine
[1:09:11] different gifts an operation for the
[1:09:13] congregation right there's one Holy
[1:09:15] Spirit he's got five preaching gifts for
[1:09:17] the church it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:09:20] praise God now let's go the next thought
[1:09:24] that's just a short one because I
[1:09:26] preached on that before most supposed to
[1:09:29] premiere with that one now here's a sea
[1:09:30] of glass this is the one I had not
[1:09:31] preached much on maybe if you've heard
[1:09:33] on it you may be heard more preaching I
[1:09:35] have on it but you know I'm a pastor I
[1:09:37] can't preach on everything so I finally
[1:09:39] got to this by the grace of Lord so
[1:09:41] revelation 4:6 this sea of glass and
[1:09:45] before the throne was a sea of glass
[1:09:47] like unto crystal and the myths of the
[1:09:51] throne and round about the throne were
[1:09:53] four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:09:57] behind now let's read this here now
[1:10:01] brother Branham is going to start
[1:10:02] talking about the Laver here so in
[1:10:05] heaven there's a sea of glass what
[1:10:07] partner in heaven there's a sea a glass
[1:10:10] but Moses saw first you know in the
[1:10:14] vision of heaven and then he brought it
[1:10:15] down to earth so this is what the sea of
[1:10:17] glass represents here on the earth but
[1:10:19] the sea of glass that john saw was of
[1:10:22] course in heaven program said the sea of
[1:10:25] glass is symbolized in the old temple
[1:10:27] for moses he was commanded of god to
[1:10:30] build the temple on earth like he saw in
[1:10:32] the heavens he said everyone knows that
[1:10:35] he said he say
[1:10:37] you have the outer court that inner
[1:10:39] court the holiest of Holies he said the
[1:10:41] outer court the next place here was the
[1:10:43] altar which was called the holy place
[1:10:47] okay no he's talking about in here the
[1:10:48] holy place he said but right before that
[1:10:51] was the sea of brass and that's where
[1:10:53] we're getting that here he's teaching on
[1:10:54] the sea of brass now in other words it's
[1:10:57] the place where the sacrifice was washed
[1:10:59] before they received on the altar at the
[1:11:03] brass altar the brazen altar where the
[1:11:05] sacrifice was burned but Aram said it
[1:11:09] was sent along about like this here was
[1:11:11] the sea of brass it was a Laver made out
[1:11:14] of brass where they washed the
[1:11:16] sacrifices he says before the sacrifices
[1:11:21] was burnt or accepted they had to be
[1:11:24] washed but man said Oh wouldn't that
[1:11:28] make a sermon right now doctor he said
[1:11:30] oh my he said oh he said it just strike
[1:11:34] me wash them before any sacrifice is
[1:11:38] received to God it's first got to be
[1:11:41] washed
[1:11:42] how not emotionally but washed by the
[1:11:47] word before we can ever come to God with
[1:11:50] true faith we first got to come by the
[1:11:53] waters of separation yes sir you've got
[1:11:55] to come by what the word now I preached
[1:12:00] this at Sheffield and I preached it here
[1:12:01] at numerous times before you could even
[1:12:03] come in here outside of here you had to
[1:12:07] be sprinkle with the waters of
[1:12:08] separation how many know that before you
[1:12:10] could even come in here before God would
[1:12:12] even receive your sin offering or your
[1:12:15] burnt offering or your drink offering
[1:12:17] before God would receive anything from
[1:12:19] you you had to be sprinkled with the
[1:12:22] blood of the red heifer which was mixed
[1:12:24] of course with ashes then it became the
[1:12:26] waters of separation how many know that
[1:12:27] by God's grace you couldn't even come
[1:12:30] here you could even you couldn't even
[1:12:31] enjoy the benefits of the outer core
[1:12:34] unless you got sprinkled first amen and
[1:12:37] that sprinkling meant now you're
[1:12:39] separated from anything that's dead
[1:12:41] anything that's unclean you're now
[1:12:44] sprinkle from that and you had to wait
[1:12:46] seven days after being sprinkled the
[1:12:48] first time a whole complete seven
[1:12:51] you had to be completely clean by
[1:12:52] sprinkling praise God amen
[1:12:55] you got a bath on the third day that you
[1:12:56] had to wait to the seventh day to
[1:12:58] actually come in here to church service
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:00] you had to wait a whole week before you
[1:13:02] got to come into church to make sure
[1:13:04] you're cleaning stock amen to make sure
[1:13:06] you were really sanctified hallelujah
[1:13:08] amen and once you were sprinkled out
[1:13:12] here and you waited a whole week now you
[1:13:15] could bring your sacrifice here to the
[1:13:18] priests and look they all got their
[1:13:20] sacrifices here the priests are gonna
[1:13:21] cut him and rightly divide them you know
[1:13:23] on the tables and everything like that
[1:13:24] they're gonna burn them percent them
[1:13:26] before God most of us are pretty
[1:13:29] familiar with that but brother him said
[1:13:32] oh it struck me he said before and he
[1:13:36] says this before any sacrifice is
[1:13:38] received by God it's first got to be
[1:13:42] washed amen
[1:13:43] now once you go to Exodus 3 let's turn
[1:13:46] it on your Bibles I'm gonna probably
[1:13:47] finish the sermon with this thought here
[1:13:48] give me about 20 more minutes or so by
[1:13:50] God's grace I'll do 30 minutes Exodus 30
[1:13:54] verse 17 this is quite a thought that
[1:13:57] struck brother Branham and I and this
[1:13:58] just kind of opened up to me today I
[1:14:00] never really understood this here until
[1:14:01] today
[1:14:12] Exodus 30 17 and the Lord spake unto
[1:14:15] Moses saying thou shalt also make a
[1:14:17] labor of brass and his foot also of
[1:14:20] brass to wash with all so I just want to
[1:14:25] let me skip ahead here this is the
[1:14:26] Salomon this is a model of Solomon's so
[1:14:28] this is the labor and then there's a
[1:14:30] foot now this is Solomon's this isn't
[1:14:32] Moses's okay but Moses this was a
[1:14:34] smaller version this is from the brazen
[1:14:37] sea of Solomon's Temple now and just so
[1:14:40] you this is this is what I learned new
[1:14:42] today they would not dip the sacrifices
[1:14:45] in there because that would pollute all
[1:14:46] the rest of the water so they had the
[1:14:49] Laver but then they had a foot even in
[1:14:51] Moses day they had a foot where they
[1:14:53] would they would take this water and
[1:14:54] then pour the running water over the
[1:14:56] sacrifice okay so that's what we see
[1:14:59] there and that really helped me to
[1:15:01] understand there that God always had
[1:15:03] running water because remember God even
[1:15:05] told Moses always wash your hands under
[1:15:07] running water right because the disease
[1:15:10] will spread if you don't have running
[1:15:12] water honey like the running water the
[1:15:14] holy spirit amen
[1:15:15] when God sends a good Holy Ghost shower
[1:15:17] amen it's a fresh shower a rain of Holy
[1:15:20] Ghost power down from heaven amen not to
[1:15:23] worry about any contamination you're
[1:15:25] just gonna enjoy the blessings of God
[1:15:26] amen that's right now let me go back to
[1:15:31] that scripture here I'll go back to this
[1:15:33] picture so there must be a foot down
[1:15:35] here at the bottom where they could take
[1:15:36] water and may pour it upon sacrifices
[1:15:40] but notice here also verse 18 and thou
[1:15:43] shalt put it between the tabernacle of
[1:15:46] the congregation and the altar and thou
[1:15:47] shalt put water therein for Aaron and
[1:15:51] his son shall wash their hands and their
[1:15:53] feet there at when they go into the
[1:15:58] tabernacle of the congregation which we
[1:15:59] the boots which I'm sorry which would be
[1:16:01] the holy place they shall wash with
[1:16:03] water that they die not or when they
[1:16:07] come near to the altar to minister to
[1:16:09] burn off frame made by fire unto the
[1:16:12] Lord is that striking the priest before
[1:16:15] they could come here to minister they've
[1:16:17] got a wash before they could go to their
[1:16:19] minister they've got a wash so washing
[1:16:22] was required before they tried to do
[1:16:24] anything for God
[1:16:26] I like that honey no you're a king and a
[1:16:28] priest here tonight these scriptures
[1:16:31] should be speaking to you if I wanna do
[1:16:33] something to God I got to make sure my
[1:16:35] hands and my feet are washed by the
[1:16:37] waters of the word I haven't touched I
[1:16:40] haven't handled dirty things I haven't
[1:16:42] handled dead things I haven't walked in
[1:16:45] dead pass amen
[1:16:46] my feet are clean I've walked in the way
[1:16:49] of the gospel hallelujah
[1:16:51] look at verse 20
[1:16:54] I'm sorry ready to already read 20 verse
[1:16:56] 21 so they shall wash their hands and
[1:17:00] their feet that they die not and there
[1:17:02] shall be a statute forever to them even
[1:17:04] to him and to his seed throughout their
[1:17:07] generations so before any worship before
[1:17:10] any person out here in these think of
[1:17:13] these dear people they just come to
[1:17:15] church and they just want to be forgiven
[1:17:17] hallelujah
[1:17:19] is that how you came to church tonight I
[1:17:20] just want to be right with God how many
[1:17:22] came that way I just want to be right
[1:17:24] with God before these priests can help
[1:17:26] any of these dear people their lives had
[1:17:29] to be cleaned out amen
[1:17:31] before you and I can help anybody we've
[1:17:34] got to be right with God amen and not
[1:17:39] only that but now go to Leviticus 1
[1:17:40] verse 8 if you got your Bibles Leviticus
[1:17:43] 1 verse 8 we'll be reading a few
[1:17:44] scriptures here so
[1:17:52] any person could be helped by a priest
[1:17:56] they had to wash their hands in their
[1:17:58] feet my works have to make sure all my
[1:18:02] works are pure before God I've got to
[1:18:05] make sure every path I've walked in
[1:18:07] today has been God's pleasure and now
[1:18:11] now that now that they got washed now
[1:18:13] they can start serving now they can
[1:18:17] start doing something now that their
[1:18:18] hands and feet are wash if not they're
[1:18:19] gonna die
[1:18:21] look at verse 8 and the priest Aaron son
[1:18:24] shall lay the parts the head and the fat
[1:18:26] in order upon the wood that is on the
[1:18:28] fire which is upon the altar but his
[1:18:30] inwards and his legs shall he wash in
[1:18:32] water and the priests shall burn all on
[1:18:35] the altar to be a burnt sacrifice and
[1:18:37] offering made by fire of a sweet savour
[1:18:40] unto the Lord isn't it beautiful
[1:18:44] before any church members can be blessed
[1:18:46] the priests had to make sure their hands
[1:18:49] are washed right and then they would go
[1:18:52] take their sacrifice they got it examine
[1:18:55] that sacrifice make sure it's a pure
[1:18:56] sacrifice right make sure there's no no
[1:18:59] blemishes on it and then they would take
[1:19:02] that they would cut it and they would
[1:19:04] rightly divide it over here and then
[1:19:06] have to take it and wash it before they
[1:19:08] put it on the altar God doesn't want any
[1:19:11] sin in our worship I hope we can see
[1:19:13] that tonight look at all the washing
[1:19:15] that needs to be done Church amen
[1:19:18] I mean there's so much washing involved
[1:19:20] here but for every single thing we do we
[1:19:23] got to make sure we're washed in the
[1:19:25] water of God everything before I help
[1:19:29] anybody I've got to be washed and then
[1:19:30] when I have a sacrifice to help somebody
[1:19:33] I've got to make sure this gets washed
[1:19:35] the right way and it's rightly divided
[1:19:37] the right way hey man I got to make sure
[1:19:41] I handle this deal the right way now for
[1:19:43] a preacher I got to make sure I preach
[1:19:44] this the right way it's got to be
[1:19:46] rightly divided Genesis to Revelation
[1:19:48] it's all of us say that hard that's for
[1:19:51] me as a preacher and for the preachers
[1:19:53] that's for them they've got to rightly
[1:19:55] divide this and make sure this gets
[1:19:56] washed and made right before they offer
[1:19:59] this sermon up to God amen
[1:20:01] hallelujah it's got to be rightly
[1:20:04] divided then finally then it gets
[1:20:06] cost with running water now God will
[1:20:10] receive that sacrifice that's beautiful
[1:20:14] and member this one we're reading of it
[1:20:16] occurs chapter 1 this was a burnt
[1:20:18] offering
[1:20:19] remember burnt offerings burnt offerings
[1:20:21] were not shared burn offering was a
[1:20:24] total consecration unto God the sin
[1:20:28] offering you know you'd eat it the the
[1:20:30] trespass offering other people could eat
[1:20:32] it different offerings you know drink
[1:20:34] offering different ones they thank
[1:20:36] offering there's all these the offerings
[1:20:37] but the burnt offering was the only
[1:20:39] offering that nobody partook of except
[1:20:42] God hallelujah
[1:20:52] you
[1:20:56] I'm giving all of my soul to you amen
[1:20:59] that's what we need today is more burnt
[1:21:01] offerings amen because members this all
[1:21:04] the offerings typed out Christ is that
[1:21:07] what Christ did then in Christ offer
[1:21:09] himself fully unto God
[1:21:11] we know he poured out his his soul like
[1:21:13] a drink offering him prayer you know in
[1:21:15] the Garden of Gethsemane we know he
[1:21:16] pulled out his soul like we preached
[1:21:17] last week with Hannah and a point out
[1:21:19] her soul unto God you know praying for
[1:21:21] the child Samuel and all these drink
[1:21:24] offerings all these things you know
[1:21:25] David pouring out the water that the
[1:21:27] mighty men got that was a drink offering
[1:21:29] a type of the drink offering but here
[1:21:31] Christ here sees he sees this every part
[1:21:35] has to be washed every inward part got
[1:21:38] to be washed and given to God that's how
[1:21:40] we are every part of our inside has to
[1:21:43] be given to God wash and then got to
[1:21:46] receive it all the doors of my life
[1:21:49] all the doors of my heart every idea
[1:21:52] that I have all my feeling everything's
[1:21:54] got to be washed and then presented to
[1:21:57] God and then got to receive that amen
[1:21:59] glory that's beautiful that's what the
[1:22:05] sea of glass is talking about here see
[1:22:09] it now in this case is a sea of brass at
[1:22:11] this point now I read in a Bible
[1:22:14] dictionary today said the Laver was the
[1:22:16] resident of for the base received and
[1:22:20] held water from it's this is the base of
[1:22:22] course look how big this is in Solomon's
[1:22:24] day there was only one in Solomon's they
[1:22:27] just made one big one and and the base
[1:22:32] held and received water and was the
[1:22:35] place for washing thus the water was
[1:22:38] kept pure until it was drawn in a vessel
[1:22:40] for use so the water didn't get
[1:22:43] contaminated by dipping bowls and oxes
[1:22:46] and pigeons and all these mourning doves
[1:22:48] and turtle doves the the water didn't
[1:22:50] get defiled but then it would actually
[1:22:52] pull out water with a pitcher and it
[1:22:53] would pour out upon the sacrifice amen
[1:22:57] running water only amen oh don't you
[1:23:01] enjoy a real Holy Ghost shower every now
[1:23:02] and then oh there's nothing like it by
[1:23:05] God's grace this is a wonderful Holy
[1:23:07] Ghost shower
[1:23:10] now brahim says put on your thinking now
[1:23:13] let's go to Ephesians 5 let's go to
[1:23:15] Ephesians 5 in our Bibles so now program
[1:23:19] takes his thought and he takes it to the
[1:23:21] washing of water by the word seasons 5
[1:23:34] verse now he starts at verse 21 program
[1:23:43] reads as he says submit yourselves
[1:23:45] I'm sorry submitting yourselves one to
[1:23:47] another in the fear of God boater have
[1:23:50] said congregation submit yourself to
[1:23:52] your pastor pastor submit yourself to
[1:23:56] your congregation now here's how the
[1:23:58] pastor does it if little cliques rise up
[1:24:01] don't be on either side submit yourself
[1:24:04] to the whole congregation praise the
[1:24:09] Lord congregation if you start a click
[1:24:12] submit yourself to your pastor and the
[1:24:14] fear of God and break up the clicks see
[1:24:16] why can't fellowship with anybody other
[1:24:19] than my two friends you know those are
[1:24:22] cliques right they I don't want anything
[1:24:24] to do with you I'm glad you come to
[1:24:26] church but don't talk to me clicks you
[1:24:30] know I never have you over to my house
[1:24:31] at all I never want to spend time with
[1:24:33] you cliques but the way we submit to
[1:24:36] each other is not by dividing but it's
[1:24:38] uniting that's that's what brother Ham
[1:24:41] brings out he said don't ease it don't
[1:24:44] cause cliques in the church everybody be
[1:24:46] United he says wives submit yourselves
[1:24:50] to their own husbands how he knows that
[1:24:51] you women he says the Bible said so in
[1:24:54] the beginning is still the same today
[1:24:55] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:24:57] even as Christ the head of the church
[1:24:59] and he's the savior of the body so is
[1:25:01] the husband he says you all know that
[1:25:03] you married people or children that's
[1:25:04] old enough to know that he says husbands
[1:25:09] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:25:11] another church and gave himself for Rome
[1:25:13] and said husbands don't you run over
[1:25:16] your wife don't run over her if you do
[1:25:20] that you're not fit to be a husband
[1:25:24] that's quite a statement that he might
[1:25:29] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:25:31] of water by the I'll say the word he
[1:25:36] says then every worshipper that has ever
[1:25:38] gains access into this presence has to
[1:25:41] come by the word
[1:25:43] there's too many that comes otherwise
[1:25:46] Melanson I believe in little stories
[1:25:48] where my mother died long ago and she's
[1:25:50] waiting for you in heaven program said
[1:25:52] that does all right after the word has
[1:25:55] been applied see people want to come to
[1:25:58] they want to come to church and go to
[1:25:59] heaven just so they can see their mom
[1:26:01] who passed away or their dad who passed
[1:26:03] away and Bertrand said that's not why
[1:26:05] you come to the altar you come to the
[1:26:07] altar first he said to apply the word to
[1:26:10] you he says many people come to altar
[1:26:14] because they want to meet their mother
[1:26:15] in heaven that's all right you shouldn't
[1:26:17] do that but that's not the reason you
[1:26:19] come to the altar you come to the altar
[1:26:21] here it is confessing your sins because
[1:26:24] Christ died for you in your stead
[1:26:27] by the word oh that's what we need more
[1:26:29] today don't we we've got to confess our
[1:26:31] sins amen now just come to church
[1:26:34] because we know it's right we don't want
[1:26:35] to go to hell but we've got a company if
[1:26:37] we've done something wrong we've got to
[1:26:39] confess our sins and that's why we come
[1:26:41] so Christ can cleanse us and then we
[1:26:44] know we're going to blessings after that
[1:26:45] you see your mom see your dad see your
[1:26:48] loved ones aunts uncles all those things
[1:26:51] that's right
[1:26:53] so Barbara Ham says any sacrifice as now
[1:26:56] to come according to the word is
[1:26:58] unaccepted brother Branham said I hate
[1:27:01] to say this he said but that's why acts
[1:27:04] 19 is in the Bible so let's go to Acts
[1:27:08] chapter 19 this is quite a statement 2x
[1:27:15] 19
[1:27:26] in church this is why there's gonna be a
[1:27:28] lot
[1:27:28] on the day of judgment especially and we
[1:27:31] say like this in denomination or
[1:27:33] non-denominational churches because they
[1:27:35] honestly think they're going to build go
[1:27:37] in the rapture they honestly think that
[1:27:38] but honestly Church there and most of
[1:27:41] them are not washed in the waters of
[1:27:43] word for today they're not washed by the
[1:27:47] word the fresh word the word that you
[1:27:49] and I love amen the way that we've let
[1:27:52] wash us praise God
[1:27:54] and I'm not doubting denominational as I
[1:27:56] hope I'm not doubting independent
[1:27:59] churches I wanted to see them all say
[1:28:01] but they hardly will take any time to
[1:28:03] listen to us right I try to share about
[1:28:06] makeup and all these things and they
[1:28:08] just shut you right now they don't want
[1:28:09] to hear about it you know so my close
[1:28:11] friends you try to share about it and
[1:28:13] they don't want to hear about it
[1:28:15] but this scripture but I said this is
[1:28:17] why the scriptures in the Bible because
[1:28:20] it shows you've got to be washed by the
[1:28:22] present Word of God the message sour
[1:28:25] acts 19 verse 2 if you know the story
[1:28:30] behind this the church at Ephesus was
[1:28:33] living under Apollo's his teaching which
[1:28:36] was teaching you must go to John's
[1:28:37] baptism just the baptism of repentance
[1:28:39] right and so brother man said this is
[1:28:43] why acts 19 is in the Bible verse 2 and
[1:28:45] he said to them have you received the
[1:28:47] Holy Ghost since you believe and they
[1:28:49] said unto Him we have not so much as
[1:28:51] heard whether there be any Holy Ghost
[1:28:53] boater have said see he and Paul told
[1:28:56] them that won't work your old days of
[1:29:00] John's baptism which was only a few
[1:29:01] years old that won't work John will be
[1:29:05] baptized into repentance not for
[1:29:07] remission of sins and when they heard
[1:29:09] this they were rebaptised why by the
[1:29:12] word they were washed by the waters of
[1:29:15] the word amen oh yeah and that's what we
[1:29:19] are Church this is like what we have
[1:29:20] today we've got the word here and we
[1:29:23] tell people about baptism about the
[1:29:24] godhead about makeup about a hair long
[1:29:27] hair for women all these things holiness
[1:29:30] and all these things and when they hear
[1:29:32] it
[1:29:32] they turn it down and they won't come in
[1:29:34] me wash by the waters of the word that's
[1:29:37] so true but a man said that he said I
[1:29:40] hate to say that
[1:29:42] that's the condition that it's in how
[1:29:47] many want to be washed by the waters of
[1:29:49] today's word oh I do too like I've
[1:29:52] always said I've I've always said this
[1:29:53] if there's the church in Akron that
[1:29:54] preaches more truth than us let's go
[1:29:56] join them I've always said that if
[1:29:58] somebody's preaching if I'm off the word
[1:30:00] there's a greater revelation that I
[1:30:02] missed or somebody showed to me but with
[1:30:04] all my friends and everyone I've ever
[1:30:06] met in this area it has proved to me one
[1:30:08] thing
[1:30:08] that God has sent a prophet God sent
[1:30:10] William Branham with thus saith the Lord
[1:30:12] and he preached the Bible and the Bible
[1:30:15] was restored and the Bible and the Bible
[1:30:17] says that the Jesus will not return to
[1:30:20] Earth until the restitution of all
[1:30:22] things until this Bible is fully
[1:30:24] preached and restored then Jesus Christ
[1:30:27] comes back in the rapture amen that's
[1:30:29] been proved to me all these years you
[1:30:31] know 15 years of the message or so 17
[1:30:35] years I'm sorry the message it's been
[1:30:36] just proved to me over and over again
[1:30:38] this is the Word of God because you
[1:30:40] wonder you know you'd have all these
[1:30:41] friends why can't they see it why don't
[1:30:43] they want to see it all I'm preaching is
[1:30:46] the Bible it shows that they don't want
[1:30:48] to be washed by the waters of God's Word
[1:30:50] but you and I love to be washing God's
[1:30:52] Word hey man whatever it says let it cut
[1:30:56] me let it shuck me like a piece of corn
[1:30:58] even if I cry or get upset then
[1:31:00] hopefully I'll repent for that and let
[1:31:02] everything be torn away then everything
[1:31:04] be cut away and let it be wash and let
[1:31:07] me be placed on God's altar where God
[1:31:09] can accept my life as a living sacrifice
[1:31:11] a Mahana
[1:31:13] whatever needs shucker poured away
[1:31:16] whenever I need separated from then do
[1:31:19] it Lord because I just want to be like
[1:31:20] Christ amen it's exactly right
[1:31:27] like I'm Memorial Day I was walking I
[1:31:28] was trying to witness you know brother
[1:31:30] Adam and I always talking about
[1:31:31] witnessing I was trying to witness to
[1:31:32] this new friend I just met him he said
[1:31:34] what I said what church do you go to you
[1:31:36] know he told me his church says oh
[1:31:37] that's nice you know he said what church
[1:31:39] you go to I said we go I said I'm a
[1:31:41] pastor of a church we preached the
[1:31:43] message of William Branham he was a
[1:31:44] prophet that God said and the Bible is
[1:31:47] restored and we believe in the rapture
[1:31:48] and everything is restored he's just
[1:31:49] okay but he's just kept on walking in
[1:31:52] church my heart just sinks because part
[1:31:54] of me wants to like jump on his back
[1:31:56] pack them down to the ground and said
[1:31:58] did you hear just hear what I said don't
[1:32:01] you don't you feel like that like do you
[1:32:04] kind of like shake their face like all
[1:32:07] right did you hear me God sent a prophet
[1:32:11] and he's restored the Bible and all the
[1:32:14] days of the Apostles are restored amen
[1:32:17] right and you just you tried to witness
[1:32:21] like you get up in the morning you pray
[1:32:22] try to witness and just go but you know
[1:32:26] what there's God it's still gotta be
[1:32:27] some elect seeds out there there's God
[1:32:29] at least some seeds out there because
[1:32:31] we're still here so we'll just keep
[1:32:33] trying we'll just keep witness and we'll
[1:32:35] keep doing everything we can there's got
[1:32:37] to be somebody like me that loves the
[1:32:39] Word of God glory now look we says
[1:32:46] that's in the Bible now that will prove
[1:32:48] to you that not every church is getting
[1:32:51] washed by the waters of the word I'll
[1:32:54] say like this I believe like this church
[1:32:55] most churches today that don't believe
[1:32:57] the message the the farthest they can
[1:32:59] get is the waters of separation they cuz
[1:33:02] they won't even come in to be baptized
[1:33:04] in the outer court are you with me
[1:33:05] they won't even come by the Lord Jesus
[1:33:07] Christ so the very very most they can
[1:33:10] hope for of is to be sprinkle with a
[1:33:12] little anointing to feel like they can
[1:33:15] have some closest to God does every
[1:33:17] understand like they just they have a
[1:33:19] they just have some spring clean
[1:33:21] experience some little emotion some and
[1:33:23] they feel like they know God but there
[1:33:26] is so much more how many know there's so
[1:33:30] much more to God
[1:33:31] oh never Paul said all the depths and
[1:33:35] the heights and the breadth and the
[1:33:36] width of God's love amen
[1:33:38] the Deb's are so great there's so much
[1:33:41] more death of God's Word if we're just
[1:33:43] hungry for it but most church members
[1:33:46] just go to the sprinkling they just get
[1:33:48] they feel forgiven for a while who knows
[1:33:50] what they do after that they might walk
[1:33:52] back out in the world with a bunch of
[1:33:53] dead Creed's right a bunch of dead
[1:33:55] movies and sins and and relationships
[1:33:58] and fornications and adults reason they
[1:34:00] might just walk right back out there
[1:34:01] with the dead stuff but you and I were
[1:34:03] invited to come a lot closer we're
[1:34:05] coming to get washed by the waters of
[1:34:06] word amen glory
[1:34:10] that's right he says you've got you and
[1:34:15] I've got to hear the word before you can
[1:34:16] enter there let me go back we've got to
[1:34:21] hear the word before we can enter there
[1:34:23] he says because there's only one way you
[1:34:26] can approach into God and that's by
[1:34:28] faith not meet a man not meet a father
[1:34:31] not me to mother not meet a baby
[1:34:33] them's all true we will do that but the
[1:34:36] first thing we got to come is God's
[1:34:38] Avenue of approach will be washed when
[1:34:40] we hear the word of God that's why we
[1:34:44] want people we want people to come and
[1:34:45] sit in these seats and hear the Word of
[1:34:48] God for the first time like oh I never
[1:34:51] knew how supposed to be baptized the
[1:34:52] name of Lord Jesus Christ I never knew
[1:34:54] Trinity was of the devil I never knew
[1:34:57] that's an addition to the Word of God
[1:35:00] that's what brings faith when they hear
[1:35:03] the word of God preached aren't you glad
[1:35:05] don't you remember when you first heard
[1:35:07] the word preached don't you remember
[1:35:09] when that faith rose up in your hearts
[1:35:11] yes I'll be baptized yes that's God's
[1:35:13] Word I'm standing with God's Word what
[1:35:15] happened faith came by hearing hearing
[1:35:17] by the Word of God that's what we need
[1:35:21] people to sit and hear the Word of God
[1:35:24] then faith can strike them because
[1:35:26] that's the only way faith can strike
[1:35:27] them is to hear the word of God now
[1:35:33] let's close with this I got a lot of
[1:35:38] voice because I was off on vacation all
[1:35:40] week this week I my voice is kind of
[1:35:42] sounding kind of good to me like it's
[1:35:44] not like so I better be careful I better
[1:35:48] not overdo it you know but let's hear he
[1:35:50] says brother have cenotes we see the sea
[1:35:53] of glass it is like an under crystal now
[1:35:58] he said this is the glass see in heaven
[1:36:00] but Moses saw as a glass see and then
[1:36:03] made what was called the brass see this
[1:36:05] brazen altar and we know what brother
[1:36:09] Aaron tell us what brass represents say
[1:36:11] it out loud where's brass represented
[1:36:13] judgment divine judgment because the
[1:36:16] brass serpent it was sin already judged
[1:36:18] now he says now notice this labor was
[1:36:22] empty now less interesting
[1:36:24] this Laver was empty brother BAM says in
[1:36:27] let's go back to Revelation four five
[1:36:28] and six four six actually revelation
[1:36:32] four six program causes an empty labor
[1:36:39] yeah Revelation 4:6 and before the
[1:36:42] throne there was a sea of glass like
[1:36:45] unto crystal and in the midst of the
[1:36:50] throne around about the throne were four
[1:36:52] beasts full of eyes before him behind
[1:36:54] sibel Ram said and he says and notice
[1:36:57] this labor was empty and was as clear as
[1:36:59] crystal he says why why is it clear as
[1:37:02] crystal and empty he says because the
[1:37:04] church has already been redeemed amen
[1:37:08] that's what he says he said but now we
[1:37:11] notice a little later on though when the
[1:37:14] tribulation Saints come up we find it
[1:37:17] again full of fire let's go to
[1:37:20] Revelation 15 here revelation 15 verse 1
[1:37:32] relation 15 1 and I saw another sign in
[1:37:35] heaven great and marvellous seven angels
[1:37:37] having the seven last plagues for in
[1:37:39] them is filled up the wrath of God verse
[1:37:42] two and I saw as it were a sea of glass
[1:37:46] now its mingled with fire it's no longer
[1:37:50] Crete clear as crystal
[1:37:52] now it's mingled with fire I'm gonna
[1:37:54] skip ahead a few slides there to kind of
[1:37:55] give a picture of it so this is this is
[1:37:58] an artist idea of a sea of glass and
[1:38:01] then there's fire mingled in now I don't
[1:38:03] I don't know I've never seen visions I
[1:38:05] it could be Dell totally different than
[1:38:07] this okay I'm just giving you an idea
[1:38:09] does everyone understand like I I'm not
[1:38:11] really an artist and I've never seen
[1:38:13] ever see visions I'm not a prophet
[1:38:15] either so I don't know what it looks
[1:38:16] like I'm just giving you an idea but
[1:38:18] look at verse 2:15 - and I saw as it
[1:38:21] were a sea of glass mingled with fire
[1:38:22] and then they've gotten the victory over
[1:38:25] the beast and over his image and over
[1:38:28] his mark and over the number of his name
[1:38:30] stand on the sea of glass having the
[1:38:33] harps of God amen
[1:38:37] says he says these are the tribulation
[1:38:40] Saints that come up now to me they could
[1:38:43] either be the tribulation Saints or the
[1:38:45] 144,000 and the reason is of that is
[1:38:48] because in chapter 14 if you read that
[1:38:50] the 144,000 all have harps in their
[1:38:53] hands so I don't know it could be
[1:38:55] program says tribulation Saints here he
[1:38:57] preaches again in victory day and
[1:38:59] doesn't tell us who it is
[1:39:00] in victory day 1963 he just says they
[1:39:03] got the victory amen and there they are
[1:39:05] singing about the victory playing on
[1:39:06] their harps glorifying God amen
[1:39:09] and they see the thing is I think it's I
[1:39:12] personally think it's the Jews because
[1:39:13] they sing the song of Moses that's just
[1:39:16] my thought but I could be wrong but
[1:39:17] brother Ham in 1961 he says it's the
[1:39:20] tribulation Saints so it could be that
[1:39:23] he says this now now let's read verse 3
[1:39:28] and they sing the song of Moses the
[1:39:31] servant of God and the song of the lamb
[1:39:33] saying great and marvellous are thy
[1:39:34] works Lord God Almighty just and true
[1:39:37] are thy ways thou king of saints alright
[1:39:43] praise the Lord now let me quote let me
[1:39:46] finish up here he says how do we come he
[1:39:48] says we've got to come this Gentile
[1:39:50] church - the word the sea of glass the
[1:39:54] water of the word recognize the word the
[1:39:57] way it's written aren't you glad church
[1:39:58] brother man just said you've got to come
[1:40:01] to the sea of glass and guess what we've
[1:40:03] already come to the sea of glass glory
[1:40:05] we've already come to the Word of God to
[1:40:09] be washed by the waters of the word amen
[1:40:12] glory he says then the sacrifice is
[1:40:16] received and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:19] from the inside shining through the
[1:40:21] light of that age here it comes out of
[1:40:24] the holy place into here out of the star
[1:40:26] into here do you get it now I notice at
[1:40:30] the end of this age John when he saw the
[1:40:31] seat of brass there it was called clear
[1:40:33] as crystal what was it the word had been
[1:40:36] taken from the earth raptured in the
[1:40:38] church and it was clear as crystal no
[1:40:41] more blood the church age was over
[1:40:44] brother ram calls it a clear sea of
[1:40:47] glass it's just all clear because the
[1:40:49] church age is over there
[1:40:50] no blood there there's nothing it's just
[1:40:52] clear because the church is already
[1:40:55] raptured amen now let me read this here
[1:41:04] now the tribulation Saints that come up
[1:41:06] had went through great tribulations and
[1:41:09] remember the church will not go through
[1:41:11] tribulation because they're already in
[1:41:14] glory amen so brother Anderson this is
[1:41:17] possibly the foolish virgin in other
[1:41:19] words the the the Christians who have to
[1:41:22] go through the tribulation they miss the
[1:41:24] rapture but they die and the Bible said
[1:41:27] they got victory over the Beast His
[1:41:30] image the World Council churches nine
[1:41:33] over his mark the 666 right the Vaqueros
[1:41:37] filleted a they victory over the Pope
[1:41:39] and over the number of his name and
[1:41:42] stand on the sea of glass having the
[1:41:45] harps of God amen now brother has said
[1:41:48] what kind of sermon or what kind of
[1:41:49] doctrine did they receive and brother
[1:41:52] have said read verse three again now
[1:41:56] let's read verse 3 verse three proves
[1:41:58] that God is one person I don't know if
[1:42:01] you caught it but verse three proves
[1:42:02] that and rub and hammers on this if you
[1:42:04] listen to the sermon
[1:42:05] what kind of God were these these people
[1:42:09] with hearts what kind of God were their
[1:42:10] hearing preached about and brother have
[1:42:12] said it was not a three-person God so
[1:42:15] these are not Trinitarians glory now
[1:42:19] verse 4 verse 3 and they sing the song
[1:42:21] of Moses the servant of God and the song
[1:42:24] of the lamb saying great and marvellous
[1:42:27] are thy works Lord God Almighty this is
[1:42:32] the song of the Lamb so they're singing
[1:42:35] to the lamb and they sing to the land
[1:42:37] they call the lamb Lord God Almighty are
[1:42:40] you with me Church just and true are thy
[1:42:43] ways thou king of saints he's the king
[1:42:47] of kings and Lord of lords the lamb is
[1:42:50] the king of kings and Lord of lords the
[1:42:52] lamb is the Lord God Almighty not a
[1:42:54] second person but the one true person of
[1:42:57] God amen
[1:42:59] but I said what kind of doctrine they
[1:43:00] heard see if that compares with the
[1:43:02] church now see what they wrecked
[1:43:04] to me not know third person at Trinity
[1:43:07] but the Lord God Almighty the king of
[1:43:10] saints amen he said they'll stand there
[1:43:15] they were washed by the water after they
[1:43:18] come through the fiery tribulation
[1:43:20] period so see that's why there was fire
[1:43:22] mingled in this sea of glass because
[1:43:24] they had to go through the fire of the
[1:43:26] tribulation period everybody with me
[1:43:28] Amen now go to chapter 14 just so you
[1:43:36] know this is just an interesting thought
[1:43:37] this is just a minor but this is what I
[1:43:38] said earlier
[1:43:39] this could be the 144,000 and here's why
[1:43:41] I think it is verse 1 verse 1 and I
[1:43:44] looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount
[1:43:46] Zion and with him 144,000 having his
[1:43:49] father's names written their foreheads
[1:43:50] and I heard a voice from heaven as the
[1:43:52] voice of many waters and as the voice of
[1:43:55] a great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[1:43:56] the Harper's harping with their harps
[1:43:57] and they sung as it were a new song
[1:44:00] before the throne and before the four
[1:44:03] beasts and the elders and no man could
[1:44:05] learn that song but the hundred forty
[1:44:06] and four thousand which were redeemed
[1:44:09] from the earth see they were harping
[1:44:12] with their harps a hundred forty-four
[1:44:14] thousand and they're singing about
[1:44:16] they're all about the lamb look at verse
[1:44:18] four these are they which were not
[1:44:20] defiled with women for they are virgins
[1:44:22] these are they which follow the lamb
[1:44:25] wherever I'm sorry whithersoever he
[1:44:27] goeth these were redeemed from among men
[1:44:30] being the firstfruits of God and for the
[1:44:32] lamb I look at this thing I love this
[1:44:33] thought and in the mouth was found no
[1:44:35] guile for there without fault before the
[1:44:39] throne of God let's stand to our feet by
[1:44:42] God's grace in that beautiful I love
[1:44:48] that thought where Ensor it's describing
[1:44:50] the 144,000 and thus cries it describes
[1:44:54] them as this before the throne of God
[1:44:56] there is no fault to them how many
[1:45:00] wonder how many want to stay like that
[1:45:01] before the throne of God why isn't there
[1:45:04] any fault because they all went to the
[1:45:06] brazen altar right they all went to the
[1:45:08] they all got washed by the waters of the
[1:45:11] word amen
[1:45:14] now if
[1:45:16] 144,000 Jews who were blind into Christ
[1:45:18] can be the Bible said will be born in
[1:45:21] one day they'll recognize Christ and
[1:45:24] they'll weep and mourn and cry and then
[1:45:26] someday after that or maybe that day
[1:45:28] they'll get baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:30] and if God can forgive all their sins
[1:45:32] and make them without fault before the
[1:45:34] throne of God how much for us we come
[1:45:37] service after service not just one
[1:45:39] natures but we come service after
[1:45:41] service year after year we come
[1:45:44] continually to this labor to be washed
[1:45:46] how do we know that you stand before God
[1:45:48] without fault before his throne
[1:45:50] hey man one day they get washed and the
[1:45:54] Bible said there's no more fault because
[1:45:57] they came to this sea of glass to see a
[1:45:59] glass one day and they're completely
[1:46:01] without fault before the throne of God
[1:46:03] and you and I get to bathe in this water
[1:46:04] all the time hey man I say God washed me
[1:46:07] afresh tonight amen glory let me be
[1:46:10] without fault before the throne of God
[1:46:12] so when I pray even if God knows an
[1:46:15] answer I have no kind of nation I know
[1:46:17] he heard me and whenever His perfect
[1:46:19] will is it will be done because I'm
[1:46:21] without fault before the throne of God
[1:46:23] I've been washed in the blood of God's
[1:46:25] own son let's get the Lord Rama pause
[1:46:28] amen oh my Gary hey man beautiful you
[1:46:34] and I come to this tonight let's bow our
[1:46:36] heads here there's anything we need wash

[1:46:52] to be washed we don't want to try to
[1:46:54] live off another day or we with all due
[1:46:57] respect to brother brand we don't want
[1:46:58] to live off of his testimony although we
[1:47:00] appreciate it we would have our own
[1:47:02] testimony we want to feel that we're
[1:47:05] forgiven that we're washed that we have
[1:47:09] come by the water

[1:47:22] there's just one hand bless that hand
