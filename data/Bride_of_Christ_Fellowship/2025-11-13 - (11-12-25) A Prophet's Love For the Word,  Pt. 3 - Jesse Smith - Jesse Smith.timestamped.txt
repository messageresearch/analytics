[0:02] So let's look here. Uh I got I want to
[0:04] share again some more quotes from God's
[0:06] prophet, brother Brandham. You know, I
[0:08] think this is important especially for
[0:09] our young teenagers here and our young
[0:11] children who've been baptized and uh are
[0:14] professing to be Christians. They need
[0:15] to understand, I believe they need to
[0:17] understand how much a prophet of God
[0:19] loves the word of God. In this case, the
[0:21] prophet in our day, brother William
[0:22] Brandom, how much he loved the word of
[0:24] God. And we're seeing that. And I hope
[0:26] at some point I'd like to make a video
[0:28] and I want to call it the ultimate
[0:30] brother Brandham and the Bible video
[0:32] until I find one that's better. I'm
[0:34] going to call it the ultimate by God's
[0:35] grace because it's so important to
[0:37] capture all these quotes uh from a
[0:40] prophet of God and see how much a
[0:41] prophet of God loved the word of God
[0:44] told us to keep it and not to add
[0:46] anything to it or take anything away
[0:49] from it. So a prophet's love for the
[0:51] word of God part three. We'll look at
[0:53] this here. David told us how much he
[0:55] loved the word of God. He said, "I'll
[0:57] delight myself in thy commandments,
[0:58] which I have loved. My hands also will I
[1:01] lift up unto thy commandments, which I
[1:04] have loved, and I will meditate in thy
[1:06] statutes." How many meditated on God
[1:08] throughout the day? Every every time I
[1:09] got a break, I tried to go back to
[1:11] meditating on the word of God. Amen.
[1:14] [snorts]
[1:14] Now, this was our text again. Uh God is
[1:17] having Moses repeat, "Don't add to it.
[1:20] Don't take one word away from it." He
[1:22] said, ' Because you've seen what I've
[1:24] done to those that have transgressed it.
[1:27] Remember, uh what did they do at Baal
[1:29] Pure? Um Bailo, who was a prophet, he
[1:32] did he did see the star of Jacob. You
[1:34] know, he saw he foretold that about 1500
[1:37] years before the wise men followed it to
[1:40] find Jesus. So his prophecy was right.
[1:42] But brother Ram said, and we know it's
[1:44] true, his teaching was off. He taught
[1:46] the men to commit fornication.
[1:48] Therefore, 24,000
[1:50] died among them. And so, what did they
[1:52] do? Uh, you can switch over, hun. Did it
[1:54] not switch over? I'm sorry.
[1:57] Uh, but what did what did Balum do?
[1:59] Balam uh took away from the word of God.
[2:03] Okay. So, uh he didn't add to it. He
[2:06] took away from it because the Old
[2:07] Testament taught not to commit
[2:08] fornication. The Old Testament said if a
[2:11] man forced himself on a woman or laid
[2:13] with a woman, he was bound to marry her.
[2:15] That's what the Old Testament said.
[2:17] There was no relationships before
[2:19] marriage. No physical relationship. If a
[2:21] man touched her in that way, they're to
[2:23] be instantly immediately married. Right?
[2:26] So in this case, Balum, he took away
[2:28] from the word of God and said, "Okay,
[2:30] it's okay. You can marry and have
[2:32] relations before you're married and you
[2:34] can marry um Moabites, right? Out you
[2:37] can marry outside of the faith. And God
[2:40] hated it. And the Bible said God never
[2:43] forgave Balum for that. So what happened
[2:45] to him? His name was taken. If it ever
[2:47] was on the book of life, his name was
[2:49] taken off it. That's why we got to be
[2:52] very serious with the word of God. We
[2:54] don't add to it. We don't take away from
[2:55] it. Hallelujah. And like brother Ram
[2:58] said, if the even if the janitor, anyone
[3:00] else has a question where I'm off the
[3:01] word, you're duty bound to God to come
[3:04] talk to me face to face about it in my
[3:06] office. And the church said,
[3:08] &gt;&gt; the man said the even the janitor from
[3:09] he said from uh the from the deacon down
[3:12] to the janitor, anyone else, your duty
[3:14] bound to make sure I stay with the word
[3:15] of God. Amen.
[3:18] Now uh we see again Moses repeats it
[3:20] again. By the inspiration of the Holy
[3:22] Ghost in 12:32, what things soever I
[3:25] command you, observe to do it, thou
[3:27] shalt not add there to nor diminish from
[3:30] it. Remember adding to the word of God
[3:32] is legalism. taken away from the word of
[3:35] God is lasciviousness.
[3:37] Because remember Jude 1:4 says they turn
[3:40] the grace of God into lawlessness.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; But what did Paul say? Should you
[3:45] continue in sin that grace should
[3:46] abound? What'd he say? He said God God
[3:48] forbid. Amen. God forbid that. Just
[3:52] because you've got grace doesn't mean
[3:53] you can keep sinning.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible says if you have the hope in
[3:57] you, you'll purify yourself. You'll
[3:59] purify your life to be more like Christ.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:03] I'm going to watch the time. Uh uh
[4:05] Malachi's got to get up at 3:30 in the
[4:07] morning. So I'm gonna really watch the
[4:08] time tonight.
[4:10] Amen, brother Rod. God bless you, sir. I
[4:13] don't know those days. So God bless you,
[4:15] brother Rod and brother Malachi. Real
[4:17] soldiers. Amen. Now, uh I just want you
[4:20] to see again, it's repeated uh in the
[4:23] days of Josiah's son. Now, Josiah was
[4:26] one of the last few kings of Judah
[4:27] before the exile or the captivity.
[4:31] But in the beginning of the reign of
[4:33] Jehookim, the son of Josiah, came the
[4:35] word Lord, saying, "Thus sayeth the
[4:36] Lord, stand in the court of the Lord's
[4:39] house, and speak unto all the cities of
[4:40] Judah, which come to worship in the
[4:42] Lord's house." Where does the where does
[4:43] judgment begin?
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Ask the Lord. Good, Malachi. What book's
[4:47] that in Malachi?
[4:50] Uh, first Peter 4. Yeah, good try. Now,
[4:52] the reason I'm testing him is because
[4:54] he's being a real light to the brothers.
[4:56] So, he's going to Now, he's going to
[4:58] remember that because I tested him on it
[4:59] [laughter]
[5:00] in love. Yeah, judgment must begin at
[5:02] the house of God. It's 1 Peter 4. Let me
[5:04] just look that up to confirm that. And
[5:06] if I'm wrong, boy, I got a lot of
[5:07] apologizing to do to my son.
[5:11] No, it's 1 Peter 4:17. Yeah, I it it's
[5:13] fresh on my mind. 1 Peter 4:17. Judgment
[5:17] begins with Scott. Very good. Very good.
[5:19] Um, so that's why we dress up, right?
[5:21] That's why we wear our nice clothes,
[5:22] right? That's why uh we we we act like
[5:24] we're coming to court. I'm going to come
[5:26] stand before not just a judge, the
[5:29] judge.
[5:30] the judge of all the universe. So I come
[5:33] to present myself humbly and
[5:35] respectfully before the Lord Jesus
[5:36] Christ. Hallelujah. And he said Jeremiah
[5:40] thus say stand there and say thus sayith
[5:41] the Lord. He says uh all the words that
[5:45] I command to speak unto them diminish
[5:47] not a word. Tell them everything. Right?
[5:50] That's why I want to tell you everything
[5:51] that I can from the Bible. Right?
[5:55] If so be, they will hearken and turn
[5:57] every man from his evil way that I may
[6:00] repent me of the evil which I purpose to
[6:02] do unto them because of the evil of
[6:04] their doings. Okay, so we're given a
[6:07] promise. It's thus sayith the Lord, if
[6:09] you keep all the word of God, then God
[6:11] will have mercy on you. Well, we know
[6:14] what happened, right? They turned they
[6:16] turned Jeremiah down and then they were
[6:18] exiled, right? And Jeremiah went with
[6:20] them as a witness against them, right?
[6:23] We're aware of that. So again, so we see
[6:25] it in Moses, right? We we even we even
[6:27] realize it was in Genesis, right?
[6:30] Because Eve uh took one word away. Thou
[6:32] shalt not surely die, right? Or she
[6:35] added, I'm sorry, she added a word. Thou
[6:36] shalt surely die. Thou shalt not surely
[6:38] die. She added, and what was added to
[6:40] her? Sin, right? Uh punishment. Uh we'd
[6:44] say punishment in her body for receiving
[6:46] seed. That proves the serpent seed was
[6:48] an actual act of adultery because the
[6:51] punishment always fits the crime. She
[6:53] would suffer pain in childbearing. Well,
[6:56] that's related to receiving seed. She
[6:57] received the wrong seed, so she got
[6:59] punished in receiving seed. And the
[7:01] effects of that. That's right. So, we
[7:04] see it, and brother says it many times.
[7:06] He says, we see it from Genesis to
[7:08] Revelation. So, Genesis, don't add to
[7:10] the word. Don't take away from the word.
[7:11] Deuteronomy, don't add to the word.
[7:13] Don't take away from the word. We see in
[7:14] Revelation, don't add, don't take away.
[7:17] If you love God, you won't add or take
[7:19] away from the word of God.
[7:21] And I love the Lord Jesus. Brother said,
[7:23] "Look, you find it right there in the
[7:24] middle." No, he says the middle uh ma
[7:26] the book of Matthew, right in the
[7:28] middle. He says, Genesis, right? Or
[7:30] Deuteronomy, Matthew, Revelation. Go ye
[7:33] therefore teach all nations, baptizing
[7:35] them in the name of the Father and of
[7:36] the Son and of the Holy Ghost. It's a
[7:38] revelation. Teaching them to observe
[7:41] what, church? All see don't diminish,
[7:45] don't take away, don't add.
[7:47] all things whatsoever I commanded you.
[7:50] And lo, I'm with you always, even to the
[7:52] end of the world. Jesus Christ is with
[7:54] us. He said so.
[7:57] Some of us need a good reminder of that
[7:59] tonight. Hallelujah. Right. He's with
[8:01] us. He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[8:03] never forsake you." Amen. Now, I want to
[8:06] look at now some quotes from God's
[8:08] prophet here. We'll try to see how much
[8:09] uh how far how far we can make it here
[8:11] tonight by God's grace.
[8:13] Now, brother Ram uses these words, never
[8:16] take away or add. So, as I said last
[8:19] week, a lot of this is focusing on
[8:20] people around preachers around the
[8:21] message or tape boys around the message
[8:24] who add uh brother they make brother
[8:27] Ram's words equal to the Bible. Now,
[8:29] brother Rod has also said there are
[8:31] people that listen to brother Ernest
[8:32] Angley only just like so that's that
[8:35] same deity spirit, right, brother? Same
[8:37] thing. So, and they got it uh they got
[8:39] it in the seven thunders with Joseph
[8:40] Coleman there in New York. They got it
[8:42] with Joseph Smith. You got it with
[8:44] anyone, any leader. If the people
[8:47] idolize that man, they'll only listen to
[8:49] that man instead of listening to the
[8:51] Holy Spirit.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; How do you know the spirit? The spirit
[8:54] will always point to the word of God.
[8:56] That's how you know. Very simple.
[8:59] Now, I love this quote.
[9:02] A genuine faith. Now, church, if if you
[9:04] want anything tonight, I hope you want a
[9:06] genuine faith
[9:08] of God. will believe in God and God is
[9:11] the word, it'll never add nothing to it.
[9:15] That's why I always try to say if I'm
[9:16] giving you my thought, I say this is my
[9:18] thought. I'm not saying it's thus sayith
[9:20] the Lord or thus sayith the word. This
[9:21] is my thought. Right? The Bible tells us
[9:24] if we add one word or take one word
[9:27] away. Our part will be taken from the
[9:28] book of life. Revelation 22:18, the last
[9:31] closing chapter. So never, if you have
[9:34] genuine faith, you'll never add, you'll
[9:37] never take away. Now, what does that do
[9:40] to these Bible translators? Right? Cam
[9:43] gave me this book, and this book only it
[9:45] only addresses 257 verses. Brother Rod,
[9:48] there's over a 100,000 verses in the
[9:50] Bible. And if just out of a small
[9:53] sample, if the NIV takes away 95% of
[9:57] 257, what's that around like 220, 230,
[10:00] 240?
[10:02] Why? What kind of genuine faith do these
[10:04] people have? these translators of the
[10:06] New Bible versions, what kind of faith
[10:08] do they have? If you take away one word
[10:10] of God, you're lacking faith in God's
[10:12] word.
[10:14] And that's just 257 sample. Yeah,
[10:16] brother Chris.
[10:19] No, but it's a passion for taking away
[10:21] from the word of God, right? It's a
[10:24] passion uh uh to be punished, I think,
[10:26] is what it means. Yeah, it's really
[10:29] awful.
[10:30] Yes. Yes, sir. You're right, brother.
[10:32] Just like they do the Bible versions of
[10:34] the non-gender Bible versions. That's
[10:36] that that's from hell. In other words,
[10:38] that's inspired by demon powers. Anybody
[10:41] that'll take one word away or take one
[10:43] word away, you're lacking genuine faith
[10:46] in God's word. Hallelujah.
[10:48] And the amplified missing 78%.
[10:52] So what does it say about people that
[10:54] will take one word away? It says they're
[10:56] really lacking spiritually.
[10:58] They don't have the Holy Spirit if
[11:00] they're taken away from the Holy
[11:02] Spirit's words, okay? And they're going
[11:05] to have something added to them, plagues
[11:07] or some punishment in this life or the
[11:09] next one. And they could have their
[11:11] name, if they don't repent, they'll have
[11:12] their name taken out of the book of
[11:13] life.
[11:15] That's what the Bible says. Okay. Now, I
[11:18] want to say, so now let's apply it to
[11:19] those around the message of William
[11:21] Brandham, which is the Bible revelation.
[11:23] What does the Bible What does that say
[11:24] about the genuine faith of the tape boys
[11:26] and bread tab tabernacle leadership?
[11:29] They say the tapes are the token. They
[11:30] say the tapes are the Holy Ghost. What
[11:33] an awful shame. The Holy Spirit is the
[11:35] token.
[11:37] And they say uh they say you're not
[11:39] applying the token to your church unless
[11:41] you're playing the tapes and telling the
[11:43] preachers to sit down and press play.
[11:45] It's exactly the opposite, right? You're
[11:48] keeping people from the Holy Ghost. See,
[11:51] they love to play those tapes of brother
[11:53] Ram because brother Ram won't brother
[11:54] Ram won't rebuke what they're doing
[11:56] right now, right? Brother Ram could only
[11:59] rebuke the sins they were doing back
[12:00] then because that's when he was alive.
[12:03] But brother Ram couldn't rebuke he
[12:04] couldn't foresee unless God told him
[12:06] what they were doing right now, right?
[12:10] So it's easy to press play because they
[12:11] know, oh, it's easy to keep all this and
[12:14] yet and yet they're not keeping all of
[12:15] it because brother Ram said preach until
[12:17] Jesus returns. Hallelujah. He said it
[12:20] six six times and then they say every
[12:23] word on tape is thus said the Lord.
[12:24] That's complete blasphemy and heresy
[12:27] and none of those are found in the
[12:28] Bible. So see he said brother said never
[12:31] add to it never take away from it. So do
[12:33] they really believe brother Ram? No they
[12:35] don't. They don't. Do they really
[12:37] believe the Bible? No they don't. Okay?
[12:40] Because they don't have genuine faith.
[12:42] But you and I, we want to have genuine
[12:44] faith.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; And we're accountable church. We're
[12:46] accountable to one another. That's why I
[12:48] said that earlier. Like brother Bram
[12:49] said, come to me privately if I'm off
[12:51] the word of God. I'm accountable to you
[12:53] and you're accountable to me. We're all
[12:56] accountable to everyone. Hallelujah.
[12:58] That's the body of Christ, right?
[13:00] Remember, the one part of the body can't
[13:02] say, "I don't need you or I don't need
[13:03] you." We all need one another.
[13:07] I love this quote. When I stand before
[13:08] Jesus, I want to be found innocent of
[13:10] ever trying to add one thing to that
[13:12] word or take one word away. Believe it
[13:15] exactly the way it is. teach the people
[13:17] and tow right up to it. Amen.
[13:22] Now, if you want to teach something or
[13:23] if you you you wonder what we believe,
[13:25] then then you can ask me, Brother Jesse,
[13:28] do you have two or three verses on that?
[13:30] You should ask me that. If I don't, I'll
[13:33] just say, "Well, that's this just my
[13:34] opinion,
[13:36] right? Because that's what the Bible
[13:38] says." Uh, woe to him that'll add or
[13:41] take anything away from this book. This
[13:42] is God's eternal truth. And in the day
[13:45] where there's people saying, "Oh, we
[13:46] don't need the Bible. It's been
[13:47] translated 15 times or more." How do we
[13:49] know it's right till heaven and earth
[13:50] passed away? God's word will never pass
[13:52] away. Every doctrine and everything else
[13:56] in the Bible, okay? So, you have
[13:58] doctrines, right? Uh then you just have
[14:00] truths, right? Or just the Bible calls
[14:03] them truths, right? You have Bibles, you
[14:04] have doctrines or teaching, then you
[14:06] have declarations, right? Preaching and
[14:09] teaching, right? So, you have teaching
[14:10] and just general preaching. Preaching is
[14:12] just declaring the truths of the Bible.
[14:14] Teaching is instructing. Doctrine is
[14:16] instructing how to live. Okay? So you
[14:19] have both those. Preaching and teaching.
[14:20] The Bible said Jesus preached and
[14:22] taught. Paul preached and taught. The
[14:24] apostles were preaching and teaching. So
[14:27] doctrine and everything else you preach
[14:29] must be based on the Bible. Everything
[14:31] we have in the church must be based upon
[14:33] the word of God. Must come from the
[14:34] word. Not just one place, but from
[14:36] Genesis to Revelation. It must say the
[14:38] same thing. because we cannot base our
[14:39] thoughts upon one little scripture. For
[14:42] the Bible said in the mouth of two or
[14:43] three witnesses, let every word be
[14:44] established.
[14:46] Okay?
[14:48] So, anything we teach and believe and
[14:50] you're you can ask me after service,
[14:52] brother Jesse, do you consider this
[14:53] doctrine? That's fine. Ask me. I'll do
[14:56] my best to tell you. Hallelujah.
[15:01] If it's not in the scriptures, it's a
[15:04] man-made doctrine. That's what Brother
[15:06] Ram says. We've been through the church
[15:08] ages and see where they had to do that.
[15:10] You So, you see, God wants somebody
[15:12] that'll obey him. If it's not in the
[15:14] scriptures, then it's a not a it's a
[15:16] man-made doctrine and not a Bible
[15:18] doctrine. So, regardless of what the
[15:20] church is, how you've been, uh what
[15:23] difference does it make, it's how right
[15:25] you can be right now. So, it doesn't
[15:27] matter, well, my mom did this or my
[15:29] grandpa believed that, uh that former
[15:32] man believed that 100 years ago. It's
[15:33] what does God's word say right now?
[15:36] What do we know about the Bible right
[15:38] now? Hallelujah.
[15:41] Uh, Brother Ram said when he was growing
[15:43] up, his mom told him uh he she said the
[15:46] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost is an
[15:47] abortion. That's what brother Ram's mom
[15:49] told him. You know why? Because brother
[15:51] brother Ram's mom didn't go to church
[15:52] very much. Right. So she was just told
[15:56] abortion. Oh, I'm sorry. It was suicide
[15:57] or abortion. One of those. Uh, so
[15:59] brother Ram grew up, you know, he and
[16:01] said God won't forgive you if you commit
[16:02] suicide or abortion.
[16:05] But church, should we hang on to that or
[16:07] should we go back to the word of God and
[16:08] see what blasphemy of the Holy Ghost is?
[16:11] So, so brother Ram had to grow. Well, I
[16:14] was told this all my life. That's fine
[16:15] what you're told all your life, but now
[16:17] take that back to the word of God and
[16:19] let's believe the rest of our life what
[16:20] the Bible says about it.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right, church?
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Your daddy might have told you this.
[16:26] Your mama might have told you that.
[16:28] Grandpa might have told you that. But
[16:29] let's see what God told us. Because
[16:32] remember Jesus comes back, church, what
[16:34] name does he have on his vesture?
[16:37] Anybody remember
[16:39] the word of God? I wasn't trying to do a
[16:42] trick question. I'm sorry. What name?
[16:44] The Bible says he's got a name on his
[16:45] vesture. It's dipped in blood and his
[16:47] name is called the word of God.
[16:50] Hallelujah. In the beginning was the
[16:53] word and the word was with God and the
[16:54] word was God. That's right. John uh 1
[16:58] John 5:7 says there's three that bear
[17:00] record in heaven. The father, the word,
[17:04] and the holy ghost. Good. So there's all
[17:07] these witnesses. Jesus is the word. His
[17:10] character is the word. Hallelujah. This
[17:12] is Jesus Christ in letter form. Amen.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; So we don't take away from Jesus Christ.
[17:17] We don't add to Jesus Christ. We just
[17:19] believe Jesus Christ.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; His name is called the word of God. And
[17:26] that's why I get so fired up with false
[17:27] doctrine, everything like that. But
[17:28] church, I also I don't want to get too
[17:30] uh focused on them. I want to look at my
[17:32] life. I want to I want to make sure my
[17:33] life, my lamps are constantly being
[17:35] trimmed as well. Right? I just don't
[17:38] want to attack that attack. Let me look
[17:40] at my heart and say, "Lord, is my heart
[17:42] pure before you?"
[17:44] Okay? But I thought, especially for the
[17:46] young people, I really want them to see,
[17:48] and you young uh teenagers, I really
[17:50] want you to see how much brother Ram
[17:52] emphasized the Bible. So you'll know
[17:54] that's why your pastor emphasizes the
[17:56] Bible. Hallelujah. And then you'll know
[17:58] when you listen to other preachers,
[17:59] you'll know whether they're emphasizing
[18:01] the Bible. Hallelujah. That way no man
[18:05] can deceive you because you know the
[18:07] Bible.
[18:09] That's what I want Malachi to do to my
[18:11] son. I want my sons and my daughters to
[18:13] know the word so well. Nobody can
[18:15] deceive them. And then they'll teach
[18:17] others. Amen. Like you're doing, buddy.
[18:20] Keep it up. Hallelujah.
[18:22] We must prove all things by the
[18:24] scripture AND THE SCRIPTURE IS ALWAYS
[18:26] RIGHT. And brother said, I'm wrong if I
[18:28] say something contrary to scripture. I
[18:31] love this quote.
[18:33] Now, we must prove all things. Some
[18:35] things. Some
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, where'd he get that? Uh, 1
[18:38] Thessalonians 5:21.
[18:40] That's the Bible. You prove all things
[18:44] by the Bible. Everything. Everybody say
[18:46] everything. Ready? Everything. So
[18:48] everything on brother's tapes, you got
[18:50] to take it back to the Bible or you're
[18:52] disobeying the Bible and Brother
[18:54] Brandham.
[18:55] Hallelujah.
[18:57] And even your pastor or even uh uh
[19:00] Brother Brad, he's going to come on.
[19:01] We're going to meet him on Saturday
[19:03] night. Whoever it is, you take
[19:05] everything they say back to the
[19:07] scripture. If not, you're getting lazy.
[19:11] I'll say like this. The word of God is
[19:12] becoming common to you. It's no longer
[19:14] precious. I'll say it like this. You're
[19:17] no longer trembling at the word of God
[19:19] like you ought to.
[19:21] And I'm not saying be scared about the
[19:22] preacher. I'm just saying if you don't
[19:24] if you're not sure, go read your Bible.
[19:26] Go search it by the Bible.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Don't just swallow it down or just I'll
[19:30] worry about it later. You know, if take
[19:31] some time, spend some time with God.
[19:33] Study the word of God. Spend some time
[19:35] in his presence. Say, Lord, open this up
[19:37] to me.
[19:40] We must prove all things by the
[19:42] scripture. If it's contrary to my faith,
[19:44] I love this. And yet the scripture says,
[19:46] "So the scriptur is right and I'm
[19:48] wrong." [laughter]
[19:50] Amen. IN OTHER WORDS, THE BIBLE'S ALWAYS
[19:52] RIGHT. HALLELUJAH.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can do anything.
[19:56] How many want to do something tonight?
[19:58] &gt;&gt; I want Jesus Christ to help you tonight.
[20:00] The only way we can do that is if we
[20:02] come back to the scripture.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; So somebody's help tonight. Don't just
[20:08] believe Brother Jesse. Every time he
[20:09] says something, you go look it up
[20:10] yourself. Make sure I said it right.
[20:13] Hallelujah.
[20:15] Now, is that true? I like to hear you
[20:17] say amen when you believe it. You see,
[20:20] amen means so be it. I like to hear you
[20:23] say amen, too. And I love this quote. I
[20:27] can be wrong. And brother says, I will
[20:29] alter or change my ideas to match the
[20:31] Bible.
[20:34] Now, before we try to start to undertake
[20:36] to answer these questions, and just
[20:38] remember that I can be wrong, but they
[20:41] say every word on tape is thus sayith
[20:42] the Lord. So it proves they're deceived
[20:45] by an evil spirit because they don't
[20:47] believe that. They don't believe every
[20:50] word can be wrong. Remember church in
[20:52] that sermon souls under the altar. Now
[20:54] brother Ram says time might be over. In
[20:56] other words, brother Ram thought there
[20:58] would be a time where God cuts everybody
[21:00] off before the rapture and then
[21:01] whoever's filthy is filthy still.
[21:03] Whoever's holy holy still. Brother
[21:05] Random prays at the end of that sermon.
[21:06] This was in 1963. Brother Rod. He said,
[21:08] 'Lord, I pray that I'm wrong.
[21:12] and he was wrong. So, how can that be
[21:15] thus sayith the Lord? When he said, uh,
[21:18] this could be the end and there's no
[21:19] more people being saved. How can that be
[21:21] thus sayith the Lord when at the end he
[21:23] says, I I pray I'm wrong and he was
[21:26] wrong. How could he be right and say
[21:28] there's no that that there's no more
[21:30] time left? How could that be right and
[21:31] nobody else is getting saved? I've been
[21:33] saved. Brother Ro has been saved. You've
[21:36] been saved. So, PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING
[21:38] SAVED. AMEN. How do you know? I feel it
[21:40] in my heart. I FEEL IT IN MY SOUL.
[21:42] HALLELUJAH. I know I'm saved. Amen.
[21:45] Right. We're walking in a different
[21:47] life. We have a new heart now. Our heart
[21:49] loves the WORD OF GOD. NOT a stony
[21:51] heart. We have a heart of flesh.
[21:53] Hallelujah. That Jesus can write his
[21:55] commands on our hearts and we rejoice in
[21:57] the commands of God.
[22:00] Before you fought against the word of
[22:02] God, but now you welcome it. Say, "God,
[22:04] change my heart. I want to live that. I
[22:06] want to believe that. Lord, raise my
[22:08] faith. write it upon the fleshly tables
[22:10] of my heart.
[22:14] Now, I try to be right, but maybe I'm
[22:16] wrong. And if I'm wrong, then you just
[22:18] forgive me. Same thing for me. If I'm
[22:20] wrong, you forgive me, church. I don't
[22:22] want to be wrong. I pray God will, too,
[22:25] because I don't mean to be wrong. I
[22:27] don't try to answer them just the way
[22:29] that just for prejudice. I'm not trying
[22:31] to be prejudice. I answer them the very
[22:34] best of my knowledge. See, and if I have
[22:36] to alter my ideas on a Bible question, I
[22:38] think that's just the thing to do. We
[22:42] should alter any time when God's word
[22:45] speaks because it's God's word.
[22:48] Thank you, Lord, for a prophet who loved
[22:51] the Bible.
[22:52] This is another reason I know William
[22:54] Brandham was a prophet of God.
[22:56] Hallelujah.
[22:57] Because he's always pointing us back to
[22:59] the word of God.
[23:03] Now, this is interesting. He's talking
[23:05] about numerology. So, like seven seals,
[23:07] uh, seven church ages, seven
[23:08] candlesticks, right? Seven vials. He
[23:11] just says the numbers, the num, he calls
[23:13] them pneumatics. Uh, but I think he
[23:15] means numerology. He's talking about
[23:16] seven lamps, seven stars, seven spirits
[23:18] of God, uh, seven seats uh, for the uh,
[23:22] 24 elders uh, seven. Okay. Seven
[23:25] manifestations, seven lamps. Oh my. He
[23:28] says laid there in the pneumatics of the
[23:30] Bible. Pneumatics of the Bible is the
[23:31] most perfect thing there is on earth.
[23:33] You can't get one flaw from Genesis to
[23:35] Revelation is the pneumatics of the
[23:37] Bible. There's no other piece of
[23:39] literature that's like the Bible that's
[23:41] totally perfect in everything inside of
[23:43] it. Okay? So, I just want you to show
[23:46] that it's the most perfect thing there
[23:47] is on earth. And church, you've got a
[23:49] copy.
[23:51] My I'm I'm searching for something in my
[23:53] life. Where's something that's perfect?
[23:54] Where's something that'll help me?
[23:55] Where's something I can lean upon? And
[23:57] you've got three or four copies at your
[23:58] house. I think we need some more time in
[24:01] the Bible.
[24:02] It's perfect. It's a light to our feet
[24:05] and a lamp unto our path. Hallelujah.
[24:08] The word of God.
[24:12] Now, the Bible said the watchman that
[24:13] stands on the tower, Ezekiel speaks of
[24:15] that. If he sees the enemy coming and
[24:16] fails to warn them people, God will
[24:18] require their blood at his hands. But if
[24:21] he does warn them, they fail to take
[24:23] heed, then their blood's on their own
[24:24] hand. How many know Ezekiel said that?
[24:27] So that's what I try to do. I try to
[24:28] warn about this oncoming ecumenical
[24:30] move. They're going to try to unite
[24:32] Protestants and Catholics. Anyone who
[24:34] unites with that, they will have the
[24:36] mark of the beast and go to hell. I've
[24:38] warned you
[24:40] &gt;&gt; and I've warned myself. Brother Ram
[24:42] warned us of that. Brother Ram said the
[24:44] mark of the beast is organizationalism.
[24:47] It's that organization that's they're
[24:49] going to unite. You can't buy or sell
[24:51] without that mark. And it's going to be
[24:53] tied into religion. Hallelujah.
[24:57] So, I've warned you. Now, it's your job
[24:59] to warn other people.
[25:02] And I've warned different people in our
[25:03] family here, uh, at the church, even my
[25:05] own family. I told my mom, I said, "Thus
[25:08] sayith the Lord, or brother said, thus
[25:10] sayith the Lord." Every denomination
[25:12] will take the mark of the beast. So, I
[25:14] said, "You better come out of it." And
[25:15] they will because they just keep getting
[25:16] further and further away from the word
[25:17] of God. When have they ever repented of
[25:19] any of their false teachings? They never
[25:21] do. They just get more. Right now, the
[25:24] Catholic gave up one of the millions of
[25:26] them and they said, "Well, Mary's no
[25:28] longer a redeemer. She how could she
[25:31] redeem? She's a sinner. She's unworthy
[25:33] to be a redeemer." Well, they repented
[25:35] of one. Now, let's now let's start going
[25:36] that trans. Let's keep going then. Don't
[25:38] stop there. Don't stop with one. If
[25:40] you're going to clean house, let's clean
[25:41] all the house. Praise Let's get all the
[25:43] leaven out. Praise God.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; You think they're going to do that? Nah,
[25:46] I don't think so.
[25:48] Nope.
[25:50] And I would say and I want to say at the
[25:52] end of my road when someday you pick up
[25:54] a paper read that I passed on or what
[25:56] way you would hear I want to say in
[25:58] leaving this life I've not shun but to
[26:00] declare unto you the whole council of
[26:02] God. That's what Paul said. Paul said
[26:04] that in the book of Acts chapter 20 he
[26:06] says and so that staying with the word
[26:09] then I know I'm right but if I get off
[26:11] the word then I'm wrong.
[26:14] Same thing for every preacher.
[26:17] Now, what do we call it? We call the
[26:18] message. Brother Ram says the message is
[26:21] the scriptures God's vindicating right
[26:23] now. That's what brother Ram says the
[26:25] message is. It's not every word on tape.
[26:27] The message that we call the message,
[26:28] why we're called a message church is
[26:30] because we believe the Bible scriptures
[26:32] God fulfilled brother Brandham to
[26:34] fulfill Bible verses. Not outside the
[26:37] Bible, but verses in the Bible. That's
[26:40] the message, right? All those verses. I
[26:42] went through them and I got them here on
[26:44] another slide. I could probably show
[26:45] them. Let me uh yeah, let me skip down.
[26:47] I think I got time because it's only se
[26:49] 7 7:30. Yeah. Okay. I'm at slide 173.
[26:55] Uh let me see if I got them down here.
[26:59] I just had a thought. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[27:03] Okay. Yeah. Now, if you if you look at
[27:05] my book uh from 2021, the 13th chapter,
[27:08] six passages of scripture declare this
[27:11] authoritative biblical truth about
[27:13] Elijah's spear in the end time. So I
[27:15] challenge anybody read these and online
[27:18] listeners online. Read these and see if
[27:21] you don't get this from those verses.
[27:23] Jesus will remain in heaven and not
[27:25] physically return to the earth until all
[27:27] things including all Bible doctrines and
[27:30] the hearts of believers are restored to
[27:32] the original apostolic conditions by the
[27:34] preaching of a prophet anointed with the
[27:37] spirit of Elijah.
[27:39] Hallelujah. Amen. These are the verses
[27:42] that tell us God had to send a prophet
[27:45] with the spirit of Elijah to restore all
[27:47] things to finish the mystery of God.
[27:50] Hallelujah. They're in there. And to
[27:52] deny one of those, you've denied your
[27:54] Bible. Hallelujah. And I gave I gave
[27:57] everybody a free copy if you want a free
[27:58] copy of that book. Amen. Uh I hope you
[28:00] read them by God's grace. But see, uh
[28:03] that's the message. This is the message,
[28:05] right? This is the word of God. Now, uh
[28:08] I didn't I'm not going to get to this,
[28:09] but I found 12. There's 12 in the Bible,
[28:11] Brother talks about that are called
[28:12] mysteries. Six of them we have thus
[28:14] sayith the Lord on. So we have thus
[28:17] sayith the Lord on Israel's blindness,
[28:19] the seven church ages, uh the mystery of
[28:21] iniquity, Babylon, the Roman Catholic
[28:23] Church, and the Godhead. God's not three
[28:25] persons. God's one person. Thus sayith
[28:28] the Lord, the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[28:30] Christ in you. It's thus sayaith the
[28:32] Lord.
[28:33] Okay. U and then we went through these,
[28:36] remember? I think I got 20 42 total,
[28:38] man.
[28:40] So let's just we have we have thus
[28:42] sayith the Lord on all these. It's the
[28:43] Bible giving us I'm sorry it's us
[28:46] understanding the Bible.
[28:48] Okay. So some of these are repeats,
[28:50] right? But there's nine.
[28:53] There's uh eight more. How many remember
[28:56] we preach on the prove all things or not
[28:58] prove all things? It was we have thus
[28:59] sayith the Lord series. Just three
[29:00] sermons. I preached when Rod was here
[29:02] because I thought it might be new to him
[29:03] and he he said he liked hearing me
[29:05] preach about the prophets and prophecy.
[29:08] And then there's six uh fulfilled thus
[29:09] sayith the lords. And here's 27 total.
[29:12] Now in the book I got 11 future
[29:14] prophecies about United States mark of
[29:16] the beast Rome. There's 11 of them. And
[29:19] then uh one two three four more for a
[29:21] total of 42. Now church none of us know
[29:23] anybody who gave us 42 thus say the
[29:25] Lord. There's not a person who's done
[29:27] that. Only God's prophet brother Random.
[29:30] Hallelujah. And if so let's see him. If
[29:33] you got something better let's see it.
[29:35] Here I am. I'm waiting. Should I start a
[29:38] timer on my watch? See, next time I get
[29:40] an email, someone show me all who's
[29:42] somebody's got more thus sayith the
[29:43] Lord's in this time that have come to
[29:45] pass. I think I'll be waiting a long
[29:47] time. I think my battery is going to run
[29:48] out on my watch. Hallelujah. That's
[29:51] right. I'm not saying that to be angry.
[29:52] I'm just saying that because that's the
[29:54] truth. It proves God sent William
[29:56] Brandom as a prophet.
[29:58] Okay. So, there's 40. What' I say? 47.
[30:02] 42. Hallelujah. 42. Brother Mercy. Not
[30:06] one, 42.
[30:09] 42. Thus sayith the Lord's. That the
[30:12] message is turning our hearts back to
[30:15] the apostolic teaching. So when I teach
[30:18] something, it should come out of here
[30:19] with two or three Bible witnesses. All
[30:22] right, everybody got that? Good. Got
[30:24] some good listening ears here tonight.
[30:25] Praise God. I know everybody's tired.
[30:26] It's been a long day. I had a long day,
[30:28] too. I worked long hours, too. Not as
[30:31] long as somebody. God bless your heart,
[30:33] man. Okay. Bless your heart, buddy.
[30:35] Let's go back to this.
[30:38] So, see, that's why we can be so bold.
[30:40] That's why for 11 years I've been on
[30:41] YouTube like, "Somebody come show me
[30:43] where I'm wrong." And nobody can show me
[30:44] where I'm wrong. And I'm not I'm not
[30:46] bragging about that, but I'm just saying
[30:48] spiritually, it's like Joshua. God told
[30:50] Joshua, "If you can keep THE WORD OF
[30:52] GOD, NO MAN WILL BE ABLE TO STAND BEFORE
[30:54] YOU ALL the days of your life." And no
[30:56] man's been able to to disprove any of
[30:58] these beliefs all these days of my life.
[31:00] Hallelujah. That I've been preaching the
[31:01] word of God. And that's not bragging ON
[31:03] ME. THAT'S BRAGGING ON WHAT GOD REVEALED
[31:05] TO US BECAUSE GOD HAS TO FINISH THE
[31:07] MYSTERY of God. It has to happen at the
[31:09] end time. Hallelujah. Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; One of these days I'm going to preach a
[31:13] sermon in the sealed book because God
[31:15] told Daniel, I'm going to seal up that
[31:17] book. And then he says to the until the
[31:19] end time.
[31:22] So that's 500 years before Christ. He
[31:24] says, "Seal up the book." But then the
[31:26] Bible says in Revelation which was uh
[31:29] 500 years later uh 500 uh yeah 600 years
[31:33] later he says the books now the seals
[31:35] have been torn off and the book was sent
[31:37] down to earth to finish the mystery of
[31:38] God. Hallelujah. If you trace that
[31:41] through the Bible sometime there's got
[31:43] to be a time when the seals are broken
[31:46] off the book and God's people understand
[31:48] the mysteries. This is the time we
[31:51] understand. We're blessed of the Lord.
[31:53] Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; WE'RE THE CHILDREN OF GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[31:56] AMEN.
[31:59] And even Rod was saying that. He said he
[32:01] went online looking for a an
[32:02] oldfashioned Holy Ghost fil group and he
[32:04] found us. Right, Brother Rod?
[32:06] Hallelujah. Amen. See, he wanted to find
[32:08] somebody who believed the Bible,
[32:10] somebody that loved the Bible, somebody
[32:11] who believed in the truth, someone who
[32:13] believed in all the WORD OF GOD. AND GOD
[32:15] f helped him to FIND IT. GOD SHOWED HIM
[32:18] WHO BELIEVES THE WORD OF GOD.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm a little more excited than I
[32:22] thought I'd be. So, pardon me. I guess
[32:24] I'm just thankful. I'm just I'm just
[32:26] thankful, church. Okay, it's just it's
[32:28] same pastor, same brother Jesse, same
[32:30] I'm just a little excited tonight by
[32:32] God's grace
[32:33] &gt;&gt; because I see it. I see God gave US A
[32:35] PROPHET 42 THUS SAYITH THE LORD'S. AMEN.
[32:38] SAYS, DON'T ADD TO THE WORD. NEVER TAKE
[32:40] ONE WORD AWAY. If you have genuine faith
[32:42] in God's WORD, YOU'LL NEVER ADD. YOU'LL
[32:44] NEVER TAKE AWAY. THAT PROVES YOU'RE THE
[32:46] CHILD OF GOD.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Because God's children will never add or
[32:50] take away from his word.
[32:52] But every one of these denominations
[32:53] does it. Hallelujah. They say, "Well,
[32:56] no, you women can wear makeup. You women
[32:58] can trim your hair a little bit. You've
[33:00] just taken away from the word of God or
[33:02] added to it."
[33:04] Hallelujah. Glory. Now, Brother said his
[33:07] message is to bring the people back to
[33:10] the word of God.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Notice now quickly now, Brother Jesse.
[33:15] Quickly, Brother Jesse. Now, she's in
[33:17] that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[33:19] We're in the Leosian church age. That's
[33:20] thus sayith the Lord.
[33:22] Now, her messenger is promised in
[33:23] Malachi the 4th chapter, he's promised
[33:25] to do it. And the message is to bring
[33:27] the people back to the word. Bring the
[33:30] people back to the word. And I am uh
[33:33] birth is to be she's to be delivered of
[33:35] a new birth from according to Malachi 4.
[33:39] Hallelujah.
[33:41] That's right. Now, I don't understand
[33:42] that last statement. I didn't study that
[33:44] quote uh fully. I just stopped at the
[33:46] blue. So, pardon me. I don't quite
[33:47] understand that.
[33:49] Again, he says, "The message is to bring
[33:51] the people back to the word." And
[33:52] notice, word by word, every word of the
[33:57] Bible.
[33:59] Now, church, remember the junction
[34:00] saints? Remember the brother Rod, two
[34:02] years ago, I baptized 17 of them in the
[34:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. They left
[34:06] the Amish denomination. And they said
[34:08] their pastor wouldn't even preach out of
[34:10] Revelation. Wouldn't even preach out of
[34:11] Daniel. They were so afraid that people
[34:13] might get some revelation that they
[34:15] said, "Don't even read it.
[34:19] Right. So, they're clearly clearly these
[34:21] men, not all of them, but some of the
[34:22] Amish communities are taking away.
[34:24] They're saying, "Don't even read it."
[34:26] But we're not afraid of it because the
[34:28] Holy Spirit's here.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the giver of
[34:31] revelation. If the Holy Ghost is here
[34:33] and he wrote it, he can let us know what
[34:35] it means. Hallelujah.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; That's one example of of people taking
[34:40] away from the word of God. I'm telling
[34:42] you, read your Bibles. I'm telling you,
[34:45] listen to Brother Brandham. I'm telling
[34:47] you, listen to other preachers that have
[34:48] the Holy Ghost that are still alive
[34:49] today. AMEN. TAKE EVERYTHING BACK TO THE
[34:53] WORD. PROVE ALL THINGS. See what THE
[34:54] HOLY GHOST WILL REVEAL TO YOU.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Stay in the word. Meditate on the
[34:59] word of God. No man or woman will be
[35:01] able to stand before you ALL THE DAYS OF
[35:03] YOUR LIFE IF YOU stand on the word of
[35:05] God.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:10] What she used to be the same bride, the
[35:12] same kind as the day of Pentecost,
[35:13] right? the bride built out of the same
[35:15] kind of material that she was in the
[35:16] first place. Now read Malachi 4 and see
[35:18] if we're not supposed to have a message
[35:20] in the last days that'll turn the hearts
[35:22] of the children back to the fathers back
[35:24] to the original Pentecostal message word
[35:27] by word. Brothers, we are here.
[35:31] Bride of Christ Fellowship, we are here.
[35:35] Amen. Every word of the BIBLE IS
[35:37] SUPPOSED TO BE RESTORED BACK TO US and
[35:39] we're supposed to believe it.
[35:42] church. Don't let it become common to
[35:44] you. If church has become boring or
[35:46] common reading your Bible, you better
[35:48] get down. You better pray. Brother said,
[35:50] "Pray until you're changed.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Don't stop praying until you feel
[35:55] different about God's word
[35:57] &gt;&gt; or preaching or praying or whatever it
[35:59] is. Don't stop praying until your
[36:02] attitude has changed and you've repented
[36:04] and God has given you a fresh
[36:06] transformation of the mind."
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:10] Don't let it become common.
[36:13] Now remember, brother Ramon said,
[36:15] "Always be careful how you're listening
[36:16] to him." Not say, "Every word is thus
[36:18] say the Lord." He never said that. He
[36:20] said, "Be careful how you're listening."
[36:23] Now, I've always asked you to be careful
[36:24] what you're listening to. See, there's
[36:25] so much of it. It's just a human side.
[36:28] But always, if there's something that
[36:29] goes forth, it will speak it. It's thus
[36:31] sayith the Lord, even divisions and
[36:32] anything. Now, remember the the context
[36:35] of this. A month before, Brother Random
[36:37] said Martin Luther King Jr. is going to
[36:39] lead a million of these uh black people
[36:42] to a like a Hitler-like genocide, like a
[36:45] civil war down in the South. Brother Bam
[36:47] said, "You watch me. I'm on tape." And
[36:49] so they asked him the ne next month,
[36:50] "Was that thus say the Lord?" And
[36:52] brother Bam said, "I've always asked you
[36:53] to be careful what you're listening to."
[36:56] Brother Bam said, "I have nothing on it
[36:57] from the Lord." In that moment, he was
[37:00] stirred up. There's going to be a se
[37:01] segregation war. There's going to be a
[37:03] racial war. And brother said, "I'm even
[37:05] on tape." But he didn't say, "Thus say
[37:06] the Lord.
[37:09] What did he say? He said uh that the
[37:13] racial integration problem there in the
[37:14] 60s, it's inspired of the wrong thing.
[37:16] He's talking about Martin Luther King
[37:17] Jr. and church. They found out there's a
[37:19] lot of things wrong with Martin Luther
[37:20] King Jr. I guess he was adulterer heavy
[37:23] heavy adulterer and didn't even believe
[37:26] the Bible. I heard some things he
[37:27] preached on tape and I'm like, what'd he
[37:28] say? He was like saying how the
[37:31] resurrection was uh wasn't even a fact.
[37:34] There are certain elements of the
[37:35] resurrection of Jesus that weren't even
[37:36] a fact. like who made this guy a hero?
[37:40] Who was that president that did that?
[37:42] Probably probably Johnson. Was it
[37:43] Johnson? These guys.
[37:46] This is part of the wrong thing. See
[37:48] them people. That's the reason I say it.
[37:50] Not that there's any prophecy concerning
[37:52] it. Brother Ram said Martin Luther King
[37:55] Jr. is going to lead them about million
[37:56] souls into a death trap. He said, "I'm
[37:59] on tape." A month later, he says, "I
[38:02] don't have anything on it from the Lord.
[38:04] I have nothing on it from the Lord.
[38:07] He just thought, "Well, we've had racial
[38:08] wars before." That's basically what the
[38:11] Holocaust was, right? A racial war
[38:12] against the Jews. They just got done
[38:15] with it in 45. Here is 20 years later,
[38:17] he says, "It's probably going to be the
[38:18] same thing happen again." He says, "I
[38:20] have nothing on it from the Lord." And
[38:21] you be sure now if I say anything from
[38:23] the Lord like that to tell you it's
[38:25] always I'm speaking now, but when he
[38:27] speaks, I say it's not me. It's thus
[38:30] sayeth the Lord.
[38:32] And I can't say it to tells me. I could
[38:35] be altogether wrong in my thought about
[38:36] Martin Luther King. I don't know. I
[38:38] can't say that's just my
[38:41] opinion.
[38:43] Church, prophets are allowed their
[38:45] opinions. You ought to be happy. You're
[38:46] allowed your opinions, too. God doesn't
[38:49] force you to think everything the same
[38:50] as brother or sister. He allows you to
[38:54] have your own opinions. That's a
[38:55] merciful God.
[38:57] But it's a test, right? It's a test. It
[38:59] shows who really worships Brother
[39:00] Brandon or who really worships Ernest
[39:01] Angley or who really worships Billy
[39:03] Graham and who doesn't. When people
[39:05] start making every word infallible,
[39:07] they've officially got an evil seducing
[39:10] deity spirit. They have an antichrist
[39:12] spirit
[39:13] because they'll deny this quote and they
[39:16] say they believe every word is thus
[39:17] sayith the Lord. Brother Chris,
[39:21] well, at the beginning, Brother Ram said
[39:22] he was good, but we know at the end he
[39:24] definitely got off at the end. Big time
[39:26] he got off. Rod sent me some videos.
[39:27] I've seen numerous ones, too. He said
[39:29] abortion was okay in the in the moments
[39:31] of rape or in the I saw I'm like, "Bro,
[39:34] oh man." Uh, and he had these ideas like
[39:37] you could get saved in any religion. He
[39:38] thought the Muslims could be saved and
[39:40] the Hindus and all kinds of nonsense. He
[39:42] was way off the word of God. You can't
[39:44] be saved except confessing your sins by
[39:45] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[39:49] He says, "That's just my opinion." Oh,
[39:51] yeah. There I even heard I watched that
[39:53] video, too. At the beginning he was
[39:55] preaching against uh uh protestants and
[39:58] Catholics uniting and then something
[40:00] switched. So before he preached against
[40:02] Catholics and then he started uniting
[40:04] with Catholics and that's from that time
[40:07] on that's when I think it was in the
[40:08] late uh or maybe early 50s. I have to go
[40:11] check it. Remind me if you want me to
[40:13] find it for you.
[40:16] Now brother Bam says anything he teaches
[40:18] it can't be my opinion. It has to be the
[40:20] word. Yeah. Another uh clock.
[40:33] Yeah. Yes. You can still listen to their
[40:35] good preaching. Just like Balum. Aren't
[40:37] you glad the three wise men listened to
[40:39] Balam's prophecy?
[40:41] Balam was a wicked man, right? He went
[40:42] to hell. But his prophecy about Jesus
[40:44] was right. They followed the star of
[40:45] Jacob. Yeah, you sure can, brother.
[40:49] Yeah. Uh but but you always got to use
[40:51] your discernment. Don't turn off your
[40:52] discernment, right? And same thing for
[40:54] me or anybody anytime you listen to
[40:55] Billy Graham or I don't do it much at
[40:57] all. Maybe once or twice. Uh just
[40:59] because I know I know what he turned
[41:00] into. But if you do that, you got to
[41:02] turn on got to have your discernment
[41:04] ready to go. You don't want to swallow
[41:05] down any lies.
[41:08] Definitely not. Yep. Definitely not.
[41:10] Definitely not, brother. Yes, you're
[41:11] right about that, brother. You're right,
[41:13] brother. Now, his dad knew Brother
[41:15] Brandham. His dad's brother Brandon knew
[41:18] him and his name's on tape. Uh John
[41:19] Ostein. John Ostein preached some type
[41:22] of holiness. And now look what his son
[41:24] became.
[41:26] It's really sad. You're right, brother.
[41:30] Now remember these things that I say
[41:32] must come must must not just your own
[41:34] thoughts or dreams or visions or
[41:36] anything like that or own imagination.
[41:37] They must come from the word of God. It
[41:41] can't be my own opinion because my
[41:43] opinion is just like anybody else's. Oh
[41:46] no. Brother's opinion is way more
[41:47] important than ours. Is it? Is that what
[41:49] he said?
[41:51] Now, do we respect do we respect
[41:52] prophets? Of course. But what did the
[41:55] prophet say about his opinion? He said,
[41:57] "My opinion is just the same as anybody
[41:58] else." An opinion is an idea that's
[42:01] based upon something that might not be
[42:03] factual. That's what an opinion is.
[42:07] But people say, "Well, I'll take
[42:08] brother's opinion over somebody else."
[42:09] Well, that's fine. You can do that. You
[42:11] have the freedom to do that. But don't
[42:12] condemn people that don't because you're
[42:14] off the word of God. If it's not, thus
[42:16] say the Lord, it's not from the word of
[42:17] God. It's just his opinion.
[42:19] And stop trying to make a man's opinion
[42:21] deity when it's not deity. It's not
[42:23] inspired unless it's got thus sayith the
[42:25] Lord or it goes back to the word of God.
[42:30] See?
[42:31] See? But it's got to be in continuity
[42:33] with the word of God. Remember, God
[42:35] keeps everything in continuity. He never
[42:37] changes. He's the same yesterday, today,
[42:39] and forever. Do you believe that
[42:41] he's the same?
[42:44] Now, I want to get I want to close with
[42:45] this. It's almost time to close.
[42:48] Now, all the time you hear these people
[42:50] say, "Just say what the tape say." Just
[42:51] say what the tape say. Brother Ram also
[42:53] said, "Just say what the Bible says."
[42:56] So, which one are you going to do,
[42:58] church? Which one are you going to do?
[43:00] Oh my pressure. Somebody turn up the
[43:02] heat in here, Brother Jesse.
[43:05] Church, it's so simple. Just take
[43:07] everything Brother Ram said back to the
[43:09] Bible. If it's in the Bible, believe it.
[43:12] It's not the Bible, just put it up on a
[43:14] shelf. Just be regular. Just be a common
[43:17] believer. Just be a real faithful
[43:19] believer. And but if you look at these
[43:21] quotes where brother Ram said, just say
[43:22] what the tapes say, you'll understand
[43:24] what he is saying if you listen to the
[43:27] context of them. But I like this one. I
[43:30] can't wait to use this one. I'm going to
[43:32] try to trap I shouldn't say that. I
[43:34] don't want to trap them, but I want I
[43:35] want them to see their folly.
[43:38] How can you say you're a Christian and
[43:39] disobey one word in one thing? Whosoever
[43:43] disobeyed the law and one part of it was
[43:44] guilty of all of it. Whosoever Jesus
[43:46] said, man shall not live by bread alone,
[43:48] but by every word that proceeds out of
[43:49] the mouth of God, not just part of the
[43:51] words, every word. Then he said in
[43:52] Revelation the 22nd chapter, whosoever
[43:54] should take one word out of this book or
[43:56] add one word to it, his part will be
[43:58] taken out of the book of life. We're not
[44:00] to take away from the Bible or add to
[44:02] it, just say what it says.
[44:06] They say, "Preacher, sit down and press
[44:08] play." That's not what the Bible says,
[44:10] so I'm not going to say that.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:15] Amen. The Bible doesn't say just press,
[44:18] play, and obey. So, I'm just going to
[44:19] say what the Bible says.
[44:22] The Bible said preach until we come to a
[44:25] unity of the faith.
[44:28] And we're still not unified. Last time I
[44:29] checked, Brother Rod, with the Methodist
[44:31] church, right? Or the Pentecostal
[44:33] church. The Methodist church telling you
[44:35] not to say amen. Uh we're still not
[44:37] unified on that. We better keep
[44:38] preaching. Or a Baptist church or a
[44:40] Pentecost, whoever it may be. And I'm
[44:42] just using that as a funny example.
[44:44] In other words, we're going to keep
[44:45] preaching till all the Holy Ghost fil
[44:47] believers are united on the word of God
[44:51] because we'll never unite with the
[44:52] foolish virgins all the way. We'll never
[44:54] unite with unbelievers or make
[44:55] believers. We'll only unite with the
[44:57] bride of Jesus Christ.
[44:59] Just say what it says. Preacher, just
[45:03] say what the Bible says.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Bam. I'll do that by God's
[45:08] grace.
[45:09] You know why? Because we're judged by
[45:11] the Bible. Abraham said, "If it don't
[45:13] make any difference, why did I'm sorry.
[45:14] If it don't make a difference how
[45:15] they're baptizing, why did Paul command
[45:17] them Christians praising God, have a lot
[45:18] of joy?" He's talking about uh Acts
[45:20] chapter 18. Is it 18? No, 19. Acts 19.
[45:26] And them having great things going up on
[45:27] there. Why did he tell them you got to
[45:28] come back and be baptized over again in
[45:30] the name of Jesus Christ? Is Acts 19 1-6
[45:32] uh down in Ephesus.
[45:35] See, take the word. Just stay with it.
[45:37] Don't say nothing different. Whoa. What?
[45:40] Don't say nothing different than what
[45:41] just what the Bible says. Nothing
[45:44] different.
[45:45] Just say what the Bible says. Nothing
[45:48] different. Just say what it says. See,
[45:50] that's what we're going to be judged by.
[45:54] Hallelujah. So, I want to be I want to
[45:55] be uh faithful in telling you just what
[45:57] the Bible says, not what I think or
[46:01] anybody else thinks, what the Bible
[46:02] says.
[46:07] You know why? Because it's a curse. Just
[46:08] like the Bible says to add or take away
[46:10] one word from the Bible, an angel would
[46:13] preach anything else. He's quoting
[46:15] Galatians 1 8 uh 8 9 10 11 12 then
[46:19] already when what's been said in the
[46:21] Bible, let him be cursed. Nobody can
[46:22] can't do that. It must be just exactly
[46:24] the way it says. And again, we read
[46:27] Revelations 22:18. If any man will add
[46:29] one word to this or take one word from
[46:30] it, God will take his part out of the
[46:32] book of life. Right? God will take his
[46:34] part. or though he be a minister
[46:36] whatever he may be his name might be
[46:38] Rrook wrote on the book of life but God
[46:40] said I'll just rub it off that's right
[46:42] if he adds one thing to it or takes one
[46:44] word from it that's how infallible God
[46:46] has made his word see you can't add to
[46:48] the church or take from the church you
[46:50] can't add that to the word or take from
[46:52] it because God will take your name right
[46:54] off the book of life and he says you're
[46:56] finished then you're just finished then
[46:58] you can't add to it or take away from it
[47:02] now church God's hearing your amens
[47:03] tonight in heaven
[47:06] Hallelujah, brother Chris.
[47:19] Well, that's the thing. God God has
[47:21] fornowledge. So God would know whether
[47:23] they're going to do that. So God never
[47:24] would blot it out if they were going to
[47:26] eventually repent because God fornows
[47:28] God knows all that are his. Yeah, good
[47:31] question. Give two. Good question.
[47:33] Okay. So, brother Ram said, "Just say
[47:35] what the Bible says. Say nothing else.
[47:37] Never say anything else." But then he
[47:38] says, "Just say what the tapes say." So,
[47:40] this needs balance out. But Ram said,
[47:43] "Listen, may I say this right quick?
[47:45] Even the vision God gives here at the
[47:46] place, it's so misunderstood." That's
[47:48] the reason you hear me say on the tapes,
[47:50] "Say what the tapes say. Say what the
[47:52] visions say." So, what's the main reason
[47:54] brother Ram said, "Say what the tapes
[47:56] say." People were listening to the
[47:58] visions. When when brother Ram would see
[47:59] visions and tell them secrets about
[48:01] their life, brother Ram said just say
[48:02] what the tapes say about the visions in
[48:05] the prayer lines, the discernment.
[48:08] That's the main reason he said say what
[48:10] the tapes say. He wasn't saying say
[48:12] every word I said during the sermon.
[48:14] That's not what he's not he's saying.
[48:15] He's not saying be a parrot and parrot
[48:17] back everything I say. That's not what
[48:19] he's saying. The purpose was the
[48:22] discernments. People would want to know,
[48:23] well, what did God tell you? What did
[48:24] God show in the vision? Am I going to be
[48:26] healed? Am I going to be uh am I going
[48:28] to go to heaven? What's going to happen?
[48:30] Brother Ram said, "Say what the tapes
[48:32] say?"
[48:34] Now, here's one I just preached to you
[48:36] uh last month. Brother Ram says, "And
[48:38] you that's taken the tapes, then you
[48:40] just stay right with that tape teaching,
[48:42] don't say nothing but what the tape
[48:44] says. Just say exactly what the tape
[48:46] says." He said, "Because you're going to
[48:48] understand a whole lot now why it's
[48:50] misunderstood."
[48:52] Now, here it is. So many times, what,
[48:54] church? Read that word. So many times
[48:55] what? Confusion. People raise up and
[48:58] say, "Well, so and so meant so- and so."
[49:00] Just leave it the way it is. So, Brother
[49:02] Brandham was experiencing people
[49:03] listening to his tapes and changing what
[49:06] he said.
[49:08] And I'm going to show you the next
[49:09] quotes here. Brother Brandham said they
[49:10] were actually splicing tapes. So, they
[49:13] were cutting out parts of tapes just
[49:14] like they do today, right, with
[49:15] politicians and everybody or even
[49:17] preachers. They'll cut off something you
[49:18] say and put it back together. They'll
[49:20] cut this piece out. Put it together and
[49:22] make you say something you didn't say.
[49:24] So brother Ram was saying just say what
[49:26] the tapes say
[49:29] because you'll avoid confusion if you
[49:31] just say what the tapes say.
[49:34] So brother Ram said this because the
[49:36] Bible says never add to it. Remember a
[49:39] genuine faith will never add what?
[49:41] Nothing to the word of God. It'll never
[49:44] take away. So that's why brother Ram
[49:46] saying if there's teaching if there's
[49:48] Bible teaching on the tape don't just
[49:50] say what the tape says. just say what
[49:52] the Bible says about that Bible
[49:53] teaching. He's not saying parrot every
[49:56] word I say because you got to be he said
[49:57] you got to be careful what you're
[49:59] listening to whether it's of God or
[50:00] whether it's just my human opinion.
[50:03] Don't forget the other quotes. But see
[50:05] they'll just say they'll just focus on
[50:06] those quotes. Say what the tape say. Say
[50:07] what the tape say. Say what the tape
[50:08] say. But they forget the other quotes
[50:11] where it says you got to be careful what
[50:13] you're listening to. My opinion is just
[50:15] like anybody else's opinion. See they
[50:17] focus like a repeat like a record over
[50:19] and over. They go like like Israel. So
[50:21] they go around 40 years. They never move
[50:23] past that. The Bible said grow in grace
[50:25] and of the knowledge of the Lord. They
[50:28] don't grow out of that tape worship.
[50:30] Tape worship. They just go around in
[50:31] circles. Around and around tape circle
[50:33] tape. Just say what it says. Just say
[50:34] what it says. Just say what it says.
[50:35] They don't go back to the word of God.
[50:37] We've got to be careful not to do that
[50:38] either.
[50:40] Right? We've got to learn something. How
[50:41] many want to learn something from God?
[50:43] You got to learn. You got to grow. You
[50:45] got to become a new creature in Christ
[50:47] Jesus. Don't let your walk become
[50:48] stagnant. DRAW NIGH TO GOD AND GOD WILL
[50:51] DRAW NIGH TO YOU.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Don't let it happen to you. Don't be
[50:56] Don't let this become a denomination.
[50:58] Any church, brother Rod, can become a
[51:00] denomination. Any church, as soon as you
[51:02] cut off the word of God and you stop
[51:03] trying to grow, you become a
[51:04] denomination.
[51:08] Now, here's the church. The reason he
[51:10] said this, he said, "Here the other day
[51:11] in Arizona, people are splicing the
[51:13] tapes to try to make me say things that
[51:15] I didn't say." Now, God showed him a
[51:17] vision, though. Just let it alone,
[51:19] brother. God told brother, "Don't try to
[51:20] fight it." Because God told him,
[51:22] Revelation 22, "If you add or take away,
[51:25] that will be done to you. The plagues
[51:27] will be added or your name will be taken
[51:28] out of the book." And brother, God told
[51:31] Brother, "As long as I'm fighting it,
[51:32] then I can't fight for you." So in that
[51:35] particular case, God told Brother,
[51:36] "Don't fight against these people.
[51:38] They're taking your tapes and making you
[51:39] say something you didn't say." Brother
[51:41] said, God told him, "I'll fight that
[51:43] battle."
[51:45] And here's in the same sermon he says,
[51:47] "Now you dares try to add or take away
[51:49] from it. For if you try to put your own
[51:50] interpretation yourself, your part is
[51:52] taken from the book of life. Are you
[51:54] trying to say something that the spirit
[51:55] hasn't said?" Now church, how do we know
[51:57] what the spirit said? It's in the word
[51:58] of God.
[52:01] Are you trying to make it sound like it
[52:02] said something or you just take it
[52:04] exactly what it said and leaving it like
[52:06] that? Are you splicing, cutting, taping,
[52:08] doing those things that's not right?
[52:10] Have you? Now only Rod and I would know
[52:11] what that is. Beatatric would know, too.
[52:13] We used to have cassette tapes and they
[52:15] would rip. Well, you had to get out a
[52:16] piece of t tape and tape them back
[52:18] together and wind them back up. Most you
[52:21] don't even understand that. It's like
[52:23] some foreign language to you. I had to
[52:25] take my cassette tapes and screw them
[52:27] back around. And that the tape would all
[52:29] come out. I got to screw them back
[52:30] together until all the tape comes back
[52:32] in. Brother said, "That's what they're
[52:34] doing. They're they're playing my tapes,
[52:36] cutting out where he told some things,
[52:38] taping it back together." And brother
[52:40] Ram said, "You'll be guilty of adding to
[52:42] the word of God." Now, in his case, he's
[52:43] talking about water baptism, the
[52:45] Godhead, all these simple, humble
[52:47] doctrines that we believe. But these
[52:49] people didn't like it. So, they're
[52:50] cutting the tapes and they're cutting
[52:52] out the right baptism. They're cutting
[52:54] out that God's one person. They're
[52:55] cutting out that men should be holy.
[52:57] Yeah. He talks about it next. He he cut
[53:00] they cut it out that women should not
[53:02] cut their hair. So, brother said,
[53:04] "You'll be guilty of that on the day of
[53:06] judgment. You cut out the part of the
[53:08] sermon where he talked about women
[53:09] should have long hair, men should have
[53:10] short hair.
[53:13] Think about that, church. They're
[53:14] basically going like this. They're
[53:15] basically cutting out chapters of the
[53:17] Bible and just throwing them in the
[53:18] trash, burning them,
[53:20] right? They're cut they're cutting out 1
[53:22] Corinthians 11 about hair lengths or
[53:24] Deuteronomy 22 about women and men
[53:26] having different garments. It's as if
[53:28] they're just cutting out parts of the
[53:29] Bible and throwing it away like it means
[53:31] nothing. And so on the day of judgment,
[53:33] if they don't repent, they'll answer for
[53:35] that.
[53:38] Are you splicing, cutting, tape, and
[53:40] doing things that's not right? to have
[53:41] you say, "Well, I just don't feel like I
[53:43] should do this, or maybe I know my
[53:45] church don't believe it." That's just
[53:46] one man's word about it. That one man is
[53:48] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Who's that one
[53:52] man that said men shouldn't dress like
[53:54] women? God said that.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible here says you should not cut
[53:59] your hair. The Bible said it will come
[54:00] to pass that women will wear garments
[54:02] like men and how they would be an
[54:04] abomination to God. So, this is the
[54:06] context, church. I hope everybody can
[54:08] catch this tonight. This is the context
[54:10] where he's saying just say what the
[54:12] tapes say.
[54:14] He's not saying parrot every word. Just
[54:16] sit down and and close your mouth and
[54:18] stop preaching. Bury your talent in the
[54:20] ground. That's not what he's saying like
[54:21] they're saying today.
[54:24] He's saying don't cut out the truths of
[54:26] what I preach. Preach the full Bible
[54:28] like I did. Does everybody understand
[54:30] that?
[54:33] And like I put on my video last week, if
[54:34] people aren't listening to brother
[54:35] Brandham, I really doubt you're born
[54:37] again. You don't want to hear the
[54:39] prophet messenger of your age. How could
[54:41] you be born again and not want to listen
[54:43] to God's prophet? A prophet who who uh
[54:47] walked here not long ago. We're coming
[54:49] up on 60 years uh next month. We're
[54:50] already we're almost there. My 60 years
[54:52] since he's been off the scene. You don't
[54:54] want to hear a prophet of God preach
[54:55] with thus sayith the Lord. You don't
[54:57] want to hear any of those 42 thus sayith
[54:58] the Lords.
[55:01] We we would give anything to go back and
[55:03] listen to Jesus talk, right? We give
[55:05] anything to go watch Moses give a thus
[55:07] sayith the Lord or Elijah. We give
[55:09] anything to see the fire fall on Mount
[55:11] Carmel, but yet we won't even put on a
[55:13] tape of God's prophet and hear him say
[55:14] thus sayith the Lord. I think we're
[55:17] showing favoritism or I think the word
[55:19] of God has become common to us.
[55:22] We must be careful church. I'm almost
[55:24] done now. Brother Ram says this. How
[55:25] much? It's almost 8 o'clock.
[55:29] I'm almost done.
[55:31] Brother Ram says this quote. Brother
[55:33] Ram's reading Deuteronomy 4 like we did.
[55:35] He's quoting Moses and he says, ' Don't
[55:38] add, don't diminish and he says, Moses
[55:41] said, "I call heavens and earth to
[55:43] witness against you this day." He says,
[55:45] "You'll utterly perish off the land."
[55:46] I'm going fast through this if you uh
[55:50] add or take away from my commands.
[55:53] So Moses is clearly calling a heavenly
[55:55] witness against Israel for breaking the
[55:58] commands of God, not the human opinions
[56:00] of Moses.
[56:03] Everybody got that? Moses said, "If you
[56:06] break the commands of God," he said in
[56:08] verse two, "The commandments of the Lord
[56:11] your God, then I call all heavens and
[56:14] earth to witness against you."
[56:17] So what does brother say? This was Moses
[56:19] speaking to Israel after he had been
[56:20] vindicated by God by a pillar of fire.
[56:22] And brother Brandham was vindicated by a
[56:23] pillar of fire. And note, he was proven
[56:26] to be God's servant to lead them out.
[56:27] And before they went to the land, before
[56:29] they entered, Moses said, "Now these
[56:30] words that I spoken to you, I call
[56:32] heaven and earth to witness against you.
[56:34] If you add one thing or take one word
[56:36] from it, you'll not stay in the land
[56:37] where the Lord your God gives you." Now
[56:38] look what he says. So I say in the name
[56:40] of Jesus Christ.
[56:43] Don't you add one thing. Don't take
[56:45] don't put your own ideas in it. You just
[56:47] say what's on those tapes. You just do
[56:49] exactly what the Lord or God has
[56:51] commanded to you. Don't add to it. And
[56:54] the church said, "I believe this with
[56:56] all my heart, but I also believe the
[56:58] other statements he made too that he
[57:00] says there's mixups on the tapes."
[57:02] Right? Abraham said, "I don't know all
[57:04] the answers." He said, "I make those
[57:06] mistakes all the time where he he said
[57:08] uh 700 bowed their knee to bail instead
[57:10] of 7,000 in the days of Elijah." He
[57:13] said, "I make them mistakes all the
[57:14] time." He said, "You forgive me for
[57:16] that." So, brother is not saying you got
[57:18] to focus on every single word. It's the
[57:21] revelations that are on the tapes. It's
[57:24] the Bible truths that are on the tapes.
[57:29] But this is the one the tape boys use.
[57:31] Even preachers use this and they say, "I
[57:33] stand behind every word from 1947 to
[57:36] 65." That means you stand behind man's
[57:39] opinions that aren't vindicated by the
[57:40] word of God. There's some man's opinions
[57:43] behind there. You're standing behind
[57:44] something that's not fully the word of
[57:46] God. We only want to stand behind all
[57:48] the word of God. We're not going to
[57:50] worship tapes in this church.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Now, this is for the younger ones, okay?
[57:54] So that they get it. Now, the older
[57:55] ones, you ought to say, "Praise God. God
[57:57] bless my pastor for preaching that." I
[57:59] knew it, but I needed a fresh reminder.
[58:02] And you young ones, I'll say, "Praise
[58:03] God. I never heard Brother so
[58:05] enthusiastically support the word of God
[58:08] and say, "DON'T SAY JUST SAY WHAT THE
[58:10] BIBLE SAYS."
[58:12] SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEXT, brother
[58:13] Ram saying just like Moses, all the
[58:16] commands of God that I preach to you say
[58:19] what they say, not my own human
[58:22] opinions.
[58:26] And again, he says, I'm going to skip
[58:27] down, just don't add to it. Don't take
[58:29] from it. You just believe it and walk
[58:31] humble before the Lord your God. We're
[58:33] nearing the going into the land.
[58:35] Hallelujah.
[58:39] Okay. Uh closing. And the Lord your God
[58:42] of the fathers uh this is the time of
[58:44] Zedekiah. He was the last king uh before
[58:47] the exile or the captivity of Israel out
[58:49] of the promised land. The Lord God of
[58:52] your fathers sent to them by his
[58:53] messengers rising up be times and
[58:55] sending because he had compassion on his
[58:57] people. Now I'm updating this to the
[58:59] days of the Gentiles. This was written
[59:01] to the Jews, but I'm updating this. If
[59:04] God is unchanging, God would have
[59:06] compassion on us, the Gentiles. And he
[59:08] would send us a prophet
[59:10] because God is the same yesterday,
[59:12] today, and forever.
[59:14] And where's his dwelling place today? Is
[59:16] it is it Akan, Ohio? Not necessarily.
[59:18] It's in the body of Jesus Christ.
[59:20] Hallelujah. Church, your life is not
[59:22] hidden in Akran, Ohio. Your life is not
[59:24] hidden in Bright of Christ Fellowship.
[59:26] Your life is hidden in Christ.
[59:30] That's where your seed in heavenly
[59:31] places. Your seed in heavenly places in
[59:34] Christ Jesus, not in bride of Christ
[59:36] fellowship.
[59:39] But what they do when the preachers came
[59:40] around, the p the prophets, they mocked
[59:43] him. They mocked brother Brandon. They
[59:45] despised his words. Oh, we don't need
[59:47] that's old fuddy duddy stuff. We don't
[59:48] need that old fashioned nonsense. They
[59:51] misuse his prophets like they do today.
[59:54] They focus on everything outside the
[59:55] Bible that brother Ram actually preached
[59:57] all the details of his life. They focus
[59:59] on those things. They misuse his words
[1:00:01] rather than putting him uh but rather
[1:00:03] than taking what he said back to the
[1:00:04] Bible until the wrath wrath of the Lord
[1:00:07] rose against his people to there was no
[1:00:09] remedy.
[1:00:11] Okay, we'll stop right there. Now
[1:00:13] Malachi is going to take off.
[1:00:16] Sure. Okay. Well, I told him he could
[1:00:18] take off because he's got to get up at
[1:00:19] 3:30. But musicians can come if you want
[1:00:21] to stay. Okay, buddy. That's up to you.
[1:00:22] I'll try to close faster here. Let's
[1:00:23] stand to our feet by God's grace.
[1:00:29] Just play that again. Ancient words.
[1:00:30] Let's play that again. By God's grace.
[1:00:32] Hallelujah. Now, church, was this
[1:00:34] helpful tonight? By the grace of the
[1:00:36] Lord. I especially want our young
[1:00:38] believers and our children and our
[1:00:40] teenagers to see Brother Brandham
[1:00:42] constantly emphasized, "Do not add to
[1:00:45] the word of God. Do not take it away."
[1:00:48] He said, "Just say what it says."
[1:00:51] Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] Hallelujah.
[1:00:58] Now, I've been called all kinds of
[1:00:59] things. I've been rejected. I've been
[1:01:00] called a notthead. I've been called a a
[1:01:02] devil. I've been called a Judas a scar
[1:01:04] just for saying these other quotes. Just
[1:01:06] because I use the other side of the
[1:01:07] quotes from Brother Brandham. But you
[1:01:10] know what? I don't even care what these
[1:01:11] people say. All I care is what one man
[1:01:14] says, and that's God Almighty.
[1:01:18] Like brother Ram said, I would rather
[1:01:21] drink branch water and eat soda crackers
[1:01:24] than have chicken every night. Now, I do
[1:01:27] have chicken a lot, but if I had a
[1:01:29] choice between uh little money, little
[1:01:32] and and no popularity and popularity and
[1:01:35] staying true to the word of God, I'll
[1:01:36] take the way with the Lord's despised
[1:01:38] few.
[1:01:40] I don't care if I lose all my friends
[1:01:42] and preachers. I don't care. I care
[1:01:44] about one preacher that I I don't lose
[1:01:46] favor with. That's Jesus. because he
[1:01:48] went down and preached to the spirits
[1:01:49] that were in prison. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:52] That's the one preacher I got to have a
[1:01:54] good friendship with by God's grace.
[1:02:00] And the Bible said any man that lives in
[1:02:03] holiness, the Bible said he'll suffer
[1:02:05] persecution. And right now the only
[1:02:06] persecution is name calling and
[1:02:08] separating and things like that. At
[1:02:10] least in America. But the mark's coming.
[1:02:12] We don't know when. But you've heard the
[1:02:14] warning. Do not unite right with any
[1:02:18] church, any organization.
[1:02:20] Do not unite with any organization that
[1:02:22] says you can't buy or sell unless you
[1:02:24] unite with that. You unite with Jesus
[1:02:26] Christ.
[1:02:28] We don't know the day or the hour. But
[1:02:31] we've been warned.
[1:02:33] God sent us a uh God sent us a watchman
[1:02:35] on the tower. Thank God. God sent
[1:02:36] brother Brandon as a watchman on the
[1:02:38] tower with thus sayith the Lord.
[1:02:42] And he didn't say uh like Paul Rivere,
[1:02:44] he didn't say the British are coming. He
[1:02:45] didn't say Rome is coming. He said Rome
[1:02:47] is here.
[1:02:49] Look at Rome in the government. Look at
[1:02:50] all the Catholics in the government.
[1:02:52] Rome is here, church. It ain't coming.
[1:02:53] It's here.
[1:02:57] How many want to be like brother
[1:02:58] Brandham and said, "I hang my soul on
[1:03:00] any phrase in the Holy Bible." How many
[1:03:02] want to be like that? We're going to
[1:03:03] have to perhaps at some point, now I
[1:03:05] said perhaps if it comes in our
[1:03:07] generation, [music] somebody's going to
[1:03:08] have to hang their soul on this word of
[1:03:09] God. We see it happen in Nigeria, North
[1:03:12] Korea, China. We see it happening there.
[1:03:14] If it comes here, we got to be willing
[1:03:16] to hang our soul. I believe the word of
[1:03:18] God is thus sayith the Lord. I'm not
[1:03:20] going to take one word away from it. I'm
[1:03:22] not going to add one word to it. Let's
[1:03:24] pray.
[1:03:27] Lord Jesus, we thank you for tonight.
[1:03:29] Lord, I've just felt this holy boldness.
[1:03:31] Lord, that's what happened when they got
[1:03:32] the Holy Ghost. They were speaking the
[1:03:34] word of God with boldness. This boldness
[1:03:35] just come on me.
[1:03:37] Lord, I feel so sad for these tape
[1:03:39] worshippers, Lord God. How could they do
[1:03:41] this? [music] Lord, what what kind of
[1:03:43] evil spirit do they have? Lord God, how
[1:03:45] can they read these and listen to these
[1:03:47] sermons and not hear the truth, Lord?
[1:03:49] They're just blind. And you said the let
[1:03:51] the blind lead the blind. But Lord, even
[1:03:53] as a minor watchman, I'm not the major
[1:03:55] watchman. I'm just a minor watchman.
[1:03:58] I stand from the tower saying do not
[1:04:00] worship the tapes. Take every word back
[1:04:02] to the Bible. Prove all things. Don't
[1:04:04] add one word to the Bible. Don't take
[1:04:06] one word away from the Bible. Just say
[1:04:08] what the Bible says.
[1:04:11] Lord, we tried to preach your word
[1:04:13] tonight, Lord. And I especially want
[1:04:14] this next generation to know how much
[1:04:16] your prophet loved the Bible. [music]
[1:04:18] And we can't do anything until we come
[1:04:20] back to the Bible. Nobody can be helped.
[1:04:21] Nobody can be healed. Nobody can be
[1:04:23] saved. Nobody can be filled with the
[1:04:24] Holy Ghost or made ready for the rapture
[1:04:26] without obeying the word of God. So help
[1:04:29] us, Lord God, to obey every word of God.
[1:04:31] Lord, help this not to become common. If
[1:04:33] the people haven't read their Bible,
[1:04:35] prayed, or Lord, listen to Brother
[1:04:36] Brandham or other Holy Ghost fililled
[1:04:38] preachers, I pray they repent and do
[1:04:40] that. Make it right tonight. Pray until
[1:04:42] their hearts are changed, Lord [music]
[1:04:43] God.
[1:04:46] And as brother Brandham said, Lord, my
[1:04:48] for me, let me be innocent on that day
[1:04:50] of ever adding to the word or taking
[1:04:52] away from it. Lord God, I know that's
[1:04:54] what they want too, Lord Jesus. Unite
[1:04:56] our hearts to fear your name. Unite our
[1:04:59] hearts with thus sayaith the Lord. It's
[1:05:02] uniting time for the bride and the word
[1:05:04] of God. [music] We give you praise. We
[1:05:06] give you glory tonight. Bless us your in
[1:05:08] your divine presence. I ask it [music]
[1:05:10] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saint
[1:05:13] said,
