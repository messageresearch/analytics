the mind of Christ here tonight dear God I surely need you and bless your people they need a word from you they need anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord God so let your Holy Spirit anoint us we report for our our post of Duty Lord as Kings and Priests unto God and bless us now in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen praise God God bless you let's take your Bibles here tonight let's go to scripture here I'm sorry I kind of forgot my text here again I'm a little little tired here tonight Psalm 71 I think I read this last Wednesday but I want to read it again start a different series I was telling you about I'd like to look at some personal testimonies from people that knew brother brandom and tied in with some scriptures of course and you know our experience how it kind of relates to our life as well here as we're about the third generation since brother brandom as far as uh children and grandchildren and so forth here so Psalm 71 Verse 18 Psalm 7118 thank you H appreciation all right let's read that together ready one two three now also when I am old and [Music] grayheadedgamer tonight God bless you I like to I have some slides here we show here and then I got I'm going to just play a few audio clips from bandom here at the End by God's grace make sure I got those ready to go okay so I've just had this thought you know for many months you know I've been um over the last maybe a year or so I've been reading slowly through this book one testimony at a time it's called a generation God bless you brother how you doing sir good good to see you brother trip to Alabama brother amen hallelujah wonderful hallelujah praise God so brother Jose bought me this book uh you know a couple years ago generation it's written by Brother brandom's granddaughter um so it would be Rebecca brandom's daughter or granddaughter if I'm not mistake it and so it was a it was a Rel at least around 2004 um I'm sorry 2000 sorry I'm keep forgetting here let me just look it up oh 2006 okay so they were trying to do 40 years after brother brandom passed so they wanted it done by 2005 which would have been 40 years okay but then they come out the next year on the 41st year um but it's a it's a great little group of testimonies um I would encourage you if you want to copy pick one up or if you can't afford one let me know you know I'll certainly buy one for you if you're going to read it by God's grace you I bought many books over the years you know for the Saints and um I just want to know that they're going to be read if you want a copy and I I'll certainly get you copy if you're going to read it by God's grace sometimes I just never know uh even myself I you know I bought myself so many books and I haven't read all of them you know I I got good intentions but I got to trust there's a a time and season with God I've got to trust that because like I said I'm almost through this now after all these years you Jose didn't know what he was doing but he was blessing me a whole lot when in this book here no surprise there right he's always blessing the Saints um and so I just want to just tie this in I think I call it a supernatural generation last week I preached on a supernatural book of Acts church I appreciate the good feedback on that by God's grace and we are part of that by God's grace um you know uh brother cam was sending he and I were sending some messages this week and he said I'm just so amazed to see all the supernatural in my life and I thought that was such an encouragement I just want to encourage you too you know just keep looking for the supernatural in your life you know whenever you you see God's hand whenever you see favor whenever you see Mercy it's actually God's Supernatural hand and so we just want to be mindful of that you know uh as I've said before you know we can't we can't pick which talents we got from Jesus right some got five some got two one I'm sure there's four and three in there as well but in the parable it was five two and one and so we can't choose the Bible said the the holy spirit gives the gifts severly as he would give them unto us and so we once we recognize that we have a gift we want to find it as our brother preached The Mystery of Life that was a wonderful title and uh that's the mystery brother BR said that's the mystery of God's will find what God placed you here to do and then do it by God's grace right just be as dedicated just be as diligent as you can brother Braham said do all you can do for Jesus he said and Jesus will make up for the rest I've always loved that that quote has always come to my heart and mind I'll do everything I can on my own power and of course yielding to the Holy Spirit my own human human effort you know diligence and then the holy spirit will make make up for the rest that I can't do or anything that I you know would need God's uh you know extra leadership on or extra Grace now of course I can do nothing on myself but what I mean is my yielding to God anything that I won't yield to God anything that I struggle with I know God will make up for it all right so I think you understand what I'm saying I'm not I'm not preaching Works religion I I have no power of my own but if there's anything I struggle to do God will help me God will work God will work beside my failures amen right just like Abraham and Sarah just think of remember all those SPS remember all those red dots I put on the timeline God worked despite all those red dots God works despite all of our failures right God works because God is in control God is the author he's the author and finisher of our faith Hallelujah he's faithful to finish the good work that he started in your life as I prayed for my wife last night you know remember God has good plans for us he has a hope for us he has a future for us praise God hallelujah he has an expected end in other words we can expect the ending it's going to be a good ending this movie is going to end good Hallelujah the story of life this book is going to end good by God's grace it's so true so I want to preach on that I want to preach on a supernatural generation and I kind of got that from here you know uh this this granddaughter brother randam looked at you know a generation had P passed since brother Bram died and she wanted to share and preserve some of these testimonies I'm glad she did some of them are really wonderful and you know I just I didn't know which way to start I thought well maybe I'll start with his family members or maybe I'll start with the oldest ones and I thought well I'm going to go with the testimonies that touch my heart the most so may it may be a strange testimony I'm going to end with tonight but I think you'll see why by God's grace just a couple things tie in that I really like here so we read our text you know the this whole chapter is powerful I was reading through the chapter today I'm like my I could preach this whole chapter just because it's such an encouragement to the people but you know the 17 says oh God thou has taught me from my youth how many you know God's been after you since you were a child he's taught you lesson since you were young and hitherto have I declared thy wonderful works so since I was a child I've declared God's works I've told my mom's healing of cancer since I was a child right just more so in these last years whenever God's done for you you know you've tried to I'm sure over the years you've tried to pass on and share with others what God has done for you this is what the psalm writer says Lord you've taught me and I've tried to pass it on now also when I'm old and gray-headed now don't go count my gray hairs okay don't try to focus just over here not not over here I know the scripture says that when I'm old and gray-headed oh God I love this forsake me not words I see you when I'm young I see you in my midlife please as I'm getting older Please Don't Leave Me Now church and if as you get older that's when you see how really how much you need God right you're weaker you're more susceptible to failures or weakness or tripping or breaking bones or you know the bones get brittle as you get older but you just see you see your weakness right brother Bram said you're fading out like the sun going down right so I guess you know what's a I think brother Bram said uh 21 was when the the noon time when the sun was highest in the sky so some of you getting pretty close right some of us getting pretty close to the height of the sun right I done past that a while ago my son's getting a little lower but we're I'm thankful that Christ is shining on my life praise God I'm thankful I've been able to live this day for Christ he said ' forsake me not until in other words don't let me die until I've showed your strength now this show is a different show than maybe what I thought until I've showed your strength unto this generation and thy power to everyone that is to come Hallelujah and you know look how God answered this prayer now every generation has got to read this this prayer think about that think about what a Prayer church I I feel like if you really pray you want God to move through your life so that other people will be blessed I believe God will do that that amen praise God like like this week we finally finished reading through my book my big thick book we finally finished that last night I think it was yeah last night we finish it and I just told the children I said if I go beyond the the veil I go beyond the curtain of time I said this is here this is the left for you and my wife's like I hope you don't go on Beyond the Veil very soon right I'm like I hope not either I hope we go in the Rapture by God's grace but but that's what I love about the book that it something I can leave behind if the Lord terries Lord CH and I turn 10020 right now I can't I don't make it 121 but I I want my generation I want the people that lived around me to know God's word and to know that I love God and I lived a life that was worthy of the Gospel praise God like right now I'm trying to Mentor this young teacher I'm trying to get him to do what I do teach Bible Club so I'm trying to start that because I can see you know I've done it for you know maybe 10 years and I want to you know want I want some help I like some help and so I'm trying to Mentor him and trying to meet up with him I just sent him some messages today let's meet up and talk about that you're young man my you're 23 you're right in the prime you know the sun's still really pretty much straight up in the air you know and I want to show show him you know my I've been trying to be faithful in my generation and you need to be faithful in your generation really I got 15 more years Till I Retire so I'm doing pretty good by God's grace but I'm I'm I'm on the other end of it you know uh done past that Midway mark and he says uh and thy power to everyone that is to come thy righteousness also oh God is very high who has done who has done great things oh God who's like unto thee who do we know like Jesus who can we sing to like Jesus amen nobody praise God because there's nobody like Jesus amen we looked all around never found anybody like Jesus turned all around children I never found anybody like Jesus right Hallelujah now this word show show means that look I thought it was you know like maybe just show Miracles or something but in this case now we know the power speaks of Miracles but in this case he says Lord let me show let me declare or announce or tell or expound on your glory to my generation let me just publish it praise God let me just share it with somebody what you've done in my life praise God for my generation let me tell somebody let me announce it let me report to people that God is the same yesterday today and forever and then Lord show your power in my life hallelujah oh it's a great prayer how many like that prayer Lord when I'm old and gray-headed you know don't forget me then and I want to show everybody in my generation I want to tell everybody your glory I want to tell everybody about the power of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's a beautiful beautiful uh uh scripture there now brother Ram tells us here you know as I said you know uh my uh leadership on how I preach and pastored for 17 years and preached for 19 years has been always to put the Bible at the Forefront and show how brother Ram taught the Bible but I've never been guilty of putting brother random in front know above the Bible never been guilty of that by God's grace like I've never said every word brother randam said was thus say the Lord I've never said that I've never given uh given more credit to brother Ram than Jesus I won't be guilty of that and brother because this is what brother Ram told us to do now the the other side you know thece side they can take a few quotes and twist it but that's not really what brother ramam said when brother Bram said you know he said you kind of look to me as an absolute he wasn't saying I'm equal to the Bible he was saying you got to have he said follow me as I follow Christ he's saying I'm a human preacher and every human has to follow some type of Pastor right some Pastor or Prophet or whoever whatever person the five-fold ministry you're under hopefully a pastor I believe everybody should have a pastor uh I believe God would provide that to every man that's just my humble opinion I believe that but that's what brother B told us he said watch the message in order to avoid idolatry so that means we got to watch the Bible read brother bram's uh sermons listen brother Bram read the church age book you know but then take everything back to the Bible and that will keep you out of idolatry he says it in absolute January 20 uh January 27th right before Victoria's birthday people talk about Devils don't even know what they are sometime but you run headlong into them every day maybe but you will how many how many notice every day you run into them right brother BR said you know once you get a victory over them then they come real Sly they come with real something real Sly like you would you would you would notice right away oh that's a that's a you know that's a bottle of Jack Daniels I'm I'm trying to think of you know or a prostitute you know right away that's a devil but Satan's got to come in little small ways Little White Lies right so every day we're going to run into and think about that behind that white liar that little small thing is a nasty Wicked devil wanting to destroy your life destroy your walk with God that's why you know uh if there's even a question it's wise many times don't do it if there's a question to it right it's better to air on the side of obedience and a peace of mind it's better to air on a peace of mind than question mind right or a confused mind the Bible said anything that's not done in faith is what it's sin after a while Satan was accusing me think about that he says you have now look Satan says you have no power with God you're a you're just a bluff you have no power I said Satan you're an offense to me get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ now that's a quote we can use tomorrow amen get out of my way Satan Hallelujah he's accusing me now Church isn't some of that true do we have any power no we don't have any power but what do we got Authority praise God hallelujah just like that police officer brother you put a a dwindle little 100 pound man out there you know if he's just standing on the road and all the cars drive by he won't be able to stop him but he said put an officer police officer suit on him give him a whistle give him a badge he'll blow the whistle and cars going 80 miles per hour will slam on their brakes not because of power but because of authority amen and that's what we are we're weak people but when we got the authority when we got the B of the blood of Jesus Christ all hell has to stop Hallelujah can say like that all demons have to slam on their brakes Hallelujah in other words Satan you can only go this far is that right Hallelujah you can barrel down the road of my life or try to scare me something like that but you've got to stop right here in the name of Jesus right that's what brother BR says and Satan says you're a bluff brother Brandon right we all make mistakes right but see when he comes down to it he said Satan get behind me that's what Jesus said Satan you're an offense unto me get thee behind me Satan now brother man's talking about this Mamba Vision I'm not going to get into that it's a it's a powerful story you haven't heard of that Vision he said I laid there a little bit in the bed started up to rise up I felt a sweet real sweet feeling come over me I thought wonder if the Holy Spirit I was close how many like that feeling amen you just feel something change or you get those Goosebumps or or use for me many times just I start crying oh now I feel the presence of God not always but many times he said now over the corner he said so help me here's my Bible over my heart the sweetest voice I ever heard in my life said Don't Fear to go anywhere and don't fear to do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go think of all the prayer lines think of all the missionary trips and even this think about when he got in the car accident at the end amen God never forsakes us he never leaves us nor forsakes us hallelujah don't fear another the M the main point is don't fear trust God that settled it with me May it settle with us too he said let them rage I got an absolute my anchor holds out yonder because it's the word of the Living God what's Brothers absolute the word of the Living God he said let's bow our heads a moment if you haven't got that absolute now get it if you like to have that absolute that Assurance in Your Heart by the holy spirit so where's the absolute in this case but said the absolute's in your heart the Holy Ghost raise your hand and say I want something that'll punctuate the word of God and I can see the word of God made manifest amen God bless you it's all over the building thank you I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass you by I'm nothing now look at this I'm nothing I'm your brother don't pay any attention to a messenger you watch the messenger now look what about that quote be people that all they do is worship brother BR all they do is preach brother brandom what about that what are you going to do about that see in other words he's saying don't worship me don't pay attention to my human attributes pay attention to the word of God that I'm preaching Hallelujah you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you and that's my question that's why it's possible God took brother random at the age of 56 such a young age that's personally why I think God took brother Braham I don't know but we have a quote that says it brother man says if you put too much attention on the messenger God will take him away now just one thought I'm not saying but it's only one that makes sense to me especially seeing all the idolatry that's happening now in the family and in the brandom Tabernacle he will share his glory with nobody that's right don't watch the messenger watch the message if a man running here he might be black yellow brown ragged if he's got a check for you for a bank draft for a million dollars you wouldn't care what color he was or how he was dressed it's the message he has for you so brother Braham is making himself the Ragged man but he's got a million-dollar message right here how many want a million dollar message amen one time brother dig said you going to be a millionaire I thought well now now I know what it means right here I have the unsearchable riches of Christ it ain't money it's the word hallelujah amen there it is I got a quote for it too I'll sh have to share that with brother digs I said brother digs you were right I am a millionaire by the spirit of God now don't look at my grammar and the things just remember I'm telling you about Jesus Christ who's here now you believe him with all your heart don't you fail to believe him so keep that in mind as we go on now we have to be a witness to our generation uh the Bible said uh with St Paul he he said he came unto me he's telling his testimony and stood and said to me brother Saul receive thy sight speaking of ananas and the same hour I looked up upon him and he said the god of our fathers has chosen thee that thou shouldest know know his will now think about that church of all the churches out there you know Christ and you know the will of Christ you know the will about your hair about your clothes about your makeup and there's no makeup about jewelry right the water baptism the godhead Hallelujah the five b Ministry you know all this why because God called you to know it amen God wanted to show it to you praise God he didn't have to show it to you but he showed it to you praise God why cuz he chose you he chose you that's what God told Paul through ananas and uh Paul was the first church age messenger God chose you that you should know his will and see the just one and should hear the voice of his mouth we're a blessed people to hear the voice of Christ in this hour we can listen to his servant brother brandham we can listen to the fivefold ministry if anybody prophesies here tonight and it's thus say the Lord that'll be the voice of Christ in the bride of Christ for th Thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou Hast seen and heard so that's what Christ wants from all of us he wants us to be a witness of all the things we've seen and all the things we've heard I was telling brother Diggs about sister Naomi's testimony when she spoke in tongues and how that was a answer to prayer years back and he said wow he liked that testimony that meant a lot to him and he shared because he was sharing some other testimonies and I just thought that and I loved how brother Brooks sorry brother Brooks brother Diggs was sharing all those testimonies at the end to show you how Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever all we can do is tell what we've seen and heard remember we were at the Baptist Church a few weeks ago what did they all clap on they all clapped on how I got saved and I got the Holy Ghost it was the testimony in other words we we we love the word but we love to hear how the word Moves In Our Lives amen I love to hear in somebody else's life I love how God proves himself to every generation hallelujah amen and that's all we can do all we can do is witness to what we've seen or heard God's not asking you to witness to what you haven't seen or heard God just wants you to be a witness for what you've seen brother says it plainly he said when you become a Christian he said if you don't know what to say just tell them how your fire got lit anybody got a fire in here hallelujah well sometime it got lit Hallelujah so tell people how it got lit amen you got nothing else to tell them tell them how the fire started on the inside oh thank God thank God there's a fire burning in our souls amen and it's not cold right it's not cold and stiff and starchy and empty in our souls but our soul is filled with the warm fire of God's love oh my the fire of his Spirit praise God he said why do you tear now why do you wait now rise Paul be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord remember this picture I kind of updated this is how the message came to us brother random when when he passed away brother Neville became the pastor brother Neville before he died he went to the the Saints house Tom and Linda Brown in in Lima and preached the message there they started a church uh brother Brooks became the pastor there right and then brother Brooks ordained me and here we are with Zion and bank that has no meaning to it or anything you know just the latest picture I had with brother Brooks and I um so that's how the message came to us but you know generally generationally speaking it's only been three generations right because brother random had Joseph in 1955 that was just 5 years after my dad was born so when I when I when I plac myself I'd be like the age of one of Joseph bram's Children right because he's just five years uh younger than my dad so that kind of gives me a good okay and then now I have an adult I added Lydia because now she's an adult so now we have an adult generation right so brother random uh Joseph you know and then children and then next so I guess it'll be the fourth right that be would that be the fourth did I get that wrong oh I'm I'm sorry it's the third from Brother Brown yes so so I'm not counting brother Bram uh it' be Joseph or my dad and then me and then Lydia that's kind of how it would be so it's been three generations since brother Brandon Hallelujah and we can see and church we can all see that the message is pure after all these Generations the word of God is moving on they cannot stop this word hallelujah they used to have it just where they they only had a couple sermons and books and then they got it all on the computer and now we got it all on our phones you're not going to stop this message praise God hallelujah it's got to go around the world Jesus said this gospel must be preached to every nation and then the end shall come so what we need some more preachers to do missionary work Hallelujah God called me to be a pastor we'll see how long that lasts Hallelujah I'm just I just want to be open to whatever God would have I may be a pastor my whole life we'll see I don't know but I want to be open to the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise praise God and I like this quote in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger brother brandom in a certain area Jeffersonville Indiana and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others brother Neville who have been Faithfully taught right brother Brooks and then down to us but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken Allelujah now of course we have to balance this quote right brother Ram says I don't have all the answers right and there's scriptures that brother BR never preached from so we have to balance this out brother Bram never said uh you must be a PA of me we're not Paris we're Eagles we're not chickens we're Eagles Hallelujah now he he uses the scripture remember Paul warned the people to only say what he said now that's the scripture right 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord what came the word of God out from you only or came it unto you only so in our case we use all the quotes of brother brand when he points back to the word right with the thus sayth the Lords because that's the Commandment of God that's what he's saying he said only say what the word of God has said and if I don't if I had my own thought I'll tell you this is just my thought this is just my opinion and I try to place it by some scripture all right and he says now churches they add here they take away there from the Bible and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God and brother R says any child of God can be the voice of God when they're yielded to the Holy Spirit sorry any child of God I got the quotes I don't have it up here but I could play it for you it's on one of my absolute videos any person who yields to the Holy Spirit can be the voice of God to us because the Bible said the spirit and the who say come the bride let say together the spirit and the bride say come the bride has a voice amen you have a voice when you speak God's word it's God's Voice Hallelujah the spirit and the bride say come you represent God's Voice Hallelujah Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise so again we see it's the word of God it's the Commandments of God from the Bible he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what he had been given by re reation but remember there's another quote in the book where brother says God can give you more information on the same Revelation he said we have to be open to that that means just more scriptures about the same Revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of God by the way of his Messengers and then say what has been given them to say to the churches he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit of God says to the church so what do we hear on Sunday what do we hear from the spirit of God on Sunday watch for your desires young people and parents compliment your children I went home on Sunday night and I told all my girls you're beautiful and your hair is beautiful I told him that last night too I told him Mali you're handsome you're very talented I told Z well I don't know if I told Zion he might have been sleeping like he is now but I went home and I just try to apply that I want them to know Daddy thinks they're beautiful Hallelujah and no Slicker is going to come around here and try to trick my daughters by God's grace protect us great Holy Spirit that's our prayer but the holy spirit said watch your desires crucify your sinful desires and enjoy the desires God has given you we also heard the mystery of life that uh you are the mystery of Christ and that's scriptural right we're the bride of Christ the Bible said you are in the stead or the representation or the place of Jesus Christ how many know that so when people say that you know uh the the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed that's true because it's the mystery is Christ in you the hope it's a mystery how could Christ be in me it's the hope of glory amen that God would share his divinity that God would put his own life in US praise God so there's a truth to that now we can't go too far on it where everything we say is thus say the Lord and all that nonsense we can't go that far but we do have scripture that when we speak the word of God it's God Spirit speaking through US praise God see it's such a balance but people get so easily unbalanced because they don't have teaching but we got to have more than teaching we got to have power too amen hallelujah that's what we desire Hallelujah that's why I'm preaching this to to raise our faith may not seem like it but uh I just felt like I had to teach this to get to the the testimony Parts here thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses so remember the testimonies the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also now I hope by God's Grace I've been able to teach you something whether it was predestination or the godhead or the Seven Seals what something I've taught hopefully I was able to teach you something by God's grace the two resurrections you know the seven Church ages hopefully I was able by God's grace I believe I have but uh that's just my desire just want to be humble he says Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ that's that's strange you Paul says uh be strong but then he says you got to endure hardness so you better be strong because you know trials are coming we're not in a picnic we can't expect Our Lives to be a picnic now we can expect seasons of of rest like I preached we can expect seasons of rest because of obedience but during those seasons of rest strengthen yourself Hallelujah strengthen yourself do your spiritual exercises Hallelujah learn the word of God enjoy the word of God Feast on the word of God that's a time to Feast on God's word the season of rest so preacher has to endure hardness as a soldier of Christ that means I've got to use the sword sometimes right that means I got to use the shield a lot because of all the attacks coming at you right each one of you have to do the same there are seasons where you're attacked in your family might be attacked at the church you might be attacked online might be attacked by Family there's times we're all attacked and all we have to do is raise up our faith amen hallelujah just raise it up praise God and faith will extinguish every fiery Dart praise every single word hallelujah every lie or every attack can be taken away it can be defeated by faith in the word of God hallelujah faith is Assurance by the Assurance of the word of God now i' I've read this before but I'm just going to briefly go over again you know the the accusers clearly uh don't have the the fruits of the Holy Spirit right they they say brother R plagiarize the seals yet i' I've showed 37 differences and they won't even they won't even honestly look at one of them they say God three persons adding to the Bible with no scripture they describe their podcast as juicy because they like gossip and they tell lies about God's servant see what are they do in church they're looking at the messenger instead of the message there it is right there is that right they're focusing on the mess messenger rather than the message that's what I always want to do next time if ever a debate or something I say let's get off that let's go back to the Bible what's the Bible say about women's hair what's the Bible say about water baptism Hallelujah what's the Bible say about women preachers take it back to the Bible that's what they don't want to talk about they say Halloween is fun and and now we're in Halloween season so it's a good reminder for us they watch they say they watch Dracula movies they dress up like Dracula a blood sucking fornicator and murderer they they enjoy that that's what they say they watch filthy Hollywood movies they've named some of the movies I can't remember some of them now I can't remember I listen to their podcast they use cuss words um have filthy scenes murders more and they call and they and they say they're free in Christ they're in bondage to the enemy they frequently misinterpret quotes and uh they tell lies by their presumption about God's servant they say women can cut their hair yet Paul forbids it they say there's one work of Grace and basically say a child a four-year-old child who who says they believe in Jesus already filled with the Holy Ghost without any fruit to it see that that's just a few of them now what the Bible say the Bible said I found this a few weeks ago and I emailed to myself I thought oh I got to preach this he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord is God and humbl not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord what did Brother Ram do he spoke from the mouth of God he told us thus sayith the Lord he told us thus sayi the Holy Spirit thus say the Bible he heard from from God's mouth and he told us and we have to Humble ourselves to accept the word of God but the accusers don't humble themselves aren't you glad you can humble yourself remember brother Ben preached on that that was a two- hour sermon that was a really good sermon Hallelujah then it says and the Lord God of their father sent to them by his Messengers so who's God going to send us a messenger how about a seven Church age messenger would that be okay because the Bible said there's ages and rising up be times and sending because why did God send brother brandom he had compassion on his people hallelujah and on his Dwelling Place Hallelujah Heaven no one has taught me more about Jesus God in heaven than William brandom I'm gonna say that again no one in this world has taught me more about Jesus God or heaven or the Angels anything other than William brandom why did God do that because he had compassion on me praise God he cared for me since the first time I ever heard his voice I was weeping and crying the first time I ever heard brother ad's voice just I never heard a man like that that knew Jesus so well Hallelujah Glory the Bible said God sends prophets because he has compassion on us think about that God sent brother Ram right uh in the middle of the the 60s right the sexual Revolution God sent his servant because God had compassion and God warned him don't you look at Marilyn and R don't you get mixed up in these uh Hollywoods and look look what it's caused today God's compassion sent brother Brandon to warn us now look at 16 here's what the accusers do today they mock The Messengers of God and they despise his words and misuse His prophets that's what they're doing today misusing the prophet right making presumptions lies fairy tales they're basically making up fairy tales until the Wrath of the Lord arose against against his people till there was no remedy so see the Bible says there's going to come a time when there's no more people going to be saved and that's when God comes back right fewer and fewer like the pyramid fewer and fewer people are going to get saved all the time that's okay I'm one of them praise God and I want to find somebody else that wants to be saved Hallelujah I want to try to influence somebody to get saved praise God but what would they do they won't take God's compassion they'll mock brother Bram they'll despise brother bram's Bible scriptures and they'll misuse brother Ram that's what the Bible said but not us we're not that type speaking of John the Baptist the Bible said all the people that heard him and the publicans Justified God being baptized with the baptism of of John another words you declare God righteous when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that ought to make somebody feel good in here praise God if you've been baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've said God you're right I'm taking your way cuz that's what they did when they heard John and believed John the Bible said they Justified God they declared God's way was righteous but the Pharisees and lawyers check that look at that the Pharisees and lawyers would not be baptized under John's baptism and all these accusers they're getting re-baptized in titles father son Holy Ghost they're rejecting the Bible baptism oh my but you and I have accepted God's counsel that's just like Revelation chapter 3 Jesus said I counsel of you to for you to buy gold tried in the fires hallelujah oh how many have taken jesus' advice tonight praise God and you got eyes out for your eyes now you can see now you can understand God's word hallelujah you've taken his counsel you've taken God's advice instead of Satan's lies amen that's what the Bible say in the days of John the Baptist all those that went out to see that uh that preacher with the camel's hair on eating Locust who's this preacher all those that obeyed the Bible said they Justified God they declared God God righteous and the Bible says they took God's counsel they took God's advice so God is obligated to save them praise God oh Church we're so saved hallelujah we're saved to the day of our Redemption praise God see the correct the correct baptism is God's counsel just like Acts 19 1-6 magnifies the importance of correct water baptism hallelujah it's so important but the accusers won't be baptized or they'll be re-baptized in the the father son Holy Ghost without knowing there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost I remember this one uh I'm just going to skip down believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper Hallelujah a church what is prosperity Prosperity is a life free from demons no matter you're rich or poor sickness or health as we said last week you're prospering as long as you're free from demonic addiction hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said I would that you prosper and healthy even as your soul Prosper so see the soul of a Believer is prospering it's fruitful it's bearing the nine fruits of the holy spirit so see spiritual Prosperity is accomplished by receiving God's prophets now my wife and I can see this plainly I'm sure Naomi those who've been around long enough when you see the separation with your old friends that don't follow the message and your message you can clearly see the Prosperity that the gospel brings we've seen it recently with friends that uh having adulteries and almost divorces and all kinds of finance things just it's it's so sad but see they cannot Prosper really until they obey the word of God until they accept God's counsel Hallelujah believe the Lord but believe his Messengers amen he sent that out of his compassion hallelujah it's God's compassion to give us a servant like brother bradam Hallelujah remember and I I preached this before I'm just going to go through this quickly there's 14 doctrines that Paul preached that most of these accusers reject that means they're not being washed that means they're dirty their garments are dirty the Bible said they're stained with sin we're supposed to hate our stains the Bible says hate even the staining of your garments is not natural I got a stain right here that's not what it's talking about it's spiritual stains it's addictions that people have in their lives evil desires and they say they're closer to God how can you be closer to God denying the gospel that God gave to to Paul right or Jesus Christ gave to Paul how can you be closer you can't right imagine some of you uh sisters you know I'll use sister Lena you know she's just freshly married imagine if she denied 14 requests from Brother Austin how do you think he'd feel I'll use her because she's freshly married she's got this all love and you know I love that that's a great feeling that Honeymoon Feeling right but how' I feel you know if if my wife or whatever know now now think about that with the church these churches that reject brother R's message 14 times are saying no Jesus no no we know better we can wash ourselves no you can't there's only one way to be washed that's by Christ the husband Hallelujah he is the Fuller soap as brother Brian preached amen Christ is the soap Hallelujah and he's the water Hallelujah that means four think about that 14 stains can I just just drop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 their garments are covered in stains but yours are washed white by the blood of Jesus Amen see some of them allow homosexuality adultery fornication murder through birth control pills women preachers substance abuse viewing sinful content shameful hair lengths false conversions immodest clothing which is most of them water baptism is wrong the three works of Grace they deny the godhead is one person the gifts of the Holy Ghost uh not crossdressing right now that's not Pauline but that's Moses Mosaic Hallelujah they're also under a Jezebel spirit because they don't uh they don't I'm sorry they support the Roman Catholic Church they're under a spirit of lust in other words they have a spirit of Pride they're deceivers they lie they have unclean spirits and these are all spirits of bondage how can that be prosperity I got news for them that's not Prosperity that's destruction that's ungodly and the Bible said if they say ungodly words against Jesus then God will condemn them for all their ungodly words ungodly Deeds with all their ungodly acts but you and I are Godly but we got the anointing of godliness Hallelujah now I'm trying to get to this I'm trying to close here yeah I'm trying to look and close by eight now by God's grace and I'm already at 42 minutes here here by God's grace now this is strange this may seem strange as to you um but this was the one that of of reading all these you know I think there's a time and season for all these I'm going to just read a few things out of here and I got I'm going to play a few things for you here I hope this will raise your faith here by God's grace just to see this testimony of a sister I believe she's still alive I'm not mistaken I went and looked for a testimony and I listened to it today there's about an hourong testimony listen on double speed there uh but it seemed like she's still live I don't know um anyways uh sister Betty Collins Phillips now she's the daughter of the former Pastor Willard Collins so this is the order brother random went off the scene brother Neville was Pastor after brother Neville I think brother Collins took over now brother cols was a tape guy unashamed about it okay so of course we would differ with him but when I listened to her testimony she she kept saying read your Bible listen to the tapes and pray I thought well that's good but of course she believes in you know tape churches anything like that but that's okay we can agree to disagree by God's grace but at least she said read the Bible that's the first time I've heard that that was the first time I've heard that testimony um and with all due respect now in the book these are the pictures in the book I just kind of took them with my phone and put them on there so you can see them a little closer now there's a quite a testimony behind this picture that's her senior year picture and this is her now and I'll just try to rehearse this the best I can maybe this will speak to Lydia so Lydia wink wink here so uh in her senior year every girl in the high school had to wear uh the the the I think the shaw off the shoulder so everybody all the girls had to expose their shoulders and show all this area up here which we would call immodesty and she got up there and the the photographer said no you've got to take that off and she said no and her mom said no we're paying for this and he in other words he said so I'm like you're you're going to pay for it you're going to pay for it with with rebukes and making fun so she was the only girl in her entire senior class who wore a modest clothes like that okay she said in her testimony she got made fun of up and down the hallways and everything like that uh her senior year but during her senior year she took a she had a contest of sewing that's how it connects in here and uh she got third place at I think at the state level um and they said the only reason she didn't get first was because she didn't wear we uh that Shaw she didn't wear the shaw down where you could see her shoulders but she said then she had some other there was another event she joined and she won first prize and she said since and then brother Braham came to her and told her see Betty God God let you in there because you stood for him in your modest picture brother Raam said that was that's what God did and she said that true she said ever since she got out of school and and did some different jobs she said since she started her sewing business she said only through Word of Mouth she is she said I have so much business she's in her got in her 80s or 90s here she's never been able to catch up she has so much business and she used the testimony if you honor God in the small things God will honor you in the big things she said she can never catch up on all the work it's just by Word of Mouth people want to support her because she's tooken a stand for the word of God and she said her hair goes uh down touches the floor and is two inches on the floor and she worked at the bank for years and the the said you got to cut it and she said you're not touching me I don't she said I don't tell you what to wear she said you try to touch me I'm walking out the door and she she said they honored it and when she left she said the president of the bank she said she broke all these records on sales or whatever at Banks I don't know I'm not a bank I'm not a tell her but she said because of God's mercy and blessing she broke all those records and the president even wrote and said you are such an asset to our company we you we were so blessed because you were here and so there just she attributes all this to obeying the message that brother random preached refusing to compromise on IM I'm sorry immodesty or hair length or anything like that she that's her testimony all right so um that's a little testimony there now she saw some other Miracles let me read this one here that's right out of the book here um I have attended brandham Tabernacle since I was 10 years old except for five years we lived in Tucson from 1964 to 1969 and I've seen many healings I vividly remember that there was a girl that couldn't walk that came to church and it looked like the joints of her fingers were being drawn back into her body brother ranom prayed for her and immediately she got up and walked so she you know all the joints you know curled up in the body but she said she instantly saw the girl come come back to Ho so that's why if you hear a testimony brother man would tell her don't do this don't do that she's like I'll never do it brother man I'll never do it I'll never she had such respect for that man because of the gift of God right and here's another one um she saw or she um she was there when uh brother Edmund way died in the service and God rais him back up and I'm gonna play it right here uh I think it should be loud enough for this it's going come here that'll be louder that's brother Edmund Way's Edmund Way's wife she cries out said just a minute sit still everybody hold on let me see if I can put this up here uh case would you just put this up here let's see if this will work kind of going out on a limb here I thought maybe you like to see it there we go that's probably at least you can see the words so he goes down prays for him give him back Lord give him back strength and health so help me to start heart started beating again be still everybody and let's just pray he said it's over as I stand here on this altar where funerals has been preached where I stand here I reached down his eyes were set like he died his pulse was gone and no more called in the name of Jesus Christ and his pulse started coming back as a minister of the cross I say that in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah isn't he wonderful she was there sister Betty Collins was there she was there I'm sorry now I got to switch back over sorry well we'll just keep it like that so she was there and the testimony was the woman that cried out was Edmund Way's wife because she's a nurse and she her husband fell over and she checked his pulse no pulse brother R said he went down to her down to him his eyes were set back no Pauls R said I call upon in the name of Jesus Christ let me find that words exact words he said they said heavenly father let thy goodness or mercy and goodness be with brother way in the name of Jesus Christ may he come back give him back Lord give him strength and health that was the prayer and God brought the man back to life Hallelujah just something simple do you hear Brother Bram shouting or Screaming not in this case he does sometimes but look at the look at the humility a man dies pray for him come back to life Hallelujah he says it that's in the name of Jesus Christ now that's that's quite a thing to say hallelujah why don't you hear any these preachers say anything like that you don't hear them say anything like that all right next one um okay now I'm going to switch back over I think I'll just go in the order sorry if I had a little more time this morning I would have got up at 530 I should got up at 5 sister who I should got a little earlier sorry about that she saw the church ages light of the pillar of Fire okay now it looked like that that's that's what it looked like and I'm going to play that audio in a minute so the pillar of fire the light looked like this and then it was shadowed out that's what was on it and we went and toured it with uh 2018 with brother William and brother Aaron and they said this was where the light was right here now might not be the same wall you know I think they had a renovation but it's in the back so it' be in the back like behind Thea if this was the church be back there that's where the light and sister Betty Collins saw that with her own eyes right right that's what she saw saw it herself these are eyewitnesses I'll tell you it's a supernatural generation Hallelujah right they live through that Hallelujah but the same God is here still here today praise God we don't want to miss him in the little things Hallelujah um yeah there's there's a prophecy in her husband brother BR told her um yeah let me just read that about the church Jes I was there when the light appeared on the back wall of the tabern at the preaching of the church ages I was sitting about five rows from the back and on the same side where it appeared wow two girls that I knew were sitting nearby and they had been telling some jokes that were not very good then or they told me later that when that light appeared over their heads they thought they were going to fall over dead as the light changed shapes marking the different stages of the church ages you could feel the presence of the Lord in the building Hallelujah brother BR prophesied and told her sister Betty you will meet the right boy out west and I'm going to be sitting in your living room one day while him I'm sorry with him while you cook steaks for us in the kitchen so she said after that she always kept staks in her freezer at all times and it came to pass she married a man James Phillips it came to pass exactly as brother BR said think about that hallelujah oh it's beautiful now the sad part is you know it's near tape worship they you know they close the testimony saying I know that every answer we need is on the tapes yeah we could be but really every an is in the Bible that we need right I mean I understand I understand what they're saying he said for the tape she said for the tapes are the spiritual food that has been soared up for us now I believe that but I don't believe every single word on there is from God she said we just need to stay with the tapes well brother Braham said we just need to stay with the Bible right so I understand what they're saying and I agree we got to stay with all the scriptures on the tapes right but that'll always point us back to the the word of God so I try to say it with love and grace in my heart you know I sh I Shar the senior year picture testimony the uh sewing business testimony she's a close friend of brother I'm sorry the brother braham's daughter Rebecca okay and then let's see was there one more okay so that's what sister Rebecca looked like at her senior picture and then that's what sister Betty looked like at her senior picture they were like best friends they went to all the meetings together and always together okay so let me play u let me play again how the pillar of fire came down and I just got one more scripture after that remember this by God's grace hope you remember I'm trying to I know it won't be good to hear but at least we'll see the words now look this wayall now that's just like it is when he comes under Glory that's people seeing the light on the back wall sister Betty was there they're screaming you're moving here see it's just it's just a reflection just a reflection that it's not light here's a light hanging right here now you're seeing one I'm seeing two so they were seeing the the actual light but brother R saw that light plus the the logos or the Holy Spirit seeing two they're just seeing one they're all they're all crying looking at the light of the Holy Spirit one of them is the natural the
