========================================

by the grace of god let's go to genesis 1 26 i'm going to preach on part 4 of the mystery of the godhead we'll start with genesis 1 26 this great peculiar scripture to if we're honest to us of course but also very peculiar to denominations the sad part is though when it's procured to them they add to the word that's at the leadership of satan but the true church of the bride of jesus christ by the leadership of the holy ghost will not add anything to the word of god genesis 1 26 i'm still waiting on brother stephen for the memory verse that's fine he can just take his time by god's grace genesis 1 26 are we live now okay great praise the lord to our live streamers god bless you when i checked sunday i think we had 11 views so there's 11 blessed souls out there that we're helping out by god's grace even helps one it's a blessing praise god but as i'm going to share hopefully the live streamers are listening i want to leave youtube by the end of the year i'm just going to leave youtube i don't want to support youtube i was looking up some facts and they just delete all the facts from the conservative side they just delete all of them like you you you look for truth on one side of the like the voting of the president trump how he lost if you look for the other side you won't even find it they youtube won't even let it come up they have their albums of their algorithms in their uh algorithms rather in the system and you can't even find truth on many subjects so i'm just going to be done with them i don't care just give me a few months ago it's going to take me a few months to research and kind of get over to the other platforms i'm not going to support that i know eventually they're going to shut us all off but i'm going to boycott them before they boycott me that's my attitude so praise god genesis 1 26 as much as i can like i said i can't get away from amazon because they sell my books they print the books i can't get away from that quite yet so but all in good time if the lord tarries if not we'll be in heaven so that's what matters being with jesus praise god genesis 1 26. let's all read this together ready on three one two three and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth praise god did anybody see three persons in that verse anybody did anybody say did anybody read let all three of us persons make man did anybody read that okay then it must not be right it must be there must be some revelation laying in there hallelujah how many know there's a revelation in there amen let's bow our heads for one more word of prayer i do have some things i want to show here tonight on the slides i just kind of thought i'd do some visuals let me pull up keynote okay there we go all right let's have a word of prayer let's ask god to minister to our church's needs and also the live streamers there whatever you'd have need of tonight you know you know you can pull it out of god how many know that if you need healing you could pull it out of god tonight if it's his will right if you need encouragement uh if you need joy whatever you have need of we can pull it out of god tonight heavenly father we just come before you lord we just come expecting lord god we come to the house of god as david said to inquire of the lord to ask you questions to seek your will for our lives lord god and we know whenever david inquired lord you answered and if that was under the blood of bulls and ghosts lord we know you'll answer us as well god in our humble yet feeble condition lord god here in laodicea lord we're going to remain hot in our souls and lord help us tonight lord god to have revival in our minds oh god that it would revive our flesh as well lord we can have the anointing on our bodies on our faces oh god lord the anointing of an angel faces stephen had god help us to have the anointing today o god meet every need may every saint just pull whatever that need of out of uh el shaddai lord god and and jehovah the self-existent one lord god who reveals himself just reveal yourself today jehovah hallelujah minister to us again on this some of these familiar scriptures i just pray you bring a new light to it a fresh revelation from heaven and we'll give you all thanks and praise in jesus christ's name and the thing and the church said sorry amen god bless you being seated praise god i'm happy tonight just a little tired so see i'm a little slipping a little bit on some things so may the holy spirit help me i just want to be faithful i have just have a few visuals here i'll start with let's see i'll start with this one i kind of used some of my old slides but i kind of added some new ones so we'll look at let us make man in our image so uh in the chapter of chapter one with the godhead i started off uh by showing how god defines himself manifestations or forms not persons all right i'm just going to flip back here just to kind of get another review oh yeah then i showed the eight problems with the trinity doctrine plus the creeds uh and then all the manifestations last time we looked at modalism and the oneness move we're not modalists and we're not oneness by labels we're holy ghost-filled saints that believe god is one person praise god then we ended last wednesday with we showed the final mystery of the godhead is plural nouns and i believe it came from heaven to my opinion that god showed me that a noun is a person place or thing and a manifestation is not a person it's not a separate person from god it's a thing it's a mask of god and so that's why you can use a plural pronoun like us and our or we and it doesn't mean persons it can mean one person with other nouns right so that's just a simple a simple reason why god would use plural nouns with the godhead praise god because we know the son is a manifestation it's a visible appearing of the invisible person praise god now genesis 1 26 so now at the end of the chapter i go through all the mysterious scriptures that trinitarians use okay and then i close with is the sun eternal and then we uh then i close the chapter with that malcolm you have a question buddy okay let me know i'll be happy to help you guys if you have a question let me know i just didn't know if you had a question all right yeah let me know i can help you if you need anything all right uh so let us in genesis 1 26 so again just by reading the scripture we never see god saying let all three of us persons make man right that would be adding to the word so trinitarians again add to the word now in the book i say it's important to look at the word make right because make uh means creation right let us make okay so uh if you go to malachi 2 10 i don't have it in front of me the whole thing but the bible says we have one father and one god created us so if if in one place it says let us make and another place it says one god then we know there's no contradiction right there has to be one person made man okay isaiah 44 24 i am going to read that because i put the whole thing in the book thus saith the lord thy redeemer he that form thee from the womb notice he he i am the lord that maketh all things that stretches forth the heavens alone so whoever stretched out the heavens was alone when he did it not with three persons he says uh that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself not with two other persons i spread forth the earth by myself okay so god alone forms humans in the womb right a mother's womb god alone stretch out the heavens and god did this all by himself not with three persons right so there's two possible meanings for let us there's two possible ones now brother brahm said this in 1953 now this is a pretty early sermon right but it's still a true revelation that he preaches and then he asks this question now let us who father and son make man in our image right so brother man says it's father and son okay which i believe that's definitely one of the possibilities i believe there's two possibilities okay now let's look at the first one it's not this one but the first one is let us could we could refer to god and the angels because there's other scriptures where god talks about us and the angels and only god does something okay so you can't you can't uh you can't leave this one out this is a real strong possibility sometimes god is just speaking for heaven let us do things right in other words angels will be witnesses when god makes man right because there's examples in the bible so let's go to genesis 11. and i'm just going to teach this slowly so the kids will know it because if the lord tarries they're gonna have to have to answer these questions someday one of their friends uh one of their one of their friends will leave the message and they'll say what about genesis 1 26 and that god's a trinity and then they'll have the answers it'll be written on their heart on the fleshy tables of their hearts and hopefully the book will be there too if the lord tarries we'll see uh genesis 11 6 7 8 9. okay so at the at the tower of babel uh up in heaven god saw it and go to verse 7. he said go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth over i'm sorry the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city okay now look church it looks like here yeah if you go down to verse 9 therefore is the name of the city called babel because the lord did confound the language of the earth okay and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth okay so he says let us confound their language but it only records god doing it doesn't record anybody else just god but he says let us right it doesn't say the lord plus the second lord it don't say the lord plus the second and third person it just says the lord right now it's possible it's likely that god came with angels to scatter and confound men right uh just like god and two angels came comes down later in genesis chapter 18 and 19 right god comes down with two angels right the two angels go to sodom god said ain't going down there i ain't going down to the foolish virgin i'm saying with the elect i'm going to discern the thoughts and intents of their hearts say amen i'm saying with the elect so again it looks as if god said let us do it so god and angels come down and confound the language of the people that's what it looks like okay but it never says two persons or three persons in the godhead did this so we can't add to the word now go to isaiah 8 verse 1 isaiah 8 verse 1. isaiah 8. so in the mouth of what two or three witnesses i'm giving you two witnesses along with genesis 1 26 where god can say let us and it can mean one person never means two or three persons in the godhead it never says that okay isaiah chapter 8 one through eight all right now you know i think i wrote down the wrong scripture in the book i have to fix that oh it's isaiah 6. there's a mistake okay a typo let me write that down typo sorry it's it's page 40. i'm sorry well bible scholars will know what i'm talking about i mean anyone who said the bible so forgive me i right now i have about seven mistakes i've already found uh after the 200 i've already corrected so writing is no easy task especially for a simple man like me a simple brain man like me okay verse one uh chapter six verse one my goodness forgive me lord okay uh in the year that king uzziah died i i saw also the lord sitting on a throne he didn't say lord sitting on thrones he said one lord on one throne high lifted up and the train for this temple and above it said the seraphims each one had six wings twain he covered his face with twain he covered his feet in which twenty did fly see there are six six is a good number church now when man fails six is a bad number but satan perverts it right but it's a good number right six wings right that's anointed man okay and one cried unto the other and said holy holy holy so lord god lord of hosts the whoreth is full of his glory i'm going to skip down you know the story he said woe unto me i'm a man of unclean lips uh go down to verse eight it's where we're going and i als and i heard the voice i'm sorry also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said ah here am i send me so here we have one god on one throne he said who will go down for us he needs someone to preach but they're gonna be preaching for us in heaven but there's only one man on one god on the throne that was the lord jehovah praise god or this case yeah it was jehovah okay so we see the bible never speaks of three there's only one sitting on the throne that's yahweh and god was gonna cleanse israel through isaiah so us must refer to god and the seraphims amen it must who will go for us right because isaiah's preaching ministry was a warning from god and god always sends angels for warnings who did god send to balaam to warn him church the angel and he stopped the donkey remember that between that short straight straight way who'd he send it to warn him an angel so who's going to warn israel god's going to send isaiah and angels to warn them praise god so see let us in now three cases can mean god and the angels working together and the church said that is one possibility now the other possibility is this one just the simple this is an old slide so before day one before god started creating there was the logos [Music] okay i'm trying to skip past the illustrations okay because i think i showed this on sunday did i not the sun made everything so before day one before god created you know the sun and the moon and all these things the sun makes everything the sun makes light time space matter everything therefore you cannot have light time or days without first having the sun because the sun is the word before god was just silent all of a sudden he said let there be that was the word coming forth praise god let there be light and then he said let there be this and let there be that so the logos came out first praise god all right now that means the father created through the son the word okay so let us so now it's more than so once the light comes out and then the light starts talking now god now the father and son are working together because the angels when the angels are there the angels start seeing the light do things now it's the father and son working together right so let us make man what what day was that day six right so there was already angels there was already heavens and earth and and beasts and file of the air and all those things so when he said let us it could mean father and son right it could mean that as well no doubt it did so it may mean both of these it may mean let us can mean angels and let us of course means the father and his word but because that word has a manifestation it's a noun it's a it it's a thing right god's dwelling in that light but god is not the light god's dwelling in the light just like the bible says god dwells in the light the father draws in the light okay so uh let us could be father invisible and visible praise god all right so i hope that's a blessing and i got another one here yeah so genesis 1 26 i just have a few things i i wish i i should have removed these silly illustrations but these okay so let us make means the invisible father use his word the son or the logos the living word to create the father makes or creates using his word see ephesians 3 9. so i'll read that for you ephesians 3 9. i'll just quickly get there such i just love how the bible hides the revelation all through the bible that's why the bible said you got to search the scriptures daily praise god it's not just all laid out specifically it's got to be hidden because then those who really want to find it will go searching and finding it those who really want treasure will go looking for it then there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment ephesians 3 9 and to make all men see what is the fellowship or the intimacy or partnership of the mystery from which the beginning i'm sorry which from the beginning of the world has been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ the son so all things were created by the word by the logos we'd say praise god the the the word that came out of invisible father all right now let me see what i got next oh yeah so when when god said let us he's saying let let me and my mask create all things let let my mask and eye for gra grammarly correct let let me and my mask create man let us do it right because that's what the angels were going to see the angels are going to see god visible holy spirit logos create man right he's gonna do it on the earth okay so there are your two explanations it never says three persons are creators the bible never says and all three persons created man it never says that but let us can mean father and son or father lo god father son and angels it could mean that as well and that's in the book so you got that so god creates by his word he created by speaking just like you and i create our future by speaking to praise god how do you speak it well i'm going to be faithful to jesus all the days of my life there's a prophecy right there i'm going to go i'm going to grow deeper in love with jesus all the days of my life there's a prophecy right there i'm going to walk into that brother william i'm going to remain faithful my whole life to the lord jesus christ by the grace of god that's a prophecy i'm speaking that into existence by the word of god amen all right so are your words separate persons from you no they're expressions of your person they're a manifestation of your thoughts and that's what christ was to god he wasn't a separate person he was an expression of the character of god he was the vic jesus was the image of the invisible god amen jesus was god's thought expressed all right now so you can see the father and son though shared one image right not two there wasn't two images there there was one image so it represents one person with multiple manifestations all right pardon me let me skip here i don't know what i got on this one what did i have on this one this might be a repeat i can't i can't see my preview okay yeah so the us and let us make must be used because the light is a separate manifestation from the father the light is a noun or a thing so it's capital i it needs a pronoun it's a logos it's got divinity inside it it's not a separate co-equal person though right okay does that help with genesis 1 26 does that help anybody okay i hope so just remember even if it don't church that's okay but just tell people genesis 1 26 doesn't say three persons so it can't mean that it don't mean three gods and a real child of god will never add to god's pure word if you respect god and love god you would never add to a holy god's word praise god all right go to your bibles go to matthew 28 19. now the next section i go to is matthew 28 19. yep i got the mask okay and the invisible father okay as you're turning there matthew 20 19 uh again just a reminder for you a visual for the kids so uh some of the younger ones you know karis nature virtue victoria's got a big smile on her face jen you might catch at this service jen you might catch it the logos or the word of this is the logos of the word of god the very first light in the beginning it's also called the anointing right because that's the anointing is the messiah the power it's also called the theophany of god it's also called the son of god before he came in flesh and it's also a visible form of the holy spirit okay but the invisible form of the holy spirit is god the father okay so maybe that'll maybe they'll catch that revelation today and then they'll never have any questions for the rest of their lives by god's grace amen okay i'm doing that blinky thing i'm not sure why i did that okay all right now we'll get to this now matthew 20 19. go ye therefore teach all nations baptizing them in the names did i say that right names no it's not multiple names there's one name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost this is the most commonly used proof of the trinity but it doesn't say names for separate persons there's one name this actually reveals that god has one name and many titles hallelujah that's what it actually reveals praise god and it also says it also reveals there's one name to be called on at jesus or at a believer's baptism there's one name to call upon praise god jesus did not say names he said there's one singular name god is one person he has one name ten days after jesus said father son holy ghost peter said jesus christ shortly after that uh chapter eight would have been uh james and john no philip yeah philip said lord jesus sorry and then peter said lord right which would have been jesus christ lord jesus christ and then uh paul said lord jesus and then paul said i was buried in the name of the lord so if you put those three together father son holy ghost is what it's what name is it all right let's say it again the father's the holy ghost name is lord jesus christ and anybody that can look at this and can't admit that is blind on purpose because there's no excuses on the day of judgment the bible never offers father son holy ghost in the book of acts or beyond right it's never even found to about 100 years 80 70 years after jesus christ said fathers and holy ghosts you'll never find it okay so it's a false doctrine we know that but thank god jesus gave the revelation to peter praise god that he had the revelation that the name of the father son and holy ghost is the lord jesus christ amen now philip and paul also you use the lord jesus the preachers had complete unity that's what i love that's when i know the holy spirit's here when preachers start having unity amen when we can get our ideas together and lay aside our differences and all get down to what the word of god says then we know we got real holy spirit unity that's what i feel with randy you know when randy came i've always thought that about the squeeze i've always thought people have overblown the squeeze like we're going to be we're going to be saying i need a car i'm going to speak a scar i'm going to speak a car i need a stake i'm going to speak a stake into existence like silliness like that i've always thought that so when randy come and he said that i said praise the lord now we may have to speak some things church but that's not a guarantee right we're not looking for the rapture just so we can do miracles we're looking for the rapture to escape the the tribulation and to meet our lord to be a part of our wedding i've already been married once but there's that's a great that was a great day but i'm looking for another wedding day amen i don't know yeah i'm looking for the greatest wedding day there ever could be praise god jesus christ and his misses my and you'll never find anyone ever being buried or sprinkled with the titles father son and holy ghost all right now i for some reason brother william i only put five of these historical references in the book but now i'm gonna switch over and show you i got 14. i don't know why i didn't put all 14 in the book so you have to forgive me here i don't know what i was it's just been two and a half years it's been too long i can't remember all the things i was thinking i should have wrote it down or something okay here's here's source number one oh can i make that bigger okay i guess i can okay so the first source and so brother when we first come in the message here's what we did we were in college you know what we did we went into the libraries on our weekends and we would just look in the religious we go up to the floors my wife and i and we go looking in the religious encyclopedias trying to prove that baptism was right in the name of the lord though we had some dates like that we that was like a real fun date i'm sure for my wife that was really fun yeah being with me in a library i'm sure that's a lot of fun yeah looking for looking for historical records but simon went and scott overmar went he's since left the message but he i think he found this one if i'm not mistaken or but he found a couple and then he left the message it's so sad but we love bro scott if he's listening anyway praise god but this first one says baptism was practiced by the earliest christian groups at first only adults were baptized by immersion and in christ's name only in the second century baptism was done in the name of the holy trinity and then infant baptism followed so that means for 70 years they only use christ's name and no infants and no sprinkling and this ain't even a message book brother this this ain't a message book this is just a common encyclopedia it's called the new standard encyclopedia they got all kinds of eating sinners in there they don't care acacia it might thank you that's a good idea all right thank you that's my girl okay here's a zoomed in version just so you can see it now i made this about 10 years ago and i thought when will i ever use this well today's the day today's the day now i've shared with other people but you know i've always wondered when am i going to use this okay second one this is from encyclopedia of early christianity they say the the triune baptism is frequently attested in the second century not the first they even admit that now i think i found this one yeah because that's my handwriting see look at my nice handwriting there look at that i remember right now so there's the picture okay so that's two out of 14. here's number three this says the evidence of acts 2 20 238 1048 now that's just what i just showed you there supported by galatians 3 27 romans 6 3 suggests baptism in early christianity was not in the three full name but in the name of the jesus christ so here's the actual version of it i got all my can i say like this i got all my receipts sister naomi but william i brought all my receipts with me tonight i got proof in other words you can you can say whatever you want but you can't argue with the bible and with history unless you got dirty history but we got the right history number four this one oxford dictionary says the title fathers and holy ghost was at least from the end of the first century so about 100 years after christ some of the passages speak in the name of the lord jesus so here it is end of the first so that's about 100 a.d and uh the the didache that's an old scroll they found from about 100 a.d where they said they baptized in the titles fathers in the legos so we have at least 70 years of no witnesses of fathers and holy ghost number five this is the handbook of church history this says the baptism of christians was carried out in the name of the lord jesus christ unequivocally so without doubt without question for the forgiveness of your sins ah i feel forgiven tonight amen there's the there's the reference there's my receipts right there now look at this brother look at this it even says the reception so receiving the holy spirit was also in some way bound up with baptism so in other words if you get the right baptism you get born again amen hallelujah that's why those trinitarians don't get born again because they're not associated with the name of god they got his titles but not his name although it's not quite clear it's because they don't have the mysteries of god that's why it's not clear but with us it's clear we've got the mysteries of god now i don't mean to bore you i hope i'm not boring with these but i just want to show them to you the cat now look the catholic encyclopedia some they say some theologians have held that the apostles baptized in the name of christ only they won't admit it but at least they acknowledge it and there it is a catholic encyclopedia said they baptized in the name of christ only oh well maybe they maybe the apostles only baptized in the name maybe well how do you know look in the bible you silly goose i'd say look in the bible right all you gotta do is look in the bible those are god's instructions to get to heaven i got a little echo i love this one i think brother simon found this in the time magazine brother william from 19 and what was this sorry i'm going 1955. look at that wow 10 years before brotherham died they had it in the time magazine and it talks about a man being baptized and they actually have the literal words that the man said he said marcus i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus in rome in rome a hundred years after christ remember rome by the by i think it was by i'll have to preach i'll preach at the next mystery with the seven church ages but i think it was either in the the 30s or 40s a.d after christ the first church of rome had already got polluted so they had to start a second church of rome that was a good church so i wonder if this was from the second church of rome or the third church of rome okay so there's there there's the reference now that was the most blurry one i've got because it's so i've copied it so many times i gotta ask simon for the original copy but yeah that's from 1955. number eight is from the interpreter's bible the distinctive christian formula of baptism is in the name of jesus christ there's no trace of the trinitarian formula in the early church but it comes from liturgical use which means the nominational use in other words you don't find fathers in holy ghost so you get the denominations now for some reason i didn't highlight that so i'm sorry about that oh yeah it comes well it's right here comes from laid or liturgical use so they even admit you don't get father son holy ghost so after the apostles died and these denominational men and women started rising up there with their creeds and dogmas number nine uh the encyclopedia britannica the trinitarian formula and triumph were not used from the beginning why can't they see that if jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning praise god so what did jesus always say he said go back to the beginning praise god in that case go back to genesis but in this case go back to the day of pentecost amen when it all started why can't they see that because they're blind by their own sins now look it even says here in the second century no by the third century i'm sorry ah i forgot to turn off my internet here sorry goodness gracious let me set a timer here so i don't forget okay i i got to get some sleep tonight so here okay there it is again so blurry i'm sorry that's the best copy i could have number 10 the dictionary of bible and religion says in the name of jesus as a formula suggests passing under the lordship amen who's your lord is the trinity of your lord is three persons your lord or is the one person of god your lord see it just shows they are serving uh multiple gods right they bow down and kiss mary i mean they they serve lots of gods not just fathers and holy ghosts they got mary and other saints they worship right at a later time the baptism was a minister in the name of the trinity later time not from the beginning from the beginning it was not so so children i hope you're paying attention so malcolm one day he's gonna i think he's gonna grow up and debate people about this malachi i did a lot of work for you but hey you can find some more work too buddy there's a lot more libraries out there he can go looking you too lydia you ever go to college or anything like well go to the college library all right uh the history or doc the history of dogma what a book huh the history of dogma [Music] what a sad book brother they felt compelled to oppose the custom of baptizing in the name of jesus they opposed see the catholic church opposes us in the name of jesus let's use the safer version father there ain't nothing more safer than the name of jesus right so there it is a little again a little blurry i'm sorry you know i i i scanned them i put them in the scanner i did the best i could that's that's just the best we got after all these 20 some years of it's gonna be 20 years yeah 20 years 2001. number 12 the history of christian doctrine it says at the ons outset in the apostolic age baptism was in the shorter name or form the name of christ now of course it's lord jesus christ but at least they admit it's in the name i didn't highlight that one that's a pretty good copy now look look at this they they start saying you had to be baptized to be admitted into the eucharist which is their bread and wine that they say is the literal body and blood of the lord liars liars so see they're mixing in some truth with with their lives in these catholic dogma books which makes sense it's dogma okay the outline of the an outline of the theology of the new testament it's a true saying that people were baptized in the person in the name of jesus the oldest baptismal formula has one member so see they're saying the oldest baptism was done in the name of the lord jesus christ instead of the father and the holy ghost and that was okay i don't think i found that when that one wasn't me okay last one everybody take a deep breath ready the anchor bible i was telling my kids all day that kind of resets your mind the anchor bible it seems plain from the early material in acts that baptism was in the into the name of jesus as lord and messiah and there you got two of them well i'm sorry yeah lord lord jesus christ yeah lord there you got it lord jesus christ all right and that was yeah again very sorry sorry okay what do i got after that okay oh and then and then we have prophetic evidence do i have that okay i don't have the quote but anyways we have prophetic evidence okay i was um i thought i had the quote where brother branham said thus saith the lord oh yeah here it is i'm sorry my fault here's where i was going to forgive me thus saith the lord the baptism using the title father son holy ghost is false thus saith the lord now look at this i command every one of you on here or on tape that's been baptized in the name of jesus christ i'm sorry that hasn't been baptized in the name of jesus christ be baptized again in the name of jesus christ and the church said amen now church based upon the bible and history which is the right baptism is it father son holy ghost or is it lord jesus christ it's lord jesus christ there's not one speck or shred of evidence for the trinity lie it was that leaven hidden three measures a meal that grew up into all this false document thank god we've got a unleavened bread today amen hallelujah in other words we've got sincerity we've got truth like paul said we've got the real word of god hallelujah i'm going to leave that up there just because i don't think i have any other slides okay so i'm going to leave that up there all right now uh give me about 15 minutes here by god's grace so in the book i tell people be re-baptized if you were in the wrong baptism i said don't be ashamed of that they re-baptized in acts chapter 19 right they were under the john's baptism paul baptized them because they wanted the holy ghost because the holy ghost is connected to the right water baptism amen now here's how i was baptized in in 1996 i was baptized in the title's father-son holy ghost because i i loved god to some degree i knew god was real i wasn't serving him but i wanted to get my uh my youth teacher off my back so i said okay i'll go to the baptism class and i was baptized as holy ghost i felt good but as soon as i went out i turned on the rock and roll and i just went back into sin i mean it didn't even last five minutes you know because it was my heart wasn't right okay then when i hear brother brandon fast forward to 2002 it's like january february 2002 i'm like oh i need to be re-baptized so i called up the apostolic oneness church in akron i said can you baptize me in lord jesus christ he's like yeah so i went over that i said praise the lord and he said okay i now baptize you in the name of jesus and as i'm going down i'm like oh no i wanted lord jesus christ and i come up and they're like uh and i was too i was too ashamed to have him baptize me again because sometimes i'm too chicken-hearted you know i'll just say it yeah sometimes i'm i don't like confrontation right but as i was going down with him i'm like oh no it's the wrong baptism i'm not a jesus only so i called up brother simon i'm excited what should i do he's like come over to lima brother brooks will baptize you the right way so one weekend i drove over there on the saturday and he buried me in the lord jesus christ i've never been the same since after that time brother since that time i've never said a cuss word since that time because the name of jesus christ is like bleach and it starts washing you praise god hallelujah the blood of jesus christ the repentance right through genuine repentance he starts washing you you get washed by the waters of that's one thing i noticed immediately after that i could never say such a dirty word again what was that that was the anointing of the holy ghost coming on me amen hallelujah so that's my humble story i always tell people don't feel bad i've been baptized three times i don't care if you've been baptized brother man i said don't matter if you've been baptized 50 times the main thing to do is repent and then get the holy ghost amen hallelujah the man said they can baptize you 50 times front words face words sprinkle pour a gallon of oil on you but if you don't repent it's not going to do any good it's a outward expression of the inward work of grace that's happened in our hearts all right now here's what some liars have told me brother william they've told me first they said jesus's words have more weight than the apostles so you should use father son holy ghost i said you devil that's what i said up here i didn't say it out loud well that i mean it's true jesus's words were infallible but there they have man-made reasoning and it fails for three reasons the first is that jesus's apostles had jesus's spirit in their souls and jesus said when you get my spirit in you it'll lead you into all truth not some you won't have some truth but you'll have the false baptism come on what kind of lie is that amen these guys had the keys to the kingdom praise god they were opening the door to heaven hallelujah they had to have the key and that key was the name hallelujah repentance through the name these liars they're deceivers second this argument forces jesus and his apostles as enemies it makes them enemies well i'd rather have jesus than peter philip and james john and all these guys how sad that they want to create only the devil glory only the devil to put division between jesus and his sheep amen only the devil tried to put division between the shepherd and the sheep but jesus said when you get the holy ghost he said we are one amen as the father's in me and i and you and you and me praise god amen on sunday night praise god oh thank the lord now this is the one thing brother i didn't preach this before i wrote the book that's the one regret i have because see i could have added some of these thoughts that are coming fresh but i just had to get it out so but the nice thing is i can always make the second edition i got to fix some of these scriptures too right like isaiah 8 i got to make it isaiah 6. that's right so i want to be mindful of that at least it's out there at least it's helping people already all right now third and finally the third reason to say i'm taking jesus over the apostles it means you're cutting all the acts examples out of the bible you might as well rip out the book of acts and leave out the book of acts a bunch of devils is what they're doing they might as well take their their exacto knife and cut that out we don't need that church the thing is we need more of the word of god amen we don't need less of the word we need all the word it's only satan that would take away the book of acts hallelujah oh that's the throne of god amen you've got matthew mark luke john right but what's what's x acts is the throne acts is the presence of god amen only the devil want to take away the presence of god oh let them have this angels and seraphims all they want but don't don't let them have the prince of god oh no we're different we want the angels and we want the ark of the covenant we want the presence of christ glory there's kind of echo in here praise the lord well maybe heaven's backing me up then is that what that means i'm feeling pretty good tonight but god's grace amen hallelujah now go to matthew 13 35 this was a fresh revelation as i wrote this chapter i felt like it came from heaven brother william matthew 13 35 and i like to say brothers names more than sisters you know so forgive me sisters you know i just uh matthew 13 35. let this is what i put in the book church this uh i believe this with all my heart jesus spoke father son holy ghost and i believe he did it on purpose as a mystery right because it's part of the godhead mystery now the bible calls it and a dark sang which we'll show you very soon or a hidden truth now look at matthew 13 35 this is i just thought this was so beautiful that it might be fulfilled why did jesus so look at verse 34 he's speaking in parables in fact he did not speak to them unless he used the parable that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world so jesus was jesus came and preached and he spoke things they never heard before because part of his mission was to speak mysteries and reveal things and to his disciples the ones who really loved him part of his mystery or part of his ministry was to reveal these secret things god had held for four thousand years can you imagine holding a secret for four thousand years it don't bother god but it would bother us right but god held that for four thousand years and now's the time i'm gonna reveal that i'm father son holy ghost i'm three manifestations and i've got one name and i'm gonna reveal it through my son jesus amen the old testament never said father son holy ghost it never talked about that at all it gave no speck or shred or evidence of that but god waited till jesus came so jesus could speak things that went over the pharisees heads but the elect could receive it amen hallelujah he hid it from the eyes of the wise and brutal for revealing the babe such as would learn so god held that for four thousand years no problem god said i'm gonna wait a couple more thousand years through i'm gonna wait a couple more when he got the psalm and he said i'm gonna wait one one thousand more years so i reveal this that i'm father son holy ghost in my manifestation hallelujah now church did you see as that uh that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet did you see that that means jesus was fulfilling a previous prophecy so go to psalm 78 verse 2. go to psalms 78 verse 2. matthew is actually quoting psalms 78 verse 2. in church had matthew not told us we would have missed it right unless the holy spirit would have revealed it to us psalm 78 verse 2 is speaking of jesus now look at verse one give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old now if you've got a scofield bible run that reference look at that you see that e on the scofield parable if you go to the middle it's matthew 13 35 that's where i got that so jesus said i'm going to preach in parables because i'm going to utter dark sayings of old dark dark like the logos amen i think it dark when there was just one light amen dark sayings let there be light amen and there was the sun hallelujah amen thank god hallelujah there's my timer but i got a few more minutes till 8 o'clock dark sang like dark when there was no sun and no and no moon yes dark like that dark when it was just the father and the logos hallelujah now church that word in the hebrew dark saying means enigma and enigma is something a concept difficult to understand for the carnal mind so god said i'm going to have jesus speak things that are difficult for human minded sinful minded pharisees hallelujah praise god and so jesus would say in the name baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost and the pharisees instantly think three gods three persons a trinitarian instantly think three persons but when you have the mind of christ oh there's one name to the father son holy ghost that's the name above all names that every knee shall bow to the name of jesus christ amen it's a difficult concept for the carnal mind but not the spiritual because the spirit knows you don't add anything to the word of god you compare word with word you compare spiritual things with spiritual things god likes stigmas brother william he likes difficult things for the common mind because only the spiritual will search out say god give me the understanding what does this mean what does this mean and god what will he do he'll point others he'll point them to other scriptures because the bible interprets itself and god won't do anything outside the bible brother said he could but he limits himself to the bible so that will have a foundation amen that we'll have an absolute witness we'll have a clear testimony something we can point to and say that's thus saith the lord praise god it's thus saith the lord that's a false man-made carnal baptism but the true baptism is thus saith the lord it's right aren't you gladication you've been baptized the right way malcolm aren't you glad you've been baptized right away lydia karis victoria aren't you glad haven aren't you glad amen we're so glad it's thus saith the lord we've got the true one praise god and the denomination's got the false one that's fine let him have it i'm gonna i'm going there to tell him it's false right i just handed that to the pastor hopefully i mean my prayer brother william and hopefully they can at least get through the first two chapters i mean i know it's a long book right i don't expect everybody to read it but if they can just get those first two chapters it'll unlock the rest amen you know unlock the rest because if you get the baptism right it'll unlock everything else if you get the god head right it unlocks everything then you get the power in the name you get the gifts of the holy spirit the will of god it starts opening up the the church ages right he talks about my name in the church ages they've kept my name through all these ages they've not denied my name amen oh my you can get to the mother harlot she blasphemes the name of god like that father son only ghosts so see matthew 28 verse 19 is still an enigma it's still a dark saying to many billions of christians but not to us god promised to restore i'll restore all things saith the lord and he's revealed the enigma of god's name did you know church in proverbs 30 verse 4. let me read that proverbs 30 verse 4 did you know king agur or solomon this is a nickname for solomon did you know solomon asked god what the the messiah's name was proverbs 30 verse four verse uh yeah four thirty verse four who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fist who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name oh glory and what is the son's name if thou can tell hey hallelujah praise god solomon knew there is a god that did this but this god has a son this god has an offspring something came out of that god and started creating it was the word amen and that word is in you amen glory that's why we can speak at times and god's word backs it up amen because we're just yielding to his lips right we're just letting him flow through us sometimes we don't know what they were saying sometimes we're real bold about it but either way it's god's word coming through us and eternity eternal words goes through our lips and it happens and i sent a copy of this book just you know church i sent a copy of this book to my mother she got it she thanked me for it but she's one of the ones that told me uh she said i'd rather believe jesus over the apostles so i'm going to send her i'm going to send her some of these thoughts here tonight in a real loving way because i love i used to argue with her about it but i don't anymore and i apologize after i argued the holy spirit corrected me and said you don't argue with your mother about the word of god it's not the right spirit i'm going to share some of these things with her by the grace of the lord so they're still enigma today but not for us praise god it's not a difficult concept for us because the rest of the bible interprets it hear a little there a little line upon line hear a precept you know they're a precept you put the word of god together it tells one simple story there's no more dark sayings anymore now it's clear the light is shine the bible says the knowledge of the lord has shined into our hearts the day star has risen in our hearts amen glory all right let me see how i can close with this man i don't think i need to spend too much time on this but let's go to this god has many titles right but one name that's just this is very simple for our our loved ones in church on the debate back from uh september 2020 when i dated when i debated believe the sign we got in the godhead and i don't know if the man the man made a mistake but one of the guys he actually used this as an argument to me to try to get me to believe the trinity he said god is a father son holy ghost just like you're a father son brother pastor so he's using our argument to try to convince me god's a trinity and i just started smiling and then the other guy corrected him he said no no you can't use that one because that's ours right so even a trinitarian can see there's truth in that illustration that we're one person with many titles in the book i have eight titles at least i have eight titles and i probably have a lot more right but that doesn't make me more than one person i'm one person with many manifestations with many attributes praise god but i just thought it was so telling that the godhead really is simple if you just take enough time to look word that was one of those times i said i know the law is with me now and my enemies are trying to my arguments right i know the lord with me they really give me a call there i love that guy you know you don't like me he made some videos about me i like him by god's grace and holy ghost titles not name i'm father son brother husband uncle pastor teacher friend there's my eight titles but i'm not eight persons remember satan is called great dragon old serpent devil and satan in revelation 12 verse 9. satan is not four persons god is called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father at least he's in the book prince of peace uh we're also my father righteous branch desire of nations king messiah the prince redeemer the head stone of the corner son of righteousness the name of you there's 12 right there but he's not 12 persons new testament is called rock root and offspring of david bright morning star resurrection life true vine true light the word of god alpha mega the beginning then the first and last there's 10 there and the four beasts call him call jesus lord god almighty amen hallelujah i just gave you uh 22 23 nicknames for us all it's not 23 persons it's all the one same person it's god it's jehovah it's yahweh it's jesus amen oh glory but yet all these titles are not the name that's above every name there's a name above every title and that's the name of the lord jesus christ this is proven because every time demons were cast out they never used a title they only used a name let's close with these so go to acts uh let's close with these that's the because the children need to know that so in other words if they sense a demon use the name of jesus christ and then wait a minute i had to wait i didn't learn i had to wait a little bit until it left so they'll stand there and they'll you know they'll fight and things like that i had to wait a minute or two then the demon finally left so you got to hang on it ain't going to be instant every time you got to hang on and keep believing by the grace of god you got to stand there like on those lamplighter videos right the demons don't leave right away they got to wait till the king's name is spoken they gotta wait a little while and then then they finally leave okay now all right uh yes uh so acts 16 18. i'll go there sorry i should put it up there so here's where satan he hates it he hates to be cast out right he hates the book of acts so they they make jesus and the apostles enemies rather than embracing and saying they're all unified by the holy ghost acts 16 18 paul waits paul waits for the right time that woman with the evil spirit followed him verse 18 and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of the holy trinity to come out of here ah i command you in the name of the father to come out now it could be done i put that in the book it could be done but it's never recorded in the bible that way it's always recorded in the name of jesus christ he said let's all say together i command you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out that same hour i've seen it the same brother william i've cast out devils i think seven times maybe six i can't remember each time it's jesus when you say the the blood of jesus the name of jesus that person the devil starts fighting don't want to leave but you just stand there with the name of jesus amen satan has to move amen hallelujah miracles were only done by the name of jesus christ go to acts 3 4. peter said silver and gold have i none but in the name of the holy trinity come out no in the name of three co-equal persons come out no let's read it ready then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of what jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk demons are cast out miracles are done children in the name of the lord jesus christ you can rest your soul upon that there's power in the name of jesus christ let's stand to our feet by god's grace a church one thing we have to do you can stop the livestream let me just share this little thing here i'd like to share little personal things with you okay but i don't want the livestream to hear
