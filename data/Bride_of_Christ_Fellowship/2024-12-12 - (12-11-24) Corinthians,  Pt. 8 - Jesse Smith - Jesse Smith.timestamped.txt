[0:00] yeah let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 4
[0:01] I want to preach chapter 4 tonight if I
[0:03] can by the help of the Lord 1
[0:05] Corinthians chapter
[0:16] 4 again thank you for your understanding
[0:18] last week and know I didn't want to take
[0:19] a chance with snow being on the roads
[0:23] um you know we just my wife and I talk
[0:25] about like what would happen if one of
[0:26] you got stranded on the roads like we
[0:28] like we'd feel really bad so we don't
[0:31] want to take a
[0:34] chance couple years ago I took a chance
[0:37] and uh we were driving home on 76 we
[0:41] slid across and we bumped into the back
[0:44] of another car but thank God they got
[0:47] out I mean it was poor and snow it was
[0:49] it was awful so ever since then I've
[0:50] been a little more reserved about having
[0:53] church if there's snow coming but I
[0:56] learned uh I learned a good lesson and
[0:58] uh thank goodness there was no
[1:00] you know reported accent or anything
[1:02] like that so I just thankful for that I
[1:05] I took that as God's mercy on me my
[1:08] immaturity so 1 Corinthians chapter 4
[1:11] verse
[1:14] one we'll just read verse one by God's
[1:19] grace let's read that on three one two
[1:22] three let a man so account of us as of
[1:27] the Ministers of Christ and stewards of
[1:30] the mysteries of God may God add his
[1:33] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[1:34] can be seated here praise God I have a
[1:36] some slides I want to
[1:41] show so I just want to quickly review
[1:43] those uh Mysteries you know I got a book
[1:45] about of course but just to remind you
[1:47] it's it's quite fitting or to me it's
[1:49] quite amazing um that there's 12 Bible
[1:52] defined Mysteries there we go thought
[1:54] finally get to them okay right and so
[1:56] just interesting to remember there's 12
[1:58] there's 12 defined Mysteries Kingdom of
[2:00] Heaven is in Matthew 13 one body of Jew
[2:02] and Gentiles Gentiles in uh Ephesians 2
[2:05] The Rapture it's called a mystery in 1
[2:07] Corinthians 15 the church is the bride
[2:09] is in Ephesians 5 Israel's blindness and
[2:11] this is all from my memory here
[2:13] hopefully by God's grace I don't mess it
[2:14] up Israel's blindness was Romans 11 the
[2:17] will of God is Ephesians 1 Seven Stars
[2:20] Revelation 1 mystery of iniquity is 2
[2:22] Thessalonians 2 mystery Babylon is
[2:25] Revelation 17 mystery of godliness 1
[2:27] Timothy 3:16 Myster of the godhead
[2:30] Colossians 2:2 and Christ in you is
[2:32] Colossians 1 26 and 27 so I think it's
[2:36] fitting you know there's 12 New
[2:37] Testament Mysteries and remember this
[2:39] was I believe this was typed in a couple
[2:42] ways uh we know it was typed there in
[2:44] the Holy place right with 12 loaves of
[2:47] bread also it was typed remember Church
[2:50] Elijah had to on Mount Carmel remember
[2:52] what he had to do he had to take stones
[2:54] and rebuild the altar how many were
[2:55] there how many M 12 so think about that
[2:58] Elijah had to restore the altar of
[3:00] worship with 12 Stones brother brandham
[3:03] was the had the spirit of Elijah so it's
[3:06] a very and brother Bram actually used
[3:07] that type of uh Mount Carmel Showdown
[3:10] Mount Transfiguration Showdown then
[3:12] Mount Zion Showdown so brother raham
[3:15] actually uses that type so I think it's
[3:17] beautiful in other words God used
[3:18] brother brandom to finish the mysteries
[3:20] of God and then what the fire can fall
[3:22] the Rapture can happen Hallelujah so
[3:25] it's not it's not well known that's why
[3:27] I wrote it you know because I felt God
[3:28] inspired it to my heart uh there if
[3:31] there's 12 uh Mysteries that are defined
[3:33] there's got to be a purpose behind that
[3:34] Hallelujah there's an Old Testament
[3:36] purpose and there's got to be a new
[3:37] testament purpose Hallelujah remember
[3:40] that's called the bread of his face
[3:41] remember the Bible says the shoe bread
[3:43] is called the bread of his face so as
[3:45] you eat that bread you're eating in the
[3:47] face of God so Church we're eating the
[3:49] word of God hallelujah the true word of
[3:51] God we're not eating a dead bread we're
[3:53] not eating a molded bread tonight how
[3:55] many understand that that's why brother
[3:57] R said you can never denominate the
[3:58] message the message will never become
[4:01] stale because it's God's thus sayith the
[4:03] lord of the mysteries of God it is the
[4:06] mind of
[4:07] Christ oh we're so blessed my sometimes
[4:10] we just got to pinch ourselves and
[4:11] remember how blessed we are so hopefully
[4:13] we can pinch ourselves tonight by God's
[4:14] grace without uh breaking any skin
[4:16] Hallelujah so uh now this is Scofield's
[4:19] outline for this chapter uh I don't know
[4:21] how long I'll preach tonight we might be
[4:22] longer it might be shorter but I think
[4:24] it'd be shorter but the first eight
[4:26] verses deal with uh Judgment of Christ
[4:28] servants is not committ to men because
[4:30] remember what's what's the context he's
[4:32] still dealing I think about this for
[4:34] four chapters he's dealing with these
[4:36] people in the Church of Corinth that
[4:38] were exalting preachers too highly so
[4:40] he's finally going to bring a close to
[4:42] that uh topic with all this man worship
[4:46] think of that man Worship in the Church
[4:47] of the Living God right so what does it
[4:50] show the Church of the Living God is
[4:51] going to have problems they're going to
[4:53] still have their Humanity they got to
[4:55] overcome their sinful nature they got to
[4:57] overcome their thoughts amen Amen
[5:00] brother Simon that's right Hallelujah
[5:03] they got to overcome their evil thoughts
[5:04] they got to overcome uh their sin nature
[5:07] right because that's your your worst
[5:09] enemy is yourself okay but think about
[5:12] that for four the better part of four
[5:13] chapters Paul's trying to get them to
[5:15] see that we're all we're all just
[5:17] Servants of God there's no preacher
[5:20] that's any greater now he might have a
[5:21] greater responsibility but as far as as
[5:24] we'll see tonight as Paul's going to
[5:25] tell them where did that preacher get
[5:27] his ability not from himself
[5:30] he got it from God so Paul is going to
[5:32] remind us here tonight just about
[5:34] preachers so this was a church that was
[5:36] uh basically Church pre I'm sorry
[5:38] preacher worshippers to some degree and
[5:41] it caused such a division well we're
[5:42] better we're more spiritual because
[5:44] we're from Paul Paul saved us or no uh
[5:47] Peter saved us Apollo saved us well only
[5:49] Christ saved us uh so this is how you
[5:51] would combat that with here's here's
[5:53] Paul's ending to this here's how you
[5:55] combat preacher worship he's going to
[5:57] end it with this chapter four here and
[6:00] then he ends it by of course showing
[6:01] Paul's example of humility and then he
[6:03] starts bringing in some Apostolic
[6:05] Authority here at the end of the chapter
[6:07] which you'll see uh by God's grace so so
[6:10] uh we see it like this preachers
[6:12] preachers are just preachers but then
[6:14] God gives some more Authority than
[6:15] others God gives some more
[6:17] responsibility than others Hallelujah
[6:20] and so you'll see how Paul kind of calls
[6:22] them uh to the carpet we'd say uh for
[6:24] rejecting his ministry and maybe not
[6:26] following him like they ought to and
[6:29] church that's it's so important for us
[6:30] to follow brother brandom as he followed
[6:32] Christ in other words you take what take
[6:35] we we recognize brother R was a prophet
[6:37] of God a church age messenger and but we
[6:39] got to still take everything he said
[6:40] back to the word of God
[6:43] hallelujah so uh let me move on here now
[6:46] again I I changed a few of these words
[6:47] here but we're in the second part of
[6:49] with their carnal divided condition uh
[6:52] think about that a church with all those
[6:53] gifts operating all the time were still
[6:56] divided so I imagine you'd have like one
[6:58] family over here that would do give and
[6:59] then another family over here that would
[7:01] have their gifts and then a family in
[7:03] the back that would do gifts and they
[7:05] would all just uh try sometimes they
[7:07] interrupt each other and Paul said let
[7:09] it be one at a time please hallelujah
[7:12] amen think about that they had this this
[7:14] family had these gifts that family of
[7:15] that you know they had all these gifts
[7:17] there but they were just trying to uh
[7:20] compete a little bit Paul said there
[7:21] can't be competition uh there's an order
[7:24] to the the plan of God there's no
[7:26] confusion there's not there's supposed
[7:27] to be no confusion in the family of God
[7:29] in the house of God either Hallelujah so
[7:32] he's got to you know rebuke them there
[7:33] here in in the the seventh section with
[7:35] spiritual gifts and charity and he's got
[7:38] to get the church in one Accord how many
[7:40] you happy to be in one Accord here
[7:41] tonight I I sure am again I keep
[7:43] thanking God every time I go back to
[7:45] this I'm like thank you Lord for the
[7:46] little church that we have praise God uh
[7:48] we're not maybe big or well known or
[7:49] anything like that but as long as God
[7:50] knows us that's all that matters
[7:52] Hallelujah as long as we get to see
[7:54] Jesus's face and he'll say Well done
[7:56] that's all that matters and remember you
[7:58] know they had they had so many so many
[7:59] problems they had division which was
[8:01] basically Pride sexual morality uh they
[8:04] had uh legal issues
[8:07] drunkenness uh that the the rich people
[8:10] were mistreating the poor uh they had
[8:13] just chaos with spiritual gifts not in
[8:15] order uh uh just just too much going on
[8:19] and they even lacked generosity to Paul
[8:21] they weren't very kind to the prophet of
[8:23] God the the preacher that actually
[8:25] established the church they kind of
[8:26] forgotten about him he was kind of like
[8:28] the old the old old God and we kind of
[8:30] moved on from him and uh we're moving on
[8:33] to new and better things and our
[8:34] preachers are are more eloquent than him
[8:37] right that's kind of what they were
[8:37] getting at and then they of course
[8:40] through that they suffered false
[8:41] teachers so they got the people that
[8:43] would just make them maybe shout or get
[8:45] them emotional or maybe get really
[8:47] intellectual and use different words but
[8:49] Paul said when I come among you I just
[8:51] know Christ and him crucified so see he
[8:54] had to just humble himself like that and
[8:55] just bring he just had to be different
[8:57] than these uh false teachers
[9:00] okay so chapter 4 let a man so account
[9:03] of us as of the Ministers of Christ and
[9:06] stewards of the mysteries of God so here
[9:09] we see Paul explains preachers are to be
[9:12] viewed as overseers so you should see me
[9:15] and other preachers like brother Simon
[9:17] brother uh Brooks brother uh cam we got
[9:20] brother uh uh can't think of brother Jim
[9:24] Shoemake sorry brother Jim if he's
[9:25] listening it took me a minute to think
[9:27] of our brother uh brother Brian Pastor
[9:29] brother Jim she sorry brother Jim love
[9:31] you buddy uh but you know look at us
[9:33] we're we're just overseeing what God is
[9:35] doing we're just PL we're trying to
[9:36] plant God's seeds and we're trying to
[9:38] water God's seeds right but again God
[9:41] gives the increase but it's but what are
[9:44] we overseers up Paul says look at us as
[9:46] overseers of the mystery so the shoe
[9:48] bread right the bread right we can use
[9:51] that we can use that symbolism right
[9:53] that's what the uh Old Testament priests
[9:55] did once a week they would replace the
[9:57] bread they put fresh bread down and eat
[9:59] the bread that that that was uh close to
[10:02] getting old but it never got old in the
[10:03] presence of God but every week they
[10:05] replace it then they would eat that
[10:06] bread right there right there in the
[10:08] presence of God the the uh the the bread
[10:11] of God's face right in the worship of
[10:13] the Lord and so now Paul gives us that
[10:15] same imagery that's what new testament
[10:17] preachers do so think about uh think
[10:19] about how blessed we are that we
[10:21] understand the mystery of the godhead
[10:23] right or we understand the mystery of
[10:25] the
[10:25] Rapture think how think how blessed we
[10:28] are to understand these things
[10:29] a lot of churches you know they're not
[10:31] even get the people ready for a Rapture
[10:33] they just think Jesus is going to come
[10:34] back one day and say I'm here and the W
[10:36] the corridors of Heaven brother going to
[10:38] drop down and he's going to come right
[10:40] to the Catholic church or right to the
[10:41] Methodist Church or right to the World
[10:43] Council churches said I here I am I'm
[10:44] your savior now the Millennium is going
[10:46] to start but Jesus said Paul said
[10:49] differently he said I'm coming like a
[10:50] thief in the night he said and live in
[10:53] such a way that you're counted worthy to
[10:56] escape the tribulation period Hallelujah
[10:58] so they only look at certain scriptures
[11:00] they don't look at the whole scripture
[11:02] but preachers I I we're supposed to be
[11:04] overseers I'm supposed to oversee and
[11:06] make sure that the mysteries of God are
[11:09] taught the correct way that's Paul says
[11:11] that's our job Hallelujah oversee and
[11:14] make sure we manage we are
[11:17] superintendant or overseers of the
[11:20] mysteries of God hallelujah and notice
[11:22] he says Mysteries so that means there's
[11:24] more than one right so some people
[11:26] misunderstand Revelation 10:7 they say
[11:28] oh finish the mystery of God they say oh
[11:30] it's just one mystery like it's just the
[11:32] godhead or it's just uh you know some
[11:34] other mystery but that just means
[11:36] Revelation 107 just means it's saying
[11:39] God's going to finish all the Bible
[11:41] defined Mysteries Hallelujah because
[11:43] Paul says here we're stewards of more
[11:45] than one mystery the mysteries of God
[11:48] hallelujah so we see it
[11:50] plainly and then uh Paul's going to
[11:52] further explain the role the preacher to
[11:54] help the Corinthians overcome their man
[11:56] worship right and divisions that it was
[11:59] causing okay uh so so Paul's trying to
[12:02] get them to see look preachers are just
[12:04] overseeing in other words preachers
[12:06] don't own the church and the church said
[12:08] I don't own you I'm not a lord over you
[12:11] right I don't tell you what to do I tell
[12:13] you what the word says hallelujah but
[12:14] I've got to live it first Hallelujah
[12:17] right I'm just watching over God's sheep
[12:19] right I'm just I'm just watching this
[12:21] belongs to God everything here belongs
[12:23] to God hallelujah but we just watch over
[12:26] it for a little time you ever think
[12:27] about that you ever think about that
[12:28] what would happen if brother Jesse
[12:29] passed
[12:30] away what would you do you know what
[12:32] would the local church do you know you
[12:35] got to be you got to think about that
[12:36] you know because I'm just an overseer
[12:39] right or what if God called brother
[12:40] Jesse and his family to move to Germany
[12:43] something like that you know who knows
[12:47] you know some people have hinted me
[12:48] brother Jesse uh I'm getting older would
[12:50] you ever want to come out and be the
[12:52] pastor when I when I retire I'm like
[12:56] nope uh I'll pray about it
[13:00] because I kind of know their Church
[13:01] situation I don't want to be a part of
[13:04] that um you know and that that would be
[13:06] all just you know human idea without the
[13:08] Leaning of the lord we got to be led by
[13:10] the Holy
[13:11] Spirit but you got to think about that
[13:13] I'm just I'm just overseeing I'm just
[13:15] making sure I'm supposed to watch over
[13:17] your souls if somebody gets in trouble I
[13:20] see somebody outline I'll say I'll text
[13:21] them or call them or talk to them after
[13:23] service is everything going okay can I
[13:25] help you out with something because I'm
[13:26] just overseeing right I can give my
[13:29] thoughts about what you should do but
[13:31] ultimately it's got to be you and God
[13:33] hallelujah yeah also Paul mentioned the
[13:36] mystery of God remember earlier in the
[13:37] letter so again he's bringing this up
[13:39] idea of the mysteries of God because he
[13:41] said we don't speak uh the wisdom of the
[13:43] world we speak the wisdom of God in a
[13:45] mystery Hallelujah that's why people
[13:48] can't understand many times our sermons
[13:49] if we try to explain it to them uh then
[13:51] you got to explain brother Bram you got
[13:52] to say explain the church ages then you
[13:54] got to explain the seven angels you know
[13:56] the seven churches it it's just really
[13:58] deep
[14:00] it's not a light shallow word it's a
[14:02] deep word hallelujah and so that's okay
[14:05] so you can expect that when you're
[14:06] trying to explain things you know it's
[14:07] going to take a little longer time and
[14:08] it's okay if they don't understand it
[14:10] the world won't understand it but the
[14:12] elect will
[14:13] Hallelujah Paul said that's and we're
[14:15] just stewards of those Mysteries we're
[14:19] just watching over make sure that the
[14:21] mystery of God is revealed to the people
[14:23] of God
[14:24] hallelujah and you know like I like I
[14:26] said and thank God church God or the
[14:29] Mysteries For Your Glory but the only
[14:31] Glory that you could have is Christ in
[14:32] you the hope of glory again it's not
[14:35] again these preachers are nobody special
[14:37] even the no nobody's uh special uh the
[14:40] only Glory we have is if God would so
[14:43] grace us with his Spirit to live inside
[14:45] of us amen that's the only hope we have
[14:47] for glory amen that's why that's why
[14:49] they call Christ and you the hope of
[14:51] glory It's Our Hope of being glorified
[14:53] having a glorified body is Jesus Christ
[14:56] Living in us in our soul and then giving
[14:57] us a new body Hallelujah in a glorified
[15:01] State verse two moreover it's required
[15:04] of stewards that a man be found faithful
[15:06] now remember Paul's saying this to the
[15:08] church there in Corinth they had
[15:09] preachers but some of them weren't all
[15:11] faithful so Paul said you got to be
[15:13] faithful with the mystery of
[15:15] God but with me it's a very small thing
[15:18] that I should be judged of you or of
[15:20] man's judgment yay I judge not my own
[15:23] self so there's one thing that's
[15:26] required of me amongst all the I I was
[15:28] reminded there's over 20 requirements
[15:30] for a preacher in the Bible a new
[15:31] testament preacher New Testament right
[15:33] first Timothy 3 uh and then numerous
[15:36] other verses there's just there's 15
[15:38] just in 1 Timothy chapter 3 I've got to
[15:40] live all those requirements
[15:43] Hallelujah so but I I'm reminded
[15:45] faithfulness is one of those
[15:47] requirements faithfulness to the
[15:48] mysteries of God hallelujah I have to
[15:52] Faithfully watch over and preach the
[15:54] mystery of God
[15:56] hallelujah now look Paul says here he
[15:58] says I he's not concerned about how
[16:00] others judge his
[16:02] faithfulness right he says it's a very
[16:05] small thing see I'm not really concerned
[16:06] that I I should be judge of you or any
[16:09] man he said I really can't even judge
[16:11] myself Christ is going to be the judge
[16:14] he's the real judge right because we
[16:15] we're always lenient with ourselves
[16:18] right we can judge other people man that
[16:19] person is so bad look at but when it
[16:21] comes to us uh yeah God gave me Grace
[16:24] for
[16:26] that right we we can always judge the
[16:28] other guy or the other girl we can
[16:30] always judge them real good but oh when
[16:32] it comes to me oh well God's going to
[16:33] have mercy on me of
[16:37] course verse four for I know nothing by
[16:41] myself isn't that so humble a prophet of
[16:42] God who seen Jesus Christ I don't know
[16:44] nothing by myself yet am I not hereby
[16:47] justified in other words I can't justify
[16:50] myself God has to justify me and he that
[16:54] is ultimately going to judge me is the
[16:56] Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now look
[16:59] Paul says he wasn't aware of any wrongs
[17:01] in his ministry see see I I don't know
[17:04] nothing by myself I don't know that I
[17:06] actually did anything wrong he knew he
[17:08] could not justify himself Only God can
[17:10] judge the preachers ultimately now we're
[17:12] going to say say this soon but we can
[17:14] judge their fruits but God ultimately
[17:16] knows what they're going to turn out to
[17:18] be Hallelujah we are commanded by Jesus
[17:21] to judge them by their
[17:23] fruits right so we're commanded to judge
[17:25] that may that means make a decision
[17:27] about a certain situation but but we
[17:29] ultimately don't know what's going to
[17:30] happen on the day of judgment brother
[17:31] said there's going to be a lot of
[17:32] surprises on the day of judgment and we
[17:34] got even got in the Bible right even in
[17:36] the Bible they said they said Lord when
[17:38] do we see you sick and visit you when
[17:40] did we see you and we gave you food and
[17:42] uh hungry and and we fed you and thirsty
[17:44] we gave you water he said when you did
[17:45] it to the least of these my brethren you
[17:47] did it unto me Hallelujah so we can
[17:49] plainly see in the scripture there's
[17:51] going to be some surprise on the day of
[17:52] judgment Hallelujah but thank God the
[17:54] Bible said if we're born again we have
[17:56] boldness on that day Hallelujah in other
[17:58] words the bride won't be surprised
[18:00] that's what it means Hallelujah because
[18:02] we can see there's two resurrections for
[18:05] two judgments Hallelujah which we're
[18:06] going to end with that tonight by God's
[18:07] grace I put a YouTube video out about it
[18:09] a couple weeks ago so you'll probably be
[18:11] familiar with it if you watched it
[18:14] Hallelujah verse 5 therefore judge
[18:17] nothing before the time until the Lord
[18:20] come so what would that be the Rapture
[18:22] right or it would be the second coming
[18:24] for the white Throne judgment because
[18:26] there's there's more comings who both
[18:28] will bring to light the hidden things of
[18:31] Darkness now that's a awesome thing but
[18:32] that's also could be a scary thing if we
[18:35] have uh what do they call it skeletons
[18:36] in our closet that's like a worldest way
[18:39] to say it if we've got sin in our closet
[18:42] uh if we're aen or something like that
[18:44] see it could be a scary thing and will
[18:47] make manifest the counsels of Hearts now
[18:49] that's what I think is so amazing God
[18:51] will be able to manifest what was your
[18:53] counsel what was your thinking when you
[18:55] did this certain thing what was your
[18:57] actual motive and in behind it I hope it
[19:01] was good will because remember that's
[19:03] that's another meaning of Love Is Good
[19:04] Will you want good for the other
[19:10] person he's going to bring everything to
[19:12] light everything in darkness is going to
[19:13] come to light so we better confess it
[19:14] now so it don't come out
[19:17] Hallelujah and then shall every man have
[19:20] Praise of God so Paul expresses the
[19:22] wisdom for the Corinthians to not pass a
[19:25] final judgment on a ministry right a I'm
[19:28] talking about a final judgment we're
[19:29] supposed to judge current fruits brother
[19:31] remember I read that quote last week
[19:32] brother said judge your life by the
[19:34] current fruit you're producing so other
[19:36] words take take account of your life how
[19:38] am I living before God do you see any
[19:39] fruits in your current life you should
[19:42] right the fruits of the spirit the nine
[19:43] fruits of the spirit remember in the
[19:45] previous chapter he said some Ministries
[19:47] will have no reward likely due to secret
[19:50] or public sin because the fires are
[19:53] going to declare the fires of your life
[19:55] right or the fires of the fiery eyes of
[19:58] Jesus as the white Throne judgment
[20:00] Hallelujah either fire is going to
[20:03] manifest what our lives were really
[20:05] about who are we really living for oh
[20:07] let's live for Jesus amen let's live for
[20:10] him
[20:11] Hallelujah all hidden things will be
[20:13] brought to light and what is the praise
[20:15] of God what do you mean God's gonna say
[20:16] Oh Praise oh yeah yeah I praise you
[20:19] you're such a wonderful person no the
[20:20] praise is well done good and faithful
[20:23] servant that's the praise that's
[20:26] biblical praise
[20:30] Hallelujah so this is what you tell
[20:33] preacher worshippers right this is what
[20:36] you should tell them see because a
[20:39] preacher can hide we've I I just show
[20:40] you that example preachers hid things
[20:42] for 50 60 years they can hide things but
[20:46] you're not going to hide anything from
[20:48] Christ hallelujah it's all going to come
[20:50] out
[20:51] eventually verse 6 and these things
[20:54] Brethren I have in a figure transferred
[20:56] to myself and to Paulo for your sakes
[21:00] that ye might learn in us not to think
[21:03] of men above that which is written now
[21:05] remember what's written give preachers
[21:07] double
[21:08] honor that doesn't mean worship them
[21:11] right just give them honor give them
[21:13] respect right but don't give them above
[21:16] double honor which will be
[21:18] worship see that no one of you be puffed
[21:22] up for one against another so see they
[21:26] lifted Peter so high he just like
[21:28] Untouchable they lifted Paul so high or
[21:31] Apollos was such an eloquent uh preacher
[21:34] that he's just so great like like we're
[21:36] just better than you guys our church is
[21:38] better than
[21:40] yours my my baptism when I got saved it
[21:43] was way better than when you came in the
[21:46] message right that's that's a prideful
[21:49] thing to say and so Paul says don't
[21:52] magnify myself or
[21:54] Apollos uh because both men didn't
[21:57] magnify themselves Paul doesn't walk
[21:58] around and say look how many Souls I won
[22:00] I'm so much better than Apollo Paul say
[22:02] look we transferred this figure to
[22:03] ourselves here we're trying to lead by
[22:05] example and show you that we never
[22:07] exalted ourselves so don't you exalt
[22:10] yourselves Paul wanted them to learn to
[22:12] avoid prideful divisions amongst
[22:14] preachers and those preachers who had
[22:18] converts for who maketh thee to differ
[22:21] from one another and uh that's a good
[22:23] question and what hast thou that thou
[22:25] did not
[22:27] receive so Paul was reminding them if
[22:29] Peter had a certain gift well didn't
[22:31] Peter get that from somewhere where'
[22:33] Peter get oh that's right that's right
[22:34] he got the keys of Kingdom from Jesus
[22:36] that's
[22:36] right he didn't pull those out of his
[22:38] own pocket and say look what I was born
[22:40] with look what I've got I'm such a great
[22:43] man or Apollo said yeah my mom or my dad
[22:46] made me this great oror I'm so eloquent
[22:49] because of my dad it's because of me no
[22:52] God gave him that ability and church
[22:54] that's why I think I think you recognize
[22:56] on Sunday I think you did a really
[22:57] wonderful job by God's grace you know I
[23:00] love to see when people come up for
[23:01] prayer but you recognize when God's
[23:02] dealing with you you recognize when
[23:04] God's preaching through someone's gift
[23:06] and it's not the preacher anymore it's
[23:09] God that's what we want to live we want
[23:11] to approach services like that we can
[23:14] realize okay this is beyond uh just
[23:17] coincidence this is beyond I I sense the
[23:19] Holy
[23:20] Spirit right and so that that's what
[23:23] that's what Paul's bringing out here
[23:24] everything that uh everything that was
[23:27] good about the preach came from God to
[23:30] benefit the body of Christ to make us
[23:32] better
[23:34] Christians now if thou did receive it if
[23:37] the preachers receive that eloquence or
[23:40] receive those keys or that that gift of
[23:43] faith brother call the gift of faith
[23:44] Bulldog
[23:45] Faith who's seen a bul you've SE have
[23:47] you seen a bulldog lately
[23:49] brother okay well brother Ram always
[23:51] explain it like a bulldog would grab on
[23:53] and just wouldn't let go so I don't know
[23:56] does that does that seem right
[24:00] okay aggressive okay so brother R would
[24:02] say or Roberts had Bulldog faith and you
[24:04] can watch you can watch his videos
[24:05] online I don't know I don't know it
[24:07] seemed like at the end he turned out a
[24:08] little way off way off the word but he
[24:11] would sit there on at the platform and
[24:13] he would just he would grab a hold of
[24:14] the people's heads and pray for them so
[24:16] sincerely his hair would be hanging down
[24:17] you know he was just so sincere sweating
[24:19] all over the place brother man said or
[24:22] were basically quote the word of God and
[24:23] he wouldn't let the word of God go until
[24:26] uh until the people receive their
[24:27] healing just Bulldog Faith just hanging
[24:29] on I believe it God's going to do it the
[24:31] word of faith
[24:33] Hallelujah so he calls that Bulldog
[24:35] Faith well where did or Roberts get that
[24:37] he got that from Jesus Hallelujah
[24:39] Bulldog
[24:41] Faith you know what you know what
[24:43] impressed people about brother brandom
[24:44] brother Bram didn't have to raise his
[24:46] voice remember uh some of the people
[24:49] that had seen
[24:51] uh there was
[24:53] TBN uh what was it Paul what was his
[24:57] last name CR Paul cruss he started TBN
[25:00] he saw brother brandom in the 1950s and
[25:03] he said what what made him different he
[25:04] said was a little 5 foot whatever he was
[25:07] man walked out there and he started
[25:09] explaining where sin came from and then
[25:11] when he got in the prayer line he didn't
[25:12] shout and scream he just rebuked Satan
[25:15] and asked everybody to Bow their heads
[25:17] and then they saw Miracle after Miracle
[25:19] after miracle and he realized that was
[25:21] more like Christ than uh that then maybe
[25:23] just shouting in Emotion all the time
[25:25] now you have both right you have both
[25:28] but uh where did he get that gift where
[25:29] did Brother get that gift where did or
[25:31] Robert get that gift they got it from
[25:33] God and the way you know it comes from
[25:35] God is God works behind it Hallelujah
[25:38] God strengthens the people behind it God
[25:40] heals the people when they pray for them
[25:43] Hallelujah glory to God so if you
[25:46] received it why do you glory so he's
[25:47] telling these all these divided people
[25:49] in the church why are you glorying in
[25:51] the man as if uh they didn't receive it
[25:54] as if they always had it why you
[25:55] worshiping the man worship the god that
[25:57] gave the gift alah give God the credit
[26:00] say thank God for the for the gift of
[26:02] God thank God for the move of the Holy
[26:03] Spirit praise
[26:05] God so God made each preacher different
[26:08] and gave them their different gifts
[26:09] preachers didn't give themselves their
[26:11] gifts but the Corinthians were
[26:13] glorifying the the men rather than
[26:16] glorifying Christ
[26:19] Hallelujah now he says now I don't know
[26:22] this is a a strange statement so I I
[26:24] this is one or two things this could be
[26:26] Paul using sarcasm
[26:29] and saying the Corinthians were exalting
[26:31] themselves and their false preachers and
[26:32] degrading Paul and his uh preaching
[26:35] companions or not he says now he says
[26:38] now ye are full so that might mean full
[26:40] of preachers or full of
[26:43] gifts he says now you are rich now he
[26:46] probably means naturally but it could be
[26:48] something else could be uh just have a
[26:50] lot of gifts again a lot of spiritual uh
[26:52] move lot of moves of the the gifts of
[26:54] the holy spirit ye have Reigns as kings
[26:57] with without us and I would to God ye
[27:00] did Reign that ye that we also might
[27:03] reign with you so I can for for sure say
[27:08] certainly true that the Corinthian
[27:10] Church was enjoying the benefits of the
[27:12] labors of the original
[27:15] Apostles right because when Christianity
[27:17] first started out persecution
[27:18] persecution persecution but then after a
[27:20] while remember it started relaxing a
[27:21] little bit okay well all right we'll
[27:24] just deal with the Christians we won't
[27:25] kill them all we'll just we'll just put
[27:27] up with them so it's clear you know Paul
[27:29] says I would to God ye did Reign that we
[27:32] also might reign with you so it seems
[27:33] like Paul's saying you know I wish that
[27:35] we were treated the same way you
[27:37] were because we're the ones that labored
[27:39] he's going to say we're the ones that
[27:42] labored so but Paul could be using
[27:44] sarcasm saying well you're rich and full
[27:46] and you're reigning as kings in other
[27:48] words we're not we're not exalting
[27:50] ourselves like you guys are exalting
[27:52] yourselves now verse 9 is interesting he
[27:54] said for I think that God has set us
[27:56] forth the apostles la
[27:58] or made made them least in other words
[28:00] as it were appointed to death right for
[28:04] we are made a spectacle unto the world
[28:06] and to angels and to
[28:09] men okay so Paul's saying all the
[28:11] apostles were appointed to die for the
[28:13] gospel on the stage or theater of the
[28:16] visible and invisible world that word
[28:20] spectacle means a amp theater stage
[28:23] right and they were used to having those
[28:24] right in Corinth right all the the Greek
[28:27] and Roman places had where do you go for
[28:28] entertainment they didn't go to the
[28:29] movie theater they went to the
[28:31] amphitheater right so Paul's saying God
[28:34] has set us original Apostles we are
[28:37] Apostles and we're appointed to die on
[28:39] the stage of the world
[28:42] right now here's just I want to remind
[28:45] you how all these men died think about
[28:47] these are our heroes Church These are
[28:48] heroes here these are the Warriors of
[28:51] Faith the Hall of Fame of Faith James
[28:54] was stabbed with a sword and
[28:55] died that was the greater James the
[28:57] Lesser was stoned to death St Jude was
[29:00] filled with arrows died by arrows Philip
[29:03] was crucified by soldiers Thomas was
[29:05] thrust with a spear the one that doubted
[29:08] Christ he so believed that he let him he
[29:11] let himself be killed with the spear
[29:13] didn't fight back St Paul was beheaded
[29:16] in Rome St Peter was crucified upside
[29:19] down St John he was the only one that
[29:21] died a natural death Matthew was stabbed
[29:24] with a sword Judas of course hung
[29:26] himself the traitor uh Simon was
[29:28] crucified Bartholomew was
[29:30] flayed and then beheaded
[29:33] flayed St Andrew was crucified on an X
[29:37] shaped
[29:38] cross and Maas was
[29:42] crucified now who would want to live in
[29:44] that time and be one of
[29:48] those who wishes oh I wish I got the lot
[29:50] who's going to take judas's place I hope
[29:52] that lot falls on
[29:53] me you know what you're getting into you
[29:55] know what you're asking for that's what
[29:57] that's what he got he took judas's spot
[30:00] and he got a crucifixion for that's why
[30:02] the Bible said of whom the world isn't
[30:05] worthy of these kind of people the
[30:07] world's not worthy of people that would
[30:08] sacrifice their lives for the Gospel of
[30:11] Jesus Christ Hallelujah real
[30:14] men we also see though how Paul now we
[30:19] can see why Paul would say the Saints
[30:20] will judge Angels right because even the
[30:23] demons are looking at the Believers here
[30:26] as uh players in a play
[30:28] they're watching and trying to influence
[30:30] and trying to U mess up their lives and
[30:33] try to get them to fall spiritually
[30:36] right they're interacting and they're
[30:37] trying to cause them to stumble don't
[30:39] you know well we know the Bible says
[30:40] Satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom
[30:43] he may
[30:44] devour
[30:46] right but see this is why uh God had
[30:50] Paul say We'll judge we'll be a witness
[30:52] against the evil spirits we're fighting
[30:54] against spiritual wickedness in high
[30:56] places Hallelujah
[30:59] amen so we see what a what an importance
[31:01] it is and I was thinking of uh uh the
[31:04] queen of the South remember she she'll
[31:06] she'll judge she'll be a witness against
[31:09] all those Pharisees because she crossed
[31:12] the desert to get to Solomon and a
[31:15] greater than Solomon was there
[31:16] Hallelujah Jesus right so what do we see
[31:20] if you if if you want to be used by God
[31:22] you got to give everything you can to
[31:24] stand up for the truth if you want Jesus
[31:27] to pray raise you and say Well done now
[31:29] I'm not talking worship I'm talking
[31:30] about saying well done you know what I'm
[31:32] talking about but it's for the live
[31:33] stream people that don't know me or
[31:35] whatever they're trying to criticize me
[31:36] or something like that if you want Jesus
[31:38] to say Well done you got to let your T
[31:41] you got look at your life and say what
[31:42] in my life do I need to give up in order
[31:44] to support the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[31:47] right but those Pharisees wouldn't even
[31:48] go across the desert they wouldn't even
[31:50] go across the street they wouldn't even
[31:52] uh they wouldn't even humble themselves
[31:53] and repent recognize this is true this
[31:56] man's preaching the truth they weren't
[31:58] willing uh to leave their Cash Cow right
[32:00] they they weren't weren't willing to to
[32:02] leave their moneymaking schemes and
[32:04] their false religions so it shows to us
[32:06] we must do everything we can back up the
[32:09] word of God with everything we got and
[32:11] Jesus will say Well done amen like the
[32:15] queen of South Hallelujah she her whole
[32:17] life was focused on getting to the truth
[32:20] knowing the truth knowing the true God
[32:22] giving God all you have serving God with
[32:24] all your heart let that be our desire
[32:26] tonight amen
[32:29] like these rugged men of the faith
[32:32] Hallelujah whom the world is not
[32:36] worthy verse 10 we are fools for
[32:39] Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ
[32:41] so again this might be
[32:43] sarcasm or it might be uh expressing the
[32:47] shame that he and the early Apostles
[32:49] endured so younger Christians would be
[32:52] better prepared and have more
[32:54] benefits right so we know our lives are
[32:56] a lot easier now because we can just go
[32:58] on our phones right and I'm not going to
[33:00] show any funny pictures like I did that
[33:02] one time on my iPad I was all wondering
[33:03] why are you laughing what did I say that
[33:05] was ah then my wife told me in the van
[33:08] later okay so I deleted those off my
[33:11] iPad I got them saved
[33:13] elsewhere but you know we we can just we
[33:17] can do two clicks and we're hearing
[33:18] brother brandom they didn't have that do
[33:20] we know how blessed we are they had to
[33:22] do the real and just sit down and like a
[33:24] movie show and watch the real and then
[33:25] replace the real they didn't have a fast
[33:28] forward they didn't have a listen to it
[33:30] at at Double
[33:31] speed all right so Paul's saying we're
[33:35] fools but you're wise we're weak but
[33:39] you're strong you're honorable we are
[33:43] despised
[33:47] Hallelujah so he's either being
[33:49] sarcastic or expressing that we have it
[33:51] so much better because people have gone
[33:53] before us and labored for us I I tell
[33:56] you what I'm so thankful God God
[33:57] anointed all those people to listen
[33:59] brother RAM and type out every single
[34:01] word it makes my life so much
[34:04] easier H many times numerous people
[34:07] email me brother Jesse can you find this
[34:08] quote yeah let me type it
[34:10] in so easy it's so easy I'm thankful for
[34:14] the labors of the Saints Hallelujah that
[34:16] have just given their lives decades uh
[34:19] hours Untold hours so for me to write a
[34:22] few little books or make a few videos
[34:24] that's easy I didn't do the hard work
[34:26] they did all the hard work
[34:28] some of those videos I can do in half an
[34:30] hour or 45 minutes if I'm really moving
[34:31] fast or something like that can get a
[34:33] lot done fast but that's because of the
[34:35] labors of those who've gone before us
[34:37] hallelujah so I want to be thankful for
[34:39] that ver uh I'm sorry I forgot I was
[34:42] going to inject something in
[34:44] there I don't remember what it was now
[34:46] maybe I just forgot to take it out verse
[34:48] 11 even unto this present hour we both
[34:51] hunger now here Paul's talking about his
[34:53] group of preachers the older Apostles
[34:55] with him and either even uh Timothy
[34:59] so uh the Corinthians were not in this
[35:01] state right they had everything they
[35:03] were in a a port city uh that was we'd
[35:05] say the the Greek capital of Rome right
[35:09] we dealt with that earlier in the series
[35:11] but Paul and his his uh preachers were
[35:13] hungry thirsty naked so didn't have all
[35:16] the clothes they needed they were
[35:18] buffeted and had no certain dwelling
[35:21] place right so they wandered from here
[35:23] to there not knowing exactly where
[35:25] they're going to lay their head for the
[35:26] night and this is this this is this is
[35:29] on the stage of life right everybody's
[35:32] watching these people so you have these
[35:34] the Corinthians they they and they have
[35:36] everything opposites they have all the
[35:37] water the food they got all the clothes
[35:39] they have beautiful
[35:41] homes and then these preachers these
[35:43] vagamon preachers come
[35:45] in they're not as well spoken Paul Paul
[35:49] said I'm fearing and trembling when I'm
[35:50] among you he was a fearful man you there
[35:53] was times he was really humble really
[35:56] really nervous didn't have all the food
[35:58] uh which which which your houses can I
[36:01] stay at tonight Saints you know or you
[36:03] know what I'll just set up a tent one of
[36:05] your backyards because I'm a tent
[36:07] maker I I I don't want to bother anybody
[36:10] is there just some maybe some public
[36:11] park or some place I can set up my tent
[36:14] and all these other guys in the church
[36:15] at cor they're rich they got all these
[36:17] mansions and big
[36:18] houses what a what a
[36:21] contrast but they're so prideful they
[36:23] just become used to this church we got
[36:24] to be careful not to get used to things
[36:26] right
[36:28] remember the good old gospel amen
[36:30] remember the oldfashioned Gospel of
[36:32] Jesus Christ
[36:33] Hallelujah now thankfully in a small
[36:35] Church like this we can do that more
[36:36] easily probably brother R said you build
[36:38] a big church he said usually when people
[36:39] build a church they backslide on
[36:42] God right because think oh everything's
[36:44] done everything's good and we just got
[36:46] everything made now and so they stop
[36:48] caring about the spiritual things of God
[36:51] can't let that happen to us verse 12 and
[36:54] we labor working with our own hands
[36:57] being reviled we bless see people tear
[37:00] us down we're supposed to bless them
[37:02] Hallelujah being persecuted we just go
[37:05] through it we suffer it that's just part
[37:07] of life that's just part of being a
[37:08] Christian I I'll just suffer through
[37:10] I'll just get through it I'll have long
[37:11] suffering Hallelujah right because
[37:13] that's one of the attributes of love
[37:15] right charity charity suffers
[37:17] long not only that Paul was being
[37:21] defamed and but we entreat so we we
[37:24] plead for Mercy for these people who
[37:26] speaking evil against us
[37:28] is that how you don't you feel sorry for
[37:29] people that mistreat you and speak evil
[37:31] things about brother R don't you feel
[37:32] sorry about that we should be intreating
[37:35] for them we should be interceding for
[37:36] them we're made as the filth or the refu
[37:41] refuse or trash of the world and we're
[37:44] the offscouring so offscouring is just
[37:46] the scraping you know how you scrape
[37:47] things off your plate throw in the trash
[37:49] or whatever that's what Paul said that's
[37:51] what we are we're the stuff you scrape
[37:53] off in the trash we are the
[37:55] trash right of all things unto this day
[38:00] so hardly a good word for Paul and yet
[38:02] he's the one that started the
[38:05] church now look look at the mercy that
[38:08] is in Paul's heart for these people he
[38:11] started the church and I'm going to pull
[38:13] that verse yet before I forget he's the
[38:16] one that started the church and this is
[38:18] the respect that they got for
[38:22] him where is it uh
[38:27] oh yeah okay yeah got a lot of emails
[38:29] today really I thought it was on top
[38:31] it's way down a little
[38:34] lower Paul had started the church he had
[38:37] uh been used by God Jesus protected him
[38:39] remember uh when we looked at the
[38:41] beginning he said I got many people in
[38:42] this city but I'll say he but Jesus
[38:44] didn't tell us how what what these many
[38:46] people were like there were many
[38:47] immature
[38:49] people not many uh stallion Saints or
[38:52] something like that or
[38:55] pedigree stallions these
[38:58] these are immature little babies here
[39:00] right church is that right Church you
[39:03] understand that there's message churches
[39:04] that are mature and there's baby message
[39:06] churches sometimes you got a mixture of
[39:08] both in the
[39:10] congregation you would think the people
[39:12] the man that started the church you
[39:14] would think they would honor him and
[39:15] respect
[39:17] him nope they stopped doing it and he
[39:21] became like trash and this guy's in
[39:23] prison this guy he become like trash to
[39:26] them
[39:30] I write not these things to shame you
[39:32] but as my beloved Sons think about that
[39:34] can you express love to someone who
[39:36] would call you trash could you do that
[39:39] are do we do
[39:41] that oh you're just a trashy Preacher
[39:44] Brother Jess and I have to look at them
[39:46] and say they're beloved they're they're
[39:48] just lovely people they're such lovely
[39:50] people that takes the love of
[39:53] God really takes the love of God Paul
[39:56] lived on a higher level and this church
[39:58] said he lived in the fears in the
[40:01] Heavenly places in the love of God even
[40:04] though people call me trash even though
[40:05] uh they don't listen to me they're still
[40:07] my beloved
[40:09] children talk about
[40:11] Grace so see he said I'm not writing
[40:13] these things to shame you but to warn
[40:16] you you know I was reading through U
[40:18] yeah that's right uh Ezekiel this week
[40:20] but I think it was last week that and
[40:22] Ezekiel he's the one who who wrote about
[40:23] the Watchmen on the
[40:25] Watchtower and the whole point of the
[40:27] Watchman was to look stay up all night
[40:30] and if he saw swords and horses coming
[40:32] he had to let them know or the blood of
[40:33] the people was on his hands and God said
[40:37] Ezekiel you're the Watchman tell the
[40:39] people all their sins so as a preacher
[40:42] I'm responsible at times if if you tell
[40:45] me or if God anoints me I got to call
[40:47] out
[40:48] sins and you got to do it to me too
[40:50] right but you need two or three
[40:52] Witnesses against a preacher right or a
[40:54] pastor in the mouth of two or three
[40:55] Witnesses right don't receive any
[40:57] witness brother gave the example with
[40:59] Orman Neville someone says I saw Orman
[41:01] Neville drunk brother said you better go
[41:03] get a second witness and bring some
[41:05] proof right so we're we're in this
[41:08] together if we're wrong God's going to
[41:10] make us right if we really want to be
[41:12] right Hallelujah he's going to correct
[41:13] us because we're God's
[41:18] children so again he's bringing out this
[41:20] different look at the stark contrast
[41:22] between the prideful preachers Rich uh
[41:24] everything's eloquent everything's
[41:26] perfect divisions
[41:28] chaos no church order versus The Humble
[41:31] poor Paul and his people fear trembling
[41:34] not super well spoken what a contrast
[41:38] that happened in just a few number of
[41:40] years a few years of the church and now
[41:43] they've already moved away from Paul so
[41:45] far because of pride of course then
[41:48] sensuality you know with the sexual sins
[41:50] and money and uh the love of money's
[41:52] root of all evil so we know that got in
[41:54] there too for though you have 10,000
[41:56] instructors in Christ boy this this
[41:58] pastor had a lot of guest preachers in
[41:59] there 10,000 guest preachers yet have
[42:04] not ye many fathers so there wasn't a
[42:06] lot of people that could really uh give
[42:09] them a real uh you know yield to the
[42:11] Holy Spirit and give them a real
[42:12] experience with Christ just people tell
[42:14] you what to do oh you know you should do
[42:16] this for this this for gifts this for
[42:18] communion you should do that with that
[42:20] situation with the man and stepmom just
[42:22] instructing you what to do but not many
[42:24] real fathers who tell you the truth
[42:30] Hallelujah now I don't know how many I
[42:32] know maybe one or two I don't know how
[42:33] many of us had really good
[42:40] Fathers ah you're too
[42:43] sweet but for us
[42:47] adults you know I don't know how many of
[42:49] us had really good Fathers but Paul
[42:51] would have been a spiritual father he
[42:52] would been a great father and here's
[42:53] what a father does a father remember he
[42:55] started off the letter by saying all the
[42:57] good things then he said you know what
[42:59] here's where you're
[43:01] short he's a real father in The Gospel
[43:06] Hallelujah for in Christ Jesus I have
[43:08] begotten you through the gospel so
[43:10] remember who's the who's the preacher
[43:13] God used to really bring you to the
[43:14] gospel truth that'd be a spiritual
[43:16] father right I've told you about mine I
[43:18] thanked him on Father's day to kind of
[43:20] bring me to the the message and the
[43:22] truth and I I kind of could even look at
[43:24] Simon kind of that way you know in fact
[43:26] he's the one that kind of
[43:27] uh just wouldn't let me leave
[43:28] Thanksgiving night without me listening
[43:30] to that serpent seed sermon he just had
[43:31] that and I just said okay brother okay I
[43:33] promise you we'll listen to
[43:36] it um but I thank God for all the
[43:39] faithful fathers in the gospel that have
[43:42] led us to the truth verse 16 wherefore I
[43:45] beseech you be followers of me so he's
[43:47] begging now he's now he's getting into
[43:49] begging beseech means to beg entreat
[43:51] please please follow me because why I've
[43:54] seen Jesus Christ I've seen him I was
[43:57] out in Arabia he revealed the message to
[43:59] me remember Galatians chapter one he
[44:01] said uh he called me to bring you out of
[44:03] the power of darkness and bring you into
[44:04] light
[44:06] Hallelujah so he said follow me follow
[44:09] the church age messenger Hallelujah
[44:10] let's follow brother Ram's Ministry
[44:12] because it's a bible-based Ministry
[44:14] Hallelujah now here's a good one you can
[44:17] use this for all your doctrines I've
[44:18] used this in my book this is a beautiful
[44:20] scripture for this cause have I sent
[44:22] unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son
[44:25] and faithful in the Lord who shall bring
[44:27] you into remembrance of my ways which be
[44:30] in Christ as I teach everywhere in every
[44:33] church now that is a awesome scripture
[44:36] that means Paul taught women should not
[44:38] cut their hair and men should cut their
[44:40] hair in every
[44:41] church right Paul didn't compromis he
[44:43] taught them all the same thing this
[44:45] means he baptized them the same way in
[44:47] every church that means he called out
[44:50] homosexuality in every church right
[44:53] church he said Timothy's going to tell
[44:55] you everything that I teach CU I teach
[44:58] the same thing in every Church
[45:00] Hallelujah that's what I try to do you
[45:02] know when I get little uh Evangelistic
[45:04] invitations you know like Kentucky and
[45:06] Iowa I try to preach the same thing I
[45:08] preach right here in fact I always
[45:11] preach a sermon that I've already
[45:12] preached to to all of you so you're
[45:14] aware of it you know because I don't
[45:15] really get new things all the time you
[45:17] know uh as far as some great Revelation
[45:19] or some new understanding or something
[45:21] like that but I want to be as faithful I
[45:23] want to teach the same thing in every
[45:25] church that's what Paul did Paul was
[45:27] faithful Hallelujah and again you can
[45:30] take that I think in my book I have uh I
[45:33] think it's 14 in the the 2021 book I
[45:37] have 14 Pauline doctrines that most
[45:39] churches do not
[45:41] teach so we would say they're not uh
[45:44] they're not faithful to Paul's gospel
[45:46] they're not faithful to the the true
[45:47] Gospel of Jesus Christ but by God's
[45:49] grace we teach all of them we preach all
[45:52] of them hallelujah we're preaching what
[45:54] Paul preached hallelujah amen
[45:57] now he says now some are puffed up as
[45:59] though I would not come unto you now
[46:01] look some are even prideful like oh
[46:02] there's no way Paul's going to come back
[46:04] he's he's all washed up he just writes
[46:07] and he says it later uh you know he just
[46:10] writes weighty letters he just warns
[46:11] people with letters he actually won't
[46:13] come and actually correct us to our face
[46:15] but Paul says you just wait I'm going to
[46:17] come Hallelujah there's prideful people
[46:20] saying oh he's not going to come he
[46:21] don't want to deal with it face to face
[46:25] right but that's Pride that would would
[46:27] be puffed up verse 19 but I will come to
[46:31] you shortly I like this if the Lord
[46:33] will and will know not the speech of
[46:36] them which are puffed up but the power
[46:38] let's see what what's behind those words
[46:41] what kind of character is behind those
[46:42] words those threats all that Pride for
[46:45] the kingdom of God is not in word but in
[46:48] power or Revelation right or obedience
[46:51] to the word of God
[46:55] hallelujah verse vers 21 what will ye
[46:58] shall I come to you with a rod or in
[47:01] love or in the spirit of meekness so see
[47:04] what would a father sometimes fathers
[47:05] have to spank right even mamas right
[47:08] mamas sometimes moms got to spank with a
[47:11] rod they got to bring a rod of
[47:12] Correction now that's what he's going to
[47:14] do in the next chapter he's going to
[47:15] bring a rod against the man that was
[47:16] sleeping with the Stepmom kick that man
[47:19] out of the church don't even eat with
[47:22] anybody that's committing sexual sin
[47:23] like that don't even eat with them give
[47:26] give them over of Satan that Satan might
[47:27] destroy their body that their soul could
[47:29] be saved that's a rod that's a
[47:33] spanking get that person why are you so
[47:36] why he says it later why why are you so
[47:38] puffed up that you haven't mourned over
[47:40] this sexual
[47:43] sin now does he come in love yes he
[47:46] brings in love in Chapter 13 We Looked
[47:47] at Love was he in meekness yes he said I
[47:50] Came In Fear and Trembling in Chapter 2
[47:52] he said that I come in fear and
[47:54] trembling he said but when I come how do
[47:57] you want me to come amongst you do you
[47:58] want me to bring a rod do you want me to
[47:59] come in love or in the spirit of
[48:01] meekness now we find out later when Paul
[48:04] finally gets there they actually
[48:05] repented of a lot of these things right
[48:07] we'll get that in the we'll get to that
[48:09] Lord willing in second
[48:11] Corinthians he thanks them and remember
[48:13] he tells him he said don't let that
[48:15] brother mourn too much try to encourage
[48:17] him isn't that something Satan will get
[48:20] somebody so Brash well I'll sleep with
[48:23] whoever I want but then when they then
[48:25] but then when God finally gets them to
[48:26] repent and then Satan will get them on
[48:28] the other side oh you'll never be
[48:29] forgiven you don't you shouldn't even go
[48:31] to church you're you're so filthy and
[48:33] you're so wicked nobody wants to be with
[48:35] you it's just from one to the other but
[48:38] Paul says encourage that man who
[48:40] repented encourage him you know thank
[48:42] God God save you thank God God can
[48:44] forgive you he's washed you in his
[48:46] Precious Blood amen encourage that guy
[48:49] because Satan's here trying to get you
[48:50] to be prideful with your sin or beat you
[48:52] up and make you feel bad about it you
[48:54] got to find right down the middle and
[48:55] know I'm washing the blood of the Lamb
[48:57] Hallelujah so I stand I stand as a
[49:00] Christian that's in uh the second letter
[49:03] there second Corinthians I'm almost done
[49:06] hard to believe now uh one thing if you
[49:08] got your Bible go to 2 Corinthians 12:15
[49:11] this is one thing I want to
[49:14] say I've said this before but I'm going
[49:16] to say it again 2 Corinthians 12:15 you
[49:18] know in in relationships it's you're
[49:21] either The Giver or you're the
[49:25] taker in every Rel relationship you're
[49:27] either a giver or a
[49:29] taker right and what does Paul tell them
[49:31] Paul tells him this letter at the end of
[49:33] his second letter and I'll be very
[49:35] gladly spend and be spent for you though
[49:38] the more abundantly I love you the less
[49:41] I Be
[49:43] Loved this has always struck me like oh
[49:46] my goodness Paul lives the example and
[49:50] church I've seen this in my life before
[49:53] I keep loving people and the more I love
[49:55] them the less they love
[50:01] me but see you got to I don't have it up
[50:03] there sorry but you got to recognize
[50:05] that if you're the mature person the
[50:07] real spiritual mature person you realize
[50:08] that I've got to keep loving them even
[50:11] though they're not returning any love to
[50:12] me that's what a Christian
[50:15] does boy how did this person cool off on
[50:17] me what did I do to them and realize I
[50:20] didn't do anything wrong right you even
[50:21] ask him did I do something no no no oh
[50:24] okay so this is a given I see I'm The
[50:26] Giver this relationship you're a taker
[50:28] in other words this person's immature
[50:31] this person's selfish I've got to be
[50:34] selfless that's what a Christian does
[50:37] that's what Jesus said Jesus said be
[50:39] like your heavenly father he sends rain
[50:41] on the just and the unjust whether they
[50:43] recognize it or not he's good to them he
[50:45] sends sun he sends rain he's good to
[50:48] people even if they're not good to him
[50:50] that's a real Christian
[50:54] character Paul kept loving these people
[50:56] people visiting them trying to correct
[50:58] them but the more he gave the less he
[51:00] got returned now our human our Humanity
[51:02] brother Austin we think oh I ought to
[51:04] get something back pretty soon goodness
[51:07] I mean I've send them this and I've done
[51:09] that I've done that when are they ever
[51:11] going to acknowledge it and but they
[51:12] might not but that's okay Jesus
[51:15] does hallelujah you can out give God
[51:20] hallelujah remember do it to them like
[51:23] you're doing it to Jesus
[51:25] Hallelujah I love this the more you love
[51:28] people sometimes the less they're going
[51:29] to love you that's okay that's what
[51:32] we're called to do we must be like our
[51:34] heavenly
[51:35] father right isn't he isn't he now less
[51:38] loved than ever
[51:39] before but what does he keep doing keep
[51:42] going it's Clockwork sun's coming up
[51:46] tomorrow Clockwork that paycheck's going
[51:48] to come in in the mail right Clockwork
[51:51] just love love even though sometimes
[51:52] even us are his children even us we're
[51:54] Unfaithful even us we make mistakes we
[51:57] sin and yet he's still faithful to
[52:00] us the more he loves the less he's loved
[52:03] by the world so we have to increase our
[52:05] love for Jesus continue to grow love the
[52:08] Lord so you you see this with Paul's
[52:10] relationship the more he loved them and
[52:13] even corrected them the more he gave to
[52:14] them right then the less they loved him
[52:17] back he said that's
[52:20] okay the reason I can love is because
[52:22] Jesus loved me
[52:24] first and so I just I just got Lov in my
[52:26] heart I just have to love whether people
[52:29] love me or not I've got to keep loving
[52:32] them so how many want to be a real
[52:34] Giver because in every relationship
[52:36] there's givers and takers let's be
[52:38] givers of God's love
[52:40] Hallelujah I'm almost done actually I
[52:43] just want to finish with this so a
[52:44] couple weeks ago I put out this uh I
[52:45] thought this would be good to uh preach
[52:47] because I had not preached
[52:50] it uh I don't have slides for all these
[52:53] verses so I have some of them but not
[52:55] all of them kind of ran out time there
[52:56] at the end of the day judgment seat of
[52:59] Christ now remember Paul said he that's
[53:02] spiritual judgeth all things yet he
[53:04] himself is judged of no man so we have
[53:06] to remember we have to have that filter
[53:07] we have have to have a thinking man's
[53:09] filter the word of God filters
[53:10] everything that comes through we got to
[53:12] it filters out anything anything sinful
[53:14] filters out of our
[53:16] Lives that's so we got to remember that
[53:17] we have to judge all things because one
[53:19] day all of our lives are going to be
[53:21] judged so that's why we got to judge all
[53:23] things because everything in our life is
[53:25] going to be judged right or wrong
[53:27] then he said in chapter three now he
[53:29] that planteth he that WTH or one every
[53:31] man shall receive his own reward
[53:33] according to his own labor so the
[53:35] question I got was brother Jesse can you
[53:36] explain the Judgment seat of Christ and
[53:39] it was a good question it said how can
[53:41] uh how can verses say we won't come into
[53:44] judgment but then the Bible said
[53:45] everyone will stand before the Judgment
[53:46] seat of Christ excellent question I've
[53:48] wondered that myself so I didn't have a
[53:50] video on it so I said yeah I'll study
[53:52] that out I'll make a video on it by
[53:53] God's
[53:55] grace so so the Judgment seat of Christ
[53:58] for us is judgment to
[54:00] rewards that's the whole thing when when
[54:02] it says for the bride you'll stand
[54:03] before the Judgment seat of Christ is to
[54:05] stand there to be given your
[54:09] reward now where're to judge the fruits
[54:11] of preachers Jesus said that Matthew
[54:13] 7:16 but God judges their final
[54:15] destination okay every man's work I
[54:16] preached this a couple weeks ago Every
[54:18] Man's work will be made manifest the day
[54:19] will declared because it will be
[54:21] revealed by fire either the fires of
[54:23] jesus' eyes or the fiery Trials of Life
[54:25] probably both and the fire shall try
[54:27] every man's work of what sort it is if
[54:29] any man's work abide which we have built
[54:31] thereon he shall receive a
[54:33] reward Allelujah so see we're judged for
[54:37] rewards if any man's work shall be
[54:39] burned he shall suffer loss but he
[54:40] himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
[54:44] so the fire of God's eyes right looks on
[54:47] him on Mercy he must have confessed his
[54:48] sins he gets no reward other than
[54:50] eternal life that's the foolish virgin
[54:52] we pl plainly see that in the scripture
[54:54] now I'm going to read these Romans 14:10
[54:57] there's two scriptures that talk about
[54:59] everybody standing before the Judgment
[55:00] seat of Christ verse 10 but why Dost
[55:03] thou judge thy brother about meats and
[55:05] holy days and all these things or why
[55:06] does thou said it not thy brother for we
[55:08] shall all stand before the Judgment seat
[55:10] of Christ everybody say all ready oh
[55:12] we're all going to stand before Christ
[55:14] like I did a couple weeks ago I said
[55:15] Malachi Smith come on up Jesse Smith
[55:17] come on up Austin ly come on we're all
[55:19] going to stand before the Judgment seat
[55:20] of Christ look at he's look at that he's
[55:22] going to be seated on the Judgment seat
[55:25] we're coming before the judge the holy
[55:27] judge all of us got to stand there and
[55:30] those fiery eyes are going to just
[55:33] reveal what's in our heart and
[55:36] life for it is written I as I live
[55:39] sayith the Lord every knee shall bow to
[55:41] me every tongue shall confess to God so
[55:45] let then so then every one of us shall
[55:47] give account of himself to God brother
[55:50] Austin what' you do with what I gave you
[55:53] right brother Jesse what' you do with
[55:55] what I gave you what you do with it well
[55:57] Lord I I I dedicated my life to you Lord
[56:01] Jesus everyone we're all going to stand
[56:03] before the Judgment seat of Christ so in
[56:05] this context Paul's saying don't judge
[56:07] somebody because they eat this and they
[56:08] got holy days here and the church
[56:12] said second Corinthians
[56:17] 5:9 wherefore we labor that whether we
[56:20] present or absent we may be accepted of
[56:21] him that's why we labor so God will
[56:23] accept our works we're working for him
[56:26] for we must all appear before the
[56:27] Judgment seat of Christ that everyone
[56:29] may receive the things done in his body
[56:31] according to that he hath done whether
[56:33] it be good or bad I love it God just
[56:35] makes it so simple did you do good or
[56:37] did you do bad oh God help me to do good
[56:41] Hallelujah help me to do good because
[56:44] it's either going to be good or bad he
[56:45] just makes it so simple you're either
[56:47] one or the other let's be good by the
[56:49] grace of God now I'm not going to read
[56:51] these because of time but uh Jesus said
[56:54] uh verely let's read this one this is
[56:56] one of brother's most I think be loves
[56:58] scripture that's just my thought John
[57:02] 5:24 this is one like we said you might
[57:04] want to say this every night before you
[57:06] you you go to
[57:08] sleep verily verily I say Toto you he
[57:10] that heareth my word and believeth on
[57:12] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[57:15] how many believe tonight you have
[57:17] everlasting life amen and shall not come
[57:20] into
[57:21] condemnation but is pass Glory from
[57:24] Death unto life hallelujah amen amen
[57:26] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus we
[57:28] all can see Austin's a new creature amen
[57:30] thank god brother Hallelujah we can all
[57:32] see as a new creature that was funny we
[57:34] were telling the stories a few weeks ago
[57:36] about how he used to act we were just
[57:38] laughing that's the same thing we do
[57:40] when I talk about my old days too but
[57:42] it's just funny because we can all see
[57:44] it we can all see he's a new creature in
[57:47] Christ Hallelujah the old things have
[57:49] passed away behold all things are become
[57:51] new
[57:52] Hallelujah and the the believer the real
[57:55] believer in Christ won't come to be
[57:57] condemned because he's already passed
[57:59] from Death un life he's already a new
[58:02] person remember Roman 7 says that you
[58:05] were married to uh the the your old life
[58:07] of sin but that's you're dead that life
[58:10] is dead and now you're married to Christ
[58:13] hallelujah amen your old spouse is dead
[58:16] and so you're free from the law of sin
[58:17] and death amen hallelujah you're free
[58:20] from that and you're married to
[58:22] Christen oh what a husband Hallelujah
[58:25] Romans 8 833 says who shall lay anything
[58:29] to the account of God's elect hallelujah
[58:31] it's God that justifies us amen see
[58:34] nobody can put any condemnation on you
[58:36] because Jesus already paid the price for
[58:38] it it's already put away it's already
[58:40] been abolished
[58:42] Hallelujah say it's like putting ink in
[58:44] a a bottle of Clorox right it all
[58:46] spreads out and you don't see it anymore
[58:48] it's all gone Hallelujah all my sins are
[58:51] gone you ask me why I'm happy I'll just
[58:53] tell you why because my sins are gone
[58:57] Satan got you Satan you got me into
[58:58] trouble but Jesus got me out amen I'm
[59:02] glad my sins are gone
[59:04] Hallelujah Glory now in Matthew 25
[59:07] there's two Parables there's parable of
[59:09] the talents and parable of uh the white
[59:12] Throne
[59:12] judgment and there's two Praises let's
[59:15] read those Matthew
[59:17] 5:21 I'm sorry Matthew 25:21
[59:21] sorry well I thought I'd be done here
[59:24] 25:21 his lord said unto him well done
[59:26] thou good and faithful servant thou Hast
[59:28] been Faithful over a few things I will
[59:30] make thee ruler over many things enter
[59:32] thou into the joy of the Lord this is to
[59:34] the wise
[59:35] virgin okay so this is the praise of God
[59:38] well done you've been Faithful over a
[59:40] few enter into the joys of the
[59:44] Lord that's his praise to you the the
[59:47] wise virgin now the foolish virgins in
[59:49] 33 and 34 look but look what he still
[59:51] says now that's what he would say to
[59:53] Abraham right here's what he would say
[59:54] to lot
[59:58] let's skip down to verse 34 then shall
[59:59] the king say to them on the right hand
[1:00:01] Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:00:03] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:00:05] foundation of the world Come Ye blessed
[1:00:08] and inherit what the inheritance I have
[1:00:09] for you but the other one sounds a lot
[1:00:12] better well done good and faithful
[1:00:14] servant you've been faithful I'll make
[1:00:15] you rule over much enter into the joys
[1:00:17] of the Lord who do you say more to the
[1:00:19] wise
[1:00:20] virgin can you ever see
[1:00:22] that Hallelujah all right then and the
[1:00:25] Bible said 1 John
[1:00:27] 4:17 I'm going read
[1:00:43] that here in is our love made perfect
[1:00:47] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:00:48] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:00:52] this world so in other words we are
[1:00:54] ambassadors of Jesus Jus Christ that's
[1:00:56] what Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:00:58] 3 I believe it is we're ambassadors so
[1:01:01] we're the representatives of
[1:01:03] Christ but what's our attitude on the
[1:01:05] day of judgment
[1:01:07] boldness so we'll be able to walk up as
[1:01:09] I as I showed that as I dramatized that
[1:01:11] we'll be able to walk up kind of there
[1:01:12] with boldness be like thank you Lord I
[1:01:15] know where I stand by Your Grace has
[1:01:17] brought me this far here uh here's the
[1:01:20] account of my life and I'll say it with
[1:01:21] boldness because I know my life he's
[1:01:24] clean he's clean my life he's washed my
[1:01:26] life he changed my life he's the one
[1:01:29] that gave me life Hallelujah so we have
[1:01:32] boldness in one aspect on the day of
[1:01:35] judgment we know who we are we know
[1:01:37] we're the children of God now here's a
[1:01:40] last few visuals now I'm sorry it's
[1:01:41] smaller than what I meant to be but
[1:01:43] remember there's two resurrections the
[1:01:44] first resurrection is after the Rapture
[1:01:47] that's for the living dead and the wise
[1:01:48] virgin Christians it's the resurrection
[1:01:50] unto life Jesus says in MA John 5:24 the
[1:01:54] second Resurrection is the white Throne
[1:01:55] judgement I'm sure you're familiar with
[1:01:57] this it's for unbelievers and foolish
[1:01:59] virgin Christians it's also called the
[1:02:00] white Throne judgment or Resurrection
[1:02:02] unto judgment there's all the verses
[1:02:05] there you got all the verses for the
[1:02:06] first resurrection and then the verses
[1:02:08] for the second
[1:02:11] Resurrection now what what what what we
[1:02:14] do is we go to the Judgment seat of
[1:02:16] Christ and there's at least three things
[1:02:17] that happen at the Judgment seat of
[1:02:19] Christ first we're presented to Christ
[1:02:21] as a Chase version to Christ think about
[1:02:24] that we we presented as a spotless bride
[1:02:29] that's why all you sisters like to get
[1:02:30] married with the white dress on
[1:02:32] right and all the little ones want to
[1:02:33] grow up and do just like you we all now
[1:02:36] all the little ones want to be like Lena
[1:02:38] because they all saw it maybe one day
[1:02:40] I'll be like
[1:02:41] Lena that's good she should be your role
[1:02:43] model Hallelujah you got to see it but
[1:02:46] that's what Paul said I'm going to
[1:02:48] present the the Corinthian Church the
[1:02:50] same church that had people sleeping
[1:02:51] around suing people prideful divisions
[1:02:56] I'm going to present those that repented
[1:02:58] as a chased Virgin of Christ amen the
[1:03:01] Corinthian Church is going to walk down
[1:03:02] the aisle like Lena
[1:03:05] did in the perfect harmony of everything
[1:03:09] perfect decorations and Harmony and
[1:03:10] everything looking perfect we're
[1:03:13] presented so after the Rapture we go to
[1:03:14] the marriage supper lamb there's a
[1:03:16] presentation uh we believe the church
[1:03:18] age Messengers will present the
[1:03:20] Believers as a chased virgin to Christ
[1:03:22] Paul will say here's the first church
[1:03:23] age these are your this is your bride
[1:03:25] from the First Church H then the second
[1:03:27] third fourth fifth six then brother R
[1:03:28] comes in the seventh and presents us as
[1:03:30] a Chase version of
[1:03:32] Christ that's what the Bible said Paul
[1:03:35] will present them as a Chase virgin and
[1:03:37] then rewards are given out that's what
[1:03:39] we're talking about the J we must all
[1:03:40] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:03:42] to be given
[1:03:45] rewards you were Faithful over these
[1:03:47] things now you be ruler over this that's
[1:03:49] your
[1:03:50] reward so you're not done ruling when
[1:03:53] you die you just got started
[1:03:55] amen hallelujah praise God we're just
[1:03:58] getting started ruling over sin
[1:04:00] Hallelujah ruling over uh the Millennium
[1:04:03] Nations cities Hallelujah you get your
[1:04:06] reward that's the Judgment seat of
[1:04:08] Christ the Judgment seat of Christ for
[1:04:10] the bride rewards and also there's
[1:04:12] communion uh after the battle after
[1:04:15] Abraham won the battle that he had uh
[1:04:19] communion with MDC right and then Jesus
[1:04:22] said uh after the battle I'll drink the
[1:04:24] vine a new with with you in my father's
[1:04:26] Kingdom now the father's Kingdom's got
[1:04:28] to be up in heaven because Jesus said
[1:04:31] I'm going to have my own throne in the
[1:04:32] Millennium the son of
[1:04:35] David Hallelujah so everybody can see
[1:04:38] that so there's at least three things we
[1:04:39] do during the marriage supper of the
[1:04:42] Lamb while the world is going through
[1:04:43] the Great Tribulation period there's at
[1:04:44] least three things one of them is we get
[1:04:47] judged for rewards I want everybody say
[1:04:49] rewards ready rewards not to
[1:04:51] condemnation rewards there's a Payday
[1:04:55] coming Hal hallelujah
[1:04:57] hallelujah probably won't see on this
[1:04:59] side but we'll get rewarded on that side
[1:05:01] we'll all stand before the Judgment seat
[1:05:03] of Christ and it'll show all the good
[1:05:05] that we did all the bad's forgiven and
[1:05:08] the church said who shall lay any charge
[1:05:10] to God's elect amen no one there
[1:05:13] there'll be no one here to be able to
[1:05:14] say anything bad about you why because
[1:05:16] the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven
[1:05:18] you
[1:05:19] Hallelujah you're dressed in white amen
[1:05:22] ah you're unblamable without rebuke
[1:05:24] Hallelujah
[1:05:27] we'll all stand before the Judgment seat
[1:05:28] of Christ to receive what we've done in
[1:05:32] our bodies what have we done for Jesus
[1:05:34] Christ let's make our whole lives about
[1:05:36] Jesus Christ can we do that by the grace
[1:05:39] of God Amen remember there these are the
[1:05:42] three steps the Rapture is the
[1:05:44] ceremony right the marriage supper
[1:05:46] that's the reception where we get
[1:05:47] rewards communion presentation we come
[1:05:51] down here at the end of the battle of
[1:05:53] Armageddon Jesus Burns over the Earth
[1:05:55] with fire we walk out on the ashes of
[1:05:57] the wicked into the honeymoon the
[1:05:59] Thousand-Year Millennial Reign which
[1:06:01] brother Ram said is more important or
[1:06:04] more wonderful than we ever could have
[1:06:06] thought or imagined let's stand to our
[1:06:10] feet musicians could
[1:06:12] come so I just want to end with that
[1:06:14] here
[1:06:21] tonight I want to end with that tonight
[1:06:23] let's picture that in our minds that we
[1:06:25] we all will stand before the Judgment
[1:06:27] seat of
[1:06:28] Christ now we know the only
[1:06:31] way we could ever have only good is if
[1:06:33] the blood of Jesus Christ washed us
[1:06:36] clean
[1:06:37] Hallelujah so we're all trusting in that
[1:06:40] tonight but what we want to pray about
[1:06:42] as we close is Lord make help me to make
[1:06:45] every part of my life about
[1:06:49] you so I'm rewarded at the end of The
[1:06:52] Journey Hallelujah remember you can
[1:06:54] still be saved and but everything think
[1:06:56] about that we talked about that a few
[1:06:57] weeks ago everything in your whole life
[1:06:59] would be burned and just no rewards for
[1:07:01] anything because it was all about
[1:07:04] you but only what's done for others will
[1:07:08] last so let's look at our lives tonight
[1:07:12] let's make sure our lives are everything
[1:07:13] that we do is for other people by the
[1:07:16] grace of God let's bow our
[1:07:19] heads and remember there's going to be
[1:07:22] times in relationships where you're The
[1:07:24] Giver
[1:07:26] and the more you love the less you're
[1:07:29] loved but you must do it that proves
[1:07:32] you're a true child of God when you can
[1:07:35] love those that don't love you
[1:07:42] back so Mo uh friends Saints take a
[1:07:45] moment think about your life is there
[1:07:46] anything in your
[1:07:50] life may be questionable and you want to
[1:07:52] give it over to the Lord
[1:07:57] is there an area where you want to say
[1:07:59] Lord help me with this area of my life I
[1:08:02] want this area to glorify
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:05] you maybe there's a relationship it's
[1:08:07] harder because a person has
[1:08:10] changed they're not loving you back but
[1:08:12] you want to say tonight Lord help me to
[1:08:15] love the unlovable help me to be like St
[1:08:17] Paul which ultimately would be like you
[1:08:19] Heavenly Father you love those who don't
[1:08:22] love you
[1:08:23] back seems like the more I Tred to to be
[1:08:25] friendly the
[1:08:26] less I'm Lov

[1:08:31] strength to love the unlovable let's
