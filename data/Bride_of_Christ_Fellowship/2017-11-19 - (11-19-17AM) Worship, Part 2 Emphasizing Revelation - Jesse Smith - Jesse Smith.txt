everlasting covenant and no doubt will sing about the blood for all eternity hallelujah that you paid the price for our sins not only ours but for all men and all women or God we're grateful this morning take this word Lord break it to us now Lord Jesus minister to us by the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ sure say I'm a standard pickup I was here to Matthew 16 knows I was preparing this week yesterday I just kind of went back to that worship I was suddenly did last Sunday night and I just wanted to go a little bit further with that so I'd like to become worship part to it I just want to have a subtopic as I told it on my sake emphasizing revelation just want to preach on that this thing I want to emphasize revelation because the Prophet said you can never overemphasize revelation I can never preach on it too long well Jess you've been preached on this for a year I know I've been preached on the church ages for a year but I could start a message I could start a series on Revelation and preach to the rapture and I would not preach it too much because you cannot overemphasize how important it is to have revelation I think we'll see why here to today just since a few simple examples Lord just I felt directed me to as I prepared yesterday I wasn't thinking about these examples I just felt like the Lord directed me to them I'll try to be mindful the time as well try to preach just an hour because I know we have communion in I know the little kiddies get hungry and everything like that and I know I know the pregnant moms get hungry too so I know my wife and sister Naomi I know they they get hungry so of course because they're bringing forth life amen preparing that body of that soul amen so let's go to Matthew 16 13 through 19 will be our text Matthew 16 just so so familiar text but it's the text the Prophet uses in the church age book when he's when he makes a statement about you can never overemphasize Revelation so I want to just briefly read over that again and just make a few comments and we'll get to the bulk of the message you know we'll watch and see how the Holy Spirit Guides this you know my my desire my thought was to focus on Hannah and Abraham and Sarah this morning so we'll see how the Lord directs you know I always have my thoughts and I think this is the most important thing so we'll see what the Lord does this morning and how many know you're in control of the direction let me know that you're in control because you if you pull on God God will meet your need amen Matthew 16:13 for their say men I'll read 13 through 16 and then I'm sorry I read 13 to 17 and I think we'll all read 18 if that's okay so when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man him and they said someday say thou art to John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and she's answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven now let's read verse 18 together one two three and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now read verse 19 and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated so I want to take a subtopic of emphasizing revelation this morning because you can never overemphasize it so I just want to make a few comments and observations you know I was actually listening to a sermon from Donny Reagan and he went over some of these things and I was reading the church age book and and so I thought my I heard for both I had both the sources here so I had I to witnesses you know on that and so I want to just make a few comments on emphasizing revelation in this passage here Matthew 16 we know Simon Peter gives the right response he said the right thing praise God because he said thou art the Christ the Son of Living God most people that day didn't really believe he was the Christ they they were receiving miracles they were being blessed but they didn't really really believe he was that Messiah that was prophesied since the Garden of Eden they enjoyed the healings they enjoyed the revival atmospheres but they really didn't believe that he was what God said he was amen or what he claimed to be and so Peter had this special revelation or this special faith God had revealed to Peter that Jesus was indeed the Messiah the Christ and that's how it is today people like atmospheres of revival they like good feelings they like big groups and and signs wonders miracles we all like that Peter like that but Peter wanted all that the Messiah had amen he wanted the full Ministry of the Messiah not just a partial ministry of the Messiah and that's what we want today we're thankful when God heals and God saves and and so forth but we want all that the Messiah has for us today praise God because remember Jesus told Oum mber they picked it up in Acts chapter 3 let's go there I believe was Peter picked it up in Acts chapter 3 and he said that Christ was a the anti-type of Moses so let's go to Acts chapter 3 and all that dot did not hear Christ would be destroyed remember that in the scripture and so people want some of what Christ says but if they don't take all of it then there's a chance they might be destroyed right and God is only judged God is one who knows so let's go to verse 21 now acts 3:21 is our famous message Scripture it's the message of our day scripture which I love this is this the scripture is so beautiful whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution or restoration of all things so Paul's right there so heaven is going to hold the body of Jesus Christ until everything is restored back to the Apostolic Way praise the Lord somebody asked me on YouTube are you want to apostolic and everything like that and you part of that denomination I said absolutely not but I do hold the faith of the Apostolic fathers I'm not a part of that organization but I'm a part of the faith I'm preaching the same thing Paul preached amen I'm preaching the same thing Peter preached by God's grace hallelujah well see heaven must hold the body of Christ until everything's restore once everything's restored then Jesus can come right come back that's why we still believe there's power to be restored how many know that there are souls to be won there's work to be done we know there's still more restoration to come that's why our face should grow Church as we see that Day approaching amen because we know God will bring his true bride back to all that they were at the beginning amen that's why we don't get discouraged you if we go through a little cold times brother Branham said he and brother Neville would would join arm and arm there before Christ at the at the time when rewards are driven out he said we would stand there and be so happy that we stood for Christ in the hot and cold times amen how they know you're not so we are we're standing here amongst hot times a revival cold times of struggle and trial we stand here in the hot and cold knowing that there's a great reward to those who faithfully serve the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's exactly right and as we go there we know that the people of God are going to fall under the expectation of the hour they're gonna fall under the influence of the prophecy of this scripture that all things must be restored Christ will stay there until the restitution of all things and I'm part of the restitution of all the word amen we are a part of that amen so while the effects get more and more honest that doesn't discourage we just pressed through that and we look for God to do more in our lives amen because that's the time we're living in darker and darker more deception more deception but when as we gather in the house of God we get more and more truth amen now which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began now here we go for Moses truly said unto the father's a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in what all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and that's what makes us message believers and that's what makes everybody else foolish virgin who saved because the message believer the true believer in Christ wants to obey obey all the Word of God and they don't get to the spot where I've had enough well right I think I've done enough I think God's happy with me no they are constantly hungry for more and more righteousness because the Holy Spirit in them is hungry for more of the Word of God to be more like Jesus amen they want to obey all the word of Christ now 23 and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet didn't say that you know wouldn't not be healed or something like that you have to hear hallelujah you must hear shall be what destroyed from among the people the people loved to say oh jesus is son of God he's he's our salvation but they forget about this that you must hear everything the Prophet said two million people heard Moses but most of them were destroyed because they didn't go all the way showing they really didn't believe the Word of God but you and I are going all the way how do you know because we're gathering here in the name of Jesus Christ were receiving the Word of God we see God restoring his word to our lives amen it's exactly right hallelujah and while others fall away our hearts are distressed for them and as they flirt with the world we pray for them we we plead with them we do everything we can to try to bring them back but ultimately you and I will answer for ourselves amen and we know if we hunger and thirst we shall be filled we must be those that are part of that restitution amen that's our burden for our lives amen everybody has to make that decision for themselves are they gonna be lukewarm and said I have enough of God or are they gonna hunger for more and we want to be a part of the restitution amen so there you go that's that's that scripture right there and I want to just you see that is that a blessing to you sometimes we forget about those and the Holy Spirit brought that to me that was that was not my notes I was the Holy Spirit preaching that so see we must obey all that the law has for us amen now Jesus said let's go back to Matthew 16 here I want to just make a couple more comments on this before we move on he says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed unto thee but my father which is in heaven you know that ought to be our desires be able to look somebody in the face and say you know no no preacher talked me into being in the message my family member talked me into this the heavenly father revealed that this was the truth because even Jesus Jesus had not even I I'm not the one who gave this revelation God gave you this revelation and when we can locate the time of our life when the father revealed that and the father dropped that down it was no longer our effort or our I'm hanging on to my mom's testimony and she's gonna pull me through but when it became your testimony when the revelation became yours that's the moment the father gave you the revelation of this word amen it's not built upon your well about your previous pastor or for me my previous pastor that's not where the revelation is the revelation came from your heavenly pastor amen your heavenly father Jesus Christ amen and I thought I heard about Donnie say that really helped me out he said up upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it the word will which was showing that he Jesus Christ had not built the church yet I thought what a good thought I never I never really thought about debt because he started building his church on the day of Pentecost Laurie that was the birth of the church because now they're already called now they're called out amen and they're into the land right they got called out out of Egypt their to go through justification to the Red Sea sanctification wilderness but once they got in the land now they could say we are the called out ones because the redemption has been completed amen Redemption wasn't good when they got to the Red Sea it wasn't completing the wilderness they had to get in the Promised Land and get circumcised and then the redemption was complete amen and that's what we see Jesus saying I'm going to build my church I haven't built it yet and that's what we're saying today when we get filled with the Holy Ghost now we're a part of the church that Jesus is building amen and he's building it step by step with Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and he's finishing with you and I in the Laodicean Church age amen he's finishing building his church upon those who are filled with the holy spirit it's exactly right hey man and that just was a blessing to me he will build it and then he said the gates of Hell shall not prevail against that great that word gate in the Greek means councils did you know that hell has a council against you hell wants to destroy Adam Rigo hell wants to destroy Jesse Smith let me know that the Bible said the accusers of the Brethren accused you before the throne of God day and night they have plans to destroy your life they have plans to try to kill you to steal kill and destroy you but when you've got revelation those gates and councils of Satan cannot prevail against you amen they cannot pull you no man she'll be able to pluck them out of my father's hand amen the gates of Hell cannot prevail against the revelation that the father gave you that's why the father gave me that revelation amen so the gates of hell couldn't conquer against you you have nothing to fear as believers we've just got to remember and that our minds be stirred up by remembrance amen remember what you received remember where you came from remember whose side you're on remember where you got that revelation remember where you got the Holy Ghost amen and stand up on that word and believe it with all your heart amen exactly right it wasn't built upon Peter as the Prophet said because God couldn't build it upon a backsliding cussing preacher he couldn't build it upon that but he built it upon the Rock of Revelation the rock of faith amen now I that that faith that because faith means assurance so upon that assurance of thus saith the Lord amen now remember the word worship we looked at last Sunday means to kiss like a dog licking his master's hand to fall in her Crouch to to prostrate oneself is that how you came in today like like a dog would approaches master I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I'm here to praise you that's what worship is its cuts running to the one you want to worship and just pouring out your praise and adoration I hope that's how you came to the house of Lord this morning that's worship and that's a true worshiper and God is seeking someone that will worship Him in that manner so like my question that Sunday who's truly worship me I'm truly worshiping you're truly worshiping if you're coming to Christ wanting to kiss him wanting to bless him wanting to love him wanting everyone to know that you love Jesus and Jesus only exactly right and remember the Prophet said this I'm gonna read it from the worst sinner in the city 1956 the woman woman at Simon's house poured all the praise on him he said she didn't spare nothing she poured it all on him that's the way you got to come give him all the praise pour out all the glory on him did you know you have glory this morning you've got glory you got praise you've got feelings you've got emotions and he said you got to pour all your glory on Christ yeah lay everything down he said hallelujah that's why we can't have a revival it's because we're stingy with it our sister sang about revival this morning I thought that's so perfect we cannot have a riff we can't revive the life of God if we won't give God everything inside of our life amen right we got to give everything inside of us and then we can avert a vile because we got to pour all that he deserves all of our praise he deserves all of our worship and we all have glory that we must pour out upon him amen the Prophet said in all the days of our life I believe the Christian life is a continual sacrifice so see you have to learn to do that all every service week after week month after month let your life continually be a sacrifice he that come after me let him deny himself daily not every day not 46 days but every day take up his cross and follow me Christian life is one continually Lenten now lintons in the spring but he's taught he's kind of preaching on how they only sacrifice for forty some days instead of all year he said oh how the Christian loves to do it do you love to sacrifice do you love to not give your flesh what your flesh wants do you love to shut in with God and give God all your love in time the Christian loves to do it he doesn't do it with a grudge I guess I got to come to church alright I guess I got to fast I guess I better pray he said he does it with a feeling that he loves God and he's glad he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to worship the Lord it's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake it's a joy to take a stand for the right amen hallelujah and move against the wrong roof from the wrong he said it's a joy to praise him it's a joy to abstain from the things of the world now this is brother Branham it's not me it's brother Branham he says it's in their heart it's a perfect Lenten Lenten all the time God's Spirit comes into you and changes your desire a man beautiful thirsting for life in 1960 says it's my last one I move on if only men and women loved God as much as the world loves their pleasures the pleasure of a Christian brother man said is serving the Lord at the house of God and that's special to me because I'm a pastor I'm here every service and I love to see you here the pleasure of a Christian is serving the Lord at the house of God so if it's not a pleasure to come to church you got to check and see if you're backslidden or if you're not born again because this is the pleasure of a Christian you have to sign no cards he thought about the woman who signed to didn't have to sign a card to be down at the rock and roll concert you know because he was talking to a pastor and said well we put out a thousand invitations who will who will sign the card and say I'll be there every Sunday he said we got a couple of one or two cards back out of a thousand he said but a woman that loves rock and roll she don't have to sign her she don't have to sign a card the promise she'll be at the rock and roll concert that night he said because the love of rock and roll's in her and he said if only we could get the love of Christ and every believer Amen you want the sign of card he says you don't have to sign no cards you can't open the door quick enough I thought about that church door out there that church door out there we can't open it quick enough the Prophet says and if the members of the church love one another enough instead of a put up a little clicks and pulling away from the church brother if you love one another so much that it just hurts your heart until you got to get together again that's the way it should be I love those and I'm so glad they're not my words they're the prophets words hallelujah now let's go a little bit further let me read this quote now emphasizing revelation now I want to get to this stuff this is in page 13 of the church age book I preached us I think maybe last year now listen the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized I can never put too much emphasis on you must receive revelation you've got to receive the word you've got to have faith every see that you've got to receive faith I've got to receive faith I could never overemphasize that and he says revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize how many can say amen to that now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation in you he's not talk about just the book of Revelation he says I'm talking about all Revelation let's say already all revelation I'm talking about all revelation it can never be overemphasized it is tremendously important to the church do you remember Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples the question of course we just read it the Roman like say the church is built upon Peter and that's really carnal how could God build the church upon a man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it God doesn't notice Church upon unstable things he builds it upon stable firm things and the only firm thing we have is the Word of God that's what he builds his church upon it wasn't Peter unstable its upon the word upon Christ God can't build his church upon any man born in sin aren't you glad our church doesn't build upon brother branham aren't you glad it's not built upon John Wesley or Martin Luther they're all men they have sinned they could be unstable at times but the church is built upon the Word of God amen Jesus Christ and it wasn't some rock laying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the revelation he says of who Jesus was flesh and blood hath not revealed it but my father a tribunal and upon this rock revelation I will build my church the church is built upon revelation on the thus saith the Lord so now we know what revelation is it's thus saith the Lord from the Bible and that was one of the things the churches that when they voted out brother Stephen they didn't even believe women shouldn't cut their hair the end and the brother brother said he pointed them to the Word of God not to us we look at first Corinthians 11 and that's thus saith the Lord to us I'm not gonna let my hair grow up and put it in braids and dreadlocks and try to be like some of these other guys you know I'm not gonna do that because the word says it's a shame for men have long hair just as a shame for a man or a woman to be shorn if she's shorter trim she might as well be shaving the Bible says and so see to to certain people these words are not thus saith the Lord but to a woman or man who really believes the word and gods revealed that that's the word it's a revelation to that it's now saith the Lord and if God tells him something and it straight from God they're gonna obey and because they're filled with God's love to see those things you see when people struggle with these things they never had the revelation they never I really thought it was the say at the Lord to begin with aren't you glad you know is the say the Lord hey man remember Bram said thus saith the Lord of woman cuts her hair I don't care how much he dances and sings she's not born again she's dead and I'm dead too the holy ghost dead too being born in the soul because that's what the Word of God teaches us the Prophet said how did Abel know what to do in order to offer proper sacrifice to God by faith he received the revelation of the blood oh wow hallelujah the revelation of the blood Abel had a revelation of the blood of the Lamb God let him know that you got to bring the blood of an innocent humble spotless pure creature that's the only sacrifice I'll accept for your sins and God revealed that to him - Abel it wasn't like oh I guess I better go get my lamb - Abel it was I love to get the lamb because God revealed to me that's the only way he'll forgive me that's the only way to fellowship with God is through the bloody lamb don't you appreciate that amen that's what Abel had he knew what properly sacrificed to God but he said Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so Cain had the commandment but it never became a revelation see how that you can hear the preaching can hear the commands you can hear him hear him here but until they become yours until the father lets it drop down in your heart it's not really a revelation to you and so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice came because it never became a revelation it never became a faith like all this is God he thought of just rules you got to go through rules gotta grudgingly do this okay okay and he compromise on it he said it was revelation from God that made the difference and gave abel eternal life you might take what the pastor says or what the seminary teachers and though it might be taught to you with eloquence until God reveals it to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your Savior you will never have eternal life amen did everybody see Wednesday when I put that Eve Angie came up there did anybody get to watch it you get to watch it okay it's just this little cube it's a cardboard cube with pictures on it and it has seven steps of the gospel and you might think that's pretty carnal but Church the first time I started teaching that to the children I started crying and the other kids are just like you know that's pretty cool yeah and you know we've got to be careful that the gospel doesn't lose its personal value I'm a grown man I'm 37 now almost 40 I'm a grown man and I can look at little cartoons of Jesus dying on the cross and it makes me cry makes me weep because I so appreciate what Christ has done because it wasn't a pastor that put that in my heart it wasn't my life it wasn't my brother it was the Heavenly Father who revealed to me that Jesus died for me amen and I'm saved by the grace of God I am a new creature I'm not the old person I'm a new creature all things are become new let me say it again all things all my life has become new praise God part of my life shouldn't feel old and new part of my life should feel new in Christ they knew it yeah it does amen but that's what we're talking about when it becomes a personal revelation to you the spiritual revelation said it's the spiritual revelation that does it all right now we know the scripture go to Romans chapter 10 I want to spend a little bit this is my main direction I thought like I like to go by God's grace revelation 10 revelation 10 revelation 10 about faith cometh by hearing let's just read over that again now if you know verses eight down to 15 God God tells Paul that this is how you become a Christian you cannot heat you cannot believe unless you hear a preacher there's another way to receive salvation you've got to believe the word that's being preached and then faith comes by hearing that's the context now look at verse 16 after how blessed are the beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel verse 16 for they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God verse 18 but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world but I say did not Israel know first Moses say that I will provoke you to jealousy by them you if all day long have I stretched forth my hands unto disobedient and gainsaying people what a thought the gospel revelation only comes when you hear a preacher and believe the Word of God if you can accept that word and you don't accept that word then the Bible says right here it's a spirit of unbelief praise God and it can be in any service they don't have to be just when you're not saved it can be when you're saved it can be when you've been called out like Israel they come out of Egypt but when they heard it then they stopped believing it they stopped moving on with God we must keep moving on with God it's so important faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God amen we should receive some precious portion of faith this morning amen we should receive some revelation some thus saith the Lord some word to us we should receive something this morning that's why we gather so the gifts of God can minister to us and raise our faith to another level amen absolutely and that's what will overcome the gates of Hell the counsels of hell that are against you and I hallelujah it only comes by hearing the Word of God now the Prophet tells us how to get in the spirit in order to hear from the spirit because revelation 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet he was in the spirit and he heard the voice of the Lord talking behind him and he had a turn look at the voice hallelujah and the voice was a person it came from a person Jesus Christ the Prophet says he said I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful you could call those words the whole of the Christian life I read this last year but listen again when someone says I'm walking the spirit they have they have placed themselves in the most important place they could possibly you understand what forgive me if I'm not saying the right way when you're when you can say I'm walking the Holy Spirit this morning brother Jesse when you can say that you know you're in the perfect will of God the whole of the Christian life that is the whole purpose of the Christian life is to say I'm walking in the spirit right now I'm not following the things of the flesh I'm walking I'm led by the Holy Ghost right now when you can say that you have reached the perfect will of God and the importance of that can never be overemphasized so many people are just content to walk in the permissive will of God but if you're not careful the permissive will of God often leads names to be blotted off the book like Balaam like Judas when they get comfortable and the perfect permissive will of God we cannot walk in the permissive will of God very long we've got to say God forgive me and let me go back to the place where I left you because we know there's cases in Abraham member there's cases he was in the perfect will of God and he stepped out and went down to Egypt you remember that what do you have to do we had to come right back to where he left God praise the Lord and only then could he say now I'm in the perfect will of God now walking the spirit before he wasn't and see people will spend weeks years decades in the permissive will of God but they need to go back to where they left the word where they're stopped obeying the commands go back there and when they get there they can say now I'm in the spirit on the Lord's Day amen they're not in the spirit until they repent of their sins and get back to where they left Christ exactly right that is the whole of the Christian life so that is the the goal the Christian life is to say I'm in the spirit I'm not disobeying any word I'm in the spirit on the Lord's Day if we're gonna live as Christians we have to be in a spirit the Prophet said it has to be the Spirit of God with us - or all of our efforts in vain Paul said I'll pray in the spirit I'll sing in the spirit I'll live in the spirit if there's anything good that will come - Jesse Smith it has to be revealed by the Holy Spirit he said confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results that it bears amen that's why we should rejoice when we get results from praying for the sick get results from preaching or results from people being blessed or saved or delivered that's why we're here e joyce because we can look back and say i was in the spirit amen i was not walking by the flesh i was in the spirit on the lord's day i was doing the whole desire i was in the perfect will of God I did all that God wanted me to do I was walking in the spirit and that can never be overemphasized are you walking the spirit are you walking in the permissive will of God the Prophet said as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by his word for it is the same spirit and then he quotes acts 2:38 repent be baptized and you shall be through what the Holy Ghost he said why don't people get filled only ghosts because they don't get in the spirit of the scripture first if you got in the spirit nobody said you would repent of all your sins you would live a sanctified life and then the Holy Ghost would fill you so they don't get in the spirit how many times have we seen that how many people we baptized that we think they're in the spirit I talked to them and they can answer every question correctly yes I've repented yes and then you baptize them there stay there alive for a few weeks or months or whatever and then pretty soon they fall away see they never had the revelation of repentance in the first place they never did for those of us who have we had it I got it I got it from Jesus amen I got it from the Heavenly Father he did reveal to me and now my life is totally different because I'm walking in the spirit now glory hallelujah program said they never got in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says he said pray to God for revelation by his Spirit that is the first step get in the spirit what is the first step to walk in the spirit pray until you get in the spirit of the scripture he says to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do so what's the first step if if I'm emphasizing revelation what's the first step for revelation prayer prayer reflection examining your life which we have communion in a few minutes here let me set a timer I'll go half give me half an hour more but it's only 12:10 here examining your life am I in the permissive will am i down in Egypt or am I in the promised land am i sacrificing at the right altar am am I where God wants me to be hallelujah and I know I am like my own personal testimony I've asked God if you want me to go for me leave Akron you know open doors you want me to stay give me do these in these signs and gods always give me the sign so I can stand there like Guinean I know where I'm supposed to be I know I'm in the perfect will of God but it has to be a revelation it has to be revealed to you and we've got to get in the spirit of Prayer so once we're in the spirit of prayer the Holy Spirit can reveal to us the thus saith the Lord for you and I it's quite quite plain Roger just want to bring these out again and I can never overemphasize this I'm gonna keep saying that I can never preach too long on this that you and I need to get in the spirit and pray for the revelation of God for thus saith the Lord and then God will start doing things now aren't you glad for the things he has done I'm not taking away from what he's done the past but we're all looking what's he gonna do in 2018 right if he tarries what's gonna do this year we're thankful what he did last year what is the next year hold we're all looking toward that and the way we prepare for is to clean out our lives getting the perfect will of God get in the spirit then things will begin to happen I'll some roast even last night I said this last year has been a very difficult year and there's different things that have happened that really discouraged me in different things I don't understand I said this last year God has really raised up my children to really be a strength and encouragement for me so in the midst of the trial the midst of the storm there's always light in the midst of the cloud I think there's a scripture in Psalms about that there's always light in there God God always puts a little blessing in there if you're willing to go through the storm so we must get in the spirit prayer is the first step to getting in the spirit now I have three examples of this I preached them over you know I preached them a couple times I think but let's go through let's go to Joshua 6 verse 1 the first example of this prayer before the word the prayer has to come before the word is even preached that's why you should pray before you even read your chapter in the morning or chapter night we should pray before that say God opened this up if you just got a few moments God opened this up to me speak to me and church this is something I didn't get to but the Bible says there's something called the supply of the spirit he said his gift would supply the spirit for the people in other words you have a supply of the anointing on you never say amen to that you have some anointing on you but Paul says when the gifts of God in operation he said walk he said be filled with the spirit but don't be filled drunk on wine but be filled with the spirit and he's talking about not just her so he's talking about in your human mind the gifts of God will supply the amount of Holy Ghost anointing you need in your mind in your thoughts and how many know this is the greatest battle ever fall in your mind and this is the time to feel like our minds are being attacked more than ever but this is the time when we need to supply the spirit in our thinking and in our minds if we're gonna overcome if we're gonna be conquerors in this label to see an hour if we're going to get revelation if we're going to enjoy the preaching of the word if we're gonna fulfill that scripture that faith cometh by hearing the word of church don't you want to leave church and say God spoke to me today well there's the first step you got to do is pray in the spirit that's the first step Robert says it you must pray in the spirit first before the word is even preached that's the power of prayer and that's why we got to have a praying Church the Prophet said don't want to be a praying Church that prays the blessings down and I said yes my heart my heart says yes and I'm helping God's helping me bring my whole face and I in this objection to that that that that command absolutely Joshua chapter six now these are the instructions here now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel verse one none went out and unque min and the Lord said unto Joshua see I've given into thine hand Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor and you shall compass the city all men of all ye men of war and go round about the city once thou shalt thou do six days the seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day he shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it should come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall send up every man straight before him so see God is prophetic God tells them what's going to happen if you obey the word the deliverance is coming that's what it is for us if we the obey this word this morning the victory is coming that's exactly right and Joshua the son of nun called the priests and send them take up the Ark of the Covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the Lord so see that the priests with the music went before the word how many understand that verse seven they said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let him that's armed pass on before the Ark of the Lord so we have armed soldiers with weapons plus priests with trumpets that go before the Ark I preach us when I preached on the the full armor of God if you remember verse eight and it came to pass when Josh had spoken on the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the Lord and blue with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord follow them now verse nine is this is the point I want to make and the armed men went before the priests that blue with the trumpets and the reward came after the Ark the priests going on and the blowing of the trumpet so you have armed priests with swords first then you have priests with horns with trumpets then you have the ark then you have more priests with horns because you have a rear award yeah so the word is right in the middle but you've got soldiers fighting before that you've got singing going before the word then you've got the word then you've got singing after the word sounds like a good Holy Ghost service to me Church right this is the pattern was he so often we forget that the armed men were before the songs and the armed men we know represent those who had the full armor of God and I go to Ephesians 6 just quickly remember that we don't want to forget that Church I'm trying to stir up your minds by way of remembrance if we want revelation our church my God spoke to us at church today we've got to get in the spirit first vision 6 there's no other way and there's and if you really think about it no wonder the prophets said we must pray for revelation more than anything else what do you and I need more than a personal thus saith the Lord that's all we need like that's all I need I just needed a thus saith the Lord that I'm supposed to be an Akron I can be happy am I gonna struggle time sure am I gonna here have mine battles of course but once God gives me a sign or thus saith the Lord that I can let my life just fall into line with whatever he allows amen and just trust his word because I'm not basing upon my thoughts but I'm basing up on what he's revealed to me for me in His Holy Word amen on the state the Lord feeding 6 now remember we have to go through all these but we're not wrestling against flesh and blood not wrestling against the people here at the church you know make believers here in our church or because you have you have three kinds every Church I'm not wrestling against that I'm not wrestling against you know anyone that speaks bad about me I'm not wrestling against that it's the spiritual wickedness behind it but remember I'm all these principalities powers all these things will not prevail against you and I Amen it's impossible the gates and councils the principalities hell should not prevail against you and I Amen but we will prevail over satan's attempts to thwart out our lives and to discourage us and to steal from us and to kill us we overcome by the revelation of God and hallelujah and we will stand like he says in 13 will stand holding forth the word of life yes sir so see you have your loins Girt about with truth your belt the blessed or the breastplate sari of righteousness your heart is covered with the right I'm doing what's right I have the righteousness of Christ my feet are shod my feet are protected every step I take is protected in Christ amen hallelujah I know where I'm walking I don't walk in the path of evil I walk into the Word of God and they're protected by the Holy Spirit my steps are all guided by the Holy Spirit and above all I have the shield of faith the shield of Revelation that's what protects me the revelation of the hour that protects me against all the fiery darts of Satan's lies what about this and what about brother Bram said this and what about Jesus didn't exist all these things my revelation of him extinguishes all those darts they just fizzle out they just fall right before me I don't even consider that why because the father showed me he's alive the father showed me he's the Messiah the father showed me he's the son of man for this hour the father showed me that I didn't ask for that God gave that to me amen now look and the helmet of salvation I know I'm saved right I'm my head is protected I'm saved and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God now look at verse 18 praying always so a good soldier will constantly pray a member prayer prayer warriors went before even the word prayer warriors go first then the song ministry then the Word of God I'm going to say lord help me be a prayer warrior that's what I want to be a prayer warrior praying with all prayer let's see all kinds of prayers whether it's just blessing the Lord whether it's supplications which are special requests no matter what kind of prayer it is we pray always with all prayers supplication the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints that's why we pray for the family in Ghana right pray for All Saints okay that's the first example the Prophet said if you want revelation he said pray first that's the first example prayer warriors full armors of God they go first before the word even comes can anybody see that okay second one now hope I got a whole I got a whole sermon on this one but I've got to be mindful forgive me I got to be mindful the time here I'd I might just preach that was separate but let me just go to this one let's go to Exodus please Exodus I believe it's 25 I'm scrolling here cuz I got a skip I feel like I got a skip a little bit that's access 27 forgive me forgive me and this is beautiful because this one ties it with Hannah this is beautiful oh you got I hope you enjoyed this this really blessed my heart yesterday it just kind of the thought just came mine that's just like Hannah X is 27 20 so see prayer always comes before thus saith the Lord prayer you've got to get in the spirit or else God's Word is going to take any effect XS 27 20 and thou shall command the children Israel that they bring thee pure olive oil beaten for light to cause the lamp to burn always in the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil which is before the testimony Aaron and son shall order from evening the morning before the Lord it should be a statute forever unto their generations on behalf of the children of Israel now remember in the holy place there was three things there was altar of incense the shewbread and the lamp stand so the priests couldn't do their work they couldn't serve God in the holy place and they couldn't go in the Holies of Holies without the oil that the people brought and oil represents the properties cameras preacher a few weeks ago we know it oil represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the people have to bring their token the people have to bring eternal life with them the people have to bring the Holy Spirit with them if the people bring the holy spirit then the priest can order the service the right way but the people all of us including me my wife my family we've all got to bring oil to the house of God and notice it was pure like our heart should be pure before God in other words you got to filter out that oil hot in India and gods word is always his filter amen God's Word is the thinking man's filter so before you come to church before you come to see God move our all of our all of our lives must be filtered through the Word of God pure word pure lives perfect will of God or else there's gonna be no light in this holy place you understand and it had to be beaten there to take those olives and they had to beat it some of them you know just if everybody brought a little bit they'd have little bowls there they just beat it they just beat it and smash it and smash it down until all the oil came out it had to be beaten and this was very expensive oil according to this historian matthew henry said that this was the very expensive oil pure oil was the most expensive so it's going to take the biggest sacrifice for you to have a pure life right for your oil is shine it's going to take the biggest sacrifice it's gonna be the most expensive thing it has to be the most important thing for you and I to bring pure oil before God and it had to be beaten pounded pounded pounded pounded there and I'll say like this your life has to be pound you got to pound out the sin out of our lives glory day after day pound out say God take this from me God deliver me God purify my heart take this temptation away it's got to be beaten and pounded lord help me to endure this temptation help me to go through help me not to give up give me strength as you pound out my life let me manifest your love amen let me bring up your heart to the house of God and then the ministers can work with the light because the oil has been brought by the people Oh hallelujah glory so it's got to be the burden of the people too the Holy Spirit beat out grind out the the trials of your life so you can bring forth a pure life to the house of God that's the second one the third one this is the one I have about four pages of quotes on so I'm not gonna be able to preach this and I'm at the pre just on another time and a separate sermon but go to Matthew here 21 Matthew 21 7 now given you two witnesses that the prayer and the Holy Ghost prayer always comes before the word okay before they could get the holiest of Holies the people had to be praying bring an oil before Joshua brought the word the armed man with with with swords of faith right I'm sorry swords of the word and shields of faith they had to come before the singers and before the Word of God and now Matthew 21 7 how many want to see prophecy fulfilled in our day I don't want to see that how many want to be a part of the good prophecy I do too Matthew 21 7 this scripture is all about prophecy being fulfilled in their day let's see the people let's see what the people were doing who were part of the good part of the prophecy there were people that didn't like this and they were the bad part of the prophecy but there's people that were the good part of the prophecy amen and brought the ass and the cult and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and this is of course Jesus coming in on Good Friday I'm sorry not Good Friday Palm Sunday and the multitudes that went before that followed cried saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh the name of Lord hosanna in the highest does everybody see that here's the word riding a beast right riding a power into the city that's going to ultimately reject him but you had singers before and singers after just like Joshua Amen singers before the word singers after the word but before even the singers what were the people doing they were throwing their palms down to the ground they were throwing their clothes down to the ground all that I have all my all my ability all my covering I throw it down everything that's clothing me or these things of course there they had other clothes but they were throwing their their garments my garments are not worthy my my palms are not worthy and all this had to happen before the singing and before the word came palms had to hit the ground in church if we could have some palms hit this altar if we could have palms hits the ground in your prayer closet then we'll see the word come and we'll see the word fulfilled the prophecy fulfilled in this our glory palms fell first and if we could put our faces falling down to the ground and pray and seek God then we'll see God's work fulfilled in our lives it's the pattern I just given you three examples and I that's all the time I had to study was those three and I could go down through the quotes I'm not going to today because of communion what was the attraction on the mountain the Prophet said God fulfilling his word glory and so the palms had to fall the clothes had to fall all of our works had to go we had to sacrifice everything then the praise has come then the word comes then more praise has come that sounds like I said a good Holy Ghost service amen hallelujah the praise is we want to sing praises he deserves to be praised today they came with palms of trees and we come with palms a praise hands praising him faces down worshiping the Lord there's a special connection the Jews at the first coming had palms that they threw down but the Gentiles brother Bram says after the rapture the Gentiles in Revelation 7 the Bible said our waving palms in heaven because the king has come to the Gentiles when the King first came to the Jews they threw down their palms they rejected him but at the rapture Jesus catches his bride away and they rejoice with palms because they receive the Messiah hey man beautiful I thought I was powerful the Gentiles show the palms after a second coming hallelujah they received him the Jews rejected him but both times God was going to bring forth palms of praise palms of worship sacrifices of praise and number all the preachers got upset they said tell these children the children were running around the temple saying Jesus is Messiah Hosanna the king of David's come the children were worshipping God that's what we need we need children that are filled with the Holy Ghost amen we need adult says that her Philip the Holy Ghost run around singing to save us that's what Hosanna means save us deliver us minister to us and that's exactly what Jesus did on that day amen Jesus came and saved them the next week on the cross hallelujah on Gau gothis hill they said save us and Jesus said I will praise God then they rejected him but he went to a people that didn't know he was coming the Gentiles and they'll sing with palms as well they'll say Hosanna hallelujah blessed is he that came in the name of the Lord exactly right that's beautiful I don't know if you ever saw this but Hosanna was actually from the Book of Psalms do you ever know that Psalms 118 let's read a I think you might be blessed by that so I was one 1825 Hosanna means save now right now see something urgent Hosanna something urgent save us right now in other words he says save we beseech you we plead with you we beg you and jesus said these are the cheerin he said I can't shut up these children if the children are shut up the rocks will cry out that means all of heaven was wanting to be saved amen all of heaven was wanting to be redeemed amen save us if the children would not a shot of that the rocks would have cried out said save us we beseech thee plead with us God let your blood be shed for our sins because we're desperately wicked sinners we need new hearts we need a news spirit and we need your spirit oh the rocks would have cried out because the tremble when Jesus died amen and the creatures of God are groaning now for the manifestation of the sons of God ha ha hallelujah well I'm gonna have a hard time having a voice tomorrow what's a good thing there's only three days of school this week hallelujah thank God for that let's read Psalms 118:25 just forgot all about that help me Jesus well one thing I know is I'm giving all I got to Jesus first I'm just pouring out all my praise to Christ today I'm just gonna pour it all out to him god help me to be more mindful and when I can so I'm 118:25 saved now I beseech thee O Lord oh lord I beseech thee send now prosperity how many want the prosperity of God I'm not talking about prosperity preaching even if I get poor financially I can still get richer spiritually there are seasons of our lives or seasons brother Bram's life we had more money more support and a dwindled toward the end it looked like he was defeated but he was a victor in Christ he was an overcomer because he stayed true to the Word of God same thing we must be but look what he's saying he says it twice that's where they were shouting Hosanna save us son of David save us save us that was God fulfilling prophecy God wanted people shouting save me save me save me and so God anointed some children and some adults to throw down their palms and say save us save us and only elect caught the revelation of that hour that this is the son of David amen this is the Messiah and he's coming to be a lamb he's coming to be sacrificed that you and I might be saved hey man glory Jesus love that God loved that Jesus I'm not gonna make them shut up let them shout save me let them cry out to me that's what babies do when they need something they cry out amen and this is where it came from this is the scripture save us now if you look at the Greek or the Hebrew words you can put them together and it says Hosanna now it sounds different in Hebrew but I put them together it's like host Shawn na or something like that if you put those two words this is Hosanna save us Jesus save us Jesus how many would say Hosanna today amen I say that they save us from Laodicea save us come quickly Lord Jesus amen so see that the branches were done first the clothes were laid first the sacrifice went first then came the singers then came the word then came more singing can every see how it's the perfect perfectly scriptural all right now let me finish here I think I just maybe yeah I'll just have to do this so now we have three clear examples from the Word of God let's go to First Samuel chapter one now my clock I got five minutes I just wish you had more time I don't want to go too long like I said I know I know there's things to do first say I'm a chapter one now for this church you've got to read read between the lines a little bit if you read between the lines you'll see exactly and I'm gonna read a quote after this so read the scripture first and read the quote and watch and see what the what the prophet of God pulls out by the Holy Spirit from this sermon called faith cometh by hearing 1954 I really want to go through I just listened to I just read the first maybe twenty minutes of this I didn't even check the time but I'm gonna go through all the examples he gives in here because he gives a beautiful example of Abraham Sarah and Hannah as faith comes by hearing hearing by the Word of God so revelation comes by hearing the preaching but not after you pray in the spirit first you have to get in the spirit first praise God then comes the word then comes us to the Lord then you thank God for the word that you heard afterwards and you worship and thank him so first name in Chapter 1 now we know the scripture we know Elkanah had two wives in verses 1 and 2 she had no children it's interesting in verse 3 God shut up her womb I'm sure that was verse 5 God did it God allowed her to be barren so she could manifest this attribute of God the attribute of hearing the word and believing Oh Jess why is my life like this brother Jesse you know why is well God did it so you could manifest a specific attribute of God to glorify God can you imagine and the Bible never said no the Bible said God shut it up it wasn't like you know Hannah was bad as a girl you know you're not going to have children it wasn't like that it was God that did it God knew what was in Hannah's life God knew Hannah's desires and see your trials bring out your desires glory your trial will show when you get down that trial you'll find out what you really desire in life that's why I'm people go through trials and they pull away from God and pull away from the message and bow away from the word it shows their desires were wrong in the first place but God allows to try on your life to manifest either what manifests what's in there whether it's the seat of God or whether it's not your try will show your desires remember they went up yearly to sacrifice look at verse 5 but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion that's talking about Elkanah for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb and I like that one thing about Hannah although her husband loved her the most that wasn't the greatest desire of her heart she wanted to be loved by God most like we can't we should be happy if people love us you know we should be happy but really we shouldn't want things from God more we should want God's love and God's will more than we want human attention human affection she could not say well God you didn't give me a husband that loved me she couldn't say that her husband loved her more than her his other heart wife but see that was enough for her she wanted God's will for her life more than everything that's what you and I need to remember above all things we want God's will we want God's will to be done more than everything else now look at that not here's here's the part verse 6 and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb oh you're just some barren woman God doesn't love you you're no good what kind of wife are you yeah okay I loves you more than me but I born him children you haven't done nothing for the kingdom of God you haven't brought forth any children for the kingdom of God and this vector what was the church it was the beating of the oil day after day after day this other wife would beat down and what did it produce and produce a pure godly desire going up to the house of God in a man beating after beating after beating after beating after day after day all the pressure oh your failure you never do anything for God you can never produce an offspring you can never produce the son hallelujah and that's what Satan tells us but we are producing the son amen Christ no matter how much pounding we got to bring forth these trials are gonna show that we want to bring forth the Son of God amen there is in Christ in our lives hallelujah it's got to be beaten oil it's got to be pure it's got to be pure holy ghost oil pure holy ghost word of god desire you understand I'm just throwing words in there that's what it is it's the perfect will of God we desire God's will year by year verse seven they did this every year and so she provoked her and verse seven therefore she wept and did not eat so now it comes down to fasting time I'm so hungry for God's will that I'm not gonna eat anything because I'm hungrier for the Word of God o God help us to be there I'm more hungry to hear God's Word then eat natural food and there's my time so give me a couple more minutes I'll set five minutes more now look at verse nine so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk naughty lie the priests at upon a seat by the post of the temple of the Lord now look she gets to watch her whole family she gets to watch her adversary eat there and like the Bible said you'll set the table before in the presence of your enemies look at that my goodness it just struck me right there she's watching all them eat and she's just eating on the Word of God I know God's gonna answer me I'm going to the house of God expecting I've got a pure heart hallelujah I'm seeking God I need the Word of God so she was feasting on the word in the presence of her enemies of our enemies were eating the food I've had that before I fasted where there were some of the best foods out in front of me I wasn't even hungry for them I mean they smell good but I was more hungry to do God's will and I'm talking good Mexican food I was talking about and I'm Mexican half of at least and when you're under the anointing of God and you've been beaten down all those times and you really want the will of God there's no temptation Satan can lay before you that won't be easy to turn down because you're walking in the spirit you're not walking the flesh now look at verse 10 and she was in bitterness of the soul and praying to the Lord and wept sore see that's how bad she wanted this desire God did this to her to bring out what was really on the inside and she vowed to violence and O Lord of Hosts if I would indeed look upon the affliction my handmaiden me and not forget nine handmade but will give unto me thine handmaid a man-child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head and it came to pass her she continued praying over the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken cuz he was so drunk of the Holy Ghost right this is where we get it right here she was so praying so desperate so sincere fast and she looked she looked drunk and that's what they had the day of Pentecost new wine Amen I don't know yeah because they're in prayer but prayer came first before the word we can never overemphasize the importance of revelation it comes by praying first I love what he says here Eli said there how wilt thou be drunken put away that wine from these that shows how he was back slidden he wasn't here under the anointing he couldn't catch that she was under the anointing you're just drunk and she could have said you're right I am drunk on the Holy Ghost I'm so filled with the Holy Ghost right now I brought pure oil to the house of God and Hannah said an answer said oh no my lord I'm a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but I poured out my soul before the Lord count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial for out of abundance of my complaint in grief have I spoken there too then I answered and said go in peace and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou has asked of him and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight and the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad so what changed her the word of the priest in the temple was what changed her but God had to bring her through prayer through poundings through beatings God had to bring her through years and years of disappointment at the house of God beating after biddy and she finally receives the revelation for her life she finally receives the Word of God for life after years of being beaten down she hears it through the priest in the temple so the revelation doesn't come until the prayer has gone the praises have gone and then the Word of God came us and our feet the next verse I'm skipping down a little bit but it says they return and eat Elkanah knew his wife port the son that got allowed this to come to pass their life to produce a desperation to show all of us what desperation in prayer really produces what years of trials I love morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning morning your whole life revolves around this testimony this Word of God do you feel that sometimes I feel like that like there's just a word of God there's like just prophesies circling he's ever anybody ever feel like that like something do you feel like that brother Adam like something's gonna happen like I just feel God wants to move there's just something about my life I'm not here for no purpose I'm here to fulfill God's prophecy I don't always know what it's about I believe it's tied to the rapture though I believe that because of all the prophets taught us and if I don't go in the rapture and I got to go to the grave first and then I go in the rapture it doesn't matter but I feel like there's just prophecy surrounding Scot is gonna move there is more to come there's something I must do but I must go through year after year after the beating the pounding and one of these old days you and I are gonna get in the spirit and God is gonna bring his word to pass in our lives not just a maybe a hope it's a dust sayeth the Lord how's it gonna happen first you got to pray got a beat in pure oil gonna have a pure life beaten down through years of trials years molded shame then she brought this oil to the house of God she brought this desire this Holy Ghost full desire pray got in the spirit of prayer she hears the Word of God and brother Branham said faith came by hearing hearing by the Word of God the Librium said as she was praying eli stomped out and said woman will you always be drunk on strong drink and she said my lord I'm not drunk on strong drink but I'm praying that the Lord take away my reproach and he said the Lord grant it to you he said the Lord bless thee and that's all she wanted to know there was God's priests God priests had pronounced the blessing on her and she was at the house of God amen thank you Jesus amen he said God put could have put a baby right in her arms if he wanted to but he has a way of doing things it don't make any difference whether it happened there or not she had God's word so sunk in her heart that faith came by hearing hearing by the Word of God she accepted it right then and went home or joy seing how we ought to do that too if something that struck our heart we ought to go home rejoicing and say hallelujah God's Word spoke to me at the house of God I've received what I've asked for amen praise God they're gonna have the baby nine months later little Samuels born why because she took God at his words she believed faith comes by hearing hearing by the Word of God he loved the Lord Church Holly let's go to Luke chapter 22 let's get ready for a communion I'm sorry I went over a little bit and ask God to forgive me I don't want to tax my voice but I just forgot all about its got under this anointing of preaching I love this anointing of preaching I feel like Samson up here yeah I feel like I feel like everybody could believe if every just believe we could all have receive what we have need of today that's what I feel like when I forget about these things and just preach God's Word is so simple faith comes by hearing help me to hear by God's grace help me to hear the Word of God Luke 22 and God richly bless you have you sat through the sermon and pulled upon the word God richly bless you this is God's way to do it how beautiful are the feet of them that bring the gospel a good piece and then faith comes by hearing hearing the Word of God you sat to hear the Word of God may God bless you Luke 22 14 you know we usually read first Corinthians 11 but today I wanted to read this one okay alright 14 when the hours come he sat down in the 12 apostles with him and he sent unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer in that beautiful Jesus said I've just desired it so much I just want to sit down with my people my apostles I just want to sit down with my closest friends I don't have one more meal with you before I go for I say unto you I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God this is my final meal it's the final time I'm gonna eat with this corporal body and I want to have it with my closest friends I've desired this now if he was desiring with them how about desiring communion with us today and he took the up and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I saying you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come and he took the bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this too and remember to me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he has betrayed and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing let's bow our heads in word of Prayer here now let's just examine ourselves just for a moment but Loras if you could come to the piano and just play that song sister when he's saying search me O God and know my heart today try me o Savior you know one thing we know about this portion Judas really didn't stop to examine his life church but the rest of the eleven did if we'll examine our lives today we know we can be pure before him we've got to examine and say am i bringing forth purity to the house of God am i taking this communion in purity but in your Lord's flowing the faith just felt such a freedom to preach it wasn't hard at all thank you for the faith that you give your people work out faith comes by hearing you've heard the word this morning I've received it this morning I'm falling under the prophecy of this I don't know when like Hannah I don't know when Lord I believe if you do a quick mighty work as your prophet said we don't know how many years it'll be we don't know how long nor one thing we're interested in is your revelation shaping our lives shaving are tested and I had a wonderful testimony she wanted to bring forth the son who would be a priest who would always be a church or that's our desire that we could bring forth a life of Christ that will always keep us in church keeping us in the house of God keeping us in the love of God bringing more Souls to the house of God finishing the Great Commission north we often say that milord our heart is so pure towards that statement we want to finish the Great Commission for
