[11:19] grace also there's a friend I have just
[11:22] through you know texting he's from
[11:23] Canada he goes to a message Church his
[11:25] name is Brother Ray and he needs prayer
[11:28] for uh some documents I think he moved

[11:34] country and he wants I think he wants to
[11:36] have permanent residents in Canada but
[11:39] they're having trouble with paperwork
[11:41] and he really wants our prayers he said
[11:43] brother Jesse if you could really do do
[11:45] this he said the only way this will work
[11:47] out is if God does a paradox how many
[11:50] know God's a god of paradox God God just
[11:52] did that for me you know this this just
[11:55] last year with my documents I didn't get
[11:57] them on time I forgot about it and God
[11:59] did a paradox he uh he allowed the the
[12:03] leaders to accept my paperwork late
[12:05] normally that's
[12:07] unacceptable God did a paradox there so
[12:09] that gives me faith that God will help

[23:57] other people too you know we couldn't
[23:58] have a church without all the pillars
[24:01] and the pillars are everybody that comes
[24:02] every week and so everybody in our
[24:04] church is a pillar right we think about
[24:07] that we don't have people in and out we
[24:08] don't we have people that are here every
[24:11] single service and so we count it a
[24:13] blessing to have these pillars and
[24:14] Bang's family and uh we're so thankful
[24:17] for Andy to come on this year and bang
[24:20] sent me a text and I think it's okay
[24:21] that it share this but then just told me
[24:23] to text it's just been it's been a
[24:24] busier busier year for him it's been a
[24:26] more challenging year um but throughout
[24:29] all that he's been so faithful and so we
[24:31] want to thank the Lord for brother V all
[24:33] that he does for us by God's grace let's
[24:35] give round
[24:41] Applause can I give any little kiss here
[24:44] love you
[24:51] buddy then when the star PS get back
[24:53] I'll give the little girls you know you
[24:55] know how they do the uh feet washing
[24:56] tubs I'll give them little little token
[24:58] of my appreciation as well uh by God's
[25:01] grace but thank you to everybody for all
[25:02] that you do every person but especially
[25:04] our officers you know they're the real
[25:06] legal representatives of our
[25:09] church um so we thank God for that and
[25:12] as youve I've said this before but if
[25:14] there was ever a problem with me as a
[25:16] pastor you know if I ever you know got a
[25:19] complex or I ever uh fell into sin God
[25:22] forbid but I ever fell into sin I just
[25:24] want to remind the church the trustees
[25:26] you know uh would bring any accusation
[25:29] with two or three Witnesses of a local
[25:31] Elder they bring that they would bring
[25:33] that to me if there was ever anything
[25:35] that I did and I just want you to know
[25:37] that for the future I don't know how
[25:38] long I'll be on the scene I don't know
[25:40] we don't know how long we'll be here
[25:42] remember the Bible says against an elder
[25:44] do not receive a an accusation except
[25:46] with two or three
[25:47] Witnesses um so there's been numerous
[25:49] people email me over the years and they
[25:51] said our pastor did this our pastor did
[25:53] that I said they said what should you do
[25:54] I said you should follow what the Bible
[25:56] says you need two or three witnesses to
[25:59] bring an accusation against a local
[26:01] Elder which is the pastor R tells us but
[26:05] um you know with all the people leaving
[26:07] the message you know one one of their
[26:08] criticisms is that the pastors have too
[26:10] much power and in some Churches they
[26:13] don't have trustees which is a really
[26:15] awful thing um because then the pastor
[26:18] can do whatever he
[26:19] wants uh right but in our church you
[26:22] know the trustees and I'm a trustee as
[26:24] well but that's why I wonder brother
[26:26] amen on the board
[26:28] uh so now I'm outnumbered so if I ever
[26:30] do anything wrong you know the trustees
[26:33] can either remove me you know or
[26:35] something like that but what I'm trying
[26:37] to say is I don't want our I don't want
[26:38] our church to look like it's run by me
[26:40] like it's all run by me because the
[26:42] trustees have uh the trustees really
[26:44] have the authority okay but of course
[26:47] I'm a trustee so it's it's just
[26:50] interesting how that works out but
[26:51] that's how brother brandom was when he
[26:53] started his church so if you have any
[26:55] questions about that you know we could
[26:56] do a bible study on that in fact I found
[26:58] the paperwork from brandom Tabernacle
[27:00] that lists all the all the requirements
[27:02] for each office you know Pastor trustee
[27:05] Deacon song leader all these things uh
[27:07] and of course we don't have to mimic
[27:09] everything about brand Tabernacle
[27:10] because every church is Sovereign of
[27:12] itself but if you like more information
[27:14] on that you know uh I could give that to
[27:16] you and then I'm going to take that
[27:18] information down to Junction City in two
[27:21] Sundays and I'm going to give that to
[27:22] brother irin because the people there
[27:24] kind of Desiring to start a church as
[27:27] far as officially like having a voted in
[27:29] Pastor having voted in trustees a voted
[27:31] in uh Treasurer and so forth deacons and
[27:35] so forth so I just thought I'd share
[27:37] that you know uh for the sake we're
[27:38] starting new year and we're going to we
[27:39] wanted to recognize our officers uh by
[27:42] God's grace so let's stand here let's go
[27:44] to Romans chapter 8 verse1 I'm just
[27:46] going to preach a little message on
[27:47] Romans and as sure feel good you know
[27:50] Wednesday was wonderful you know what as
[27:52] I started going I was preaching all by
[27:53] myself down in my office you know but as
[27:55] I got going I felt more free but I feel
[27:57] a lot more free today CU I I have more
[27:59] than one I'm just I'm not in the room
[28:01] all by myself you know of course you
[28:03] know the Lord Jesus is always with us no
[28:04] matter where we are uh so be sure love
[28:07] everybody and appreciate everybody's uh
[28:09] faithfulness to be in the house of the
[28:11] Lord today that could make
[28:13] it Romans 8
[28:18] verse1 I was studying yesterday and I
[28:21] thought this thought was a good thought
[28:23] um as you'll see we'll eventually get to
[28:26] the scriptures look at spend uh more
[28:29] time on some scriptures but let's start
[28:32] with Romans 8 vers1 this is part 16
[28:34] that's just for my reference of just
[28:35] saying that we're going to save the
[28:37] seron Romans 8 verse1 a very powerful
[28:40] scripture this is the scripture brother
[28:42] R used when he preached invisible Union
[28:45] and he was talking about it's as though
[28:47] you never did it in the first place amen
[28:49] praise God so this this scripture of
[28:52] course ties in with other scriptures
[28:54] about what the cross of Jesus Christ
[28:57] actually accomplished for us and it's so
[29:00] much it accomplished everything for us
[29:02] and we just simply church we just simply
[29:03] have to have faith in what the cross has
[29:06] already accomplished
[29:10] Hallelujah Sorry God already knows here
[29:12] let's read this all three if we can
[29:13] ready 1 2 3 there is therefore now no
[29:18] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[29:21] Jesus who walked not after the flesh but
[29:25] after the spirit let's have one more
[29:26] word of pray and I've said a lot here
[29:28] and uh let's have one more word of
[29:29] prayer father God as we approach your
[29:31] word Lord God we ask God that you just
[29:33] anoint me to preach your word bless the
[29:34] saints that they press out to the house
[29:36] of God lord you said faith comes by
[29:39] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[29:41] lord we just want to Lord get real uh
[29:44] familiar with our Bibles Lord even more
[29:46] familiar Lord God just make these
[29:47] scriptures fresh to us Lord God help us
[29:49] to see Lord the shess of your promise
[29:52] that your word can never fail Lord God
[29:56] Lord this gives us hope for eternal life
[29:58] as the Bible tells us Lord God as we
[30:00] look at these scriptures father God
[30:01] surely that's what we need today we need
[30:03] hope for the future we need hope in the
[30:05] midst of sickness uh we we need hope
[30:07] Lord God uh for our prosperity of our
[30:10] health even as our souls Prosper Lord
[30:12] God so speak to us today give us hope
[30:14] for the future we pray and God let your
[30:17] word just transform our hearts and Minds
[30:19] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name the
[30:21] Saints said amen amen God bless you to
[30:23] being seated praise
[30:25] God I also thank brother Jose for this
[30:28] nice tie brother thanks for that I've
[30:30] got numerous ties I I just forget to
[30:32] wear brother so I got to he's giv me
[30:33] numerous ties over the year I just
[30:34] forget to wear so I said I'm not going
[30:36] to forget to wear this one I'm going to
[30:37] wear this one so the Bible said the
[30:39] righteous are as bold as the lion how
[30:40] many want to be bold today praise God
[30:42] just boldly believe the word of God
[30:44] thank you sir appreciate that by God's
[30:46] grace we'll be looking at Romans 81 now
[30:49] the first thought I had was just
[30:50] remember the context of this verse you
[30:52] know this verse again brother R use this
[30:54] verse to show how there's no condom
[30:57] Nation he uses it to show it's as though
[31:00] a Christian never sined in the first
[31:02] place amen that's based upon 1 John 3
[31:05] verse 9 the seed of God that's in you
[31:07] cannot sin the seat of God never sinned
[31:11] now if you look at context remember
[31:12] church when this was written there were
[31:14] no verses written by the the words like
[31:17] there was no there was no chapters
[31:18] either right how many you know that by
[31:20] God's grace so that's why you know it's
[31:22] many times helpful to to get rid of the
[31:25] chapters and the verses and just read
[31:26] this in context so that's what I'm going
[31:28] to do I'm just going to go back up a few
[31:30] verses in front of this uh and
[31:33] read so uh I'm going up to Romans 7:23
[31:37] but I see another law in my members
[31:39] Waring against the law of my mind and
[31:41] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[31:43] sin which is in my members so in context
[31:46] he's talking about this war between
[31:49] wanting to do right and wanting to do
[31:52] sin right yes he said this is a war that
[31:54] I'm going through constantly praise God
[31:57] and you know sometimes the wars get long
[31:59] like the Israel war sometimes the wars
[32:01] get long but how do we win church we win
[32:05] by never giving up praise God amen amen
[32:08] uh we win by finding strength in the
[32:11] battle
[32:12] righten it's like David I was reading
[32:14] through my Bible yesterday and just
[32:16] going through all my highlights and I I
[32:18] was back in first Samuel when when David
[32:21] got back uh remember David went out to
[32:23] war against Saul but God would not allow
[32:26] him to fight against Saul
[32:27] he comes back right uh he comes back and
[32:30] uh he comes back to zigg and all his two
[32:33] wives and all the wives of the mighty
[32:35] men were all taken right and how does he
[32:38] encourage himself the Bible said he
[32:40] encouraged himself in the Lord while
[32:42] other men were saying let's Stone David
[32:44] let's kill David imagine your own
[32:46] friends imagine your own mighty men are
[32:48] calling for you to be
[32:50] executed uh but how does he get out of
[32:52] this he encouraged himself in the Lord
[32:55] and then he said to the priest he said
[32:56] bring me the
[32:57] amen so for us bring me the Bible amen
[33:00] hallelujah if I got a problem if I'm
[33:02] discouraging if I'm running out of Hope
[33:04] and I've got to encourage myself bring
[33:07] me the word of God the word of God is
[33:08] the only thing that will encourage me
[33:10] praise God amen amen and so he asked the
[33:12] Lord he said Lord I'm inquiring of you
[33:14] should I go up and possess everything
[33:15] and the Lord said go and David said then
[33:18] then he says can I will I possess
[33:20] everything and the B and God said you'll
[33:22] restore all things amen hallelujah so
[33:24] David had no fear after that after
[33:27] looking the word of God and after after
[33:28] seeking God inquiring of God he had no
[33:31] fear the same is true for us when we
[33:33] want to encourage ourselves we look to
[33:34] the word of God God's word gives us
[33:36] strength and encouragement and the Bible
[33:38] said perfect love will cast out fear
[33:40] praise God Amen we're not immune from
[33:42] fear we all go through fearful moments
[33:45] but we must encourage ourselves in the
[33:47] Lord and we must look to the scripture
[33:49] and the scripture will encourage us and
[33:51] remind us that we are Overcomers amen
[33:54] and God will restore all things that
[33:56] were lost hallelujah amen amen amen
[33:59] we've all been through that before you
[34:00] know we lose our Zeal or we lose our
[34:03] excitement we lose our our strength our
[34:05] Vigor but God always has a way to
[34:07] restore that back to us hallelujah amen
[34:10] praise the Lord God is so faithful amen
[34:12] amen but notice he says I'm War I'm in a
[34:15] war then he says in verse 24 oh Wretched
[34:17] Man that I am who shall deliver me from
[34:19] the body of this death so he's in a war
[34:22] he's tired of fighting sometimes he
[34:25] wants to get out of the war he wants to
[34:26] be deliver and he recognizes I'm a
[34:29] Wretched Man you know I had that brother
[34:31] Ray you know I sure appreciate Ray he
[34:33] sent me this uh he sent me this audio
[34:36] yesterday and he's like brother I'm so
[34:37] thankful for your ministry you know I
[34:39] put out the video yesterday about why
[34:40] brother random wore shorts and
[34:41] everything and he said I'm so thankful
[34:44] for your ministry and all these things
[34:45] like that but you know when I I send him
[34:47] back a message I'm like but when I look
[34:48] at myself I see a Wretched Man and
[34:51] that's biblical right I'm glad people
[34:54] see good things in me because when I see
[34:56] me I'm many times I'm involved in the
[34:58] war within my members and the church
[35:01] said Hallelujah see we know each one of
[35:04] us you know thank God Christ shines
[35:06] through our lives Hallelujah that other
[35:08] people can see the love of Christ in our
[35:10] lives but in ourselves we're constantly
[35:13] fighting a battle when will this war end
[35:15] when can I get delivered when when will
[35:17] the Rapture take place when can I get a
[35:19] new body praise God right amen this is
[35:22] what this is the context that Paul's
[35:24] writing in I'm in a war I want to be
[35:26] delivered I see I'm a Wretched Man he
[35:30] says I want to be delivered from this
[35:32] body amen but then he says I thank God
[35:35] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then
[35:38] with the mind I myself serve the law of
[35:40] God with the flesh the law of the spirit
[35:42] so he ends the chapter by saying the way
[35:44] I get Victory is to renew my mind amen
[35:48] I've got to direct my mind I got I've
[35:50] got to get my mind off my failures or
[35:52] off my my sinful desires my carnal mind
[35:55] I got to get off that and the Bible said
[35:57] when you get your mind on the word of
[35:58] God your mind gets transformed amen so I
[36:02] just love this context because you know
[36:04] we just I just started chapter chapter 8
[36:06] verse one and I forget about what's
[36:08] before that Paul's just he he's he's
[36:11] just being honest I struggle I've got a
[36:14] war going on I wish I could be delivered
[36:16] from this I wish I got a new body I wish
[36:18] the Rapture would have happened
[36:20] yesterday right because I'm I'm battling
[36:22] today right I'm in a war today he said I
[36:25] want to be delivered this from this he
[36:27] said but I thank God that God can give
[36:30] me a new mind he can transform my
[36:33] thoughts hallelujah amen now with that
[36:35] background you go to verse one now there
[36:37] is now let's all say now can we now now
[36:41] there's no condemnation to them that are
[36:45] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[36:47] flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah
[36:51] now the word condemnation there means a
[36:54] damnatory sentence so that would be of
[36:56] course the white Throne judgment when
[36:58] Jesus will look at all the goats and
[37:00] they'll say I never knew you depart from
[37:02] me you workers of iniquity right so the
[37:06] Bible said there is no damnatory
[37:09] sentence for you and I so that means
[37:11] there's a sentence of Grace for us
[37:14] hallelujah if we're not damned then
[37:16] we're blessed hallelujah amen hallelujah
[37:18] so we have a sentence of blessing upon
[37:21] us this uh it's already guaranteed Paul
[37:23] says we have it now hallelujah amen
[37:27] Hallelujah the sentence has already been
[37:29] declared upon your life you're forgiven
[37:32] you're blessed you're the child of God
[37:34] and get you you're a joint air with
[37:36] Jesus Christ
[37:38] hallah I want to eventually get to verse
[37:40] 17 I'll be happy if I get to verse 17
[37:43] for today's
[37:44] service
[37:46] hallelujah oh my so I'm Waring I'm a
[37:50] Wretched Man but I have no condemnation
[37:53] whatever it's just it's just it's just
[37:56] par Paradox I mean that's the best word
[37:57] to say it's a paradox at the same time
[38:01] I'm Waring and seeing how wretched I am
[38:03] at the same time I have no condemnation
[38:06] yeah amen hallelujah so Church many
[38:09] times what does it come down to we just
[38:11] need reminders about God's faithfulness
[38:14] and God's promises hallelujah amen many
[38:18] times we just need that because our
[38:19] minds focus on the difficulties or the
[38:22] trials or the
[38:24] struggles but Paul says my body is
[38:27] wretched but my soul has no condemnation
[38:31] there's no damnatory sentence remember
[38:33] that takes us back to John 5 where the
[38:35] Bible said we have already passed Jesus
[38:37] said he that believes in me has already
[38:40] passed from Death the damory sentence
[38:43] unto eternal life oh it's already
[38:46] happened praise God yes amen hallelujah
[38:49] it's already for sure it's already a
[38:51] certain thing praise God we've already
[38:53] passed from death and there is no
[38:56] condemn ation to them which are in
[38:58] Christ Jesus now remember how do we get
[39:00] into Christ Jesus the Bible said you
[39:02] were baptized into Christ how many
[39:04] understand that let's read that Romans
[39:11] 6 Hallelujah verse three know you not
[39:14] that so many of us that were baptized
[39:16] into Jesus Christ were baptized in his
[39:18] death I have the privilege to say I've
[39:20] seen almost everyone in this church here
[39:22] baptized in
[39:23] water that's a privilege amen other
[39:26] words I saw back in it was December of
[39:29] 2006 uh when Bo and Zur I was there
[39:32] Hallelujah I saw when they were baptized
[39:34] into Christ amen hallelujah I was there
[39:37] Hallelujah now the only one that haven
[39:38] seen I think is brother Jose but I know
[39:40] what
[39:41] happened when was it brother what year
[39:43] were you baptized into Christ uh
[39:46] November 6
[39:47] 1990 amen you know the
[39:50] day God bless you that was my day that's
[39:54] a red letter Day November 6th Hallelujah
[39:56] amen see that that that's that's as
[39:59] wonderful as it is when you were
[40:01] baptized into Christ you repented of
[40:03] your sin and you pass from the damnatory
[40:06] sentence unto the sentence of Eternal
[40:09] blessing praise God Amen that's how you
[40:11] get into Christ and it we'll prove it
[40:13] later because the Bible said the Bible
[40:15] says anyone who's Justified already has
[40:18] the righteousness of Christ hallelujah
[40:20] amen amen which proves the foolish
[40:23] virgin are saved and they are God's
[40:26] children of course they they do not
[40:28] inherit all that the wise virgin
[40:31] inherits but they are still Justified
[40:34] and there is no condemnation to the
[40:36] foolish virgin
[40:39] Hallelujah well she know for those
[40:41] foolish virgin who live through the
[40:42] tribulation will they have to suffer yes
[40:44] yeah because they they didn't prepare
[40:46] and so they'll have to they have to
[40:47] suffer a little bit because of their uh
[40:50] uh because of their uh lack of moving on
[40:52] with God it's just like Saul Saul had to
[40:55] suffer right but he was saved at the end
[40:57] praise God had to suffer that awful end
[40:59] to his life W that's a really good type
[41:02] there and remember Saul I was reading
[41:04] that yesterday too Saul looked at David
[41:06] the second time David spared his life
[41:08] and Saul finally says David you are more
[41:10] righteous than I Hallelujah the wise
[41:14] virgin is more righteous the wise virgin
[41:16] lives more closer to God more closely
[41:19] obeys the word of God than the foolish
[41:22] but both are forgiven Hallelujah both
[41:25] have no condemnation Hallelujah because
[41:27] they've accepted Christ Hallelujah in
[41:30] other words they've all come out of
[41:31] Egypt but one took their position in the
[41:34] promised land while the others stay down
[41:36] in the wilderness oh my let's be the
[41:38] Believers that go all the way to the
[41:40] promised land that say we can possess
[41:42] this land we can overcome these Giants
[41:45] hallelujah amen we're more than
[41:47] conquerors in Christ Jesus all things
[41:49] are possible to them that believe am our
[41:52] Prophet said we can possess this land
[41:54] amen said we can possess it we can
[41:56] possess it hallelujah amen we don't stop
[42:00] short in foolish version say well I
[42:01] don't know if I can come to church or I
[42:03] don't know if I can pay ties I don't
[42:05] know if I can dress holy I don't know if
[42:07] I can ever overcome smoking those are
[42:09] words I used to say but once I got faith
[42:12] then I said I can overcome all these
[42:14] things amen all things are possible to
[42:17] them that
[42:18] believe I'll s that to my friend uh at
[42:20] school this week oh no I was talking
[42:23] there's a brother on the uh there's a
[42:25] truck driver I was telling you about and
[42:27] he just said I he said I just got to
[42:29] talk to you so I was I was on break and
[42:30] I called him
[42:31] up and he was shocked to know you know
[42:34] he's I he's watched lots of our services
[42:36] maybe he's watching now as he's driving
[42:38] I don't know but he was shocked to know
[42:40] that I once thought I could never
[42:42] overcome chewing tobacco and J that was
[42:45] the honest thing you know I was so
[42:47] addicted to that I told Christen we
[42:48] already engaged message Believers and I
[42:51] said I don't know if I can ever overcome
[42:53] this now think about that think about
[42:55] the the the demon influence that was
[42:57] over my life now maybe it was just
[42:58] unbelief right maybe it's unbelief or no
[43:02] doubt it's a lust of the flesh right cuz
[43:03] your flesh likes that sensation of the
[43:05] tobacco whatever but he was just shocked
[43:08] to to think that wow you're a preacher
[43:10] uh and to see God preach through you and
[43:13] teach and everything he said to think
[43:14] that once you thought you could never
[43:17] overcome it and I thought wow what what
[43:19] a I think that's a wonderful testimony
[43:21] because the mind of Jesse Smith thought
[43:24] I could never overcome this but event
[43:26] the mind of Christ took over praise God
[43:29] hallelujah amen the Bible said we don't
[43:32] keep our caral carnal Minds we have the
[43:34] mind of Christ
[43:36] hallelujah amen and he said he's 60
[43:38] years old he said this has given me much
[43:40] hope praise God and I told brother no
[43:43] matter what you're struggling with as
[43:44] soon as you were baptized you were
[43:46] saved you were Justified amen hallelujah
[43:49] there was no condemnation praise God
[43:52] hallelujah and as you draw closer to God
[43:54] I said the biggest help to me was having
[43:56] a home
[43:57] church and then have to have faithful
[44:00] Bible teaching because the Bible says he
[44:03] that the son is set free is free indeed
[44:05] and faith comes by hearing hearing by
[44:07] the word of God I started hearing quotes
[44:09] from Brother R I never knew before amen
[44:11] I started finding scriptures I never
[44:13] heard before and the more truth I
[44:15] receive the stronger I get the more
[44:17] faith muscles I got Hallelujah I don't
[44:19] have much natural muscles right so God
[44:21] give me much Faith muscles Hallelujah
[44:24] and I can cast out the I can cast out
[44:26] the cigarettes I can cast out you know
[44:28] the the chewing tobacco I can cast that
[44:31] out and then God sets us free as we
[44:33] stand upon his word amen amen I didn't I
[44:37] didn't plan to preach that but that
[44:38] thought just kind of came to me now the
[44:40] Bible says there's no condemnation to
[44:41] them that walk now church this is of
[44:43] course is not the natural word for walk
[44:45] this is to make one's way or progress
[44:48] through life
[44:51] Hallelujah to make due use of your
[44:54] opportunities
[44:56] so the Bible says you and I have no
[44:59] condemnation as we progress and make our
[45:02] way through life and the church said
[45:04] amen in other words it's not well this
[45:07] day I have no condemnation today I have
[45:10] condemnation no no once you're saved
[45:13] once you're baptized in Christ with real
[45:15] Faith you pass from Death unto life
[45:18] hallelujah amen now remember there's a
[45:21] difference just between condemnation
[45:23] which is the condemnation on the day of
[45:25] the the white Throne judgment we've all
[45:27] passed from that there's a difference
[45:29] between that and just the the guilt of
[45:32] needing to repent so you have to know
[45:34] there's two kinds of of condemnation
[45:36] there because remember Paul went to
[45:39] Peter and said you're to be blamed right
[45:42] right and that was that was there's a
[45:44] temporary condemnation but then there's
[45:46] a permanent condemnation we've passed
[45:49] from the permanent condemnation we're
[45:51] permanently blessed hallelujah amen
[45:53] we're permanently saved amen
[45:57] but yes when we when our sin within us
[45:59] falls short there's a temporary
[46:01] condemnation that we have but that
[46:03] doesn't mean we're lost god brother said
[46:06] God doesn't run his business way brother
[46:09] R said God doesn't save you if he knows
[46:11] he's going to lose you amen hallelujah
[46:14] because you're the elect hallelujah amen
[46:15] amen amen he doesn't sa you know well I
[46:18] might lose them someday God doesn't
[46:20] brother said you wouldn't run your
[46:21] business that way you wouldn't if you're
[46:23] running a business of a truck you know a
[46:26] a a trucking business you wouldn't buy
[46:28] these trucks knowing you're just going
[46:29] to throw them away and not use them no
[46:31] you buy the trucks and you load up the
[46:33] trucks yes you drive the trucks you use
[46:36] them you don't buy something with a plan
[46:38] to throw it away and that's what get God
[46:40] did God bought you he purchased you with
[46:42] his blood so he can use you amen am amen
[46:45] and he is using you praise God Amen
[46:48] whatever your testimony is shared you
[46:50] know whenever uh God anoints you to help
[46:53] the poor or clothe those that need
[46:56] clothes or any any Act of love any
[46:59] fasting and prayer arm giving anytime
[47:02] God uses you to do that God is getting
[47:04] use out of his purchase hallelujah amen
[47:08] glory
[47:09] amen so you and I have no condemnation
[47:13] as we make our way through life and we
[47:16] make due use of the opportunities God
[47:19] has given us hallelujah no
[47:22] condemnation now moving on to verse two
[47:24] and remember what verse one to
[47:27] show the that it's as though we never
[47:29] sin in the first place there's no
[47:31] damnatory sentence against the bride of
[47:34] Christ Hallelujah nor the fish virgin
[47:37] verse Two for the law of the spirit of
[47:39] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[47:42] from the law of sin and
[47:44] death okay so this is why there's no
[47:47] condemnation the law of spirit of life
[47:50] in Jesus Christ has made me free from
[47:53] the law of sin and death
[47:56] now uh free means to set at
[47:59] Liberty so see we are liberated from
[48:02] being slaves to sin hallelujah how many
[48:06] can look at your life and you can see I
[48:08] was a slave to this sin but now I'm no
[48:11] longer a slave to that hallelujah praise
[48:14] God I used to buy I I was some of the
[48:17] worst with music I'd buy the worst music
[48:20] it was all I would buy Marilyn Manson
[48:22] and Snoop Dogg I would buy the worst of
[48:23] the worst you know notorious b y I was I
[48:26] heard it at a store recently I was
[48:27] thinking my goodness I bought
[48:29] that well see I was I was under the law
[48:32] of sin and
[48:34] death That's the Law I live by but now I
[48:37] live by a different law I've got a
[48:39] different rule over my life Hallelujah
[48:42] I'm led by the spirit of life amen now I
[48:45] got life in Jesus Christ
[48:47] Hallelujah now I buy songs like all
[48:49] things new like I shared with you this
[48:51] week Hallelujah he makes all things new
[48:54] praise God Amen amen hallelujah so we're
[48:57] liberated from the slavery of Sin Sin
[49:00] does not dominate our lives on a daily
[49:02] basis now we might have some difficult
[49:04] days we've all had them I've had them
[49:06] we've had difficult weeks and everything
[49:07] where we just struggle but doesn't God
[49:11] show his faithfulness by coming around
[49:13] and blessing us and bringing us out of
[49:14] that amen amen every time every time
[49:17] we're trapped in a a struggle or a
[49:19] battle and many times like I said we get
[49:21] ourselves trapped in there every time we
[49:23] allow ourselves to be taken captive God
[49:25] always comes along and he's faithful to
[49:27] Deliver us from our own mistakes praise
[49:29] God Amen
[49:32] Hallelujah see we have no condemnation
[49:35] because we're we're free from the
[49:37] Dominion of Sin Sin does not have
[49:40] dominion over us praise God think about
[49:43] that today you got you got dominion over
[49:45] sin what would your flesh tell you to do
[49:47] today sleep
[49:48] in go gorge on some unhealthy Foods
[49:52] right right don't go to church don't pay
[49:55] your ties don't worship God don't sing
[49:58] Don't Clap skip church I mean the flesh
[50:01] tells us all these things but look at
[50:03] all the victories you already got today
[50:04] praise God Amen Hallelujah you know I I
[50:09] believe this we can get so devoted to
[50:12] God that it it's a uh it's not a very
[50:15] hard battle to bring your body into
[50:17] subjection and what I mean by that is
[50:19] every Sunday morning like even this
[50:20] morning I woke up and no one had to tell
[50:22] me you know you should fast today
[50:23] brother Jesse no one had to tell me that
[50:25] the Holy Spirit didn't have to do that
[50:27] it's just I knew it was Sunday and I
[50:29] don't even go to the
[50:30] food right now I'm not I'm not saying
[50:32] that to Rejoice like a Pharisee I fast
[50:34] twice a week I'm just saying brother had
[50:37] a fast day he fasted every Friday that's
[50:40] what he tells us so I'm saying you know
[50:43] once we overcome all these uh uh bad
[50:46] habits once we're really trained up in
[50:48] the spirit of life it's a more it's a
[50:51] very natural thing to surrender and
[50:53] yield to the Holy Spirit praise God
[50:55] that's I'm saying amen and if and if
[50:57] you're not where you want to be you know
[50:59] you don't have to make a New Year's
[51:00] resolution praise God you don't have to
[51:01] do that I mean talk about a rough start
[51:03] to the new year that's been us with all
[51:05] these
[51:06] sicknesses my my family it looks like a
[51:09] emergency room all my kids are laying
[51:11] out you know there's like five or six
[51:13] kids all laying out on the floor and on
[51:15] the couches and just like everybody
[51:16] sneezing coughing hacking and there
[51:19] tissues everywhere it looks like a
[51:21] emergency
[51:23] room everybody's sick has it's been a
[51:25] start to the year so it you know we just
[51:29] have to trust in God we have to raise up
[51:31] uh you know from from our discouragement
[51:33] we just got to raise up and say Lord I'm
[51:35] giving you this day praise God I'm
[51:37] walking to the according to the law of
[51:39] the Holy Spirit today praise God amen
[51:41] amen then you can yield you know we
[51:44] yield uh to the Holy Spirit each and
[51:47] every day now I had a picture up here
[51:48] but I can't I don't want to share it
[51:50] today but there there's two paths you
[51:52] either walk on the law of sin and death
[51:54] or you walk on the law of the Holy
[51:56] Spirit now I like this picture it says
[51:59] if you're walking by the law of sin and
[52:00] death the law increases under more
[52:03] sin and then the wages of sin is death
[52:07] so that that that's your old law you
[52:09] used to walk according to right remember
[52:11] the Bible said you were married to that
[52:13] law but that old law is
[52:16] dead now you're baptized in Christ
[52:19] Hallelujah now you've got the holy
[52:21] spirit in your life whether you're
[52:23] Justified Sanctified or filled with the
[52:24] Holy Spirit but each one of us are still
[52:26] daily Desiring to be led by the Holy
[52:29] Spirit but now if you're under the law
[52:31] of the Holy Spirit now you're not under
[52:33] the law you're under grace and grace
[52:37] imputes or gives you
[52:39] righteousness and righteousness then
[52:42] freely gives you eternal life amen so
[52:45] law imputes sin and the wage of sin is
[52:48] death but Grace imputes God's
[52:51] righteousness to you and freely gives
[52:53] you life amen amen that's the path
[52:56] you're on Amen you're on the path of
[52:58] grace and grace will give you more
[53:00] righteousness
[53:01] Hallelujah I'm talking about in your
[53:03] daily life God already attributes
[53:05] righteousness to you in heaven you're
[53:07] already righteous think about this
[53:08] church you've already got a theophany
[53:10] body brother Jose there's a theop body
[53:12] that looks like 21 you got to get your
[53:14] 21y old picture and share with me
[53:15] sometime then I'll put it up here on the
[53:17] screen I wish I had V I might have V 21y
[53:19] old picture remember all those
[53:21] anniversary pictures I used to
[53:23] show come in Jun I put bangs 21 and I'll
[53:26] put my 21 brother Jose has a each one of
[53:29] us have a theophany and the Bible said
[53:31] it's waiting there in the presence of
[53:33] God waiting for your soul to reunite
[53:35] with it amen hallelujah amen yes so in
[53:39] other words you're already righteous in
[53:40] heaven but on Earth God is developing as
[53:43] you walk as you progress in your
[53:46] Christian walk God's developing your
[53:48] character to be more righteous
[53:50] hallelujah amen what so what I'm saying
[53:53] is you have progressing righteousness on
[53:54] the Earth Earth but God has already
[53:56] imputed righteousness to you in heaven
[53:59] you've always been a child of God you
[54:01] came out of the mind of God and God's
[54:03] got a glorified body he's got an eternal
[54:05] house in the heavens with your name on
[54:08] it praise God Amen that's what the Bible
[54:11] says hallelujah if this Earthly
[54:13] Tabernacle be dissolved we have a house
[54:16] not made with hands Eternal in the
[54:18] heavens waiting for
[54:21] us
[54:24] amen
[54:25] Zion was telling me daddy why are you
[54:27] getting all those gray hairs in your
[54:28] beard I saidwell I'm getting old Zion I
[54:31] said but I got a a body in heaven that's
[54:33] got all black hair on my
[54:36] beard Hall if I can have a beard in
[54:38] heaven I don't know Sam I had a a beard
[54:41] when remember as the offering came up
[54:42] and he had a white long beard now we're
[54:44] promised new life because of the blood
[54:46] of Christ Hallelujah Samuel came up and
[54:48] he had a beard Hallelujah white beard
[54:50] white
[54:52] robes but that's the that's the path
[54:54] wrong we're on the path of Grace
[54:57] imputing righteousness to us and it
[54:59] leads to eternal life praise God
[55:01] hallelujah I want to show you this is
[55:03] what the Bible calls there's two
[55:05] Ministries and we're under the ministry
[55:08] of God's righteousness so let's read
[55:10] second Corinthians 3:9 you got your
[55:13] Bible just turn over there I just want
[55:14] to lay this in here and we're going to
[55:15] do a little bible study here by God's
[55:17] grace I forgot to set a timer but uh
[55:20] yeah sorry I forgot to set the
[55:22] time after this we I just want to do a I
[55:24] want to show you this this idea of the
[55:27] Bible teaching about righteousness where
[55:30] you already have God's righteousness in
[55:32] heaven but God is trying to uh mold you
[55:35] to be more righteous in other words to
[55:37] more surrender to the Holy Spirit as you
[55:39] walk through this life
[55:44] Hallelujah now one thing I you know I
[55:46] think I've Shar this before I think this
[55:48] was back in
[55:49] 2010 or 11 because I was at my house in
[55:52] doy toown and I remember that year I
[55:54] realized the Holy Spirit showed me I had
[55:56] complexes toward five
[55:58] preachers in other words every time i'
[56:00] I'd see say their name or hear their
[56:02] name I'd get real upset at
[56:04] them and then I would even talk I would
[56:06] talk to other brothers about them I'd
[56:08] say I'd say bad things about them and
[56:11] that's not right brother R had the same
[56:13] thing he said he battled a critical
[56:15] spirit as I remember the Holy Spirit Led
[56:17] me uh to repent and I called up each one
[56:20] of those brothers and said will you
[56:21] forgive me in my
[56:23] complexes now why am I sure because I
[56:25] can see how righteousness is progressing
[56:28] more in my life amen I don't got that
[56:31] anymore remember the one brother told me
[56:33] I was a little jealous of the bigname
[56:35] preachers I'm not God knows my heart I
[56:37] am not jealous of them I wish the best
[56:39] for them God has given me the Revelation
[56:41] that whatever lot in life he's given to
[56:44] me I'm content with it right amen I want
[56:48] godliness with contentment to be my
[56:50] great game amen that's the one thing I
[56:52] want to gain amen I want to gain thank
[56:54] God for all you've done for me I'm happy
[56:56] with what you've done for me praise God
[56:58] Amen of course you want to see more Soul
[57:00] saved don't get me wrong don't wrong you
[57:02] know I'd like to have you know more
[57:03] money so I can help more people out
[57:04] don't get me wrong I mean I desire I
[57:06] desire blessings but I want to be I want
[57:08] to be thankful for all that he's given
[57:10] me now praise God Amen I don't want to
[57:12] be Covetous which is idolatry I don't
[57:14] want to be I don't want to have Idols in
[57:16] my life but I want to be content with
[57:18] what God has given me praise God in
[57:20] other words that's that's one area I can
[57:22] see God is developing more righteousness
[57:24] in my my
[57:27] life
[57:30] Hallelujah now it's 2 Corinthians 3:9
[57:33] for if the ministration of condemnation
[57:35] think about that that's what you were
[57:37] married to the law right we're married
[57:38] to the law of sin and death the ministry
[57:40] of
[57:41] condemnation be glory now remember why
[57:45] was it glorious because the Bible said
[57:46] the law was holy the law was good but
[57:49] the condemnation was if you break one
[57:51] thing you're you're judged for all of it
[57:53] right that was the condemnation that's
[57:55] what we read there in Romans right but
[57:58] the the law itself was a glorious thing
[58:00] but the Bible says soon here we'll see
[58:01] it it's the weakness of our flesh that
[58:04] couldn't keep the law right because Adam
[58:07] and Eve Sinn and now every person born
[58:09] after Adam and Eve now they got the sin
[58:11] nature in them and their flesh is weak
[58:14] how many know your flesh is weak right
[58:17] amen right just it doesn't always
[58:19] doesn't always want to obey the word of
[58:21] God and so the flesh can never keep the
[58:23] law the law is Holy but because we
[58:25] couldn't keep it it was a Ministry of
[58:28] condemnation now Church let's let's
[58:30] let's be encouraged let's not walk
[58:31] around this week feeling condemned all
[58:33] the time let's walk around this week
[58:35] feeling forgiven praise God amen amen
[58:38] because we're not under the ministry of
[58:40] condemnation G remember brother I love
[58:42] this St said the Christian should be the
[58:44] happiest person on the earth amen amen
[58:47] hallelujah praise God well when you know
[58:50] if we're all discouraged all week when
[58:52] are we ever going to be happy praise God
[58:54] and then if we're tired in church or
[58:55] frustrated in church or you know
[58:56] whatever we go through I'm not poting
[58:58] about any I'm not talking about anybody
[58:59] today you know but what I'm saying is
[59:02] that if we're supposed to be the
[59:02] happiest person on Earth because of the
[59:05] blood of Jesus Christ let's walk in that
[59:07] happiness let's let people see the
[59:09] happiness in our lives praise God Amen
[59:12] we are not under the ministry of
[59:14] condemnation we're under the ministry of
[59:16] Jesus sharing his righteousness with us
[59:19] amen so it's uh finishing three thank
[59:22] you sister I appreciate that so there
[59:24] there there's two there's two laws the
[59:25] law of of sin and death and the law uh
[59:28] of the spere of life there's two laws
[59:31] yes so we're not under the ministry of
[59:33] condemnation we're under the ministry of
[59:37] righteousness which exceeds in
[59:40] glory in other words Moses lived a
[59:43] glorious life he was under the law of
[59:45] Ministry of
[59:46] condemnation Joshua think about all
[59:48] these soldiers Ezra Nehemiah you know
[59:51] David Solomon look at all these
[59:52] wonderful uh Servants of God God but
[59:55] they were under the ministry of
[59:56] condemnation but you and I are under the
[59:58] ministry of righteousness and it exceeds
[1:00:01] in Glory Hallelujah in other words in
[1:00:04] our life think about this in our life we
[1:00:06] can experience more of the glory of God
[1:00:08] amen amen isn't that right Church think
[1:00:12] about that David flew a giant but then
[1:00:14] he also did the basba thing and
[1:00:17] Uriah but we can have more Glory
[1:00:20] Hallelujah we have more Glory because we
[1:00:22] cast down all the imagination that
[1:00:25] exalts itself against the word of
[1:00:27] God we we don't have to live our lives
[1:00:30] with that type of St on our lives amen
[1:00:33] we can experience more of the glory of
[1:00:35] God think about Solomon he saw Jesus
[1:00:37] twice he saw the theophany of God twice
[1:00:40] in the vision but then he builds all
[1:00:42] these houses to all the other false
[1:00:45] gods think about that but see our lives
[1:00:48] have more Glory than his life amen even
[1:00:51] if we don't see Jesus the Bible says
[1:00:53] we're more blessed
[1:00:55] if we haven't seen yet we believe
[1:00:59] hallelujah amen we're more blessed the
[1:01:02] Bible says it our lives should exceed in
[1:01:04] glory in other words more obedience to
[1:01:07] the Holy Spirit more power more Victory
[1:01:10] Hallelujah more righteousness because of
[1:01:13] the blood of Jesus Christ because of the
[1:01:15] New Testament because of the law of the
[1:01:18] spirit of Life hallelujah amen It's Made
[1:01:20] Me free from the law of sin and death
[1:01:22] hallelujah amen amen
[1:01:25] Church think about that the greatest man
[1:01:26] ever was John the Baptist in the Old
[1:01:27] Testament because he didn't fall like
[1:01:30] David Solomon Moses right killing a man
[1:01:35] he that's why he was the greatest of all
[1:01:37] them because he lived such a Godly life
[1:01:39] but the Bible says because the the blood
[1:01:42] of Christ now we can we can serve God in
[1:01:45] exceeding Glory we can live a more
[1:01:48] consecrated life to Christ amen
[1:01:51] hallelujah that's the word of
[1:01:53] God so those are the two laws there's a
[1:01:56] Ministry of condemnation there's a
[1:01:58] Ministry of
[1:02:00] righteousness Hallelujah now let me read
[1:02:02] the definition of righteousness for you
[1:02:05] uh from the
[1:02:06] Lexicon it's being in the condition
[1:02:09] acceptable to God yes sir so if I said
[1:02:12] you know you're righteous today brother
[1:02:14] Jose then that means God has accepted
[1:02:16] you God's not rejected you he's accepted
[1:02:20] you he said Jose is my genuine child
[1:02:23] amen I've accepted him as my child it
[1:02:26] also
[1:02:27] means Integrity virtue purity of life
[1:02:31] right rightness correctness of thinking
[1:02:33] and feeling and
[1:02:35] acting you know I get I get comments all
[1:02:37] the time people text me and say brother
[1:02:39] Jesse I'm amazed at the comments you
[1:02:41] make to people on YouTube because you're
[1:02:43] so gracious to them and yet you rebuke
[1:02:44] them and correct them so that's one
[1:02:47] thing I want to get good at brother say
[1:02:49] I want to get good at lovingly rebuking
[1:02:51] people because that's what Jesus
[1:02:52] diden Hallelujah
[1:02:55] brother say brother he makes this point
[1:02:57] Jesus never let anybody say something
[1:02:59] wrong in his presence Jesus always
[1:03:01] corrected the word always corrected
[1:03:03] corrected Mary amen that's right she
[1:03:06] said your father and I have been looking
[1:03:07] for you he said I'm about my father's
[1:03:10] business that's right and look he showed
[1:03:12] he showed kindness to his mother but he
[1:03:15] corrected his mom right every time the
[1:03:18] Pharisees and Sadducees and tried to
[1:03:20] Corner him he'd always correct them with
[1:03:22] the word of God
[1:03:25] and that's what I want to see in my life
[1:03:26] too I want to see the god giving me more
[1:03:29] righteousness where I can have the
[1:03:31] correct way of feeling and the correct
[1:03:34] way of acting I want to feel compassion
[1:03:37] to Sinners am I don't want to just be
[1:03:40] like I hate Pharisees and I hate I don't
[1:03:42] want to feel like that I want to have
[1:03:44] compassion for them right amen but yet I
[1:03:46] want to correct them as well like Jesus
[1:03:48] did cuz I don't know which ones are
[1:03:49] going to turn around and join our side
[1:03:51] amen hopefully some will join our side
[1:03:53] Hallelujah right amen I used to fight
[1:03:55] against the holy way I used to speak
[1:03:56] against the holy way and God if God can
[1:03:59] be merciful to me God can be merciful to
[1:04:01] our friends yeah
[1:04:04] amen it means uh righteousness also
[1:04:06] means Justice or The Virtue which G
[1:04:09] gives each person his due so I'm not
[1:04:12] really certain about that definition but
[1:04:14] we can clearly see when you're righteous
[1:04:16] God accepts you as his child and then he
[1:04:19] gives you the correct way of thinking
[1:04:21] and
[1:04:22] acting that's the Ministry of
[1:04:25] righteousness so God declares you're
[1:04:27] righteous you're forgiven in heaven he's
[1:04:30] already accepted you you're already go
[1:04:31] you're already accepted in the Beloved
[1:04:33] praise God Amen that's that verse I love
[1:04:35] that verse you're already sitting in
[1:04:37] Heavenly places that means your faith is
[1:04:38] in heaven Hallelujah your hope is in
[1:04:41] heaven I'm seated in Heavenly places my
[1:04:43] hope is in heaven my faith is in God
[1:04:45] Amen but on Earth he slowly transforming
[1:04:49] my character into his righteous
[1:04:51] character from Faith to Faith from glory
[1:04:54] to glory so I I use this example but
[1:04:57] last year God really gave me uh growth
[1:05:00] in my righteousness related to dancing
[1:05:03] so before before 2022 and 23 I feel a
[1:05:06] little condemnation dancing but now I
[1:05:08] don't feel any condemnation amen because
[1:05:12] I only dance to glorify Jesus amen see
[1:05:16] I'm I'm growing he's he's letting his
[1:05:18] righteousness grow in me and also know
[1:05:21] I'm not condemned if I don't dance when
[1:05:23] I come to church every service I'm not
[1:05:25] I'm not I'm not judged by that I dance
[1:05:28] when God leads me to dance amen God do
[1:05:32] something great for me I wanted to give
[1:05:33] him a dance amen CU I recognize dancing
[1:05:36] is a
[1:05:37] season remember Ecclesiastes 3 I read
[1:05:40] that I think I read that on Wednesday
[1:05:41] night there's a time to mourn and a time
[1:05:43] to dance well if I'm not mourning you
[1:05:45] better get you better believe I'm
[1:05:46] getting my dancing shoes on Amen I dance
[1:05:49] and praise the Lord and give God glory
[1:05:51] praise God because I'm not mourn there
[1:05:53] is a time to mourn but there is a time
[1:05:55] to dance praise God see and yes that's a
[1:05:59] minor yes God is God's working minor
[1:06:02] things into my character right because
[1:06:06] he's already got the majors
[1:06:08] amen right I'm I'm I'm not living in
[1:06:10] these major sins of murder or adultery
[1:06:13] or blasphemy or all these heresies I'm
[1:06:16] not live God's given us victory over the
[1:06:18] majors so God's got to make minor tweaks
[1:06:20] in our life praise God Amen oh
[1:06:23] Hallelujah bang fixes his cars all the
[1:06:25] time right he's got to do minor little
[1:06:27] repairs most of the time right brother
[1:06:29] hopefully not too many major repairs but
[1:06:32] bang has really learned to do minor
[1:06:34] repairs Jose too right you're kind of
[1:06:37] like your own mechanics because you're
[1:06:38] so you're so skilled with that right I
[1:06:40] admire that but see it's not you know if
[1:06:43] it's a major thing they might they might
[1:06:45] they probably might even do the major
[1:06:46] thing right but but under normal C
[1:06:48] circumstances they're just doing minor
[1:06:50] repairs on the car I used to be able to
[1:06:53] change my oil El I can say Amen to that
[1:06:55] one time I did one time I used to do
[1:06:56] minor repairs one time I changed my
[1:06:59] battery and uh some other things uh air
[1:07:04] filters oil filters things like that
[1:07:06] there's just minor things and that's
[1:07:08] what God is doing in our lives our lives
[1:07:10] are moving along and as time goes on God
[1:07:13] will do minor Corrections in our lives
[1:07:16] he'll do he'll help us live righteously
[1:07:18] on these minor things Hallelujah cuz all
[1:07:20] the majors are being played out praise
[1:07:22] God we forgiven we forgiven people
[1:07:25] Hallelujah Jesus said if you forgive
[1:07:26] others I'll forgive you praise God Amen
[1:07:29] all these Majors God has worked out in
[1:07:31] our lives but we're still under the
[1:07:33] ministry of God's righteousness he's
[1:07:36] trying to form righteous that's the
[1:07:38] Bible say church I
[1:07:40] like the Bible say you go from Faith to
[1:07:43] Faith you go from glory to glory the
[1:07:45] Bible says in Proverbs your life shines
[1:07:48] more and more unto a perfect life a
[1:07:50] perfect life complete maturity Jesus

[1:07:56] father in Heaven is perfect

[1:08:02] hallelujah see your life each year it
[1:08:06] gets slowly molded into a more righteous
[1:08:09] life but you're already accepted in
[1:08:11] heaven God already knows the end from
[1:08:14] the beginning praise God Amen but we're
[1:08:17] under the ministry of righteousness
[1:08:19] Jesus making us more righteous
[1:08:21] Hallelujah now now let's do a little
[1:08:23] bible study here get your Bibles ready
[1:08:24] here we'll just flip through these real
[1:08:25] fast

[1:08:47] Romans 325 and 26 it's Matthew 633
[1:08:51] Romans 32526 Caris Romans 4 4 5 and
[1:08:55] 13 now all these verses have the word
[1:08:58] righteousness in
[1:09:00] it and all these verses will show us
[1:09:03] we're under the ministry of
[1:09:05] righteousness we've already got
[1:09:07] righteousness in heaven God's already
[1:09:09] imputed it to us because we've accepted
[1:09:11] Christ but on Earth he's building he's
[1:09:14] progressing righteousness in our lives
[1:09:16] or I should say rather as we're
[1:09:18] progressing through each year he's
[1:09:19] making us more righteous so sister Z you
[1:09:21] want to read that one verse 3 yes
[1:09:25] 633 but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:09:28] and his righteousness and all these
[1:09:29] things shall be added onto you amen I'm
[1:09:31] G to give her I'm GNA give her some
[1:09:33] cheers here hallelujah so see here's
[1:09:36] where what are we doing we're seeking
[1:09:38] righteousness every day so this
[1:09:40] definition is the Integrity we're
[1:09:42] seeking God's Integrity every day right
[1:09:45] especially if you got a big meeting at
[1:09:47] work or you got a big meeting at church
[1:09:49] and you really want to make the right
[1:09:51] decision that morning you better be
[1:09:53] seeking God's righteousness Lord I want
[1:09:56] to I want I I want to be so close to
[1:09:57] your word that I know I'll make the
[1:09:59] right decision amen right no matter what
[1:10:01] decision I got to make so there's the
[1:10:03] verse where you're already righteous but
[1:10:05] under this ministry of righteousness in
[1:10:07] your life you've got to seek it daily
[1:10:10] seek more righteousness Amen brother
[1:10:12] amen uh Romans 3:25 and
[1:10:15] 26 whom God has set forth to be a
[1:10:18] appropriation through faith and his
[1:10:21] blood to declare his righteousness for
[1:10:23] the remiss of sins that are passed
[1:10:25] through the forbearance of God to
[1:10:27] declare I say at this time his
[1:10:29] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:10:32] the justifier of him which believeth in
[1:10:34] Jesus amen praise God now this is the
[1:10:36] Heavenly righteousness can everybody see
[1:10:38] that the Bible said he's
[1:10:40] declaring Jesus's righteousness for us
[1:10:44] and the Bible says declare which means a
[1:10:46] token Hallelujah the token amen it's a
[1:10:49] sign of evidence so Jesus's blood in
[1:10:52] heaven is the sign or evidence that we
[1:10:55] are righteous it's for the sending away
[1:10:58] or the remission of
[1:11:00] sins and now Jesus is just and he
[1:11:04] justifies each one of us he declares
[1:11:06] each one of us righteous because we have
[1:11:09] faith in him praise God amen amen what a
[1:11:11] beautiful scripture so the so we're
[1:11:13] seeking righteousness on Earth every day
[1:11:16] we seek more of his Integrity more of
[1:11:18] his character but we've already got it
[1:11:20] through the blood of Jesus Christ in
[1:11:22] heaven hallelujah amen
[1:11:24] I love these truths here car going to
[1:11:25] read Romans
[1:11:28] 45 now to
[1:11:32] him for what
[1:11:34] sayith wait what was I Chapter 4 Verse 5
[1:11:38] but to him that worketh not but to him
[1:11:40] that worketh not
[1:11:42] but believeth on him that justifi the
[1:11:46] ungodly for faith is counted for
[1:11:51] righteousness all right praise God
[1:11:52] giving you son
[1:11:55] now this is back to Abraham when we
[1:11:56] preach on chapter 4 so the Bible says
[1:11:59] anyone that believes in Christ with
[1:12:02] Faith remember that Faith was also a
[1:12:03] gift from God it's not something you
[1:12:05] worked up God gave you that Faith said
[1:12:08] the faith is a gift of God amen glory so
[1:12:12] the Bible says if you believe then
[1:12:14] you're Justified and this Faith counts
[1:12:17] for your righteousness so the very fact
[1:12:19] you believe in Jesus is proof that
[1:12:22] you're righteous praise God
[1:12:24] amen and then by your fruit you're known
[1:12:25] right well you might we might think what
[1:12:27] about uh the people in the CMA this
[1:12:29] morning for me what about the people in
[1:12:31] Assembly of God well if they if they got
[1:12:33] genuine Faith then they'll live a
[1:12:35] Christian Life praise God Amen right
[1:12:37] they're known by their fruits so God's
[1:12:39] able to look at each and every heart and
[1:12:40] say that one's sincere that one's that
[1:12:42] one that this one's not sincere this
[1:12:44] these These are sincere God knows if
[1:12:46] it's real faith in the word of God
[1:12:48] hallelujah amen amen now verse 13 I'll
[1:12:51] read that one for the promise that he he
[1:12:53] should be the heir of the world was not
[1:12:55] to Abraham or to his seed through the
[1:12:56] law but through the righteousness of
[1:12:59] Faith there's that righteousness again
[1:13:01] we have we're righteousness through
[1:13:04] faith in God
[1:13:06] okay now the Bible says uh here's
[1:13:09] another one let's go to Romans 6:16 I'll
[1:13:11] read some of these
[1:13:12] here we just preached on this recently
[1:13:14] but I want to give this idea we're under
[1:13:16] the ministry of
[1:13:17] righteousness this was fresh when I was
[1:13:19] studying it
[1:13:21] today so here's the Bible says uh now
[1:13:25] this is a righteousness where you're
[1:13:26] you're you're uh laboring for it in this
[1:13:29] life you're D in other words you're
[1:13:31] dying to self every day you're trying to
[1:13:33] OB be obedient to the word of God that
[1:13:36] you might live more
[1:13:38] righteously Romans
[1:13:40] 6:16 know ye not that to whom ye yield
[1:13:44] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[1:13:46] ye are to whom you obey whether of sin
[1:13:49] unto death or of obedience unto
[1:13:52] righteousness Hallelujah
[1:13:54] so we we're Servants of Christ how many
[1:13:56] Servants of Christ you got here amen
[1:13:58] amen because you're a servant of Christ
[1:14:00] you yield to the Holy Spirit you obey
[1:14:02] the Holy Spirit and it makes you
[1:14:05] righteous it makes you act the right way
[1:14:07] in this world Amen right but you're
[1:14:10] already and you seek that every day
[1:14:12] you're seeking obedience every day we
[1:14:13] tie that with what our sister read
[1:14:15] Matthew 6:33 so these two go together
[1:14:18] Matthew 633 Romans 6:16 it's obeying
[1:14:21] it's seeking his righteousness so you
[1:14:23] can live the right way on this Earth
[1:14:26] Hallelujah now here's a wonderful one
[1:14:27] too uh 2 Corinthians 9:9 let's read that
[1:14:30] 2 Corinthians
[1:14:37] 9:9 here's another way and you you see
[1:14:41] this often with people as they get older
[1:14:42] right uh when they get older and they
[1:14:45] get towards the end of their life you
[1:14:46] hear about some people donating their
[1:14:48] life savings to a Christian cause right
[1:14:51] or helping the poor that that's a great
[1:14:53] thing to do because here look what the
[1:14:55] Bible says as it is written he hath
[1:14:57] dispersed abroad he hath given to the
[1:14:59] poor his righteousness remaineth forever
[1:15:04] so this is a righteousness on Earth in
[1:15:06] other words we're seeking God God who
[1:15:07] can I give today what Al should I give
[1:15:11] this week or next week or this year
[1:15:13] right so the Bible says look you know
[1:15:16] this you know the the more you give to
[1:15:18] people the more righteousness you
[1:15:20] develop in your life I love that illust
[1:15:23] you know uh when you give to others when
[1:15:27] you give to others in this world it
[1:15:29] makes you it does the opposite instead
[1:15:32] of you know your hands want to hold on
[1:15:33] to it right that's what we all want to
[1:15:35] do right in part of our flesh we just I
[1:15:37] want to get every penny I can I want to
[1:15:38] hold on to everything I can but Force
[1:15:41] but but giving forces you not to not to
[1:15:44] grab it all in but to give it out
[1:15:46] hallelujah amen right like in our in our
[1:15:49] sinful nature we want to get as much as
[1:15:51] I can I I want to hold it in
[1:15:53] but the the the the spirit of Christ
[1:15:56] makes you want to give it out Hallelujah
[1:15:58] am does you want doesn't make makes you
[1:16:00] want to not hold on to everything it
[1:16:02] makes you want to empty out brother says
[1:16:04] that's right amen amen
[1:16:06] hallelujah brother said we should be
[1:16:08] trying to get we should empty out to be
[1:16:10] ready for the Rapture praise God Amen
[1:16:12] and this is a perfect example of that
[1:16:14] see we're not holding on we can't take
[1:16:16] anything with us when we die praise God
[1:16:19] right so we should be constantly trying
[1:16:20] to give out of course we have to have
[1:16:22] savings the Bible talks about
[1:16:23] grandparents can give to their
[1:16:24] grandchildren there's a great balance in
[1:16:26] that christans grandparents are really
[1:16:28] good at that they saved and they were
[1:16:30] able to give you know certain money to
[1:16:31] each grandchild right so that that's
[1:16:34] something as well you want to you want
[1:16:36] to save for all these purposes but here
[1:16:38] as you as you learn to give right as you
[1:16:41] learn as we learn more righteousness in
[1:16:43] giving to others it helps us not to hold
[1:16:45] on to the things of the world because we
[1:16:47] can't take them with us anyway praise
[1:16:49] God naked we came in this world naked
[1:16:52] will return right our bodies will go
[1:16:54] back to the Grave right but our soul
[1:16:56] will go to meet Jesus amen the righteous
[1:16:59] one who made us righteous amen
[1:17:01] hallelujah that's that that's just a
[1:17:03] good reminder about you know you can
[1:17:05] increase your righteousness in other
[1:17:06] words you can die out more to yourself
[1:17:08] you can obbey the Holy Spirit more as
[1:17:10] you give to
[1:17:11] others
[1:17:13] amen now here's a good one too Titus 3:4
[1:17:16] Titus 3 4 and
[1:17:19] 5 so I want to spend most of the service
[1:17:21] on this idea of rightousness
[1:17:26] here Titus
[1:17:31] sorry there we go Titus 3:4 but after
[1:17:35] that the kindness of the love of God our
[1:17:38] savior toward man appear now that's of
[1:17:40] course after all our all our sins in
[1:17:42] verse three now verse
[1:17:45] five not by works of righteousness which
[1:17:48] we have done but according to his Mercy
[1:17:50] he saved us by the washing of
[1:17:53] regeneration and the renewing of the
[1:17:55] Holy Ghost so this is about that
[1:17:57] righteousness you have in
[1:17:58] heaven the the giving and seeking God
[1:18:01] that's the righteousness you develop on
[1:18:02] Earth but here Paul's talking about the
[1:18:04] righteousness in heaven we're not saved
[1:18:07] by our righteousness we're saved by
[1:18:09] Christ righteousness right but then he
[1:18:11] washes you on this Earth and he makes
[1:18:13] you live like he lived on this Earth and
[1:18:16] that's having more of the righteousness
[1:18:18] of the character of Christ in our lives
[1:18:19] now right amen see and the reason I'm
[1:18:22] saying this church cuz some churches
[1:18:23] will say you know I I've I've got
[1:18:25] accused of this recently uh some people
[1:18:28] online call me a legalist cuz I was
[1:18:29] remember I put up that video about the
[1:18:31] 25 rewards you can earn remember that
[1:18:32] video somebody asked me for a list of
[1:18:34] that I think Zur asked me for a list of
[1:18:35] that too that was a wonderful blessing I
[1:18:37] I love that message and but somebody
[1:18:40] tried to accuse me oh you're a legalist
[1:18:41] you're trying to earn salvation and what
[1:18:43] I told them was you don't understand
[1:18:45] there's two types of righteousness
[1:18:47] there's a righteousness I get in heaven
[1:18:48] not by my works but then there's a
[1:18:50] righteousness Christ gives me as he
[1:18:52] molds my character right like brother
[1:18:55] said he said may God in this new year
[1:18:57] shape Our Lives by self-control amen
[1:19:00] amen I can control this old sin nature
[1:19:03] and bring it into obedience to Christ
[1:19:05] hallelujah
[1:19:07] amen so that that's sad they just don't
[1:19:09] understand that and I think I wrote back
[1:19:11] to the the precious person I said I'm
[1:19:13] sorry you don't understand the Bible I
[1:19:15] said you're focusing on one verse what
[1:19:16] about all these others that promise Us
[1:19:19] rewards what about where Jesus said you
[1:19:21] should you should invest in your talent
[1:19:23] because I'm going to ask you what did
[1:19:24] you do with all the talents I gave you
[1:19:26] what works do you have what proof do you
[1:19:29] have that you invested in the all the
[1:19:31] talents that I gave you right what about
[1:19:33] those
[1:19:34] verses so see it's without understanding
[1:19:37] Church what I found is this like Jesus
[1:19:39] said and just like the Bible said most
[1:19:41] people few people are there are that
[1:19:44] actually find the narrow road that leads
[1:19:46] to
[1:19:47] life right very few people will actually
[1:19:50] find the narrow road that leads to life
[1:19:53] and a lot of these people they lash out
[1:19:55] at me or lash out at us they lash out us
[1:19:57] because they've been hurt by their
[1:19:59] previous pastors right or people in
[1:20:01] their family and they r at a church that
[1:20:04] was like a Brandon worship church so sad
[1:20:07] Wicked or tape only church you know or
[1:20:11] they had a church would say a
[1:20:12] denomination where uh it was a
[1:20:15] legalistic preacher and he was trying to
[1:20:17] get them to do works works without even
[1:20:18] their souls being
[1:20:20] saved right what is it uh there's that
[1:20:25] one uh oh yeah it's the Jehovah's
[1:20:26] Witnesses the reason they go door to
[1:20:28] door Church you ever have they ever
[1:20:30] knocked on your door brother B yeah amen
[1:20:33] sister the Jehovah's Witnesses ever
[1:20:34] knocked on your door at least once once
[1:20:37] Jose okay so I I saw that on the
[1:20:40] online they are only promised eternal
[1:20:43] life if they go to so if they go to as
[1:20:45] many doors as they possibly can that's
[1:20:47] why they do that because they they
[1:20:49] they're taught if you don't do that
[1:20:51] you're lost
[1:20:53] see now that's a works-based
[1:20:56] Salvation
[1:20:57] right now the truth of that is we're
[1:21:00] saved by the grace of almighty God
[1:21:04] Amen and then but the the the other side
[1:21:06] of that if we don't do what call what
[1:21:08] God called us to do we lose our reward
[1:21:11] but not our
[1:21:13] Salvation that's the truth of that
[1:21:15] church right is that right yes if God
[1:21:18] called somebody to go door to door they
[1:21:20] better go door to door or El they're not
[1:21:22] getting the reward that they supposed to
[1:21:24] get right if God called me to preach and
[1:21:27] Pastor the church and I fail to passor
[1:21:29] this church shame on me I lose my reward
[1:21:32] as long as my heart is right I still get
[1:21:34] saved at the end so as long as I Repent
[1:21:37] of my sins I still get
[1:21:38] saved hallelujah amen so that's the
[1:21:41] balance of that so that that's why
[1:21:42] sometimes we got to preach all these
[1:21:44] scriptures that's why people make these
[1:21:45] harsh comments because the the
[1:21:47] conditions that they've been brought up
[1:21:49] in were very awful spiritual conditions
[1:21:52] like the Bible said a lot of them were
[1:21:54] in cages of unclean and hateful Birds
[1:21:57] imagine that imagine going to church at
[1:21:59] a Catholic Church where there's abuse
[1:22:00] going on and it's just you're you're
[1:22:02] going to church and they hate going to
[1:22:04] church because they're in a cage of
[1:22:06] unclean and hateful Birds well see
[1:22:08] that's awful we ought to be thankful we
[1:22:10] can come and we're in a church fill with
[1:22:12] dubs yes amen we're in a church fill
[1:22:16] with Lambs
[1:22:17] hallelujah hallelujah that's why all the
[1:22:19] preachers come and say we love your
[1:22:21] worship you got you got
[1:22:23] the sweetest Church you know have the
[1:22:24] sweetest people you want to have because
[1:22:27] we don't have a cage of unclean hateful
[1:22:28] Birds we've got a cage of
[1:22:30] doves or we got a flock of lambs
[1:22:34] here amen hallelujah praise God see
[1:22:38] we're not saved by our righteousness but
[1:22:41] in our daily lives we're trying to bring
[1:22:43] our our our mind into the law of the
[1:22:45] Holy Spirit the law of the spirit of
[1:22:47] life to make us live more like Christ on
[1:22:49] this Earth
[1:22:51] amen and that's that's what the Holy
[1:22:53] Spirit does it brings us balance to all
[1:22:55] these
[1:22:55] scriptures okay now Hebrews 11:7 let's
[1:22:58] look at
[1:22:59] Noah Hebrews
[1:23:14] 11:7 I love the Hall of Fame of Faith
[1:23:20] Hallelujah and church I'll say like this
[1:23:22] there's a place for you in that Hall of
[1:23:23] Fame as well praise God there's a place
[1:23:25] in there Hallelujah when we stand behind
[1:23:28] or stand beside rather the heroes of the
[1:23:30] faith praise God Hebrews 11:7 by faith
[1:23:33] Noah being warned of God of things not
[1:23:35] seen as yet moved with fear now that's
[1:23:38] Godly fear prepared an ark to the saving
[1:23:41] of his house by which he condemned the
[1:23:45] world and became heir of the
[1:23:48] righteousness which is by faith
[1:23:50] hallelujah amen see the righteousness
[1:23:53] which is by faith so faith is just
[1:23:56] Assurance right revelation of what God
[1:23:58] wants you to do because he had Faith he
[1:24:01] was a righteous man the Bible said he
[1:24:03] was also a preacher of righteousness
[1:24:05] amen amen that's right I think that's in
[1:24:07] uh it's not in Hebrews I think it's in
[1:24:09] Genesis he was a preacher of
[1:24:11] righteousness so he preached let's live
[1:24:13] a righteous life let's get in the ark
[1:24:15] amen Let's Escape salvation isn't that
[1:24:17] what we preach as well praise God Let's
[1:24:19] Escape the tribulation Let's Escape the
[1:24:21] mark of the beast Hallelujah let's get
[1:24:23] into Christ let's be ready for the
[1:24:25] return of Christ let's meet Jesus in the
[1:24:27] air at his Rapture praise God let's be
[1:24:29] ready for the wedding ceremony praise
[1:24:31] God and if we're ready for that we'll
[1:24:33] also enjoy the wedding reception and
[1:24:35] then the wedding honeymoon praise God
[1:24:37] amen amen praise God because he had
[1:24:41] Faith he was righteous and then he was
[1:24:44] an heir of the blessing of God
[1:24:47] hallelujah he inherited he had
[1:24:49] inheritance because he had faith in
[1:24:51] God's word amen now what does air mean
[1:24:55] one who receives by lot or a
[1:24:58] portion in the Messiah the Messianic
[1:25:01] usage it's one who receives his allotted
[1:25:04] possession by right of sunship so that
[1:25:08] that's how it applies to our lives We
[1:25:10] Are All Sons and Daughters of God and so
[1:25:12] our heavenly father has an inheritance
[1:25:14] to give us praise God
[1:25:17] Amen so Noah was an heir of
[1:25:21] righteousness he was an heir of
[1:25:23] believing he was a child of God so God
[1:25:27] gave him God gave him a lot Hallelujah
[1:25:30] God gave him a reward for his labor
[1:25:33] Hallelujah that's what we see today by
[1:25:35] God's grace now let's look at a few more
[1:25:38] here on this uh topic this is a a very
[1:25:40] good topic let's go to James 2 verse5
[1:25:43] we're already in Hebrews let's go to
[1:25:44] James 2
[1:25:49] verse5 Hallelujah James 2 verse5
[1:25:54] hearken my beloved Brethren ha not God
[1:25:56] chosen the poor of this world rich in
[1:25:59] faith and hes of the Kingdom which he
[1:26:03] promised to them that love him so we're
[1:26:06] now with this idea of heirs right we
[1:26:09] have something we're going to inherit
[1:26:10] from our father most of the people that
[1:26:13] inherit from God the Father are poor
[1:26:16] people they're not the wealthiest Of The
[1:26:18] World God doesn't choose many wealthy
[1:26:20] people because they Trust in uncertain
[1:26:23] riches they're not they're not quick to
[1:26:26] give out they're quick to grab and and
[1:26:29] greedily keep to
[1:26:30] on so here we see Noah was an heir of
[1:26:33] righteousness but then God mostly
[1:26:36] chooses naturally poor people to be his
[1:26:39] heirs amen think of that this this world
[1:26:42] is fighting for uh you know millions of
[1:26:45] dollars and billions of dollars for
[1:26:47] homes that are eventually going to burn
[1:26:48] right but we get Mansions the Bible says
[1:26:52] that have no ending praise God they
[1:26:54] never get dust in them there's there's
[1:26:56] no moth and dust and rust in heaven
[1:26:58] praise God hallelujah when we get to our
[1:27:00] future home there's streets of
[1:27:02] transparent gold praise God the streets
[1:27:05] are made of gold but there's never going
[1:27:07] to be any dust there's never going to be
[1:27:08] any maintenance Gru to fix the roads in
[1:27:10] heaven praise God but who inherits those
[1:27:14] those who are poor many times poor in
[1:27:16] this life Hallelujah but they were rich
[1:27:18] in faith hallelujah amen amen amen God
[1:27:21] could teach them to live a more
[1:27:23] righteous life and they could live
[1:27:24] righteously in this present World
[1:27:27] amongst many unrighteous people praise
[1:27:31] God
[1:27:33] Amen the Bible also says let's go to
[1:27:36] this one yeah back to Titus 3:7 I wish I
[1:27:38] just would have stayed there but Titus
[1:27:51] 3:7 I really enjoy this bible study on
[1:27:53] righteousness praise God hallelujah amen
[1:27:57] Titus 3:7 so we just read five let's
[1:27:59] read six which he shed on us abundantly
[1:28:02] through Jesus Christ Our
[1:28:04] Savior see that that Mercy that washing
[1:28:08] that righteousness is shed upon you
[1:28:10] abundantly by Jesus Christ I'm glad God
[1:28:14] gave me abundant Mercy that's what I
[1:28:16] need I need abundant Mercy praise God
[1:28:18] Amen Hallelujah verse seven that being
[1:28:20] justified by his grace not by my works
[1:28:22] by
[1:28:23] Grace unmar a gift we should be made hes
[1:28:27] according to the hope of eternal life so
[1:28:30] see we're saved by grace and we're given
[1:28:33] an
[1:28:34] inheritance hallelujah amen I'm saved by
[1:28:37] grace I didn't earn it now usually we
[1:28:39] think you know we got to we got to earn
[1:28:41] it in order to have a reward right
[1:28:43] that's normally what we think but not
[1:28:45] with salvation because brother tells us
[1:28:47] even though the foolish virgin will lose
[1:28:49] all their reward they still are heirs to
[1:28:51] one thing how many remember what he said
[1:28:53] they're HS to what they're HS to eternal
[1:28:56] life amen hallelujah although they
[1:28:59] squandered much of their lives you know
[1:29:01] they have no reward but they still are
[1:29:04] heirs to something they're heirs to
[1:29:06] eternal life praise God am think about
[1:29:08] Saul again my goodness think about lot
[1:29:12] he at least stood up against the
[1:29:13] homosexual gender he at least stood up
[1:29:16] with it and called it wickedness well
[1:29:18] he's got he's got some inheritance he's
[1:29:20] got eternal life praise God MH the Bible
[1:29:22] called him a just man remember Church
[1:29:24] let's let's always remember his
[1:29:26] testimony he chose to every day live in
[1:29:29] torment now our lives should be
[1:29:31] different like Abraham we should not be
[1:29:33] living in torment we should be living in
[1:29:35] the peace of God yes amen there is no
[1:29:40] price you can put on peace like one time
[1:29:42] I watched a video of Tom Brady uh and
[1:29:45] all these other famous guys and they're
[1:29:46] like they're like wow you have millions
[1:29:48] of dollars you have a beautiful wife uh
[1:29:50] you've won all these Super Bowls are you
[1:29:52] content and in every case they said no
[1:29:55] this this didn't make me happy I watched
[1:29:58] that video Deion Sanders he thought once
[1:30:00] I win the Super Bowl I'll be happy and
[1:30:01] you know what after he won the Super
[1:30:03] Bowl you know what he did he took his
[1:30:04] car brother B and he tried to commit
[1:30:05] suicide he drove off the cliff but God
[1:30:08] stopped him there and he didn't
[1:30:10] die this is how empty these people are
[1:30:13] you know the devil likes them trying to
[1:30:14] tempt us well if you just had more this
[1:30:16] and more money and more houses lands and
[1:30:18] we'd be more happy no sir no sir it
[1:30:21] actually makes you more uh it makes you
[1:30:23] more uh selfish it makes you more
[1:30:27] discontent right because I mean they're
[1:30:29] on the interview saying that and all
[1:30:31] these rich people say all these
[1:30:33] millionaires they say I wish I never
[1:30:35] would have got famous because now I have
[1:30:36] no privacy I can't even go to the store
[1:30:38] people are begging me all the time for
[1:30:41] uh autographs and all these things like
[1:30:42] that they said I wish they said uh I
[1:30:44] wish I never would have got rich like
[1:30:46] this and
[1:30:47] famous my what what what good lessons to
[1:30:50] learn at the beginning of the Year
[1:30:51] Praise praise God to to be content with
[1:30:53] the things that we have praise God and
[1:30:56] to remember Hallelujah if we have the
[1:30:58] righteousness of Christ if we have God's
[1:31:00] abundant Mercy Hallelujah we should be
[1:31:03] the happiest people because we know our
[1:31:05] inheritance isn't on this side our
[1:31:07] inheritance is on the other side praise
[1:31:09] God amen amen hallelujah I'm I'm I'm not
[1:31:12] telling you not to increase your
[1:31:13] business or increase your investment
[1:31:15] that's not what I'm saying I'm saying is
[1:31:17] what I'm saying is that we should not
[1:31:18] ever think that our we're actually going
[1:31:20] to be satisfied with attaining worldly
[1:31:23] things on this Earth we will never be
[1:31:25] satisfied with things on this Earth we
[1:31:27] don't put our hope in this world we put
[1:31:30] our hope in Jesus Christ amen amen so
[1:31:34] see if we are Justified this is why
[1:31:35] foolish virgins have an air an
[1:31:38] inheritance the Bible said if we're
[1:31:40] Justified we're hes that I'm going to
[1:31:43] read that again being justified by his
[1:31:44] grace we should be made HS according to
[1:31:46] the hope of eternal life all these
[1:31:49] things all these uh all these uh
[1:31:51] accomplish m to the world they never
[1:31:53] satisfy there's no righteousness in them
[1:31:56] praise God there's only righteousness in
[1:31:58] Jesus
[1:31:59] Christ
[1:32:00] Hallelujah just a good emphasis on these
[1:32:03] scriptures now go to Hebrews 1 verse2 I
[1:32:05] want to show you of course I want to
[1:32:06] remind you who inherits all
[1:32:09] things Hallelujah Hebrews 1 verse
[1:32:16] one God who at sued times in diverse
[1:32:19] manner spake in time past under the
[1:32:21] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[1:32:24] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[1:32:26] he hath appointed heir of All Things by
[1:32:30] whom also he made the world praise God
[1:32:33] Amen the Bible says God lets Jesus
[1:32:37] inherit all things think about that the
[1:32:39] Universe the worlds the future home
[1:32:42] Hallelujah the Earth Jesus inherits all
[1:32:45] things and then he gives out your
[1:32:49] inheritance as well based upon your
[1:32:51] obedience to him praise God hallelujah
[1:32:54] back to the parable of the
[1:32:56] talents Hallelujah let me pull that up
[1:33:01] there the Bible says that if we overcome
[1:33:04] remember if we overcome in our age we
[1:33:07] inherit the Tree of Life escaping the
[1:33:10] second death we eat the hidden Mana the
[1:33:12] white stone with a new name power to Ru
[1:33:15] rule over Nations think about that which
[1:33:17] one of us you think would rule over
[1:33:18] Nations the Bible said the most humble
[1:33:20] of us
[1:33:22] yeah it's the most humble the Bible says
[1:33:25] the least esteemed in the
[1:33:26] church right the least
[1:33:29] esteemed think about that I wonder which
[1:33:31] one of us are going to rule over the
[1:33:33] area of North America the
[1:33:36] Nations right the Bible said you'll rule
[1:33:39] over Nations if you can overcome sin now
[1:33:41] he makes you a ruler over a nation so if
[1:33:44] you don't if you and I don't get elected
[1:33:45] as present which we never will be we
[1:33:47] don't have to worry about that God could
[1:33:49] still have us rule over a nation one day
[1:33:51] yes MH amen amen because why because of
[1:33:53] the righteousness that we have now in
[1:33:55] Christ Jesus we're living a righteous
[1:33:58] life
[1:34:01] now we've just seen it this week
[1:34:03] remember did you see how they released
[1:34:04] some of these names that were going off
[1:34:05] to these evil Islands you know these
[1:34:06] were leaders of Nations Bill Clinton
[1:34:09] yeah right leaders of Nations caught
[1:34:13] with the unrighteousness of the sinful
[1:34:15] world but you and I if we have the
[1:34:17] righteousness of Jesus Christ we won't
[1:34:19] rule over Nations now we'll over them
[1:34:23] later right because we turned down sin
[1:34:26] we we uh we avoided sin we overcame
[1:34:29] Hallelujah by the grace of
[1:34:32] God also Saints we get the Morning Star
[1:34:35] we get white rment white clothes
[1:34:38] Hallelujah we get our name in The Book
[1:34:41] of Life the last book of life we become
[1:34:44] a pillar of the temple of God in the New
[1:34:47] Jerusalem we get Jesus's new name we get
[1:34:50] God's new name name we get the new
[1:34:52] Jerusalem's new name written upon us and
[1:34:55] we sit with Jesus in his
[1:34:58] throne sometimes it just seems
[1:35:00] impossible how is this all going to
[1:35:01] happen to me I don't know I don't know
[1:35:03] how it's going to happen to you and I
[1:35:05] but if we live righteously the Bible
[1:35:06] said eyes not seen ears not heard all
[1:35:09] the things that God has in store for
[1:35:11] them that love him praise God Amen I
[1:35:14] don't know how God God's going to do it
[1:35:15] but God said he do it praise God Amen so
[1:35:18] what are we living by we're living by
[1:35:20] the promise of God amen amen almost an
[1:35:24] hour and 10 here so bear with me
[1:35:27] here let's remember
[1:35:30] church if you are faithful over five
[1:35:32] talents and you get 10 talents he makes
[1:35:34] you ruler over 10
[1:35:36] cities Hallelujah Luke
[1:35:42] 19:17 Jesus says the Overcomers get
[1:35:45] power over the Nations I would think
[1:35:47] Martin Luther is going to rule over many
[1:35:50] nations because he defied he defied
[1:35:53] Italy and Rome brother Jose amen and he
[1:35:56] was from Germany too I I think he might
[1:35:57] rule over Italy and Rome in
[1:36:00] Germany because he defied those Nations
[1:36:03] those kings and the pope and everything
[1:36:05] he defied all of them and he
[1:36:08] overcame this man will rule over Nations
[1:36:11] and the Bible said he'll rule with a rod
[1:36:13] of
[1:36:14] iron Hallelujah so God has Jesus has
[1:36:17] many rulers beneath his rulership As We
[1:36:21] Know
[1:36:24] hallelujah what wonderful promises now
[1:36:26] let's go back to I'm going to close this
[1:36:28] thought maybe give me five or 10 minutes
[1:36:29] to close I going to close with this
[1:36:31] thought on Romans 8 let's go back
[1:36:33] there
[1:36:37] Hallelujah now we're at 8 verse well I'm
[1:36:41] just going to skip ahead here because I
[1:36:43] don't want to read through all that I'll
[1:36:44] read through that Lord will Sunday or
[1:36:45] next
[1:36:46] uh Monday or next Wednesday
[1:36:49] sorry I find this verse here yes go down
[1:36:53] to Romans 8:17 I'll close with this
[1:36:55] close with a few thoughts here by God's
[1:37:00] grace there's so many wonderful things
[1:37:02] in the Book of Romans as I showed you at
[1:37:03] the beginning brother used Romans for
[1:37:05] many of his important
[1:37:09] sermons even with the fist seal he used
[1:37:11] Romans chapter n so Romans 8:17 and if
[1:37:15] children then
[1:37:17] heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ
[1:37:21] if so be that we suffer with him we may
[1:37:25] also be glorified together now here's
[1:37:28] the hard part of being a Chris the
[1:37:29] suffering yes yes none of us we want we
[1:37:33] want to know him in the pover
[1:37:34] resurrection as Paul said but we've also
[1:37:36] got to know him in the fellowship of his
[1:37:38] sufferings and that's the suffering you
[1:37:40] get for being a Christian the rejection
[1:37:41] from F friends and family most
[1:37:44] notably right or other church friends or
[1:37:46] being rejected by other
[1:37:48] churches or even Sinners and heathens
[1:37:51] whenever we're rejected or or uh
[1:37:53] mistreated by people just for being a
[1:37:55] Christian the Bible said that's the
[1:37:57] suffering we must go through in order to
[1:38:00] one day reign with
[1:38:02] Christ Hallelujah I'm going to read 18
[1:38:05] as well just to encourage you anybody we
[1:38:07] know I know we got some people suffering
[1:38:09] physically uh and that's also part of it
[1:38:11] as
[1:38:13] well but remember Verse 18 for I reckon
[1:38:16] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:38:18] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:38:21] glory which shall be revealed in US
[1:38:24] praise God amen amen amen praise God the
[1:38:27] suffering cannot even compare to the
[1:38:30] glory that's in front of us and I'm
[1:38:31] going to use this example again brother
[1:38:33] amen being rejected by his family think
[1:38:35] about that the suffering of being
[1:38:37] rejected now of being just kicked out of
[1:38:40] your
[1:38:41] house saying I don't want anything to do
[1:38:43] with you the suffering of that is not
[1:38:45] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:38:48] our brother will receive from Christ
[1:38:51] amen hallelujah praise
[1:38:54] God the suffering of being rejected it
[1:38:57] cannot
[1:38:58] compare you know as as as our brother's
[1:39:01] been rejected here on Earth well then
[1:39:02] surely then he'll be accepted in heaven
[1:39:05] there'll be a great welcoming for our
[1:39:06] brother amen that that's his testimony
[1:39:09] that's his God God wrote that testimony
[1:39:12] before the foundation World God ordained
[1:39:14] this testimony
[1:39:16] amen no matter how we're rejected down
[1:39:18] here we will receive the reward up in
[1:39:21] Heaven praise
[1:39:22] God Hallelujah the sufferings now are
[1:39:25] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:39:28] which will be revealed in
[1:39:30] US think about that church the Bible
[1:39:33] said you're a joint air with Christ how
[1:39:35] many how many understand that joint air
[1:39:37] let me look up that word joint I don't
[1:39:38] remember that if I looked that one up
[1:39:40] yet I don't think I defined that
[1:39:43] one joint air means a fellow Heir one
[1:39:46] who obtains something assigned to
[1:39:48] himself with others
[1:39:51] a joint
[1:39:53] participant Hallelujah so that means we
[1:39:57] get some of the rewards that Christ gets
[1:40:00] because Christ suffered and overcame we
[1:40:02] get rewards if we suffer and overcome
[1:40:06] amen I think even brother brother Jose
[1:40:08] you know he's got to he stands he's the
[1:40:10] only one in his family standing for this
[1:40:11] message right that there's suffering
[1:40:14] that goes along with that you've had
[1:40:15] many difficult conversations with your
[1:40:17] family right brother yeah yeah thousands
[1:40:20] yeah
[1:40:22] numerous times we prayed for you brother
[1:40:23] for those for those conversations we
[1:40:26] know you're going to go have we know
[1:40:27] you're going to have them but the
[1:40:29] suffering of this present world isn't
[1:40:31] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:40:32] that we shall share with Christ so
[1:40:35] because we've stood for Christ we we we
[1:40:38] stood against friends and family that
[1:40:40] the Bible says we receive a reward with
[1:40:44] Christ we're joint HS we both we both
[1:40:47] inherit something for
[1:40:49] overcoming this reminded me of 1 Peter
[1:40:52] 3:7 you that are married the Bible says
[1:40:55] you both get rewards you get a joint
[1:40:58] reward together for your ministry
[1:41:01] together 1 Peter 3:7 likewise ye
[1:41:04] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:41:06] knowledge giving honor unto the I'm
[1:41:09] sorry yeah giving honor unto the wife as
[1:41:11] into the weaker vessel and is being a
[1:41:13] together of the grace of
[1:41:16] life so there's rewards Vang and CIA are
[1:41:19] going to are going to earn together
[1:41:22] because they they worked on through the
[1:41:23] family together in each married
[1:41:26] couple see so I I love this God gives us
[1:41:29] rewards on Earth for those of us who are
[1:41:31] married because we work together with
[1:41:33] our spouse but all that is is a
[1:41:35] foreshadowing of Christ in the church
[1:41:38] hallelujah amen hallelujah what the
[1:41:40] Bible say There's No Greater Joy than to
[1:41:42] see your children walk in the truth
[1:41:44] right amen amen so when we see our
[1:41:46] children serve God that's a reward you
[1:41:48] that's a blessing and the reward goes to
[1:41:50] the parent
[1:41:51] well the same thing is true with Christ
[1:41:52] and the church praise God hallelujah as
[1:41:55] the bride is faithful to the husband
[1:41:57] Christ then there'll be a reward shared
[1:42:00] because it's a marriage they did things
[1:42:02] together amen church if I ever did
[1:42:04] anything good for God it was because
[1:42:05] Christ was in me praise God it wasn't
[1:42:07] because of my goodness it's because of
[1:42:09] my faithful Lord my faithful Savior
[1:42:11] praise God remember he said apart from
[1:42:13] me you can do nothing but if we ever
[1:42:15] accomplish something it's because our
[1:42:17] husband worked through US praise God
[1:42:19] amen amen amen
[1:42:21] because Christ was working in me the
[1:42:23] hope of glory praise God Amen yes so see
[1:42:26] we're join a just like a husband and
[1:42:28] wife inherit certain things because we
[1:42:30] work together we labor together we serve
[1:42:32] God together so it is with Christ in the
[1:42:35] church I was just remind this I heard A
[1:42:37] good sermon yesterday uh I was listening
[1:42:40] to brother Donnie preach and of course I

[1:44:16] to me today you have another chance to
[1:44:19] feed Jesus
[1:44:21] how do I feed him when I feed the least
[1:44:24] of his Brethren I've done it unto Jesus
[1:44:28] that was such a fresh reminder to me
[1:44:29] yesterday like oh my goodness that's
[1:44:31] right I can I can do something good for
[1:44:34] Jesus if Jesus is here but amen uh and

[1:45:45] right hand Come Ye blessed are my father
[1:45:47] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[1:45:49] from the foundation of the world see
[1:45:50] these are the these are the foolish
[1:45:51] virgins that there was a kingdom
[1:45:54] prepared for them because they inherited
[1:45:56] eternal life yeah and they get to be
[1:45:58] part of the kingdom of God for out for
[1:46:01] for throughout all eternity they get
[1:46:03] they have a part they have a lot in this
[1:46:04] Kingdom remember brother R said the
[1:46:06] bride is with Jesus throughout all
[1:46:08] eternity he said but the 144,000 are
[1:46:11] servants to the bride amen think about
[1:46:13] that everybody has a degree everybody's
[1:46:15] going to have a position in heaven the
[1:46:17] wise virgins they're going to be the
[1:46:19] bride the foolish virgins are not going
[1:46:20] to be the bride according to the Bible
[1:46:22] looks like they'll be the attendance to
[1:46:24] the bride y right now the millenniums
[1:46:27] hold separate thing I'm not sure exactly
[1:46:29] how that works out but we know what the
[1:46:31] future home entails the Bible said will
[1:46:33] ever be with the Lord hallelujah amen
[1:46:35] right 144,000 servants to the
[1:46:39] bride look at this here he
[1:46:43] says because he tells the foolish
[1:46:45] version because I was hungry and you
[1:46:47] gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave
[1:46:49] me a drink I was a stranger and you took
[1:46:52] me in naked and you clothed me I was
[1:46:55] sick and you visited me I was in prison
[1:46:58] and you came unto me praise God
[1:47:00] hallelujah we have a chance today to
[1:47:02] feed Jesus to visit Jesus
[1:47:06] Hallelujah of course he's represented in
[1:47:08] his children praise God Amen that's
[1:47:11] right joint ears the Bible says we are
[1:47:14] joint hirs and then God will reward us
[1:47:17] for anything we do for his body for his
[1:47:20] people what a promise how many enjoy
[1:47:21] that promise today let's stand to our
[1:47:23] feet by God's gra brother amen if you'd
[1:47:24] like to come
[1:47:30] here I'm going to read this last quote
[1:47:32] brother R uses the joint airs in the
[1:47:34] Ephesian Church age chapter one and this
[1:47:38] is under the the the section where it's
[1:47:40] Revelation 2 to him that overcometh will
[1:47:42] I eat of the tree of life which is in
[1:47:45] the midst of the paradise of
[1:47:47] God and brother Ram says this and now to
[1:47:51] these sons of God who by him overcome
[1:47:54] are given the privilege of the paradise
[1:47:56] of God think about that we live in
[1:47:58] Satan's Eden right now but if we're
[1:48:00] faithful to Christ he'll give us a
[1:48:02] paradise Hallelujah to live in amen
[1:48:06] amen now I I might I might say this
[1:48:09] sometimes our services feel like
[1:48:11] paradise sometimes fellowshiping with b
[1:48:13] and amen and all the same sometimes
[1:48:15] fellowship with him out there feels like
[1:48:17] paradise so we get a foraste of Glory to
[1:48:20] line here but after we pass on to the
[1:48:23] next Dimension with our new bodies the
[1:48:25] Bible said we inherit the paradise of
[1:48:28] God we get a perfect atmosphere to live
[1:48:31] in Hallelujah a perfect home perfect
[1:48:35] family perfect Fellowship that's the
[1:48:37] reward we get for overcoming the wicked
[1:48:40] one
[1:48:41] now he says he says and we get the
[1:48:45] constant Fellowship of Jesus
[1:48:48] Christ now he remember I'm getting to to
[1:48:50] Joint air so keep that thought joint air
[1:48:52] you inherit with Jesus so you get
[1:48:54] fellowship with Christ that's part of
[1:48:55] your reward I don't know how he's going
[1:48:57] to do it with all these millions of
[1:48:58] Christians brother B but I know if
[1:49:00] anybody can do it he can do it how's
[1:49:02] Jesus going to fellowship with you and
[1:49:03] me and each one of us I don't know but
[1:49:05] all things are possible amen hallelujah
[1:49:08] he'll do it he'll fellowship with us by
[1:49:11] God's
[1:49:13] grace there will never be any more
[1:49:15] separation from
[1:49:17] him wherever he goes the bride will go
[1:49:23] amen what what is his he shares with his
[1:49:27] beloved on a joint air
[1:49:30] relationship that's why he shares the
[1:49:32] the rod of iron see that that's why he
[1:49:34] shares he has a rod of iron but he
[1:49:35] shares that Rod of
[1:49:37] iron
[1:49:40] Hallelujah the secret things will be
[1:49:42] revealed the dark things will be made
[1:49:44] plain we shall know as we are known
[1:49:48] Hallelujah we'll know all the secrets of
[1:49:51] History right and people will know us by
[1:49:54] what we are we're a seed of Christ we're
[1:49:57] a child of God hallelujah we're a joint
[1:49:59] air with
[1:50:01] Jesus we shall be like him this is the
[1:50:04] heritage of the Overcomer who has
