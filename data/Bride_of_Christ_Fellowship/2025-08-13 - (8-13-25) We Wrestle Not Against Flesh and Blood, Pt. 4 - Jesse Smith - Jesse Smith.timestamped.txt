[0:00] and faithful servant, diligent, a good
[0:03] man, a wise man, a fruitful woman, or an
[0:07] overcomer. Hallelujah.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[0:10] come. Hallelujah.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Can everybody see the thought tonight?
[0:20] &gt;&gt; There's no wrestling match God will put
[0:23] you in that you can't overcome. Now
[0:25] church, some of them are serious.
[0:28] Like let's say the loss of a loved one,
[0:29] right? Let's say somebody unexpectedly
[0:32] dies in your life. That's a that's a
[0:34] hard one to overcome because that's what
[0:35] Job got. Remember Job?
[0:38] He lost all of his children. That was a
[0:41] difficult wrestling match. But you know
[0:43] what was harder than that? When he lost
[0:44] all of his children and then he lost all
[0:46] his money and then he lost his good
[0:47] health. That was one of the hardest
[0:50] wrestling matches. But did Job overcome
[0:53] or not, church? Amen.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; He overcame.
[0:56] Hallelujah. And if Job overcame, we can
[0:59] overcome our trials as well.
[1:02] Hallelujah. How many feel like you're
[1:04] going to do better with your wrestling
[1:06] match tonight by God's grace? I do. I
[1:08] can't lose. Brother Chris, we can't
[1:09] lose. The gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:11] against us. It's impossible
[1:14] because the enemy is not strong enough
[1:16] because the God that's in us is greater.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that tonight?
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:27] Father, we thank you for the word of God
[1:28] tonight, Lord God. Lord, thank you for
[1:31] these scriptures, Lord God, reminding
[1:33] us, Lord God, that we can live the word
[1:34] of God. We can overcome by the word of
[1:37] God. You're not going to give us a
[1:38] temptation we can't overcome. You're
[1:40] always going to make a way of escape out
[1:42] of the wrestling match.
[1:44] Lord, I've watched I've watched real
[1:46] wrestling matches
[1:49] where a a person might be on their back,
[1:51] but they escape out of it. Hallelujah.
[1:54] Somehow they they they find enough
[1:56] strength or a technique to get out of
[1:59] that. Lord, that's what you've done for
[2:00] us, Lord God.
[2:02] And Lord, as we saw tonight, it's owning
[2:04] our sin gets us out of the out of the
[2:07] grip of Satan. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:09] Jesus. May each person own their sin,
[2:12] Lord God. confess it and they'll get the
[2:14] victory. They'll find the way of escape
[2:17] in the wrestling match. Lord, I was
[2:18] moved this week when I heard that
[2:20] preacher say,
[2:22] "Many will have the root of bitterness
[2:25] in the book of Hebrews 12."
[2:28] And Lord, we've seen bitterness, Lord,
[2:29] in our church year after year, time
[2:31] after time. We haven't had to deal with
[2:34] sexual sin necessarily.
[2:37] Maybe people suing each other. We
[2:38] haven't had to do that. But Lord, many
[2:40] people will be overcome with the root of
[2:43] bitterness. Many are defiled that way.
[2:47] Oh God, Lord, may each wrestler here
[2:51] tonight, hallelujah, in the spiritual
[2:52] realm, may they find the way of escape,
[2:54] Lord, from that hold. Oh God, may they
[2:57] not be choked out.
[2:59] Or Lord, maybe it's hopelessness
[3:01] tonight. Maybe it's fear about the
[3:03] future tonight.
[3:05] As we said, maybe it's lustful thoughts,
[3:08] lustful actions,
[3:10] maybe it's financial burdens,
[3:12] discouragement,
[3:14] maybe it's oppression, as brother Ram
[3:16] talked about,
[3:18] a cloud that just kind of hangs over
[3:20] people's human spirit, and it comes in
[3:22] like waves in and out like waves of the
[3:24] sea,
[3:26] bringing discouragement. Oh God,
[3:29] hallelujah. But may each person remember
[3:31] that greater is the word that's in them
[3:35] than their human flesh that's in the
[3:37] world. Hallelujah.
[3:40] Lord, encourage us tonight that we don't
[3:41] have to lose the wrestling match. We
[3:43] were actually made to win every
[3:45] wrestling match. Hallelujah. We don't
[3:47] have to be chunked out and lose the
[3:49] battle, but we can get the victory
[3:50] tonight by owning our sin.
[3:53] Realizing if there's a sin, it's our
[3:55] fault. And we can make it right by the
[3:58] blood of Jesus Christ. And we can be an
[4:00] overcomer once again. Grant it, Lord.
[4:04] Thank you, God, that the gates of hell
[4:06] will not prevail against this word
[4:07] bride. Hallelujah. And there'll be a
[4:09] seat for her to sit by you, Jesus. Oh,
[4:13] God. Hallelujah.
[4:16] Lord, if that's what I'm to be on the
[4:17] day of judgment, just to be a humble
[4:19] little pastor that served God and never
[4:21] quit, and you can raise me up against
[4:23] people that did quit, then that's fine.
[4:24] That's enough for me, Lord God. Or
[4:27] raised my wife and I up when when people
[4:30] made wrong choices regarding their
[4:31] family and made excuses and didn't serve
[4:33] the Lord because of the family size,
[4:35] then God, then just use me for that
[4:37] purpose, Lord God, if that's your will,
[4:38] Lord God. Or maybe it was people that
[4:41] wouldn't serve you in college, but yet
[4:43] you helped me to do it, Lord God. They
[4:45] just made excuses. Well, in college, I
[4:46] was too busy or I had sports or school
[4:49] or I couldn't wear the right clothes
[4:50] because of college and the pressure. But
[4:52] yet, Lord, you gave me grace to do it,
[4:54] Lord God. Not I, but the grace of God
[4:56] that was with me, Lord God. Whatever
[4:58] little testimony, God, you can gain from
[5:01] my life. Help me to wrestle and overcome
[5:04] that I can have a seat at the throne of
[5:07] the Lord Jesus at the white throne
[5:09] judgment. that I'll not be out there
[5:11] among the sheep as a goat, but I'll be
[5:13] seated in judgment with the Lord Jesus.
[5:16] Lord, each one of us desires that
[5:18] tonight. Lord God,
[5:21] may every person here, Lord, win the
[5:23] wrestling match in order to sit by
[5:27] Christ
[5:28] on the throne. Make us overcomers. I
[5:31] pray that we'll take the word of God and
[5:33] overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[5:36] Lord, bring conviction, Lord God, and
[5:38] also bring forgiveness, Lord, when your
[5:40] people repent. Give victory, give joy,
[5:42] Lord God, when people repent, and give
[5:44] them strength to win the wrestling
[5:46] match.
[5:47] May they be strong in the Lord and the
[5:49] power of his might. Hallelujah. And
[5:52] having done all, may they stand back on
[5:54] their feet, ready to fight off Satan in
[5:57] Jesus.
