praise the Lord how many glad to be in church yes sir amen amen it's good good to see everybody amen praise the lord it's been some sometimes but God knows all things amen we've couldn't have got together anytime sooner than this amen this is God's we have to believe his perfect will amen and that's our desire is to be in the will of God you know if you have your Bibles let's go to um Luke chapter 15 Luke chapter 15 Luke chapter 15 and let's start reading at um verse 11 the Bible says he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of my give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living verse 14 and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want amen may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats you know um we're grateful for the grace of God and all that the Lord has done and and is doing you know because he's a a merciful god Even in our wrongs his judgments are righteous you know for God's his plan is always to keep us nearer to the Cross you know and and and and tonight I want to use for a thought hidden desires hidden desires now I'm sure uh uh most of you are familiar with the story of the prodal son but we want to dive into his life you know because I believe it's it's relevant to our children our young people you know our people at the church that we fellowship with even even young and old you know and um you know the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you know but this is this this is so uh uh key for this very thought right here because you take a father and a mother who's doing everything they can do to raise their child right but that child has hidden desires and you know that that that father and that mother takes that child of church why for the benefit of their being Hallelujah for the benefit of their their future and even their present but that child has hidden desires and you know that that father you know he'll go out and work and maybe he'll establish a business and and and pull his son along and that son will go out and work with his father and still have hidden desires you know that that mother will you know uh teach her daughter how to cook and and you know how to clean and all the things that'll help her be a good wife or a good mother but she can still still have hidden desires and you know it's going to come an appointed time that either everything you will Tau for the good you're going to live into or everything you're Desiring is going to pull you away from it you know so I'm here to say tonight that let your desires be led by God because the thing see church I want you to understand desires can be desires of good and desires can be desires of evil Hallelujah and you may be thinking you say well brother DS I'm just thinking about it as a man thinketh in his heart so is he Hallelujah and church you may not realize young people you may not realize just turning to look at it Hallelujah will have an effect to draw you now as you read the Bible we go into the Bible we know the story of of of Abraham and lot now lot was in the family of Abraham Hal and just because he knew Abraham God extended him favor but lot had hidden desires oh my lot had hidden desires and the first opportunity he got Hallelujah those desires start to manifest and it was something simple they were on the journey what kind of Journey they were on they were on the Journey of God hallelujah the devil had no place until lot gave him an opportunity as long as he stayed with what God wanted his desires had no effect on him Hallelujah are you with me and church H H uh if if if we look and something arose where you know lot begin to ponder and pretty much find a way to fulfill what he was thinking about the opportunity came where he says okay I I kind of want to separate from Abraham he just a little too churchy he's just a little too messy or believer he's like okay you know I've been in this all my life but I I want to live my desires and the first thing he does he comes to Abraham with an agreement hallelujah how often we do that with the Lord Lord if you bless me with this I will this Hallelujah let me tell you Church firsthand that's not good to make Bargains with God because one thing you fail to realize God is going to keep his side of the bargain and if you don't then God has a right to judge you based upon you not fulfilling your part of the contract Hallelujah that's why when you do business is always important to have a contract because some people's word just like us means nothing sir Hallelujah they say well brother brother brother they say uh brother Jesse I'm going to make it to the meeting gave out their word and the time came for church to start at 3:00 there were nowhere to be found or they had some kind of excuse their desire probably was to stay home all alone Hallelujah and church you know our word hallelujah has to mean something when it comes to God you know our word has to be able to rise above how we naturally feel amen and you know you look at lot and lot he says he says to Abraham hey you know there's a lot of green land over here why don't you let me take this and you take that and because Abraham had no hunger for anything else he said you decide Hallelujah Abraham was content living in the Providence of God see his desire was to fulfill whatever God had for him he wasn't looking for a way out Hallelujah two years later after Co some people still haven't gotten their way back on why because of their desires H hidden desires and Co just made an opportunity for them to skip church and never come back some of them are still skipping down the yellow brick road Hallelujah but one thing they F you know the story of of of of of of of Dorothy Hallelujah the wizard of ozs and all these things what was the name of that thing yeah had a wizard of O Okay Hallelujah you know the story of The Wizard of ozs and the yellow brick road and one thing they fail to realize that a witch was also on that road so why there Dorothy skipping down the road and she got her shiny shoes and everything that her desire Hallelujah was going to lead her also to a witch down her path and she didn't realized that that witch was a part of her path which was a part of her desire and church lot he says lot says to Abraham I'mma go this way and you stay you stay over here and then the Bible says hallelujah he pitched his tent toward Sodom he wasn't in Sodom yet he wasn't in in the world yet but as he pitched his tent Hallelujah to look at all these rappers and singers and Taylor Swift and all these other people just to look at them it begin to pull them into something they were always craving he wasn't in Sodom but just looking at it had a pull on it and you think about it every night he would go to sleep and he couldn't but see Sodom because his tient was pitched that way and if your life is H your desires are all about the things on Tik Tock and Facebook and IG and Twitter and all these other things that the world has to offer is going to pull you into ungodly desires come on because you're looking at it Hallelujah you're looking at it and what is going going to do is going to Hallelujah feed that unconverted part of you and all of us have an unconverted part of us it's called your flesh Hallelujah everybody in here with the Holy Ghost has a measure of uncon conversion in them it's called your flesh Hallelujah and as long as we are in flesh we have to protect our desires we have to protect our cravings and our wants and our longings because if you don't those things will lead you away from God now you fast forward years later he went from just looking at Sodom to now being the governor his hidden desires he wanted to be somebody great but he was already great as long as he stay with Abraham Hallelujah you think about all the time Abraham spent Hallelujah sewing into lot's life lot had hidden desires but Abraham had to let him go you know some parents we have to let you go go ahead and be great Hallelujah go ahead and live your best life and that best life will lead you into things Hallelujah that you could only imagine Hallelujah I'm here to say hallelujah your parents they are not the enemy cuz it's like this when you were babies Hallelujah and you was walking cross across the street they held your head and they protected you amen young people how many have ever known that protection of holding the hand of your parent guiding you from all danger and hurt and harm amen we can amen that you know there were stages of our life that our parents were our protectors and we knew it Hallelujah amen young girls run up in your father's arms and give you a hug because you felt safe hallelujah or your mom will pick you up and carry you over this because you felt safe now I want to I want to say to you when did that ever change when did the protection from a mother or father change concerning you it changed when you wanted to stop being protected it changed when you wanted to fulfill your own desires but let me say it Hallelujah mother and father is still have the have the HH the the desire to protect you it's just that there's things that you want they don't want so now it becomes a constant Battle of who's stronger H when all mom and dad is trying to do is still protect you now you would say as a young person Amy man I'm walking with mom mom is good she's holding me and a big old school bus is coming down the dirt roll and Mom snatches you back so you don't get hit when have we ever seen Mom Hallelujah saw a child in front of that bus we've never seen it there's something in that parent to protect Hallelujah there something in a father to protect there's something in a mother to protect God put that in you Hallelujah because your child you children cannot protect yourself you need the wisdom of God to intercede Hallelujah and I ain't goingon to be long don't get nervous but I want you to appreciate Hallelujah the care of a loving house you know you take a young man and he said well I'm I'm 6' two and you know and I'm tall dark and handsome and I'm single and ready to mingle and Dad may be like son you don't want what you think you want cuz you will find a girl who's 5 foot4 that'll bring that 6 foot2 to your knees Hallelujah have you crying for days hallelujah and vice versa Hallelujah he's tall dark and handsome and that's exactly what I think I want no you don't cuz tall dark and handsome may have you Angela Becky Simone and everybody else all at the same time you find yourself in a circus because you had hidden desires but what I want you to see see church is because of Lot's desires he put his own family in danger now he has to raise children in Sodom H now his wife has to be subject to all the other things going on in Sodom how did he get there lot desires of looking at it now everybody either has to conform to Sodom or stand their ground that they will talk with Abraham and here we are Hallelujah here we are as Believers and young people I want you to understand you can stand your ground and still be loved Hallelujah you can stand your ground and still have friends Hallelujah I know a young lady at my church Hallelujah me and her had a conversation one time and she was like you know well I I'm I'm the only one of my age in our church and I really don't have no friends and my thought to her was if you you get saved and really give your life to Christ Christ will give you friends and she took that advice Hallelujah she took that advice she she really got consecrated with God and serving the lord and singing and praying and dressing right and everything and every time you turn around somebody's following her to church Hallelujah adults are following her to church young people are following her to church the managers on her job are following her the church what is it they see somebody who desires to be right in God's eyes and if you desire to be right in God's eyes God will fulfill your desires God will give you real Christian friends that'll produce Christian happiness Hallelujah cuz I have brothers I go shoot basketball with Hallelujah and we don't have to take an alcohol break we don't have to take a smoke break we don't have to take a porn break or none of these things no we enjoy one another we talk about God we shoot ball and when it's over with God bless you let's try to do it again everybody's happy Hallelujah but you know in the world there'll be a it'll be a different atmosphere you fou me desire is to fight I I must admit I have a desire to fight too the devil Hallelujah you thought I was going to say my sisters and brothers no I got one person I want to fight and one person only and his name is the devil he don't like me and I don't like him and he's proving over and over again that that he don't like me because every opportunity he get church let me let you pulling real good because a lot of things are coming to me right now Church you watch desires and you watch how they'll pull you and put you in captivity you think about a church a good desire is to want a mate Hallelujah and Samson wanted a mate but he went about it the wrong way and he didn't listen to the protection of his mother and father why you want one of the girls down at the because I want a wife and Dad's like wanting a wife is good but stay with your own kind but he let his hidden desires pull him into something Hallelujah that would eventually destroy him and he was so blinded by his desires he couldn't even see that the woman he was in love with was trying to kill him young people say amen you know the story of Samson don't you Samson was a strong guy but he was weak up here hallu he could he could lift up buildings and you know say who want to fight me but he was so messed up up here he couldn't even see that the girl he would tell his secret to every time he tell her she go do it he said tie me up and I'll lose my strength she said say tie you up Samson I love you he wake up the next day tied up yeah what kind of love is that come on perverted love he was so messed up his desires had him so messed up he couldn't even see that the girl he was dating any opportunity she got to kill him she was going to do it that's the way of the world the Bible comes and says the kill Ste destroy H sir let me fall back a little bit brothers mothers it's important to compliment your children Brothers it's important to tell your daughters that they're beautiful your hair is long and it's beautiful and you are my little pumpkin spice it's important to tell him that H you are my Queen of Sheba it's important to make her feel giddy around you it's important Brothers Hallelujah to make your daughters blush to make your wives blush Hallelujah if if your daughter never see Mama's happy she won't desire a marriage it's very important Hallelujah Sisters For You Hallelujah to compliment your son say you are my little David Hallelujah you are my giant killer Hallelujah you are my prince in shining armor nobody can do what my boy can do it's very important Hallelujah you are so handsome Hallelujah you said brother what do you mean Hallelujah because she and he desires compliments and young man and young woman Hallelujah young girl father if you compliment your daughter when that snake comes around when that young man comes around with a good compliment you are so beautiful and she'll say I know my daddy tells me all the time Hallelujah you're not saying anything I haven't heard before so you can't make me blush h you say oh yeah but hey look here I got a Corvette what about your daddy Hallelujah no he has a minivan and we love riding in it Hallelujah and vice versa Church Hallelujah mothers you compliment your son and you tell him hallelujah how handsome he is how strong he is so when a girl comes around and says I need a strong man in my life he'll tell her I'm committed to my household Hallelujah I'm putting my strength back in my family Hallelujah so these things are needed that we can keep the desires Hallelujah of worldism suppressed until they get the Holy Ghost cuz you can't fight these things without the Holy Ghost they overcome you again Samson tie my roope behind my back l whatever wake up the next day Rose toe behind his back grab the gates run up the city and now he's playing a game with death and don't even realize it that he's giving himself over to play with the devil and you are not a match to play with the devil Hallelujah see in his match in his playing with the Devil the Bible says that he got weary yeah Samson got weary he got tired of playing with the Hallelujah and the only thing he could do was just now spill his whole heart and he told his whole secret he told all of his desires everything that God he gave her his strength when it was a a covenant between her him and God and after he gave it to her Hallelujah because he was so locked up in her beauty locked up up in who she was locked up in just the chase I got a worldly girl I got a worldly boy I got something you know how it is you get to a certain age you be like hey I'm just so sick of just being good I want to be bad what does bad look like every day Joseph walks in and there's another man's wife just Hallelujah but he had other desires Hallelujah he had a desire to fulfill God's will in his life Hallelujah that's the only way you can fight the devil is if you're hungry for something greater than what you're going through Hallelujah cuz that hunger will keep you going Hallelujah but if you ain't got no fight you will succumb to the pressure everybody else is having fun so why should I I tell a story Hallelujah don't get nervous I'm about close tell a story I know a girl who's 18 years old when we just sung some nice songs some of you knew the songs but wasn't singing you know but and even the words were up here you still wasn't singing Hallelujah but you know we were singing some nice songs and I know this young girl was 18 years old she sung in the choir all these things this one day they went to a meeting like they always do went to the meeting she walked up with the choir like she always do and before she could get to the mic she dropped dead right there in church at the meeting in this message Hallelujah she dropped dead right there in church and you can think about everybody was just like what's going on everybody's Whispering that's what the devil want he want to be whispering about your life oh I what I what she did what's happening to her right now and it was a brother told me everybody me back up somebody who had experien with God he got down and he told everybody just bow your heads got down start praying for her right there in the meeting started praying for and she came back Hallelujah death has no power if your heart is Right 18 God gave her another chance but what I love about the church when she got up she didn't go back to her seat she went up there with the choir and stood up there and worship Hallelujah now some of you if that would have happened to you you would have been so embarrassed you would have left and went and sat down but this girl said I'm going to give God some praise cuz I should have been dead but God raised me up and now I'm going to lift my voice Hallelujah I've been Touch by a fire come and watch me burn Hallelujah she got up and worship with the church like she always did Hallelujah but now she has a testimony they get back to the church they're having testimony service about the services and how God touched their lives and they get to her she stands up Hallelujah this was Tuesday now the next service at their Church from Saturday to Tuesday what is that four days now when it comes to to her everybody's testifying when they get to her she stands up and smiles and says I thank God for being here and drop dead in the church but this time she ain't get up hallu Church she was supposed to go the first time she dropped dead but God being so merciful Hallelujah he gave her four days to get her life right Hallelujah nobody else knew what was going on but after she passed Hallelujah everybody knew Hallelujah that God gave her a chance to get her life right because her countenance was like the countenance of an Angel sitting in church Hallelujah this was a different death from the first death this death was a death of Lord I'm ready at 18 years old so don't play with your desires she didn't know that day that she was going to drop dead Hallelujah but when God gave her a second chance she took full advantage of it huah what about you young person how many of you amen and and I'm I'm about to wind this down how many of you Hallelujah have been like this prodical Hallelujah raised in a good house amen had good parents Hallelujah but all along this young man Hallelujah had hidden desires he he was waiting on a certain age maybe 18 or or 19 or 21 and you know I know the girls according to the law 18 classifies you as a woman hallelujah oh my Hallelujah without Christ all 18 is a all 18 is and what it means is a right f for the devil to beat you up Hallelujah cuz as soon as you step from behind that headship soon as you step from behind that protection of the household of a good Christian mother and father Hallelujah then you open yourself up for the enemy for target practice and if you don't have Christ in you you will not [Music] survive you know uh Brother Andy

people who don't believe I'm in the message never heard brother brandham say any of this of course not he wasn't talking to you hallelujah amen listen listen what the prophet of God says young people listen to me good he says you make yourself when you're young anybody young in here you make yourself when you're young Hal Hallelujah he says you set your Ambitions to what you want to do your desires Ambitions deal with your desires Hallelujah I was I was uh watching the documentary of a soccer player and his father started him playing when he was very very young Hallelujah Left Foot Right Foot Left Foot Right Foot Left Foot Right Foot so much to it was like second nature so playing with the kids that were his age was no match cuz he spent so much time Hallelujah fulfilling listen to me filling the father's desires and I've gone to Canada and see kids just big with skates and a hockey stick what is it fulfilling the father's desires and if they could do that on a carnal natural level fulfilling the father's desires what what about us what about us hallelujah with a Bible in your hand filling the father's desires With a Song in your heart fulfilling the father's desires with a prayer in your mouth fulfilling the father's desires what about us if not now then win Hallelujah church he says you set your Ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life Hallelujah that's how a nurse becomes a nurse because of her Ambitions right she doesn't say I think I'm I think I'm GNA be a nurse and then she goes online and fills out a applications and says oh thank God I'm a nurse no she has to work towards that goal she has to take tests she has to go through clinicals and do all these things to show that she's worthy of becoming that title Hallelujah and and on and on and on a ball player a doctor a lawyer whatever it is you have to put time in to achieve hallelujah what you're craving after and it's the same thing with God you want a good life in Christ you have to spend time with that desire and I want to encourage you even when I was in the world Hallelujah and doing things I I shouldn't I shouldn't have been doing I always had something inside that said one day I'm going to be serving the lord and you know brother Jesse at times it will seem like I'm crazy because we supposed to be hanging out and doing our dirt and I said y'all know what one day I'm going to be a Christian they like man ain't nobody want to hear that let's let's do what we doing but there was something on the inside Hallelujah that sin couldn't get rid of hallu Hallelujah the things of the world couldn't fully suppress and let me tell you something you may be in sin you may not be fulfilling everything that you want to fulfill according to God but let me say this the devil don't know that Hallelujah the devil doesn't know what's in your heart Hallelujah all he can do is act by what you give him and that's why he watches the kind of music you listen to when ain't nobody at home and you change the dial Hallelujah from Maverick City you change from Maverick to something else I ain't going to let the blood hound get too loose in here hallelujah and you know and all the things of your cravings and all that it starts to come out you being the house doing your little Tick Tock dance and parents you may not understand where we at with your kids do Hallelujah if you ain't careful they'll have you on Tik Tok and don't even realize it friends come over you answer the door and they just start laughing cuz your child made a video about you hallelu hallelujah oh my but these cravers and these desires Hallelujah the enemy doesn't know who you are until you show it you know there's a man in the Bible call I think his name was Joseph they call him a secret believer came a time where they needed somebody to carry the cross he was folling falling testimony of Jesus Christ following and following in one day Hallelujah he had the opportunity to carry the cross Hallelujah he had the he had the opportunity Amen to be identified with what was happening Hallelujah you know what that was always his desire Hallelujah that was always in his heart he wanted to do something for Christ Hallelujah and now the opportunity yeah he was way off and nobody knew who he was but then the time came for his desires to be fulfilled and he took full advantage of it hallelujah it's time for some of you to take full advantage of it h oh you go through the Bible and you look some of the mightiest people God used he used them at the age of a teenager eler teenager David teenager you just take those two h huah David turned the kingdom upside down why because he had no fear and he didn't care what his brothers thought about him church he even Rose above how his parents thought about him oh my you might say brother I'm in the house and my parents don't serve the Lord that didn't stop David remember when Samuel came to the house he came to anoint a king why wasn't David notified all the other boys were there but David you know why his own father didn't believe in him his old father couldn't see him being King but God did and God made everybody wait till David get there God rejected everything one by one one by one one by one and then he tells Samuel the king is in this house don't you move till he get here we going to keep the anointing in the church until you get anointed Hallelujah we going to keep the worship in the church until you worship Hallelujah we going to keep the word preaching the church until you receive it Hallelujah we're waiting on you to take your place Hallelujah you may be the savior of the house hallelujah hallelujah and then you know uh Samuel said you got to have one more boy cuz God ain't never lied to me Hallelujah God has always always told me truth I know you got he say do you have one more he said yeah but but but he he out there in the field Samuel say go get him cuz I ain't leaving till he come hallelujah how don't y'all young people I want you to understand God is waiting on you you might have an anointing in your life that set kingdoms free David had an anointing in his life that showed Scaredy Cats scar those Hallelujah who was afraid to fight that how easy it is when you trust God you don't realize that go back and read it after Goliath went down everybody like after Goliath went down everybody else Drew courage where did it come from it came from David's Victory and some of you young people got victory that your peers need to see cuz it's going to give them strength Hallelujah some of you young ladies living right now living virtuous it'll give some of your friends in church the courage to say if she can do it I can do it hallelujah it's just that simple sometimes it's like a chain reaction I was in Canada preaching like I'm doing right now to a group of young people anointed by God like it is right now Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit fell and while while the Holy Spirit fa one sister she said Lord this say God have brother de come pray with me that I receive the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and I didn't know anything about it but all of a sudden I found myself over in the corner praying for this sister what was it God was fulfilling her desire hallelujah oh my how do I know that cuz I met her last year Hallelujah 15 years later and she said

preaching and walking all the way back preaching and walking all the way back and next thing you know my hand is on a shoulder praying for what was it it was the same [Applause] God hey I'm not making this stuff up Hallelujah I've seen him do it I've seen him bring courage to the young people hallelujah where they can live above the reproach of what's going on in the world let me finish up what I say we're going back to Mark I I mean Luke 14 let me finish reading this quote he said you achieve in life he said you think of it and as you think of and as you think of course your mind it presents it it presents it into your mind by an unknown something that dominates your your mind see your cravings and your desires you think on it long enough it will dominate you I'll be the first one to say my thoughts have dominated me sometimes I sit at the table and I'm like I sure would like a piece of chocolate cake and that's all I here and then that desire begins to drive me where I know I can get it go to Leela she has fresh baked chocolate cake so I jump in my car and now I'm being dominated by a craving hallelujah oh my just ate a full course meal really don't need it but I'm being dominated by my desire and I don't stop until what I get chocolate cake it's the same thing spiritually the things you think about will dominate you until you get it in your grasp Hallelujah think on Hallelujah today I want you to think on Deliverance seek on faith SE on the grace of God seek on him as a Healer seek on him as a savior and let those thoughts dominate you and see if Christ won't meet you see if your thoughts won't pull you into his presence see Hallelujah that desire for healing won't meet you Hallelujah I got a desire to be debt free and I'mma keep confessing it until it's manifest Hallelujah cuz I believe he's he's in all areas of our life that we give to him Hallelujah some of you have desires for children he's God hallelujah he's God I seen him do it Hallelujah listen say it dominates your mind and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that's what I begin to do tell my friends one day I'm going save fully manifesting it not just going to church no my heart's going to change my Cravings going to change because I've seen it real Hallelujah let me tell you something parents your children know if you real or fake they know if you really really got something or you just putting on for the church Hallelujah and if you just putting on it trust they ain't Des that Hallelujah but if it's something real Hall and I'm I'm going take I'm going to take you in my world for a second hallu it was days where I got up and I was going to do something I met up with my mom because I was out on my own met up with my Mom hey Mom I need a my car broke down said M I need to use your car sometimes because we Southern we cut our words in half and I don't realize y'all ain't understanding what I'm saying you know we say water instead of water we say car instead of car we say four instead of four so let me slow it down so you can catch me hallelujah hallelujah if you can't if I'm going a little too fast you say I'm G pray that God speed up your ears Hallelujah but you know Hallelujah I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm bringing you into my world when I was a young guy Hallelujah and you know I I told my mom one day my car was broke my car was broken down and I said Mom I need to use your car she said no I said Mom I got to go to work I need to use your car she said no and I asked her again I said M you you want me to lose my job I need to use your car she said okay but let me tell you something I had a dream last night that you asked me for my car I gave you my car you got to work you locked the keys up in the car the car was running and the music was playing as loud as can be I'm like Mama please just give me the keys mama please just give me the keys and sometimes your kids are like that you're trying to tell them hallelujah what you see and they're like Mama daddy please not me not me I ain't I ain't doing that I ain't the one and the worst one is I know I know that you don't know nothing let me tell you something if you were raised in a Christian house when it comes to the world you are target practice you are a Sitting Duck Hallelujah the young boys are looking at you and they playing a game they say I'll be the first one to get it Hallelujah same thing with the boys these young girls are looking at you and they say man he don't have any tattoos no earrings or nothing he I bet you he'll treat a girl right oh girls you thought you were the only ones under pressure no these boys are under pressure too Hallelujah but then I go to work get the car get the keys go to work and it was a cold day so I go out to warm up the car Hallelujah and then I hear the car running I can hear from inside the building so I run back out pull on the door locked and Jonas he was playing as loud as can be oh I wasn't wear I was supposed to be then but God had a saved person in my life Hallelujah who was standing in the Gap and pulling me in Hallelujah and when that happened I was like she just told me this was going to happen and now the car is running and I'm like do call it home nobody answer the phone the car car sound like about to blow up music loud locked and then I had to get my component let's be honest young people you are really listening let's be honest you know what the devil looks like and you know what God looks like let's be honest you really do want the best life which is Christ so there are times when you're really really paying attention but Paul says to do or to perform I know not how to do it h so it will take a measure of God's grace to fulfill it and in that moment I calmed down and I said hey now this ain't the first time she didn't told me something and it come to pass so subliminally I was listening but I couldn't tell her that cuz then she'll think I was a Christian well I was a Believer and I ain't I ain't no believer I got my own mind and now I'm sitting there I'm I'm I'm I'm on the outside of the car thinking like what I'mma do like smoke coming out the back of I said man what did I do when she told cuz I had start to listen I said I think I think I unlock the pass the door so I walking around sometimes you be out there all by yourself nobody but you and your thoughts and the manifestation of what's about to happen and I walk around the pastor the door around I pull the door and it came open and I was like inside I was doing this but I couldn't let nobody know I appreciate God so you know what I did I opened the door I looked to the entrance of the warehouse nobody was looking there was nobody else out there with me and I look up to the sky and I say thank you Jesus I was a secret believer but I had a desire to believe Hallelujah and that was just one time of many that Fe like that happened to me to walk me down that's why parents is very important to keep your stand I'm not talking about a stand of I'm the head and you tell me no the life you live it's very important that they see you love living the life you live Hallelujah and that's what I saw Hallelujah and and over time Hallelujah that life that I saw begin to be a craving and I start to say like Elvis I want my mom my God y know that that's what Elders he really wanted to be saved but he was so caught up in his worldly desires he couldn't get there just like a lot of other people hallelujah Whitney Houston don't you realize Hallelujah her singing and everything started where in the church God gave her an anointing for what worship tell you a story of another friend of mine Hallelujah from Germany everybody all right friend of mine from Germany he got tired of the message he's like man I'm sick of it it's a young guy he's like I'm sick of this I'm going to live my life I'm going to the world Whitney Houston was coming to Germany he said you know what I'm going to listen to the American I'm going to sing with Whitney and that's what he was thinking he said he get to the concert bought his ticket he's sitting up in there with all these worldly people he gets out he say Whitney comes out and he's like man we F we going to have a Time he comes out and she said y'all know what I was raised in church and tonight I'm only going to sing gospel songs you can run from God but he'll always find you Hallelujah and look that night Whitney Houston led him back to the Lord oh Lord and she couldn't even get her own self right but just like God say I'll use pharaoh to show my glory let me finish this so we can get out of here by God's grace listen this young man the Bible says that he uh it say not many days after the young son gathered together all and took his journey into a fair country and there he wasted his substance with riotous living what is riotous living excessive eating and drinking a life of luxury that's what he was doing like they say in the world he was balling out balling out H nobody couldn't tell him he was a big baller he was a triple OG big baller Hallelujah Bing out buying us buying that probably had on a rope ho A Hallelujah had on expensive spray and everything and nice shoes and all that he was rightous living he was just fulfilling all the things that he wanted to do even though he grew up in a Christian Home see that's why it's very important to be converted or to get converted because when you get control of over your life your desires is going to take over I'm going tell on myself before I get out of here I didn't finish college you know why I had too much power brother what do you mean I'mma tell you my turning point I was in class one day and I needed to go do something and I asked the teacher I said hey Miss s so can I go do such and such you know I get back and get to work this and that blah blah blah she says you can do whatever you want to do you paying for her me I'm I see you tomorrow I see you next week I see you next month I ain't never coming back and that's what happen I had too much power for my own good Hallelujah so in the times of your life come on musicians in the time of your life where you can be sheltered by the love of God take that shelter where you could be sheltered by the grace of God and the enemy is he can't get to you real real easy rejoice in that because if you're not converted your worldly desires will take over and they'll destroy you this young man all his righteous living and all that he say after all his we know the story after all his substance was gone he got so low remember he was he was the uh uh the man of the party he was the life of the party everybody loved him when he was issuing out that money he you know they probably wrote the song I got the Benjamin for him and you know he was buying us buying drinks and doing everything eating food you know they was eating uh shrimp and Camari they was eating everything steak and lamb they was eating it all and he was paying for everything probably eating sushi Fresh Off The Grill I know some of y'all thinking you don't eat sushi off the grill I do eat no raw fish my Sushi got got lines on it Well church you think about it Hallelujah this young man after he just spent up everything he got so low he had enough to feed himself now he got so low he found himself in a pig pin the Bible says swine swine is pigs hogs you ever roll past a hog pin and the smell of it he found himself down there F to eat with him that's how low his desires brought him did he know that was going to happen just by fulfilling his desires no see that's the trick of the devil he never tells you how far he's going to try to take you but then he came to himself and he begin to remember where he came from he said you know what what my father got servants that Liv in better than us and he said you know what I'll go back home when I'll say Dad just let me be a servant but when he came back home H what was that that was the father's desire now the father's desire is going to take over Hallelujah and all he wanted was just to come home but the father's desire was to want to treat him like the son of a king hallu now the father says go get a robe go get a re kill a Fatt calf I'm going to show my son hallelujah how life is really supposed to be and that's what that father does hallelujah that father Hallelujah brings that son into his kingdom into his thoughts into his desires into his love and that's what Jesus Christ has done for us he's brought us into his kingdom Hallelujah so don't let your desires make you miss the boat because God has so many good things planned for you Hallelujah it'll just blow your mind Hallelujah we thank God Amen let's pray Lord we love you thank you we give you praise Lord for you're such a good God lord and Lord just to be able to look back on our lives Lord and see how you protected Us and how you help us from all hurt harm and danger Lord God we just pray father God that
