[25:51] grace Ephesians 3:14 and

[27:27] hallelujah it's joy unspeakable and full
[27:29] of Glory Hallelujah and we're grateful
[27:31] to be here tonight Lord let your Holy
[27:33] Spirit have its way we ask it in Jesus
[27:36] Christ's name the Saints said amen God
[27:39] bless you as you're being seated there
[27:40] praise
[27:41] God hope you had a good week in the Lord
[27:44] um you know I put out that seven
[27:46] Thunders video uh you know yesterday and
[27:49] I got some good feedback course there's
[27:50] some uh you know disagreements too but
[27:52] on this one I'm open to disagreements
[27:53] you
[27:54] know and I've had good conversations
[27:56] with others you know that uh that we
[27:58] know that personally disagree and it's
[28:00] all been good and um reminds me of the
[28:03] book of Acts you know Paul and Barnabas
[28:04] were like I'm not taking Mark and I'm
[28:06] taking Mark and they just the contention
[28:08] was so uh was was so real that they just
[28:11] decided not to go together so we can
[28:14] have Holy Ghost filled saints that just
[28:15] don't see things uh you know the exact
[28:19] same way but how many know the Holy
[28:20] Ghost will guide us into all truth
[28:22] praise God hallelujah I believe that by
[28:24] God's grace and so we just want to keep
[28:25] a right Spirit praise God and as you've
[28:28] as you've heard me say you know I just
[28:29] want to be open to all the Revelation
[28:31] that the Holy Ghost has for us praise
[28:33] God church if I know if I'm on my knees
[28:35] every day asking God for Revelation to
[28:37] forgive my sins and reveal yourself to
[28:39] me I believe you'll give it to me praise
[28:41] God don't you because the Jesus said
[28:44] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[28:46] everything else will be added unto you
[28:48] praise God so I just believe that with
[28:50] all my heart if we're really in in one
[28:52] Accord with the Holy Ghost and our lives
[28:53] are cleaned out and surely God will
[28:55] reveal more of himself to us Hallelujah
[28:59] so you want to look at this here uh by
[29:01] God's grace the Christian family now
[29:02] part one we looked at the father as the
[29:04] commander he's the blessed man who seeks
[29:06] God first uh he seeks the right way for
[29:08] the family of course the wife's a part
[29:10] of that but he's got to be the leader
[29:12] the husband meets the wife's needs by
[29:14] love he's he's moved by love as Christ
[29:17] loved the church amen and then we looked
[29:20] at the calling uh for children with
[29:22] couples some are called to have children
[29:23] lots of children some medium and some
[29:26] none we saw that from the scripture then
[29:28] we looked at the responsibility of the
[29:30] children they have a responsibility
[29:31] before God in part two we looked at our
[29:34] house uh our houses should serve the
[29:36] Lord Joshua said as for me my house will
[29:38] serve God in other words we're producing
[29:40] something right we should produce faith
[29:42] in Christ we should produce Onward
[29:44] Christian Soldiers amen hallelujah uh as
[29:48] Jesus said the Bible said about Jesus I
[29:50] must be about my father's business so
[29:52] we're in a spiritual business our homes
[29:54] are producing something for the glory of
[29:56] God hallelujah and it's spiritual
[29:58] Warriors in this life and then we looked
[30:01] at how one thing we should seek in our
[30:02] homes is peace in Zechariah remember it
[30:05] said uh have peace in your Gates and
[30:07] judgment and in your Gates so we must
[30:09] have peace in the home in other words
[30:11] able to forgive Hallelujah able to uh
[30:14] not let uh evil feelings right get uh
[30:18] complexes on us right we must not get
[30:19] complexes or strongholds we must cast
[30:22] them down for the glory of God Amen and
[30:24] the Holy Ghost brings three things one
[30:26] of those is peace the other one is
[30:28] righteousness and the other one is Joy
[30:31] right it's not the kingdom of God is not
[30:32] in meat and drink those are all Shadows
[30:35] right those are all things that uh that
[30:36] we must do you know we must have some
[30:38] type of a health and diet and so forth
[30:41] but the real kingdom of God is in
[30:44] righteousness peace and joy Hallelujah
[30:46] that's what it produces and then we
[30:48] finish part one by looking at the five
[30:50] needs of the husband that the wife
[30:52] should meet by the Holy Spirit right and
[30:54] we saw all those from scripture now
[30:55] there could be more than five I think
[30:56] five is a good number it's late laboring
[30:58] Grace Hallelujah and as couples they
[31:01] should labor to love one another by
[31:03] God's grace amen now here we let's look
[31:06] at part three that's a very short
[31:07] summary I'm going to try to keep those
[31:09] shorter by God's grace I want to look at
[31:11] a little more on uh the role of
[31:13] parenting here tonight and then just I
[31:15] want to look at a few more thoughts and
[31:16] I like to close with those thoughts I
[31:18] mentioned on Sunday about brother Dennis
[31:20] McBride's sermons some scriptures that
[31:23] he brought out and then some other ones
[31:24] that as I've studied uh I found to be uh
[31:27] very helpful uh by God's grace so let's
[31:30] go to Proverbs 226 most of you if I
[31:32] start reading this you know you'll be
[31:33] able to recite
[31:35] it right the Bible said train up a in
[31:39] the way that it he should go and when
[31:40] he's old he will not depart from it
[31:43] praise God so I just want to start with
[31:45] that verse there and look at the
[31:47] training uh you know it just means to
[31:49] train uh in the Greek or in the Hebrew
[31:51] rather it's just a simple word doesn't
[31:53] have many different definitions it's to
[31:55] train and of course that means to teach
[31:57] right to show by example Hallelujah and
[32:01] that's what you know that's how the
[32:02] oldfashioned days were you know before
[32:04] this modern Industrial Age most people
[32:06] were agricultural right as Agricultural
[32:09] Society so the children would just grow
[32:10] up and the the brothers or the boys
[32:12] would take on the role of the father
[32:14] right and the mother or the daughters
[32:15] would follow the role of the mother very
[32:16] simple lifestyle right you uh we see it
[32:19] kind of in our former Amish friends at
[32:21] least I do when I go down there to visit
[32:22] them you know the girls they just mimic
[32:24] everything the mother does and the boys
[32:26] they mimic everything the father does
[32:27] and
[32:28] it's neat to see that kind of that
[32:30] old-fashioned way it's a lot different
[32:31] than the modern city people right where
[32:34] Dad goes off to work and the children go
[32:35] off to school and mom goes off to work
[32:37] and they hardly ever see each other till
[32:39] the end of the day right uh they got
[32:41] babysitters all in between and dayc
[32:43] carees all in between and all kinds of
[32:44] things uh doesn't resemble uh what God
[32:47] had in mind God had training in mind
[32:49] because God told him uh write the word
[32:51] of God in your homes and uh write it
[32:53] everywhere wear it on your clothes you
[32:54] know he said put it on your foreheads he
[32:57] said talk about it all the time when you
[32:58] when you raise up when you when you lie
[33:00] down talk about at the table uh focus on
[33:02] the word of God at all times amen
[33:05] hallelujah so we see training was an
[33:07] important part of course of the Hebrew
[33:09] family and of course the Christian part
[33:10] or the Christian family as well uh by
[33:13] God's grace now as I've said before I
[33:14] want to bring this out again remember
[33:16] Esau was likely just as well trained as
[33:19] Jacob right but Esau was hated now we
[33:22] looked at that a few month or a few
[33:24] weeks ago that just doesn't mean God
[33:26] literally hated him like he didn't have
[33:28] any compassion the Bible said God's
[33:30] compassionate to all the wicked God's
[33:32] compassionate God doesn't want to see
[33:33] any wicked perish right he even looked
[33:35] at Judas when he betrayed him and said
[33:37] friend you betray me with a kiss he
[33:39] called him friend to the very last
[33:40] moment and the Bible said he knew the
[33:43] whole time he would betray him now
[33:44] that's love right if you knew this whole
[33:47] time someone's going to betray you and
[33:49] be one of your closest friends and I
[33:51] think you'd have a hard time loving them
[33:53] right but yes Hallelujah wash his feet
[33:56] even uh offered him the bread there and
[33:59] all these things and so it trained him
[34:01] up and that's what I that was my next
[34:03] example brother r no it's no that's good
[34:06] that's a good sign you know if and my
[34:10] next point was Judas is scarrett well
[34:11] maybe he didn't have the best we don't
[34:12] know about his child life but for sure
[34:14] he had the best adult train it was
[34:16] perfect training for three and a half
[34:18] years each one of us can look at our
[34:20] parents say well they they might have
[34:22] failed there as much as we love our
[34:24] parents right they might have been a
[34:26] little bit LAX here or maybe to too
[34:27] strict there too legalistic there but
[34:29] Judas could have never said my master
[34:32] wasn't perfect for me he never he never
[34:35] could have said well I didn't have the
[34:36] right training for three and a half
[34:37] years no you had the perfect training
[34:40] and you still sold it out for miserable
[34:43] pieces of money right 30 pieces of
[34:44] silver miserable then threw it down in
[34:46] the temple but based upon conviction
[34:48] that he sold out the Son of God and so
[34:52] you know we just look at those two
[34:53] examples there you know I've heard
[34:55] different preachers say you know and I
[34:56] don't know I don't know how much this is
[34:58] true but just it would just caught me
[35:00] with this idea of Jacob and Esau it
[35:02] could be true but I've heard different
[35:04] preachers that are way more experienced
[35:06] than me say they know some parents whove
[35:08] tried to do everything right and yet
[35:10] still their children turned out wrong
[35:13] right and that would fit the Esau
[35:15] example you know right uh it would just
[35:18] seemed like it would fit that you know
[35:19] Isaac and Rebecca don't you think they
[35:21] were pretty good parents I imagine you
[35:22] know Isaac was a wonderful man of God we
[35:25] only see really one one or two in his
[35:28] life he lied you know but then of course
[35:30] he would have had to repent and make it
[35:31] right but he was blessed in everything
[35:33] he did he was a son of a prophet you
[35:35] know he was we have everything good
[35:37] about him and Jesus even said you'll sit
[35:38] down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[35:41] Hallelujah so that man was a a good man
[35:44] Hallelujah but then his son Esau as we
[35:47] looked at it uh he probably did you know
[35:49] his Jewish history says he probably did
[35:50] five evil things just in that one day
[35:52] when he sold out his Birthright but yet
[35:54] he was trained very similar to Jacob he
[35:57] could and he in church he could say I
[35:58] was trained by a
[36:00] prophet right Abraham Isaac Jacob
[36:03] prophets right the Patriarchs he could
[36:05] say my daddy was a prophet he raised me
[36:07] to be a prophet my daddy's a child of
[36:09] the promise he ain't no child of the
[36:10] Bond woman you know he could have said
[36:12] all these great things is because es
[36:14] remember Jacob was loved by his mom Esau
[36:17] was loved by his dad well my a prophet
[36:20] loves me that don't mean nothing right
[36:23] didn't Jesus love the Rich Young Ruler
[36:26] yet the Rich Young Jesus the Bible said
[36:27] Jesus looked at him and loved him he
[36:29] kept all those Commandments but he
[36:31] wasn't willing to give up the
[36:33] money right he wasn't willing to sell
[36:35] out when Jesus asked him to sell out and
[36:37] become an apostle become a
[36:40] missionary so we see here you know we're
[36:42] given uh a probability if you train up
[36:45] the children when they're older they
[36:47] won't depart from it but we know it's
[36:50] probability know each person has a
[36:53] different uh Destiny based upon their
[36:55] desires and God pre designates based
[36:58] upon that desire because God can't force
[37:01] somebody to go to hell I just read it
[37:02] this week in in Ezekiel the Bible said
[37:04] Satan is the god of force and brother
[37:06] random repeats that in the church age
[37:08] book Satan forces people Satan puts all
[37:11] that pressure on them right Satan's a
[37:13] god of force but God God just offers
[37:15] just like he did in the Garden of Eden
[37:16] here's the Tree of Life here's the tree
[37:18] of knowledge and evil you make your
[37:19] choice and even told him what to do he
[37:23] even told Cain do this be like your
[37:25] brother don't do that but because of the
[37:28] love of evil and because of the love of
[37:31] of of of of sin Cain still disobeyed the
[37:34] word of God but may God help us to obey
[37:36] the word of God to be real children of
[37:38] God
[37:40] hallelujah so you can have training as a
[37:43] child and can be good and people can
[37:45] still fall away right how many people do
[37:48] we know around the message that were
[37:49] trained right but then fell away from
[37:51] the truth they they've taught all these
[37:52] things Naomi knows them right I people
[37:56] that Chris and I knew and came in the
[37:57] message they Fallen away and they they
[37:59] knew it they knew all the truth this
[38:01] whole time and yet still fall
[38:04] away you know we had numerous friends my
[38:07] wife and I that they were raised in the
[38:08] message and everybody thought they were
[38:09] all holy but then they went out and you
[38:11] know lived immorally and had children
[38:13] out of wedlock yet they were taught
[38:14] their whole lives about these things now
[38:17] thankfully a couple of them come back
[38:18] and repent and serve God and they don't
[38:20] marry again and they just they just rais
[38:22] that child that's a that's a real
[38:23] sincere
[38:25] person but the person knew it the whole
[38:27] time I mean they were trained the right
[38:29] way and God will still let them go go
[38:33] because God's not going to force you to
[38:34] do it you've got to want it you got to
[38:36] have a greater love for God than we have
[38:38] for the world
[38:39] Hallelujah so as a Christian family we
[38:42] do our best to train them to show them
[38:45] this is how you do it this is how you uh
[38:47] study the Bible this is how you pray
[38:49] this is how you repent and that's why I
[38:51] thank God for a wonderful wife like my
[38:52] wife you know when I'm at school working
[38:54] she can teach them how to repent she can
[38:56] teach them how to live live right and
[38:58] Lydia Malachi and Nia said amen all
[39:01] right praise God Mom has those good
[39:03] conversations right many times my wife
[39:04] has told me and it's true as a mom you
[39:06] know she might be busy with you know
[39:09] homeschool or some other things might be
[39:10] right in the middle of something but if
[39:11] somebody there's a problem she's got to
[39:13] stop that and she's got to talk it out
[39:16] explain this is why this is wrong and
[39:18] this is the
[39:19] punishment right and that's what a Godly
[39:22] mom does that's what a Godly father does
[39:24] right the training you got to have the
[39:27] train training there
[39:29] Hallelujah and so the Christian family
[39:32] is one of training I can say like this I
[39:34] know our children our our church we're
[39:36] training our children to go to church as
[39:38] more as we see that day approaching
[39:40] right Hallelujah and we should also be
[39:43] training them at home you know to study
[39:45] the word of God to pray every day to
[39:47] sing and worship every day of their
[39:49] lives Hallelujah that's the training
[39:51] that they need and model that before
[39:54] them
[39:56] Hallelujah
[39:58] now also another important point and
[40:00] this is you know just relating to my
[40:01] experience you know last time I shared a
[40:02] little bit about my at the end of the
[40:04] sermon I shared a little bit about my
[40:05] childhood growing up um but this is one
[40:08] thing that um you know Eli got in
[40:10] trouble for and I've said this before he
[40:12] he might have train them but he didn't
[40:14] restrain his sons so 1st Samuel 3:13 I
[40:18] just want you to see what a what a
[40:20] strict
[40:22] severe uh consequence God put on
[40:25] Eli first Samuel
[40:29] 313 you know the more responsibility you
[40:32] have with God the more accountable you
[40:34] are James says that preachers will be
[40:37] the most accountable so I really got to
[40:40] watch my life I want my wife to watch my
[40:42] life I want my children to W watch my
[40:44] life I want the church to watch my life
[40:46] because if anybody's going to be judged
[40:48] harshly it's going to be me because I'm
[40:50] the one preaching the word of God I'm
[40:53] either giving you a key to enter in or
[40:55] like the Pharisees I'm keeping you out I
[40:56] hope God's grace you've seen the key I'm
[40:59] trying to help you to open up Hallelujah
[41:01] open up the door open up the Jesus is
[41:03] the door Hallelujah I'm trying to show
[41:05] you as as i' as God has sh me doors to
[41:08] open and and victories to win and areas
[41:10] you can conquer and overcome I'm trying
[41:12] to show you here's the keys to do it the
[41:14] keys is the knowledge the Bible Jesus
[41:16] said the key of knowledge and knowledge
[41:18] of the word of God
[41:20] hallelujah like I prayed on Sunday I was
[41:24] trying to show everybody here just Again
[41:25] by rehearsal through fasting in prayer
[41:27] you can undo every heavy burden you
[41:30] don't have to leave here with
[41:31] burdens I'm trying to show you that's
[41:33] the key fast right and I'm we're going
[41:36] to hopefully close at that at then you
[41:38] know you can loose every band of
[41:39] wickedness you don't have to leave here
[41:41] feeling like you got a A Band of
[41:42] wickedness you can be free from that
[41:44] praise God Amen through confession
[41:46] repentance and then fasting and seeking
[41:49] God you can be free God gave us the keys
[41:51] of Isaiah 586 hallelujah amen and that's
[41:55] why we preach that that's why we believe
[41:57] that I'm sure brother Rod's church is
[41:58] he's gone to believe in Deliverance
[42:00] Ministries amen we even Believers got to
[42:03] be delivered sometimes Hallelujah but we
[42:05] got to want to be delivered
[42:09] Hallelujah remember the Bible Paul said
[42:11] that you know Satan takes people captive
[42:13] by his own will but the Bible says we're
[42:16] to go to those people and in meekness
[42:18] instruct them that they might recover
[42:20] themselves out of the Trap of the enemy
[42:22] see they've got to want they've got to
[42:24] acknowledge what God is they got to
[42:25] acknowledge the word of God and then
[42:27] they'll get free from their bands of
[42:29] captivity but the individual has to want
[42:31] to be free hallelujah amen now here was
[42:35] the awful sin of Eli now it seems like
[42:38] Eli was saved you know God did use him
[42:40] in some Supernatural ways remember he's
[42:41] the one that looked at Hannah and said
[42:43] the Lord has heard your prayer and she
[42:45] had a Samuel that's quite a thing to
[42:48] say telling a woman who's never had a
[42:50] child before other words the Lord heard
[42:52] you thus sayith the Lord you're going to
[42:53] have a child that's the thing to say
[42:56] hallelujah
[42:57] so and he he had a heart he had a heart
[42:59] for the ark now look at that you can be
[43:02] spiritual you can speak the word of God
[43:03] you can have a when he heard the ark was
[43:05] taken it so made him so sad you know he
[43:08] was overweight but he lost his bounds
[43:09] threw his head back hit his head and
[43:11] died he was he had some compassion for
[43:14] God but he didn't have enough desire to
[43:17] keep his his children cleaned out he
[43:19] didn't have enough desire for God's word
[43:21] to apply it to his
[43:24] children and the God said you honored
[43:27] your children your sons more than you
[43:29] honored me see you can have a tender
[43:31] heart for brother brandham or John
[43:33] Wesley or Charles finny like brother rod
[43:34] and I want to go see his
[43:36] grave but any man of God that you admire
[43:39] any saint you can have a tender heart
[43:41] for them but the main thing is apply it
[43:43] to your family
[43:45] Hallelujah apply what we know to our
[43:48] house Hallelujah that's kind of what I
[43:50] want to get to at the end it's a sin to
[43:53] just hear the word and not do anything
[43:55] about it it's a sin
[43:58] that's why every sermon is important
[44:00] especially when you see it's
[44:02] timely like you weren't expecting to
[44:04] hear that and God just shook you
[44:07] and he spoke that's God that ain't
[44:11] brother so- and so that ain't brother
[44:12] it's
[44:13] God like I told you that one time Simon
[44:16] preaching I I texted him nine things you
[44:17] just discern my life in nine things I've
[44:21] never had a sermon like that nine
[44:22] secrets of my heart nine things I've
[44:23] already studied nine things I was
[44:25] praying about nine things I went through
[44:26] I said that's god
[44:28] brother
[44:31] Hallelujah never had that before because
[44:33] Jesus is the discerner of the thoughts
[44:35] and intents of our hearts
[44:38] Hallelujah and it won't push you to to
[44:40] sin and recklessness it'll push you to
[44:42] humility and repentance Hallelujah it'll
[44:45] bring you closer to God but here's the
[44:47] sin the awful sin of Eli for I've told
[44:49] him that I will judge his house forever
[44:51] now look look at the responsibility he
[44:53] was a priest the high priest if I'm not
[44:56] mistaken for the iniquity which he
[44:58] knoweth because he made because his sons
[45:00] made themselves vile and he restrained
[45:02] them not he had the authority to take
[45:05] them out of the positions of
[45:07] power and he didn't do it that's why
[45:11] I've always said if any of my children
[45:12] disobey God and they're in any positions
[45:15] I've got to remove them God forbid right
[45:18] but you also got the authority if I get
[45:20] out of line you got to remove
[45:22] me and the church
[45:25] said
[45:27] right I I can I can have the authority
[45:30] too I can I can kick people out of
[45:31] church too Bible said get that leaven
[45:34] out from among you there's a way to do
[45:36] it yes go to them one1 then take
[45:37] somebody else yes there's a way to do it
[45:38] Matthew 18 but in other words we're all
[45:40] accountable for each
[45:41] other now let's hope that never happens
[45:44] by God's grace right let's live All Pure
[45:47] before god let's live holy
[45:49] Hallelujah let we overcome our trials by
[45:52] God's grace one step at a time
[45:55] Hallelujah but the Bible said that that
[45:57] he honored I'm sorry he
[45:59] restrained he failed I'm sorry he re
[46:02] failed to restrain and then look how the
[46:04] Judgment lasted it was forever now it
[46:06] actually the Judgment didn't actually
[46:07] happen to the days of Solomon so look
[46:08] how merciful god
[46:11] was it was Generations later and then
[46:14] Solomon finally ended that lineage of
[46:17] Eli it's quite a thing to see that he
[46:21] honored and I don't have the scripture
[46:23] there I didn't actually look find that
[46:24] one but I know the scripture says that
[46:26] he honored
[46:28] uh his sons more than God did anybody
[46:31] see that
[46:33] scripture just by chance if you saw
[46:50] it all right well I couldn't find it
[46:52] there but
[46:53] uh the Bible said God will honor all
[46:56] those who honor
[46:57] him
[46:59] amen
[47:00] hallelujah so now we can see we must
[47:03] train our children and I'll say like
[47:05] this train ourselves Hallelujah because
[47:08] the Bible said Paul said I beat my body
[47:10] I train my body and I bring it under
[47:12] subjection to the word of God and then
[47:14] as parents we must restrain our children
[47:16] now that's one thing I just want to lay
[47:17] this in you although my dad wasn't there
[47:19] I I can say one thing about my mom she
[47:21] did restrain my brothers and I and my
[47:23] sister my sister and I that's one thing
[47:25] she would do you made her mad she get
[47:28] out that baseball bat I told you about
[47:30] she get out that soap and sneak around
[47:32] put that soap in my mouth she get out
[47:34] that wooden spoon brother Austin and she
[47:36] started hitting me because I deserved it
[47:39] and you know sometimes I'll say just try
[47:41] to be real General when certain family
[47:43] members were staying out too late she
[47:44] would drive over to where they were and
[47:46] I don't care what time of night it was
[47:48] and honk on that car horn until they
[47:51] came
[47:53] out don't you know that was embarrassing
[47:55] sometimes but what was she doing
[47:58] restraining the
[48:00] wickedness now what if you had four
[48:02] teenage boys what kind of mom would you
[48:04] or Dad would you be they're running all
[48:06] over they don't love Jesus they they
[48:07] don't like going to church now three of
[48:09] them are
[48:10] preachers because she restrained them
[48:13] Hallelujah the best she could one woman
[48:15] without a without a husband there see
[48:18] God honors those who honor him praise
[48:21] God I just share that you know I like to
[48:23] share what I've seen just God
[48:25] do and again remember my mom every
[48:28] morning before we go to school we didn't
[48:30] want to we weren't like oh let's pray
[48:31] mom we're like come on Mom I got to get
[48:33] to class no we're praying she'd stand
[48:36] she would stand by the door guard the
[48:37] door like this we're praying I'd try to
[48:38] push back like come on I'm going to be
[48:40] late well that's cuz I slept in too long
[48:42] that's my fault and she stand there and
[48:44] say no let's pray and we would pray and
[48:47] boy I was many I was late many times in
[48:48] high school but it was my own fault but
[48:51] you better believe every time I got a
[48:52] prayer before I went to
[48:54] school and what did I see I saw the
[48:56] grace of God upon my life God he God
[48:59] hears the prayers of his humble
[49:02] servants that's right
[49:04] church so it's our duty to train
[49:07] ourselves and our our children and also
[49:09] restrain them if we see evil we need to
[49:12] restrain it like I've told my children
[49:15] if I catch them doing evil things on
[49:16] their phones and tablets I'm GNA take it
[49:18] away my wife catches it we can do that
[49:21] we got to restrain them right from Evil
[49:24] we got to do it I respected parents when
[49:27] I see them do that that's a very good
[49:28] thing to
[49:29] do whatever trouble they're in it's our
[49:32] duty as parents to restrain
[49:34] them all
[49:37] right and that's just a brief I just
[49:39] want to just rehearse that briefly
[49:41] because that's what the Christian family
[49:42] does a Christian family has rules and
[49:45] boundaries that shows the love of God
[49:49] hallelujah boundaries are the protection
[49:51] of God they're the love of God you stay
[49:54] Within These boundaries and I'll protect
[49:56] you pray praise God
[49:58] hallelujah now I want to look at a few
[50:00] things here um let's look at the
[50:02] positive first then we'll look at the
[50:03] negative so Hebrews 117 in case if you
[50:06] pull that up there whenever get a chance
[50:07] I like how you're taking notes there
[50:09] notes and the computer double duty bless
[50:12] your heart it's good
[50:13] training Hebrews 11:7 let's go at Noah
[50:16] just briefly by faith Noah being warned
[50:19] of God of things not seen as yet now see
[50:21] church if he got a warning about
[50:23] judgment AR don't you think we'll get a
[50:24] warning about judgment the Earth's
[50:26] coming under judgment as it was in the
[50:27] days of Noah so shall be in the days of
[50:30] the coming of the son of
[50:32] man he was warned judgment's coming so
[50:36] what does he do the warning should
[50:38] motivate us to
[50:40] action praise
[50:42] God we can see brother bam told us the
[50:45] United States is in Revelation 13: 11
[50:48] to1 18 the Beast out of the out of the
[50:50] land is the United States of America
[50:53] she's got power to bring fire down from
[50:54] heaven that's the atomic bombs in 194 45
[50:57] it's easily seen and the devil's going
[50:59] to use that Beast to lay down the mark
[51:02] eventually right it's prophecy right
[51:05] it's it's it's prophecy so we've been
[51:08] warned right and brother R told us thus
[51:11] sayith the Lord because it's the Beast
[51:12] United States would do the same acts
[51:15] upon Christians that Rome once did
[51:17] because it's the same spirit that
[51:19] dominating Spirit upon the Earth right
[51:21] Daniel saw the four parts of the the
[51:23] image like I we went over a few weeks
[51:24] ago and that's the spirit of Rome is in
[51:27] the United States of America trying to
[51:30] Lord over all right I mean there's so
[51:31] many
[51:32] parallels I've gone over them many times
[51:34] you know the the most education the most
[51:36] freedom of religion uh the greatest
[51:38] military but they're spreading their
[51:39] military out too much
[51:42] right see Noah was he was warned of God
[51:46] so if God loves you he gives you a
[51:47] warning Hallelujah he'll give your house
[51:49] a warning hallelujah thank God and what
[51:52] he do he moved with reverence for God so
[51:55] he reverently built that
[51:58] Ark he PR prepared an ark to the saving
[52:00] of his house by which he condemned the
[52:03] world and became heir of the
[52:04] righteousness which is by faith now
[52:06] everybody knows Noah could not have
[52:07] built that Ark all by himself it's just
[52:09] literally impossible if you don't
[52:10] believe that go down and see the ark
[52:12] there in Kentucky which we have not one
[52:14] man built that it was a team of Amish
[52:16] people built that right it wasn't just
[52:18] one man so Noah of course would have had
[52:21] his three sons and probably a bunch of
[52:23] other people helping him throughout the
[52:25] years now some say it was was 60 70
[52:27] years some say 120 doesn't really matter
[52:29] he built it he kept the word of
[52:33] God so see what did he do once he got
[52:35] the warning it brought reverence for God
[52:38] and he prepared away he trained his
[52:41] family so they could be saved God didn't
[52:44] force any of them to go in they all had
[52:45] to go in by themselves by free moral
[52:48] agency praise God so but notice the
[52:51] family worked together the family stayed
[52:54] together the family was serving a
[52:56] purpose Hallelujah as for me in my house
[52:58] we'll serve the Lord we'll bu build an
[53:00] ark we'll be saved we'll obey the word
[53:02] of God hallelujah all the other world
[53:05] rest of the world can laugh at it they
[53:06] can take they can reject the warning
[53:08] they can do whatever we want but the
[53:10] Bible said he was a preacher of
[53:12] righteousness amen and he found Grace in
[53:14] the sight of the Lord hallelujah amen
[53:17] let's live righteously that's the part
[53:18] of the Holy Ghost Kingdom right peace
[53:21] righteousness Joy Hallelujah that's the
[53:24] kingdom of God on Earth
[53:28] and then because of that he became an
[53:29] heir of the righteousness which is by
[53:32] faith Hallelujah he inherited
[53:36] righteousness
[53:37] amen see they stayed together they
[53:40] labored together they worked together
[53:43] Hallelujah but one man motivated it all
[53:46] and so as husbands and fathers that's
[53:48] what we need to be the motivator the
[53:50] leader behind it Hallelujah keep and the
[53:52] way to do that is keep our lives clean
[53:54] first and then love our our wives right
[53:57] and then train our children restrain our
[53:59] children if need
[54:01] be
[54:05] Hallelujah so see the family must labor
[54:08] together stay
[54:10] together and it's like that spouse we
[54:12] looked at in 1 Corinthians 7 where a a a
[54:15] believing spouse can sanctify her
[54:18] husband or vice versa a believing
[54:21] husband can sanctify his unbelieving
[54:23] wife see because the power the power of
[54:27] the believer moving by the movement of
[54:30] the Holy Spirit can create such an
[54:32] atmosphere now that's what Noah did he
[54:34] created such an atmosphere preach
[54:36] righteousness he told him thus sayeth
[54:38] the Lord hallelujah he put his a his
[54:39] faith to action and build a build a a
[54:42] house of protection and because of that
[54:44] the seven people followed him into the
[54:46] ark amen what a church of eight people
[54:48] amen I like that amen hallelujah we
[54:50] start our church with seven so we're
[54:51] very similar to Noah Hallelujah glad
[54:54] we're more than that but just a just
[54:56] it's a simple type there how you know he
[54:59] lived it he put all his energy all of
[55:01] his efforts into it to save seven Souls
[55:03] you think it was worth it Church you
[55:05] know it was worth it when the people are
[55:06] knocking saying let us in let us in and
[55:08] they say we can't God shut the door
[55:11] Hallelujah it was worth it then
[55:12] hallelujah all the labor all the all the
[55:15] mocking all the persecution all the
[55:18] aloneness and all the frustration all
[55:20] whatever it may be all the mocking the
[55:22] teasing it was all worth it then because
[55:25] they moved according according to the
[55:26] word of God
[55:30] hallelujah now what did she do now I'm
[55:32] sorry what did uh what did he do or what
[55:33] did these spouses do the Bible said you
[55:36] build your house by
[55:39] wisdom not by the greatest building
[55:41] materials because not of all of us can
[55:43] hardly afford it especially now with
[55:45] with the prices of wood someone said
[55:47] well they went down a little bit I know
[55:49] and we know that and they know that too
[55:50] but for us it's still like they're what
[55:52] four or five times the amount they were
[55:54] they're still thank God they're going a
[55:56] little bit but still extremely expensive
[55:59] go to Proverbs
[56:02] 9:1 so Noah he built the ark by the
[56:07] wisdom of God and that's how we must
[56:09] build our daily lives our our home life
[56:12] we only have a short time to do I think
[56:14] of Lydia is 19 I said 20 but it's 19
[56:18] sorry L I didn't want to add a year to
[56:19] you I never want to do that with
[56:21] sisters Malachi 17 qua 15 right 14 ah 14
[56:28] why always do it to the sisters forgive
[56:32] me but you know it seems so short like
[56:34] it went so fast where did all these
[56:37] years go I put Lydia's uh picture
[56:39] slideshow together for the graduation
[56:41] I'm like where did all these years go

[56:44] one to now she's a growing up one I
[56:45] cried like where did all this time go
[56:48] why is it it go so fast my but what did
[56:52] we do we built a spiritual house for her
[56:54] to live in
[56:56] that's what we all must do wisdom hath
[56:58] builded her house and she hath heun out
[57:00] her Seven Pillars heun out chopped out
[57:03] and the Bible says the prophets chopped
[57:05] out the People by the word of God so
[57:09] that's that that's what the the symbol
[57:11] is in here you got to chop down the
[57:13] right pillars to build up your house
[57:15] other words you got to work if you want
[57:16] the pillar of Faith you got to BU you
[57:19] got to chop that out you got to put some
[57:22] effort into it some labor if you want
[57:24] worship if you want your children to
[57:25] love the Bible or love to sing you got
[57:27] to work on that you got to heue that out
[57:30] Hallelujah you got to set up that pillar
[57:33] amen that's how wisdom does it it cuts
[57:36] it out in other words I'm GNA cut time
[57:39] out of my schedule to make sure we
[57:40] worship God hallelujah I'm gonna make
[57:43] time for God
[57:46] hallelujah that's what wisdom does know
[57:48] had to make time to go cut out the
[57:50] pillars right the foundation of the Ark
[57:54] you to make time for that you got to cut
[57:56] it
[57:58] out Hue hued out Seven Pillars seven
[58:02] Church ages seven attributes hallelujah
[58:06] amen Seven Seals amen seven Thunders
[58:09] hallelujah amen seven the complete
[58:12] number she hath mingled her Beast so now
[58:15] we're getting into sacrifices sheath
[58:17] mingled her wine that's stimulation The
[58:19] Joy sheath also furnished her table the
[58:22] Feast of the word of God she hath sent
[58:24] forth her maiden she crith upon the
[58:25] highest place of the city who so simple
[58:28] that now that means humble who so is
[58:29] humble let him turn in hither as for him
[58:31] that WTH understanding she said to him
[58:33] come eat of my bread and drink of the
[58:35] wine which I have mled come to church
[58:37] hear the word of God
[58:39] hallelujah come hear it forsake the
[58:41] foolish don't live like them leave them
[58:44] behind they're not your real friends
[58:47] Hallelujah live the truth believe the
[58:49] word of God follow the word
[58:52] hallelujah and live and go in the way of
[58:55] understanding he that reproveth a
[58:57] scorner GTH to himself shame and he that
[58:59] rebuke a wicked man GTH himself a blot
[59:02] reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee
[59:04] rebuke a wise man and he will love thee
[59:07] that's what I was saying on Sunday right
[59:08] or anytime if you rebuke somebody and
[59:12] they really love God they'll say thank
[59:13] you it might burn their hide but they'll
[59:16] say thank you they're not going to get
[59:19] upset at you now they might
[59:21] inside but if the Bible says if you
[59:23] rebuke a wise man he'll love you
[59:27] Hallelujah
[59:29] scriptures give instruction to the wise
[59:31] man and he will be yet wiser teach him
[59:33] just man and he will increase in
[59:37] learning that's right the fear of the
[59:39] Lord is beginning of wisdom and the
[59:40] knowledge of the Holy is understanding
[59:42] for by me thy days shall be multiplied
[59:45] and the years of thy life shall be
[59:46] increased Chris and I have seen our some
[59:48] high school friends die of drug use
[59:50] early I mean she's 41 I'm
[59:54] 43 I mean where see they didn't get the
[59:56] long life because they didn't take heed
[59:58] to the word of God now I know the Bible
[1:00:00] says some men's sins go before them and
[1:00:02] some are hidden till later and I know
[1:00:04] it's probability but they're just clear
[1:00:08] plain
[1:00:12] examples verse 12 if thou be wise Thou
[1:00:14] shalt be wise for thyself but if thou
[1:00:16] scornest thou alone shalt bear
[1:00:19] Hallelujah so see we see this here if we
[1:00:21] want the wise life if we want a home
[1:00:23] that really glorifies God it must be h
[1:00:26] out it must be cut out right we must uh
[1:00:30] we must make it happen in other words
[1:00:32] Hallelujah we must surrender to the Holy
[1:00:35] Spirit we must do what the Lord says
[1:00:37] hallelujah
[1:00:40] amen now what what I find in America and
[1:00:43] I want to shift gears a little bit
[1:00:46] here what we find in America is the
[1:00:49] prosperity trap because that is the the
[1:00:52] temptation of today notice in the first
[1:00:55] six Church churches in Revelation 2 and
[1:00:57] 3 it don't say anything about
[1:00:59] riches but then that final Church it
[1:01:02] speaks of riches let's go to Revelation
[1:01:07] 3:17 and I believe those those have
[1:01:09] three
[1:01:11] applications they apply directly to
[1:01:13] those seven churches back there around
[1:01:15] 100 AD they apply to the individual in
[1:01:18] other words you and I know what it's
[1:01:19] like we need our first love back
[1:01:21] sometimes and then it also applies
[1:01:23] prophetically to the Future Church ages
[1:01:26] because Paul said there would be ages
[1:01:28] there was past ages there's future ages
[1:01:30] there will always be ages
[1:01:33] Hallelujah that's not skim milk
[1:01:40] Hallelujah Revelation
[1:01:44] 3:17 this is a
[1:01:46] trap we got to be very careful not to
[1:01:48] fall into a trap of uh Prosperity
[1:01:52] because thou sayest I'm rich and
[1:01:53] increase with goods and have need of
[1:01:55] nothing and knowest not that thou are
[1:01:56] wretched miserable poor blind and
[1:02:00] naked I counsel thee to buy me gold
[1:02:02] tried in the fire that's time tested
[1:02:03] Faith according to Peter that thou
[1:02:05] mayest be rich so spiritual
[1:02:08] riches and white rment that thou mayest
[1:02:10] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:02:12] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[1:02:14] eyes with isow that thou mayest
[1:02:17] see
[1:02:19] amen hallelujah see I can't help but I'm
[1:02:21] not amen myself I'm Amen in the word of
[1:02:22] God hallelujah I just can't I've always
[1:02:25] been that way amen Hallelujah just love
[1:02:27] the word of God but notice riches
[1:02:29] increase with goods and we got to be
[1:02:31] careful in this culture in this uh
[1:02:34] Financial condition if we increase our
[1:02:37] riches and goods we must always still
[1:02:39] have a great hunger for God if Abraham
[1:02:41] did it if David could do it we can do it
[1:02:44] praise God and they didn't even have the
[1:02:45] Holy Ghost amen I say this if Lydia
[1:02:48] could do it we could do it because Lydia
[1:02:49] was rich with purple Hallelujah that's
[1:02:52] right amen if God could turn a rich
[1:02:55] woman's heart God can turn our hearts
[1:02:57] back amen of course they are but I'm
[1:02:59] saying is keep our hearts pure that's
[1:03:00] what I'm saying keep our hearts clean
[1:03:03] Hallelujah keep our hearts hungering
[1:03:04] after
[1:03:05] God remember brother said what's the
[1:03:07] pressur of this day soft living riches
[1:03:11] and nervous tensions how many fell all
[1:03:13] three this week you don't have to raise
[1:03:14] your hand I did right oh I want remember
[1:03:18] one time I'm I'm G to laugh around with
[1:03:20] brother digs about this remember brother
[1:03:21] digs said oh you're going to be a
[1:03:22] millionaire I'm like there's no way I'll
[1:03:24] Be A Millionaire I appreciate your love
[1:03:25] for me brother but I'm going to joke
[1:03:26] around with them about that there's no
[1:03:29] way unless God pour something out
[1:03:34] Mercy
[1:03:36] impossible and but you know we get those
[1:03:38] Temptations you know we hear podcasts or
[1:03:40] things you know Austin I talk about podc

[1:03:49] your life easier easier easier but
[1:03:52] church it's okay to have some nice
[1:03:53] things but is your spiritual connection
[1:03:55] with God is it still
[1:03:57] strong what I mean is you might have a
[1:03:59] softer bed right but are you sleeping in
[1:04:01] and not praying
[1:04:03] enough everyone understand what I'm
[1:04:05] saying soft living right you might have

[1:04:17] PR level washer because we got eight
[1:04:19] kids you know boy we sure needed it too

[1:04:25] our our
[1:04:26] time rich and increased with Goods I
[1:04:29] don't need more of God every one of us
[1:04:31] should say I need more of God
[1:04:33] hallelujah and brother R said brother R
[1:04:35] tells us what does and he used uh the
[1:04:38] history writers brother Rod like men
[1:04:40] like finny he said what does on fire
[1:04:42] look like he said it's a fervent desire
[1:04:44] to please God and he got this from some
[1:04:47] of the other preachers he listed some of
[1:04:48] them like Albert Barnes and uh John Gil
[1:04:52] a fervent desire to please God a passion
[1:04:54] to know his word means you really like
[1:04:56] hearing the
[1:04:58] preaching and third you reach out in the
[1:05:01] Holy Spirit asking God to do things amen
[1:05:04] I love that hallelujah how do you know
[1:05:06] you're on fire you're doing those three
[1:05:07] things Amen in other words I got a
[1:05:09] fervent desire to please him I'm not
[1:05:11] going to allow sin to ruin my day
[1:05:13] hallelujah or my week or my month or my
[1:05:16] year amen or my life hallelujah amen
[1:05:19] I've got a fervent desire to please God
[1:05:21] I've got a passion to know his word I
[1:05:23] want to get in the Deep things of God
[1:05:26] we just heard uh what former it was
[1:05:28] Franklin delanor
[1:05:30] Roosevelt we we're reading through this
[1:05:32] book about the founding fathers of
[1:05:33] America boy they talked a big game I
[1:05:35] don't know how much they lived it but
[1:05:36] some of them lived it some of them
[1:05:37] didn't you know but FR Franklin Delo
[1:05:40] Roosevelt said he said everything good
[1:05:42] in life is in the Bible he said if you
[1:05:44] want to be entertained you want some
[1:05:45] excitement read the Bible he said if you
[1:05:47] want to be smarter uh knowledge and
[1:05:50] science read the Bible he said you want
[1:05:52] to hear good stories read the Bible
[1:05:54] every single thing
[1:05:56] everything that you could possibly want
[1:05:57] whether it's entertainment or or or
[1:05:59] knowledge or wisdom he said get in the
[1:06:02] Bible Hallelujah one of the first first
[1:06:04] acts of Congress I'm sorry the first
[1:06:07] book Congress uh printed in America was
[1:06:10] the Bible amen God bless you sir love
[1:06:12] you
[1:06:12] buddy my precious brother I do that to
[1:06:15] all of you if you were late you know so
[1:06:16] well the brothers
[1:06:19] now
[1:06:20] Glory but every you know think think the
[1:06:23] devil has all these things that try to
[1:06:24] take us away just from the simp
[1:06:25] Simplicity of enjoying the word of
[1:06:29] God it's laying here with all these
[1:06:31] ammunition all this ammunition we say a
[1:06:34] sword all these wonderful blessings are
[1:06:37] laying right here and it's the enemy's
[1:06:40] job to give us so much Prosperity that
[1:06:43] we forget about the needful
[1:06:45] thing I have need of the word I have a
[1:06:48] great need of that it's always Pride
[1:06:51] right the B and brother bam uses Uzziah
[1:06:54] as the example he was a tremendous King
[1:06:57] until the very end he had great
[1:06:59] inventions brother you know he had
[1:07:00] battle inventions and he was whipping
[1:07:03] Every Nation he was a man he was known
[1:07:05] around the whole Known World until the
[1:07:07] very end the Bible said I I still
[1:07:10] believe he was saved it's looks like he
[1:07:11] was saved he just got off at the end
[1:07:13] just like David and Solomon and some of
[1:07:15] the other ones now David wasn't as bad
[1:07:16] as Solomon he said but when he was
[1:07:18] strong in 2 Chronicles 2616 when he was
[1:07:20] strong his heart was lifted up in to his
[1:07:23] Destruction for he transgressed against
[1:07:25] the the Lord is God and went into the
[1:07:26] Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon
[1:07:28] the altar of
[1:07:30] incense pride and what do we battle lust
[1:07:33] of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of
[1:07:36] life that's why Jesus could understand
[1:07:38] every Temptation man or woman because
[1:07:40] it's in all three
[1:07:41] areas brother raham said he talks about
[1:07:44] this he talks about
[1:07:49] Uzziah he said uh he said Uzziah got
[1:07:52] lifted up he said so many today you take
[1:07:54] a family of people will start going to
[1:07:56] church and God will heal the little
[1:07:58] family he'll bless them and give them
[1:08:00] the holy spirit in their life the little
[1:08:02] children will pray around the table
[1:08:04] they'll pray before they go to bed
[1:08:05] mother and father will join hands and
[1:08:07] pray and as long as they continue like
[1:08:08] that they'll stay a
[1:08:12] family now I've told you some
[1:08:15] testimonies of families giving up the
[1:08:18] family prayer
[1:08:20] time I'm not rebuking anybody that's
[1:08:23] what these people told me I love all
[1:08:25] these people love all the people that
[1:08:26] tell me things but I share with you to
[1:08:27] give you a warning because I love you
[1:08:30] and I've got to apply that warning to my
[1:08:31] life too well R said if you do that
[1:08:34] you'll stay a
[1:08:38] family he says but you let the first
[1:08:40] thing you know they didn't have nothing
[1:08:42] an old junk car maybe riding around or
[1:08:44] maybe walking anybody got a junk car you
[1:08:45] don't got to say
[1:08:46] amen he said finally they'll get a good
[1:08:49] car A Better Home and the first thing
[1:08:51] you know they want to get what they do
[1:08:53] the world calls a better class say so
[1:08:55] associate with they move into a
[1:08:56] different
[1:08:57] neighborhood and in there they find out
[1:08:59] they become influenced by the wrong
[1:09:02] people now I know a lot of good
[1:09:04] Christians that move into a good
[1:09:05] neighborhood but they don't get
[1:09:06] influenced by the
[1:09:08] neighbors that's what we did we left
[1:09:10] akaran you know I mean a has some good
[1:09:12] parts don't get me wrong but the parts
[1:09:13] we were in not so great especially when
[1:09:15] we first got
[1:09:17] married but we didn't let our neighbors
[1:09:20] influence
[1:09:22] us we try to influence the neighbors
[1:09:25] right just like Daniel Amen Daniel was
[1:09:27] right there in the midst of Babylon and
[1:09:28] he wouldn't let them influence him he
[1:09:30] was going to pray every day hallelujah
[1:09:32] amen what was going to eat their their
[1:09:34] sinful diet he was going to keep the
[1:09:35] word of God and God visited him
[1:09:38] hallelujah
[1:09:40] amen you must he says You must always
[1:09:43] stay where the kingdom of God is being
[1:09:45] poured out where the glory of God is
[1:09:47] pouring out stay where you can be
[1:09:50] spiritually fed day and night and the
[1:09:52] first thing you know he said but the
[1:09:53] first thing you know separation come
[1:09:55] comes in the home worldliness and they
[1:09:57] get lifted up in
[1:10:01] Pride okay so just some simple reminders
[1:10:03] here remember wisdom has to cut out you
[1:10:04] got to cut out the pillars of your life
[1:10:07] it's going to take some effort diligence
[1:10:09] is the Bible word right the Bible even
[1:10:12] says in Hebrews labor to enter into the
[1:10:15] promise got to cut down some pillars
[1:10:17] Hallelujah so Al every everybody tonight
[1:10:20] you're going to go home and you can cut
[1:10:21] out make sure you have a little prayer
[1:10:23] time before you go home maybe say a
[1:10:24] prayer before you go to bed
[1:10:26] maybe read your read a chapter listen to
[1:10:27] a chapter on the way home do something
[1:10:29] but make sure you make sure that pillar
[1:10:30] is in its right
[1:10:32] position if you haven't cut that out cut
[1:10:34] it out set it up so you got that pillar
[1:10:37] set up and then the house can
[1:10:40] stand amen
[1:10:43] hallelujah
[1:10:47] Glory but it's a Prosperity trap many
[1:10:50] times of course in leoa but this was all
[1:10:53] through the Bible get your Bibles ready
[1:10:54] let's do some uh quick reading here
[1:10:57] Deuteronomy
[1:11:05] 8:11 God warned them ahead of time and
[1:11:09] they still fell into it of course it
[1:11:10] wasn't the that generation it was later
[1:11:13] generations beware that thou forget not
[1:11:15] the Lord thy God and keeping his
[1:11:16] Commandments and his judgments and his
[1:11:17] statutes which I command thee this day
[1:11:19] lest when thou has eaten and art full
[1:11:21] and has built goodly houses and dwelt
[1:11:23] therein and when thy herds and thy
[1:11:24] flocks m multiply thy silver and thy
[1:11:26] gold is Multiplied and all that thou
[1:11:27] Hast is Multiplied look everything God
[1:11:30] blesses every are of their life and you
[1:11:32] would think my they stand back and say
[1:11:33] thank
[1:11:34] God but instead Israel forgot about God
[1:11:39] after God blessed them with all this
[1:11:40] they forgot about
[1:11:42] him verse 14 then their heart be lifted
[1:11:45] up and thou forget the Lord thy God
[1:11:46] which brought thee forth out of the land
[1:11:48] of Egypt from the house of bondage amen
[1:11:51] who led thee through the great and
[1:11:52] terrible Wilderness wherein were fiery
[1:11:54] serpents scorpions and drought where
[1:11:56] there was no water who brought thee
[1:11:58] forth water out of the rock of Flint my
[1:12:02] they got so much blessing so much
[1:12:04] Prosperity they forgot about the
[1:12:06] serpents the Scorpions the drought the
[1:12:08] hunger Church never forget where you
[1:12:11] came from Hallelujah I'm looking at you
[1:12:13] buddy CU you and I got a similar thing
[1:12:15] testimony don't forget where you came
[1:12:17] from Hallelujah I purposely bought a
[1:12:19] sign that says I still remember the days
[1:12:21] I prayed for what I have now I saw that
[1:12:23] online when I was on Facebook I'm like
[1:12:25] I'm buying that cuz I remember I never
[1:12:27] thought I'd have a happy home never
[1:12:28] thought I'd have a garage I never
[1:12:30] thought I'd have a garage that's how
[1:12:31] poor we were growing up and that's why I
[1:12:34] bought that I prayed for all these
[1:12:35] things or how about a new kitchen I
[1:12:36] never thought I'd have a renovated
[1:12:38] kitchen I'm like how how am I going to
[1:12:40] afford that I don't have enough money
[1:12:41] for that how am I going to do that well
[1:12:43] God knows what we pray Hallelujah God
[1:12:46] hears our prayers amen but that's not an
[1:12:49] occasion to forget about God we must
[1:12:51] remember where we came from we must
[1:12:53] remember the testimonies we must
[1:12:55] continue to bless God and call on his
[1:12:57] name not get lifted up but get humbled
[1:12:59] before
[1:13:01] God that's what that's what fasting does
[1:13:03] humbles us the Bible said it afflicts
[1:13:06] your
[1:13:09] soul got to be very careful for the
[1:13:12] prosperity
[1:13:13] trap brother Braham said it numerous
[1:13:15] times now it's not absolute for
[1:13:16] everybody but it's just a good thing
[1:13:17] brother Braham said as soon as a church
[1:13:19] will build a great big church then
[1:13:20] they'll get real they'll get real LAX on
[1:13:22] God because they got this fine Church
[1:13:25] everything's fine and dandy look what we
[1:13:27] got look what we got and they forget
[1:13:28] about the main thing they forget about
[1:13:30] building the spiritual house they're so
[1:13:33] interested in the natural house they
[1:13:35] forget about the spiritual house now can
[1:13:38] it be done sure it can be done if if
[1:13:40] Solon did it at the beginning well that
[1:13:42] people could do it in the New Testament
[1:13:44] too
[1:13:45] Hallelujah uh let's say in the Old
[1:13:47] Testament there Nehemiah 9:25 and
[1:13:54] 26
[1:13:56] 9:25 and I found all these just by
[1:13:59] flipping through my Bible remember I'm
[1:14:00] transferring all my notes into my newer
[1:14:03] Bible is that home Nehemiah
[1:14:06] 92526 and they took strong cities in a
[1:14:08] fat land and possessed Houses full of
[1:14:11] all Goods Wells dig Vineyards and Olive
[1:14:13] yards and fruit trees in abundance so
[1:14:15] they did eat and were filled and became
[1:14:16] fat and delighted themselves in thy
[1:14:18] great goodness see God shares his
[1:14:21] goodness with us but he doesn't want us
[1:14:23] to forget where it came came
[1:14:26] from remember Ecclesiastes said it's a
[1:14:28] gift of God but don't let a gift of God
[1:14:31] get your eyes off The Giver of the gift
[1:14:34] amen nevertheless they were disobedient
[1:14:37] and rebelled against thee and cast thy
[1:14:39] law behind their backs and slew thy
[1:14:41] prophets which testified against them to
[1:14:43] turn them to thee and they wrought great
[1:14:47] provocations so the very God that sent
[1:14:49] them prophets and all these things they
[1:14:50] turned their back on the word of God
[1:14:53] after they had all these blessings
[1:14:56] blings what a
[1:14:57] shame
[1:14:59] Hallelujah uh Jeremiah
[1:15:04] 5:27 so I just made it I'm almost at the
[1:15:07] end of Ezekiel I'm started in Genesis
[1:15:10] I'm almost to the New Testament here
[1:15:11] transferring all these good notes over
[1:15:14] Jeremiah
[1:15:18] 5:27 as a cage is full of birds so are
[1:15:21] their houses full of Deceit wherefore
[1:15:23] they become great and wax and Rich
[1:15:26] they're waxing fat they shine yay they
[1:15:29] overpass the Deeds of the wicked they
[1:15:31] judge not the cause the cause of the
[1:15:33] fatherless yet they Prosper right David
[1:15:35] was upset with this one time how why did
[1:15:37] the wicked prosper and he said I
[1:15:39] wondered about it until I went to the
[1:15:41] house of God and God showed me their
[1:15:44] end right God showed me the end of their
[1:15:46] life their despair at their death or he
[1:15:48] also showed them where they'll end up in
[1:15:51] Hades the regions of the lost the
[1:15:54] regions of the the prison
[1:15:56] house and the right of the needy do they
[1:15:59] not judge shall I not visit for these
[1:16:01] things sayith the Lord shall not my soul
[1:16:04] be Avenged on such a nation as
[1:16:07] this a again all these great blessings
[1:16:10] all these great blessings but they don't
[1:16:12] apply the wisdom of God to their daily
[1:16:15] life
[1:16:17] Hallelujah I seen it this week or you
[1:16:19] know I talking to this guy at taekwon do
[1:16:21] practice and he he's building a new
[1:16:23] house his dream house he's in his 60s
[1:16:25] and one company did him wrong and you
[1:16:27] know he's got he he's got the the proof
[1:16:29] he could sue
[1:16:31] them he's got that you know he's got
[1:16:33] he's got that option but I said brother
[1:16:35] I said pray about it first before you
[1:16:38] send that letter c that certified letter
[1:16:40] I said send the right certified letter
[1:16:42] send a send a certified prayer up to God
[1:16:44] before you do that right I mean so rich
[1:16:47] and so so much power to do these things
[1:16:50] and the Bible said Christians shouldn't
[1:16:51] even do things like that right taking
[1:16:54] people to court and everything like
[1:16:56] that my it's
[1:16:59] just it doesn't fit the character of God
[1:17:02] they become great and wax and Rich and
[1:17:05] they're they're so uh encompassed with
[1:17:08] the cares of this
[1:17:10] world now personally I think it might
[1:17:12] have been a mistake to build that dream
[1:17:14] house personally right that's just I
[1:17:17] don't know you know what's going to
[1:17:20] happen I mean you might live five more
[1:17:21] years you get to Joy for 5 years 10
[1:17:23] years what could have been done want
[1:17:25] that money for the kingdom of God you
[1:17:26] know I don't know it just I just things
[1:17:28] you wonder you know was God in that you
[1:17:30] have to seek God for each one right
[1:17:33] Jeremiah
[1:17:41] 44:17 but we will certainly do
[1:17:44] whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
[1:17:46] own mouth to burn incense under the
[1:17:48] Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink
[1:17:50] offerings unto her as we have done we
[1:17:52] and our fathers and our Kings and our
[1:17:53] princes in the cities of Judah and in
[1:17:54] the streets of Jerusalem for then they
[1:17:56] had plenty of victuals and were well and
[1:17:58] saw no
[1:18:00] evil so see when they had plenty of food
[1:18:03] and everything was good they saw no evil
[1:18:05] that's when they were LED astray into
[1:18:08] idolatry right in church I've showed
[1:18:09] this
[1:18:10] before which church in the message is
[1:18:12] the most idolatrous brandom Tabernacle
[1:18:15] who's got all the money brandom
[1:18:17] Tabernacle hundred over hundred million
[1:18:19] dollars right and they idolized brother
[1:18:22] R they idolized tapes doesn't seem
[1:18:24] famili may do that seem premor right
[1:18:28] just because some people got a lot of
[1:18:30] money a lot of fing that don't mean
[1:18:31] they're right with
[1:18:32] God right it don't mean
[1:18:35] nothing right and many times that's when
[1:18:37] they start falling away when they get so
[1:18:39] much such money such influence like
[1:18:42] we've seen a lot of these 24 false
[1:18:44] doctrines that's just what I found they
[1:18:45] started coming out after they've got all
[1:18:47] this money it wasn't when they were
[1:18:49] small come on
[1:18:51] Church they just they were just they
[1:18:53] were just encouraging the preacher to to
[1:18:55] give give people tapes well then when
[1:18:57] they got big now they start pushing
[1:18:59] their
[1:19:00] agenda you don't need the preachers you
[1:19:02] just need one voice I tell you you need
[1:19:04] the voice of Christ through the bride
[1:19:06] amen because the spirit and the bride
[1:19:07] say come Hallelujah the bride has a
[1:19:10] voice too
[1:19:12] Hallelujah you can see
[1:19:15] it Jeremiah
[1:19:18] 49:31 see I've been combing through
[1:19:21] Jeremiah and all these nuggets in
[1:19:23] here arise get you up unto the wealthy
[1:19:26] nation that dwelleth without care sayith
[1:19:28] the Lord which have neither Gates nor
[1:19:30] bars which dwell
[1:19:32] alone then God's going to destroy them
[1:19:35] see they dwell without care no cares in
[1:19:37] the world except God's going to send in
[1:19:39] a surprise surprise chastening to them
[1:19:43] there no cares in the world everything's
[1:19:44] going fine everything's going good
[1:19:45] that's when God's going to bring
[1:19:48] correction right rich and increased with
[1:19:50] Goods have need of nothing it's the
[1:19:53] prosperity trap we've all got to be
[1:19:55] careful
[1:19:55] of that's right church that's
[1:19:58] right it say trap uh Jeremiah okay we
[1:20:03] did that one okay Ezekiel 1649 I'm
[1:20:06] trying to bring this down here Ezekiel
[1:20:15] 1649 I felt inspiration when I read
[1:20:18] these behold this was the iniquity of
[1:20:20] thy sister Sodom Pride fullness of bread
[1:20:23] and abundance of ESS was in her and her
[1:20:25] daughters neither did she strengthen the
[1:20:26] hand of the poor and needy so rich and
[1:20:30] and and and so blessed right so
[1:20:32] prosperous yet not even able to lift a
[1:20:34] finger to help the
[1:20:36] needy right see this and of course then
[1:20:39] all of course this chapter is about the
[1:20:40] two daughters uh I'm sorry the Two
[1:20:43] Sisters right that were Wicked before
[1:20:45] God Israel and Samaria and they had all
[1:20:47] this idolatry they forsook God idolatry
[1:20:50] again Idols in their lives something
[1:20:53] became more important than God
[1:20:56] all right so it's this Prosperity trap
[1:20:59] job said it too job 16:12 go put that up
[1:21:02] there Casa job said when I was at ease
[1:21:04] that's when the trial came
[1:21:07] ease he hath broken me aunder he had
[1:21:10] taken me by the neck and shaken me to
[1:21:11] pieces and set me up for his Mark but
[1:21:13] remember God's in heaven saying you're
[1:21:15] perfect job devil look at Job look at
[1:21:18] job but on Earth he needed correction he
[1:21:21] still needed to grow in Grace and
[1:21:22] knowledge of the Lord right
[1:21:25] as much as God was using him and
[1:21:26] blessing him he still needed a further
[1:21:28] revelation of
[1:21:30] God he was at ease remember the Bible
[1:21:32] said job said everything I feared Came
[1:21:35] Upon me so he was at he had fear battles
[1:21:38] right battle fear and then he was at
[1:21:39] ease everything was too loose and too
[1:21:41] easy so I my prayer say God keep me on
[1:21:44] my knees keep me humble before you keep
[1:21:47] me seeking your face wanting more of you
[1:21:50] Hallelujah and please keep the idols out
[1:21:52] of my life amen
[1:21:57] um let's do a couple more verses I
[1:22:00] probably have to save this for I'm not
[1:22:01] preaching Sunday next Wednesday by God's
[1:22:04] grace but let me do a couple more
[1:22:07] verses
[1:22:10] Hallelujah I thought I'd get the
[1:22:11] different some different verses here
[1:22:13] hallelujah all well uh Jeremiah 10:25
[1:22:16] Jeremiah
[1:22:18] 10:25 this goes back to whatever you do
[1:22:20] as a family church do it
[1:22:23] together
[1:22:39] now wait maybe that's not the right
[1:22:40] verse let me see I'm reading that
[1:22:43] Jeremiah 10:25 did I write that
[1:22:46] down says pour out thy Fury upon the
[1:22:49] Heathen that Know Thee not and upon the
[1:22:51] families that call not on thy name yes
[1:22:53] families that call not On th name for
[1:22:55] they have eaten up Jacob and devoured
[1:22:56] him and consumed him and made his
[1:22:58] habitation
[1:23:00] desolate see the family has to call upon
[1:23:02] the name of Christ each one of us even
[1:23:06] little children can call upon the name
[1:23:07] of Jesus Hallelujah we saw it last year
[1:23:10] and at least we Napoleon right I saw
[1:23:12] Haven calling upon the name of Jesus I
[1:23:13] saw AAA calling upon the name of Jesus
[1:23:16] right Hallelujah the families got a call
[1:23:20] but God I'm saying he says I'm bringing
[1:23:21] my wrath and fury on the families that
[1:23:24] do not call upon the name of God no one
[1:23:26] his family called upon the name of God
[1:23:28] and the other families that don't God
[1:23:30] brings wrath upon them so all of our
[1:23:33] families must call upon God so so so uh
[1:23:36] you know like even this week Lydia God
[1:23:38] let things come upon us so we'll call
[1:23:39] upon God hallelujah go through trials go
[1:23:43] through sufferings go through difficult
[1:23:44] situations why so it'll teach you to
[1:23:46] call upon
[1:23:49] God that's exactly
[1:23:52] right so it's you learn it as a family
[1:23:54] you go through it together as a family
[1:23:57] you overcome by the grace of
[1:24:00] God
[1:24:02] ah help me
[1:24:10] Jesus not sure how I should close this
[1:24:12] here by God's gra help me Lord
[1:24:15] um I want to I'll just close with two
[1:24:18] more verses and maybe I'll preach a full
[1:24:19] sermon on this next time
[1:24:23] um so brother Dennis took us to Isaiah
[1:24:25] 58 remember so let's go there I'll just
[1:24:27] briefly read this
[1:24:31] over let me just give a humble warning
[1:24:34] because I need them
[1:24:35] too Isaiah 58
[1:24:42] 1-6 and again I'm sharing this just you
[1:24:44] know from my heart I truly believe look
[1:24:47] at at brother Dennis's life he's on
[1:24:50] fire now if you're born again your
[1:24:53] Soul's on fire
[1:24:55] but if you're going through a trial your
[1:24:56] mind might not be on fire you might have
[1:25:00] complexes strongholds the Bible says but
[1:25:03] when I looked at him when I heard him
[1:25:04] preach brother amen I'm like that guy's
[1:25:05] on fire he's blasting out sin he's
[1:25:09] rebuking it it's a different
[1:25:12] sound
[1:25:15] Hallelujah cry aloud spare not verse one
[1:25:18] lift up thy voice like a trumpet and
[1:25:20] show my people their transgressions and
[1:25:21] the house of Jacob their sins show them
[1:25:24] their sins yet they seek me daily look
[1:25:26] at this every day they seek God so
[1:25:29] church we got to go more Beyond just
[1:25:30] saying well I sought God today we got to
[1:25:32] make sure we got the sins out of our
[1:25:34] lives this is what I was so brother
[1:25:36] Dennis showed this to me while we were
[1:25:37] at
[1:25:39] Aladdin and they didn't have rock and
[1:25:41] roll
[1:25:42] on yeah they seek me daily and Delight
[1:25:44] to know my ways as a nation that did
[1:25:46] righteousness and forsook not the
[1:25:47] ordinance of their God they ask of me
[1:25:49] the ordinance of Justice they take
[1:25:51] Delight in approaching God so every day
[1:25:53] they delight in God every day they
[1:25:55] enjoyed
[1:25:56] it right don't you think the Pharisees
[1:25:58] enjoyed some element of their worship
[1:26:00] don't you think the music was nice don't
[1:26:02] you think they had a good worship
[1:26:04] service I doubt they had bad
[1:26:07] music don't you think they don't you
[1:26:09] think they enjoyed lifting their hands
[1:26:10] sometimes and seeing the sunrise and
[1:26:12] looking at the temple and thinking wow
[1:26:14] God is so good don't you think don't you
[1:26:15] think they enjoyed part of that but yet
[1:26:18] when Jesus came and they blasphemed him
[1:26:19] Jesus said you're full of dead men's
[1:26:22] bones right
[1:26:25] and church they fasted twice a
[1:26:27] week see that proves and you know
[1:26:30] fasting is popular now TED Talks made it
[1:26:33] popular I saw
[1:26:35] it they got like 30 million views now
[1:26:39] everybody's fasting now and they're not
[1:26:41] even
[1:26:42] believers they ain't going to get the
[1:26:44] same
[1:26:45] benefit right A little exercise profit
[1:26:48] you little but they're not going to get
[1:26:50] the spiritual benefit of fasting the way
[1:26:52] God says to fast
[1:26:57] see so they got sin their lives yet they
[1:27:00] seek God every day and they have enjoy
[1:27:02] approaching God through prayer worship
[1:27:04] and
[1:27:06] sacrifice wherefore Hast we fasted say
[1:27:08] they and thou seest not so they felt
[1:27:10] like God wasn't hearing their prayers
[1:27:12] wherefore have we Afflicted our soul and
[1:27:14] thou takest no knowledge behold in the
[1:27:16] day of your fast you find pleasure and
[1:27:18] exact all your labors now he's going to
[1:27:20] tell us why verse four behold you fast
[1:27:23] for strife and bait and to Smite with a
[1:27:25] fist of wickedness they were fasting in
[1:27:28] order to gain some type of uh victory
[1:27:31] over their enemies in a
[1:27:33] debate right for selfish reasons because
[1:27:36] they still had sin in their lives their
[1:27:39] motive was not to have the heart of God
[1:27:41] toward their their enemies but it was
[1:27:43] just to be right and overcome their
[1:27:46] enemies see that then when they were
[1:27:49] fasting they weren't saying God created
[1:27:50] me a clean heart they were saying God
[1:27:52] give me ammunition to strike down my
[1:27:55] enemy to win this debate or to win this
[1:27:57] argument or to make myself look like I'm
[1:27:59] right and yet they went to church every
[1:28:02] day they they saw they read their Bibles
[1:28:03] every day church this is amazing portion
[1:28:06] of
[1:28:09] scripture and to Smite with the fist of
[1:28:12] wickedness so they would hit the people
[1:28:14] that were righteous they'd hurt the
[1:28:16] righteous
[1:28:19] people this is why they fasted so they
[1:28:21] could find a way to hurt the people
[1:28:24] right with in a wicked way I'm going to
[1:28:27] preach on that eventually I'm going to
[1:28:28] preach on the the whole all the
[1:28:29] scriptures on uh slander and railers
[1:28:33] because I've been slandered a lot lately
[1:28:35] of course these last few years but
[1:28:36] especially these last few months I've
[1:28:38] been slandered and railed on and Paul
[1:28:40] said if you Rail and slander on people
[1:28:41] you will not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:28:44] and that's what they were fastened for
[1:28:46] to win a debate to Smite somebody to
[1:28:48] really knock them down and show them who
[1:28:51] is
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:57] ye shall not fast as you do this day to
[1:28:58] make your voice to be Heard On High see
[1:29:00] they wanted their their ideas their uh
[1:29:02] their argument to be
[1:29:06] heard verse five is this a fast that I
[1:29:09] have chosen a day for a man to afflict
[1:29:10] his soul is it to bow down his head as a
[1:29:12] bull rush and to spread sackcloth and
[1:29:14] Ashes under him will thou call this a
[1:29:16] fast and acceptable day of the Lord God
[1:29:17] said is this why is this what I call a
[1:29:19] fast so you could just win an
[1:29:21] argument that God said no
[1:29:24] verse six is not this the fast that I
[1:29:26] have chosen to loose the bands of
[1:29:28] wickedness now what did Brother McBride
[1:29:30] say he was fasting for for his
[1:29:32] children not for himself for his
[1:29:35] children to serve God to get saved to
[1:29:38] get the Holy Ghost to marry the right
[1:29:41] person fasting for other people but see
[1:29:44] the the the Israel here the S they were
[1:29:47] fasting just for their own voice to be
[1:29:49] Heard On High make me exalted make me
[1:29:52] win something right make make me look
[1:29:55] like the great person but when you fast
[1:29:57] the right way it's fasting for other
[1:30:01] people but then if you do that like
[1:30:03] brother McBride said then you'll get
[1:30:04] some blessings for
[1:30:05] yourself you live for others God will
[1:30:08] bless
[1:30:11] you to loose the bands of wickedness to
[1:30:13] undo the heavy burdens to let the
[1:30:15] oppressed Go free and ye that you break
[1:30:17] every yoke verse 7 deal bread to the
[1:30:20] hungry bring the poor that are cast out
[1:30:22] to thy house when th seest the naked
[1:30:24] cover him and that thou hide not thyself
[1:30:26] from thine own flesh then shall thy
[1:30:28] light Break Forth as the morning and thy
[1:30:30] hell shall spring forth feely or
[1:30:32] speedily and thy righteousness shall go
[1:30:34] before Thee the glory of the Lord shall
[1:30:35] be thy real reward then Thou shalt call
[1:30:38] and the Lord shall
[1:30:41] answer Thou shalt cry and he shall say
[1:30:43] here am I if thou take away from the
[1:30:46] midst of Thee the Yoke the putting forth
[1:30:47] of the finger and speaking Van
[1:30:50] Vanity look at verse 11 and the Lord
[1:30:52] shall guide thee continually it's like
[1:30:55] God blessed every decision in your life
[1:30:58] he guided me here he guided me there
[1:31:00] he's guided me everywhere amen
[1:31:03] hallelujah and satisfy thy soul in the
[1:31:06] drought isn't this a time of spiritual
[1:31:08] drought the Bible says that in Amos
[1:31:11] they'll run forth to and fro and it's a
[1:31:13] drought Hallelujah but God's people will
[1:31:16] have the word of God
[1:31:18] hallelujah and make thy bones fat and
[1:31:21] thou shalt be like a watered garden and
[1:31:23] like a spring of water whose Waters fail
[1:31:27] not verse 14 then shalt thou Delight
[1:31:30] thyself in the Lord I will cause thee to
[1:31:31] ride upon the high places of the earth
[1:31:33] and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob
[1:31:35] thy father for the mouth of the Lord has
[1:31:36] spoken
[1:31:37] it so again I just I love how brother
[1:31:40] Dennis showed this to me the most
[1:31:41] religious people every day seeking God
[1:31:43] delighting to praise God and go to
[1:31:45] church and yet they had sin in their
[1:31:47] hearts and they were fastened for the
[1:31:48] wrong reason so they got the wrong
[1:31:52] results but if you fast the right way
[1:31:55] you get the right
[1:31:57] results now my last verse let's stand my
[1:32:00] last verse Ezekiel 37 Malachi can come
[1:32:03] 31 and 32 Ezekiel 3731 I read this this
[1:32:06] week and I was like oh my goodness what
[1:32:08] a beautiful
[1:32:13] verse Ezekiel 3731 and
[1:32:17] 32 Ezekiel 3731 and
[1:32:22] 32
[1:32:30] wait no I'm sorry it's 33 sorry I got
[1:32:33] bad chicken scratched there Ezekiel 3331
[1:32:37] and 32
[1:32:42] sorry now why this applies to us
[1:32:44] churches because I hear myself preach
[1:32:46] right and I think about what I
[1:32:48] preach and I'll say something like this
[1:32:50] we've got to draw a night to God right
[1:32:52] we got to get closer to God but
[1:32:54] sometimes I just say that church and
[1:32:55] sometimes I don't do it like I ought to
[1:32:58] and if you're all honest you would say
[1:32:59] Amen but you don't have to I'll say amen
[1:33:04] amen right we talked about we talk about
[1:33:06] seeking God for the Rapture seeking God
[1:33:08] for gift seeking God for all these
[1:33:09] things now who's going to do it it's e
[1:33:12] it's so easy to say it but then who's
[1:33:13] going to do it and it goes back to the
[1:33:16] condition of the house are the pillars
[1:33:18] set up in the
[1:33:20] house so you can do
[1:33:22] that look at this verse look at these
[1:33:25] verses and they come unto thee as people
[1:33:27] cometh and they sit before thee as my
[1:33:29] people my people and they hear thy words
[1:33:31] but they will not do them like James
[1:33:35] says don't be just a hearer of the word
[1:33:38] be a doer of the word in other words if
[1:33:40] you heard the word of God tonight then
[1:33:41] have a passion to hear more of it have a
[1:33:44] fervent desire to please God and reach
[1:33:47] out in the Holy
[1:33:49] Spirit that's how you know you're on
[1:33:51] fire amen hallelujah do it
[1:33:54] for with they with their mouth they show
[1:33:56] much love oh God's so good we're the
[1:33:58] bride we got the Holy Ghost that's I'm
[1:34:01] talking about things I say I'm not I'm
[1:34:02] not saying you I'm me me I say all these
[1:34:06] things as a Preacher Brother Austin but
[1:34:08] if I don't do it it don't do me no
[1:34:12] good and I can become cold on God
[1:34:16] too I can go through difficult Seasons
[1:34:19] right we say all we we sing brother amen
[1:34:21] can put all the right songs up there I'm
[1:34:23] I'm a Child of God yes I am you
[1:34:26] know I'll see you in the rapture we we
[1:34:29] see all the with with our mouth we show
[1:34:31] all this love to God but are we doing
[1:34:34] what the word of God tells us to
[1:34:38] do but their heart goeth after their
[1:34:43] covetousness now let me let me just be
[1:34:46] honest if I've got something I need
[1:34:48] let's say
[1:34:50] uh what do I order recently on Amazon I
[1:34:53] just need something like for the house
[1:34:54] on Amazon and let's say I think of that
[1:34:56] in the
[1:34:58] morning church I could be tempted well I
[1:35:00] better get this on Amazon because my
[1:35:02] family needs this tempt to do that
[1:35:04] rather than pray or maybe it's I need a
[1:35:07] new something for my computer like a a
[1:35:09] mouse or something right what does our
[1:35:12] heart go
[1:35:15] after but I got but just but just you
[1:35:18] have other Mouse you don't actually have
[1:35:20] to you don't have to have a mouse I'm
[1:35:21] not saying I do that but I'm just trying
[1:35:23] to think of an example I've been tempted
[1:35:25] to do that
[1:35:27] right see with our mouth we show all
[1:35:30] this love to God but then when it comes
[1:35:32] down to it what are we really doing
[1:35:34] hallelujah what are we following after
[1:35:37] this a real good striking cutting
[1:35:38] message here tonight I didn't I didn't
[1:35:40] Envision this brother amen I this is not
[1:35:42] the way I picture this sermon not at
[1:35:44] all just kind of came out that
[1:35:47] way because I'm just trying to be honest
[1:35:50] I'm trying to look at these scriptures
[1:35:51] as I've been reading through these here
[1:35:53] and but brother Dennis is sharing with
[1:35:55] us there's a reason God had us to hear
[1:35:57] these
[1:35:58] sermons verse
[1:36:00] 32 and lo Thou Art unto them as a lovely
[1:36:03] song of one that hath a pleasant voice
[1:36:07] and can play well on an instrument for
[1:36:09] they hear thy words but they do them not
[1:36:13] oh it sounds so lovely oh the singing
[1:36:15] and doesn't that remind you of Isaiah 58
[1:36:18] daily they seek me daily they Delight
[1:36:20] approaching unto me they even fast but
[1:36:23] it's all for the wrong
[1:36:25] reasons so see you have people like Leo
[1:36:28] deia I don't have need of nothing I
[1:36:30] never seek God well that's probably not
[1:36:31] you and
[1:36:32] I right we'll at least read our Bible
[1:36:34] pray we'll listen to a sermon or
[1:36:35] something
[1:36:38] something that's not us this is
[1:36:41] something that would be more easily to
[1:36:43] tempt us where we might struggle and the
[1:36:45] church said I like to hear good amen at
[1:36:48] the end Hallelujah that sermon was not
[1:36:50] in vain Hallelujah somebody's going to
[1:36:51] be blessed tonight Hallelujah let's bow
[1:36:53] our heads here tonight Hallelujah this
[1:36:56] really struck my heart I read that this
[1:36:58] week and I wrote down my people he but
[1:37:01] they will not do with our mouths we show
[1:37:04] we show so much love but we're Covetous
[1:37:06] at
[1:37:07] times I said God be merciful to me I
[1:37:11] want to be a man that if I speak all
[1:37:13] this love for God I'm going to back it
[1:37:15] up with my life how many raise their
[1:37:17] hand say Lord let that be my life too my
