[0:00] be in the nurse's hands. We could be in
[0:02] all kinds of different hands. But thank
[0:04] God we're in the hands of Jesus Christ
[0:06] today. Hallelujah. Thank God for his
[0:08] mercy and his grace. Hallelujah.
[0:13] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10.
[0:29] I'll read uh 10 and 11 in of the Lord
[0:31] Jesus Christ. Finally, my brethren, be
[0:35] say you might want to like Adam said
[0:36] last night. He didn't say you might want
[0:38] to try to be strong. He didn't say try.
[0:40] He said be strong.
[0:43] As our brother said last night, it's a
[0:45] command from God.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; So, not just men. Now, now this is
[0:48] speaking to men and women, right? But
[0:50] last night, Joshua, we're looking at
[0:51] men. But of course, our men, we want all
[0:54] our men to be strong. Be strong in the
[0:56] Lord, in the power of his might. Put on
[0:58] the whole armor of God that ye may be
[1:01] able to stand against the ws of the
[1:04] devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:06] and blood, but against principalities,
[1:09] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:11] the darkness of this world, against
[1:13] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:16] Let's read uh 13 together. One, two,
[1:19] three. Wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:22] armor of God that ye may be able to
[1:25] withstand in the evil day and having
[1:28] done all to stand. Amen. Let's have one
[1:31] more word of prayer. If you have a need
[1:32] on your heart, let's make it known unto
[1:33] God. You can lift your hand or lift your
[1:35] heart to God. Father God, you see the
[1:37] hands today, my hands up. Lord, each
[1:39] heart, no doubt, Lord, that's in right
[1:41] condition wants something from you
[1:42] today, Lord God. And we just worship you
[1:45] today. We thank you for the hands of
[1:46] Jesus, Lord. You reached out your hand,
[1:49] Lord, and took us out of the miry clay,
[1:51] Lord God. Saved us by your grace.
[1:53] Hallelujah. We're in your predestinated
[1:55] plan, Lord God. And we're so grateful
[1:57] for that. Hallelujah. Lord, the
[1:59] footsteps of the righteous are order of
[2:00] the Lord. You've ordained this service,
[2:02] Lord, this weekend. We're so thankful
[2:04] for you bringing your servant, Brother
[2:05] Adam, here and for this testimony time.
[2:08] And Lord, I know it had a great impact
[2:09] last night, Lord God. And just bless him
[2:11] again today. Lord, as we look to your
[2:13] word, we just lay the foundation for the
[2:15] testimony that's coming, Lord God. I
[2:17] pray you'd bless each and every one,
[2:18] Lord God. Speak to the young. Speak to
[2:20] the adults, Lord God. We'll be very
[2:22] thankful when we leave this place.
[2:24] Hallelujah, with the mighty hands of
[2:26] Jesus in control of our lives, God. We
[2:28] give you glory, God. And we ask that
[2:30] your Holy Ghost would have preeminence
[2:31] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints
[2:33] said,
[2:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're taking
[2:36] your seats here.
[2:38] Not going to forget. I'm going to set a
[2:39] timer here by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[2:42] So, I'm just going to kind of preach a
[2:43] little thought called we wrestle not
[2:45] against flesh and blood just for about
[2:47] 30 minutes here and sometimes I got to
[2:49] take it over a little five minutes
[2:50] extra. So, we'll see how uh it goes
[2:52] today. But we're really excited for the
[2:54] testimony today. I told brother Adam,
[2:56] you know, probably have a few more young
[2:57] people here today, a few more sisters
[2:59] here today. And so, we'll see how the
[3:01] Holy Spirit, you know, directs his
[3:02] testimony today. Hallelujah.
[3:05] Now, we do have a recording from last
[3:07] night if the uh sisters, you know, the
[3:09] adult sisters would like to listen to
[3:10] it. I I don't think the the children
[3:13] should listen to it, you know, because
[3:14] it was more directed towards men. But if
[3:16] the adult sisters, you know, are
[3:18] interested in that, you're more than
[3:19] welcome. I I'm going to try to get up on
[3:21] YouTube today in a private setting and
[3:23] then just share the link. Of course, I
[3:25] share it with all
