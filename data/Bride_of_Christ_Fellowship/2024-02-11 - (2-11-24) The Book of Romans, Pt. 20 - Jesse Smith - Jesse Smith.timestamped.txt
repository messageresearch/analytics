[54:30] service we haven't even preached the
[54:32] word
[54:33] yet I'm looking forward to the word
[54:36] today amen God bless you let's take our
[54:38] Bibles here that's what I like I like
[54:40] the freedom of the
[54:54] Holy
[54:56] Romans chapter 8:31 I'd like to look at
[54:58] part 20 of the book of Romans um I just
[55:01] shared that testimony on Wednesday you
[55:03] know brother Brian was so blessed to be
[55:05] here and he said you just have such a
[55:07] sweet people I get that from every
[55:09] preacher you know I just so I think it's
[55:11] true by God's grace if every preacher
[55:13] tells me that I think I think that's
[55:15] right and he just said uh you know on
[55:18] that on the evening service he said
[55:19] brother amen only sang three songs and
[55:21] the church was in he said in such one
[55:22] Accord he said I walked out there and it
[55:25] was one of the most powerful anointings
[55:26] I felt in a long time to preach the word
[55:28] of God and he said that proved to me
[55:30] brother Jesse he said it doesn't matter
[55:32] the number of songs it matters the
[55:34] quality of the worship just a nice
[55:36] reminder that God and and he said
[55:38] brother amen is so sincere he said he
[55:40] said the church was singing he said all
[55:42] the girls singing he said it was so
[55:44] sincere and that's what we want sincere
[55:46] worship yes amen there's times we're
[55:48] fighting battles we might have to just
[55:49] press through and we feel like we're
[55:51] pretending but we're really just
[55:52] pressing through our doubts and our
[55:53] battles and then that's sincere that's
[55:56] sincere if you're trying to press
[55:58] through that's sincerity praise God
[56:00] hallelujah so God bless you I just you
[56:02] know I love hearing testimonies like
[56:03] that and it was hard to miss my fifth
[56:06] service in eight or 17 years but I just
[56:08] had to do it I didn't want to spread
[56:09] germs here by God's grace but I'm back
[56:11] we're glad to be back in the house of
[56:12] the Lord with all of you and good to see
[56:13] all the saints today uh Romans chapter 8
[56:16] verse 31 we left off on verse 30 a
[56:19] couple weeks ago by the grace of the
[56:21] Lord and uh we'll look to the word of
[56:24] God here today

[56:53] longer and there it will by God's grace
[56:56] there'll be no end to the Joy no end to

[57:00] forward to such a time as that praise
[57:02] God Romans 8:31 this is finish it we'll
[57:05] try to finish Lord willing chapter 8
[57:07] here today by the grace of God and such
[57:11] a beautiful chapter some people have
[57:13] called this may be their favorite
[57:15] chapter in the Bible Romans chapter 8
[57:17] and I could see why I could totally
[57:18] understand that because the truths that
[57:20] are presented in this
[57:23] chapter Romans
[57:30] 8:31 let's just read verse 31 we can
[57:32] read it together with our voices then
[57:33] we'll have one more word of prayer as uh
[57:36] before we're seated let's read it on
[57:37] three one two three what shall we then
[57:40] say to these things if God be for us who
[57:44] can be against us praise God let's have
[57:47] one more word of prayer if you have a
[57:48] need on your heart let's make it know to
[57:49] God you know we saw the three unspoken
[57:50] needs I'm sure each one of us have a
[57:52] need on our hearts let's ask God to
[57:54] minister we're filled with joy we're
[57:56] filled with the worship of God and let's
[57:57] receive God's word today Hallelujah
[57:59] surely this uh service was ordained
[58:01] before the foundation of the world
[58:03] father God we thank you for your mercy
[58:04] and love every day is ordained Lord God
[58:06] but we can recognize Lord when uh Lord

[58:12] God so just get us out of your way may
[58:14] the Holy Ghost have his way today

[58:31] hear through them Lord and I also need
[58:33] to hear Lord just minister to every need
[58:35] today those that'll hear it live Lord
[58:37] those on the archive like maybe my
[58:38] brother Lord or someone like that I pray
[58:40] you speak to them in the name of Jesus
[58:42] Christ we'll give you all the glory
[58:44] today in Jesus Christ's name and the
[58:46] church said amen God bless you as you're
[58:48] being seated praise
[58:53] God
[58:58] okay so I do have a few quotes and
[59:00] slides here maybe we'll share by the
[59:01] grace of the
[59:11] Lord
[59:14] hallelujah you know I just love that I
[59:16] love the liberty of the Holy Spirit
[59:17] don't you
[59:18] amen I love it and I just I just want to
[59:21] be sensitive to it you know I just want
[59:22] to sense are the people wanting to
[59:23] worship more or
[59:25] I'm always trying to like ask myself
[59:26] that brother amen you know how it is
[59:28] should we worship some more do they want
[59:30] to do more how much en energy do we have
[59:33] today Hallelujah and uh so I sure enjoy
[59:36] that I love worshiping the Lord
[59:39] hallelujah and I don't know if that it's
[59:41] okay if I don't hook up but you know
[59:42] it's no problem so we want to continue
[59:44] this uh series on here on Romans uh by
[59:46] God's grace it's been a real blessing to
[59:49] me and here we get into uh you know the
[59:52] beginning here of Paul's seven questions
[59:55] we know seven is the number of
[59:56] completion praise God and so uh you know
[59:59] Paul's finishing this chapter here uh in
[1:00:02] such a awesome manner I'd say a Divine
[1:00:06] manner Hallelujah now remember uh the
[1:00:08] book of Romans Scofield broke it up into
[1:00:10] these parts I don't want to have to move
[1:00:13] back on the slides I'm just going to
[1:00:14] read it right out of my Scofield bible
[1:00:17] uh the first part is the whole world
[1:00:18] after the introduction is the whole
[1:00:19] world is guilty before
[1:00:21] God all have fallen short of the glory
[1:00:24] of God hallelujah there's none not
[1:00:26] worthy no not one praise God none of us
[1:00:28] are worthy but he's going to give us
[1:00:30] white robes praise God we're not worthy
[1:00:32] but he's going to give us a crown
[1:00:33] hallelujah amen hallelujah what what
[1:00:36] love such love that God would love a
[1:00:38] sinner such as I amen how wonderful is
[1:00:40] love like this we should start breaking
[1:00:42] into another song
[1:00:43] Maybe Hallelujah such love of God and
[1:00:47] then the next part is uh I'm sorry it's
[1:00:50] justification through faith it's the
[1:00:52] righteousness of Christ and the
[1:00:55] resurrection of Christ I'm sorry yeah
[1:00:57] the righteousness of of God by faith and
[1:01:00] the gospel is the remedy for all of our
[1:01:02] guilt amen the good news is that Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ the righteous died for the
[1:01:08] unrighteous thank you Jesus and then he
[1:01:10] rose and the Bible says the proof God
[1:01:13] forgives you is the resurrection amen
[1:01:17] how many believe he resurrected 2,000
[1:01:18] years ago that's the proof that he's
[1:01:21] accepted you amen the only way God can
[1:01:24] accept you is he if he accepts your
[1:01:27] sacrifice and if God Rose Jesus from the
[1:01:29] dead then God accepted his sacrifice
[1:01:31] that means we the worshipper have all
[1:01:34] the benefits of the sacrifice we are
[1:01:36] Justified amen we are forgiven
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen it's already been proven
[1:01:41] to the whole world God already proved he
[1:01:43] loved us through the cross and then God
[1:01:45] already proved he forgive us through the
[1:01:47] resurrection
[1:01:49] hallelujah amen what a powerful truth
[1:01:53] Paul gives us here in the book of r
[1:01:54] Romans M no doubt this could settle all
[1:01:57] the questions between the Jews and the
[1:01:58] Gentiles doesn't the doesn't the Bible
[1:02:01] solve all your problems between you and
[1:02:02] your disagreement maybe you're
[1:02:03] disagreeing with your friends yes or
[1:02:06] church members or or family members the
[1:02:08] gospel uh takes away all the guilt the
[1:02:11] gospel answers all the questions the
[1:02:13] gospel solves all the problems
[1:02:15] Hallelujah and brings such a Unity to
[1:02:17] the people where they can realize we are
[1:02:20] the people of God we are the family of
[1:02:23] God I don't want any uh hindrances
[1:02:26] between my family members yes like in
[1:02:28] your house you don't want any divisions
[1:02:30] you don't want any uh walls of
[1:02:32] Separation you want a house of peace and
[1:02:35] that's what the family of God is a house
[1:02:37] of love a house of Peace a house of
[1:02:39] forgiveness Hallelujah a house of
[1:02:41] longsuffering Hallelujah there's joy in
[1:02:44] the house of the Lord amen praise God
[1:02:47] hallelujah amen that's what the gospel
[1:02:49] does Amen takes away all the guilt all
[1:02:51] the shame
[1:02:52] Hallelujah cuz we're allil guilty before
[1:02:55] God and we that means we're all worthy
[1:02:57] of death but God has forgiven us
[1:02:58] hallelujah thank you Jesus and made us
[1:03:00] all the same we're all forgiven by the
[1:03:02] blood of Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:03:04] the third part after the remedy for
[1:03:06] Guilt is the crucifixion of Christ in uh
[1:03:09] Romans 5 and then the resurrection of
[1:03:12] Christ re Romans 6 and then the walk in
[1:03:15] the spirit which is chapter 7 and now
[1:03:17] chapter
[1:03:18] 8 you know the end of chapter 8 Lord
[1:03:21] willing next time we look at the book of
[1:03:22] Romans uh begins the next series or I'm
[1:03:26] sorry here the next section it would be
[1:03:28] the uh full result in the blessing of
[1:03:30] the Gospel here there in chapter nine by
[1:03:34] God's grace and also then how the gospel
[1:03:36] does not abolish the Covenant promises
[1:03:38] to Israel so I love this Paul solves all
[1:03:41] the questions in the church with Jew and
[1:03:43] Gentile and then he takes special time
[1:03:45] after that to deal with Israel because
[1:03:47] there's so many questions about Israel
[1:03:49] yes you know Jesus had said those words
[1:03:51] you know my blood's on you and your F
[1:03:53] your children you know so there's a lot
[1:03:54] there no doubt was a lot of
[1:03:56] questions Paul said you know because uh
[1:03:59] because you blashe I go to the Gentiles
[1:04:01] well does that mean all the Jews well of
[1:04:02] course not hose Jose and I had a good
[1:04:05] conversation about that yesterday you
[1:04:07] know God's always gonna there's always
[1:04:08] going to be some Jews that can see
[1:04:10] Christ because the bride according to
[1:04:11] Revelation 79 has to be from All Nations
[1:04:14] all kindreds all tongues hallelujah amen
[1:04:17] it has to be a member uh uh from every
[1:04:19] nation a bride member from every nation
[1:04:21] that includes Israel but it'll be a
[1:04:23] small group praise God but Paul has to
[1:04:25] deal with that and but first before he
[1:04:27] can deal with Israel he has to finish
[1:04:29] this off I'll say like this he's got to
[1:04:31] put an exclamation mark at the end of
[1:04:32] that time Hallelujah that's what chapter
[1:04:35] eight is amen this exclamation mark that
[1:04:38] there's no condemnation to us amen if
[1:04:41] you got the Holy Ghost you are an
[1:04:43] adopted son of God Amen you're an
[1:04:46] adopted daughter of God I means you have
[1:04:48] authority you have a family relationship
[1:04:51] with God hallelujah and then God gives
[1:04:53] you Witnesses is that you are a child of
[1:04:56] God Amen and then you know all things
[1:04:59] work together for good because you love
[1:05:01] God hallelujah amen and then we Rejoice
[1:05:04] I couldn't love God unless he loved me
[1:05:07] first amen now and then you know last
[1:05:10] time we looked at and now we get Paul
[1:05:12] gives us understanding after that now
[1:05:14] he's predestinated every event of our
[1:05:16] lives so we would be conformed to be
[1:05:19] like Christ amen we don't have to wonder
[1:05:22] you know why did I struggle for so long
[1:05:24] why was I away there you why did I live
[1:05:26] over there why did I live here we don't
[1:05:28] have to struggle anymore because we know
[1:05:30] God was doing that so we could be formed
[1:05:32] to be like Christ amen thank
[1:05:37] Hallelujah and so we have that con that
[1:05:40] consolation that he's conforming us to
[1:05:42] the image of Christ because he fornew us
[1:05:46] remember then he elected us and then he
[1:05:48] called us and then we recognize it amen
[1:05:51] and then he justified us thank you Jes
[1:05:53] and Friends as brother man said he's
[1:05:55] already glorified you amen he's already
[1:05:58] got a glorified body waiting for you in
[1:06:00] the heavens

[1:06:06] that he has done thank you Jesus Oh

[1:06:19] say to these things these things about
[1:06:22] adoption these things about uh the Holy
[1:06:25] Spirit if we have the Holy Spirit he'll
[1:06:28] Quicken our mortal bodies that's in this
[1:06:29] chapter too this is a treasure Trope I
[1:06:31] use that phrase a lot but this is a
[1:06:33] treasure Trove of Bible truth amen
[1:06:36] remember brother R said he turned to
[1:06:37] Romans 4 every time he got depressed how
[1:06:39] about you and I turn to Romans 8 every
[1:06:41] time we get depressed Hallelujah the
[1:06:43] first verse you'll be encouraged I don't
[1:06:45] have any condemnation Hallelujah there's
[1:06:48] no damnatory sentence Jesus will look at
[1:06:51] me and say I knew you remember all the
[1:06:53] other church members that that disobey
[1:06:55] the word he'll say I never knew you but

[1:07:25] things now Paul gives us seven questions
[1:07:27] again so this is a
[1:07:29] complete questioning here of anyone who
[1:07:32] doubts God's love that's what this
[1:07:34] service is just going to be about today
[1:07:36] we should never doubt God's love amen
[1:07:39] now we will but we should start maturing
[1:07:42] and I believe we are by God's grace we
[1:07:44] should keep maturing and remembering how
[1:07:47] much God loves us amen and Paul is going
[1:07:50] to bring us through and show us all
[1:07:52] these proofs that God loves loves us

[1:14:20] mentality this gives us the over Comer
[1:14:25] mentality I tell I tell you church this
[1:14:27] is what we need especially when we go
[1:14:28] through
[1:14:29] trials it's easy to say this when we're
[1:14:32] on the
[1:14:33] Mountaintop but this is what we need
[1:14:35] Even in our trials yes we need to
[1:14:38] remember that if God is for me even
[1:14:41] though I'm suffering then this suffering
[1:14:43] will not last yes amen this suffering
[1:14:47] will not overcome
[1:14:49] me God allow this suffering amen God
[1:14:52] allow this trial and I'll overcome this
[1:14:54] trial by his grace hallelujah
[1:14:59] amen now I want to move I want to come
[1:15:02] back to this but let me go down here did
[1:15:03] you ever hear about this when when uh
[1:15:06] there was a famous uh philosopher named
[1:15:08] Socrates I've never heard of Socrates in
[1:15:10] school I didn't read up too much on him
[1:15:12] but I just looked at this here you know
[1:15:14] uh what in college I had some a few
[1:15:16] really good
[1:15:17] professors I remember one of Dr Thompson
[1:15:19] called me out because I was talking too
[1:15:20] much one time he said Mr Smith stop
[1:15:22] talking
[1:15:24] sorry yeah my buddy was from the church
[1:15:27] and we were just joking too much and
[1:15:28] that really that really rebuked me
[1:15:30] because he called me out in front of
[1:15:31] everybody but that proved he loved me if
[1:15:33] you love me rebuke me
[1:15:35] right but I had this one instructor
[1:15:38] named Dr Broadway and when I had other
[1:15:40] uh friends that went to acan they had
[1:15:41] him too and he would just walk in the
[1:15:43] class he just sit on the
[1:15:45] table wait till we all got quiet and
[1:15:47] then he would just start asking us
[1:15:49] questions he never lectured us he just
[1:15:52] asked us questions the entire higher
[1:15:53] class
[1:15:54] period I'm like this guy's different
[1:15:57] usually the the teachers up there they
[1:15:59] just lecture okay this was in 1742 and
[1:16:01] this was
[1:16:03] 1927 remember that not this guy this guy
[1:16:07] was different and everybody in the
[1:16:08] education College knew him because he
[1:16:10] was the
[1:16:13] questioner questioner on the sea
[1:16:15] children no he was a good questioner but
[1:16:18] what but he had this method what method
[1:16:19] was it I I say like this this is God's
[1:16:22] method
[1:16:23] Socrates didn't invent this church
[1:16:26] that's right if there's anything good in
[1:16:27] education it didn't come from man it
[1:16:29] come from God that's right there's
[1:16:31] anything good in science it didn't come
[1:16:32] from Einstein it come from God
[1:16:35] hallelujah Einstein's dead and gone now
[1:16:37] and now they're learning more things
[1:16:39] they come from God it's what God allowed
[1:16:41] us to see but this was such a different
[1:16:44] class and I'll tell you church I was on
[1:16:46] my toes because I'm a shy person I was a
[1:16:48] shy person I didn't like to answer
[1:16:49] questions now now I'm comfortable I've
[1:16:51] been preaching for 20 years now now I
[1:16:53] can answer some questions that the
[1:16:54] children ask me and they're really good
[1:16:56] questions sometimes I'm stumped at least
[1:16:59] I can say I don't know but I'll tell you
[1:17:00] when I was growing up I was real
[1:17:01] insecure my dad left me and I I didn't
[1:17:03] ever want to ask a question I was just
[1:17:04] like don't call me don't I I look at
[1:17:06] anything else don't don't look at me
[1:17:09] chew my nails like I got tie my shoe I
[1:17:11] didn't want anybody to call on me right
[1:17:14] because I was afraid of questions I
[1:17:15] would stutter sometimes I still do
[1:17:17] stutter you know that's okay but you
[1:17:20] know I thought where did this come from
[1:17:22] this actually came from God and I just
[1:17:25] thought why would Paul end the chapter
[1:17:27] with questions well here's why so this
[1:17:30] method of question asking is a
[1:17:32] thought-provoking dialogue between an
[1:17:34] instructor and their students so when
[1:17:35] when the the instructor asks questions
[1:17:37] he's trying to have a dialogue a
[1:17:39] conversation he don't just want to hear
[1:17:41] a yes or no or a b c
[1:17:44] d you know uh 1942 God don't want to
[1:17:47] hear that God wants you to have a
[1:17:50] conversation with
[1:17:51] him yes
[1:17:53] how do you baptize uh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] acts 238 thank you God okay you may you
[1:17:57] may sit
[1:17:58] down now there's times you might need
[1:18:00] that right that's the gift of knowledge
[1:18:01] you might need the scripture reference
[1:18:02] like uh Phillip had
[1:18:04] Hallelujah on Wednesday
[1:18:07] night but you know this and that's what
[1:18:09] it was when Dr Broadway would sit down
[1:18:10] we'd have a conversation I'll tell you
[1:18:12] that hour and a half went by pretty fast
[1:18:14] because I was on my toes like okay I
[1:18:17] better do my reading next time too I
[1:18:18] better do my homework I shouldn't skip
[1:18:20] at this time I didn't like to read those
[1:18:22] books you know I was like I got the I I
[1:18:24] was just saved how could I want to read
[1:18:25] those books when I just got my Bible I'm
[1:18:28] like I'm
[1:18:29] highlighting I mean every little break I
[1:18:31] just go back to my Bible listen to
[1:18:32] brother
[1:18:33] BR put on my a Walkman any anybody know
[1:18:36] what a Walkman is no you don't know
[1:18:39] children you don't
[1:18:41] know but it was it was a dialogue it was
[1:18:44] a
[1:18:45] conversation when you ask questions it's
[1:18:47] a conversation not they got to be good
[1:18:49] questions not just yes or no questions
[1:18:52] it's based upon the approach used by
[1:18:53] Socrates who's known he's it's engaging
[1:18:56] young
[1:18:57] minds in conversations designed to help
[1:19:00] Define broad ideas and also expose the
[1:19:03] complexities and ambiguities between
[1:19:07] them so see it it helps you it helps you
[1:19:10] it helps engage with the the teacher and
[1:19:12] the
[1:19:13] students right and that's why God uses
[1:19:15] it it engages when God asks a question
[1:19:18] well we gotta we actually got to think
[1:19:19] what God said we can't move on well now
[1:19:21] I'll just go do whatever I want to do
[1:19:23] God's asking you a question he wants to
[1:19:25] know what do you think about it what are
[1:19:27] you going to say what's in your heart I
[1:19:31] want to hear your testimony right what
[1:19:34] have you learned what do you think about
[1:19:36] it he wants to have a conversation
[1:19:38] aren't you glad God wants to talk to you
[1:19:40] praise
[1:19:41] God that's what Paul's doing here what
[1:19:44] shall we say to these things what would
[1:19:47] you say if you're you're a son you're a
[1:19:49] Son of God brother amen sister Z you're
[1:19:52] an adopted daughter of God what will you
[1:19:54] say then to these things what do you say
[1:19:55] brother Jose what do you say what do you
[1:19:57] say to all these things you say well if
[1:19:59] God's for me who can be against me right
[1:20:02] Amen in other words it don't matter who
[1:20:05] comes against me as long as God's on my
[1:20:06] side amen
[1:20:08] amen
[1:20:11] hallelujah instead of giving information
[1:20:13] and facts instead of just lecturing
[1:20:16] you the instructor using the Socratic
[1:20:19] method teaches ask students a series of
[1:20:22] open-ended questions it's not just a yes
[1:20:24] or no oh do you love God have you been
[1:20:27] baptized okay are you filled with the
[1:20:29] Holy Ghost it's more than that what has
[1:20:33] the Holy Ghost baptism done for you
[1:20:36] brother now we're getting into something
[1:20:38] a little deeper here now Hallelujah
[1:20:41] that's a good question that's a good
[1:20:43] question you can ask me too not just for
[1:20:45] preachers it's
[1:20:47] everybody I love how Paul ends this
[1:20:49] chapter I'm giving you seven questions
[1:20:52] now you got something to to think about
[1:20:54] now we can
[1:20:55] Fellowship now we can talk amen now you
[1:20:59] can tell Daddy what what your thoughts
[1:21:01] are you can talk to your dad you can
[1:21:03] have a conversation with him I'm glad I
[1:21:05] got a dad I can talk to amen my natural
[1:21:07] dad not so much but if you do enjoy it
[1:21:10] but if not when I hear you got some good
[1:21:12] questions from your father Papa God Amen
[1:21:15] you saved me from my old life you
[1:21:17] forgave me hallelujah
[1:21:20] amen so and then in turn the students
[1:21:22] can
[1:21:23] questions of their own and I remember a
[1:21:25] couple times the teachers would or the
[1:21:27] students would go back and ask Dr
[1:21:28] Broadway and he just kind of give that
[1:21:30] smirk you think you can outsmart me and
[1:21:33] he returned their question with another
[1:21:34] question you know we would go through
[1:21:36] the class just trying to how can we get
[1:21:38] this
[1:21:41] guy uh so who the instructors that
[1:21:43] implement this they're they're
[1:21:45] facilitators they're guides amen didn't
[1:21:48] brother R preach the sermon the guide
[1:21:50] who's your guide who's guiding you
[1:21:51] through life Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:21:54] God's own son hallelujah amen he's your
[1:21:57] God yeah there's times God just lectures
[1:21:59] us he tells us this this this this is
[1:22:01] what the Bible said this but then
[1:22:02] there's times in the Bible he'll give
[1:22:04] you lots of
[1:22:06] questions and church the questions make
[1:22:08] us dig down deep I'm thankful for
[1:22:11] questions I've learned I'm not afraid of
[1:22:13] questions I mean but I know sometimes I
[1:22:15] have to labor over some more than
[1:22:18] others
[1:22:21] Hallelujah see uh the the instructor is
[1:22:24] not just the the provider of all the
[1:22:26] information it compels the students to
[1:22:29] consider why things are a certain way
[1:22:31] why is my life this
[1:22:34] way why did God uh sister beus why did
[1:22:38] God send you across the ocean to live in
[1:22:40] America when all your friends and family
[1:22:42] are in Ghana brother Jose why did God
[1:22:45] lead you from Nicaragua to come the
[1:22:47] United
[1:22:48] States Hallelujah he's had that
[1:22:51] conversation amen amen
[1:22:53] hallelujah he talked it over a few times
[1:22:57] right see it also allows you uh to
[1:23:01] consider why things reasons so reasons
[1:23:04] didn't God say Israel come and reason
[1:23:07] together with me that's what he's saying
[1:23:08] come and talk to me about your
[1:23:10] sins just come and talk to me tell me
[1:23:13] why you did it and then I'll forgive you
[1:23:15] if you repent and then I'll wash you
[1:23:16] white as snow
[1:23:18] Hallelujah that's what this is this is a
[1:23:21] conversation and many times God would
[1:23:23] speak through the prophet to have the to
[1:23:25] give the questions so that the church
[1:23:27] could ask the questions or they could
[1:23:30] answer the questions and then give
[1:23:32] different points of view on a topic well
[1:23:34] the prophet would have a certain point
[1:23:36] of view but then the lady might have a
[1:23:37] different point of view
[1:23:40] right so what's the benefits of this it
[1:23:44] uh encourages students to explore your
[1:23:46] thoughts and beliefs so see church
[1:23:49] sometimes there's questions in our lives
[1:23:50] like difficult seasons why did God allow
[1:23:52] this it actually shows you what's on the
[1:23:54] inside of
[1:23:55] you is that
[1:23:58] right helps you explore well what do
[1:24:00] what do I believe about
[1:24:03] God have I had do I have all the right
[1:24:06] ideas about God is my heart in the right
[1:24:09] place is what I'm
[1:24:11] saying see that's what questions do they
[1:24:14] make you go deeper you got to stop and
[1:24:16] Ponder and a lot of these questions you
[1:24:18] can't ask Siri the answer for
[1:24:21] that Mrs Google won't tell you the
[1:24:23] answer to that one right hey Google they
[1:24:27] won't tell you the answer because they
[1:24:29] don't know it there's not a yes or no
[1:24:31] answer it's a complex answer right it
[1:24:35] takes deep deeper thinking than
[1:24:38] that see the questions make you look
[1:24:40] inside of you glory amen hallelujah
[1:24:43] what's inside of my heart what do I
[1:24:46] believe what do I think that's why times
[1:24:49] when we go through life where there's a
[1:24:50] lot of questions those are important
[1:24:52] important seasons of life because it
[1:24:54] makes you reflect and ask yourself what
[1:24:57] do I believe about
[1:24:59] God and it will reveal what you actually
[1:25:03] it will reveal the real person like
[1:25:04] brother man says you uh you
[1:25:07] know you know Pentecost was the test
[1:25:10] Pentecost was the litmus test Judas
[1:25:12] didn't get there because he didn't pass
[1:25:14] the test it proved what he was the the
[1:25:18] trial of arrest and crucifixion that
[1:25:21] that was a test there was a lot of
[1:25:22] questions wait how is our Master uh
[1:25:24] getting arrested wait he's the Messiah
[1:25:26] wait die
[1:25:28] what and he saw as an opportunity oh I
[1:25:31] can make some money see so it it brought
[1:25:34] out the real Judas right what was in the
[1:25:37] thief heart he loved the money more than
[1:25:40] he loved the word but it brought out the
[1:25:42] real genuine Holy Ghost Christian and
[1:25:45] all the other ones hallelujah
[1:25:48] amen I love
[1:25:50] that Copus and his friend are walking on
[1:25:52] the road to meas on the Resurrection
[1:25:55] Sunday I thought he was supposed to do
[1:25:56] this I thought Jesus would do this they
[1:25:59] got all these
[1:26:00] questions Hallelujah I love it they're
[1:26:03] they're walking all these miles I foret
[1:26:05] it was maybe 15 miles to Emmas and then
[1:26:08] in their questions Jesus steps out and
[1:26:10] aren't these Beautiful Moments he didn't
[1:26:12] step out at the beginning he waited a
[1:26:14] while he let them go through a season of
[1:26:16] questions in their lives and the church
[1:26:18] said amen and then after this season
[1:26:21] this kind of Journey of what do you
[1:26:23] think why well there's that scripture
[1:26:26] what about this why are we doing why why
[1:26:28] are we scattered how come the church is
[1:26:29] scattered why are we living in
[1:26:31] fear and after all these questions here
[1:26:34] comes the answer
[1:26:36] Giver here comes the guide amen here
[1:26:39] comes the great shepherd He steps out he
[1:26:41] said I'm going to start preaching at
[1:26:43] Moses and I'm going to show you all the
[1:26:45] scriptures that pertain to the guide
[1:26:48] Hallelujah and I'm going to answer all
[1:26:50] your questions right down through this
[1:26:51] conversation ation and still they didn't
[1:26:54] know it was
[1:26:55] him until the until he I love this he
[1:26:58] acted like I'm going to leave you all
[1:27:00] right I got to go and brother Bram said
[1:27:03] it was a test to see if they wanted
[1:27:05] Jesus to stay and church that's how we
[1:27:08] can do every service there's going to be
[1:27:10] moments where we feel like uh uh the
[1:27:13] anointing is leaving and brother R said
[1:27:14] that's your time to cry out to God and
[1:27:16] say God don't leave us let this Holy
[1:27:19] Spirit remain here praise God hallelujah
[1:27:22] just stay with us we don't want you to
[1:27:24] leave us amen we want more of you
[1:27:26] hallelujah amen we can't even have
[1:27:28] church unless we got you Jesus
[1:27:31] amen it's a
[1:27:33] test
[1:27:37] Hallelujah so we see it we we want to be
[1:27:40] we want to pass the
[1:27:43] test so see that's what we got church we
[1:27:45] got a lot of
[1:27:46] assumptions see the questions make us
[1:27:49] dig deep down inside what are our what
[1:27:51] do we assume about God now just here's a
[1:27:53] good example with all these sick people
[1:27:54] we many times we just assume God's going
[1:27:56] to heal them now normally that's the
[1:27:57] case right God heals he promises all
[1:27:59] your diseases but then there's times
[1:28:02] where he chooses PE people to suffer
[1:28:03] like job or like Elisha where God takes
[1:28:06] Elisha home for sickness had an awful
[1:28:09] sickness but it that's what it does it
[1:28:12] makes us look at our assumptions and it
[1:28:14] makes us forget our ideas and makes us
[1:28:17] accept the ideas of
[1:28:19] God it makes us look higher than
[1:28:21] ourselves
[1:28:23] Hallelujah this method also helps Foster
[1:28:26] critical thinking enabling students to
[1:28:28] reach their own conclusions based on
[1:28:30] self-analysis of the information just
[1:28:32] versus just accepting what they're told
[1:28:34] how many churches they do they say just
[1:28:36] press play just press play and they sit
[1:28:39] there
[1:28:41] like right now you could do lots of
[1:28:43] different uh false false doctrines
[1:28:46] Joseph Smith is a prophet they tell the
[1:28:48] Mormon Church yes I know he's a prophet
[1:28:50] yes but there's no critical analysis
[1:28:52] what about his failed prophecies you
[1:28:53] know and that's why it's okay to have
[1:28:55] questions about brother br's Ministry he
[1:28:57] said prove me by the word and if you
[1:29:00] really look honestly you'll find the
[1:29:01] right answer he was a prophet of God
[1:29:03] hallelujah amen amen and God's not
[1:29:06] afraid of your questions Hallelujah he's
[1:29:09] the one that gave them can I say like
[1:29:11] that God allowed your questions and so
[1:29:13] God is going to give you the answers
[1:29:15] hallelujah amen God has allowed everyone
[1:29:18] to have their questions and so God just
[1:29:20] wants to see how long you'll wait and
[1:29:22] search your own heart for your
[1:29:23] assumptions how long will you wait and
[1:29:25] search out until God gives you the
[1:29:27] answer right amen all right now we're
[1:29:31] getting somewhere here by God's grace
[1:29:33] and still to this day that's probably my
[1:29:35] most memorable college class the
[1:29:39] questioner I looked it up a few years
[1:29:40] ago I couldn't find him I think he
[1:29:41] already retired but I sure like to talk
[1:29:43] to that guy
[1:29:45] again so the first question what do we
[1:29:48] say to all these truths number two if
[1:29:51] God be before for us who can be against
[1:29:53] us who can be against you now we've
[1:29:57] shouted a lot we rejoiced a lot but
[1:29:59] what's interesting and I I I have to but
[1:30:01] what's interesting is later on he's
[1:30:02] going to say we're just like sheep that
[1:30:04] are slaughtered all the day long but
[1:30:06] don't forget that that's part of the
[1:30:07] chapter
[1:30:10] too in other words you're a you're a
[1:30:12] sheep of God which wolf can be against
[1:30:15] you but yet I'm going to allow you to go
[1:30:17] through sufferings I'm GNA allow the
[1:30:19] Wolves to get pretty close to you
[1:30:21] sometimes
[1:30:23] Hallelujah wasn't Satan whispering in
[1:30:25] brother bram's ear I thought you said
[1:30:27] God's A Healer yet God took your wife
[1:30:29] and your Sharon Rose I thought he was a
[1:30:31] Healer I thought you said he was a good
[1:30:34] God he
[1:30:36] is questions Hallelujah but God has all
[1:30:39] the
[1:30:41] answers Satan the Lord gives and the
[1:30:43] Lord takes away blessed be the name of
[1:30:45] the
[1:30:46] Lord amen I got your answer amen God
[1:30:50] give me the answer
[1:30:54] so God is for you dear
[1:30:59] sheep but yet God allows you to go
[1:31:01] through suffering sometimes all the day
[1:31:07] long you wake up sick and you're sick
[1:31:09] all day how about that Mal or you're
[1:31:12] sick for two weeks
[1:31:13] or you're sick for
[1:31:16] months and it feels like I'm just dying
[1:31:19] and where am I ever how am I ever going
[1:31:20] to get the victory
[1:31:22] God's got answer for
[1:31:24] you nobody can be against you Hallelujah
[1:31:27] this won't destroy you you'll overcome
[1:31:29] this you'll be stronger on the other
[1:31:32] side of this hallelujah amen amen
[1:31:36] hallelujah if he spared not his own
[1:31:41] son if God let Jesus go through all the
[1:31:44] badgering of his life think about that
[1:31:46] brother Bram said he looked like he was
[1:31:47] 50 years old he was
[1:31:50] 30 he that spared not his own son but
[1:31:53] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:31:56] not with him also freely give us all
[1:32:00] things wow if God delivered up
[1:32:04] Jesus then God will also give us all
[1:32:08] things
[1:32:11] Hallelujah so in other words if he's
[1:32:13] given you the no condemnation promise
[1:32:16] he's going to give you everything else
[1:32:17] that you need Hallelujah what's the most
[1:32:20] important question am I saved my lost if
[1:32:22] he's already solved that if he's already
[1:32:24] given you that he's going to give you
[1:32:26] every other answer for every other
[1:32:28] question in your life hallelujah amen
[1:32:31] all let's say all things can we all
[1:32:33] things he's going to free and freely
[1:32:36] freely you're not going to earn them
[1:32:39] right you're not gonna have to pay for
[1:32:41] them he's going to freely give them as a
[1:32:44] sheep right as you go through the trials
[1:32:46] of Life he's going to freely give you
[1:32:48] all things that pertain to Godliness the
[1:32:49] Bible says Peter says that amen
[1:32:53] hallelujah remember if he didn't spare
[1:32:55] up his own son the Bible says also other
[1:32:57] places we got to suffer in order to
[1:32:59] reign with him right so there's two qu
[1:33:03] there's three questions now won't he
[1:33:04] give you all things
[1:33:06] freely hallelujah it's free but
[1:33:09] sometimes you got to wait for it praise
[1:33:10] God hallelujah might be free but you got
[1:33:13] to wait for it Hallelujah verse 33 who
[1:33:16] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:33:20] God's elect
[1:33:22] it is God that justifieth
[1:33:25] amen that's your fourth question who's
[1:33:28] going to put any charge on your heavenly
[1:33:30] account like you're guilty of something
[1:33:32] the Bible said God already Justified
[1:33:35] you he dropped the chares Jesus dropped
[1:33:39] the CH we might sing that next
[1:33:41] Hallelujah although I was wrong amen I
[1:33:44] need a washboard in here hallelujah and
[1:33:46] a thimble who's got my thimble
[1:33:48] hallelujah amen he dropped the charges
[1:33:51] amen
[1:33:52] there's no charges to God's
[1:33:56] elect so you have a clean slate in
[1:33:59] heaven uh Austin sins I don't I don't
[1:34:02] there's none I don't see any it's a
[1:34:03] really short piece of paper
[1:34:05] brother it just says zero or I'm sorry
[1:34:07] paid in full
[1:34:09] redeemed amen I'm sorry pardoned yeah it
[1:34:12] says pardoned
[1:34:14] amen they ain't there they ain't there
[1:34:17] they're not there Hallelujah I use some
[1:34:19] real English there
[1:34:22] I don't find
[1:34:24] any God's for me there's no charge
[1:34:26] against me in other words Satan is not
[1:34:29] allowed to write on your paper Austin
[1:34:31] prise the Lord Lydia Satan's not allowed
[1:34:34] to write on your paper oh I saw Lydia do
[1:34:37] this I saw brother Jesse do this God
[1:34:40] said nope St this is my list I bought
[1:34:43] this list amen
[1:34:46] hallelujah you can't touch what I bought
[1:34:48] this is my property
[1:34:50] amen I've already paid for this
[1:34:54] Hallelujah can't lay anything to this
[1:34:56] charge this is my list Hallelujah this
[1:34:59] is my child Hallelujah stay back Satan
[1:35:02] and you know he's got to get
[1:35:03] back Hallelujah that's a good fourth
[1:35:06] question who's going to put anything on
[1:35:08] your account in heaven nobody because
[1:35:11] God already Justified you thank you
[1:35:13] Jesus God already prepared a perfect uh
[1:35:17] charge there's no
[1:35:18] charges a perfect account Hallelujah
[1:35:21] paid in for Hallelujah the blood has
[1:35:24] paid the price
[1:35:26] Hallelujah you you you and I used to
[1:35:28] have these long now mine was really long
[1:35:30] I didn't have just one sheet I probably
[1:35:31] had about 10 sheets of
[1:35:33] sins but when Jesus died it was all
[1:35:36] nailed to the cross and it's like God

[1:36:33] where did Paul get this where did
[1:36:34] Socrates get it they got it from
[1:36:37] God who is he that condemneth question

[1:36:44] child of
[1:36:45] God if God said you're pardoned who is
[1:36:49] going to who is going to dis agree with
[1:36:53] God who's going to say God you know what
[1:36:56] you're wrong God will just go and just
[1:36:59] get he said get behind me right that's
[1:37:02] right he just say
[1:37:04] go who who can condemn if God is the if
[1:37:08] God is the judge of the universe and he
[1:37:10] knows all the secrets of our hearts and
[1:37:12] he sees all things and knows all things
[1:37:14] has no beginning has no end who could
[1:37:17] condemn a child of God
[1:37:19] hallelujah who's going to condemn one of
[1:37:21] God's
[1:37:22] children just like today I just say in

[1:37:51] nothing can condemn the children of God
[1:37:53] there's no condemnation to them who are
[1:37:55] in Christ Jesus amen why because Christ
[1:37:58] died for
[1:38:00] me yay

[1:41:21] tribulation cannot separate us from the
[1:41:23] love of God hallelujah amen the church
[1:41:26] keeps marching on and the Bible says it
[1:41:28] plain the more the church gets P
[1:41:29] persecuted the more the church grows or
[1:41:32] spreads right we know we're having less
[1:41:34] and less Believers but it'll keep
[1:41:35] spreading the more persecution there are
[1:41:37] it'll cause real people to say that's
[1:41:39] real love that's God's love that's
[1:41:41] Divine love they'll die for Christ I'll
[1:41:43] die for Christ amen amen
[1:41:49] amen who's going to separate you from
[1:41:53] the love of Christ now think about this
[1:41:56] church isn't it just the devil's one of
[1:41:58] his favorite tricks God don't love
[1:42:00] you God doesn't love you if he loved you
[1:42:03] he would have kept you from that what if
[1:42:04] job would have said
[1:42:06] that what if Abraham would have said
[1:42:10] that oh God I wish you would have kept
[1:42:12] me from making this mistake with Hagar
[1:42:13] too late too late now you got a big Isa
[1:42:16] or Sor a good big ishma and but he's got
[1:42:19] promises too see God has a purpose for
[1:42:21] all your mistakes there's a purpose for
[1:42:23] all your mistakes amen right just trust

[1:42:43] no no matter what tribulation go through
[1:42:46] it'll never make God's love leave
[1:42:49] you will will
[1:42:51] distress job said I went through months
[1:42:54] of distress I just read read it
[1:42:55] yesterday I was going through the Book
[1:42:56] of Job again these are the longest
[1:42:59] months my we've had some pretty awful
[1:43:01] months with sickness but nothing like
[1:43:02] Joe but we've been sick since November
[1:43:04] November December January thank God
[1:43:06] February came Hallelujah we've been
[1:43:09] through almost three awful months of
[1:43:10] sickness when is the stomach thing going
[1:43:12] to
[1:43:14] leave that's just a few months with the
[1:43:16] just natural stomach sickness not boils
[1:43:18] all over us with f funerals to attend as
[1:43:21] well of his own
[1:43:24] children right did distress separate job
[1:43:28] from God's love you ever see where God
[1:43:31] says well you know devil you're right I
[1:43:33] I don't know maybe job will curse curse
[1:43:35] me and I don't know if I love job is
[1:43:38] God's love ever in question for job
[1:43:42] never did God ever waver and say let me
[1:43:44] think about it uh I I don't know no in
[1:43:49] fact he said the same thing every time I
[1:43:50] like that brother have you considered my
[1:43:52] servant job that's right a man who's
[1:43:55] perfect he he excuses he runs from Evil
[1:43:59] have you considered
[1:44:00] him God don't change his tune about you
[1:44:03] that's right you're already Justified he
[1:44:06] already loves you you're already
[1:44:08] glorified right he don't change his tune
[1:44:12] it's the same so this the the distress
[1:44:14] of job could not make God forget about
[1:44:18] him God's love never let left him
[1:44:21] despite his wife wanting to curse God W
[1:44:23] him to curse God losing the children
[1:44:26] losing all his finances God's love never
[1:44:28] was separated from him hallelujah
[1:44:32] amen I think one proof of that is that
[1:44:35] job just wanted to talk to God about it
[1:44:37] amen because these are questions in his
[1:44:39] mind I just wanted the Bible said I wish
[1:44:41] uh the Bible said there's a I wish there
[1:44:43] was a a a mediate a mediator between God
[1:44:46] and man I forget the actual word it's
[1:44:48] different in the it's different in the
[1:44:50] King James
[1:44:51] a a daan I think it's a daan I wish
[1:44:53] there was a daan between God and he said
[1:44:55] there's no daan between man and God and
[1:44:57] then brother BR says no there was Eli
[1:45:00] who come around and he was a type of
[1:45:02] Christ hallelujah amen let me give you
[1:45:04] the word of God I'll intercede between
[1:45:07] you and God let me give you the word of
[1:45:10] God hallelujah God gave it to
[1:45:13] him persecution did the early church uh
[1:45:18] were they separated from God's love as
[1:45:19] their persecu
[1:45:21] when James was was slaughtered in prison
[1:45:23] and martyred did the did God's love ever
[1:45:26] leave James or Stephen no never left
[1:45:29] them in fact we see Jesus standing ready
[1:45:31] to receive
[1:45:33] Stephen come up to heaven my
[1:45:35] son see it doesn't it doesn't separate
[1:45:38] us from the love of
[1:45:40] God
[1:45:42] nothing the third one
[1:45:45] famine right think about uh Lazarus the
[1:45:48] beggar he's like I just want want the
[1:45:50] crumbs I just want the crumbs man that
[1:45:53] rich man can I just have the crumbs that
[1:45:56] fall from your table and he wouldn't
[1:45:58] even do that sometimes did that separate
[1:46:01] Lazarus from the love of God no because
[1:46:02] as soon as he died he went right to
[1:46:04] Abraham he went come here come here son
[1:46:07] yeah that's right father and son come
[1:46:09] here Father Abraham let me give you a
[1:46:10] big
[1:46:12] hug you mean he wasn't cursing God like
[1:46:14] why did I have to suffer that's why I
[1:46:16] told those Ugandan people the and the
[1:46:18] Kenyan people begging me for money I
[1:46:19] said I'm out right now I said when I get
[1:46:21] some more I'll let you know but they're
[1:46:23] begging me like brother Jesse we're
[1:46:24] going through famine I said I know my
[1:46:25] heart's breaking but what but shall
[1:46:27] famine separate you from the love of God
[1:46:31] we don't get to choose which one we go
[1:46:33] through right which one which one you
[1:46:36] how about do you want do you want the
[1:46:37] sword do you want the the gun do you
[1:46:39] want to face prison do you want to be
[1:46:40] locked in prison none of us would choose
[1:46:42] that but God needs an overcomer God
[1:46:45] needs somebody who says I love you no
[1:46:47] matter what and I'll never be separated
[1:46:49] from your love hallelujah amen
[1:46:54] amen none of us well I some of us were
[1:46:57] close to it you
[1:46:58] know none of us have probably been
[1:47:00] through a famine like a seven-year
[1:47:02] famine in Egypt
[1:47:04] right remember the dirt I love the dir
[1:47:07] agabus said thus sayith the Lord there's
[1:47:08] coming a dir and so the Saints got all
[1:47:10] their extra food ready and send it over
[1:47:12] there to the Saints in Jerusalem when
[1:47:14] they went through the famine God has a
[1:47:15] way to take care of his children praise
[1:47:17] God sometimes those blessings just come
[1:47:19] in the mail that's Hallelujah you didn't
[1:47:22] ask for it they just somehow come
[1:47:25] Hallelujah nakedness I which of us have
[1:47:28] had very little clothes I know Jose had
[1:47:30] very few growing up we were talking
[1:47:31] about that
[1:47:33] yesterday but even if you don't have
[1:47:35] many clothes even if you're po that poor
[1:47:38] it doesn't mean that God has taken his
[1:47:40] love from
[1:47:41] you it just means that's the that that's
[1:47:44] the situation the Sheep is going through
[1:47:47] but the great Shepherd is always there
[1:47:49] amen
[1:47:50] Hallelujah in the church asan book I
[1:47:52] love that quote I read a few months ago
[1:47:54] brother R said God might permit you to
[1:47:56] death or cancer or or something he said
[1:47:59] but it's God's prerogative It's God's
[1:48:01] purpose it's God's
[1:48:04] choice he said uh he said bright skies
[1:48:07] and and increase of goods is not always
[1:48:09] the sign of God's love right he said the
[1:48:13] proof of God's love is your election
[1:48:16] amen the fact he called you to be a
[1:48:18] Christian that's God's proof to you
[1:48:20] hallelujah amen hallelujah the proof God
[1:48:23] wouldn't let you stay in your drug
[1:48:25] addict and God wouldn't let me stay in
[1:48:27] my drug addict and my spce addict and my
[1:48:30] awful movie addict God wouldn't let me
[1:48:32] say in that that's his proof that he
[1:48:33] loves me
[1:48:36] Hallelujah
[1:48:37] glory amen and how about the
[1:48:41] sword I thought of this Peter took out
[1:48:43] the sword and I look just stand still he
[1:48:45] cut off his ear can you imagine a saint
[1:48:46] of
[1:48:49] God imagine that virtue virtues laughing
[1:48:51] there Peter's
[1:48:53] like I'll never deny you and then a few
[1:48:56] minutes later he's like I'm out of
[1:48:58] here and Jesus picks it up be healed
[1:49:02] malus right be healed malus be
[1:49:05] healed did that did that act of violence
[1:49:08] think about that Saints did that act of
[1:49:09] violence separate Peter from God's love
[1:49:12] did Peter just say okay now I'm
[1:49:13] officially done with you you were
[1:49:16] sinking out on the
[1:49:18] water you were telling me not to go to
[1:49:19] the cross and now the sword you've used
[1:49:21] the sword to cut off someone's ear I'm
[1:49:23] done with you Peter it's it's
[1:49:24] over no he still gave he gave the keys
[1:49:27] anyway he gave him the keys when he knew
[1:49:28] that was going to happen the church said
[1:49:31] God gave you the authority even before
[1:49:33] he before you made the mistakes
[1:49:34] Hallelujah and he said there to forgive
[1:49:36] you Hallelujah he's there to show you
[1:49:38] his love nothing can change God's love
[1:49:40] for you hallelujah amen sword won't do
[1:49:43] it now whether you're delivered to the
[1:49:45] sword like Paul and martyred the sword
[1:49:48] he knew the sword could not separate him
[1:49:49] from from the love of God yeah you mean
[1:49:52] this little metal sword that's
[1:49:53] eventually going to rust out you mean
[1:49:54] this is going to keep me from the love
[1:49:56] of Christ
[1:49:57] impossible soon as that sword goes
[1:49:59] through my neck I'll be with my Lord who
[1:50:02] loves me yes Hallelujah and died for
[1:50:07] me I think that's beautiful Peril all
[1:50:10] the distresses remember Paul said I've
[1:50:12] got troubles without I've got troubles
[1:50:14] within I he said I have troubles without
[1:50:16] I have all fears within a holy ghost
[1:50:19] filled man fill with the fear of all the
[1:50:22] the troubles and still that would not
[1:50:25] separate him from the love of God
[1:50:32] Amen so he l seven there and that was
[1:50:34] his seventh and final
[1:50:36] question the seventh question has seven
[1:50:38] elements to it is that something seven
[1:50:40] times
[1:50:43] seven that's the seventh and final
[1:50:46] question shall any of these separate you
[1:50:48] from God's love
[1:50:50] no the answer is
[1:50:52] no think about that none of those none
[1:50:55] of those separated any of the Believers
[1:50:58] from God's
[1:51:01] love why it's written so Paul gives us
[1:51:04] the answer for thy sake we are killed
[1:51:07] all the day
[1:51:09] long we are counted as sheep for the
[1:51:14] slaughter so here's the questions five
[1:51:16] six and seven and this just like a
[1:51:18] paradox you know you know brother says
[1:51:20] the church is an invincible Army she is
[1:51:23] what it means is her soul has been
[1:51:26] sealed it's sealed it's it's permanent
[1:51:30] right it's marked it's sealed like
[1:51:33] brother said signed sealed and delivered
[1:51:35] praise God hallelujah it's sealed unto
[1:51:39] the day of redemption
[1:51:41] amen you've got a permanent uh fixture
[1:51:45] you've got a permanent uh connection to
[1:51:47] God and it's it's sealed all the way
[1:51:50] through no matter what uh brother said
[1:51:52] no M no no no matter what mountains or
[1:51:54] valleys or Trails you go through you are
[1:51:57] sealed and you will reach your day of
[1:51:59] redemption hallelujah amen whatever path
[1:52:02] God let you go through the highs and
[1:52:03] lows of life you are already going to
[1:52:06] make it praise God
[1:52:09] Amen but there will be days you'll feel
[1:52:11] like you're getting slaughtered all day
[1:52:15] long mistreated just for being a
[1:52:18] Christian right
[1:52:20] some of these persecuted distressed oh
[1:52:23] how's this going to work out and you're
[1:52:25] you're going through it all day long
[1:52:26] that doesn't separate you from God's
[1:52:28] love it just means God's love is on the
[1:52:31] way Hallelujah church I know it's going
[1:52:34] long here but we had to get some good
[1:52:36] worship so I I don't try I'm not going
[1:52:38] to try to push it longer it needs to go
[1:52:39] I just want to finish this chapter
[1:52:41] actually this if I should this chapter
[1:52:44] says we're more than conquerors and who
[1:52:47] can be against us am yet we're she sheep
[1:52:50] that are got to go through
[1:52:52] slaughtering
[1:52:54] suffering so what does this do this
[1:52:56] magnifies the glory of
[1:52:58] God this magnifies the great
[1:53:01] Shepherd there's sheep all around I'm
[1:53:03] sorry there's wolves all around the
[1:53:05] Sheep sometimes but I'm still with you
[1:53:08] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:53:11] amen I'll just say like this you know

[1:54:29] certain wolves to come around just like

[1:55:15] sheep
[1:55:18] Hallelujah now before I get there you
[1:55:21] remember the Divine Socrates remember

[1:55:28] Where's
[1:55:29] God I'm a righteous man why am I going
[1:55:32] through this and it's true job thought
[1:55:35] he was more righteous than God see look
[1:55:38] how prideful people can
[1:55:40] get and remember we talked about the
[1:55:42] goat debate I told my wife about this
[1:55:43] I'm GNA have more Mercy on these goat
[1:55:45] debate
[1:55:46] people because what did job do job made
[1:55:49] himself more righteous than God talk
[1:55:51] about the goat
[1:55:55] debate I mean God's got to be the
[1:55:57] greatest of all time the church
[1:56:00] said now y'all thinking those good
[1:56:04] questions job said sister beus I'm more
[1:56:07] righteous than God I don't deserve
[1:56:10] this how did God
[1:56:13] answer anybody remember Job
[1:56:18] 38
[1:56:20] the Lord
[1:56:21] descended out of a
[1:56:23] whirlwind you ever triy to catch your
[1:56:26] Whirlwind we had went out in our field
[1:56:28] last fall I almost ran out I thought is
[1:56:30] this God talking to me like brother
[1:56:31] brandom I was like maybe this is a
[1:56:32] spiritual
[1:56:34] moment I just watch see I'm like Lord
[1:56:36] are you gonna talk to me I think Z might
[1:56:37] have been out
[1:56:39] there but this was probably a mighty
[1:56:41] Whirlwind here J's like I want to talk
[1:56:43] to God I want to hear from God a li
[1:56:45] who's like you are going to hear from
[1:56:47] God you ain't going to like what you
[1:56:48] hear
[1:56:50] now in one way he didn't like it in
[1:56:51] another way he liked it right the flesh
[1:56:54] don't never like correction or doesn't
[1:56:56] never like correction but then the soul
[1:56:58] loves
[1:57:02] correction you remember church God comes
[1:57:05] down he he doesn't tell job anything
[1:57:07] about his trials he just
[1:57:09] said who is this he don't even call him
[1:57:13] a
[1:57:14] son he said who is
[1:57:16] this that darkens counsel by words
[1:57:20] without
[1:57:21] knowledge who is this who's making me
[1:57:24] look like I don't know what I'm talking
[1:57:27] about he didn't come down and say oh
[1:57:30] little baby job can I can I comfort you
[1:57:35] a little bit
[1:57:37] baby Hallelujah he says who is
[1:57:42] this that makes my word seem like it
[1:57:44] doesn't it's not
[1:57:46] true who's this that's speaking things
[1:57:49] things that are
[1:57:50] false sound like Socrates to you yeah
[1:57:53] the first
[1:57:55] Socrates and church he asked him 65 more
[1:58:00] questions and he never
[1:58:02] answered his question job's question was
[1:58:05] how can I uh how how can I suffer
[1:58:08] through this when I'm living a righteous
[1:58:09] life I feed the poor I help the Widow
[1:58:11] I'm true to my wife I don't look at any
[1:58:13] other Maids think about that Brothers I
[1:58:16] made a covenant I will not look at
[1:58:18] another woman think about that and he
[1:58:20] said I did it it's a righteous man I
[1:58:23] gave to the poor I fasted I receed
[1:58:27] people in and taught them
[1:58:29] everything he said where is God God said
[1:58:33] who is
[1:58:35] this now in heaven he's like you
[1:58:37] consider job devil this you consider my
[1:58:40] servant job I'm proud of this is my boy
[1:58:42] right
[1:58:43] here in fact there's nobody even like
[1:58:46] him on the
[1:58:47] earth so when God's up in heaven he's
[1:58:50] like this is the greatest man in the
[1:58:51] world he comes out and says who's
[1:58:53] this and job listen job's
[1:58:56] listen you don't know
[1:58:58] me right you don't know who I am I've
[1:59:01] served you all these years I've done all
[1:59:02] these good works uh job you got a little
[1:59:05] pride there shouldn't say little you got
[1:59:07] a lot of
[1:59:09] Pride he doesn't answer his questions he
[1:59:11] gives him more
[1:59:13] questions who are you to darken my
[1:59:16] counsel and you don't even know what
[1:59:18] you're talking about you don't have the
[1:59:21] knowledge where were you when I laid the
[1:59:24] foundation of the earth so that proves
[1:59:26] he wasn't one of those sons of God
[1:59:27] shouting for Joy that's speaking of
[1:59:28] angels because why would God ask him
[1:59:30] where were you if then he tells him you
[1:59:32] were right
[1:59:33] there those were Angels shouting those
[1:59:35] weren't human there's no pre-existence
[1:59:37] of souls butam tells us
[1:59:41] right tell me if you have understanding
[1:59:44] who set the measurements did you measure
[1:59:47] did you set the measure did you write
[1:59:48] the blueprints for the Earth
[1:59:50] since you know who stretched out the
[1:59:51] line upon
[1:59:53] it on what were its bases sunk I'm using
[1:59:56] a different Bible version just because
[1:59:58] it's a little bit easier for us to
[1:59:59] understand I don't I I disagree with all
[2:00:01] Bible versions you understand but I'm
[2:00:02] trying to put it in the language we'll
[2:00:03] understand it who laid the Cornerstone
[2:00:06] of the earth when all the morning Stars
[2:00:08] sang together and all the sons of God
[2:00:09] shouted for Joy who enclosed the sea
[2:00:11] with doors when bursting forth it went
[2:00:14] out from the womb did you know the the
[2:00:16] sea came out of a womb did you know that
[2:00:18] the sea had a anybody know that job
[2:00:21] didn't know that I didn't know
[2:00:23] that when I made a cloud it's
[2:00:26] garment the cloud was a garment for the
[2:00:30] sea the cloud was clothed for the sea
[2:00:33] did you know the cloud was a garment I
[2:00:35] didn't know
[2:00:36] that and the thick Darkness it's
[2:00:39] swaddling band a swaddling
[2:00:41] cloth so the the sea was like a little
[2:00:44] baby that had swaddling cloth on it
[2:00:47] that's how God looks at the sea
[2:00:49] Hallelujah I placed my boundaries on it
[2:00:52] and set a bolt in doors and I said thus
[2:00:54] far you shall come but no further and
[2:00:56] here shall your proud wav stop have you
[2:01:00] ever in your life commanded the morning
[2:01:02] see God calls the morning every and he
[2:01:04] says I give you mercies new mercies
[2:01:05] every morning amen that's the reason God
[2:01:08] sends a morning so you can have hope
[2:01:10] every morning hallelujah amen I command
[2:01:13] the morning job did you ever stop the
[2:01:15] morning from
[2:01:16] happening God could have said job are
[2:01:18] you ever said uh stand stand still to
[2:01:20] the sun and it stood
[2:01:22] still Joshua could say Amen now Joshua
[2:01:25] came later joshu said I could do that
[2:01:27] but by the spirit of
[2:01:28] Christ because I was such a faithful
[2:01:30] servant and I needed that to deliver the
[2:01:33] gibon nightes the Gentiles oh that's a
[2:01:36] that's a sermon right there Hallelujah I
[2:01:38] preached it before but that's a fresh
[2:01:39] thought Hallelujah the
[2:01:42] Gentiles son stand
[2:01:45] still but God asked job where were you
[2:01:49] did you command the morning did you know
[2:01:52] did you cause the dawn to know where to
[2:01:53] go its place that it might take hold of
[2:01:57] ends of the Earth and the wicked be
[2:01:58] shaken of it have you entered into the
[2:02:00] Springs of the sea or walked in the
[2:02:02] recesses of the deep like remember that
[2:02:04] video I showed you about the ocean
[2:02:05] anybody ever been down to the bottom of
[2:02:06] the ocean God asked job now they weren't
[2:02:09] even getting close in job's day they
[2:02:11] weren't getting 10 meters not even close
[2:02:15] he said you ever been down to the
[2:02:17] bottom no no God I haven't
[2:02:20] oh oh okay so who are you to speak
[2:02:23] against me and yet in heaven he's like
[2:02:26] this is my boy no one's like this guy
[2:02:29] look at
[2:02:30] him I love the word of God don't you
[2:02:32] church it's good to revisit these I
[2:02:34] Prett this a few years ago but it had a
[2:02:35] fresh application to me because that's
[2:02:37] the same way Paul ends his chapter who
[2:02:39] is going to separate you from the love
[2:02:41] of God
[2:02:44] who right so we get good questions
[2:02:46] rather than questions of
[2:02:47] rebuke right God's rebuking job so we
[2:02:51] could learn the lesson and then we would
[2:02:54] really meditate on that's right nothing
[2:02:56] can separate me from God's love that's
[2:02:59] right nobody can condemn me because
[2:03:03] Jesus already paid my
[2:03:04] condemnation he already took my
[2:03:11] condemnation now for time sake I'm not
[2:03:13] going to go through this list of 66 but
[2:03:15] I could maybe someday I will
[2:03:20] he goes to the Behemoth right the
[2:03:21] brosaurus or the Brachiosaurus or
[2:03:22] gigantosaurus whichever one was the
[2:03:24] biggest one I don't know anymore they're
[2:03:26] find they always find new kinds of
[2:03:27] dinosaur
[2:03:28] bones and he says Can you capture
[2:03:31] him can you put barbs and Pierce his
[2:03:34] nose and just drag him around wherever
[2:03:36] you
[2:03:36] want no God I haven't done that
[2:03:39] yet
[2:03:41] okay all
[2:03:43] right can you draw out the Leviathan The
[2:03:45] Sea Dragon which they're used to they
[2:03:47] used to be alive I don't know if they're
[2:03:48] still alive today but there used to be a
[2:03:51] a sea
[2:03:54] dragon will he make many supplications
[2:03:57] to you or will he speak to you soft
[2:03:59] words the kids were at the zoo the other
[2:04:01] day will will a lion or bear or tiger
[2:04:03] speak soft words to you can you get him
[2:04:04] to whisper
[2:04:06] and can I have a
[2:04:09] hug will they make a covenant with
[2:04:14] you
[2:04:17] bye and then he ends with those last two
[2:04:20] animals the Behemoth and the leviathon
[2:04:22] and then the Lord leaves Lord
[2:04:26] leaves who remembers what job did once
[2:04:29] God
[2:04:30] left job 42 verse1 then job answered the
[2:04:35] Lord and said I know that thou C do
[2:04:37] everything so job must have forgot that
[2:04:40] God does
[2:04:41] everything right because he was like I
[2:04:43] I'm more I'm more righteous than
[2:04:45] God but now he realizes no God can can
[2:04:48] do everything I can't do very
[2:04:51] much I can help out the poor I can keep
[2:04:53] my mind
[2:04:55] right right I can visit I can visit the
[2:04:58] fatherless I can visit the
[2:05:01] children but I can't do
[2:05:04] everything and I know that thou cast do
[2:05:07] everything and that no thought can be
[2:05:08] withholden from thee who is he that
[2:05:10] hideth counsel without
[2:05:12] knowledge therefore have I uttered that
[2:05:15] I understood
[2:05:17] not things to wonderful for me which I
[2:05:20] knew
[2:05:20] not I have heard of thee by the seeing
[2:05:23] of the ear but now mine eye seeth
[2:05:25] wherefore I have myself and repent
[2:05:28] in dust and
[2:05:30] Ashes so God's questions bring him to
[2:05:33] the realization I don't know
[2:05:35] everything but I can trust him who knows
[2:05:40] everything and I hate my
[2:05:43] flesh I hate the sinful desire the
[2:05:46] sinful nature that's in my flesh that
[2:05:48] makes me exalt myself I don't want to
[2:05:51] exalt myself so I Repent in dust and
[2:05:53] dust and Ashes and then God comes around
[2:05:55] to the three men and says you better
[2:05:57] have my Prophet pray for you that's the
[2:05:59] only way you're going to be
[2:06:01] forgiven and he does and God forgives
[2:06:05] them so he said who is he right to job
[2:06:09] and then later he says you're my servant
[2:06:11] amen hallelujah I like that
[2:06:13] amen God knows just how to Humble us and
[2:06:16] then God knows how to come around and
[2:06:18] remind us that we are his servants
[2:06:20] hallelujah amen hallelujah sometimes God
[2:06:23] makes it seem like he don't know us who
[2:06:25] is this to keep us
[2:06:28] humble but the whole time God knew job
[2:06:32] but he knows the words to speak to us
[2:06:34] when we need a a good
[2:06:35] humbling
[2:06:39] Hallelujah and God waited till job
[2:06:42] prayed for those three men in order for
[2:06:45] God to turn them from his wrath the
[2:06:47] Bible says that in verse
[2:06:49] 4210 God still had that much there's
[2:06:52] still much that that I'm sorry that's
[2:06:53] how much power there is in a believer's
[2:06:56] prayer that's why Church keep praying
[2:06:58] for your lost L lost loved ones God will
[2:07:01] remember your prayers Abraham and Sarah
[2:07:05] Hallelujah God remember your
[2:07:07] prayers because God would not forgive
[2:07:10] the three miserable counselors until job
[2:07:13] prayed for
[2:07:16] them Hallelujah
[2:07:19] no in all these things we are more than
[2:07:22] conquerors through him that loved us
[2:07:24] what you're more than a conquer through
[2:07:27] all your tribulations how many have ever

[2:07:35] distress oh you conquered that
[2:07:38] Hallelujah you mean God's word is

[2:08:31] conqueror his love allows you to be

[2:08:36] then you're more than a conqueror you're
[2:08:38] more than that you're more than a

[2:08:54] that you're more than we'd say just a
[2:08:57] soldier in the army of the
[2:09:00] Lord and now look even Paul was
[2:09:02] persuaded that's what I want you to be

[2:10:55] creature so see he names he names Angels
[2:10:59] Powers any any power and any other
[2:11:01] creature beyond that if there's any
[2:11:04] other creature beyond the Angels than
[2:11:06] the demons and Satan himself I love that
[2:11:09] anything else if there's any ever
[2:11:11] anything else out there the the 17th and
[2:11:14] final expression was anything else
[2:11:17] nothing can separate us from the love of
[2:11:19] God that's in Christ Jesus
[2:11:21] amen God loves
[2:11:27] you no other creature shall be able to
[2:11:31] separate us from the love of God which
[2:11:33] is in Christ Jesus our
[2:11:36] lord where is God's love it's in Christ
[2:11:39] and where's Christ a portion of him is
[2:11:41] in you Hallelujah right I love this I
[2:11:45] heard a preacher say
[2:11:47] this so we made it through all 17 tests
[2:11:49] that we can go through and the Bible
[2:11:51] says God's love cannot be separated from
[2:11:54] you I love I love this chapter it says
[2:11:57] it starts with no condemnation and it
[2:11:59] ends with no
[2:12:01] separation I like that nobody can
[2:12:03] condemn me and nobody can take me away
[2:12:05] from Jesus Hallelujah I'm forever yours
[2:12:10] Hallelujah I belong to Jesus I am bought
[2:12:13] with a prize the precious blood of Jesus
[2:12:16] hallelujah amen he bought me I'm his
[2:12:20] he's mine oh I am my beloved and he is
[2:12:24] mine trur we believe that do you believe
[2:12:27] that when you sing that that's what the
[2:12:29] Bible said he's yours and nothing will
[2:12:32] be able to separate you from the love of
[2:12:36] God like brother said it makes me want
[2:12:38] to go go in the the corner and cry and
[2:12:40] just Rejoice over all that he's done for
[2:12:42] us just he says uh curl up in a corner
[2:12:45] and cry and
[2:12:47] rejoice God loves me that much
[2:12:50] Hallelujah of course he
[2:12:55] does now I'm gonna 17 was the number of
[2:12:59] the the the New Testament Church I'm not
[2:13:00] I'm gonna skip
[2:13:02] that I'm just going to go through a few
[2:13:04] brief quotes I'm not going to read all
[2:13:05] this but brother man quotes Ephesians
[2:13:07] 4:30 he talks about the Seal of the Holy
[2:13:09] Ghost it's a permanent Mark it's like a
[2:13:11] tattoo or a a brand on your
[2:13:14] soul he said how long does it last the
[2:13:17] next Revival
[2:13:19] until our Redemption the very day of
[2:13:20] redemption there's no way of getting
[2:13:23] away from aren't you glad that God put
[2:13:25] something on you that's him and you
[2:13:27] can't get away from it yes amen anybody
[2:13:30] got a good scar where's my latest scar I
[2:13:33] can't see it maybe if I got a scar here
[2:13:35] I had surgery I'll never get away from
[2:13:37] that scar never I'm always gonna have
[2:13:41] that Hallelujah my children asked me one
[2:13:42] time what is that Daddy that's your
[2:13:44] daddy playing foolish football but
[2:13:46] there's a purpose for it Hallelujah to
[2:13:47] get here here hallelujah I'll never get
[2:13:49] away from that so it is with the Seal of
[2:13:52] God you'll never get away from
[2:13:54] it
[2:13:56] Hallelujah he said you can't get away
[2:13:59] from it because it won't get away from
[2:14:03] you you can't get away from the Holy
[2:14:05] Ghost because the Holy Ghost won't leave
[2:14:06] you you can try to run all you want but
[2:14:10] it will not get away from you he's with
[2:14:12] you forever he sealed you Hallelujah
[2:14:14] he's with you for all eternity
[2:14:16] Hallelujah
[2:14:19] and then he quotes Romans 8 there's
[2:14:20] nothing future present perils hunger
[2:14:22] thirst nothing can separate us from the
[2:14:24] love of God Paul said I'm fully
[2:14:26] persuaded of that there you
[2:14:28] are there you are you're sealed until
[2:14:31] the day of your
[2:14:33] Redemption God will never get away from
[2:14:35] you he will not leave you he will not
[2:14:38] forsake
[2:14:41] you and I love this quote again I'm not
[2:14:43] gonna I'm going to put some of these up
[2:14:44] on YouTube this
[2:14:46] week the reason
[2:14:48] the reason you can't be separated from
[2:14:50] the love of God is because God's love is
[2:14:52] undying it's
[2:14:53] Eternal and he put an Undying Love in
[2:14:56] you well that's why it can never be
[2:14:57] separated it cannot
[2:15:01] die so brother I'm talking about being
[2:15:04] circumcised the soul you're getting the
[2:15:05] unbelief cut out he says the Holy Ghost
[2:15:09] is he said you have nothing to do with
[2:15:10] it it does it itself God does it itself
[2:15:13] he circumcises your soul and puts you in
[2:15:15] love with Jesus with an Undying Love
[2:15:20] there's nothing can separate you from
[2:15:21] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[2:15:24] he quotes Romans
[2:15:26] 8 he's called you he circumcised you you
[2:15:30] and him and predestinate your final
[2:15:32] destination if that ought to make
[2:15:34] Christians
[2:15:35] shout that's what you were shouting
[2:15:37] about before service I'm sorry before
[2:15:39] the preaching that's why you were
[2:15:42] shouting Hallelujah there's joy in the
[2:15:44] house of the
[2:15:44] Lord isn't it joy unspeakable full of
[2:15:47] Glory
[2:15:48] you can say Amen to that because you've
[2:15:50] already fulfilled it
[2:15:51] today I was already shouting you are
[2:15:54] already shouting it's God's love amen if
[2:15:57] that don't make you shout I don't know
[2:15:58] what will if that wouldn't wake up a man
[2:16:01] that's in Christ I don't know what would
[2:16:02] it take to wake him up he's twice dead
[2:16:05] he goes to the Judas see it what does it
[2:16:08] do it wakes us up when we learn about
[2:16:09] the love of God when the re when the
[2:16:12] questions of God are given to us and we
[2:16:14] rehearse God's love and we examine
[2:16:17] ourselves and we learn and remember the
[2:16:19] promises of God it makes us shout the
[2:16:21] victory hallelujah amen why he put the
[2:16:24] love of God in you that's what he shed
[2:16:27] in you that's what he poured into you
[2:16:29] the love of God the Bible says that's
[2:16:32] why I know I got the holy ghost that
[2:16:33] that morning after I got married because
[2:16:35] I never felt loved like that
[2:16:39] before brother brandom said
[2:16:42] Church Romans 8 takes the wind out of
[2:16:46] Satan's sails you ever feel like
[2:16:47] somebody's chasing you down like the
[2:16:49] devil's chasing you down when is he
[2:16:51] going to quit when is he going to give
[2:16:52] up why I got to keep looking over my
[2:16:54] shoulder brother Ram said just give him
[2:16:55] Romans
[2:16:56] 8 then pretty soon all that wind's going
[2:16:59] to leave him and you'll be sailing just
[2:17:01] you and Jesus Fellowship two fellows in
[2:17:04] one
[2:17:04] ship Hallelujah brother we can have some
[2:17:07] fellowship San's not going to try to
[2:17:08] hinder our fellowship
[2:17:10] right he said Romans 8 takes all the
[2:17:13] winds out of Satan say let's leave Satan
[2:17:18] deserted today can we yes let's make
[2:17:21] Satan stranded today let's believe
[2:17:23] nothing can separate us from God's love
[2:17:25] hallelujah amen we don't feel like I'm
[2:17:28] being chased down by the these lies and
[2:17:30] the
[2:17:33] guilt the greatest thing I can find
[2:17:35] against the church tonight is fear but
[2:17:37] remember now remember Church let's pause
[2:17:38] right here there's no condemnation to
[2:17:40] the
[2:17:41] church so this must mean in your own
[2:17:43] personal battles on Earth not in heaven
[2:17:45] God don't have nothing against the bride
[2:17:46] in heaven but he's teaching us he's
[2:17:48] training us on the earth is fear
[2:17:51] Everybody's scared to death about
[2:17:53] something what are you scared about if a
[2:17:55] man's born again he should be happy
[2:17:56] Carefree just like these fellows singing
[2:17:57] up there and the brother testifying back
[2:17:59] there there ain't nothing can harm
[2:18:01] you nothing present nothing future
[2:18:04] nothing can separate us from the love of
[2:18:05] God God has promised he's called by
[2:18:08] election he sets the church in order no
[2:18:10] man can come to me except my God the
[2:18:12] Father draws him you never come to God
[2:18:15] because you wanted to so now we're
[2:18:17] getting into the we're going that's
[2:18:18] actually the next
[2:18:20] chapter God the so in one way we choose
[2:18:22] God but another way the Bible said God
[2:18:24] made you a vessel I just use this one
[2:18:27] again God this is a special vessel right
[2:18:29] it's a glass vessel it's not this isn't
[2:18:31] one of these paper cups children right
[2:18:33] you get those paper
[2:18:34] cups we just toss them in the trash
[2:18:37] right would you toss this in the trash
[2:18:39] no it's a special vessel let's use it
[2:18:41] it's made for a special purpose it's
[2:18:43] made to last a long time see there's
[2:18:45] some vessels and virt had a good
[2:18:46] question about that there's some vessels
[2:18:48] they're just made to be used and thrown
[2:18:49] away but some vessels have a a longer
[2:18:52] lasting quality to them God's got a
[2:18:55] special purpose for you sister
[2:18:58] beatric hallelujah sister Kristen God
[2:19:01] has a special purpose for you Don I
[2:19:03] hardly ever use my wife you know she's
[2:19:06] out usually out with the kids see God
[2:19:08] made sister Christen a special vessel to
[2:19:10] hold the oil the Holy Spirit
[2:19:15] Hallelujah you come because Christ
[2:19:17] called called you God called you and he
[2:19:19] that comes to me in no wise will I cast
[2:19:21] out I'll never cast you
[2:19:24] out I'll give him everlasting life oh my
[2:19:27] if that doesn't take the winds out of
[2:19:29] Satan's sails I don't know what
[2:19:31] does if Romans 8 don't make you feel
[2:19:34] like you're sailing on life solom man
[2:19:36] and just rejoicing and with joy he said
[2:19:39] I don't I don't know what
[2:19:41] will this is the chapter that takes all
[2:19:45] the guilt
[2:19:46] away makes you ask all the right
[2:19:48] questions and helps you find all the
[2:19:51] right answers hallelujah amen hallelujah
[2:19:54] takes all the winds out of Satan's sails
[2:19:57] no longer feel like you're afraid no
[2:19:58] longer feel like the enemy's after you
[2:20:01] how do you know brother Ram because
[2:20:03] Jesus said so and Jesus is thus sayeth
[2:20:05] the
[2:20:11] Lord Brother said oh don't you love him
[2:20:13] today Jesus has the key to your joy we
[2:20:15] just saying joy in the house of the Lord
[2:20:16] right and then we say joy
[2:20:18] unspeakable Jesus give us the key we can
[2:20:20] have joy in church amen and church I'm
[2:20:22] not saying we have to dance after church
[2:20:24] I'm just saying I love how God does
[2:20:25] spontaneous things I'm just saying the
[2:20:27] reason you could dance or Rejoice today
[2:20:29] is because God gave you the key for it
[2:20:31] amen right thank
[2:20:35] God he's the key to your happiness he
[2:20:38] has the key of your deliverance from the
[2:20:40] grave I have the keys of death and
[2:20:43] hell he said why don't you come to the
[2:20:45] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[2:20:47] emanuel's veins and when you come back
[2:20:49] up from that Fountain brother you won't
[2:20:51] have to take a rabbi a priest or even
[2:20:53] brother Jesse's word in your heart
[2:20:55] there's something that's mellowed you to
[2:20:57] a fellowship ship ship Satan sails no
[2:21:01] long his ship is no longer chasing you
[2:21:04] because you're relaxed now there's

[2:21:33] of God no back bitings no ups and downs
[2:21:35] nothing else nothing can ever separate
[2:21:37] us from the love of God that's in Christ
[2:21:39] Jesus sickness sorrow hunger strive
[2:21:41] differences in the church right
[2:21:44] differences of opinion no matter matter

[2:21:54] last one yep that's the last one you can
[2:21:57] say thank the Lord
[2:22:00] hallelujah brother says when I look at
[2:22:02] Jesus saving me from hell and eternal
[2:22:05] Eternal judgment the Bible says not
[2:22:07] Eternal suffering Eternal
[2:22:09] judgment how can I not love him when I
[2:22:12] look at the cross how can I not love him
[2:22:15] back how can I not know that the I'll
[2:22:18] never be separated from the love of God
[2:22:19] in Christ
[2:22:22] Jesus I'm not going to read all this
[2:22:23] here he talks about brother says when I
[2:22:26] go overseas he said my wife and I we sit
[2:22:28] down and pray together may God bless you
[2:22:29] here in Jeffersonville may God bless me
[2:22:31] on my trip like you heard brother say
[2:22:33] that we don't look at each other and say
[2:22:34] well if you look you know M if you look
[2:22:37] at any other man in the eyes you'll be a
[2:22:38] divorced woman when you get back and she
[2:22:40] said let me tell you my good man if you
[2:22:42] have any other looking at any other
[2:22:44] girls you'll be a divorced husband when
[2:22:45] you come back he said wouldn't that be a
[2:22:46] happy home
[2:22:49] that's what he tells in the
[2:22:52] story he said goodbye sweetheart pray
[2:22:54] for me he said even though I might be
[2:22:57] tempted he said she never has to worry
[2:22:59] that I'll love somebody else I love her
[2:23:02] too much to cheat on in other
[2:23:06] words there's something in my heart that
[2:23:09] wouldn't let me do
[2:23:12] it and so he uses the natural how could
[2:23:14] I ever cheat on my wife I love her so
[2:23:15] much when I look at at my Lord and see
[2:23:18] he died Yonder on
[2:23:20] Calvary the lovely for me the
[2:23:24] unlovely he the pure now pure lovely me
[2:23:29] impure unlovely see that we have to see
[2:23:32] the contrast who's the lovely one here

[2:23:38] No One Like Jesus Children I like when
[2:23:39] Lily points up there she goes there's no
[2:23:42] one there's no
[2:23:44] one she's laughing
[2:23:48] There's No One Like
[2:23:49] Jesus how do I know God loves me because
[2:23:52] of the cross the
[2:23:54] resurrection when I look at him and he
[2:23:58] saved me from the death of sin and The
[2:24:00] Eternity in hell now look here's a good
[2:24:02] quote I need to take this to uh
[2:24:04] Jeffersonville is this thus sayith the
[2:24:06] Lord I thought there was no eternal
[2:24:10] hell everybody catch
[2:24:12] that ever everybody got your discernment
[2:24:15] on there's something in me
[2:24:17] if I could get by with it I don't want
[2:24:19] to do it look at that if I knew I could
[2:24:22] do a sin and get by with it I still
[2:24:24] wouldn't want to do it because I love
[2:24:26] him yes sir I love him even I even I
[2:24:29] thought if I'd go do it he'd forgive me
[2:24:31] for it I don't want to do it anyhow I
[2:24:33] don't want to do nothing to hurt him I
[2:24:34] love him too much that's what we have to
[2:24:37] have it's something in your heart
[2:24:40] love they say oh don't con condemn me to
[2:24:43] smoke it don't condemn me to
[2:24:45] drink brother br said the first Bible
[2:24:47] ever got when I started preaching they'd
[2:24:50] say brother Braham you think it's wrong
[2:24:51] to smoke you think it's wrong to drink
[2:24:53] he said I wrote an ant little answer my
[2:24:55] Bible so after church I'm going to start
[2:24:57] looking through your Bibles that you
[2:24:58] leave there what do they write when they
[2:25:00] go through trials what do you write down
[2:25:01] in your
[2:25:03] Bible I wrote a little answer in my
[2:25:05] Bible to these
[2:25:07] questions don't ask me foolish questions
[2:25:10] make this up in your mind if you love
[2:25:12] the Lord with all your heart you won't
[2:25:14] smoke chew or drink any shine
[2:25:18] sometimes brother was a poem wasn't he
[2:25:20] wrote remember he wrote about the wild
[2:25:21] west that was a beautiful poem remember
[2:25:24] that brother
[2:25:27] Jose that still holds good tonight if
[2:25:31] you love him though you could do it and
[2:25:32] get by with it you wouldn't do it anyhow
[2:25:34] if you love him that's the real true
[2:25:36] genuine agapo love does the Christian
[2:25:39] loves the Lord and he loves him in such
[2:25:41] a way that there's nothing can separate
[2:25:43] us from the love of God which is in
[2:25:45] Christ Jesus Paul said neither death
[2:25:48] sorrow perils imprisonments anything can
[2:25:50] separate us from the love of God that's
[2:25:53] in Christ
[2:25:55] Jesus and brother when you get that in
[2:25:57] your heart with that type of Love
[2:25:58] that'll be anything else that you could
[2:26:01] ever substitute
[2:26:03] for let's stand to our feet musicians
[2:26:05] can come
[2:26:12] here you know I think it's very fitting
[2:26:14] we had a nice time of worship and God
[2:26:16] wanted me to preach on the love of
[2:26:18] God hallelujah let's bow our heads for a
[2:26:22] word of
[2:26:30] prayer I don't know if there would be
[2:26:32] but there if there would be anyone that
[2:26:34] would say brother Jesse remembering me
[2:26:35] in prayer that I'll remember how much
[2:26:37] God loves me you could raise your hand
[2:26:38] and God would see the raising of your
[2:26:40] hand or if there would be anyone that
[2:26:41] say brother Jesse pray for me I'm going
[2:26:43] through perils right now I'm going
[2:26:45] through persecution
[2:26:47] and I need to remember the love of
[2:26:49] Christ you can acknowledge that by the
[2:26:51] raising of your hand of course anyone's
[2:26:52] welcome to come up for prayer as we uh
[2:26:55] let's be close
[2:26:57] here you know brother Bram calls us the
[2:26:59] climax of the service now that you've
[2:27:01] heard the word what are you going to do
[2:27:03] about it will you accept it how many
[2:27:04] will accept it in your heart let's pray
[2:27:07] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[2:27:08] love Lord as I've said this before now
[2:27:10] it just comes to my mind your Prophet
[2:27:13] brother Ram said the church age book
[2:27:15] God's love is not in
[2:27:17] question it's our love that's in
[2:27:22] question God proved his love to us when
[2:27:24] he sent his son the righteous for the
[2:27:26] unrighteous the pure for the unpure the
