[37:07] chapter 5 here and then we'll read our
[37:14] memory verse from our sister Karen so we
[37:16] thank the Lord for that judges 5:7 I
[37:19] like to preach on Deborah this morning
[37:22] Deborah the rising of a mother let's
[37:24] preach on that this morning by God's
[37:26] grace and then we will look to our
[37:29] memory verses well judges 5 7
[37:46] judges five seven I'll read this myself
[37:50] and then we'll read our memory verse
[37:51] together
[37:52] praise God judges 5 verse 7 the
[37:59] inhabitants of the villages ceased they
[38:03] ceased in Israel until that I arose I
[38:06] Deborah arose that I arose a mother in
[38:11] Israel let's go to Isaiah chapter 12
[38:16] verse 2
[38:26] Isaiah 12 verse 2
[38:39] as he had 12 verse to read verses 2 to 5
[38:43] let's read this together on three one
[38:46] two three behold god is my salvation i
[38:51] will trust and not be afraid for the
[38:54] lord jehovah is my strength and my song
[38:58] he also is become my salvation therefore
[39:02] with joy shall ye draw water out of the
[39:06] wells of salvation and in that day shall
[39:09] ye say praise the lord call upon his
[39:13] name declare his doings among the people
[39:17] make mention that his name is exalted
[39:20] sing unto the Lord for he hath done
[39:23] excellent things this is known in all
[39:26] the earth and the Saints said Amen god
[39:29] bless you bein seated to praise the Lord
[39:45] so again we're thankful again for all
[39:48] the mothers Lord bless you we thought
[39:49] we'd do a little bit extra decorating
[39:50] today you know it never did that before
[39:52] if some yesterday I'm just like well I
[39:54] don't know when I go buy some
[39:55] decorations for the moms so we're very
[39:58] thankful for the moms and all of our
[40:00] sisters and the mothers to be we believe
[40:03] and who knows which one these little
[40:04] ones are raised up and be mothers and we
[40:06] always want them to know that it's an
[40:08] honorable godly thing to be a real godly
[40:11] mother and we thank God for that for the
[40:13] random calls her the fifth gospel we're
[40:15] familiar with that she's the one that
[40:17] gets them first she gets to put that
[40:20] first eternal imprint on their character
[40:22] praise God and before the teachers get
[40:25] them but even before dad gets him you
[40:28] know as according to the you know Old
[40:30] Testament Hebrew you know patterns of
[40:33] life and the raising of the children you
[40:35] know the tutoring and so forth and then
[40:37] the adoptions according to you know to
[40:39] Galatians three and four speaks of that
[40:42] but we're so thankful for our mothers
[40:44] and may the Lord bless ya this you know
[40:46] I thought studying yesterday I just kind
[40:49] of felt led to look at Deborah so Lord
[40:51] willing we'll look at her life today I
[40:52] don't think I've ever preached on
[40:53] Deborah as far as like a whole sermons
[40:56] this be my first one by God's grace I
[40:58] preached on Leah a couple years ago that
[41:00] was a real blessing and looking forward
[41:03] to this thought here I got numerous
[41:07] notes you know just as they come I try
[41:09] to write them down as quick as possible
[41:11] and look to the Lord here so Deborah the
[41:16] rising of a mother she was a godly woman
[41:20] who really rose up at a time when the
[41:23] people needed a mother and will look to
[41:26] that here we'll we'll just start with
[41:27] the quotes of brother Branham and maybe
[41:29] some background on Deborah and then
[41:31] we'll go what an Lord willing with the
[41:33] scriptures all about her life there's
[41:35] not a whole lot but it's in chapters 4
[41:38] and 5 of Judges such a godly woman but
[41:43] you remember here Deborah was about
[41:46] twelve hundred years before Christ about
[41:48] 200 years before David right after the
[41:51] generation of Joshua had died off
[41:54] and remember let's go to judges chapter
[41:56] one though let's read a little bit from
[41:58] here so you can kind of you know
[42:01] rehearse some of these conditions to see
[42:04] the hour that that she was living in as
[42:09] you're turning to judges one I kind of
[42:12] referenced these scriptures a few months
[42:13] ago as we were looking at brother
[42:15] Branham as a prophet and and some of the
[42:18] disagreements people have with him and a
[42:20] lot of the misunderstandings they have
[42:21] with brother Branham how how someone can
[42:26] be given thus saith the Lord and it's
[42:30] it's it's a direction from God it's a
[42:33] it's a command of God but if they
[42:35] disobey it then they miss out on God's
[42:37] blessings and that would be different as
[42:39] far as you know that kind of dust saith
[42:43] the Lord will be different from
[42:44] something where it's absolutely going to
[42:47] come to pass and so that that deals in
[42:50] with the thought as the Lord has been
[42:52] dealing with me lately with the will of
[42:55] God there are some things with the will
[42:57] of God that are absolutely going to
[42:59] happen because God has decreed it in his
[43:02] will and then there's other parts of the
[43:05] word of will of God that are we say
[43:07] unknown right there's like a known will
[43:10] of God that we know this is absolutely
[43:12] going to happen like the Millenium like
[43:14] the rapture praise God like the future
[43:17] home that's absolutely the will of God
[43:19] it's it's known it's going to happen but
[43:22] there are other things that are unknown
[43:23] that are left up to man's choice in
[43:27] other words man cannot stop the rapture
[43:30] praise God amen
[43:32] evil men cannot stop the rapture praise
[43:35] God evil men cannot stop Israel
[43:37] returning to her homeland praise God or
[43:40] the millennium the millennial reign of
[43:43] Jesus Christ he will reign with a rod of
[43:46] iron over every nation and righteousness
[43:49] will be declared from sea to shining sea
[43:51] praise God the whole world will be ruled
[43:54] by Jesus the son of David there's
[43:57] nothing they can do it's the known will
[43:58] of God there's nothing that can be done
[44:00] with that praise God but there are
[44:03] promises given to individuals that are
[44:06] with the unknown
[44:08] will of God as far as men has a choice
[44:10] in it a man every man remember the Bible
[44:13] said it's God's will that all men will
[44:15] be saved right but not all men will be
[44:17] saved we know that we know Jesus said
[44:20] few there be that find it so there's a
[44:22] will of God that's immutable
[44:24] unchangeable it will no one can stop it
[44:27] but then there's a will of God that God
[44:29] leaves up to mankind and man has the
[44:32] choice whether he can accept God's will
[44:34] or turn down God's will in fact remember
[44:37] you remember from Matthew 7 on the
[44:39] Sermon on the Mount where Jesus said
[44:42] many will come to me and say Lord Lord
[44:44] have we not done many miracles and cast
[44:46] out devils and Jesus said I never knew
[44:48] you because you didn't do the will of
[44:50] God praise God
[44:52] they were workers of iniquity they loved
[44:55] the anointing while it was on them at
[44:57] the church service but outside of that
[44:59] they didn't live true to God's Word and
[45:02] Jesus calls that workers of iniquity so
[45:04] really there are three kinds of
[45:06] Christians right there's the wise the
[45:08] foolish and the imposters there's three
[45:11] kinds of Christians praise God and the
[45:15] workers of iniquity are the imposters
[45:17] they act like it for a time but they
[45:21] disobey the will of God and and they
[45:24] will not be saved the workers of
[45:27] iniquity but remember in the times the
[45:30] judges they had God's promise it was a
[45:34] it was a conditional promise to Joshua
[45:37] where God told Joshua you'll possess all
[45:40] these lands wherever you put your foot
[45:42] on you'll possess it and he gave them
[45:44] the borders from the sea all the way for
[45:47] the western border to the sea all the
[45:48] way to the eastern border by the river
[45:50] Jordan he gave him the whole borders but
[45:53] the Bible said that they never achieved
[45:56] those borders because of their
[45:58] disobedience that's right and so they
[46:02] had disobeyed the word of the Lord now
[46:07] look at verse let's go to chapter judges
[46:09] chapter 1 here I'm right there some of
[46:13] these are just for reviewing them for
[46:16] you look at verse 19
[46:20] judges 1:19
[46:22] and the Lord was with Judah and he drove
[46:23] out the inhabitants of the mountain but
[46:26] could not drive out the inhabitants of
[46:28] the valley because they had chariots of
[46:30] iron and they gave had brought unto
[46:32] Caleb as Moses said and he expelled
[46:35] thence
[46:36] the three sons of anak a church did you
[46:39] ever stop to think about that
[46:40] what do you mean God's not powerful
[46:43] enough to drive out a chariot ever
[46:46] thought about that of course God is able
[46:49] to drive out chariots but because of the
[46:52] people's lack of faith right
[46:54] what's a chariot to God right God form
[46:59] the iron that made the chariot a chariot
[47:03] is nothing in the hand of God against
[47:05] God so see all these scriptures have to
[47:08] fit into this this understanding that
[47:11] that God had given them power to drive
[47:14] out all the inhabitants but if they
[47:17] weren't driven out it wasn't God's fault
[47:19] it was the people's failure praise God
[47:22] look at verse 21 the children of
[47:25] Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
[47:27] that inhabited Jerusalem but the
[47:29] Jebusites dwell with the children of
[47:31] Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day they
[47:34] go down to verse 27
[47:36] neither did man asked to drive out the
[47:37] inhabitants of Beth she and her towns
[47:40] nor Dana and her towns northern
[47:43] heaviness of door in her towns northern
[47:45] heaviness of him in her towns northern
[47:47] habits of Meg Megiddo and her towns but
[47:51] the K Knights would dwell in that land
[47:53] and it came to pass when Israel was
[47:55] strong that they put the Canaanites a
[47:57] tribute and did not utterly drive them
[47:59] out so they they could have driven them
[48:02] out but they did it they put him on
[48:04] tribute my so now look at this even the
[48:11] amorite were bossing around the children
[48:12] of Dan how is that possible how is it
[48:16] that God's children are pushed around by
[48:18] heathens that wasn't God's will but it
[48:22] was allowed because of their unbelief
[48:23] verse 34 and the amorite forced the
[48:27] churn of Dan into the mountain for they
[48:30] would not suffer them to go down to the
[48:32] valley or what what do you mean are you
[48:34] serious God's people being pushed around
[48:37] by the enemy God had already told him
[48:41] you will not be the tail you'll be the
[48:43] head but that was based upon conditions
[48:46] praise God amen they had to obey the
[48:50] conditions of the word and if they
[48:52] obeyed the conditions in other words God
[48:54] was could only do in their lives but
[48:57] they let God do praise God
[48:58] same thing is today hallelujah God can
[49:02] only do in our lives what we allow him
[49:04] to do praise God
[49:05] through obedience and through submission
[49:07] and through his leadership and through
[49:10] the will of God amen
[49:14] now look at verse chapter two let's go
[49:17] to chapter two now in chapter 2 verses 1
[49:26] 2 & 3 the Bible said they begin making
[49:28] covenants with them God didn't want him
[49:31] to make covenants with the enemy he
[49:34] wanted them to have no covenants he'd
[49:35] already given them all those 460 years
[49:38] oh wow Israel was in Egypt he given him
[49:42] all of that space to repent and that's
[49:44] the reason he sent them back was to
[49:46] drive them out to drive out the
[49:48] inhabitants the land because they were
[49:49] evil they they put their own children in
[49:53] the fires the Bible said they were evil
[49:56] - they were abortionist right there were
[49:58] evil men and women there were heathens
[50:01] did awful unspeakable evils and God said
[50:04] that's the very reason I'm setting you
[50:06] in there he said you're gonna be my
[50:08] light to the nation's amen hallelujah
[50:10] Israel was to be the light to the
[50:13] nation's so are you jesus said you are
[50:15] the light of the world amen a city on
[50:18] the hill cannot be hidden people look at
[50:21] our lives and they should see the light
[50:23] and the love and the power of God amen
[50:28] we are the light of this world praise
[50:30] God just as Israel was the light now the
[50:33] bride is the light of the world
[50:37] now to go down to verse 10 this is how
[50:42] sad their condition got they started
[50:45] they started making leagues with them
[50:47] they could have driven
[50:48] them out but they didn't these are
[50:50] people that only wanted partial
[50:51] victories from the Word of God they were
[50:55] okay with just getting a little bit of
[50:57] victory and said but they still wouldn't
[51:00] have their sin on the side oh let that
[51:02] not be our testimony today praise God
[51:04] let's let's ask for a full victory
[51:08] praise God let's ask for a full healing
[51:10] let's ask for a life let's live a life
[51:13] that's fully devoted to God's will
[51:17] amen verse 10 of chapter 2 after Joshua
[51:23] died and also that generation were
[51:25] gathered unto their fathers and there
[51:27] arose another generation after them
[51:28] which knew not the Lord nor yet the
[51:31] works which he had done for Israel now
[51:35] you have a strange scripture here it
[51:37] seems that the next generation that
[51:39] rises up doesn't know what God's done so
[51:43] it makes it seem like the previous
[51:44] generation the original generation got a
[51:47] little relaxed as they got older right
[51:51] now of course the Bible said God will
[51:53] never leave himself without a witness so
[51:56] there was witnesses there and Deborah
[51:57] was one of them praise God amen
[51:59] all these judges in each generation God
[52:02] never left himself without a witness
[52:04] there was always somebody he could get
[52:06] his hand on that would believe the word
[52:08] that would deliver the people praise God
[52:10] amen but a lot of them even that came
[52:14] through the Bible said the next
[52:17] generation didn't know the works of the
[52:20] Lord
[52:21] so somebody started letting down the bar
[52:24] praise God and I got to remind myself at
[52:27] some point we have to have another
[52:29] testimony service where everybody can
[52:30] tell their testimonies because these
[52:32] children need to know what God has done
[52:34] in our lives I want to hear it again
[52:35] sister Karen for the hostei I want to
[52:38] hear it again praise God sister Beatrice
[52:40] of God will help you to share your
[52:42] testimonies times you know that God has
[52:45] moved in a supernatural way the next
[52:48] generation needs to know and it's it's
[52:52] not their opportunist panse ability it's
[52:54] our responsibility see part of that
[52:59] responsibility was on the previous
[53:00] generation too
[53:01] make sure they knew his remember God
[53:04] told him in Deuteronomy 6 he said you
[53:06] father's diligently train your children
[53:08] talk to them about the Lord when you
[53:10] rise up when you lay down when you go
[53:13] out to work when you come in right at
[53:15] the dinner table talk about the Lord
[53:17] amen
[53:18] he said put it on your fence outside
[53:20] your house like a word of the Lord
[53:23] in other words decorate your home with
[53:25] the things of God amen
[53:28] see there's a responsibility but this
[53:31] generation rose up and they didn't know
[53:33] the Lord look at verse 19 write 16 says
[53:41] nevertheless God still raised up judges
[53:43] to deliver them every couple of years it
[53:45] seemed like you know fifty years forty
[53:47] years there was different time periods
[53:49] where they would and then they would
[53:50] verse 17 they would always disobey the
[53:53] judges um they went a whoring after
[53:57] other gods and by themselves and then
[54:02] the Lord verse 18 would keep raising up
[54:04] more judges let's read 18 and when the
[54:06] Lord raised them up judges then the Lord
[54:08] was with the judge and delivered them on
[54:10] the hand of their enemies all the days
[54:11] of the judge for repented the Lord
[54:13] because of their groanings by reason of
[54:15] them that oppressed them and vexed them
[54:17] amen look at that church God was so
[54:20] great when he could find one person in
[54:22] this case one woman all the other judges
[54:25] were men but God just tried to find one
[54:29] loyal person and he used that person and
[54:32] annoyed them and raised them up and that
[54:34] person would deliver God's people and
[54:37] then the rest of the life of that judge
[54:40] the people were free amen
[54:42] most of them were they men would go back
[54:44] in the world but God would still honor
[54:47] the life and testimony of that original
[54:51] judge because he had a testimony that
[54:53] please God amen now look at that the
[54:56] rest of the people benefited a lot of
[54:59] them didn't take advantage of it and
[55:01] serve God could I just Jose can I just
[55:05] share your testimony real quick about
[55:06] that
[55:07] Perry green thing so you know sister
[55:11] Karen sat under brother and Brenda did
[55:13] you sit under Peregrine too for years so
[55:15] was a godly man he passed away a few
[55:16] years ago really godly man here his
[55:18] whole ministry was getting the people to
[55:19] see a prophet had come he was always
[55:21] pointing to the Prophet always
[55:22] everything it was God sent a prophet God
[55:25] sent a prophet and I'm glad he did
[55:26] praise God well you know Karen had told
[55:29] us different testimonies brother
[55:31] peregrina had to have different
[55:32] supernatural things one of them was his
[55:34] testimony of God telling him to take his
[55:36] hands off the the drivers wheel and the
[55:39] car drove itself for many miles wasn't
[55:42] it about six hours he watched God steer
[55:47] his car now that's a good testimony
[55:49] right there powerful testimony well Jose
[55:52] was sick this week brother right and
[55:54] he's watching a brother peregrines
[55:56] testimony on YouTube and he's got a very
[55:59] bad headache and he goes to sleep and
[56:00] brother Jose has a dream now it's
[56:03] strange he sees a Perry green like kinda
[56:05] like dead in his coffin at his funeral
[56:06] but then later in the dream he sees
[56:09] Perry green come pray over Jose cuz he's
[56:11] got a headache and when he woke up his
[56:13] headache was gone now now I told her the
[56:18] hose I think that's a great I think
[56:20] that's God's showing brother Jose and
[56:21] all of us that God honors his servants
[56:25] because Perry green he's passed on he
[56:28] can't pray for anybody now when it's to
[56:31] me it's showing that God was with that
[56:33] man in that ministry and brother Perry
[56:36] green he stood against the tape ministry
[56:38] to the tape he sure did they didn't like
[56:40] him I've got videos on that he knew
[56:44] because brother Perry green knew he was
[56:46] with brother branham on all those
[56:47] meetings
[56:48] he knew brother man was not for playing
[56:50] tapes he was from live man anointed with
[56:53] God's Spirit preaching God's Word
[56:55] because that was Paul's pattern but just
[56:59] that's an example it just came to me
[57:01] Rosie that's an example of God just
[57:03] blessing the people showing them that
[57:06] God was with that original man see God
[57:09] was with brother green and God gave a
[57:11] vindication of that this week just
[57:13] another one like you know just for us I
[57:15] think that's a great testimony so it was
[57:18] in the days of judges everybody would be
[57:21] blessed for the next 40 50 years because
[57:24] of one man or woman's obedience to God's
[57:26] Word
[57:30] and so we find here now I want to read a
[57:36] scripture to show you this here judges
[57:41] 17:6 I'm skipping ahead but I just want
[57:43] to read a scripture because it helps us
[57:44] understand the book of Judges in those
[57:47] days there was no king in Israel when
[57:50] every man did that which was right in
[57:52] his eyes
[57:54] there's no king all's they had was
[57:58] brother bang just judges and every town
[58:00] their little judges and we'll get to
[58:02] that a little bit because Moses actually
[58:04] established that before he died
[58:06] Moses established it and even Joshua
[58:09] established that there was to be judges
[58:11] if there was no prophet there hadn't
[58:13] been a judge like we have today right
[58:16] you get in trouble you got to go see the
[58:17] judge in Akron you get in trouble uh
[58:20] Columbus you got to go to see the judge
[58:22] in Columbus so there was local judges
[58:26] it's an exodus 21 that God originally
[58:29] called men to judge in Moses's time I'm
[58:33] gonna read Exodus 18:21 moreover thou
[58:37] shall provide out of all them able men
[58:39] such as fear God men of truth hating
[58:44] covetousness and the sad part is we got
[58:48] a bunch of judges today that are
[58:50] political right yeah they'll take a
[58:52] bribe from a Republican they'll take a
[58:54] bribe from a Democrat shame on any
[58:56] politician that will do that God said a
[59:00] real judge is impartial he don't favor
[59:04] anybody but God God and God's Word amen
[59:08] he said hating covetousness and place
[59:11] such over them to be rulers of thousands
[59:14] and thrillers of hundreds rulers of
[59:15] fifties and rulers of ten and let them
[59:19] judge the people at all seasons and it
[59:22] shall be that every great matter they
[59:23] shall bring unto thee now this is of
[59:24] course just Jethro giving Moses wisdom
[59:27] he got overloaded with all the cases so
[59:29] God sends our God anoints Moses and then
[59:33] Moses chooses men and raises them up to
[59:36] be judges over the thousands and
[59:38] hundreds and so forth also in numbers
[59:40] eleven
[59:41] he looked at this a few weeks ago
[59:45] Moses is so over overwhelmed with all
[59:48] the burden of these two million or more
[59:49] by this time three million four million
[59:52] he's so burned he said God did I beget
[59:55] all these children and God said okay
[59:57] I'll send the Holy Spirit the same
[59:59] spirit on you on seventy other men and
[1:00:03] they will judge you he said I'm sorry
[1:00:06] they will judge the people rather and it
[1:00:08] was men every time it was men right the
[1:00:15] Bible said the Lord came down in the
[1:00:16] cloud and numbers 11:25 and spake on him
[1:00:19] and took the spirit that was upon him
[1:00:20] and gave it unto the seventy elders and
[1:00:22] it came to pass that when the spirit
[1:00:24] rested on them they prophesied and did
[1:00:26] not cease and I remember we use a
[1:00:29] scripture last week to show taking sides
[1:00:32] with Jesus how program said this is
[1:00:33] God's system God takes the same spirit
[1:00:36] that's on the leader or the starter of
[1:00:38] the movement and puts it on other men
[1:00:40] that follow him and how do you know they
[1:00:43] got the right spirit because they say
[1:00:44] what the original man said praise God
[1:00:47] it's very easy amen what did Paul say
[1:00:50] that's what we're going back to right
[1:00:53] we're trusting that brother man preached
[1:00:55] what Paul preached and we we can trust
[1:00:57] it because we can go look and find it in
[1:00:59] the Bible and so that's God's system
[1:01:02] today he takes his spirit and puts it on
[1:01:05] that original man and then shares it
[1:01:07] with other faithful men that will point
[1:01:09] right back to the Word of God now Church
[1:01:12] a judge had supreme authority look at
[1:01:16] Deuteronomy 17 12 and the man that will
[1:01:19] do presumptuously and will not hearken
[1:01:20] under the priests that stand at the
[1:01:23] minister before the LORD thy God
[1:01:24] or unto the judge even that man shall
[1:01:28] die and thou shalt put away that evil
[1:01:31] from Israel
[1:01:32] so church a priest or a judge had power
[1:01:36] of life and death kind like today right
[1:01:41] so this was not a small job this was not
[1:01:45] a job of little responsibility this was
[1:01:48] a job where lives hang in the balance
[1:01:52] Futures families destinies right
[1:01:56] consequences hang in the balance of a
[1:01:58] judge right before his death joshua
[1:02:04] continued the judges system in joshua 23
[1:02:07] - and joshua called for all israel for
[1:02:11] the elders for their heads and for their
[1:02:13] judges and for their officers and send
[1:02:15] them i am old and stricken of age i'm
[1:02:17] skipping down to verse 10 one man of you
[1:02:20] shall chase a thousand so he's speaking
[1:02:22] to men judges that are meant for the
[1:02:24] lord your god he it is that fighteth for
[1:02:27] you as he hath promised you amen
[1:02:31] so before God dies I'm sorry before
[1:02:33] Joshua dies God can die before Joshua
[1:02:37] dies he gathers all the men and tells
[1:02:39] them you must judge and one of you if
[1:02:43] you obey God's Word will chase a
[1:02:44] thousand praise God so judge is not only
[1:02:49] a great Authority
[1:02:50] they had great supernatural ability if
[1:02:53] the people would just believe amen
[1:02:55] I don't know if the people just obeyed
[1:02:58] God's Word and and respected the judges
[1:03:01] then one man would chase a thousand
[1:03:03] enemies away praise God that's beautiful
[1:03:09] what a promise now I want to make sure I
[1:03:15] read a couple of more scriptures here
[1:03:19] because there's a lot I want to say
[1:03:21] about this topic here so judges here
[1:03:30] were gift with or they were gifted with
[1:03:33] truth the Holy Spirit anointed a judge
[1:03:36] to be able to discern truth that's
[1:03:39] that's what the word discernment means
[1:03:40] right judge November Hebrews 4:12 says
[1:03:45] the Word of God is quick and powerful
[1:03:46] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:03:49] tends of the heart it means it's a judge
[1:03:51] of it this Holy Spirit will discern
[1:03:54] between right and wrong
[1:03:55] he's sure intention the right intention
[1:03:58] or is your intention the wrong intention
[1:03:59] remember we saw last week our brother
[1:04:01] Ram said the reason he wanted to open
[1:04:03] the winners and escape the people was
[1:04:04] kind of selfish because he wanted to go
[1:04:06] up there and do more hunting
[1:04:09] see the angel discerned his motivations
[1:04:14] hope that doesn't sell anybody but see
[1:04:18] the whole the Word of God will always
[1:04:20] discern truth from air the right
[1:04:24] motivation from the wrong motivation the
[1:04:27] Word of God will always discern that and
[1:04:29] then reveal what's right or wrong and
[1:04:32] give you a choice
[1:04:33] that's why sermons sometimes will be
[1:04:35] directly right at you to show you which
[1:04:37] choice to make
[1:04:38] it's exactly what you're going through
[1:04:40] that's so you can make the right
[1:04:42] decision because that's what God's word
[1:04:46] comes to do it comes to rightly divide
[1:04:47] soul and spirit okay this is a soul
[1:04:49] matter this is a spirit matter here's
[1:04:51] right or wrong make the right choice
[1:04:54] it's simple right God makes it simple
[1:04:56] for us he makes it so simple that that
[1:04:59] the only way we wouldn't do the will of
[1:05:01] God is if we don't want to do the will
[1:05:03] of God but God wants he he so loved the
[1:05:06] world that He sent His Son Jesus to save
[1:05:09] the world from condemnation he did it by
[1:05:12] his love Church and we could just see
[1:05:14] how much God loves us he's a God of
[1:05:16] justice but he loves us praise God and
[1:05:19] he's laying before us today life and
[1:05:21] death blessing and curse let's accept
[1:05:23] life that's acceptable assing amen
[1:05:25] that's always obey God's Word in every
[1:05:29] case as we get to Lord willing in the
[1:05:32] next few weeks and we look at the will
[1:05:33] of God there's a known will of God and
[1:05:35] then there's your unknown will of God
[1:05:37] and that's why the Holy Spirit sends
[1:05:40] gifts to help you with the unknown
[1:05:43] things you don't know well it's
[1:05:46] beautiful I've been looking at the
[1:05:48] scripture last few days you there is a
[1:05:49] known will of God we know exactly what
[1:05:51] God wants with so many things but then
[1:05:54] with other things we don't know and
[1:05:56] that's what must be sought for that's
[1:05:59] the will that's why we set the Bible
[1:06:01] says you set your face to seek God it's
[1:06:03] not for the things you already know it's
[1:06:05] for the things you don't know praise God
[1:06:09] and so a judge was called of God with
[1:06:14] great responsibility now remember a
[1:06:18] judge was not a prophet right like a
[1:06:22] leader of
[1:06:23] what I mean like how Moses led the
[1:06:25] people Moses had all kinds of people
[1:06:28] raised up against him I was looking
[1:06:31] through that my notes about this
[1:06:33] remember his is Moses's brother and
[1:06:36] sister Aaron and Miriam making fun of
[1:06:38] who he married and God said what do you
[1:06:42] think Moses says you think he's just
[1:06:43] like a common person and I show dreams
[1:06:45] he said he's my prophet and I'll speak
[1:06:49] to him lip to ear how dare you speak and
[1:06:53] mock my prophet
[1:06:55] you know the Bible said God was really
[1:06:57] angry with Aaron for that he didn't live
[1:07:00] much longer him and Mirim did not live
[1:07:02] much longer after that
[1:07:03] Miriam Cork's got leprosy I don't know
[1:07:05] why Aaron in it but maybe she was more
[1:07:07] harsh with her her mocking I'm not sure
[1:07:10] but the Bible said that God was angry
[1:07:12] with them and so see you know and the
[1:07:16] Bible called Miriam a prophetess so
[1:07:19] there were signs Miriam would say thus
[1:07:20] saith the Lord and would come to pass
[1:07:22] now look Church we got to be careful not
[1:07:24] to let people or even brother Graham
[1:07:26] become common to us because Moses got so
[1:07:29] common well he's our brother he's our
[1:07:31] little brother I prophesied look God
[1:07:34] look what God did they're mean I'm OC
[1:07:37] they let Moses become too common and God
[1:07:40] had to show him you must always show
[1:07:41] respect for the servant of God God will
[1:07:48] honor those who respect and honor him
[1:07:51] Church in number 16 the Levites and
[1:07:56] Korah sought the priesthood from Aaron
[1:08:00] uh there was uh yeah and then Nathan
[1:08:08] member Kaur and Dathan
[1:08:10] and then there was Balaam there was all
[1:08:13] kinds of different prophets in that time
[1:08:14] that we're all trying to compete and and
[1:08:17] try to throw the people off but like
[1:08:20] with the Bible said the two that were
[1:08:23] faithful were Caleb and Joshua now why
[1:08:25] were they thankful the Bible said
[1:08:27] because they had a different spirit of
[1:08:28] them praise God amen didn't have to
[1:08:31] worry about them falling away why
[1:08:33] because they were real believers and the
[1:08:35] same as today
[1:08:36] don't worry about real people falling
[1:08:38] away the real Lex will never fall away
[1:08:41] they'll be like Caleb and Joshua
[1:08:43] they'll recognize the true ministry and
[1:08:45] they'll support that with all they got
[1:08:47] and they'll never fall away praise God
[1:08:50] yet there was a Balaam rose up he had
[1:08:53] some supernatural Korah Dathan different
[1:08:56] people everybody there was all these
[1:08:58] distractions all the time same thing
[1:09:00] today we have to stay with the Word of
[1:09:03] God that we know to be the revealed will
[1:09:06] of God Almighty praise God now let me
[1:09:13] read a few quotes here from brother
[1:09:15] Branham this is from if god be forced
[1:09:18] where be all the miracles I look he's
[1:09:19] laying out the condition of Deborah
[1:09:21] we're gonna start getting now two more
[1:09:22] on Deborah's life and testimony program
[1:09:26] said we're all acquainted with the
[1:09:27] judges of Israel how they had done the
[1:09:29] Israelites the Philistines and many
[1:09:31] nights em writes all the different ones
[1:09:33] had come in like locusts and just eat up
[1:09:36] what they had and take it out and go on
[1:09:37] but did you notice they cannot do that
[1:09:40] until Israel first fell away from God so
[1:09:45] Graham is gonna show how many times
[1:09:47] things happen in our lives because we're
[1:09:50] disobeying God he says the devil can't
[1:09:56] set a foot on you to hurt you until you
[1:09:59] first get away from God you first you
[1:10:04] must first remember that check when
[1:10:05] anything happens see if you're in the
[1:10:07] faith or not see that if your right to
[1:10:09] the place with God then remember the
[1:10:11] devil can do you no harm you're in
[1:10:12] Christ
[1:10:14] of course even this must be balanced
[1:10:16] right because Paul he was right with God
[1:10:18] but he said getting that satanic
[1:10:20] buffeting messenger remember that it's I
[1:10:23] Corinthians 12 so we have to so whenever
[1:10:27] bad things happen we have to examine
[1:10:28] ourselves and say is this because of my
[1:10:31] is this because of my mistake or is this
[1:10:34] God letting me go through a test to make
[1:10:36] me a better Christian hey men praise God
[1:10:43] said and a few years before this but now
[1:10:46] he's romance preaching on getting this
[1:10:48] sermon if God be with us where we all
[1:10:50] the miracles but he said a few years
[1:10:52] before Gideon there had been the
[1:10:53] prophetess Deborah and barek and how
[1:10:56] that she had prophesied and told them
[1:10:57] what to do and it was just exactly right
[1:11:00] Barrack the great warrior and how they
[1:11:02] made a song of the triumph over the
[1:11:04] enemy but as soon as they got out of
[1:11:06] that twist right straight back into the
[1:11:09] rut they went again oh how many people
[1:11:13] do we see it Church they'll get a little
[1:11:14] victory they'll come to church and be
[1:11:16] excited for a few weeks and then pretty
[1:11:19] soon they don't see him anymore
[1:11:20] what happened this is what happened
[1:11:24] they weren't they never got the spirit
[1:11:26] of the revival all the way in them
[1:11:28] praise God they got a little bit of
[1:11:31] victory they got a little bit of
[1:11:32] excitement a little bit of blessing but
[1:11:35] they never continued in until that
[1:11:38] blessing lived in them every single day
[1:11:41] in other words they might have got
[1:11:43] justified but they never got sanctified
[1:11:48] hi he said if that isn't the picture of
[1:11:54] the church today just as soon as it gets
[1:11:56] out of one twist right into another one
[1:11:59] it goes but the time had come for action
[1:12:06] now get talking about Gideon he said
[1:12:09] that's the same now the time has come
[1:12:10] for action the time has come when
[1:12:12] playing Church had to become to a halt
[1:12:14] with God there's a woman this week that
[1:12:17] emailed me and said I listen to tapes
[1:12:18] all the time I tried to the best I can't
[1:12:20] have been baptized but I can't get the
[1:12:21] Holy Ghost and I said you got to get
[1:12:24] down to business with God when I got the
[1:12:26] Holy Ghost I would go to church and just
[1:12:28] pray before the service and I was just
[1:12:30] looking for God to fill me all the time
[1:12:32] when I was at home I wait till people
[1:12:34] left I go up in my closet and just
[1:12:36] prayed say God fill me with the Holy
[1:12:37] Ghost you got to be you got to be
[1:12:40] longing for it you got to be under
[1:12:42] expectation if people aren't getting
[1:12:45] fairness because they're not obeying all
[1:12:47] the Word of God because the Bible said
[1:12:49] I'll freely give you a gift if you just
[1:12:51] obey God's Word the Bible said acts 5:32
[1:12:54] he gives the Holy Ghost to them that
[1:12:56] obey
[1:13:00] so there's a reason if we're not born
[1:13:03] again it's because we got to obey the
[1:13:05] Word of God we got to really believe God
[1:13:07] got to confess anything wrong in our
[1:13:09] lives now let's look at this thought
[1:13:15] here I want to read this quote from
[1:13:18] brother Branham Deborah being a judge
[1:13:22] was like a politician today like a woman
[1:13:26] politician today or woman judge today
[1:13:28] right that really wasn't her place
[1:13:33] because by scripture all the judges were
[1:13:36] supposed to be men but as you'll see
[1:13:39] there was nobody else that could do it
[1:13:42] right that's why God allowed it it
[1:13:47] wasn't God's perfect will God's perfect
[1:13:50] will would have been the people just
[1:13:51] stayed on fire and all the men and
[1:13:53] leadership would have been on fire and
[1:13:54] serving God but the Bible said they went
[1:13:58] a whoring after after every victory once
[1:14:00] life got easy then they went in the sin
[1:14:03] a church that's the danger for message
[1:14:05] people - once we get a few victories we
[1:14:08] got to stay dedicated to God we got to
[1:14:10] keep praying gonna keep reading your
[1:14:12] Bible keep studying keep serving God
[1:14:15] keep asking questions about the Word of
[1:14:16] God keep going in the Word of God keep
[1:14:18] hungry and thirsty when things get easy
[1:14:21] it's not the time to relax it's the time
[1:14:23] to grow more in love with God that's
[1:14:27] always that was always Israel's problem
[1:14:30] they get a few victories things get easy
[1:14:31] they go back into sin because I read you
[1:14:38] the scriptures you saw Joshua numbers 11
[1:14:41] number Exodus 18 every time God talked
[1:14:44] about judges it was always to be men now
[1:14:48] program as is asked I'm sorry no brother
[1:14:50] man tells a story about a woman rebuking
[1:14:52] him for not accepting women preachers
[1:14:56] don't read this quote to you here real
[1:14:58] quick
[1:15:02] said oh now he's talking about the
[1:15:04] initial evidence ain't speaking in
[1:15:05] tongues then he's against women
[1:15:08] preachers and this was a woman preacher
[1:15:10] so a woman preacher come against brother
[1:15:12] Branham and he says now I was eating
[1:15:17] breakfast with them and they said
[1:15:18] brother bran look at this would you
[1:15:20] think it and pulled out a letter and I
[1:15:22] said well sister she don't understand
[1:15:24] the boys told me their mother was a
[1:15:26] woman preacher she didn't go for the
[1:15:28] message and now she says in there now he
[1:15:31] said women shouldn't not have authority
[1:15:33] over man because that's what first
[1:15:35] Timothy 2 says right now they said
[1:15:40] brother how about Phoebe in the Bible
[1:15:42] Paul's helper because member Phoebe was
[1:15:44] a helper to Paul in the gospel but Ram
[1:15:48] says certainly she was a seller of goods
[1:15:50] and Paul asked the people he said do you
[1:15:53] think Paul would say let the women keep
[1:15:55] sign on the churches not permitted them
[1:15:57] to speak and turn around say now Phoebe
[1:15:59] our helper in the gospel she's gonna
[1:16:01] preach a few nights he said that was
[1:16:04] contradict himself
[1:16:05] remember Paul's letters got shared with
[1:16:08] everybody did you know in Peters last
[1:16:11] letter
[1:16:11] Peter said everybody knew he knew all of
[1:16:15] Paul's letters were Scripture did you
[1:16:17] know that Paul said Peter sent some of
[1:16:20] them are hard to understand he gets in
[1:16:22] those mysteries and those deep types of
[1:16:24] you know allegories of Ishmael and and
[1:16:27] and Isaac and all these types of Sarah
[1:16:29] and Hagar he gets in these deep
[1:16:31] mysteries but what he says is right so
[1:16:39] he says what about Phoebe so see all the
[1:16:42] churches would have read where Paul said
[1:16:43] I don't forbid a woman to preach the
[1:16:46] gospel to men so they said well brother
[1:16:50] man what about Deborah she was one of
[1:16:51] the judges in the Bible a woman was a
[1:16:54] judge in the Bible if that's not a
[1:16:55] thority over man now church in one way
[1:16:58] it was it just be like going to the
[1:17:02] judge the if you went to the judge today
[1:17:03] he or she would have authority over you
[1:17:07] well Graham says
[1:17:12] they said brother man that always
[1:17:13] puzzled me I said why sister why would
[1:17:15] you that puzzle you said well because a
[1:17:17] woman judge brother man said I said
[1:17:19] that's politics not the church okay
[1:17:24] so Deborah was in political power right
[1:17:28] judge power not Church power he said not
[1:17:35] the church they don't have one thing to
[1:17:37] do with the church Paul said let them be
[1:17:39] under obedience as saith the law and the
[1:17:41] law can't put a woman up to be a priest
[1:17:43] can't put it up you never seen a woman
[1:17:45] high priest you never seen a woman a
[1:17:47] priest nowhere in the Bible you never
[1:17:49] seen a woman a preacher in the Bible
[1:17:50] certainly so everybody can see that Wow
[1:17:55] the Bible said Deborah sat under a tree
[1:17:57] and people would come and she'd listen
[1:18:00] their story and then she would judge it
[1:18:03] and tell him exactly what to do and the
[1:18:05] Bible said it was right every time right
[1:18:08] but that but while that was going on
[1:18:11] Israel had a priesthood in a church
[1:18:13] going on she wasn't in the temple or she
[1:18:16] wasn't in the tent to praise God she
[1:18:18] wasn't over there in the tent and and
[1:18:20] ministering and going into the holy
[1:18:21] place or anything like that she was wet
[1:18:24] she wasn't even a part of that she sat
[1:18:27] in her courthouse and judged the people
[1:18:30] she wasn't in the house of God and a
[1:18:35] good point is that remember this is a
[1:18:38] time when the people were back slid
[1:18:40] every other judge was a man except one
[1:18:43] woman thank God for though she was a
[1:18:45] godly woman wonderful testimony powerful
[1:18:49] so you have that the Word of God never
[1:18:52] made a woman a priest shies away from
[1:18:54] handling the Word of God but in a time
[1:18:57] when the the church was at its lowest
[1:18:59] ebb didn't have a prophet didn't have a
[1:19:02] real leadership didn't have a king to
[1:19:05] really establish the leadership then God
[1:19:07] used a woman because nobody else would
[1:19:11] do it
[1:19:12] praise God I say the same today God will
[1:19:15] use anybody who's willing to serve Him
[1:19:18] God will use a lukewarm foolish virgin
[1:19:22] I should they look for lukewarm I said
[1:19:23] God will use a foolish virgin woman
[1:19:25] preacher if the man won't rise up and do
[1:19:28] it you say prove that I'll be happy too
[1:19:31] in 1953 brother and prayed for a woman
[1:19:35] who was a woman preacher and God healed
[1:19:41] her and God never rebuked her for
[1:19:44] preaching you know why because God had
[1:19:46] already rebuked everyone brother Brian
[1:19:47] was preaching it and God knew she
[1:19:50] probably wouldn't repent but when it
[1:19:53] came down to divine healing God healed
[1:19:57] the woman look up brother BAM said he
[1:19:58] said now all right come lady you believe
[1:19:59] me to be God's prophet prophet means
[1:20:01] preacher you understand that the reason
[1:20:03] you believe because you're a preacher
[1:20:05] yourself
[1:20:08] well isn't that right that's right yes
[1:20:10] ma'am you have female trouble of low
[1:20:13] blood and you're a minister is that
[1:20:15] right you're healed in the name of the
[1:20:18] Lord Jesus Christ be made well what what
[1:20:24] see someone loves me and that could be a
[1:20:27] surprise because we know it's absolutely
[1:20:30] against what he preached but under that
[1:20:32] anointing member God is not a respecter
[1:20:34] of persons praise God if that woman
[1:20:38] needed faith for healing or I'm sorry
[1:20:40] that woman had faith for healing and she
[1:20:43] comes on the same ground as brother
[1:20:45] Branham or any other preacher God is
[1:20:47] obligated to his word he has to heal her
[1:20:50] if it's her faith believes in divine
[1:20:53] healing a woman minister healed under
[1:21:00] the prophets message absolutely
[1:21:03] absolutely we know uh you know there was
[1:21:08] many people that were healed right that
[1:21:09] weren't fully true to God's Word God can
[1:21:13] heal anybody as long as they believe
[1:21:15] praise God and so see Deborah was was
[1:21:21] was living at a time I'll say like this
[1:21:24] where was her husband I'm sure he was a
[1:21:26] good man I'm sure but why wasn't he the
[1:21:30] judge men were the leaders of the family
[1:21:33] where's her husband well he just was
[1:21:36] just got a little pushover maybe
[1:21:40] he should have been there or another man
[1:21:43] in their little city there should have
[1:21:45] risen up but if nobody will rise up
[1:21:47] gotta look for a humble heart and he'll
[1:21:49] raise them up that ought to encourage
[1:21:52] you got to look at your situation see if
[1:21:55] nobody else can do it God used me I see
[1:21:59] this person needs help or if I can be a
[1:22:01] light there now I'm not saying break the
[1:22:03] word of God never break the word of God
[1:22:04] but if maybe you you you you usually
[1:22:08] wouldn't do something maybe it's like
[1:22:09] let's say for a sister maybe you
[1:22:11] wouldn't pray for the sick cuz you're
[1:22:12] just you know you want to lay hands on a
[1:22:14] man or yo that's fine but maybe God
[1:22:16] would anoint you to give him a prayer
[1:22:19] cloth so we must be open to God using us
[1:22:24] maybe if nobody else would do it you we
[1:22:27] can rise up in faith and say God used me
[1:22:29] I feel your anointing to do it so see
[1:22:35] brother Graham has to correct them it's
[1:22:36] not the priesthood it's political he
[1:22:42] said there was numerous prophetess
[1:22:43] Miriam different ones but a man says
[1:22:47] sometimes there were queens over them
[1:22:49] and so forth like that king and queen at
[1:22:51] the decease of the King the Queen had to
[1:22:53] take his place so they elected another
[1:22:54] King and so forth that's what brother
[1:22:56] Bram says sometimes women got put in
[1:22:58] those positions where they had to they
[1:23:00] had to rule they had to take authority
[1:23:02] until another man came now program makes
[1:23:06] a real striking statement here it's kind
[1:23:09] of harsh but he said we got a woman
[1:23:10] judge in the city he said that's the
[1:23:12] reason the city is so polluted now that
[1:23:17] might be hard for people to see but
[1:23:18] obviously brother Branham must have had
[1:23:20] some discernment to know she was a
[1:23:21] corrupt woman because we know God is the
[1:23:25] same yesterday today and forever right
[1:23:27] so Tucson was in bad condition because
[1:23:30] of the woman judge but Israel was in a
[1:23:32] good position because they had a woman
[1:23:34] judge are you with me everything Church
[1:23:37] Deborah was a good judge and God blessed
[1:23:40] that generation because of Deborah but
[1:23:43] now there's a woman judge in Tucson and
[1:23:45] she's awful
[1:23:47] Saint could there could there be the
[1:23:49] same thing today I believe it because
[1:23:51] listen could we have
[1:23:53] woman judge today that God would bless
[1:23:55] yes even if she's foolish virgin yes I
[1:23:58] believe that it's possible I believe
[1:24:01] it's the perfect will of God no but I
[1:24:03] believe God could use it for his glory
[1:24:05] why because he did it in the Old
[1:24:07] Testament never wasn't born again and
[1:24:10] the church said she wasn't born again
[1:24:13] yet God used her when there was nobody
[1:24:16] else so to rise up for righteousness let
[1:24:19] me use another example didn't God use
[1:24:21] lot as a judge was he'd on the same
[1:24:25] level as Abraham no no no but God use
[1:24:31] whoever would be a witness there praise
[1:24:37] God remember when Sarah Palin almost
[1:24:42] became vice-president member 2008 that
[1:24:46] was on that was all over the news I was
[1:24:48] a CNN video about it they asked they
[1:24:50] went on ask these different preachers
[1:24:52] you know how could you be a Christian
[1:24:54] and support Sarah Palin possibly in vice
[1:24:57] president and the man said it just shows
[1:24:59] the condition that America is in he said
[1:25:02] it's the same it's vody back I'm a good
[1:25:04] he's a good Baptist preacher right but
[1:25:07] he said it just shows America's in the
[1:25:09] same position as Israel I'm like that's
[1:25:11] nothing but the truth nothing but the
[1:25:14] truth because where's that the Prophet
[1:25:15] God's off the scene Alleluia praise God
[1:25:19] and I'll say like this if the brothers
[1:25:23] don't like the women being vice
[1:25:24] president why don't the brothers would
[1:25:25] go run for office right where's the men
[1:25:30] how come the men don't step up see it's
[1:25:34] not going to be those women fought if
[1:25:35] Deborah is that in Deborah generation
[1:25:37] though she won't be held accountable
[1:25:39] it really wasn't God's perfect will but
[1:25:43] at least she was willing to serve God
[1:25:45] amen remember in the days of Hezekiah
[1:25:51] church remember that he was 25 when he
[1:25:54] became King the Bible said as soon as he
[1:25:56] became king he clean up the house of God
[1:25:58] his dad and let the house of God go to
[1:26:00] waste
[1:26:00] the doors were falling off and there was
[1:26:03] idols everywhere and as soon as he
[1:26:05] became King where they met he
[1:26:06] broke down all the idols he smashed him
[1:26:08] to dust threw him in the river and clean
[1:26:11] it all up and the Bible said they held
[1:26:12] the feast I think it was the feast of
[1:26:14] Passover and the Bible said they were
[1:26:16] low on priests so they had to make some
[1:26:18] people priests who were not priests just
[1:26:21] for that situation and the Bible said
[1:26:23] God allowed it because they needed it
[1:26:26] God let men act as priests who were
[1:26:30] priests in order to handle the Word of
[1:26:32] God in order to handle the worship let
[1:26:35] the people worship the way he won them
[1:26:37] the worship raised God amen
[1:26:44] let me say like well I better not go
[1:26:47] there I don't want to go there there's a
[1:26:50] few things I what I was going to say was
[1:26:52] something like this like God may have
[1:26:54] churches where it looks like people are
[1:26:55] breaking the word and they probably are
[1:26:57] but it's because it's not there's no one
[1:27:00] else that could do it now what I mean by
[1:27:04] that and are probably not wise version
[1:27:06] they're probably foolish version but at
[1:27:08] least they're doing something for God
[1:27:11] I've never met many women preachers but
[1:27:13] although the denominational preachers I
[1:27:15] have met I've just tried to encourage
[1:27:16] them and share what I know and testify
[1:27:18] like the one time I was test to find
[1:27:20] that Lutheran preacher we just got out
[1:27:22] of the marriage
[1:27:23] or the wedding and I'm testifying and I
[1:27:25] was touched it was my wife soldiers and
[1:27:27] I said preacher I said God has been so
[1:27:30] good to me I said he delivered me from
[1:27:31] cigarettes he delivered me from chewing
[1:27:33] tobacco
[1:27:34] I set me free by the power of God I
[1:27:36] wasn't shouting like that but I'm
[1:27:37] getting excited now I was like he set me
[1:27:40] free he delivered me from you know bad
[1:27:43] movies and and and cigarettes and
[1:27:45] chewing tobacco and he went like this he
[1:27:48] said he tapped his breasts right here
[1:27:50] his chest and he said yeah I still can't
[1:27:53] get over cigarettes so I carry him right
[1:27:55] here in my pocket I thought oh my god
[1:27:57] have mercy I said now I know I was
[1:27:59] supposed to come to this church service
[1:28:00] I was coming to testify that God is the
[1:28:03] real Living God can deliver us from that
[1:28:06] and a real experience with God will
[1:28:09] sanctify you from that you know clean
[1:28:11] you out from that that he you know the
[1:28:13] Bible said you don't depend on those
[1:28:15] things you depend on the power of the
[1:28:17] Holy Spirit
[1:28:17] I knew later why I was I was
[1:28:20] raise I was taken there to be a witness
[1:28:22] against that ministry now could God use
[1:28:26] that man he could he could God use a lot
[1:28:31] of people that maybe didn't fit the
[1:28:32] qualifications so I want to just read
[1:28:41] those quotes so if you haven't heard
[1:28:43] those they would help you out that
[1:28:45] Deborah is wasn't in she wasn't in the
[1:28:47] priests and in fact you'll never find a
[1:28:49] woman in the priesthood in the whole Old
[1:28:51] Testament God never even let one get
[1:28:54] there just so the types worked you let a
[1:28:57] woman be judged but he let a woman get
[1:28:59] to the priesthood
[1:29:00] that's how much he protected it now
[1:29:06] let's go to judges chapter 4 let's
[1:29:08] finish here I'll give me I'm gonna set
[1:29:11] my timer 15 minutes here judges chapter
[1:29:18] 4 verse 1 let's let's look at this life
[1:29:21] this beautiful life of Deborah do you
[1:29:23] know her name means B it means a B
[1:29:26] Barrack means lightning there's a lot of
[1:29:37] great lessons we can learn in there how
[1:29:38] many love the Lord today
[1:29:39] there's so many church the reason I felt
[1:29:42] led to preach us is just encourage our
[1:29:43] sisters but also so you'll know you and
[1:29:46] I shouldn't be arrogant towards people
[1:29:48] that don't believe what we believe we
[1:29:50] should be loving if God healed a woman
[1:29:52] preacher through His Prophet and let her
[1:29:55] keep preaching no doubt well then let's
[1:29:58] be kind to those people because I'll sit
[1:30:00] like this church that they have a place
[1:30:01] in God's economy there's gonna be people
[1:30:04] the bride is gonna live in that holy
[1:30:06] city but there's got to be people
[1:30:08] outside the city to fill the earth
[1:30:10] there's got to be people kings and
[1:30:13] peoples that bring their glory into the
[1:30:15] city they have a place in God's economy
[1:30:19] like all the time you'll hear me say I
[1:30:21] thank God for the Assembly of God
[1:30:23] denomination I was raised and at least I
[1:30:26] went to a church they let women wear
[1:30:29] pants and watch movies and sports and
[1:30:31] but I knew I felt the presence of God
[1:30:33] many
[1:30:34] times they're like amen and whoever tell
[1:30:37] me this you know they they talk with a
[1:30:39] mint one of a men's family members who
[1:30:41] went to a denominational Church and had
[1:30:42] a supernatural experience remember you
[1:30:43] were telling me that brother and like a
[1:30:46] discernment like this person discerned a
[1:30:48] demon in one of his friends or how can
[1:30:53] we don't see that message well we do
[1:30:54] sometimes it just depends who's got the
[1:30:55] gifts praise God and that that
[1:31:00] encouraged me like you can remember
[1:31:02] though primer I was happy when I heard
[1:31:04] that praise God that their family and
[1:31:07] friends can go to churches and get
[1:31:09] deliverance thank God for that
[1:31:12] but I wonder if that denominational
[1:31:14] Church when it comes down to women
[1:31:15] preachers I wonder what they say I
[1:31:17] wonder what they say about women the
[1:31:19] men's hair length wonder what they would
[1:31:21] say about water baptism and the Godhead
[1:31:23] and all these things that we know are
[1:31:26] thus saith the Lord but see I want to be
[1:31:29] happy I want to rejoice at least demons
[1:31:31] are getting driven off of people praise
[1:31:33] God so I want to encourage all of us
[1:31:38] that we should have we should always
[1:31:40] brother Manson in the my family I
[1:31:43] listened to it last week brother Graham
[1:31:45] sending questions and answers on the
[1:31:46] seals
[1:31:47] he said never make yourself odd to be a
[1:31:49] Christian now you're you're obviously
[1:31:52] gonna look odd just by how you dress
[1:31:54] especially if you're a woman but you
[1:31:57] don't have to act and do strange things
[1:31:59] brother and he said he summarized he
[1:32:01] said just tell the people all the time
[1:32:03] how much you love Jesus
[1:32:06] don't be odd don't be strange and act
[1:32:09] like you got you know some secret
[1:32:12] channel to God no God can hear their
[1:32:14] prayers too and honestly they might even
[1:32:18] have more gifts that we have because the
[1:32:20] gifts and callings of God are without
[1:32:22] repentance none of you can add any cubit
[1:32:26] to your stature I can't add any gifts to
[1:32:29] my stature whatever I have got already
[1:32:31] gave to me praise God who are we that
[1:32:35] can add gifts we can't add gifts to our
[1:32:36] stature we just got to work with what
[1:32:38] God gave us a man we got to yield to the
[1:32:40] Holy Spirit and let God use us to the
[1:32:44] greatest extent that he can
[1:32:54] so I wanted to make sure everybody
[1:32:56] understands that that we should have the
[1:32:57] such a sweet kind attitude towards
[1:33:00] anyone that we see is trying to serve
[1:33:03] the Lord we should just be so kind to
[1:33:07] them and pray for them and encourage
[1:33:08] them because they are they have a part
[1:33:11] in God's economy they have a part now
[1:33:14] they remember they're not the dollar
[1:33:15] they're not the silver dollar they might
[1:33:17] be a nickel or penny but God can still
[1:33:20] use them for his glory and let me just
[1:33:28] share this too with who is dead but the
[1:33:31] Amen remembers brother amen called me I
[1:33:33] was on when it was on a Wednesday
[1:33:34] Tuesday morning and I told you this
[1:33:38] before I had woken up that morning at
[1:33:40] 4:15 I couldn't get three scriptures out
[1:33:42] of my mind one of them was about there's
[1:33:44] power of life and death in the tongue so
[1:33:48] when a man called me I didn't know this
[1:33:50] had happened I was shocked that who his
[1:33:52] dad was so sick and almost dying and you
[1:33:54] guess he'd already died and came back I
[1:33:56] think that was right is that right they
[1:33:59] couldn't find a heartbeat
[1:34:00] is that what it was at first cuz he was
[1:34:02] turned all purple right and then they
[1:34:06] took they shocked him and brought his
[1:34:07] life back and then a man called me the
[1:34:08] next morning a man might remember but I
[1:34:11] said I said let's speak the word brother
[1:34:12] remember I was I had Lidia Malachi my
[1:34:16] office
[1:34:16] they might remember too I walked out and
[1:34:18] I just I remember I was staring up at
[1:34:20] the hills and I just spoke and I spoke
[1:34:22] to them out remember that he meant I
[1:34:23] prayed that I said I speak to that
[1:34:24] mountain of sickness in the name of
[1:34:26] Jesus Christ let their dad come out of
[1:34:29] that hospital and let him get well now

[1:34:37] and then afterbang told me that two and
[1:34:41] half weeks later he said all of a sudden
[1:34:43] within those last two days something

[1:34:47] of strength back and he come back home
[1:34:51] now

[1:34:55] led of the Holy Spirit to speak to that
[1:34:57] mountain did he come out of there yeah
[1:35:00] bang wrote it down and said it was a
[1:35:02] miracle see we see miracles by speaking

[1:36:59] on the side of the Lord when a hoot he

[1:37:38] bondage and they after 20 years they

[1:37:43] these are the same ones that were
[1:37:45] worshipping idols a few years later or
[1:37:47] earlier it's like a lot of people today
[1:37:51] they only crowd to God when something
[1:37:52] bad happens church I want to be faithful
[1:37:55] to God in the good times and the bad
[1:37:57] times I want God to hear my voice on the

[1:38:49] types in the Bible he said look for

[1:38:55] types in the Bible that's the chapter I
[1:38:57] just wrote this week there's so many
[1:38:58] types

[1:39:03] there's a type of the bride I there's
[1:39:05] all they're all typed the bride of Jesus
[1:39:06] Christ Abigail Abigail his husband had
[1:39:10] to die that she can marry the king
[1:39:12] that's what the Bible says in Romans 7
[1:39:15] the Bible says that we should be married
[1:39:17] to another we should be dead to the law
[1:39:20] our first husband but we should be
[1:39:22] married to Christ amen
[1:39:23] glory oh it's rich my Candace
[1:39:28] all these things point to the the bride
[1:39:32] the woman the church 20 years of losses
[1:39:38] can you imagine having a drought for 20
[1:39:40] years just bad things for 20 years I
[1:39:42] would think after the first two months

[1:39:49] years I want my I want my heart to cry

[1:40:03] to sin I don't want to live in the
[1:40:05] snares of the devil I want to be free
[1:40:08] you mothers and children want to be free
[1:40:11] in Christ Jesus amen
[1:40:12] we want to be free we don't want to be a
[1:40:15] slave to sin and corruption now in
[1:40:19] verses 4 to 9 look at this gallant woman
[1:40:23] here Deborah look it's let's look at her
[1:40:25] for last few minutes here at verse 4
[1:40:27] endeavor a prophetess the wife of lappa
[1:40:30] Dolph now I'm not saying against the
[1:40:31] boat he should have been the judge God
[1:40:35] didn't call women to be judges she
[1:40:37] judged Israel at that time and she dwell
[1:40:40] under the palm tree of Deborah between
[1:40:42] Rhema and Bethel in the Mount Ephraim
[1:40:44] and the turn of Israel came up to her
[1:40:45] for judgment and she sent and called
[1:40:49] Barrack the son of ABBA no I am out of
[1:40:51] Kadish Naphtali and said unto Him hath
[1:40:54] not the Lord God of Israel commanded
[1:40:56] saying go and draw toward Mount Tabor
[1:40:59] and take with thee ten thousand men of
[1:41:01] the children of Naphtali and the
[1:41:03] children of his ebullient look at this
[1:41:05] she's reminding him she said didn't God
[1:41:08] tell you what to do to get the victory
[1:41:11] in other words here's a woman gotta
[1:41:14] remind the man the leader of the army
[1:41:17] didn't God tell us to do this already
[1:41:19] shouldn't we have been doing this
[1:41:21] already praise God you ever have to do
[1:41:25] that you ever have to remind somebody
[1:41:26] with the Word of God
[1:41:28] didn't I tell you this already don't we
[1:41:31] know we should do this already
[1:41:33] look how humble she is Andrew Deborah
[1:41:36] was a very humble woman she's a very
[1:41:39] humble judges we'll get to this you'll
[1:41:40] see how
[1:41:41] almost she was she never glorified
[1:41:43] herself but she says it real homely
[1:41:46] didn't the Lord say in other words
[1:41:49] didn't you already have the saith the
[1:41:51] Lord and why haven't you obeyed it verse
[1:41:56] six no seven God told him what was gonna
[1:42:01] happen Church look at verse seven and I
[1:42:03] will draw unto thee to the river of
[1:42:04] Keshawn see sirrah the captain of
[1:42:07] jaemin's army with his chariots with his
[1:42:09] multitude and I'll deliver him into thy
[1:42:11] hand God already told him to go gather
[1:42:13] go to that River I'm gonna bring the
[1:42:16] enemy right to your doorstep
[1:42:18] and the man barracks kinda like you know
[1:42:22] he kind of sat on it for a while we
[1:42:23] don't know how long but she's trying to
[1:42:25] remind him didn't I already tell you
[1:42:26] thus saith the Lord
[1:42:28] see how it's hard sometimes for men to
[1:42:29] humble themselves and the church said it
[1:42:34] is hard for men me it's men it's hard
[1:42:38] for men sometimes to humble themselves
[1:42:40] so God gives a gracious woman to barrack
[1:42:46] to remind him didn't how we already say
[1:42:48] got thus saith the Lord and this is what
[1:42:51] you got to do look at the next verse
[1:42:57] look at verse eight look how barrack
[1:42:59] says he says and barrack sending her if
[1:43:01] thou wilt go with me then I will go but
[1:43:06] if that will not go with me I will not
[1:43:09] go look at this guy
[1:43:11] Church this guy is in the Hall of Fame
[1:43:14] of faith just like it in right he said
[1:43:20] ah he said fine he said if you think you
[1:43:23] got though say the Lord in other words I
[1:43:25] won't move on your thus saith the Lord
[1:43:27] unless you're willing to go with your
[1:43:29] own prophecy see the nice trust there
[1:43:33] they build up there but if you know if
[1:43:39] you don't act glory if you don't act on
[1:43:41] your own word I'm not acting on it
[1:43:43] either praise God and that's what a real
[1:43:45] that's what a real bride Church you do
[1:43:46] today my life you should look at my life
[1:43:49] and see it as I obey the word you should
[1:43:50] do the same praise God Amen what we saw
[1:43:55] brother
[1:43:55] do and they obeyed the word and God
[1:43:57] vindicate it we should do it to praise
[1:43:59] God see he and also he thought too he
[1:44:07] said I'm not going out there without
[1:44:07] that anointed prophet the Bible says if
[1:44:13] you there's 15 minutes sorry the Bible
[1:44:17] says if you respect God's prophets God
[1:44:18] will prosper you she said if you okay if
[1:44:23] you're the anointed prophet yes if you
[1:44:24] if you're gonna act upon your prophecy
[1:44:26] then yes I'll go if you go now it's
[1:44:29] important as she went to because church
[1:44:31] he gave the very sign when to start the
[1:44:33] battle usually the man the king was
[1:44:36] standing there and said let's go forth
[1:44:37] in the battle right he's looking the
[1:44:41] whole time say sister when do we start
[1:44:43] this battle ready when we go and sister
[1:44:48] when we go start this battle he was
[1:44:50] waiting for the sister to tell him when
[1:44:52] to start the battle that's scriptural
[1:44:55] look at verse 9 and she said I will
[1:44:58] surely go with thee notwithstanding the
[1:45:00] journey that thou talked take us shall
[1:45:01] not be for thine honor
[1:45:03] oh now God's unveiling it now berrak was
[1:45:06] waiting because he was a little selfish
[1:45:08] he wanted his own honor and this but
[1:45:11] look at this the word the word Lord has
[1:45:13] to come to the through the woman to tell
[1:45:16] this man this ain't for your honor God's
[1:45:20] gonna honor somebody else look at this
[1:45:23] church for the Lord shall sell sister
[1:45:29] into the hand of a woman and Deborah
[1:45:34] Rosa went with Barrett to Kiedis did you
[1:45:38] believe that God has to rebuke this
[1:45:40] prideful man he wants the honor but she
[1:45:43] says I'll go but you have to understand
[1:45:46] this thing for your honor God's actually
[1:45:48] gonna honor a woman through this battle
[1:45:50] and who was it's Jael so if you read
[1:45:55] later on the chapter let's just jump
[1:45:58] ahead a little bit
[1:46:00] now everything falls exactly in line
[1:46:03] with what God told Barrack through
[1:46:05] Deborah
[1:46:09] at 13 and Cicero gathered together all
[1:46:11] his chariots even 900 charity satire and
[1:46:13] all the people that were with him they
[1:46:14] went to the river kashan now look at
[1:46:17] verse 14 here's where he's waiting the
[1:46:19] whole time what do we do sister when do
[1:46:21] we move when we move look at verse 14
[1:46:24] and Deborah send a barrack up for this
[1:46:27] is the day in which the Lord had
[1:46:29] delivered Sisera into thine hand is not
[1:46:32] the Lord gone out before thee though
[1:46:34] Barrack went down from Mount Tabor and
[1:46:36] ten thousand men after him he's waiting
[1:46:40] the whole time what's the Prophet gonna
[1:46:41] say what's the what's what's the
[1:46:43] anointed prophets is gonna say praise
[1:46:45] God he waits on the Word of God prays
[1:46:49] out what a lesson amen church this ain't
[1:46:52] the first time God gave a word through a
[1:46:53] woman remember Sarah told Abraham get
[1:46:56] rid of Hagar and Ishmael Abraham's like
[1:46:59] I don't know about that he went into
[1:47:00] prayer and God said hearken unto the
[1:47:02] voice of your wife don't fear to put
[1:47:06] away Hagar and Ishmael as Abraham says
[1:47:08] alright Lord praise God see this ain't
[1:47:11] the only time and Barak was respectful
[1:47:15] to that woman and she told him exactly
[1:47:18] this day this scripture is gonna be
[1:47:20] fulfilled praise God hallelujah she
[1:47:25] waited on the anointed gift of God to
[1:47:27] tell her or to tell him when do I act
[1:47:30] when do I get the victory he waited for
[1:47:32] the church to tell him when and he got
[1:47:36] the victory and she has to say again
[1:47:39] didn't the Lord go before thee in other
[1:47:40] words then didn't you see the Lord
[1:47:42] prophesy all this haven't you seen just
[1:47:45] exactly what I told you look there they
[1:47:46] are 900 of them Church 900 900 charity
[1:47:51] of iron how many in Israel have zero
[1:47:55] because this was the iron age this is
[1:47:58] the Iron Age and Bronze Age these these
[1:48:01] countries had way more technology than
[1:48:04] Israel and they're all nervous because
[1:48:06] there was 900 ayran chariots against
[1:48:09] none of theirs but they went out with
[1:48:11] thus saith the Lord that all encourage
[1:48:13] us church amen
[1:48:14] no matter your enemy no matter the trial
[1:48:16] you face you've got the word of the Lord
[1:48:19] praise God no matter what technologies
[1:48:22] might be against
[1:48:23] we've got the save the Lord and if God
[1:48:25] is for us who can be against us 900 iron
[1:48:29] charts and nothing except a woman
[1:48:33] directing this man oh here it is
[1:48:39] God always also shouldn't say like that
[1:48:42] God often uses the weak he lifts up the
[1:48:46] weak to do great things God will use the
[1:48:50] week to deliver other people because his
[1:48:54] strength is made perfect in weakness oh
[1:48:59] it's beautiful
[1:49:00] look at verse 15 and the Lord
[1:49:02] discomforted cesira and all his chariots
[1:49:05] and all the hosts in the edge of the
[1:49:06] sword before Barrack that sister
[1:49:08] alighted down on his chariot and fled
[1:49:09] away off his feet now the rest of this
[1:49:12] chapter church is this Sisera he was the
[1:49:15] leader he ran away and then a woman
[1:49:18] named Jo said oh oh you're tired come
[1:49:21] into my house he's like give me some
[1:49:22] water
[1:49:23] she's like I'll give you some milk she
[1:49:26] said fear not come into my house she
[1:49:29] lied to him just like Rahab lied to
[1:49:32] those soldiers said no I haven't seen
[1:49:34] any or the spies went that way and
[1:49:36] they're hiding up there God honored a
[1:49:39] lie because they didn't have the Holy
[1:49:42] Ghost in those days and while he's
[1:49:44] sleeping she takes a hammer a nail and
[1:49:46] it's really descriptive I read I heard
[1:49:48] it this morning I just cringe like what
[1:49:50] and then she took a sword and finish the
[1:49:52] job
[1:49:53] after a nail went through the temples a
[1:49:56] nail went through the temples and then
[1:49:58] she took a sword and finish the job and
[1:50:02] the Bible said God subdued on that day
[1:50:04] Jabin the king of Canaan before the
[1:50:07] children of Israel and that was the
[1:50:09] fulfillment of what Deborah had said
[1:50:11] Deborah had said barek it's not you the
[1:50:13] one that's gonna get the honor
[1:50:15] it's Jael a woman's gonna get the honor
[1:50:17] because you know church in those days to
[1:50:20] be defeated by a woman if you're a man
[1:50:22] that's the greatest lack that's the
[1:50:24] greatest disrespect you could have right
[1:50:27] you're a man and you get defeated by a
[1:50:29] woman so God he humbles us the sister of
[1:50:33] this evil ruler he brings him down and
[1:50:37] and deceives him and causes this woman
[1:50:40] to end his life and God exhaust this
[1:50:43] woman to honor Jael you know what the
[1:50:46] Bible said the Bible said that she had
[1:50:50] great honor where's that scripture I'd
[1:50:54] like to see it real quick because the
[1:50:57] Bible said she deserved great honor
[1:50:59] yeah it's verse go to chapter 5 verse 24
[1:51:03] the Bible said blessed above all woman
[1:51:06] shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kay
[1:51:09] night lesson shall she be above women in
[1:51:13] the tent how come
[1:51:16] Catholics don't pray to Jael like they
[1:51:19] do Mary right they say mayor they say
[1:51:23] they do their prayer beads and say Mary
[1:51:25] Mother of grace highly exalted about
[1:51:27] above vow of all women what about her
[1:51:30] see like that demon contradicts itself
[1:51:33] they say Mary's above all women what
[1:51:35] about her she's above all women she'd be
[1:51:38] exalted you see how that's wrong see how
[1:51:42] it's just this the wrong spirit there
[1:51:43] they don't even got it right now let's
[1:51:50] close I know I said that 20 minutes ago
[1:51:53] but I'll try to finish chapter 5 is
[1:51:56] Deborah singing a song and all the
[1:51:59] people are worshipping God because God
[1:52:01] has delivered them after 20 years of
[1:52:04] slavery and bondage and then habitants
[1:52:06] couldn't even hardly walk on the streets
[1:52:08] without the soldiers their God delivers
[1:52:10] them by women praise God God delivers
[1:52:13] them by Deborah and Jael God had to
[1:52:18] remind Barrack you're not gonna get all
[1:52:19] the glory
[1:52:22] look at verse 2 here's where Deborah is
[1:52:25] so humble she praises God for the
[1:52:27] willingness of the people verse 2 crazy
[1:52:32] the Lord for the willing or the avenging
[1:52:34] of Israel when the people willingly
[1:52:36] offer themselves but look how humble
[1:52:39] this is church the people wouldn't go
[1:52:43] out without her every see that she's
[1:52:49] there
[1:52:49] you got thank you Lord for these willing
[1:52:51] people but none of them would have went
[1:52:53] been willing if she had not got thus
[1:52:55] saith the Lord that's when you'll find a
[1:52:59] real leader right that's when you find a
[1:53:00] real child of God God mighty use them in
[1:53:04] a mighty way but they'll give other
[1:53:06] people credit hey man
[1:53:09] praise God she didn't Pat herself on the
[1:53:13] back she said thank you Lord for willing
[1:53:16] soldiers that would fight for your great
[1:53:19] name look at verse 4 Lord when that went
[1:53:27] us out of Seir when thou marches on the
[1:53:29] field of Edom the earth temple were
[1:53:31] trembled and the heavens dropped and the
[1:53:33] clouds also dropped water the mountains
[1:53:35] melted from the before the Lord even the
[1:53:38] Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel
[1:53:40] she sing in church and she said that God
[1:53:42] walked before their armies God was going
[1:53:46] before them God goes before you and I
[1:53:48] praise God when we go to battle
[1:53:51] something we gotta say God go before us
[1:53:53] and then she's in her song she says it
[1:53:55] was God that was walking on that
[1:53:57] battlefield God was gonna drive them
[1:53:59] back praise God God fights for his
[1:54:02] people you know that saying by the
[1:54:06] rainbow he said he said God he said
[1:54:07] watch if you don't if you don't know God
[1:54:09] he's mighty in battle you just watch him
[1:54:12] when he goes to fightin Church that's
[1:54:15] what we should see God moving is in the
[1:54:17] midst of the battle as long as we
[1:54:19] worship Him as long as we obey Him as
[1:54:21] long as we put him first oh I love this
[1:54:27] and then verse 6 and 7 in the days of
[1:54:31] Shamgar the son of a method the days of
[1:54:32] Jael the highways were unoccupied and
[1:54:34] the travelers walked through byways that
[1:54:36] sounds like the day the streets are
[1:54:38] unoccupied because everybody's
[1:54:39] quarantined Debra's saying that's how it
[1:54:42] was where is everybody everybody's
[1:54:44] unoccupied verse 7 then the inhabitants
[1:54:48] of the villages ceased they ceased in
[1:54:50] Israel until I Deborah arose and I arose
[1:54:54] a mother in Israel you know what is
[1:54:57] really to that time they needed a mother
[1:55:00] they needed someone to care for
[1:55:03] amen they need someone to love them they
[1:55:06] need someone to give them wisdom and
[1:55:08] discern them and God couldn't find
[1:55:10] anybody else so God raise them up a
[1:55:12] mother prays God hey man you know
[1:55:16] America needed the church a mother I
[1:55:18] don't know you know you know what the
[1:55:22] armies of Israel needed a mother they
[1:55:25] need someone to instruct them someone to
[1:55:28] give them the wisdom someone to tell
[1:55:29] them exactly what they must do is that
[1:55:32] what you mothers do you tell your
[1:55:34] children with your hands brush your
[1:55:35] teeth you tell them everything they need
[1:55:37] that's what Israel needed they needed a
[1:55:38] mother and so God gave them one praise
[1:55:41] God
[1:55:41] Church God will give you what you need
[1:55:43] praise God God had to raise up a godly
[1:55:48] woman like Deborah this is what is
[1:55:50] renewed and no one else is there notice
[1:55:52] she said they were willing all those men
[1:55:54] who were willing after I got thus saith
[1:55:56] the Lord
[1:55:56] so she was willing first to get the word
[1:55:59] of Lord be devoted to God and when God
[1:56:02] raised her up and everybody else
[1:56:04] followed her this woman look at verse 20
[1:56:11] this is so beautiful
[1:56:12] 20 this this song gives us more of the
[1:56:15] details of the battle they fought from
[1:56:18] heaven the stars in their courses fought
[1:56:21] against Sisera the river of Kashan swept
[1:56:27] them away that ancient river the river
[1:56:29] Kashan oh my soul thou has trodden down
[1:56:31] strength so God calls them to the river
[1:56:34] and it doesn't tell us in the previous
[1:56:36] chapter when the song God tells us God
[1:56:38] calls all these chairs with a man right
[1:56:41] to the river and then he causes the
[1:56:43] Stars and the moon and the earth to
[1:56:45] cause such an overflow of water that the
[1:56:48] water flows out and stops all those
[1:56:51] chariots right in the mud what good is a
[1:56:53] chariot if it's all stopped up in the
[1:56:55] mud it's a chariot too hard for the Lord
[1:56:59] no he said I'll fight for you I'll use
[1:57:02] all heaven and all nature I'll use the
[1:57:04] moon I use the Stars I'll use the rivers
[1:57:07] I'll use everything to protect my God
[1:57:09] fearing people praise God hey man
[1:57:11] he said I'll move heaven and earth I'll
[1:57:13] come down from heaven myself
[1:57:15] before them and I'll call for the rivers
[1:57:18] to bring forth waters to stop your
[1:57:20] enemies because you're my people and
[1:57:22] I've set my love upon you praise God
[1:57:25] amen let's stand to our feet praise God
[1:57:27] the rivers overflowed and God uses
[1:57:31] nature to defeat nine hundred chariots
[1:57:35] the Bible said in verse 23 the angels of
[1:57:38] God cursed the enemies sure didn't look
[1:57:43] like it right nine hundred chariots
[1:57:45] against ten thousand just little armed
[1:57:49] Israelites look like Israel was cursed
[1:57:51] but the angels had the authority of God
[1:57:55] to curse the enemy and God said the
[1:58:00] reason they're cursed they didn't help
[1:58:01] Israel beforehand George this is why God
[1:58:05] saves anyone who will help a Holy Ghost
[1:58:07] field Christian the reason Cicerone them
[1:58:12] lost is because their their previous
[1:58:15] descendant or previous family members
[1:58:18] had mistreated Israel verse 40 I'm sorry
[1:58:29] verse 31 so let all Israel let all thine
[1:58:32] enemies perish Oh Lord but let them that
[1:58:34] love him be as a son when he goeth forth
[1:58:37] in his might and the land had rest for
[1:58:42] forty years
[1:58:44] what did Israel need is Baxton and
[1:58:47] condition it needed a mother to instruct
[1:58:49] them and if they listened that mother
[1:58:54] church they're gonna have 40 years of
[1:58:56] victory 40 a whole generation see you
[1:59:00] mother's see what you're doing you are
[1:59:02] shaping the next generation proved it
[1:59:05] right here if you just faithfully
[1:59:11] discern the truth and give your children
[1:59:13] the Word of God tell them the truth it
[1:59:15] will bless the next generation let's
[1:59:19] have the musicians come here please
[1:59:25] remember God or the RAM said God will
[1:59:28] probably save Nicodemus and gamellia
[1:59:31] Nicodemus didn't even go I mean he he
[1:59:34] went to Jesus by night right you know he
[1:59:36] wasn't he wasn't just coming out and
[1:59:37] support them but because he was good to
[1:59:39] Jesus Khmer I never joined the Christian
[1:59:42] group he was a Jewish teacher he just
[1:59:45] said don't persecute Christians you
[1:59:47] might that might be God but Ram said
[1:59:50] perhaps God will save Camellia all
[1:59:53] because he just didn't you didn't
[1:59:55] support persecuting Christians Oh Church
[1:59:58] God is so merciful how many how many
[2:00:03] want his mercy oh my I want his mercy
[2:00:09] for me my family I want it for anyone
[2:00:12] anyone no matter no matter how much they
[2:00:15] can receive how much revelation they can
[2:00:17] receive I want to see them receive God's
[2:00:18] mercy now to see our mothers continue
[2:00:22] doing the wonderful job they're doing
[2:00:24] train those children teach them the Word
[2:00:27] of God teach them to judge right from
[2:00:29] wrong because you will shape the next
[2:00:32] generation
[2:00:34] praise God let's bow our heads here
[2:00:43] Israel needed a mother so God rose one
[2:00:46] up the Bible said the Holy Spirit
[2:00:49] searches the earth looking for somebody
[2:00:51] that will fear the Lord search I wonder
[2:01:04] how many of you would say Lord you speed
[2:01:06] today I may not fit the perfect
[2:01:11] requirements I I know I'm not perfect
[2:01:14] but I want to be used I want you to race
[2:01:16] to be up a news search my hands up to
[2:01:20] let me pray for you
[2:01:22] how many bother you see our hands Lord
[2:01:25] God or we always want to obey the word
[2:01:29] we're asking Lord that you would raise
[2:01:32] us up and do what you've called us to do
[2:01:35] no doubt we've we've heard your word our
[2:01:39] God if there's more for us to do Lord
[2:01:42] God raised us up for raise of this
[2:01:45] mighty woman of me you gave her gift she
[2:01:50] was willing to be used by God you can
[2:01:55] only use the lily bass so hallelujah you
[2:01:58] can't use someone that's not willing God
[2:02:01] help us to be willing and set aside for
[2:02:03] service as it's non the example shows
[2:02:12] Lord some of us to do a better job some
[2:02:20] of us just need to start doing something
