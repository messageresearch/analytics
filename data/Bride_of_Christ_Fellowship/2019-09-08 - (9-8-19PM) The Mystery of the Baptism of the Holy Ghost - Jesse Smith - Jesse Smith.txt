sir keep praying buddy I really appreciate that let's pray I thought he shared out with me a lot let's pray for his family and he and I were praying before service for his uncle in a nursing home and

and I see got throughout the whole trip and then I came back and I was like really happy and that last week there is some special meeting and then then that's when it hit me why I went for those trip because that was preparing my heart so I can hear from him for last weekend so it's been a glorious weeks so it was gay and and the second testimony was like Marco Lucia sister Sarah go Lucia is dead she sent out attacks like I think they're sale Friday saying that her debt went in you know for like a cancer treatment on Tuesday when she went like he went in again Thursday or Friday to do another checkup the doctor asked him what did you do and he was like what do you mean by what did I do apparently the cancer has strength like 50% since like you know the Tuesday so just within a few days it was like drop over half the size so it was like yeah she was sending out a testimony and really praising God for that so amen that's good who told the son where do you stand in the morning and who told the ocean you can only come this far and who shouldn't move where to hide till evening her swoon alone I know my redeemer lives I know my redeemer lives let all creation testify let this live with him he cried my bro my redeemer very soon that's been things who runs to the rearing the one hand away and the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken he come to bring me Victor I know my redeemer thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah on the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's just gonna be a real simple message so let's just open up and then at the end I'll share some testimonies from the meetings last weekend so if you would let's go to just Colossians chapter 1 very familiar scripture for us about the mystery of the Baptist and Holy Ghost Colossians 1:25 so I basically just want to show tonight some quotes from brother Branham about the new birth and the baptism and then Lord willing it hope it'll be a blessing and help everybody to understand it by God's grace it's quite it can be quite confusing so it was a good question I was very happy for the question and I don't know if I've ever preached it before as a separate sermon so I'm glad it was asked to me and then I would like to just give a really clear answer if I can tonight cautions 125 so as you're turning there the the short answer is that before the seals brother branham called him he called a new birth and the baptism two separate things after the seals it was all one in the same so I just want to show a few quotes so the people so everybody can understand that and then that clears up any confusion about that you find that with a lot of doctrines you know before the seals brother Branham may have had a different idea or a different thought but then after the seals it gets cleared up so we thank the Lord for progressive revelation and that in itself proves that God was revealing things because the Bible said he does nothing except he reveals a secret to his servant the Prophet right so if nothing else it proves that that brother Branham had to grow in his understanding as God revealed it to him so Colossians 1:25 where of I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you see his ministry was for them to fulfill the Word of God let's read verse 26 together one two three even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now has made manifest to his Saints and I'll read 27 just myself to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory let's just have one word of prayer and ask the Lord to help us and I hope this is okay for tonight I just thought I'd lay it in there and I thought well if one person had a question maybe more people had questions I just want to get this covered here Heavenly Father we bow our heads Lord to you great eternal one living God living spirit oh god the only true God we just bow to you we love you Lord we love to sing your songs we want to love you more serve you more I don't do all those things Lord as we sang about know you more I Lou your worship you more help us here tonight lord help me to get out of your way Lord I may just speak and help the people Lord here tonight and we thank you for the word of God this morning and the songs we could sing this morning and tonight just continue to feed us here with your word in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you'd be in situ praise God you know water sister this one's not open you need it that's alright just been sitting there I think someone gave it to all the preachers and I never used it so that's uh let's look here tonight I do have some quotes Lydia I'm gonna uh I just want to answer that question it's a really good question I got it on Monday I'm just calling it the mystery of the baptism like oh it's just real simple thought here I'm just gonna start off with this you know this is a picture that Ron malabo did from the Philippines he's in his 50s now but he's been a really faithful message preacher for about 30 years and so he shows us before the seals you know even before the seals brother Branham taught that you know the spirit was the innermost part and then the soul was like the next outer part in the body but after the seals brother Branham did have it he did switch it and correct it so this had a lot to do with you know how brother Branham would call the new birth and the baptism different things and this is another example of how God straightened him out on it and it it's just it's so wonderful to see how God can correct a man and brother BAM never went back and said I'm sorry and I apologize now if I make a mistake and I'm here all the time I won't apologize to you if I make a mistake okay but he was traveling so much you know God was giving him so many different great revelations let me go pull this up just it's on my mind so I don't forget here's the quote where brother Branham said he was like a jellyfish this is from 56 a secondhand robe sometimes I look at myself and I think I've been such a jellyfish in my life I've waited and missed many thousands of souls into the kingdom because I've weighed and said God depended too much on a spear this morning he was leaning too heavily on the gift remember he was leaning so heavily on it that he said I challenge he said bring the most challenging cases up here and let's pray for them first so brother BAM he kind of got in trouble with the angel for that too he was promising them every miracle he said bring the heart miracles and the angel told him Jesus never did that now Church look at this he missed many souls but listen at the same time if those souls were predestined to salvation they would have got at some other time right so is that you know brother Branham can't be a son of God and then be guilty of missing souls to hell like he can't be because there's no condemnation that are in Christ Jesus so maybe he misses opportunity but God would send another opportunity those souls to see that's how we have to understand it because we're not going to get to heaven and God's gonna say now look you failed hear hear hear hear hear the Bible said he's placed your sins in the sea of forgetfulness he forgot all about it and then Jesus promises all that the father's giving me will come so church that's something we need to remember too even if we miss witnessing or even minute if we miss you know reaching out to somebody God will be merciful and if that person is meant to be saved God is gonna save them likes I ever tell you this remember when I prayed for my friend's dad who had a stroke and was in the hospital member that and I spoke the word in the clause and I said Lord if you raise this man up in the name of Jesus Christ I said I speak to that ever was I said I will witness the message to him well God healed him and I've I called him up and I said can I tell you about the message and I start tell him about it he said well how did William Branham die and I told him William Branham died in a car accident by drunk drivers and the man said I asked God to forgive him but he said well I guess he didn't see God's vision that Diggs I was telling him how God came brother man visions and church it just deflated me I was instantly like and I felt like I failed the Lord and then he want to talk about other things you know and I was trying I fulfill my vow to God I brought the message and I said God has restored through a prophet and God gave me visions all the time I said God saw or gave him the vision of rock and roll but when it came to that question he turned it down and it made me feel like a failure but the thing is I tried I really tried with all of my heart and so I want you to see that too that even I try I promise to God I'll do something I'll do it but then even when I do it like if that person is not predestiny to be bribed they're not going to receive it instead of instead of being encouraged by William Branham they criticize William Branham well how come you didn't criticize William Branham when you finally believed see because you were a predestinated seed you were ordained of God right and God knew that so I just want to share with you that I can understand this sometimes I and I was so deflated I well I'm almost cried I was so sad on the phone I'm like man I made all this extra time to call him and you don't need a just once they kind of make fun of brother Branham you know but he said I've missed many thousands souls cuz I waited and depended too much on a gift I said Lord if you will just show me if you're just giving me a vision what to do and God gives a vision then I'll turn around and let somebody talk me into something else yeah I mean the closest we can get to that is seeing a dream like God could give us a dream and we could see what God wants us to do and then not do it that's the closest we could understand but here God shows him a vision and he turns it down he lets somebody talk him out of the vision praise God I just want to encourage you with that as we looked at gifts are important right we must be faithful with them but even when we fail in them what does God even when we depend too much on and what's God gonna do he's gonna straighten us out down the road now most of us is probably not like this we don't pray we probably don't to depend too much on gifts is probably that we don't use them enough right because we're not praying as much as we need to at times but you know God is merciful to us he'll guide us along but I just want to encourage you with this that he felt like a jellyfish God could show people of certain things and they still won't do it and so we can relate to that right so I can relate to a man like this that's why I love about brother Branham I can't relate he's a man he struggled but he also got victory at times - amen so I want to show that to you that I hope that was a blessing I there's numerous quotes like that where he says I'm ashamed of my faith I should have mountain-moving faith he says but I don't and pray for me you know yeah there's numerous quotes I found on that lately now I just want to show you the confusing there the confusion about some of the quotes there's six quotes like this where Ram said the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this was in 62 now look all the way up right before 63 I'll just read the whole thing remember I believe Martin Luther had the Holy Spirit absolutely maybe not in the portion is today because it wasn't given out we've been through that you people the tabernacle here on the blackboard but he did believe to God and he that believeth has everlasting life I never thought there was a person believed like this till I hurt till this morning I heard Charles fuller as I was going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is being born the Holy Ghost is the baptism all right so this is the one that this is their six quotes like this where it makes it seem like well what is the baptism if it's not the new birth what is it so there's six that say this and they're from 1957 to 1962 let me just drop a little bomb on your on your heads here - because it was a bomb dropped on my head did you know brother I am called the Holy Spirit the third person the Trinity all the way up to 1962 look up look type in third person of the Trinity brother Branham call of the Holy Spirit the third person of the Trinity all the way up till right before he preached the church I'm sorry 1960 right before the church ages and then God showed him right before the church ages that he wasn't three he remember that mission where the three rainbows became one God showed in my vision and then he comes to the church ages and he says God's not three persons we see as divinity in Revelation chapter one he said it's one God in three offices just think about that from and I found quotes from 1951 to 1960s over nine years he said three person third person Trinity second verse of the Trinity see he was growing in grace and knowledge of the Lord see and then the next year 1961 he says thus saith the Lord trinitarianism is of the devil he said about its time he said those people can still be saved but it's time that they're sincerely wrong and we got to tell him in that striking see they can go see him so these things like this they never stumble me because I realize brother Branham is not the absolute if brother Branham is your absolute you have some crazy try to finagle through the Bible right you got the white horse being both the Antichrist and the Holy Spirit I don't know how you're gonna pull that one off because they're totally contrary one to another then you got the new birth is different from the baptism then you got Jesus is the third person but he's the one person well you got some big problems if you make William brand the absolute but thank god he's not thank God Jesus Christ is the absolute amen so he said this about the new birth and the baptism for about you know five years now here's the revelation after the seals and like I said I just I don't want to make this too long of a study because there's not much to it once you really get down to it as far as scriptural so he received the revelation now here's here's where he says that plainly in the church age book it is stated plainly in the church age book so I don't know if I don't know how much you've read the church age book I know I preached on it a couple years ago but like I said there's it's the second greatest book outside the Bible is the church age book if you got any doctrinal questions start there and give yourself just devote yourself to read that book and that will just route route you and ground you in the love of God so when I invite those who are spirit filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want you to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized in the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the Spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one in the same so see Pentecostal people thought well here's what he says Pentecostal people yeah I thought they were saved and then believed to speak in tongues that's what they were thinking right they thought okay now we got to give him to speak in tongues and and get the baptism they got the new birth there in other words they're saved but they need to speak in tongues to have the baptism that's what the the tongues people were saying but brother I'm saying no I'm not saying that I'm saying they're saved but if they wanted the Baptist and Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the same as a new birth now the next quote this is the continuing quote what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the Spirit of God coming in and filling you after you've repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God all right so that's that's chapter four of the church age book if you want to dig into that it's a great revelation but the RAM in there says and I preached it here a couple years ago over in that sanctuary well Graham says if we want if we want the truth on the Holy Ghost we got to have thus saith the Lord and he says it's not according to me it's according to God's Word so we have we have thus saith the Lord because it's a mystery of God and where the RAM had to finish all the mysteries of God amen I'm gonna use that in the next book - by God's grace that's the next chapter I'm gonna write hopefully I'll get to that this week all right now here's another one yeah now here this is after the seals right this is five months after the seals in paradox and now he's using new birth and baptism interchangeably so something happened the but when Robyn was right when he said it became a new Bible God took the seals off I mean he took now it's made clear now we know God's one person now we know what the bats Holy Ghost is now we know tongues isn't evidence amen although he never believed that you know but it wasn't something separate you know it wasn't wasn't required you know so here we see I believe each one of you Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran that has never had experience the baptism Holy Spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the batson Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox see how it's one of the same the baptism the new birth and the baptism Holy Ghost all the same thing here he says it plainly as well in the token at the end of the year when God gave you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and everything lotion we'll have to admit that to be yes sir it's the new birth you're born the new of the Holy Ghost and because that God has did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what God has did then he seals you and it was Kingdom by the Holy Spirit now that's clear yeah baptism new birth seal that's all the same thing amen praise God now see now the way God showed this to me was that God showed me there's only three parts to a person so the seal has to be on one of those three parts right so we have the body spirit and soul so it's got to be on one of those there's only three parts and just I'm just it's just the process of elimination the Holy Ghost cannot seal the flesh because anybody can impersonate the flesh you can put a seal or you can put a stamp on your body and anybody can do that but the Bible says in second is 4:16 the inward man is renewed day by day now that means that means it gets old and has to be made new every single day but the Bible says the seal is unto the day of redemption so if it so it can't be in the mind because the mind worried needs renewed every day and the Bible says the soul that sinneth it shall die so the one who doesn't receive Christ in the soul and rejects life in the soul that's the one that's separated from God so it has to be the soul so the seal of God the Bible doesn't say the seals in the soul but Jesus did say I'll give you the rest unto your souls how many number that so see it has to be in one of those that's why I keep going back to here Jesus said I'll give you rest in your soul see they David could get in the spirit he could prophesy right we'll get to that and they all can feel the anointing on the body Balaam felt that Balaam felt it in his mind but the soul is what God wanted to fill but he couldn't do it until all the sin was clearly purged and paid for on the cross praise God now see brother Brahim had a progressive revelation I didn't get to this but I wanted to show Abraham had this too and then like with Sarah Sarah Sarah wasn't even connected to the promise till God came and told Abraham about it change your name to Sarah from Sarah Siri I so I want to show that you know that's that was just my notes I think is a chance to get there but maybe next time by God's grace so the true revelation I already read that I just said copy the church age book portion it's one of the same brother branham caused it the capstone revelation so I read through that to you earlier he said the new birth the baptism is all it's one in the same it's all the same thing okay Paul calls in the mystery hid from the ages we read that earlier this mystery was hid she was hid from the Old Testament the fact that the fact that God was going to send a new birth in the soul of man that was hid it was like a hidden power praise God amen it's like this hidden I don't know it's like a hidden channel it's like it's like the whole time David knew he had another level he could get up to but he could never quite get there right Peter had a he always felt I could have a higher level I could go to but he couldn't get it until you went to Pentecost amen oh yeah he had all this zeal and all this desire but he could never get that power until he went to the day of Pentecost amen and that's what Jesus did for us Paul said God made known the mystery Christ in you the hope of glory now look at this in this beautiful he said in you Christ in you no look at this the same words in you is when Jesus talking about the comforter and I'll pray the father and he shall give you another comforter he may would buy with you how long forever forever he'll buy with you forever he says even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and that beautiful the Bible use the same words Christ in you and Jesus says the comforter in you praise God amen see deeper than the mind deeper than the human spirit it's got to go deeper than that and that's because our human spirit is just open it's like an open it's like an open lid right and that's our minds it's always open Satan can come up here and try to pour things in right even during service you can try to pour things in our mind Kenny I better not said there cuz it's gonna spill but Satan can come around and he can he can pour anything like that in our human spirit it's always open all right we got to be careful it gets into our minds but our soul is sealed so I can't put it on there by the one hand but you under the picture our soul with all would be sealed the cat would be snapped on there and it could be heated on there it could be sealed on there and then Satan sealed out unbelievers sealed out and faith is sealed in the presence of God there the life of God is sealed in the Bible also calls it quick and it gives us an example of a seed quicken it's made alive it's not in seed form anymore now it's in their life or now it's in the form of a growth amen now it's a growing living thing it's not just dormant it's alive its quickened and that's what the Holy Ghost is in you and I amen the spirit of truth amen the spirit of truth see and green not always beard of God whereby you're sealed unto that means until in the Greek you're sealed in until the day of redemption so there's no I I need a new baptism in my soul I need to refilling the Holy Ghost of my soul there's nothing for that how to tell people that at Albion - they wanted a refilling I said well it's not gonna be in your soul alls it is it's a it's a restoration of your mind you've let your mind get too much in the things to the world and you're not fervent the Bible said we must be fervent in our spirits see we got to be boiling and our thoughts always got to stay on the things of God but Satan tries to cool off our boiler right he tries to turn down your fire on your stove so you don't boil for Christ's right you're not thinking about Christ all week you're not excited about we're not excited about the things of God he tries to turn off your fire but you got to keep the fire burning in your mind constantly I've seen it many times constantly meditate on the things of God don't we have to do that hallelujah see we got to be fervent in our minds and I want to let me just share this example you know I like YouTube you know we have a ministry on YouTube and I get a lot of good stuff off YouTube I'm really inspired by preachers on YouTube I really enjoy it it's a good way for me to feed on other things like when I'm not listening brother branham but there's been times I've got just tired of my flesh and I've caught myself on YouTube I'm just scrolling scrolling I'm just scrolling because when it comes down to it nothing those things can really never satisfy right and then it's striking I'll put on a sermon to brother Brandon and my spear just lifts like that like I mean good things learn about computers learn about how morning routine how to exercise I mean good things I'm trying to do good things but I realize after a while it doesn't give life but honestly as soon as I soon as I turn brother Brandon I can feel my spirit reignited and I found that YouTube can't give that I mean lost it's up serve a really anointed sermon you know what I mean so all and what I'm saying is that good things doesn't renew your mind when you're trying to I'm trying to make a better how do I invest better how do I do this or how do I save or what should I which car should I buy next you know whatever those things are good but they will never satisfy our minds have to be on fire with the things of God and that's why I've seen that renewing the renewing in the spirit of your mind I couldn't get back to I guess I must have passed it too far it's the renewing in your spirit of mine I've seen that the things of the world that they don't fulfill they dumb satisfy only the Word of God satisfies so if you need a refilling in your spirit then you got to go devote all your attention to listening to the Word of God and singing worshiping praising God listening brother Branham and then you'll see that because that's how I see it - I see it just read Knights my fire praise God because we all get tired we all we all get like jellyfish sometime don't we write in our minds now I want to go back here now I'm going to show you something that's I hope you understand this I really hope you understand this guy I don't want to confuse anybody but when I want to show you that the baptism Holy Ghost is such a mystery that there was even hid from the writers of the lexicon ok so what I mean by that is that the words filled and baptized can be used interchangeably so in other words you won't get the revelation by going to the Greek now you can for some things like member and more phase ever everyone remember in more faith God changes masks right and bran uses the Greek word and more faith now that's beautiful gives a revelation that God it wasn't a second person in Christ but the first person the only person he just changes masks right in more faith so we can get the revelation from the lexicon there but when it comes to the baptism the Holy Ghost you can't get it from the lexicon let me show it to you i i'ma show you sure why because the Greek words for filled and baptized doesn't work every time okay so I'm trying to make this plain I don't want to confuse your church I hope I hope I'm not and if you have questions just please text me or email me or talk to me afterwards okay here's what I mean for he John the Baptist shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb how many knew that he was filled with the Holy Ghost in the mother's womb but not in the soul because that couldn't be given yet because Jesus was not glorified yet in other words that little baby already it's minor spirit was anointed with the things of God I'll explain that but hey there's nothing too hard for our God I just said like that there is nothing too difficult for the Lord see when God's got a child and he's gonna use that child for a special purpose God can even fill their minds with the Holy Ghost even before they can talk that's that's the Word of God Church it's hard to explain that's the Word of God now here's what I mean - later on the same chapter it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the citation of Mary the babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost so John the Baptist hears the name Jesus and his mind is so anointed that he leaps and he starts to rejoice and just to hear the name of Jesus now what should we do if we hear the name of Jesus we should say glory right if a baby's got the anointing on its mind and can leap at the name of Jesus we should be excited too about the name of Jesus what see Elizabeth now gets filled but I like this look she spoke with a loud voice see because the Holy Ghost brings boldness but member this is only in the human spirit because Jesus has not yet died all those Saints are still in the heart of the earth and Satan has got kept them in bondage they're still captives right oh but he's gonna lead captivity captive into his will hey man all right I'm almost done I'm not going to too long so see the word failed and the Greek means to be filled up right she was filled John the Baptist was filled in this human spirit and so was Elizabeth now baptized in the Holy Ghost in acts 1:5 jesus said I'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost it means baptize now look this word though does is a little different but it's also interchangeable I hope I can explain now this is the lexicon the word baptize means to overwhelm not to be confused with another word bapto the clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is a text from the greek poet and physician nic and ER we lived about 200 BC it's a recipe for making pickles so did you ever think pickles would help you understand the baptism holy ghost my wife might be able to cuz she's made pickles but I don't think I watched her so honey have to explain it to me later so pickles can help you understand the baptism the Holy Ghost it's helpful because it uses both words Nicator says that in order to make a pickle the vegetable should first be dipped or bapto into boiling water but then baptized in the vinegar solution both verbs contain the immersing of vegetables in a solution but the first is temporary the second act of baptizing the vegetable produces a permanent change is that right honey does that is that the same as your experience okay but there's other ways right there you go all right well thank you she's she's made some good pickles too I know there's some jars in there I still got to eat honey so remind me when we get home I need to eat those jars I forget to eat those pickles I like pickles when uses the New Testament this word more often refers to our union so the word baptized refers to our union and identification with Christ then to our water baptism mark 16:16 he that believes in baptized shall be saved Christ is saying that mere intellectual assent is not enough there must be a union with him a real change like the vegetable to the pickle right so pickle when it's change is fully changed it's not going back to vegetable right it's gonna stay a pickle so that's the point from the Greek word from the lexicon but here Church here's where this is the same Greek word so the word filled is the same word fill now listen if you know the Bible were they filled in the spear or soul in acts 2:4 soul this is soul see they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance okay so the same greek word here for elizabeth being filled before the cross is the same greek word here that's why I said that this mystery was so great it was hid from the lexicon writers it was so great it was hid from brother Branham until 1963 but then God showed it to him and then he preached it faithfully the rest of his ministry so see it's the same Greek word for filled she was filled now they're filled so the mysteries hidden from a lexicon authors as well the lexicon is not the absolute God's revelation is the absolute right the revelation of the word is the absolute like someone might say well no brother just the words the absolute Matthew 28:19 we should baptize father son Holy Ghost that's the absolute well no it's the revelation of Matthew 28:19 right so see it's the revelation of the Word of God that's the absolute now I don't I don't I'm not gonna get technical with with us with that but I would if somebody gave me that argument right because we when I say the revelation is the word you understand that right you understand I mean the revelation God gave to brother Branham of the interpretation of the Bible I'm not gonna use that with all of us cuz you know you know that but I might use it with someone who doesn't believe okay cuz I want to get too technical but at the same time this is what even Jeffersonville says this - they said it's God's revelation is more important than the written word because you know they they use the quote brother BAM said God speaks between the lines you know with Abraham and Sarah turning young again so they use that quote but they use it too far to make every word he said thus say at the Lord so it's a great it's a great battle but we're in this battle to the end praise God and when we've got God's word we can sit on every promise of God and we can defeat every foe praise the Lord it's the battle worth fighting I'm almost done here let me see okay yeah I think I go through this pretty fast now let's go to this real quick and I'll come back here this is a this is an important scripture in the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried I look he cries he Jesus was a hard preacher right he was soft at times but then he used a lot of emotion he cried out saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink I believe that's what he's saying today don't you I believe he says that through the bride cuz the spirit and the bride say come they're saying come if you're thirsty come he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified okay so see we got to take this scripture the Holy Ghost is not given but yet John the Baptist had it Elizabeth had it and even his dad Zechariah had it he got filled with the Holy Ghost but the Bible says it wasn't given yet in the soul it wasn't given in the soul yet right it was only given in the human spirit okay now with that in mind now you can go to David and the Bible said Samuel took the Horn of oil and knowing to him in the midst of his brother and the spear Lord came upon David from that day forward but not every day right especially the days when he got caught with Bathsheba so samuel rose up and went to Rhema now look the spear Lord departed from Saul so see for them it wasn't a seal until the day of redemption it would come and go come and go and the evil spirit from the Lord troubled him that doesn't mean God's evil it means God needed someone to fulfill his plan for Saul's life because God knew Saul was gonna stumble anyway so just like you did with Ahab who will go before me and deceive them you know same type of thing so I wanted to have a bitterness against Davis so God said well what do you have to go so the evil spirit from the Lord troubled saw now here's a beautiful quote if you ever wonder if what I'm teaching about John 7 is right just go to spoken words original see David said thy word have I hid in my heart that I send out against you Lord only thing he needed was the rain so see brother man recognized that David didn't have the anointing we have today David would have been alright if he could just had that rain but the Holy Ghost was it yet given see that so see David would have been alright if he could just get born again the soul but it wasn't available to him about church but it's available to us that's why when people leave the message or I've had people have to counsel about adultery and different things like that when I hear about those things I know that persons not born again because David could do that before the Holy Ghost but not after the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost seals that out of your life that's why the Holy Ghost was given to give you power over those kind of things that's right he had the word the Word was with him and he and he could know it he said I've hid it in my heart Lord I won't bloom out and act like it should I'm sorry it won't bloom out and act like I should but I've hid it there Lord I've hid there but when Jesus came which was the Word made manifest through the germ of life out of it and it brings it back to the word now and if David's grown over what are out ours to do sure without the spirit amen isn't he wonderful all right so see I'm trying I'm teaching at Wright Church I believe I am teaching it right by the grace of the Lord yeah because the david says created me a clean heart O God renew a right spirit within me so you need it renewed just like the human mind cast me not away from your presence and take not your Holy Spirit for me David knew what it was like to have the spirit taken from him praise God later on his ministry remember the Bible said Satan provoked David any number of the people and over 20,000 people died because he numbered the people Satan provoked him so see you can't have the anointing of God on you and then a Satan direct you to do something evil like that it's either one of the other right you can't have programs you don't have a black and white bird you don't have a drunk sober man if Satanists provoke David then Satan's anointing his thoughts and even Joab tried to warn me like don't number the people he's like imma do it anyway see cuz the Holy Spirit was taken from him because you know God knew that he wanted to make that sin you know he got new he wanted to do that so God has to let him do that God can't force him and do anything they says restore to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit and brother BAM always points it out he didn't say restore to the salvation he just said restore the joy of the salvation David always say right but he just lost the joy of it that's what we looked at a few weeks ago and preach on seasons sometimes we get it sometimes we lose it but we're still saved right he just lost the joy of it all right so I hope that is that helpful by God's grace nobody ever too can see that remember the Bible said the Lord departed from Samson he left him he left his spirit he left his flesh to see the Lord departed from him you remember this is one of my this is one of most powerful scriptures I've had in the last few years about Hezekiah remember he wanted to live 15 more years and God said no you should actually God let him but God said it would have been better if you just died him when I told you to set your house in order but the Bible said that God I'm sorry that Babylon sent embassadors and inquired of the wonder that was done in the land God left Hezekiah to try him that he might know all that was in his heart now the Bible said God never leaves and surfers sakes us right in Hebrews chapter 13 I believe verse 5 God will never leave us or forsake us why is that different it's different because now God gets in your soul in the Old Testament he couldn't get in your soul he could leave you but now he can't leave you because he's in your soul praise God he seals his spirit into your soul I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age now here's where he he says it again to understand what I have just said is it clear up why students have never ever found Paul saying at any time be born again and then be spirit-filled you catch that Paul never said okay get born again and now get spirit-filled he never separated them they have inferred it is there and they have put their own meanings to make us say that but scripture does not say that Jesus never said it either and then he quotes John 7:37 239 well I just read earlier the Holy Ghost could not be given because Jesus was not glorified now here says distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking by coming into Jesus in faith would have rivers of living waters pouring out of him and it places this experience at Pentecost amen almost done now today is a time of restoration by teaching this is what I preached on last Saturday morning over at Albion you know I've heard different people say we don't need teaching we don't need the mystery and we're too much on that we're too much on that the fact is you can't be too much on it if it's God's truth okay and I'll just try to show you a few quotes here brother Graham said what's to be done in the last days what's to reveal bring forth what's Malachi for to do to turn back the people from the stumbling block to break down the traditions and to reveal the bread with the Shekinah glory so the fresh bread of the word with God's glory watch it ripen and produce just exactly what it said it would do OMA the shewbread for this age to the denomination of stumbling Bock a bunch of fanatics but we who believe but now as revelation tenants promise all the mystery of God that's been in the pages down through them years would be ripens so see ripen brought forth in the age of the seventh angels message in other words the mysteries of God are the bread that we're feeding on in other words in other words you and I are in the holy place right now we're seeing the glory of the seven candlesticks and we're eating the mysteries of God in the holy place amen and then we go up in prayer and we pray and we can go in the presence of God to hear his voice but if we're not in there having that same communion you know hearing thus saith the lord of revelation then we're out here mario says were feasting all the bread the fresh ripened bread of the mysteries of God praise God what he say in Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same kind of causal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck down Paul on the road to down to Damascus amongst us today doing the same things that he did in that day uniting hey man here's the one I love he's talking about well I'll just read it this age started just after the turn of the 20th century talking about Azusa Street and it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was a Pentecost we know that there must be an assessee be a return of dynamic power the believers sent this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts to the spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain now think about all these people that are saying all we don't need the teaching we don't need the mysteries the actual rain or anointing for this day is the teaching rain so if they're saying we don't want teaching they're saying we don't want the Holy Ghost anointing for today and now watch their lives watch their hunger for the word right because the anointing for today is the teaching because the latter rain is rapturing faith and that's to come it's not here yet remember the Bible said they'll fall at the same time amen so see we're receiving the former right now but one day it'll be both former and latter rain which will be more of the same anointing I believe that's right the latter rain that is harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the Prophet messenger who has to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal father's had not yet come see if people say they don't want there's too much teaching it's because they're not being anointed with the Holy Ghost for today because the Holy Ghost is teaching us to obey the Word of God amen now here's the one I read a couple weeks ago we need to read again whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth for the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and son so see if somebody doesn't like doctrine it's because they're not born again because he who is born again he has the father and son that's the person that lives the doctrine loves the doctrine and likes teaching Amen you see that see if you don't have the doctrine you're not born you don't even have God you're not born again tell these people that say too much doctrine too much mysteries it's because they're not born again it's because they don't want instruction doctor means instruction they don't want they don't want to be instructed in other words they don't want God telling them what to do they just want to come to church think they're saved think they're going to rapture but they don't want to be told what their do by the Holy Spirit and especially not the fivefold ministry pastor don't tell me what to do what do you know well I only know what God speaks through me I don't really know nothing but if God speaking to us he's gonna speak through his word amen see so at no one can say well Oh too much doctor know when you've got the doctrine you've got Christ amen everybody see that if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him Godspeed see how important doctrine is and you got a false doctrine you don't have Jesus Christ and then don't come in don't let that person come in your house for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds now the way this works most of time is with the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses that go door to door if you're if you can't stand up against him don't let him in your house but I've let both in my house I really stood up to the Mormon I didn't really know what to say the jobless witnesses the one time because I didn't I didn't know what they were about I offered him brother Aaron Brooks but they turned it down so I vowed next time I'm not gonna let them in my house because I'll take their stuff and recycle it you know but they won't take my stuff right it's going right to the recycle bin but I'll at least flatter them see you because I want to show them I'm at least open and if I felt the presence of God I'd read that and if I didn't have those saith the Lord I'd read that but I've got thus saith the Lord I know what they believe you know I know so see now it's different I've got at least at least I'm a little bit humble to take it but they won't even take mine so I will let them in my house anymore but they haven't come to my house last time they came my wife shared about my mom being healed of cancer and they left pretty soon after that cuz they don't believe in supernatural oh where they basically believe we're in the middle millennium right now that's what they believe but I let the Mormons in and I knew where I knew right where they're going cuz I talked to them if I let those two boys sit there and I go falls I let them kind of give me their spiel just you pray about it and see if Joseph Smith is God's prophet just pray about it that's all they would say I'm like yeah right I said tell me this sir when you get the Holy Ghost they said only after baptism I said we'll open up your Bible buddy let's go to Acts chapter 10 and we read it and the Bible said Cornelius got the Holy Ghost and then Peter said go be baptized I said what do you say about that he said let me go back and ask my elders I said fine you get you you bed and I told them I remember I said if you care about my soul you'll go back talk to them and call me back and guess what they never called me back because they don't care about my soul they care about church members and money and just getting done with there maybe not money but they just care about doing their job they don't see don't even have a revelation of the Word of God right and I told him I said Joseph Smith your prophet saw two persons our prophet saw one did you know that Joseph Smith saw the father's old man and the young man Jesus and came down and revealed his mysteries to them oh that's demon power right there church that's Satan there it is Satan transforming himself as an angel of light see that proves he wasn't a prophet because the God's Word comes to the Prophet and brother man saw that vision of the three rainbows coming one and the voice Thundra doubt said Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ in the new amen he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and they never came back and they never did come back and they've never come to our house on understand but I knew I could pin him down there I kind of like that it was kind of fun to do that we're just to see if they do respond I tried to give him I think they took a church age book if I'm not mistaken but of course you know I don't know what it would happen it'll be up to them and them in God now I'm almost done the forseeable Ram said see the Antichrist refuses what the truryde doctrine but see if you got the doctrine then you've got Christ see the people that are born again are gonna preach the right doctrine the people that are not born again are not gonna preach the right doctrine they're gonna get all scuffled scrupled up with things see the Antichrist he takes his own bride oh I'm glad I'm glad I'm Jesus's bride and not Satan's bride and builds her up under a creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her denomination she gives birth to another other denomination that's quoted in his Holy Scripture pardon me gives birth to daughter she don't become she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word Amen see we're a part of the word then it okay that's it now there's any questions on that topic let me know please like I said there's six quotes that I found there might be more parameters the new birth and baptism are different things but then after the seals it's all the same thing does everybody understand okay let me record us a testimony to our live streamers loving the Lord God bless you may God direct you to good home Church in God's time and season if you're part of our church I Love You Lord bless you okay later you can pause that
