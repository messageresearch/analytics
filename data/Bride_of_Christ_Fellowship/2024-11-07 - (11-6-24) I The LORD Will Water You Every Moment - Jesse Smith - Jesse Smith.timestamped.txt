[0:00] uh Isaiah 27 tonight Isaiah
[0:06] 27 never preached this text before it
[0:08] was kind of Quicken to me while I was uh
[0:11] uh preaching on the Rapture on Sunday I
[0:14] noticed brother Brandon he quoted a
[0:16] scripture and I don't know if you
[0:17] remember it but I went and found it you
[0:19] know from Isaiah where it said I the
[0:21] Lord will water it uh and keep it day
[0:24] and night and i' I'd always wondered
[0:26] what scripture that was so let's read it
[0:28] here tonight we'll read verses 1 two and
[0:30] three it's good to see Elijah again
[0:31] tonight let's give him a round of
[0:32] applause Hallelujah God bless you
[0:35] Elijah buddy you're you're spoiling me
[0:37] brother you're spoiling me brother two
[0:39] weeks in a row man and who's this my cin
[0:43] let's give Lucas round Vol God bless you
[0:47] Lucas hallelujah praise God yeah we're
[0:51] very proud of Elijah very proud of you
[0:54] sir you know just was really something
[0:56] you know when your children start
[0:58] graduating you know it's just it's it's
[0:59] a whole different thing right Lydia it's
[1:01] a whole different thing it's just like
[1:03] wow how how did that happen so we're
[1:06] thankful for Elijah thankful for uh
[1:08] Lucas by God's grace Isaiah 27 we'll
[1:11] read verses 1 two and three I trust this
[1:13] will be a blessing to you tonight I want
[1:15] to preach on I the Lord will water you
[1:17] every moment I want to preach on that
[1:19] tonight by God's grace I never had this
[1:21] thought till just kind of was quickened
[1:23] to me actually today while I was
[1:25] studying I didn't know which way to go
[1:28] and uh the Holy Spirit kind of brought
[1:30] me back to Sunday when I finish with
[1:32] this uh scripture brother Brandon
[1:35] mentions this he mentions this scripture
[1:37] 23
[1:38] times and he never cites the scripture
[1:41] that's why I had to go back and look at
[1:43] it because I'm like what scripture is
[1:45] this Isaiah 2712 and 3 I'll read one two
[1:48] and then we'll read three together have
[1:50] another word of Prayer in that day the
[1:53] Lord with his sore and great and strong
[1:55] sword shall punish Leviathan now this is
[1:59] not speaking of the leviathon that we
[2:01] know of like the water serpent it's
[2:04] actually figurative language of Babylon
[2:07] the piercing serpent because remember
[2:09] he's called that old dragon that old
[2:11] serpent even Leviathan that crooked
[2:14] Serpent and he shall slay the dragon
[2:17] that is in the sea remember this is the
[2:20] days of Isaiah this is 800 or 900 years
[2:22] before
[2:24] Christ verse two in that day sing ye
[2:27] unto her a Vineyard of red wine so
[2:32] singing of course to Israel now let's
[2:36] read verse three ready 1 2 3 I the Lord
[2:39] do keep it I will water it every moment
[2:43] lest any hurt it I will keep it night
[2:47] and day may God add blessing to ring his
[2:49] word you can be seated there yeah I
[2:51] guess we'll just get right to the
[2:52] preaching here by God's
[2:54] grace Hallelujah so I want to preach on
[2:57] this here just for about an hour by
[2:58] God's grace
[3:00] anyone that knows me knows hour is
[3:02] pretty short sermon so we would like to
[3:05] look at this I the Lord will water you
[3:07] every
[3:08] moment this was an extremely uh strange
[3:12] scripture to me as I was preaching on
[3:14] the Rapture on Sunday uh I come across
[3:17] that that's right brother bam said this
[3:18] and I thought what verse is that and so
[3:21] I ran it back here and it's Isaiah 27 uh
[3:24] 1 2 and three now of course this whole
[3:26] chapter uh deals with Israel
[3:31] now one thing you'll see though brother
[3:32] random often puts at the end of this he
[3:34] puts uh this extra thought of and no one
[3:37] shall pluck you out of my hand now
[3:40] that's not in the scripture right but we
[3:42] do see God keeping the vineyard right in
[3:45] verse three and we see uh it won't be
[3:48] hurt right so we get this idea that God
[3:51] is going to protect his Vineyard and he
[3:54] will keep it which means guard it night
[3:56] and day what a promise to Israel I hope
[4:00] you know where I'm going Hallelujah if
[4:02] not
[4:04] well now what most people don't
[4:06] understand is that this is a promise for
[4:09] Israel for the Millennium so if you have
[4:12] your Bible go to Isaiah 27 and go down
[4:15] to verse 133 I believe it's the final
[4:16] verse of the chapter it says and it
[4:19] shall come to pass in that day that the
[4:21] great trumpet shall be blown now
[4:22] remember we preached on the Millennium
[4:24] this summer did we not and we preach on
[4:26] the future
[4:27] home and they shall come with which were
[4:30] ready to perish in the land of Assyria
[4:32] which was near Babylon and the outcasts
[4:35] in the land of Egypt which was far from
[4:38] Babylon and shall Worship the Lord in
[4:41] the Holy Mount of
[4:46] Jerusalem so this is a scripture that
[4:48] sets us up for uh people were going to
[4:50] perish in uh Assyria they're going to
[4:53] perish down in in Egypt but God's going
[4:56] to blow a great trumpet or Christ would
[4:58] we'd say would grow blow a great trumpet
[4:59] or maybe the angels and then they're
[5:02] going to come they would have perished
[5:03] but God's going to have mercy on them
[5:05] and they're all going to come to
[5:06] Jerusalem to worship now we all know
[5:08] that hasn't happened uh since Isaiah
[5:11] spoke this right Egyptians have not all
[5:13] the Egyptians all the leftover syrians
[5:15] and the Babylonians they've not all come
[5:18] to do this so this is a scripture
[5:20] referring to the Millennium a millennial
[5:22] scripture now what's interesting to you
[5:25] and I is that brother Brandon would use
[5:27] this preaching to the Bride of Jesus
[5:29] Christ Christ Hallelujah so uh was
[5:32] brother random using this out of uh
[5:34] context the answer is no Hallelujah
[5:37] brother random was seeing a type in here
[5:40] uh by the grace of God which we're going
[5:41] to get to
[5:42] tonight Hallelujah now I want to read uh
[5:45] from one of the commentators I believe
[5:47] this is Albert Barnes if I'm not
[5:48] mistaken he said uh chapter 27 has lots
[5:51] of different expositions on
[5:54] it but uh everyone all seems to agree
[5:57] that's preach this that chapter 24 of
[5:59] Isaiah chapter 25 and 26 all go together
[6:03] the main idea was to show The Joy which
[6:06] would be uh given to Israel upon their
[6:10] rescue and uh brought back to their land
[6:13] the main purpose is to show the effect
[6:15] that the Captivity and deliverance in
[6:17] purifying the Jews themselves and in
[6:20] overcoming their prosperity to idolatry
[6:23] on account of which the Captivity has
[6:25] been suffered to take place the design
[6:28] of this chapter chapter
[6:30] 27 is like that of many others in Isaiah
[6:33] to comfort them when they should be
[6:36] oppressed during the long and painful
[6:38] Exile hallelujah how many know God loves
[6:41] to comfort us hallelujah one thing about
[6:43] God God will not keep suffering from you
[6:46] he'll let you go through suffering in
[6:48] order to help you be more obedient but
[6:51] while you're going through the suffering
[6:52] God will give you reason to Hope
[6:55] Hallelujah so God wrote this uh almost
[6:57] 2800 years ago maybe 29 almost 3,000
[7:01] years ago to Israel church and it gives
[7:04] them hope today I showed my wife I've
[7:06] been finding these shorts on uh YouTube
[7:08] and it's showing the Israelis dancing by
[7:11] the Western Wall dancing these and only
[7:14] the men are together right the men are
[7:15] always separated from the women they're
[7:17] dancing shouting the praise of of of
[7:19] Jehovah they're blowing the chofar even
[7:22] in the midst of War they're still doing
[7:24] their celebrations they know God keeps
[7:27] his word hallelujah in fact uh I've seen
[7:29] many numerous Israelis make shorts and
[7:31] say the fact that that we've had
[7:33] thousands of missiles shot at us very
[7:36] few people have lost their lives he said
[7:38] it's proof that the god of Abraham Isaac
[7:41] and Jacob is still watching over his
[7:43] Israeli seed
[7:45] Hallelujah I mean Israelis today that
[7:47] don't even know Christ they're
[7:49] constantly putting on social media God's
[7:51] the god of Miracles God's a supernatural
[7:54] uh faithful God he keeps his word he
[7:57] protects his people now how many can say
[7:59] Jesus Jesus protects you hallelujah amen
[8:02] exactly right have we just seen it with
[8:03] this election hopefully by God's grace
[8:04] we'll see how it plays out I'm
[8:06] cautiously
[8:07] optimistic right I was not so optimistic
[8:10] on Sunday just because of the last four
[8:13] years I just can't understand the Deep
[8:14] state but God knows all things and God
[8:17] is able to silence them Hallelujah so
[8:20] we'll see we'll see how things go but
[8:22] see uh Israel can even see in the midst
[8:24] of their trials God is protecting them
[8:27] and although Isaiah 27 hasn't been
[8:30] fulfilled they've seen all the other
[8:31] scriptures been fulfilled that God is
[8:34] keeping Israel God's protecting Israel
[8:36] God gives Israel the best weapons God
[8:39] gives Israel the best defense Hallelujah
[8:41] uh God and it's it started since they
[8:44] came back into the land with the Six Day
[8:46] War God has done continually done
[8:48] Supernatural things God's hand is over
[8:51] Israel and I'll say like this God's hand
[8:53] is over his bride as well Hallelujah so
[8:56] we're thankful for Amazing Grace
[8:58] Hallelujah now now we can see in verse
[9:01] one that this great Leviathan is a
[9:03] serpent and we know that serpent we'll
[9:05] get to that in just a moment but then we
[9:07] see that's verse one but in verse two
[9:08] it's a song uh it's a song uh because it
[9:12] says in that day sing ye unto her so in
[9:15] the day when the serpents destroyed sing
[9:18] to her sing to Israel a Vineyard of red
[9:21] wine so Israel isn't a Vineyard of red
[9:25] wine yet but she's going to be now
[9:27] church we all know the third seal what's
[9:29] the oil and wine everybody what's the
[9:31] oil represent everybody say it the
[9:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost what's the
[9:34] wine represent stimulation of Revelation
[9:37] or Joy right the joy of Revelation
[9:39] Hallelujah good job you're a good Bible
[9:40] class Hallelujah been taking good notes
[9:42] been paying attention so this is
[9:44] speaking future Israel is going to have
[9:47] the wine but church we have the wine
[9:49] already hallelujah it's the word I was
[9:52] so simulated by Sunday on Proverbs 8:17
[9:54] I went home and I started quoting the
[9:56] scripture why do I have to be tired I
[9:57] don't have to be tired in the morning I
[9:58] need to get up I need to get up because
[10:00] God's going to meet with me Hallelujah
[10:03] and I've had three good days by God's
[10:04] grace may God help it to continue
[10:06] Hallelujah just the word it stimulated
[10:08] me it it just changed my thoughts it
[10:10] just changed my whole outlook on things
[10:12] that's the power of God's word
[10:14] hallelujah it's able to stir us up amen
[10:17] hallelujah and so we see uh she's going
[10:20] Israel is going to have red wine she's
[10:22] going to have the oil wine she's going
[10:24] to be born as a nation in one day
[10:27] Hallelujah 144,000 will receive receive
[10:29] the baptism of holy ghost in one day
[10:31] Hallelujah now the rest of the chapter
[10:33] goes on to give Israel even more
[10:36] comfort in this song yahweh's protection
[10:39] over the vineyard is shown in Isaiah 273
[10:42] right that's the protection God is going
[10:44] to keep it God's going to water it every
[10:47] moment everybody say every ready every
[10:50] every moment there's never going to be a
[10:52] time when Once God returns to Israel
[10:55] that he's not watering that people

[15:07] hallelujah and then we're even given a
[15:10] promise that will flourish and Israel of
[15:12] course this is speak in Israel but we
[15:13] I'm going to show you this has to apply
[15:15] to the bride as
[15:16] well uh verse six and he shall cause
[15:19] them that come of Jacob to take
[15:22] root Israel shall Blossom and Bud and
[15:25] fill the face of the world with fruit
[15:29] remember the 144,000 are called the
[15:31] first fruits unto God but Church there's
[15:35] a thousand years imagine a thousand
[15:37] years that Israel will multiply and and
[15:40] have uh families and for a thousand
[15:43] years Hallelujah Jesus will rule over
[15:46] Israel with a rod of iron Hallelujah and
[15:48] the TW Apostles will sit on Thrones
[15:51] judging the TW tribes of Israel right
[15:53] under Jesus Christ Lord of lords King of
[15:56] Kings King of the Millennium Hallelujah
[15:59] H oh now here's the quote I read to you
[16:01] on Sunday night or I'm sorry mentioned
[16:03] but I didn't read it now this just for
[16:04] you who uh who are wondering about that
[16:07] what about the heathens who di that
[16:09] never heard about Christ now one time
[16:10] brother Ram said it it's May 27th 1962
[16:13] brother Ram said and then at the return
[16:15] of the church and the bride the Bride In
[16:16] Christ shall walk out upon their ashes
[16:18] in the Millennium when the earth is
[16:20] purified by fire and there they shall
[16:23] reign and the Heathen that's never heard
[16:25] the gospel shall be raised in that time
[16:28] now now I'm not making this Doctrine I'm
[16:30] just telling you the quote because I
[16:31] told you there's a quote that says God
[16:33] might raise up the people that would
[16:34] include the babies that never got a
[16:36] chance that were aborted or whatever
[16:38] they never got a chance or sick and died
[16:39] at young age they never got a chance to
[16:41] hear it's possible I'm not saying it is
[16:44] but it's possible now to me that would
[16:46] make a lot of sense well God wants to
[16:47] give them a chance right God doesn't do
[16:49] away with their souls and their Spirits
[16:51] God has a waiting Spa station for it
[16:53] because remember God fornew us before we
[16:55] even formed Us in the womb hallelujah
[16:58] hallelujah and he knew like we read in
[17:00] in Romans 9 he knew what we would do
[17:01] before we even had one day upon the
[17:03] Earth
[17:05] Hallelujah so it just it's just one
[17:07] thought everybody say that's just one
[17:08] thought ready that's just one thought
[17:10] that's it's just a thought it's not I'm
[17:11] not making Doctrine he said the heathens
[17:14] never heard the gospel shall be raised
[17:16] in that time and the sons of God will be
[17:18] manifested ah will be manifested
[17:20] Hallelujah all the creation will no
[17:22] longer have to grown because God's
[17:24] children will be manifested will appear
[17:26] like Christ will be like Christ and we
[17:29] will rule this Earth by the grace of God
[17:32] hallelujah that's what you and I ought
[17:33] to live for we ought to live so holy now
[17:36] let the people rule whatever they want
[17:37] rule there but we've got to rule over
[17:39] sin now so that we can rule during the
[17:43] Millennium if he's to rign and I'll put
[17:46] she's in there for all of our sisters
[17:47] because we have a lot of sisters in our
[17:48] church if she's to rain she's got to
[17:51] have something to rain over he's got a
[17:53] domain and they ruled and reigned with
[17:56] Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of
[17:57] iron the Nations that then the gospel
[17:59] then the manifested sons of God with the
[18:01] authority just like he had when he was
[18:03] here see there come there will come the
[18:05] Millennium in that rain see upon the
[18:08] ashes now wouldn't that be amazing if we
[18:10] have the same Authority Christ had when
[18:12] Christ was on the earth I'm talking
[18:14] about power over storms amen hallelujah
[18:17] I'm talking about power over nature
[18:20] speaking to trees come on Church
[18:22] speaking to storms and and all this

[20:17] Amen that's right now let's go back here
[20:24] uh well well I'm skip ahead here by
[20:26] God's grace I'm gon to skip ahead I'm
[20:27] not going to read all Isaiah 27 because
[20:29] I'm almost halfway out of time here um
[20:31] almost there let let's go back uh let's
[20:34] remember how God God cannot forget
[20:37] Israel at all so uh Deuteronomy 4:31 I'm
[20:41] gonna have Casa pretty busy here on the
[20:42] computer
[20:43] H just for a little stretch by God's
[20:48] grace Deuteronomy 4:31 for the Lord thy
[20:51] God is a merciful god how many grateful
[20:53] for mercy and mercy is what you get when
[20:56] you've done
[20:57] wrong brother amen asked me to preach on
[20:59] that I might do that at some time Grace
[21:01] is just a gift but Mercy is when you
[21:03] don't deserve it right Hallelujah so for
[21:07] the Lord thy God is a merciful god that
[21:09] means he's merciful to your iniquities
[21:11] when you know to do right and you don't
[21:13] do it he will not forsake thee neither
[21:16] destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of
[21:18] thy fathers which he swear unto them
[21:20] Hallelujah God does not forget his
[21:23] covenants he keeps his promise
[21:25] Hallelujah Isaiah 49:15
[21:29] 16 Isaiah 491 15- 16 can a woman forget
[21:34] her suckling child now in these days yes
[21:37] not so much
[21:38] then a lot of women do awful things now
[21:41] abortion and so forth that she should
[21:43] not have compassion on the son of her
[21:45] womb yay they may forget yet will I not
[21:49] forget thee amen behold I have Graven
[21:53] thee upon the palms of my hands thy
[21:55] walls are continually before me
[21:59] I don't know if this ties in this just
[22:00] struck me now the Bible said not only is
[22:03] Israel on uh Israel is is engraved in
[22:06] the palms of God's hands right or
[22:08] Christ's hands but remember the walls
[22:10] are contined before me but remember the
[22:11] Bible said God broke down the middle
[22:13] wall
[22:15] partition so there's no separation
[22:17] between the Jew and Gentile Hallelujah
[22:20] and that means if God's not going to
[22:21] forget Israel God just didn't die for
[22:23] Jews God died for Gentiles amen
[22:26] hallelujah he he called a people that
[22:28] were not his people his people he called
[22:31] children that were not his children his
[22:32] children he called us that were unloved
[22:35] he called us his beloved
[22:37] Hallelujah glory to God so even now even
[22:40] as Israel is blind to Christ they only
[22:42] know uh the the Torah they only know the
[22:45] prophets in the Old Testament even
[22:47] though uh they're blinded to Jesus
[22:49] Christ they still have God's covenant
[22:52] God cannot forget them and who tonight
[22:55] has the New Covenant of the Holy Ghost
[22:58] written upon the fleshly tables of your
[23:00] heart somebody ought to say Amen to that
[23:02] Hallelujah and if God doesn't forget
[23:05] them while they're blind God won't
[23:06] forget you while your eyes are wide open
[23:09] hallelujah amen oh thank God God put
[23:12] isav on my eyes Hallelujah so I can see
[23:15] the truth of God's word
[23:19] hallelujah that's what he promised in
[23:21] this hour I'll give you eyes have so you
[23:23] can see the real condition of the church
[23:26] the real condition of the world and you
[23:28] can walk in the light of the
[23:31] Gospel I don't know if Elijah knows this
[23:33] but uh most you know it but I was raised
[23:35] in a church Elijah almost every week
[23:36] there was tongues and interpretation
[23:38] people screaming and crying and my mom
[23:40] was healed of cancer when I was 8 years
[23:41] old I mean I've seen emotion I've seen
[23:42] Miracles uh throughout my entire life
[23:46] but uh they never lived a holy
[23:49] life right and so I I saw the power of
[23:52] God but I didn't see the real love of
[23:54] God the humility of God the Holiness of
[23:56] God cuz God said be holy for I'm holy
[24:00] God didn't say be ye woke cuz I'm woke
[24:03] he said be ye holy cuz I'm holy
[24:05] Hallelujah he said be separate separate
[24:08] yourself from the things of the word
[24:10] come out from among them and be ye
[24:11] separate sayith the Lord and I'll
[24:13] receive you
[24:14] Hallelujah that's right we must come out
[24:16] from among these things and that's how I
[24:19] know that God has uh uh called us to the
[24:22] truth because brother Ram said thus
[24:23] sayith the Lord over a thousand times
[24:26] and I found at least six and then
[24:27] there's 10 at least 10 that applied to
[24:29] Divine Healing he told people thus
[24:30] sayith the Lord that were healed and
[24:32] it's on tape I need to preach that
[24:33] sometime soon like in the early 50s
[24:36] brother R will tell somebody it's
[24:37] brother or sister so- and so might be
[24:38] Shepherd I can't remember the exact name
[24:40] I was reading through a few weeks ago he
[24:42] said thus sayith the Lord you're going
[24:43] to be well and you fast forward a couple
[24:45] years that person came back and brother
[24:46] BR said how you doing are you well
[24:48] according to the word of the Lord there
[24:49] said they said just exactly as you said
[24:51] brother brandom thus sayith the Lord
[24:54] amen hallelujah that's right church amen
[24:57] thus sayith the Lord k not fail
[24:59] Hallelujah God has sent us a prophet for
[25:01] a reason to direct us back to the word
[25:03] of
[25:05] God now remember God promised to gather
[25:08] Israel and that's what he's done did you
[25:11] know this in the last 120 years more
[25:14] than 3.5 million Jews have immigrated
[25:18] back to the land of Israel from all over
[25:20] the world they have come rushing back
[25:24] that's because God promised to do
[25:26] it Jeremiah 16 164 let's read that
[25:29] Jeremiah 16:14 and 15 a lot of people
[25:32] don't know
[25:34] that Israel was spread out remember we
[25:37] saw it in the dispersion they were all
[25:38] spread out uh they even brought in
[25:40] Babylonians remember we preached on the
[25:42] partial fear of the Lord they brought in
[25:43] Babylonians to kind of live there in
[25:45] Samaria while so many people were
[25:47] scattered around in different nations
[25:49] verse 14 Jeremiah 16:14 there behold the
[25:53] days come sayith the Lord that it shall
[25:54] be no more said the Lord liveth that
[25:56] brought up the children of Israel out of
[25:58] land of Egypt but the Lord liveth that
[26:00] brought up the children of Israel from
[26:02] the land of the north and from all the
[26:05] lands with he had driven them and I will
[26:08] bring them again into their land that I
[26:10] gave unto their fathers how many know
[26:12] we're living in the Fulfillment of this
[26:13] right here it doesn't apply to us but it
[26:16] applies to the land of Israel they are
[26:19] living in that day they're saying the
[26:21] Lord lives who's brought us back from
[26:23] the north from the south from the east
[26:25] from the West the Lord lives God Is
[26:27] Watching Over his people because they're
[26:29] his Vineyard
[26:31] hallelujah oh my glory to God now let's
[26:34] go back to that leviathon remember
[26:35] Revelation 12:2 let's go back to that
[26:38] leviathon therefore Rejoice ye heavens
[26:40] and ye that dwell them dwell in them woe
[26:43] to the inhabiters of the earth and of
[26:44] the seal I'm sorry and for the sea for
[26:46] the Devils come down unto you having
[26:48] great wrath because he knoweth that he
[26:50] hath but a short time so this is right
[26:53] after the Rapture Satan the bride goes
[26:55] up Satan's down and he knows he's got
[26:58] seven years left that's right he's got a
[27:00] whole week left brother said a couple
[27:02] times Israel has a week left verse 13
[27:05] and when the dragon there's that
[27:06] Leviathan saw that he was cast into the
[27:08] Earth he persecuted the woman which
[27:10] brought forth the Manchild that's
[27:12] Israel verse 14 and to the woman were
[27:15] given two wings of a great Eagle that
[27:17] she might fly into the Wilders so see uh
[27:19] women are like nations are lik into
[27:21] having wings as birds Hallelujah that
[27:25] will prove there's no women Angels if
[27:27] you read Zechariah where it talks about
[27:29] the the the two angels that have wings
[27:31] like uh like women and they're they're
[27:33] carrying Israel in an epha right which
[27:35] is a a storage container these two
[27:37] angels uh these two women with wings are
[27:39] carrying Israel to Shar and people say
[27:42] oh there's women Angels that's a lie
[27:43] there's no such thing as women Angels
[27:45] there's only men Angels
[27:47] Hallelujah that's right and so who were
[27:49] those Nations that was uh Assyria and
[27:51] Babylon we carrying Israel out of their
[27:54] Homeland and that's where it is right
[27:56] there the woman Israel was given two
[27:58] wings of a great Eagle not a
[28:01] stor remember Assyria and Babylon had
[28:04] the stor wings that's an unclean
[28:06] abominable
[28:07] bird but not Israel Israel's liking unto
[28:10] an eagle Hallelujah that she might fly
[28:13] into the Wilderness into her place where
[28:14] she is nourished for a time that's a
[28:16] year times two years and for the half a
[28:19] time which is half a year so three and a
[28:21] half years from the face of the
[28:23] leviathon I'll say like that
[28:26] Serpent and the serpent cast cast out of
[28:28] his mouth water as a flood after the
[28:30] woman that he might cause her to be
[28:31] carried away of the flood and the Earth
[28:33] helped the woman and the Earth opened up
[28:35] her mouth and swallowed up the flood
[28:37] which the Dragon cast out of his mouth
[28:39] amen look how great God is Not only does
[28:42] God swallow up the enemies of Israel but
[28:45] before that God swallows up you the
[28:48] Bible says death will be swallowed up in
[28:50] life hallelujah amen God can swallow any
[28:53] enemy that comes against him he can
[28:55] defeat any foe nobody can conquer Jesus
[28:59] Christ he swallows up all the enemies
[29:02] Hallelujah nobody can stop Jesus Christ
[29:07] Hallelujah and the Earth okay we read
[29:08] that verse 17 and the dragon was wroth
[29:11] with the woman and went to make war with
[29:13] the remnant of her sea because remember
[29:14] the fifth seal told us there's still
[29:16] some of the Brethren that have to give
[29:18] their lives as
[29:19] Martyrs which keep the Commandments of
[29:21] God and have the testimony of Jesus
[29:23] Christ so this is after Christ has uh
[29:26] returned to Israel and revealed himself
[29:28] to them and they have the testimony of
[29:30] the word of God the Old Testament and
[29:32] the testimony of Jesus Christ the New
[29:35] Testament Hallelujah
[29:38] now brother random uses that this phrase
[29:41] uh I'll Water it day and night and
[29:43] though no one will ever pluck them out
[29:44] of my hand I think brother R's uh
[29:46] combining John 10:27 if you go to John
[29:52] 10:27 my sheep hear my voice and I know
[29:55] them and they follow me and I give them
[29:58] unto them eternal life and they shall
[30:00] never perish neither shall any man pluck
[30:02] them out of my hand a sheep is a
[30:05] defenseless animal a sheep must be uh
[30:08] protected by a shepherd and that's what
[30:10] Jesus is saying tonight I'm protecting
[30:12] You Like a Shepherd amen there's no wolf
[30:16] there's no devil there's no addiction
[30:18] there's no evil spirit right there's no
[30:20] lust there's no sin that can ever pluck
[30:22] us out of the hand of God that ought to
[30:24] give us some confidence tonight
[30:26] Hallelujah that God's for for us God's
[30:28] with us I'm going to be saved God's
[30:30] going to finish what he started in my
[30:32] life
[30:32] Hallelujah no devil can pluck me out of
[30:35] my father's hand verse 29 My Father
[30:38] which gave them me is greater than all
[30:41] see so don't worry about the wolf you
[30:43] got a father that's greater than the
[30:46] wolves and no man is able to pluck them
[30:49] out of my father's
[30:51] hand I and my father are one Hallelujah
[30:54] so the father is in the son amen the
[30:57] father is in the Great shepher glory to
[30:58] God so see God's sheep follow the voice
[31:02] of the Bible the word of God and they
[31:05] will not be deceived by a stranger's
[31:07] voice you have nothing to fear oh is
[31:10] somebody going to deceive me no you have
[31:12] nothing to fear nobody can pluck you out
[31:14] of the father's hand you cannot be
[31:17] deceived because Christ is in you
[31:19] Hallelujah and church they will never
[31:22] perish which means will never be lost
[31:26] Hallelujah uh I like the story brother
[31:28] told you he said this he said uh when
[31:30] you hear Brother randoms died uh and
[31:32] dead he said don't believe him he said
[31:34] because I'm still alive on the other
[31:35] side Hallelujah so even if we perish
[31:39] right naturally that's not what it's
[31:40] talking about what it's talking about
[31:42] God won't let us perish spiritually
[31:44] we've got eternal life Hallelujah and
[31:47] we're promised uh we're promised eternal
[31:49] life with God almighty we're promised a
[31:52] mansion we're promised a future home but
[31:54] the thing that attracts us is the maker
[31:56] of the home it's Christ Jesus for in in
[31:59] Christ Jesus all things were created
[32:02] hallelujah oh that's what we're
[32:03] attracted by is Jesus Christ amen now
[32:08] how does this apply to us well turn your
[32:09] Bibles back to Matthew Matthew 20
[32:18] verse1 for the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[32:20] un a man that's a householder which went
[32:22] out early in the morning to hire
[32:23] laborers into his
[32:25] Vineyard and when he had agreed with the
[32:27] laborers for a penny a day he sent them
[32:29] into his Vineyard now you know the story
[32:32] goes on uh at the 11th Hour which would
[32:36] have been what that been 5:00
[32:37] p.m 5:00 P PM there's still work they
[32:40] still need workers and there's people
[32:41] just standing idly by and they say uh
[32:44] hey do you want to work why aren't you
[32:46] working he said well no one's invited us
[32:48] out and so okay come out they so they
[32:50] invite the 11th Hour workers to come out
[32:52] at the last hour kind of the cool of the
[32:55] day right so you have people that worked
[32:57] all Elijah how many hours you work today
[32:58] eight
[32:59] hours8 nine probably sometimes work 10
[33:02] or 11 right probably sometimes 12 if
[33:03] they need you well they had to work 12
[33:06] hours out in the field some of them
[33:07] worked 12 hours some of them only worked
[33:09] one hour but when they all come in after
[33:11] the out of the fields everybody got the
[33:13] same pay but the ones that were there
[33:15] the longest complained and God's like
[33:17] didn't I just promise you one thing I
[33:19] promise you all the same thing you all
[33:21] get eternal life hallelujah amen no no
[33:25] matter how hot it was no matter how many
[33:26] hours you worked you all get the same
[33:28] thing you all get eternal life with
[33:30] Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother R says
[33:33] we are the 11th Hour workers were to go
[33:36] out in the what
[33:39] Vineyard I showed you how Israel is
[33:41] going to be the vineyard but right now
[33:43] Church you're in the
[33:45] vineyard so Lydia Malachi and case
[33:47] you're G Have A New Perspective come
[33:51] spring Matthew
[33:54] 21:40 Matthew 21:40 when the Lord
[33:57] thereof The Vineyard cometh what will he
[33:59] do unto these husband men now this is
[34:01] the parable where the husbandman gave
[34:04] his Vineyard out to some workers he left
[34:06] he said keep it while I'm gone but when
[34:08] he would send Messengers they would kill
[34:10] the messengers because they want to keep
[34:11] the goods and finally he said well I'll
[34:13] just send my son because surely they'll
[34:15] respect my son that represented God
[34:17] sending Jesus Christ what they do they
[34:18] killed him right so then the the the
[34:23] owner of the vineyard gets upset right
[34:25] and he comes and brings judgment on them
[34:26] what will he do to those H husbandmen
[34:28] verse 41 they say unto him he will
[34:31] miserably destroy those wicked men
[34:32] speaking of Israel and will let out his
[34:34] Vineyard unto other husband men which
[34:36] shall render him the fruits in their
[34:41] Seasons how many believe you got the
[34:43] nine fruits of the spirit flowing out of
[34:45] your life that's the fruit he wants you
[34:48] might say fruits of even saved Souls
[34:51] that's the fruit in other words you're
[34:53] working in the vineyard tonight
[34:55] Hallelujah you could be working at all
[34:57] kinds of places tonight but you're here
[34:59] at the house of God you're here planting
[35:01] seeds you're here watering you're here
[35:03] trimming you're here grafting you're
[35:05] doing all the works you're picking
[35:07] you're doing all these things out here
[35:08] you're doing all the work of the
[35:09] vineyard why so the master will have
[35:12] fruit to his Vineyard
[35:14] Hallelujah Jesus said unto them verse 20
[35:16] or 42 did you never read in the
[35:18] scriptures the stone which a builder
[35:20] rejected the same has become the head of
[35:21] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[35:23] is it marvelous in our eyes so the Jews
[35:27] rejected the owner of the vineyard but
[35:29] not the Gentiles the Gentiles accepted
[35:31] him and then the Gentiles he became
[35:33] their
[35:34] Cornerstone another words your life has
[35:37] stability because you've accepted Jesus
[35:40] Christ your life is going to stand no
[35:42] matter what Trials come or persecution
[35:44] or test you're going to stand you're
[35:46] going to keep the faith because your
[35:48] testimony is founded on the cornerstone
[35:51] The Rock Jesus Christ oh my other people
[35:55] their lives and their testimonies I'm
[35:56] sure even a lot elah Seena over there at
[35:58] the other Church in Michigan I'm sure
[35:59] people fall away why aren't they serving
[36:01] God anymore what happened to them they
[36:03] weren't founded on the Rock they weren't
[36:05] founded on the cornerstone the storms
[36:08] are coming but make sure you're
[36:09] established on the rock of
[36:11] Christ
[36:13] Glory verse 43 therefore I say unto you
[36:16] the kingdom of God shall be taken from
[36:18] you Jews and given to a nation bringing
[36:20] forth the fruits there of Gentiles and
[36:23] whosoever shall fall on the stone shall
[36:24] be broken but on whomsoever shall fall
[36:26] it will grind him to powder right so we
[36:30] don't want Christ to come down and crush
[36:31] us we want to throw ourselves at the

[37:01] his Parables they perceived that he
[37:03] spake on them oh Jesus preached on
[37:04] religious people sometimes yeah I do it
[37:06] too sometimes every preacher does while
[37:10] they're listening brother Jesse while
[37:11] they're looking right at you yes I do
[37:13] that sometimes too you have to because
[37:16] you have to preach what God puts on your
[37:18] heart Hallelujah Paul did it Stephen did
[37:20] it right Stephen looked right atad him
[37:22] said you stiff necked and uncircumcised

[37:26] the Holy Ghost
[37:30] H okay so can everybody see that how
[37:32] many know that we have access to the
[37:34] vineyard
[37:35] now Israel had the vineyard right but
[37:39] now you're working the
[37:41] vineyard you have a work to do think
[37:44] about that God thought so much about you
[37:45] he hired
[37:47] you there's a lot of people I wouldn't
[37:49] hire to work at my house I hired Austin
[37:51] a couple times when he was before he had
[37:53] a job he was a good
[37:55] worker Hallelujah but God thought so
[37:58] much of you he called you in the last
[38:01] hour to come work one hour oh Church
[38:03] can't we just work one hour for Jesus
[38:06] Hallelujah can you just work one hour
[38:08] please can we just handle it one hour
[38:10] Mali can we do it of
[38:14] course if we can work one hour he gives
[38:16] us the reward of all the other Saints
[38:18] who've labor much harder much longer
[38:21] than we have now who's the greatest
[38:23] now not us nor do we care to be we just
[38:27] want to be one of them I'm so glad I can
[38:30] say I'm one of them
[38:32] Hallelujah and church the Bible tells us
[38:34] we're working in the vineyard 1
[38:35] Corinthians 9:6 or I only and Barnabas
[38:39] have not we power to forbear working so
[38:41] preachers have the right not to work
[38:43] some of them have the blessing some of
[38:44] them don't verse nine who goeth a
[38:47] Warfare any time at his own charges see
[38:49] you don't go to war unless you're paid
[38:50] to go to War soldiers are always paid to
[38:52] go out and fight who planteth a Vineyard
[38:55] and eateth not the fruit thereof so now
[38:56] Paul call call preachers Vineyard
[39:00] Planters so that's what I've been doing
[39:01] for 18 years I've been planting seeds of
[39:04] the Gospel in the lives of the people
[39:07] and if they'll only let the seeds be
[39:08] watered Glory if they'll just give God
[39:11] praise if they'll just water the seeds
[39:13] that God has had me to preach they're
[39:14] going to bring forth fruit hallelujah

[39:32] preachers are workers in God's
[39:36] Vineyard Hallelujah sometimes it get so
[39:38] hot children I start sweating up here it

[39:44] so hot right some the pressure gets so
[39:47] intense that I start
[39:49] sweating all the
[39:51] pressure but we're thankful we're
[39:53] thankful God called us to work hallel
[39:54] it's a blessing to work Hallelujah for
[39:56] Jesus

[40:00] avoid being lazy Proverbs 24:30 let's
[40:04] read 30 down to 34 we must be very
[40:07] careful not to be
[40:08] lazy now Church what does that mean for
[40:10] us we got to read our Bibles every day
[40:13] you got to pray to God every day
[40:16] Hallelujah don't be lazy and uh the
[40:20] spiritual you got to confess your sins

[40:30] stealing stop
[40:31] stealing don't stop don't keep watching

[40:40] letting a a a Vineyard grow and not even
[40:43] taking care of it
[40:45] wasting wasting what God has entrusted
[40:47] to you wasting your
[40:50] future and sweat just rolled down my
[40:52] back so yeah it does get hot out in the
[40:53] vineyard here I went by the field of the
[40:56] slothful The Lazy and by the vineyard of
[40:58] the man void of understanding they just
[40:59] didn't understand the message did they
[41:02] there's some people that in God's called
[41:04] them but they don't understand the
[41:06] message the message is Jesus Christ is
[41:09] the same yesterday today and
[41:12] forever and lo it was all grown over
[41:15] with thorns now what are thorns remember
[41:17] Church what are thorns cares of this

[41:28] God will give you time to do all
[41:30] that Hallelujah the cares of this life
[41:33] they can all be taken care of if we put
[41:36] God as number one in our
[41:39] lives and Nettles had covered the face
[41:42] thereof and the stone wall thereof was
[41:44] broken down what the Bible say a man's
[41:46] spirit is the
[41:47] wall right a man who doesn't control his
[41:50] thoughts he's lusting all the time or

[41:57] got all these he's got like all these
[41:59] kids with all these women that's a
[42:00] hormonger now I I appreciate his freedom
[42:02] of speech but he's living like a
[42:05] hormonger that's
[42:07] right right so he don't have control
[42:10] over his human Spirit sexually
[42:12] speaking right his stone wall is broken
[42:15] down I I don't even know if he's working
[42:17] the kingdom probably not the way he
[42:19] talks and cusses but it just shows he
[42:22] don't have any wall built up but we've
[42:23] got to build the wall we've got to keep

[51:37] every moment can be a moment of Joy the

[51:58] hallelujah what a
[52:00] blessing now I'm going to read this
[52:01] quote I heard this one again this week
[52:03] now I've been preaching on the seed
[52:05] right the wheat the wheat seed it starts
[52:07] off as a chute stem then chaff and then
[52:10] the seed we are in the seed stage it's
[52:13] harvest time right it's almost time for
[52:15] Jesus to come back we see Israel in her
[52:18] Homeland we so we see evil seducers
[52:20] waxing worse and
[52:22] worse once America changes the laws to
[52:25] kill Christians then we we know the
[52:26] Rapture will be very
[52:28] close because that's what the Bible said
[52:30] if you don't take the mark they'll kill
[52:32] you right buy or sell you can't do it
[52:33] without it brother is talking about
[52:35] changing from glory to glory and he said
[52:38] it's the the church has to come back to
[52:40] its original
[52:41] Glory it's just like a seed of a morning
[52:44] glory the seed of a flower it falls into
[52:46] the ground the seed of corn falls in the
[52:48] ground what's the first thing it comes
[52:49] up it's a little Sprout then it goes to
[52:51] a tassel from a tassel back to the
[52:53] original grain what's the first thing
[52:55] I'm sorry well that's exactly what the
[52:56] church has done it come up from Luther
[52:59] Wesley and now back to the original
[53:01] grain back to its original Glory back to
[53:04] the glory it was at the
[53:07] beginning the Sun that Rose in the East
[53:09] is the same Sun that's manifesting the
[53:11] same in the west changing from glory to
[53:13] glory it changed from the
[53:15] Pagan uh down into Luther from the
[53:18] Luther down into Wesley he talks about
[53:20] how the church had to die in the uh the
[53:22] fourth Church age almost and then into
[53:25] Wesley and then Wesley and the pente C
[53:26] and on and on from glory to glory
[53:28] producing the hidden mana and now it's
[53:31] ripe to bring him back exactly like he
[53:33] was in the beginning his same Ministry
[53:36] the same Jesus the Same power the same
[53:39] Holy Ghost the same one that come down
[53:41] on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy
[53:43] Ghost that's manifested today from Glory
[53:46] unto glory to glory and it's back to its
[53:49] original seed with the baptism of the
[53:51] Holy Ghost with the same signs same
[53:53] wonders same baptism same kind of people
[53:57] act in the same way with the same power
[54:00] with the same sensation it's from Glory
[54:02] unto glory and the next change will be
[54:05] will be changed from Glory into a body
[54:08] likened unto his glorious body when we
[54:10] shall see him
[54:12] Hallelujah that's a mouthful I feel worn
[54:14] out now in other words God is bringing
[54:17] us back to they were at the beginning
[54:19] praise God we can see it with the
[54:21] doctrine we can see it with the word we
[54:23] can see it with our lives and we're
[54:25] going to see it more with more power
[54:28] Hallelujah I believe that because with
[54:31] sincerity comes power we must be more
[54:34] sincere Hallelujah brother R I talked to
[54:37] him on the phone the other day that met
[54:39] yesterday and he said he'd been praying
[54:40] for Revival for the last uh few weeks
[54:44] and he said he fasted three days and you
[54:46] can watch it on YouTube God had a real
[54:48] nice pouring out of the Holy Ghost there
[54:49] people at the altar praying glorifying
[54:51] God people got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
