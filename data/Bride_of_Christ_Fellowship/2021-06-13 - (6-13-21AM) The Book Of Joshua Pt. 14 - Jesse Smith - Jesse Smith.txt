word and bless this reading of thy word anoint us god for your glory in jesus christ's name and saint said amen praise god let's take our bibles here let's go to joshua chapter seven like to look at this series we've been looking at joshua memory verse brother amen gave me a memory verse as we said he'll be here tonight by god's grace let's go to joshua chapter 7 and then we'll go to isaiah 41. joshua chapter 7 we'll just read one verse here so lord willing we'll look at joshua this morning i think this evening i want to look at the names of god i've never preached on all the different names of god of course you can't cover in one sermon as i'm studying it i'm just like wow this is an amazing amazing subject but i want to preach you know let's just on like jehovah adonai yahweh i want to just preach on some of those hebrew names of god tonight as i've been as i've been beginning to study that subject it's a tremendous subject i'm getting a lot of notes you know from schofield like brother branham did so i'd like to preach on that tonight and so i did all my slides on that subject i don't really have any slides for you today so hope that's okay just just nice to have slides you can see when brother branham said it when the bible said it you know other other pictures and things joshua 7 verse 1 joshua 7 verse 1. let's just read verse one together then we'll read isaiah 41 10. okay so let's begin on three one two three but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for achan the son of kharmi the son of zabday the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel praise god let's go to isaiah 41 this is a little memory verse just ask the lord to write this upon our hearts we just want to thank everybody that could come on wednesday night thank you naomi and the family and were you here wednesday night god bless you sister hua thanks everybody for showing up wednesday when brother simon ministered my family as i said was on vacation so we wrote in pennsylvania but thank you for your support for the things of god it's a joy to be a christian and i just appreciate everybody's love and support may god bless you richly isaiah 41 verse 10. so this is a wonderful scripture just a real encouraging scripture god tells israel through the prophet isaiah so let's read verse verse 10. ready one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness may god has blessings the ring of his word may be seed if you like here so let's get right to the word of god last week we looked at we actually took both services last sunday on the book of joshua and so i'll just kind of rehearse a little bit you know we uh we looked at the conquest of jericho uh last week and then we looked at uh in the morning and then we looked at uh more scriptures on it in the evening so let me just flip over there you know i think this will tie together you know names of god very uh very uh nicely to help you understand how many know the name joshua means jehovah is our salvation so in the hebrew the name joshua is yeshua right which is jehovah is our salvation now the english translation is joshua right that's what that's how we say jehovah is salvation now the greek translation of that name joshua is jesus so it's a different than the translators when they had to differentiate between joshua and jesus they just use the greek form of joshua and so when we say jesus we're actually saying the greek word joshua because it'd be a little bit confusing right to have every time you talk about think about that if you open up your bible every time in the new testament said jesus what it is but to the translators one right and not to get any confusion uh so they greek word for joshua jesus and so we read jesus will save his people from his sins right in matthew chapter one right yeshua will save us from our sins and so joshua here as we look in the the book of joshua is a great figure of jesus christ right because joshua is salvation now we know there's many types of of the promised land right there's the type of going to heaven can be your promised land how are we looking forward to that promised land praise god uh there's also the type of the promised land of the baptism of the holy ghost that's what brother ram said he said i want all i want to see all my church cross over into that promised land amen that's a beautiful type to see that we got to come out of egypt through being saved be sanctified in the wilderness and then cross over into our promises our possessions that god has for us then you have another type brother brahm says his third pole he said i've got to leave this second pole i've got to go forward beyond jordan into the third pole the opening of the seals the speaking of the word right the revelations of marriage and divorce and all the all thus say the lord revelation so we have many good examples here many applications for the promised land but for you and i i like to stay on this one about us uh taking the promised land today because brother brother man teaches and the bible is clear about it we don't want to miss the promises for today we can all thank god for what god did for joshua we can all thank god for what god's going to do but we want to thank god for what he's doing right now and then also be a participant in what he's doing right now praise god because like the pharisees they thank god for what he was and what he would be but they missed jesus christ right there they missed the present word of god in their day and that's what we believe we are we believe we're packing the present revelation of the word of god praise god like i was sharing with you a few weeks ago the azusa street movement had a lot it started out perfect if you if you research it you'll see it started off with prayer fasting and then unknown tongues and interpretations were perfect but within less than 20 years by 1920 a group had already organized and made the initial evidence of the holy ghost speaking in tongues but that was wrong that speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost right it's just one of the signs that you're born again right because the bible has says different people when people got filled they either magnified god you could prophesy right you could shout scream cry dance in the spirit there's a lot of things you could do when the holy ghost comes but one thing you'll do is magnify god amen one thing you'll do is have an experience where the bible says you can see it and hear it praise god and so and it was actually through charles parnum he was a pentecostal preacher he was the first one that actually started preaching the three works of grace right but his third work was speaking in tongues which that was true for the day of pentecost but that's not true for everybody right because there's a purpose god needed those tongues there because there were 17 different nations that needed to hear the gospel praise god and he had already prophesied in isaiah 800 years earlier with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to this people and yet they would not hear praise god now look at that the prophecy said most wouldn't hear but thank god i've heard the word of god amen i think that's how it is today most people won't hear most people won't receive the open book of the seven seals praise god most people won't receive that but we are the ones that do receive it praise god we are the ones that take the book like john in revelation 10. eat it and then prophesy again to many nations peoples kindreds and tongues it's our job to eat the word of god it's our job to continually feast upon the word of god and tell somebody about it oh thank god amen so it's it's through this illustration i just want to background that a little bit but see and then they broke up into denominations you know you had the the pentecostal and then you had the oneness then you had the tunis and you have assemblies of god which i was raised in and thank god it was a very good group of people they were very loving but with their doctrine they hinder god they limit god right their doctrine limits god and and then when we see it we for example uh you know i went to the class when i was at the church and they said well you got to speak in tongues while i showed them well the bible says not all speak with tongues i showed the pastor that the bible said not all speak with tongues and his answer was that's just what we believe now to me that's not enough if there's a question i want a bible answer praise god the bible said not all have gifts of healing not all speak with tongues not all are apostles not all are missionaries but all those who have the holy ghost will be led into all truth all of god's truth praise god that's one way you know you see your life being brought further into the truth of god's word you're constantly growing feasting on the things of god you're becoming more like christ all the time amen hallelujah so the denomination just rose up and rose up and and right raising up but we believe we're in this group that has received the revelation peter calls it the present truth praise god and the present truth is that jesus christ is the same today yesterday today and forever and that jesus christ is going to restore all things before the end time so let's go to matthew 17 11 can you just put that up there i just want to show this the word of this day is jesus christ is the same and he's restoring all that the book of acts was man because many churches have lost that many churches have lost the power of healing the sick or speaking in tongues right or or living a holy life many muslim have lost have lost that they've lost the power of living a holy life and obeying every word of god that's the main thing that they've lost but look jesus answered said elias truly shall first come and restore all things so jesus said before the end time everything has to be restored like it was at the beginning praise god now go to acts 3 20 acts 3 20. i just thought i lay this foundation here acts 3 20. and he shall send jesus christ which was before i'm sorry before was preached unto you verse 21. acacia thank you whom the heaven must receive now look heaven's going to keep jesus until the times of restitution of all things now we know when jesus comes back at the rapture he leaves heaven and he comes down to the sky amen so before jesus comes down to the sky everything's got to be restored praise god and that don't mean uh the future whole and the new jerusalem that's what he's talking about he's talking about the faith of the fathers right the apostolic ministry from the day of pentecost that's got to be restored praise god the life that they live the full doctrine the power the love that they had for one another the discipleship that they had all that has to be restored until heaven allows come back and meet his bride in the air at the rapture it's since the world began praise god amen so that's that's what we can see now now here we are here we're we're in the restoring of all things i listed off some of them last time but you know people today have women preachers but that wasn't in the beginning so a church that has women preachers is not being restored back to the beginning because when jesus started he only had 12 men he didn't choose any sisters now he had sisters to feed and and clothe and help him out that was a great blessing but just men to preach praise god right and that's what god's doing he's restoring back all of those or you get a leading from the lord now today churches will just decide they'll guess and say well you have a they'll they try to impart gifts you ever seen that they just try to impart gifts to people but they probably never prayed and fasted beforehand trying to get people emotional but in the bible people said paul and barnabas serve god with prayer and fastings and they did that until the holy spirit spoke praise god now that's real devotion praise god that's really seeking god and that's what we want to see restored today praise god amen where saints like us will pray and fast until god gives an answer amen whatever they had to be getting it's going to be restored today before jesus comes back to meet us in the air amen everything they had is going to be restored and if it wasn't there at the book of acts in the beginning it's not going to be there with the true church at the end and i'm talking about the true church because jesus said there's two kinds of christians there's wise christians and foolish christians now this will help you so much before i knew this revelation i was so confused how can these people be christians and not act like other people it's because of this there's two different kinds just like you have sil or gold and silver they're both valuable but one's more valuable than the other praise god hallelujah and so in jesus eyes they're saints that have oil they've made preparation they spent more time praying amen they spent more time reading the word fasting seeking god they spent more time and prepared oil so they're wise they've redeemed the time but you also have other people that they're virgin to the word they don't have any idols in their life they just don't have the oil and they don't have the same type of life they haven't produced the oil in their life they didn't make the effort to get the oil i want to be one of those wise ones that spent my time storing up oil amen and having plenty of oil so that i'll have a light when the bridegroom comes amen i have a light to go out and meet the bridegroom i won't be saying where's the light where's the light where's the oil i need oil i'll say i've got oil praise god i know it because i made the time to go get it praise god and i'm going out to meet the bridegroom hallelujah and so that makes us we can be happy though still for foolish virgins because at least they're virgin right at least they're virgin but they've got to get the oil themselves praise god they've got to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ just like peter said you want the holy ghost repent and be baptized and in the name of jesus christ and you shall be filled with the gift of the holy ghost praise god see many people won't repent they won't repent of uh bitterness right they won't repent of lust or or greed or fear they won't repent of these things right anger and wrath and and malice and all these things they won't repent of that but a real christian says god clean out my entire vessel praise god anything that's within me that doesn't please you clean it out of my life wash me out so you can totally fill me praise god that's what a real christian prays that's what we pray today praise god and we continue to ask god to clean out our lives even if we're born again clean out our minds because our soul is born again but our mind needs transformed amen our mind needs refocus on the things of god and that's and that it's god letting the light shine into darkness praise god our minds sometimes get clouded in darkness but the light of god shines in our our minds and our minds get illuminated by the transformation of the word yes that's right now now let's get back to joshua now now in last week we went over joshua 6 and i didn't get a chance to hit some scriptures so let's go to uh james 4 3 please james 4 3 can you pull it up there i just wanted to remind us that remember the bible said that by faith the walls of jericho fell down by faith simple faith brought the walls down and i just want you to notice here let's look at a few scriptures as long as they just they just had to keep the word of the captain of the lord's host praise god just do what the captain says in this case it was six trips around right six rotations around and in the seventh day they did seven rotations for 13 rotations see 13 is a good number yeah jesus plus 12 disciples that's a good number satan tries to say it's a bad number satan's a liar satan doesn't know the word like he thinks right now i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say much about that but see they just had to have faith praise god faith brought the walls down now here now look at this sometimes church we just have to simply obey the word of god sometimes you know god just wants us to sit back and trust in him and that's what we're going to see today as we get to jericho with an ai jericho is going to be a more passive victory right so there's times that we just have to obey the word just just keep going around and around the same thing just keep going around there's no we're not shooting we're not swiping anybody with our sword right we're not we're not cutting anything down we're just marching in position right we're just keeping the routine amen right sunday in wednesday in sunday in wednesday in sometime saturday in you know sometimes friday night in you just around and around you go and you're just walking you're just marching right but then there's other times where god calls you to go out and swing the sword praise god and shut down the enemy but in this case god was saying just trust me just obey just just be still and know that i'm god amen and this is going to be the first battle in the promised land the first battle after being born again can you remember yours i really can't remember mine but there you can remember what was your first great battle after you were born again i can tell you one i know for sure jesus christ his first battle was the wilderness fight with satan that was a jericho brother william jesus had to go up this jericho the spirit led him to face not a small enemy but the greatest enemy satan himself the the the son of the mourning himself right the light bearer himself that's what lucifer means in the hebrew lightbearer the light bear himself the brightest angel you know the we say the most beautiful angel of all of them god led jesus he's freshly born again brother said you would have thought that god would have led him you know to heal the sick but brother ahm said god was testing out his inoculation to see if it would work against the enemy praise god hallelujah in other words god inoculated jesus with his own spear and he said i want to test this spirit out and i'm going to test it out with the hardest one first god didn't try it out on some little enemy or some some lesser devil he's he tried yes he tried that had a modern jericho and we know how where they overcame in jericho just obey the word just stand behind the word jesus didn't do any miracles he just quoted the word all he had to do was stand just like paul said paul said having done all just stand on the word of god see something jesus wasn't you know uh doing miracles and trying to perform this and calling things and calling storms he was just speaking the word he was just standing there with the revelation god gave him and god gave him the victory praise god hallelujah now here's what i want to get to see in our times church if we're going through a past of victory we have to make sure we just pray the right way right you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lusts see sometimes you know we may not be seeing the victory because we're praying the wrong thing right we wonder why is it why isn't the victory coming see because sometimes we want to see god answer our requests in our desire or in our way but james tells us don't ask what you want ask for the will of the lord praise god right now we make our request known unto god philippians says but we do it with thanksgiving amen and then after that then the peace of god comes upon us but we must ask the right thing praise god now go to first john 3 20 and 20 20 first john 3 20 21 22 see joshua just had to keep the details of the word the simple details here and if he just kept the word and they just they just got into the routine of god's word god was going to fight for them how many seen that god fight for you praise god all she did was just obey the word you didn't have an all-night prayer meeting you didn't cast out a devil right you sometimes you have to do that right but you just kept the word of god you just did the same routine over and over just praying reading my bible going to church loving god listening to sermons singing to god i just got the same routine and the wall he fell down before me amen how did you do that by faith by faith just believing god's word just staying faithful praise god just keeping all the sin out and obeying the simple instruction of the word of god you'll get many victories just by being faithful praise god hallelujah first john 3 verse 20. can you pull that up there please sweetie first john 3 20. now yeah mj and i were talking about this a couple weeks ago right brother for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things so see god knows when we've asked the wrong way okay now next verse beloved if our heart condemns us not then we have confidence toward god now that just directly applies to where we're going in joshua with achan right achan couldn't expect the blessings of god because he'd broken the word of god right he had a heart that condemned him right but see joshua and all the other people they had a pure heart so they knew god was with them and they should have got the victory they should have been able to overcome but but see there there's someone wrong in the camp remember brother and tells us joshua is a lesson to the church that it must be a perfect walk and the only way we can walk perfect is by jesus forgiveness through the blood each day saying god forgive me god help me god strengthen me god prepare me help me to be humble today help me to be obedient today help me to be about your business lord now verse 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive a hymn because we keep his commands there we go and do those things that are pleasing to sight and i'm sorry we talked about a different verse brother we talked about the one there's a sin that you don't pray for right and that was for blasphemy i'm sorry that's right thank you brother yes yes i got that mixed up forgive me yes we were talking about the there's a sin you don't pray for jesus said i pray not for the world so see there are some things like blasphemy of the holy ghost you don't pray for people like that right but if you're not certain you still pray for them praise god because bless those who persecute you and do good to them that hate you praise god right yeah that's right so what sir we ask we receive a hymn because we keep his commands and do those things that are pleasing so we see the same principle in joshua's day carrying over to the new testament you can expect god to answer your prayers if we keep his word because our heart doesn't condemn us that's why it's so important to get up and say god get up in the morning say god forgive me of anything wrong i did yesterday and of course we should go to bed saying that lord forgive me anything wrong i did today lord cleanse me because remember in the old testament they had morning sacrifice and evening sacrifice you should pray in the morning and pray in the evening and the church said you should have a time of sacrifice and family alter time or personal author time right so that all your sins are confessed and that way you know the power of god can move in your life amen now go to mark one this scripture came back to me the other day mark 1 32 i want you to see how humble jesus christ was i want you to see how he humbled himself even after great victories i believe this is at capernaum if i'm not mistaken jesus heals simon's wife who laid with a fever just by raising her up he cast out uh the demons out of a man in the synagogue earlier in the chapter and look at verse 32 and that even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and then that were possessed of devils look all this is not a small it's not one person this is a lot of people and simon and they that were with him followed after him i'm sorry i skipped the verse verse 33 and all the city was gathered together at the door and he healed many that were sick of diverse diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him look at how powerful jesus invite the whole city comes out to see jesus what a revival this must have been and everybody sick in the city got healed praise god all the all the oppression all the torment left in one prayer meeting can i say it like that in one prayer line hallelujah jesus when he was there he healed everyone in the prayer line and it caused great joy in the city praise god oh that's beautiful look at verse 34. and i'm sorry you read that verse 34. no yeah yeah now verse 35 look he has a great tremendous campaign he heals the whole city brothers now look at verse 35 in the morning did he sleep in no no it's okay to sleep in from time to time right i did it this last week because i'm on vacation but in the morning rising up a great while before day look he did all these miracles and look what he did he had to make sure he stayed humble he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed goodness gracious see look he spent all that energy casting out devils praying for the sick and he said if i'm going to get any time with my father it's got to be early in the morning because then peter follows him and said hey everybody's looking for you in the city see when even when you're doing the father's work the father still wants to talk personally with you is that right church you might be doing all the father wants you to do and and people are blessed and everybody loves you and it's a great victory and you're sitting in heavenly places gotta say like that everybody's in joy and worship and everything's happy but god still wants time with you amen and if jesus christ had to do it how much more do we have to do it he did not have sin in his members he had death in his members right he was the word made flesh but he still had death in his members right he didn't have the sin nature like we've got but we've got death and sin in our members but thank god we got the holy ghost in our souls amen and that's what we got to make sure we have that fellowship with god in the morning so god can strengthen our soul right renew our minds we got to have fellowship with father every day see great victories doesn't mean get hold on god great victories mean lord prepare me for the next day that i can be ready to do your will see jesus wasn't going to be prideful how many want to be humble before the lord no matter what great testimonies we have we want to remain humble that's one of the most important things to do we can't get lifted up in pride think we're better than somebody we're not better than anybody right we may have a higher calling like the gold and the silver we have a higher value because we're keeping more of the word right but we're still no better we're we're still sinners saved by grace and we don't want pride to come in and ruin our testimony because the bible said you can lose your rewards we don't want to lose any reward praise god we want to gain all the rewards for the glory of god almighty amen for god's glory remember jesus said the father is glorified when you bear much fruit praise god so our rewards are not for our glory they're for god's glory amen god gets more glory when when more things happen in our lives and there's more testimonies god is the one who's glorified because we look around ourselves and say i know she couldn't do it i know he couldn't do it i definitely know he couldn't do it right the only one that can do it was god so god gets all the glory praise god amen now back to joshua now if you got your bibles go back to joshua 7. so see we can see this jericho jesus had a jericho moment right he come against this mighty enemy he was already fasted and praying 40 days right but he's able to overcome just by quoting the word quote the word quote the word believe the word believe the word so if you haven't been born again yet once you get born again get ready god's going to test out that inoculation you got you're going to be tested maybe your family will come against you right that's a great test maybe you have an accident that'd be a great test maybe you have a sickness maybe you have someone uh reproach you revile you you may have some great battle but god is gonna show you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world amen there was no one greater than satan as far as power but jesus's inoculation jesus's anointing stood the test it overcame the enemy and that's what god's looking for today overcomers in fact that's what the book could be could be called if you could summon up overcoming and remember that's all they did every time they overcome god said set up a memorial right set up some stones go build an altar i just said don't forget this church that's why we can't forget of course please don't go to sleep if i start telling sister who is testimony about her dad how many times have i shared that but church the reason we do that is because it reminds us of how powerful god is if god did it there god can do it again amen now he may do it a different way he doesn't do it always the same way but we know if he did it once he can do it again and if our god was faithful last year he's faithful this year amen hallelujah because remember when you forget you start backsliding right let's go ahead and go to it uh second peter one i might as well since i'm on the thought right now i didn't really have it on my notes second peter one church if we are not constantly adding testimonies can i say it like that if we're not constantly adding testimonies we're going to forget while the god is done second peter chapter one of course the statue of every man one of my favorite subjects i've preached many times which i love it and brother william i'm going to keep preaching it many more times because peter says in this chapter he said you know i'm going to die soon but i'm going to always keep you in remembrance of this he said if you don't keep adding to your stature you're going to forget you're forgiven right that's what he says now now look at verse nine now you know we have that we have that beautiful picture over there sister wendy faith virtue knowledge tempers see those are those are christian levels god wants to raise us up in i know the denominational world that you really use the word level and they say oh you're going to go up a level and they don't even know what they're talking about right right by the way they say you're gonna go up a level you're gonna make a million dollars instead of a hundred times god don't care about that level god wants you to get a level up there god wants you to be filled with his temperance amen god wants you to be both a level in patience hallelujah now that well i signed my contract with a 1 000 pen one time i saw a preacher woman say that i'm like are you kidding me like that makes you that makes you going up a level yeah with satan you know like with greed god's levels are right there peter says add to your faith virtue add to that knowledge tempers patience godless brother kindness let's add those levels amen that's the kind of levels we're going up praise god hallelujah they're so deceived by the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life so satan has so deceived them at the end of paul's ministry by the nj how many coats did paul have one remember paul told timothy he said bring my coat from troas because he's in prison that man was such a man of god and yet the end of his life he only had one coat now i got right now i counted a few weeks ago i have like 10 suits we're a blessed people but paul had one coat so see how much we have doesn't mean how close we are to god what we have naturally amen it's what we have character wise by the character of christ how much we live like christ and obey christ and keep all his commands amen that's what counts that's the levels church we need to go up but look at verse 9. if we don't add those levels to our lives but he that lack at these things is blind cannot see far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins see if you don't add god's nature you're adding worldly ideas satan's nature and then you forget about the cross you forget about the blood you forget about your foundation because faith is faith in what faith in the blood paul said in romans 5. he said our faith is in the blood of jesus christ if you don't constantly add to your character go up a level in the anointing of god you'll forget where you came from and that's why joshua was always told by god set up a memorial remember this day remember what god did you're going to need to remember it praise god because if not you'll forget that god is with you church god is not out there god is right in here praise god amen he's in you but all says anointing is out here to anoint our minds and our bodies praise god i want your body to go pray for somebody anoint your body to go help out the poor person right anoint your body to go do what you have to do to glorify the lord praise god see anointing's in here but the anointing also comes down from heaven hallelujah see anointing all three parts of the temple body spirit soul see that and see that's why god said set up an altar stack up those 12 stones remember brother put 12 stones there right in the midst of it right right in the midst of jordan and then he said set one up there and gilgal looks like there was two two of them set up he said set 12 stones up there and when your children ask where this come from remind them of what i did for you never forget what god has done for us amen i just had a reminder come up this week and said remember to do something special because your mom got healed from cancer on august 17th 1988 my mom was healed of cancer so it's june june july august i got two months to prepare i gotta do something special for my family i never want to forget that oh and i brought bought some colored pencils i'm gonna draw a picture of that moment when we did the prayer cloth sister who when we had the prayer cloth jose i took a screenshot of that lord willing this summer if i can get to it i like art i'm not a very good artist but i like to draw i'm gonna i'm gonna do a drawing lord willing that's my plan right now at least i bought all these crayola colored pencils and i want to set up some type of memorial of when your dad got here last year because i don't want to forget not that we have to do that it's just it's a liberty right but i just don't want to forget i want people to come in and ask hey daddy what is that about like when zion gets older most of my little ones know about it you know or uh genevieve she's only three she may forget i want them to walk in and say daddy why'd you do this who drew this well i drew it to remember when god healed who was dead he was almost dead in a coma they said pulled the cards but god said not yet amen hallelujah because god has the final say amen the doctors do great things but there's a greater doctor the great physician dr jesus amen he has the last say praise god amen i want to remember that as an encouragement the next time i get sick sister i don't start feeling bad for myself and complaining i don't want to complain i want to remember that god's a mighty god amen and he's faithful praise god and if my heart doesn't condemn me i can ask what i will and god will do it praise god amen i want to remember so to this date i haven't set up those memorials but i want to set it up you know why because i believe i'm the spiritual joshua anybody else believe that out there see i'm staring you down like that anybody else anybody else know that you can conquer all the giants remember god listed seven nations the hivites uh the gibby knights all these not the giveaways but the parasites the amorites and you start naming off all the ites right i want to be one of those joshuas that tears down all these strongholds amen all these forces against us god one by one he goes to the list and takes down this one takes down that one takes down that one pretty soon they're all taken down and we're free amen all the enemies are defeated and we can live in the freedom and power of the holy spirit amen that's what joshua is that's what i'm talking about praise god that we're the joshua invincible army and god is giving us his promises amen we're possessing the promises moses couldn't say that amen aaron's going to say that but joshua and caleb could say that amen that we are possessing the promises we've heard about him so long but now we're going from bible experience to bible experience from glory to glory from footstep to footsteps we're possessing the promises so if you go up a level level eight levels right how you doing brother jess verse 10. wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall never never you are invincible if you just add jesus's faith jesus give me your faith jesus give me your virtue and so forth jesus give me all these you'll never fall oh glory i'll never follow the message praise god i never fall back into sin but i'll overcome sin i'll overcome the wicked one praise god i'll never fall because god has taken me up level and i'm remembering i'm saved by the blood the blood is keeping me pure the blood is protecting me the blood is saving me the blood is keeping me saved amen and the blood will never lose its power hallelujah thank you jesus i'll never fall as a final fall i'll keep standing for the things of god amen hallelujah in verse 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the promised land the other one because right now i'm in a different one brother william right now i'm in the spiritual promised land but if i keep all the anointings and keep going up then i'm going to the other promised land amen that other dimension praise god that holy dimension called paradise amen paul said i was caught up into paradise if we keep possessing all these promises if we never fall in this promised land we'll make it to the other one praise god amen beautiful he said abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i put you to be wherefore i'm sorry wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance i'm always going to remind you he's the man i should have brought my keys up here he's the man with the keys to the kingdom i like to jiggle some keys anybody got any keys right now go ahead and jiggle them keys if you got them there we go brother j amen here's the man with the keys jiggling him again he said i've got the keys to the kingdom right and if you keep all these things these keys they'll let you through the door can i say it like that right i'm always going to remind you about these keys that open the door of faith amen the door virtue knowledge these keys open the baptism of the holy ghost praise god i'm always going to keep you in remembrance of those things though you know them and be established in the present truth look at verse 13. yeah i think it is me as long as i'm in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance so how do you stir up the saints well brother uh william's been around a long time how do you stir up my old church remind them remind them of what god has done right remind them of what your life used to be remember jesus said when you want your first love back he said remember what you were go back and repent oh come on brother jesse stir us up all i can do is remind you that's only way i can steer you up what did you used to be right how did you used to serve god what was your attitude before whatever obstacle came into your life or see remember that go back to that remember all that god's done for you remember you're forgiven remember you're a joshua remember you're a conqueror you're not smaller than those things you're greater because the greater one is in you praise god that's how i can stir the people up remember what you used to be remember what he's done remember his faithfulness remember his power remember he said i'll never leave you i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age that means he's here today hallelujah it's actually quite simple to get the church stirred back up again just remind them of what god has done remember when you first got saved how do you remember that i can still picture it i'll never forget that praise god you remember when you first got faith remember when you got the virtue of god when you got the knowledge of god oh and i understand the word the temperance of god oh i remember when i got victory over those bodily passions i remember when god delivered me from those addictions and so you got temperance i remember what he did well how did i get there my heart doesn't condemn me right i was in a condition where my heart didn't condemn me i confess my sin well let me confess my sin now and that will get me back to my first love oh hallelujah it's not rocket science right it's just a bible truth where praise god some simple truth okay now give me about a little bit more time here like i said i look at the names of god tonight but i want to i just want to lay some of these in okay joshua said we only got to the text because i want the background on a few of those thoughts yes sir we're overcomer saints we're overcomers and we must remember what god has done never forget how the blood of jesus christ wash you from your sins because if you ever forget that that proves you're not adding more anointing to your life you must the bible said everyone has a measure of faith right romans 12. everyone has a portion of faith but then god wants to give you a portion of virtue knowledge he wants to delay all these portions pretty soon you got a pretty good portion right eight he got seven portions of something up pretty soon that's pretty good i mean now you got a full port now you're filled with the holy ghost praise god and that's the real question right there now let's look here just let's take a few thoughts on uh aiken you're very familiar with him aiken we read verse one so remember god had already told them if you touch something cursed you're gonna be cursed so ache in other words he knew the word but what do you commit iniquity remember we talked about that iniquity is when you purposely do lawlessness right so aiken is example of iniquity he know what's he knew what was right but he did wrong anyway and remember he's from the tribe of praise right he was a praised man i'm a praise man i love the praise but i'm gonna take the curse thing praise god jesus was from the tribe of judah too hallelujah praise god he's a praise man he really worshiped just like satan right satan was a leader in worship and joshua verse 2 sent men from jericho to ai now i'm going to skip some of these he said go up and view the country the country now they return and in verse three the men say oh we only need two or three thousand to defeat ai so in verse four they sent up three thousand and they fled verse 5 36 men died look there's 12 tribes right 10 12 12 times 3 36 so three men from each tribe died god was giving a warning to the entire group warning warning something's wrong something's wrong the church what does joshua do verse 6 he rent his clothes actually you know before that verse 5 the bible said at the end of the verse the hearts of the people melted as became as water do you ever feel like that like your emotions you ever feel like your motion just dropped to the bottom of your stomach every time i think zion's going to fall down the stairs that happens like he's climbing by the stairs and he'll fall and somebody will catch him i'll say thank god thank you jesus you protected my son from falling down the stairs you know they like to play on the stairs well the bible said when they heard they lost the battle their hearts melted and ran like water so it's like their their stomachs hit the floor the church did you notice this did joshua ever see god about this first that's why i love that quote brother adam said he said read your bible every day he said pray every day he said before you make any decision say lord what would you have me to do about this did joshua seek god before going down the ai it was his own desire now church did he have a scripture yes the scripture said wherever you put your feet you'll get it right so do we all things are possible to them that believe jesus said right all things every we've been blessed with all spiritual blessings in christ jesus ephesians chapter one verse four we have all these blessings but there's conditions that go along with these promises and joshua forgot to seek god before the next battle he just let the men it's kind of like david right he kind of let the men kind of talking what do you think can we do this what how many do you think we should send see it was a council of men right men's ideas and what does it lead to death 36 men died now church that's what i always want to do i want to it's okay to have thoughts church it's okay to even have godly thoughts right but we want to pray before we do anything now you know i preached this before but every time the bible said david inquired of the lord he whipped the enemy every time he just had to go ask you know either the urem thumb him or he had to go pray with himself every time he said god should i do this he got the victory the only times he lost was when he didn't do that like with uriah right and bathsheba and then the bible said the sword of the sword never left this house because of that iniquity that he did but every time he got down church every time we get down on our knees say god it looks like i should do this but i just want to take a little time and say lord should i do this may we humble ourselves to be like that we probably figure well yeah lord you probably want to heal brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so or yeah you probably want me to go preach with lord just out of respect amen just out of my respect for you just out of my humility i want to ask you about it first i'm not just going to assume we're going to get the victory i'm going to make sure i pray before i go into this battle church anytime you have a meeting with somebody with an important subject or a phone call something important pray every time pray every time because you never know what's going to happen people may have ambushed you right that's what we'll get through later that's how actually joshua gets the victory over ai he sets up an ambush but satan does ambushes too right so look at this all their emotions run down like water is that clock right okay felt like everything was running out what is gonna happen and look at verse six and joshua ran his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the lord until the event tied so he spent hours crying unto the lord hours until they even died he and the elders of israel put dust on their heads and joshua said now look at this prayer church alas oh lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan deliver us in the hand of our amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side of jordan he's now doubting the very promises god had done for him he's doubting everything god had done well maybe it wasn't god's will for me to cross jordan maybe it wasn't god's will to circumcise those men maybe it wasn't god's will to go up to gilgal maybe it wasn't god's will to do jericho see church our mistakes or our trials are are sent to show us what's still left in our hearts your battles and your trials many times is god letting you look in the mirror to see what's in your heart what are you going to say when you get sick right what are you going to say when you fail can you see that this is one of the this is one of the worst uh attributes of joshua's character that we see through the whole bible most of the time he's like warrior brother man said he was the greatest general there ever was amen because he represented jesus amen but here we get a look into joshua at one of his worst moments god why did you why didn't you just let us stay on the other side why didn't you let me stay in sanctification is that right why didn't you let me stay out there in the wilderness where i miss that angel food that light bread was it your will even to bring me over this this old corn of the land and the good things of god was this even your will did i miss you somehow and what is he doing he's kind of accusing god of doing wrong would to god we should have been content would to god we should have been content and dwelt on the other side of jordan see church every man as powerful anointing as you have you're still a man you're still a woman is that right this man had walked through a river brother mj he'd walked through a river they'd conquered the greatest city there ever was right there in the canyons he'd seen he'd seen the walls fall flat down and then he climbed over the walls and slew and saw this great victory and there now he's like well should we have even done this of course you should have that's what god would have said that's what god does say like if i have one mistake as a pastor lord i men i gave the person the wrong advice are you sure you call me the pastor are you sure you called me to preach are you sure you anointed me to do this of course he did every person make mistakes but man said the best part that joshua had was when god said as i was with moses so i'll be with you and moses made mistakes but god never left him because god honored his position praise god god honored the commission that moses had and that's how it is with us we may make mistakes but god will honor us god will bring us back to humility god has called us for a purpose we just must press on for getting those things that are in the past pressing on towards the high calling in christ jesus press on make right what's been made wrong make right and press on don't give up don't doubt what god has done in your life we should have stayed on the other side we should have just stayed with the methodists we should have just stayed at the baptist church can you imagine that we should have stayed at the cma sister i should have stayed at the presbyterian where i was why do i why did i come over here believe it i could kill giants because you can't because you've already seen them fall stand still and see the salvation of the lord get that filth out of your life and then watch god move amen get that hidden sin out of your life and then watch the almighty move either move out there church or listen or he'll move in here right he'll either move one or the other in other words your attitude will either be moved to change i can deal with this or god will remove that obstacle out of your life one or the other many wrongs of joshua but i'm glad we do because of his love right god's love many times that shows god how god is showing you how much he loves you by correcting you satan just wants you to stay in your your guilt right he wants us you just isolated just don't come to church just stay away you're a loser there's nothing good in you but god wants to say just correct what's wrong and march on you're gonna get the victory they were just like a couple days away they were so close i mean they were so close to victory all they had to do was just just keep marching on clean out everything in our life keep marching on all these enemies will fall before you no man will stand before you all the days of your life amen that's what i saw last year brother william i had different men standing before me you know through emails and everything like that joseph branham billy paul brandon rod bergen from believe the sign last year i realized there's no man that can stand before me praise god see they're trying to bring down my faith in christ make me worship brother branham or make me doubt brother branham brother braham's a man my faith is in william branham my faith is in jesus christ if i got jesus christ i can rightly divide the word of truth i can tell who's telling the truth and who's not amen praise god you know the bible said the word is of no private interpretation but then paul tells timothy you rightly divide truth amen so in other words you're rightly dividing will be the interpretation of the holy ghost amen hallelujah i know a prophet interprets the word but then there's other questions the prophet can't do everything so that's why paul told timothy you need to still rightly divide the word of truth because satan's going to bring in more attacks but if you just stand with the holy ghost then no man as long as the captain's standing with you no man will stand before you all the days of your life amen hallelujah and brother william i asked for a meeting face to face they don't want it i asked for a phone call they don't want it but i like it that's right that's because they know they can't answer they're like the man that has no words right he comes in where's your garment i thought brother adam said billy paul was the promised joseph in 1951 brother said the third person the trinity burns in our hearts in 1952. i don't know if it's about it but see we can rightly divide it we know what's true because the spirit is our comforter praise god and he shows us things that come amen hallelujah i believe that with all my heart we must rightly divide the word the private interpretation comes from the holy ghost and i'll say this it comes privately it comes in the prayer closet because paul said study yourself approve unto god see you study with god and god shows you the revelation and you preaching to god's people amen hallelujah then you stand there like a statue amen on the word of god and no man or woman can stand before you all the days of your life that's what i found out last year we're the joshuas nobody can stand before us and chop us down chop our faith down and try to discourage us no no no no we're more than conquerors in christ jesus amen hallelujah so we see joshua's worst parts did god say joshua i'm done with you you didn't think i was going to bring you i should bring you guys over here in the problem i'm done with you joshua no god didn't god didn't give up on his servant god won't give up on you god's not giving up on you right if god is for you who can be against you the only trouble is we got against god sometimes right aching god against god we get against god when we do selfish things sometimes or we blow up our temper explodes on somebody or we say the wrong thing or we disrespect the name of god all right we're all guilty at times god have mercy on us forgive us but see god is for us right he'll never leave us never forsake us josh says we should have stayed in the same vacation we should have stayed in denomination i said brother ram said moses represented denominations that's what brother ram said the old law the old way we should have stayed out there in the wilderness oh lord verse 8 what shall i say when israel turned at their backs before their enemies well you're going to say a lot of bad things right when you lose victories when things start going bad if you're not careful you're going to say a lot of bad things you start doubting if you're saved doubting if you're filled with the holy ghost doubting if you do anything right in life satan is such an accuser by loving jesus said get behind me satan in other words get your lies out of my face praise god get behind me i'm moving forward you get out of my way i'm marching forward in jesus name get your lies and your bluffs out of my face because i don't want to talk about it i don't want to hear get behind me he told those demons in legion go he just said go and satan had to move let's speak the name of jesus and the name of jesus will move mountains praise god amen verse 9 for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us around and cut off our name from the earth what without doing to thy great name god what are you going to do everybody's going to hear about my mistake everyone's going to hear about our mistakes verse 10 and the lord that's capital l-o-r-d that's jehovah which is the which is the uh it's the pseudo name for yahweh because yahweh is the most holy name of god so they wanted to protect yahweh so they made a a kind like a name a nickname to cover that we'll just call him jehovah so this is jehovah and jehovah means the self-existent one who reveals himself so here is the self-existence is this the one who reveals himself revealing himself to joshua joshua thinks why did i even come over here what what have we done we're just going to be defeated everybody's going to think we're oh we wasted our time and the revealing one reveals joshua get up stand come on church don't lay down there stand in the promise of god stop complaining down there on your face or or thinking oh stop walling around in the muck stand up and get ready to fight man the self-existent one who reveals himself reveals it's not my will that you lay there and complain about what's going on says so [Applause] defeat me because i feed myself the wrong things i need the plans i need i only exist it'll be their job i don't exist on my own but god exists on his own he don't need anything and the one who says i don't need anything says get up why are you lying on your face so he spends all these hours how many hours do we waste worrying about things he said all these hours word on facebook said get up why are you laying there like that you're a general the captain's with you you've already defeated jericho you've already come to a river you're and you already crossed the red sea why would you lie there remember when i'm done amen remember who i am remember whose side you're on break god don't lie there complaining this is just what israel did before they just complained all the time god said you're not coming in here he is complaining god said don't complain get up israel has sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant so see there's conditions every promise just like the brown bear brother ram didn't meet the conditions but the brown bear is still there you got to meet the conditions of the word praise god it was done saith the lord if you meet the conditions praise god does not say the lord i can defeat ai i can defeat jericho i can defeat every enemy as long as i keep the word of god if if i keep the word of god i can be healed if i obey the word i can be i can uh be used by god for miracles if i obey the word of god praise god i can overcome this addiction if i obey the word of god oh that great word if it's so small but it's so great if you must meet the conditions see you've sinned you've transgressed my covenant for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turn their acts before their enemies because they were cursed neither will i be with you anymore except you destroy the accursed thing from among you wow so what's like one strike and there goes the anointing isn't that what it's like for us too we can be walking obedience one little bad joke one little gossip one little bad video one little bad text right there goes the anointing where up here not here this one cannot sin right he said john said you have a seed that cannot sin and then he says earlier he said he said any man that says he don't sin is a liar but then he says you've got a seed that cannot sin so your soul doesn't send but this guy appears sins that's why the bible said grieve not the holy spirit of god offend not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed even to the day of your redemption but just as quickly as it leaves church it can quickly come back amen hallelujah he said you aren't going to one more victory until you get this sin out of the camp that's why churches don't go on to victories that's many times why they're sick don't get healed because they still got sin laying there amongst the church i've always prayed this and i'm going to keep praying this lord if there's any sin in our church either help them confess or send them out of our church because i don't want to be a church that stays behind and gets no victories i want to be a church that marches forward and possesses the promises of god our finances go down big deal as long as i got jesus praise god as long as jesus is here that's the most important thing right that's the most important thing we just want jesus christ here we want him magnified we want to be overcomers we want to see the power of god we want to be faithful and we want to see him back up his covenant amen the new covenant the new covenant the new testament in my blood amen may the blood of christ always clean out our church amen that's right sin breaks the covenant power of victory they didn't ask god about it they had self-confidence oh we'll just go down to ai no problem i'll just easily overcome this person i'll just go rebuke them real quick you know and then they'll have something ready for you to rebuke you make you look bad make you look selfish because your pride i'll just easily go take care of this that's no problem no pray before you go pray before you make a decision see ai exposes joshua's attitude just like job's trials exposed his wrong attitudes i preach on that at the beginning of the year brother william i was so amazed i never seen all of job's faults he had so many good things but he also had so many bad things he was overcome with fear he said i was at ease he was laodicean at ease and there were so many other ones oh he thought he was equal with god he's like i'm righteous and god's unrighteous the bible actually says that he thought he was right and he thought god was wrong now that's big time pride right there but did god was god with him still did god forgive him absolutely after a great rebuke see our trials are testing us and they're showing us what's inside of us now you know the story i'll just hit a few highlights no more victories unless you get this sin out of your life that's why that's why brother brown says wherever you leave god you gotta go right back there gotta go right back there then joshua says up and i'm sorry god says in verse 13 up sanctify the people sanctify yourselves against tomorrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of the o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until they take away the cursing from among you now we know he brings the family of judah and then uh achan comes look at verse 20. and they can answer joshua said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done when i saw look at what what got him the lust of the eyes he saw these things the spoils of a goodly babylonish garment and 200 shackles of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shackles away and i covered them and took them so close coins and then a wedge of gold those three clothes is that worth it would that be worth it remember god said everything in jericho's mine he said but all the other places you can spoil all that but not this first one this was all mine so see aiken was doing the same thing that eli sons did they took god's fat god's portion no the fat was for god but eli and his sons are like no no we'll eat that that's ours and the people got them said like that's god's part you can't take god's part and what happened to those two boys they got killed just like aiken got killed so you never take god's part you don't take god's glory right you don't take credit for anything i was just the tool he i was just the glove he put his hand in the glove has no power of its own praise god i have no power of my own like jesus said the son can do nothing of himself but he doeth that which the father showeth him amen and that's what we do we do what the father shows us or puts in our hearts it's all glory to god amen we're the i'm sorry he's the potter we're the clay i'm just the clay see he saw it just like uh just like those sons of eli they saw something that was good that was god's and they took that to themselves and all three died it's important church that we watch our attitudes how many want to watch your attitude praise god bye so joshua didn't need that how many hour long prayer meeting which it wasn't much of a prayer he just needed to get the sin out of the camp right and may god give us grace when we've done wrong that we can just go get the sin out of our lives and get back to god right just get back to being right with god see aiken is just like ananias and sapphira in the new testament right what's the first battle that the saints have ananias and sapphira lying to god see they're freshly filled with the holy ghost they freshly crossed over jordan and they come to this first example where these oh i'm going to sell some of my land and give it so everybody's not poor and everybody can have something in the church and then and i send the fire come by and they lie and say well we sold it for this and that and peter said because you lied to the holy ghost these men are going to pack you out of here and he died right there right after freshly being a brand new church just after coming over jordan right crossing over jordan in the spiritual promised land so see how god deals with this church see how god he's so interested in our constant honesty he's interested in all the words we say remember the bible said all idol words will be judged then the only way to do that is to say lord i'm sorry for my idol words and then you won't be judged right because we all i we all uh utter idol words the only way to get rid of those is say jesus forgive me forgive me for saying such foolish things god forgive me and help me to say uh words season with grace next time let me not be a tail bearer tattletailer complainer prideful boaster let me not be a reviler god forgive me help me to speak the truth in love that don't cause someone to stumble in the church praise god now we know what happened look all this over some clothes some change and a and a big hunk of uh income for the futures a savings account we'd say he just did it all for some spending money with the shekels and this this long-term investment well here's my here's my retirement savings right here this big wedge of gone brother william they do the same thing today they sell out the message for a retirement fund fans are looking close better better looking church a little bit of extra spending money they sell out the word of god for these temporary things that don't mean nothing what is your babylonian garment what's your fancy clothes going to do on the day of judgment nothing they won't be there what's your money going to get you on the day of judgment nothing unless they're you're getting blessings from giving it to help out people provide for your family right all those things this was all so temporary but because of his eyes he didn't have his eyes strained to the word of god and his ears right don't take anything don't take anything oh it's just i gotta have it and where'd he bury it in his house he buried it in his house and church that's a lot of things let me just close with this you can stop the livestream i'm just going to say a few things here god bless the livestreamers church
