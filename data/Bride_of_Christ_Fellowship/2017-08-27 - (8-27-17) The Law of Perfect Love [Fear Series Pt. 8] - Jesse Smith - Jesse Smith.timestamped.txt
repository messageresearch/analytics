[52:18] this morning the Lord of All Saints we
[52:23] see the Saints this morning I've
[52:25] increased the Lord first John 4:17 to
[52:29] preach on the law of perfect love this
[52:31] for this is part 10 in our fear series
[52:34] the law of perfect love first John 4:17
[52:48] 1st John 4:17
[53:02] isn't the Lord wonderful praise God
[53:05] isn't he worthy of all your praise
[53:07] hallelujah it's worthy to be a living
[53:12] sacrifice
[53:14] what a great faithful God we serve this
[53:16] morning verse John 4:17 verse 17 says
[53:31] herein is our love made perfect that we
[53:34] may have boldness in the Day of Judgment
[53:36] because as he is so are we in this world
[53:43] there is no fear in love but perfect
[53:47] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[53:53] torment he that feareth is not made
[53:56] perfect in love we love him because he
[54:01] first loved us if a man say I love God
[54:05] or I believe the message and hated this
[54:08] brother he's the liar for he that loveth
[54:12] not his brother whom he has seen how can
[54:14] he love God whom he hath not seen and
[54:17] this commandment have we from him that
[54:21] he who loveth God love his brother also
[54:27] amen how many appreciate the Lord's word
[54:29] that's that word of Prayer if we have a
[54:30] need on your heart just making on into
[54:32] God as we approach his holy throne have
[54:36] any father we approach your throne Lord
[54:39] I was reading yesterday Lord in
[54:42] revelation 5 and reminded again of the
[54:46] seven lamps around your throne the seven
[54:50] spirits of God also 24 elders wearing
[54:56] crowns also four beasts with six wings
[55:03] that fly and cry holy holy is the Lord
[55:07] God Almighty which was and isn't is to
[55:09] come and on top of that innumerable
[55:14] company of angels all round about the
[55:19] throne we also know there's Devils that
[55:23] come and accuse us before the throne of
[55:25] God day and night the Bible said Lord
[55:30] our love for you
[55:32] constrains us Lord God to believe that
[55:35] Christ Jesus as our high priest is able
[55:39] to make intercession for us this morning
[55:41] father you know the needs on the
[55:43] people's hearts Lord I don't know all
[55:45] needs Lord God surely as a pastor I know
[55:48] certain things Lord God when people
[55:50] share them with me and Lord I'll burden
[55:53] for those and we pray for those but lord
[55:55] I just pray you to meet all the needs
[55:56] Lord God may you speak Lord to us from
[56:01] thy throne Lord God that has always been
[56:03] your plan to have a fivefold ministry
[56:06] that would bring the people to
[56:08] perfection Lord God to bring us to a
[56:11] unity of faith Lord God under the
[56:16] stature of the fullness of Christ Lord
[56:19] bring your people to this place Lord I
[56:21] know you will not Jesus I know you will
[56:24] for you promised and your word is is
[56:28] unfailing as you are Lord God it's as
[56:31] alive as you are Lord God so let your
[56:34] eternal words speak to us this morning
[56:36] father help me to yield to thy spirit in
[56:39] Jesus Christ lovely name
[56:41] the church said Amen god bless she was
[56:44] being seated there praise the Lord
[56:51] Malak I do have some quotes so we can
[56:53] bring up the slide here but I like to
[57:00] look at the law of perfect love this
[57:02] morning grace of the Lord and have some
[57:05] quotes for you I have all the quotes up
[57:08] here except the end the last thought I
[57:09] want to bring in I want to I want to end
[57:11] with the law of perfect love so I want
[57:13] to just bring a little review and then I
[57:15] want to take some time on the law
[57:16] perfect love so I don't have those
[57:18] quotes for you so you just have to
[57:19] listen to me at the end by God's grace I
[57:22] don't have any of those who didn't have
[57:23] time to get those ready by the grace of
[57:25] the Lord
[57:27] but let's look remember the effects of
[57:29] fear fear proves you don't believe if we
[57:33] have fear so we might believe other
[57:36] promises of God but if there's a certain
[57:39] promise we were having trouble or not
[57:42] not believing it because we're afraid of
[57:45] something that proves we don't believe
[57:46] that promise in particular how many
[57:48] wanna believe all the promises of God
[57:50] you've proud you've believed the promise
[57:52] to be baptized in the Lord Jesus
[57:54] Christ's name and thank God for that
[57:56] we're very grateful for that but there's
[57:58] more promises than just acts 2:38 we
[58:01] know there's more promises that's an
[58:03] important promise the Prophet said that
[58:05] was probably the Apostles Creed when
[58:07] they preached acts 2:38 but when we fear
[58:11] a certain promise it proves we don't
[58:13] believe the promise yet we must have
[58:15] perfect love for every promise Amen fear
[58:18] keeps people out of their inheritance
[58:20] they never even on this earth they never
[58:24] achieve what they're they're longing to
[58:26] achieve they never quite gain the
[58:30] possessions of God they've felt like
[58:32] they should possess because of fear fear
[58:36] is selfish fear only thinks about
[58:39] yourself it never thinks about others
[58:41] fear makes someone useless in God's army
[58:44] I want to be a useful tool for God in
[58:48] this kingdom I want to be a tool that
[58:49] God can trust and say well I know
[58:51] Jesse's gonna live a consecrated life I
[58:54] know he's gonna put the word above
[58:55] everything else I know he's gonna seek
[58:58] me first all of his days and I want to
[58:59] be a tool that if God wants to use me he
[59:01] knows right where I am I'm not wandering
[59:03] off into different temptations and
[59:05] things of the world but I'm right where
[59:07] I'm supposed to be right at my post of
[59:09] duty amen and God can look down and use
[59:12] me in his army at any time
[59:15] fear is prophetic as well for it brings
[59:19] on what the person fears we saw that
[59:22] fear allows sin to spread in the church
[59:25] it doesn't bring it to a halt fear will
[59:29] confront sin fear will confront
[59:32] disobedience fear will confront
[59:34] irreverence
[59:37] I'm sorry faith will confront
[59:39] irreverence
[59:40] fear will accept it fear will take it in
[59:43] but faith will confront it and faith
[59:46] will drive it out amen fear actually
[59:49] feeds all the racism in this world its
[59:52] sphere that does that and fear
[59:55] ultimately destroys Souls like the man
[1:00:00] with the one talent he had a god-given
[1:00:01] talent a god-given gift we'd say like
[1:00:03] Judas and his talent was to be a real
[1:00:06] apostle but he never received his
[1:00:08] inheritance MA he never walked in the
[1:00:10] inheritance of that calling because he
[1:00:12] sold it out for money and how many
[1:00:14] people sell it out like brother Ram said
[1:00:16] Elvis for a fleet of Cadillacs
[1:00:18] how many will sell out a genuine talent
[1:00:21] of God even if it just one it's still
[1:00:23] valuable to God how many will sell that
[1:00:25] out just for worldly possessions and
[1:00:27] bury that talent in the things of the
[1:00:29] world and ultimately because of fear and
[1:00:32] fear destroy souls the Bible says
[1:00:36] remember that David overcame fear by the
[1:00:40] following first he had a revelation of
[1:00:42] the will of God that's the first step
[1:00:45] you must know the will of God you must
[1:00:47] know what God's Word said then we must
[1:00:51] ignore family like he ignored his
[1:00:53] brother Church critics like King Saul
[1:00:56] and then you must recall God has done it
[1:01:00] before and God will do it again and we
[1:01:04] must speak twice as much about God as we
[1:01:07] do about the devil or the trial that
[1:01:09] we're going because that's what David
[1:01:10] did six times he mentioned God you only
[1:01:12] mentioned Goliath three times and then
[1:01:16] he hastened to the fight he wasn't a
[1:01:18] procrastinator
[1:01:19] well I'll fight him tomorrow or maybe
[1:01:22] I'll fight him next week I don't know if
[1:01:23] I fight him at all he didn't
[1:01:25] procrastinate but the Bible said he ran
[1:01:27] to the fight he took that devil face to
[1:01:31] face a man he took him on hallelujah
[1:01:33] because of this he had the revelation
[1:01:35] God's Word and a few weeks ago we saw
[1:01:39] what the inhabitants represented for us
[1:01:42] we must have once we're in the baptism
[1:01:45] of the Holy Ghost now these things of
[1:01:47] course can kill people before they're in
[1:01:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if
[1:01:51] we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] we must drive these out
[1:01:54] the love of money we must drive out fear
[1:01:57] we must drive out compromising or
[1:02:00] friendship with the world we must drive
[1:02:01] out carnal mindedness division strife
[1:02:05] and envy we must drive out double-minded
[1:02:08] instability we must drive out fleshly
[1:02:11] lusts like adultery's and sensual lusts
[1:02:13] of the mind and so forth like that and
[1:02:15] we must drive out complexes amen
[1:02:18] any stronghold in our mind that hinders
[1:02:21] our service toward God God gave us the
[1:02:24] Commission you drive it out and you'll
[1:02:26] drive it out by the power of my love
[1:02:27] amen that's how we'll drive it out and
[1:02:30] last Sunday we saw exactly how we
[1:02:33] narrowed in on a few quotes and things
[1:02:35] we already know but but important for us
[1:02:38] that we must hold the sword of the word
[1:02:40] with a strong hand of faith that's how
[1:02:42] we're gonna drive it out I'll never
[1:02:45] forget this in fact I got it right in
[1:02:48] front of me December 4th I preached the
[1:02:50] key to the door and I wrote down the
[1:02:52] promise that I was claiming and I still
[1:02:54] quote that promise amen
[1:02:55] we're gonna have a church with the
[1:02:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:03:00] I believe that amen I'm holding on to
[1:03:02] that Joel 2 23 through 26 with all the
[1:03:05] strength in my hand for the matter said
[1:03:07] some people just got strong enough faith
[1:03:08] to cut out baptism or cut out
[1:03:10] sanctification but we ought to have
[1:03:12] faith that we can cut out the baptism of
[1:03:14] the holy ghost and then cut out our
[1:03:16] possession or our inheritance and drive
[1:03:19] out all fear and all doubt and all
[1:03:21] complex and all worldliness we ought to
[1:03:24] drive all that out so the Spirit of God
[1:03:25] can feel welcome every time we come to
[1:03:27] this house hey man that's a strong hand
[1:03:31] of faith hallelujah but we're gonna have
[1:03:34] to battle for that I'm gonna have to
[1:03:35] take every step of that one step at a
[1:03:37] time
[1:03:38] little by little service after service
[1:03:39] year after year but I'm in this battle
[1:03:42] for the long haul praise God if others
[1:03:45] fall away that's fine they might not
[1:03:46] have the strong enough hands to do it
[1:03:48] but I'm called of God to do that and our
[1:03:50] strong hand of faith will accomplish all
[1:03:52] that God has called me to accomplish
[1:03:53] amen glory we must then brother and say
[1:03:59] we must go forward believing God's Word
[1:04:02] is your personal property God invites
[1:04:05] you into his variety store like we say a
[1:04:07] Sam's Club and he
[1:04:08] to get whatever you want no matter if
[1:04:10] it's on the second level third level
[1:04:12] just go up and get it but you've got to
[1:04:14] go get an amen
[1:04:15] it's your personal property that's what
[1:04:17] program said drives out the inhabitants
[1:04:20] when you take God's Word as your
[1:04:23] possession
[1:04:23] this word is mine amen it might not be
[1:04:27] for everybody else but it's mine amen
[1:04:29] and that's driving out the inhabitants
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:32] number three brother Ram told that woman
[1:04:35] who had she said she never had a day of
[1:04:37] peace even had a night of rest of peace
[1:04:41] in her entire life and brother man told
[1:04:43] her in Louisiana there at the miserable
[1:04:44] Union he said you must go and deny that
[1:04:47] you ever had it amen
[1:04:49] they said and that will drive out the
[1:04:52] inhabitants he said you got to drive
[1:04:54] that out he said you must go
[1:04:56] deny it Amen so we in other words we
[1:04:59] must walk by faith and not by sight
[1:05:02] hallelujah that is actually driving it
[1:05:05] out and you must say it with your words
[1:05:07] you must believe it in your heart
[1:05:09] confess it with your lips and God will
[1:05:11] honor that as high priest he'll bring
[1:05:13] that to pass amen and then he said go
[1:05:16] forward this kind of goes up ties it
[1:05:18] with you know the second one go forward
[1:05:20] thanking God for being healed or filled
[1:05:22] or whatever you want
[1:05:23] you must go forward deny what you had or
[1:05:26] what you thought you had and thank him
[1:05:27] going forward knowing he's going to give
[1:05:29] it to you I mean love the Lord that's
[1:05:32] what the prophet of God teaches on
[1:05:34] inhabitants I looked up every time where
[1:05:35] the man said he might chebbi Zeit
[1:05:37] perizzite you name that but through all
[1:05:40] those and that's what he said that's how
[1:05:42] you drive out the inhabitants I'm glad I
[1:05:45] can drive out the inhabitants Amen by
[1:05:47] the grace of the Lord we closed last
[1:05:49] week with this little chart that we are
[1:05:51] going to live in one of the other we're
[1:05:52] they're gonna walk in the light of faith
[1:05:54] which is motivated by love or we're
[1:05:57] gonna walk in unbelief brother Branham
[1:06:01] said unbelief is the chief of all devils
[1:06:04] the chief it is the most powerful devil
[1:06:08] to try to anoint somebody to disbelieve
[1:06:11] God's Word the chief the hardest demon
[1:06:15] to deal with and try to talk sense into
[1:06:17] somebody is a religious spirit man said
[1:06:20] they're the Pharisees they'll go to
[1:06:21] church
[1:06:22] but you can't teach them nothing I think
[1:06:23] we're in danger many times of religious
[1:06:25] spirits don't you think we know all
[1:06:28] about it we don't need more of God we've
[1:06:30] got all that we need
[1:06:31] shame on that kind of attitude that's a
[1:06:33] religious demon amen and we've got to
[1:06:36] drive that out of our lives amen
[1:06:38] I know all about it and I'm not gonna
[1:06:40] let the Holy Spirit move anymore I've
[1:06:42] done all enough in my life and all these
[1:06:44] things like that
[1:06:45] we should one more brother man looked at
[1:06:46] age 50 and said I haven't done anything
[1:06:48] for the Lord I gotta do something before
[1:06:50] I pass if he thought that at age 50 what
[1:06:53] should we feel amen we should feel
[1:06:56] there's more for me to do there must be
[1:06:57] more Souls out there I want to win more
[1:06:59] souls for Christ amen or win one so or
[1:07:03] when two souls win somebody to Jesus
[1:07:05] Christ hallelujah
[1:07:06] then brother Branham said this stress
[1:07:09] and nervousness is the worst feeling
[1:07:11] anyone could have which is we talked
[1:07:14] about oppression depression distress
[1:07:18] nervousness all these follow the banner
[1:07:21] of unbelief these are all attributes of
[1:07:23] unbelief there's only one sin that's
[1:07:25] unbelief amen but there's a demon of
[1:07:27] course the religious spirit there's a
[1:07:29] demon to distress and oppression and
[1:07:31] depression and nervousness and all these
[1:07:33] things and then the Prophet said fear is
[1:07:35] the greatest thing against the church so
[1:07:38] of all these demons the one demon that
[1:07:41] battles the church as a whole Universal
[1:07:44] is the spirit of fear and he said fear
[1:07:48] accompanies doubt the Prophet tells us
[1:07:51] that how many understand this by the
[1:07:54] grace of Lord but love drives out all of
[1:07:57] these when we love God it'll drive out
[1:08:00] every religious demon it'll drive out
[1:08:03] any distress any nervousness any fear if
[1:08:05] when we have love in our hearts and
[1:08:07] surely it's a full love of God it drives
[1:08:10] out all that love and faith and unbelief
[1:08:14] cannot exist at the same time we've got
[1:08:17] to have one near the other and I ask you
[1:08:18] what but what atmosphere are you sitting
[1:08:21] in this morning I trust it's an
[1:08:22] atmosphere of faith amen
[1:08:24] love of God because this is an awful
[1:08:28] existence this is an awful romance that
[1:08:31] you'll be disappointed with Christianity
[1:08:33] if you live with these kind of spirits
[1:08:35] you'll be
[1:08:35] disappointed in it he said what you
[1:08:37] constantly have to stay at Calvary amen
[1:08:40] and remember in the blood of Jesus
[1:08:42] Christ and all it's done for us we don't
[1:08:44] want to be disappointed we want to be
[1:08:46] fulfilled in our walk we want to be
[1:08:48] satisfied with Christ amen we want to be
[1:08:50] dissatisfied with the world and we want
[1:08:52] to be satisfied with the blood of Jesus
[1:08:54] Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:57] I want to go to this here's a new
[1:09:00] thought now brother Graham said
[1:09:02] mankind's greatest fear has already been
[1:09:05] conquered so the greatest battle against
[1:09:09] the church's fear but brother Branham
[1:09:10] said out of all the fears the greatest
[1:09:15] one has already been conquered and we
[1:09:16] know they all been conquered let's look
[1:09:18] at this from in-person personation of
[1:09:20] Christianity when's Adams rate the
[1:09:22] children of Adam was backed into a
[1:09:24] corner death and sickness on every hand
[1:09:26] sin crowding in the law had failed the
[1:09:30] prophets had failed everything had
[1:09:31] failed they had refused they were in
[1:09:33] such a muddle diseases and ignorance and
[1:09:35] so forth had just collapsed them into a
[1:09:38] place so there was no hope left and
[1:09:39] there said Adams rapes quivering shaking
[1:09:42] nothing could be done hair was opening
[1:09:46] up her bosom to swallow them up and in
[1:09:50] glory someone stepped out the Son of God
[1:09:52] I'll go down father I'll become one of
[1:09:55] them I'll go down what will you do to
[1:09:59] the Angels and Jesus said watch amen
[1:10:03] hallelujah
[1:10:04] so you take the four thousand years of
[1:10:06] history and every prophet would go down
[1:10:08] in fear
[1:10:09] remember job fear death remember he all
[1:10:12] that he feared came upon him and job
[1:10:14] looked and he got an inspiration but I
[1:10:16] know my Redeemer liveth he got a
[1:10:18] revelation that he would live again amen
[1:10:20] but before this they went down and down
[1:10:24] and down and God
[1:10:25] here sends Christ and Christ says I'll
[1:10:27] go down I'll become one of them and I'll
[1:10:30] conquer fear but when I said one day
[1:10:33] down there among the sons of men he
[1:10:35] looked down through the greatest dread
[1:10:37] that man had which was death and he
[1:10:44] raised his arms and went to a place
[1:10:45] called Calvary he plunged himself into
[1:10:48] the darkest mix that
[1:10:49] never feared which was death and
[1:10:51] conquered it and he ascended up on high
[1:10:53] he never sent down a declaration of
[1:10:55] theological faith but he sent back the
[1:10:58] Holy Spirit and said take this and fight
[1:11:02] with everything you've got
[1:11:03] within you praise God take this and
[1:11:06] follow me as the father sent me so send
[1:11:09] I you
[1:11:10] so Jesus came down from heaven to
[1:11:14] destroy man's greatest fear which was
[1:11:17] death and then after Jesus raised he
[1:11:20] said I'm gonna give you the Holy Spirit
[1:11:21] and now with the Holy Spirit inside of
[1:11:23] you fight with everything you've got by
[1:11:26] the seal of God by the baptism of the
[1:11:29] Holy Ghost in your soul amen so I move
[1:11:33] this up I move fear up now fear is our
[1:11:35] greatest action now we might fear
[1:11:37] poverty or sickness but the greatest
[1:11:40] fear brother Branham said was death he
[1:11:43] said the greatest tread man had was
[1:11:46] death I never thought about death I
[1:11:49] never thought about your death we see it
[1:11:51] all the time we prayed for it this week
[1:11:53] we see how death comes so suddenly many
[1:11:57] times I was praying yesterday here on my
[1:11:59] knees you say Lord my life is such a
[1:12:01] vapor help me to redeem the time and do
[1:12:04] everything I can in my little vapor of
[1:12:06] life amen there's been times I've feared
[1:12:09] death there's been times we all fear
[1:12:11] death but death was the greatest of all
[1:12:14] the fears you might fear other things
[1:12:16] but death was the greatest the Prophet
[1:12:19] said even amongst the prophets of Joseph
[1:12:22] and Moses and all these prophets death
[1:12:25] was the greatest fear and the Prophet
[1:12:27] said every principality and power he
[1:12:29] tore down and spoiled at his crucifixion
[1:12:33] and resurrection he broke through the
[1:12:36] veil of sin he tore it apart with the
[1:12:39] high priest blood of his own body he
[1:12:42] come to the next what was it the veil of
[1:12:44] sickness that held over the people he
[1:12:47] tore it apart sorry can you picture
[1:12:50] Jesus doing that tearing this veil
[1:12:52] there's a veil of sin he tears the veil
[1:12:54] there's a veil of sickness he tears the
[1:12:57] veil he's breaking through every veil
[1:13:00] brother Ram said to get down to Satan's
[1:13:02] headquarters
[1:13:03] right he toured apart for he was wounded
[1:13:06] for our transgressions and with his
[1:13:07] stripes we were healed
[1:13:09] he went through the great vale yonder of
[1:13:11] sickness the great veil of sin he went
[1:13:13] through the great veil of worry I'm
[1:13:16] never battle worried it's just the form
[1:13:18] of fear it's a form of fear you're
[1:13:20] worried about this why are you worried
[1:13:22] about it because we don't have faith
[1:13:23] about it he went through the great veil
[1:13:26] of fear he tore every one of them down
[1:13:30] and ascended so high and received the
[1:13:32] name above every name that's named in
[1:13:34] the heavens above or the earth below or
[1:13:36] in the world to come aren't you glad
[1:13:38] about that church every mail every sheet
[1:13:41] that seemed like oh there's just a sheet
[1:13:43] between God and I or Christ tonight
[1:13:45] there's a sheet of sin sickness fear
[1:13:48] worry there's all these veils separating
[1:13:51] us from God and Christ went through and
[1:13:54] broken through every one of them that
[1:13:56] ought to make us rejoice amen but they
[1:13:58] have said this marvelous great bridge as
[1:14:00] my color friends used to sing it's a
[1:14:02] highway to heavens we're walking up the
[1:14:04] Kings Highway which I love to sing
[1:14:05] surely all over Jesus has finished
[1:14:07] everything's completed Jesus would have
[1:14:10] not sat down in heaven if he had not
[1:14:12] have completed the work no man sets down
[1:14:15] until his job is over amen
[1:14:17] that's right when Jesus took his blood
[1:14:19] and went through the heaven of heaven
[1:14:21] and condemned every devil took the keys
[1:14:25] of death and hell and sat down aren't
[1:14:28] you glad amen every devil he condemned I
[1:14:31] I dramatized it a few years ago when I
[1:14:33] preached it but he condemned scoliosis
[1:14:35] he condemned tuberculosis amen he
[1:14:38] condemned cancer he condemned lust he
[1:14:41] condemned greed he condemned every devil
[1:14:43] he tore through every veil and he took
[1:14:46] the keys of hell and death and he took
[1:14:48] the keys of death because that was our
[1:14:49] greatest fear but now Christ holds the
[1:14:52] keys amen and when he looked over the
[1:14:55] earth he saw the greatest fear man had
[1:14:57] was death he ran to a certain place
[1:15:02] called Calvary and there he caught death
[1:15:04] in his bosom a man and he ascended up up
[1:15:07] and he said you wait over yonder until
[1:15:09] your endued with power from on high
[1:15:11] he sent back the Holy Ghost and said
[1:15:13] follow me and fight with everything you
[1:15:15] got within you
[1:15:17] and brother this is God's Word which is
[1:15:20] sharper than a two-edged sword it's the
[1:15:22] greatest power that was ever put in
[1:15:24] man's hand and gods expecting Adams race
[1:15:28] to put sin and sickness and all kinds of
[1:15:31] Devils to the fighting walls that's
[1:15:34] right we've got the most powerful weapon
[1:15:36] there is God's expecting the Bride of
[1:15:40] Christ to use the Holy Spirit that's
[1:15:42] with inside of them to put all these
[1:15:45] sicknesses under their feet to drive
[1:15:47] them back and possess the full
[1:15:49] inheritance of a son and daughter of God
[1:15:52] amen and he gave us the most powerful
[1:15:55] weapon which is the Word of God amen
[1:15:59] notice what the Bible said about Jesus
[1:16:01] Jesus destroyed him that had the power
[1:16:05] of death that is the devil Jesus did
[1:16:09] that remember of the word destroy there
[1:16:11] doesn't mean to annihilate it means to
[1:16:13] stop the influence so the Bible said
[1:16:16] Jesus destroyed or stopped the influence
[1:16:19] of the devil and that he had the power
[1:16:22] of death he stopped his influence so
[1:16:25] Satan before it could take every person
[1:16:27] you know he could take a Moses he could
[1:16:28] take the Elijah he could take all the
[1:16:31] Adam and Eve he could take all of them
[1:16:33] but when Jesus conquered death now he
[1:16:35] had power over death amen now his
[1:16:39] influence would be above Satan's
[1:16:41] influence amen he was getting the power
[1:16:43] back that he once had that Adam lost we
[1:16:47] know that and remember second Peter gave
[1:16:50] us the law that Adam lost from whom a
[1:16:53] man is overcome of the same is he
[1:16:56] brought in bondage
[1:16:57] Adam had the power the spoken word when
[1:16:59] he was sinless to do whatever he wanted
[1:17:01] but as soon as he was overcome as soon
[1:17:04] as he gave in to the serpent what
[1:17:06] happened was Satan took full possession
[1:17:08] of of the property of individuals
[1:17:10] because he deceived Adams race now he's
[1:17:12] got a certain power over them the power
[1:17:14] of death but the Bible said though that
[1:17:18] even though death conquered Adam we know
[1:17:20] the second Adam conquered death amen
[1:17:22] glory to him that overcometh will I
[1:17:25] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:17:27] as I also overcame
[1:17:30] and I'm sat down with my father in his
[1:17:33] throne so even though the first Adam was
[1:17:36] overcome we know the second Adam
[1:17:38] overcame death amen hail and the grave
[1:17:41] and Satan in every temptation he ripped
[1:17:44] through every veil and now gives us the
[1:17:46] privilege of receiving all God's
[1:17:48] inheritance for us amen
[1:17:50] and considering death we no longer fear
[1:17:54] death Christians should never fear death
[1:17:56] because the Bible said it's precious
[1:17:58] death is precious in the sight of the
[1:18:02] Lord of his Saints it's a precious thing
[1:18:06] when God calls an old servant of God
[1:18:10] home it's a precious thing when God
[1:18:12] calls a middle-aged servant of God home
[1:18:14] it's a precious thing when God calls a
[1:18:16] little child a little servant child when
[1:18:19] it calls him home the Bible said
[1:18:21] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:18:24] death of his Saints you believe that
[1:18:25] this morning
[1:18:26] Luke 1622 look how precious it is it's
[1:18:31] so precious the Bible said that when the
[1:18:33] beggar died he was carried by Angels
[1:18:37] into Abraham's bosom I remember when I
[1:18:39] passed out at Waterloo and Kevin and
[1:18:41] John carried me out to the emergency car
[1:18:43] do you guys remember that I passed out I
[1:18:45] felt like I was getting carried there's
[1:18:47] been times and sports people had carried
[1:18:49] me around you know if I won the race or
[1:18:50] something like that there's been a few
[1:18:52] times have been carried around because
[1:18:53] of great events or maybe sad events but
[1:18:56] one thing's for sure
[1:18:57] God is so God is so pleased when his
[1:19:01] faithful servants come home the Bible
[1:19:03] said he carries them with angel hands
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:06] angels pack and bring the the believer
[1:19:10] into the dimension of God and the Bible
[1:19:14] said there carried by the Angels don't
[1:19:16] you love the Lord amen
[1:19:19] Stephen was so full of the Holy Ghost he
[1:19:22] looks up to heaven before he stoned and
[1:19:24] the Bible said Jesus is standing on the
[1:19:27] right hand of the Father brother Adam
[1:19:28] said he gave Stephen salute as the
[1:19:30] five-star general he gives us a soldier
[1:19:33] as faithful soldier a standing salute as
[1:19:35] he enters into the heavenly dimensions
[1:19:38] amen beautiful because Paul said this we
[1:19:43] are confident
[1:19:44] say and willing rather to be absent from
[1:19:47] the body and to be present with the Lord
[1:19:50] Paul said Christians many times would
[1:19:52] rather be absent from this world and
[1:19:54] they'd rather be present with the Spirit
[1:19:56] of the Lord how many understand that
[1:19:57] life is very difficult life is a trial
[1:20:00] but we don't have to lay over and give
[1:20:03] up we can be more than conquerors amen
[1:20:05] but there's a part of us that know
[1:20:07] there's we're longing for that that
[1:20:09] theophany body we're longing for that
[1:20:12] glorified body we're longing for perfect
[1:20:14] peace we're longing for perfect love
[1:20:16] amen we're longing for for perfection
[1:20:19] times perfection times perfection we're
[1:20:21] longing for those things and the Bible
[1:20:23] said we were to desire that we're really
[1:20:25] rather to be present with the Lord
[1:20:29] remember what Paul said it's better than
[1:20:31] I stay here so I can minister to you
[1:20:33] that's what he told the Philippians and
[1:20:35] the Corinthians I believe he said that
[1:20:38] so death is precious
[1:20:40] it was the most fearful thing but now
[1:20:43] there's no fear and death amen the Bible
[1:20:46] said I'm he that liveth and was dead and
[1:20:47] behold I am Alive for evermore amen and
[1:20:50] have the keys of hell and of death
[1:20:54] praise the Lord I mentioned this last
[1:20:58] week and brother Bosworth who just went
[1:21:00] home and glory huh me note F F Bosworth
[1:21:03] greatest greatest saint of the day as I
[1:21:07] know what a compliment from the prophet
[1:21:10] of God this is in 1958 the greatest
[1:21:14] saint of the day as I know a member he
[1:21:17] retired from preaching and he was
[1:21:20] stopping preaching until he was 75 years
[1:21:22] old and then he heard brother Branham
[1:21:24] preach he ministered for nine more years
[1:21:26] and he said they were his nine years of
[1:21:28] ministry were better than his previous
[1:21:29] 40 hallelujah amen God has a time and
[1:21:33] season for all things how many believe
[1:21:35] that but see he had to be willing to
[1:21:37] leave the comfort of his retirement to
[1:21:40] do something for the kingdom of God to
[1:21:42] follow the new revived or the new
[1:21:44] inspiration so we can't say well I'm 50
[1:21:46] we're I'm 40 I'm 65 and I just can't do
[1:21:49] nothing more for the Lord we can't say
[1:21:51] that even in our day God raised up a 75
[1:21:54] year old man to preach nine more years
[1:21:56] and experience the great
[1:21:57] nine years of his life church there's
[1:22:00] hope for you and I this morning amen
[1:22:01] Christ has conquered death hell and the
[1:22:03] grave there's confidence we can have in
[1:22:05] Christ if we just believe his word glory
[1:22:10] the greatest saint of the day as I know
[1:22:13] I don't know how that's a tremendous
[1:22:14] compliment from a prophet of God I still
[1:22:19] got two copies of that Christ the healer
[1:22:21] if anybody wants the copy by God's grace
[1:22:22] he went home to meet Jesus the other day
[1:22:25] was in his 80s 84 he said later unquote
[1:22:28] he's at home tonight before he died
[1:22:31] about an hour and this is recorded by F
[1:22:33] F Bosworth son in the in the
[1:22:36] introduction what's it called the
[1:22:37] preface of the book of Christ the healer
[1:22:39] his son records this and this book has
[1:22:43] over a half a million print copies that
[1:22:46] are in print and it might have been more
[1:22:49] than an hour I'd probably to look in the
[1:22:50] book right after get done preaching
[1:22:52] before he died about an hour he went to
[1:22:54] a coma and raised up so he raised this
[1:22:58] up he's in the coma he raises up and he
[1:23:00] begins shaking hands with the people he
[1:23:02] preached two years ago that's been gone
[1:23:04] just rejoicing and praising God saying I
[1:23:07] haven't seen you for years a man in a
[1:23:11] coma he's probably got his eyes closed I
[1:23:14] haven't seen you in years
[1:23:16] and he begins shaking the hands of souls
[1:23:18] that have already passed on to the other
[1:23:19] dimension there's no fear and death
[1:23:21] anymore Church amen
[1:23:23] but RAM quotes this poem by Longfellow
[1:23:26] lives of great men or a - we can make
[1:23:29] our lives sublime with partings leave
[1:23:31] behind us footprints on the sands of
[1:23:33] time his nine last years of his life
[1:23:36] greater than the previous 75 will say
[1:23:38] like that that's right he said let my
[1:23:42] end be like that remember that now you
[1:23:46] there's another quote four years later I
[1:23:49] went to see him at 84 years old yes to
[1:23:51] the old arms out like that they just
[1:23:53] come off the fields in Africa 84 years
[1:23:55] old or 84 years old
[1:23:56] missionary with me in the jungles and I
[1:23:58] run to him and throw my arms around him
[1:24:00] I knew he was dying I just cried my
[1:24:01] father and my father the chariots of
[1:24:03] israel and the horsemen thereof a
[1:24:05] gallant man and he said this is the
[1:24:10] happiest time
[1:24:11] of all my life brother branham why
[1:24:14] because he just walked in the anointing
[1:24:17] of the message of the hour for the nine
[1:24:18] last years and now he's it even as a
[1:24:21] greater assurance he even has more bonus
[1:24:23] in the day of judgment amen because he's
[1:24:26] walking in the anointing he's in his
[1:24:28] position praise God
[1:24:29] he gained this inheritance hallelujah 84
[1:24:32] years old still preaching snow pressing
[1:24:35] the the kingdom of God and I'm the
[1:24:36] happiest I've ever been at 84 years old
[1:24:39] amen what an opposite thought to
[1:24:43] Ecclesiastes 12 where it said you know
[1:24:45] when the remember the days of your youth
[1:24:47] in the crater right when the evil days
[1:24:49] come Christ has totally changed that
[1:24:52] it'll give me wrong there's some pains
[1:24:54] and aches we go through as they get
[1:24:56] older but look he's not the saddest at
[1:24:59] the end of his life he's the happiest
[1:25:01] glory so the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:04] when we learn to fight with the Holy
[1:25:06] Ghost inside of us I can't fight with my
[1:25:09] mind I got a fight with Christ mind I
[1:25:11] can't fight with my strength it's got to
[1:25:13] be the strength of God amen
[1:25:15] when we learn to fight with like that
[1:25:16] our years become longer and our days
[1:25:19] should become happier why because we're
[1:25:21] living in his presence and in his
[1:25:23] presence his fullness of joy man not a
[1:25:26] make-believe joy but real Holy Ghost
[1:25:28] show a men highly nearly that's exactly
[1:25:30] right he said I said you know you're
[1:25:33] dying don't you brother Bosworth you're
[1:25:35] about to die and he said I can't die oh
[1:25:39] my goodness you're about to die you're
[1:25:43] about to get cancer you're about to get
[1:25:44] sick I can't die I already been dead for
[1:25:47] 60 years amen
[1:25:49] look at this man he's got eagle eyes
[1:25:51] division he's got eagle eyes of faith
[1:25:54] he's seeing what God sees the mass amen
[1:25:56] he cast out everything he's not living
[1:25:58] by his natural mind
[1:26:00] he's fighting by the Holy Spirit that's
[1:26:02] with inside of him amen
[1:26:03] he's pushing out all fear there is no
[1:26:05] fear and death amen precious in the
[1:26:08] sight Lord is the death of his Saints
[1:26:10] amen the greatest fear man ever had has
[1:26:13] been defeated and Christ has destroyed
[1:26:15] death and him that had the power of
[1:26:17] death amen he saw just waiting the
[1:26:21] moment when I see all that I have lived
[1:26:24] for
[1:26:25] Loree see him walking that door to
[1:26:28] invite me to his house I said that's the
[1:26:31] way that's the way to die they said
[1:26:35] quite a while before he died or went
[1:26:37] home he raised up and shaking hands with
[1:26:39] converse of his that come to Christ to
[1:26:42] his ministry for a long time and then he
[1:26:44] gave up the spirit and went on to be
[1:26:47] with them what a gallant
[1:26:49] I just love such things as that how many
[1:26:54] love supernatural things like that Artie
[1:26:56] in a coma and yet raising up and
[1:26:59] blending into the other dimension and
[1:27:02] because of that your ease able to see
[1:27:04] the other dimension is so and not yet
[1:27:07] leptin but it has to act it has to
[1:27:09] respond because it's getting ready to
[1:27:10] cross over hallelujah it's getting ready
[1:27:13] so there's no fear in love because
[1:27:16] perfect love will drive all that out no
[1:27:19] matter where you are in life you can say
[1:27:20] this morning I'm going to take the same
[1:27:22] zeal that that Bosworth had I'm gonna
[1:27:24] run after the message the hour with all
[1:27:26] my heart I'm gonna cast out all fear I'm
[1:27:29] not you old where I can't do something
[1:27:30] for God I can do something for God we
[1:27:32] all can grab ahold of that and possess
[1:27:35] all the inheritance that God has given
[1:27:36] to us but we must have no fear and we
[1:27:39] must act upon the word of the Lord
[1:27:41] that's exactly right church that's
[1:27:44] exactly right
[1:27:44] hallelujah and you know when you have
[1:27:47] that revelation you actually work better
[1:27:49] for the Lord when you don't fear death
[1:27:51] you actually work better the Bible says
[1:27:54] that if you're scared to die scared of
[1:27:57] this scared of that you'll never work
[1:27:58] your best for the Lord like but man get
[1:28:02] an example if you're scared you know
[1:28:03] let's say you're a farmer and if you're
[1:28:05] scared you know there's going to come a
[1:28:06] snowstorm or if you're scared is going
[1:28:08] to come all this droughts and everything
[1:28:10] like that and you never plant any seeds
[1:28:12] you're never gonna get anything out a
[1:28:14] farmer has to have faith glory and
[1:28:17] Christ and Christ has made us farmers
[1:28:20] right our hearts are supposed to be good
[1:28:23] honest grounds and we're supposed to
[1:28:25] receive the promises of God the seeds of
[1:28:28] God the Word of God and when we don't
[1:28:30] fear these things that we bring forth
[1:28:32] more fruit when we have no fear and
[1:28:34] death it was the greatest enemy that man
[1:28:39] the fear of death pause so full of love
[1:28:43] he said Oh death where is thy sting o
[1:28:45] grave where is your victory this thing
[1:28:50] of death is sin and the strength of sin
[1:28:52] is the law but thanks be to God which
[1:28:55] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[1:28:57] Jesus Christ therefore my brethren be
[1:29:00] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:29:04] the work of the Lord for as much as you
[1:29:06] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:29:09] the Lord so see that when we no longer
[1:29:13] fear death our work actually gets more
[1:29:16] fruitful and a bounce more and more
[1:29:19] because we know what's going to happen
[1:29:21] we have bonus in that day we have bonus
[1:29:24] of the day of judgment why because we
[1:29:25] know Christ's spirit the Bible said his
[1:29:27] spirit bears witness with our spirit
[1:29:31] look what God said you know where Paul
[1:29:33] got that from Hosea never know that he
[1:29:34] said Oh death where is your sting did
[1:29:35] you ever read that in Hosea look what it
[1:29:38] says God is talking God said I will
[1:29:40] ransom them from the power of the grave
[1:29:42] in other words I'll pay their debt
[1:29:43] aren't you glad he paid your debt if you
[1:29:47] still got sin attached to you you can't
[1:29:49] go to heaven you had a debt but Christ
[1:29:52] paid the debt he did not owe and you owe
[1:29:55] to debt you could not pay man but Christ
[1:29:58] paid the ransom amen he said I will
[1:30:01] redeem them from death they said Oh
[1:30:04] death I will be your plagues amen
[1:30:07] Oh grave I will be your destruction
[1:30:10] death and the grave look like their
[1:30:13] plagues or their their powers but jesus
[1:30:15] said I'm the one that's going to play
[1:30:17] gear amen he looked at the devil said
[1:30:20] I'm going to plague you you're plaguing
[1:30:22] the sons of men but I'm the one that's
[1:30:24] going to plague you praise God I'm gonna
[1:30:26] return all this evil you've done upon
[1:30:28] mankind and I'm gonna pay you back amen
[1:30:30] and I will be your destruction and I'll
[1:30:33] conquer death hell and the grave and he
[1:30:37] did praise God haha he did a man how do
[1:30:40] you know because we live today by his
[1:30:42] same spirit that he sent back amen
[1:30:44] that's how we know Church love
[1:30:51] it's a powerful force projecting his
[1:30:55] love the Prophet said that love that God
[1:30:57] had love is a powerful force
[1:30:58] when love's projected and it comes to
[1:31:00] the end of his strength sovereign grace
[1:31:02] will take it up from there and project
[1:31:03] the object that love has asked for
[1:31:07] that's let me read it again when love is
[1:31:09] projected and it comes to the end of its
[1:31:12] strength sovereign grace will take it up
[1:31:15] from there and project the object that
[1:31:19] love has asked for that's hard to
[1:31:22] explain that's the reason we have a
[1:31:24] savior tonight is because God so loved
[1:31:26] the world that He sent His love being
[1:31:29] projected to the world produced a savior
[1:31:33] so God's love projected a savior God
[1:31:37] wanted to see you well so much I don't
[1:31:39] think God wants to see you healthy I'm
[1:31:41] gonna see how many believe God wants to
[1:31:43] see you overcome your battles the
[1:31:45] constant inhabitants the constant
[1:31:47] battles the constant things we battle
[1:31:49] over and over again
[1:31:50] we should overcome them his love went
[1:31:53] out and it produced an atonement for
[1:31:57] your sickness as your sins it was the
[1:32:00] love of God that constrained him to do
[1:32:02] it he said it's a powerful force it'll
[1:32:05] run a woman a mother right into the
[1:32:07] flames of fire after her baby if she
[1:32:09] know she's plunging yourself to death
[1:32:10] there's nothing more strong than love
[1:32:13] love will make you trust you might go
[1:32:16] and know that you belong to the greatest
[1:32:17] church in the provinces Canada you might
[1:32:19] know that you're the charter member of
[1:32:21] the greatest church in the nation think
[1:32:23] about the greatest message Church in the
[1:32:24] nation the RAM said you could be the
[1:32:26] greatest charter member the original
[1:32:28] member of the greatest Church and then
[1:32:30] you would do that or you would do things
[1:32:33] that you would not do if you belong to
[1:32:35] little mission somewhere in the corner
[1:32:36] and had the love of God in your heart
[1:32:40] look at by the way I'm saying people
[1:32:44] would say well if I had a bigger church
[1:32:45] I'd do more for the kingdom of God oh
[1:32:47] that's just a lie that's one of Satan's
[1:32:49] lies well brother have said if you've
[1:32:52] got love you would do it whether in a
[1:32:54] big church or small church on a mission
[1:32:56] corner somewhere glory it all depends if
[1:32:59] you got love love drives you to do it it
[1:33:04] does
[1:33:04] make excuses love just drives you to do
[1:33:07] it it's the force driving you to serve
[1:33:09] God's will for your life my life has to
[1:33:14] project God's love your life has to
[1:33:17] project God's love when when our love is
[1:33:20] reaches and grace has to step in and it
[1:33:22] has to project it has to project love to
[1:33:25] you you have to project love to me it's
[1:33:30] the love of God that does it love has no
[1:33:34] fear love casts out fear and I noticed
[1:33:38] in my meeting so much that when I come
[1:33:39] into the people one of the great things
[1:33:41] I find among them is fear and what makes
[1:33:43] fear is the lack of confidence if you
[1:33:48] lack confidence
[1:33:49] it'll make you fear but if you love it
[1:33:53] casts away that fear and that's the way
[1:33:56] God wants his church not so many as
[1:33:58] charter members he wants believers
[1:34:00] that's loyal loves believes and has
[1:34:04] confidence in him I was talking to a
[1:34:07] pastor one time and people left his
[1:34:08] church and when they left they said
[1:34:10] we've lost all confidence in you and he
[1:34:11] was weeping on the phone telling me that
[1:34:14] that's one of the hardest things to hear
[1:34:17] is we've lost confidence look at that
[1:34:20] one of the great things I find and what
[1:34:22] makes them lack confidence is fear fear
[1:34:25] is lack of confidence if you lack
[1:34:28] confidence
[1:34:28] it'll make you fear and the Bible said
[1:34:32] don't cast away your confidence in
[1:34:34] Hebrews chapter 10 hey don't cast away
[1:34:36] your confidence but hang on to the Word
[1:34:39] of God see we must have confidence in
[1:34:42] the love of God that He loves us we must
[1:34:45] be more than just charter members of
[1:34:47] churches we must be loyal we must love
[1:34:50] we must believe and we must have
[1:34:52] confidence in Jesus Christ
[1:34:54] hey man and one another because the
[1:34:57] Bible said if you bring sit in here it
[1:34:58] hinders the whole move of God why don't
[1:35:01] have confidence and so and so on have
[1:35:03] confidence and so and so that that shows
[1:35:05] fear and love has to drive that away so
[1:35:07] love can get the victory in the church
[1:35:09] that's exactly right that's God
[1:35:11] projecting his love the Prophet says
[1:35:14] amen does that help by the grace Lords
[1:35:18] that help
[1:35:18] that I hope that helps by the grace Lord
[1:35:21] love fear brings a lack of trust in God
[1:35:24] or others but love drives that all out
[1:35:27] love does that now I'm up to the spot
[1:35:30] where this is my title the law of
[1:35:32] perfect love so I'm gonna have to close
[1:35:34] maokai you can switch over to easy
[1:35:37] worship now so it's already easy worship
[1:35:38] because I'm out of quotes I'd have time
[1:35:40] I got all those but I'm time to get the
[1:35:41] rest of these so let's look at the rest
[1:35:43] of these the law of perfect love so give
[1:35:46] me a few more minutes here I'm not sure

[1:35:52] let's look at this here the law I want
[1:35:56] to show you the quote where I got this
[1:35:58] as well so you know of course it's not
[1:36:00] something I made up or anything like
[1:36:01] that this is a direct quote from the
[1:36:02] prophet of God so let me find this here
[1:36:05] I just got to scroll down a little bit
[1:36:06] the law perfect love now I preach this a
[1:36:10] little bit when I preach on fear at the
[1:36:11] beginning this is from Jarius and divine
[1:36:13] healing 1954 he's talking about the law
[1:36:17] of electricity it talks about the laws
[1:36:20] of gravity and bringing water to crops

[1:36:27] must work according to the law of
[1:36:28] gravitation he said do you believe that
[1:36:32] he said now your conscience God is here
[1:36:35] now the only thing that we can do is
[1:36:37] work according to the law of God for our
[1:36:40] healing the law of God for our healing
[1:36:43] we must work according to the law of God

[1:36:59] but you got to work with the laws of
[1:37:01] gravitation amen the laws of electricity

[1:37:21] you in a work according to laws of
[1:37:22] electricity that's wonderful laws of
[1:37:24] gravitation but if you want to get
[1:37:26] anywhere with God you must work
[1:37:27] according to this law his love and
[1:37:31] quotes first John 4:18 our text perfect
[1:37:35] love casts out all fear love and faith
[1:37:39] is the same thing see love perfect love
[1:37:41] casts out all fear which gives faith you

[1:37:58] to work according to his laws and his
[1:37:59] law is love perfect love has to drive
[1:38:03] out all fear drive out all doubt or
[1:38:07] unbelief all pride all self-pity all
[1:38:13] lust love has to drive all that out let
[1:38:18] me finish the quote now bro man tells us

[1:38:43] they all go together faith sincerity
[1:38:45] confidence love confession forgiveness
[1:38:52] all these things they all work together
[1:38:53] they're all working together let's look
[1:38:55] at this jesus said now here's the man
[1:38:56] answering to Jesus love the Lord thy God
[1:38:58] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:39:00] with all thy strength with all thy mind
[1:39:01] and with light and thy neighbor as
[1:39:03] thyself
[1:39:04] look at verse 28 and jesus said unto him
[1:39:07] thou has answered right that's the
[1:39:09] greatest commandment this do and thou
[1:39:11] shalt live so full of complete love for
[1:39:16] God produces life right produces life
[1:39:21] brother Bram said now how do you get
[1:39:25] this he said now here's I'm finishing
[1:39:26] the quote now if you'll just love God
[1:39:29] with all your heart he said you'll work
[1:39:33] according to laws of God if you'll just
[1:39:35] love God with all your heart soul mind
[1:39:38] and strength he said then the law of God
[1:39:42] will work for you
[1:39:45] and he goes on to say this if you've
[1:39:47] done something to your neighbor or
[1:39:49] somebody just say in your heart now I
[1:39:52] love them to the demands of the prayer
[1:39:56] line he's trying to get the people to
[1:39:58] believe for healing most of us aren't
[1:40:00] sick this morning Jose said he's sick so
[1:40:02] most of us maybe don't have the need of
[1:40:04] sickness most of us have another need
[1:40:06] how many have needs this morning it
[1:40:08] operates this is the law of God for
[1:40:11] anything any promise of God to operate
[1:40:13] his love is the law and we must love God
[1:40:16] with all of our heart soul mind and
[1:40:18] strength and if we do that then the law
[1:40:20] of God will go to working for us amen he
[1:40:26] quotes another person he's he's just you
[1:40:28] know quoting people in the audience but
[1:40:29] I think what they might say well I've
[1:40:30] got something against the neighbor he
[1:40:32] said now just tell them I love them too
[1:40:35] he said oh brother branham I've
[1:40:38] criticized you a little bit but I love
[1:40:40] you anyhow so he's even telling people
[1:40:42] that are sitting listening to him that
[1:40:44] they're probably criticizing brother
[1:40:45] Branham and brother and said just tell
[1:40:47] God in your heart now that you love me
[1:40:49] even though you've been criticizing me
[1:40:51] tell tell the Lord in your heart that
[1:40:53] you love brother Branham oh my I see
[1:40:57] we've got the love everybody praise God
[1:41:00] that is the law of God to love God with
[1:41:03] all your heart that's your emotions
[1:41:05] heart soul that's your soul mind that's
[1:41:08] your here s your human spirit and your
[1:41:10] strength that's your physical body
[1:41:11] you've got to love God with all your
[1:41:13] body you got to yield all your being to
[1:41:15] Christ I mean understand that we must
[1:41:17] yield all of our being to Jesus Christ
[1:41:19] if we went the law of love to work for
[1:41:21] us he saw he said now this now just let
[1:41:28] that take place like that and just get
[1:41:30] the whole atmosphere in here of love
[1:41:32] then watch the law of God go to work
[1:41:34] just on that just on that the law of
[1:41:39] love will go to work he said just the
[1:41:43] same as it made the Hornets go back in
[1:41:45] their nests eat about when he sent the
[1:41:47] Hornets back by love I'm sorry i disturb
[1:41:49] you from your nest remember when he was
[1:41:50] mowing his backyard and just as it
[1:41:53] stopped the bull in the field and oh my
[1:41:55] the things that I could tell you is this
[1:41:58] simple enough to
[1:41:59] if you want to work according to God's
[1:42:02] love God's law you work in love and you
[1:42:05] just say Lord I love the person I might
[1:42:07] have sin against them but I love them
[1:42:09] forgive me I love that person I love the
[1:42:10] preachers I love them I love the sisters
[1:42:12] I love the deacon I love everything do
[1:42:14] you have to say it you have to believe
[1:42:16] it and mean it praise God you have to
[1:42:18] have full love in your whole being if
[1:42:21] the law of God is going to operate now I
[1:42:25] mentioned this on Wednesday night
[1:42:26] because I read the quote from the Sardis
[1:42:28] church age where brother BAM said every
[1:42:29] Church that doesn't have the
[1:42:31] supernatural will give an account to God
[1:42:32] for that through an manifestations of
[1:42:36] the gifts any church without that will
[1:42:38] give an account I mentioned that on
[1:42:39] Wednesday night hopefully everybody
[1:42:41] listen to that it's feeding on the Word
[1:42:42] of God program says this and the message
[1:42:46] desperation I told you I was gonna back
[1:42:47] that up and here's the quote Romero said
[1:42:51] the days that we're living in should
[1:42:53] cause the church to completely
[1:42:54] completely into desperation I believe
[1:42:57] since the message this morning from God
[1:42:59] not me I believe it ought to throw the
[1:43:01] entire congregation in the desperation
[1:43:03] that we have played long enough we went
[1:43:06] to the church long enough we got to do
[1:43:09] something how many believe that these
[1:43:13] end days these awful days of of human
[1:43:16] self-love right lovers of themselves
[1:43:18] more lovers of God disobedient Oh
[1:43:21] disobedient to parents no natural
[1:43:23] affection trucebreakers incontinent
[1:43:25] backbiters false accusers all these
[1:43:27] things this ought to throw us not them
[1:43:30] Church us seeing that ought to throw us
[1:43:34] in the desperation other words we are
[1:43:37] desperate to see God move in other words
[1:43:40] we're desperate to see the laws of God
[1:43:41] operate hey man here's what he says next
[1:43:46] now here's the court I want to get to
[1:43:47] you how is it that we can see other
[1:43:49] great signs and wonders done on others
[1:43:52] and what about us
[1:43:55] it should cause an estate of desperation
[1:43:58] that we are determined before God there
[1:44:03] you go okay I'm saying about signs and
[1:44:06] wonders he said we've got to give an
[1:44:07] account and aren't you glad for the ones
[1:44:09] you've seen your lives I'm saying for
[1:44:11] those who are who are kind of
[1:44:12] and for double-minded well I need
[1:44:14] America or maybe I don't want America is
[1:44:16] it the will of God or not that's what
[1:44:17] I'm talking about I'm talking about if
[1:44:20] we're not sure what the will of God is
[1:44:21] we need in that case we need desperation
[1:44:24] to find the heart of God the will of God
[1:44:27] and then we can see the law of God
[1:44:28] operate praise the Lord
[1:44:33] remember the prophets said the true
[1:44:35] Church of the continuation the book of
[1:44:36] Acts the book of Revelation shows how
[1:44:38] the Antichrist spirit would come to the
[1:44:40] church and defile now you it you and I
[1:44:41] have to ask ourselves are we defiled
[1:44:43] spiritually Antichrist comes in to file
[1:44:47] the church make it lukewarm formal and
[1:44:49] powerless are your prayers powerless or
[1:44:51] your prayers formal or are they full of
[1:44:54] power we all got to ask ourselves that
[1:44:57] question are you willing to ask yourself
[1:44:59] that question this morning you've got to
[1:45:01] be willing to ask yourself that question
[1:45:02] God hates a powerless religion in other
[1:45:06] words a religion that doesn't fully love
[1:45:09] God because if you fully love God it
[1:45:11] brings the power it moves the law of God
[1:45:13] if you're compromising in this air your
[1:45:16] life or that air your life or that air
[1:45:17] life and people will compromise on many
[1:45:20] levels many different spirits many
[1:45:21] different levels of different things all
[1:45:23] around their lives if they're
[1:45:24] compromised on one level and then it
[1:45:26] gets to others how can the law of God
[1:45:28] work in their life it can't because
[1:45:30] they're breaking the laws of God he said
[1:45:34] we've got to be desperate when we see
[1:45:36] the supernatural on others
[1:45:37] we said what about us it should cause
[1:45:39] the state of desperation amen all things
[1:45:46] 1962 2nd Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit
[1:45:49] warned us in the last days
[1:45:51] the church would get away from the
[1:45:52] sincerity and the faith they have a form
[1:45:54] of godliness but we deny the power that
[1:45:56] went all right well that went with the
[1:45:58] right thing having a form of godliness
[1:46:00] denying the power thereof
[1:46:04] God hates powerless religion it's got
[1:46:07] that power and it's got to have
[1:46:08] sincerity sincerity brings power
[1:46:10] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[1:46:13] I don't know about you but I had some
[1:46:15] real worship during solemn service this
[1:46:16] morning we should have real worship that
[1:46:21] means we don't care who's around it's
[1:46:22] just like it's us and God worshiping the
[1:46:24] Lord just me worshiping God
[1:46:26] real worship if you're not sincere and
[1:46:29] it's not it's not a real worship he said
[1:46:33] but sincerity brings real worship not
[1:46:35] forms but genuine power worship to know
[1:46:38] that you pass from death unto life amen
[1:46:40] God wants to perform his word by his
[1:46:42] power and when the church denies his
[1:46:44] power
[1:46:44] how can he perform and vindicate his
[1:46:46] work God wants to do great things God
[1:46:48] wants to answer prayer but we've got to
[1:46:49] be sincere we've got to be desperate in
[1:46:51] others we've got to be full of God's
[1:46:53] love because if you know brother amps
[1:46:56] that love makes you desperate love makes
[1:46:59] you different
[1:47:00] Esper and he gives you a lot of
[1:47:01] illustrations like you said what if your
[1:47:02] wife had cancer it would throw you into
[1:47:04] desperation I'll do anything to save my
[1:47:07] wife I'll do anything to save my husband
[1:47:09] love causes desperation the reason
[1:47:12] people are desperate for the word of God
[1:47:13] even the message or any nomination is
[1:47:15] because they're not really filled with
[1:47:17] all the love they ought to be filled
[1:47:18] with they're in love with things of the
[1:47:21] world they're compromising here and
[1:47:22] there but the love of God makes you
[1:47:24] desperate amen glory it makes you enjoy
[1:47:27] the preach and enjoy the five mobile
[1:47:28] ministry enjoy worshiping Jesus Christ
[1:47:30] that's what God's love does to you if
[1:47:33] not it becomes a routine it becomes
[1:47:35] stagnant I say like that exactly right
[1:47:38] this is the law of love this is the law
[1:47:41] of perfect love perfect love only
[1:47:44] operates when we're fully in love with
[1:47:46] God in every channel every fiber of our
[1:47:48] being a surrender to God's will and
[1:47:50] you're the one that knows if you're
[1:47:51] defiled powerless formal lukewarm you're
[1:47:54] the one that knows remember this is the
[1:47:57] greatest age of deception don't be
[1:47:58] deceived take some time like the Holy
[1:48:00] Spirit said and sister Karen at those
[1:48:02] meetings if you weeks ago search your
[1:48:04] heart deep search your heart to make
[1:48:07] sure get everything out to make sure you
[1:48:09] got a circular take some time in search
[1:48:10] praise God here's where I said it's
[1:48:15] artesian church age any other church
[1:48:17] that does not have the spirit and the
[1:48:18] manifestations is going to have to
[1:48:21] account to God
[1:48:22] and that's going to be at the white
[1:48:24] throne judgment because that will not be
[1:48:26] the bride brides that I have to give an
[1:48:28] account for not having the Holy Ghost
[1:48:29] the spear and the bride say come she's
[1:48:32] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:33] praise God she's washed by the Holy
[1:48:35] Ghost she's washed by the waters of the
[1:48:37] word oh my they
[1:48:40] to give an account they claim to be the
[1:48:43] message that claim to be holy ghost Phil
[1:48:44] well where's the manifestation of that
[1:48:46] the law of God should work the law of
[1:48:48] love should work where's the power of
[1:48:50] God in our lives
[1:48:51] amen here's where he says the
[1:48:54] desperation and I'm getting closer here
[1:48:57] to being done
[1:48:59] but RAM said I believe the reason we
[1:49:01] don't have desperation is because it's a
[1:49:02] lack of love
[1:49:04] he didn't say it's a lack of having
[1:49:07] enough tapes to listen to or it's a lack
[1:49:09] of not having enough time I don't have
[1:49:12] enough time in my life I think we're all
[1:49:14] busy I think we all can understand we
[1:49:15] are all busy the reason we don't
[1:49:17] desperation is because the lack of love
[1:49:21] the love of God I think the love love of
[1:49:25] God causes desperation I me appreciate
[1:49:26] his opinion how many one take his
[1:49:28] opinion if you have love of God it'll
[1:49:32] cause you to be desperate for some other
[1:49:33] person that's what I was saying one time
[1:49:36] I think I said it even if I come up here
[1:49:39] and preach on water baptism of the Holy
[1:49:40] Spirit don't shut me out
[1:49:42] don't another I'm sorry don't shut the
[1:49:44] Holy Spirit up don't resent a preacher
[1:49:48] for preaching on water baptism if you've
[1:49:50] heard it 500 times don't shut off and
[1:49:53] resent the Holy Spirit or the preacher
[1:49:54] because what if God's trying to get
[1:49:56] somebody saved like Haven last week and
[1:50:01] that person would be so selfish all
[1:50:03] they're thinking about their own selves
[1:50:05] instead of agreeing without the Holy
[1:50:07] Spirit the Holy Spirit rying to drive
[1:50:08] this thought down to a young believers
[1:50:09] heart not and a formal religious person
[1:50:13] will sit back and criticize that you
[1:50:16] understand or understand it but God's
[1:50:19] love will drive you to desperation if
[1:50:22] you really have got lured it must be
[1:50:24] desperate the Holy Spirit chose to bring
[1:50:26] this thought again it must be important
[1:50:29] now I can say at the beginning of my
[1:50:31] ministry I preached a lot on water
[1:50:33] baptism so they have much other material
[1:50:35] I'll be honest there but now I get I
[1:50:37] can't say that if I'm preaching on water
[1:50:39] baptism or something elementary like
[1:50:40] faith or salvation or something like
[1:50:42] that it's because the Holy Spirit's
[1:50:44] trying to get it to somebody and we need
[1:50:46] to back that up and support that not
[1:50:47] resent that and not be formal but still
[1:50:50] stay on fire amen
[1:50:51] I hope you understand
[1:50:54] morning I preached on the scarcely saved
[1:50:56] scarcity lost we had like eight visitors
[1:50:58] from the Omi's family member sister
[1:51:00] Wendy told me that children were
[1:51:01] screaming all over and trying to get
[1:51:03] people to be saved and hear the message
[1:51:05] Satan was trying to fight this you know
[1:51:07] trying to get the word and if we're not
[1:51:10] careful we might have sat back and just
[1:51:12] open our heart to hurt us before already
[1:51:13] know about four classes and three
[1:51:14] believers in four classes already know
[1:51:16] about this but if we get in the channel
[1:51:19] the Holy Spirit we can get behind what
[1:51:21] the Holy Spirit wants to do and agree
[1:51:23] with it and we can be led to go pray for
[1:51:25] somebody or be led to talk to somebody
[1:51:27] afterwards find a leadership with the
[1:51:28] Holy Spirit get in unity and here with
[1:51:31] the Spirit saying to the churches but
[1:51:34] not formal because the love of God
[1:51:36] doesn't make it formal God's love makes
[1:51:39] a desperate amen well Gramps and I
[1:51:42] believe it will the tokens inside of you
[1:51:44] it'll throw you into desperation I
[1:51:46] believe it will church more of us should
[1:51:48] be more desperate during regular
[1:51:49] services not just special meetings but
[1:51:51] just regular services and if you've got
[1:51:53] the love of God in you it'll cause you
[1:51:55] to do that the token inside of you will
[1:51:58] cause you do that not to resent the
[1:51:59] preacher or shut him down or get a
[1:52:01] resentful spirit that's that's a spirit
[1:52:03] of unbelief but to back it up and know
[1:52:06] that the Holy Spirit is having his way
[1:52:08] if we're all yielding to God program sin
[1:52:12] now the word plainly states if you want
[1:52:14] to put this down Galatians 5:6 faith
[1:52:15] worketh by love and the only way you can
[1:52:19] have faith is to have love first because
[1:52:24] after all faith is loves incentive so
[1:52:27] that's what love once loved one's faith
[1:52:28] love once made love when you love God oh
[1:52:31] I just want the faith right I just want
[1:52:33] the revelation of the rapture brother
[1:52:34] Kevin I just want that the love we've
[1:52:36] got in me I don't want to be here in the
[1:52:37] tribulation I love Jesus he died for me
[1:52:39] I've sacrificed all my life the love of
[1:52:42] God in me once that rapturing faith amen
[1:52:44] that's my incentive a man he died to
[1:52:47] save me from the wrath of God I'm a
[1:52:49] children of life not a child of darkness
[1:52:50] Amen and therefore I will not be a child
[1:52:53] of wrath I will not suffer the wrath of
[1:52:55] God I will rejoice in the deliverance of
[1:52:58] God amen
[1:52:59] that's my incentive rapturing faith is
[1:53:01] my incentive for the love that I have
[1:53:03] for Christ how can you have faith in
[1:53:06] your wife if you don't love her
[1:53:07] that's agape so that's figlio how about
[1:53:10] a got bow to God he said that's what you
[1:53:13] do with God when you love God you tell
[1:53:15] him about it we sat down and we adore
[1:53:19] him and worship Him and love drives us
[1:53:21] to that I hope you had a chance this
[1:53:28] morning to sit down with God and tell
[1:53:29] him how much you love him I hope you had
[1:53:33] a chance to do that because love will
[1:53:36] drive you to that or last night or this
[1:53:40] weekend love drives somebody to
[1:53:44] desperation for more of God it's love
[1:53:48] now for some of us it might be legalism
[1:53:50] if we're always living under
[1:53:51] condemnation but really behind all that
[1:53:54] if we can get rid of that condemnation
[1:53:55] it's love that drives us to God it's
[1:53:58] love that drives us for signs wonders
[1:54:00] and miracles it's love that drives us
[1:54:01] for the token right for any redemptive
[1:54:05] promise of God what drives you to
[1:54:06] justification love drives you to that he
[1:54:09] died for me I love him love will drive
[1:54:11] you to justification sanctification back
[1:54:12] to the Holy Ghost fullness of Pentecost
[1:54:14] of the church I need any promise of God
[1:54:16] divine healing love drives you to that
[1:54:18] amen
[1:54:19] that's my incentive a man his faith for
[1:54:21] healing faith for the rapture faith for
[1:54:23] Supernatural that's my incentive because
[1:54:25] I love Christ amen glory love drives you
[1:54:29] to that amen he said I believe love will
[1:54:31] do it amen
[1:54:32] the love of God will do it the only way
[1:54:35] to have faith is to have love first love
[1:54:39] drives you to that when we have genuine
[1:54:46] love what does it do brother branham it
[1:54:47] pushes our faith out on the battlefront
[1:54:49] for God when you have love for God love
[1:54:52] will constrain you to go fight right
[1:54:55] every time I see one of these veterans
[1:54:57] what I try to thank them for serving and
[1:54:59] what is it it's their love for the
[1:55:00] country now it's a natural love but it's
[1:55:01] still a love and we appreciate that
[1:55:03] naturally I appreciate that human love
[1:55:05] to put their lives on the line for our
[1:55:07] country I told one just recently no
[1:55:09] greater love has no man than this and he
[1:55:10] laid his life down for his friends try
[1:55:13] to encourage God's got a place for
[1:55:15] soldiers like that that do it for the
[1:55:17] right reasons God has a place like I
[1:55:19] said God's got a place for pet
[1:55:21] doctors that do that doctors that will
[1:55:23] cross in the middle of night now he said
[1:55:24] the old time doctors crossed rivers and
[1:55:26] go to ministers somebody and don't take
[1:55:28] any pay God has a special place in
[1:55:30] heaven for Pat for doctors like that
[1:55:32] pastors doctors I mean doctors Lorena
[1:55:37] said if you have love it pushes our
[1:55:39] faith on the battlefront for God
[1:55:40] genuine godly love for God and first
[1:55:42] word and first people will push faith
[1:55:44] out there love takes ahold of faith and
[1:55:46] said come on let's go and out it goes
[1:55:48] cuz that's what love does if God said
[1:55:54] I'm the Lord that he'll see he believes
[1:55:56] that love makes him believe it because
[1:55:57] love dominates all what's dominating our
[1:56:00] lives church this weekend
[1:56:01] what's dominating our lives this last
[1:56:03] month the last year of our life what's
[1:56:04] dominating our love is it love or is it
[1:56:06] religious spirit is it love or is it
[1:56:10] insecurities fierce anger bitterness
[1:56:15] complexes money what is it what is it
[1:56:19] what's dominating our life it ought to
[1:56:21] be the love of Jesus Christ in all your
[1:56:24] heart soul mind and strength that will
[1:56:25] move the law of God in your life he said
[1:56:32] though I speak with tongues have been
[1:56:32] angels have not love it does me nothing
[1:56:34] so I have faith to move mountains it
[1:56:36] doesn't know what love is nothing love
[1:56:38] dominates all because God is love a God
[1:56:40] of love yes sir Jesus said if a man
[1:56:42] loves me he'll keep my words we know it
[1:56:46] is true that God will meet a desperate
[1:56:48] soul we all know that but it usually
[1:56:52] takes something to drive Jesse into that
[1:56:54] and you place your name in there
[1:56:56] how do we know God answers a desperate
[1:56:58] soul he said it takes it takes something
[1:57:04] to drive humans into that to despair to
[1:57:07] desperation it takes something to do
[1:57:09] that brother Brandon said we should have
[1:57:12] desperation all the time in the message
[1:57:14] desperation libram said brother I can't
[1:57:17] member his name wasn't Bosworth one of
[1:57:20] the older brothers went up to him and
[1:57:22] said brother Branham I hate to have to
[1:57:23] answer on the day of judgment for the
[1:57:24] millions of souls you preach - he said
[1:57:27] that threw me into desperation he's been
[1:57:28] I've he said I've been in desperation
[1:57:30] ever since so
[1:57:33] here's a man who lives under desperation
[1:57:35] in other words he lives under this love
[1:57:37] that reaches out I want to have faith
[1:57:39] I want to believe God I wanna believe
[1:57:41] all God's promises I want to see the
[1:57:42] Word of God come to pass
[1:57:43] love constrains him to have desperation
[1:57:46] to see God's Word fulfilled
[1:57:47] are you with me Church does that make
[1:57:48] sense we want to see God but when I come
[1:57:50] here I don't come here to play Church I
[1:57:52] come here to see God move even is bring
[1:57:54] one person to Thanksgiving or one person
[1:57:56] who repents one person to healing that's
[1:57:58] why we come to God's house in his love
[1:58:00] it drives us to see someone have faith
[1:58:02] in God's Word and stop living under fear
[1:58:06] or doubt or unbelief or greed or lust or
[1:58:09] something like that
[1:58:09] faith drives us to that love drives out
[1:58:12] there to see the revelation of God's
[1:58:14] Word take place in the church in our
[1:58:16] lives we should have that all the time
[1:58:18] that's why I gotta constantly make sure
[1:58:20] I'm here Saturday morning every morning
[1:58:21] so I can get my desperation back for the
[1:58:23] Lord every and every Wednesday we
[1:58:26] constantly have to have that if we don't
[1:58:28] have that it becomes formal church
[1:58:30] becomes just going through the routine
[1:58:32] and who's responsible for that you and I
[1:58:34] are cuz well to answer for it if we if
[1:58:36] we let that go on never understand
[1:58:37] program so we're gonna come to caters
[1:58:39] Barnea right we got a crossover in the
[1:58:41] baptism Holy Ghost or stay outside I
[1:58:43] want to go into I believe I'm in by
[1:58:45] God's grace but I want everybody in the
[1:58:46] church to go in praise the Lord and if
[1:58:49] you're in then you're fighting these
[1:58:50] things with love perfect love is casting
[1:58:53] out all fear amen
[1:58:54] that's what's happening you're
[1:58:56] possessing the promises now give me five
[1:58:58] minutes let me set my timer so I don't
[1:59:00] go too long give me five minutes and
[1:59:02] I'll be done here brother branham ends
[1:59:06] this by giving all these listen to these
[1:59:08] examples of desperation Jacob was
[1:59:10] desperate he wrestled an angel but he
[1:59:12] but he possess the promise well Gramps
[1:59:14] the love drove Jacob to that love well
[1:59:17] Graham said Hezekiah cried out God spare
[1:59:19] me give me 15 more years the man said
[1:59:21] that was God's love in Hezekiah crying
[1:59:23] out for God to move see it was love
[1:59:25] crying out for that faith give me that
[1:59:27] faith to be him see God's love does that
[1:59:30] to you aren't you glad for God's love
[1:59:31] the next he gave us Ruth Ruth cried out
[1:59:33] in desperation right and God let her go
[1:59:36] with Naomi that's her brother ma'am sent
[1:59:37] Jonah cried out in desperation from the
[1:59:40] belly of the whale and God gave him the
[1:59:41] desire of his heart
[1:59:42] Hannah cried out for a child and God
[1:59:45] gave her a prophet a special blessed he
[1:59:47] said
[1:59:47] extra special blessing of prophet
[1:59:49] fasting and praying the Shulamite woman
[1:59:52] brother man said she got in desperation
[1:59:53] when the boy died that God gave her and
[1:59:55] then Elijah got in desperation said why
[1:59:57] this baby died and he went and you know
[1:59:59] went back and forth of the room and you
[2:00:02] know sneeze seven you know he prayed for
[2:00:03] him laid his face on sneeze seven times
[2:00:05] desperation drove him to pray for a dead
[2:00:08] boy love drove him to do that the love
[2:00:10] of God to see the faith of God operate
[2:00:12] love drives us to do that then he gave
[2:00:17] the example blind Bartimaeus he said
[2:00:18] love cried out son of David have mercy
[2:00:20] on me
[2:00:21] give me my sight and even though they
[2:00:22] said shut up Bart blind Bartimaeus he
[2:00:24] said the son of David have mercy on me
[2:00:27] love will cause you to shout and praise
[2:00:29] God and crowd to God or get on your
[2:00:31] knees and pray love knows that love it's
[2:00:33] crying out for Lord give me the faith
[2:00:35] love operates by faith Amen then he
[2:00:40] gives example Peter when he was sinking
[2:00:42] said Lord saved me crying on desperation
[2:00:43] Jesus saved him listen to the message if
[2:00:46] you haven't listened this a few weeks
[2:00:47] ago brother and said Jesus in Gethsemane
[2:00:49] there was love that cried out father if
[2:00:51] it be possible let this cup pass from me
[2:00:53] love caused him to be desperate because
[2:00:55] he loved the father
[2:00:57] well the rancid forest nightingale trout
[2:01:00] as far as she could go the real skinny
[2:01:01] woman I don't know if his TV or what it
[2:01:03] was but she was all bones he said it was
[2:01:05] love that drove her to desperation then
[2:01:08] he go into Hattie waldrop she had heart
[2:01:10] cancer in his first campaign she said or
[2:01:14] he said and God healed sister Hattie
[2:01:16] waldrop because she had love weatherman
[2:01:18] said she'd already passed out and died
[2:01:20] in the prayer line and they prayed for
[2:01:21] God healed her and she's still alive
[2:01:23] that she was gonna be at the meetings
[2:01:24] there in 1965 still heart cancer and
[2:01:27] died and passed out and God brought her
[2:01:29] back because love made or not made the
[2:01:32] people around her and herself for
[2:01:34] desperate for God's word to go in effect
[2:01:36] and he gave the example of Jairus and
[2:01:38] his daughter dying
[2:01:39] Jarius went out and got Jesus said come
[2:01:41] you know come to my house love drove
[2:01:43] them to forget all about his Jewish
[2:01:45] denominations drive out of that
[2:01:46] denominational Church and bring the
[2:01:48] Living Word to his house woman with the
[2:01:51] blood issue wrote and said she had to
[2:01:52] push through the crowds and sweet pass
[2:01:54] and push pass hold big muscle Peter love
[2:01:57] drove her to physically push to touch
[2:02:00] Jesus's garb
[2:02:01] amen love drove her to that he said the
[2:02:04] queen of South crossed the desert
[2:02:06] because love desired to see God's Word
[2:02:09] operate in a man hallelujah woman with a
[2:02:12] dead baby in Mexico but man said the
[2:02:14] woman saw a blind man receive a sight in
[2:02:18] Mexico and no dead baby and no Usher a
[2:02:21] brother branham could keep her from
[2:02:22] God's prophet a man to hear the word of
[2:02:24] God it was God's love see she got
[2:02:26] desperate I saw God do it for somebody
[2:02:28] else God can do it for me
[2:02:33] the man said the same thing tonight when
[2:02:35] the same desperation rises will throw
[2:02:37] love and faith up there to the
[2:02:38] battlefront to claim what you want
[2:02:40] because you love God because it's a
[2:02:44] promise of God that you can have it
[2:02:51] he said desperation when you seek me
[2:02:54] with all your heart you'll find me some
[2:02:56] other rams text was Jeremiah 29 God told
[2:02:59] Israel you'll be there seventy years in
[2:03:00] Babylon he said but at the end of that
[2:03:03] you'll seek me and find me when you seek
[2:03:04] me with all your heart
[2:03:05] everybody quotes that scripture when
[2:03:07] they say I know the thoughts that I have
[2:03:09] for you thoughts of good and not of evil
[2:03:11] honey ever seen that everybody quotes
[2:03:13] that scripture but they leave out the
[2:03:15] part about seeking God with all their
[2:03:16] hearts everybody wants the good thoughts
[2:03:19] everybody wants to plan for their lives
[2:03:20] and the church said everybody wants
[2:03:24] God's blessings but who's gonna be the
[2:03:25] ones that actually seek God in
[2:03:27] desperation with all their heart who's
[2:03:29] gonna be that that's the one who's
[2:03:31] actually gonna God's gonna answer the
[2:03:33] one who seeks God in desperation by the
[2:03:35] love it's in his heart this is the law
[2:03:36] of perfect love let's say into our feet
[2:03:39] so make sure I close I still got myself
[2:03:41] in that twenty seconds the last example
[2:03:45] brother Brandon gave was the woman who
[2:03:47] had her morals ruined and a man slipped
[2:03:51] the drug in her drink ruined her morals
[2:03:53] she went crazy tried to marry a few
[2:03:54] times end up in the good Sheppard's home
[2:03:56] brother Branham said she prayed until
[2:03:58] she knew something happened
[2:04:00] she knew the love of God entered into
[2:04:02] her heart and she left that good
[2:04:04] Sheppard's home and said I'll never be
[2:04:06] the same
[2:04:11] the Branham said a partial hunger will
[2:04:13] not bring the love of God on the scene a
[2:04:17] partial hunger will not bring it on the
[2:04:19] scene you can't love God with part of
[2:04:21] your heart part of your soul part of
[2:04:24] your mind and partiers you can't do that
[2:04:25] I expect God's law to operate only
[2:04:29] operates when we love God with all of
[2:04:31] our hearts listen that look-up partial
[2:04:33] hunger is only one time in the message
[2:04:34] Albuquerque you see what the Holy Ghost
[2:04:36] he got a partial hunger but not a real
[2:04:39] hunger and I think church let's be
[2:04:41] honest me too I'm with you in this I
[2:04:43] mean I'm with you in this we off the
[2:04:45] battle a partial hunger for coming to
[2:04:47] hear God's Word a partial hunger to say
[2:04:49] dedicate in our homes to be faithful in
[2:04:53] our jobs everywhere at school all of us
[2:04:57] battle a partial hunger we need a full
[2:04:59] hunger and that's what moves the laws of
[2:05:03] God when we love God with all of our
[2:05:06] hearts
[2:05:11] incomplete so here you got all fresh
[2:05:14] tell me whenever you ready
[2:05:15] I'm closing with this now remember not
[2:05:25] Christian later Sita has a fervent
[2:05:27] desire to please God I just want to do
[2:05:29] what God will be pleased with I just
[2:05:31] want to obey God and know that he's
[2:05:33] pleased with me fervent desire to please
[2:05:35] God what's the next one anyway know by
[2:05:38] this time didn't we know this anybody
[2:05:41] got this quote memorized it's a passion
[2:05:43] to knows word purgative desire to please
[2:05:45] him a passion of knows where it was the
[2:05:47] last one reaching out and crying in the
[2:05:51] Holy Spirit that's the threefold
[2:05:53] evidence that you're hot and Leo steel
[2:05:55] let me understand that that's page 88
[2:05:58] the church age book this is all faded he
[2:06:01] says and instead of the church being on
[2:06:03] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[2:06:05] off and become a bit formal regular
[2:06:12] routine go through the motions for me we
[2:06:17] can't allow that church around so the
[2:06:19] condition should drive us in desperation

[2:06:25] really want to believe I want to see the
[2:06:27] laws of God operate for me try gonna
