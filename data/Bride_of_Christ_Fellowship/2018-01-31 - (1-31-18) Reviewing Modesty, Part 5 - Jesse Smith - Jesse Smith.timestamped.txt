[29:34] Amen seen the first verse - I love the
[29:45] story of Jesus it's nothing

[30:33] I love to tell the story will be my
[30:45] favorite to tell the older stories of
[30:57] Jesus and is the second verse I love to
[31:06] tell the story it seems and all the
[31:20] golden fancies of art are golden dreams
[31:30] I love to tell the story it did so much
[31:41] for me and that is just the reason I
[31:52] tell it now I love to jam the story
[32:04] Gauri will be my theme in glory
[32:12] to tell the old story of Jesus said is
[32:23] the last verse I love to tell the story
[32:33] [Music]
[32:53] and when it seeds of glory I see will be
[33:08] the old story
[33:14] that I have loved so long the story will
[33:29] be my glory to tell the story of Jesus
[33:43] and his love to tell the ore to tell the
[33:51] old story Jesus and Heavenly Father Lord

[35:09] to freedom to victory to obedience to
[35:12] joy to all the fruits of the Holy Spirit
[35:14] thank you Lord bless this word as we
[35:17] read it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[35:20] Saint said amen god bless you let's take
[35:22] our Bibles let's go to proverbs chapter
[35:23] 1 verse 9 like to preach on part 5 of
[35:30] the modesty series tonight by the grace
[35:34] of the Lord
[35:41] robbers chapter 1 verse 9 proverbs
[36:08] chapter 1 verse 9 let's actually read
[36:12] verse 7 8 and 9 because it's in the
[36:14] context to understand verse 9 verse 7
[36:17] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[36:18] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[36:21] instruction my son here the instruction
[36:26] of thy father and forsake not the law of
[36:29] thy mother for they shall be an ornament
[36:33] of grace unto thy head and chains about
[36:39] thy neck those look at modesty tonight I
[36:43] wanted to show the natural accessories
[36:47] and natural jewelry many times are
[36:49] symbols of spiritual blessings
[36:52] so may God has blessing the reading of
[36:54] his word you may be seated god bless you
[36:58] so Malachi whenever you ready you can
[37:00] switch over here I just have a few
[37:02] slides here and we're going through a
[37:05] lot of Scripture here tonight Lord
[37:06] willing by the grace of the Lord I'll
[37:08] just update you I'm on chapter 6 I'm
[37:10] almost done I have 29 thousand words so
[37:12] I'm up to quite a few words there and
[37:15] then I got two more chapters to go after
[37:16] this but
[37:18] making good progress this week I spent
[37:21] most of my time as you'll see down here
[37:23] at the bottom see how these pictures
[37:24] down here this week I spent most of my
[37:26] time will show these at the end I spent
[37:28] most of my time researching all the
[37:31] articles encyclopedia Britannica's
[37:34] almanacs and then the Bible all the all
[37:37] the proof we have about the downward
[37:39] fall of modesty in America I just kind
[37:42] of that's what chapter 6 is all about so
[37:45] chapter 6 is called connecting Bible
[37:47] history with the history of fashion so I
[37:50] spent most of my week
[37:51] looking at that and I read most of that
[37:53] book you gave me Connie so thank you
[37:54] about sixty pages into that by the grace
[37:56] of Lord I think it's got a couple more
[37:58] chapters that's been a real helpful book
[37:59] it's been nice to see just some
[38:02] different thoughts and different
[38:03] perspectives on this topic okay so let's
[38:07] get started here tonight by God's grace
[38:08] this is part five here's my outline for
[38:11] tonight I don't know I want to get here
[38:13] but we're going to start with all the
[38:14] scriptures not all the scriptures but
[38:15] the main ones on earrings necklaces
[38:18] tattoos bracelets and then I want to
[38:22] move on this thought this is a thought I
[38:24] got from the book that kind of gave me
[38:26] point mints verses makeup I kind of want
[38:28] to show the scriptures on that and then
[38:31] if I have time I want to show the
[38:34] clothing standards that have fell by
[38:36] decade remember we already taught on the
[38:38] swim some swimwear fashions that fell by
[38:40] decade but I like I said spent this week
[38:43] going through all the references and the
[38:45] books that we have on these things and I
[38:51] think that's going to be a blessing to
[38:52] you so remember again these are all the
[38:54] these are guidelines have all fallen
[38:56] they've all fallen over the course the
[38:59] last 150 years these four Bible
[39:02] guidelines covering all areas of
[39:03] nakedness wearing a thick layer of
[39:06] clothing or multiple layers of thinner
[39:08] clothing in other words not see-through
[39:10] kind of transparent clothing
[39:13] gender-specific clothing and then long
[39:16] loose flowing clothing like Jesus and
[39:18] all the saints aware in heaven for all
[39:21] eternity all right so let's start with
[39:25] earrings if you got your Bible let's
[39:29] let's go
[39:30] should I start with neck assistance we
[39:31] just read our text on that so okay I
[39:33] hope everybody can see that necklaces
[39:35] are here are a sign of a spiritual sign
[39:39] of being adorned being made beautiful
[39:41] all right now in our church I don't
[39:44] really I don't really think it's very
[39:47] manly for a man to wear necklaces but if
[39:49] a man wants to you know there's
[39:52] scripture where he could we'll look at
[39:53] that tonight but with sisters brother
[39:57] branham's you know we read the quote
[39:58] this summer last summer where brother
[39:59] Adam said if you got a necklace your
[40:01] husband gave you or necklace that means
[40:02] something to you he said I think that's
[40:04] fine to wear he said just examine the
[40:07] reason why you're wearing it so you have
[40:09] to know your your motive and objective
[40:12] behind wearing something so let's look
[40:16] at these necklaces that were worn now
[40:17] the wisdom of your the parents your
[40:20] teaching of your parents is like a
[40:21] necklace around your neck it adorns you
[40:24] it it shows that you have wisdom when
[40:26] you obey the the teaching of your mother
[40:28] and father it's like a spiritual
[40:30] anointing of the fear of the Lord is on
[40:32] you people can see the wisdom of God
[40:34] upon you so that's what a necklace
[40:36] represents to the spiritual so just to
[40:39] show you natural necklaces let's go to
[40:41] Genesis 41 42 and you can see this by
[40:46] the grace of Lord and who like to read
[40:49] that what anyone have that for me now I
[40:50] like to read that okay when you're ready
[40:52] buddy okay so Joseph as soon as he
[41:02] interprets Pharaoh's dream he gets a
[41:04] ring which we showed was like the
[41:06] signature like a stamp a signet ring to
[41:09] give the approval kind of power and
[41:11] authority and then a necklace some type
[41:13] of necklace I don't know what that means
[41:15] I don't I don't know the the meaning
[41:17] behind the necklace but if God let
[41:19] Joseph wear it who was a type of Christ
[41:21] then we can say that just a man wearing
[41:24] a necklace wouldn't be necessarily a
[41:26] wrong thing it depends why he's wearing
[41:28] it all right let's go to Song of Solomon
[41:30] chapter 1 solomon's bride wore necklace
[41:36] Song of Solomon 1 verse 10
[41:48] we would like to read that for me
[41:50] tonight
[41:51] Lydia thank you okay so here chains of
[42:02] gulp now if you look at verse a if thou
[42:06] know'st not oh thou fairest among women
[42:08] go thy way forth by that I footsteps of
[42:11] the flock and feed that kids beside the
[42:14] Shepherd's tents I've compared the oh my
[42:16] love to a company of horses in Pharaoh's
[42:19] chariots okay now I believe that's
[42:26] speaking of the woman I believe I'm
[42:29] sorry I didn't look too soon I'm gonna
[42:31] okay well no I think that Psalm because
[42:37] look at verse one this is the woman
[42:38] talking I am blackbuck calmly so that
[42:40] would be the woman okay so that was
[42:42] Solomon then so I'm sorry Solomon looks
[42:44] like he has chains of gold on part of me
[42:49] mix that one up forgive me okay let's go
[42:55] to Genesis back to Genesis 24 22 now
[42:58] here we see Rebecca getting jewelry at
[43:03] her engagement to Isaac by Abraham's
[43:07] messenger faithful messenger Eliezer
[43:09] Genesis 24 22 and it came to pass as the
[43:15] camels had done drinking that the man
[43:17] took a golden earring of half a shekel
[43:19] weight and two bracelets from her hands
[43:22] of ten shekels weight of gold okay this
[43:24] is bracelets okay yeah here's bracelets
[43:28] alright now this is a striking one go to
[43:31] Ezekiel 16 of all the times God
[43:41] talks about jewelry in the Bible this is
[43:43] one of the most striking to me right
[43:44] here
[43:44] Ezekiel 16 but I believe you'll see a
[43:47] principle as we read this there seems to
[43:50] be some type of connection between women
[43:52] being adorned either at their engagement
[43:54] or at their wedding day there seems to
[43:57] be some kind of connection where God God
[44:01] loves when a woman is presented as
[44:03] beautifully as she can to her husband
[44:06] there seems to be some connection
[44:08] between jewelry and a new bride or
[44:11] something along those lines or
[44:12] engagement of a bride there is some type
[44:14] of Bible connection because we see it
[44:16] with Rebecca and then we see it right
[44:18] here with God's bride Israel and then we
[44:22] see it at the rapture because remember
[44:24] Jesus is bride she's without spot or
[44:27] blemish amen
[44:28] she's adorned she's totally washed in
[44:30] the blood of Jesus amen no spot no
[44:32] wrinkle he meant glory Ezekiel 16 now
[44:44] and you look at verse 2 son of man calls
[44:46] Jerusalem to know her abominations and
[44:48] say thus saith the Lord God unto
[44:49] Jerusalem thy birth and I night Nativity
[44:51] is of the land of Canaan
[44:53] my father was an am right and thy mother
[44:55] and hittite and as for that night
[44:57] Nativity in the day thou was born thy
[45:01] navel was not cut that's their umbilical
[45:04] cord remember that name Alma represents
[45:05] the umbilical cord neither was that
[45:08] washed in water too supple thee thou was
[45:11] not salted at all nor swaddled at all so
[45:13] this is a baby that's fresh born not
[45:15] taken care of
[45:16] none I pitied thee to do any of these
[45:19] unto thee to have compassion upon thee
[45:22] but thou was cast out in the open field
[45:25] to the loathing of that person in the
[45:27] day that thou was born can you imagine a
[45:29] baby being treated like this this is how
[45:31] God saw Israel and when I pass by the
[45:34] and saw the polluted in thine own blood
[45:36] I said unto thee when thou was in thy
[45:39] blood live yay I sent unto thee when I
[45:43] was in thy blood live aren't you glad
[45:46] God found you God won't let you die he
[45:49] said live brother Adam amen live he
[45:54] you're dead in your sins and trespasses
[45:55] like Ephesians 2 said but then he
[45:58] quickened you by his word amen beautiful
[46:01] passage here just amazing verse 7 I have
[46:07] caused the to multiply as the butt of
[46:09] the field and that was increase in
[46:11] waxing great and now are come to
[46:13] excellent ornaments thy breasts or
[46:16] fashions and nine hairs grown whereas
[46:18] thou was naked and bare now when I pass
[46:22] by thee and looked upon thee behold thy
[46:24] time was come of love try the time of
[46:26] love and I spread my skirt over thee and
[46:28] covered thy nakedness yay
[46:30] I swear into thee and entered into
[46:31] covenant with thee saith the Lord and
[46:33] thou became as - now she's old enough to
[46:36] marry and God says I've espoused you
[46:39] you're mine then washed IV with water
[46:43] yay I thoroughly washed away thy blood
[46:45] from thee and i anointed thee with oil i
[46:49] clothed thee also with broidered work
[46:52] and shoddy with badger skin and I gird
[46:55] the about with fine linen and I cover
[46:57] thee with silk I decked thee also with
[47:00] ornaments see that day see the
[47:02] connection he's getting engaged he's
[47:04] gonna get married so he gives the bride
[47:06] all these ornaments because she's a mare
[47:09] marriageable age and I put bracelets
[47:13] upon thy hands there's bracelets right
[47:15] we talked about bracelets and a chain on
[47:17] thy neck there's the chains there's
[47:20] necklace and I put a jewel on their
[47:22] forehead now I'm not even I don't even
[47:24] have any scholar scripture for that I
[47:25] don't even go there cuz I think I don't
[47:28] can't even understand it and earrings in
[47:31] nine ears and a beautiful crown upon
[47:34] thine head remember this is all
[47:36] spiritual speaking that was I'm sorry
[47:40] this was now decked with gold and silver
[47:42] and thy arraignment was a fine linen of
[47:44] silk and embroidered work thou didst eat
[47:46] fine flour and honey and oil and thou
[47:49] was exceeding beautiful and that is
[47:51] prosper until Kingdom does God like a
[47:53] woman that looks pretty you better
[47:55] believe it
[47:55] but Rahab said it's in a woman to want
[47:58] to be pretty he said there's nothing
[48:00] wrong with a woman who wants to be
[48:02] pretty because she wants to be pretty to
[48:05] be a blessing to her husband right and
[48:07] then
[48:07] case she wants to be a blessing to God
[48:10] now of course we know this context she
[48:12] fell away from her love for God just
[48:15] like Israel after they came in the
[48:16] promised land after Joshua died the
[48:18] judges came they fell away they fell out
[48:20] of love with God now look at 14 and
[48:24] Irene and
[48:26] it was perfect through my calm leanness
[48:29] which I put on these saith the Lord God
[48:31] so who put all these ornaments on the
[48:33] woman God did God made her look extra
[48:36] special God made her look extra
[48:38] beautiful but thou distrust in thine own
[48:41] beauty
[48:42] Oh here's where the trouble comes that's
[48:44] my brother may have said yeah you can
[48:45] wear jewelry but just make sure doesn't
[48:47] become a source of pride and plays the
[48:51] harlot because of thy renown and poured
[48:53] out my foreign occasions on every one
[48:56] that passed by his it was can you
[48:59] imagine every men that came by God did
[49:01] all this
[49:02] can you imagine God picking up the baby
[49:04] whose umbilical cord I don't know how
[49:06] that even would work how the umbilical
[49:07] cords not cut cut the umbilical cord
[49:09] train the baby up raise the baby up it'd
[49:13] be a spouse to the baby and then instead
[49:16] of that woman being in love with God she
[49:18] wants every other man but God and that's
[49:21] how the church is right they want every
[49:22] other blessing except the real Word of
[49:24] God they don't want the preowned
[49:26] preaching of the word of God they'll
[49:27] take every other every other doctrine
[49:29] every other thing out there every other
[49:30] thing that shines they'll take
[49:32] everything else except the true Word of
[49:34] God look at verse 17
[49:42] thou has also
[49:43] taking their jewels of my golden on my
[49:45] silver which I have given thee and maids
[49:48] to thyself images of men and dis commit
[49:50] whoredom with them and took us that boy
[49:52] to garments and covers them and now has
[49:54] set my oil in mine incense before them
[49:58] okay now I'm gonna stop right there I
[50:01] think we can see the picture there so
[50:05] see this is the great balance God
[50:06] Himself talks about adorning his wife in
[50:09] a certain way Rebecca gets adorned a
[50:11] certain way but then remember there's
[50:14] balance to all these things now I'm just
[50:16] gonna kind of preach on earrings this
[50:18] wind I'm sorry this last summer so I'm
[50:20] not gonna spend much time on earrings
[50:21] but let's go to Genesis 35 verse 4 one
[50:30] generation after Rebecca her generation
[50:33] was Isaac and Rebecca one generation
[50:35] after them Isaac was Jacob right Jake
[50:38] was the next generation well after Jacob
[50:40] come down we know he went down to see
[50:42] Laban he came back with his children and
[50:45] he was going to go up to Bethel right
[50:48] but before I could go up to the house of
[50:51] God Jacob said we're gonna clean
[50:53] ourselves out and we're gonna bury
[50:55] everything under this oak tree which was
[50:57] a type of the tree the tree of Christ
[50:59] the cross so Genesis 35 verse 4 and this
[51:03] is where the balance is genesis 35 4 and
[51:11] they gave
[51:13] Jakub all the strange gods which were in
[51:15] their hand and all their earring
[51:16] earrings which were in their ears and
[51:18] jacob hid them under the oak which was
[51:20] by she chim okay so see the balance the
[51:23] previous generation was given all these
[51:25] they must have been passed down to the
[51:27] family but what before Jacob goes up to
[51:30] God's house he's returning to the
[51:32] promised land he's returning to his
[51:34] homeland praise God he's returning to
[51:37] serve God he left he was he ran out of
[51:40] fear he's coming back to his land of
[51:43] possession he's coming back to his
[51:45] promised land and so he buries all these
[51:48] earrings he buries all the strange God's
[51:50] he buries everything that's a hindrance
[51:52] to his family he buries it under the
[51:54] tree and says now I'm ready to serve the
[51:56] Lord so see there's the balance if
[52:00] jewelry and things don't don't cause you
[52:02] to stumble praise the Lord
[52:04] but see when a man gets this like this
[52:06] he wants to rededicate his life if
[52:08] there's any question about anything he's
[52:10] willing to bury it at the cross praise
[52:12] the Lord leave it there at the cross
[52:14] I'll leave it there at the altar I'll
[52:16] get rid of it when I go home after
[52:17] church I'm willing to start afresh
[52:19] I don't want anything that would even
[52:21] tempt me to wanna fall away from the
[52:23] Lord all right hope you can see that by
[52:26] the grace of God remember Rebekah was
[52:28] giving earrings in Genesis 24 22 are not
[52:31] going to go there did you know Joe was
[52:32] given earrings after he was restored he
[52:35] was giving earrings in job 42 11 let's
[52:39] read that Joe 42 11 now again this is
[52:42] where this thought beat might be and
[52:44] this is what I think I've been put in
[52:45] the book to jewelry might have just been
[52:49] a form of currency because they didn't
[52:51] have paper money back then no no we know
[52:52] they had coins but they had bartering if
[52:55] there was no coins or paper they didn't
[52:57] have that ability they would barter they
[52:59] would trade so it may be that job 42:11
[53:10] job 42 11 then came
[53:18] to him all his brethren and all his
[53:20] sisters and all they that have been in
[53:22] his acquaintances before and it eat
[53:24] bread with him in his house and they
[53:27] bemoaned him and comforted him over all
[53:29] the evil that the Lord had brought upon
[53:30] him every man also gave him a piece of
[53:33] money and every one an earring of gold
[53:36] so again there you have a balance I
[53:38] don't know piece of money earring of
[53:40] gold like I said it might have been just
[53:43] the gold for his a family that would
[53:45] come after because we know after this he
[53:46] had sons and daughters I don't know if
[53:48] you knew this we go down to verse 14 and
[53:50] he called the name of the first Jemima
[53:53] and the name of the second keziah and
[53:56] the name of the third Caron topic now
[54:00] who knows what Karen topic means anyone
[54:02] know it means a facial cosmetic and so
[54:07] this it literally means that in a couple
[54:08] of dictionaries one dictionary doesn't
[54:10] so you have like two that says I have
[54:12] three dictionaries
[54:12] Easton's Bible Hebrew lexicon and then
[54:15] Smith's Bible dictionary two of them say
[54:18] that this name means a facial cosmetic
[54:20] which also could mean a facial meant it
[54:23] could mean that but one of them says it
[54:26] means something else so this is what
[54:28] some of the people on YouTube and
[54:30] Facebook have not Facebook YouTube have
[54:33] eat and emailed me about saying OC joke
[54:35] stars for makeup and I say well it
[54:38] doesn't say paint the King James Version
[54:41] for cause facial cosmetic is paint it
[54:44] doesn't say they painted their face so
[54:47] to me it must mean something like maybe
[54:49] just oil you would rub all over your
[54:51] face or something like that much like
[54:53] like a face moisturizer or something
[54:56] like that I don't I don't know but we
[54:58] know there's definite separate words for
[55:01] paint and then point man that's we're
[55:03] gonna look at next
[55:04] but let's I just want to share that with
[55:06] you in case anybody ever says did you
[55:07] know job's daughter met makeup
[55:09] it doesn't mean makeup it means some
[55:12] type of facial cosmetic or appointment
[55:15] or something like that but that's where
[55:17] they get that idea and again remember
[55:19] you never see God's women ever wearing
[55:21] painting their faces you never see that
[55:22] in the scripture now we're not going to
[55:27] turn there but in Exodus 32 when Israel
[55:30] back slid
[55:31] made the the Golden Calf they break off
[55:34] their earrings and gave them to Aaron so
[55:36] remember they were a backslidden people
[55:38] at that point Ishmaelites and judges ate
[55:41] the Ishmaelites were known for wearing
[55:44] earrings and Ishmaelites of course were
[55:47] cursed children they were children of
[55:49] the flesh not children of the promise
[55:52] right so you see that scripture in Hosea
[55:56] 2:13
[55:57] Hosea God told Hosea your your wife was
[56:01] just like Israel she went and played the
[56:03] harlot and she put on earrings and all
[56:05] these things she made herself adorned
[56:08] herself to attract men so again it all
[56:11] depends on your motive and objective
[56:13] behind wearing it the spirit that's on
[56:15] you when you wear these things
[56:17] Isaiah 3 verse 20 we read that last week
[56:20] that showed how the daughters of Zion
[56:23] they had 21 different assessories hon
[56:26] amongst them and God called them unclean
[56:28] God was gonna make them stink and their
[56:31] hair was going to be plucked out and
[56:33] they were because of their their
[56:34] haughtiness because of their pride God
[56:36] was gonna take away all their supposed
[56:39] beauty that they thought they had now
[56:44] here's the principle with earrings I
[56:46] don't see any scripture where a faithful
[56:50] Hebrew or Christian would ever pierce
[56:53] their ears mark their ears or shed blood
[56:56] because all those things are a form of
[56:58] self-mutilation that's what I can see
[57:01] through the scripture okay
[57:03] so that's what I say that's why you know
[57:05] and I said this summer you know I said
[57:07] if somebody walked in here with a clip
[57:08] on earring well I really couldn't say
[57:09] much about it other than I have to
[57:12] preach make sure your heart's right with
[57:13] God that's all I could say now am I
[57:17] gonna teach my girls to wear clip-on
[57:18] earrings not a chance because I don't
[57:21] even want to take one step close to them
[57:24] piercing their ears
[57:25] just like I won't let them put on face
[57:28] paint like when we go to fairs or things
[57:30] like that I'm not gonna let somebody
[57:31] paint their face up because I don't even
[57:33] want them to get one step close to that
[57:35] all right and I and I just believe it's
[57:39] it's safer to stay away from those
[57:41] things and keep yourself unspotted from
[57:44] the world
[57:45] but I would if somebody walked in there
[57:47] like that you know they asked me about
[57:48] it I would say yeah check your check
[57:50] your motive and your objective
[57:52] just like with fingernail polish to me I
[57:55] believe fingernail polish is wrong if
[57:58] it's colorful if it's plain I don't have
[58:00] another I don't have anything against
[58:02] that because it doesn't distract but if
[58:05] it's polished and and painting up well
[58:07] there now you're getting into paint you
[58:09] know no I just want to stay away from
[58:11] paints a man I just don't think I just
[58:14] don't think that's right because who are
[58:16] you trying to press with different
[58:17] colored paint paints on your finger
[58:20] knows what what what practical purpose
[58:23] does that have it's just one step closer
[58:26] to compromise so that's why I don't let
[58:28] my family I just don't see how it
[58:30] glorifies the Lord and again you might
[58:32] go and pay what $50 to get your nails
[58:34] done I don't know sisters I don't know
[58:35] how much it costs I I'm just throwing a
[58:38] number out there but they'll spend $50
[58:40] here now how much of offering did you
[58:42] give that month
[58:44] did you give $50 of offering and it's
[58:46] gonna chip off and all the all these
[58:48] things and they put these fake nails on
[58:50] there now that's that how can that be
[58:51] right - then you can't work like a
[58:53] woman's hands off to work right a
[58:56] woman's hands were made to work in the
[58:59] home and all I can't wash the dishes
[59:02] because I got these long nails on I
[59:04] thought you're supposed to guide the
[59:06] home you were made to your sensitive
[59:10] touch your feminine touch
[59:11] needs to be seen at the home you got to
[59:13] do the feminine jobs the jobs God has
[59:16] built you for so see I just I think it's
[59:20] better just to stay away from all that
[59:22] and direct my family the right way as
[59:25] well like I said the fake tattoos and
[59:28] the face painting anything fake even the
[59:30] sticker tattoos you know where they're
[59:32] just like real small square stickers I
[59:34] just would rather not do any that I just
[59:36] rather stay away from that I'd rather
[59:38] say instead of putting that on put the
[59:40] joy of the Lord on because that will
[59:43] impress people why should they press but
[59:44] that will speak to people more than
[59:46] anything that's just uh gnats unnatural
[59:49] anything man-made put something holy on
[59:52] let that let that get people's attention
[59:54] the fact that you're holy the fact that
[59:57] you're you're loving or
[59:59] or you love the Lord or you have the joy
[1:00:00] of the Lord you got a song of the Lord
[1:00:02] on your heart let that attract people's
[1:00:04] attention and not the things of the
[1:00:05] world
[1:00:06] okay so that was earrings I think we're
[1:00:09] pretty good on earrings I think you
[1:00:10] understand that principle that the all's
[1:00:12] does anyone want anyone need those
[1:00:14] scriptures then anyone need to write it
[1:00:15] down and then we write down any
[1:00:16] scriptures okay let's do two out any
[1:00:18] 1517 and then Exodus 21 six talk about
[1:00:22] the all's okay just in case you need
[1:00:24] those I know even last week somebody
[1:00:25] text me right afterwards when I preached
[1:00:27] on Christian Liberty you remember that
[1:00:28] sermon last week and they said that was
[1:00:30] a great balance of the scripture brother
[1:00:31] Jesse I really appreciate you doing that
[1:00:32] so somebody really was caring about the
[1:00:35] Scriptures so that's why I just want to
[1:00:37] say that okay let's go back there
[1:00:41] tattoos most of us know tattoos that
[1:00:44] just read out one scripture just so you
[1:00:46] have it Leviticus 19:28 let's go there
[1:00:49] too just so we know it again marking for
[1:00:53] the dead now the sad thing is I
[1:00:55] appreciate cams couple of years ago and
[1:00:58] my brother one of my brothers came to
[1:01:00] visit one who doesn't follow the message
[1:01:03] and brother Simon after I preached about
[1:01:06] Simon said that was the most brave
[1:01:07] sermon he ever heard because I just tore
[1:01:09] into makeup and tattoos and pants on
[1:01:13] women I just told you children remember
[1:01:15] that service when we had okay and I
[1:01:19] didn't I guess I didn't really feel I
[1:01:20] was just felt led of the Lord you know I
[1:01:22] think the sermon was called the few who
[1:01:24] are truly born again I think that's was
[1:01:26] the name of the sermon well anyways
[1:01:28] during the sermon I just felt led to
[1:01:29] preach on tattoos it wasn't even in my
[1:01:31] notes but afterwards my brother had a
[1:01:33] tattoos the one who doesn't bless you
[1:01:37] the one who doesn't go to the message
[1:01:38] church and he said his little boys heard
[1:01:41] me preaching that and he went and he
[1:01:42] said the little boys went up to the dad
[1:01:44] after the service said dad you got a
[1:01:45] tattoo that's wrong and my brother
[1:01:48] texted me and said thank you for
[1:01:50] preaching that he said because I knew it
[1:01:52] was wrong and he got a tattoo to honor
[1:01:54] one of his friends who died young he got
[1:01:56] a tattoo to honor the dead that's what
[1:01:59] the Bible said you don't make a marks to
[1:02:01] honor the dead which was strike is
[1:02:03] interesting you know interesting but
[1:02:06] even that and I wasn't trying to preach
[1:02:08] on my brother I haven't forgot he had a
[1:02:09] tattoo I could
[1:02:10] remember that was years ago but it was
[1:02:13] just encouraging when you preach God's
[1:02:14] Word it will discern people's hearts
[1:02:18] it'll show what's really in their heart
[1:02:21] and I thought that was beautiful that
[1:02:23] these little children even little boys
[1:02:25] you know 2nd 3rd 4th grade
[1:02:26] he can hear God's Word and believe it
[1:02:29] and then encourage their parents not to
[1:02:31] disobey God's Word I know that's
[1:02:33] beautiful
[1:02:34] the biggest 1928 okay here's this you
[1:02:38] shall not make any cuttings in your
[1:02:40] flesh for the dead nor print any marks
[1:02:44] upon you I'm the Lord so there's two two
[1:02:46] restrictions not for the dead nor any
[1:02:47] other marks see God doesn't want those
[1:02:50] on you why because you are the Temple of
[1:02:53] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:54] you're not see that just draws attention
[1:02:56] in the flesh how many brothers know that
[1:02:58] that was the temptation all you got big
[1:03:00] muscles you should put a big barb that's
[1:03:02] that was the temptation when I was
[1:03:03] growing up the barbed wire one of the
[1:03:05] football players at Ohio State started
[1:03:07] the barbed wire and so every Friday when
[1:03:09] we had games we would draw a barbed wire
[1:03:10] on our arms to try to make ourselves
[1:03:11] feel like we're somebody special what
[1:03:14] does it do it exalts the flesh but no
[1:03:16] flesh will glory in God's presence none
[1:03:19] of that will glory in God's presence a
[1:03:22] member bales profits cut themselves they
[1:03:24] mark themselves first Kings 18 the
[1:03:27] maniac of Gadara cut himself with stones
[1:03:29] mark 5 2 through 5 ok think I'm done
[1:03:36] with that
[1:03:40] okay now augments now this will be brand
[1:03:42] new I don't think I've ever preached one
[1:03:44] service on aunt mins before this will be
[1:03:47] brand new for us here by the grace of
[1:03:49] the Lord so let me pull this up I have
[1:03:53] my notes on both of these devices let me
[1:03:55] pull this up real quick so I can get
[1:03:56] right to the scripture and we'll go to
[1:03:59] that ok the first one will be proverbs
[1:04:03] 27 9 let's go to proverbs 27 9 now as
[1:04:10] your
[1:04:10] they're anointment is a South or unjú
[1:04:16] int I'm not probably probably not saying
[1:04:18] that right
[1:04:19] my wife will correct me when I get home
[1:04:21] unguent a salvo run went for application
[1:04:24] of the skin and a Sal vis a fatty or
[1:04:27] oily substance smooth and greasy and
[1:04:28] texture or appearance I think we all
[1:04:30] know what a Sal vis like lip balm and
[1:04:33] something like that
[1:04:34] an ointment now here's the point I'm
[1:04:38] trying to make paint was the King King
[1:04:43] James way to describe facial cosmetics
[1:04:46] or makeup not aunt Minh Point mint was
[1:04:48] always for the skin and for the body
[1:04:50] paint was the word used for face
[1:04:53] painting the face like I said with job's
[1:04:55] daughter there might have been some
[1:04:56] ointment you rubbed on your face there
[1:04:58] might have been but let's read this
[1:05:02] proverbs 27 9-point Minh and perfume
[1:05:05] rejoiced the heart sewed up the
[1:05:08] sweetness of a man's friend by hearty
[1:05:10] counsel so these have the same effects a
[1:05:15] friendly friend a friend that makes you
[1:05:18] happy it's the same effect that same
[1:05:21] effect it has on you is the same effect
[1:05:23] in the Bible days that perfume and
[1:05:25] oilmen would have upon a dirty person
[1:05:28] right clean yourself up make yourself
[1:05:31] feel fresh and clean like for us it like
[1:05:34] we feel after taking a shower in our day
[1:05:36] that's kind of what it'd be like but
[1:05:37] they didn't have access to showers all
[1:05:39] the time so we know they had to do that
[1:05:41] so the same effect a shower has for us
[1:05:43] or you know putting the lotion on or
[1:05:45] whatever you do I don't know sisters
[1:05:47] what you did your minds can get so dry
[1:05:49] in the winter I have to put coconut oil
[1:05:51] over my head because it just it's flaky
[1:05:53] white because it's so dry my hands get
[1:05:55] flaky white because it's so dry so I
[1:05:57] guess I do a little bit of ointment but
[1:05:58] not too much I've had sisters more do
[1:06:02] that but the point is pointman is not
[1:06:05] the same as painting the face the next
[1:06:09] one I like this one Solomon was decked
[1:06:14] anointment too he was he had rubbed upon
[1:06:17] him Song of Solomon won three Song of
[1:06:21] Solomon won three
[1:06:34] now it either seems like Solomon had him
[1:06:36] on him which we would imagine the kings
[1:06:38] and royal people would have their bodies
[1:06:42] clean I believe they would do that but
[1:06:45] here it compares it to his name so the
[1:06:49] clean body is likened to a good name
[1:06:52] Song of Solomon 1 verse 3 because of the
[1:06:55] savour of thy good aunt 'men same is as
[1:06:58] ointment poured forth there for do the
[1:07:03] Virgin's love thee
[1:07:04] so because Solomon was clean he was a
[1:07:07] nice-looking King you know he was
[1:07:10] adorned very well his name because he
[1:07:13] was anointed his name was as augment
[1:07:16] poured forth so a sweet smell like a
[1:07:18] perfume or a sweet smell in a room and
[1:07:21] therefore the Virgin's love him so see
[1:07:25] there's in those days there was so
[1:07:26] valuable have fragrances now those are
[1:07:29] natural fragrances now my wife tells me
[1:07:31] honey no the perfumes and stuff like
[1:07:33] that today they got bad chemicals some
[1:07:34] of them do so you got to be careful what
[1:07:36] perfumes you wear I'm gonna have some
[1:07:38] you know manmade chemicals that are not
[1:07:40] very healthy so you want to be careful
[1:07:42] you know the perfumes that you wear for
[1:07:43] your health as well
[1:07:47] okay so there's Solomon with joint mints
[1:07:58] okay the next one let's go to Solomon
[1:08:02] for tennis I was reading a little text
[1:08:05] there I don't know if I should read it
[1:08:06] or not
[1:08:06] so I'm Solomon 410 now here is where
[1:08:10] smell the power of smell or fragrance is
[1:08:14] linked to aunt mints and that's why
[1:08:17] pointman is not even used for facial
[1:08:20] pain or makeup because the smell of
[1:08:22] ointment was what was most important the
[1:08:24] smell of it and the cleanliness that it
[1:08:26] brought and so makeup sisters does
[1:08:30] makeup have any smells it's supposed to
[1:08:31] make you smell good makeup oh they can't
[1:08:33] have makeup that make you smell good I
[1:08:35] didn't know that I didn't think they
[1:08:37] would
[1:08:38] I guess they pull out all the stops now
[1:08:41] but in the scripture I can't find
[1:08:44] anything where the makeup would make
[1:08:47] them smell better because the Bible said
[1:08:49] don't let the harlot take take you with
[1:08:51] her eyes so we know there was something
[1:08:53] seductive about the eyes but like
[1:08:55] rubberband talks about they make their
[1:08:57] eyes look like cats you know they they
[1:08:59] try to make them look animalistic which
[1:09:01] applies which applies to the beastly
[1:09:04] sensual nature of humans right that
[1:09:07] don't have the Holy Ghost they feed off
[1:09:09] the sensual temptations or the beastly
[1:09:12] temptation so there you go for that Song
[1:09:15] of Solomon 410 how fair is that I love
[1:09:17] my sister my spouse how much better is
[1:09:19] thy love than line and the smell of
[1:09:23] thine ointments than all spices so it's
[1:09:26] the smell it's the fragrance of the
[1:09:28] ointments they would rub upon themselves
[1:09:33] now next we'll just read it but I'll
[1:09:39] just say it in Ruth 3 verse 3 Naomi told
[1:09:42] Ruth and if you want to if you want Boaz
[1:09:45] to accept you as a wife you've got to go
[1:09:48] wash yourself and anoint yourself I
[1:09:50] remember that so she had to be anointed
[1:09:53] she had to put ointment on should to
[1:09:55] make herself presentable
[1:09:57] Jesus when he went to the Simon's room
[1:09:59] Oh No yeah when wet in Simon's house he
[1:10:02] said my head with oil thou does not
[1:10:04] anoint but this woman hath anointed my
[1:10:07] feet with ointment
[1:10:08] there's the perfume the ointment perfume
[1:10:11] so this says olive oil went on the heads
[1:10:15] when you clean your face
[1:10:16] Olive Oyl went on your head hair
[1:10:19] everything like that olive oil like we
[1:10:21] got right here olive oil
[1:10:23] the only mint though in this case went
[1:10:27] on Jesus's feet and Jesus said as far as
[1:10:30] your physical appearance when you fast
[1:10:32] anoint thine head and wash 9 face so
[1:10:36] there's another use of olive oil on the
[1:10:39] head alright let's go to Psalms 104 15
[1:10:47] Psalms 104 15 malachi can read out when
[1:10:51] you're ready buddy alright so this is
[1:11:00] something very important in those days
[1:11:02] it was important to have oil to make
[1:11:04] your face shine notice it didn't say
[1:11:06] paint to make your face shine it didn't
[1:11:09] say that the bike we always got to look
[1:11:10] at the context in every scripture
[1:11:11] there's a total separation between
[1:11:13] painting and oils or ointments right
[1:11:16] total separation between those things
[1:11:19] there's three scriptures on paint always
[1:11:22] connected to immoral women and seduction
[1:11:24] and lust and judgments and then the
[1:11:27] ointments are always spoke of something
[1:11:28] good something that smells good
[1:11:30] something that makes you clean something
[1:11:32] that makes you look happy alright asked
[1:11:35] her to verse 12 I've had so many people
[1:11:38] tell me well Esther wore makeup but the
[1:11:39] Bible never said she wore makeup
[1:11:41] Esther 2:12 now when every maid Stern
[1:11:44] was come in to the King Ahasuerus after
[1:11:48] that she had been 12 months according to
[1:11:50] the manner the women for so were the
[1:11:52] days of her purification 'he's
[1:11:54] accomplished to it six months with oil
[1:11:57] of myrrh and six months with sweet
[1:12:01] odours and with other things for the
[1:12:03] purifying of women make up is never said
[1:12:07] to purify anyone right
[1:12:11] how does makeup purify your body it
[1:12:14] doesn't in fact there's numerous women
[1:12:16] that came on my page supporting me
[1:12:18] saying I used to put on makeup but then
[1:12:20] I read about all the awful chemicals in
[1:12:22] it don't purify it tarnishes you it
[1:12:26] taints your body right so all
[1:12:30] these things were done to s-sir to
[1:12:31] purify her not to taint her and it never
[1:12:35] says she painted her face like Jezebel
[1:12:37] never says that now Adam Clark the godly
[1:12:42] preacher of the 1800's said this the
[1:12:48] most beautiful of all the young virgins
[1:12:49] of all the province of Babylon were to
[1:12:51] be selected now notice Esther's going up
[1:12:53] against the most beautiful the beautiful
[1:12:55] she's taking on the most beautiful
[1:12:57] virgins of all Babylon and she won glory
[1:13:02] amen and these were taken out of all the
[1:13:05] classes of people indiscriminately
[1:13:07] consequently there must have been many
[1:13:09] who were brought up in low life not just
[1:13:12] rich women for we know that those who
[1:13:15] feed on core strong food which is not
[1:13:17] easily digested to have generally a
[1:13:19] copyist perspiration and that's true too
[1:13:21] my wife was tell me about certain people
[1:13:24] certain people can smell people's
[1:13:28] fragrances and it kind of tells what
[1:13:30] they've been eating and my wife even
[1:13:33] read one online in a real article where
[1:13:36] a person could smell a disease because
[1:13:39] it was express our body odor I think it
[1:13:43] was my wife was telling me about last
[1:13:44] night of all of all times she'd even
[1:13:47] know was gonna breach this so the king
[1:13:50] one of the women had to go through six
[1:13:52] months up here a year of purification so
[1:13:54] their bodies would smell the right way
[1:13:56] too because he took poor women rich
[1:13:58] women get to make sure their diets were
[1:14:00] changed and make sure the oils and aunt
[1:14:03] meant that were on their body produced
[1:14:05] the right kind of fragrance this is
[1:14:08] striking so see the food you eat causes
[1:14:12] you to produce a certain kind of smell
[1:14:16] that's why I was wondering some people
[1:14:18] smell like McDonald's all the time or
[1:14:21] Burger King that used to be me by the
[1:14:24] way
[1:14:24] not anymore no but it actually makes you
[1:14:27] yeah if you eat the wrong food it makes
[1:14:29] you smell bad it makes your body smell
[1:14:32] bad now says this in many though in very
[1:14:37] respect amiable and even beautiful this
[1:14:40] odor is far from being pleasant pure
[1:14:43] hosts
[1:14:44] wholesome easily digested and nourishing
[1:14:46] ailment I'm sorry alignment with the
[1:14:49] frequent use of a hot bath continued for
[1:14:51] 12 months the body frequently rubbed
[1:14:54] with olive oil will in almost every case
[1:14:56] remove all that is disagreeable this
[1:14:59] kind this treatment will give a healthy
[1:15:02] action to all the sub sub contentious
[1:15:06] vessels I don't know what that means
[1:15:07] dirty vessels and in every respect
[1:15:09] promote health and comfort so see she
[1:15:11] was going to make sure she got a the
[1:15:13] king was gonna make sure all these women
[1:15:14] got a bath regularly right and rub all
[1:15:18] these ornaments on him and oils and make
[1:15:20] sure she's eating the right kind of
[1:15:22] foods so her body puts forth a purified
[1:15:24] smell and this is what the historians
[1:15:28] say so the Bible never says s or
[1:15:34] painters her face the bible said she
[1:15:36] just purified her body just purified it
[1:15:40] how many people know that when a person
[1:15:43] came into God's presence the old
[1:15:45] testament they had to be holy and clean
[1:15:47] let me know that we don't have time to
[1:15:50] read all this remember the priests had
[1:15:52] to wash their hands at the Laver before
[1:15:54] they entered the holy place the priests
[1:15:58] were not to sweat in God's presence in
[1:16:01] Ezekiel 44 that's why they didn't wear
[1:16:03] wool that wear linen not wool linen
[1:16:08] Israel how do we know that God told
[1:16:10] Moses tell them to wash their bodies and
[1:16:13] wash their clothes so they're clean in
[1:16:16] three days when I meet them on Mount
[1:16:18] Sinai
[1:16:18] I remember that God wanted his people
[1:16:22] clean when they came into his presence
[1:16:25] so God loves beauty God loves
[1:16:28] cleanliness because God knows if you're
[1:16:31] not clean what's gonna happen you're
[1:16:33] gonna get diseased you're gonna get
[1:16:35] infections you're gonna have swellings
[1:16:37] you're gonna have all kinds of bad
[1:16:39] things happen to you God loves Beauty
[1:16:43] now go to Psalms 27 for let's read that
[1:16:51] Psalms 27 for Libya can you read that
[1:16:53] when you get at psalms 27 for Amen why
[1:17:07] did they even would always be in church
[1:17:09] why did David always want to be near the
[1:17:11] ark so he could see the glory and the
[1:17:13] beauty of God amen
[1:17:16] how did who you see God's presence was a
[1:17:18] beautiful thing and so God said when you
[1:17:20] come into my presence I want you to be
[1:17:22] beautiful too
[1:17:23] that's why King Ahasuerus right the king
[1:17:25] said the women got to be purified they
[1:17:28] got to be beautiful aren't you glad
[1:17:29] Christ is purifying you praise God amen
[1:17:32] he gives you a hot bath after a hot bath
[1:17:35] purification pointment after ointment
[1:17:38] but it's the eye salve amen it's the
[1:17:40] white garments he's giving you spiritual
[1:17:42] beauty amen that's right
[1:17:45] God loves David love God's beauty we
[1:17:47] love God's beauty and God makes
[1:17:50] everything beautiful in his own time the
[1:17:54] clothes that God designed for the high
[1:17:56] priests in Exodus 20:8 were designed
[1:17:59] specifically for glory and beauty amen
[1:18:03] that's what David said in your presence
[1:18:05] is glory and beauty so God said I'm
[1:18:07] gonna dress you in glory beauty so you
[1:18:10] match my glory beauty amen and we've got
[1:18:13] the righteousness of Jesus Christ that's
[1:18:16] what makes us glory and beautiful praise
[1:18:18] God amen hallelujah so that's the major
[1:18:26] scriptures I preached or I've seen in
[1:18:29] verses ointments versus makeup does that
[1:18:32] help by God's grace I hope that was it
[1:18:34] help to you in some way shape or form
[1:18:35] like I said it's gonna be helped if you
[1:18:37] talk to people because they're gonna
[1:18:38] always bring up Esther and you can
[1:18:41] always say well they never said she
[1:18:42] painted her face she just put mints okay
[1:18:44] oil salves she just rubbed salves upon
[1:18:48] her took baths frequently change their
[1:18:50] diet in order to produce the right kind
[1:18:52] of cleanliness for the king all right
[1:18:56] that's most of my scripture now let's
[1:18:59] start looking at some of
[1:19:02] Changez here let's start looking at some
[1:19:04] of the changes and we'll close with this
[1:19:08] here how am i doing on time well I'm
[1:19:09] doing real good on time man
[1:19:12] thank the Lord okay I think yeah this
[1:19:15] was good okay okay so 1800s how many
[1:19:20] know who that is even know who that is
[1:19:23] Amelia bloomer Amelia bloomer and she is
[1:19:29] known for creating the bloomers bloomers
[1:19:34] were pants that the woman would wear
[1:19:36] under the skirts on this is a real short
[1:19:38] skirt but these are the bloomers in this
[1:19:42] case the bloomers yeah would be these
[1:19:45] pants underneath this now this is out in
[1:19:47] California when bloomers first struck
[1:19:50] guess where they were popular first out
[1:19:51] west
[1:19:52] there's something about out west where
[1:19:55] it's really awful you know all the evil
[1:19:58] things happen out west they come East
[1:20:00] but let me go back to that picture her
[1:20:02] bloomers haven't even longer skirts
[1:20:04] okay now this happened around the
[1:20:06] mid-1800s I'm gonna read the history in
[1:20:07] just a moment she had pants under there
[1:20:10] and that that just made every that made
[1:20:11] most people upset she tried to get a
[1:20:14] movement started and the movement really
[1:20:17] didn't go very far like I said it was
[1:20:19] acceptable in a few cities like Allen
[1:20:21] California and a few other places but by
[1:20:23] the end of her life she died and all the
[1:20:26] people around her had given up the
[1:20:27] movement too for women to wear bloomers
[1:20:29] or pants under their skirts because all
[1:20:32] the preachers were saying it's wrong
[1:20:33] it's wrong it's wrong and the people
[1:20:35] still had some sense of holiness which
[1:20:38] we know they lack today okay now let me
[1:20:41] read some of the history here as we're
[1:20:42] looking at some of these pictures I just
[1:20:43] have those two pictures and what I'll do
[1:20:47] is I'm gonna read the history I got you
[1:20:50] know I got numerous historical
[1:20:51] references for each time period so let
[1:20:54] me pull these up and I'll try to have
[1:20:58] pictures like I said for each time
[1:20:59] period now in the 1800s the only people
[1:21:05] known for wearing tight form-fitting
[1:21:07] pants and showed their bloomers was
[1:21:10] prostitutes and they did it in theaters
[1:21:13] which were connected to brothel house
[1:21:16] in other words whorehouses so that's
[1:21:19] where we have the association there's
[1:21:21] some association between actresses and
[1:21:24] prostitution can say amen to
[1:21:26] that
[1:21:26] just like today the most famous
[1:21:28] actresses they're also the ones who
[1:21:30] sleep with the most people in the movies
[1:21:32] right who show off their bodies or
[1:21:34] expose themselves in nude pictures and
[1:21:37] all new movies and all kinds of things
[1:21:39] like that that's what they do they're
[1:21:41] actually literally prostitutes today
[1:21:43] they're modern-day prostitutes but
[1:21:47] that's the only place in the 1800s where
[1:21:49] you would find tight clothes or women
[1:21:51] showing off their garments under
[1:21:54] garments that's where you found it in
[1:21:55] the 1800s Amelia bloomer
[1:22:00] introduced the bloomers in 1851 most
[1:22:05] people rejected it because they were
[1:22:06] preaching Deuteronomy 22:5 and that's
[1:22:08] literal history I found that in a book
[1:22:10] by two women who are not Christians they
[1:22:13] found history that said the preachers
[1:22:14] preach Deuteronomy 22:5 the woman shall
[1:22:17] not wear that which a man puts on if a
[1:22:24] woman was caught wearing pants and
[1:22:25] places she could be punishable by arrest
[1:22:27] and imprisonment and fines bloomers were
[1:22:32] most accepted by prostitutes and women
[1:22:36] and lesbians this is according to the
[1:22:38] same woman
[1:22:47] one place where women could wear pants
[1:22:50] was in women's universities so in the
[1:22:53] 1870s women started having their own
[1:22:55] universities and they were getting so
[1:22:57] smart now they're educated and they got
[1:22:59] so smart that they let them cross dress
[1:23:02] but only to do their theater plays so
[1:23:06] see this is how this is how they would
[1:23:08] compromise well these girls they're not
[1:23:10] actually prostitutes and they wouldn't
[1:23:12] let any men there so see that we can
[1:23:14] break God's Word as long as they're not
[1:23:17] physically committing adultery or
[1:23:19] whoredom and then no men see it but
[1:23:23] that's wrong if you're only given two
[1:23:26] choices to break the word a little bit
[1:23:27] or a lot Charles Spurgeon said do
[1:23:30] neither if you've only got two choices
[1:23:33] we'll break this or break that he said
[1:23:35] do none of them amen
[1:23:37] and so see this is what they see see
[1:23:39] anytime people compromise it's going to
[1:23:42] catch up with them that little seed of
[1:23:45] unbelief is going to grow if it doesn't
[1:23:47] get cut out like Jeremiah said God said
[1:23:51] Jeremiah you've got to uproot that seed
[1:23:53] you've got to uproot that unbelief and
[1:23:56] if people let us in hang around it's
[1:23:58] eventually going to kill them it's
[1:24:01] exactly right and so see where did this
[1:24:04] start how to get started publicly with
[1:24:06] the smart college-educated women see
[1:24:10] you're get so smart but radical you get
[1:24:12] so smart you get so far away from God
[1:24:14] there's nothing wrong with you know I
[1:24:16] know people in here have college degrees
[1:24:17] I haven't cause there's nothing wrong
[1:24:18] with that as long as you filter
[1:24:20] everything by the Word of God and I'm
[1:24:23] thankful I never had to take one quiz in
[1:24:25] my science classes I never had to take
[1:24:26] one quiz that said I believe in
[1:24:28] evolutions I never had to compromise on
[1:24:29] that I'm thankful for that I don't I
[1:24:34] really don't know anybody who has I
[1:24:35] don't myself but see a Christian can be
[1:24:38] faithful like I know people that quit
[1:24:40] college as soon they came in the message
[1:24:42] and they regretted it later because they
[1:24:44] had scholarship money but they
[1:24:46] immediately thought oh it's education
[1:24:48] God can't be in that well what about
[1:24:50] Martin Luther what about John Wesley
[1:24:52] they were very well educated and God
[1:24:55] they were God's stars for the age that
[1:24:57] God let them shine because they didn't
[1:25:00] let the edge
[1:25:01] exalt themselves in fact they used it to
[1:25:03] spread the gospel amen that's why I
[1:25:05] think God allowed me to be a teacher and
[1:25:07] going to schools and learn how to write
[1:25:10] a book right because I wrote all those
[1:25:13] videos of the videos are helping people
[1:25:14] around the world I basically took all
[1:25:16] the my education and instruction and
[1:25:18] made these little videos which are just
[1:25:21] books on a video and they're helping
[1:25:23] people today I just I see God's hand in
[1:25:26] an amen that's where I see so that's
[1:25:29] where it's starting to get a little bit
[1:25:31] of momentum for women in pants
[1:25:35] now with makeup frowned upon oh yeah in
[1:25:38] the 1800s the only people that wore
[1:25:39] makeup were prostitutes but the women
[1:25:42] started wanting to look like them so
[1:25:44] guess what they did here's what they did
[1:25:46] to make themselves look like they're
[1:25:47] wearing makeup they drank vinegar and
[1:25:48] ate chalk to give them a real pale
[1:25:51] complexion now you tell me it was a real
[1:25:53] Christian woman do that I get up in the
[1:25:56] morning I say my prayers and I eat some
[1:25:58] chalk to try to make myself look pale
[1:25:59] can you imagine like what kind of a
[1:26:02] Christian woman would do that so see
[1:26:04] these are things that the heathens were
[1:26:06] doing or we'd say the organized
[1:26:08] religious the denominational people you
[1:26:11] can you imagine real Holy Ghost field
[1:26:12] saying that pray read their Bible and
[1:26:14] prayed and clap in the church and spoke
[1:26:16] in tongues and shouted and said a man do
[1:26:19] you imagine a woman like that with pale
[1:26:21] face and chok chok coming out of her
[1:26:23] teeth or something like that can you
[1:26:25] imagine that you can't because a real
[1:26:28] Holy Ghost feels Saint today don't care
[1:26:30] about it either she's not trying to look
[1:26:32] like the and the prostitutes
[1:26:34] she's trying to look like Steven who had
[1:26:36] the face of an angel amen
[1:26:37] the glory of God on her face yeah by the
[1:26:46] end of
[1:26:46] her life bloomer and her colleagues gave
[1:26:49] up the fight they all quit because their
[1:26:51] their movement wasn't catching traction
[1:26:53] it wasn't catching traction they even
[1:26:55] gave up and you know what caused a lot
[1:26:58] of people the bicycle cause a lot of
[1:27:00] women towards the end of the century
[1:27:02] 1890s the bicycle got so popular and I
[1:27:06] have in this book this is a book I
[1:27:07] brought from library one of the chapters
[1:27:09] is called the devil's devices and it
[1:27:13] shows how bicycles were a tool a lot of
[1:27:17] women used to go on sneak off with
[1:27:19] boyfriends and get pregnant and then
[1:27:21] also to wear pants and see how the bikes
[1:27:26] Cove itself is not a bad thing it
[1:27:28] depends how you use it right but this
[1:27:32] move got God cut this move short by
[1:27:34] bringing forth the automobile and then
[1:27:37] women couldn't drive for a while but
[1:27:39] anyways it was just showing it was just
[1:27:40] interesting to see this and everything
[1:27:42] that came out Satan would use it as a
[1:27:44] device as a tool all the technology we
[1:27:47] use it tool but then God's people would
[1:27:49] always use it the right way
[1:27:50] education bikes for the gospel right
[1:27:53] cars planes to preach right Internet to
[1:27:56] take the gospel everywhere amen
[1:27:58] all right now let's get back let's go
[1:28:00] past there now I think I got most of the
[1:28:02] those are the main points for the 1800s
[1:28:07] okay now the 1910s women would not be
[1:28:12] caught dead wearing pants and plug
[1:28:13] public that's what this reference says
[1:28:15] by 1915 skirts had shortened to the
[1:28:18] ankle so skirts were down to the ground
[1:28:19] by 1915 they came up about four inches
[1:28:23] see little by little Satan moves it up
[1:28:26] that's what the historical articles say
[1:28:28] World War one lasted from 1914 to 1918
[1:28:32] during the war men went away the women
[1:28:34] went into factories and a lot of them
[1:28:36] wore pants and they started getting a
[1:28:38] lot of money they started getting
[1:28:39] independence when the boys came back
[1:28:41] most of the women the history says they
[1:28:43] grudgingly went back to wearing skirts
[1:28:45] and working the home but some of them
[1:28:47] didn't and that caused the roaring 20s
[1:28:50] now I hope none of these pictures
[1:28:52] stumble anybody I tried to look this
[1:28:54] might be the only one because it's run a
[1:28:55] little bit of thigh there so I'm sorry
[1:28:57] price you to cover that up
[1:28:58] I missed that one
[1:28:59] but the Roaring Twenties was a time of
[1:29:01] smote women smoking drinking and men
[1:29:03] doing out there did it all together high
[1:29:05] heels and moving up their skirts and
[1:29:07] this is actually a pretty modest picture
[1:29:09] now that woman's a little morally
[1:29:10] dressed there so forgive me for that but
[1:29:13] the Roaring Twenties were an awful awful
[1:29:14] time the Roaring Twenties were the first
[1:29:18] time women ever cut their hair look at
[1:29:21] this a New York newspaper the headline
[1:29:25] can you imagine this the headline is
[1:29:29] this woman right here Irene castle the
[1:29:31] original bobbed hair woman now she had
[1:29:33] just a spaghetti strap on there so I
[1:29:35] covered that up I didn't see that to the
[1:29:37] end so I thought why better cover that
[1:29:38] but look Church this is the headline now
[1:29:41] at the bottom this says barbershops
[1:29:45] being replaced by beauty shops women's
[1:29:48] and provement League reports 20,000
[1:29:52] women weekly adopting new hair dress
[1:29:55] 20,000 women would rush in these shops
[1:29:57] in New York cut my hair cut my hair cut
[1:30:01] my hair one woman who wrote an article
[1:30:04] who lived in the 1920s she said when she
[1:30:08] cut her hair or the 20s she cut her hair
[1:30:10] then she started working because they
[1:30:12] need to work in New York she said the
[1:30:15] men would sit in there and laugh and
[1:30:17] snicker and get upset about the women
[1:30:19] cutting their hair and she said it was
[1:30:20] the biggest decision a woman would make
[1:30:22] in the 1920s was the cut her hair not
[1:30:25] because her husband or boyfriend or
[1:30:27] husband or grandfather father was dead
[1:30:30] set against it it was the biggest
[1:30:32] decision she'd make in her life in the
[1:30:34] 1920s to cut her hair can you imagine
[1:30:38] that night
[1:30:41] so there's Irene castle Roaring Twenties
[1:30:45] awful awful time that's when sports took
[1:30:47] off Babe Ruth and all these guys the
[1:30:50] Jack Dempsey the boxer it just took off
[1:30:52] during that time sports and then
[1:30:55] transportation the nightlife all those
[1:30:58] kind of things took off okay you
[1:31:00] probably know this picture maybe not
[1:31:01] this is Marlene Dietrich in 1933 let me
[1:31:07] look here make sure I got the year right
[1:31:12] she wore pants for she's a movie star
[1:31:15] she wore pants in Paris and the Paris
[1:31:18] chief of police wrote her letter and
[1:31:19] said if you don't get back in women's
[1:31:21] clothes I'm kicking you out of Paris and
[1:31:23] this was the pictures so you know what
[1:31:26] she did she changed back into a woman's
[1:31:29] dress but she kept the men's suit and
[1:31:32] hat and everything she kept all that on
[1:31:34] and they let her stay the first one of
[1:31:37] the first women to ever wear pants out
[1:31:39] in public here's the next one
[1:31:43] Audrey Hepburn she did the same thing
[1:31:45] one of the first few women to wear pants
[1:31:48] they and they would go out and they'd
[1:31:49] push the limits and then everybody would
[1:31:51] and then they'd stop and that's what
[1:31:52] Satan does today right a new fashion not
[1:31:56] everybody does it at first everybody
[1:31:57] rejects it but then give it a few years
[1:31:58] and then everybody accepts it that's
[1:32:03] either yeah that's Katharine Hepburn not
[1:32:05] Audrey Katharine Hepburn so the 30s were
[1:32:09] 30s and 40s were just filled with people
[1:32:10] just trying it out a little bit just a
[1:32:12] few renegades I'll say like that
[1:32:14] renegades the God's Word but remember
[1:32:16] now this time everybody's cutting their
[1:32:17] hair they're starting to wear makeup now
[1:32:19] that's okay now history says women would
[1:32:22] always be found dabbing their noses with
[1:32:24] powder and painting their faces and all
[1:32:26] kinds of things all over all over public
[1:32:29] because that's what they saw in the
[1:32:30] movie theaters movies became so popular
[1:32:35] in the 1920s and 1930s because the humor
[1:32:37] whoo who remembers the Great Depression
[1:32:39] during the Great Depression history says
[1:32:43] people instead of going to God the
[1:32:45] people flocked by the millions to movie
[1:32:47] theaters and they made the movie so
[1:32:49] cheap that anybody could afford it even
[1:32:51] during the time of the Great Depression
[1:32:52] and so instead of the history literally
[1:32:55] says us instead of going to God they
[1:32:58] went and drown their sorrows to get
[1:33:00] encouraged or they would drink or
[1:33:01] whatever do awful things and then they
[1:33:03] were they would go to movie theaters and
[1:33:04] try to get some type of hope at the
[1:33:06] movie theater look how devilish Satan is
[1:33:09] look how look how evil he is he makes it
[1:33:11] so cheap everybody can afford it the 19
[1:33:17] 40s and 50s again not much changing here
[1:33:20] other than the two-piece bathing suit I
[1:33:22] didn't put a picture that on there
[1:33:23] because I don't want to put bathing
[1:33:24] suits on there but this happened in the
[1:33:26] 19th I'm sorry this is 32 the first
[1:33:29] woman Alice marble the first woman to
[1:33:31] ever wear shorts and play sports and
[1:33:36] they said she played like a man because
[1:33:39] she had man's clothes on look that
[1:33:42] bobbed hair shorts on and that's
[1:33:46] something 1915
[1:33:49] I'm sorry nineteen fifties you could not
[1:33:54] find women in pants and high schools or
[1:33:55] public schools the shocking thing was a
[1:33:57] two-piece two-piece bathing suit and
[1:34:01] capri pants got popular who's that I
[1:34:05] forget who that woman was that might be
[1:34:06] Mary Tyler Moore oh yeah I'm sorry
[1:34:10] that's all thank you Audrey Hepburn
[1:34:11] thank you she's coming up later so he
[1:34:15] had Katharine Hepburn this must have
[1:34:16] been her daughter Audrey Hepburn so she
[1:34:18] was very famous for wearing capri pants
[1:34:20] oh it's her sister really well good for
[1:34:24] you sister I didn't know that really
[1:34:27] that's 20 years later so she must have
[1:34:28] been quite younger yeah cuz Katharine
[1:34:32] was in the 30s and she this is 1952 Yeah
[1:34:37] right right
[1:34:38] yeah that started in the Roaring
[1:34:40] Twenties they got all their vote voting
[1:34:42] rights all these things it started in
[1:34:44] the 20s awful so 40s and 50s like I said
[1:34:51] you had a few renegades now the 60s
[1:34:57] sexual revolution this this the two
[1:35:00] decades that destroyed America were the
[1:35:01] roaring 20s and then the 1960s the
[1:35:04] sexual revolution this is Mary Quant I'm
[1:35:08] not sure how to say her name
[1:35:09] kWe aunt she was a designer in Europe
[1:35:13] and she's the first one to design skirts
[1:35:15] that went above the knee the very first
[1:35:17] one and that's where the miniskirt
[1:35:19] started in the 60s now you probably know
[1:35:24] a lot about the 60s so I'm not gonna say
[1:35:26] a whole lot about that yeah Mary Quant
[1:35:29] that's
[1:35:30] I'm just guessing on the pronunciation
[1:35:33] one of the most awful things of the 60s
[1:35:35] though was unisex clothing hippies they
[1:35:41] started experimenting with drugs pretty
[1:35:43] soon boys grew their hair long girls cut
[1:35:46] their hair girls and the main thing was
[1:35:48] girls wearing men's pants and they all
[1:35:51] were the same shirts and church I
[1:35:54] believe that I believe that was planting
[1:35:56] the seeds for what we have today with
[1:35:58] transgender and people not knowing if
[1:36:00] I'm male or female and then
[1:36:01] homosexuality I believe those were the
[1:36:03] seeds that were planted like the Bible
[1:36:06] said you sow to the wind you reap a
[1:36:08] whirlwind that's how I'm going to end
[1:36:10] the chapter tomorrow hopefully I'll
[1:36:11] finish the chapter tomorrow if you sow
[1:36:13] to the wind you'll reap a whirlwind so
[1:36:17] see the the the the the fashion
[1:36:19] designers were sowing to the wind
[1:36:20] they're just sowing their seeds out
[1:36:22] there they're gonna reap a whirlwind and
[1:36:24] that's what we have today and of course
[1:36:28] homosexuality took off 1970s history
[1:36:32] literally says this the 1970s can be
[1:36:34] summed up in one word pants it literally
[1:36:37] says that one word defines the 70s pants
[1:36:41] women in pen that's Mary Tyler Moore I'm
[1:36:44] pretty sure you're welcome to correct me
[1:36:47] I know that's Dick Van Dyke I know that
[1:36:50] I always knew something was wrong about
[1:36:53] that guy even growing up I knew
[1:36:55] something was wrong he said I thought
[1:36:56] man that's strange fella cuz I saw when
[1:36:58] he was a little older so she was the
[1:37:00] first woman to and I told you this last
[1:37:02] week she's the first woman to wear pants
[1:37:04] on a TV sitcom live on TV but they'd
[1:37:07] only let her wear pants in one segment
[1:37:09] of the show so let's say there's three
[1:37:11] segments of a TV show 30-minute sitcom
[1:37:13] she could only wear pants and one of
[1:37:14] them and that's Mary Tyler Moore she
[1:37:19] just died last year
[1:37:21] women started wearing clothes you could
[1:37:23] see through in the 70s the disco became
[1:37:25] popular on the nightlife drugs all those
[1:37:28] things in the 1970s but women in pants
[1:37:31] was the main one and I have articles
[1:37:33] from my teachers union they sent us
[1:37:35] magazines every month one of them I
[1:37:38] joined the Union in 2004 in 2005 I got a
[1:37:42] magazine with women and pants right on
[1:37:44] the front saying where are unions in
[1:37:47] 1970 and 1971 our unions helped where
[1:37:50] women sir helped women wear pants to
[1:37:53] schools in the 1970s so before that a
[1:37:56] woman could not wear pants to work in a
[1:37:58] school there was always a separation
[1:38:00] between male and female right but
[1:38:03] because of teachers unions they could
[1:38:05] only wear pants if their pants matched
[1:38:07] their top it had to match
[1:38:09] they couldn't wear pants that were of a
[1:38:10] different color than their shirts that's
[1:38:13] striking the 1970s okay
[1:38:20] nineteen oh yeah this is striking 1970s
[1:38:23] it literally says this Levi's launched
[1:38:27] their division four pants in 1968 for
[1:38:30] women so Levi's no one ever made pants
[1:38:33] for women until 1968 Macy's the store
[1:38:38] Macy's wouldn't hire a woman in pants
[1:38:39] until the 1970s nor would AT&T it's
[1:38:43] right here I got it in history 18 T
[1:38:45] would not hire woman and then one of the
[1:38:47] company said yes we'll hire woman as
[1:38:48] long in pants as long as she doesn't act
[1:38:50] like a man that's what history says
[1:38:53] literally what history says now 1980s
[1:38:58] and 90s I didn't put much in there
[1:39:00] because it just got worse and worse you
[1:39:02] had the grunge move you had the punk
[1:39:03] move punk rockers hip hop of the 80s and
[1:39:07] 90s they just showed more and more body
[1:39:11] parts but the the very height of it was
[1:39:15] on the beaches where they would wear
[1:39:17] string bikinis and other pieces of
[1:39:19] articles I don't want to say out loud
[1:39:20] where you basically saw everything
[1:39:23] except the private parts that's
[1:39:25] basically you saw everything in but the
[1:39:26] private parts and I remember as a child
[1:39:28] I remember flipping through Sports
[1:39:29] Illustrated in the 90s and seeing women
[1:39:32] in stream bikinis like what
[1:39:35] and then you know and like I told you I
[1:39:37] got addicted to pornography things like
[1:39:39] that so pretty soon I had those same
[1:39:41] pictures of those women from Sports
[1:39:42] Illustrated hanging all over my walls
[1:39:44] because of the awful temptation that
[1:39:47] that brought so fashion basically
[1:39:52] reached its pinnacle the late 90s you
[1:39:54] know with those type of swimwear pieces
[1:39:57] and then now we're seeing homosexual I
[1:39:59] almost sexuality take over transgender
[1:40:02] take over don't know what else could be
[1:40:04] I don't know what else could be left the
[1:40:06] Bible said in the last days they would
[1:40:08] lose natural affection and we know that
[1:40:10] they don't have the same affection I
[1:40:12] don't have affection for babies so they
[1:40:13] murder them there were no affection the
[1:40:15] men don't have affection for women so
[1:40:16] they have affection for men the women
[1:40:18] don't have affection for men that so
[1:40:20] they have affection for women
[1:40:21] they've lost natural affection and all
[1:40:24] started with cutting the hair it all
[1:40:26] started with wear and makeup it all
[1:40:29] started with these things that we think
[1:40:31] are people might think are so simple but
[1:40:33] they mean a lot to God let me close with
[1:40:36] these two quotes and I'll be done here
[1:40:38] by the grace of the Lord so to make sure
[1:40:41] I don't miss anything
[1:40:45] okay well Graham said now we'll take the
[1:40:50] Pentecostal women she shouldn't wear
[1:40:51] shorts makeup or cut her hair but she
[1:40:53] looks back down to the Methodists and
[1:40:54] say look at that woman do so-and-so say
[1:40:57] the woman let's say the woman don't wear
[1:40:58] shorts but herself with bobbed hair so
[1:41:02] programs comparing a Pentecost and a
[1:41:04] Methodist woman that look at each other
[1:41:06] and they look down on each other but
[1:41:07] they both have both cut their hair they
[1:41:09] wear makeup and they don't live a godly
[1:41:11] life but the Brad said the higher you
[1:41:14] rise in God the more sinful the whole
[1:41:16] thing looks and then sometimes in prayer
[1:41:19] can you think about this sometimes in
[1:41:22] prayer when you imagine when you can
[1:41:24] imagine the Holy Spirit takes you up
[1:41:26] into a sphere then the whole thing looks
[1:41:30] like chaos what women in pants women
[1:41:32] cutting their hair it looks like chaos
[1:41:35] then when you come back down you seem
[1:41:37] like to the people you're a rascal
[1:41:39] you're nothing but an old sarcastic
[1:41:42] because God has taken you so high in hit
[1:41:45] what his holiness amen
[1:41:47] he's taking you home
[1:41:48] in his beauty and his holiness that when
[1:41:51] you come back down you realize this is
[1:41:53] awful
[1:41:53] this is trashy this is disgusting this
[1:41:57] is dirty
[1:41:58] this is abominable to God because God's
[1:42:01] Spirit is so holy and set apart but a
[1:42:04] man said see these that they say you're
[1:42:06] a few you're a fool if you preach it
[1:42:08] because you stand as an old crank always
[1:42:11] rebuking the people about their physical
[1:42:13] appearance but if you ever climb into
[1:42:17] them spheres one time when you can be in
[1:42:18] the presence of God not through emotion
[1:42:20] see that's why most women today in
[1:42:22] denominational churches they just get
[1:42:24] emotional in God's presence
[1:42:25] they really don't climb that high in
[1:42:27] God's presence which in other words
[1:42:29] mother brother Graham calls that bubble
[1:42:31] dancing
[1:42:31] he said there's an anointing for bubble
[1:42:33] dancing you get so happy you just get
[1:42:35] happy he said but when you get into the
[1:42:37] presence of an angel or you get into
[1:42:39] God's presence you feel like you're
[1:42:40] gonna die and that's the difference you
[1:42:43] get so high in God so close to God's
[1:42:46] presence all of this cutting hair makeup
[1:42:48] and pants it it seems so awful
[1:42:51] he said not through emotion but through
[1:42:53] the genuine Holy Spirit lifting you up
[1:42:55] the whole thing is ro ichabod the glory
[1:43:00] of the lord has departed from the whole
[1:43:02] denominational outfit that's right
[1:43:04] there's none of them that's right none
[1:43:06] of them remember Ella Graham said every
[1:43:08] denomination will take the mark of the
[1:43:09] beast every single one of them here's a
[1:43:16] different quote and if you're Church a
[1:43:18] Pentecostal Church that tells you long
[1:43:20] hair and stuff it just finances and you
[1:43:22] got a spare tire in the back of your
[1:43:23] head and so for them kind of things that
[1:43:26] man is possessed of the devil think
[1:43:29] about how many demon-possessed preachers
[1:43:31] we have just in Akron oh you don't gotta
[1:43:34] let your hair grow out where the BAM
[1:43:35] said you're possessed with Satan but
[1:43:38] they don't froth at the mouth they're
[1:43:40] not cutting themselves down they might
[1:43:42] get tattoos that shows they got a wrong
[1:43:44] spirit there but brother have said
[1:43:46] you're possessed of the devil when you
[1:43:48] say you can cut your hair you're fine
[1:43:50] for God's Word said it's a shame for a
[1:43:53] woman to cut her hair should this on her
[1:43:55] head if she desires her husband and her
[1:43:57] husband is the church and the church is
[1:43:59] Christ she is this
[1:44:01] religious prostitute naked and don't
[1:44:03] know it naked don't the Bible say the
[1:44:05] woman's covering her hair isn't her hair
[1:44:08] given to her for a covering to show that
[1:44:11] she's under the headship that means
[1:44:12] she's under she's obeying the leadership
[1:44:15] of her husband who her husband's obeying
[1:44:17] the leadership of Christ and Christ
[1:44:18] obeys a leadership of God and that is
[1:44:25] the order of Authority for the entire
[1:44:27] universe I think about that the whole
[1:44:31] order of the universe is God Christ man
[1:44:34] woman that's the whole order of the
[1:44:36] universe and the way a woman shows that
[1:44:39] is to let her hair grow long the way a
[1:44:42] man shows that cuts his hair someday by
[1:44:47] ministers someday yonder at the judgment
[1:44:50] bar I've tried to pour the medicine
[1:44:52] what's the medicine don't cut your hair
[1:44:54] women men cut your hair women don't wear
[1:44:58] pants women don't wear makeup women
[1:45:00] don't smoke all these things he said I
[1:45:02] pull I've tried to pour the medicine in
[1:45:05] and I'll hold it with my hands and you
[1:45:07] spit it right back out between your
[1:45:09] fingers God will judge them someday
[1:45:14] that's the say at the Lord thus saith
[1:45:18] the Lord so in other words brother
[1:45:20] Graham is preaching and if they're
[1:45:22] sitting in the congregation that's going
[1:45:23] in their mouth right like your parents
[1:45:25] used to force you to take the medicine
[1:45:26] you didn't want to but they stick the
[1:45:28] spoon in there anyway my mom did that or
[1:45:31] she mixed it with some sugary drink or
[1:45:33] something like that maybe some coke but
[1:45:36] then they get sick all this tastes awful
[1:45:38] and it's come spinning out between the
[1:45:40] fingers all women don't have to cut
[1:45:42] their or women can cut their hair we
[1:45:44] don't have to let it grow long or I can
[1:45:45] wear shorts if I want to I can do all
[1:45:47] these things I can wear parents if I
[1:45:48] want to and they're spitting it out and
[1:45:50] wrote and said that's what it'll look
[1:45:51] like on the day of judgment they weren't
[1:45:55] able to digest the medicine of God amen
[1:46:00] it hasn't been
[1:46:01] a bunch of foolishness or some crazy old
[1:46:04] preacher how about a young preacher I'm
[1:46:06] kind of still young right come on it
[1:46:09] encouraged me say Amen
[1:46:10] know some crazy old man all worked up
[1:46:12] pretty soon I'll be old man of God Aires
[1:46:14] it isn't because it's the word of the
[1:46:17] Lord but I can be like brother brand I
[1:46:18] can say oh they say all yours preaching
[1:46:21] it cuz you're old man I say no i preach
[1:46:22] it when I was a young 23 year old man
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:26] I believe it when I was young I believe
[1:46:28] it when it's old because God's Word
[1:46:30] doesn't change Amen see it's not a
[1:46:33] foolishness it's not some crazy old man
[1:46:35] it's the word of the Lord and a genuine
[1:46:38] real Christian will cope with that
[1:46:40] inside man the spirit that was back down
[1:46:42] to the beginning which is the word let's
[1:46:44] stand to our feet by God's grace those
[1:46:47] scriptures are those quotes and
[1:46:49] scriptures just came on my heart as I
[1:46:50] was preparing the last few days I hope
[1:46:52] they were a blessing was that okay by
[1:46:53] God's grace hope it was a blessing and
[1:46:55] like I said if you guys if this church
[1:46:57] you know if you find any pictures like
[1:46:58] this that will help me out please do you
[1:47:01] know please provide it for me I find it
[1:47:03] so fantastic I love sharing these things
[1:47:05] with people because we're in a
[1:47:07] generation that do not know the ways of
[1:47:09] God and for the first time I can't tell
[1:47:13] you I've had numerous people that tell
[1:47:14] me brother Jesse I so enjoyed the meek
[1:47:18] and humble spirit when you presented
[1:47:19] about makeup or pants on those videos
[1:47:21] because we never knew it before people
[1:47:24] appreciate the meekness that it's
[1:47:26] brought in because I never heard it
[1:47:28] before because I never heard it before
[1:47:30] and was brought to me in a meek manner I
[1:47:32] can share it the same way now brother
[1:47:34] Bram he could ball him out because they
[1:47:36] knew better they saw the change he could
[1:47:40] say mrs. dogmeat and they would laugh he
[1:47:42] listened to it they laugh because they
[1:47:45] were raised that way they saw it but if
[1:47:47] we say dogmeat mrs. dogmeat today
[1:47:49] everybody gets upset which they might
[1:47:50] have a right to it's different we're in
[1:47:54] a different age they don't understand
[1:47:56] they never even heard it so we don't
[1:47:58] want to make them we don't want to
[1:47:59] basically say they're dogmeat and not
[1:48:02] give them a chance to repent does every
[1:48:03] understand that but if the Holy Spirit
[1:48:05] knowing that somebody to say mrs.
[1:48:07] dogmeat today that that would be the
[1:48:08] Holy Spirit I'd be up the Holy Spirit
[1:48:10] but I don't choose to go into churches
[1:48:12] and be like that or Bible studies I
[1:48:14] don't go into people
[1:48:15] home and say well if you paint your face
[1:48:16] you're mr. dogmeat because it wasn't
[1:48:19] brought to me that way
[1:48:21] remember the Bible said be wise as a
[1:48:23] serpent harmless as doves right and the
[1:48:27] Bible said in meekness and fear
[1:48:30] correcting those who are in condemnation
[1:48:32] right so you have to go to people that
[1:48:35] are in captivity they're addicted to
[1:48:36] certain worldly things we got to go in
[1:48:38] meekness in the spirit of fear spirit of
[1:48:41] reverence ok praise the Lord all right
[1:48:45] thank the Lord I'm not sure how many
[1:48:49] sermons I'll do on this this might be
[1:48:50] the last one here we'll see but I just
[1:48:53] this isn't this is my thought church I
[1:48:55] thought on a few levels it'd be good to
[1:48:57] review it have you enjoyed the review I
[1:48:59] really have it's really helped me it's
[1:49:01] given me more answers to things I didn't
[1:49:04] have answers for like the Christian
[1:49:05] liberties what are exactly Christian
[1:49:07] liberties also aunt minh thats really
[1:49:09] helped me zimri remember we went over is
[1:49:12] emery that's helped me there's been new
[1:49:15] and this history has helped me and the
[1:49:17] third thing was I can't I don't have
[1:49:20] enough time to study on modesty and then
[1:49:22] preach on other things it kind of comes
[1:49:24] on this I got so much in my life I could
[1:49:27] I have to preach on what I'm studying at
[1:49:29] that time so there was three reasons I
[1:49:31] thought it was a blessing and you know
[1:49:32] see my children witness to my mother
[1:49:34] because this was freshly on their heart
[1:49:36] that's just another vindication and it
[1:49:37] was it was acceptable unto God to do
[1:49:40] that by the grace of the Lord okay
[1:49:44] praise the Lord
[1:49:45] okay me okay once you come here we'll
[1:49:46] see let's think I stand in awe of you
[1:49:51] praise God I don't want to be clean
[1:49:52] before the Lord how many want to have
[1:49:54] his glory and his beauty on them that's
[1:49:57] what I want to praise God then let's

[1:50:01] how beautiful God is how his spirit is

[2:01:33] justification sanctification baptism and
[2:01:35] all he goes she tried to run down that
[2:01:37] narrow highway or that way of holiness
[2:01:40] and fell off or maybe not skip any step
[2:01:45] maybe we walk your steps and then walk
[2:01:48] your way of holiness may we walk it in a
[2:01:52] godly manner Lord God that Lord one day
