TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God here tonight Heavenly Father we just want to tell you one thing we know that remember your people Lord God for amazing we read on Sunday [Music] your trials have changed God rejoice the grace of God revivals thank you preparing us foreign [Music] if I was here tonight like if you would let's go back to First John chapter 3 verse 9 I'd like to continue that thought on as though you never did it in the first place maybe I can finish that tonight here by God's grace First John 3 verse 9. First John 3 verse 9. the scripture we would say is a paradox it's strange or hard to believe but yet it's true praise God there's a part of the believer that cannot sin and never has sin praise God that's God's own life in The Believer praise God First John 3 verse 9. let's read out if we can together First John 3 verse 9. let's begin on three one two three whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God may God has blessings Serena's word may be seated God bless you all it's great to see everybody in the house of the Lord tonight I'd like to maybe finish this up here tonight I'm not quite sure tonight I listened to this portion this is of course the end of the sermon uh of the invisible Union of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom and there's a 20-minute section right towards the end where brother Brown talks about how we've never done it in the first place praise God of course he's talking about the soul as we looked at last time how many thank God for a soul that never did it in the first place praise God there's an anointing that comes upon the believer's soul that's God's own life that's God's Own Spirit the Bible calls it a seed of God and though of course we know if it's a seed what's going to happen it's going to grow praise God that's what brother Adam said when you get the Holy Ghost he said it's like he said it's like the size of a button he said and he said it just grows out the more you feed that the more you hunger on on the things of God the more you feed that spirit inside it just grows out and then what does it produce it produces the fruits of the spirit praise God it produces all these attributes in your life praise God it's like a seed that's watered and it brings forth and and thank God for that praise God that people can see the fruits of God in our lives amen so I'd like to look at this here tonight as though you never did it in the first place again we're looking at the soul of man by God's grace the soul that gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God so I'd like to uh again just read the origin of the sermon belgram ends his sermon in Shreveport and he says you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just a minute you are standing and if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every title how many standing on every word of God tonight hallelujah thank God where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from that Shucks which we have right we've left denominations we've left that we have to make sure we don't become a denomination we have to make sure we keep becoming revived in the Holy Spirit praise God and get out here in the wheat where you can ripe before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete and Justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah amen now if you already brought your Bibles go back to Romans uh seven here I think I just want to read this again just a good reminder here what brother Brown's talking about whatever I was talking about our spiritual relationship with the Lord we were spiritually married to the law we'd say or married to the law of sin and death now Jews of course they would they would have said they were married to Moses's law but we would say if we weren't Jewish we were married to the law of sin and death but then the husband had to die that husband had to die so we could be married to Christ praise God so let's go to verse 4. wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who's raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God what a privileged church I just thought of it now just what a privilege to be married to a resurrected savior you know as we come upon that Easter is that is that your Revelation I'm married to the one who rose from the dead that's my that's my ruler that's my head that's the one that I answer to that's the one I listen to that's the one I worship that's the one who I obey the resurrected Christ what a thought my goodness gracious married to the Risen one and church don't feel bad he takes he takes all people that that are faulty and have mistakes if he took Peter he'll take you church amen if he took all those disciples when they all ran away from him then he'll surely take you praise God right because we've all ran from God we've all fallen short of the glory of God but what do we always do the spirit always draws us right back into Fellowship praise God so we are married Church the Bible says we're married to the resurrected Christ Hallelujah if we're married then what the Bible says we have to do we have to submit to our husband in all things praise God right obeying the word of God God help us do that church he will and then we bring forth fruit unto God so as we receive our husband's word and our husband's directions you know it works in our lives and we bring forth fruits unto God we could say that be Soul saved we could say uh that would be all the nine fruits of the spirit praise God we bring forth all those fruits unto our husband our husband here directs us in our lives and all of our works glorify God that's why we glorify God with our jobs that's why we glorify God in our families praise God that's bringing forth fruit unto God when people know you're a Christian when people know you're different when people know there's there's something unique about you that's a fruit unto God you brought forth fruit unto God when you see it when you see your life changing you're no longer addicted to what you be used to be addicted to that's fruit unto God hallelujah amen that's fruit unto God but the things I used to do I do them no more praise God it's a great Victory because we're now married to another we're taking orders we're taking direction from Another one not the law of sin and death uh that that husband is dead praise God can you say Amen that your old life is dead praise God that that old life it's dead and gone praise God right the old husband is dead I'm married to a new one and he's he's Alive forevermore praise God this husband will never die praise God oh what a blessing amen the leadership of Jesus Christ will never die in our lives amen this husband will never die praise God he died once and he'll never he takes a death for all of us but he now he ever lives for us praise God Amen now verse 5 now for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead where and we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter Hallelujah all right so we thank God for that praise God I want to uh look at a few more quotes here by God's grace from the sermon and I want to look at specifically at justification again in the context of this sermon here so here in this here's where brother Adam starts a section on you've never done it in the first place brother Brown says you're not only forgiven but you're Justified Glory Justified Romans 5 1 said yeah Romans 5 1 said therefore being justified by faith now that's the verse I'm going to read it since we're already in Romans 6 there 7. we might as well turn one page over to Romans 5. therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I also want to read verse 2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where and we stand and we rejoice in Hope of the glory of God hallelujah so Jesus gives us peace with God and then Jesus gives us access into Grace Hallelujah Church we've accessed God's grace we have we have the ability to to to to access it to to grab it when we need it praise God help me find yourself needing Grace throughout the day praise God we have access into that praise God let's just use the example of you know when you when you would buy food from a machine sometimes you sometimes you have money to buy food let's say you need a let's say you need a big water bottle from the from the uh the vendor right the vending machine hopefully you don't buy pop like we talked about on Sunday don't buy that buy the water that's better for you much better but see you got access to that if you've got the money you have access to that water praise God and that's what it is here that's the same idea you have you have the money you have brother Adam said that's Faith you have the faith if you have the faith to approach God then you've got the payment to get what you have need of praise God it's a blessing praise God we have access into Grace Hallelujah through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen so if you need that tonight whatever you have need up for Access you have it tonight by God's grace whatever the Bible said all spiritual blessings we have access to every spiritual blessing every spiritual gift we have access to it tonight praise God so we don't have to leave out of here depress or discourage or hope less we can leave out of here hopeful praise God that we have access in the grace praise God we don't have to leave out here for a while I'm going to lose my salvation or I'm going to lose this or I'm gonna lose that we're not going to lose anything we're only going to gain praise God Amen because we have access into Grace praise God oh it's a blessing to know that Grace is with us amen now here's where I want to uh I want to I want to just start maybe rightly dividing a little bit you know like I said I've heard different preachers take some of these quotes and then misuse them like they would tell the people they never did in the first place well if they take it the wrong way then why do we need the cross why do we even need Jesus if we never sinned we actually wouldn't need Jesus right because we never did it in the first place but that's the wrong attitude that's used to kind of pump people up and uh and to try to kind of trick them into thinking everything's right with God church now really in in the Eternal perspective everything is right with God we have peace with God right but we know in our in our in our time in time and space when we commit sins or we're going through battles or we have complexes that we saw on Sunday you know we can feel discouraged we know there's consequences to our mistakes right uh and in those moments that's when we need encouragement praise God that's the moments where we need that praise God and so God offers that to us and we know even in those moments we recognize that we're we still fall short of the glory of God in our minds in our flesh the the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak praise God right we understand that and so we can realize you know yes our soul never did it in the first place but then we find ourselves doing things praise God and sometimes we do it in the first place right away in the morning did I say like that you know our soul never did the first place but sometimes we have a bad start to the day praise God and we make a mistake for in the first place in our first interaction in the morning instead of being happy well we're cranky instead of being joyful uh we're complaining right now brother Adam says Look up the word he said the word don't mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven now here's the example he gives for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil things and everything then you come around and say to me you found out I didn't do them then you come and say brother Ram I forgive you he said forgive me I didn't do it at the first place now that's true like if someone condemned you for something and then they find out you never did it they don't have to forgive you because you never did anything wrong but church that's speaking to your soul praise God that's not speaking to your mind or your flesh because sometimes because oftentimes we do give into those areas right and then we have we would have to admit yes I did say that yes I actually did that and it was sinful yes I thought that was planning that yes I actually did that but with the soul your soul never did it in the first place is that right church that's what the Bible said you're the seed of God cannot sin praise God so this is what brother man is saying here he's saying you can't condemn the seed of God that was predestinated to you from the beginning okay now if I did do it I'm guilty but you could forgive me but I wouldn't but you could forgive me but I wouldn't be guilty but I'm not yet Justified because I actually done it okay but the word Justified as though you never done it amen it's not even regarded at all how's it done so here he gives the illustration he uses Romans seven again with the the two husbands right the husband of the law of sin and death and the husband of Christ the resurrected one how's it done though in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorce and dead their old life it's not even the memories of God Amen you're Justified therefore being justified it was accused you was con you was accused you've never done in the first place the old Union is the Sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with like your soul was never married to the law of sin and death right the part of you that was born from God hallelujah see he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you and your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride because that's true the Bible said you're chosen in his mind before the foundation World think of that God chose you to be his bride praise God you know as men the men here we got to choose our bride thank God we did amen I'm glad but we also have to recognize Jesus chose you as his bride amen look at all the billions of people he could have chose from and he chose you Hallelujah amen what a blessing he chose me amen he chose us that ought to encourage us tonight praise God Hallelujah he chose you in his mind by predestination praise God before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are a predestinated seed hallelujah amen now um now personally when now when here's where I'm getting into a little bit of rightly dividing going back to the scripture now personally I I can't find that justified means we never sin the first place because if you look at the actual Greek definition it doesn't say that okay so I want to take tonight I want to look at verses about justification and context like we know what Brother Ray I'm saying brother I'm saying the soul never did in the first place in other words God's spirit cannot sin God's spirit never did Sin praise God right the part of God where he thought about sister who and he sent the holy ghost that part that this is going to be a sister who is eternal spirit that part never sinned right so let's examine these verses about justification to kind of uh get the right understanding here by the grace of God and it seems brother Brandon was emphasizing the soul that cannot sin the soul never sinned and cannot sin praise God now here's the word justify here's what it means so here just so everybody can see it it means you're free it means you're righteous it renders righteous or such as he ought to be it means to show exhibit events one to be righteous such as he is and wishes himself to be considered to declare pronounce one to be just righteous such as he ought to be so it's a declaration that a person is just it's a declaration that someone is righteous praise God all right as he would like to be as he wishes to be praise God now all have sinned and fallen short of God's glory right the Bible says that Romans 3 23 we memorize that when we were little children hopefully and if not we got to start memorize that children and boy am I behind on Bible memorization I'll just say right here so forgive me children uh number of weeks behind on that now I just thought you know here's what you can do with the nice thing about technology you can click that word Justified and it occurs 36 times in the New Testament okay I know it's hard to read but um so it's twice in Matthew five times in Luke once in Acts 14 times the Romans twice in First Corinthians six times in Galatians you get the idea so you can see how does how do Bible writers use this word Justified okay because the Bible says you're Justified you have peace with God you're righteous as you ought to be you're righteous as you wish to be amen oh amen hallelujah praise God how many wish that God forgives all your sins tonight you got it Hallelujah you got it amen that's if you're Justified you got it don't got to worry about it because that's what justification is you're righteous as you want to be praise God I don't want to go to heaven with sins I want to go to heaven forgiven praise God well I got that if I'm Justified amen I've got a full pardon amen I got full forgiveness I have not my righteousness I've got the righteousness of Christ amen is that that's what the Bible says II Corinthians 5 21. he became sin that we might be made his righteousness so I've got to praise God amen thank God Hallelujah my soul's got it Hallelujah now I want to just read this one because this one in this text you know we don't think of the public in leaving saying well I never did it in the first place so let's look at this context remember the Pharisee comes he says thank God I never I never committed sins like this public and I'm so holy thank God I'm such a wonderful message believer they got them I'm better than everybody else that's a real prideful sinner thank God I'm not like him thank God I'm not going to hell like that person instead he should have had compassion on this person but said he went to he went to church just to exalt himself above everybody else now I know nobody does that here by God's grace right right that's why I'm believing right I'm believing with you we don't come here to compare one another to one another we come here to compare ourselves to Christ and we compare ourselves to Christ we're unworthy but we have to recognize he did give us the Divine Exchange he traded my sorrows for his Joys praise God I traded all my ashes for his Beauty praise God right that's that's the whole Isaiah 61. I've traded all this I've exchanged this he's given me the Divine exchange but the Publican he's looked down upon at church everybody's looking down at him and they won't even stand close enough picture that church now everybody here has somebody kind of close to them but picture the Publican he'd be all off all by himself she'll be like if everybody was up in the front row and Republican was in the back corner back there all by himself at church right but here we got all people that when love us Shake our hands say we love you God bless you he's all by himself and he was so humble he wouldn't even look up to heaven but he hid himself when was the last time you hit yourself so ashamed of your sin he smoked himself he said God he hit himself he says he had to hit something he was so ashamed of himself he actually hid himself he said God be merciful to me a sinner I've had times like that I've had times where I've even as a believer I've said God be merciful to me I need your grace and I've cried I've laid here around the floor and cried and said God be merciful to me I need God's forgiveness many times that was his prayer and Jesus says I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other now do you think he went down saying I never did those sins and all right God don't have to be merciful to me because I never did in the first place is that how he went down his home no he went down just rejoicing I know God forgave me I know God put my sins instead of in front of his face God put my sins behind him he said he went down to his house Justified rather than the other and everyone that exalts himself shall be amazed he that humeth himself shall be exalted so let's come to church like that let's come to church and have compassion on people well I wonder uh brother looks sad I wonder if I could encourage him tonight not like well no wonder he looks sad because he didn't listen to me last week whatever whatever no wonder she looks at it she said that to me last week you know whatever we ought to come to church and have compassion on one another praise God and let's not stand afar off from others let's shake hands with one now let's let's encourage one another by God's grace see he says I'm a sinner but the Bible Jesus says he leaves Justified so see that's why in that context I think brother man was referring to the soul the soul never in the first place right the soul never did it but as a sinner as sinner Say by Grace we leave the house of God saying thank you God for having mercy on me we realize we're still Sinners right in one way not in the soul now not in the soul but in our spirits and our flesh okay so that's a way that's the scripture that uses Justified that we've got to take into account it's the same Greek word we're justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ how do you get peace he confesses sins he asked for God's mercy that's how many want peace tonight with God that's all you got to do say God have mercy on me have mercy forgive my sins oh it's a beautiful beautiful story The Gospel for all of sin and come short of the glory of God being justified freely you didn't have to pay anything for it you just had to confess your sins and believe it freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood how many trusting in the blood tonight to declare Jesus righteousness for the remission of your sins that are passed through the forbearance of God Amen oh it's beautiful praise God thank God for the blood of Christ our faith is in the blood tonight amen but to him that worketh not that's us but believeth on him that justifies the ungodly remember we never in the first place that's just your soul right but God Jesus came to justify the ungodly those who sin in their minds and those who sin in their bodies that's who Jesus came to justify praise God so Paul this is the gospel Paul is giving us the gospel and Romans remember 14 times Paul uses the word justified in Romans 14 times Paul said God has declared you righteous as you want to be praise God oh God 14 times amen you were ungodly you were married to the husband of the law of sin and death but your husband died now you're married to Christ praise God uh you don't all your past is Forgiven all your passes behind you and boy do you have a bright future praise God Amen what a future you got praise God and what an awful future the devil has praise God but as the devil's chained up for a thousand years falling uh in as the Bible says in the bottomless pit while he's falling for a thousand years we're walking around the earth and we're reigning on the earth for a thousand years amen we're Vanishing and then appearing and we're building and we're planting we're doing all these things for a thousand years while he's fallen for a thousand years we're ruling and reigning with Christ for a thousand years amen what a trade amen thank God we're Justified thank God Christ justifies the ungodly praise God oh what a blessing it gives to us praise God and yet that devil at one time was deceiving us but we overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony praise God Amen and David describes the blessedness of this bride the bride of Christ unto whom God imputeth righteousness without your Works God makes you righteous before you did anything you just believed you just repented and God imputes righteousness to you saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered trust you're feeling blessed tonight by God's grace the greatest blessing you have tonight is not 20 million dollars right the greatest blessing you're going to have is that your iniquities are forgiven and your sins are covered is that right hey man look at that and he justifies the ungodly we were ungodly but he declares us righteous as we wish to be praise God oh my God hallelujah praise God oh my God but God proved his love command his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so see we did Sin right we did Sin in the first place our minds and our flesh but the soul never did Sin in the first place much more than being now justified by his blood we should be saved from wrath through him Church aren't you glad you're not going to be a part of the Great Tribulation period aren't you glad that the bombs that that Russia has with the names of America on it aren't you glad your name's not on that bomb praise God or however it's going to work out however how are the instructions going to work out aren't you glad your name is is not on the Martyr role of the Roman Catholic Church because you're not going to be here when the Mark is laid down we're not going to be here we're taking the Exodus because we're already Justified amen Justified freely by his blood praise God I'm already declared righteous by the blood because I've got faith in the blood praise God amen so because you're justified by the blood you're saved from Wrath you're not going to experience the wrath of God you're saved from Wrath oh my Hallelujah think about that church think about program said I said thousands of times a year think about thousands and thousands like that illustration I gave at Napoleon did I preach you here about the the sand maybe I just say it okay I was thinking you know the Bible says the love of God will cover a multitude of sin and I was praying there right before I went to Kansas I said Lord can you just give me some simple illustration because I can explain this to the people like I want to know for me too don't leave me out Lord I want to know too like how can you cover a multitude of my sin so I'll just sitting there thinking you know it's probably right there maybe at my desk I can't remember and all of a sudden my mind went to the ocean and sand I thought yeah when you go to the shore and you play around with the sand how much sand can you get how many grains can you get in one handful well corn decides you can get 10 000. grains of sand when you're at the beach how many like the beach ten thousand roll around says I sin thousands of times a year so if he sins if we sin 2 000 times a year then there's five years of sin that are represented with a handful of sand right now Church the devil wants us to look at that sand and he wants to make us guilty look at all those mistakes you made look at all that and then you drop it and you still got sand all over your hand you try to let go of your past right there's they're still sin doesn't seem like the next few years oh look at the Devil brings it up and said look remember you did that remember that devil I remember that right and so the devil tries and what it seems like we have a multitude of sin but church just give the earth a little bit of time I'll say like this just give God a little bit of time because that moon is rotating out there praise God and pretty soon the Earth the moon are moving together pretty soon the Earth the moon's going to get closer to the Earth right and it's going to move the waters in and let's say the devil he likes to take all your sins and he likes to build up all your sins like a dirty old sand castle right the devil says look look I build this up now talk about complexes here we are the devil builds up a complex well you did this and how could God ever love you and the devil's like see Jesse look at all your sins and pretty soon God's clock starts working Hallelujah I've seen it a couple times out there in South America amen give it a couple hours all these sand castles are on there it's a multitude of sin but Church give it the right time and season and the waves slowly come in deep calls unto deep praise God the water get closer and closer and pretty soon the waters come in and the waters wash over all the devil's sand castles and the church said look how easily God can put away your sins God can cover all your sins like the waters cover the Sands amen Hallelujah I don't care how big the sand castle The Devil Makes God's Mercy is more amen so praise the Lord God's Mercy is more Hallelujah amens that's how I explained to the Saints they they like that one over at Napoleon the devil brings up your last five years just show them hey the waters are coming in the love of God's going to come in and it's going to cover a multitude of my sins and God does it quite easily Hallelujah so that really encourage me that's how God that's how easily now that's just the waters think about the whole universe think how easily God can cover over our sins that's just on Earth praise God think about all the vast power God has think how he can easily cleanse us from all sin praise God amen like Waters cover the like Waters cover the sea praise God Waters cover the sands amen no you're not church at the unrighteous Center on the Heritage within the Bible just say you're righteous Obama just said you're righteous so you're going to inherit the earth be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate that's the child molesters nor abusers themselves with mankind that's homosexuals nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God did you see that school shooting this week that was a trans person and they're purposely attacking a Christian School going after Christians on purpose because they hate Christians Church you just got to be ready any hour none of us are guaranteed anything we've got to trust in the blood of Jesus Christ the girls were telling me on Saturday Eden was telling me I think it was eating or virtue said my daddy or my parents always say angels are always watching over me or something like that the angels and cap around those that fear the Lord praise God that's what the girls are might have been nature that's a good one I like that that's pretty praise God and I just read that in the scripture in Psalms where the Bible says the angel will not let you dash your foot against the stone praise God it'll keep you in all your ways let's trust God but at the same time you know God may have a testimony like I was texting a guy or emailed a guy this this week from Uganda and he said they have no food I said brother I said that's why I got a waiting list you got to wait till the funds come in so I could help you out and I said let me give you a satisfying scripture and I shared that scripture from Romans 8. even famine cannot separate us from the love of God and he said thank you that really encouraged me now see George because we're all going through different things we're not going through famine over here right we're going through we'd say just uh Temptation we're going through manifold Temptations of the Mind but still even these mind battles can't separate us from the love of God Amen neither can their lack of mine battles and just lack in food separate them from the love of God now he did have a mind battle he's like God God don't even care about us I said I said no sir God does care about you I said but God has to have a Victors who overcome family just like God have to ask Victors who overcome riches or uh surfeiting like the Bible says drunkenness and overeating and the days of Noah God has got to have somebody who can overcome The Temptations of the days of Noah that's right so none of these will inherit the kingdom of God and look such were some of you in other words we were some of us were married to those husbands before but instead we're not married to them anymore now that husband's dead now you're washed now you're Sanctified now you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God the church said there's some pretty powerful words in there church wash Sanctified justified in the name of Jesus praise God powerful words this is what separates us from our former life this is what separates us from our past this is what separates us from all of those grains of sins that we had all those all those Witnesses against us this is what separates us Jesus separates us praise God Jesus does amen he washes us he sanctifies us he justifies us amen he declares us righteous as we hope to be praise God oh it's beautiful here's the word sanctifying us I always forget brother Branham always says that he says sanctify means cleaned out and set aside for service right that's a good definition this means separated from Pro profane things and dedicated to God so brother Ram's layman's terms are really good it's an easy way separated and dedicated unto God okay so when God sanctifies you he separates you from your uh from your habits right man that's what around labor is on in the future home sermon three works of Grace he saves you and then he sanctifies you he changed your old habits gets rid of all your old habits and then he fills you with the Holy Ghost praise God but he's got to separate you first he's got to purify your cup first all right think about that church how many church members do you know that still enjoy profane things cussing and swearing and dirty shows and Super Bowl parties and Super Bowl halftime shows and wickedness like that have they separated themselves from profane things no they haven't but thank God God called you to a higher walk praise God thank God church that you're called to hire things than that that you're pressing towards the mark of the high calling in God some people look at it as a burden well I've got to live such a high life we should look at it as a blessing I'm glad I don't have to live a low life amen I'm glad I'm called to the high life amen amen the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus a lot of churches most churches don't even separate from profane things they enjoy filthy things and simple things but God has called us to something greater praise God he's taught us to be sanctified amen now here's the last use of the Greek word I didn't go through all 36 Justified I try to pull out the ones I thought might help us the most this is the last Justified to also can mean the word righteous now this is speaking of the Rapture at the time of the Rapture the Gentile bride whatever you are that's what you say right because God leaves the Gentiles he goes to the Jews so he that's unjustice unjust still he that's filthy filthy still he that's righteous let him be righteous so he that's holy unto me holy still that's a good that's actually a good verse there for the foolish virgin they are Justified they're declared righteous but they're not fully sanctified right they're not fully sanctified the member Church in heaven will always remember being saved from our sins in order to magnify Christ I use these scriptures last year we preached on doctrine of devils series to show that for all eternity we're not going to be saying thank god sister who you never did in the first place thank God Malachi never sinned in the first we're not going to be going along like that we're going to be thanking Jesus for salvation oh man praise God Amen we're going to spend our time remembering what Jesus did to forgive our sins praise God we're not going to rock around like oh yeah you never did it yeah David you never did that in the first place Moses you never did that in the first place we're actually not going to be talking like that we're going to be worshiping God because of his salvation how many believe that by God's grace let me prove it to if you eat a refresher you might I needed one I always need a refresher praise God and when Jesus had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song Imagine a new song in heaven Hallelujah and the new song is Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof now I believe this already happened I believe that already happened in heaven some people don't some people believe it's after the Rapture I believe it already happened I believe it happened around 1963. that's what I believe for that was slain and has redeemed us so these worshipers remember when Jesus was crucified nearly 2 000 years ago oh Church the blood will never lose its power amen the cross will never lose its appeal to us amen the cross will never get old the cross will always be an emblem of Victory praise God it'd always be new it'd always be fresh it'll always be fresh in our minds that this is what made us uh get here this paved the way that we could get here we couldn't get here without the cross amen amen Eddie now these Four and Twenty Elders of the 12 sons of Jacob The Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ Peter's in there they're all saying he was slain and he redeemed us they're still focusing on the cross we'll be singing about the cross with new songs amen I don't know how you can get new songs after two thousand years but we're gonna get new songs praise God new songs about the cross oh like the Bible said that the song says the half has not been told is that right Church we still got new songs in heaven about the cross I'm convinced Church there's a lot I still don't yet see yes the mysteries of God are finished but let me say this there's a whole lot more that I don't see all the Bible defined Mysteries if the Bible calls a mystery that's finished but there's a lot more for me to understand remember for for ages God's going to be showing us his kindness or last Wednesday or last Sunday for ages to come God's going to show how he was kind to our lives then how he was kind of course to all the seven Church ages I'm going to show how kind he was now think of that he could have been harsh with us but God was kind to us may God give us a fresh appreciation for that tonight that God's going to show me how kind he was in my life she was so faithful he was so loving he was always right on time he's not going to show us how he wasn't fair God wasn't fair God's not going to be showing us that he's going to be showing us his kindness God is writing a story God is the author and finisher of our Lives praise God that's right how do you redeem us Church buy his blood out of every kindred out of every tongue people and Nation now think about that most Amish haven't even heard the message yet there's over 350 000 Amish and most of them have never had a chance that's just in America we got Canadian Amish we got Mexican Amish I was praying that today before service Lord give me Grace give us Grace to reach the Amish so they can hear the word of God because let's just say like that we're not going home until they hear it that's as far as I can see right Jesus has Terry for 2 000 years he's tarried for 2 000 years so may God send us may God help us may God send his word to these people that have never heard the word like we've heard the word praise God and he's made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth he makes us King and Priests there because of how we act right here we've got to rule over sin now we've got to intercede now in prayer in fact one of the last chapter of Colossians says continue in prayer with Thanksgiving in other words don't stop praying keep praying don't stop praying that's what makes you a priest unto God don't stop ruling over addictions keep ruling over addictions keep all addictions under your feet church and the church said keep ruling over that proves you're worthy to reign in the millennium if you can get the victory right now how many are grateful Jesus gave you the victory praise God you just keep the victory by quoting the word I believe in the word love and Jesus amen Hallelujah crucifying the flesh right mortifying the uh the Deeds of the flesh the Bible says redeemed and remember there's that same word I preached it last time I was preached out Hosea when I preach this little topic here as though we never did in the first place Peter is saying I'm redeemed Peter's saying I was in the marketplace but I was brought out Peter John Hallelujah Matthew Luke of course Luke wasn't one of the 12 but he was a saint they're all saying we were all in the marketplace we were all sold as slaves and sin but Jesus Paid the price and he bought us out of there praise God amen my Hallelujah this is my story this is my song praising My Savior all the days off because I was in the marketplace and Jesus Paid the price and now I'm out praise God ah what a song to say Hallelujah once was lost but now I'm found I once was in the marketplace but now I'm purchased praise God I once was for sale but now I'm purchased praise God Hallelujah this is what they're saying this they're singing this in heaven to Jesus you redeemed Us by your blood you brought us out of the market you've saved us from a life of bondage amen later on in the same chapter and be held I heard the voice of many angels right about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands of thousands that's quite a choir there that's quite an Angelic choir and what are they all saying praise God we never sin in the first place is that what they're saying no now it's true part of them never did especially the Angels they never said in the first place but they're joining they're joining the the song of these redeemed they're saying Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing so all of Heaven calls Jesus worthy praise God all of Heaven even if they never send the first place those angels they're still saying he's where the appraised Jesus has done something the angels have never done praise God Amen Hallelujah Jesus has done so much he's worthy of all the praise praise God now fast forward to chapter seven now I believe this is the bride there are six quotes from Brother brand that says from Revelation 7 9 to verse 17 is the bride there's one quote that says they're foolish virgin I got a whole video on it if you want to like it or you want to watch it not like it you can like it if you want I hope you don't unlike it if not let's talk some scripture after service but the point was all the clues say it's the Bride of Jesus Christ because she's already washed in the blood ah and that's the thing about the foolish versions they're not fully washed in the blood they're not fully Sanctified they're not fully set apart for God's service they're lacking oil too now they're a virgin as far as they don't have any interaction with with devils and idolatry they don't have any Idols in their lives but they're lacking oil and they didn't take time to prepare the oil But Here We Are Tonight taking time to prepare oil praise God how many Christians are not in church tonight how many moms stayed at home because they worked today sister Naomi yeah you came to church is that right think about all the church members that are most most Christians don't even go to church on Wednesday night anymore the only group I know that does is the Kiwanis how do you say that Kiwanis Kiwanis there's a grouping copy they're called the Kiwanis they go on Wednesday night but it's just real short there's I think my mom I don't know if my mom Church does anymore Pentecost I don't know if they do Wednesday nights anymore I don't know but here we are why are we here tonight because we're preparing for the coming bridegroom I'm here making sure I'm ready so when I hear the voice behold the bridegroom cometh I leave this world and I go up to meet Jesus in the air because there's going to be a meeting in the air praise God I'm making ready tonight praise God Hallelujah could all be at home getting rest we could all be at home uh have an ice cream sandwich I did have one on Sunday night by the way but I haven't had one since Sunday night because I don't want to become a bad habit like my wife was telling me that's true I don't want to compromise I don't want to be a bad habit too much so I got to stay off it for a while now a while by God's grace but here we see this picture of the Bride it's a great multitude which no man can number of all Nations kindreds people tongues stood Before the Throne before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in their hands think about that sure some of us are going to be holding Palms in our hands in heaven I maybe won't maybe I won't have a harp like you melka you probably have a heart because you know you do that now can I be over there on the harp worshiping god with brother amen and Austin I'll just be in the Palm group oh yeah I like to wave my hands anyway Hallelujah and they're going to be shouting with not Whispers in heaven but loud voices ah hallelujah we're not gonna be whispering like well Jesus he's a pretty good savior he's all right no we're gonna be shouting salvation to our god which sits on the throne and unto the lamb praise God we're gonna be shouting to God and shouting to the lamb where we wave in branches praise God we're in a perfect white garments on praise God we're going to be worshiping God for his salvation hallelujah what does that salvation mean there's uh three definitions there it means you're delivered preserved you got safety you're delivered from the molestation of enemies no more devil praise God you have experienced Messianic salvation Christ salvation Messiah means Christ you have and you you you're saying salvation in other words you have the sum of the benefits and blessings which the Christians redeemed from all Earthly ills and joy you're saying salvation I have all the benefits I'm delivered and I have every benefit of a real born-again Christian praise God and lastly I you're saying I'm saved from the penalty and power and presence and pleasure of sin praise God hallelujah I'm saved from all the effects of sin and I've got all the benefits of being forgiven praise God see we're still we're not going to be shouting thank God I never did in the first place we'll be seeing thank God I did it but he forgave me praise God hallelujah where's brother Diggs when you need him amen he's coming in May by God's grace that's what we're gonna be now thank God our souls never did thank God but we're singing and praising God for delivering us from the wrongs that we did do praise God right maybe there will come a time when we'll never remember that anymore but I doubt it people can speculate all they want but I imagine we'll be singing about the cross I imagine we'll be getting new songs all the time sister oh here's another song about the wonders of the cross let me sing the version I wrote praise God well actually God wrote he said I couldn't I couldn't do anything without him right all inspiration has to come from God they're still singing about the cross two thousand years later and the angel says sir who are these and and John said thou knows Angel and he said these are they which came out of the Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the lamb so see the foolish version they're not fully washed that's why they got to go through the tribulation not fully washed and these are not Jews Jews are earlier in the chapter verses one to eight hundred forty four thousand see what the Holy Ghost what does wash mean Saints it means you got new clothes you have appropriated the results of Christ's Redemption as regarded by God and your pure and sinless your wash and God sees you as pure and sinless Hallelujah the voice says these are all these Gentiles that are pure and sinless by the work of Christ's sacrifice oh my hallelujah praise God I'm not going to go over that time I'm gonna try to finish up here I never set a timer so I'm not sure where we're at on time where I'm at occasion how much time hour really oh so that clock's broke God I've only been preaching 30 minutes brother makes it clear that and the Bible makes it clear Grace will never fail us as long as we never fail Grace in other words as long as we never Retreat From Grace and stomp it under our foot and walk away Grace is always going to be for us we're always going to have it the only way to lose Grace is to trample underfoot and run away from it walk away from it that's the only way we can use it or lose it praise God to church if you're planning on being in the house of God the rest of your life you're going to be under grace you're going to have a washed white robe you're gonna have the righteousness of Christ throughout all eternity oh my amen I don't have any plans on going anywhere I want to just draw closer to Jesus all the time Hallelujah right that's what the Bible says the Bible said follow peace with all men see try to have peace in your relationships and your family and your workers co-workers and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord there's that sanctification you got to be separate from the things of the world looking diligently so look diligently this that you have peace with people and you're living a holy life lest any man will fail the grace of God see lest any root of bitterness that's why the Bible says husbands don't be bitter against your wives remember God says in Malachi that God is the witness between husbands and wives let's read it right now since I'm on it here I've only preached an hour I could probably preach a whole another hour if I you know everybody says amen can I have a little more time Church Maybe maybe brother Malachi chapter I think it's two yeah chapter two yeah verse 14. Malachi 2 14. not Church remember that the Holy Ghost is watching in your house how you treat your husband and wife how you treat your children the Holy Ghost is watching and he's another witness for you or witness against you a church we all how many believe you're saved here let's live a life let's make sure we continue living a life where the Holy Ghost is for us he's going to be a witness for us that we showed Grace and love that our sisters as we said submitted to our husbands in the Lord and that our husbands loved our wives and we were not bitter against them Hallelujah because God's watching God's watching verse 14. yet you say wherefore because the Lord had been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant here's you know why you know why a man would treat his wife like that because he's got an evil spirit on him that's this or same thing if we mistreat our husbands got an evil spirit we've got to confess it if we do it same things Brothers we just got to confess our evil spirits verse 15 and did not he make one see husband wife one Spirit one flesh yet he had the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a Godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth yeah let's read verse 16 for the Lord the god of Israel said that he hateth putting away for one covereth violence With His Garment saith the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously so in other words church just try to be fair with your husband or wife try to be fair because God's watching God's watching you're going to reap what you sow if you sow Mercy you're going to reap Mercy that's what I want to be known for as a brother of Mercy you know why because God's showed me a lot of Mercy I know the kind of life I live in the good but I also know the bad I do and I'm trusting in the same scriptures I read tonight I'm trusting in those same scriptures for me that I'm Justified that Jesus sisters are actually declares me righteous as I want to be and you don't hold my sins against me amen hallelujah because I could have a whole handful of all the years I've been alive now serving God to over the serving God 23 years now I get a lot of handfuls of sins in there but the but the love of God covers a multitude of my sin and now I'm Justified as I'd like to be I want the love of God like a flood to cover over all my sins so you don't even see my sin anymore all you see is God's love hallelujah praise God this I want God to see the waters amen I just want the waters to be seen not all my sins not the sand of my sins now here's the kind of people that fall away like a fornicator someone who won't get married right okay or an adulterer we say the same thing or any profane person like Esau remember Esau said I'm not going to marry a believer I'm going to purposely go against my mom and dad that's what that was his attitude who for one more Soul a meat sold his Birthright now like that's people that leave the the Bible leave the message leave Christ they sell out Christ for whatever that's the kind of people that fail the grace of God they leave Christ they leave the word of God for some worldly pleasures sometimes it's not even for pleasure sometimes it's just for bitterness they're just upset with the pastor Pastor the deacons are the upset with the song leader why don't they come and talk about it by God's grace instead of letting bitterness grow up like a root inside of them see we ought to let the Holy Ghost grow up inside of us and not the root of bitterness let God's spirit grow let God's spirit become more powerful feed God's spirit don't feed bitterness feed the Holy Spirit praise God but this is what this is what the laws do they feed evil spirits instead of feeding the spirit of God there you go but you're here tonight to feed on God's word I got to give it to warning because there are some people that listen praise God and I want everybody to you know I want everybody to always have a warning church we all need warnings because we're all we all find ourselves in different spot spots right sometimes we're right in the midst of the Temptation sometimes we just come out and we're feeling all good sometimes we're coming right up to the door of a temptation oh I feel something coming on I feel this is going through difficult times difficult times on the way so we got to give warnings Church remember Jesus said remember Lot's wife right he didn't say remember Abraham did he I heard a preachers out there that's pretty good thought he said remember Lot's wife the one who almost made it out in other words remember Judas is scared he almost made it out see from time to time we need warnings from time to time we need remembrances don't fall back don't let bitterness go up in your heart don't deal treacherously with your husband or your wife don't do that remember you serve a god of Grace and you have access into that Grace amen Hallelujah you know I had these thoughts months ago and I I just didn't preach him I was looking through my sermon thoughts say what should I preach today what would the Lord have me Preach Today and I found these thoughts I'm like I like to bring these out today Abraham failed in Egypt remember he lied about Sarah and he let Pharaoh take his wife then in uh in the Philistine Camp he let abimelech take Sarah twice he lied about Sarah and both times God made Abraham look good Pharaoh had to repent to Abraham and abimelech had to repent to Abraham and it was Abraham's fault Church now how could that be it's only because God was looking at the whole testimony of Abraham's life overall Abraham was living better lives than them because the Bible said Abraham was faithful in all of his house but in Abraham's couple moments of weakness he failed but yet God still showed him favor because he was the real believer praise God he was the more dedicated believer over the whole span of his life he's a higher quality believer over the whole span of his life so God gave him favor even when he sinned praise God ah Church God's Gonna favor you and I even in our sins Hallelujah that's right in other words God won't give us what we deserve Hallelujah did Abraham get what he deserved no for lying about his wife and brother called him a coward and all these things he didn't get what he deserved he got Grace thank God Amen God wants to give you Grace tonight Church Peter look at Peter he had all those mistakes what'd Jesus do Jesus come right to him and said Do You Love Me Peter he said I'm not getting rid of you Peter he said do you love me keep preaching feed my sheep right well Jesse makes mistakes and I say Lord forgive me and Jesus would say keep reaching son keep preaching keep preaching the word of God even in Abraham's mistakes God made him the victor because he's more than a conqueror amen hallelujah praise God who shall lay any charge to God's elect oh my Hallelujah I thought I thought you liked that one by God's grace yeah Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are passions this case is not sexual passions or anything like that it's just suffering it's the passion of suffering and the the children heard A good sermon on Elijah right on Sunday night that's a good message he suffered right he had to be all by himself out there in the wilderness a number of times he he had death threats on his life and I like the illustration he gave it's like Elijah went into prayer request and he said look he said I'm going to turn my prayer prayer request in tonight and the prayer request says Lord can you let me die now I don't think any of you would ever put a prayer request in for that uh brother Jesse yeah please pray that I'll die Oh you mean die to sin yeah and be born again okay yeah right but Elijah was so discouraged he was suffering so much he put a prayer request and said father can I go home not a funeral for me not church that's pretty low I've never been that low I think that's only by God's grace I'm not I'm not bragging like I always say they're way more man than I am I just have more access to the Holy Ghost they didn't have it but they're more than a man than me but this is the suffering and look even though I had all these passions look he just prayed earnestly Church let's keep praying earnestly let's pray earnestly for our hearts desires let's not give up on God we've all got suffering we're all going to go through trials but God's going to give us favor in the end praise God because we are faithful we're the faithful ones praise God most church members aren't in church tonight they're not praying they're not reading their Bibles they're not worshiping but we are because we're the elect praise God we're the elect we're the wise virgins we're not foolish we know it's coming we know the destruction is coming but we also know the good thing the Raptors come and praise God Amen Hallelujah I'll be really watching the prayer requests the next few services I'm gonna have to talk to some of us about it let's have hope praise God I don't do any funerals anytime soon I mean you just want to die to yourself okay I'll pray the prayer that you can mortify your your lusts and your Deeds what kind of man was Abraham normally God said I know this is the kind of man Abraham is I'll not hide anything from him because he's become a great man a mighty nation I know Abraham's character He commands his children and his household to keep the way of God Amen he stumbles along the way praise God and even in his stumbles God God made them repent to him praise God Glory and Abraham was a man normally he was of justice and judgment he wasn't in those two cases with pharaoh and abiblic but in most cases he was a man of justice and judgment job spoke against God he gave himself more righteousness now talk about a talk about a legalists here I think maybe job was on that side there he was more the legalist type he thought he was more righteous than God has anybody ever thought that here don't raise your hand over you thought you're more holy and your plans are better than God's now nobody would ever think that here right nobody nobody would say well Lord you know I think I should have it would have worked better if it would have went like this no nobody would say that here right of course not nobody would say that we can all rejoice in our sufferings but look Church even after that God honored him and the three friends had to repent and pray for him and go to him for prayer job had to pray for them I think that was because really because Eli Eli who rebuked job I think job got rebuked at the end I don't think job sinned against the three friends they must have been attacking him if they had to repent to job they must have been an attacking joke but job did get reviewed by ilahu and also by God so he got in other words job had said I repent and dust and Ashes he had repented right and remember job was more righteous in other words job was just like Abraham the on the whole of his life the majority of his life he was way more faithful than those three guys the Bible said everybody wanted to come here the wisdom of job they come down and sit and say preach a preacher well I really like to hear that let me take some good notes I got questions and answers for you they just did not they didn't they didn't just didn't see wisdom like jobs but then he got in a spot where he only had fear he was self-righteous even in his trials God honored job church God will honor you even in your trials how do you believe that how many have seen that I've seen it in my life God honored me even when I've fallen short of God's glory he still honors this church because we're his children he sees the Integrity of our hearts amen so you've honored his word church you've honored his word I'm almost done here let me see am I almost done yeah how many believe nobody's question the anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man that's born to be a Son of God With The predestinated Germ into him for this hour he'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in in other words if you are a predestinated child of God when you hear the message you'll say Amen to it right when you heard serpent seed you said amen you shared separency with amen amen said amen Hallelujah he went home he said I need to say that out he said amen to the word of God because you're a predestinated seed of God Martin Luther sought for his day John Wesley saw for his the Pentecostal saw it for theirs what about you see they all went to domination after the the founder died right but here's the word condemning denomination tell you what we're have to today and just exactly Malachi 4 and all these other promises for the hour what do you see what are you looking at amen here we are the real genuine Eagles were here my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not follow Church we're not following denominations we're not following strangers tonight we're following Jesus Christ who is the word of God praise God but ye believe not Jesus being the Pharisees you believe me not because you're not of my sheep as I've said unto you my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me how many following Christ tonight praise God you've heard the voice of God you're following the word of God and I give unto them eternal life praise God I give them to them the seed that never sinned in the first place Hallelujah that's what Jesus gives amen all his predestinated children the seed that never sinned in the first place because the soul that the anointing of their soul never did Sin praise God and they shall never perish why because their life never never had a beginning never had an ending the eternal life you either shot any man pluck them out of my hand no one's going to be able to separate me from the love of Christ there's no one brother Austin that can talk me out of this message because nobody talked me into it Jesus drew me into it like a sheep I heard the voice of my shepherd I came running that that's my shepherd that's the one who's going to take care of me Hallelujah I came into the Sheep board this is this is this is for me that's so true I wanted it for those years I would say for almost two years I wondered from I run to that church that church when I heard this message I knew this was right I just knew it was one night I struggled with it you know but I got right back on the next morning when Craig called me that's part of my testimony just one night I struggled with it everything every other night I'm in it by God's grace and my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand Church look how secure you are the devil can't rip you out of God's hand right you can't rip you out there's no man there's no family member nobody can rip you out of the hand of God you're in the hand of Christ you're in the hand of Heaven's King Hallelujah Hallelujah you're you're in the hand of the one the Angels Sing About praise God you're in the hand of the one where millions of angels and the four beasts and the 24 Elders they all worship and sing and say Worthy is the Lamb you're in the Lamb's hand praise God Hallelujah and what's the proof of that you heard the word and you believed it Glory why it was put in there by predestination you were ordained to a Son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world you're only manifested in this day for his glory and honor a church how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God see the fact you stand with this message it shows you're a child of God right you can't honor Christ and then dishonor his word that's why there's so many foolish versions that's why there's so many lost they won't even honor the word of God but what's different about you you honor the word because you've been washed by the word because you were chosen by the word because you have a portion of the word in your soul praise God let's stand up our feet yes sir which you're a part of that word see you're not you're not the full word musician's Gonna Come you're not the forward only Jesus is the full word you're a part of the word because look the word God is the word you believe that and and the congregation says Glory well then if he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the Word was God then you were in God the word the part that you're to play now here's where we get a little trouble we want to tell God what part we want to play or we think we know what part we're supposed to play God knows what part we're supposed to play if we've heard this word we honor it we believe it we act upon it but we've got to accept God's part for us to play Abraham's part included a few missteps there right he missed that by lying not once about his wife twice about it right job had a misstep there he got fearful and then he got prideful self-righteous Church none of us want the none of us will really want the part of job don't raise your hand but who wants the part of job who wants to lose all their money and all their family I don't want that but he had to be willing to play that part a church if he can play that part how many can say Lord I'll play my part that you have planned for me that's the one you should raise your hand for praise God whatever part God has for you we got to be willing to play it tonight by God's grace amen see the part you was was in God before the foundation world he seen you he knew you he predestinated you to it how many know that God saw you praise God how many believe God knows you amen praise God let's bow our heads up I'll stop right there I had old I was going to go a little bit further with that but I'll stop right there I might say that for the Amish people I wonder I want to make a list of all the differences between our church and denominations I imagine I think I was up to 36 at one point but I'm the ram said there's hundreds so there's probably hundreds think of all the differences between and our church says about our heads here and how many thankful that you're Justified tonight if you have faith in the
