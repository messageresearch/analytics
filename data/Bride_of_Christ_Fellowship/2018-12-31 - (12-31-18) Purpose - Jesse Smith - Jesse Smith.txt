goddamn is right just [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's take our Bibles here let's go to second Timothy chapter 1 well I think I'm done with there thus saith the Lord sermon so I just want to take a few sermons on purpose I want to preach on purpose tonight by the grace of the Lord 2nd Timothy chapter 1 I'll try not to be too lengthy tonight by the grace of Lord oh I want to be aware of the time we have communion and anyone liked to give a testimony we should like to hear testimonies after I just have a I've one to share and then Jose asked him if he'd share one from yesterday the Lord was moving yesterday by God's grace amen thank the Lord for that second Timothy chapter 1 verse 8 want the Lord to move tonight with us praise the Lord Amen hallelujah he's so gracious 2nd Timothy 1 verse 8 I'll read verse 8 we'll all read verse 9 then I'll read verse 10 verse a I'll just read this be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner so that's why we're not ashamed of brother Branham but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God let's read verse 9 together one two three who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began I'll read verse 10 but it's now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer I'm gonna have a need on their heart tonight just make it known unto God as we pray Heavenly Father we just come reverently before you Lord God we thank you for the testimony of your servant st. Paul the great prophet or the greatest missionary Lord outside of Jesus Christ we thank you for the testimony of st. Paul and father Lord where we see Lord how we have a holy calling Lord God and Lord there's a purpose that you have for us and it was in you Lord it was in your mind before the world began Lord reveal you more of your purpose to us tonight Lord God by your grace Lord God reveal more of yourself to us Lord God we're so thankful for your word and we ask that your spirit would continue to move amongst us here tonight as we prepare to take communion to show your death till you come Lord and then father as we leave Lord may we show your life hallelujah amen thank you lord communion shows your death but Lord as we leave and as we interact with the world in our family we show everyone your life thank you for this promise speak to us now through thy word in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you being see the praise god so I have some slides there Lydia had enough time yesterday and today to kind of make some quotes and I hope there'll be a blessing to you by the grace of the Lord this one make sure I didn't miss anything okay oh brother Simon had a good testimony don't let me forget he had a really good testimony shared with me from the Thailand trip and I talked to him last night and then he did confirm that when we were praying that God raised up a pastor on this last trip that's when that pastor got really solid and now he's sharing the message with everybody so Church God heard our prayer when he was over there we've said God give us a soul that would accept the message a pastor that would receive the message God answered us hey let's take the Lord for that amen hallelujah so we're very thankful for that both Simon confirmed that to me last night I was talking to him after I was driving home from the hospice care when I saw my coach so we have a good testimony about that as well so let's look at this here I like to preach on purpose you know I I just was looking for a really special picture you know something that kind of made you feel good you know that picture I don't know them it makes you feel good it makes me feel good like God's got something God's grew so great and so beautiful such a great purpose you know there's such a great thing that he has for us and I want to preach tonight on your purpose starts in God so I want to start with God because before you can find your purpose you got to find God amen and we want to look at some of these scriptures just to kind of remind us I just want to take maybe three or four sermons we'll see how many we can preach on purpose but eventually want to get down the spot where we can identify the gifts of the Holy Spirit in our lives because that's our purpose on this life you know God give you know if if a preachers / if my purpose is to preach the gospel and that's my purpose that's wonderful but I think everybody should know their purpose in Christ don't you brother Branham says you know he said we should all be just as interested in our gifts as the pastor is in his gift so that's my I guess that's my purpose behind reaching this is that everybody here can know God's purpose for your life and you know maybe God will reveal it through this these sermons or maybe to be in the next year in 2019 God reveal to you maybe God already has revealed it to you but I want everybody in this church to know their purpose the church when you have a purpose you can accomplish something you're not just wandering around aimlessly when I go to church but not quite sure what to do after going to church we want everybody to come to church knowing what they're supposed to do when they're here and then when they leave they know what they're supposed to do when they go home praise God that's the purpose behind this I guess the purpose so my inspiration as I've listened to brother Branham I've heard him talk about your purpose a lot lately and then Gus preachers like Joe Adams has talked about your purpose and Ben Arad talked about your purpose Simon talked about purpose and I've just been hearing that over and over again and then my own heart's desire this is what I shared earlier I want everyone to know their purpose in life I want you to be able to say God has shown me these are the gifts in my life and this is what God has called me to do I want everybody to know that praise God and then also I read this book this year it's one of the books I finished it was only there's only like 300 pages but I read this book and I got really it's called The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren now not everything's in there right but a lot of there's a lot of good things in there and so I'm going to be pulling some quotes from this book as well I really like how he just organized it so I'll be preaching a little bit off that so in order for you to find your purpose we must look to God first and let me set a timer here I'll try to just preach about 45 minutes here tonight now I looked it up on this is my screenshot from my phone but mirror and Webster says purpose is something set up as an object or end to be attained so in intention so I'm gonna use that word a lot tonight intention everyone has an intention that God has for your life God has an end and he wants you to become that thing that is at the end of his mind right at the end of your life God has something he wants you to become and we all kind of can we can all kind of understand what brother Branham was to become he was to become Eleazar are you with me Church that's what he was to become at the beginning we know he was to be a young pastor and then he was to be an evangelist but by the end of it thank God he was called to be Eleazar and he was set out to get a bride for Isaac amen thank you Lord that was his that was his intention at the end was to be Eleazar to get a bride ready to receive Jesus Christ amen so you and I everyone us of us have an intention God has intended you didn't be something you're supposed to become something I'm supposed to become something we all have a purpose that God has called us for now Colossians 1:16 says for by him we're all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist so you were created by God and he created you for a purpose amen and the reason you're here today as the brother Jose said yesterday is because he's causing you to stay here he's keeping you here amen he could have took you home this year but he allowed you to stay another year praise God thank the Lord see we consist by him or we we keep existing on the earth because of God he still has a purpose for us amen thank God for that now this is the very first chapter of the book and I I just you know wanted to show you I just I love highlighting and I just want to some of these quotes were so good I just wanted to read them from him you know I quote brother Branham all the time yesterday in fact was all brother Graham quotes I remember that it was all brother Graham quote so it's okay if I quote Rick Warren a little bit I thought he was inspired on some of these things he starts off this book by saying it's not about you the purpose of your life is far greater than your own personal fulfillment your peace of mind even your happiness it's far greater than your family your career or even your wildest dreams and ambitions if you want to know why you were placed on this planet you must begin with God you were born by his purpose and forest purpose the search for the purpose of life has puzzled people for thousands of years that's because we typically begin at the wrong starting point ourselves we ask self-centered questions like what do I want to be you know we shouldn't teach kids that back I what you want to be that's the wrong question Lydia what are you you in case you're what do you want to be that's the wrong question it should be Lydia what does God want you to be amen Karras what does God want you to be what because we cannot be at the center Christ has to be at the center I love see that's what I love I thought not that's inspired well what are my goal what should I do with my life what are my goals my ambitions my dreams for my future by focusing on ourselves will never reveal life's purpose the Bible says it is God who directs our lives of his creatures and everyone's in his power now he's using a different version so I'm giving you the King James now in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind so we got to be Christ centered not self-centered even in my life I must pray I'm 38 but I must pray it's not what I want to be it's what Christ wants me to be praise God so we must keep this in mind that our lives are in God's nail scarred hands amen Psalms 37 says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fought he should not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand now Turks can I just share a little testimony real quick brothers member when brother Simon and cam came to this church man you remember that I don't know what he'll say if you were coming with me so they came here for like three years from 2006 to 2009 thousand seven two years to 2009 and God ordered that to be here while they were here but the Simon wrote me a note a real long letter at the end of it and he said brother Jessie I was dying spiritually he said when I came here God sent me here and your brother in church he drove three hours every Sunday to come here Simon did Simon he came and he said God but through the preaching that was here God raised him back up from he was almost spiritually dead he said God ordered his steps by the Lord God ordered him God brought him back to life here and then we fasted and prayed and they started a church there and God has vindicated that church over and over again by giving them miracle after miracle after soul saved after soul saved God ordered that God ordered all the steps by the Lord and then God delights in your way because you're walking by his orders amen hallelujah so see they follow the leading Lord here god bless him after two years of sacrifice driving three hours one-way six hours every Sunday spending all that money on the Turnpike God's given them a wonderful church there and all this wonders americo's and people being healed and saved and it's God's ordering the steps of his righteous amen though he falls should not be utterly cast out for the lord upholdeth him with his hand so see God orders her steps and then he promised he promises here he orders her steps and if you fall on the step he promised I'm delighting that you're walking in the path that I've given you and I'm gonna pick you up if you fall amen because you're walking in my path your mom walking in my will you're walking the steps that I've given to you and I'm gonna be there I'm never gonna leave you nor forsake you amen see upholdeth him with his hand amen God's holding us up tonight amen because we followed in the order of the Lord now he says contrary to many books and movies and seminars tell you you won't discover life's meaning by looking within yourself you would probably try that already you didn't create yourself so there's no way you can tell yourself what you were created for I like this if I handed you an invention you'd never seen before you wouldn't know its purpose and the invention itself wouldn't be able to tell you either only the creator or the owner's manual could reveal its purpose and that's what the Bible is church the Bible is the crater's manual and we're gonna find what God's calling us to do in this book right here that's right see now the Bible says the heart is deceitful above all things so see you can't look in yourself and what do I want my life to be or what do I feel like I should do because it's deceitfully wicked above all things and desperately wicked who can know it I the LORD search the heart I try the reigns I've even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings so your heart here as emotions or feelings huh me no you can't trust your feelings if you followed your feelings you'd probably go to hell is that right or you'd be at the bar tonight or in some awful relationship if you followed your feelings you cannot trust your feelings they'll deceive you their witness equally wicked above the Bible said above all things you can't trust your feelings so you've got to trust the Word of God amen and then God will reward according to the fruit or outcomes of our decisions so we want to make sure we we guide our lives not by our feelings but by the Word of God look at the Bible says a fool earth no delight in understanding he doesn't want to understand about the ways of God all he wants is that his heart may discover itself isn't that what college people say I'm just going to go to my college I would discover who I am and they go join a sorority and get drunk and yeah they're discovered who they are you know they're that they're the children of the devil you know I just want to discover I want to see what I what all I'm supposed to be and they're looking in the wrong place you can't look inside yourself you've got to look up see of fooled the lights in the wicked desires of his heart so see that's what the buy that's what Rick Ward was saying there that's what the Bible says you cannot trust your own feelings your own emotions you've got to look outside that you've got to look to God amen proverbs 28:26 he that trusteth in his own art is the fool well I'm just gonna like all people on Facebook say all the time I see him say that well I'm just gonna trust go with my heart feeling I'm gonna go with my gut you can't always go with your gut now if your gut lines up with God's Word that's good but you've got to always go with the word aim head now this in church as you become a Christian yes then your gut will start lining up more often with the word then your feelings your emotions will start lining more up with the word praise God but when you first start serving God if you're a young Christian I see a lot of young Christians in here right the children you know even though thinks you know sister see us she's a Christian but she's a young Christian you know I think of other you know there's some of us are just serving the Lord you know I had the young just for a few years and so we got we have to learn those early years you cannot trust your own feelings all the time you've got to trust the Word of God like I've had numerous friends I've told this before I advise them just stay with the message stay with the word but they they they leave the message and they go out too so denominational churches to get a husband or a wife or they they trust their their feelings rather than the Word of God and that's a that's a fool so the only way they'll be saved is as a foolish version right because instead of choosing the word which a wise person would do they chose the foolish thing their feelings and their only hope is the very last little bit of God's mercy at the white throne judgment we don't trust in ourselves we trust in the word now the Bible that says it plainly here blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Oh hallelujah a church aren't you glad you have all the blessings Christ we shouldn't go home discouraged tonight saying oh well I'd uh just didn't get much out of it tonight the Bible says you have all spiritual blessings you just got to receive them amen well Graham said you are given the keys to a variety store amen in other words you're giving the keys to the Amazon warehouse because we all like Amazon right and then Amazon we got too late two days but we're all given the keys to a spiritual Amazon store and whatever we have need of the Bible said all spiritual blessings are given to us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus my medicine all's you need is the faith the ladder of faith to climb up there and grab a hold of any promise of God God's given us every blessing we need amen that's the Word of God accordingly has chosen us in him where were we chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy so part of our purpose is to be holy whatever God's called us to do even if we don't know what to do one thing we should do is be holy that means holy means separated dedicated consecrated we should live a separated life unto the Word of God and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to him to himself according to the good pleasure of his will oh my god predetermined our adoption we were not part of the family of God but God has adopted us into his family praise God and that was made him happy it was a good pleasure of his will God's good pleasure in other words God loves you Church God loves to bring you into the family of God it's his good pleasure to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace where he hath abounded all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure now that's why he said good pleasure Church are you catching that God delights in his people God loves when you come to church God loves when you worship Him God loves when you pray that's God's good pleasure God loves when you turn down sin God loves it and God's God's good pleasure he delights in each one of you when we're seeking his face amen having may don't understand mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in us so his will is his good pleasure and the purpose is in himself how many would know what their purpose is in life it's in Christ you're gonna find the purpose in Christ you're not gonna find it in a newspaper you're not gonna find it at the university I didn't find mine there you're not gonna find it anywhere else you are gonna find your purpose in Christ Jesus and I want to just show a few quotes here brother and said watch this carefully before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God was God God's an object of adoration no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as Eternal Spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are eternal are they not now look now program goes to the woman at the well see seeing that we're vindicated his Messiah side showing that little prostitute who he was others who had had them thoughts in God's mind like Peter Nathaniel and all those who is in God's thinking as soon as the light flash they recognize it they didn't have to pull them up to the altar amen hallelujah call them up and beg them and tell them you'll do something for them if they would and you give them a better living and see if you could speak to the boss for a job put them in a better location they didn't care they had to fight to hold in their place he said but there's going there's nothing going to separate us the Bible said from the love of God which is in Christ peril persecution death itself can't separate us because we was always was in his thoughts amen he's showing all those people who were thoughts of God he didn't have to beg them to come to God they willingly came to God amen now I want to say this Jesus may commit your life to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with the purpose can we say already Oh everything in your life has a purpose right if you get sick there's a purpose if you get well there's a if you go through a time where you lose your job there's still a purpose for that if things are hard to the church there's still a purpose in that praise God everything has a purpose an intention God uses everything and everything is intended to do something to produce something in our lives if he did not have a purpose he'd be the author of frustration and not a peace if you feel frustrated Church that's not the thing that's not the plan of God that's your own human discouragement God does not want to frustrate you tonight God wants to encourage you tonight he's not the one who authors frustration and agony and discouragement and down in the dumps and depression he doesn't author that he authors confidence because you know all things have a purpose amen his purpose is that after we would we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established and strengthened and settled ha ha hallelujah after every trial Church after you go through every trial what do you feel you feel stronger in Christ amen after every test after every hard battle after every discourage rep you come out of all that after you make it through and it feels like the storm has passed you should feel stronger and more stable and you should say I know I'll be ready for the next one whenever it comes because we know people in the church we talked with yesterday it seems like it just storm after storm after storm after storm right now right now you should thank God if you're not going through that God give you a six-month hiatus or a six-month rest or vacation from storms you should praise God you're walking on the mountain but there's people in our church too going through storm after sand they're not letting up and the storms keep going but see God could God had confidence that God could allow the storm to come to pass and their faith would withstand the storm amen because God promised not to give us a trial we couldn't withstand God promised that there'd always be a way out in the midst of every trial temptation there's always an exit sign there's always an escape sign and we've just got to find it and enter out through the escape or exit out through the escape and we've got to run to the strong tower Jesus Christ amen so you should feel stronger more stable and complete after you go through trials that's God's purpose that's God's intention after every trial you come out stronger than you were before that's how I feel after every trial in the church when people battle me or criticize me or come against me and they leave or whatever they do you know after that I always feel stronger like I know where I'm standing in Christ Hey because I haven't preached these things by my mind I preach it by the leadership of God amen I get criticized for preaching God's Word hallelujah that's just that's just persecution everyone that lives godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution remember the Bible said to everything there's a season what season are you are in right now spiritually is it a summer season you just enjoying the beauty of God's glory you know all the fruits picked off all what a glorious time is it for if you like you're going into a cool it's cooling down a little bit is it winter you feel really cold on God when is it winter what is the light gonna shine in my spiritual life or is it spring oh it feels all fresh and new again I think I just come out of the the snowstorm the snows all melted and the buds are blooming on the tree where are you at the Bible said there's a season for everything and there's a time to every purpose under the heaven and purpose means God's pleasure there's a time for every pleasure that God is going to accomplish in your life because that's what the Bible says the Venetians 1:5 that he does all things according to his good pleasure based upon his purpose or his intention your life now here is our text we read it earlier Paul's talking about going through trials and afflictions and he said he's called us with a holy calling a court not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began see if we want to know our purpose and God's intention why was I created a man why was I created a woman what is God's purpose for me we've got to look in Jesus Christ because the Bible said it was given us in Christ before the world began now let me let me drop this here I'm gonna preach us later or really after you become a Christian and you're really holy now you can start looking inside for your purpose because the Bible said the gifts and callings of God the gifts of God are without repentance praise God and the Bible said the gifts make room for themselves remember in proverbs so what when you first start as a young Christian if you don't know your purpose don't look inside yourself yet because if you're not born again you might start trying to do God a service but it might not be time yet like brother Simon brother Simon was I guess I've just been talking with him a lot lately he tried preaching earlier in his life and just he never got satisfied but then later years later he said he got the baptism only the Holy Ghost and now God is just opening up all these doors to go overseas and preach here and preach in Lorraine and he's preaching different places so we got to find the season or the timing there's a purpose for all of it and God's going to show it to us but we've got to go at the right time we've got to ask God God show me help me to look to you first and then once you show me let me look inside myself and see what gifts are in my life hope that's OK by the grace of the Lord that's right you're early in your life look to God and then once you get established once you get real styled you're really holy you're really living then you can start looking inside whoa I see this gift of my life I see God manifesting this in my life what is what gifts are in my life and gotta show it to you that's right now God's purpose is in here God's purpose for you is in him and it's the mystery of God's will for your life the Bible said he's made no notice the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself so see God has a purpose for you but it's a mystery until he reveals it to you brother Branham says it plainly I'm gonna skip down here he quotes this scripture see the mystery of his will and the mystery of his of his will God's will is a mystery and the church said so God loves you you get saved you cry at the altar you shout you say glory hallelujah I'm a message believer but now you enter mystery mode what does God want me to do why am I on this earth why do I go to this church why do I live with this family why why do I go here it's a mystery and God lets us wonder we get all excited but then let's just wonder around for a while in mystery not sure what we're supposed to do and each man of course woman has to seek out the will of God for his or her self God's mystery now like what he says here a Rick Warren I've read many books that suggest ways to discover the purpose of my life all of them could be classified as self-help books because they approach the subject from a self-centered viewpoint in that the truth my self-help books even Christian ones offer the same predictable steps of finding your life's purpose consider your dreams clarify your values set some goals figure out what you're good at aim high go for it be disciplined believe you can achieve it involve others never give up the same nonsense all the time where does it ever say seek God fast and pray and ask God what your purpose is see it's it's self-centered what do you dream about brother Aaron what's in your dreams oh if I could do anything if I got all the money in the world I could do anything what would I do that that ridiculous it's so self-centered but it's got to be Christ centered if we're to find God's purpose he said of course these recommendations off the lead oftenly don't natural success you can usually succeed in reaching the goal if you put your mind to it but being successful fulfilling life's purpose are not at all the same issue you can reach all your personal goals becoming a raving success by the world standards and still miss the purposes for which God has created you doesn't that sound like the rich young ruler he reached all these goals so he had such a big bank account he had to build another bank to store up all his money he was so rich he reached his goals ma he was focused he met every goal he crossed it all off but that wasn't God's purpose for his life you need more than self-help advice the Bible says self-help is no help at all self-sacrifice is the way my way to finding yourself your true self and he says this is not a self-help book it's not about finding the right career achieving your dreams or planning your life it's not about how to cram more activities into overload actually it will teach you to do less in this life by focusing on what matters most it is about becoming what God created you to be so when you find your purpose in life you'll actually do less because it's Satan's tactic to try to get you to do too much that you spread yourself too thin and you can't actually do what God's called you to do help me know what Jesus said if you love your father mother more than me you're not worthy of me either love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy me he taketh not his cross and follow that for me is not worthy of me a cross is a slow death if you really love God you're slowly dying every day trying to follow his footsteps he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it how to do so you must lose your natural desires your feelings your your dreams your goals you must lose those in order to find Christ that's one quote that was actually good from the world I learned this quote from rocky those Rocky movies when the before I was a Christian rocky lost a fight and they said sometimes you got to lose to win and I and I used to quote that all the time before I came in the message I thought once I came the message I realize it's true we must lose our desires in order to gain Jesus Christ and it's harder to lose friends it's hard to lose family members it's hard to lose support or kind words it's hard to lose that but when you lose it you actually gain the favor of Jesus that's right you must lose in order to win you must lose everything into your desires every all your plans you must lose that in order to find Christ how then do you discover the purpose you're created for he says you only have two options your first option is speculation this is what most people choose they guess they theorize people say well I always thought life is like this this is the best yes I can come up with can I say real plainly Church I don't want anyone to guess well I guess God wants me to pray for the sick I guess God wants me to come to church I guess God wants me to pray longer I guess God was we shouldn't be guessing we should know our God wants us to do amen I guess God wants me to have a gift of wisdom I guess God wants me to give a prophecy or interpretation of tongues I guess God wants me to preach the gospel I guess God wants me to it's not a guess so it's not a home so it's a no so amen hallelujah we should know what God has called us to do and that's where I know this church can use a can use some help and the church said I can say Amen I want everyone in the church there's half an hour can you be there I want everyone in the church be able to say I know what God wants me to do in this church it's not just to come to church and pay your tithes and that's good and sing and worship that's good but there's something more than that there's a greater purpose God has for you than that that's part of it that's part of the word but there's gifts lying in your life there's purposes there's things you can do that other people can do and God wants you to root or discover those through his spirit see most people speculate well voices wanted to do this I've always wanted to preach so maybe I'll preach I never said that I never wanted to preach I never even thought I'd be a preacher so I came the message and then Tim Myers told me I bang I was texting today and I thought of you and I said I told him I said thank you for being such a fireball because when we first came to the message he was more of a fireball than I was he was so on fire I looked at him and I just get excited about Jesus just by looking at Tim Meyers so I thank them today for being such a fireball I said we wouldn't be where we are without you there wouldn't be a church and a car without Tim Meyers that's right that was part of his purpose in life and he looked at me and said Jesse you need to preach the gospel God's called you to preach and I never even preached yet but he saw in me a gift of preach because I love the word I was witnessing all the I was doing Bible studies I was writing on every scripture so I could memorize it and share it he saw to me before I even saw it but see we can't speculate about it we've got to know about it amen now he says fortunately there's an alternative to speculation about the meaning and purpose of life it's revelation see that's what I told you this is inspired speculation is not going to know your purpose in life it's revelation right the gates of Hell cannot prevail against your speculation you're guessing no it's your revelation we can turn to God I'm sorry we can turn to what God has revealed about his life or our life in his word these is ways discover the purpose of an invention is to ask the creator of it the same is true for discovering Lord your life's purpose ask God isn't that awesome and that glorious it's not why don't you just reach for your dreams and and shoot for the stars because even if you don't do it you'll land at the moon that sounds so pretty but it's so foolish we are the moon past the moon Marrissa past the milky white way into the seventh dimension amen and that's where the throne of Christ is hallelujah so it's not guessing is that speculation it's revelation Church which one of us has really really asked God Lord what do you want me to do and really take in time to listen afterwards which means like fast and pray devoted day a church we get so busy Satan tries to get us so busy in the message we hardly have any time to listen to God but I know businessmen that are in denominations brother Aaron and they'll take two or three days off just to go hear from God Church what could the Bride of Christ fellowship do if we would take two or three days off to hear from God what would we do we've got the message Cory aha but see saying gets us so busy and we forget about seeking God brother Branham would weeks off church weeks off and go up in the mountains and study and pray and wait on the Lord to get inspiration that's where God would meet him with the sword right marriage in divorce statute Rubert man he got static to perfect men he said sitting with his back against a tree and with a notepad and pen he drew he called the skeleton the triangle he drew that sitting and he said the squirrels were chattering and everything like that and that's where it got statue pervert man and so if we want to know we've got to take maybe a day off take a day off for work and just pray and seek God fast brother Jesse have you done that yes I have I fasted and prayed and before I preached your brother Brooks is the first time I fasted and prayed for a couple days then I preached you then God answered my prayer that I knew I was called to be a preacher but see you gotta ask God the right way not five-minute prayer say God what do you want me to do all right let's head off the Worker notes let's go fellowship let's go - lets go - Wendy's you know you got to really want to know you've got to really seek the face of God how many believe that you got to seek God's face and that means get out of ever you got out of for me get out of Facebook right get out of anything get out the internet just see God's face and I do that now but the writer said ask God well that's what Paul did after he met Jesus he was see this is what it is church trembling you got a tremble and say Lord what will you have me to do well it wasn't just a quick question he was trembling in the Friends of God and member Wednesday brother and remember that Wednesday when Motorama said the bride should tremble at the stay at the Lord remember that brother Ram said we used to tremble at the state the Lord but we don't anymore he said you have to travel that's it look he's trembling and boy what were you happy to do and Jesus tells them arise go in this city that shall be told thee what I must do honey new you see we got the tremble we got to be insincere we've got to be honest before God and then God will show us what to do ask and be willing to wait for the answer and I remember before I preached that first time I was I was behind the pulpit and I was right by that baptismal pool in Lima and I was shaking like a leaf I've never shake like that in my life and I'm praying God show me vindicate if I'm supposed to preach and I went out there and Karen gave a prophecy before I even preached and then after I preached the whole altar was filled with people that's when I knew I was called to preach because I prayed and fasted two days I shook and trembled like a leaf ask God to vindicate it God vindicate it now there's no more doubts amen so I know what this means you got to ask God you got to humble yourself we have to keep humbling myself for the next step of God in my life now look what Jesus said this is another passage where Paul's telling us he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecute us but rice Tanith on the upon my feet for I've appeared on thee for this purpose to be a minister and a witness both of these things which I was seen of those things in which I will appear unto thee delivering me from the people and from the Gentiles under whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me amen oh yeah Jesus said your purpose is two reasons you're gonna be a minister and you're gonna be a witness of me he's got two purposes Minister to preach and then to be a witness to testify before people a witness that Jesus Christ is alive Amen that's beautiful when you get the Holy Ghost you'll be witnesses unto Jerusalem Judea and all of all the all the ends of the earth right so everybody knows you're called to this well Jesse what's my purpose why no that's one of them witness be a witness right glory now look at this now this scripture proves you and I should live with such purpose or intention for the Jose you should know your purpose so much that you're closest believing friends know your purpose I very much should listen live so close to God that you know my purpose in life bang knows Jesse is called to do this this decision and that's what I don't know about every one of you you want to know that you need to know what I'm going to do and I need to know what you're called to do because look Paul says but they shall proceed no further those people that were the the last days were lovers of themselves more than lovers of God for their father shall be manifest in all men as theirs was also but thou has to fully know my doctrine my manner of life you should see how I live purpose faith long-suffering charity and patience Timothy watch Paul Timothy was around Paul so much he could look at him and say I know what that guy's purpose is in life he's a minister and a witness hey hey oh yeah he knew he knew he watched Paul so much he knew Paul's doctrine he knew Paul's manner of life his purpose his faith is long-suffering charity patience his persecutions afflictions he knew all about Paul but it one thing that he knew that's important for tonight it's his purpose in life and that's what I want you to know at the end of this series maybe you'll know tonight that be glorious that I can know what God has called Malachi to do and Malachi can know what God's called me to do I can know Lydia's purpose in life would that be powerful like programs you got thus saith the Lord member he said it takes all the spooks out all the fear all the guessing all the wandering all all the the questions all the doubt Satan tries to put in you what are you here for are you even do you even have a purpose you're just wait you're useless you're not doing anything for the church we've got to tell the devil to shut up and and we're not gonna believe his lies we all have an intent God has an intent for our lives God wants to do something with us hallelujah who would have thought when I was caressed his age your Haven we would have thought when my mom was dragging me to church nothing oh they're not dragged to church but I was who would have thought that my mother dragging me to church and I'd be the leader of a church one day who would have thought that well God did God God knew my purpose and revealed it to me I was always the last one to want to go to church and I was always the first one out of church so I go in the car listen to rap and rock and roll music now I'm the first one to church and the last one to leave that's God's purpose for me that's what he's called me to do I didn't see it I didn't know it but God's called me to it it's a holy calling and I should live with such a purpose now your closest believing friends know your purpose God is not just the starting point of your life he is the source of it I like that to discover your purpose in life you must turn to God's Word see this is a lot of this is good not the world's wisdom you must build your life on eternal truths not pop psychology success motivation or inspirational stories this is not Chicken Soup for your soul right I'll say like this this is ego food for your soul the Word of God is Eagle food for an eagle soul the and then he quotes Ephesians 1:1 now ready read it now how many want a peaceful life how many don't want to how many want to not battle discouragement and frustration life how many want peace in your life the Bible says when you walk after the spirit instead of being carnally minded which is frustration anger and fear and bitterness that's enemy against God for it's not I'm sorry but to be spiritually minded is life and peace don't you want to wake up every day and say I have peace with God I know what I'm doing what God wants me to do I feel the peace of God right the life of God is in my heart and I know I'm I'm excited about the future I'm excited to know what God's calling me to do it although I go through trials and people persecute me for what I do I have peace with God and I have life I have strengthened to it because I know God's called me to it amen glory you see when we walk in a carnal mind we can't obey the law of God when we're doubting and fearful and upset and angry at God or something like that or angry at other people you cannot submit to the will of God you cannot do the long odd unless you've got it which is a transform mind hallelujah so life and peace comes through spiritual thinking which is word thinking now I'm getting down to the close here my goodness that's 45 minutes already so he ends the first chapter by saying you discover your identity and purpose through a relationship with Jesus Christ that's true I don't know how many believe that if you don't have such relationship I'll explain later how did you begin to run well acts 2:38 told us how to do that that's right number two God was thinking of you long before you ever thought about him praise God his purpose for your life predates your conception in other words before you were conceived in your mother's womb he was thinking about you he planned it before you existed without your input he didn't ask you what you wanted to be when you grew up what do you want to be Jose when you grow up God didn't ask you God said I'd know it I want him to be when he grows up he's going to be this you may choose your career your spouse your hobbies and many other parts of your life but you don't get to choose your purpose and that's true you don't get to choose God has given you a purpose now this is I just want to lay this thought in here because this will this will cause you to go a little deeper in the Bible God gives you and I some choices on our own there's 45 minutes remember Jesus says there's only one we've said on Sunday yesterday yesterday mine there's only one cause for remarriage and that's a a woman that did not confess fornication to her husband before they got married he can divorce her and get remarried that's the only case for remarriage and then Peter says Peter says mines it's good that men don't marry because it's so C that's before they had the Holy Ghost but he said all men cannot receive this say save they to whom it's given now this is what Jesus says there are some choices that God leaves up to us right now he knows what we're going to choose or there's some choices God gives up leads up to us Luca verse 12 for there are some eunuchs now eunuch is a person who's willingly abstains from marriage Jesus says sir some eunuchs which were so born from their mother's womb so see that's that's God's calling God called them to be a eunuch they came out of the womb and God had called them you're not supposed to marry who's that st. Paul praise God so Jesus says some people like st. Paul when they were born they were there there's no desire to get married they're born to be single but now Jesus says which he said but there are some which were made eunuchs of men so that the the preachers in their lives or the men their lives encouraged them you know it'd be better you could serve God better if you didn't get married and so this okay I'll just take my dad's advice or I'll I'll take the pastor's advice or I'll take the prophets advice and I won't get married and still and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake so nobody told them to do it they just said I want to be single for God's sake and Jesus said he that's able to receive it let him receive it praise God so then I understand there's some choices in life that God gives you the choice but there's some things you were born to do and you don't have a choice on it and it's a good thing because your choices and my choices are usually wrong hallelujah because your feelings and your intentions are usually deceitfully wicked above all things but there are some things that God gives you a choice on like marriage now pastors don't really have a choice because they're a pastor has to be a man who's the husband of one wife till he's called from the womb to get married and have children because he can't leave the house of God unless he has his own children under subjection now no you must do the will of God how we know that you must do the will of God to be saved that's why I thought was inspired that Rick Warren said that you don't have a choice on your purpose if you want to be saved you have to do the will of God because Jesus says not everyone that says Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven so what is the foolish virgins and the foolish virgin is a person who does the will of God but it doesn't go all the way with it because they don't get born again they should have got born again but they did get born again and so they're a fool but they still get saved so they still do the will of God they just didn't do all of it Oh Church we don't want to be that way doing we don't want to come a little short of the goal how many one have achieved the goal I don't want to come this close again the rapture then miss it and then go to the tribulation I want to press through an hour to just I want to blow right past the finish slide I don't want to pass out brother bang ran ran a marathon and you need to pass out did you bang you finished right well it was that a couple years ago okay 2014 2014 bang practiced apparently unless you had a really good endurance before he practiced he practice and made sure he did what was required in order to finish the race and that's what we want to do we don't just want to guess and try to think we're doing what's right we want to do God's will and we want to cross the line that we want to finish the race and we want to reward that's incorruptible amen these worldly people they they earn trophies and prizes and it fades away it rusts it falls to the ground their money when they die goes to other people but when you do God's will you get a crown that will endure forever amen honey oh yeah you don't have a perp you don't have a choice in your purpose you have to do God's will and church we love we love knowing we love that because that's what's best for us we feel we that's the only place where we feel safe for the Jose is in God's will for our lives outside if I stop preaching I feel really uncomfortable if I stop making videos if I stop writing about God if I stop studying the word I feel really awful like when I go for two weeks without preaching I feel really strange so he ends a chapter by saying the purpose of your life fits into a much larger cosmic purpose that God has designed for eternity that's what this book is all about and that's scriptural because look though God's purpose isn't just temporary for you it's eternal to the intent there's purpose to the purpose that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so it's God's purpose that you will know all his wisdom according to the eternal unending purpose which he has purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him see God's God's motives God's objectives God's intents God's will God's purposes they're all eternal because the Bible said it's an eternal purpose that's what program said right but man said whatever you hear that's what you'll be the hare amen hallelujah I want to be a Holy Ghost field say I want to be a devil casting out Holy Ghost field site I want to be a sanctified saying and that means I'll be a sanctified Holy Ghost field st. over there amen hallelujah glory brother Ram said the man that rules over Nations will be able to handle every situation let me see if I can find that quote I think it was handled no I spelled it wrong there was every situation now how many want to do that church how many want to be able to handle every situation I think it was powerfully I'm gonna be real disappointed if I don't come up ah just a minute Aaron the church age book I just what quoted it and put it on Facebook well let's not hand off hey its handling no okay well he talked about the rod of iron he that overcomes will I give the rod of iron that will rule over the nation's and he said that kind of person has to so powerfully deal with every situation that means you're not scared when you have conflict Church it means you're not scared when someone comes against you and someone's upset with you or someone's accusing you of wrong you don't get scared you're able to handle with God's divine love I see it all the time don't you like when I've been going to see my friend at the hospital he has family members there and they custody and I've got a handle that situation I can't laugh at that so I've got to just turn my face and look the other way or I've got to change the subject you've got to handle every situation if they're saying oh it's doom and gloom is doom and gloom its doom and gloom you've got to stand there and say let's have faith amen you've got to handle the situation powerfully handle it let me see if I can quote rod of iron I've got to find this quote if I could just spell it right I'll probably find it I can spell of right whether the bang if I could just spell of right yeah there it is ah it's not handle it's cope there it is here let's read us now can I get a full screen on here yeah okay he's an overcome and then keep my works that's so small I'm sorry that make it larger no sorry it's going to be small he said he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end it is very evident from the remarks of the spear on works that the Lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentions works and now he says that he who keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be given power over nations and will be this and a strong who wants to be strong here strong who wants to be capable I mean you have the ability to do this unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation amen is that what brother Ram tried to do he tried to so powerfully deal with every situation brother Wade eyes when he's preaching right he dies and his wife passes out program said calm yourselves be still he prays for me said I called that spirit back in the name it ceases ha ha ha hey man now God showed him to do that right cuz he does it no man can do that God does God leads us to do all these works but he was he had such a peace that he could hear the Holy Spirit tell him to call the spirit back he can handle every situation now even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be this is the person that God gives the rod of iron to rule the nation's that means when your families make them funny are your families singing about Santa Claus you don't sing alone or your Santa your and your families breaking out the beer or the champagne you don't drink it and you leave the room and the church said hopefully that won't be you tonight hopefully you might have plans afterwards but if you are if you go to church remember you need to be unbending and you can cope powerfully with every situation because jesus said when you get the Holy Ghost its power power glory like one time a family member of mine tried to get me excited that they're getting married for a third time that's a lot of pressure they said someone just bought me a ring and we're getting married Jesse and church the Holy Ghost took over and I'd even met I just said oh we love you so much we're praying for you and and we're just so thankful you're in our family anyway uh and they were so disappointed they called somebody else in my family to say did you not understand and know that I understood but I didn't agree to it I tried to deal with that so powerfully and not give my approval to that I felt the power of God just come over me and I didn't fear I just said that I said well we love you and we're gonna pray for you and all these things I never I never would have compromise with sin I want to just stay away from sin let me try to close yeah I'll just close to this here I got a whole lot more I prepared so it's kind of comforting to know I got some more to preach Wednesday but I'll keep studying but just let's just and our feet here remember each the Bible's has all these purposes for Bible characters humming no David's purpose in life you know what the Bible literally said his purpose was Nathan was going to correct a member about Bathsheba and he says I'm sorry Nathan was going to correct him because Nathan said do whatever in your heart build the temple David and the Holy Spirit said no he's not gonna do whatever no he said therefore thou shalt saying to my servant David thus saith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep go from falling sheep to do what what's Davis purpose in life to be a ruler over my people over Israel the church I remember remember how old he was when he defeated Goliath fifteen jhummer how old he was when he first became king of Hebron thirty 15 years he went through hell on earth and I'm not cussing I'm just saying that's what the Bible says as he said I went it went down like to the depths of hell if I go down the depths of hell you're there 15 he knew brother vang he was called to be a ruler a king I was born to be a king I've slayed giants but things in his life didn't look what didn't look right but listen God wasn't the author of frustration ha ha ha God was not the author of that when David got frustrated and tired and worn out God was not the author of that God's the author of order God had to allow these trials in his life in order to make him the right kind of ruler that he wouldn't be a Saul type of ruler he'd be a ruler that was after the heart of God because church when he was running in the caves what did he do did he give up and try to commit suicide he prayed and sang songs I hope some of us will do that tonight amen if we're down in the scourge you're all alone I'm all alone I'm in a cave my back's up against the wall there's no hope sing some songs and pray like David amen how did it via you make it through the trials I know God called me to this I know God called me that don't give up on God if God told you it's gonna come to pass just try to pray in the midst of the storm try to worship in the midst of the storm say god I know you've got a purpose for me and you're not the author of frustration you're gonna work everything out for your glory you know Samson he was called the Bible said he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines he knew what he was born in uber there when he picked up that job Oh enough of them of the donkey and killed a thousand of them he said I was born to do this amen I don't know yet I was born to defeat from the Philistines he knew what he was born to do he knew his purpose in life his purpose wasn't to flirt with Philistine women and the church said your purpose is not the flirt with Laodicea not to see how much sin you can enjoy and still come to church and still try to serve God your purpose is not to flirt your purpose to be a Nazarite unto God Oh be holy your purpose is to be holy one more yeah cuz then I getting the brother branham I think yeah but I'm not gonna get to baram's purpose tonight Jeremiah knew his purpose he was ordained to be a prophet to the nation's God has not just called me to Israel God has called me to be a prophet to many nations ordained means a sign you're assigned to this job you're gonna be a prophet to many nations Jesus Christ he was he was born to save the people from their sins for this purpose the Son of God was manifested the purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil we all like that oh god help me to destroy something but the way he destroyed it was through himself dying in church many times that's what our purpose is we'll find our purpose through taking up our cross and serving other people when it doesn't seem like they deserve it did any of us deserve Jesus's suffering that he did for us did any of us deserve it no he destroyed death through death the Bible said he accomplished his purpose through the difficult task of the Cross that's how he destroyed the works of the devil by paying for all the sin and then the righteousness of God could come upon us because God's laws finally been met praise the Lord well I'm not going to get much further net so yeah a whole lot more to go church today I thought I'd might get through all that tonight but I've already preached an hour there you go again how many thankful for God's eternal purpose let me just have a word of Prayer let's just bow our heads here and we're going to testify right before we do communion I want to testify before communion so if you have a testimony keep it on your heart that's just bow our heads let me pray for you regarding God's purpose for your life see church eventually with this series I want to take it where you can know your purpose for example you can know if you're called to preach if your brother if you're not a brother a brother sister you can know which of them I want to I want you to know which of the nine gifts are in your life because there's then you can know God's intention for your life it is God's intention that everyone live holy so when I preach things that hard things about speeds more sanctified being more dedicated doing more prayer that is the will of God that's holiness your purpose is to be holy amen it's an eternal purpose it's part of the eternal purpose of God to be holy to give ourselves to prayer and the word and program sermons more than we give ourselves to the things of the world that's holiness but I want to take this where we can say God where you'll ask God not a book not a self-help book but you ask God's book God what do you want what why was I created on this earth what special gifts are in my life what was I called to do what was I born to do let's just bow our heads if you'd like me to pray for you just raise your hand and I'll just pray for you that God will show you the purpose of your life god bless the hands church please pray for me someone somebody pray for me they always know God's purpose for my life Heavenly Father we pray for one another Lord each one of us were praying for each other thank you for this night thank you for purpose your intention you had the end in mind when you made sister Naomi sister Kristin sister Beatrice when you made Malachi you knew the end what he wanted him to become just like when you made Lord a little sunflower seed you knew the end of that it was gonna grow eight feet tall and I was gonna put out all these seeds that would the birds would eat or the little kids would break out the the seeds and eat the seeds other shells you knew the intention behind that life and Lord you're the only one since you created us and you made the manual you're the only one that knows the intention for our life Lord you saw the hands I asked Lord that you'd show them that they would ask you they make time to ask you lord what's your intention for me Lord what can I do for the kingdom of God but ultimately Lord I want them to see what they're called to do is spiritual things Lord God because the Bible says earnestly covet the best gifts but we know love is the most excellent way but yet we can't we can't take away the move of the Holy Spirit that we should have in our church your prophet says it many times all nine gifts should be here but lower we gotta be trustworthy with those gifts and it has to be the season for those gifts we want to know what you place in our lives if it's a gift that we didn't ask for and we don't deserve it you just gave it to us and we just have to accept it but God first before that make us holy dear God let's not look outside to anything else let's look to you first and say God what's my purpose on this earth what am I doing here Laurie and Lord that purpose the answer will be in you in your word for Lord you purposed us in Christ Jesus before the world began Lord revealed every person I hope you'll do it tonight Lord but if not I hope you do it this year so every person can no not wonder what they're doing or wander from here pillar to post but be so focused they know exactly what God's called them to do like your prophet knew exactly at the beginning I'm to pray for sick people I'm to be an evangelist and then you moved as ministry I'm going to be the Prophet I'm gonna be the one who breaks the seals glory and that's the end you revealed to go to all different churches and me the Eleazar to go get a bride for Isaac thank you Lord by the end you showed him what was the end of his life what was the purpose for his life God show us Lord as well the purpose for our lives we ask you Lord God in this holy presence of God we ask you Lord for this purpose reveal it to us let it be revelation not speculation not a guess not presuming but revelation we ask this in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen let's give a round of

days I want to share this that happened to me in the last four days four nights ago I went I feel very sick my stomach my head my heart was beating very very fast I get DC and sweat call really feel bad and I when I talk to my daughter take me to the hospital I went to the emergency department about 8:30 at night and a two o'clock in the morning I still was in there you know when I went in room they didn't care for me my wife had with me and I had to hurry day the datum came in 30 minutes I'm going home that was up about 1:30 in the morning so wait away to 2 o'clock in the morning but I closed my eyes and I said and you say the same world a brother Brandon see the devil is going to take my life out until God accomplished his will and me right I will be out on God's time no I've known the double star and a 2 o'clock in the morning I talked to my let's go and I I stand up I went to this office emergency farm and I stay I'm I'm going home I've been here waiting for five hours you guys don't care for me but I think it's somebody care for me so I'm going home and I called my daughter to pick me I saw my son-in-law he came to the hospital Isana line jump into the car I thought to feel very well it was something very well even I went to there to my house and I sleep like a baby when I wake up about 9 o'clock maybe 10 o clock in the morning my body feels I feel what the owner Inglorious to God I know he healed me the day at 9:00 at 3:00 about 3 o clock in the morning I have a dream I usually don't drink too much and most of the time most of the time when I have a dream I feel that right away but this one I didn't forget for some reason am i doing I saw myself playing a guitar and singing a song and I was so happy I wake up it could be like a 315 maybe I was not too long I fall asleep again and I have the same dream but the amazing thing is in the in in the dreams I had a book the song of praise and worship and then my dream I saw much something and I say today George I'm going to sing the song 326 on the book two times my witness a cup I mean that day at dinner time I talked to my wife and my daughter and this morning early this morning I have a couple dreams but I'm going to check right now about those dream because I saw my doing the number the Sun and the title of the song and how I sing it and I told the computer at night look at Psalm number 326 and the book of worship and when I saw the title I just say praise God because that was the same number and the same sound I doing early in the morning to time and the title of the song is I was chosen from God and I think that was a confirmation about my dreams yes I think it was a confirmation and but also I had to say this is this dream has a double confirmation I was thinking about that today and I I say this audible confirmation because yesterday when we had the service here in the church I have a big headache so the the preaching was so good I don't want to miss anything well it was great but I had a pain my hair does really really was painful at the end of the service I came here for praying and church I'll I feel yesterday that God came to last I feel it myself I'm pretty sure he came to a big one depending on fly away right away I think I was just from God to be here brother just receive my Hindi pray thanks God for that as I have I just asked for you keep praying for my son Armando just praying for my daughter Jordan just in the scheduled for surgery on January 24 for kidney stone surgery but the great addition he can take the stone now without surgery you know to

it on your time well when we get our family thing we expect to get a miracle right away right right but no matter how you only take is still a miracle yes sir yes it was too many words from brother Brandon that helped me to pray something that he says a girl can't heal you from the fever today and you can die from fever tomorrow they don't make any difference God revealed today they will attack you tomorrow she it's a bar right as well but yes pray for me I need your prayers brother I is man my desire is to live close to God every day just I want to be ready when he called I know we all know that we are not going to be forever here no we we need to be ready later the company but it's a last I think it was Monday the last Monday or Tuesday I've been confused for a few days one of my brothers in the church that I first came and my country he passed away five days ago I think that was one of my oldest friends when I came to the message yes seven we still alive just only to myself and another brother who will be the next I don't know but I want to be ready I know because I know those testimony I know they made I know they made it I want to make it too I hope I don't take too much time for you yes it's something when I when I talk about the message I don't want to stop [Music] probably I would like to go back to my first role when I first came to the message that I spent like a probably more than 20 hours reading the message every day every day yes and I don't read too much now my still reading every day yeah is that also this morning this morning I have a dream but I still have to check with a message because it was about the message my doing so at this time I don't have the answer yet because I I haven't check it by I had a dream this morning and and because they're doing this about the trial I think they're doing this came from God probably because I was really ingesting the he sent his sign on the sky to give up to give a message to Adelie people in this age god bless you brothers brother Jesse god bless you thank you for your prayers thank you for being on such a spiritual leader thank you I appreciate from all my heart sister Christine thank you very much for all this brother sons it's a very how [Music] yeah yesterday during service Jose was going like this you know I was like is he okay is he okay and then he came up for prayer and God took that migraine or headache away right there and then he was crying and we were talking and smiling and worshiping and God just brought a swift healing there I just want to share one quick testimony he switch over here Lydia I think I have some pictures on facebook i've been putting progress on been praying for my high school track coach okay and this i've known he's been retired and living close to me for all these years here's a picture of him and he's still in the hospice right now close to death maybe one or two days away but all these years I've been over here I've been one to ask him do you know Jesus Christ as your Savior because he's a staunch Catholic and so I visit him four days in a row the first three days I could not ask and there were so many interruptions and finally I went last night and I was after preaching after your testimony Rosie I was really built up on faith I'm like I'm gonna ask him if he's trusting in Jesus Christ as his Savior not and so I went there with a lot of faith and I asked him I said are you trusting in Jesus Christ for salvation she said yes I am he said I am I am I said do you love Jesus Christ and he said I sure do I sure love Jesus Christ I said that's the best news I could get and but it came on the fourth day fourth days that they have victory right deliverance three you know a three in a row I couldn't get to ask him I just want to ask him and church I got oh I recorded it even on my phone to make sure I knew what he said and as soon as he got those words I love Jesus I was saying hallelujah praise the Lord somebody walked in there and just stopped our conversation right there so it just seemed like God gave me that little window and I want to thank him for that so I just wanted to know if he was trusting in Jesus Christ for salvation cuz he may go at any time and I felt like this church and I'm not trying to spiritualize it but that's my senior year my last that's me that's my senior year we were state runners-up and that was his last year of teaching and and because of the the talents God gave me I took him out as like a winner I took him out on top and I thought it was interesting at the end of his life God brings me back to him because I'm trying to take him out to go to heaven now because there's no greater thing you can do I just want to make sure are you saved do you know Jesus Christ as your Savior and he said he did so I didn't want to make it over spiritual but I thought it was so interesting I was there when he went out on this job and Here I am on the way out when he leaves to go to heaven hopefully by the grace of God I just want to share that testimony praise God any other testimonies anybody have any testimonies like to share mystified to the Lord tonight okay done yeah Oh but okay this is my wife come art you cannot hear me I didn't have watched faith I didn't know Jesse's gonna do that um but I never want to miss an opportunity just to share how thankful I am for God's goodness on our family and what I see him doing in the lives of our children and it's not anything that there's no formula we can't take credit for it but I'm just there aren't words to describe how grateful I am to see God blessing the seeds we've tried to plant in the sincerity and honesty in our hearts and to see them starting to come to faith and wanting prayer for things and blessing musical gifts and things and and it just fills my heart with a lot of gladness so I just want to thank the Lord for that and I look forward to seeing what he'll do with their lives and we just continue to pray God would keep them protected from the stains of sin and just the way the devil wants to get at them especially as they enter their teen years and so we're just thankful and thankful for the potential of the other little ones but I'm really grateful to Lord for that so I just wanted to thank him for that I just want to say you guys I'm so happy the Lord brought me this way everybody's so nice so loving so it's been such a gift he's gave me to come here and so I really it wasn't her playing on count-out so I really don't have much to say but I was I listened brother Branham for about six months and then I seen I remember my brother he brought me to brother Jesse's a long long time ago and then and then I seen you on on the website oh my TV there then and I said oh he's filled he's filled with the spirit and so I after I write listen of brother Branham was like oh I gotta go I get you know I was like I have to help him out and Missa yeah so that's how that's how I got here but yeah before beforehand I I really I wasn't really doing much with my life just probably hanging out with the wrong people playing a lot of video games not doing not doing much people would come and point to brother branham's picture and I was so ashamed I was like well I some say he's a prophet and you know I just you know but now it's a little different thank you Lord that we came in my life not now I know I can stand up strong for him and especially at work and you know it's the seventh angel messenger in the IRA yeah sorry I just wanted to say up really appreciate God that letting me meet all you guys this year all right [Laughter] [Music] [Music] yeah God amen thank you sir Oh amen very happy about the green health as well health is a great blessing

have any testimonies they want to share sister Naomi all right you ain't come on up let's give our sister round balls [Music] okay I wasn't really planning on this I'm sure my thoughts of you like all over the place I'm so thankful for everybody here like everybody has in one way or the other helped challenged me to become a better Christian of course I'm not where I'm supposed to be that I am so sure I know where I used to be Here I am so thankful for that like every everybody here like even the kids I am so thankful for everyone thankful for the kind of mom of course sometimes I feel so inadequate I'm not sure if I can bring these kids up in the fear of God I'm trusting God you know and once in a while I chance on them Indian saying you know say something from the Bible or something we had in churches it's so blessed this might help like I'm so grateful for that at least they hear something like at least something something goes good in there and it's take so I'm I'm so thankful I'm so I'm so so thankful for that and I pray God helps me I mean the I girls in it I know it's gonna be like lots of teaching and explanation so I look up like god help me to become like clothes to wash chair but sometimes I feel so inadequate I pray God helps me too to be able to explain to them I mean why they should leave how they're supposed to live in everything that comes with it and especially because over here is like just asking the messages so more or less like the family they have that they will be going to that'll be seen most of the time they have to like leave very differently from them and it's something I pray God helps me to be able to explain it to them and he gives them a heart to also be able to and then Bert van was talking about green card so I applied I

a phone we got home and apparently my charger was not my home charger had been taken to worry about my husband so I did not have a charger home and then for some reason I was using my mom's phone and then I took I took off the screen protector from the phone because it was cracked and then I left today then after a while I'm like okay why is the phone let me I got a charger with the phone I I looked everywhere for it I asked the kids nobody has taken a like we looked for it for hours and then I went to bed the next day I looked for it I left for work so and we came back my mom was like are

is good thank you I'm like I asked the girls did you put in here they said no I'm like are you sure but I mean they they what I'm trying to get out it's like no matter how little the prize no matter how unimportant we think it is I believe like God listens to every single one every single he's always untrained always some of these little things kind of like boost my confidence in God like it helps it's encouraged you see that if he listens to do two little ones and definitely the bigger ones that I prayed for his praise the Lord God is so good to us anyone else have a testimony yeah all right let me come on up let's give her a round ball all I want to say is that I just want to thank God for bringing me he's brought me farther in my walk with him this year than I was last year I'm a lot farther than I was and I just want to thank him for that and it's it's really encouraging to know that he's working with me and he knows where I'm going and he knows where I've been and I'm not where I've been I'm not where I'm gonna where I need to be but I'm gonna get there with his help that's faithful to finish what he started praise God anyone else have a testimony all right let's stand and what's gonna come up here for communion I'm gonna get the scriptures ready here Harvey no it's too long it's got a llama yeah may be out next week you say that song I am the lord of healeth thee [Music] let's read our scripture first Corinthians 11 you know one of the Saints was telling me recently about how they visited a denominational Church and they did they took communion but they didn't read all the scripture around it they just read the nice parts about it and didn't read the part about responsibility so I want to make sure I read all that about being responsible in other words we have to be careful how we eat of the bread and drink of the wine we got to be very careful and we got to examine ourselves and make sure we live in the right kind of life [Music] 1st Corinthians 11:23 before I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which he was betrayed took bread when he given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is a New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord that's what our friend was saying they don't read that in all churches the words they just want to invite everybody everybody come take communion but they don't tell you that you have to take it the right way let's make sure we take it the right way let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged when we are judged we are chastened to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come let's have a word of Prayer and let's pray that these symbols will be a blessing to our spiritual life the natural is not as important of course but it's more about the spiritual meaning of these symbols how many Father we just come and reverently we thank you for these testimonies we've heard we've heard the word we've worshiped you Lord we've asked for prayer Lord we prayed prayers for people many important things nor these testimonies have raised our faith Lord if your interest in the little thing how much more the big thing more than I thank you Lord for answer my prayers I could ask a dying man if he loves you or not to make sure he's ready that meant so much to be Lord God after three days of failure Lord on the fourth day you brought the victory I thank you for that Lord God but now Lord we examine ourselves help us look at our own lives are we treating others the way we should be treating them Lord let us examine ourselves now are we thinking the right thoughts let us examine ourselves right now are we saying the right words let us examine ourselves [Music] are we looking at the right things on our phones and our tablets let us examine ourselves are we doing the right things with our money let us examine ourselves Lord God within doing the right thing in our marriages or if we're singari living a godly single life dear God let us examine ourselves more here tonight Heavenly Father Lord we just ask those things may we be pure Lord God as we examine ourselves wash us in thy blood Lord God if there's anyone that needs the repent Lord forgive them Lord may they repent and may they leave this prayer a changed person there are we already changed before they hit the door Lord granted Lord Jesus let's these symbols bless the bread and the wine Lord they're just natural symbols of what spiritually we've done here tonight we're remembering your death until you come bless our communion in Jesus Christ's name and the church said the Bible says and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this to remembrance of me I'm gonna come and pass these around here let's sing and just hold the bread until we're finished here by God's grace singing I am the lord at he lathy that he live I am the Lord your healer I said my word I said my word and healed your disease i am the lord nor he years and again i am the lord i am the lord your here i said my word and healed your disease i am the lord your here i am lord i am the lord that hila the lord your here i said thy word and healed your disease i am when he given thanks he brake and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this to remember to me let us remember the broken body of jesus let us partake together remembering the body of Jesus [Music] after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is a New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it and remember to me let's remember the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ as we partake of the the wine together see that you are the God that healeth me you are the God [Music] you said you're worried you said your word you are the gun you said your word and I have the God that healeth thee oh I am the god you're here I said my word and he was a god you are the God that healeth thee you are the Lord I either you sent your word and healed my disease you are the God ie let's just thank the Lord praise God thank you lord I just want to share one quick testimony we were a cam Church two weeks ago and God supernaturally healed cams wife do you remember when she used to does everyone remember when she used to live does anyone remember that and we prayed for her time and time again I mean we had such powerful anointings and it wasn't a miracle it was just over the course of years she was still like limp everywhere the doctor said your hips like an 85 year olds and cam said they just had a day of worship on Christmas they just worshipped like all day I guess and it was after that God just started he owned her and now she can run up the stairs she can barely go upstairs beforehand the doctors gave her no chance so she had a full hip replacement and our Lord is the God that heals I remember praying for numerous times multiple times our God sent His Word and healed her thank the Lord for that praise God thank you Jesus that one more time [Music] you are the guy oh you are the god you [Music] sent your I have to God I am the God that healeth II I said my word I said [Music] [Music] you can head back to your seats if you like we'll have Malachi play a few songs here but just seeing the ones that you wrote down here buddy maybe do those maybe Jose and Aaron I can get the the buckets right would that be okay [Music] you [Music]
