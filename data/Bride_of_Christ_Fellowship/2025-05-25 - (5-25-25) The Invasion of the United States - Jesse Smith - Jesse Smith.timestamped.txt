[0:01] When I had that long break of no
[0:02] preaching, I was listening to brother
[0:03] Brandham uh the invasion of the United
[0:05] States. I'd like to preach that today. 2
[0:07] Chronicles
[0:08] 18:12. 2 Chronicles
[0:15] 18:12. Brother Rand preached this in May
[0:18] of 1954, 71 years ago. He was preaching
[0:22] on the invasion of the United States.
[0:34] Second Chronicles
[0:36] 18:12, 13 and
[0:49] 14. I trust you're thankful for God's
[0:51] faithfulness. Praise the Lord. Trust
[0:53] you've had a good week in the Lord. God
[0:55] helping you, strengthening you by the
[0:57] grace of God. And I trust this message
[0:59] will be a blessing to you. Brother
[1:01] Brandon, for years, I think about six or
[1:03] seven times years after he preached this
[1:05] message, he would remind the people.
[1:07] Remember, you remember when I preached
[1:08] on the invasion of the United States?
[1:10] So, it was a seemed like it was a very
[1:12] important message to brother
[1:14] Brandon. Um, and this was when he
[1:16] started that series. He started a
[1:18] six-part series in 1954. He called it a
[1:21] teaching revival at his church. He
[1:23] taught on the invasion United States uh
[1:25] the seal of God, the mark of the beast
[1:27] and then he did two services on
[1:29] questions. Oh, he taught the seven
[1:30] church ages in 1954 and then he taught
[1:33] uh two questions and answer services
[1:35] calling it a teaching revival. So, it
[1:37] was a nice time brother Ram could lay in
[1:39] his Bible doctrines uh during that
[1:41] little time and then it was seven months
[1:43] later in December 19 I'm sorry 54 when
[1:46] brother Ram gave that quote about the
[1:47] new pope coming for the United States.
[1:49] So 1954 was a very uh powerful year. Of
[1:52] course all those years were but uh very
[1:55] powerful there in prophecy where God
[1:57] seemed to show brother Brandham uh all
[1:59] about America and its place and of
[2:01] course the pope coming out of America as
[2:03] we looked at on Wednesday night. So 2
[2:05] Chronicles 18:12 13-
[2:09] 14. Why don't I read uh 12 and 13 then
[2:12] we can all read 14 together. Kind of
[2:13] seems like a strange text, right? And
[2:15] brother Brandham preached this as a
[2:17] Sunday school before the regular sermon.
[2:20] I think brother Neville preached it on
[2:21] uh that Mother's Day. He actually
[2:23] preached this on Mother's Day. It was a
[2:24] Sunday school sermon or Sunday school
[2:27] teaching he called it. Um so quite an
[2:30] interesting text here. Verse 12 says,
[2:32] "And the messenger that went to call
[2:34] Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold,
[2:36] the words of the prophets declare good
[2:38] to the king with one ascent. Let thy
[2:41] word, therefore, I pray thee, be like
[2:43] one of theirs, and speak thou good.
[2:45] Verse 13. And Micaiah said, as the Lord
[2:48] liveth, now the brother said, that's a
[2:50] true prophet. Even what my God saith,
[2:54] that will I speak. He wasn't going to be
[2:56] persuaded or try intimidated or seduced
[3:00] to go along with all the other prophets.
[3:02] He was just going to say what God told
[3:04] him to say. And when he was come to the
[3:06] king, the king said unto him, Micaiah,
[3:09] shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle
[3:11] or shall I forebear? And he said, "Go ye
[3:13] up and prosper, and they shall be
[3:15] delivered into your hand." Verse
[3:17] 14. Let's read that one together. Oh, I
[3:19] already read it, didn't I? Okay. Sorry.
[3:21] May God add his blessing to the reading
[3:22] of his word. You may be seated. Sorry, I
[3:24] didn't see that little 14 there. I was
[3:26] thinking about parts of the
[3:27] sermon. Hallelujah. So, I'll set a timer
[3:29] here uh by God's grace just to kind of
[3:32] see the progress we'll make.
[3:35] So, we look at the evasion of the United
[3:37] States today. A lot of these things will
[3:39] uh probably be a little familiar. I'll
[3:40] try to bring in some thoughts. But, as I
[3:42] said, as I took that little break there
[3:44] at the hospital and didn't have to
[3:45] preach for two services in a row, I was
[3:46] listening to this. This was the same
[3:48] time, you know, um we were waiting for a
[3:51] new pope. And as I said on Wednesday,
[3:53] you know, Brother Bam uh said it was
[3:54] according to prophecy, but he didn't
[3:56] give the specific prophecy. So, I just
[3:58] feel like it was a general prophecy out
[4:00] of the book of Revelation 13. Brother
[4:03] Ram never spoke thus sayith the Lord in
[4:04] that prophecy. And now church, you
[4:06] already have people saying that this
[4:08] pope is going to be the antichrist. You
[4:10] already have message believers saying
[4:12] that the new pope will be the
[4:14] antichrist. Now that's that's going too
[4:17] far in my opinion because we don't have
[4:18] thus sayith the Lord for that. What if
[4:20] time goes on and he, you know, we get
[4:22] another pope and he's not from the
[4:23] United States. What is it? What it does?
[4:25] It just hurts people's testimony because
[4:28] they're presuming, right? They're saying
[4:29] things that God didn't say. Hey, brother
[4:32] Ram didn't say thus sayith the Lord in
[4:33] that quote. But you know there also is
[4:35] grace for them too. But it just brings
[4:37] reproach upon the the gospel. There is
[4:39] grace because remember even that saying
[4:41] went abroad amongst Jesus's apostles.
[4:43] Well, John's going to live till the Lord
[4:44] returns, right? Remember that in John
[4:46] chapter 22 or I think it's 21 if I'm not
[4:49] mistaken. So, you know, there is room
[4:51] for Christians. You know, of course,
[4:52] their humanity and their human mistakes,
[4:55] but I've just been in the message long
[4:57] enough. I've been in the message since
[4:58] 2001 at the very end. I've just been in
[5:00] here long enough to realize I don't want
[5:02] to make a fool of myself and I don't
[5:04] want to bring reproach upon the Lord
[5:05] Jesus Christ. Right? We've had people
[5:08] say the the Camala Harris was the
[5:10] fulfillment of the six vision, but the
[5:11] nation never the whole nation was never
[5:13] under her complete power. Right? So, it
[5:17] comes and goes and people people just
[5:18] forget about these things. They just
[5:20] jump from one thing to the next trying
[5:21] to trying to make themselves look
[5:23] spiritual. But we don't want to try to
[5:25] be spiritual. We actually want to be
[5:27] spiritual. Hallelujah. We don't want
[5:29] everyone we don't want to try to impress
[5:31] everybody with how much we know. Uh we
[5:34] don't want to do that but we just want
[5:35] to be we actually just want to do what
[5:36] brother taught us. Brother Ram said he
[5:38] said always he said it will speak thus
[5:40] sayith the lord if it comes from the
[5:42] lord always. He used the word always and
[5:45] he cares do you care 1963. So if if
[5:49] there's no thus sayith the lord attached
[5:51] to this new pope from America well then
[5:53] we don't want to make it like that. So
[5:55] what do I say? I say brother had a lot
[5:57] of insight. We do know that brother Ram
[5:59] had a lot of spiritual revelation and
[6:01] insight to know there would be a pope
[6:03] come out of America. But that's insight
[6:06] according to Revelation 13 which most
[6:08] churches don't have. In fact, the only
[6:10] church I've seen that believes America
[6:12] is in Revelation 13 is the 7th day
[6:15] Adventists because I went and looked in
[6:17] one of the books Uriah Smith. He
[6:19] believed uh the United States was
[6:22] Revelation 13 11-18. Let's read that
[6:25] again here since we got time here today
[6:27] by God's
[6:29] grace. So, let's go to Revelation 13:11.
[6:31] This will be good for uh Claude and
[6:33] Patrick, any of the new saints here. Uh
[6:35] if you don't know where the United
[6:37] States is in the Bible, it's in
[6:39] Revelation 13. Now verses 1 to 10 was
[6:43] the change of pagan Rome under all their
[6:46] Caesars and emperors into paple Rome
[6:49] because the the Bible said the beast had
[6:51] a wound and they thought it was dead but
[6:53] then it lived again. Okay. So the the
[6:56] cath uh the Roman Empire changed from
[6:58] the Roman Empire into
[7:01] uh the the Roman Catholic Church. Right
[7:04] around 400 to 500 is when uh AD was when
[7:08] the Roman Empire fell and everybody
[7:10] thought it died, but it lived again in
[7:12] the Roman Catholic Church. Okay. Now
[7:15] verse 11. And I beheld another beast
[7:18] coming up out of the earth. This beast,
[7:19] Brother Bram said, was the American
[7:21] buffalo, which Barack Obama made the
[7:23] official mammal of the United States. I
[7:25] think it was in 2015, right before he
[7:27] left office. And he had two horns like a
[7:30] lamb. It was like a lamb, but it wasn't
[7:31] a lamb. Brother Ram said that's
[7:33] ecclesiastical and civil powers. And he
[7:35] spake as a dragon, right? The United
[7:37] States always says how powerful we are.
[7:39] We're the greatest nation. We have the
[7:41] greatest
[7:42] weapons. Verse 12. And he exercised all
[7:45] the power of the first beast before him
[7:47] and causes the earth and them which
[7:48] dwell therein to worship the first beast
[7:50] whose deadly wound was healed. So
[7:52] America will bring about the worship of
[7:54] the pope. America will bring that about.
[7:58] Verse 13. And he doeth great wonders so
[8:00] that he maketh fire come down from
[8:01] heaven on the earth in the sight of men.
[8:03] There's only been two atomic bombs
[8:05] dropped and that was by the United
[8:06] States. That was fire coming down from
[8:08] heaven. Verse 14. And deceiveth them
[8:11] that dwell on the earth by means of
[8:12] those miracles which he had power to do
[8:14] in the sight of the beast, saying that
[8:16] they or to them that dwell on the earth
[8:18] that they should make an image to the
[8:20] beast which had the womb by the sword
[8:22] and did live. In other words, they've
[8:24] got to worship this spirit of Rome. The
[8:26] spirit of Rome was what was leading the
[8:28] Roman Empire. Now the spirit of Rome is
[8:30] in the Roman Catholic
[8:32] Church. Verse 15. And he had power to
[8:34] give life unto the image of the beast
[8:36] that the image of the beast should both
[8:38] speak and cause that as many as would
[8:40] not worship the image of the beast
[8:41] should be killed. See, we're not there
[8:43] yet, right? We're not there yet where
[8:45] this uh America lays down a law. Brother
[8:47] Ram said they'll lay down a law where
[8:50] it'll be illegal. If you don't have the
[8:53] mark of the beast, you can't buy or
[8:54] sell. Okay? So we're not to verse 15
[8:57] yet, are we? Now verse 16. Brother Ram
[8:59] said this is he said this verse proves
[9:02] they'll force the bride to stop
[9:04] preaching before the rapture. That's
[9:07] what brother said in 1962. Spoken words
[9:09] original seed. He causes all both small
[9:12] and great rich and poor free and bond to
[9:14] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[9:15] their foreheads. So that's the verse
[9:17] brother Random used. So, that's why I've
[9:20] always said when they shut down our
[9:22] church or they say we can't preach
[9:24] anymore because we're not part of their
[9:25] religious uh council, that'll be a great
[9:28] sign and the rapture's on. I've always
[9:31] thought that. Okay. And I don't have
[9:32] thus sayith the Lord on that. We just
[9:34] have brother saying the Lord told him to
[9:35] pick up his pen and
[9:37] write.
[9:39] Okay? Now, verse 17. And that no man
[9:42] might buy or sell say that he had the
[9:43] mark or the name of the beast or the
[9:46] number. So, see, there's three ways you
[9:47] can take that mark.
[9:49] Right? You can take it
[9:50] uh you can take the mark or the name,
[9:54] right? Or the number of his name. Verse
[9:57] 18, here is wisdom. Let him that hath
[9:59] the understanding count the number of
[10:00] the beast, for it's a number of a man,
[10:02] and his number is 600, three score, and
[10:04] six. Of course, that's the Roman
[10:06] numerals that add up to the vicarious
[10:08] filt day or die. How do you say that?
[10:11] Day. Uh the vicor of Christ. That's what
[10:14] the pope is called. I've got the
[10:15] catechism. It calls it, it literally
[10:16] calls him that in there. He's the vicor
[10:18] or in the place of Christ. So he's
[10:21] taking the place of Jesus, right? But
[10:24] he's what he's doing. He's taking the
[10:25] worship of Jesus is what he's actually
[10:27] doing. And he's going to sit in the
[10:28] Jewish temple of God when they rebuild
[10:30] it saying that he is God. But by that
[10:32] time, we'll already be in heaven by
[10:34] God's grace. Hallelujah. We believe
[10:35] that. That's what the prophecy uh from
[10:38] scripture that we believe. He's going to
[10:39] snatch away his bride first, then he's
[10:41] going to pour out his judgments upon the
[10:43] earth. Okay. All right. So that that's
[10:47] America's place. Okay. Now he also said,
[10:51] let's go to Daniel chapter 2. He also
[10:53] said that this beast would spread
[10:55] through
[10:56] intermaring. So Protestants marrying
[10:59] Catholics. So go to Daniel,
[11:02] please. Daniel chapter 2. I didn't
[11:05] really plan to do this one, so I don't
[11:06] have the exact verse, but I'll find it
[11:08] as soon as
[11:09] uh I get there. I got it all highlighted
[11:11] in my Bible.
[11:14] how the seed is uh spread
[11:16] here. Daniel chapter
[11:21] 2. Yes. Verse 43. Whereas thou sawest
[11:25] iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
[11:28] mingle themselves with the seed of men.
[11:30] So brother Ram said that's Protestant
[11:32] and Catholics
[11:35] marrying, but they shall not cleave one
[11:37] to another even as iron is not mixed
[11:39] with clay. So the toes and feet have
[11:42] mixture of iron and clay. But Ram said
[11:45] iron is Catholicism. Clay is
[11:47] Protestantism. So when these when when
[11:50] these Catholics marry, they they
[11:51] purposely marry because they're led by
[11:53] the wrong spirit. They purposely marry
[11:55] Protestants in order to convert their
[11:57] whole family to
[11:58] Catholicism. Okay? So that's one of the
[12:01] strategies. This that's the invasion
[12:03] United States church. And the church
[12:04] said, "Amen." That power uh as as we'll
[12:08] as we'll show in a little bit, our
[12:09] pilgrim fathers left uh Europe because
[12:13] of the influence of the Roman Catholic
[12:15] Church and of course King George I. We
[12:17] left all that. That's what brother Ram
[12:19] mentions in the sermon. We left to get
[12:21] away from that and then we allow it
[12:22] right back in. Right. Brother Ram said
[12:25] the Bible says like a dog going back to
[12:27] its vomit. Right. Not the believers now,
[12:31] but the lukewarm believers. Yeah, I'll
[12:33] say like this. The makebelievers. It
[12:35] could even be the foolish virgin because
[12:37] look, Lot married the wrong person. Look
[12:39] what happened to his wife. Right? But
[12:41] not the wise virgin, right? The wise
[12:43] virgin stay Abraham stays all out of
[12:45] that as we preached on Wednesday night.
[12:46] Hallelujah. He wasn't living in Sodom.
[12:48] He was far away from that. Abraham was.
[12:50] Hallelujah. He's the one God visited
[12:53] with the sign of discernment like we're
[12:55] visited with brother Ramon's gift of
[12:56] discernment. Hallelujah. We believe
[12:58] that. We recognize that. Okay. Now, so
[13:01] there's your foundation a little bit on
[13:03] the invasion of the United States or
[13:04] that spirit of Rome into United States.
[13:07] I'm just going to do a brief uh summary
[13:09] of Brother Bam's sermon. If you haven't
[13:10] listened to it, you'd love it. Listen to
[13:11] invasion United States 1954. I think
[13:13] it's May 9th if I'm not mistaken. It's
[13:15] May for sure. Now, Brother Ram starts
[13:18] off the sermon by saying he always he
[13:20] said, "Brother Ram, why do you got to
[13:21] use Old Testament verses?" And brother
[13:23] Ram said, "I always look for a type or
[13:26] shadow in the Old Testament because I
[13:29] know if that's how it starts, that's how
[13:31] it's always going to look like." Right?
[13:33] If you look at a shadow, like I can see
[13:35] Jose's shadow over there on the wall.
[13:37] Everybody see that? If I look at that
[13:38] shadow long enough, I'm going to pretty
[13:39] soon find Brother Jose. Looks a lot like
[13:41] him, right? Yep. There's his hand and
[13:44] everything. So, brother, they they were
[13:46] kind of critical. Brother Ram, why do
[13:47] you use Old Testament? Brother Ram said,
[13:49] "I'm looking at the shadow. If I can
[13:50] find the shadow, it'll be very similar
[13:52] to the real thing. The Old Testament law
[13:55] was a shadow to point us to Christ. So,
[13:59] brother Ram goes to the days of Ahab.
[14:01] That's his shadow. Ahab and Jezebel are
[14:03] the shadow. And it's right because in
[14:05] Revelation 2 and three, Jesus says, "The
[14:08] spirit of Jezebel's in the church, and I
[14:10] hate it." Right? So, brother man's very
[14:13] wise, very scriptural to find a shadow
[14:15] of Jezebel and Ahab and Micaiah and
[14:18] Elijah in the Old Testament and bring it
[14:20] to the New Testament. Supernaturally
[14:22] inspired, brother Random was.
[14:25] Hallelujah. He said, "I'm a typologist."
[14:27] He said, "I know what happened before is
[14:29] always going to repeat."
[14:31] Right? And then he said, uh, this this
[14:34] time where he reads, uh, Ahab's time was
[14:36] Israel's darkness of midnight. It was
[14:38] one of the darkest times. And then he
[14:40] types Ahab and Jezebel uh with United
[14:43] States. Now we know later what six years
[14:45] later uh JFK was
[14:48] elected, right? And now Brother says now
[14:50] JFK is the modern
[14:53] Ahab, right? And brother said Jacqueline
[14:56] Kennedy was the modernday
[14:58] Jezebel because her fashions influence
[15:01] the women, right? And so we see that. So
[15:05] brother's preaching the look at that.
[15:06] Brother's preaching six years in
[15:07] advance. Uh they he's preaching about
[15:09] getting to Ahab and then they get to
[15:11] Ahab. And then we got a second Catholic
[15:14] president, Joe Biden, right? Who we
[15:18] we're finding out now uh whole time had
[15:20] an autopen running all of his
[15:22] legislations. He wasn't even running the
[15:24] government now. It didn't take a smart
[15:26] person to know that's what was going on
[15:27] beforehand.
[15:30] Didn't take a smart person at all to
[15:31] know that. Spent most of his time on
[15:33] vacations and beaches instead of running
[15:35] the country. He was never running the
[15:37] country. But no, everybody knew that
[15:39] that had their eyes open and was honest.
[15:42] And he says, "Now Ahab was a brother Ram
[15:44] said, Ahab was a makeeliever like a
[15:46] Judas." In other words, sometimes you it
[15:49] looked like he believed it, but he
[15:50] wasn't a real believer.
[15:52] And then brother Ram said what messed
[15:54] him up was his marriage because he
[15:56] married a princess of a Sidonian king
[16:00] who was already a murderer. A murderer,
[16:03] right? So he married the wrong one.
[16:05] Brother said there's no other reason to
[16:06] marry her other than she was pretty.
[16:09] So So we right because she had no
[16:11] character, right? She was she wasn't a
[16:14] good person. She was a heathen princess.
[16:16] There would be no other reason to marry
[16:18] her other than prettiness, right? Or or
[16:20] we'd say her her uh her her
[16:22] attractiveness or something like that.
[16:24] So brother tells us again, make sure you
[16:26] marry based upon character and not
[16:29] because of someone's physical
[16:30] appearance. Hallelujah. That's right.
[16:34] Ram said, "Under no circumstances marry
[16:36] an unbeliever. Never marry an
[16:38] unbeliever." And the church said,
[16:40] "Amen." Hallelujah. Ram said, "His
[16:42] marriage messed him up." Now, here's a
[16:45] list, church, of all the wicked things
[16:47] that Ahab did. And Jezebel, just
[16:50] briefly. First, he married the wrong
[16:52] woman, right? First Kings 16. Uh, she
[16:56] was a pagan princess. Then they promoted
[16:59] the false prophets and they suppressed
[17:02] God's true prophets according to first
[17:05] kings
[17:06] 18-19. Remember because Ahab gathered
[17:09] the 450 prophets of Baal when they went
[17:13] up to Mount Carmel, right? So it just
[17:16] shows Ahab had false prophets. He was
[17:19] with the big group, the popular group,
[17:21] but they were all false.
[17:24] And then he allowed Jezebel, well, well,
[17:26] Jezebel actually did it behind his back.
[17:27] the murder and theft of Nabbos's
[17:29] vineyard. And he never did anything
[17:31] against it, right? He let her murder. Uh
[17:34] they stole land. So they were thieves
[17:36] and murderers and idolattors.
[17:39] Hallelujah. And then he refu refused to
[17:42] fully repent even after Elijah warned
[17:45] him that dogs will lick your blood.
[17:48] The Bible said, remember he the Bible
[17:50] said he did repent for a little bit. He
[17:52] walked lightly before God, but then he
[17:54] went right back to his old pagan ways.
[17:57] See church, when you repent, you got to
[17:59] have a real change of heart. See that?
[18:02] You want to see your actions change. If
[18:04] your actions don't change, you didn't
[18:06] really repent.
[18:08] Hallelujah. The Bible said Ahab did walk
[18:11] lightly for a little season, but he
[18:13] didn't repent all the way. But see,
[18:15] church, we've got power to really
[18:17] repent. Hallelujah. We've got the Holy
[18:19] Spirit to help us really overcome.
[18:21] Hallelujah. Speak the word. Hallelujah.
[18:24] And God will give you strength and
[18:25] grace. Speak the word and go forward,
[18:27] bride of Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. So,
[18:31] Jezebel promoted Baal worship and
[18:34] witchcraft. She killed the prophets of
[18:36] the Lord, the Bible said. Uh, and yes,
[18:40] she had the false trial against Nabboth.
[18:42] She mocked and opposed God's
[18:45] prophets. And then she was involved in
[18:48] sorcery and
[18:49] whoredoms. Yeah, that's right. The Bible
[18:51] says in 2 Kings 9:22, "What peace as
[18:54] long as the whoredom of thy mother
[18:56] Jezebel and her witchcrafts which are so
[18:59] many?" So she was either participating
[19:02] in in whoredoms or allowing whoredoms.
[19:05] The Bible's not real clear. In other
[19:07] words, she might have had other lovers.
[19:08] We don't know. But one thing's for sure,
[19:11] she allowed whoredoms in the kingdom. So
[19:14] you have sexual sin, uh you have murder,
[19:17] you have idolatry. They actually built
[19:18] their own temples, right, to false gods.
[19:22] So they had all this
[19:23] idolatry. And this is what happened. And
[19:26] then the Bible said all this was because
[19:28] of Ahab sold himself to the devil.
[19:32] Right? Uh go to First Kings, if you got
[19:34] your Bible, First Kings 21:25, you can
[19:36] put up
[19:37] there, church. What am I saying? Don't
[19:40] sell out your convictions
[19:43] no matter what. It always normally it's
[19:45] family members and so forth, right?
[19:46] brothers, sisters, moms, dads, husbands,
[19:49] wives, they try to get you to sell out
[19:51] your beliefs. Don't sell them out. Stand
[19:54] on your ground. Hallelujah. Stand your
[19:56] conviction because what does it make you
[19:58] when you sell out your beliefs? It makes
[19:59] you a spiritual prostitute.
[20:02] Brother uh Dennis just preached that to
[20:04] us, right? Brother Ram said, Brother
[20:08] Dennis said, "We can't prostitute our
[20:10] time. We can't sell out our time and
[20:11] give our time to the things of the
[20:13] world. We must give our time to God."
[20:15] Amen. That that's that's that's Bible
[20:18] teaching, right? The a a man who's a
[20:21] prostitute is called a whoremonger. But
[20:23] a woman who prostitute is called a
[20:25] prostitute or a right? And this
[20:28] is what Ahab was. He was a spiritual
[20:31] prostitute. But there is none like unto
[20:33] Ahab which did sell himself. He sold him
[20:36] out. He sold himself out for it to work
[20:39] wickedness in the sight of the Lord whom
[20:42] Jezebel's wife stirred up. So who was
[20:44] stirred him up? the other prostitute.
[20:46] It's one prostitute stirring up another.
[20:50] It's one demon-possessed person stirring
[20:52] up another one that becomes
[20:53] demonpossessed.
[20:56] See, church, you're going to sell
[20:57] yourself out for one thing or another.
[20:59] Amen. Sell yourself out for Christ.
[21:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Give all your
[21:04] time, give all your attention, and uh
[21:07] give all your love to Jesus Christ.
[21:09] Don't give it to the world. Hallelujah.
[21:11] Don't become a spiritual prostitute. Be
[21:14] a faithful, spotless, blameless bride of
[21:17] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Be a pure
[21:19] woman. Be a pure church before God.
[21:22] Hallelujah. That's right.
[21:25] Amen. And remember, we don't have to
[21:27] read it, but in First Kings 21:19,
[21:29] Elijah said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, the
[21:31] dog will lick your the dogs will lick
[21:33] your blood."
[21:36] And church, now we get to the part of
[21:37] the story in 2 Chronicles 18 where
[21:40] Jehoshaphat comes in at the request of
[21:43] Ahab and he makes an alliance. And
[21:45] brother goes into this in the in the
[21:47] sermon. He makes an alliance with Ahab
[21:49] said, "Yes, brother. I'll go up there
[21:51] with you and I'll fight uh the Syrians
[21:53] at Ramoth Gilead because that's our
[21:55] promised land." And church, you probably
[21:57] know the story. That was their land.
[21:59] Israel was trying to get back their
[22:01] land. And so it looked like they had a
[22:04] good reason. Oh, we're just going to go
[22:06] get the victory. We're going to drive
[22:07] the enemy out. Moses said we can dry him
[22:10] out. Yes, he could. Yes, he did. But
[22:11] Moses said first you got to be in
[22:13] obedience to God. You can't expect God
[22:16] to fight for you if you're not living
[22:18] holy. Praise God. Glory. If you're being
[22:22] a spiritual prostitute, how's God going
[22:24] to help you get other land when you
[22:25] haven't even conquered the land you got
[22:26] right now? Praise God. See, they wanted
[22:29] land to to possess, but the land they
[22:31] were possessing wasn't in wasn't
[22:33] glorifying God. Let's glorify God with
[22:35] our lives right now. Praise God. So, you
[22:38] know, we think, oh, we want to uh for
[22:40] for us, we want more money or we want a
[22:42] bigger church or, you know, we think we
[22:44] want to expand, but let's be faithful
[22:45] with what we got right now. Praise God.
[22:48] Why would we why would God give us more
[22:50] if we're not faithful with what we got
[22:52] right now? Praise God. Amen. Oh, it's so
[22:58] true. And I like I like Let's go to 2
[23:01] Chronicles 18:9. I like what brother
[23:03] says
[23:09] here in the text that we read 2 uh 8
[23:12] it's 18 verse 6 Chronicles
[23:22] 18:6 but Jehoshaphat said is there not
[23:25] here a prophet Lord besides that we
[23:27] might inquire of
[23:29] him so in this story I forget was there
[23:32] was There are 400 in this
[23:36] story. Yes. 400 men. In verse 5, there's
[23:39] Jehoshaphat walks in and brother said,
[23:41] "At least he was a spiritfilled
[23:44] man, right? He was a good man.
[23:46] Jehoshaphat destroyed many idols." All
[23:49] right? Because he was the king of Judah.
[23:51] But he goes up here to the northern
[23:52] part, northern Israel, which Ahab was in
[23:54] charge of. So Jehoshaphat was living a
[23:57] good life. He got all the idols out. But
[24:00] he makes an alliance with Ahab, right?
[24:04] And he walks in there, 400 preachers are
[24:06] prophets are saying, "Thus said the
[24:07] Lord, go up. God's going to give it to
[24:09] you." And Jehoshaphat's like, "Is there
[24:12] anybody else that here has opinion from
[24:13] the Lord?" And brother said, "See, he
[24:16] said because Jehoshaphat had been in the
[24:19] presence of God, he knew better. There
[24:21] was something different about him." And
[24:22] brother says, "When once you're in the
[24:24] presence of God, you can't be deceived."
[24:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He said
[24:29] Jehoshaphat and Micaiah, they'd already
[24:32] been the prince of God. So when they're
[24:33] around these other preachers like, "This
[24:35] don't seem like a message service." And
[24:36] the church said, right? You can go
[24:39] online, you listen to other preachers,
[24:40] you can tell that don't sound like a
[24:42] message preacher. That's because they're
[24:43] not. They haven't been the presence of
[24:45] God. Hallelujah. They'll let the women
[24:48] crossdress. They'll let the men turn
[24:49] into women. The women turn into men.
[24:51] They'll let children change their
[24:52] identities and all these things. They
[24:53] haven't been the presence of God.
[24:55] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Or they'll say
[24:58] you got to speak in tongues. That's the
[24:59] evidence or something like that. Or
[25:00] women can preach like we've been because
[25:02] because Rod's been here. I've been
[25:03] bringing that up a lot and he he
[25:05] believes it too. He's a holiness man.
[25:07] And so I bring up these obvious ones.
[25:09] Anyone that's been the prince of God
[25:11] knows these are sins. And God's spirit
[25:14] will help you hate your sins.
[25:17] You can't love righteousness and
[25:18] worldliness at the same time. The Bible
[25:20] says if you love the world or the things
[25:22] of the world, the love of God's not even
[25:25] in you.
[25:26] So Jehoshaphat's like, "I feel a little
[25:28] nervous around here." Yeah, 400 seems
[25:30] like a lot, but isn't there somebody
[25:31] else here? Isn't there somebody else uh
[25:34] who's got a prophecy? They're like,
[25:36] "Yeah, verse
[25:38] seven. Yeah, there's one more prophet.
[25:42] Isn't there any other tapes that we Is
[25:44] there any other prophets in the last
[25:45] days other than these modern guys?"
[25:47] Yeah, there's one more. They called him
[25:49] William Brandom. Yeah, there's another
[25:50] guy out
[25:51] there. Verse seven. And the king of
[25:54] Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "There is
[25:56] yet one man by whom we may inquire the
[25:58] Lord, but I hate him." Oh, that's a real
[26:00] good Christian loving spirit there,
[26:03] Ahab. Oh my. For he never prophesied
[26:07] good unto me, but always evil, the same
[26:09] as Micaiah the son of Imla. And Joseph
[26:11] said, "Let not the king say so." Don't
[26:13] be so harsh, please. Look how kind
[26:15] Jehoshaphat
[26:16] is. And church, that's the way it is
[26:19] today.
[26:20] There's all these pro internet prophets,
[26:23] right? All these internet
[26:25] prophets. But isn't there just one more
[26:28] saying something different? Yes. William
[26:31] Brandham said something different.
[26:32] Church, all these prophets today are
[26:34] saying America is going to have a
[26:36] revival and Jesus going to come back
[26:38] when everything in America finally
[26:40] honors God. They think there's going to
[26:42] be a national revival, but they don't
[26:45] know it's thus sayith the Lord. She
[26:47] won't
[26:49] because of what we read in Revelation 13
[26:51] and Daniel chapter 2. And brother Ram
[26:53] said, "Thus say the Lord, she'll never
[26:55] come back."
[26:57] Hey, pull up uh switch over here. I got
[26:58] this. I'm reminded that now because
[27:01] Brother Ram said in
[27:04] 1956 was the last time. Let me just put
[27:07] this up. I was over there at the
[27:08] hospital. Let me just put this up here.
[27:10] Okay, so this is 1953 and I was walking
[27:14] to the hospital all those times to get
[27:15] food for my wife and everything and I'm
[27:17] like what? And I was listening to 1954,
[27:21] you know, invasion United States. I'm
[27:23] like, look at these women. Can I This is
[27:26] 1953. I'm just going to I'm gonna leave
[27:28] this up here for a while. Look at these
[27:30] women. These are women in Orville, Ohio,
[27:32] right by our house. These are the nurses
[27:34] on staff. Now, how many would like a
[27:35] nurse like that compared to these modern
[27:37] just look the church? They all got long
[27:40] hair. Every single one of them got long
[27:42] hair. Now, I don't know about hers, but
[27:44] she might have a bun back
[27:46] there.
[27:48] 1953. And Brother Ram's already saying
[27:52] America's been
[27:54] invaded. Now, look at some of their
[27:56] shoes. I was I thought I saw now look
[27:58] some of these. They're a little bit of
[27:59] high heels, but they're most of their
[28:01] shoes are pretty low. I guess I can't
[28:02] see because of the
[28:04] black. But I just want to give you this
[28:06] is about the time brother's preaching.
[28:07] the US has been
[28:10] invaded, right? She been invaded. Now,
[28:13] if if the US was invaded in 1954, what
[28:16] do we got today? It's almost total
[28:18] takeover, right? Because that's, as we
[28:21] saw in the scripture, Satan has to take
[28:23] over this nation in order to form the
[28:25] image of the beast or the image of this
[28:27] one world church. And who's the leader
[28:29] of the one world church? It's going to
[28:30] be the pope
[28:32] because the woman rides the beast. The
[28:34] Roman Catholic Church rides the spirit
[28:36] of Rome. And who's the leader of the
[28:38] woman? The pope of Rome. All
[28:42] right. So, we can see it plainly. See,
[28:46] now and church, this modern is called
[28:47] the NRA, uh the new uh new apostolic
[28:51] reformation. These Pentecostal people
[28:53] today, we'd say they believe in all the
[28:55] miracles. They love Brother Ram's gift.
[28:57] I've watched videos. I got videos of it.
[28:58] They love Brother Ram's gift, but they
[29:00] hate his doctrine.
[29:03] and church. They they've even announced
[29:05] I've heard two of them say this that God
[29:07] is going to give the whole church the
[29:09] mantle of William Brandham. I've got the
[29:11] videos. They love Brother Brandham's
[29:14] ministry because it was always right and
[29:16] it was
[29:17] supernatural.
[29:19] Hallelujah. And the one guy said, "Well,
[29:21] I went to God and said, "God, can I have
[29:22] it?" He said, "No, you'd be prideful."
[29:24] He said, "But what if you give it to
[29:26] everybody and then we won't be
[29:27] prideful?" And he said, "God said, I'll
[29:29] do that." What a lie that is.
[29:33] What a lie. He told he he told all these
[29:35] millions of NRA people, these false
[29:38] prophets, we're all going to have the
[29:39] anointing of William Brandham when Paul
[29:41] said, "Are all
[29:43] prophets? Are all apostles? Are all
[29:46] teachers?" And the church said, "Amen."
[29:48] Liars. See, that's what they lie.
[29:50] They're just like the days of Ahab. All
[29:52] these prophets are lying in the name of
[29:55] the Lord. And any spiritual person will
[29:57] be able to pick that up and say, "Isn't
[29:59] there somebody else who is right?" Yes.
[30:01] The spirit of God was right in the
[30:03] ministry of William Brandham.
[30:04] Hallelujah. Amen.
[30:08] They're false prophets, liars, just like
[30:11] the days of Ahab and
[30:13] Elijah. Oh, these are the days of
[30:18] Elijah. Hallelujah. We got all these
[30:20] false prophets, but we got one true
[30:22] prophet. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[30:27] It's true.
[30:29] And which one said there'd be an
[30:30] American pope? The true prophet said
[30:32] that. Hallelujah. By the scripture, he
[30:34] knew
[30:35] that. Hallelujah. I asked Chat GTP how
[30:39] many people predicted that. Chat GP
[30:40] couldn't find anybody predicting an
[30:42] American pope. I know that's just in a
[30:44] machine, but but I heard numerous uh
[30:46] reporters say they never thought
[30:48] there's, oh, there'd never be a pope.
[30:50] Not in my lifetime there'll be a pope
[30:51] out of the US, but a prophet of God saw
[30:54] it. Hallelujah.
[30:58] See, they hate the holiness preaching of
[31:00] the Bible. But remember, the Bible said
[31:02] we're called to the high calling of God.
[31:05] We don't have a low calling. We've got a
[31:07] high calling. God wants us to live
[31:09] higher in heavenly places in Christ
[31:13] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[31:15] church.
[31:17] Uh Jeremiah 5:31, Jeremiah said, "The
[31:21] prophets prophesy falsely and the
[31:24] priests bear my bear rule by my by their
[31:26] means and my people love to have it." So
[31:30] see that that's why these people the
[31:32] people stay in the false churches
[31:33] because they love false prophecy. They
[31:36] love lies.
[31:38] But we hate lies.
[31:40] So we repent of when we when we don't
[31:42] tell the truth, we repent of that. And
[31:44] the church said, Amen. Amen. We should
[31:47] hate lies. We should love the truth.
[31:49] Praise God.
[31:51] But see, the worldly the the makeel
[31:53] believers, they love lies. They can tell
[31:55] as many false prophecies as they want
[31:57] and then back it up and then keep
[31:58] telling more. The people love it. Oh
[32:00] yes, everyone's going to have the
[32:01] anointing of William Brandham. Liars.
[32:04] They're
[32:07] liars. But Micaiah come and says, "I'll
[32:10] only say what God says." That's the true
[32:13] prophet of
[32:14] God. And brother Ram said, "The same God
[32:17] rules on the throne today that was
[32:20] ruling in the days of Ahab, Micaiah,
[32:24] Jehoshaphat. The same God is on the
[32:27] throne today." Hallelujah. And we will
[32:30] only say what God's already prophesied.
[32:33] Hallelujah. We won't add to it. We won't
[32:36] one We won't take away from it. Not one
[32:38] thing. Hallelujah.
[32:40] Now, church, where are we at now? We're
[32:42] probably in the middle of the birth
[32:43] pains. Now, we just had two babies born
[32:45] and I just saw my wife go through two
[32:46] days of birth pains. The contractions
[32:49] are are difficult and it seems now the
[32:53] pressure is off, right? It was a lot
[32:55] harder under the Biden
[32:56] administration, right? More people are
[32:58] being arrested and uh you couldn't have
[33:00] free speech. Even at the schoolboard
[33:01] meetings, church, think of that. Even at
[33:03] a schoolboard meeting, uh the FBI after
[33:06] you stand up against a school board, the
[33:07] FBI would come in and take people away
[33:10] and call them terrorists all because
[33:13] they don't want woke ideologies in their
[33:16] schools. So, see, right now, it seems
[33:18] like maybe we're in the uh birth pains
[33:20] here. We're in the in between stage
[33:23] where we're not in a contraction. That's
[33:25] my wife would would have something to
[33:27] eat there between the contractions, get
[33:29] some water, get some kombucha, get some
[33:31] strength for the next
[33:33] contraction. And brother Ram said,
[33:35] "Hallelujah. I feel the spirit, Holy
[33:38] Spirit's here. The invasion's on just
[33:40] sweeping from house to house, from place
[33:42] to place, from church to church, from
[33:44] man to man." He said, "Children, in the
[33:46] name of Jesus Christ, rise with the
[33:49] moral stands of the revival and the Lord
[33:52] Jesus Christ and say, I'll take the way
[33:55] with the Lord's despised few." Yes, sir.
[33:58] He said, "I'll be a real mother. I'll be
[34:00] a real dad." In other words, brother
[34:02] said, "In the name of Jesus Christ, you
[34:04] should rise up and say, I'll be a real
[34:06] Christian today." Praise God. No matter
[34:08] how much uh uh the enem is coming in
[34:10] like a flood, no matter how much the
[34:12] United States is being invaded by evil
[34:14] spirits, we've got to fight against the
[34:16] evil spirits.
[34:18] That's right. Now, how did these
[34:21] pilgrims get to America in uh they came
[34:24] to North America in 1620? They were
[34:26] escaping the government, which was a
[34:29] monarch rule. They lived under the
[34:31] English monarch uh monarchy uh King
[34:34] James I. He had strict control over
[34:36] their religious practices. The church
[34:38] and state were intertwined. There was no
[34:42] separation of church and
[34:43] state. Any dissenters would be fined,
[34:47] imprisoned or maybe killed. This is what
[34:50] they left. Now they were fighting
[34:51] against the church of England which was
[34:54] Anglicanism but it was very close to
[34:57] Catholicism. It wasn't Catholicism but
[35:00] it was very close.
[35:02] The pilgrims were separatists, a group
[35:05] that broke away from the Church of
[35:06] England. They believed the Church of
[35:08] England was too similar to the Roman
[35:10] Catholics, and they wanted to worship
[35:11] freely and independently according to
[35:13] their their interpretation of scripture,
[35:16] not the Anglican interpretation of
[35:18] scripture. Hallelujah. And because of
[35:20] that, they faced persecution,
[35:22] imprisonment, and harassment. There was
[35:24] numerous times, church, the pilgrims
[35:26] tried to escape, but they got foiled a
[35:28] couple of times until finally they were
[35:31] able to cross the ocean, right, and come
[35:33] to North America. So, see, church, you
[35:35] know, we got to let that encourage us.
[35:37] If they were willing to go to any
[35:38] lengths to overcome the devil, we've got
[35:40] to go to any lengths.
[35:42] And most time ours is just our phones or
[35:44] our friends or family or something like
[35:46] that, something small like that. But
[35:47] they're actually getting arrested,
[35:49] putting in prison. God help us to fight
[35:51] against sin. Hallelujah. Amen. Whatever
[35:53] form sin comes into your life, fight
[35:55] against it. Praise God. Because those
[35:57] that have been before us had a much
[35:59] greater battle than we had. Praise God.
[36:03] Against physical arrests and
[36:05] imprisonments and uh fines and so forth.
[36:08] God help us. In other words, God help us
[36:11] to put eye salv on our eyes today so we
[36:12] can see the real battle today. Praise
[36:15] God. That's why I want to pray more by
[36:18] God's grace. How many How many need to
[36:19] pray more? You don't have to. We all
[36:21] need to pray more. Praise God. We got to
[36:22] be more sincere. Praise God. I feel that
[36:25] in my
[36:29] heart. Now, the Church of England was
[36:31] just like the Roman Catholic Church.
[36:33] They had the same uh hierarchy of
[36:34] bishops, which was
[36:36] false. Uh they had the same uh
[36:39] structured services, the common uh book
[36:42] of prayer. They had creeds, scripted
[36:44] prayers. Amen. Kneeling and sacraments.
[36:46] Church, do you see that? The pilgrims
[36:48] came out of creeds just like we are.
[36:50] We're the modern-day pilgrims.
[36:51] Hallelujah. Amen. We're coming out of
[36:53] the creeds, the Nyian creed and all
[36:55] these creeds of trinitarianism and
[36:57] dogmas. We're coming out of that just
[36:59] like our pilgrim fathers came out of
[37:01] those creeds.
[37:03] Amen. We're the modern-day pilgrims. The
[37:06] Bible says, well, the song says we're
[37:08] pilgrims and strangers on this earth.
[37:10] Praise
[37:11] God. They came out of the holy
[37:14] communion, right? Or the
[37:17] transubstantiation. They came out of all
[37:18] that just like we are coming out. We
[37:21] came out of that. Praise God. They came
[37:23] out of the stained glass windows and the
[37:25] fancy altars and the incense and the
[37:28] robes of the clergy, all that pump and
[37:31] circumstance. They came out of all that.
[37:33] And so have we come out of all of it.
[37:35] Hallelujah. They came out of it because
[37:37] they didn't believe in infant baptism.
[37:39] And we don't believe in it either. But
[37:41] we got two uh we got some baby
[37:42] dedications coming up. Right. Jose said
[37:46] his do uh stepdaughter is going to bring
[37:48] uh Levi here to dedicate next Sunday.
[37:50] Praise God. As soon as Tulsi and Evander
[37:52] get back here, we'll dedicate them to
[37:54] the Lord. Hallelujah. But we don't
[37:56] baptize them because they don't even
[37:57] know. They can't even repent. Praise
[37:59] God. But that's one of the issues that
[38:01] drove the pilgrims to leave. We don't
[38:02] believe in that. It's it's superstition.
[38:05] Praise God. It's it's not even
[38:10] spiritual. Now, brother said JFK and
[38:13] Jackie uh Kennedy was uh the Ahab and
[38:16] Jezebel of their day, right? Right. And
[38:19] JFK was a known whoreonger. He had so
[38:22] many adulteries with
[38:24] women. And of course, Jackie uh led the
[38:27] fashions the wrong way with the wrong
[38:28] hairstyles and the wrong clothes. And
[38:31] so, Brother Bon said that was uh Ahab
[38:33] and Jezebel coming in. And then we had
[38:35] Joe Biden, Catholic and name only, who
[38:37] was hardly awake during his presidency,
[38:39] right? He supported abortion. And the
[38:42] auto pen was basically governing. and
[38:44] church. If you've if you've seen the
[38:45] Doge accounts lately through Elon Musk,
[38:48] they sent billions and trillions of
[38:50] dollars to these
[38:52] non-government organizations which they
[38:54] didn't have to even tell what they were
[38:55] doing with the money. Where did all that
[38:57] money go? They added what? Five billion
[38:59] or five trillion to the debt. Where did
[39:01] all that trillions of dollars of debt go
[39:03] or money go to these rich evil people
[39:06] just making them more rich?
[39:09] You know, they they put a title like,
[39:11] "Well, we're going to be for uh clean
[39:12] energy." But they take the money and use
[39:14] most of it just to enrich themselves.
[39:17] Just printing money, just printing it
[39:18] off a printer and giving it away.
[39:21] Billions and trillions of
[39:23] dollars allowed. They're called slush
[39:27] funds. It's like a slushie fund. Okay.
[39:30] Can I have some slushy money? Can I go
[39:32] down and get a slushie? Anyone know what
[39:33] a slushie is around here? I don't. Our
[39:35] children probably don't know, man. We
[39:37] don't allow them to have slushies.
[39:39] It's just like a sugary drink you go buy
[39:41] at the gas station. It's like a dollar
[39:43] and you get this huge cup. It's probably
[39:44] like this now. All that sugar pumped in
[39:47] your system. Just it's candy money,
[39:49] right? Just play around and just waste
[39:50] your money on something to give the the
[39:52] the flesh some some lustly or lustful
[39:55] desires. Billions of dollars. And a lot
[39:58] of that money went to the Democratic
[40:00] campaigns
[40:02] to have the to to pay supporters to come
[40:04] in to pay these celebrity endorsements.
[40:07] Oh, it's a corrupt system. Praise God.
[40:10] But the Republicans are almost just
[40:12] exactly the same. Six of one, half a
[40:14] dozen of the other. Brother Ram says,
[40:17] you can see it now. You know, the the
[40:19] current president's been in office all
[40:20] these days. How many bills have they
[40:22] passed? I don't even know if they passed
[40:24] any. See, just six to one, half a dozen
[40:27] other. They want to change. Let's make
[40:28] some change. Praise God. But see, they
[40:31] don't want to because of the the money
[40:32] and the slush funds. Just keep
[40:35] everything going the same.
[40:37] Brother Ram said, "You could put a
[40:38] Abraham Lincoln or a George Washington
[40:41] in every office of every country and
[40:43] it's still not going to stop the
[40:44] prophecy. The prophecy of this na this
[40:47] is this nation has to raise up the beast
[40:49] image."
[40:51] George Washington was a mighty man of
[40:52] God. Abraham Lincoln was a good man of
[40:55] God. But even that wouldn't change it
[40:58] because why? There's more workers than
[41:00] just the leader. There's a lot of
[41:02] government workers and they won't they
[41:04] won't obey what's being what's what the
[41:06] leaders been projecting down to them.
[41:10] It's called the deep state. And the
[41:11] church
[41:12] said it's just not one person. It's all
[41:15] the people that are supposed to carry
[41:16] them out. They don't carry them out.
[41:18] Now, church, let's not leave it on them.
[41:20] What are we not carrying out in our
[41:22] lives?
[41:23] I could preach on them all day. You can
[41:25] say, "That's good. That's good. That's
[41:26] good." But what about you and I? What
[41:28] are we obeying? Amen. What what promises
[41:30] are we believing and and allowing God to
[41:32] come to pass in our lives? What demons
[41:35] are we overcoming? Praise God. That's
[41:38] what matters. Praise God. Amen. Now,
[41:41] church, it's been so uh it's been so
[41:44] infiltrated. The vice president is now
[41:47] Catholic. Marker Marco Rubio, Secretary
[41:49] of State's Catholic. RFK Jr., Secretary
[41:53] of Health and Human Defense Services, is
[41:55] Catholic. Shawn Duffy, the Secretary of
[41:57] Transportation, is Catholic. John
[41:59] Ratcliffe, director of the CIA, is
[42:01] Catholic and there's many more
[42:03] Catholics. There's Catholics on the
[42:04] Supreme Court. What I'm saying is the
[42:07] invasion is on. Catholicism is moving
[42:11] in, but we're not joining with them.
[42:13] We're staying as pilgrims. Hallelujah.
[42:17] I'm showing you right. The United States
[42:20] has been invaded by the Roman Catholic
[42:22] ideology. Oh, we're all the same. Yeah.
[42:25] Uh, I'll accept your worship. As long as
[42:27] you accept my praying to Mary, you're
[42:30] fine. As long as we just consider our
[42:32] church, we're not brothers with them.
[42:35] And if they are brothers, they'll come
[42:37] out because the Bible said, "Come out of
[42:38] her, my
[42:40] people." Hallelujah. That's
[42:43] right. Church, did you know 29% of the
[42:47] House of Representatives are Catholic?
[42:49] Almost 30%.
[42:51] and the Senate, 24% are Catholic. So you
[42:56] almost have 30% almost 25% are
[42:58] Catholics. And church, most of them,
[43:00] they all vote the same way anyway,
[43:02] right? They all voted for Biden's agenda
[43:05] and they all don't want Trump's agenda,
[43:07] right? They all vote against that. Most
[43:08] of them in most most cases. So see, it
[43:11] don't really matter what what religion
[43:13] they are. They all think the same
[43:14] anyway. Thank God that we have a
[43:17] transformed
[43:18] mind, church, if we were at any other
[43:20] churches, they'd be saying, "Oh, yes,
[43:22] God put Trump in place and he's going to
[43:23] bring revival." Well, God did put Trump
[43:25] in place, but it ain't going to bring a
[43:27] revival. I said it ain't it ain't going
[43:29] to bring a revival for the true bride of
[43:31] Christ. It's going to bring a revival
[43:32] for the world council, the churches
[43:34] system. Hallelujah.
[43:36] Is that right,
[43:40] church? We're blessed to be able to know
[43:42] what we know and see what we see.
[43:49] So, is there an evasion going on? You
[43:51] better believe it. Now, let me show you
[43:52] the next
[43:53] picture. This was in 1996. Anybody
[43:56] notice any differences there? And I'm
[43:58] sorry, it's
[43:59] blurry. From
[44:01] 1953 to 1996. Any differences there in
[44:04] the nurses? Uh, yeah. They all got short
[44:07] hair and pants
[44:10] on. Any difference? Yeah, there's a big
[44:12] difference. I got one more. Now, this
[44:13] was Now, this doesn't look 85. That
[44:15] might not be the right. But look at
[44:20] these. I don't think it's 85 because I
[44:22] was born in 80 and my pictures look way
[44:24] better than that. That's probably in the
[44:27] 60s or something like that. But just
[44:29] look at it now. Look, she's a little
[44:30] modest there, the young
[44:32] one. But look, you already have this you
[44:35] have this evasion coming in to where now
[44:38] and that's 96. That's 96.
[44:46] They're all bobbed hair and church. They
[44:48] all wear short rather said bobbed hair,
[44:50] painted face, shortwear, and Jezebel.
[44:52] Like it's all the invasion's
[44:55] here. It's not a surprise to
[44:59] anybody.
[45:02] Now, I'm almost done. I'm not going to
[45:04] preach all day
[45:05] today. Isaiah 59:19.
[45:10] So I showed you the pictures. So now you
[45:11] can put up the scripture. So they so
[45:13] shall they that fear the name of the
[45:15] Lord from the west and his glory from
[45:18] the rising of the sun. When the enemy
[45:20] shall come in like a flood, the spear of
[45:22] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[45:25] against him. So see, I was thinking like
[45:28] what verse is there for the invasion?
[45:30] The enemy comes in like a flood. Now
[45:32] church, did God know the enemy or was
[45:33] God surprised by the enemy coming in? Of
[45:35] course not. God allowed the enemy to
[45:37] come in. But he doesn't stop there. He
[45:40] even though he allows him to come in, he
[45:41] says, "Oh, I'm gonna raise up a flag.
[45:43] I'm gonna raise up a standard." Remember
[45:44] when I preached on a couple years ago,
[45:46] the standard was a flag, a rallying
[45:48] place away from the flood, a place of
[45:51] safety. If God allows the flood to come
[45:53] in, we're going to have a place where we
[45:55] can gather together. Hallelujah.
[45:58] We're going to have a safe place where
[46:00] you'll see Brother uh Col, Brother
[46:02] Patrick. You'll see them waving the flag
[46:03] at the banner of Jesus Christ. Come over
[46:06] here, brothers. Come over here. The
[46:07] enemy is coming in, but we've got a
[46:09] higher ground. Amen. We've got a safe
[46:11] place. Amen. Our feet are on the solid
[46:13] rock. Hallelujah. Amen.
[46:18] God knows the flood's coming in. So God
[46:21] raises up somebody to hold a flag and
[46:23] wave a flag out there to say, "Hey, come
[46:25] rally with us. We've got a safe place."
[46:27] You don't have to drown in this world.
[46:29] And the church said, "Amen." You don't
[46:31] have to become drunken with the things
[46:32] of the world. You don't have to be
[46:33] carried away and washed away by the
[46:35] things of the world. You can have a safe
[46:37] place where your feet are on solid
[46:39] ground. You can keep the words of God.
[46:41] Jesus said that's what the rock is. It's
[46:43] a place where people obey the word of
[46:45] God. Amen.
[46:49] That was uh Matthew 7. Let's read it
[46:52] because it Simon was inspired by that
[46:53] from the wedding. Remember
[46:57] that? Sam
[46:59] Jr. Hallelujah. Matthew
[47:01] 7. That was one of his main verses
[47:04] there. Uncle Paul read it, too.
[47:07] Hallelujah. Verse 24. 7:24. Therefore,
[47:10] whosoever he hearth these sayings of
[47:11] mine and doeth them, I will liken him
[47:13] unto a wise man which builds his house
[47:16] upon a rock. So, we just can't say it.
[47:18] We got to do it. Praise God. If you do
[47:22] it, now you're standing on a rock. If
[47:24] you pray, if you read your Bible, if you
[47:26] forgive others, if you repent of your
[47:28] sins, then there you are. You're on the
[47:30] rock, Brother Jose, waving that flag,
[47:32] saying, "Praise God. We've got a safety
[47:35] spot. We can we can live high above the
[47:37] flood because God's given us a rock to
[47:39] stand on." Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to
[47:42] God.
[47:44] Amen. In other words, we don't have to
[47:46] turn out like those poor
[47:49] nurses. And they take Wonder if they
[47:51] take a picture of us in 2025. If I took
[47:53] a picture, I wonder if I come
[47:55] back in 10 years what everybody would
[47:57] look like. Our brother's going to be
[47:59] coming in here with shorts
[48:00] on. Our sisters going to be wearing
[48:03] makeup in
[48:05] here. Brothers going to be with their
[48:07] shirts showing off their chests. You
[48:08] know how they, you know, they button
[48:09] down their shirts like a bunch of
[48:11] heathens. Is that how we're going to
[48:13] look? What's our What's our timeline?
[48:15] Amen. Glory. I believe our timeline will
[48:18] look the same yesterday, today, and
[48:20] forever because we serve Jesus Christ
[48:22] who's the same yesterday, today, and
[48:24] forever. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:28] I need to pull up our reunion, our
[48:30] anniversary pictures. I look about the
[48:32] same, just more gray hair. I look the
[48:33] same as I did when we started 19 years
[48:36] ago. Pastor Jesse, he's got a little
[48:39] more white there, Brother Jose. Wish I
[48:41] did. I saw it the other day. I'm like,
[48:42] man, you're getting white,
[48:44] bro. H, what can I do? I can't stop it.
[48:47] I can just I can just embrace it. Right,
[48:49] Brother Jose? Just embrace
[48:51] it. No, but we should look as time goes
[48:54] on, we should look the same. In other
[48:56] words, our standards don't change. We're
[48:59] not getting washed away in the flood of
[49:01] sin and immorality. We're standing on a
[49:04] solid place. The floods don't affect us
[49:07] because we live above the flood. And the
[49:10] verse for that is Luke
[49:13] 17:26. So, got your Bible, pull up on
[49:15] Luke 17:26. As it was the days of Noah,
[49:18] I thought this was a good thought. I
[49:19] found it from a commentator. So shall be
[49:22] in the days of the son of man. Now, what
[49:23] happened in the days of Noah? There was
[49:24] a flood.
[49:26] And Jesus says just like it flooded in
[49:28] Noah's day, it's going to flood in this
[49:30] day. And he ain't talking about water.
[49:33] Hallelujah. He's talking about the flood
[49:35] of the war. The flood's also another
[49:38] word for war. They're going to the the
[49:39] the the beast is going to fight against
[49:41] God and his people. It's it's in the
[49:44] book of Revelation chapter 12. The
[49:46] flood's going to come upon. Remember the
[49:48] flood tries to drown the woman. The
[49:49] woman is Israel. That just means the
[49:51] war, the the b the the the Armageddon,
[49:54] all those uh tanks and the armies are
[49:56] going to come against Israel. And that's
[49:58] likened to a flood.
[50:01] But what's our flood? Next verse 27.
[50:04] We're not Israel. So what's our flood?
[50:06] Here's our
[50:07] flood. They didn't eat. They drank. They
[50:11] married wives. They were given in
[50:13] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[50:15] the ark. And the flood came and
[50:17] destroyed them all. So what's the flood?
[50:20] Oh, just the cares of life. Does that
[50:21] sound
[50:22] familiar? Jesus talked about the cares
[50:24] of life that choke out the seed of the
[50:27] word. See, they got their eyes off the
[50:30] word and this oh this they give
[50:32] themselves fully over the these things
[50:34] become the best part of life rather than
[50:36] it's just it's something we do. The most
[50:39] important part is church, loving God,
[50:41] loving God's people. Hallelujah. Amen.
[50:43] The most important part. See, people
[50:45] will miss church for you know marriages
[50:47] and all these things. uh you know uh
[50:50] entertainment, sports, they'll miss
[50:52] church for all these things, but it's a
[50:55] flood. It's a it's a it's a flood of
[50:57] pressure and care. People I got to take
[51:01] care of this. Well, be careful how many
[51:02] times you got to take care of that,
[51:05] right? It's a flood. It's going to
[51:06] overtake you and you've got to find a
[51:09] higher place than that. You got to stand
[51:11] on the rock of the word of God.
[51:12] Hallelujah.
[51:15] In fact, verse 25 of Matthew 7. And the
[51:19] rain descended, and the floods came, and
[51:20] the winds blew, and beat upon that
[51:22] house, and it fell not, for it was
[51:23] founded upon a
[51:26] rock. And everyone that heareth these
[51:28] sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
[51:30] shall be likened unto a foolish man,
[51:32] which build his house upon the sand. And
[51:34] the rain descended, the floods came, and
[51:36] the winds blew, and beat upon that
[51:38] house, and it fell, and great was the
[51:40] fall of it. Preachers, we see them all
[51:42] these last years. They fall by women,
[51:44] money, popularity. The floods of all
[51:47] these temptations came in and they're
[51:50] falling. Brother said they're dropping
[51:51] like flies, he says. And that's the
[51:54] truth. They're dropping like flies.
[51:56] Well, how can we stand? Because we're
[51:58] not we're not being swept away. We're
[52:00] not even playing around with the flood.
[52:02] We're standing on the rock of ages.
[52:04] Hallelujah. And here I am, brother Nia.
[52:06] I'm just waving this flag saying, "Come
[52:07] on, people. Come rally around the word
[52:09] of God. Don't get swept away by the
[52:11] flood of pleasures. Come stand with us.
[52:14] We're standing with Jesus Christ.
[52:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[52:18] Amen. That's
[52:23] right. It's a flood of immorality that
[52:26] the bride will go through. It's not
[52:28] necessarily a war. The war is going to
[52:30] be Armageddon. That's the World War II,
[52:32] we'd say.
[52:34] But it's all the all the pleasures of
[52:36] this life, the false prophecies, the
[52:40] heresies, all these lies in other
[52:43] churches we've got to keep out of our
[52:45] lives. Remember the flood of trouble
[52:47] came upon Job. He lost all his money,
[52:49] his children. He lost his health. That
[52:51] flood came in. But what did he do? He
[52:54] found a place to stand. He said, "I know
[52:57] God's a redeemer. Amen. I know I'll see
[53:00] God. I'll stand with God on the earth at
[53:02] the end time. In my flesh, I shall see
[53:04] God because I know my redeemer lives.
[53:08] He found a rallying place. We can rally
[53:10] around that.
[53:14] Hallelujah. When Satan came against
[53:16] Jesus and the flood came in, not just
[53:18] not just a demon, but the chief of
[53:20] demons, Beelzebub, Satan, what did Jesus
[53:23] defeat him with? It is written.
[53:25] Now, when was the last time you told
[53:27] your temptation? It is written. You need
[53:29] to do that today. I need to do that
[53:31] today. We all need to do that today.
[53:34] That's how you come. That's you speak to
[53:36] the storm. Praise God. Just like Jesus
[53:39] speak to the storm. It's got to move.
[53:41] Hallelujah. Amen. If Jesus overcame the
[53:44] flood of Satan's powers by just speaking
[53:46] the word and standing on the word, we
[53:49] can do the same. Hallelujah.
[53:51] That's right, church. That's
[53:53] right. Now, church, let me just share a
[53:55] few personal thoughts. When I wrote that
[53:57] 2021 book, I thought the rapture was
[53:59] coming very soon because if you read in
[54:02] there, I wrote about cancel culture.
[54:04] Remember cancel culture? They started by
[54:06] canceling President Trump off Facebook.
[54:07] That's what started. And then I got off
[54:08] Facebook. That was 2021. I thought, "Oh,
[54:11] here it is. Here's the end." So, what
[54:13] did I do? I started my own website and
[54:14] now I don't even have it updated because
[54:17] I thought they're going to cancel me on
[54:18] YouTube. I thought cancer culture was
[54:19] coming for
[54:20] me. And look at it now. Now, it's to now
[54:23] they let Trump back on there.
[54:27] But see, we're seeing the culture shift
[54:29] again, right? President Trump has now
[54:32] outlawed the transgender me boys playing
[54:34] the girls sports. It's outlawed by ex
[54:37] executive order. And a lot of people are
[54:39] leaving the woke insanity. All these
[54:41] woke movies like Snow White, they're
[54:42] failing at the box office. And there's
[54:45] been a few Christian movies that have
[54:46] got like that uh animated Jesus movie
[54:48] for Easter that did way better than The
[54:50] Snow White. There's a shift. Now, I'm
[54:54] not saying they're going to get revived,
[54:55] but they're just shifting back to
[54:56] lukewarm is what they're
[54:58] doing, right? It was going so
[55:00] far, but now it's swinging back a little
[55:03] bit. So, it seems like,
[55:06] church, that we're having this pendulum
[55:08] swing back. And now, though, it allows
[55:11] uh the deception to be closer to the
[55:14] truth, right? Right? Because Jesus said
[55:16] in Matthew 24:24, "It'd be so elect, I'm
[55:19] sorry, it'd be so close it deceive the
[55:21] very elect if it were possible." Put
[55:24] that up there, hun, would
[55:26] you? So now it seems we're having a
[55:29] closer to truth deception. But I, in my
[55:31] opinion, I thought, boy, I'm going to
[55:32] get canceled pretty soon. It's over.
[55:34] Squeeze is coming on. I thought all
[55:36] these
[55:36] things. Uh, Matthew
[55:40] 24:24. If it if it were possible, thank
[55:42] God for the if. If it were possible,
[55:45] they shall deceive the very elect. False
[55:49] brother says false anointed one. Christ
[55:51] means anointed. False anointed ones.
[55:54] They have the anointing, but they're
[55:56] false
[55:57] teachers. That's
[55:59] right. So, see, the the truth the truth
[56:03] uh is going to uh is always going to be
[56:05] the same, but the deception is going to
[56:07] look more like the
[56:09] truth. I'm going to close with these
[56:11] last few things. I'm going to close with
[56:12] a few quotes from uh brother Brandham.
[56:15] Now if you listen to this service
[56:16] church, I encourage you to listen to
[56:17] invis vis in invasion United States if
[56:19] you
[56:20] haven't. Brother Brandham repeatedly
[56:22] says the way to overcome this is to
[56:25] repent in prayer with
[56:28] tears with a sinc. He says it over and
[56:31] over fashion prayer.
[56:35] Now church, you know this answer, but
[56:37] when was the last time either at your
[56:38] seat or in the prayer line or here, you
[56:41] prayed with such sincerity, you were
[56:43] weeping? And I know some people it's
[56:45] easier for us to cry than others. Hey,
[56:47] it's easy for me to cry, right? I'm a
[56:50] I'm a cry
[56:52] baby. But I'm talking about when were
[56:54] you uh giving into sin and you needed to
[56:58] repent and you prayed until you cried
[57:01] and then you got the victory. That's
[57:03] what I'm talking about.
[57:05] And brother said, "This is how you stop
[57:07] the invasion." In other words, communion
[57:10] with God. And the church said, "Sound
[57:12] familiar? Like we preached on communion
[57:14] lately, Abraham and God. Communing,
[57:17] God's friend, church, you are the friend
[57:19] of
[57:20] God. I am a friend of God. He calls me
[57:23] friend, too, because I'm the seed of
[57:26] Abraham." But man said, "Today we put
[57:28] our name on the church book and go out
[57:30] and stay home and never say a word about
[57:32] it unconcerned." See, church, do we say
[57:34] enough about the sermons? Do we say
[57:35] enough about God with people? See, just
[57:39] as long as we belong to the church, it's
[57:41] all right. Brother Brandon said, "I'm
[57:42] sure we're wrong there. People check up
[57:46] for that won't stand in the in the day
[57:48] of judgment." No,
[57:51] sir. He says, "Brother," he says, these
[57:54] preachers say, "Raise up your hands. Who
[57:56] wants to accept Christ?" All like that.
[57:58] That's all right, brother, but that
[57:59] don't expel sin. He says, "See, if I
[58:02] said, "Well, how many want to get closer
[58:04] to God?" Everybody raise their hand.
[58:05] Brother Ram said, "But what does that
[58:07] do? Does that make you live different
[58:08] out there?" I mean, I hope it does, but
[58:10] if it doesn't, it's time to be more
[58:13] sincere. Brother Ram said, "You've got
[58:16] to repent first. Get right. Get down
[58:18] there and really cry out." I can
[58:21] remember the times when the oldfashioned
[58:22] people would walk down through the
[58:23] aisles, up and down the roads of crying,
[58:25] talking to their neighbors. That was
[58:27] Christians of that day telling about the
[58:29] things of the Lord.
[58:32] Hallelujah. Who is the last person you
[58:35] talked to the Lord about that wasn't a
[58:37] believer already? I'm talking about who
[58:38] wasn't a believer
[58:40] already. Hallelujah. Think about that
[58:42] just for a moment. Who's the last person
[58:44] you talked
[58:46] about? That's what we need to
[58:49] do. How how on fire are we? Are we so on
[58:52] fire that we want to talk to other
[58:53] people about it?
[58:56] Have we lost our sincerity? Praise God.
[58:59] What am I talking about? The invasion of
[59:00] the United
[59:01] States. Brother Ram said uh Paul Rivere
[59:04] would would in the in the revolution
[59:06] would say the British are coming.
[59:07] Remember he wrote around and said the
[59:09] British are coming. Brit brother Ram
[59:10] said we can't do that because the
[59:11] British are already here. Satan's
[59:14] already here. Right? The invasion's not
[59:16] coming. The invasion is here. And
[59:19] brother said, "I say by the spirit of
[59:21] Christ, we've got to keep it out of our
[59:23] homes.
[59:25] Keep it out of He said, "Keep it away
[59:26] from you men. Be real men. Be real
[59:28] women. Keep it away from your children.
[59:30] The invasion's already here. We got to
[59:32] drive it out." Praise
[59:34] God. That's the first quote. Now, look
[59:37] what here. Look what
[59:39] uh look at this thought. Brother Ram
[59:41] said uh he noticed too in
[59:47] 1954. Let me put that picture back up
[59:49] here again.
[59:54] One of the signs, look at one of the
[59:57] signs. One of the signs, Brother Ram
[59:59] said, the invasion was on because look
[1:00:01] what he said the church people would
[1:00:04] say. He said, I think of
[1:00:07] evangelism. They put it in big great
[1:00:10] lights. And when you see the evangelist
[1:00:12] coming to town, you wonder I he said,
[1:00:16] "My meetings have been guilty." The
[1:00:17] same. Look at this. Brother Ram said,
[1:00:19] "All of us promoters of our meetings are
[1:00:21] all guilty of doing this." Now, look,
[1:00:23] look how humble brother Rand is. Brother
[1:00:26] Ram saying, "My campaign is guilty." And
[1:00:28] the church said, "Let me read you the
[1:00:30] exact words for all you tape worshippers
[1:00:32] out there that are trying to accuse me."
[1:00:34] Let me get you the exact words so you
[1:00:35] get it. I my meetings has been guilty of
[1:00:39] the same. Type it
[1:00:42] in. Brother saying he his campaign is
[1:00:45] guilty of doing what, brother Jess.
[1:00:47] That's right. I wonder No, he says, "Uh,
[1:00:50] yeah, that's right. I wonder who's
[1:00:52] coming to town sometimes, the
[1:00:54] evangelist or Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ." I went to a place not long ago
[1:01:01] where a certain evangelist was supposed
[1:01:03] to come. Why? They had the picture of
[1:01:05] the evangelist, the man of the hour, the
[1:01:07] man's with this, the man's with that.
[1:01:09] And brother said down in the corner,
[1:01:11] they had Jesus Christ, the same
[1:01:13] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:01:17] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said his
[1:01:19] campaign was guilty of that. Big
[1:01:21] picture, brother Brandham. Small words
[1:01:23] about Jesus Christ. Now, come on,
[1:01:25] church. And the church said,
[1:01:27] what's our emphasis more
[1:01:30] on? Is it on, oh, I can't wait till
[1:01:32] brother Dennis comes back or brother
[1:01:34] Digs comes back so I can be revived? Why
[1:01:36] can't you be revived right now?
[1:01:38] And I'm not talking about putting my
[1:01:39] picture up there. I'm just saying let's
[1:01:41] let's Jesus should be our focus. We get
[1:01:42] only strength from Jesus. Praise God.
[1:01:45] I'm talking about what this this
[1:01:47] generation was already putting too much
[1:01:48] emphasis on the guest preacher.
[1:01:52] I don't got a guest preacher coming I
[1:01:53] think till maybe early June. I know
[1:01:55] brother Dix is coming in July. But if
[1:01:57] you're waiting till then to get revived,
[1:01:58] you're missing the whole thing. Jesus is
[1:02:00] alive today. Praise God. I thank God
[1:02:03] when the evangelist comes to town, but
[1:02:05] brother said even in his day, it was too
[1:02:07] much on evangelist and not on the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost. Praise God. Amen. He said, "My,"
[1:02:12] He said, "my campaign's guilty of the
[1:02:17] same." Brother Ram said, "Sometimes I
[1:02:20] think I get in my hotel room and say,
[1:02:23] God, who's the people coming to see me
[1:02:26] or
[1:02:28] you?"
[1:02:32] Hallelujah. If they're coming to see me,
[1:02:35] they're lost yet. Brother Brandham says
[1:02:37] from this sermon, that's why I love this
[1:02:38] sermon invasion. Brother's so honest.
[1:02:42] Who are they coming to see? Brother
[1:02:43] Brandham or Jesus Christ? Brother
[1:02:45] Brandham said, "If you're coming to see
[1:02:46] me, you're
[1:02:47] lost." That's why for all these years, I
[1:02:50] haven't put up that pillar fire picture.
[1:02:51] Maybe I will someday, but I never wanted
[1:02:53] the people I never wanted our church to
[1:02:55] worship brother Bram or or get any any
[1:02:58] extra devotion or anything to brother
[1:03:00] Bram. I want our devotion to be truly on
[1:03:02] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And I know
[1:03:05] in Brother Ramon's church, of course,
[1:03:06] Brother Bam passed away. But I know
[1:03:08] right now they worship the tapes and
[1:03:10] they got that picture right up there
[1:03:11] right next to Jesus. It's idolatry for a
[1:03:14] lot of people. Not for everybody, but
[1:03:16] for some people it's
[1:03:18] idolatry. You can't tell nothing. The
[1:03:20] tapes is the absolute and press play and
[1:03:22] obey all these lies that they
[1:03:24] got. But I want you to see the enemy was
[1:03:27] coming in like that. Just even in our
[1:03:30] advertising, even in our advertising of
[1:03:33] our meetings, what's our emphasis? Is it
[1:03:35] the man or is it Jesus?
[1:03:38] There's my hour. Boy, that was that
[1:03:40] seemed like it was short. Praise God.
[1:03:43] I'm not going to go too long though. I
[1:03:44] am. I'm
[1:03:45] not. Brother Abraham said, "Oh God, if
[1:03:49] they're coming to see me, they're lost.
[1:03:50] Oh God, tear me down and take me away.
[1:03:54] I want to represent you. The one who
[1:03:58] will stand before I will stand before
[1:04:00] someday with trembling hands and
[1:04:01] trembling feeble body looking at me
[1:04:03] knowing that my whole my my soul hangs
[1:04:06] on your decision. He said let us exalt
[1:04:09] Christ. Now church we get these
[1:04:11] invitations from message churches.
[1:04:13] Special meetings. Special meetings.
[1:04:15] You've seen them. You've seen them.
[1:04:18] Who's the biggest picture of Jesus or
[1:04:20] the guest preachers? Always the guest
[1:04:23] preachers. And I'm not trying to I'm not
[1:04:25] trying to criticize that. I love these
[1:04:26] guest preachers and they God speaks to
[1:04:28] them, right? But just this idea who's
[1:04:30] the focus really
[1:04:33] on when the invasion when Satan comes in
[1:04:36] invasion, he's trying to get the focus
[1:04:38] any way he can off of Jesus Christ and
[1:04:40] put it on a man, a woman, gift,
[1:04:43] whatever.
[1:04:47] And church, that's why I want you to
[1:04:48] pray too now before service. Because if
[1:04:50] you didn't pray in the morning, when you
[1:04:51] come here, you're not going to help us
[1:04:52] out. You're not you're not going to help
[1:04:54] the spirit of God move if you're not
[1:04:55] praying in the morning.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. And prayer is just you and
[1:05:00] God. So it it it when we pray, it should
[1:05:03] show us what's our what's our
[1:05:04] relationship with God. Have we talked to
[1:05:05] him? Has it been a while since we talked
[1:05:06] to him? Are we able to pray like we
[1:05:09] really want to? Why not? Why haven't we
[1:05:11] talked to him lately? We need to talk to
[1:05:13] God more. Praise the
[1:05:16] Lord. Invasion of the United
[1:05:20] States.
[1:05:24] Couple more quotes here. Brother Ram
[1:05:27] said, "Let this nation come to tears,
[1:05:30] not to come to laughter and drama." And
[1:05:32] brother Ram talks about preachers that
[1:05:34] tell jokes at the pulpit. That's how
[1:05:35] Joel Olstein starts every sermon. Have
[1:05:36] you seen it? He says, "I always start I
[1:05:39] like to start with something funny. He
[1:05:40] tells a joke and then everybody laughs
[1:05:42] and he goes back to preaching. I like
[1:05:44] I'd like to I'd like to make a video
[1:05:46] with Brother Man's voice on there and
[1:05:48] then Joe Ostein telling a joke. Because
[1:05:51] that's what people do. They want to hear
[1:05:52] jokes. They don't want to hear the
[1:05:54] gospel truth. Brother Ram said this.
[1:05:56] Just bear with me with this
[1:05:57] illustration. Brother Ram said the
[1:05:59] gospel is like boxers. And he said with
[1:06:02] with the the real gospel, you take the
[1:06:04] gloves off. And he says it's bare
[1:06:06] knuckle
[1:06:08] punching. Now I I don't want you to get
[1:06:10] the wrong
[1:06:11] idea, but I want you to see if you put
[1:06:14] the boxing gloves on, it doesn't hurt as
[1:06:16] bad. In other words, brother said that's
[1:06:18] what preachers are doing today. They
[1:06:19] won't tell you uh it's it's wrong to
[1:06:21] cuss. They won't tell you it's wrong to
[1:06:23] look at those dirty things and they they
[1:06:25] won't tell you when you're in adultery.
[1:06:26] They won't tell you it's adultery. He
[1:06:28] said they got punching gloves on. But
[1:06:29] Ram said, "But the gospel takes them
[1:06:31] off."
[1:06:32] In other words, you're going to get a
[1:06:33] real real conviction. And the church
[1:06:35] said, "I'm not talking about beating
[1:06:37] anybody or hitting anybody. I don't do
[1:06:39] that. I never would do that. I don't do
[1:06:41] that." I'm talking about tell me the
[1:06:42] truth no matter how much it hurts.
[1:06:44] Praise God. Tell me what the Bible says,
[1:06:47] no matter how much it hurts.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah. Tell them about the holiness
[1:06:53] like Rod and I are tell them about the
[1:06:55] the hair. Tell them about the no women
[1:06:57] preachers. Tell them about that. Tell
[1:06:58] them about the Roman Catholic Church and
[1:07:00] the Protestants uniting as an image in
[1:07:02] the beast. Tell them about that. That's
[1:07:03] barefisted gospel
[1:07:07] preaching. I know you're getting tired.
[1:07:09] Bear with me. I'm almost done. I'm not
[1:07:10] I'm actually starting to warm up here by
[1:07:12] God's grace. So that's just how it is.
[1:07:13] That's how it is. It's all good.
[1:07:15] Hallelujah.
[1:07:17] He said, "Let this nation come to its
[1:07:19] knees in repentance." That's what we
[1:07:21] need. Not a revival to get the whole lot
[1:07:22] out of people in church. We need to
[1:07:24] close every bootleg joint, stop all the
[1:07:26] cigarette smoking, tear down the
[1:07:27] factories, start up a real oldfashioned
[1:07:30] Holy Ghost campaign where men and women,
[1:07:32] day and night, lay on their face crying.
[1:07:34] I'll tell you, it'll be the greatest
[1:07:36] shelter that this nation's ever had.
[1:07:38] That's
[1:07:40] true. Glory. Amen.
[1:07:47] Abraham said, ' Don't be afraid of the
[1:07:49] of Russia. Russ Russia's got nothing to
[1:07:51] do with it. He says, "We're doing it to
[1:07:53] ourselves. Our own rottness right among
[1:07:56] us has allowed the invasion to come in."
[1:07:59] People worried about Iran. People
[1:08:00] worried about uh uh North Korea, Russia.
[1:08:04] Brother said, "It's our own sin that's
[1:08:05] going to do
[1:08:07] it because Satan has invaded."
[1:08:13] All right, couple more
[1:08:17] here. Brother Ram said there's only one
[1:08:20] thing that can get the world out of
[1:08:22] them. That's the
[1:08:24] altar before Jesus Christ. This like the
[1:08:27] third time he says this. An
[1:08:29] old-fashioned tear streaming religion
[1:08:32] that'll break their hearts and tear them
[1:08:35] to pieces and make them what they ought
[1:08:38] to be. That's right.
[1:08:42] So, if you're still struggling with sin
[1:08:44] today, you have any sins you're
[1:08:45] struggling with, you need to lay at the
[1:08:47] altar or at your seat and cry until
[1:08:51] you're so ashamed of it that you know
[1:08:53] you're not going to do it again.
[1:08:55] Hallelujah. Praise God. That's what you
[1:08:58] need. I could pray for you all day,
[1:08:59] brother. I said the preacher can pour
[1:09:01] five gallons of oil on you. I wish I had
[1:09:03] a gallon container as a visual. I've
[1:09:06] only got
[1:09:08] this 16 fluid ounces. I wish I knew how
[1:09:10] many ounces in a gallon, but I could
[1:09:12] pour all this oil on you and church,
[1:09:15] it's not going to help you until you
[1:09:17] hate sin, until you love righteousness.
[1:09:19] And the church said, "Amen." Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] It ain't going to help no matter how
[1:09:23] much I pray or anybody else prays. Amen.
[1:09:27] I'm just talking about me because I'm
[1:09:28] I'm the one here that's here today.
[1:09:29] Praise God.
[1:09:32] See, it's this oldfashioned tear
[1:09:33] streaming religion that'll break your
[1:09:36] heart and tear it to pieces and make you
[1:09:40] what you ought to be. He said, "You may
[1:09:42] think I'm an old
[1:09:44] fogy." But he says, "But the day when
[1:09:47] you're dying, brother, sister, you'll
[1:09:48] realize that I told you the truth. She's
[1:09:51] on. The invasion is on. The hour is
[1:09:53] here. Yes, an hour of decision, too. an
[1:09:55] hour of decision not to come to church,
[1:09:57] but an hour of decision whether you're
[1:09:59] going to serve Christ or stay lukewarm
[1:10:01] in your church. And the church said, "Oh
[1:10:04] my, the decision is whether you're going
[1:10:07] to come to church or not. The decision
[1:10:08] is whether you're going to stay on fire
[1:10:10] or you're going to stay lukewarm for
[1:10:12] Christ." That's the
[1:10:14] decision. Almost everybody here, you
[1:10:16] everybody here has already been to
[1:10:17] church before. But who's on fire? That
[1:10:21] that's that's what we need to know.
[1:10:23] Who's on fire? Who's getting victory
[1:10:25] over the enemy?
[1:10:27] Hallelujah. That's some barefisted
[1:10:29] preaching right there. I don't got any
[1:10:31] gloves on today.
[1:10:33] Hallelujah. You got sin, confess your
[1:10:36] sin. Cry about your sin. And watch.
[1:10:39] Brother Ram said, "It'll expel sin.
[1:10:41] It'll delete the sin." Right? The Holy
[1:10:44] Spirit will take the sin out.
[1:10:45] Hallelujah. And you won't want to do it
[1:10:48] again. That's
[1:10:50] right. And then he says it again. He
[1:10:52] persuades
[1:10:54] them to repent with tears streaming down
[1:10:58] your faces. This is the fourth time he
[1:11:00] said this. And this is the way to defeat
[1:11:03] uh the invasion United States is with
[1:11:05] tears. I wonder how many of these women
[1:11:06] at least they got skirts on. And look,
[1:11:08] look how long they are. My goodness.
[1:11:10] This one that's a really No, she's
[1:11:11] holding a coat there. I was like, that's
[1:11:12] a really long skirt. Oh, but she does.
[1:11:14] Yeah, there's one, right? No, that might
[1:11:15] be the coat, too. Look, look at this.
[1:11:18] It's almost down to the
[1:11:19] ankles. That'd be a shame. a lot of
[1:11:21] message churches and the church said
[1:11:24] that's so much longer than most message
[1:11:27] churches. Not that that makes anybody
[1:11:29] holier whether it's that or you know a
[1:11:31] few inches but the point of uh the point
[1:11:33] of staying on fire for God making sure
[1:11:36] your life matches the gospel of Jesus
[1:11:38] Christ.
[1:11:43] Church brother tells one more confession
[1:11:46] at the end of this service. Okay, one
[1:11:48] more. So, he's already done one
[1:11:50] confession, and I'm going to close with
[1:11:51] this because I want you to think about
[1:11:53] anything you need to confess to God. Not
[1:11:55] to me, to God. I'm not going to turn
[1:11:58] into a Roman Catholic. Okay, confess all
[1:12:00] your sins to me. Tell me what you're
[1:12:01] doing here. I don't want to know. You
[1:12:04] wouldn't want to know my struggles,
[1:12:05] right? Well, just one more confession.
[1:12:08] The first confession is he said, "My
[1:12:10] campaign is guilty of putting my picture
[1:12:12] real big and putting Jesus Christ real
[1:12:15] small."
[1:12:17] You might think that's a small thing,
[1:12:18] but brother Ram says we're guilty of
[1:12:23] it. Brother Ram's praying. He said, "Oh,
[1:12:25] Father, with while the great darkness is
[1:12:28] on the battle and the devil invading the
[1:12:31] cries and invading the pulpits." See, I
[1:12:33] got to keep the devil out of this
[1:12:35] pulpit. You've got to keep him out of
[1:12:37] your house. So do I. But I've also got
[1:12:40] to keep him out of this pulpit.
[1:12:42] He's trying to invade this
[1:12:44] pulpit,
[1:12:46] right? The devil invading the pulpits.
[1:12:48] Invading the churches. I got to make
[1:12:50] sure you don't invade the
[1:12:51] church. Invading the peoples, invading
[1:12:54] the businesses, invading the cities and
[1:12:55] the schools and the homes. Oh God, help
[1:12:57] us to stand. Pull the sword quickly and
[1:13:00] fight for God. What does God want you to
[1:13:01] do? Fight with the
[1:13:04] word as Moses and the Levites did down
[1:13:07] there when they were in the
[1:13:09] camp. Uh help us Lord, forgive us now
[1:13:14] and bless us and keep us humble. Notice
[1:13:17] these words. Break us up, oh Lord. Oh
[1:13:20] God, you said he that goes forth sewing
[1:13:23] in tears will doubtless return again
[1:13:25] rejoicing, bringing with him sheav.
[1:13:27] That's a good
[1:13:29] scripture. Would you pull that up there?
[1:13:31] U sewing in tears. Let
[1:13:35] me There you go.
[1:13:44] So
[1:13:45] tears, get your Bibles out. If you got a
[1:13:47] Bible, get out, please. I want you to
[1:13:48] see this because this is your promise.
[1:13:50] Uh Psalm 126, verses 45, five, and six.
[1:13:53] And I'm I'm going to read this and I'll
[1:13:54] read a quote and then we'll be done by
[1:13:56] God's grace. But I hope you're not done.
[1:13:57] If you have things to confess before
[1:13:59] God, confess
[1:14:01] them. Brother Ram confessed his campaign
[1:14:04] was off. Too much emphasis on a man.
[1:14:07] He's going to show his ne next next
[1:14:08] confession with this. But here's a
[1:14:10] scripture that if you really want to get
[1:14:12] victory over any sin, I want you to say
[1:14:15] that out loud. Say any sin. Ready? Any
[1:14:17] sin. Any sin. If you want victory over
[1:14:19] any sin, here's what you do. Captivity.
[1:14:21] This is the Israel had natural
[1:14:23] captivity, but we battle spiritual
[1:14:25] captivity. Turn again our captivity, O
[1:14:28] Lord, as the streams in the south. They
[1:14:30] that sew or plant tears. Your tears are
[1:14:32] like seeds of victory. Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:14:37] Tears are like seeds of victory. Oh God,
[1:14:40] I want to be free. Oh God, I don't want
[1:14:42] to give into this anymore. Oh God, I
[1:14:44] want to overcome sin. I want to be
[1:14:45] different. When you cry and those tears
[1:14:47] fall, it's like planting spiritual
[1:14:49] seeds. And you know God's going to water
[1:14:51] that seed. Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:14:55] If you plant in tears, you shall reap in
[1:14:58] joy. So someday God will give you the
[1:15:00] victory. Maybe today. Amen. Today could
[1:15:02] be the day God gives you victory and you
[1:15:04] get the joy of the Lord. Oh, I won't do
[1:15:06] that again. God's given me the victory.
[1:15:08] I'm free in Christ. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:10] Satan's not going to invade my life.
[1:15:14] He that goeth forth with weeping and
[1:15:16] weepeth, bearing precious seeds. See,
[1:15:18] those are precious seeds. Shall
[1:15:20] doubtless come again with rejoicing,
[1:15:23] bringing his sheets with him. So, why
[1:15:24] why aren't men, remember I preaching
[1:15:26] this, why aren't men rejoicing in
[1:15:27] church? Because a lot of them are
[1:15:28] addicted to
[1:15:29] porn. Why aren't women uh rejoicing in
[1:15:32] church? I don't know. Maybe they're
[1:15:33] addicted to grief or sorrow or
[1:15:35] something. I don't know. Uh maybe money
[1:15:37] and and uh I don't know. Who
[1:15:41] knows? But you know, I'm just these
[1:15:43] general things. In other words, we
[1:15:45] should all be rejoicing. We should all
[1:15:47] be free. We should be praying and and
[1:15:49] crying. We should be crying for the
[1:15:50] abomination done the city. This is how
[1:15:53] you get victory. You give God your
[1:15:54] heart. You say, "God, break me down.
[1:15:56] Mold me up. Make me a new creature."
[1:15:58] Praise God.
[1:16:01] Now look at that word. Oh yeah, look at
[1:16:02] that word. Verse
[1:16:05] six. Everybody say doubtless. Ready? So
[1:16:08] without a doubt, if you cry out to God
[1:16:10] with tears, God will hear you. If you
[1:16:14] really want
[1:16:15] victory, God will give it to you. No
[1:16:18] doubt. There's no doubt about it. God
[1:16:20] will give you the victory if you plant
[1:16:21] those se those tears, those seeds of
[1:16:24] victory. Hallelujah. All right. Now, I'm
[1:16:28] closing. What's the last thing Brother
[1:16:30] says? Yeah, he quotes that. Oh God,
[1:16:32] break us to pieces. Mold us a new Lord.
[1:16:34] We're getting too much out of the way.
[1:16:35] Now look what he says. Here's the second
[1:16:37] confession. I am myself, Lord. What?
[1:16:40] What? Brother Ram's getting out of the
[1:16:41] way. What? I can't wait to read this
[1:16:43] next part. Brother Claude, Brother
[1:16:45] Patrick, how is Brother Ram getting out
[1:16:47] of the way of
[1:16:49] God? Anybody want to
[1:16:56] know? He says, "I'm getting to a place
[1:16:58] where I'm thinking about how many will
[1:17:01] attend my meeting, oh
[1:17:04] God." Brother Ram said, "I'm leaving uh
[1:17:08] I'm I've left this the sincerity that I
[1:17:11] I should have because I'm worried
[1:17:13] wondering about I wonder how many going
[1:17:14] to attend my meeting." You know, the
[1:17:15] same thing's true for us if we're
[1:17:16] worried about how many views are we
[1:17:17] going to get on YouTube,
[1:17:20] how much tithes and offerings are going
[1:17:22] to come in today. Those are all things
[1:17:24] we can worry about, right?
[1:17:27] And as soon as we start worrying about
[1:17:28] those things, brother Ram says we're out
[1:17:30] of the way.
[1:17:33] We've left the path of God. We're
[1:17:35] worrying about cares of the world rather
[1:17:38] than the gospel of Jesus
[1:17:40] Christ. Praise God. I've had so many
[1:17:42] people over the years come in here and
[1:17:44] say, "Brother Jesse, you preach you
[1:17:46] preach so loud with so much." No, I
[1:17:47] don't. Loudness is loudness is not a
[1:17:49] sign that I'm right with God, but they
[1:17:51] say, "You preach with so much zeal to 20
[1:17:54] people." and they say, 'We appreciate
[1:17:56] that. It proves you're not you don't
[1:17:57] care about the number and I don't care
[1:17:59] about the number of people, but I do
[1:18:01] want you to come to church. I care about
[1:18:02] your soul. Praise God. In other words, I
[1:18:04] don't care how many people here. I'm
[1:18:05] going to preach what God puts on my
[1:18:07] heart to
[1:18:09] preach. And I don't want to get out of
[1:18:11] the way and start worrying about the
[1:18:13] number of views, money, any other care
[1:18:17] of the
[1:18:20] world. Tell us, Brother Bram, how are
[1:18:22] you getting out of the way? I'm thinking
[1:18:24] about how many will attend my meeting.
[1:18:26] Oh God, I want you to
[1:18:28] attend. Oh, I love that. Amen. Oh God, I
[1:18:31] don't care who attends as long as Jesus
[1:18:33] attends.
[1:18:35] Hallelujah. Oh, I love it. Thank you,
[1:18:37] Lord. I want you to attend. Come, Lord.
[1:18:40] Oh Christ, come, Lord. Break me up. Mold
[1:18:43] me. Oh Lord, don't never let me get
[1:18:44] those things on my mind. God, keep them
[1:18:47] from me. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:18:49] Church, what's coming on your mind that
[1:18:51] somehow gets you out of the way?
[1:18:53] musicians can
[1:18:55] come. Is there anything that pulls you
[1:18:58] away from your sincerity? How many of
[1:19:00] this? How much of that? What's our
[1:19:03] emphasis on? We only get excited about
[1:19:05] God when this happens. What has pulled
[1:19:07] us out of the
[1:19:09] way? If if something's pull us out of
[1:19:11] the way and invasion has
[1:19:13] happened, our sincerity's been invaded
[1:19:16] and attacked and we've lost our
[1:19:18] sincerity. Brother man said, "Pull out
[1:19:19] the sword and fight with the word of
[1:19:21] God.
[1:19:22] Let's bow our
[1:19:28] heads. Dear God in heaven, Lord, we
[1:19:31] thank you for this message your prophet
[1:19:32] preached 71 years ago. God, we can see
[1:19:34] it. It's such a reality when the enemy
[1:19:37] comes in like a flood. Lord, we battle
[1:19:39] Satan almost daily as he tries to come
[1:19:42] in with distractions and cares of the
[1:19:45] world where we think about things we
[1:19:47] shouldn't think about, Lord God.
[1:19:50] And as brother Brandham said, we get out
[1:19:52] of the way. In other words, we lose a
[1:19:53] little bit of
[1:19:55] sincerity. Our focus gets on the wrong
[1:19:57] thing. And brother Dennis preached that
[1:19:58] to us. Satisfaction and
[1:20:02] focus. Lord God, we love this word. This
[1:20:05] word has life today. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:20:07] God. Lord, we want a barefisted gospel
[1:20:10] message, Lord, to convict us on all the
[1:20:13] right things. Lord God, we don't want a
[1:20:15] soft, watered down
[1:20:17] sermon. Lord, let your spirit now deal
[1:20:20] with each and every heart, Lord
[1:20:23] God. Lord, if anyone's let down their
[1:20:27] spiritual strength, Lord God, if
[1:20:28] anyone's allowed the enemy to invade, I
[1:20:30] pray, Lord, they'll do it in repentance,
[1:20:33] Lord God, with
[1:20:38] tears. Lord, I had tears up at the altar
[1:20:40] here this morning, Lord God. It's a
[1:20:43] common theme. Lord, if I can just humble
[1:20:46] myself, ask for forgiveness, Lord God,
[1:20:48] then your spirit comes on me, Lord God.
[1:20:50] I feel
[1:20:53] like, Lord, and we have that doubtless
[1:20:56] if we sew in tears, we'll come rejoicing
[1:21:00] with joy. Lord
[1:21:01] God, thank you for that scripture. Thank
[1:21:03] you for that wonderful scripture your
[1:21:05] prophet quoted. Lord God, that's what we
[1:21:07] need, Lord. broke up saints who are who
[1:21:10] care about their spiritual state, who
[1:21:12] care about whether they're getting
[1:21:14] victory or whether they're invaded. Lord
[1:21:17] God, your prophet was so honest to show
[1:21:19] us
[1:21:21] two of his personal examples where he
[1:21:24] felt like he was guilty falling short.
[1:21:27] And God, may we look at our lives today.
[1:21:29] Are we guilty, Lord God?
[1:21:35] Oh God, if we're guilty, help us to
[1:21:36] repent with tears. Lord God, we can be
[1:21:43] different. Lord, we don't want to be a
[1:21:45] lukewarm church, Lord. I don't want to
[1:21:47] be a part of a lukewarm church. None of
[1:21:48] us do, Lord God. So
[1:21:50] God, help us, Lord Jesus. Break us up,
[1:21:53] as brother Ram said, Lord God. Oh Lord,
[1:21:55] help us,
[1:21:57] Jesus. Lord, we need to pray more, Lord.
[1:21:59] We need to be closer to you, Lord Jesus.
[1:22:03] We all need more of you, Lord
[1:22:06] God. Oh God, when the enemy comes in
[1:22:09] like a flood, thank God. The spirit of
[1:22:11] God is here and he's rose up a standard
[1:22:14] against Satan. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:22:18] God. Lord, we see the spirit of Rome
[1:22:22] taking over all these aspects of
[1:22:24] society. But Lord Jesus, protect us.
[1:22:29] May it not invade our homes, Lord, our
[1:22:31] church. Lord
[1:22:33] God, help us to stand on the solid rock,
[1:22:35] waving the banner of Jesus Christ, the
[1:22:38] love of God. His banner over me is love.
