[28:34] okay yeah we're not gonna do something

[28:43] simple thought tonight just run through
[28:50] scriptures by the grace of God go to
[28:56] John 10 or we gonna scripture then we'll
[29:00] say a word of Prayer
[29:18] John 10 verse 30 John 10 verse 30 says I
[29:32] and my father are one then the Jews took
[29:37] up stones again to stone him and jesus
[29:43] answered them many good works have I
[29:45] shooed thee from my father for which of
[29:48] these works do you stone me and the Jews
[29:51] answered him saying for a good work we
[29:53] stone thee not but for blasphemy because
[29:54] thou sayest because that thou being a
[29:58] man makest thyself God so say we're a
[30:03] prayer you're the father Lord Jesus Lord
[30:08] we just love you Lord we just have a
[30:11] such a simple thought Lord this tonight
[30:13] or God this evening Lord nor me just
[30:16] break it open to God Lord me you just
[30:18] speak to your children God once again
[30:20] Lord we love you so much Lord bless all

[30:26] Lord be with each one Lord we love you
[30:28] so much we want to lift you up and
[30:30] glorify your holy name that name of
[30:33] Jesus Christ we ask these things in the
[30:36] name Jesus Christ amen my receipts
[30:49] if I had a title would probably be talk
[30:56] it well speak on the veil tonight on the
[30:58] veil in the beginning was God actually
[31:16] let me read that by the grace of God
[31:17] [Music]
[31:21] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning was God in
[31:24] the beginning sorry God created the
[31:26] heavens and the earth at this time
[31:31] Saints he was Elohim he was a deity
[31:38] everything was within him but he had no
[31:45] hiding place he was an invisible God he
[31:52] all by himself he had a plan all these
[31:58] things everything was within him but he
[32:01] was completely invisible and then God
[32:06] started to speak creation and one by one
[32:10] he created natural things he created
[32:13] spiritual things and he wanted to he
[32:18] want this main objective was to reveal
[32:20] himself we know as the Prophet taught he
[32:24] said he said once we cross over this
[32:27] side we get into the rapture we received
[32:29] that body change he's once these thing
[32:31] plate place we go into the wedding
[32:33] suppers with God and we then we go then
[32:37] we come on down in revelations 19 into
[32:39] the Millennium reign we rule and reign
[32:42] with him for a thousand years
[32:44] all day we want to fold our new bodies
[32:46] and our new flesh he says he says then
[32:49] we cross over into the world look into
[32:51] that last war there God sets the scene
[32:55] then just wipes them out he sets up the
[32:57] Great Wide judgment throne and one by
[32:59] every soul is then being judged and then
[33:01] he said he's after those things we enter
[33:04] we go right back into eternity we're
[33:07] going into a time where there is no time
[33:11] everything everything that hit that that
[33:13] masters story is now over that master
[33:17] plan is now over and and and and he
[33:20] wanted to in his whole desire was to
[33:22] have this plan right and then but as we
[33:24] go into eternity he's going to unbolt
[33:27] unfold himself and unveil himself
[33:29] continually throughout eternity there
[33:32] are things we can't even imagine to even
[33:34] ask him yet
[33:35] there's thoughts in our mind that I
[33:37] haven't even crossed our minds yet on
[33:40] what to ask him when we get on to the
[33:42] other side our spirit realm we're going
[33:45] to be able to see and feel and smell and
[33:47] understand things we've never known it's
[33:49] gonna open up a million more questions
[33:51] is it but then even when you're past the
[33:54] Millennium in the in the wedding supper
[33:55] and we we come back to this earth and
[33:58] it's set up just perfectly and we walk
[34:00] on the ashes of the wicked we are going
[34:03] to then have questions about our new
[34:05] bodies our flesh bodies our glorified
[34:08] bodies and what can this thing new
[34:10] everyone if we can just transport and
[34:12] speak and and we get to the Clift of an
[34:14] angel or something like on the mountain
[34:16] whatever and if we just slip who would
[34:18] not fall we just speak the word and what
[34:20] we'd be just fine and just go on as all
[34:22] get-out if there be a wild animal we'll
[34:25] just calm that little animal and just
[34:26] speak to him and we'll be able to pet
[34:27] him and love on him and all these things
[34:30] and it can open up questions these
[34:31] bodies but then as we go on beyond God
[34:33] and we see that he's under there's no
[34:36] limit to him we're gonna we're going to
[34:39] have more questions of that it will go
[34:40] on into that era that that that space
[34:44] where we are going to just God is just
[34:46] going to speak and one by one he's gonna
[34:49] answer every question that we don't have
[34:51] questions for yet he's going to have all
[34:54] the answers absolutely now in Exodus 26
[35:00] and verse 30 the reason i teaching on
[35:04] the Veil the veil is what brings all the
[35:08] questions the veil has brought all the
[35:12] canoe
[35:13] ujin's but then as god's chosen way to
[35:17] reveal himself is through the veil now
[35:23] in exodus 20:3 verse 30
[35:25] he's now shall reel tatin trier up the
[35:27] tabernacle according to the fashion area
[35:28] which was judy in the mount and thou
[35:31] shalt make a veil of blue and purple and
[35:33] scarlet and fine twined linen of cunning
[35:37] works with cherubs shall it be made this
[35:39] is going what into the holiest of holies
[35:41] there was that veil and he says he's
[35:43] when you when you make these and use
[35:45] your sewing machine with your hands and
[35:47] all these things needs to make sure
[35:48] there's cherubims even made inside he's
[35:51] white showing the one there's two angels
[35:53] guarding on this veil right he says he
[35:57] said thou shalt hang it on the four
[35:58] pillars of chinam wood overlaid with
[36:01] gold their hooks shall be of gold upon
[36:03] the four sockets of silver right and
[36:06] thou shall hang up the veil under the
[36:09] the catches which thou mayst bring in
[36:11] thither and within the veil the Ark of
[36:14] the testimony and the veil shall divide
[36:15] unto you between the holy place and
[36:18] almost wholly Amen right so God even the
[36:22] natural worship the oldest form of
[36:24] worship to his people that it was there
[36:26] was a veil there absolutely failed what
[36:28] the presence of God sure and he had
[36:31] cherubim over it and then in Hebrews 9
[36:35] in verse 5 he says and over over it with
[36:38] the chairman's of glory shadowing the
[36:41] mercy which cannot now we which we
[36:44] cannot now speak protection particularly
[36:46] absolutely so there's there's cherubims
[36:48] over the mercy seat but before we got
[36:50] into there there was that veil there's
[36:52] cherubims there as well right now and we
[36:55] know these everything's foreshadowing
[36:57] Messiah everything was moved at this
[36:59] time was foreshadowing Jesus Christ and
[37:01] and and he was such a mystery mysterious
[37:05] man our Lord Savior was right now in and
[37:08] in Daniel 9 verse 25 Daniel 9 verse 25
[37:14] who is he supposed to be
[37:15] when this Messiah came who is he
[37:17] supposed to be who is this in Daniel
[37:20] 9:25 know therefore understand that from
[37:22] the going forth of the commandment to
[37:24] restore and to build the Jerusalem
[37:26] to the Messiah the Prince okay shall be
[37:30] seven weeks and threescore and two weeks
[37:34] the street shall be built again the wall
[37:36] even in troublous times and then in
[37:38] verse 26 and after threescore two weeks
[37:41] shall Messiah be cut off so here is the
[37:44] one instance where the Scriptures
[37:47] profile prophesying of Messiah right and
[37:50] if you actually take that word Messiah
[37:52] and go back to the Hebrew and it is
[37:54] actually means The Anointed One
[37:58] it means the consecrated one right
[38:02] specifically he says the Messiah the
[38:04] king priest the saint specifically the
[38:05] Messiah The Anointed One
[38:07] he was consecrated for his right so
[38:09] everything's he shows that this is going
[38:11] to be someone anointed right and now in
[38:15] Isaiah 9:6 we know these things for unto
[38:18] us a child is born unto us a son is
[38:20] given and the government shall be upon
[38:21] his shoulder and his name shall be
[38:23] called wonderful counsellor the mighty
[38:25] God the everlasting father the Prince of
[38:27] Peace absolutely so this this right here
[38:30] is showing you this anointed person was
[38:32] going to be he was going to be all of it
[38:34] he's going to be wonderful and I know I
[38:36] was wonderful absolutely he fills me
[38:41] full of wonder he is as a counselor as
[38:43] well and I know it was like counseling
[38:44] he's taught me many many things I
[38:46] launched the time the hard way sometimes
[38:50] I got to go the hard way the the not the
[38:53] trips I picked the wrong path I pick I'm
[38:56] little too hasty of my judgments and I
[38:58] say well maybe this way or that's when
[38:59] there you go maybe this way and it's the
[39:01] wrong way and I have that God has to
[39:02] spank me and bring me up bring me all
[39:04] the way to the right way amen
[39:06] he says he's the mighty God the
[39:08] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[39:09] eases of the increase of his government
[39:11] peace shall be no end unto the throne of
[39:14] David unto his kingdom to order to
[39:16] establish it with judgment with justice
[39:18] from henceforth even forever more he
[39:20] says the zeal the Lord of hosts will
[39:22] perform it right so God said he says
[39:25] everything that goes forth out of my
[39:27] mouth he says I will perform it and did
[39:29] he not perform it saints of God were
[39:31] 2000 years past of when what the Messiah
[39:33] came absolutely the very first time
[39:37] sure now in Matthew 2 verse
[39:40] one he says now when Jesus was born in
[39:42] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[39:44] the King behold there came wise men from
[39:46] the east to Jerusalem saying where is he
[39:50] that was born the King of the Jews
[39:54] which we have seen his star in the east
[39:57] and are come to worship when Herod the
[39:58] King had heard these things he was
[40:00] troubled and all Jerusalem with him and
[40:02] that when they were gathered all the
[40:03] chief priests and scribes of the people
[40:05] together he demanded him where Christ he
[40:09] said should be born
[40:10] cousin Daniel has said that he said he
[40:12] said there strumming someone he says and
[40:14] it's going to be what the Messiah and I
[40:16] was under anointed one but now when he
[40:18] come the new to the New Testament he
[40:20] they don't call him Messiah they call
[40:22] now the Christ absolutely and with that
[40:24] word Christ means Christos and it also
[40:28] means an anointed one absolutely so when
[40:31] you when when people are talking about
[40:32] the Messiah it would be what the Christ
[40:34] absolutely Jesus that's why God made him
[40:40] both Lord and Christ he was the Messiah
[40:43] he identified him back to the Anointed
[40:45] One that was prophesied back there
[40:47] absolutely sure in the beginning he came
[40:56] and he would he spoke forth and we know
[40:59] he was veiled right sure
[41:03] in John 5
[41:16] five verse seventeen sorry pieces but
[41:22] jesus answered them my father work
[41:24] worketh hitherto and I work therefore
[41:28] the Jews sought the more to kill him
[41:29] because he had not only broken the
[41:31] Sabbath
[41:32] but said also that the God was his
[41:34] father making himself equal with God
[41:38] right and we know they were going to
[41:42] stone him for these things he says his I
[41:44] and my father are one they're gonna
[41:46] stone him for these things but we know
[41:47] we understand by the Word of God by the
[41:49] message that all the fullness of the
[41:52] Godhead bodily dwelt within that flesh
[41:54] right now in Matthew 26 verse 62 and the
[42:06] high priest arose and said unto Him
[42:08] answers now nothing he says what is it
[42:11] now what is it which these witnesses
[42:14] these witness against thee but Jesus
[42:17] held his peace and the high priest
[42:18] answered and said to him I adjure thee
[42:20] by the Living God that thou tell us
[42:21] whether thou be the Christ the Anointed
[42:24] One the Messiah the Son of God he says
[42:27] are you that and Jesus what did Jesus
[42:30] say in verse 64 he says thou hast said
[42:34] right in other words he says he says the
[42:37] Christos he says now said it
[42:39] nevertheless I say and you here after
[42:40] you shall see the Son of man sitting on
[42:42] the right hand of power and coming in
[42:44] the clouds of heaven and verse 65 then
[42:50] the high priest rent is closed saying he
[42:54] hath spoken blasphemy what further need
[42:57] have we of any witness behold now we
[43:00] have heard of his blasphemy now look at
[43:02] Matthew two six-six-six they said what
[43:06] have ye he says what think he and the
[43:08] answer that he is guilty of death
[43:11] absolutely the mark of the beast right
[43:15] there
[43:15] now he's guilty of death now in another
[43:19] section of scripture in Matt and mark
[43:21] verse chapter 14 verse 60 and the
[43:24] highest priest stood up in the mists and
[43:26] and asked Jesus saying answer thou
[43:28] nothing
[43:29] he says what is it now that he's witness
[43:31] against thee but he held his peace and
[43:33] answered nothing again the high priest
[43:35] asked him art thou the Christ art out
[43:37] that Messiah the son of the Blessed and
[43:40] Jesus said what he said I am he was
[43:47] identifying himself in all three Exodus
[43:52] 'as God had to come down and it was the
[43:55] invisible God came down what and availed
[43:58] himself in fire what in a burning bush
[44:01] he bailed himself right there but it was
[44:04] an invisible God he bailed himself right
[44:06] there and then what he veiled himself
[44:08] what in a prophet like Moses you know in
[44:10] a man of God like David he bailed
[44:12] himself in these men how could these
[44:15] moral men do anything how could they
[44:17] live out the Christ unless Christ was
[44:19] veiled in them absolutely amen and but
[44:22] he did it the Old Testament he did it
[44:24] what in this right here in his own son
[44:27] he bailed himself in his own son
[44:30] absolutely absolutely one who spoke out
[44:38] of that when he said that I wonder now
[44:42] in John 7 verse 14 John 7 verse 14 now
[44:50] about the midst of the feast Jesus one
[44:52] of the temple untaught and the Jews
[44:53] Maher was saying how knowest this man
[44:56] letters having never learned there was
[45:00] what a man of a man came up and he's in
[45:03] his disputing with the scribes he
[45:06] distributing with the Pharisees and
[45:08] Sadducees and he's in his bringing forth
[45:10] things he's speaking things but as he's
[45:13] speaking he's defeating them in the very
[45:15] ideas the very doctors he's actually
[45:17] setting them astray too narrow
[45:19] all these things how can he do these he
[45:22] was the Word of God right
[45:24] this Bible we have here was may actually
[45:26] made flesh this he turned these words
[45:31] and he made it flesh so because oh thank
[45:34] you so much a Man Thing thank you sister
[45:38] that's exactly
[45:39] oh I don't know what happened here but
[45:50] he was made flesh the very word of God
[45:53] was made flesh that's why he could live
[45:55] it out just perfectly right saints of
[45:58] God that's why you find yourself in your
[46:01] walks because you came off of God in the
[46:04] beginning you came all the way back
[46:07] there well you were the word as well
[46:09] that's why you find yourselves in this
[46:12] situation
[46:14] sitting under this word I met this
[46:17] sister right here in an airport quite a
[46:20] hurricane had come in we started talking
[46:23] these things in that met back at we got
[46:28] lost today there we had just sleep in
[46:31] hotels or whatever and then we flew to
[46:33] Toledo and then I witnessed to her again
[46:35] what caused this we had to live out our
[46:40] lives because Christ is within us
[46:42] everything you've been through has been
[46:44] ordained for you absolutely no one else
[46:49] could have lived your life brilliant man
[46:51] uh-uh what's in my my own battles in my
[46:54] own mind I said man I'd like to be like
[46:56] this person this person but I I have to
[46:58] let those battles down you can only be
[47:01] who you are absolutely no he could have
[47:04] went through what you went through now
[47:06] the one person can go through what
[47:07] you've been through
[47:08] and have the exact same outcome if
[47:11] brother Jesse tried to live my life he
[47:13] might have struggled hear this listening
[47:14] and it might what the hell because only
[47:18] I was Oh danger lived my life I could
[47:21] never let brother Jesse's life I could
[47:23] never live Lydia's life never could
[47:25] never but each one of us has of a
[47:27] specific time because what we were off
[47:29] of God we shot us through into this time
[47:32] we came forth in this generation to want
[47:35] to be a witness in a light saints of God
[47:41] in Wesley's age in Wesley's in Luther's
[47:45] age and Pentecost those areas look crazy
[47:48] but saints of God we were built for this
[47:52] age this this prophet of God looks to
[47:57] the outside world looks more crazy than
[47:59] anything else there's more confusion
[48:03] here about this this movement right here
[48:05] then maybe 100 years ago a zoo the
[48:08] street there's more confusion right here
[48:10] about this move it more more fear about
[48:13] it than even in Wesley or Luther's age
[48:15] absolutely why because this time God has
[48:20] come down
[48:23] he has come down and revealed the word
[48:27] you I'll be honest when I witness now
[48:30] and I find out these people are
[48:33] Christians and the one man he tells me
[48:36] he says I've got a lot of questions I
[48:38] said I've got all the answers by the
[48:39] grace of God but once they find out and
[48:42] they see the confidence they see the
[48:44] boldness in your eyes is I by the grace
[48:47] of God I'll take this very Bible and
[48:49] answer your questions they don't want
[48:50] nothing to do with it he told me two
[48:52] months ago how come here your church
[48:54] where is he yet but they don't
[48:59] understand I really think saints of God
[49:01] sometimes I think that sometimes you run
[49:03] into people and I feel like they can
[49:04] actually see that God is with you and it
[49:09] kind of spooks him a little bit give us
[49:10] a little they stand off a little bit
[49:11] like this guy knows what he's talking
[49:13] about and he's not scared if you give
[49:16] them that real sincere look and you try
[49:19] to pull God now while you're speaking to
[49:21] them and express to them that God can
[49:24] answer these things that we know what
[49:26] we're talking about absolutely by the
[49:28] grace of God everything's by the grace
[49:29] of God we can't go or nothin he gave it
[49:32] to us we might as well expand to it
[49:34] others absolutely we gotta share these
[49:36] things but I believe sometimes I just
[49:40] feel like they see God and it scares
[49:44] them because what is it it's light and
[49:47] once the light has brought forth a path
[49:50] and into their path and the explosion
[49:53] exposes the darkness and the Bible says
[49:55] the darkness don't understand it the
[49:58] true light I'm not talking about a
[50:00] Pentecostal light a denominational light
[50:02] I'm not talking about a false light I'm
[50:04] talking about the true
[50:06] light of God it will confound the
[50:08] darkness absolutely they will not
[50:10] understand it and they will flee oh so
[50:14] you're a Christian well what do you
[50:16] think about this baptism this this and
[50:18] they flee you're now in John 7 verse 28
[50:32] then cried Jesus in the temple as he
[50:34] taught saying ye both know me and you
[50:37] know from whence I am he says and I am
[50:39] NOT coming myself but he that sent me is
[50:41] true whom you know not he says but I
[50:43] know him for I am from him and he has
[50:46] sent me
[50:47] saints of God there might come a time
[50:50] there might come time Mary shortly where
[50:53] will have to answer just like this when
[51:00] you are fully what what happens when
[51:04] this book when this book of Acts starts
[51:05] again and God is now look at st. Paul
[51:10] look at st. Pete look at st. Peter on
[51:12] the day of Pentecost when he started
[51:14] speaking that was God in flesh speaking
[51:17] through it was it was it was so God they
[51:25] recorded as the Word of God it got
[51:27] recorded that sermon got recorded and
[51:29] now it is the Word of God
[51:32] even-steven a deacon so far the Holy
[51:36] Ghost signs wonders and miracles that
[51:38] when he spoke it's X recorded a deacon
[51:42] not even a preacher and it was recorded
[51:43] as a sermon start preaching bringing all
[51:47] the way from Genesis working it down he
[51:49] says he says why wouldn't you why do
[51:50] always resist the Holy Ghost don't lie
[51:52] and they stone him right there God come
[51:57] down veiled in there brother Malachi
[52:01] gets so full the Holy Ghost and he's
[52:04] dealing with a loss and says I have come
[52:06] my father I've come from my father and
[52:09] I'll go back to my father hey look
[52:12] insane absolutely
[52:14] crazy what if maokai would say I and my
[52:16] father are one and mean it absolutely
[52:22] sure now as far as the veil Christ this
[52:31] Christ was the greatest example of God
[52:35] veiled in flesh it was it's absolutely
[52:41] amazing the the Godhead study has been
[52:43] such an undertaking for me to really
[52:46] grasp it to hold it to be able to teach
[52:48] it to be able to understand it further
[52:50] and further
[52:51] but as once we got to these points as
[52:54] some of these scriptures started to
[52:56] actually be revealed to me it really
[52:58] helped me and it helped me to know on
[53:03] how this thing is coming yes
[53:05] saints of God there there is coming a
[53:08] time where we will have the very mind of
[53:10] Christ
[53:11] that's throw Simon what's that like I
[53:12] have no idea I do know there are
[53:16] thoughts like I'll say uh even being
[53:19] with sister Connie this this last week
[53:21] in here uh as we're trying to work a
[53:24] little bit here work a little air on on
[53:26] her house and whatever and we go ask I'd
[53:29] ask for this or that and and she would
[53:31] go and I'd see the battle that she's
[53:34] fighting the Lord just told me you do
[53:37] this and I go like this Oh silly me or
[53:40] you know the Lord the Lord told me to do
[53:43] this and yeah but I did this and so but
[53:45] but the Lord is constantly trying to
[53:47] guide her and to show her but she's in
[53:51] tune with it but all these voices now
[53:56] Satan knows God's within you
[53:58] and that he knows that God is trying to
[54:01] speak to you in that still small voice
[54:03] so he's got to put all your voices and
[54:05] he knows that you are six thousand years
[54:08] down six thousand years down from the
[54:11] fall and all this sin is compounded in
[54:13] your flesh and all the influence of this
[54:17] Laodicean world is just messing with us
[54:20] it's tearing us up it's tearing our
[54:22] minds up my goodness my cellphone is
[54:24] giving me tingling fingers now in
[54:26] ticularly hands I mean some messing with
[54:28] me home
[54:29] [Laughter]
[54:31] but I see the struggle that she's in she
[54:33] and I see her trying to yield and trying
[54:36] she's pushing hard to get into that
[54:37] leadership of the Holy Ghost that's
[54:39] where I want to be I want to be fully
[54:41] leading and guided by the Holy Ghost
[54:43] absolutely
[54:44] leaving the smallest things like what do
[54:46] you want me to do today absolutely I get
[54:49] on the jobsite Lord you want me to do
[54:50] this show me that I got to hear his
[54:52] voice do you want me to fast today do
[54:54] you want me to to win is this person new
[54:56] I caught brother Mike a fire hit our
[54:59] church and the smoke had totally uh
[55:02] taken our church and they couldn't
[55:04] breathe and it was in the carpet is
[55:05] everywhere and that day the Holy Ghost
[55:09] told brother mike.mccluskey
[55:10] leave work now but Mike said he got out
[55:15] of his thing called his boss and I go
[55:17] and I gotta go he went home he finished
[55:20] his his wife picked up stuff in mine

[55:24] his garage and we had service right
[55:25] there two or three days before that
[55:29] someone gave him 60 chairs God had him
[55:31] in service and he had his garage ready
[55:34] for service the Holy Ghost says leave
[55:37] work now
[55:38] yes brother mike says no sir absolutely
[55:45] he said both Simon me my wife hung all
[55:48] those sheets and all those sheets of tea

[56:02] him his wife got down to the walls and
[56:04] when we were ready for service the
[56:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost but I don't
[56:10] know too many men that would just leave
[56:13] work when God said leave work you got 40
[56:23] hours of work we work week this week huh
[56:25] or do I
[56:27] are you willing to lay your your your
[56:29] job on the line if God says leave work
[56:35] god help us
[56:37] amen that's right now
[56:42] being the veil in Psalm and psalms 2
[56:48] verse 6 wouldn't be fully yielded to the
[56:55] Holy Ghost
[57:04] then the Holy Ghost is so we're telling
[57:08] we're talking we're having good
[57:09] fellowship with sister Connie the other
[57:10] night and I was telling her how in
[57:12] February I got a I got such a movement
[57:15] of the Holy Ghost that's never hit
[57:16] before and I was always in the spirit
[57:20] for half an hour 45 minutes jumping
[57:22] shouting it was ours that was by the
[57:24] greatest feeling the Holy Ghost ever and
[57:26] for the next three days when I woke up
[57:28] he was there I felt him all over and I
[57:32] was it was a such a reverent time for me
[57:35] I'll never forget it and let me tell you
[57:37] how timid the Holy Ghost is I went to
[57:43] work I was feeling him on the way to
[57:44] work I feel him I'd call people listen I
[57:47] just feel him and he was there he was
[57:48] there he wanted to do it well with me he
[57:52] wanted to walk with me and I and I was
[57:55] at work and I was working and I'm
[57:56] working I'm cutting pie but this is and
[57:58] I'm still feeling the presence of God
[58:00] all over and it was just the most
[58:03] amazing one of the most amazing times in
[58:04] my life and I and I was feeling him and
[58:08] I had to go the bathroom so I went to
[58:09] the bathroom I got done with the
[58:11] bathroom and I was coming out of the
[58:13] bathroom and there's a real pretty young
[58:16] girl 21 years old and she's a
[58:18] construction worker demolition girl and
[58:21] I thought and I'm still feeding
[58:22] president god I thought I'm gonna say hi
[58:24] to her not anything evil or not I just
[58:27] said I'm gonna be I want to say hello so
[58:28] hello I said hello page and he left just
[58:33] like that he was gone I
[58:36] I did not feel him anywhere I did not I
[58:39] could not he left like that and I felt
[58:42] so burdened I said I hurry up I said I
[58:46] got back out I said lord please forgive
[58:47] me this is and he came right back just
[58:49] like that beside you just want to say
[58:54] hello you had absolutely no intentions
[58:56] of anything but you just want to say
[58:58] hello to this girl it was not the Lord's
[59:02] will as the Prophet was breaking down
[59:09] Christ at the the Pool of Bethesda I
[59:13] believe that all the the sick were
[59:15] trying to get in as the stirring of the
[59:18] waters he said he said now Christ was a
[59:22] totally LED of God God was veiled in his
[59:24] body and he went and picked out one sick
[59:27] person that was it he said now he's out
[59:32] that was divine love he said if it would
[59:34] have been human compassion he would have
[59:37] went to this one and healed that one
[59:39] healed this one and healed that because
[59:40] when you see someone in need someone
[59:42] hurt compassion naturally natural
[59:45] compassion starts kicking in oh my
[59:48] goodness they need help here and I gotta
[59:49] go help this and you know a Christ
[59:52] Fryzel he wanted to heal this one he
[59:53] wanted to heal that one that one this
[59:54] one but by the leadership of God he went
[59:57] and picked only one to heal and that was
[1:00:02] God that was God veiled in flesh
[1:00:07] completely veiled it was only only did
[1:00:14] what God wanted him to do see how see
[1:00:20] how far walks are off at least mine I oh
[1:00:23] my goodness I'm like Lord how am i how
[1:00:25] what will it take for me to get to that
[1:00:27] point now in Psalms 2 verse 26
[1:00:33] I'm sorry verse 6 to 6 yet have I set my
[1:00:36] king upon my holy hill of Zion I will
[1:00:39] declare the decree the Lord has said to
[1:00:41] be thou art my son this day I have
[1:00:44] begotten thee what God is now
[1:00:46] foreshadowing for telling that what he's
[1:00:48] going to create a
[1:00:49] son he's gonna create a body he's going
[1:00:54] to create a flesh to dwell in he says
[1:00:56] behold he's I've created these this days
[1:00:58] and this is my son right
[1:01:00] this is prophetic all the way now in
[1:01:03] Philippians 2 and verse 5 he says let
[1:01:05] this mind be in you which was in Christ
[1:01:07] Jesus who being in the form of God took
[1:01:10] not robbery to be equal with God he says
[1:01:13] but made himself of no reputation and
[1:01:15] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:01:18] was made in the likeness of men
[1:01:21] absolutely he had to come in flesh right
[1:01:24] I've taught this before back home I said
[1:01:26] why can't Satan be saved
[1:01:30] well God's all-powerful and sure he can
[1:01:33] make a way for salvation for Satan you
[1:01:35] know
[1:01:35] or-or-or a fallen angel how can how can
[1:01:38] how can they can't be saved why because
[1:01:43] they're a spirit in order to save a
[1:01:46] spirit a spirit must die but God is God
[1:01:50] and God is a spirit and God cannot die
[1:01:53] there is no sacrifice that's why God did
[1:01:57] not let us fall in the spirit realm
[1:01:59] hello we're up there he won't put us in
[1:02:03] the flesh so we could fall in the past
[1:02:08] that's right absolutely that's why we
[1:02:11] have to endure this thing because this
[1:02:13] is this this we see this thing's over
[1:02:16] it's already done it's already finished
[1:02:19] he put us in these goofy little houses
[1:02:21] right here these little vessels he's
[1:02:23] dwelling places because the soul our
[1:02:25] spirit man is already it's then we have
[1:02:27] we don't have nothing to worry about
[1:02:31] praise we know God hey man all we're
[1:02:38] doing is bad on this little pest house
[1:02:39] that saw this thing fail the deep down
[1:02:44] nothing in here fell we're always this
[1:02:46] therefore did not change the seed if I
[1:02:52] have to see the little genes you know
[1:02:54] God and I in this gene seed I want to be
[1:02:56] a father a son I have a spirit
[1:03:00] and be a yeah all those things just like
[1:03:02] my daddy to create things where he said
[1:03:04] nothing changed that seed nothing
[1:03:06] spiritually genetics happened to that
[1:03:08] little G seed line absolutely nothing
[1:03:10] but this flesh this flesh had to suffer
[1:03:13] this thing is what Philips he allowed
[1:03:16] that that seed to fall that was in that
[1:03:18] flesh that this flesh fails the seed hey
[1:03:23] man that's right absolutely and if and
[1:03:27] if this flesh can Bale our seed the
[1:03:30] flesh can Veil the Holy Ghost the
[1:03:33] incorruptible seed
[1:03:34] hey man praise be to God now he was
[1:03:39] fashioned as a man humble himself and
[1:03:41] became obedient unto death even the
[1:03:43] death of the cross he meant now let's go
[1:03:46] to Romans 8 verse 3 for what the law
[1:03:52] could not do and though is weak through
[1:03:54] the flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:03:57] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:04:00] condemned sin in the flesh absolutely
[1:04:03] that's why he was able to deceive the
[1:04:04] devil because the what God was veiled in
[1:04:08] this flesh and Satan could look at that
[1:04:10] flesh and say man he breathes just like
[1:04:12] Jobe did he he eats just like Moses did
[1:04:16] he does he walks just like other men
[1:04:19] that Satan's defeated or other men that
[1:04:21] Satan's embattled he looks just like a
[1:04:23] man to me and it was a man but he had no
[1:04:27] idea it was it was in the likeness of
[1:04:29] sinful flesh absolutely he says and
[1:04:35] sending his own son in likeness of
[1:04:37] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[1:04:40] in the flesh
[1:04:41] absolutely now in Hebrews 2 and 9 he
[1:04:45] says but we see Jesus who was made a
[1:04:47] little lower than angels for the
[1:04:48] suffering of death right he says crowned
[1:04:52] with glory and honor that that that he
[1:04:54] by the grace of God should taste death
[1:04:57] for every man he was what made as a man
[1:05:01] so that he could taste he was God put
[1:05:03] himself in flesh so that flesh could
[1:05:05] taste death that's how he redeemed us
[1:05:07] what's what through that flesh
[1:05:08] absolutely because the soul and the
[1:05:10] spirit is all connected to this flesh
[1:05:12] and
[1:05:13] get these things right he must have a
[1:05:15] sacrifice a perpetuation for that those
[1:05:18] deeds that were done in the flesh all
[1:05:19] that sin must be washed away so that so
[1:05:22] there must be as flesh they had no sin
[1:05:24] they could actually be an exchange
[1:05:26] absolutely it's right sure now Hebrews
[1:05:31] 10 verse 4 he says for it is not
[1:05:35] possible that the blood of bulls and
[1:05:37] goats should take away sins wherefore
[1:05:40] when he cometh into the world he saith
[1:05:41] sacrifice and offerings that would it's
[1:05:43] not he's but a body thou hast prepared
[1:05:46] me amen God prepared a body for himself
[1:05:52] in burnt offerings and the sacrifices
[1:05:55] for sin he is thou has had no pleasure
[1:05:58] then said i lo I come in the volume the
[1:06:01] book is written of me to do thy will O
[1:06:04] God absolutely now let's get to where
[1:06:10] the couple scriptures I want to hit here
[1:06:14] in John 2 verses 19 Jesus and answered
[1:06:20] answered and said unto them destroy this
[1:06:22] temple in three days I will raise it up
[1:06:25] this temple right he says then say that
[1:06:28] now what I wonder if this was the father
[1:06:30] speaking right here he said destroy this
[1:06:34] temple another's destroy the son I
[1:06:38] believe that was almost the father he's
[1:06:40] in three days he says what he says I
[1:06:42] will raise it up that's the Holy Ghost
[1:06:45] that sounds like the father to me he
[1:06:48] said he's speaking out see that's why
[1:06:50] that's why this that's why Jesus looks
[1:06:52] so insane he looks so crazy because he'd
[1:06:54] say things right that's right even 2,000
[1:06:59] years later these these red letters are
[1:07:01] confounding the wise every seminary in
[1:07:05] America set up what to focus on finding
[1:07:07] who God is trying to find his will who
[1:07:10] is this God we want more we need
[1:07:11] salvation they know the end times has
[1:07:14] come and they know he may know the
[1:07:15] rapture is coming and they want
[1:07:17] salvation they set up these schools to
[1:07:18] train them and how to convert this and
[1:07:20] that he's but they're missing it Christ
[1:07:22] has been veiled again absolutely
[1:07:27] then said the Jew is 14 six years was
[1:07:30] this temple in building and without
[1:07:31] weird up in three days but he spake of
[1:07:33] the body of his temple I said the temple
[1:07:37] of his body
[1:07:39] amen in Hebrews five and six
[1:07:44] this is this really really helped me
[1:07:47] understand the veil the Godhead as he
[1:07:53] saith Austin another place thou art a
[1:07:55] priest forever after the order of
[1:07:57] Melchizedek who in the days of his flesh
[1:08:04] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:08:08] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:08:09] with strong crying's and tears unto him
[1:08:13] that was able to save him from death
[1:08:14] look if the in-court rider was there he
[1:08:17] would have marked him and he was marked
[1:08:19] yet the Holy Ghost he says he had one
[1:08:21] soul travail he says he says to save him
[1:08:24] from death in here and it was heard and
[1:08:26] that he feared why was that body always
[1:08:30] crying the body of Jesus why was he
[1:08:33] always sad he was always praying it was
[1:08:39] the man and if he the man the perfect
[1:08:43] man had to cry inside from the Bhama
[1:08:46] Nations done in that city if he had to
[1:08:48] cry inside for the abominations for
[1:08:50] things that were done that he's seen his
[1:08:52] people doing he says I come as a head he
[1:08:54] says that I want to cover you like like
[1:08:56] a hand would have brewed he's but you
[1:08:58] would not these these it was his flesh
[1:09:02] that was veiled up it was that flesh had
[1:09:04] to conquer he had to conquer his flesh
[1:09:06] God was veiled in there now in Hebrews
[1:09:11] 10 verse 20
[1:09:16] he says by a new and living way which he
[1:09:19] hath consecrated for us he says through
[1:09:21] the veil that is to say his flesh saints
[1:09:28] of God Jesus Christ the man was a veil
[1:09:33] it was his body it was God's own body
[1:09:38] absolutely if you look in acts 2 and 22
[1:09:42] he meant events are here these words
[1:09:44] Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God
[1:09:48] among you by miracles and wonders and
[1:09:51] signs which God did by him in the midst
[1:09:53] of you absolutely what that body
[1:09:58] remember if we are creating the image of
[1:10:01] God and you were given that body you
[1:10:03] were giving a body we're all giving
[1:10:05] these bodies right and we're in the
[1:10:06] image of God that means God had to have
[1:10:08] a body absolutely but his body did not
[1:10:11] come on the scene until what 4,000 years
[1:10:13] later because I had to come in as a
[1:10:16] saving power absolutely sure now let's
[1:10:21] continue on by the grace of God let's
[1:10:26] see in Colossians 1:19 Colossians 1:19
[1:10:34] says forehead please the Father that in
[1:10:36] him should all fullness dwell and having
[1:10:39] made peace through the blood of his
[1:10:40] cross by him to reconcile all things
[1:10:42] unto himself by him I say whether these
[1:10:45] things being earth or things in heaven
[1:10:47] and you that that ye were sometimes
[1:10:51] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[1:10:53] wicked works yet now hath he reconciled
[1:10:56] in what in the body of his flesh through
[1:10:59] death in other words he took everything
[1:11:01] into that flesh every sin every evil
[1:11:04] thought all the iniquities was taken by
[1:11:06] that veil that flesh absolutely right to
[1:11:09] present you what holy and unblameable
[1:11:10] and I'm reproval in his sight absolutely
[1:11:13] that veil took it on after he took the
[1:11:16] brunt of the force right there that veil
[1:11:18] and as the problem started when it
[1:11:21] became a bumper absolutely his blood
[1:11:23] became a bumper for us even even though
[1:11:25] we sin now he's up there what he's that
[1:11:27] ugly still that bloody bleeding lamb
[1:11:29] right now
[1:11:30] yes and that veil that's the thing about
[1:11:35] him is that if you're looking reverie
[1:11:37] was the revelations of five and six it
[1:11:39] says is it don't weep John he says
[1:11:41] behold the lion the tribe of Judah has
[1:11:43] ytz
[1:11:43] he heard these things that he saw a lamb
[1:11:45] coming and that lamb that body came and
[1:11:47] took the book from the father it was the
[1:11:50] body coming to get it from God Himself
[1:11:52] absolutely
[1:11:53] but remember the same spirit that stone
[1:11:54] that throne is the same spirit in that
[1:11:56] body
[1:11:57] this is they Birdman said he says he
[1:12:00] says now he's I'll show you a mystery
[1:12:02] here and he goes there scripture where
[1:12:05] he talks about Jesus where Jesus says he
[1:12:06] says if he answer he says was John they
[1:12:09] said I was a child of God
[1:12:11] and Jesus said let me ask you a question
[1:12:12] he said the Son of Man is here on earth
[1:12:14] and he's also in heaven and the promise
[1:12:17] of reason what do you mean by that and
[1:12:19] then later in the sermon he says he said
[1:12:21] God was omnipresent that's exactly right
[1:12:26] and so he can be in heaven on earth at
[1:12:28] the exact same time yes sir that's right
[1:12:33] amens now simple study but this is a
[1:12:35] this is what we got
[1:12:37] amen now I want to read you a couple a
[1:12:41] couple quotes by the grace of God
[1:12:49] 56 truly he cried for mercy at the cross
[1:12:54] he cried like a man he says when he was
[1:12:57] dying and when he rose on Easter morning
[1:13:00] he proved he was God on that cross they
[1:13:04] saw a man crying isn't this but when he
[1:13:06] rose up you'll see him sad anymore
[1:13:09] everything changed it was over he says
[1:13:17] this is not mourn playing like I'm just
[1:13:19] a man it's God who I am and you
[1:13:31] revealing the revelation that's it he
[1:13:33] says I am God absolutely that's what I
[1:13:35] was trying to do all those things
[1:13:36] everything brought in relations worn
[1:13:38] those things he was proving it was his
[1:13:40] deity he was God but he had to play the
[1:13:43] part he's an actor absolutely you had to
[1:13:45] put their veil on and that both had to
[1:13:47] act he had to put that mask on
[1:13:50] everything had to act to hide who was
[1:13:52] behind that very God God very God was
[1:13:55] behind it as Lee all the way from
[1:13:57] Genesis 1 only brothers it was God
[1:14:00] hiding and he left that Bale act out MA
[1:14:05] he said we rose he proved a he was God a
[1:14:08] man he's the resurrected one he's God
[1:14:11] man he says God was in Christ he said he
[1:14:14] said now my for the reason people
[1:14:15] couldn't understand him sometimes it was
[1:14:17] Christ speaking or the son speaking
[1:14:20] other times it was the father speaking
[1:14:24] look at the scripture read the read the
[1:14:26] four Gospels and look at all these red
[1:14:29] letters and new with the understanding
[1:14:32] that you had the leadership you decide
[1:14:33] can you discern if that's the father
[1:14:35] speaking or the son is that God Almighty
[1:14:38] speaking at the flesh or is that a man
[1:14:42] yes he says sometimes it was the son
[1:14:46] speaking others it was a father he was a
[1:14:48] dual person how many dual persons do we
[1:14:54] have here tonight
[1:14:56] I fail constantly Saints all the time I
[1:15:06] fail but when it comes time to pray for
[1:15:09] the sick sometimes to teach a Bible
[1:15:13] study what we have to yield to the Holy
[1:15:16] Ghost say Lord you are now full control
[1:15:20] help me to catch your very mind and
[1:15:22] speak your words and what that'll be the
[1:15:25] exact same thing as Christ speaking
[1:15:28] absolutely sure now let's continue on he
[1:15:35] says it was a dual person he was one man
[1:15:37] the Sun God was was in him which was
[1:15:41] tabernacling him but he what did he do
[1:15:43] did he go around saying I'm the healer
[1:15:45] he says very contrary because remember
[1:15:50] that's just his body the life is the
[1:15:55] person the very person the invisible
[1:15:58] person the that is the life of God that
[1:16:01] is God himself he's the one that has all
[1:16:06] the power he's the one that makes all
[1:16:08] the decisions he's the one that does
[1:16:10] everything all faith everything we have
[1:16:13] is because of that invisible person God
[1:16:15] Almighty that's why we have to wait on
[1:16:17] him if there's we cannot glory in this
[1:16:20] flesh or anything that you think you've
[1:16:22] done arrived done there is no glory we
[1:16:25] have this is all a work of an invisible
[1:16:27] man absolutely absolutely but he has
[1:16:33] created a veil that we can see him now
[1:16:35] in saints of God when we catch that
[1:16:37] eyesight when we finally see him in his
[1:16:39] body
[1:16:40] that's what things are gonna this one's
[1:16:42] gonna gonna get hot absolutely I mean
[1:16:45] like there is there is and we start
[1:16:47] running and jumping absolutely because
[1:16:48] that's I cannot wait to hug that flesh
[1:16:51] they died for me that fresh they shed
[1:16:53] his blood on Calvary that's what I
[1:16:55] cannot wait for it I'm just gonna hug
[1:16:57] him as best as I can absolutely tell the
[1:17:00] whispering for every man he says what he
[1:17:04] says he says Cree take the cut the the
[1:17:06] the compliments of Amma healings of no
[1:17:08] he says it isn't me to do what the works
[1:17:09] it's my
[1:17:10] father that dwelleth in me yes sometimes
[1:17:17] I wonder if God allows people to get
[1:17:19] healed by a certain individual or listen
[1:17:21] ed to test whether they'll take the
[1:17:23] credit for it or they'll take the glory
[1:17:26] in it and saints of God that's where we
[1:17:29] must why our way ourselves as well
[1:17:31] absolutely now here in 57 12 11 he says
[1:17:35] Christ seemed to be a dual personality
[1:17:37] he would speak sometimes they'd scratch
[1:17:39] their heads and they didn't understand
[1:17:41] him he says he speak one thing one time
[1:17:43] look like and sometimes else something
[1:17:45] another what was it was Jesus speaking
[1:17:48] when Christ is speaking Jesus was the
[1:17:51] man he says Christ was the god that was
[1:17:53] in him no he says not me to do with the
[1:17:55] works my father taught men he doeth the
[1:17:57] works II God will share his glory with
[1:17:59] no one even the son would not take glory
[1:18:03] for what God had done I wonder I think
[1:18:11] on this here where the when they went
[1:18:15] when people came to worship Jesus how
[1:18:19] could you accept the honor except the
[1:18:20] father allow him to accept that spirit
[1:18:23] within him allows people to worship him
[1:18:25] because they're actually not worshiping
[1:18:26] that flesh they're worshiping the God
[1:18:28] within it but as we understand the
[1:18:32] greater understanding is what that got
[1:18:33] that flesh was God as we were well we
[1:18:37] will worship God in that flesh as well
[1:18:39] absolutely in the beginning was the word
[1:18:42] the word Ruth God the Word was God and
[1:18:45] that what word was made flesh absolutely
[1:18:47] very simple sure now instead of saying
[1:18:52] let's sing I know he says you know Jesus
[1:18:54] right at the end the end of his ministry
[1:18:56] his disciples couldn't understand him no
[1:18:58] one could understand why he says no one
[1:19:00] he said how many know they couldn't
[1:19:02] understand I'm sure why they thought he
[1:19:04] had a dual personality he says at times
[1:19:07] in time again dual personality dual
[1:19:10] personally that that flesh that veil had
[1:19:13] totally hidden God what on mystery but
[1:19:19] in this day saints of God that's why we
[1:19:20] have the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:19:22] lift up
[1:19:23] the veil but remember this mystery
[1:19:26] cannot just be taught it has to be
[1:19:28] revealed and you have to be able to see
[1:19:32] it you have to be able to hear it
[1:19:34] absolutely yes yes it is a complete and
[1:19:38] he said he was a capstone revelation to
[1:19:40] Godhead propensity it was the greatest
[1:19:42] revelation you could have is
[1:19:44] understanding who God is the simplicity
[1:19:47] of that he's just one person absolutely
[1:19:49] now I like the stories as Christ on the
[1:19:56] boat he says they had entered with him
[1:19:58] in the ship and brought him aboard and
[1:20:00] when they went across the sea to preach
[1:20:01] over on the other side and Jesus saw as
[1:20:03] Gloria has this glorious opportunity
[1:20:05] he's being tired and weak because he was
[1:20:08] human he wasn't immortal then he was a
[1:20:14] man and he had to die that's the reason
[1:20:17] God had to be made a man in order to die
[1:20:23] that's why he didn't have to save that
[1:20:26] ship because the disciples he had to
[1:20:28] save it for himself because what he
[1:20:30] could die he had a potential death right
[1:20:32] there
[1:20:33] he was made of March oh absolutely but
[1:20:36] once the body is resurrected and got it
[1:20:38] now is glorified now I can die no more
[1:20:41] I'm here which liveth and she'll never
[1:20:43] die again amen amen
[1:20:46] sure now but what that was that his
[1:20:51] first veil absolutely not
[1:20:55] let's see here in Hebrews
[1:21:00] verse one God who has sundry times and
[1:21:08] divers manners spake in time past unto
[1:21:10] the father's by the prophets hath in
[1:21:12] these last days spoken to us by his son
[1:21:13] by whom he had appointed heir of all
[1:21:16] things by whom he had also made all
[1:21:18] things who being the brightness of his
[1:21:20] glory write what it was what he they
[1:21:24] were dealing with what the light now
[1:21:26] sure
[1:21:27] God was what in the light let there be
[1:21:30] light absolutely that was showing what
[1:21:32] that was showing for that was actually
[1:21:34] take place I believe as before or am
[1:21:37] sorry that was after what the Sun had
[1:21:39] come out of the father okay
[1:21:42] now in Hebrews 11:1 he says now faith is
[1:21:49] the substance of things hoped for and
[1:21:50] the evidence not seen for by it the
[1:21:53] elders obtained a good report through
[1:21:55] faith we understand that the worlds were
[1:21:57] framed by the Word of God in the
[1:22:02] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:22:04] the earth so that word there was now
[1:22:06] with God right God was the invisible man
[1:22:10] right he was invisible and he said let
[1:22:13] there be I want to be a son and he spoke
[1:22:16] out he said let there be light and what
[1:22:18] there was a body now that light body God
[1:22:21] the invisible God goes and dwells within
[1:22:23] that light and through now when I was
[1:22:25] father and son it is what the invisible
[1:22:28] God and the light body now that light
[1:22:30] and he speaks now he starts to creation
[1:22:33] yes that's for the confusion let us make
[1:22:37] man was that God in the Angels let us
[1:22:41] make man no that was the father in the
[1:22:42] son let us make man in our image
[1:22:46] absolutely sure now let's continue on by
[1:22:50] the grace of God just a real simple
[1:22:53] thought Saints the veil let's see here
[1:23:00] let's let's move here in rebel
[1:23:04] nation's 1 verse 16
[1:23:16] completely veil himself here as John
[1:23:21] heard the voice he turned to look and
[1:23:23] he's seen one in the midst of the seven
[1:23:25] golden candlesticks and he had his right
[1:23:27] hand had seven stars out of mouth went a
[1:23:29] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:23:30] countenance was as the son shyness in
[1:23:33] his strength even though he saw the body
[1:23:36] but the very face of God shone out what
[1:23:39] the low gasp once again that bright at
[1:23:41] the face shined what the holy ghost that
[1:23:43] low gasp that light shine right out
[1:23:45] revealing it was the same one that spoke
[1:23:47] the world in existence
[1:23:49] absolutely sure now I see here kind of
[1:23:58] caught up tonight by the grace of God
[1:23:59] it's alright here we go in John 1 verse
[1:24:04] 2 and 1:1 says in the beginning was the
[1:24:12] word the Word was with God the Word was
[1:24:13] God that word is the logos it means a
[1:24:16] what a spoken word right he said the
[1:24:19] same was in the beginning with God who
[1:24:22] he was there all things were made by him
[1:24:25] and without him was not anything made
[1:24:26] that was made in him was life
[1:24:29] who was that life that was God himself
[1:24:31] he says in that light in their logos was
[1:24:35] like the invisible God he says and that
[1:24:37] life was the light of men absolutely and
[1:24:40] that light shined in the darkness and
[1:24:43] the darkness comprehended it not
[1:24:49] God chose God Himself chose to dwell in
[1:24:52] the light that was his first choice for
[1:24:54] a veil was in the light because what's
[1:24:57] more powerful than light is darkness
[1:25:01] more powerful the light absolutely not
[1:25:04] darkness cannot even stand in the same
[1:25:07] room as light you can't do it it runs
[1:25:10] that flees at the speed of light it's
[1:25:14] just as fast as I absolutely is it and
[1:25:19] then the light shined in the darkness of
[1:25:21] the darkness comprehended at night now
[1:25:23] in verse 7 and there came for a witness
[1:25:26] this the same came for a witness to bear
[1:25:28] witness of
[1:25:29] the lights he's talking about who Jesus
[1:25:31] Christ absolutely is that were made
[1:25:34] fresh that light's made flesh see that's
[1:25:36] why these words of God are so important
[1:25:38] this is a very light these black letters
[1:25:43] these red letters is very light when you
[1:25:47] that's why we had the lampstands and all
[1:25:48] these things because they've this this
[1:25:50] word is now the light because we're in
[1:25:54] the darkness when in the world but once
[1:25:56] we hear the word the word of God he says
[1:25:59] what is a light that shines upon our
[1:26:02] seed here when we hear these things it
[1:26:03] goes and hits the very seed our life and
[1:26:05] as shoots and brings light to our seed
[1:26:07] and it quickens our seed so the word is
[1:26:11] veiled that's why people can burn this
[1:26:13] and throw it away and speak all evil
[1:26:15] against it because it's veiled he said
[1:26:19] there was a man sent from God he's at oh
[1:26:20] sorry verse verse 7 the same came for
[1:26:23] witness to bear witness of the light
[1:26:24] that all men through him might believe
[1:26:26] he was not whom John the Baptist was not
[1:26:29] that light but he was sent to bear
[1:26:31] witness of that light that was that true
[1:26:34] light that which lighteth every man that
[1:26:37] cometh into the world he was that same
[1:26:41] God that gives the life to them now in
[1:26:50] in Deuteronomy 9 2 he says a great
[1:27:00] people great and tall the children of
[1:27:03] Anakin's whom thou knowest of whom that
[1:27:06] was heard who can stand before the child
[1:27:08] the children of anak understand this day
[1:27:11] that the Lord thy God is he which goes
[1:27:13] over before thee what as a consuming
[1:27:16] fire that was God veiled in that logos
[1:27:21] once again and he want it went and
[1:27:23] destroyed the enemies absolutely sure
[1:27:26] and in Hebrews 12 verse 28 he says for
[1:27:28] God is a consuming fire he's one of the
[1:27:31] same in the in in the Exodus in Exodus
[1:27:33] 14 verse 24 and it came to pass the
[1:27:36] morning which morning watch the Lord
[1:27:38] looked unto the host of the Egyptians
[1:27:40] through the
[1:27:41] fire of the cloud and of the cloud and
[1:27:45] troubled the host the Egyptians God was
[1:27:47] now lost in the pillar fire blocking the
[1:27:50] Egyptians forward his people and God was
[1:27:53] in the mysteries looking out through the
[1:27:55] fire he said that God that thought that
[1:27:58] Sun Jesus was right there he was right
[1:28:02] there before Abraham was I am Amen
[1:28:04] that's why he could that's why you could
[1:28:07] say when he had to say that's why he is
[1:28:09] God because he was right there he was
[1:28:12] just another veil that was his veil that
[1:28:14] was his body as a light body absolutely
[1:28:16] yes sure and Daniel 2 verse 22 he
[1:28:21] reveals the deep and secret things he
[1:28:23] North when is in the darkness and the
[1:28:25] light dwelleth with himself he knows
[1:28:27] what's in the darkness he has to bring
[1:28:29] light to it and expose it absolutely yes
[1:28:32] sure in Psalms 104 verse 1 bless the
[1:28:36] Lord O my soul o live my god he's the
[1:28:38] Vil our great that were clothed with
[1:28:40] honor and Majesty who covers thyself
[1:28:42] with light as with a garment absolutely
[1:28:46] yes sure God is veiled in light in acts
[1:28:57] 9 1 Saul went out with with threatenings
[1:29:01] and breathing's thrown out to find these
[1:29:03] Christians full the Holy Ghost and in
[1:29:07] verse 3 and as he journeyed he came near
[1:29:09] Damascus and suddenly there shine round
[1:29:11] about him a light from heaven was that
[1:29:15] the corporal body of Christ no the body
[1:29:18] was up there was still bleeding what the
[1:29:21] B's atoning for the people up in heaven
[1:29:23] the mercy seat but then now verse 4 and
[1:29:26] he fell to the earth and a voice saying
[1:29:27] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he
[1:29:30] said who art thou Lord and the Lord said
[1:29:33] I am Jesus the same one that invisible
[1:29:39] God now veiled back with the light
[1:29:42] coming back to his people once again
[1:29:44] it's the same God all the way through
[1:29:47] that's why that picture of the pillar of
[1:29:49] fire brother above the prophets head is
[1:29:51] so important it shows it was the exact
[1:29:55] God though Abraham meant it was exact
[1:29:58] same God that Moses ruined what the
[1:30:00] Bible says when I raised up a prophet
[1:30:01] like unto Moses like me Christ was
[1:30:05] another one but it was also our prophet
[1:30:08] he was just like Moses those who has
[1:30:11] powerful ministries Moses and our
[1:30:13] prophet unparalleled outside of Christ
[1:30:17] they were off the charts absolutely I
[1:30:20] mean look at all look as Moses one of
[1:30:23] the Egypt's he conquered an entire
[1:30:25] nation by the power of God nothing stood
[1:30:29] before him creation literally took place
[1:30:32] right there as for in the form of
[1:30:35] plagues what is this third poet's I
[1:30:39] wonder if this moving as this was going
[1:30:40] to be this is going to be different than
[1:30:42] we've ever thought we don't need that's
[1:30:45] why Jesus said he's don't even try to
[1:30:46] think what you're going to say don't try
[1:30:48] to think what you're gonna do
[1:30:49] be sufficient full of days because it
[1:30:51] goes of the day what tomorrow but has
[1:30:53] evil in as well he says I am Jesus whom
[1:30:59] that persecutors it is hard for thee to
[1:31:01] kick against the pre the pricks John
[1:31:06] 3:24 every one that doeth evil hateth
[1:31:10] the light neither cometh to the light
[1:31:14] that's why they're in darkness and
[1:31:15] Ezekiel eight neither comes a light lest
[1:31:20] his deeds should be reproved oh my
[1:31:22] Saints have got our Lord everything
[1:31:24] wrong with me shown religious if you
[1:31:28] pick up an evil spirit on me you are
[1:31:29] obligated to tell me and Isabella
[1:31:33] Williams as I charge you to tell me I
[1:31:35] leave you with a charge absolutely yeah
[1:31:41] praise be to God oh my in 1st Timothy 6
[1:31:45] verse 15 he says which in his type which
[1:31:49] in his times he shall shew is the
[1:31:50] blessed and only potentate the king of
[1:31:53] kings in their lives who only hath
[1:31:56] immortality dwelling in that light
[1:32:01] 1st John 1 verse 4 and these things
[1:32:06] write we unto you that your joy may be
[1:32:08] full
[1:32:09] is the message which you've heard from
[1:32:10] him and declare and declare unto you
[1:32:12] that God is light and in him is no
[1:32:16] darkness at all I just saw a little
[1:32:19] experiment you take a candle and hold it
[1:32:21] up next to a wall and you shine a light
[1:32:25] on it and there's immunity there's gonna
[1:32:27] be a shadow where that candle is but
[1:32:29] there's no shadow where that light is
[1:32:30] because there's no darkness in them at
[1:32:32] all hey man yes sir praise the Lord
[1:32:40] and if we say we have fellowship with
[1:32:43] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:32:45] not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:32:47] light as he is in the light he says we
[1:32:50] have fellowship one with another and the
[1:32:52] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[1:32:54] us from all sin correct amen
[1:33:06] now look we says here he says notice
[1:33:08] then when we become part of him as you
[1:33:13] as you are the veil that veils him now
[1:33:18] once you receive the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:33:20] you now become the very veil of God you
[1:33:26] now our God or God's walking in your
[1:33:30] flesh right that is why it's so careful
[1:33:35] that we must be very very a sincere in
[1:33:40] our walk because if you stumble someone
[1:33:43] they can they with that that will come
[1:33:46] up on Judgment Day correct he's then
[1:33:49] when we become part of him as you are a
[1:33:51] veil that veils and you are part of him
[1:33:53] as long as Christ is in you as Christ
[1:33:56] was of God because God was in him made
[1:33:59] him God and as Christ is in you the hope
[1:34:01] of glory you become part of Christ amen
[1:34:04] he says he said you see you become part
[1:34:07] of Christ as long as Christ is hidden
[1:34:09] you then it's veiled to the unbeliever
[1:34:11] but you know he is in you you are temple
[1:34:14] you are tempering Christ that's behind
[1:34:17] the veil the skin because of this veil
[1:34:19] the veil again is in the veil is in
[1:34:22] again
[1:34:22] and human flesh you hide God from the
[1:34:25] unbeliever not everyone's going to be
[1:34:31] saved Saints when it comes down to the
[1:34:33] end of the end it's all predestination
[1:34:35] and God's election and choosing if
[1:34:40] there's a pillar fire right now and it
[1:34:42] would stay a pillar fire and go and we
[1:34:45] could we could walk with and go around
[1:34:46] the world we would save every single
[1:34:48] person because that would prove there's
[1:34:49] a god there he is look he's what do you
[1:34:52] want from him in that pillar fire God
[1:34:54] would speak out and tell him what he
[1:34:56] wanted what he needed and that person
[1:34:58] would accept that yeah but remember this
[1:35:03] is now full salvation God said he's a
[1:35:07] stranger to not follow he said and that
[1:35:09] lose one so he's sending he's he's
[1:35:11] putting out the Holy Ghost and believers
[1:35:13] so that that now he can go walk through
[1:35:17] the world and what wins souls but
[1:35:21] remember he V has to veil himself there
[1:35:24] and what are we to win by were to win
[1:35:28] with the Word of God with signs wonders
[1:35:30] and miracles what proving that what's in
[1:35:32] you is real and the unbeliever is not
[1:35:36] gonna believe it a lot of times the
[1:35:37] majority time because it's you who would
[1:35:41] follow a man now many people they like
[1:35:42] to follow themselves they'd like to lead
[1:35:44] themselves but God has the veil himself
[1:35:47] in you and he wants to veil himself in
[1:35:50] you and be and you be used by him
[1:35:53] absolutely that is the whole point of
[1:35:55] the everything here in the culmination
[1:35:57] of everything there's the whole point he
[1:35:59] wants to live and dwell in you so you
[1:36:03] can have a testimony so he can do the
[1:36:06] greater works through you absolutely
[1:36:10] sure like he says here it's in a being
[1:36:14] led of the Holy Spirit 1956 he says and
[1:36:19] these things that you see now will be a
[1:36:22] mature toward our Lord is fixing to do
[1:36:26] the things that were taking place
[1:36:28] in the prophet's ministry he says what
[1:36:31] you see now he's as amateur compared to
[1:36:34] what's coming things have got in closing
[1:36:41] the best thing the best scriptural
[1:36:45] advice is to number one put God first
[1:36:53] number two get a prayer life like you've
[1:36:58] only dreamed of I told this testimony I
[1:37:04] was deal I did a side job for an
[1:37:06] insulator man he works overseas and has
[1:37:08] left his Japanese wife at home and I
[1:37:12] think I suppose before she dresses
[1:37:14] extremely tight closing bobbed hair
[1:37:17] makeup but because her husband left her
[1:37:20] for long extended periods of time and
[1:37:22] she did not want to be unfaithful to him
[1:37:25] because she's very pretty
[1:37:28] her only outlet was Jesus Christ and she
[1:37:33] go to her basement and she said she
[1:37:35] started praying for five to six hours a
[1:37:37] day and she would answer God would speak
[1:37:43] to her constantly and she said people
[1:37:47] would come to her in her church and say
[1:37:49] what I came in renamed she said they
[1:37:51] said sister we need an answer on this
[1:37:53] and she would go to the closet guy would
[1:37:55] speak to her right away and tell them
[1:37:57] and she says as many people who are very
[1:37:59] wealthy because of her getting in that
[1:38:00] closet and giving them the very correct
[1:38:03] answer on what to do in their lives
[1:38:06] Saints oh god this is a denominational
[1:38:08] Christian this is someone who stores
[1:38:10] pants but because they had a prayer life
[1:38:15] who am i preaching here but because
[1:38:20] their prayer was so in tune with God
[1:38:23] William William Seymour he said he said
[1:38:27] he had such a hunger for God that he
[1:38:28] started praying what 3 to 5 hours a day
[1:38:30] for what three years before and that is
[1:38:33] use a street hit I
[1:38:39] quote and the Prophet was teaching he
[1:38:43] said how many Moses's are out here
[1:38:45] how many Moses's that they have the same
[1:38:48] calling of God on them that the minister
[1:38:51] would have or Moses would have he says
[1:38:53] but instead these that you've taken a
[1:38:55] job and you've taken the easy life
[1:38:58] you've got a job at the pulp Factory
[1:39:00] said or somewhere he said that you
[1:39:03] didn't want to be used by God I thought
[1:39:07] he says he says you sold your birthright
[1:39:08] out he said to having an easy living
[1:39:11] life he did not want to be a veil for
[1:39:16] Jesus Christ man let's let's stand very
[1:39:23] simple Saints but as as we're out and
[1:39:38] about I'll say that when when I'm
[1:39:41] witnessing now but when I come to a soul
[1:39:44] I step in my in my mind I step back we
[1:39:51] start talking and I step back now and I
[1:39:54] just wait and I wait for things to come
[1:39:57] out the best I can and I weigh their
[1:40:01] words very carefully
[1:40:03] and I'm like Lord what would you have me
[1:40:06] say and if you just if you'll find out
[1:40:09] if you just yield and you work you work
[1:40:13] with what you're given out of their
[1:40:14] mouth you work with it
[1:40:16] and you bring it in a sweet kind manner
[1:40:19] real gentle humble just kind and and if
[1:40:27] they're looking in your eyes you can you
[1:40:30] can see what they're seeing they know
[1:40:34] they're approaching a man of God or a
[1:40:37] daughter of God
[1:40:38] I just met a big tall guy built like a
[1:40:41] tank in his 50s ruined his entire life
[1:40:45] he started spilling his guts
[1:40:46] I said sir can I pray for you he said
[1:40:50] yeah I like that I'd like you to pray
[1:40:52] for me
[1:40:53] to the prayer of faith the saints of God
[1:40:55] he went on his way but he walked in that
[1:40:57] factory like this fished down like this
[1:41:02] wouldn't smile this and that but as I
[1:41:05] started to talk with them saints of God
[1:41:07] you can you can change the very
[1:41:08] countenance of their faces by just your
[1:41:11] words just by how you are and letting
[1:41:14] God flow through you you can make a
[1:41:16] difference you don't have to be a
[1:41:17] preacher you can make a difference just
[1:41:20] by being sweet and kind and what letting
[1:41:24] out that spirit you are now a veil of
[1:41:28] God you are hiding God let him out it's
[1:41:33] time for him to come out
[1:41:34] and reveal himself and make himself
[1:41:37] manifest the promise that the Holy Ghost
[1:41:39] has been bound for 2,000 years we have
[1:41:43] not seen the book of Acts for 2,000
[1:41:46] years like it should be it's time -
[1:41:51] we've been veiling them in long enough
[1:41:54] it's time for us to really buckle down
[1:41:56] die out so that he can live through us
[1:41:59] fully let's bow our heads say a word of
[1:42:03] Prayer

[1:42:46] Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Lord we want
[1:42:50] now as your prophet said we have to let
[1:42:52] this the spirit move we have to let them
[1:42:54] work and order the only way is to
[1:42:56] consecrate it to crucify that flesh
[1:42:58] daily
[1:43:00] not only the fleshly but our spirit
[1:43:03] realm that our will know God help our
[1:43:06] wills to die out Lord and we're serious

[1:43:51] is about ready to be rent again Lord the
[1:43:54] Bible says Lord when he comes we shall
[1:43:56] be like him or that full manifested
[1:44:00] nature that divine nature put on full
[1:44:04] effect again Lord displayed one more
[1:44:07] time for the world to see and their will
[1:44:11] be done not done in an open show Lord
[1:44:13] the world in general is gonna see it
[1:44:15] Lord he will Lord this bride will take
[1:44:17] over Lord and we want to be part of it
[1:44:20] Lord and or build our character Lord so
[1:44:23] we can handle this Lord said you
[1:44:26] wouldn't give us any more than we can
[1:44:27] handle Lord but I believe we can handle
[1:44:29] a lot so just bless every soul Lord for
[1:44:34] sitting through a little Cubs service
[1:44:36] Lord we love you so much granted Lord in
[1:44:38] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:44:41] Saints we want to be fully yielded I
[1:44:46] know I keep saying it and but and I
[1:44:49] don't even understand really what I'm
[1:44:50] saying what is this like what is full
[1:44:54] leadership of the Holy Ghost saints of
[1:44:57] God we're we're entering into our land
[1:44:59] we've never been to before in a time no
[1:45:02] other people have seen this time we're
[1:45:05] going into something we is the unknown
[1:45:09] we were not we were not the Prophet we I
[1:45:12] have no idea what it's like to live in
[1:45:14] another dimension the majority of my
[1:45:15] life I have no idea what crossing over
[1:45:20] is gonna be like the Prophet does not
[1:45:23] know what it's like to take a body
[1:45:24] change but saints of God we're going to
[1:45:27] experience this we're going into
[1:45:32] something I don't know what it's like I
[1:45:36] can't even imagine it but it's so
[1:45:40] important and if you look at the studies
[1:45:45] you look at how though the scripture
[1:45:47] goes it's gonna look like we're going
[1:45:48] right into death the death angel be
[1:45:55] standing right there
[1:45:56] you know God said I'll go walk right
[1:45:58] into it but there'll be a body change
[1:46:02] before he takes his swing we have to be
[1:46:10] very yielded our pastor really cam has
[1:46:14] been he's been hammering dying and
[1:46:16] rotting we need to killing out for eight
[1:46:19] or nine years now and I'll be honest
[1:46:23] this flesh gets tired of hearing it
[1:46:27] because what the next day I gotta go to
[1:46:29] work
[1:46:29] I have to go labor and sweat and get cut
[1:46:33] and tired and beaten and worn out and
[1:46:36] here I'm yielding to my job I'm yielding
[1:46:39] to my boss and not the Holy Ghost where
[1:46:42] is the balance how do this is the
[1:46:44] balance I want where is the fine balance
[1:46:47] on how to live this life and let God
[1:46:49] live out of you that's the hard part
[1:46:54] amen brother do you have a song for us
[1:47:00] if anyone has prayer
[1:47:02] needs prayer healing touch and answer
[1:47:05] our God is still able he's here where
[1:47:09] were two or three are gathered there I
[1:47:10] am in the mist he's here he's faithful

[2:00:04] has to match Christ brother Graham said
[2:00:07] the ministry of the bride must match the

[2:00:43] just like it cuz it's Christ in the
[2:00:45] bride cuz we don't have a ministry
[2:00:47] without Jesus he's gotta be in us or we
[2:00:50] don't have a ministry by now to beat him
[2:00:53] working the same ministry that he did on
[2:00:56] the earth that's what he's doing praise
[2:00:58] God
