TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you maybe not some pictures but some things I want to show you by God's grace I'm not going to sing thank you so much for the the playing that sister Toba playing the uh beatbox there wow fantastic wow skills amen so um let's see I don't know if I plugged into the right one or not there's two of them down here let's see I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend I had I went into hibernation mode yesterday uh sometimes you work work work and you work work work and then I was scheduled to work with my brother yesterday and I slept in went and got our little dog combed over and pred up and then came home and I took a three- hour nap and then woke up took another three and a half hour nap then uh woke up stayed up till about midnight studying then went right back to sleep so that's uh believe that's tired try to be try to be uh rested up one of the keys and as you getting a little bit I'm not old but I'm getting older and we see those things powerfully affecting our Our Lives HDMI oh does this maybe it does yes it does absolutely praise Lord amen thank you brother Jess powerful so um this is just something I uh I think brother Harley actually already heard this by pris I trust it'll be a blessing to you again this has been really uh Bruning on my heart there uh when I was there brother at uh the church there was it the good sheep or good flock I think they in was it sheep F Fellowship in nvar Ohio wonderful brothers wonderful Saints um Warriors pressed out sacrificed everything for the word of God so we'll see if this will connect here by God's grace a lot of times lately I've heard brother Bram saying man I wish I had a Blackboard I wish I had a chalkboard and sometimes I you can actually hear him writing on there and doing this and this and I'm like I'm more of like a I like the PowerPoint myself and U you have a direct HDMI USBC oh absolutely all right praise the Lord oh praise the Lord Lord amen there's our picture of our Lord and savior there um I can't think of anything else want to share uh just keep our assembly in prayer we got a lot of sickness and things attacking and uh we know one thing the devil does not attack for no reason when the enemy look at look at Israel look at Hamas they they're attacking for a reason there's a there's a motive and objective behind them right now Hamas and the huies and whoever else in Iran there's a reason they're attacking him uh so we know the the devil's not going to have his way but uh certainly the Lord will only give them what they can handle that's one of his promises by God's grace so let's get in here let's stand for the reading word uh trust I wasn't too long there um uh I'd like to turn to Genesis 6 verse 5 Genesis 6 verse5 um I have a lot of confidence in the Bible an extreme if it's in the scripture and you can be proved we are laying our souls on it amen after one of my uh uh naps yesterday my wife was listening to brother one of brother Jesse's uh videos there and I woke up right at the time where he was reading the quote where the ram said he said he says my opinions are not infallible and I said there it is again but he said what he says this Bible is infallible amen this is why I have so much this is not just any other book this is a we can have full confidence we can rest on this word on the scripture oh even if the prophet said he my my my opinions my thoughts are not in Saints of godallah just think about what he when he was wondering about the that cloud and uh and or like he was he was dealing with that cloud in Revelations one where Jesus is head and he and he thought you know what I'll call Brother Jack Moore and he's a great Theologian and he'll tell me and then what he what brother Jack Moore told him just didn't sit right with him but he did if you look at what happened brother Ram didn't try to figure it out he said Lord he says what is the truth he say then the Holy Spirit revealed to me see so we can't figure things out we can't figure this out with our own minds we have to wait on the spirit of God to reveal it right in here and then show it back in the scripture and I think that's a phenomenal thing there by God's grace amen here let's let's jump into this here Genesis uh 6 verse5 he says and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord uh that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart amen let's turn to Luke 187 for our last portion here Luke 18 and 7 let's read uh verse 2-8 Luke 182 through 8 well let's let's read verse one to because it's Parable and he spake a parable unto them in in to this end that men ought to always to pray and not to faint there we are saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said with in himself though I fear not God nor regard man but because this Widow troubleth me I will venture lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen let's say a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you Lord we come before you Lord God humble Lord and Lord Jesus Lord we want you to have full control of the service Lord God we want you to guide our minds our thoughts God our actions God lord all that we are Lord Lord we want to give you full control Lord we want to yield to your spirit Lord God lord and Lord be we trust Lord you'll be pleased God Lord with the things Lord that will come out Lord and Lord Jesus Lord we ask a blessing upon this assembly God Lord this uh group of Band of Warriors here God spiritual Soldiers god Lord striving for masteries God of All Things Lord God and yet Lord God lord we know in ourselves we can't do it but Lord that's why you gave the very life that was in your blood God and Lord Jesus Lord we're thankful for those things Lord thank you God Lord we pray Lord you increase God lord your strength in US Lord God increase our faith God lord increase God lord all that you are Lord give us wisdom Lord give us discernment Lord give us all that all the gifts Lord we want in our lives God everything you have for us we want God operating fully God lord Lord there's no hindrance God no shorts in the circuits God lord nothing to ground us out but Lord Jesus Lord we want to be fully set aside for you God operating perfectly God lord uh being the obedient dream wife Lord God that you had Lord in your mind God before the foundation of the world God and they'll be with this uh group here God lord I want to always come before Lord an assembly God lord wherever they whoever they may be Lord Lord in my mind Lord view viewing them God in knowing Lord they are the Bride of Jesus Christ and Lord Jesus Lord be with them Lord today be with us God lord and Lord we love you so much Lord bless the people God Lord bless the hearing of this word god break it open Lord just Simplicity God lord and Lord Jesus Lord we love you in the name of Jesus Christ amen may have your seats there uh hope that wasn't too long prayer we just uh um I sometimes I I was a science major in in college I really enjoy science I don't fully understand a lot of things they bring out now uh The Depths and all those sort of things in fact I I was just happy to get through the the classes uh but I love it I might not be a scientist of my own right but when I see something scientific in aligns with the word of God I just just got to hit it because uh I'll say like this the only way I could even teach anything is if I actually I I see it you know you see it you may not you might I might we might not have the full understanding of the almighty God because in him dwelt all the all the knowledge all the intellect all the all the smartness all the things that God has they're in his mind but what he does give us SS of God we want to cling on to amen and SS of God if we be Eagles how how strong are those eagle claws amen right if when that when that when that eagle flies down let's say in Lake ER me me and my wife wi it when wi uh witnessed it one time we were on Kelly's Island and the eagle came down on the very tip the north part of the island and grabbed the fish right in front of us Brother Andy sister Lindsay were there the dogs were there watching and here we see but those claws were strong enough to dive into that water push through the water grab that fish latch on and it just flew on and had a little nice uh uh dinner itself there by God's grace so but they say that the Eagle's claw has so much pressure it can Crush vertebrae it can Crush spines it can Crush bones that kind of pow and SS of God if we be spiritual Eagles saints of God we can grab onto the word and we should be able to grab onto the Holy Ghost we should be able to grab grab on to God himself and not let go amen much like Jacob wrestling over what over he needed a blessing he says Lord I'm not going to let you go until I see a blessing come upon my life amen and thanks to God that's how we should be when it comes down to what troubling times when when when there something Rises up you don't know how to deal with when you see a giant like David did he never David fought a lion and a bear he never fought a giant this time but this time what he had to dig deep and say Lord God I'm trusting in you because because just like like that bear and that lion what this Giant's going to fall amen why because he caught the Revelation that Not only was the bear and the lion uncircumcised but that Philistine was also uncircumcised as well amen praise be to God Amen so uh we went to get in these things by God's grace uh we trust this will be a blessing um and I think this is where a lot of the overcoming will be by by these thoughts right here and I'd like to to uh speak on the power of thoughts hallah because everything is right there everything lays right here and I trust this so be a blessing now SS of God we know um by the by the Revelation SS of God I like this in what other age did people understand these things David didn't understand things Moses Abraham didn't know understand these things God had to come directly to them they were look they were forefathers they were the prophets they were what they were men God used in such powerful ways that they were what this they they were the example of Jesus Christ in fact when God joined with them they were living out the Life of Christ right so powerful and SS of God in this day what the Lord is now harnessing to us he's he's what drawing n to us he's filled us and what now we're living out Parts each one of us live out parts of Christ's life amen in in in one aspect or another these sort of things but saints of God the battle now as I heard heard the prophet God said he says he said the war in heaven started between what Jesus Christ and Michael the Archangel or or I'm sorry Satan and and uh Jesus Christ so here there's the war up in heaven right all these things and Satan we know took onethird of the angels and and and then uh of course God rose up and then uh he he cast Satan down and brother bam said he says the war that started Heaven he says now that war he says dwells within your minds he said that war up in heaven now is not literally in the Physical Realm where we're seeing swords and guns and bows and ARs and those sort of things but what he's what God said he's the prophet of God said he said what he says now it's what within the very minds of your soul right in right in the midst of the individual right in the individual person is where these battles will be right sure so here we see in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 he says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so all three of these Realms gots to be what blameless they you you you you have to be what say Lord God well my body I've kept my body this way and I I I've been this clean and Lord I won't do this and I won't do that my hands are clean my mind's clean those sort of things but everything must be clean he says be preserved blameless amen so here's what we're dealing with right we we all know the these things brother Jesse sure sure has taught extensively on these things uh but here we have the body realm the spirit realm and the Soul realm faith and doubt and of course the predestinated SE Gene of God that dwells what within the children of God within the children of the most high amen so right here s to God that battle that was in heaven right in Genesis 1:1 all the way through two or however wherever that whenever that took place in between chapters 1 and three in between there there was a battle saints of God maybe it was even just before right at Genesis 1:1 who knows when the battle took place up in heaven exactly but we know for certain now the battle that was up there is now right here this is your War right here if you can see this is the war it what in the spirit realm amen amen saints of God now notice reasoning memory affections conscience and Imagination Saints of this is where this is where Satan will use these things against you amen right this is but remember this is also God not here here's here's it's taught a lot of times like this oh Satan can can bring you and and sear your conscience with a hot iron and then then if you do this again A lot of times when you're a child and the the children say don't lie God's watching you but watch the first lie bring forth out of a child and what they they say oh I didn't get killed right away the lightning did not come from heaven and strike me right then I must be okay I must God must see I must have Grace on me or he doesn't care maybe he didn't see it however and then that child will lie again and lie again why because now this conscience and as he tells another lie his conscience gets less and less and less and fin it's like I don't have any I can we can lie right to your face right and then we have an imagination and say oh maybe God doesn't see it or we imagine God is like oh he's he's over off doing something else he's not paying attention to me so we always a lot of times hear these things being used of Satan but Saints of God's God has full access to these things as well amen we've got to remember these things were not built for Satan these things were built for God for to use in your life amen now now notice this is Jesus did not God say hey come let us reason together what the word of God Amen not not not in the Catholic church or not in this he says but what in the word of God that's where we're to reason what with the Holy scriptures with the absolute with the infallible word of God the Bible uh that God has written now notice also in the memory realm what we want to notice that what as David that David's going against that Philistine his in his memory God used his memory at that time and brought it back to all the creatures that bear in that line that what he had he had conquered already and he said he said if God can do it bringing you God was harnessing in memory right and says look I've already done this back there seting what's before me can go down as well amen and then of course the affection now remember David in that same spot he he he loved what the Sheep of God his his father's sheepo he loved he wanted to protect the Sheepfold and in that he said I love my father so much I want to protect his flock and he went and slew that bear and that lion and then here now before that when that giant came up then he saw what what David loved what the people of God as well remember if he had a shepherd's heart he he he he wanted to protect and I love it SS and sounds David again I have to bring that up again uh just I love how how that the mother there was singing said he say Jus and you can't she says you can't lose one that was trained and trained what in the mind of David by Hallelujah supposedly his mother uh that what he's got to defend these Sheep amen praise God and then when here now we see that Goliath rise up David now by the love he says he says I don't want any of my brothers to die he I believe I'm anointed I'm the one that's going to take on that giant and that Giants got to fall why because he didn't want anyone else to fight he didn't want anyone else want to go down what he had his affections were for Israel his affections were what for the king his affections were to prove that God was the almighty God that what he was to conquer amen he can defeat anything and anyone at any time amen so all of these things what can be harnessed by God what for his kingdom what in you praise the Lord yes absolutely and that's what we want to be mindful of today what is all these things right here this is the Battleground right here now notice this depending on how the devil t attacks now remember he can attack from all kinds of Realms he can attack on your flesh and when he attacks your flesh in certain kinds away through lust or Temptation or sickness or disease those sort of things these these trials right here that affect your flesh can impact this that's right yes sir and if he can't get you there to doubt the word of God In the Flesh he'll attack your spirit realm to what to attack these things and a lot of these things are the if you go through and listen to the discernment lights and discernment discernment lines of brother brandham if you look at he said a lot of these physical things were because of this and here that's right brother yes sir yes sir oh you just got a nervous spirit and yet they were having stomach issues they're having physical ailments because of the nervousness of what the time what he said it was a neurotic age amen SS of God everyone knows we're at the End Amen sure just talk to someone on the job site they're prepping with this and they're prepping with that and saints of God they are getting nervous they see this they see that they comeing why is Israel why is Russia everything's what we have two Wars now right now just smoldering yes if you could see if we had ability to see right here we just see the smoke from uh Ukraine and Russia we see the smoke in Israel those areas we just see this the burning the burning but SS of God this thing's going to light one of these days we've want to be in in the word of God Amen now I haven't got very far now let's see here this is very important this quote is very very important because this goes right back to the the scripture he says now our Eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear amen amen he says but it's determined by what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear in other words what the decision we make by what we see and hear the decision we make of how we feel on this or feel that s of God our decisions must come back to this word of God remember the Bible says what it'll be so close in this last days that'll be deceive the very elected right he says but what so we can't go by what our thoughts by uh uh by our imaginations by any of those sort of things he says but we have to ask God for discernment on these things Lord what is right here Lord what is right here Lord God give me the answer what lot times when we need to fast and pray but sweat it out just like the prophet did we got to what sweat these things out SS of God until we can say here it is thus sayth the Lord right in the scripture amen now notice now notice what was the danger here he says what now notice he says how if you see your brother off off the word if you see your sister off the word yes do we forget that they are children of God do we forget that they have the same holy ghost that you have amen or do we do we forget that they are children of God Amen because remember the scripture says Paul was not disputing uh with them on from the communion their act was right but their discernment was wrong for the taking of the Lord's Supper is the Commandment of the Lord but to take it unworthily not Discerning the Lord's body right what does he say right here and the body of the Lord is the believer saints of God so in our thoughts no notice how do we discern thing in our thoughts yes right here in our mind our mind is always constantly thinking right now you are either thinking I'll say it like this a lot of times people don't get anything out of the service because what their minds are what somewhere else you could be sitting right there looking directly in my face going like this and yet your mind has went off and drifting off well you know tomorrow I've got to do so and so oh you know after service I'm G to go get some Chipotle or maybe I'll get some Mexican food sure absolutely some street tacos somewhere if I can find a little pull behind cart absolutely but SS of God we've got to what keep our mind focused on the word of God the house of God right here this house this gathering together is for nothing but what to seek the W the Lord to hear the word if you pull you'll hear from the word of God Amen you will hear from Heaven sure but sints of God to take you have to what get in the spirit of it amen if you go I'm sure brother Jesse and the family yesterday went and saw a lot of people get in the spirit watching them Foos balls watching watching The Big Iron the big grid iron right there F guys and dress pads and helmets and all throwing footb balls and kicking footballs and tackling and dropping each other down and all sort of things what they had to get in the spirit it was really cold out yes they're going running full speed dropping people right they were in the spirit this the fans are jumping yay yay yay yay absolutely go touchdown how we want more we want more right all those sort of things right sure what when they were getting in the spirit but if you take them to church they'll be that's right God Bless you that's right maybe they won't even say Amen maybe they won't even raise their hands saints of God remember we don't serve a football we just serve what the great the creator of heavens and earth amen and he's coming back looking for a bride who's not ashamed to get in the spirit of himself Amen to get in his spirit amen to get in the spirit of the husband amen I tell like this when a man comes down when a man gets home from work he's all tired wore out brother Jesse's bu some you know 300,000 kids running I mean I don't know all I know is plumbing and pipe fighting sure but when you get home from work you're just tired you're exhausted and then what what would be what would be one thing you would like to see your wife right at the door your children at the door saying hey Daddy how you doing God bless you oh we love you we miss you thank you so much we're so glad you're home we're thankful absolutely what then that time the family the wife would be what getting the spirit with the husband amen sure trying to let him feel welcome in this house trying to feel have him feel welome welcome at his arrival what from the work work area from The Vineyard sure bringing something home to eat bring bringing the cash flow home amen sure now like I said I want to speak on the power of your thoughts because this is going to this plays everything right here what brother say brother said he said he said he said if you want to uh he says the right mental attitude for any promise of God he say will produce it I'm s PR paraphrasing but if you can get that right mental attitude what you talking about in the thoughts if you thinking it's going to take place it will s to God what is faith believing already knowing what is going to take place amen when you when you have a need in your life you say what if I get sick I'm already healed amen I just got to wait this thing out but what I'm already healed sure absolutely now look at this here's the Wicked Man the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God I'll say like this SS Godot when I hit the bar B of my Barrel in life in the spring I think actually I hit the bottom Barrel the spring of 99 and I was sitting in a certain kind of bar with two of my fraternity Brothers I'm sitting there I lost so much already in my life and what I thought was very very important very essential in my life all my plans all my and I one here one here and I said guys this is the lowest I ever been and what they do they laughed right in my face and I'm sitting there drinking my beer and I'm like wow good buddies and at that point SS of God I had to make a decision am I going to continue on with these two guys who I'm at the least the lowest in my spot and they don't even care or do I have to go with something else I realize in my life I can't control one thing there's not one thing I have full control over not a thing you can't even control your emotions half the time someone cuts you off in the in the traffic or someone does this or this you get so there's like a little fire that burns up and you're like that guy I can't believe wait a second I got to control that because how do we know what that man went through or that woman went through this morning that made him cut you off maybe they're running behind a work maybe they just got this or that maybe their husband did this or their wife did that and their children were out of all ra SS of God give Grace to everyone and especially give grace to the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because if you don't and you take that communion things take place sickness hits death hits that's right sickness hits and death hits because you do not discern who you're dealing with yes sir thank to God you we've become too common to ourselves have you been too do you understand who you are and who your brother and sister are do you understand that you are we in that time of the Rapture when we go up by the grace of God you're going to look at one another I'll see brother amen and brother Jesse and all the brother Arley all these all these all the sisters right here what be look it's like oh my goodness why we're going to have a lot of regrets but we want we've got to get those things under the blood right now make sure that your thoughts are just pure towards your brothers and sisters make sure there is no root of bitterness not one thing you can say listen this SS of God and the devil may be showing you many many things about your brother and sister that you you have a lot of ammo on right but you keep that to yourself amen yes sir what's that man you can talk about me as long as as much as you please but I'll talk about you when I'm down on my KNE you just talk to the Lord Jesus Christ you go to the great father if you see one of the father's Sons out of line say Lord Jesus help them Lord and I believe the Lord will honor your prayer look at look at David and Saul Saul's David oh the son of Jesse the son of Jesse he's always this this but if you look at David said don't hurt God's anointed do not do one thing against God's anointed and are you the anointed of God absolutely you have to be anointed to hear this word you have to be anointed to be sitting here this morning saints of God you are the bride of Christ amen you are the one chosen to hear elected to hear this word amen sure now notice now know the wicked said he says though the the wicked though through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God how come the saints of God when you need help when something goes wrong in your life what the first thing you do is say Lord God you sayl Lord what did I do you what you know you know where the problem can stem from you know the things that what a lot of times we reap what we've sown so make sure you sow only good seed amen what speak good things do good things do good works amen praise God all the time and be exous Lord for his kingdom amen yes he says look he says but God is not in all of his thoughts doesn't say some he says but God he says God is not in all his thoughts it might be in some might be in a quarter of them maybe a tenth maybe even 75% what because now we're dealing what religious what's the most wicked one right there is one that seems religious not the Heathen it's what the Judas is it's the ones of false Believers those are the most wicked right there because they're pretending to be something that they're not amen he says but God is not in all their thoughts SS of God that's why we got to weigh all of our ways that's but the scripture talks about thoughts and intents yes thoughts remember the intents lie within the thoughts why would I do let's say you're going through life and something takes place and you have to make a decision let's say there's two people to help someone both asking for money at the exact same time and now we need what a discernment who really needs it more am I going to help the one that's nicer dressed or let's say there's a man and a woman am I going to help the woman because I'm a man and trying to bring influence or you know you know what I'm saying carnal nature carnal things but we've got to find the mind of God on these things remember what we see is not real what we think and say like this in ourselves is not real this is the only real thing let every man let every man be a liar but God's word be true see there's a brother just uh a little bit ago he said brother Simon he goes I was ready to just quit being a Christian this this but you could not tell it by his Covenant I saw him he was smiling he this give me the big hug and this and that he was just ready to quit he was the last person in my mind that I thought was battling but guess what he said brother goes yesterday I was about ready to quit he says but today he said God gave me strength see just because someone looks like they're oh they're the superch Christian they got the anointing there they feel great man this guy this brother's never down sints of God you better pray for everyone pray for the one you wouldn't even think to pray for pray for it say God lord who should I pray for today because you'll the thoughts will come into your mind like who you're like what pray for that one that brother that sister Hallelujah a lot of people show it on their face but some people don't show it on their face amen now let's continue here I love this David giving his advice to Solomon he says now Solomon son my son he says know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart he says and with a willing mind and the Lord searches All Hearts every heart is searched here this morning all of our hearts God searches he's here right now the Bible say where two or three in the midst here I am in the midst right amen amen yes he's walking these aisles right now he's where wherever he's at I can't see I'm not I'm not a prophet I don't see the pill of fire walking and this that the light he's but is checking the very thoughts and intents of our hearts right now Hallelujah everything is weighed every motive every move the way you approach this person the way you approach this person God knows your motives but the things the saints of God we just have to have good motives the reason when we make a decision is what because we want to see God glorified we want to see good things for our brother we want to see good things for our sister amen we want to encourage and lift up what an edify each one of them amen you want to and and Lord and brothers and sisters display yourself as a good good example be a good example Hallelujah by that you can conquer amen what that's that takes Divine love to do it sure he says and the Lord searches all the hearts and understandeth all the imagination of the thoughts if thou seek Him He will be found of thee he said but if thou forsake Him He Shall cast thee off forever he knows why why why are you being a Christian one of the most one of the recently brother Cam's been preaching uh well it probably three months ago it was beautiful in John 6 remember Jesus fed the thousands the 5 thousands or how it was how many thousands with some fish and some loaves of bread Jesus saw they were tired and he said he said what do we have brothers he said we just have a couple Loaves and a fish and God said tell them every sit down he started praying over the food and he just started dividing it and he fed the entire congregation how how many baskets like 12 10 baskets however they pulled up there's two accounts I believe and they pulled up the baskets and Lord's just like look look at all we have left over remnants fragments and directly after that Jesus and his disciples depart and the Bible said that what God went across the the River or the Sea and the Bible says those people that were fed said where is Jesus we've got to go to him we've got to find him and they took ship as well and went oversea and they found him in on our minds we're like wow these guys are converts they're willing to cross Land and Sea to find Jesus wow look at that they that cost them money that cost them effort that cost them time they're putting their lives in Jeopardy because we know the Tempest of the wind and the Sea can come up and sink a ship just like that right but when they come in front of Jesus he discerned he knew their thoughts and intents of the heart they said what he he said what he says are art thou not here because of the food not because of the Miracles you're literally here because I fed you yes sir brother Cam's preaching that he said he are we here are we serving the lord Jesus Christ in this message for what material things for the blessings amen are we here just for the blessings of God the benefits right SS of God well let's say like this we all come out we had to sacrifice yes sir but saints of God it was for Christ and for his word we love the truth hallelujah than God there's nothing like being sure that this word is right there's nothing like seeing this run from Genesis to Revelations nothing like what seeing God's life come up out of us and break the bread of life to us and say oh my goodness I see it it's beautiful amen this is what I say this that's the only times a lot of times in your walk you don't even feel like a Christian you don't feel like man am I even a Christian man I just heard this rock and roll song I just heard this song I was playing back in the 90s I loved and I'm and I'm just like battling not to sing along or even to enter into that right or or you you or you hear a cuss word and that word just revolves around your head constantly all day long oh my goodness SS of God are we even Christians and then sometimes what we get to witness for like 10 minutes five minutes and SS of God in those five minutes you feel like this is where I am this is who I am right here this is re this is reality this is what I want to do all my life is what be an example be a witness for Jesus Christ amen hallelujah right praise the Lord yeah Glory he says so SS of God he says God understandeth all the imagination the understanding of the thoughts and intents look here it says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he who do you think you are you have to say I am by the grace of God the bride of Christ Hallelujah I believe that I am I was chosen I was elected when you heard baptism the truth on it when you heard the truth on godhead when you've seen signs one those miracles SS of God there had to be some spiritual Amnesia you start coming out of Amen even in John the Baptist what the Bible what the prophet the Bible says what his eyes got all waxed over and just just calloused up what because he he couldn't even see who Christ was anymore he was such in a bad spot Saints but he did not have the filling of the Holy Ghost now he had the Holy Ghost Anointed with him always but saints of God in that time he wack those eyes glazed over he could not recognize who he was SS of God but nonetheless he knew he was he just Di who Christ was Saints but saints of God you've got to know who you are amen and if you don't know believe until he reveals who you are SS of God he will show you it'll be shown right in the scripture yes Hallelujah when you hear the word of God something inside you says amen that's right when you know it's right amen absolutely sure yes absolutely if you think you're the weakest Christian that's what you'll be if you think well I'm almost as good as say uh sisters there you know sister's such a light in the church and this and that I'm almost as good as her then you'll you'll be almost as good as her but if you catch the mind that I am mrss Jesus Christ that I I am going to be and am right now because think about the mind of God are you the bride of Christ now or what back in the Rapture in the future Rapture you're the bride of Christ right now that's right because remember in the mind of God when it was revealed to John what he was already he God had already judged Leo deia he said there would already be Overcomers there's going to be Overcomers in this age why because almost 2,000 years ago Christ said there was Overcomers that means you have to find yourself that you are an overcomer this morning amen if you are Overcomer then then you are right there that's what you'll be right if you believe you're going to be an Ephesian that's what you're going to be whatever you think you are is what you'll be so saints of God elevate your minds elevate your thoughts this morning realize that God has called you and chos in you what to not only not only receive the word but receive his spirit and not only receive his Spirit but SS of god what have his Spirit work and build the full stature of a man in you you will reach all of it SS of God you will be the Pinnacle amen the Bible says in Psalms he says sorry in Song of Solomon he says he says daughters have done virtuously he says but thou excelth them all saints of God who was that for that was what for the bride in this last day amen all the other Ages were coming to what we were they were all they were all building to this Prophet God said the only reason they didn't get it is because they couldn't live long enough that's right that's right if Luther would to Liv 500 years he'd be here right now if Wesley would to lived 500 years they'd be here right now why because they had the Revelation they caught the Revelation for their day and they would I guarantee you because that's scriptural they would have walked from light to light to light amen from Faith to Faith from glory to glory SS of God they would have been here today amen huah absolutely sure why because on Rapture Day they'll be there they just catch up they all slow down we'll speed up here we are God bless you brother amen yes sir amen now I'm getting to some things here wow we got a long way to go I'm already 38 minutes in you guys all right every we all okay all right praise the Lord now he says the thoughts of the righteous are right he says but the counsels of the wicked are deceit so if you're righteous your thoughts our thoughts as we continue to grow in God our thoughts should be more and more lining up with the word of God yes our our wills and desires should be lessening yes well I've got this and I've got this plan I'm remember that Rich Young Ruler he said want to be bilder bigger Barns and build bigger this and this what to increase all his saints of God that's not the that's not the mind of God in this age right what the mind of God in this age is L what is is John the Baptist was the perfect example he says he says I must decrease but he must increase do you want to see an increase in the spirit of God in your life this year coming up absolutely saints of God we need more of him amen we're not like those that are blind and Leo DEA that think we've got it all figured out in this the saints of God we're coming what we are in desperate need of a refilling amen we are in desperate need what of more of him we want more of him what what because in him is life amen and life more abundantly amen hallelujah would you rather have a million dollars or get a refilling of the Holy Ghost watch your thoughts in intense the refilling of the Holy Ghost ghost because there's nothing like it I said it here before my one of the guys I work with he's made some good money he said brother Simon he he didn't call me brother he Simon he goes I'm more miserable now than when before I had money he says because I'm always worrying about it but remember that's what it chokes out the cares of this life choke out choke out if your mind's always consumed about this thing so God he chokes it out now if the Lord blesses you financially fine that's great if not so be it what we're moving on anyhow we are moving on what because I I I I like this I I love these Revelations ask my wife I go to any Bible study I can I will teach the same things over and over to new Believers and over and over and over why because I think these are the most valuable things I can give them these Revelations are you kidding me to know the to you know SS of God it comes to the you have the Revelation that there's an evil Spirit Satan is watering and how does he do it what through thoughts false doctrines all these sort of things what through the great Babylon but SS of God we have the answers yes we know what's truth and what's wrong and we can show we can introduce what what what we do in a Bible study what we do in a service what we're introducing truth to the people and now they have to make a choice and where they make that choice in their hearts their thoughts absolutely did some good witnessing this week hit some things with a gentleman and he's very quiet on things no not much response but tell you what the ball's in his court now Hallelujah now he's got to make a decision amen Proverbs 1533 35 or Proverbs 1525 he says the Lord will destroy the house of The Proud but he will establish the border of the Widow he says the thoughts of the wicked are an Abomination to the Lord he says but the words of of the pure are pleasant words thoughts notice the fals have thoughts that are completely wrong and then the the what the righteous have the right words to say hallelujah now here's the here's the danger and and we all battle this I mean I'm I do we all battle but the D the danger of a hypocrite is what to think one thing one way but then when you say something it's AB contrary to what you're thinking right your affections toward a brother or sister are not where it should be and yet when you confront them you're like oh that's dangerous because sints of God our mouths brother said don't ever be a hypocrite right he said I I respect he said I respect the man in the bar drink until he gets drunk what because he's who he is and he's not ashamed of what he's doing amen why because that's what's in him that's what he is that's who he is but s to God as Christians SS of God we must be what Who We Are Who the word says we are we should be who our thoughts and hearts say we are amenallah yes that's exactly right sure yes absolutely the thoughts of the wicked are an Abomination to the Lord but the words of the pure are pleasant words sure we are wow so let me let me let me speed up here by the grace of God I want to show you something look what brother Ram says here he says the Eternal thoughts of God he says let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things he says God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior he says we have studied that he says and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he is God he said uh he must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he's not now learning anything nor is uh is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say that is sometime he will be he says but that is anything because he says but that is not scriptural he is omnicient he has never had a new thought about anything about his thoughts amen he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal he says and they are real Hallelujah yes sir why are you here that's that you know for the first time in like 20 years I finally brother Ram brother Ram said he says he says I think the natural birth he says conception is more mysterious than Jesus's birth and this year the Revelation truly struck because you have all these J was going after that egg and all of a sudden this one is just there he is yeah God is literally handpicking yes you he handpicked you right he's the great scientist a lot of people you know they have these movies about mad scientists God's right here handpicking in each individual why are you here because God CHS you to be here you have a purpose and if his thoughts are real what does that make you amen say God you are a real son and daughter of God Amen this ain't make believe you God the Bible says what and Adam and and uh and uh ad of Seth was Adam and then Adam came out of what God you are direct direct lineage of God God literally God literally is your father yes sir he is your dad he's the one that brought you forth you have a SE seed within you and God placed that seed within you and made sure than to God that's that's the beautiful thing he like look at our parents and I you know I'm sure Bill Jesse shared some things but I don't know how my mom and dad ever fell in love I have no idea that worked but guess what it was ordained he was mixing Ruby Smith with snooky Smith Ruby garer with snooky Smith to what make what he wanted to make out of each one of them that's right each one of you was handpicked designed it may not have come the way you thought it should come but here you are amenl he said they are real they're not simply like a man with a blueprint that he's drawn up which one day will be translated to substance and form he said but they are already he said they are already real and eternal part of God you are the E eternal thought of God than hlu brother I I'm so sinful that's not because of God that's because of Adam and need think about you think who you were without all your sinful ways sinful thoughts well that's who I want to be that's who you are yes that's really who you are Hallelujah I always I always say Lord God when I get rid of this thing I'll be exactly how I want to be that'll be exactly what the very thought of God had in his mind before the foundation word I'll be back to that amen amen yes let's continue on here by God's grace I want to show you something here we're we're at uh 50 minutes already let's let me jump here I got to jump because I want to show you something here by God's grace let me hit this right here look at this here Jeremiah 29:10 for thus sayi the Lord God that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon he says I will visit you for the Cam's been on this lately you know everything's hinging on Babylon that Temple right now everything's hinging on that when we see God starting turn back to the Jews and something that that Temple movement because here it was back in the Old Testament if it's in the new it's the same way look what he says he says for I know the thoughts that I have that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace he says not of evil to give you an expected endj well brother sa we have a squeeze to go through we have all this SS of God these he has good thoughts for you SS of God what if what if what if the three Hebrew boys would all would have been praying and the Lord opened their three eyes and gave him a vision of them being just about being thrown leg in the the the fire furnace like Lord please don't do it but if God would have continued to play that vision and they would have saw him in the midst they'd been like let's do it let's get let's go he's going to be there but saints of God see that well how how does that compare to this I have I have good thoughts towards you but in the midst of a circumstance it can look impossible it can look like you're staring what right in the shadow of death you can look right into Satan's eyes and say how I you do this but Lord but the Lord's right there he had an expected end where did those three Hebrew boys become a martyr they didn't where did Daniel become a martyr oh my goodness what God has what in the expected and for them saints amen and saints of God in this day there is not something there's something promised for us it's the Rapture it's the body change we have great promises yes sir what what the Bible the Bible said what Jesus said what it it'll be like Noah's day and lot lot's day the worst days on the face of the Earth combined and yet we have a rapture we have a body change when we when we catch that body that that that uh like this that rapturing faith when we catch that it'll all be worth it yes sir everything we have to go through from this point to before that Rapture will be worth it Hallelujah every single thing and then we move into eternity those things won't even be in our mind anymore we have arrived we can say I am just like our Lord and savior he is he I am too amen praise be to God what because now we are here existing forever with our Lord and savior amen amen hallu yes Lord amen that kind of Oneness now they were entering into a Oneness with him amen sure yes now look at this this quote here voices of many Waters fourth per P personage of him voice to many Waters how are you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when The Voice tonight is recorded he says your voice is recorded your thoughts are recorded as a man thinketh in his heart so is he notice your thought your voice is louder in heaven than I mean your thoughts are louder in heaven than your vo is on Earth certainly it is God knows the thoughts and intents of the heart he knows all about it yes what he say he says your thoughts are louder in heaven like I said before if you shake a Brother's hand sister's hand you still got something against them there's something there and you say oh and the out word looks like oh but God knows your thoughts are speaking the very things you're thinking are louder in heaven yes see that's where you comes to a service and you say well this brother isn't preaching what I wanted to preach today this thanks of God is not up to us yes this ain't have it your own way this ain't what you know I like this when you go to church and you think you're not hearing what you think you should be hearing you need to repent yes sir I say this when I go to church and I'm sitting in these seats or I'm sitting in these seats and I'm I'm saying Lord whatever you have for me is what I want you think I'm scared to get blasted I've been yelled by people my boss right in my face loud as can be you know what I took all of it and you take it all rebuke rebuke reprove long suffering and then something sometimes a lot of things edifying absolutely things I like sometimes God will give you hard things and it'll throw another a fresh Revelation which is what spiritual stimulation and man it just makes everything feel good Hallelujah and why would brother Bram say this your thoughts are recorded in heaven are louder like what he says here he say God's omn presence knows what you're doing even your thoughts one time when I was on a vision I was speaking to a being standing by me you know who told him that you know who told him that an angel and he said back he said your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is on the earth that's what the angel of God told Brother Bri good brother good that's why he kept repeating it because what he did not know that that was only given to what to this age the thoughts are louder in heaven what you think right now if I be quiet right now you are thinking something are you thinking about out there you thinking about what next are you thinking what God's going to do for you what are you thinking your thoughts right now are being recorded in heaven you can be completely silent for the next two days let's say let's say you go on a fast with no food what if you go a fast with no talking everything is still being recorded every thought every action even your action see that's why it's so dangerous in this hour look at the Bible says curse not the king nor in thy thought he says and curse not the rich in thy bed chamber for the bird of the air shall carry The Voice and that which hath Wings will tell the matter SS of God always think good things about everybody think the best things you can always be encouraging always saints of God it's being recorded every we forget a lot of times Everything's being recorded recorded all I have to do is put a phone up here put on record prop it up right here and you're being recorded the same thing that's happening already why do you think the television tape and movie all that was so so powerful because what it shows that things are recorded I met a bodyguard to uh a president for two terms and the next president for one term and he told me he said Simon he goes of course I was ask him every question I could think of because I'm that kind of guy I like to know some deeper things if I'm gonna ask God some deep things I can ask guy some deep things too that's just how he built me I'd like to know the mysterious things right isn't that Deuteronomy 29:29 sure absolutely now but he told me he said Simon he goes when you're in the white house he said no matter where you're at and he like literally emphasized no matter where you're at everything is recorded in that white house you are not private he said anywhere emphasis and we're we're not private anywhere anyhow that's why David had he said Lord he's even even even get these secret sins out anything even I don't even know about get all these secret everything out of me amen deliver me all oh God burn it all send that Holy Ghost with what baptism of fire to burn out anything that's not pleasing to him amen now let's continue on here now here's what I thought here's what I saw in uh in science if we can harness this so what during during the work with during the even later today and all through that what are we supposed to be thinking on what are our thoughts supposed to be here's here's a law it's called The Law of constructive interference or destructive interference these are waves see these waves and then look at the results here if the waves are the exact same frequency and they're not contrary but they hit perfect it amplifies the effect but if your thoughts and God's thoughts or God's word are at different frequencies it makes God the word of God unff see what Creeds and dogas do to God's word that's why we have to take everything back to the Bible if we can take all of our beliefs back to the word of godj do you see this look at this and they they the examples right here you go out to a completely still calm water body body water a pond Lake whatever and there's like no ripples nothing you take two rocks try to pick the same size and you drop them certain spots right across drop them the same time if they hit the exact same time same size he says once those ripples meet they'll go bigger and smaller smaller they'll have bigger tops and lower bottoms because what they hit frequency they hit the what uh uh continuity they hit what synchronization or the same thing they join they hit perfectly together and it amplifies what they are what's going to produce the third pole this or this Joshua the sun was going down and his Mighty Warriors his mighty battle were they were winning the battle in God saw in the mind of a God he knew they had need of light God said he said destroy them he how they going to do it in the dark God knew those things as soon as the thought came to Joshua that thought and God's thought connected and he spoke it out and look what take place SS of God do you see what this is brother BR coming down there's a snowstorm coming he's heading down the mountain and he hears a voice he hears a voice notice now look how patient God is he hears a voes turn around he's like oh he keeps going he hears it again turn around he turns around he's like what is this and God gives him time he kept this he kept this frequency right there just waiting he knew he was going to say it but he had to wait for it he had Grace he's what training his Prophet he's training his son and that that frequency was still there that word was still there waiting now he didn't come and go God waited for it he said Lord is that you lord said yeah he said go back into that he's like why he says well he said he just speak what you want and God waited for that he waited and brother R said he says I want this storm blizzard gone for three days I want to be sunshiny clear this is and in half an hour it took place but God was training his Prophet what to catch the word of God so what the prophet God could enter in and say the exact same thing that his that God said if we can harness this if we can latch on to this power this is third pole what was that that was third pole controlling what what was the second Adam doing what was the second Adam was demonstrating what that he could control nature they we are the sons of God we will be manifested once again but we've got they catch the mind of God and what speak the exact same thing that God impresses or gives an unction of the Holy Ghost yes Hallelujah I'll say like this in your IND each individual situation you're going through something whether it be small big Financial marital whatever religious what what you're all going through something but if we can go back in here in the Bible and find a scripture that has something to do with your life and you can find something to do with the problem you're dealing with and just start speaking that scripture out because remember does God want you to stay in that in that position or does he want you to be an overcomer he's God's mind says he wants you to be an overcomer amen he wants you to conquer all things so in this sort of things than of God if we start repeating the very scriptures he gave us the promises he gave us what that we that's one of these times when you say it it's going to strike it's going to be made manifest Glory just speak the word not in Hope because this isn't hope this is Faith this is the real this is real do you think there's going to be any books but the Bible in the Millennium really yeah it's going to be the word of God that's it everything else is going to be burned because this is this is the book that's his Eternal Word amen now let's continue I'll say this this is so powerful with good and with bad what took place right here they were in such one Accord he says in the whole earth was one language and of one speech they were all flowing at the same Antichrist frequency in fact I'll say this why does the serpent move like this looks like a doesn't it I think brother Jesse did a didn't you do a study on the the movements of the snake didn't you do that there's like five or six different I remember it years ago you did it and what each one of them snakes have a different frequency they move by Brother Jose says yeah that's right so what he said what these got all on the same mindset same language they were all in one Accord look at the power of unity look at the power of unity for good or bad it got so strong that what he said they let us go make us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered upon the whole face of the Earth than of God sounds like the eunic World Council churches he said the Lord came down to see the city and Tower which was the children of men builded and the Lord said behold this people is one they're one they're literally one frequency wow good they're one they all believe the exact same thing they all had the same common goal and when they got into that state look what the Bible says he even God admitted this God said this that's the power of the unity of be what in one Accord just like what what took for place for the uh what what had to happen for the book of Acts to take place they all to be in one place and in one Accord Hallelujah yes sir yes sir you see you see that it's coming to Oneness the last move is Oneness it can be Oneness with the world with the Antichrist or to be one with Christ yes sir he says and the Lord said behold this people is one and they have one language and this they will begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do look at the power of imagination and Oneness power imagination and Oneness do you think we can really go up and and Conquer God yeah I believe that really yeah okay cool they all start growing and growing in that and they that was their and they put their best scientists and mathematicians on the job they started come up with this and with this and with this and they started understanding the laws of physics and the laws of nature and all those sort of things and they come to a spot where God said that's what they can do they could do it but they had to get in one Accord do you think in the Tower of Babel they're like God Mercy scientist man why don't you work a little bit harder you know come on let's do this no they were all one ACC Court hey what you get what do you get today oh yeah that one equation yeah well this equation work with this one too we're going to get that guy they were in such Harmony they saw no fault with one another they were in that kind of Oneness saints of God when the BR the body of Jesus Christ can come back to that Oneness he's waiting for that Oneness and I'll say like this brother cam read a quote about month ago it blew my mind it was in Oneness one of the Oneness of sermons brother B said he says he said the reason God can't do he says it was literally the fall it was the fall of the Ephesian Church age it was the fall of the book of Acts what took place the Deeds of Nick leans they formed groups and separated when they broke that Unity where everyone's equal when no one thought themselves higher than the other when everyone was equal and oh here he's a minister praise the Lord be that min Min BL oh well this brothers are this and that and this brother and this sister got a gift of this and the sister this brother's got a gift of this but when they elevated themselves above as the clergy as the priesthood it broke the unity of God and the presence of God departed yes see what we got to do we've got to come back to where a minister yeah they're fivefold they're our servants absolutely that's what they are their servants they're gifts for you brother said he the pastor he was the love gift to the church gift not Lord gift but what we're all equal in one yesj there is no big ones or little ones SS of God that's the that's the unity we've got to come back to and when he when God sees that he'll he'll drop like we've never seen him before amen that's the word that's absolutely the word now look at this here we're at hour five just a little bit longer here by God's grace now look at it notice in Exodus I forgot the e there uh must have copy that wrong he said Thou shalt not C kill Thou shalt not commit adultery thou shal not steal thou sh not bear fall witness against thy neighbor Thou shalt not cover thy neighbor's house that cover thy neighbor's wife nor his maid servants nor ma maid servant uh man servant maid servant Ox anything like that right now that's in the natural or the Covenant to us not no but he's dealing with what he says a lot of these things take place in the natural but when Christ came on he says ye have heard them said by old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after has committed adultery with her in her heart already see he's dealing with thoughts because those thoughts deal louder than this just the desire then the even action was worse the desire was equal to the action right because you're already entertaining those things right amen of course the Bible says and he will what Jesus Christ came to what magnify the law and make it honorable he wants his bride is going to be what pure his bride will think lovely thoughts about every brother every sister because when it comes down to a sints of God up there when you go beyond the current time that's all we are as brothers and sisters there's no marriage over there there would be that little special somebody but that's it I mean when brother R went over there here comes hope he what you say oh Bill she said our precious brother hugged him took off hadn't seen him for how many years 50 40 years 30 years can't seem special someone but she hugged them and moved on and all everyone else started hugging him too so you didn't say no this one's mine this is mine no would like that yes sir let's Elevate our thoughts up here Heavenly places hallelujah amen now let me continue on here by God's grace almost done here by God's grace let's he look what Christ said he say say uh Matthew 1233 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit he says oh Generation V vipers how can you being evil speak good things see how can you have evil thoughts and yet out of out of your mouth says good things right that's the difference is the thoughts is what what are they really are is what is in here not what comes out of the mouth very good very good and yet the Bible what Jesus said he says that what goes in but cometh out with defileth a man because with the what comes out of a man doesn't match his thoughts or his Compassion or the his love is obviously off the word it's a lie he says a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you every I that Every Idle Word that a man shall speak shall he he shall give account thereof on the day Every Idle Word on the day of judgment amen now almost done I want to I want to finish here by God's grace I want to show you something here there's an experiment and this is literally one of the things that blew my mind how many want the the presence of the Lord to be with you all the time just the other day or last last Sunday it was at it was at uh in nvar at the service there and you know sometimes you get down on yourself or you start doubting yourself I was I can't remember if I was praying in the car while my wife was driving or if I when I got to the church I started praying on the you I said Lord God I'd like to know that that I'm not that you're with me but I'm with you and I'd already picked the sermon I already had it what I thought and then there goes up brother Levi behind this and he literally he literally used the exact same scriptures I was using in the middle the middle of my service where sermon where I was going to go he was using exact same scriptures but it was from a different angle I was looking from this angle he's looking from this angle but it's the exact same thing and I'm just like Lord I want to be with you I'm not interested in myself Lord what what do you want me to do where do you want me to be I want to be where you go that was that was the that was the Old Testament Saints right there they were led by what the pillar of fire uh By Night and the cloud by day SS of God they had to be with him he doesn't follow you sints of God even though the signs shall follow he said but what we've got to follow God Amen we've got to follow the anointing the Holy Ghost amen we got the fin of moving in the spirit so what I'm trying to say here is that I want to show you the power of your thoughts and let me ask you a question what is what is on your scale of intelligence what is more intelligent a puppy or a chick sister Haven you would know what would be more intelligent a chick or a puppy there was an experiment done in 1988 and a scientist took he made a little robot and Back in 88 that was pretty intense for robots that can move you know and he programmed it to go randomly to move forward right or left and that was the whole thing and he set a little box he uh a rectangle putting a rectangle rectangle enclosure he put it there and he put a little pencil on the bottom of this robot and he turned the robot on it just started it started moving right and they call now obviously they call this uh psycho Kinesis but we know this is thoughts okay the power of the thought and what he did next was he took a little incubator egg and he hatched this egg and he put this baby chick one day old baby chick in with this robot and turn the robot on and that chick according to science that whatever that chick sees is its mother the first thing so that chick would follow this robot just you know pecking wherever that robot went that chick was that chick went and they let it go for days so that chick was just they put feed you know and the chick would eat but he would always follow that mother that mother robot and the next portion of the the the experiment was this they cleaned everything up put a new sheet of paper in put it in that rectangle and they took the chick out and put the chick in a cage so that chick could see that robot and they turn that robot on and I want to show you the results this is before the chick and look how the thoughts of the chick pulled this robot to this side that chick wanted its mother so bad that it drew the power of the thoughts of this chick Drew that robot to paint over here to Mark over here instead of go all randomly all over the place the power of its thoughts you know all these big b businessmen are into manifestation they call it manifestation that if you focus on your success if you focus so much and you imagine and visualize doing this I think Michael Jordan Larry Bird all them did this visualization kind of regreg did it visualization I'm G to do this I'm gonna do this I'm G do this I'm G do this and they went and did it and it happened exactly the way they thought they were tapping into something so if you a son and daughter of God would think about Jesus Christ so much and your thoughts would be continually about him and about his word and saying Lord God open this up to me give me Revelation on this give me your thoughts on this give me your advice on this Lord Jesus and you can he what you can literally pull him down from heaven you can walk what what did what did what did Enoch do he walked with God good good yes if a chicken do it to Something in adamant this didn't even have a heart in it this was not even alive what are they doing in the business they're they're they're pulling for money they're pulling for Prestige Wealth and fame which isn't even living how much more us a child and Son of God think on the Creator our heavenly father not only our father but our husband yes how much more will he draw Close to You Hallelujah yes sir yes sir if we just keep our minds on himall but look at this the chick loves I we've had a brw of chickens one time that they brooded and whatever that that them chicks love their mama so much they want to be under her wing all the time in fact so much the mother wanted to get out of that that little cage we had her in she like get trying to shoe them away they're too pesty right they're just we need you I don't have any milk eat eat scratch right but God's not like that he says pull from me pull from me that's right son daughter what do you need pull from me the man I was witnessing to this week he said Simon he goes I used to be an atheist but then I kind of I soften myself to God I go why were you Nath this he said he said I look around I see all these children dying of cancer he says and God wasn't healing him he said how could God do that how could God let them do that and I said sir I said you've got to understand the Bible I said you got to understand I started working what before Genesis 1:1 and how there was no God when he was just a self-existing one within him was all the attributes I say I said brother I said I call him brother because he was Lutheran I said brother the reason not the reason they're getting sick and dying is because they don't know how to pull from the one who has healing power and he's put like this I said if you don't seek God for what he can give you you'll never get it God will God is a gentleman he'll not force you he's not going to force his Blessing he's not going to force his healing his provision on you SS of God but you got to what pull from it amen yes praise the Lord like this brother's dealing with uh if you listen to the key to the door he's going through all these certain gifts great men like uh Edison uh you name it all these men had dreams and decisions in fact I saw a picture one day showed all these great men that had accomplished things after their 50s and 40s like uh Colonel Sanders was like in his 50s or 60s before then he just boom just and at the end of this or at the end of the story here he goes on to uh tell about that cartoonist Walt Disney right he was rejected rejected rejected he could draw he could write this but he was rejected rejected but he said something inside of him believed he could make it that he had the gift to make comics something inside him believed he said but he what was that belief he said he had a key see that's where we got to search ourselves do you have that key that knows you're going to make this Rapture do you have that faith and say well well brother I don't know ask God togive you what what did the disciples say he says increase our faith Hallelujah you're no different than disciples disciples were just like us there are some cardal half the time I'm sure Christ was going W father this is the one you chose absolutely all right let's continue back to business all right right James and John fighting over positions are like Jesus just going yet I love them and I prayed for Peter too yeah but inside them they had the key within them they believed and knew that Jesus was the son of God yes sir and that he was going this was for a purpose what is the purpose we're we're in 2024 almost ready to jump 202 what's the purpose SS of God your purpose is going to be made manifest SS of God when the sons of God and daughter has become manifested that is where we're going that is what brother J was saying back here about that lad rain when that lad rain hits it's going to produce Hallelujah it is going to produce things great things greater things amen W didn't get very far um I want I want to bring this in real quick now we've during services this is why people I think brother cam actually he taught this a while back and then when I was teach when I was thinking on these things these thoughts are coming back to me when you're in the midst of a service and you need something the will of the presence of God is here to to deliver those things to you but you have to act quickly okay look at this quote here listen so many people in that day missed their opportunity you know there's so many people today missing that opportunity when you come into His presence and then turn away oh what an opportunity for men and women boys and girls to come before Christ and pour out their soul but he had a mission that seem to be more important so in other words sints of God when you feel the presence of God draw close pull on him because if you fail to pull on him you'll miss the blessing it won't cost NE necessarily A lot of times it won't cost your salvation though it can if you're sinning or whatever and you need to repent and and the and the man of God says repent repent repent get right do things right make sure you're clean before God Amen and we failed to go on with that you could literally hear it for the last time in your life now look at this he says I'm so happy for you to hear these things you notice after I'm gone there will be a long a little long time here and you ministers in your churches you'll hear of people appearing and saying you know that's just left me there's some of them that I can't call I see it hanging over them in between them there's someone who stands here on the platform he says it's a dark place in between here and there and sometimes I see the move he's dealing with that light in the audience he's calling for prayer right he says and sometimes I see the move but I can't see the person see just right and especially when you're under the anointing you just can't see it and if you don't act quickly why it'll move somewhere else you see so as soon as you feel Faith for something you're praying for something you have a need for something and the preacher is preaching and you feel Faith rise up for just say just yell out SS of God say Lord I accept it yes or amen praise God amen the preacher might not even know what's going on it might not be a prayer line say God but if you feel a p something pulling in your heart and you say that's what I need Lord I need it and you feel the faith do something about it make a move amen he says here's a kidney trouble lady uh there's a kidney trouble lady right back there with the kidney condition you believe God makes you well lady if you do raise up your hand he just wanted him to her to make a motion he says accept it respond to God's call he says you missed it just like that missed it so when you feel the presence of God when you feel something rise up in you say say yes Lord I accept it because it can be missed now it didn't miss didn't miss your salvation now look what takes place after this it falls on he says you missed it or not he says you missed it I'll show you whether you missed it or not she I'll prove it he says you missed it but I'll prove it it falls on this lady setting right ear with a napkin over her mouth this lady sitting right there with a bad trouble too that's right lady didn't it yes yes sir you just come from an operation a cancer operation that's right your name is Virginia that's right you're healed Virginia in the name of Jesus Christ makes you well you missed it Mr Anderson because you didn't respond see see oh how can you unbeli you see the sovereignty of God do you see how deadly sincere this was back then they were dealing with what with the son of man Ministry the God himself the pillar of fire was right there and ready to make a move and a lot of times people did not catch it because why they were not in sync with hum that's why we have I wonder if that lady that missed it I wonder if they didn't come here and pray beforehand and get into the spirit of God because if they would have been in the spirit of God they would have caught their healing right there and they would have been Joy running and shouting and praising God they would have never been sick no more oh my yeah look he says what about you Reverend what do you think about about it do you think God can make them spiritual problems go away from you and make you a Believer make you to believe all right you can have then ask what you ask for God bless you what did he touch this lady sat right here right at the end of the road C lady sitting right there with cancer you think God can make you well lady do you have a prayer card you don't need one you're healed you ought to have answered right there lady you missed it she still said yes amen praise God a lot of times you hear the sermons and they start breaking crying they're crying oh that's right that's right that's right praise God she didn't make one she was not in tune with the move SS of God imagine this the Malachi 4 just preach a sermon and now he says and now he's not preaching he's let literally entering into what the second pole the discernment and thoughts and tense of the hearts he's entering into Visions he ENT entering into this and that the most anointed time where the pillar of fire comes down and people are were not even does it even does it show that they're even in the service were they even in the service do they even know what was going on could they discern the day could they understand that this was not just an average ministry here this was what a prophet of God with what the third pole power right there he said you missed it here there a heavy set lady sitting right there looking at me right down wearing glasses hair on back as a female trouble sitting right there I I pray you believe God will heal you later lady do you believe with all your heart you have your you got a prayer card he says well you won't have to use it he says your faith is made whole so here's someone that did catch it said your faith is made whole now look what he says here I'll turn my back they still weren't believing people were still missing their healing by discernment he says look I'll turn my back and he starts on Discerning you've heard it this side there's a lady sitting back there that's right with the heart trouble she's got arthritis right there Mrs Brady stand up I don't know the lady but they're missing it what's the matter with the unbelief here tonight shame on you not only did the prophet believe but God was in the midst how many times we come on Wednesday night service or a Sunday night and the pastor says you need prayer but we don't have enough Faith to come up for pray you missed it or if you have need for something and you come up and get prayed and you still don't have the faith you missed it don't let it get you down let us prepare for more let us learn these are learning things these are teaching things here sints of God Amen let's stand here by God's grace I've been long the power of your thoughts do you believe the word of God do you believe that all things are possible absolutely God is more than able I just heard a couple weeks ago brother Arley testimony powerful he believed and God Rose him up to full strength amen he went out by faith he didn't even have the full strength yet and he went out and worked with brother Levi and he said he didn't have it but s God honored his faith and God restored him fully back right brother amen let's bow our heads say a
