[15:53] so I will walk your spirit is a baby
[15:59] my big dream my victory your spirit is a
[16:04] baby so I think my victory
[16:15] [Music]
[16:36] it's gonna be now so lord praise God
[16:38] well that sounds really good
[16:40] thank the Lord I like that what I can
[16:43] hear it myself I'd like to read out of a
[16:48] couple portions description I only look
[16:49] at the same thought as this morning and
[16:53] I had these a few thoughts I never
[16:56] really thought about till this morning
[16:59] like I said around 8 o'clock cuz I was
[17:00] studying and just kind of seemed to
[17:03] start flowing so I guess we'll read I'm
[17:10] gonna read this thought Luke chapter 2 I
[17:11] want to go to Luke chapter 2 this may
[17:14] seem strange but I think you'll catch it
[17:18] once we get going and we look at
[17:23] battling to stay in the spirit we look
[17:27] at the life of the Lord Jesus for a
[17:29] moment or look at the life of daniel
[17:34] just to kind of give some direction you
[17:37] know for our lives and i think some
[17:39] encouragement so Luke chapter 2
[17:47] like to read at the end of the chapter
[17:54] why don't we read verse 48 down to 52
[18:01] hope I didn't confuse all the other
[18:03] Saints I told him I told her my text if
[18:06] we had a second service I know I sent
[18:07] the text out but I'll apologize to them
[18:10] maybe they don't think we're having
[18:11] service but maybe the text didn't go
[18:15] through maybe that's the problem but
[18:17] praise the Lord we're happy to be in the
[18:19] house of Lord today just trying to watch
[18:21] and see how everything would you know
[18:23] work out you know with different things
[18:24] I just want to see how well worked out
[18:26] so Luke chapter 248 and when they saw
[18:30] him they were amazed and his mother said
[18:32] in him son why hast thou thus dealt with
[18:36] us behold thy father and I have sought
[18:39] thee sorrowing and he sent them how is
[18:43] it that ye sought me which he not that I
[18:46] must be about my father's business
[18:47] almost sounds like a little rebuke to
[18:50] him doesn't it but then he turns around
[18:52] and rebukes them right and they
[18:56] understood not the saying which he spake
[18:58] unto them think about how hard it must
[19:01] have been for Jesus Church he would say
[19:03] these things his mom didn't understand
[19:05] him his dad didn't understand him and
[19:07] then we got older even the disciples
[19:08] didn't understand him think about how
[19:10] hard that would have been and he knew
[19:12] Judas wasn't gonna catch it the whole
[19:14] time but what'd he do he just stayed
[19:16] humble praise God he just stayed with
[19:19] the word and he was faithful now look at
[19:24] verse 51 and he went down with them and
[19:27] came to Nazareth and was subject unto
[19:30] them but his mother kept all these
[19:33] sayings in her heart and Jesus increased
[19:37] in wisdom and stature and in favor with
[19:41] God and man how old is Christ at this
[19:44] time well the next time we hear about
[19:49] Christ is 18 years later so there's this
[19:53] absence from 12:30 and the neck
[19:58] time we read about him is Luke chapter 3
[20:02] verse 21 now when all the people were
[20:05] baptized it came to pass that Jesus also
[20:08] being baptized I like this and praying
[20:12] we like to see he was trying to get in
[20:14] the spirit raised God we want to get the
[20:17] spirit we got to pray separate ourselves
[20:20] and what happened that heaven was open
[20:24] the Holy Ghost he sent it in a bodily
[20:27] shape like a dove upon him praise God
[20:32] and a voice came from heaven which said
[20:34] thou art my beloved son in thee I am
[20:37] well pleased
[20:39] let's just have one more word of Prayer
[20:40] if we can here just smoke yeah I mean on
[20:42] your heart just make it known unto the
[20:43] Lord here how many father we love you
[20:45] we're laying our lives before your Lord
[20:46] we're trying to submit ourselves to you
[20:48] Lord let your Holy Spirit help us now to
[20:50] grow in wisdom and stature and in favor
[20:52] with God and man as we're battling to
[20:55] stay in the spirit in Jesus Christ's
[20:57] name the church said Amen god bless you
[20:59] be in see the praise God so I got all
[21:04] these little thoughts I want to start
[21:05] with the thought I ended with who was
[21:10] with revival we'll look at those
[21:11] different quotes on revival and I just
[21:16] noticed it as we have different
[21:17] preachers and you know even with last
[21:18] weekend we hear the word a revival all
[21:20] the time and so I just want to go over
[21:22] this again just briefly again that there
[21:24] are so many different revivals that we
[21:27] need to recognize which one we need help
[21:29] with right which one we need to be in
[21:32] okay so I read this one here from 1959
[21:41] November 15th brother Branham says God
[21:46] so arranged it that his program cannot
[21:48] move without you and I how many want to
[21:52] see a move right here it can't move
[21:55] until everybody gets in one accord right
[21:58] and as long as we're not doing what God
[22:00] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[22:02] program so see that encourages me I've
[22:06] been preaching on finding your purpose
[22:08] right
[22:09] and once everybody gets in there purpose
[22:12] and serving their ministry right and and
[22:16] manifesting their gifts then God's
[22:18] program will be paralyzed right it'll
[22:20] keep moving on right in order the way it
[22:23] should move on he says but when the
[22:27] church moves by the anointing of the
[22:29] Holy Ghost then we're in God's will
[22:31] doing this program Oh as soon as I
[22:33] return from California the Lord willing
[22:34] what the Branham tabernacle needs is a
[22:36] revival amen
[22:38] they need a revival and the filling of
[22:40] the Holy Ghost that's the great need of
[22:41] the tabernacle some of the finest people
[22:44] in the world come here but what they
[22:45] need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:48] what a compliment I can say the same
[22:51] can't you the finest people we've ever
[22:53] met in this world are in message
[22:55] churches but what we need is every
[22:57] person in the church to get the Holy
[22:59] Ghost
[23:00] then they'll manifest their gifts then
[23:02] their manifest their purpose right so
[23:06] that's the local church revival okay
[23:10] next quote here's what I like because
[23:13] I'm a teacher but look what he says the
[23:14] night before God willing when I come
[23:16] back I'm going out to get a little rest
[23:18] now for a week or two so when I come
[23:20] back God willing I want to hold a
[23:22] revival here at the tabernacle of just a
[23:25] teaching revival how many people want
[23:31] that see most people they want shouting
[23:34] screaming healings which is that's
[23:36] wonderful but listen we won't ever see
[23:39] our lives really change until we can be
[23:41] taught the Word of God
[23:44] now how many quote time you how many
[23:46] times you ever heard that quote preached
[23:47] never everything's all we got a scream
[23:49] we got a shout when he did that raise
[23:51] which that's that's wonderful we need
[23:53] that but here he's has a teacher revival
[23:55] we're just gonna take somewhere in the
[23:57] Bible and just go clomp clomp through
[23:59] our text he says see just teach the Word
[24:02] of God so that we can be founded because
[24:04] teaching he says he said set your roots
[24:06] down he says it sets your foundation it
[24:08] makes you stabilized when you can be
[24:11] taught the Word of God
[24:12] so see what Simonton camera trying to
[24:13] they're trying to teach us to be in
[24:15] under the spirit they're teaching us how
[24:18] to bring a revival David almost had it
[24:19] all right but he just had to consult the
[24:22] word
[24:23] so what does the word say about revival
[24:25] the word says you got to separate
[24:27] yourself first and then pray until you
[24:30] get the revelation of the Spirit and
[24:32] then act on that and then do what it
[24:36] says and then you see the fruits of it
[24:38] later praise God
[24:41] so this is something we got to grow in
[24:42] to praise the Lord but Amanda said in
[24:44] 1959 I'm going in the wilderness I mean
[24:47] to stay there because way down in my
[24:49] soul I feel that I need a closed walk
[24:52] with God where do you feel it it's the
[24:55] hole then what I am I don't just want to
[25:01] walk I try to walk right before him but
[25:03] I want a closer walk with him while the
[25:10] Brandon tap Tabernacle is having a
[25:12] revival I want one myself I just don't
[25:16] want it to happen in the building I want
[25:18] it to happen in me look at that see do
[25:22] you realize that you everybody here
[25:25] could have revival and I could miss out
[25:26] on it or it can be the other way I can
[25:29] have revival and you all can miss out on
[25:31] it so the thing to do is recognize who's
[25:35] having a revival if it's me let me stay
[25:39] in revival if it's somebody else let me
[25:41] be like them praise God
[25:44] so see daily revival Church local
[25:49] revivals remember of that great quote I
[25:53] love it brother Branham says he said see
[25:54] brother BAM
[25:55] he said see brother Neville he said
[25:56] we're gonna stand there he said arms
[25:57] around each other and he's we're gonna
[25:59] stand before Jesus I better have said
[26:01] look he said brother never look we
[26:03] stayed together through the all the hot
[26:04] and cold and look there he is the son of
[26:08] God amen hallelujah see all the ups and
[26:12] all the downs all the hard times like
[26:14] amen and I were saying we've seen so
[26:15] many people come and go to our churches
[26:17] in the last few years that doesn't move
[26:20] me a bit in fact it makes me more sure
[26:22] that I believe the truth because the
[26:25] reasons people leave aren't many times
[26:27] are outside the Word of God like these
[26:30] last ones and it's not even it doesn't
[26:33] even move me at all cuz I know what the
[26:34] word says and I recognize what that
[26:36] spirit is
[26:37] doing behind it because it's an evil
[26:38] spirit trying to take you out of church
[26:40] taking your ties away I see what it is
[26:44] it's greed Amen it's it's it's the Bible
[26:47] said they separated themselves not
[26:50] having the Holy Spirit see yeah and I've
[26:53] told you before
[26:54] one of the first sins people do is miss
[26:56] church and when they start missing
[26:58] church I don't care how much you say you
[26:59] got the Holy Ghost if you're miss Church
[27:01] the Bible said they separate themselves
[27:03] sensual not having the spirit see
[27:08] because there's a spirit but if there's
[27:10] a spirit in you he said the Holy Spirit
[27:11] rying to drive you to church he said if
[27:13] there's a spirit keeping you out it's
[27:15] the wrong spirit because your soul can't
[27:18] feed on the Word of God
[27:19] I'm sorry anything except the Word of
[27:21] God oh I hope you're catching something
[27:25] here look around you
[27:27] I hope you're catching something praise
[27:29] God are you with me
[27:31] it will never point you away from the
[27:34] Word of God the Holy Spirit always
[27:36] points you to the Word of God see he
[27:44] wants a closer walk see we can see
[27:46] revival on other people but we want to
[27:48] see it in our lives I want more of the
[27:50] Holy Spirit in me to reflect Christ in
[27:52] me I want to be like him I want every
[27:54] every true Christian wants to be like
[27:57] him that's my heart's desire to be like
[27:58] Jesus
[27:59] he's the example of what I want to be
[28:03] here's that quote again I read an
[28:05] invisible union that he said but watch
[28:07] when that spiritual bride when she
[28:09] begins to have revival when she begins
[28:10] to come back and light herself up with
[28:12] the Word of God watch them again you see
[28:14] how the scriptures at that time there
[28:16] will be a message sweep out to catch
[28:17] that bride watch the woman the elect
[28:19] that's speaking of the latter rain
[28:22] because he's already he saw the latter
[28:31] rain because his teaching rain is
[28:32] flowing right there
[28:33] now here's what I didn't read this
[28:35] morning you this in 1984 the coming the
[28:38] great coming revival not pouring on the
[28:39] Holy Spirit but BAM said remember it was
[28:42] in the evening time when the bride was
[28:44] chosen see were part of another revival
[28:46] Rebecca was taken in the evening time it
[28:49] was the evening time that she met Isaac
[28:51] he was out in the field it's evening
[28:54] time our Gentile revival Gentile revival
[28:58] is ending pretty soon so brother Adam
[29:02] goes and takes it to another level we're
[29:04] under the Gentile revival event and he
[29:07] said the Jews are going to take the
[29:09] revival as soon as they can see the
[29:11] power of God manifesting and receive the
[29:13] Holy Ghost they'll take the gospel our
[29:15] Gentile days are ending get into the
[29:17] kingdom while you have a chance to get
[29:19] into the kingdom so you have a revival
[29:24] for your age and but then we also have
[29:26] the revival since God left the Jews and
[29:29] come to the Gentiles amen all right we
[29:32] just got revived all over the place
[29:34] where he's gone
[29:35] remember what does revive means to make
[29:37] alive again and the Bible said the
[29:40] Spirit of Christ has quickened us in
[29:43] fact the word revival will use twice the
[29:45] judgment so the word revived for us
[29:51] actual word damaged it was quick and
[29:53] that's the word the Bible said he were
[29:54] quickened together with him so that
[29:57] means the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:59] that's the revival the Bible speaking of
[30:01] but Paul said be renewed in the spirit
[30:03] of your mind that's the daily revival
[30:07] all right so there's another revival
[30:10] that's coming praise God or that we're
[30:12] I'm sorry we're already part of it's the
[30:13] Gentile revival amen now let me read
[30:18] this this is where Bubba have said in
[30:20] 1964 recognize you today and its message
[30:23] he said all the papers are saying fast
[30:25] pray fast pray the herald of is coming
[30:27] bass pray why do they do that why do
[30:30] they do that they want a Great Awakening
[30:31] they're crying believing that they were
[30:34] being awakening they're good people what
[30:36] is it what have they done they've not
[30:38] recognized the awakening of the bride so
[30:42] Branham says the 1964 the
[30:55] [Applause]
[30:58] they're away we know we heard the shot
[31:02] okay all right I'll use both again amen
[31:06] just let him hear it praise God amen
[31:08] however it happens that the people here
[31:10] praise the Lord see and then the one
[31:13] quote by Rev says they haven't had the
[31:15] revival yet of course that's speaking of
[31:17] the latter rain so see you gotta take
[31:19] all these quotes and kind of line it up
[31:20] with the word and see where it all mixed
[31:22] together praise God so see they've not
[31:25] recognized the awaken of the bride but
[31:27] by being a Christian they feel the pull
[31:30] of the hour but they haven't recognized
[31:32] what's been done that's what's making
[31:34] them feel that way they know something's
[31:36] supposed to happen but they're looking
[31:37] for way up in the future when it's
[31:39] already happened right by you he says
[31:42] Amen my brand new the bride had woken up
[31:45] she'd heard the shout so see all the
[31:48] other quotes we got to line up together
[31:49] with the word to make sure we're not
[31:51] confused about revival because listen I
[31:53] know I'm revived praise God you should
[31:55] know you're revived - you were dead in
[31:58] sins but now I'm revived Amen
[32:00] I'm living I'm alive I'm obeying the
[32:03] word I'm loving God yes so I fall short
[32:04] daily sure but I also revive daily amen
[32:07] I get back up again every day praise God
[32:11] because I'm a warrior I'm a soldier I'm
[32:14] a fighter I'm fighting the good fight of
[32:16] faith praise God
[32:17] I didn't give up on the faith I'm still
[32:19] fighting and many times I'm on the front
[32:21] grounds praise God or the the front of
[32:24] the battle praise God the frontlines
[32:25] that's the word I'm looking for
[32:27] that's right little man said see she's
[32:30] awakened she's had a revival now the one
[32:34] that that people stumble over is the
[32:38] third seal but we're brother Branham
[32:39] says the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[32:42] there's been no revival there no
[32:44] manifestation of God to serve the bride
[32:45] we're looking for it now it'll take
[32:47] those seven unknown thunders back there
[32:49] to wake her up again yeah he'll send it
[32:52] he promised it so see that's where I
[32:55] told you this morning I believe this
[32:56] quote is speaking of once the seven
[32:59] seals are finished the bride will
[33:01] receive that and be born again and have
[33:04] the revival and I believe that's
[33:05] happened so if you ask me I would say
[33:09] yes I know brother have said this but he
[33:11] also said a year later that she's
[33:13] awakened right here's he says in 63 says
[33:17] she hasn't had a revival yet it'll take
[33:19] the seven thunders but then BAM says in
[33:21] the church age book the thunders were
[33:23] the revelation of the seven seals well
[33:25] the seven seals are revealed and the
[33:26] Brides awaken so I believe the brides
[33:28] have a revival praise God hey man I
[33:31] believe that amen
[33:33] and if not Church then what what are you
[33:35] living off of I'm living on the Word of
[33:37] God I'm not dead to the word I'm living
[33:40] the word praise God every day I live the
[33:42] word what are you living on we're living
[33:44] on the Word of God the Word of God gives
[33:47] us life praise God amen it has to be
[33:50] break Scott one of the revivals are
[33:52] they're praised there's either a foolish
[33:54] version revival or a wise version I'm
[33:56] feeding on the Word of God I'm redeeming
[33:59] the time I'm believing the four Word of
[34:01] God
[34:01] I've got revival glory see he said the
[34:06] church age book he'll do two things so
[34:08] according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the
[34:09] hearts of the children of the fathers
[34:11] number two he'll reveal the mysteries of
[34:13] the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[34:15] which are the revelations contained the
[34:18] seven seals Amen it will be these
[34:21] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[34:23] literally turned the hearts of the
[34:25] children to the Pentecostal father's
[34:27] Amen what do we design why do we come
[34:30] here on a Sunday night
[34:31] so we because we're believing the book
[34:33] of Acts is going to repeat we see
[34:36] glimpses of it we see we see little
[34:38] glimpses of it we're thankful for that
[34:40] but we know it's going to come in the
[34:41] fullness of its power
[34:42] it's prophecy for thus saith the Lord
[34:45] the fullness of Pentecost will be in the
[34:46] bride I said last week to you and I know
[34:49] that so see now look there's many kinds
[34:52] of revivals can anybody see that there's
[34:54] your daily revival and just because you
[34:56] backslide daily doesn't mean you're not
[34:57] sealed let me read this quote if you
[35:00] never heard it I had a 65 or 70 year old
[35:03] woman come up weeping when I went to
[35:05] Albert sang brother Jesse I've been the
[35:07] message all my life and I still don't
[35:08] even know if I'm saved and if you had
[35:12] asked me I always said certainly save
[35:14] sealed fill with Holy Ghost
[35:15] look how faithful she is look at her
[35:17] beautiful family and children
[35:18] grandchildren you know what I had to do
[35:21] I had to tell her about this quote and
[35:22] she started crying every Jason
[35:24] and listen and listen this is what I
[35:27] found in my life
[35:28] listen buddy man I know you will I see
[35:32] my a lot of myself at a man that's why
[35:34] I'm saying that cuz he's got so much
[35:35] zeal you know the the longer I live the
[35:40] hot the the more I see my zeal kind of
[35:42] go down I'm talking about in my natural
[35:46] flesh brother William do you understand
[35:50] what I'm saying okay like I've told you
[35:54] this 10 years ago I woke up every
[35:56] morning I was just on fire burning for
[35:58] like I guess I had to screen sister
[36:00] Wendy
[36:00] I John got me two screens there 28 7
[36:03] inch screens and I studied all morning I
[36:05] was like this no I was on fire now
[36:09] nothing's changed with the last 10 years
[36:10] I still got the Holy Ghost having a name
[36:12] any evil sins but I just get more tired
[36:15] easily and nothing nothing about my life
[36:23] has changed in fact if you asked me I
[36:25] would feel like I obey God more but I'm
[36:27] just more tired and my zeal has just
[36:31] gotten lower but like when it comes down
[36:34] to it and I get up here and I get under
[36:36] the anointing yeah I feel returned but
[36:39] then in my my flesh sister Beatrice my
[36:42] flesh you don't have the zeal that's
[36:44] what I was saying this is your lesson
[36:46] because look what brother if anyone
[36:48] would have felt zeal for God it would
[36:49] have been brother Branham who saw angels
[36:52] he saw Jesus twice but look what he says
[36:54] in 1960 no 1957 this is why I shared
[36:58] with her sister from Albion I thought
[37:00] surely this woman's a saint
[37:02] she didn't even didn't even feel saved
[37:03] anymore he said listen brother you're
[37:06] never saved by any sign
[37:08] now you might need a sign to help you
[37:09] believe we know there's quotes on that
[37:12] tin right with the woman sister Bruce
[37:14] you're never saved by any sensation you
[37:16] are saved when you've met God's
[37:18] condition of his word and nothing else
[37:21] are you saved by in other words when you
[37:25] obeyed the word you were saved
[37:27] whether you felt it or not you obeyed
[37:30] the word so if you do your part God has
[37:32] to do his part
[37:35] you are saved he said that's right God's
[37:38] Word made away you're not saved because
[37:40] you feel like you're saved he said I'm
[37:43] not saying because I feel like I'm saved
[37:45] because a lot of times I don't feel that
[37:48] way a 50 year old man who's seen Jesus
[37:52] Christ twice and had the greatest
[37:54] revivals in his generation said
[37:56] sometimes I don't even feel saved a lot
[37:59] of the time see because what happens but
[38:02] imagine you got three lights when you're
[38:04] born he said when you reach a certain
[38:06] age when that lights turn off I think at
[38:10] twenty-five one turns off at fifty
[38:13] another turns off and you got one more
[38:17] sometime after 75 that light goes out
[38:20] are you with me Church in other words
[38:24] you're in other words like this your
[38:25] will to live your motivation to live
[38:28] right like did you see sister Tang
[38:31] passed away do you see that uh they just
[38:36] just want to go home to be with the Lord
[38:39] that's what I'm saying doctors say
[38:42] there's two doctors know this too the
[38:43] person will die when they want to die
[38:46] when they want to go home and be with
[38:48] the Lord right but they gotta want to do
[38:51] it because there's a will right there's
[38:54] Paul said I wanna there's I want to be
[38:56] abs if I'm absent from the body I'm
[38:57] present with the Lord he said but I want
[38:59] to die go be of Jesus he said but you
[39:01] need me right that's same for these
[39:05] chapter five I've got a desire to go be
[39:09] with them but you need me here a lot of
[39:14] times a prophet of God didn't even feel
[39:16] saved if anybody had the Holy Ghost he
[39:18] had the Holy Ghost but I'm saying
[39:22] because God gave the promise
[39:24] I met God's conditions and upon God's
[39:27] holy word I can defeat Satan seven days
[39:30] a week and as many nights because it's
[39:33] God's Word
[39:34] oh thank you Jesus amen glory you and I
[39:40] will lose our zeal and our flesh you
[39:43] know in our excitement about the word in
[39:44] our minds now right
[39:47] because everything gets old right even
[39:49] picking up a message but think about how
[39:51] man I was so excited the first time I
[39:53] read the church age book but now
[39:55] honestly just the flesh right it's kind
[39:58] of hard to crack it open it's easier
[40:00] just to click and listen to a sermon
[40:02] hello right judge right see what what is
[40:08] it is it because I said that you're not
[40:10] safe no you still honor the word it's
[40:14] just harder as you get older you lose
[40:15] your strength you lose your desire right
[40:19] you just the life's the exact kind of
[40:22] say like the life force almost like
[40:26] mother William I used to wake up and I
[40:28] just get a drink of water you know brush
[40:29] my teeth every I was right to the word
[40:31] well now I got to sit there and I got a
[40:32] sometimes I just got a look at my phone
[40:34] and sometimes I just got a I just
[40:37] something about me I'm just tired you
[40:39] know just can't do it like I used to and
[40:41] I think what's wrong with me and I hear
[40:43] this quote and I say thank you Jesus
[40:44] praise God yeah because we're not it's
[40:50] not based upon feeling and they got it's
[40:52] not amen cuz he said a lot of times I
[40:57] don't even feel safe praise God that's
[41:01] the prophet of God he was the star in
[41:03] the hand of Jesus Christ amen
[41:05] the burning to see what was burning not
[41:07] his flesh not his spirit all the time
[41:11] but his soul was on fire praise God but
[41:15] it just goes to show how deep we got to
[41:17] get he said to hear from the soul think
[41:20] about this church how still how still in
[41:23] quiet you have to be to get down to the
[41:25] very depths of your soul about any
[41:27] question in your life see well think
[41:30] about it all day you'll plant it out
[41:33] you'll plan out all day
[41:34] think think they think but really
[41:36] getting down to the soul you got to get
[41:38] quiet before the Lord
[41:39] you got to repent you got to humble
[41:41] yourself you got to go really deep right
[41:44] really deep in prayer and humility to
[41:47] really get down to the soul or else
[41:50] you'll just make a decision like a whim
[41:52] I can make it off a whim brother ma'am
[41:55] knew that he said I've got to go out to
[41:57] my cave so I can have a revival like
[42:01] churches heaven see he knew he couldn't
[42:04] have a revival in his own home isn't
[42:06] that something jerk
[42:08] that's something sometimes we got to
[42:11] leave our own homes to have revival I'm
[42:14] not saying every time but in that case
[42:16] he had to sew now let's read Romans 8
[42:21] that brother cam read last week's so
[42:24] beautiful it was such a beautiful man
[42:25] all those sermons were so beautiful amen
[42:27] and I were talk about Simon's messages
[42:29] so beautiful showing us the end time my
[42:31] we're right at the end because that the
[42:34] book is open right like Ezekiel chapter
[42:36] 9 or 1 the books open and we got to be
[42:39] sighing and crying for the abominations
[42:41] amen hallelujah alright verse 5 Romans
[42:47] 8:5 yeah
[42:50] now verse 4 is about walking after the
[42:52] spirit not the flesh verse 5 for they
[42:54] that are after the flesh do mind the
[42:56] things of the flesh but they that are
[42:57] after the spirit the things of the
[42:59] Spirit for to be carnally minded is
[43:01] death but to be spiritually minded is
[43:04] life and peace so see walking in the
[43:08] spirit is life and peace and yet brother
[43:10] Branham heart didn't feel saved a lot
[43:12] because the mind battles but the Bible
[43:17] said when you can praying at your mind
[43:18] what is it the Bible say it says it's
[43:20] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[43:25] God offers life and peace but they meant
[43:28] to all of us right I keep using you
[43:30] sorry I'll do you somebody else use
[43:33] myself God offers life and peace but
[43:36] it's got to be and transforming our
[43:40] minds to life in peace in other words we
[43:43] have to remember I'm supposed to be
[43:45] walking in life I'm supposed to be
[43:47] walking in peace and then we can repent
[43:49] of how we were thinking and get in we
[43:52] get the right thoughts because your soul
[43:55] the Bible said the soul doesn't even sin
[43:56] it doesn't even sin when you're born
[43:59] again so it's getting your mind in the
[44:02] right frame to have that life in peace
[44:06] because remember I remember the court I
[44:08] read you brother have said once you say
[44:10] you got the Holy Ghost all the guns are
[44:11] pointed on you and you better believe a
[44:13] battles coming
[44:15] I don't know about you but everyone I
[44:17] met that's never been in war never
[44:19] talked about how peaceful it is in war
[44:21] oh it's Birds it was so pleasant in
[44:24] Afghanistan not the ones I've talked to
[44:26] you they are constantly on their toes
[44:29] they could died any moment the land
[44:32] mimes and then the snipers and the
[44:35] children walking up with self exploding
[44:38] grenades on him friends that I'm friends
[44:41] have lost their legs because of those
[44:43] things grenades I used to go to church
[44:45] with a guy name's Jeremiah blew off his
[44:47] leg so he's he's like that now he's got
[44:49] like a little brace there in Afghanistan
[44:52] war is not a time of life and peace so
[44:57] our minds are constantly gonna feel like
[44:59] war but we've got to make an effort to
[45:01] renew them to feel like we have life and
[45:03] peace praise God in other words you got
[45:06] a battle to keep the right thoughts in
[45:08] your spirit so you can experience the
[45:10] life and peace that God offers us amen
[45:13] I've told you this before I've had some
[45:16] serious conversations recently with
[45:17] people that left the church you know I
[45:18] was something I was sharing about it
[45:19] recently and in years past and I've been
[45:21] so nervous before those phone calls but
[45:23] before I prayed God gave me life in
[45:27] peace so in other words in the midst of
[45:30] the storm I was able to pray and find
[45:32] life in peace okay I didn't feel like
[45:35] life and peace before that I was all
[45:38] nervous hard sleeping at night because
[45:39] of all they're gonna accuse me of this
[45:41] they're gonna accuse me that they don't
[45:42] believe this doctor what am i what do I
[45:43] know about that doctrine what scripture
[45:44] they have on that what quotes have on
[45:46] that it makes me nervous by the way but
[45:48] the prayer the Bible said when you cast
[45:50] your cares on the Lord the Bible said
[45:52] cast him on the Lord he cares for you
[45:55] amen draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to
[45:58] you that's how we battle we meditate on
[46:03] things that are holy things that are
[46:05] pure things that are right things that
[46:07] are lovely praise God we meditate on
[46:09] things that are true he's our Lord and
[46:11] when we do that it brings us life and
[46:13] peace in our minds in our minds now you
[46:22] remember this
[46:22] oh brother BAM says he said he's talking
[46:25] about a prayer line that he had in 1964
[46:28] he said I seen women and men holding
[46:31] babies and they were wet because they
[46:32] were standing outside in the rain but in
[46:34] 1964 you remember you passed your
[46:38] brothers weeks from now you will find
[46:40] out a great thing took place there they
[46:42] will recover I say that 90% of them will
[46:44] recover I've never felt such a form of
[46:47] faith it was really wonderful now just
[46:50] act now look we says he tells the people
[46:52] just act go on and act like it was all
[46:56] over no matter if you didn't feel it
[46:59] jesus never did say did you feel it he
[47:04] said do you believe it do you believe it
[47:09] and we believe it and he is here now and
[47:11] we give Him praise and glory for all
[47:13] that he's done I thought well it has to
[47:16] be in Scripture and that's right Jesus
[47:17] told Martha he said in whosoever
[47:20] believeth
[47:21] I'm sure liveth and believeth in me
[47:22] shall never die believe it's now this he
[47:26] didn't say do you feel this he said do
[47:30] you believe this hey man it didn't
[47:34] matter what they felt they already felt
[47:36] sad Lazarus had died but you didn't say
[47:38] look at your feelings he said do you
[47:40] believe it amen do you believe on the
[47:43] resurrection do you believe on the life
[47:45] do you believe you'll see your brother
[47:47] again
[47:47] do you believe it not do you feel it do
[47:49] you believe it praise God amen now by a
[47:54] man die were talking it's true sometimes
[47:56] you'll feel the anointing right
[47:58] I bet man talk about the super anointing
[48:01] he spoke six squirrels in existence
[48:03] right and then the seven time he spoke
[48:07] it so we'd find that that six one
[48:08] because the brother was given a hard
[48:10] time well lord help us to know brother
[48:12] Brown told the truth or not
[48:13] where's they still do it today but he
[48:18] say he said I felt that super anointing
[48:19] come on me and he said that's the same
[48:21] anointing when he spoke those squirrels
[48:22] that same super anointing came on him to
[48:24] tell had he right give her what she
[48:26] asked for
[48:27] so this is George there will be times we
[48:29] feel the super anointing but many times
[48:32] we won't like I read this morning the
[48:33] scripture that's a great revelation to
[48:35] me the Bible
[48:36] said if you don't walk if you walk in
[48:38] the flesh I'm sorry when you walk in the
[48:39] spirit
[48:40] you will not fulfill the desires of the
[48:42] flesh so anytime you turn down sin
[48:45] you're walking in the spirit whether you
[48:48] feel it or not you are going by the
[48:50] leadership of the Holy Spirit amen amen
[48:54] you see your souls already anointed but
[48:57] the reason you might not feel is because
[48:59] maybe your minds are struggling your
[49:01] mind battles maybe you're tired a long
[49:03] day at work and now the kids are doing
[49:05] this again and now I'm doing this again
[49:08] or my husband or my wife is doing this
[49:09] again we got a we got to calm ourselves
[49:12] renew our mind and remember what the
[49:15] Word of God says and it brings us life
[49:18] and peace when we live from the soul
[49:20] praise God hey Matt oh thank you Jesus
[49:25] yeah I haven't got nowhere to her I
[49:26] thought I'd be my thank the Lord okay
[49:36] the BAM says when you really get saved
[49:39] and filled the Holy Ghost something
[49:41] happens with the Word of God begins to
[49:43] manifest okay I think I skipped
[49:46] something here okay he's talking about
[49:51] yeah he says sometimes you will feel
[49:53] emotion I want to say a few more here
[49:55] here let me read another quote this is
[49:57] from the world is falling apart 1963 he
[50:00] said now you people standing here now
[50:02] look don't you rely upon some emotion
[50:04] although it has emotion in it don't you
[50:10] rely upon whether you're going to speak
[50:12] with tongues or not don't think nothing
[50:14] about it God will take care of that see
[50:16] you asked for Jesus Christ to come into
[50:18] your life and you live in and to live
[50:20] himself through you you don't want no
[50:23] more thoughts of your own you want his
[50:24] thoughts praise God
[50:27] see it encourages them if you want the
[50:29] Holy Ghost don't look for a motion but
[50:32] you know it's coming
[50:33] praise God he said now there is some
[50:40] people who just live upon emotion right
[50:42] we've all seen that if people don't feel
[50:45] it they don't believe it some people
[50:50] say well we got a lot of that in our
[50:51] Pentecostal movement and they will go in
[50:52] which is fine
[50:53] they'll Pat their hands and play the
[50:55] music and when it stops whoo a bucket of
[50:57] water went over everything we got in a
[51:00] habit of doing that it should become one
[51:01] of our customs look what he says here
[51:05] let me tell you something this is from
[51:07] thirst 1965 which I've been listening to
[51:09] let me tell you something when you're
[51:12] worshiping God in the spirit and truth
[51:13] when it becomes a custom for you to do
[51:16] it because you think you ought to do it
[51:18] because you think if you don't shout or
[51:20] jump or dance with the music your
[51:22] neighbors gonna think your back slid he
[51:24] said you're drinking from a stagnated
[51:26] stream amen see when you're worshiping
[51:30] and you just trying to get excited just
[51:32] make people think you're not back said
[51:34] he said you you are back slid see we've
[51:39] got to do it because we know it's right
[51:40] and like my bearson act act upon it act
[51:43] what you know the Word of God is and
[51:45] then pretty soon the emotion will come
[51:47] praise God but don't do it and don't act
[51:49] like it just because you want people not
[51:51] to think your back slid not somebody who
[51:56] lives on emotion well Ram said in the
[52:01] foresee us one of my favorite quotes
[52:03] about the Holy Ghost he said sometimes
[52:08] it brings joy beyond measure sometimes
[52:11] like he says sometimes we went through
[52:14] that it brings such a joy that you get
[52:16] over flooded he said I know there's a
[52:19] lot of fanaticism people carrying on I
[52:21] know sometimes they do it when the music
[52:23] is jumping up and down and everything I
[52:24] believe that too and I've seen people in
[52:29] the day as long as the music is play
[52:31] everybody was jumping and screaming but
[52:33] when the music stopped it stopped well
[52:37] that's all right as far as I'm concerned
[52:39] as long as the people lives right I've
[52:42] been to churches like that comprend ago
[52:44] so that as long as the music is on
[52:46] they're rejoicing but as soon as you
[52:48] start the music there's no more
[52:49] rejoicing and we got to be careful and
[52:52] don't happen to us if you're really
[52:54] rejoicing you don't matter if the music
[52:56] is on or off if the church is empty or
[52:59] full if it's revival or not you just
[53:01] want to give God praise
[53:04] now you start bringing the word that's
[53:07] the thing that actually brings life is
[53:09] the word that brings the joy of
[53:11] simulation of new wine and that's what
[53:14] it was on Pentecost when the word was
[53:16] vindicated so see what is that what
[53:20] actually brings life the word the word
[53:23] the word so see here's how it is when
[53:26] you breach the people receive the seed
[53:28] but then you got to water the seed
[53:30] praise God that's when you rejoice but
[53:33] the actual thing is getting the seed the
[53:36] word then you want it with your praises
[53:42] milligrams the 1964 voice to the side
[53:44] now notice when his presence is near it
[53:47] certainly it brings emotion as I spoke
[53:51] this morning anything without emotion is
[53:53] dead and any religion that hasn't got
[53:55] some emotion to it you better bury its
[53:56] dead it brings emotion he quickens us
[53:59] and when we're quick and let us remember
[54:01] what quickened us what did it it's the
[54:03] presence of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ
[54:07] in arm it's showing himself that he's
[54:09] alive not a corporal body
[54:11] he said when that time when the corporal
[54:13] body returns from heaven time shall be
[54:15] no more like the the person who just
[54:21] left our church was saying time was no
[54:22] more I sure I say I shared this quote
[54:25] and said no times no more when Jesus
[54:27] Christ comes back I said you
[54:29] misunderstood the scripture see they
[54:32] were separate they were trying to say
[54:33] time should be no more the rapture
[54:35] already happened and all these things
[54:36] like that come on this is the Millenium
[54:39] with all this death and killing nah see
[54:43] you got a real little more in the script
[54:44] yeah I read a little more quotes got to
[54:46] read more keep going so see it's a
[54:51] balance we're not supposed to look for
[54:53] emotion we're supposed to obey the word
[54:55] and believed the promise praise God and
[54:57] then sometime after that we will feel
[55:00] emotion but not necessarily right away
[55:04] and then brother man said a lot of times
[55:06] I don't even feel like I'm saved
[55:07] see cause he was getting older dying and
[55:11] your body has less strength right you
[55:13] need more naps
[55:15] see it didn't feel like it here's
[55:19] another one I love this one baptism Holy
[55:21] Ghost 1958 you know it don't take a lot
[55:24] of hollering but I like the holler
[55:26] brother man I do like the holler but it
[55:30] don't take a lot of hollering Church it
[55:33] don't take a lot of screaming
[55:36] that's alright nothing against it it's
[55:38] alright it don't take that here's what
[55:41] it takes
[55:41] oh my it takes a submitted heart setting
[55:48] in heavenly places feasting on the
[55:51] things of the Spirit and what does the
[55:54] spirit feast on emotion he said not all
[55:57] together so see I mean they're still
[56:01] apart when you're really enjoying the
[56:03] things of God you get emotional but it's
[56:06] not just emotion that the Holy Spirit
[56:08] feeds on he says it's the word it brings
[56:13] he said but it brings emotion this is
[56:22] honest this is the happiest place in the
[56:24] world I've ever been right here we start
[56:28] talking about to learn heaven and the
[56:30] promises of God I think about what Jesus
[56:32] Christ blood has done for me I just get
[56:34] so happy praise God I was watching the
[56:37] live stream between services and I'm
[56:38] like going like this and I'm like man I
[56:42] never thought I was so happy in my life
[56:43] there praise God and that's how it is
[56:45] every Sunday man hallelujah
[56:48] see because the Holy Ghost when you obey
[56:51] it it will bring a motion but that's not
[56:53] what we live on although it has part of
[56:56] it praise God we got to make sure the
[56:58] Holy Ghost can flow out of that flue we
[57:01] got to leave that channel open so we can
[57:03] get emotional for God right what people
[57:07] clog it up with sports people clogged up
[57:09] with bitterness and they can't get any
[57:11] emotion anymore they can't show their
[57:13] emotion for God and I remember praying
[57:14] for this years ago I prayed god help me
[57:17] to show more emotion and it wasn't long
[57:19] enough that brother William God dealt
[57:20] with some things in my life I had some
[57:22] complexes getting some preachers I was
[57:24] upset with my dad and God healed all
[57:26] those and now the emotions sometimes
[57:29] runs like a faucet praise God hey man I
[57:32] just asked him a simple request I want
[57:34] to see I knew something in me knew I
[57:37] need to be emotional for God and Jesus
[57:39] said ask and you shall receive
[57:44] alright okay now that I didn't know was
[57:48] gonna take that long that really wasn't
[57:49] the thought I was gonna go on but praise
[57:51] the Lord anyhow thank you Lord here
[57:56] thank the Lord now here's my two
[57:58] thoughts I kind of wind up I got some
[58:03] real now they might seem simple but
[58:06] they're real important things I want to
[58:07] say here no.1 obey the spirit like Jesus
[58:13] Christ his whole life he obeyed the Holy
[58:16] Spirit he never did a miracle till the
[58:21] marriage at the wedding at Cana they're
[58:23] right he was 30 years old so the first
[58:27] 30 years of his life he never did one
[58:29] miracle yet he walked in full obedience
[58:31] to the Holy Spirit praise God amen how
[58:38] does that apply to you well let's go
[58:40] back to Luke chapter 2 this is what our
[58:42] text was so I want to say all this
[58:44] battling to stay in the spirit to say
[58:49] this verse 51 look to 51 I just read a
[59:03] the book I've been reading about prayer
[59:05] and fasting it's a powerful I love it
[59:07] it's better I think man this guy must
[59:08] have new brother branham or something
[59:10] he's he's riding everything brother Ram
[59:12] said he's just not saying bail Rams name
[59:13] and he may have but he brought out this
[59:16] thought how we don't know anything about
[59:18] Jesus Christ life in his early manhood
[59:21] right from 12 years old
[59:24] to 30 we don't know one thing about him
[59:26] other than what the Bible says in Luke
[59:30] 251 the Holy Spirit chose one I'm sorry
[59:37] two scriptures to describe 18 years of
[59:40] his life hallelujah
[59:44] verse 51 and he went down with them and
[59:47] came to Nazareth and was rebellious unto
[59:52] them did I read that right can we just
[59:58] peek can we just dramatize for a moment
[1:00:00] Jesus Christ twelve year old went down
[1:00:02] he's in his mother's and father's house
[1:00:05] that's just that's just kind of peek in
[1:00:08] the window can we he's 12 years old
[1:00:10] that's just kind of peeking I wonder how
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ is living his life let's
[1:00:15] watch him Mary says Jesus can you clear
[1:00:19] off the table we'd like to get ready for
[1:00:20] supper mom come on I want to study the
[1:00:23] scripture what do you mean we don't see
[1:00:27] that happening Jesus how can you go

[1:00:52] a new Ark maybe yeah mom I'll drop that
[1:00:58] I'd like to set the table for you that's

[1:01:33] nursing the baby can you go clean it up
[1:01:35] sure mom I'll be happy to clean up the
[1:01:37] throw-up thank goodness praise God Jesus
[1:01:44] you're 15 all the friends AG's going to
[1:01:48] go out on the town for a few drinks
[1:01:50] tonight
[1:01:50] oh no to my
[1:01:53] the Sabbath I want to study a little bit
[1:01:54] on the Scriptures real quick I don't
[1:01:58] feel led to do that ah ha ha what did he
[1:02:02] do he became subject to mom and dad
[1:02:07] Jesus can we go out and you'll get on
[1:02:10] our hot rods no my dad asked me not to
[1:02:13] do that
[1:02:14] and the scripture says on your father
[1:02:16] and mother
[1:02:18] praise God and you'll have a long life
[1:02:22] on the earth but he only lived 33 years
[1:02:24] my so birth amen
[1:02:28] the only Scriptures we have about the
[1:02:30] life of Jesus Christ from 12 to 30 are
[1:02:33] he went to his house and he obeyed
[1:02:36] everything his parents said and he was a
[1:02:41] man that obeyed every word of the Holy
[1:02:45] Spirit and if anybody walked in the
[1:02:48] Spirit even before his born-again it was
[1:02:51] Jesus Christ he walked through
[1:02:54] justification must walk through
[1:02:55] sanctification so all that time he was
[1:02:58] walking through sanctification
[1:03:00] completely obedient to the Holy Spirit
[1:03:04] and let me just say like this the word
[1:03:07] came to my mind the silent years this is
[1:03:12] these are all the silent years we never
[1:03:14] hear about between all the miracles and
[1:03:17] the revival a church we've had some
[1:03:19] silent years around the message write
[1:03:21] programs not here anymore the prophets
[1:03:24] not here anymore but what did he do he
[1:03:26] increased in what wisdom wisdom redeems
[1:03:31] the time Jesus didn't give his 20s to
[1:03:35] the lusts of the the world in the cares
[1:03:38] of life he devoted his teens and his 20s
[1:03:41] to learning more about his father's
[1:03:43] business was that a waste absolutely not
[1:03:49] in fact it was the greatest investment
[1:03:51] the world's ever known amen
[1:03:54] because it produce a perfect spotless
[1:03:58] lamb that God could offer for the sins
[1:04:01] of all of us amen were those valuable
[1:04:06] years yes
[1:04:07] and what was he learning so valuable in
[1:04:10] those years just to submit to the Word
[1:04:13] of God and as he did that he gained more
[1:04:19] wisdom and then he gained more favor
[1:04:22] with God and with man let me say like
[1:04:29] this in Jesus battled to stay in the
[1:04:32] spirit his battle was focusing on living
[1:04:35] a godly life in his home and submitting
[1:04:38] to the leaders in his life
[1:04:40] that was his battle to stay in the Holy
[1:04:44] Spirit so he could get borned again so
[1:04:48] let's bring it to our church many times
[1:04:52] we'll have silent years or there's seven
[1:04:55] months where we don't see much going on
[1:04:56] but church is something going on
[1:04:58] absolutely people are either growing in
[1:05:03] submission to the Holy Spirit or they're
[1:05:06] falling away and rebelling against the
[1:05:09] Holy Spirit are you with me such a
[1:05:17] beautiful thought the quiet ears of
[1:05:22] Jesus Christ's life my goodness gracious
[1:05:26] it's nice to kind of peek into his home
[1:05:28] life isn't it Jesus will you take off
[1:05:31] the trash no I just woke up I want to
[1:05:35] play my game I want to read my oh sure
[1:05:37] mom I'll take out the trash I'd be happy
[1:05:40] to do that and this is why Church it's
[1:05:46] so important to be disciplined to our
[1:05:49] prayer life to our Bible reading and
[1:05:52] just submitting to those in authority
[1:05:54] over us like every day in other words
[1:05:59] every day's a chance to grow in the
[1:06:02] spirit's anointing right
[1:06:05] if not then Jesus was net and he wasn't
[1:06:09] growing but the Bible said he did they
[1:06:11] meant he increased in wisdom and favor
[1:06:14] with God and with man
[1:06:19] by doing what just giving God first
[1:06:21] place in his life
[1:06:23] week after week brother amen
[1:06:25] year after year decade after decade by
[1:06:30] almost two decades so the simple of the
[1:06:36] things we think all not so important
[1:06:37] just being a church early praying before
[1:06:39] church reading my Bible obeying my mom
[1:06:42] and dad submitting to the pastor right
[1:06:44] submitting to the preaching these things
[1:06:46] we think are so little but yet they're
[1:06:48] so magnified in the life of Christ he
[1:06:52] was so faithful church when he became
[1:06:53] thirty they let him read the scroll in
[1:06:56] the temple you had to earn that they
[1:06:58] didn't let any sinner come in there to a
[1:07:00] holy temple in a synagogue no you had to
[1:07:03] live the right life and he done it
[1:07:05] before but the time that he read it the
[1:07:08] anointing was even greater on him amen
[1:07:10] he said this day this scripture he never
[1:07:13] done that before he's God Amen but he
[1:07:16] lived such a life and he got so anointed
[1:07:19] that he uttered something he never
[1:07:21] uttered before he said this day this
[1:07:24] scripture is fulfilled
[1:07:28] that's what we need to do we need to be
[1:07:30] so faithful and be so disciplined and be
[1:07:33] so obedient and be so obedient to the
[1:07:36] Word of God that God can use us like
[1:07:39] that the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[1:07:42] spirit of prophecy
[1:07:47] eighteen years of silence but oh it was
[1:07:49] speaking loudly can I say like this
[1:07:51] it was thundering out it was a live life
[1:07:55] it was thundering out the Word of God Oh
[1:07:59] church do you see how important it is to
[1:08:01] seek ye first the kingdom of God if so
[1:08:05] many people are on the message that are
[1:08:06] really not seeking the kingdom of God
[1:08:08] first they're seeking Paychex first
[1:08:11] they're really not putting God first
[1:08:14] reading your Bible praying walk in the
[1:08:17] spirit
[1:08:18] obedience coming to church they're
[1:08:19] really not even doing some of those
[1:08:21] things but jesus said if you seek first
[1:08:25] if you put them the most emphasis on the
[1:08:28] kingdom of God and seek it first and in
[1:08:31] the righteousness of Christ let me
[1:08:32] see you ever see that that's me taking
[1:08:35] on his righteousness that's me living a
[1:08:38] more righteous life we have to seek a
[1:08:40] more righteous life amen
[1:08:43] seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
[1:08:46] righteousness in other words so I'll
[1:08:48] live the right way and if you do that
[1:08:51] one a little more righteously seek him
[1:08:53] first everything else will be added unto
[1:08:55] you like Tim Pruett I don't know if you
[1:09:00] heard that testimony they built their
[1:09:02] church and it was already paid off by
[1:09:03] the time they built it he said because
[1:09:05] God told him to build that church that
[1:09:08] had been like I'm just estimating at
[1:09:09] least two to three million dollars God
[1:09:12] told him build a church and he was
[1:09:14] seeking first the kingdom of God he
[1:09:17] didn't want to build a church but the
[1:09:18] Holy Spirit told to build the church and
[1:09:20] he said every time there came a need
[1:09:21] like electrician some electrician coming
[1:09:23] and said we'll do it for free she
[1:09:26] there's nothing wrong with building a
[1:09:28] church as long as you're led by the Holy
[1:09:30] Spirit as long as you're seeking first
[1:09:33] the kingdom of God everything else you
[1:09:35] need will be added unto you
[1:09:36] and they've had numerous people healed
[1:09:38] from cancer and different things inside
[1:09:39] that new sanctuary because it was
[1:09:42] prophetic because they're seeking God
[1:09:45] first that's what we got to do seek God
[1:09:49] first and everything else will be added
[1:09:51] unto us but who wants to seek God and
[1:09:54] like on this level and just be just obey
[1:09:57] every word I just want to pay my tithes
[1:09:59] every time I just want to pray I just
[1:10:00] want to get in the spirit before every
[1:10:02] service I just want to love God I just
[1:10:03] want to pull on the word of God every
[1:10:05] time I just want to be faithful how many
[1:10:07] people want to do that oh my so few so
[1:10:10] few but that's what Jesus Christ modeled
[1:10:14] for those 18 years just submission the
[1:10:18] man said the pastor asked you to do
[1:10:20] something he said you should do it
[1:10:22] praise God right so the last picture we
[1:10:30] get or the first picture we get is he's
[1:10:31] correcting his mom and dad in the temple
[1:10:35] 18 years later he submits increases next
[1:10:38] picture we get he's submitting to
[1:10:39] baptism although he didn't need to be
[1:10:41] himself but for sin he needed to be for
[1:10:44] the type of the Lamb
[1:10:45] or the sacrifice being washed so again
[1:10:49] where do we always find Christ
[1:10:50] submitting to the things of God he said
[1:10:53] I do nothing except the father shows me
[1:10:56] by vision he obeyed he submitted to
[1:10:58] every vision and it shook him to the
[1:11:01] core in the garden Gethsemane that last
[1:11:04] vision
[1:11:05] I've got he saw the cross he saw it and
[1:11:07] it shook him to his core till he bled
[1:11:09] from his forehead trying to get the to
[1:11:12] bring his body into subjection but look
[1:11:14] this is here it is
[1:11:15] if you obeying all the other things you
[1:11:17] obeying the last thing amen if you can
[1:11:20] submit to daily serve him all through
[1:11:22] the quiet years then when the major
[1:11:23] decision of your life comes you'll
[1:11:25] submit to that hey man did you know
[1:11:36] there's a lot of quiet years in Daniels
[1:11:37] life let's close with this I'll close to
[1:11:39] this I hope you can see that by God's
[1:11:45] grace every silent year was valuable
[1:11:48] because it's again learning to submit
[1:11:49] learning to humble myself learning not
[1:11:52] to rebel but learning to obey how many
[1:11:59] people like getting on streaks like you
[1:12:00] get on a roll how many like getting on
[1:12:01] streaks I've done that I can show you
[1:12:04] I've been on the I bet on this app I've
[1:12:05] done this app 700 some days in a row I
[1:12:07] just take little quizzes to help me like
[1:12:09] math quizzes to keep me sharp
[1:12:11] I love getting on streaks but you know
[1:12:14] what streak I want to get on longer
[1:12:16] it's praying in my closet reading my
[1:12:19] Bible every day I'm pretty proud of
[1:12:24] myself you know when I'm sick I can get
[1:12:25] on there and do my math problems and
[1:12:26] stay sharp
[1:12:27] maybe you call me sharp I don't know if
[1:12:30] I'd be called sharp or not but see
[1:12:33] everyday Jesus without fail submitted to
[1:12:37] the Word of God all those years and
[1:12:40] would it increase greater obedience
[1:12:42] greater wisdom greater strength praise
[1:12:47] God
[1:12:49] it's the compound power of obedience and
[1:12:52] submission to God's will for your life
[1:12:54] praise God
[1:12:58] Daniel no you have to turn there but
[1:12:59] Daniel I'll close with this Daniel had
[1:13:03] many silent years we don't hear much
[1:13:06] about him I'm taking you sure's dates
[1:13:12] here
[1:13:14] Daniel was thrown in the lion's den in
[1:13:18] BC 537 and God delivered him in 537 it
[1:13:26] wasn't until 5 55 BC hopes this jumps
[1:13:33] around here sorry this jumps around here
[1:13:39] ok wait by 30 ok ok ok I'm Adi got my
[1:13:46] numbers mixed up but looks like it was
[1:13:48] 555 BC he was in the lion's den oh yeah
[1:13:54] these numbers okay so maybe Daniels not
[1:13:56] in chronological order I was a little
[1:13:57] mistaken on that but the point I'm
[1:13:59] trying to make sorry the point I'm
[1:14:02] trying to make is at the end of Daniel
[1:14:03] the last words he writes are an ad
[1:14:06] I'm sorry BC 534 so 21 years later the
[1:14:13] Bible doesn't record all of his life
[1:14:15] but you know what he was doing all those
[1:14:16] years he was praying 3 times a day
[1:14:19] God delivered him from the lines and he
[1:14:22] didn't say ok I've arrived I don't have
[1:14:23] to pray anymore
[1:14:24] no he kept praying and the Bible picks
[1:14:27] it up in Daniel chapter 10 for the amen
[1:14:30] he's fastened for three weeks he's
[1:14:31] saying God show me what's gonna happen
[1:14:34] to my people do you see this even though
[1:14:36] he had victory over lions it didn't give
[1:14:39] him any self sufficiency in fact his
[1:14:42] miracle made him more hungry to see
[1:14:44] miracle in the lives of other Jews amen
[1:14:46] glory the more God did for him the more
[1:14:51] he wanted to see God moving his people
[1:14:54] praise God and that's how it'll be for
[1:14:56] you the more you see God move in your
[1:14:58] life
[1:14:58] the more you want to see God move in
[1:15:00] everyone else's life so we get silence
[1:15:04] for 21 years where's Daniel where what's
[1:15:06] it all about and we pick him up
[1:15:09] glory the Bible says in the first year
[1:15:16] of Darius he said even I stood to
[1:15:19] confirm and strengthen him and then he
[1:15:24] gets these visions Church he gets
[1:15:26] visions of the Antichrist a little horn
[1:15:28] he gets the visions - is so beautiful he
[1:15:31] gets the visions of the leopard and the
[1:15:33] bear because he's so hungry God what's
[1:15:38] gonna happen to my people why are we in
[1:15:40] Babylon
[1:15:40] he's so faithfully pranks he was
[1:15:43] building praise God
[1:15:44] he's as more as he was he was faithful
[1:15:47] every day it kept building he got
[1:15:49] growing wisdom and by the end of his
[1:15:51] life with amen he was praying
[1:15:52] interceding for others eternal life had
[1:15:55] taken over eternal life he was living
[1:15:58] for the Jews so he sacrificed three
[1:16:01] weeks of eating fancy foods saying God
[1:16:04] what's gonna happen your people and God
[1:16:06] sent the angel down to show him and then
[1:16:09] he saw Daniel seventy weeks he in Daniel
[1:16:11] 7 he saw mercy he saw the white throne
[1:16:14] judgment hey man how do ya God showed
[1:16:17] him things to come because he faithfully
[1:16:19] submitted to the Holy Spirit every day
[1:16:21] I'll pray three times a day I will obey
[1:16:22] the word I won't eat the Kings meat
[1:16:24] because he was faithful all that time
[1:16:26] and in subjection God showed him great
[1:16:28] things that I'll encourage us to be
[1:16:33] faithful unto God and if we're faithful
[1:16:36] unto God God's gonna show us great
[1:16:38] things do there's a lot of quiet years
[1:16:46] in his life but they weren't quiet he
[1:16:47] was busy contact in heaven so much that
[1:16:50] the angel come down and said Daniel
[1:16:51] you're greatly beloved in heaven heaven
[1:16:56] knew him all those years because he'd
[1:16:58] offer all the faithful prayers of the
[1:17:00] Saints uh-huh he was so burned first
[1:17:05] people at the end of his life see what
[1:17:07] he was doing church he was inquiring of
[1:17:09] the Lord what did David what he wanted
[1:17:14] the ark so he could inquire of the Lord
[1:17:17] and God answered the more you submit to
[1:17:23] the Holy Spirit the more questions
[1:17:25] you're gonna have about where you are in
[1:17:26] God's timeline and you're gonna have
[1:17:29] more of a burden to know where God's
[1:17:31] people are so as time goes on brother
[1:17:34] and sister we should be more concerned

[1:17:38] rapture let's get all the people in for
[1:17:40] the Holy Ghost let's get everybody in

[1:17:48] beginning right if God showed in the
[1:17:51] beginning what about the end hahahaha
