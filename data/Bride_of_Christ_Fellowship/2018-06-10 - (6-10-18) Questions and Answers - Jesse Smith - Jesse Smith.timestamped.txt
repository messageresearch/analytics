[41:51] let's take our Bible says we're standing
[41:54] here let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 34
[41:56] like to do a questions and answers
[41:58] service by the grace of the Lord had
[42:00] about 4 questions so I think it filled
[42:02] up a service and I'll try to set my
[42:04] timer so I don't go too long by the
[42:06] grace of the Lord and just one service
[42:09] today I did email everybody about that
[42:10] just one service today what kind of a
[42:13] little bit more rest at home and then
[42:15] we'll be back to to here once we're all
[42:17] rested up by God's grace
[42:23] Deuteronomy 34 verse 5 well kind of I'll
[42:27] start with the text of the first
[42:28] question the first questions about the
[42:30] body of Moses so we'll just start there
[42:36] Deuteronomy 34 verse 5 if you're there
[42:39] say Amen
[42:41] let's read 34 so let's read 5 and 6
[42:45] together that's a lot of reading but
[42:47] let's try it this morning by God's grace
[42:48] on three ready one two three
[42:50] so Moses the servant of the Lord died
[42:54] there in the land of Moab according to
[42:57] the word of the Lord and he buried him

[44:45] we're we're just so grateful for Tammy
[44:49] all that she does and and we couldn't
[44:51] have not done our construction at home
[44:53] without Tammy you know she's really
[44:54] helped us out in so many ways and I feel
[44:57] like we got a new house you know at
[44:59] least half a new house and but we're
[45:00] grateful you know cuz you know like that
[45:03] song said we're just borrowing that
[45:04] house for a little while
[45:05] you know that when the Lord comes and
[45:07] you know God's gonna burn the whole
[45:08] earth again before he comes back and to
[45:10] start all over but during these few
[45:12] years it's nice to have a fresh start
[45:14] you know and to give the place of
[45:16] children like to be at you know a place
[45:18] to be honest I like to be at - our house
[45:21] was you know from the 60s and rather old
[45:23] you know so it's nice to have some
[45:25] renovations and so forth like that and
[45:27] we'll be paying for for a few years but
[45:29] we're grateful anything worth having is
[45:31] worth paying for so we're grateful God
[45:35] is so good to us Church and we're just
[45:36] you know God has provided every need you
[45:40] know as the families increased you know
[45:42] God's provided every need and I thought
[45:44] you know I can grow a beard now that I
[45:45] got seven kids you know I thought well
[45:47] I'll just try to grow beard but I can't
[45:50] really grow beard as you can see you
[45:52] know so it's like aren't you going to
[45:54] shave before you
[45:55] I think I have seven kids now you know I
[45:57] think I can hold a beard now for a while
[46:00] you know I don't know too many people
[46:01] that have seven kids you know I'll just
[46:05] joke about yeah I really haven't had
[46:06] time to shave you know I look awful
[46:10] anyway but that's okay so you can switch
[46:12] over maokai had this but we're grateful
[46:14] you know we were so delighted and I've
[46:16] seen all seven babies born it's a
[46:18] miracle every time and you know the
[46:20] midwives were just complimenting my wife
[46:22] on her birth and how she takes care of
[46:24] herself and and we're thankful so
[46:26] thankful for Chris and all that she does
[46:28] at the home you know and our family
[46:30] wouldn't be what it is without Kristin
[46:31] you know she's the backbone of the
[46:33] family and we're just so grateful for
[46:35] all that she does and may God give a
[46:37] rest today she's at home resting live
[46:38] streaming so honey if I say anything
[46:40] wrong I'm sure we'll talk about it when
[46:42] we get home by God's grace
[46:44] hopefully I didn't say anything wrong so
[46:46] far sometimes I thought little secrets I
[46:48] shouldn't you know people tell me not to
[46:49] tell I just forget you know and and then
[46:52] sometimes I mention the wrong scripture
[46:53] a wife will help me correct me at home
[46:55] so I should appreciate a godly wife like
[46:57] that by God's grace so like I said I
[47:01] have four questions and I think we'll
[47:03] get to all of them by the grace of the
[47:04] Lord here the first one was great a
[47:07] great question there was more of an
[47:09] explained eye and I kind of paraphrase
[47:11] that if that's okay I kind of paraphrase
[47:12] the questions they could fit on the
[47:13] slides but the basically said explained
[47:16] Jude 1 verse 9 when Michael was arguing
[47:20] about the devil I'm sorry with the devil
[47:22] about Moses's body can you please
[47:25] explain more on the might on Michael the
[47:27] Archangel so let's go to Jude chapter 1
[47:30] verse 9 there's only one chapter of
[47:32] course Jude 1:9 as these are great
[47:35] questions by the way I'm so thankful
[47:37] brother branham said it too he loves to
[47:39] get questions from the people I love the
[47:40] questions because it lets me know what's
[47:42] on your heart it lets me know if there's
[47:44] anything I need to preach on to help
[47:46] give understanding I've got a lot of
[47:48] questions you know there's things I'm
[47:49] going to be studying and answering
[47:51] questions myself especially with the
[47:53] trumpets you know the Feast of Trumpets
[47:54] that whole sermon is always been a
[47:55] puzzle to me so Lord willing this summer
[47:58] I want to really go slowly through that
[48:00] message but Jude 1 verse 9
[48:06] says yet Michael the Archangel now to
[48:10] get the context and verse eight
[48:12] Jude is kind of rebuking false preachers
[48:16] that speak evil things against the true
[48:19] preachers so in verse 80 saying likewise
[48:21] also these filthy dreamers defile the
[48:24] flesh despise Dominion and speak evil of
[48:27] dignities so the context is false
[48:29] preachers will always speak evil against
[48:31] you know people in high authority or
[48:34] high honor in verse nine yet Michael the
[48:38] Archangel when contending with the devil
[48:41] he disputed about the body of Moses
[48:44] Durst not bring against him a railing
[48:46] accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee
[48:49] so in context this scripture is showing
[48:52] how even an angel and Archangel Michael
[48:54] will not even bring a railing accusation
[48:57] against Satan himself and so that's why
[48:59] these preachers who speak evil of
[49:02] dignitaries and do evil things like that
[49:04] that's why they'll be condemned is
[49:05] because they're not afraid to speak evil
[49:08] railing accusation against other men of
[49:09] God or other Christians and yet even
[49:12] angels won't even say evil things like
[49:14] that - Satan himself so that's really
[49:16] humbling for all of us right and we all
[49:18] need to be careful what we say about
[49:19] dignities can you say amen to that
[49:22] we must be very careful if angels won't
[49:25] even say evil things to Satan we better
[49:27] be careful what we say about other
[49:29] people now in the context so in the
[49:34] context we'll get to the context in just
[49:35] a moment but let me give the quick
[49:36] answer the the longer question was
[49:40] wondering did Moses die or not and so so
[49:42] yes first Moses did die but Elijah did
[49:46] not okay so we read that for our text
[49:49] both men or their anointings it could be
[49:53] their anointings - but I personally
[49:54] leave it'll be the literal men because
[49:56] Jesus brought back Moses and Elijah on
[49:58] Mount Transfiguration and Peter James
[50:01] and John saw both of their theophanies
[50:04] right and so I believe those very same
[50:06] men will preach to Israel soon whether
[50:09] it's in the next year five years ten
[50:10] years hundred years we don't know but
[50:13] God so honored those two prophets that
[50:16] he brought them back down from heaven
[50:19] in Jesus's day and he's going to use
[50:21] them in Israel when Israel it has the
[50:24] blinders taken off and now they can
[50:26] finally see Jesus was our Messiah Jesus
[50:28] was Isaiah 53 so I believe the men or
[50:32] their anointings will come back to
[50:35] minister the 144,000 now here's the
[50:38] scripture God told Joshua he said Moses
[50:41] my servant is dead
[50:42] so clearly Moses died and the scripture
[50:47] this was our text if you read the whole
[50:50] context it's verses 1 to 8 Moses died in
[50:54] Moab probably on top of a mountain the
[50:56] last thing we hear about him is that he
[50:58] died in mountain on a mountain the last
[51:00] thing we heard about him was he was on a
[51:01] mountain and then the Bible said he died
[51:04] and then they buried him in a valley in
[51:07] the land of Moab saw some valley now
[51:12] here's a more on the answer Moses his
[51:15] death represent his and his eventual
[51:20] resurrection because that's what we know
[51:21] what happened we get to that a moment
[51:22] Moses death represents the dead in
[51:25] Christ so Moses died but then Jesus or
[51:29] God resurrected him shortly after his
[51:31] death we don't know when but at some
[51:34] point after Moses died God resurrected
[51:36] him because in Jude 1 the devil's
[51:38] arguing he's like where is the body of
[51:40] Moses where is it at
[51:42] because remember Satan had dominion over
[51:45] all the people that died because when
[51:47] Adam because Adam forfeited all the
[51:50] rights in the Garden of Eden and the
[51:52] Bible said whoever you're overcome by
[51:54] you become enslaved to so because Adam
[51:57] has a son of God fell and chose to fall
[51:59] on purpose to Satan now Satan has that
[52:02] dominion over all dead people
[52:05] so Satan you know Moses died and Satan's
[52:09] waiting down for the body he's waiting
[52:10] for the bow you know he's waiting for
[52:12] Moses to come down well at some point I
[52:14] don't know how long if he did go down or
[52:15] not to to paradise or not but at some
[52:18] point he doesn't see the body of Moses
[52:20] where's the body of Moses I'm supposed
[52:22] to have the body of Moses and all
[52:24] Michael says is the Lord rebuke you God
[52:28] rebukes you Satan then that's because
[52:31] God resurrected
[52:32] Moses's body and took it up to heaven so
[52:36] Moses was a perfect type of Christ so
[52:39] and everything everything about Moses
[52:40] his life resembled Jesus Christ
[52:43] now Elijah he never died at all so
[52:47] Elijah represents we which are alive and
[52:49] remain and brother Branham said mount
[52:52] Transfiguration was a preview of the
[52:54] second coming of Jesus Christ and it is
[52:56] we can see that plainly here's the
[52:58] quotes the Prophet said there we see him
[53:02] representing those who died Moses to
[53:04] represent the dead Saints Elijah with
[53:08] his group at the last day with his
[53:11] raptured group standing there so when
[53:14] Jesus comes back to the rapture the
[53:16] Bible says in first Thessalonians 4 he's
[53:18] gonna stop in the air the dead in Christ
[53:20] will rise first well that's those who
[53:22] have died I'd like Paul Martin Luther
[53:25] John Wesley we believe brother Branham
[53:26] Billy Graham all these men any man who
[53:29] was filled with the Holy Ghost will be
[53:31] raised up and will will see them first
[53:34] will see the dead in Christ because
[53:35] that's what happened when Jesus
[53:36] resurrected the dead the dead raised
[53:38] first and they saw them and then they
[53:41] will go to meet them in the air and then
[53:42] we which are alive and remain if it's
[53:44] privileged if we're privileged or
[53:45] blessed to be that then our bodies will
[53:47] be changed our bodies will be swallowed
[53:49] up in life and then we'll go to meet him
[53:51] in the air that's what the Bible says
[53:53] and first that's thrown is for let's
[53:55] read it just just four so you got it
[53:56] first Thessalonians chapter four just so
[54:00] no one knows or everybody knows I'm not
[54:02] making this up this is all in the Bible
[54:04] it's got to happen just like it happened
[54:06] in Jesus day everything in here has to
[54:07] happen
[54:08] praise God we're so grateful for that
[54:11] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 I
[54:14] believe Malachi can you read 16 and 17
[54:21] sir yes sir amen
[54:39] so you have Jesus Christ in the air and
[54:41] you have two groups with him those who
[54:43] are dead but now resurrected and those
[54:45] who don't have to die they get a body
[54:47] change and they go to meet Christ in the
[54:49] air you have two groups there and that's
[54:51] exactly what we saw on Mount
[54:52] Transfiguration let me skip ahead to the
[54:54] picture that's exactly what we see I'm
[54:56] out Transfiguration we have Peter James
[54:57] and John you have Jesus you have Moses
[55:00] and Moses represents those who died but
[55:03] are resurrected and then you have Elijah
[55:05] who never died and the he's worked those
[55:08] that are alive and remain he's the he's
[55:11] the symbol of all of us by God's grace
[55:13] you know if the rapture takes place in
[55:15] our life it might not it might be
[55:16] generations down the road but if it
[55:19] happens in our life we believe by the
[55:20] faith of Christ our bodies will be
[55:22] changed and we'll won't have to die
[55:24] we'll have to go meet that we'll go to
[55:25] meet our Lord in the air okay so let me
[55:28] go back and read the quotes so you got
[55:29] them here this is God's Word and
[55:33] fallible every word that he says come to
[55:35] pass he said now if we want we can take
[55:38] the 70 chapter of Matthew a few days
[55:40] after that Jesus take Peter James and
[55:42] John up into the mountain apart to be
[55:44] witnesses Peter James and John and they
[55:46] seen the kingdom of God come and power
[55:48] they seen the coming of the kingdom of
[55:51] God
[55:52] rehearsed right amen oh they were
[55:55] brought into view of watching the
[55:57] kingdom of God rehearse as it come the
[55:59] issuing in all of the millennium they
[56:02] seen the rehearsal now go to Matthew 16
[56:05] why did Jesus do this so in other words
[56:07] why did Jesus do this Jesus showed them
[56:11] this because he promised to do that in
[56:13] matthew 16 jesus promised to show some
[56:18] of them the coming of the Lord
[56:20] so they got a preview so Matthew chapter
[56:24] 16 verse 28 Lydia can you read that you
[56:32] got that oh you don't have it okay
[56:33] Malachi can you read 28 sorry amen
[56:43] so Jesus standing there he tells the
[56:45] disciples some of you are going to see
[56:46] the second coming of the Son of Man and
[56:48] so then a few days later I think we have
[56:51] seven days later from not mistaken Jesus
[56:54] takes some of them up and they see the
[56:56] preview or the rehearsal of the second
[56:59] coming of Jesus Christ there's going to
[57:01] be the dead in Christ there's going to
[57:03] be those which alive remain this is also
[57:05] a preview of God returning to Israel
[57:07] with the 144,000 amen so it's a
[57:10] beautiful preview and brother branham he
[57:13] likens it unto when the movie ten
[57:15] commandments by Cecil DeMille came out
[57:17] he said before Cecil DeMille movie came
[57:19] out he invited Oral Roberts aaand all
[57:22] these preachers to preview the movie
[57:24] before it was released to the public
[57:25] road Ram said that's what Jesus did on
[57:28] Mount Transfiguration he had a preview
[57:30] about what he was going to do and he
[57:32] invited these people to come and see it
[57:34] of course we know they didn't have to
[57:35] give their opinions Jesus was just
[57:37] showing them what it was going to be
[57:38] like
[57:38] praise God and he was rehearsing to them
[57:41] the second coming of the Lord so that's
[57:44] what we see by the grace of Lord now let
[57:45] me go a little bit further oh yeah I
[57:47] just read this to you
[57:48] he said Oral Roberts one of them Cecil
[57:51] DeMille the Ten Commandments he called
[57:53] her brother should care and brother
[57:54] Roberts many preachers across the land
[57:56] any preacher could come and be invited
[57:58] to come into their studio before the
[57:59] picture was ever released and let them
[58:01] see the rehearsal of it before it was
[58:03] ever showed out when they was charging
[58:05] $25 a ticket they seen the rehearsal of
[58:08] it that they might pass their opinion on
[58:10] whether there was any critics about it
[58:12] or what could be said so forth they seen
[58:14] it before the public seen it and Jesus
[58:17] said some of you standing here amen will
[58:19] not taste of death until they see the
[58:21] kingdom of God coming in power or see
[58:24] the Son of man coming in his kingdom
[58:25] rather see the Son of man coming in his
[58:28] kingdom amen oh so does that help by
[58:32] God's grace okay so more the answer
[58:35] Satan was arguing over Moses body
[58:37] because Satan had claimed on all the
[58:39] dead but God did not give it to Satan
[58:42] God resurrected Moses as a type of
[58:45] Christ and there's our scripture we read
[58:47] earlier he was contending give me that
[58:49] body give me that body and the devil and
[58:51] the ant Michael's like no rebuke the
[58:53] Lord rebukes you
[58:53] in other words he's not giving it the
[58:55] answer he said just rebuking you
[58:57] you and we're not gonna talk about it oh
[58:59] god is so great and the Prophet said in
[59:02] future home he said notice again he
[59:04] raised up Moses from the grave he was
[59:07] raised up where's his grave can anybody
[59:09] find it but read the book of Jude see
[59:13] the Archangel disputing with the
[59:14] Archangel Satan said the Michael said
[59:17] the Lord rebuke you disputing over the
[59:18] body of Moses I'm gonna skip ahead he
[59:22] said no his body was packed away the
[59:24] Angels took him he did not mortify he
[59:27] did not corrupt so brother Branham
[59:29] believed that even Moses was was
[59:32] raptured or resurrected even before the
[59:35] three days kind of like Jesus how the
[59:37] Bible said Jesus body did not corrupt
[59:39] right the Bible says that in Psalms
[59:41] chapter 16 so it didn't go past three
[59:44] days that's why I had to berate within
[59:46] the third day and so brother Branham
[59:48] even believe that perhaps Moses is his
[59:50] body did not corrupt either but that God
[59:53] resurrected it before it would corrupt
[59:56] and he says God took him up in the
[59:59] rapture
[1:00:00] so Moses had a half year to glory in the
[1:00:04] Old Testament every man went to the
[1:00:05] heart so yeah I hope I don't know if the
[1:00:08] people know this but here here so you
[1:00:09] know in the Old Testament every man went
[1:00:12] to the heart of the earth when they died
[1:00:14] and they're either tormented down there
[1:00:17] or they were put to Abraham's bosom and
[1:00:19] Jesus said this but remember God took
[1:00:22] Moses to heaven so Moses must not or
[1:00:24] maybe wasn't down there very long
[1:00:25] because Jesus said so shall the Son of
[1:00:28] Man be three days and nights in the
[1:00:29] heart of the earth so when Jesus died
[1:00:32] his body was left in the subtle
[1:00:34] but his spirit went to the heart of the
[1:00:36] earth and he preached the souls that
[1:00:37] were in prison okay we know the Bible
[1:00:41] says that in 1st Peter chapter 3 but
[1:00:43] remember Jesus also said when the beggar
[1:00:45] died he was carried by the Angels into
[1:00:48] Abraham's bosom so maybe Moses was there
[1:00:50] three days or a little short short of
[1:00:52] three days I don't know but at some
[1:00:54] point Jesus called his spirit back up or
[1:00:57] God called his spirit back up and then
[1:00:59] rat raptured him and took him to heaven
[1:01:02] so you when you died you either went to
[1:01:05] Abraham's bosom or you went to the place
[1:01:07] of torment which is like a prison house
[1:01:09] until the
[1:01:11] white throne judgment the day of
[1:01:12] judgment but we know now Abraham and
[1:01:15] Jesus resurrected he brought all those
[1:01:18] Saints up with him and many of them were
[1:01:20] seen and then he took him to heaven so
[1:01:22] now paradise isn't in the heart of the
[1:01:23] earth
[1:01:24] now paradise is up in heaven that's what
[1:01:26] the scripture says by God's grace so if
[1:01:29] you didn't know about that there's
[1:01:30] there's of course plenty more scriptures
[1:01:31] on that but I just want to give a quick
[1:01:32] answer to that that great question now
[1:01:35] here's some more let's look at look at
[1:01:38] Michael now this is my opinion only in
[1:01:40] my opinion Michael is only an archangel
[1:01:43] and he's not the person of Jesus Christ
[1:01:46] that's just my opinion I don't believe
[1:01:48] Mark Michael is actually Jesus Christ to
[1:01:52] me he's a type of Christ like the Sun is
[1:01:55] a type of Christ the son that we say
[1:01:58] that we see today that came up this
[1:01:59] morning thank God and here's why you we
[1:02:04] have five scriptures about Michael three
[1:02:05] of them are in Daniel one's in Jude
[1:02:07] one's in Revelation now here's where
[1:02:10] here's where people might think Michael
[1:02:12] is Christ because brother Graham twice
[1:02:14] says Michael's Christ but he never says
[1:02:17] it in the seals and he never says it
[1:02:20] thus saith the Lord so like brother
[1:02:22] William and I were talking yesterday
[1:02:23] when a prophet says something you've got
[1:02:27] to make sure you know if it's his
[1:02:28] opinion or if it's God talking okay
[1:02:31] because every prophets a man every
[1:02:32] prophet makes mistakes but a prophet
[1:02:35] what makes them a prophet is that when
[1:02:36] they say thus saith the Lord or if they
[1:02:39] say in the name of the Lord that has to
[1:02:42] happen if it doesn't then that man
[1:02:44] wasn't a prophet okay
[1:02:46] so brother Brandon when he was talking
[1:02:48] about Michael
[1:02:50] he never said that's thus saith the Lord
[1:02:52] or in the name of the Lord that was just
[1:02:54] his opinion and he only said it twice so
[1:02:56] I personally don't think Michael is
[1:02:58] Christ I personally Michael is just an
[1:03:01] angel or an archangel
[1:03:02] now here's my reasons the book of
[1:03:05] Hebrews says an angel cannot be called a
[1:03:07] son Michael is called an archangel and
[1:03:10] will read the scriptures next so you can
[1:03:12] see it angels cannot be called sons they
[1:03:16] can't now to me this whole idea you know
[1:03:19] like let's say let's say another church
[1:03:21] or we believe Michaels Christ well
[1:03:22] that's fine I'm not going to argue about
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:24] I'm not going to
[1:03:25] with you I'm not going to disfellowship
[1:03:26] with you to me this issue of Michael is
[1:03:29] he Christ or not to me it's just a minor
[1:03:31] it's not a major a major is are you born
[1:03:34] again are you saved are you filled with
[1:03:37] the Holy Ghost are you being sanctified
[1:03:39] right I are you living the Word of God
[1:03:42] all the what the Word of God says but
[1:03:45] what are Michaels Christ or not that
[1:03:47] doesn't really impact our salvation okay
[1:03:50] personally and that I can see I
[1:03:51] personally can't see that and if I if I
[1:03:53] missing something and then you know my
[1:03:55] prayer lord help me to be humble open my
[1:03:57] eyes so I can see what I'm missing
[1:03:58] because I just want to know God's truth
[1:04:00] I just want to be humble with it so this
[1:04:03] is a minor to me not a major and to me
[1:04:06] it's not even a heresy like if someone
[1:04:07] says well Michaels Christ to me it's not
[1:04:10] even a heresy unless they take that
[1:04:13] really far okay and then they start
[1:04:16] praying to Michael or worshiping Michael
[1:04:19] now that's wrong now you've got heresy
[1:04:21] because now you've got idolatry like if
[1:04:24] you change your name when now we're the
[1:04:25] church of Michael the son of God well
[1:04:28] now that's see now you're getting into a
[1:04:30] little bit of heresy there now you're
[1:04:32] giving worship to an angel because the
[1:04:33] Bible just calls him an archangel okay
[1:04:36] now here's the scripture Michael's
[1:04:38] called one of the chief Prince's which
[1:04:41] is interesting like again we don't have
[1:04:43] a whole lot of so to me I've always
[1:04:45] wanted now this and my thought is
[1:04:46] Michael one of the two cherubims that
[1:04:48] covered the mercy seat
[1:04:50] maybe we know brother Brandon brother
[1:04:52] man makes it sound like Lucifer was like
[1:04:54] right there you know and the Bible said
[1:04:57] the Bible said Lucifer was the anointed
[1:04:59] cherub that covereth so it seems like
[1:05:02] Lucifer was one of those two angels that
[1:05:04] was right by the throne of God it was
[1:05:06] Michael the other one I don't know it
[1:05:08] seems like it to me it seems like it
[1:05:09] because there's a war in heaven and
[1:05:11] Michael kicks Lucifer out of heaven
[1:05:13] that's what it seems like to me because
[1:05:15] the Bible said Michael has angels under
[1:05:18] him
[1:05:19] okay so then Michael's called the prince
[1:05:22] he's called the Prince of the Jews which
[1:05:24] that's interesting too he's one of the
[1:05:26] treaty princes but he's a prince of the
[1:05:28] Jews so interesting Daniel 12:1 at that
[1:05:32] time shall Michael stand up that Great
[1:05:34] Prince which standeth for the children
[1:05:35] of thy people so it must be that Michael
[1:05:38] standing there
[1:05:39] before the prince of god and he's
[1:05:40] standing up maybe he's reporting about
[1:05:43] what's going on with the Jews in heaven
[1:05:45] now we know God knows all about it but
[1:05:47] God likes to give people purpose on the
[1:05:49] earth right he likes to give angels
[1:05:51] purpose in heaven right God doesn't have
[1:05:53] to have ministering spirits are you with
[1:05:55] me God doesn't have to have us he
[1:05:58] chooses to have us by His amazing grace
[1:06:00] he chooses to have angels he chooses to
[1:06:03] make us remember the Bible said in acts
[1:06:05] 7 God doesn't need us God doesn't need
[1:06:08] our buildings God doesn't need but he
[1:06:10] chooses to have us for his pleasure and
[1:06:12] we are to live for the pleasure of God
[1:06:15] and so the same thing Michael perhaps
[1:06:18] reports you know to the Father he
[1:06:21] reports about the Jewish people because
[1:06:23] he's standing for them thank God amen
[1:06:26] aren't you glad Jesus Christ is standing
[1:06:28] for you praise God I don't know if the
[1:06:30] Gentiles have a chief Prince or not but
[1:06:31] we've got the chief we've got the Prince
[1:06:33] of Peace amen hallelujah we've got the
[1:06:36] Son of God the king of kings lord of
[1:06:37] lords sitting for us amen
[1:06:41] glory and look they're gonna stay and
[1:06:43] he's gonna stand for them when they're
[1:06:45] delivered so there must be some type of
[1:06:47] intercession you know that Michael gives
[1:06:50] member just like Gabriel had or just
[1:06:53] like that was Michael that interceded
[1:06:55] for Daniel remember he interceded for
[1:06:57] Daniel's prayer where Daniel prayed in
[1:06:59] twenty days of the twenty-one days later
[1:07:01] God sent the answer praise the Lord and
[1:07:05] just another thought on this one we've
[1:07:07] read this a few times but the Bible did
[1:07:09] not say one of the Archangels so it just
[1:07:11] said the Archangel so I don't know it
[1:07:13] could be so in other words what I'm
[1:07:15] saying Michael may not be that angel
[1:07:18] right there I'm just saying I don't know
[1:07:20] but it seems like he is cuz he's called
[1:07:22] D Archangel and maybe that's because
[1:07:24] Satan is no longer an archangel I don't
[1:07:26] know he lost his position he left his
[1:07:28] first to stay i I don't know I'm just
[1:07:30] trying to show you what the scripture
[1:07:32] says and because remember there was war
[1:07:34] in heaven Michael and his angels so
[1:07:36] Michaels one of the chief Prince's he's
[1:07:38] an archangel
[1:07:39] he has angels that obey Him underneath
[1:07:41] him just like the military the pattern
[1:07:44] of leadership and authority he had he's
[1:07:47] the head angel and he has angels under
[1:07:49] him now here's another
[1:07:52] Michael may have a part in both the New
[1:07:54] Testament rapture and the deliverance of
[1:07:57] the hundred forty-four thousand Jews but
[1:07:59] I'm not sure because the Bible we just
[1:08:01] read it the Bible says for the Lord
[1:08:03] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:08:04] shout with the voice of the Archangel I
[1:08:07] don't know if Jesus you know he stands
[1:08:10] up and says Michael
[1:08:11] blow the trumpet yeah I don't know or
[1:08:13] Michael call forth the dead I don't know
[1:08:16] what's gonna happen but the Bible said
[1:08:18] the Bible says that the voice of the
[1:08:21] Archangel and then the Trump of God now
[1:08:25] for us that have heard the message we
[1:08:27] know the shout has already gone forth
[1:08:29] that's the message to wake everybody up
[1:08:31] and get their lamps trimmed get ready
[1:08:33] for the coming the marriage of Jesus the
[1:08:36] voice of the Archangel would be the
[1:08:38] raising of the dead in Christ just like
[1:08:40] there was angels you know when Christ
[1:08:42] raised from the dead there was angels
[1:08:43] right there it is - so hyper that's what
[1:08:45] I personally believe if you asked me if
[1:08:47] you wanted my opinion I'd say the voice
[1:08:49] of the Archangel must be Jesus you know
[1:08:51] maybe sending Michael down to earth when
[1:08:53] the dead in Christ rise I don't know
[1:08:55] what's the voice of an archangel of the
[1:08:58] Archangel by the way the Archangel so it
[1:09:01] looks like Michael so it could be I
[1:09:05] don't know for sure and then the Trump
[1:09:07] of God that's the last thing and that's
[1:09:09] where the bodies are changed the Bible
[1:09:10] says in first Corinthians 15 that the
[1:09:12] Trump of God shall sound and the the
[1:09:14] bodies will be swallowed up death to be
[1:09:16] swallowed up in life and our bodies will
[1:09:18] be changed in the moment in the
[1:09:19] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump so
[1:09:23] see the last Trump is when we get our
[1:09:24] body change the voice of the Archangels
[1:09:26] the dead in Christ and the shout is
[1:09:28] getting everybody ready getting
[1:09:29] everybody ready now here's the two
[1:09:33] quotes just so you know once in 1955
[1:09:35] where the Prophet said and at that time
[1:09:38] Michael shall stand up the Great Prince
[1:09:39] he says Michael was Christ of course who
[1:09:42] fought the angelic Wars in heaven with
[1:09:43] the devil it it's possible I don't know
[1:09:46] it's possible Christ the mystery of God
[1:09:49] revealed the Prophet said the first
[1:09:52] thing that Lucifer done to separate the
[1:09:53] fellowship of God man he want to build
[1:09:55] him a United Kingdom a greater splendor
[1:09:58] and seemingly more culture to greater
[1:09:59] Kingdom than Michael Christ had so it
[1:10:02] looks like it could have been Christ but
[1:10:05] here's the scripture where I just
[1:10:06] I just feel like this says that an angel
[1:10:08] cannot be called a son beings made so
[1:10:11] much better than the Angels as he hath
[1:10:13] by inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:10:14] name than they for unto which of the
[1:10:17] Angels said he at any time thou art my
[1:10:18] son
[1:10:19] so the Paul saying you know when did God
[1:10:21] ever call an angel his son he never did
[1:10:24] so he had to create Christ who was made
[1:10:27] lower than the Angels he had to form a
[1:10:29] perfect body a sinless body in the womb
[1:10:32] of the Virgin Mary and again I'll be to
[1:10:36] him a father and he shall be to me a son
[1:10:37] and it says later in the chapter but to
[1:10:39] which of the Angels said he at any time
[1:10:41] sit on my right hand so God's not gonna
[1:10:43] have a right angel sit on his right hand
[1:10:45] it's gonna be his son this it's on his
[1:10:47] right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:10:50] thy footstool are they not all
[1:10:52] ministering spirits sent forth to
[1:10:54] minister for them who shall be heirs now
[1:10:56] look see are they not all so he's saying
[1:10:59] all angels our ministering spirits sent
[1:11:02] forth to minister for them who shall be
[1:11:04] heirs of salvation so can believe
[1:11:07] whatever you want Church I love you no
[1:11:10] matter what but if you start worshipping
[1:11:12] Michael I might have to check you on
[1:11:13] that one
[1:11:14] we don't want to go I don't I don't
[1:11:16] believe we're taught to do that when we
[1:11:19] read the book of Revelation they're all
[1:11:21] worshiping the lamb they're all worth
[1:11:24] being Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ you
[1:11:27] know so I don't think anybody will go
[1:11:29] that way but I just want to say that I I
[1:11:31] just want to warn you people can get off
[1:11:33] and take Michael too far in fact there
[1:11:35] was a church in New York I'd know this
[1:11:36] for a fact because I talked to the
[1:11:38] pastor he went through it he had to
[1:11:39] correct them there's a church in New
[1:11:41] York not long ago that they said they
[1:11:45] said the voice of the Archangel was
[1:11:48] Michael okay and then they said that
[1:11:51] that voice was already sounding and they
[1:11:53] made their pastor the voice of the
[1:11:56] Archangel they made their pastor Michael
[1:11:58] and that has already happened in New
[1:12:00] York and of course you know the brother
[1:12:04] of on he tried to help them get
[1:12:05] corrected on it but they still consider
[1:12:08] their pastor is the voice of the
[1:12:09] Archangel so that's that's idolatry you
[1:12:14] know that's worship and they and they
[1:12:16] worship this man and they won't let
[1:12:17] anyone listen to any other tapes than
[1:12:18] what this man then this
[1:12:20] okay so I'm just telling you without the
[1:12:23] Holy Spirit people are gonna get off the
[1:12:25] track that's why we need the Holy Spirit
[1:12:26] to keep us humble to keep us in the Word
[1:12:29] of God not to add anything or take
[1:12:32] anything away okay so does that help for
[1:12:36] the first question and that helped by
[1:12:37] God's grace amen and if you know as
[1:12:39] always if there's any other questions
[1:12:41] see me after service or email me text me
[1:12:43] I certainly like questions you know the
[1:12:47] Bible says to grow and grace the
[1:12:48] knowledge of the Lord and that's what we
[1:12:50] should always be doing I always love
[1:12:52] learning more about Jesus because it
[1:12:54] always helps me out somehow in my life I
[1:12:55] can find somehow all praise the Lord
[1:12:58] this is so encouraging this will
[1:13:00] encourage me you know to go further with
[1:13:02] God and this will help me this is such a
[1:13:04] blessing it'll always help you out
[1:13:05] somehow make you be thankful make you
[1:13:08] make you worship make you love God more
[1:13:11] you know there's always whenever God
[1:13:12] reveals something there's always some
[1:13:14] blessing behind it
[1:13:15] amen here's the next question can a
[1:13:19] mentally ill person receive the Holy
[1:13:21] Ghost and there's more to the question a
[1:13:24] believer has been diagnosed with
[1:13:27] schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
[1:13:29] she's been burden her whole life with
[1:13:31] this the family suffers because of
[1:13:34] outbreaks of daily yelling cussing and
[1:13:38] physical altercations actually I forgot
[1:13:42] I forgot a slide but Mike wet my answer
[1:13:46] would be the person can be filled with
[1:13:48] the Holy Ghost before that happens I
[1:13:50] don't know how it could happen after
[1:13:52] because when that when that demon comes
[1:13:54] in or that spirit comes in it's a spirit
[1:13:56] of torment okay so it would have to
[1:14:00] happen before that's my understanding
[1:14:02] so let me show you some scriptures and
[1:14:03] quotes about this but I could be wrong
[1:14:06] like I said I'm open to be be corrected
[1:14:08] I'm willing to be corrected but I'll
[1:14:10] just show you what what I've heard
[1:14:11] brother BAM saying what the Bible says
[1:14:13] in demonology brother Branham says now
[1:14:15] the first thing what a demon is you hear
[1:14:17] so many talking about people talking
[1:14:18] about a demon now a demon a devil all
[1:14:20] comes from one word the English word
[1:14:22] it's called a tormentor a fellow that
[1:14:25] torments is a devil an evil one and
[1:14:28] we've all had them right we've all been
[1:14:29] around but we've got to overcome them
[1:14:31] with love
[1:14:33] we've got a love the Tormentor that's
[1:14:36] right a fellow that torments is the
[1:14:38] devil okay now the Bible today is so I'm
[1:14:41] sorry is to most to many people become
[1:14:43] so old back book that Grandma and
[1:14:46] Grandpa read or something like that
[1:14:47] there's not much to it's for the old
[1:14:49] folks and so for people say it but
[1:14:51] that's wrong it's for everybody and
[1:14:53] demons are tormentors that torment us
[1:14:57] now there's demons that comes into the
[1:15:00] soul of men now brother Branham means
[1:15:02] spirit okay so let me let me get back to
[1:15:05] this now before 1963 brother Branham had
[1:15:08] these three parts of man switched around
[1:15:10] and this is all in the Bible
[1:15:13] for those who don't know the Bible
[1:15:15] literally says we have three parts we
[1:15:17] have a soul spirit and body the Bible
[1:15:20] literally says that we have three parts
[1:15:22] and so before 1963 before God revealed
[1:15:25] it to him he thought the Spirit was the
[1:15:27] very core of a person but later he
[1:15:29] preached it and showed how the soul is
[1:15:31] actually the core of the person because
[1:15:35] the Bible says the sould sinneth it
[1:15:37] shall die
[1:15:38] the soul and we talked about 3,000 souls
[1:15:42] were saved on the day of Pentecost so
[1:15:44] it's the soul the spirit can go through
[1:15:47] good times the spirit can go through
[1:15:49] hard times you can have a broken spirit
[1:15:50] a wounded spirit a rejoicing spirit you
[1:15:53] can have a healed spirit this is our
[1:15:55] mind okay and so I just want everybody
[1:15:58] to see this before the person gets
[1:15:59] tormented with a like schizophrenia or
[1:16:02] any demon torment their soul can be
[1:16:05] sealed here but yet have no torment that
[1:16:10] can happen brother Branham tells us that
[1:16:11] that can happen okay but their spirit
[1:16:14] can go through torment and their body
[1:16:17] can go through torment
[1:16:18] remember when Jesus sweat drops of blood
[1:16:20] the Bible called that depression that
[1:16:22] was and there's no greater depression on
[1:16:24] we think we've been depressed right and
[1:16:26] we have right some of us been depressed
[1:16:27] but you've never been depressed where
[1:16:29] you sweat blood profusely so Jesus was
[1:16:33] tormented in his spirit how can I go to
[1:16:36] the cross how can I endure this huh and
[1:16:37] he prayed about it three times still
[1:16:39] sweat of depression sweat the blood
[1:16:41] drops a sweat of depression poured on
[1:16:43] his forehead in this
[1:16:45] none of us have been through that okay
[1:16:48] so none of us have been tormented like
[1:16:49] that but remember Jesus had this the
[1:16:53] Dove with the remember the Dove came
[1:16:54] down it ascended descended on his soul
[1:16:56] he was sealed but yet he went through
[1:16:58] this tremendous torment in his spirit
[1:17:01] and then in his body he was you know
[1:17:02] beaten and bruised and bloodied and
[1:17:04] stabbed with a spear and all crown of
[1:17:07] thorns he went through all this torment
[1:17:10] but they could never touch his soul and
[1:17:12] that's true for you and I Satan can do
[1:17:14] it God can make let Satan do whatever he
[1:17:16] wants in our body in our spirits but
[1:17:18] thank God our souls are sealed to the
[1:17:20] day of our Redemption
[1:17:21] thank God Satan can't touch your soul
[1:17:23] because the Bible said you're he's
[1:17:25] sealed out amen Christ is sealed in and
[1:17:28] he's sealed out the devil is sealed out
[1:17:30] of your soul he cannot change your
[1:17:32] destination hallelujah thank God for
[1:17:36] that so let me read the quote now
[1:17:40] there's demons that comes into that on
[1:17:41] this is the spirit this he means spirit
[1:17:43] of man because he change it later on I
[1:17:45] hope everybody understands it okay and
[1:17:47] the phraseology would be and I'd say
[1:17:49] that's the demon that comes into the
[1:17:51] spirit not so it's something that
[1:17:53] torments the spirit many times you can
[1:17:56] see a person maybe of insanity now they
[1:17:58] may be a converted person fill with the
[1:18:01] holy spirit and yet be totally insane
[1:18:04] that can happen you see that's right
[1:18:08] that has nothing to do with the soul or
[1:18:09] anything in this case yeah well in that
[1:18:11] case it's right it's a torment or
[1:18:12] something that torments them and brother
[1:18:14] William and I were talking about this
[1:18:15] yesterday you know think about all the
[1:18:18] hard things God let believers go through
[1:18:20] you know we just mentioned Jesus what
[1:18:23] about Elijah Elijah
[1:18:24] I'm sorry Lisha Eli sure did twice as
[1:18:27] many miracles Elijah but he died of an
[1:18:30] awful disease the Bible said God let
[1:18:33] that prophet die of a disease right God
[1:18:35] didn't heal him right yeah but God let
[1:18:38] him die and then God lets brother
[1:18:39] Branham die by getting hit by a drunk
[1:18:42] driver at a car accident right God let
[1:18:45] his own son die on a cross naked
[1:18:47] stripped bloodied and bruised and beaten
[1:18:49] and cut and blah God let his own son do
[1:18:52] that so we must understand is that God
[1:18:55] we that God has a plan and purpose for
[1:18:57] all of our lives
[1:18:58] and God may at some point someone made
[1:19:01] me feel with the Holy Ghost of the power
[1:19:02] of Jesus in their heart they love Christ
[1:19:05] they obey every word of God they see
[1:19:07] signs wonders and miracles they love the
[1:19:09] Lord Jesus butts later on in life God
[1:19:12] may allow them to go through a test a
[1:19:15] trial and one of them could be insanity
[1:19:18] we just have to understand that that God
[1:19:21] can allow that so again the soul can be
[1:19:27] sealed but then torment can be filling a
[1:19:30] person's mind it's very possible think
[1:19:33] about well think about this how many
[1:19:34] people have we known in the message that
[1:19:36] we believe or see what the Holy Ghost
[1:19:38] but then later on life they lost their
[1:19:40] minds Alzheimer's you name it you mean
[1:19:43] think about that think about all those
[1:19:45] you know situations that happen to
[1:19:47] people that doesn't impact their soul
[1:19:49] and thank God it doesn't amen thank God
[1:19:52] it doesn't but see God's allowing that
[1:19:54] for a test to the individual but also a
[1:19:57] test or trial for the family right to
[1:20:00] see how they going to love and care for
[1:20:01] their elderly loved ones or not you know
[1:20:04] it's a test it's it's it's a test for
[1:20:06] everyone this whole life is a great big
[1:20:07] test and we want to put a pass with an
[1:20:09] A+ by the blood of Christ but the only
[1:20:12] way we're gonna pass this would be
[1:20:13] studying studying up for the tests to
[1:20:16] know to have the Holy Spirit direct us
[1:20:18] to the answers for the tests because we
[1:20:21] don't know what's gonna be on the test
[1:20:22] all the time but we know we're gonna be
[1:20:23] tested and so that's what we have to do
[1:20:26] remember this testimony brother Brian
[1:20:29] was talking 1965 he said oh if we could
[1:20:31] only learn that that what part of the
[1:20:34] word we are see what what part of the
[1:20:35] word are we we must take our place no
[1:20:38] matter what it is
[1:20:39] amen but may have said I think of a
[1:20:43] little sister here in the wheelchair
[1:20:44] somehow sometime so bro there's a and
[1:20:48] this is in Arizona right this is
[1:20:49] impressed Scott there was a little girl
[1:20:51] in a wheelchair there that brother
[1:20:54] Brandon would see from time to time when
[1:20:55] he would come back and preach he said
[1:20:57] how many faithful prayers had been made
[1:21:00] over it he said but then we don't
[1:21:03] understand so he just committed to God
[1:21:06] so brother Branham would pray for this
[1:21:08] woman and pray for this little girl pray
[1:21:10] for and nothing
[1:21:11] what happened yet other people would be
[1:21:13] healed his wife would be healed of a
[1:21:15] tumor right blind eyes would open you
[1:21:18] know across my baby's eyes would go
[1:21:20] straight we have testimonies of all God
[1:21:22] doing all these things
[1:21:24] Tim Meyers wife's grandmother being
[1:21:26] healed of tuberculosis in 1951 and I met
[1:21:30] the woman she would die of tuberculosis
[1:21:32] and I brother Graham told her thus saith
[1:21:35] the Lord are gonna be healed and I met
[1:21:36] the woman God healed her of tuberculosis
[1:21:38] but then God lets a little baby a little
[1:21:41] little girl here sit in a wheelchair we
[1:21:46] got to find our place in the Word of God
[1:21:48] what place does God want us to play now
[1:21:53] look what brother Branham says she is a
[1:21:55] flower here among you Mahajan's
[1:21:59] with her pleasantness and everything see
[1:22:03] that we can get up and go around how she
[1:22:06] would longed to do that but yet she is
[1:22:08] pleasant just the way she sits I always
[1:22:12] get not depressed I always get inspired
[1:22:16] to watch the little lady because we all
[1:22:21] believe in healing we've seen God do
[1:22:23] americo's far beyond that and she knows
[1:22:25] that to see but she's willing to take
[1:22:27] her place
[1:22:28] they hate men in that beautiful she's
[1:22:34] willing if God doesn't want to heal me
[1:22:35] praise the Lord
[1:22:36] I'll praise God anyway now church it may
[1:22:39] be because of this I don't know why it
[1:22:41] may be on the day of judgment maybe she
[1:22:43] has to stand there and other people that
[1:22:45] were in wheelchairs will say well God
[1:22:46] you didn't heal me that's why I didn't
[1:22:48] serve you but God will bring her up and
[1:22:50] say well I Love You Lord no matter what
[1:22:53] even though you wouldn't heal me I still
[1:22:54] loved you and I accepted forgiveness for
[1:22:56] my sins and I serve you all the days of
[1:22:58] my life
[1:22:58] your grace was overflowing you gave me
[1:23:01] peace even during my lifetime even
[1:23:02] though you didn't hear me you gave me
[1:23:03] peace in my soul forgave all my sins and
[1:23:06] I didn't reject the cross and yet
[1:23:09] someone rejects the cross and all
[1:23:13] because what God would it heal me you
[1:23:16] see how God may have to do that someday
[1:23:18] we don't know we don't know and like I
[1:23:21] told somebody this week I said they say
[1:23:24] why can't
[1:23:24] see my children and I said well you need
[1:23:26] to go and see God and God will show you
[1:23:28] if not now God will show you eventually
[1:23:31] they were wondering is this because of
[1:23:33] my sins or is this a test the only way
[1:23:35] to know is you got to see God you've got
[1:23:38] to get down on your knees you got a fast
[1:23:40] and pray
[1:23:41] you've got to consecrate your life to
[1:23:42] Christ and you've got to call out to God
[1:23:44] for an answer who your answer you now or
[1:23:46] later
[1:23:46] but either way while you're caught up to
[1:23:48] God I believe he'll fill you with such
[1:23:49] love amen I believe he'll fill you with
[1:23:51] such confidence and peace and faith that
[1:23:54] no matter what he says you'll be
[1:23:55] grateful for his will anyway
[1:23:57] amen and so you know I always take this
[1:24:03] scripture to the Bible said we exhort
[1:24:05] you brethren warn them they're unruly
[1:24:07] people that don't do right things give
[1:24:08] them a warning but we're also to comfort
[1:24:11] the feeble-minded we're supposed to try
[1:24:13] to bring comfort to people and that
[1:24:15] actually means faint-hearted so this
[1:24:17] would maybe not be like someone with
[1:24:19] schizophrenia but but just someone who's
[1:24:20] always down and discouraged how can I
[1:24:23] make it through another week I don't
[1:24:24] know if I could Lord I just don't know
[1:24:25] if I can make it through another month I
[1:24:27] don't know if I can make it through
[1:24:28] another year well you know when is God
[1:24:31] gonna hear my prayer we're supposed to
[1:24:33] comfort them and say God is with you can
[1:24:35] I pray for you can I help you out anyway
[1:24:37] we're supposed to be the ones who
[1:24:39] provide comfort for those people and
[1:24:40] then the Bible said support the weak now
[1:24:43] this can definitely be a prompt lied to
[1:24:45] someone with schizophrenia or any
[1:24:47] disease we're supposed to provide
[1:24:49] support for the weak and then be patient
[1:24:52] toward all men huh me know that sickness
[1:24:54] brings patience I mean those that trials
[1:24:58] and and discouragement it builds
[1:24:59] patience in you you are forced to wait
[1:25:02] you don't have a choice
[1:25:05] God forces you in the Bible what Jesus
[1:25:07] said in patience possess your souls so
[1:25:10] it is while you're waiting and being
[1:25:12] patient Lord I just got it I'll just
[1:25:13] have to be patient have another choice
[1:25:14] that's when you're learning to possess
[1:25:16] salvation I know God will hear me I'm
[1:25:18] waiting he may not do it now but I'm
[1:25:20] learning patience and I'll wait on the
[1:25:22] Lord that's when you learn to really
[1:25:24] possess your salvation because in
[1:25:26] patience you possess your souls it's in
[1:25:29] that difficult time you know like I told
[1:25:32] you the story before God hear my momma
[1:25:33] cancer in the church and another woman
[1:25:36] in the church the very next year year
[1:25:38] after
[1:25:38] had the same cancer the same place and
[1:25:40] died and you know I just I sit there and
[1:25:44] cry like well god why did you heal my
[1:25:45] mom and not this other one I don't know
[1:25:47] it's up to God we've got to find our
[1:25:50] place in the Word of God we got to find
[1:25:53] what's the purpose of God for our lives
[1:25:54] and why doesn't why does this happen why
[1:25:57] we've got to trust God God is not the
[1:25:59] author of confusion God's the author of
[1:26:02] order praise God God is the author of
[1:26:04] understanding and and purpose and
[1:26:06] meaning God gives us meaning for all
[1:26:08] these things there's a meaning behind
[1:26:09] all of our suffering but we've got to be
[1:26:12] willing to seek God to find it I've got
[1:26:14] to humble ourselves remember the Bible
[1:26:16] said all contention comes from pride oh
[1:26:19] god you should not have done that that's
[1:26:21] pride oh god I know better than you this
[1:26:23] would have been better and we we can't
[1:26:25] say things like that
[1:26:26] we can't let things like that come out
[1:26:29] of our mouths we have to be humble and
[1:26:31] not prideful we got to be humble not
[1:26:35] arrogant now I do want to say this
[1:26:37] recently we had something happened the
[1:26:39] message a few years ago with mental
[1:26:42] illness you do have to use a lot of
[1:26:44] wisdom in 2000 January to 2016 Kenneth
[1:26:49] Janz a trustee and musician at Happy
[1:26:52] Valley Church of Jesus Christ in
[1:26:53] Tennessee was shot and killed by his
[1:26:55] daughter he was 77 I think now his
[1:27:00] daughter had experienced mental illness
[1:27:03] beginning at 45 years old so she lived a
[1:27:06] forty five years without any trouble and
[1:27:09] all of a sudden at 45
[1:27:10] she had mental illness and ten years
[1:27:14] later she shot her father they would
[1:27:16] take her I read the articles online they
[1:27:18] interviewed the family and everything
[1:27:20] they would take her to institutions
[1:27:23] every time she had a flare-up you know
[1:27:24] every time she had a flare they would
[1:27:25] they would pray for her there just God
[1:27:27] you know placing your hands all these
[1:27:29] things she had grown children she had
[1:27:34] grown children now the courts ruled her
[1:27:39] insane but she didn't go to prison she
[1:27:41] went to a mental health facility what
[1:27:44] happened is that she had access to guns
[1:27:47] somehow she had access to guns I don't
[1:27:50] know if she knew the locks you know or
[1:27:52] the calm
[1:27:52] nations on the locks I don't know what
[1:27:54] happened but she had this spell she went
[1:27:57] through a spell where she thought her
[1:27:58] father had killed her son and her son
[1:28:02] called her that day and like no mom I'm
[1:28:04] fine I'm fine but she couldn't get out
[1:28:06] of her mind she was in one of those fits
[1:28:07] she took the gun and shot her dad and he
[1:28:10] was a musician in the trusty and and so
[1:28:14] you know I say all that to to say you
[1:28:16] know you got to have wisdom if you have
[1:28:17] some mental illness you know you got
[1:28:19] that you have to support the weak you
[1:28:22] have to be patient and you have to be
[1:28:24] very careful what they know and what
[1:28:26] they have access to okay does everyone
[1:28:29] understand that you just got to be very
[1:28:31] careful God may heal them God may not
[1:28:34] but we have to use wisdom and I remember
[1:28:38] I remember when that happened I was
[1:28:39] listening to a lot of the sermons at
[1:28:41] that time from Tennessee and it was a
[1:28:43] very very hard time no doubt very sad
[1:28:45] time but that's one thing that kind of
[1:28:49] hit home to me we got to be very careful
[1:28:51] with mental illness now brother Branham
[1:28:54] of course saw mental illness healed many
[1:28:56] times there's one case where there was a
[1:28:59] woman with five children and there's and
[1:29:03] remember she was so demon-possessed
[1:29:05] brother Graham tried to grab ahold of
[1:29:07] her and he had best had to rip his arm
[1:29:10] out of her grasp because she was so
[1:29:11] strong and she was making noises and all
[1:29:14] these things and the husband she sold
[1:29:18] everything on their farm almost to come
[1:29:20] see brother Brandon to see if they could
[1:29:21] get healed and he said brother Branham
[1:29:23] now he said no he said I don't know what
[1:29:25] I got I don't know what I'm gonna do so
[1:29:28] you just broke down crying and she's got
[1:29:29] five little children at home she's been
[1:29:31] a good woman she Harold these old clods
[1:29:33] and helped me to raise cotton crop so
[1:29:35] this woman was well for many years five
[1:29:37] children worked on the farm but when she
[1:29:40] taken sick I've done everything I could
[1:29:42] do I sold my farm in order to get here
[1:29:44] brother Branham I had one thing left a
[1:29:45] pair of mules I sold them this was in
[1:29:48] 1950 actually probably 1949 it's on tape
[1:29:53] I sold them to her brother to get her
[1:29:55] 200 miles to bring her here why now
[1:29:57] she's kicked the glass out of the car
[1:29:58] and her limbs are bleeding she hasn't
[1:30:00] been off her back for two years and
[1:30:03] don't even know her own name this is how
[1:30:06] serious it is and about that time she
[1:30:08] turned around and she said william
[1:30:09] branham you have nothing to do with me I
[1:30:11] brought her here so that was a demon
[1:30:13] speaking through this woman and I said
[1:30:16] and the father he said that's not her
[1:30:19] that's the devil speaking out of her
[1:30:20] that's right they recognize they know he
[1:30:23] said why brother brand that's the first
[1:30:24] word she spoken in two years so this
[1:30:26] woman hadn't talked for two years then
[1:30:28] all of a sudden she says you know
[1:30:29] William Branham I have nothing to do
[1:30:30] with you that's because he was a
[1:30:31] minister of the gospel and I said the
[1:30:34] devil just used her lips just like it
[1:30:36] was in the case of Legion in the days of
[1:30:38] Jesus she come crawling over to me that
[1:30:41] way and said you ain't got nothing to do
[1:30:42] with me crawling like that and I said
[1:30:44] brother do you believe this story that
[1:30:45] you heard me tell about the coming of
[1:30:46] that angel and he said with all my heart
[1:30:49] as he threw his arms around me I walked
[1:30:51] to the corner of the step and I prayed
[1:30:53] with all my heart to Lord Jesus so she's
[1:30:55] down in the basement he just walks over
[1:30:57] to the last step and prays for he
[1:30:58] doesn't even lay hands on her he just
[1:31:02] praised her because that's wisdom right
[1:31:03] she would have killed him so there's
[1:31:06] wisdom right you got we have to use
[1:31:08] wisdom with people with mental illnesses
[1:31:10] and I said God look at that poor woman
[1:31:13] five little innocent children at home no
[1:31:15] mother
[1:31:16] one suckling baby I said what can happen
[1:31:18] Oh God have mercy and the Spirit of the
[1:31:21] Lord came and I asked the devil to leave
[1:31:23] the woman I turned back around I said
[1:31:26] now do you believe it he said with all
[1:31:27] my heart what should I do with her
[1:31:28] brother Branham I said take her back so
[1:31:30] they didn't see a healing immediately
[1:31:32] but Graham said take her back take her
[1:31:34] right on back to the sanatorium or the
[1:31:35] institution in the facility and I said
[1:31:38] if you don't doubt one thing that I told
[1:31:40] you watch what will happen so see he had
[1:31:42] to believe - that's what Jesus said be
[1:31:44] done to you according to your faith
[1:31:46] we've got to believe the promise of God
[1:31:48] and though it's hard but we got to
[1:31:49] believe it and faith always get the
[1:31:51] victory over unbelief two months after
[1:31:53] that I was in Jonesboro Arkansas where
[1:31:56] there's many things was happening some
[1:31:57] 28,000 people gathered in the city and I
[1:32:00] was speaking pressing or waving their
[1:32:02] hands at me some woman and she said
[1:32:04] don't you recognize me brother Branham I
[1:32:05] said no ma'am I said you all of you
[1:32:08] excuse me she said I just wanted to see
[1:32:10] you I seen somebody laughing there it
[1:32:12] was her husband and there she was
[1:32:13] sitting there just as normal in her
[1:32:15] right mind with her five little children
[1:32:17] just as perfect as she could be
[1:32:19] but BAM said see they taken her back you
[1:32:21] know so they drugged her back in this
[1:32:23] car that had the windows kicked out
[1:32:25] because she was so demon-possessed
[1:32:26] but she never kicked the car one time
[1:32:29] going back to see God was giving her a
[1:32:31] little bit of healing a little bit of
[1:32:32] healing a little more victory as the
[1:32:34] time went on they put her back in the
[1:32:36] padded cell the second morning they went
[1:32:38] in to feed her she was setting up so not
[1:32:40] laying on the floor now she's up and on
[1:32:43] the fourth and third or fourth morning
[1:32:45] they dismissed her as a well person and
[1:32:47] sent her home to her children Jesus
[1:32:49] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:32:51] forever amen thank God for that praise
[1:32:53] the Lord yeah God his God is so merciful
[1:32:56] so whatever way Jesus wants to heal
[1:32:59] someone we just have to be sensitive to
[1:33:01] what he's leading us to do okay I can't
[1:33:04] think of a now my life I don't think
[1:33:06] I've anyone seen anyone healed of mental
[1:33:09] illness although I have seen God bring
[1:33:10] out numerous people out of depression so
[1:33:13] much more when I tried to pray for them
[1:33:14] they would fight and kick and eventually
[1:33:16] God brought them out of that by the
[1:33:17] grace of the Lord that's happened
[1:33:19] numerous times on numerous occasions
[1:33:21] where God is I prayed over people and
[1:33:23] God has cast out the demons that's
[1:33:25] happened numerous times before I've seen
[1:33:26] that so in this case that's what I'd say
[1:33:31] I would say support this person love
[1:33:33] them because patient as you possibly can
[1:33:35] with them and maybe pray about having a
[1:33:37] minister come over to the house to pray
[1:33:39] for the person or try to bring the
[1:33:41] person to a service but make sure you're
[1:33:43] ready if that devil flares up make sure
[1:33:45] you're ready to use wisdom so that
[1:33:47] person doesn't hurt somebody else you
[1:33:50] just have to use wisdom and you have to
[1:33:51] say God leading me and guiding me I
[1:33:53] don't want to put anybody else in danger
[1:33:54] but we desire healing and so with this
[1:33:56] person with brother branham she didn't
[1:33:57] even make it to the meeting she just
[1:33:59] stayed in the basement the whole time
[1:34:00] she couldn't even go in the service but
[1:34:03] brother Graham we got as close as she
[1:34:04] could and just prayed and asked for
[1:34:06] God's grace and God chose the healer
[1:34:07] like we know the woman the little girl
[1:34:09] in the wheelchair God didn't heal her
[1:34:10] but she still loved the Lord Jesus with
[1:34:13] all her heart so I hope that helps by
[1:34:16] the grace of Lord that's that's what I
[1:34:17] can find out about mental illness it's a
[1:34:20] spirit it's a demon spirit that's
[1:34:21] entered someone's mind tormenting them
[1:34:24] and somehow God has allowed it and we
[1:34:28] have to ask for God's wisdom to how to
[1:34:30] handle that whether God's going to heal
[1:34:32] them or not
[1:34:34] okay I got two more by God's grace all
[1:34:38] right good
[1:34:38] that's a good question I've never heard
[1:34:41] this question before why does the Bible
[1:34:42] mention the Book of Enoch if it's not
[1:34:45] inspired that's a good question
[1:34:47] did Christians write the Book of Enoch
[1:34:49] those are all good questions really good
[1:34:52] questions now the answer to me
[1:34:56] I believe the Book of Enoch actually
[1:35:00] copied the book of Jude and not vice
[1:35:03] versa so I I don't believe the Book of
[1:35:06] Enoch is inspired and here's why but try
[1:35:09] not to jump ahead of me I know we long
[1:35:10] program to read but people say oh anak
[1:35:14] wrote The Book of Enoch so we should
[1:35:16] make that part of the Bible
[1:35:17] very few people believe that okay very
[1:35:19] few but the argument is there's a
[1:35:23] passage in the Book of Enoch that says
[1:35:25] the Lord will come with 10,000 of his
[1:35:28] Saints that's in the Book of Enoch you
[1:35:29] can see it online okay and that same
[1:35:32] phrase is in Jude verses 14 and 15 so
[1:35:36] people say well see Jude copied off of
[1:35:38] Enoch but I don't believe that I believe
[1:35:42] Jude's writing was before the Book of
[1:35:44] Enoch and I believe someone impersonated
[1:35:47] the book someone impersonated Enoch and
[1:35:49] wrote their own book and this is why
[1:35:52] because okay well before that here it is
[1:35:57] we don't need the Book of Enoch to
[1:35:59] determine that Enoch was a seventh from
[1:36:01] Adam we don't need that because we only
[1:36:02] need Genesis 5 verse 1 to 24 for that so
[1:36:06] also in the Book of Enoch it says he's
[1:36:07] for the seventh from Adam but we don't
[1:36:09] even need that because that started in
[1:36:10] the book of Genesis here's the reason I
[1:36:12] don't believe in it the Book of Enoch
[1:36:15] supports angels fathering children let's
[1:36:19] go to Genesis 6 some people might not
[1:36:20] know about this but it's a popular
[1:36:23] doctrine among some people that believe
[1:36:25] in angels can turn into humans it's not
[1:36:27] there's nothing in the Bible about that
[1:36:29] Genesis 6 verse 1 and it came to
[1:36:39] men began to multiply on the face of the
[1:36:41] earth the daughters were born of unto
[1:36:44] them that the sons of God saw the
[1:36:46] daughters of men that they were fair and
[1:36:50] they chose them lives of all which they
[1:36:53] chose and the Lord said my spirit shall
[1:36:55] not always strive with man for that he
[1:36:58] also is flesh yet his day should be one
[1:37:00] hundred and twenty years there were
[1:37:02] giants in the earth in those days and
[1:37:05] also after that when the sons of God
[1:37:07] came in unto the daughters of men and
[1:37:09] they bare children to them and the same
[1:37:13] became mighty men which were of old men
[1:37:16] of renown okay so people read this text
[1:37:19] and they'll say oh see the the sons of
[1:37:21] God were angels that came down and they
[1:37:23] they married daughters of men and now we
[1:37:26] have Giants that's that's wrong that you
[1:37:28] you cannot do that and program tells us
[1:37:31] why if you allow that then you have
[1:37:34] Satan is now a creator because now Satan
[1:37:38] can combine with humanity and create a
[1:37:41] different offspring that God didn't
[1:37:43] create no Giants are just a difference
[1:37:46] in the DNA pool that's all Giants are
[1:37:49] like you have Manute Bol you know he was
[1:37:51] about seven seven you have yo Ming that
[1:37:54] NBA player he's almost 8 feet tall you
[1:37:56] know that's just in the gene pool ok you
[1:37:59] cannot make Satan a creator that would
[1:38:02] make him equal with God and he's not
[1:38:03] equal with God the Bible said there's
[1:38:05] only one creator there's only one wise
[1:38:07] all-powerful God so angels cannot mate
[1:38:13] with humans is impossible they they
[1:38:16] they're the Bible said they're spirits
[1:38:17] and we are flesh okay and you cannot do
[1:38:20] that so the sons of God were actually
[1:38:24] the descendants of Seth they're thus the
[1:38:27] sentence of Seth that married daughters
[1:38:29] of men or women who are not believers in
[1:38:32] Jehovah and after that then you started
[1:38:36] getting giants okay it's a it's a
[1:38:38] mixture of the DNA pool okay now here's
[1:38:42] where Bob Arum says it he said a doctor
[1:38:44] DeHaan takes Josephus his stand and say
[1:38:48] that they pressed themselves the angels
[1:38:50] press themselves into human flesh and
[1:38:51] taking on them wives and
[1:38:53] there were giants in the Land of Nod and
[1:38:55] they had taken them to themselves wives
[1:38:57] and live with them when the sons of God
[1:38:59] the Fallen Angels taken and seen the
[1:39:01] daughters of men and the sex desire was
[1:39:03] such a great thing and yet them being
[1:39:05] sinful from falling they pressed
[1:39:06] themselves in the human flesh that's
[1:39:08] what that Josephus believes as well
[1:39:10] apparently if they do that they'd spoil
[1:39:13] divine healing they'd spoil everything
[1:39:16] else if the devil can
[1:39:25] you
[1:39:29] because Satan's not a creator he doesn't
[1:39:32] have power power like that he does have
[1:39:35] power but not that kind of power he
[1:39:36] cannot create he only perverts what has
[1:39:39] been created he is no creator he's only
[1:39:42] a pervert err okay that's an excellent
[1:39:45] question but I think here's what I think
[1:39:48] happened I think I mean the Book of
[1:39:51] Enoch could have been written by someone
[1:39:52] before the time of Jude you know it
[1:39:54] could have been but either way I just
[1:39:57] believe Satan used that Book of Enoch as
[1:39:59] a distraction to try to pull people away
[1:40:01] from believing the truth of God's Word
[1:40:03] and especially serpents eat right
[1:40:04] because this ties in a lot with serpents
[1:40:06] eat because what happened was Satan
[1:40:08] entered into a human body I'm sorry a
[1:40:10] body that was like human which was a
[1:40:12] serpent seduced Eve right and then
[1:40:15] produced a serpent seed Cain who is of
[1:40:18] his father the devil the Bible says and
[1:40:20] that produced more DNA trouble I would
[1:40:24] say like that more of a mixture of DNA
[1:40:26] trouble right okay a fallen man polluted
[1:40:30] the polluted DNA pool the gene pool
[1:40:33] that's polluted so that's what and this
[1:40:35] is this causes distraction that's what
[1:40:37] the Nephilim that's this is called the
[1:40:39] Nephilim doctrine where angels can mate
[1:40:41] with humans that's why that's wrong it's
[1:40:43] just the perversion it's a distraction
[1:40:44] and it's off the Word of God so if
[1:40:47] anybody said anything about now I
[1:40:48] haven't read The Book of Enoch but
[1:40:50] there's like four sections the first
[1:40:51] section is about that and the second one
[1:40:53] is about all his heavenly visions so I
[1:40:56] imagine if we open that up we probably
[1:40:57] find some other things that were false
[1:40:59] you know things like that so right away
[1:41:02] we know according to the first chapter
[1:41:03] of the Book of Enoch we know it was a
[1:41:05] false work and it's not inspired of the
[1:41:08] Word of God okay so a great question
[1:41:11] there that was a wonderful question okay
[1:41:14] last question and if my Hauer i got six
[1:41:17] minutes and my hours done and save a
[1:41:24] tough one for the last one I had this
[1:41:27] question I think this is a great
[1:41:28] question what are your thoughts about
[1:41:31] mixed marriages so like white marrying
[1:41:34] black black marrying white I preached
[1:41:36] this before but I just want everyone to
[1:41:38] know the reason this is a question is
[1:41:41] because brother Branham lived in the
[1:41:44] before civil rights and he lived during
[1:41:47] the Jim Crow laws and the reason this is
[1:41:50] a question the message is because
[1:41:51] brother Branham just believed they
[1:41:53] should have always stayed separate he
[1:41:57] you know as far as marriages he always
[1:41:59] thought blacks should just marry
[1:42:00] black-white marry white and so forth
[1:42:03] like that and he was very heart he was
[1:42:05] very firm and harsh about it brother
[1:42:09] Graham called it a pitiful thing if a
[1:42:10] white and black married you know he
[1:42:13] called it he was pretty harsh with it
[1:42:14] now for me though I I I don't I don't go
[1:42:17] that harsh myself and he's the man he's
[1:42:21] allowed to have his own opinion I I
[1:42:23] believe brother ban was a prophet I
[1:42:24] respect him as a prophet but program
[1:42:27] taught us everything you believe take it
[1:42:29] back to the Bible okay and then one
[1:42:33] there's one case of a William and I were
[1:42:34] talking mother yesterday brother Branham
[1:42:35] said if Martin Luther King Jr's not
[1:42:37] careful he's gonna lead millions of
[1:42:39] african-americans to a riot he called it
[1:42:43] a riot where they'd be slaughtered like
[1:42:45] let's say if the black people rose up
[1:42:48] for their civil rights and there was
[1:42:50] such a big crowd of them that you know
[1:42:51] brother BAM thought they might have a
[1:42:53] riot now they never did but he thought
[1:42:56] and brother Adam said this he thought
[1:42:58] Martin Luther King jr. is leading them
[1:42:59] to a death trap and there's going to be
[1:43:01] millions of them killed in riots that
[1:43:04] was his opinion they asked him later and
[1:43:07] he said brother Branham was that thus
[1:43:08] saith the Lord and he said of course not
[1:43:09] he said that just my own opinion about
[1:43:12] it he said I could be totally wrong
[1:43:14] he said I have nothing on the Lord from
[1:43:16] that he said but if I get something on
[1:43:18] the Lord front for him from it
[1:43:19] he said it'll speak it it'll say thus
[1:43:21] saith the Lord so we got to let brother
[1:43:24] Branham be a man okay and we may have
[1:43:28] little differences with things now 99%
[1:43:30] of what he said we all agree with but
[1:43:33] this is one where I you know I'm not
[1:43:35] that harsh with it now personally let me
[1:43:38] say this I believe it's best for white
[1:43:41] to marry white black to marry black
[1:43:43] Asian to marry Asian you name it
[1:43:46] east to marry east you know West to
[1:43:48] marry West you know you you name it I I
[1:43:50] believe that's the best thing to do but
[1:43:53] there are examples in the Bible where
[1:43:55] God put people to
[1:43:56] and they were not the same race and so
[1:44:00] I'm brother branham even admits this in
[1:44:02] numerous quote it's almost like he
[1:44:04] recognized it but maybe just never
[1:44:06] brought it down to a teaching but he
[1:44:08] never taught on it because it wasn't a
[1:44:10] doctrine you know it wasn't a major
[1:44:11] doctrine ok so let me read a few quotes
[1:44:14] here let me just give you a quick
[1:44:16] examples the most obvious example is
[1:44:22] with Moses and Zipporah Moses was a
[1:44:25] Hebrew man and if you look at the
[1:44:26] Hebrews today they're dark but they're
[1:44:28] not that dark if you look at a Theo pian
[1:44:31] they're pretty dark so God had Moses you
[1:44:36] know he of course Moses did it itself
[1:44:38] not God but Moses ran from Egypt because
[1:44:40] he murdered him a man and God had him
[1:44:43] marry Zipporah and Ethiopian a black
[1:44:48] woman right and and he's darker maybe
[1:44:50] he's brownish you know but he marries a
[1:44:53] black woman right and and brother
[1:44:57] Branham said well the Bible says this as
[1:45:00] well that Moses his siblings made fun of
[1:45:03] him because he married an Ethiopian
[1:45:04] that's in numbers the Book of Numbers I
[1:45:07] believe it's chapter 18 if I'm not
[1:45:08] mistaken Miriam makes fun of him and
[1:45:11] Aaron makes fun of him and God said
[1:45:14] aren't you afraid to speak against my
[1:45:16] servant so they weren't giving him
[1:45:19] respect for his wife in his marriage and
[1:45:20] God smote Miriam with leprosy and she
[1:45:24] got healed but died shortly after that
[1:45:26] for making fun of Moses's wife and
[1:45:31] brother Bram said that was sapore was
[1:45:34] mote was God's choice for Moses God
[1:45:37] chose the poor and Church of you know
[1:45:39] your Bible the poorest saved God's light
[1:45:41] I'm sorry the poor say Moses his life
[1:45:43] the angel was coming to kill Moses
[1:45:47] because he didn't circumcise his two
[1:45:48] sons and sapore circumcise him with a
[1:45:51] razor through the foreskins down and
[1:45:53] said you've been a bloody husband to me
[1:45:55] and brother Bram said the poorest saved
[1:45:57] Moses life because he got so busy with
[1:46:00] the ministry he forgot to circumcise his
[1:46:02] own sons so
[1:46:06] our absolute like program I said is the
[1:46:08] Bible and of course the Bible is brother
[1:46:10] Graham's absolute as well but he was a
[1:46:11] man he wasn't perfect he's not God we
[1:46:14] don't worship Him he was a prophet he
[1:46:17] foretold the future right we know what's
[1:46:19] gonna happen we know according to
[1:46:21] Scripture
[1:46:21] he taught the Bible he finished the
[1:46:23] mysteries of God amen glory and we know
[1:46:26] that because everything he taught was
[1:46:28] from the Bible with these mysteries and
[1:46:30] prophecies it's all from the Bible but
[1:46:32] in this case this is just one of his
[1:46:34] ideas and I can I can see the principle
[1:46:37] behind it okay because like in nature
[1:46:40] high breeding or intermingling it's not
[1:46:43] always a good thing
[1:46:45] they're getting so smart now or you know
[1:46:47] they can actually bypass with food and
[1:46:49] actually make it kind of good you know
[1:46:50] they they can do some things now they're
[1:46:52] getting pretty smart but at the
[1:46:54] beginning you couldn't do that because
[1:46:56] they weren't smart enough but the point
[1:46:58] is like reproduces with like and God
[1:47:01] loves variety God loves a man's dark
[1:47:04] skinned God loves a woman's pale skin
[1:47:07] God loves the tan skin God God loves the
[1:47:10] variety just like he loves a variety of
[1:47:11] flowers and nature and everything like
[1:47:13] that God loves a variety and I think
[1:47:16] it's best like the Bible you know like I
[1:47:18] believe that it's best to marry within
[1:47:22] your race if at all possible but there's
[1:47:24] going to be times when you can't or
[1:47:28] there's gonna be times where God is
[1:47:29] leading you outside of that okay so the
[1:47:33] example the best example is Moses and
[1:47:36] Zipporah the second one was Joseph and
[1:47:40] his Gentile wife probably Egyptian and
[1:47:45] they were the biggest heathens of all of
[1:47:47] them right God gave Joseph in Egypt a
[1:47:50] Gentile wife but vamsa noticed when
[1:47:53] Joseph rejected by his brother and he
[1:47:54] was given a gentle wife Pharaoh gave him
[1:47:57] a Gentile wife he bored Gentile children
[1:47:59] half Jew half Gentile so if you're
[1:48:03] getting technical he had hybrid children
[1:48:06] like if you're getting I don't think
[1:48:08] that's the right thing to say but just
[1:48:09] so we can understand it he had mixed
[1:48:11] children okay
[1:48:18] the beautiful example is Boaz and Ruth
[1:48:21] Ruth was a Moabite as' and most of the
[1:48:25] Moabite is's our mobitz were under the
[1:48:27] curse of God because they didn't help
[1:48:30] out Moses on his way back to eat Israel
[1:48:32] most them but God of all the people to
[1:48:36] get Boaz a wife who's eventually gonna
[1:48:38] have Obed Obed Jesse Jesse David David
[1:48:41] down to Christ of all people he chooses
[1:48:43] a Moabite woman Ruth and brings a
[1:48:49] Moabite totally Gentile totally heathen
[1:48:53] under the curses of God he brings her
[1:48:55] out from under curse and brings her into
[1:48:57] the fold and now her name and her sons
[1:49:01] names are in the very lineage of God's
[1:49:03] own son Jesus Christ so what am I saying
[1:49:07] I'm saying we should use the wisdom of
[1:49:10] God we must find the leadership of the
[1:49:13] Holy Ghost from who you're gonna marry
[1:49:14] right and God can save a mixed person
[1:49:17] right we know that remember Timothy he
[1:49:20] was a mixture and a Greek father and a
[1:49:21] Jewish mother and Paul thought so much
[1:49:24] of him he said that's my son in the
[1:49:25] gospel and I can trust the Corinth the
[1:49:28] Corinthians I can I can put the
[1:49:30] Corinthians in the hand of Timothy and
[1:49:32] Timothy will teach them everything I've
[1:49:34] I've taught because Timothy is born
[1:49:37] again and he's my son in the gospel to
[1:49:39] see it you know like me my mom was fully
[1:49:42] Indian Spanish you name it you know
[1:49:46] American I can show you the percentages
[1:49:48] if you want I just can't remember them
[1:49:49] right now
[1:49:49] you know Native American I'm off my dad
[1:49:52] is 30% great Great Britain you know so
[1:49:55] I'm kind of a Brit you know I guess that
[1:49:58] royal wedding you know I got a
[1:49:59] connection there I don't know it's so
[1:50:02] silly but I'm thirty percent in Great
[1:50:05] Britain in my blood you know
[1:50:07] so anyways I'm a mixed and you know so
[1:50:10] if I didn't understand this I well I got
[1:50:12] a got to marry a mixed you know but God
[1:50:14] sent me a great wife high school
[1:50:16] sweetheart you know like it's God place
[1:50:18] that God has to place it together so God
[1:50:20] will lead you on who to marry
[1:50:23] but you shouldn't like for example like
[1:50:26] people shouldn't get mad and say well I
[1:50:28] don't like what brother Branham said so
[1:50:29] I'm black I'm gonna go marry a white man
[1:50:31] or I'm white and I'm gonna go marry I'm
[1:50:33] black that's that's the wrong attitude
[1:50:35] you know if you just don't agree with
[1:50:37] someone just be kind about disagreeing
[1:50:39] with them right above all what a Peter
[1:50:42] say above all try to be smarter than
[1:50:44] everybody know above all have fervent
[1:50:48] charity one to another love jesus said
[1:50:53] you'll know they're my disciples by
[1:50:55] God's grace at Bride of Christ
[1:50:56] fellowship because they love you have
[1:50:58] one for another how we treat each other
[1:51:01] that's how he's supposed to know we're
[1:51:03] Christians
[1:51:03] visitors like our brother Jason he
[1:51:06] should watch and I hope by God's grace
[1:51:07] that he sees us love each other after
[1:51:09] service got any fights scheduled for
[1:51:11] after service I hope not I hope not we
[1:51:17] should have love we should care for each
[1:51:18] other you know when someone's hurting we
[1:51:20] should try to encourage them strengthen
[1:51:21] them support them pray for them we
[1:51:23] should do all we can we should be real
[1:51:24] Christians here because it's love and so
[1:51:32] that's where I stand on it I believe the
[1:51:36] main thing though when you get married
[1:51:37] is to marry someone who believes in
[1:51:39] Jesus Christ the same way you do that's
[1:51:43] the main thing
[1:51:46] brother I said under no circumstance
[1:51:49] should I believe or marry an unbeliever
[1:51:51] under no circumstances never because
[1:51:55] then you're then you're mixing your
[1:51:56] mixing faith versus unbelief you know we
[1:52:00] cannot do that the scripture says in
[1:52:01] secondly in 6 that we we should be
[1:52:04] unequally yoked or sure we should not be
[1:52:06] unequally yoked right we should be
[1:52:07] equally yoked together in other words
[1:52:09] you have a burden for the gospel I have
[1:52:11] a burden for the gospel let's let's plow
[1:52:14] these fields for the Lord let's work
[1:52:15] till Jesus comes you and I work together
[1:52:16] we'll be in perfect harmony amen
[1:52:19] that's what we should do by the grace of
[1:52:21] the Lord let me I'm just flipping
[1:52:28] through any of these last thoughts I
[1:52:29] wrote down here and
[1:52:34] you know I don't think we've ever had
[1:52:35] any any issues with this but it is a
[1:52:39] great question I know some people and
[1:52:40] when I got the question yesterday it was
[1:52:42] a video of a preacher and some people
[1:52:43] take a really hard stance on it some
[1:52:46] people don't take any stance at all but
[1:52:48] I just try to I just try to stay right
[1:52:49] in the middle I think if you follow
[1:52:53] God's will for your life and marry the
[1:52:55] person God wants you to marry no matter
[1:52:57] what skin color they are I think God
[1:52:58] will accept you because God is the one
[1:53:00] that led you to do that if you go
[1:53:02] against the Word of God and you don't
[1:53:04] obey the Holy Spirit and don't marry the
[1:53:06] right person I think there might be some
[1:53:07] consequences to that it all depends on
[1:53:10] if you follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:53:12] Spirit all right any other scriptures I
[1:53:27] think that's it let's stay on our feet
[1:53:29] by the gray yeah I think that's
[1:53:30] interesting really great question let's
[1:53:34] give those questions around pause I like
[1:53:35] those questions by the grace of Leigh I
[1:53:37] appreciate that I appreciate questions
[1:53:40] like I said if I can be a help to
[1:53:42] anybody we surely want to do that and I
[1:53:44] know I may be I forgot some things or if
[1:53:49] I miss anything you know let me know by
[1:53:51] the grace of Lord we're just trying to
[1:53:54] rightly divide the word of truth that's
[1:53:56] what a preacher is called to do you know
[1:53:57] rightly divide it and place it as a
[1:54:01] sacrifice unto the Lord that God would
[1:54:03] be pleased with our sacrifice and our
[1:54:04] offering amen
[1:54:07] that's just bow our heads here for a
[1:54:09] prayer by the grace of the Lord Heavenly
[1:54:14] Father we love you Lord God we thank you
[1:54:17] for your word Lord
[1:54:19] we know your word is our absolute dear
[1:54:22] God it's the last say it's our
[1:54:27] foundation our cornerstone the keystone
[1:54:31] of our lives father were grateful for
[1:54:35] the questions and the answers Lord and
[1:54:38] just trusting Lord that your spirit was
[1:54:40] guiding me to give the right answers to
[1:54:42] your God Lord one thing we want to have
[1:54:47] above all else is love for Lord what
[1:54:53] good would it do if we could speak in
[1:54:55] tongues men and angels have faith to
[1:54:58] move mountains give our bodies to be
[1:55:00] burned give all of our goods to the poor
[1:55:02] yet without love we'd be nothing help us
[1:55:08] to love to your God love like you loved
[1:55:12] give the people Grace in their heart
