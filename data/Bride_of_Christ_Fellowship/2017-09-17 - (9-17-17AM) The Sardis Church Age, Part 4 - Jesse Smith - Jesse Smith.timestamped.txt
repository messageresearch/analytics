[43:01] buddy you can switch over by God's grace
[43:15] we have a lot to be thankful for don't
[43:17] we praise God a lot to be thankful for
[43:20] God is so merciful let's look at this
[43:22] Sardis and church age part 4 and we'll
[43:26] take this thought like I said an hour
[43:27] here by God's grace we'll try to be
[43:29] mindful the time we read our text and
[43:32] we're looking at this yellow the yellow
[43:34] words here the Sardis church age we
[43:35] preached all the way up here this is
[43:37] part 4 and Martin Luther course was the
[43:40] the messenger and Wednesday we looked at
[43:43] how it was an age of justification the
[43:45] Prophet said it was God restoring
[43:47] justification sanctification to Wesley
[43:50] and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:51] in our day praise God and brother
[43:54] Branham said it started with the depths
[43:55] of God and then it went to the depths of
[43:58] Satan so much corruption but the church
[44:00] sprang back to life through Martin
[44:02] Luther with a blade he said a blade
[44:03] sprung forth out of the ground and was
[44:06] coming back to the depths of God so we
[44:08] should feel our lives going deeper with
[44:10] God do you feel that by God's grace if
[44:12] not that we've got need to catch up or
[44:14] or check up rather and get right with
[44:16] God because that's the word of the Lord
[44:18] we are gonna have the same ministry that
[44:20] they had in the beginning the depth of
[44:23] God which is love for God which is
[44:25] obedience praise God which is letter the
[44:27] Holy Spirit walking in the spirit not
[44:29] walking the flesh praise God and that's
[44:32] just to summarize it from Wednesday but
[44:34] also I've made this I don't know
[44:36] everybody's seen it but I kind of
[44:38] overlap the church ages with the
[44:40] anointings of the horse rider so of
[44:43] course we're living I'm sorry preaching
[44:45] right now in this age we're preaching on
[44:46] it but we're living over here under the
[44:48] pale horse rider but the area we're
[44:51] preaching on here is the age of Sardis
[44:54] where it was the man anointing versus of
[44:57] the black horse rider praise God and
[44:59] that was him capturing the wealth of the
[45:01] world and so he had control of Satan had
[45:04] controlled the governments and the
[45:05] churches and everything and there was
[45:07] just a real little small group and the
[45:09] sin they had to overcome was living a
[45:11] named Jesus but being dead and how many
[45:15] believe we got to still overcome that
[45:16] today praise God we got to overcome the
[45:19] deeds the Nicolaitans and doctrines and
[45:21] false all these things we've still got
[45:23] to overcome we don't want to come to a
[45:25] church and say we're message but not
[45:26] have the life of the
[45:27] message we want to have the life of
[45:29] Christ amen we don't want to try to be
[45:31] living a name but be dead spiritually we
[45:33] want to be on fire amen by God's grace
[45:35] with as we said the three-fold
[45:38] manifestation of being on fire a fervent
[45:41] desire to please him a passion and know
[45:43] his word and then a cry for reaching out
[45:46] in the Holy Spirit amen
[45:47] Oh Holy Spirit move this and move this
[45:49] day praise God so there's our church age
[45:53] fifteen twenty two seventy fifty Martin
[45:55] Luther is the messenger and of course
[45:59] there's not much light to that age
[46:01] everyone had that we had the Eclipse
[46:02] last month brother Branham said the
[46:04] Eclipse represented that the church was
[46:06] no longer the mouthpiece of God and I
[46:09] wonder you know we just wonder I were
[46:10] not prophets or anything but you know
[46:11] with this eclipse going over the u.s.
[46:13] you know I think it's another obvious
[46:14] sign that the u.s. is not speaking for
[46:16] God right this country is is Burness
[46:19] last bridge we know in 1956 we know they
[46:21] turned on the revival but I think it's
[46:23] God showing again how this nation is
[46:25] under darkness praise God but the bride
[46:28] will always walk in the light amen
[46:30] so we see where we're at we're now at
[46:33] this fifth church age here and there's a
[46:36] little more light because Wesley is the
[46:38] age of the open door the Prophet said it
[46:40] was the greatest missionary age ever was
[46:43] the Philadelphian church age and then we
[46:45] come back to our day the Laodicean
[46:48] Church age amen
[46:50] memorable Graham said if God would ask
[46:52] me what day would you have lived and he
[46:54] said I would have chose the last church
[46:55] age he said because it's right at the
[46:58] coming of the Lord amen
[47:00] Olivia it's at the end of the age it's
[47:03] the time when when time will blend in
[47:05] with eternity praise God and he said I
[47:08] would have chose the last age praise God
[47:10] and so you have ie men have got to given
[47:12] a choice we would have chosen living
[47:14] this day praise God because we are
[47:15] ordained to be here praise God
[47:17] remember Sardis is this fist city here
[47:20] if you go around that oval there kind of
[47:23] like a oval kinda like a triangle if you
[47:25] go around there where that's the fist
[47:26] city and now in this church age we
[47:28] preach on the aged messenger salutation
[47:31] denunciation and warning today we'll
[47:34] look at the judgment and eulogy well
[47:36] look at these today by the grace of the
[47:38] Lord
[47:41] the judgment Jesus says remember
[47:43] therefore how thou hast received and
[47:45] heard and hold fast and repent if
[47:49] therefore thou shalt not watch I will
[47:51] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[47:53] not know the hour I will come upon thee
[47:55] I think this is a very striking
[47:58] scripture here because Jesus telling the
[48:01] the people of Sardis remember how you
[48:04] receive the word how do they receive the
[48:07] word church they received it through
[48:09] Martin Luther they received it through
[48:11] other messengers and there's only one
[48:14] messenger rather but there's other
[48:15] earthly messengers or preachers they
[48:17] received it from men who were able to
[48:20] stand out against the denominational
[48:22] system of that day they received it as a
[48:24] fresh revelation my the just shall live
[48:27] by faith Jesus is saying remember how
[48:30] you receive the word and how you heard
[48:33] it and hold fast that word and he said
[48:36] repent now brother Branham said it's
[48:38] evident from this verse God has given
[48:40] them truth as a permanent deposit it was
[48:44] received and is irrevocably theirs it
[48:46] now remains to be seen what they will do
[48:49] with it whether they will regard it or
[48:52] not the same is true today are we going
[48:54] to regard the message what are we going
[48:56] to do with it how many have heard the
[48:57] message we've all heard it now what are
[48:59] we going to do with it praise God so see
[49:01] the Spirit would say the same thing
[49:03] today we've heard the word now how have
[49:05] you heard it what are you going to do
[49:06] with the word and we have to do
[49:08] something we all do something with the
[49:10] word whether we like it or not we all do
[49:12] something with it and we want to put it
[49:14] to use praise God and that is true they
[49:17] had been given the basic truth of the
[49:19] whole gospel the just shall live by
[49:21] faith
[49:22] amen that's the basic basic truth of
[49:24] salvation the just shall live by faith
[49:27] we're living by faith in Jesus Christ
[49:29] today salvation is of the Lord they had
[49:33] heard the truth of the Bible which cast
[49:34] down the doctrines of Rome and said it
[49:37] not all papal Authority they knew the
[49:40] truth that the church is not saved they
[49:43] understood the Lord's Supper
[49:45] they had light on water baptism they put
[49:47] out the images truth why there never was
[49:51] an age with any more men with so much
[49:54] light
[49:54] Amen phrase God what did they just was
[49:57] my all this light coming forward this
[49:59] blade of this is this blade of grass
[50:01] coming out of the ground or blade of the
[50:03] week coming out what a mighty age it was
[50:05] where light is springing forth out of
[50:07] almost pure darkness they had enough
[50:11] illumination to completely overhaul the
[50:13] old system or start out fresh and let
[50:16] God lead them line upon line and precept
[50:18] upon precept they receive the truth they
[50:21] wanted it and heard it but the question
[50:24] was how did they hear it did they hear
[50:27] to build upon or was it this with the
[50:31] same attitude that many Greeks had
[50:33] something to discuss and theorized over
[50:37] I hope that's not how we received it I'm
[50:39] going to go to acts 1712 because the
[50:42] Prophet reminds us of the Greeks of Acts
[50:44] chapter 17 and I think you know as time
[50:49] goes by you know we see many stand
[50:51] faithful to the message and then some
[50:53] fall away and we find many times that
[50:56] those who fall away just when they were
[50:58] attracted you know by by how the message
[51:00] was different like my wife and I talked
[51:02] many times and we've seen so many people
[51:03] come and go
[51:04] some people are attracted just because
[51:06] there's kind like a conspiracy theory
[51:07] some people love conspiracy theories and
[51:09] so we you know we reveal who the beast
[51:12] is and the the Antichrist is and some
[51:15] people get really excited about that
[51:17] right away and if they kind of because
[51:19] they kind of like conspiracy theories
[51:20] they do and then the Roman Catholic
[51:22] Church is this beautiful Church but like
[51:25] John wondered and he said all I admired
[51:27] what a beautiful church but then there's
[51:29] a conspiracy behind it it's Satan's
[51:31] church right and so people are attracted
[51:33] to that some are attracted because of
[51:35] the dress and they see holiness and
[51:37] other things like that other people are
[51:39] attracted because it's a smaller church
[51:40] you know the big churches have burned
[51:41] them and they want a more personal
[51:43] Church there's different things that
[51:45] attract people but when they fall away
[51:47] it's it's revealed that they only came
[51:51] to really discuss and theorize over the
[51:54] message they just came to hear something
[51:56] new they were tired of hearing you know
[51:57] things from their other denominations
[52:00] and some people come and they just want
[52:01] to just hear something new and when you
[52:03] stop preaching new things or not every
[52:05] sermons new people get discouraged but
[52:08] we must remember
[52:08] how many times Jesus said the word
[52:10] remember praise God we must remember
[52:13] things we've already heard are we living
[52:15] all that we've heard in most cases most
[52:18] people are not living all that they've
[52:20] heard can you say amen to that
[52:22] think about all that we've heard that
[52:25] brother Branham is preached all the
[52:29] tremendous words you know invincible
[52:31] army quotation from the church age book
[52:34] think of other things that we should be
[52:37] living great
[52:39] great compliments to the bride of Jesus
[52:43] Christ she'll be so much like him that
[52:45] she even takes his name amen Christians
[52:48] should be so much like Jesus that they
[52:50] take his name and people notice mine
[52:52] they act just like Christ amen now how
[52:54] many people are living that praise God
[52:56] there's such things that have been so
[52:58] highly attained brother Branham says if
[53:01] you hate your brother he said you're
[53:02] still not sealed yet and yet how many
[53:05] message searches hold people that might
[53:07] hate others from other churches you know
[53:08] we've heard such things at such a high
[53:10] life as far as high in heavenly places
[53:13] and we're able to get there if we obey
[53:16] the Word of God and if we live according
[53:18] to the word but we see a lot of people
[53:20] just want to hear something new all the
[53:22] time or they just want to theorize or
[53:24] they just want to intellectual
[53:25] stimulation rather than a soul
[53:27] simulation amen rather than a soul berth
[53:30] hallelujah
[53:31] so acts 17 12 he says therefore many of
[53:37] them believed also I'm sorry also of
[53:42] honorable women which were Greeks and a
[53:44] men not a few I'm sorry I think I read
[53:49] the wrong verse here on my neck 17 verse
[53:51] 12 oh yeah I'm sorry verse 21 I got my
[53:57] one and two mixed up sorry about that
[53:59] verse 21 for all the Athenians and
[54:02] strangers which were there spent their
[54:04] time and nothing else but either to tell
[54:06] or hear something new so Paul shows
[54:09] shows that give me an evil spirit when
[54:11] people just want to hear something new
[54:12] all the time just give me something new
[54:15] give me something new don't take me back
[54:16] to the old but Jesus said a master
[54:18] builder brings forth both new and old
[54:20] praise God sometimes me
[54:22] back and remember the words on
[54:24] justification on sanctification on the
[54:27] gifts of the Spirit on the supernatural
[54:28] sometimes need to go back there and
[54:30] visit there because we forget we're
[54:32] human we're if we forget and Jesus
[54:34] constantly says remember and repent
[54:36] remember and repent praise God so the
[54:39] Prophet tells us it's good to hear it
[54:43] but you got to make sure you hear it the
[54:44] right way praise God
[54:46] evidently the rich word of truth was
[54:49] being heard in an academic manner rather
[54:53] than for practical out working for God
[54:55] was demanding a change of mind
[54:57] concerning it so that's one way that
[55:01] you'll know if our ministry or any
[55:03] ministry is academic or intellectual
[55:05] they only require you to memorize it
[55:08] they don't require you to live it hey
[55:11] man
[55:11] because Jesus is demanding the Prophet
[55:14] said God's demanding a change so God is
[55:17] there demanding you must change you must
[55:19] repent and people get upset with the
[55:22] preacher says you must obey you must
[55:24] submit that get upset but the Prophet
[55:26] said that's what God demands he demands
[55:28] repentance praise God see that's how we
[55:32] know if we're intellectual or just want
[55:34] to hear something new all the time or
[55:36] it's actually spiritual because when
[55:37] it's spiritual God will demand you
[55:39] change your life and if you change then
[55:42] your spiritual if you don't then you're
[55:44] just an election will praise God that's
[55:46] what our prophet taught oh how many
[55:49] would say change my heart O God make it
[55:51] ever true amen
[55:52] help me to obey what the preacher saying
[55:54] amen no matter where I go help me to
[55:57] obey what the Word of God says if not
[55:58] it's just academic it's just
[56:01] intellectual which is a tragedy or
[56:03] tracks a lot of people a lot of people
[56:06] if this is the Word of God which idiot
[56:09] is that it must be obeyed failure to
[56:13] obey would bring judgment when the
[56:14] guards of the sacred temple were found
[56:16] sleeping they were beaten and their
[56:18] garments burned so they're on Nightwatch
[56:20] kind of reminds us of the message
[56:21] watchman one of the night I preached a
[56:23] few months ago right probably the
[56:24] Prophet liked it under preachers and
[56:26] prophets what shall the Lord do to those
[56:29] who in this age have relaxed their guard
[56:32] they're not staying awake you know
[56:34] spiritually and God
[56:36] their lives like they ought to be let's
[56:40] look at a few parables you have your
[56:41] Bible I don't have all these scriptures
[56:43] up here so let's turn your Bible to mark
[56:44] 13 34 if you got your Bible here let's
[56:47] say as soon as I read that I felt the
[56:49] Holy Spirit now that's just my thought I
[56:51] felt the Holy Spirit go to this parable
[56:53] and there's three there's two versions
[56:55] of it mark 13 34 and Luke 12 let's go to
[56:58] mark 13 34 mark 13 34 so God demands
[57:12] that we repent God demands that we
[57:14] change our minds God doesn't give us a
[57:16] word to hear it God wants us to live it
[57:18] amen and manifest it mark 13 34 he says
[57:22] this for the son of man is as a man
[57:24] taking a far journey who left his house
[57:27] and what he give to his servants
[57:29] Authority and he said to every man his
[57:35] work so God's servants have authority
[57:38] every man has a work for God and
[57:43] commanded the porter the gate keeper to
[57:46] watch now look at verse 35 he said watch
[57:50] ye therefore he speaking to his
[57:52] disciples disciples you need to watch
[57:54] for ye know not when the master of the
[57:56] house cometh or even or at midnight or
[57:59] at the cock-crowing or in the morning
[58:01] les coming suddenly he find you sleeping
[58:03] and I say unto you I'm sorry and what I
[58:07] say unto you I say unto all watch
[58:10] huh me know you're commanded to watch
[58:12] for the coming of the Lord and that
[58:14] doesn't mean guess when it's gonna be
[58:15] like next month or I believe in two
[58:17] years the raptures gonna take place I
[58:18] believe within ten years that that's not
[58:20] what he's talking about he's having your
[58:22] life ready where you would be happy to
[58:24] see him return amen
[58:26] your life is in such a state your life
[58:28] is like his life it's fully sold out you
[58:31] have a cross you actually have a burden
[58:32] for the gospel and you're bearing your
[58:34] cross you're working for Jesus and you
[58:36] can't wait till he gets here amen so you
[58:38] can show him how you've invested by His
[58:40] grace into his work for your life amen
[58:43] that's right remember when the servants
[58:47] came they came forth and showed oh look
[58:50] I've done I've doubled your talents Lord
[58:52] I've doubled your talents you gave me
[58:54] five here's ten you gave me - I'm giving
[58:56] you four they were ready to show him and
[58:59] the Bible said that God's reward is with
[59:01] Jesus when he returns
[59:02] he's got your reward rainy waiting there
[59:04] right with him amen oh yeah now notice
[59:09] the servants have authority every man
[59:11] has a work the porter must watch
[59:13] we all must watch now the the theologian
[59:17] Clark said a porter asleep exposes the
[59:21] house to be robbed and well deserves
[59:23] punishment no wonder that the man is
[59:25] constantly suffering loss who is
[59:28] frequently off his guard this is how you
[59:30] know you're not watching you're
[59:31] suffering loss of spiritual goods
[59:34] I didn't say natural goods I said
[59:37] spiritual goods amen
[59:39] you're suffering loss the blessings of
[59:42] God faith virtue knowledge patience
[59:44] temperance godless brotherly kindness if
[59:46] you're a born-again Christian you might
[59:48] be suffering the loss of the fruits of
[59:49] the spirit right or the armor of God you
[59:52] don't feel like you can hold that that
[59:54] sort of the spirit anymore your your
[59:57] Shield of faith is getting heavy you
[59:58] can't handle the attacks upon you that's
[1:00:00] how you know you've let your guard down
[1:00:02] is if you're constantly suffering
[1:00:04] spiritual loss instead of suffering
[1:00:06] instead of enjoying spiritual gains your
[1:00:08] suffering loss how many one a gain in
[1:00:10] Christ amen examine your hearts this
[1:00:13] morning see am i gaining spiritually or
[1:00:15] am I losing spiritually now you know if
[1:00:18] you're sleeping or not now you know
[1:00:20] Jesus is parable am i dozing off to
[1:00:22] sleep trying to stay awake and I'm not
[1:00:24] talking about naturally in the service
[1:00:25] today which I don't see anybody dozing
[1:00:27] off this morning but I'm talking about
[1:00:30] spiritually sleeping spiritual err as to
[1:00:33] what's going on in God's economy amen
[1:00:36] and then he says to find you sleeping
[1:00:40] sleeping is inattentive to your posts
[1:00:43] neglecting your duty and unprepared for
[1:00:46] God's coming and the Bible lists there's
[1:00:50] four watches there's an evening watch a
[1:00:52] midnight watch a cock-crowing watch and
[1:00:54] a morning watch and Jesus said be ready
[1:00:58] at all for watches amen
[1:01:00] that reminds me of the four annoying
[1:01:02] things they're on the of the beasts man
[1:01:04] we must have the morning watch or
[1:01:06] something amen but you understand we
[1:01:08] must be ready for his coming praise God
[1:01:10] now go to Luke chapter 12 it's gonna
[1:01:12] loot 12 and it was verse 35 12 35 before
[1:01:19] this a little bit more lengthy reading
[1:01:20] there's a little more details in this
[1:01:22] parable praise God Luke 12 35 Luke 12 35
[1:01:40] this is why I love the church ages it's
[1:01:42] so applicable to every age every age
[1:01:46] goes through these things and each age
[1:01:49] of course you know God emphasized a
[1:01:51] little more heavily for each age but we
[1:01:52] can all relate to this we can all relate
[1:01:54] to being uh wanting to watch and pray
[1:01:57] right we can all relate to that so this
[1:01:59] is so applicable to all of us Luke 12 35
[1:02:04] let your loins be girded about and your
[1:02:07] lamps burning how many know what loins
[1:02:09] are it's a ready mind have your mind
[1:02:12] ready thinking about the things of God
[1:02:14] and we know what the lamps represent the
[1:02:17] burning of the Holy Ghost the anointing
[1:02:18] of the Holy Ghost right with the the ten
[1:02:21] virgins right five wise five foolish
[1:02:23] that your lights be burning don't let
[1:02:24] your lights go out
[1:02:25] shine the light for Christ verse 36 and
[1:02:29] ye yourselves like unto men that wait
[1:02:31] for their Lord when he returned from the
[1:02:33] wedding that when he cometh and knocketh
[1:02:35] they may open unto him immediately
[1:02:38] blessed are those servants whom the Lord
[1:02:41] when he cometh shall find watching
[1:02:43] verily I say to you that he shall gird
[1:02:46] himself and make them to sit down to
[1:02:47] meet and will come forth and serve them
[1:02:50] and if he should come in the second
[1:02:52] watch or in the third watch and find
[1:02:53] them so blessed are those servants and
[1:02:56] this know that if the good man of the
[1:02:59] house had known what hour the thief
[1:03:01] would have come he would have watched
[1:03:02] and not suffered his house to be broken
[1:03:04] through be he therefore ready also for
[1:03:08] the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye
[1:03:10] think not then Peter said unto Him Lord
[1:03:14] speakest thou this parable unto us or
[1:03:17] even to
[1:03:18] and the Lord said who then is that
[1:03:21] faithful wise steward whom his Lord
[1:03:23] shall make ruler over his house to give
[1:03:25] them their portion of meat in due season
[1:03:28] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[1:03:30] when he cometh shall find him so doing
[1:03:34] so God wants servants to give the people
[1:03:37] their food for that particular season
[1:03:39] amen and then Jesus wants to find us
[1:03:42] feeding his people verse 44 of a truth I
[1:03:46] say to you that he will make him ruler
[1:03:47] over all that he hath but and if that
[1:03:52] servant saying is hard my lord delayeth
[1:03:53] his coming and shall begin to beat the
[1:03:55] menservants and maidservants and to eat
[1:03:57] and drink and to be drunken the Lord of
[1:04:00] that servant will come in a day when he
[1:04:02] looketh not for him and at an hour when
[1:04:04] he's not aware and will cut him in
[1:04:06] asunder and will appoint him his portion
[1:04:08] with the unbelievers and that servant
[1:04:12] which knew not his Lord's will prepared
[1:04:14] not himself
[1:04:14] neither did according to his Will shall
[1:04:16] be beaten with many stripes but he that
[1:04:18] knew not and did commit things worthy of
[1:04:21] stripes shall be beaten with few stripes
[1:04:23] foreign to whom sever much is given of
[1:04:25] him shall much be required and to whom
[1:04:28] men have committed much of him they will
[1:04:31] ask them more what a beautiful parable
[1:04:33] you like that by God's grace Church
[1:04:35] those are red-letter words how many I
[1:04:36] can see that my Jesus is asking all of
[1:04:39] us to watch he's asking all of us to be
[1:04:42] faithful he's asking us to know the will
[1:04:45] of God and then do something with it
[1:04:48] obey the will of God amen now here's
[1:04:53] some notes I was finding here so loosen
[1:04:55] means - I'm sorry - grow up the loins
[1:04:57] means a fast enough the long outer
[1:04:58] garment always done before travel and
[1:05:00] work the meaning is to be in readiness
[1:05:02] of mind Peter said that grew up the
[1:05:04] loins of your mind and notice they're
[1:05:08] returning he's returning from the
[1:05:10] wedding the Union adjusts the curd
[1:05:11] praise God that's not the parable the
[1:05:13] servants must be ready because he's
[1:05:15] returning from the wedding so in all
[1:05:17] these parables the stories deal with
[1:05:19] weddings praise God and wedding
[1:05:23] processions and so we can see how the
[1:05:25] Union is actually happening and when
[1:05:27] Jesus comes back here the unions happen
[1:05:29] he wants to find his people
[1:05:31] feeding on the meat for their season
[1:05:34] praise God aren't you glad you have the
[1:05:36] meat for your season praise the Lord
[1:05:38] you don't have a father son Holy Ghost
[1:05:39] baptism or sprinkle praise God
[1:05:41] you don't have just a justification
[1:05:43] message although that's wonderful or
[1:05:45] just of a sanctification message but we
[1:05:47] have the depth of God the baptism of the
[1:05:50] Holy Ghost where Christ lives in the
[1:05:52] believer praise God and he reproduces
[1:05:55] his life through our lives and he
[1:05:57] identifies himself in us praise God
[1:06:00] hallelujah to live the four Word of God
[1:06:04] amen so we see many requirements Jesus
[1:06:09] is required you have to stay awake you
[1:06:12] have to stay awake if you're sleeping he
[1:06:14] casts you out with the unbelievers into
[1:06:16] the Tribulation Period if people are
[1:06:19] sleeping and not awake to the things of
[1:06:21] God and not watching for Christ to come
[1:06:23] Oh hallelujah
[1:06:25] we must not think the Lord is delaying
[1:06:27] is coming right like the Bible said then
[1:06:29] we'll get beginning to mistreat one
[1:06:31] another when we think the Lord is coming
[1:06:33] but when we think God is going to be
[1:06:35] here soon we really watch how we treat
[1:06:37] others praise God because we know these
[1:06:39] are God's servants these are God's
[1:06:41] people this is God's food this is God's
[1:06:43] flock hallelujah this is God's heritage
[1:06:45] amen it's exactly right and God will
[1:06:50] bless that servant to whom much is given
[1:06:52] much is required praise God we know the
[1:06:55] great message has been given to us so
[1:06:57] God is requiring us to do something with
[1:06:59] it
[1:07:00] hallelujah now I want to bring that out
[1:07:02] this quote as I was studying this
[1:07:04] morning and praying and this quote came
[1:07:06] to my mind and and we all want to be
[1:07:07] watchful right we all want to stay on
[1:07:09] track don't we dear brother ma'am gives
[1:07:12] us some advice about you know over fifty
[1:07:14] years ago he gave us some advice and I
[1:07:16] want to read it to you this isn't
[1:07:17] questions answers on the seals before
[1:07:20] the the morning before he preaches the
[1:07:21] Seventh Seal and I mentioned this quote
[1:07:23] numerous times but I like to read it to
[1:07:25] you today by God's grace I think you'll
[1:07:27] be blessed amen but man said now take my
[1:07:30] advice as your brother
[1:07:32] don't put your own interpretation to
[1:07:35] anything you just go on and live a good
[1:07:39] Christian life cuz you only wind
[1:07:42] yourself away from the real thing
[1:07:45] when you do it see you only wind your
[1:07:49] way again away from the thing and all of
[1:07:52] you are conscious and know that there's
[1:07:54] something mysterious happening and it's
[1:07:55] happening and I know it is he's talking
[1:07:57] about the seven seals being revealed and
[1:07:58] later he tells us it's the third Pole
[1:08:00] it's the opening of the word the
[1:08:02] mysteries of the book are being revealed
[1:08:04] praise God then see there's nothing at
[1:08:07] all that you can do towards salvation or
[1:08:10] divine healing it's the individuals
[1:08:12] faith in Christ so brother Graham is
[1:08:14] making a point I can't make anybody
[1:08:15] believe for divine healing I can't save
[1:08:17] anybody it's your own individual faith
[1:08:20] to receive salvation praise God oh there
[1:08:23] we go now I want to read that one too it
[1:08:30] says and I put this in here you know for
[1:08:33] our sake with preachers because right
[1:08:35] now one of the great attacks on the
[1:08:37] bride is oh no more preachers just play
[1:08:38] tapes which tapes have a place we
[1:08:41] appreciate tapes but the Prophet never
[1:08:42] ordained it plus the play tapes he never
[1:08:44] said that he never said changed things
[1:08:47] that have all tape playing he never said
[1:08:49] that he said keep doing the same thing
[1:08:51] he said we need more preachers they said
[1:08:53] brother Graham should you be the only
[1:08:54] one preach and he said of course not we
[1:08:56] said we need more preachers amen but you
[1:08:59] know those quotes if you've been here
[1:09:00] now to bring up faith in Christ there's
[1:09:03] ministers that's the most important
[1:09:05] thing of the day is a good god sent
[1:09:07] preacher and I'm not exalting myself or
[1:09:10] the fivefold ministry I'm just repeating
[1:09:12] what God's Word already says praise God
[1:09:15] I've ever said you know we can't make
[1:09:17] people believe but to bring up faith God
[1:09:19] gives us preachers right he said I
[1:09:22] admire them and their gift is far beyond
[1:09:24] anything could be done in anything else
[1:09:26] as a preacher a man who knows how to
[1:09:28] rightly divide the word of God it's the
[1:09:31] most wonderful gift in the world is to
[1:09:33] be a minister the Prophet says I want to
[1:09:36] make sure I read that now and then don't
[1:09:38] forget this quote the Prophet said he
[1:09:39] quotes Paul where he said study it
[1:09:41] rightly dividing the word of truth
[1:09:42] there's three months and the scriptures
[1:09:44] and using God's words there's three
[1:09:46] things you must not do now let's study
[1:09:48] these for a few 10 minutes three things
[1:09:50] you must not do and all out in the land
[1:09:53] wherever you are across the nation be
[1:09:55] sure to put these down in your mind if
[1:09:56] you haven't got a pencil you must
[1:09:59] do these things we tell you all the time
[1:10:01] how you must do now I'm gonna tell you
[1:10:03] what you must not do now you must not
[1:10:07] misinterpret the word you say well I
[1:10:11] believe it means this it means just what
[1:10:13] it says it needs the no interpreter and
[1:10:16] you must not misplace the word and you
[1:10:19] must not dislocate the word and if we
[1:10:22] would do either of those it throws the
[1:10:24] whole Bible and a confusion and in a
[1:10:25] chaos if our church finds ourselves in
[1:10:30] chaos or confusion it's possible myself
[1:10:32] or some other preacher misinterpreted
[1:10:35] the Word of God that's a great
[1:10:36] possibility isn't it that's what the
[1:10:39] prophet prophet teaches and then he
[1:10:40] gives examples now here you can
[1:10:41] understand about this brother Graham
[1:10:45] said to misinterpret an example of this
[1:10:47] the Bible the Word says what it means
[1:10:49] what it says God's one person not three
[1:10:51] persons he said that's misinterpreting
[1:10:54] oh I can see three persons and Father
[1:10:56] Son Holy Ghost
[1:10:57] well the Bible didn't say that that's
[1:10:58] misinterpreting the word so anytime that
[1:11:01] would be done that's misinterpreting
[1:11:03] scripture saying something the Bible
[1:11:05] doesn't say misplacing remember I
[1:11:07] preached all these series in 2016 I got
[1:11:10] it I got it saved on my computer and
[1:11:12] it's back there if you want to listen to
[1:11:13] it but I preached all the way through
[1:11:14] I'm just reviewing these for you
[1:11:16] misplace making God in one age and not
[1:11:20] the same God today that's the problem
[1:11:21] you misplaced him to a different age or
[1:11:23] generation because Hebrews 13:8 says
[1:11:25] he's the same every day and then the
[1:11:28] Prophet said if you dislocate the word
[1:11:30] he sits like putting you know elbow to
[1:11:32] the knee or something like that he gives
[1:11:34] that example in the sermon he said
[1:11:36] that's like preaching Moses's message in
[1:11:38] jesus's day or noah's message in Moses
[1:11:41] day so we don't want to do those things
[1:11:45] right this is how we're going to stay on
[1:11:47] track this is how we're gonna watch and
[1:11:50] pray this is how we're going to do the
[1:11:51] work God called us to do to stay with
[1:11:54] God's Word don't misinterpret it don't
[1:11:57] misplace it and don't dislocate God's
[1:12:00] word now I'm getting back to the quote
[1:12:03] where the prophets talking I told you
[1:12:05] before don't just try to put any
[1:12:07] interpretation just believe me as your
[1:12:09] brother we're living in a great hour
[1:12:11] we're living at a time where
[1:12:13] you just be real humble be a Christian
[1:12:17] and try to live for God and live honest
[1:12:20] with your fellow man and love those who
[1:12:23] don't love you this is brother branham's
[1:12:26] advice while preaching the seven seals
[1:12:29] don't add your interpretation of the
[1:12:31] seals don't add anything the Word of God
[1:12:33] just be real humble praise God and love
[1:12:36] everybody love even your enemies praise
[1:12:38] the Lord you see you only make it a
[1:12:43] mysterious something and mess the real
[1:12:45] program of God up you see we have the
[1:12:48] mysteries don't we church where the
[1:12:49] mysteries revealed but we can't make it
[1:12:51] seem so mysterious like we're a cult or
[1:12:54] something like that you can't do that
[1:12:56] Loran said don't do it like that just
[1:12:58] tell Pete he's gonna say it next he said
[1:13:00] just tell people how much you love Jesus
[1:13:02] all the time
[1:13:03] don't act mysterious and try to make
[1:13:05] yourself more spiritual and try to make
[1:13:07] predictions like other people you know
[1:13:09] try to that just be real humble just
[1:13:11] love God love people and you'll be right
[1:13:13] with God amen he said but if the church
[1:13:17] you're not supposed to know these things
[1:13:19] so don't put your interpretation
[1:13:21] anything you just go ahead and just
[1:13:23] remember what you're told live a
[1:13:24] Christian life go to your church be a
[1:13:26] real light wherever you are and just
[1:13:28] burn for Christ and tell the people that
[1:13:31] how you love him and just let your test
[1:13:35] I want to be with love all the time with
[1:13:40] the people because if you don't you
[1:13:42] twist yourself out into something there
[1:13:44] and then you're off the beaten track how
[1:13:47] many one stay on the track I don't want
[1:13:49] to get off the track I don't my train I
[1:13:51] don't want my family going off God's
[1:13:52] track I want to stay right on the track
[1:13:54] I don't want to add anything to it I
[1:13:56] want my fire to keep burning this is how
[1:13:58] you do it stay in the love of God so
[1:14:02] every time you do it you've done that he
[1:14:04] talks about people and making false
[1:14:05] doctrines so just don't try to make no
[1:14:07] interpretation especially tonight when
[1:14:09] that seal a seventh seal comes up in
[1:14:11] front of you just don't try interpret it
[1:14:13] you just go ahead and just be humble and
[1:14:15] go right on with the same plain message
[1:14:20] glory now you say brother Animas are we
[1:14:23] being the Church of them in God
[1:14:24] shouldn't we he said well I want to say
[1:14:27] they said why can't I I want to have
[1:14:28] this he said no remember I'm saying this
[1:14:31] for your good see I'm saying it so that
[1:14:33] you understand if you believe me now
[1:14:34] listen to what I tell you so see people
[1:14:36] want to jump and try to get revelations
[1:14:38] and new understandings and don't get me
[1:14:40] wrong there is place for that but when
[1:14:42] we misinterpret the Word of God we start
[1:14:44] getting in trouble that's one of the
[1:14:46] attributes of having a false doctrine
[1:14:48] you start acting in a way that's
[1:14:50] unloving to God right like you said you
[1:14:53] start acting unloving you start hating
[1:14:55] people you start attacking people
[1:14:56] because wherever there's disobedience to
[1:15:00] God's Word there's always fruits to that
[1:15:02] there's always crunk fruits right any
[1:15:05] church that has a false doctrine will
[1:15:08] end up having some type of sin take over
[1:15:10] those who believe it it has to because
[1:15:13] that sin is like a seed and it will be
[1:15:15] the Bible said it produces death in the
[1:15:17] end I remember that every false doctrine
[1:15:20] produces death we know that that's why
[1:15:23] it's got to be repented of he said don't
[1:15:27] try to make yourself odd to be a
[1:15:28] Christian because you take because you
[1:15:31] take yourself away from God if you can
[1:15:36] understand it this is that third poll
[1:15:37] says you should have caught that the
[1:15:38] other day so we talked about the opening
[1:15:40] of the seals being the third Pole God
[1:15:41] revealing his word right
[1:15:43] God opening the word praise the Lord
[1:15:45] does that help by God's grace just be a
[1:15:47] humble God loving God fearing enemy
[1:15:50] loving Christian praise God we're not to
[1:15:53] make ourselves try to look you know to
[1:15:55] be de for now we have to look different
[1:15:56] because of our standards but we don't
[1:15:58] make it look like a clan or a clique or
[1:16:00] a cold or something like that we should
[1:16:03] tell people how much we love Jesus all
[1:16:04] the time amen it's back to loving God
[1:16:08] with all of our hearts now go to second
[1:16:13] Timothy 2 real quick I just want to show
[1:16:14] this here right after Paul tells Timothy
[1:16:18] to rightly divide the word in 2nd
[1:16:20] Timothy 2:15 verse 16 and 17 or 16 he
[1:16:24] said but shun profane and vain babblings
[1:16:25] for they will increase unto more
[1:16:27] godliness so did you see that everybody
[1:16:29] catch up if someone is babbling off some
[1:16:33] vain ideas
[1:16:34] if someone's babbling or spewing out
[1:16:37] some false new doctrine it's actually
[1:16:38] false
[1:16:40] the Bible said they will increase the
[1:16:42] what more ungodliness right every tree
[1:16:46] is known by its fruit when someone
[1:16:49] preaches false doctrine or teaches this
[1:16:51] false idea watch their life they're not
[1:16:54] going to increase in holiness they're
[1:16:56] gonna increase in ungodliness that's why
[1:16:59] you should watch my life as your pastor
[1:17:01] or whatever a ministry comes in here
[1:17:03] watch our lives our lives need to line
[1:17:05] up with God's Word hey man it's exactly
[1:17:09] right if not if they don't line up
[1:17:13] something is gonna happen you're gonna
[1:17:15] see more ungodliness what if they're
[1:17:18] right you're gonna see more godliness
[1:17:20] that makes me happy glory go to verse 17
[1:17:23] and their word will eat as death a
[1:17:25] canker of whom is high mania sand fleas
[1:17:28] look at him called the names of the
[1:17:30] preachers preach and false doctrine he
[1:17:31] calls them out by name
[1:17:34] verse 18 who have who concerning the
[1:17:37] truth have erred saying that the
[1:17:39] resurrection has passed already and
[1:17:40] overthrow the faith of some so see here
[1:17:45] Paul give us an example this is a case
[1:17:47] of someone not rightly dividing the word
[1:17:49] they say oh the rapture is over the
[1:17:51] resurrection is over and Paul says that
[1:17:54] overthrows people's faith and cause them
[1:17:57] to live a more ungodly life but when you
[1:18:00] preach true doctrine and the people are
[1:18:02] really hungry receiving it their lives
[1:18:04] will be more godly all the time amen
[1:18:06] that's the perfect example right there
[1:18:08] because nevertheless verse 19 the
[1:18:11] foundation of God stands for having this
[1:18:13] seal the Lord knows them that are his
[1:18:16] and let every one that name it the name
[1:18:18] of Christ depart from iniquity hey man
[1:18:22] that's how you know your life should be
[1:18:24] more going more towards godliness and
[1:18:26] not towards iniquity compromise here
[1:18:29] well pretty soon you compromise there
[1:18:31] pretty soon you compromise here pretty
[1:18:32] soon let this sit and that sit in that
[1:18:34] center we can't compromise on anything
[1:18:36] we must obey all the Word of God that's
[1:18:40] a perfectly Bible example now what about
[1:18:42] Pete I believe there's danger in saying
[1:18:43] brother Rams coming back to do a plane
[1:18:45] or do a horse like Jose and I talk about
[1:18:47] all the time because Jose came out of
[1:18:49] that stuff I don't know if you knew that
[1:18:50] Jose came out of those false doctrines
[1:18:52] they were saying they were
[1:18:53] Taizo man brother branham's name down
[1:18:55] there and uh nicaragua and he said they
[1:18:59] still do he's trying to get his brothers
[1:19:00] out of those churches that's where he
[1:19:02] came from and he told me though a few
[1:19:04] weeks ago he said jesse when i came to
[1:19:05] your church he said you were preaching
[1:19:07] on how the return ministry there's no
[1:19:08] return ministry he said and it set me
[1:19:10] free from that so see Church there's
[1:19:12] reason sometimes preachers will preach
[1:19:14] on things and I didn't even know it I
[1:19:16] didn't even know the brother study would
[1:19:17] struggle with that but for some reason I
[1:19:19] felt led to preach against the return
[1:19:20] ministry that day and that brother
[1:19:22] needed to hear it God knows what he's
[1:19:24] doing what is it it's God giving the
[1:19:25] people the meat in due season amen
[1:19:28] and you and he's told me all the
[1:19:31] adultery and fornication that took place
[1:19:33] in all those churches and had these
[1:19:35] false doctrine he said those preachers
[1:19:38] with the false doctrine will sneak
[1:19:39] around he said a couple he knew in
[1:19:41] particular from those churches that
[1:19:42] baptize in brother man's name they'll go
[1:19:44] though from church to church they'll
[1:19:46] move in there like a man he said of a
[1:19:48] false preacher will moved to a church
[1:19:49] he'll act like he's sitting though he's
[1:19:51] already married he acts like he's
[1:19:52] singled out the church far away and get
[1:19:53] another wife and then move on leave that
[1:19:55] woman there and move on he said he knows
[1:19:57] many people that do that
[1:19:58] you see wherever there's false doctrine
[1:20:00] it's gonna produce ungodliness every
[1:20:04] corrupt tree every tree that's corrupt
[1:20:06] is gonna have corrupt fruit you can you
[1:20:08] see that by God's grace what aren't you
[1:20:10] glad when you find a tree with good
[1:20:11] fruit praise God amen
[1:20:13] aren't you glad when you find clean
[1:20:15] waters hallelujah you can take a drink
[1:20:17] of God's pure Word of God oh I'm so
[1:20:19] happy to have it today he said never
[1:20:21] make yourself odd to be a Christian he
[1:20:24] said just stay with the same simple
[1:20:26] message of God amen I hope you like that
[1:20:29] by God's grace out of that amen glory
[1:20:32] let's get back to the judgment section
[1:20:35] here by God's grace how am i doing on
[1:20:36] time okay twenty minutes that's pretty
[1:20:37] good now Jesus says if you're not
[1:20:41] careful I'll come on you as a thief
[1:20:44] ancient Sardis was constantly harassed
[1:20:47] by bandits that swooped down from the
[1:20:49] hills and pillaged the people thus they
[1:20:52] knew only too well what the Spirit was
[1:20:54] saying and that the coming of the Lord
[1:20:55] is as a thief listen this vigilance and
[1:21:00] preparation alone will suffice to be
[1:21:03] ready for us coming
[1:21:07] now we know that this is the message for
[1:21:09] the false vine for the coming Lord will
[1:21:11] be as it was in the days of Noah the
[1:21:13] eight saved were well aware of the
[1:21:15] impending flood and being aware we're
[1:21:18] prepared and saved let me just take a
[1:21:20] moment on this vigilance of preparation
[1:21:21] yesterday my family we went to a
[1:21:23] family's wedding and we walk in the
[1:21:26] reception we can tell right now it's
[1:21:28] gonna be a rock-and-roll reception and
[1:21:29] so we look across the table with the
[1:21:31] children and I said children if anybody
[1:21:33] asked you to dance you tell them no
[1:21:36] thank you
[1:21:36] cuz I told them we don't dance for the
[1:21:39] devil we only dance for Christ that's
[1:21:43] right
[1:21:44] preparing them I see the atmosphere that
[1:21:46] you know not all people like to dance
[1:21:48] but as soon as you walk in that
[1:21:50] atmosphere I got to prepare the children
[1:21:52] and I was on guard like a watchdog I
[1:21:55] felt like I was like like I was watching
[1:21:58] my turn to make sure they don't start
[1:21:59] dancing you know because it's really
[1:22:00] easy to get in the flesh not because I
[1:22:03] want to punish them but because I want
[1:22:04] to protect them
[1:22:05] well the RAM said if a person does get
[1:22:08] the Holy Ghost what's gonna get him he
[1:22:09] said rock and roll in church God knows
[1:22:13] my heart I'm sharing a personal
[1:22:14] testimony a wonderful brother who who
[1:22:17] was in the message just came the message
[1:22:18] you know a few years ago he was so on
[1:22:20] fire he just called him a few weeks ago
[1:22:22] I felt little Lord to call and talk to
[1:22:23] him and he said I got some bitterness a
[1:22:25] complex in my church against different
[1:22:27] people and he said the first thing I
[1:22:29] went back to was rock and roll and he
[1:22:32] still goes that message church and he's
[1:22:34] admitting to me these things and look at
[1:22:36] the perfect example if you don't keep
[1:22:38] sin out of your heart it's gonna go
[1:22:39] right to the things of the world because
[1:22:42] he's angry with people in the church and
[1:22:43] so what music makes him feel angry rock
[1:22:45] and roll mix and feel angry right that's
[1:22:49] what it does either sex or anger right
[1:22:51] that's what it basically what it is you
[1:22:54] see so we've got a guard against those
[1:22:56] things we got a guard we got to be
[1:22:58] diligent on our toes and so I'm watching
[1:23:01] my children a whole time with this rock
[1:23:02] and roll and I go up and talk to the
[1:23:04] family and I said they say some about
[1:23:07] dance and I said I said yeah they like
[1:23:09] to dance I said I was real loud in front
[1:23:10] these people I make sure I was really
[1:23:11] loud my wife's shaking her head I made
[1:23:15] sure I was really loud and I said I said
[1:23:18] that very word I said we don't dance for
[1:23:19] the devil we only
[1:23:20] for Jesus and they go okay okay because
[1:23:25] I've got to be Bilgin I've got to be
[1:23:28] prepared I've got to know they're gonna
[1:23:30] try and then one of my girls come up and
[1:23:32] said yeah if somebody just asked me to
[1:23:34] dance and I said no thank you
[1:23:35] what was that that was God's hand of
[1:23:37] protection Church hallelujah and
[1:23:41] somebody asked me about dance I said
[1:23:42] well if they play the right music
[1:23:44] I might dance out there but you got to
[1:23:45] get some Jesus music out there you know
[1:23:48] see me dance a little bit by God's grace
[1:23:49] I danced at Bible club I've only danced
[1:23:51] a couple of times here but I dance
[1:23:53] wherever there's a worship of Lord I
[1:23:55] like to dance there praise the Lord but
[1:23:58] that's just an example you got to be
[1:24:00] prepared you got to be ready for the
[1:24:01] battle you got to know the battle you're
[1:24:04] walking in to praise God and so jesus
[1:24:06] said if you don't I'm coming like a
[1:24:08] thief if you're not ready
[1:24:10] I'll come like a thief because you're
[1:24:11] not even looking for me he goes on to
[1:24:16] say but the world of the ungodly was
[1:24:18] swept away to about Noah's day though
[1:24:21] they daily were in contact with the
[1:24:22] righteous and heard the truth they
[1:24:24] turned to the side until was too late
[1:24:27] those completely carnal people and that
[1:24:29] ancient period type out today the
[1:24:31] nominal Christians whose lives are full
[1:24:34] of earthly things now let's not let's
[1:24:36] not make this word make us think outside
[1:24:38] the message let's just think about
[1:24:39] anyone anyone okay so the people and
[1:24:45] Noah's day that were lost type out
[1:24:46] Christians today any church whose lives
[1:24:48] are full of earthly things what's our
[1:24:50] lives full of if I could look at your
[1:24:52] schedule and your calendar what would it
[1:24:55] be pull up is it full of earthly things
[1:24:56] and pleasures of the earth or or he said
[1:25:01] or is it first a desire for spiritual
[1:25:03] things because whatever it's full of
[1:25:07] that's what you're gonna get back
[1:25:09] whatever you're put you're either
[1:25:10] preparing for the tribulation or you're
[1:25:12] preparing for the rapture and you're
[1:25:14] what you're preparing for one of the
[1:25:15] other you must be village it watching
[1:25:17] for Christ to come in fact he comes when
[1:25:21] they're not expecting him so we got to
[1:25:23] constantly be expecting the return of
[1:25:24] the Lord see their lives are full of
[1:25:27] earthly things and take pleasure in them
[1:25:29] to such an extent that they have no
[1:25:31] desire for the spiritual
[1:25:34] and they're not at all aware of nor
[1:25:35] ready for his appearing people can come
[1:25:39] to church in our church any Church and
[1:25:41] have no desire for spiritual things can
[1:25:45] you say amen to that you've all seen it
[1:25:47] people can come to church they're here
[1:25:48] but they really don't want to be here
[1:25:50] they really would rather be somewhere
[1:25:52] else and this is what brother am saying
[1:25:56] this is I'm coming as a thief you must
[1:25:58] watch you must prepare you must have
[1:26:00] your mind right he must be thinking
[1:26:01] about the coming of the Lord your life
[1:26:04] must be full of spiritual desires not
[1:26:06] earthly desires
[1:26:07] I remember Bram said the secret to being
[1:26:13] a Christian in the church age book he
[1:26:15] said the seeker is when trials come he
[1:26:16] said you increase your service to Christ
[1:26:18] you don't pull away and give Christ less
[1:26:21] you give more of Christ you give more to
[1:26:24] him he said that is the secret to
[1:26:27] Christianity creasing your service for
[1:26:30] Christ
[1:26:31] now the eulogy I looked up eulogy on
[1:26:34] Google and apparently a eulogy is
[1:26:36] something you say in remembrance of
[1:26:37] someone who's passed away so here's what
[1:26:41] the eulogy is for the church now has a
[1:26:48] few names even in sardis which have not
[1:26:50] defiled their garments they shall walk
[1:26:52] with me in white for they are worthy of
[1:26:58] course the word names means people as it
[1:27:00] says in acts 1:15 concerning those in
[1:27:02] the upper room the number of names
[1:27:03] together we're about 120 but to me it
[1:27:06] goes far beyond just signifying people
[1:27:08] it brings out the truth that is set
[1:27:10] forth in every age which was spoken to
[1:27:12] us by our Lord with great emphasis it is
[1:27:15] this the church system of these ages is
[1:27:18] made up of two vines the true and the
[1:27:19] false
[1:27:20] God and his own sovereign purpose has
[1:27:22] put them all together calling them the
[1:27:24] church see in this age how he's rebuked
[1:27:27] them saying unto the church which is he
[1:27:31] said not churches are in Sardis
[1:27:33] but lumping them together so Jesus loves
[1:27:36] the true church and the false church
[1:27:38] together he said the church which is I
[1:27:42] know that works you are dead he says
[1:27:45] your works are unfulfilled and then he
[1:27:47] goes he says on thou this church in
[1:27:51] sardis has a few people in you that are
[1:27:53] right and not wrong like the majority
[1:27:57] doesn't that sound familiar there's a
[1:27:59] few people that are right in this day
[1:28:00] there's just a few people that are right
[1:28:03] in this day that are actually walking
[1:28:05] worthy of Christ today that's why these
[1:28:09] churches ages are so important they give
[1:28:11] us more revelation for our lives few
[1:28:15] that are actually walking a worthy life
[1:28:17] we'll get to worthy in just a moment now
[1:28:22] these people that were the true saints
[1:28:23] of God were walking all pleasing unto
[1:28:25] the Lord their garments were clean you
[1:28:28] see in those days the garments would
[1:28:30] sweep along the road and pick up dirt
[1:28:31] and defilement these were watching how
[1:28:34] they walk so that they were not
[1:28:35] corrupted by the world they were in the
[1:28:37] spirit and walking in the spirit
[1:28:41] they were wholly without blame before
[1:28:43] him thus they were fulfilling their
[1:28:45] purpose for that is what Ephesians 1:4
[1:28:48] says is the purpose of God for us that
[1:28:51] we should be holy and without blame
[1:28:53] before him glory got a few more slides
[1:28:57] here I'm coming down I got 10 minutes
[1:28:58] here by God's grace I'm trying to land
[1:29:01] here I'd say now from this verse which
[1:29:04] shows the elect of God to be a few names
[1:29:07] you can see clearly that we have been
[1:29:09] teaching about this age it was chaotic
[1:29:11] it was unfulfilled Martin Luther's age
[1:29:14] was chaotic and unfulfilled it was split
[1:29:17] scores of ways and God rebuked it almost
[1:29:20] in its entirety it was weak and sickly
[1:29:23] and ready to die it was not the glorious
[1:29:26] area it wasn't the glorious era that
[1:29:29] carnal minded Protestant historians have
[1:29:31] tried to make it because there was only
[1:29:34] a few that were really on fire Martin
[1:29:38] Luther being the one with the most fire
[1:29:39] write the message of the age you can't
[1:29:42] ascend above his revelation he said it's
[1:29:46] not the glorious area that they made it
[1:29:47] there was actually very few walking in
[1:29:49] white and that's according to Jesus now
[1:29:52] who we gonna take the historians are we
[1:29:54] gonna take Jesus we got to take Jesus he
[1:29:57] said there's actually few in this age
[1:29:59] that actually we're walking worthy of
[1:30:01] the
[1:30:01] gospel one quick look at that tree saw
[1:30:05] was cankered and blighted denuded of
[1:30:08] leaf and barren of fruit except for some
[1:30:11] deformed and worming fruit that was fast
[1:30:13] dropping to the ground but be but hold a
[1:30:16] moment look closer there at the top the
[1:30:19] light of the Sun were some first fruits
[1:30:21] a few names perfect in him for they were
[1:30:24] born of him fill with him and walking
[1:30:26] with him by his word thank God for those
[1:30:29] few thank God for Martin Luther thank
[1:30:32] God for his wife thank God for those who
[1:30:34] faithfully filed the Word of God now you
[1:30:37] remember this picture I showed you this
[1:30:39] was made by a Rommel able I rely qalaat
[1:30:41] of his illustrations now there's a Roman
[1:30:45] Catholic okay
[1:30:47] Baptist Java witnesses Wesley's okay
[1:30:51] Methodists okay Wesley's alright so in
[1:30:54] the days of Luther where's Luther
[1:30:57] anybody see Luther up there and I'm mr.
[1:30:59] Luther I missed it I know he lived in
[1:31:04] the 1500s anyway not sure about the
[1:31:08] timing on that but the point is at the
[1:31:10] top after all these moves of God have
[1:31:13] gone forth there's light at that there's
[1:31:15] life at the top praise God that's the
[1:31:17] point I want to make we've got to we've
[1:31:19] come out of all these things I was
[1:31:20] raised in Assemblies of God I've come
[1:31:22] out of there by God's grace amen we're
[1:31:24] raised in different ones of these dead
[1:31:26] branches that the bugs have eaten away
[1:31:28] and you see the bugs that have eaten
[1:31:30] away the lives of church members where
[1:31:32] there's no real hunger for God they
[1:31:34] don't want to walk worthy like yesterday
[1:31:36] I'll just say it again at the wedding
[1:31:37] I'm not trying to say anything bad about
[1:31:39] anybody but church but Lutheran
[1:31:41] preachers are out there dancing to rap
[1:31:43] music and Here I am standing like this
[1:31:44] like what are you doing you're a
[1:31:45] preacher you know you ought to live
[1:31:47] higher than that we've got power to live
[1:31:49] higher than that amen doing electric
[1:31:53] slides and all kinds of things like that
[1:31:55] they need an electric slide back into
[1:31:56] the God's Word
[1:31:57] I need a slide back into God's Word with
[1:31:59] electric shock of Revelation amen
[1:32:01] with a shock proof vest and something
[1:32:03] like that they need to get shocked amen
[1:32:05] I got shocked by God's Word how it calls
[1:32:07] for holiness and it hates the things of
[1:32:10] the world praise God and real then the
[1:32:13] real life of Christ will come in a real
[1:32:14] Justin
[1:32:15] it's exactly right you see but at the
[1:32:20] point he's making the point that in
[1:32:21] Luther's day there was just a few that
[1:32:23] were actually walking worthy of the
[1:32:25] gospel because Jesus said a few of you
[1:32:27] are walking worthy of me and they shall
[1:32:34] walk with me Jesus says I love these red
[1:32:37] letter words don't you that's why I mean
[1:32:39] so much to me because I know it's Christ
[1:32:40] speaking it's all the Bible's inspired
[1:32:43] don't even wrong but this is Christ
[1:32:45] specific red letter words they're so
[1:32:46] precious that is what God says he will
[1:32:49] bestow upon them for this upright walk
[1:32:52] that is part of their inheritance that
[1:32:55] he's reserved for them hey man if they
[1:32:58] were willing to walk with him through
[1:33:00] the toils and snares of life and be an
[1:33:02] honor to him he was going to reward them
[1:33:05] he's not forgetful of our labor of love
[1:33:08] God will always recommence us for our
[1:33:11] efforts to please him amen that's
[1:33:14] beautiful
[1:33:15] so part of Jesus reward for this age was
[1:33:18] I walk with you if you walk with me I'll
[1:33:21] walk with you amen
[1:33:22] I'll certainly walk with you he said yes
[1:33:25] they had walked through the world and
[1:33:27] had not part taken of it they not let
[1:33:29] the world systems overcome them when the
[1:33:32] illustrious names of that age had
[1:33:34] yielded to the blandishments of the
[1:33:36] state and chosen public I'm sorry
[1:33:38] political mindedness rather than
[1:33:39] spiritual mindedness and we're on their
[1:33:42] way back into the world
[1:33:43] those few stood for the word of God and
[1:33:46] thereby honor the Lord now he would
[1:33:49] honor them in return hallelujah for they
[1:33:53] shall walk with him in white they had
[1:33:56] identified themselves with him on earth
[1:33:57] and now he would identify himself with
[1:33:59] them in the New Jerusalem and how Marvis
[1:34:03] will be that identification in that
[1:34:06] beautiful church my you know the hard
[1:34:09] part is that our honor many times comes
[1:34:11] later down the road that's our hard tart
[1:34:13] our part as human beings we don't see
[1:34:15] the reward right away do it
[1:34:17] that's why we got to have spiritual eyes
[1:34:19] of faith so we can see long-term praise
[1:34:22] God we can see the reward we can look
[1:34:25] beyond the curtain of time amen or we
[1:34:28] can do that any time we turn on the
[1:34:29] fifth seal we can look past the curtain
[1:34:30] of time hallelujah praise God we've got
[1:34:33] to have a long-term eagle eye vision to
[1:34:35] be able to see there is a reward for all
[1:34:37] those who walk with Christ now praise
[1:34:39] God well Graham said it makes me rejoice
[1:34:42] and yet it makes me weep to think of his
[1:34:45] condescension for you will note that he
[1:34:48] is look at this I love this Jesus is not
[1:34:50] dressed in another color different from
[1:34:55] the Saints as earthly leaders would do
[1:34:58] so today no they're like him he is like
[1:35:04] them they are like him even as John said
[1:35:07] for they see him as he is
[1:35:10] what a beautiful example think all the
[1:35:13] world leaders they all look different
[1:35:14] from everybody else but Jesus looks like
[1:35:16] everybody else he wants to be identified
[1:35:19] with one of them the Bible said he's a
[1:35:21] joint heir with his brethren praise God
[1:35:23] he's their God but he's also their
[1:35:25] brother praise God hallelujah
[1:35:28] and he dresses just like they do amen
[1:35:31] Oh glory all right just a few more
[1:35:34] minutes yeah I got four minutes notice
[1:35:37] Jesus says write letter words for they
[1:35:39] are worthy they are worthy
[1:35:47] do you realize who's saying this does
[1:35:50] everybody realize it is Jesus the worthy
[1:35:54] one himself this is the only one who is
[1:35:58] accounted worthy to take the book out of
[1:36:00] the hand of him who sits upon the throne
[1:36:02] in Revelation chapter four and five and
[1:36:04] now this worthy one is saying to his
[1:36:07] Saints you are worthy here is the one
[1:36:12] the only one qualified to judge and
[1:36:14] indeed all judgment is committed unto
[1:36:16] him and he says you are worthy I wonder
[1:36:20] if we could say that right if you can
[1:36:22] say that reveaied when you say I am
[1:36:23] worthy of Christ's reward hard to say
[1:36:28] that isn't it because I don't feel I'm
[1:36:30] worthy
[1:36:31] like on Wednesday night I'm crying
[1:36:33] saying God let me do something for your
[1:36:35] name you know Wednesday night service I
[1:36:36] just wanna do something for Jesus praise
[1:36:38] God I feel like many times I don't do
[1:36:40] anything and I think we all get under
[1:36:43] guilt you know personal condemnation and
[1:36:45] things like that
[1:36:45] but if we do God's work for our life
[1:36:49] he's gonna say you are worthy remember
[1:36:52] earlier I said your position might be a
[1:36:54] farmer he said it might be a housewife
[1:36:56] he said it might be a preacher a doctor
[1:36:58] he said whatever your position is he
[1:37:00] said stay in your position amen and be
[1:37:02] the best position you can be for God's
[1:37:04] glory amen hallelujah Jesus calls them
[1:37:11] worthy and I mean let me say like this
[1:37:15] you're never gonna hear me say I'm
[1:37:17] worthy other than just was like we did
[1:37:18] there
[1:37:18] but really we want Jesus to be the one
[1:37:21] to say it Oprah Lois you're so worthy of
[1:37:24] praise no no sir
[1:37:25] oh brother Kevin you're so worthy of
[1:37:27] praise no let us not say let's have
[1:37:29] Jesus say it praise God
[1:37:31] but one day church like we said one day
[1:37:33] we'll stand there and we'll be able to
[1:37:34] say we are worthy of the reward when our
[1:37:38] bodies change and every all the things
[1:37:40] are past there's no more temptation no
[1:37:42] more lust no more sin no more anything
[1:37:44] no more pride anything like that
[1:37:46] we'll be able to say we're worthy by the
[1:37:47] blood of Christ but remember said these
[1:37:50] words are as astounding as are the words
[1:37:53] of Rome Romans 8:33 I'm gonna read out
[1:37:55] of the King James the way translation
[1:37:58] says God says I am righteous hmm God
[1:38:02] says I am righteous Romans 8:33 how many
[1:38:06] believe that you're righteous in Christ
[1:38:08] this morning you believe that Romans
[1:38:10] 8:33
[1:38:11] it says who shall lay any thing to the
[1:38:13] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:38:15] justifies in other words God made me
[1:38:19] righteous right God says I'm righteous
[1:38:22] God says I'm going to heaven God says
[1:38:24] I'm saved
[1:38:25] God's Word says that I don't care what
[1:38:26] you say God said it amen I don't care
[1:38:29] what mom or dad or grandma or friends or
[1:38:31] anyone it's what God says about me
[1:38:34] that's what matters and he said you are
[1:38:36] worthy because you've walked with me
[1:38:38] praise God
[1:38:39] he said if you walk with me and I walk
[1:38:42] with you you walk for me I'll walk with
[1:38:43] you and then you'll be you'll begin
[1:38:45] white robes as well by God's grace let
[1:38:48] me bring this right here I got two
[1:38:49] minutes one minute they're in the white
[1:38:52] light of God's righteousness hear the
[1:38:55] sweet voice of Jesus as he says these
[1:38:57] are mine they are righteous they are
[1:39:00] worthy they shall walk with me in white
[1:39:03] and I didn't have time for this because
[1:39:05] like I said I only had one minute I went
[1:39:08] through the whole New Testament unworthy
[1:39:09] and unworthy scriptures we should
[1:39:12] recognize our unworthiness like John the
[1:39:14] Baptist I'm not worthy to loose his
[1:39:16] sandals we should be like the Roman
[1:39:19] centurion I'm not worthy that you've
[1:39:21] come to my house yet Jesus says you've
[1:39:23] got great faith right the workman Jesus
[1:39:28] disciples had to be worthy of the meat
[1:39:30] that they received when they went to
[1:39:32] preach to the Jews he said don't go to
[1:39:33] the loss or I'm sure don't go to the
[1:39:35] Gentiles go to the lost sheep of the
[1:39:37] house of Israel Matthew chapter 10 Jesus
[1:39:42] told us who would be worthy of his
[1:39:44] reward let's read that Matthew 10:32 I
[1:39:46] got one minute Matthew 10:32 because I
[1:39:50] think that's what we're gonna leave here
[1:39:51] thinking about well brother brother
[1:39:53] Jesse preached that Jesus is going to
[1:39:54] call me worthy how do I know I'm worthy
[1:39:56] well let me show you some scriptures
[1:39:57] here it's along the same lines of
[1:40:00] obedience and everything like that of
[1:40:02] course but let's see exactly what Jesus
[1:40:04] Christ said in Matthew 10:32 our Lord
[1:40:07] amen 10:32 whosoever therefore shall
[1:40:18] confess me before men him will I confess
[1:40:20] also before my father which is in heaven
[1:40:22] I had a great a great time doing that
[1:40:24] yesterday before all those dancers and
[1:40:25] drinkers I had a great time saying Jesus
[1:40:28] Christ right in front of them I love
[1:40:30] that verse 33 but whosoever shall deny
[1:40:33] me before men him will I also deny
[1:40:35] before my father which is in heaven
[1:40:38] think not that I'm come to send peace on
[1:40:40] the earth I am come not to send peace
[1:40:41] but a sword for I'm come to set a man at
[1:40:45] variance against his father and the
[1:40:47] daughter against her mother in the
[1:40:48] daughter-in-law against her
[1:40:48] mother-in-law and a man's foes should be
[1:40:50] they of his own household he that loveth
[1:40:52] father or mother more than me is not
[1:40:55] what worthy here's how you know if
[1:40:58] you're worthy another way
[1:40:59] if you love your family more than you
[1:41:01] love Christ you're not worthy in other
[1:41:05] words he's got to be your first love he
[1:41:08] has to be number one very familiar but
[1:41:13] let's ties him perfectly with what he
[1:41:15] says you are worthy who are the worthy
[1:41:17] ones those who love Christ above their
[1:41:19] families and he that loveth son or
[1:41:22] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:41:24] me you have to love Christ more than
[1:41:28] your children now that doesn't mean
[1:41:30] you'd ever deprive them of anything when
[1:41:31] they grow up and they disagree with the
[1:41:32] gospel or any that ever happens we got a
[1:41:34] love Christ more than we love children
[1:41:37] verse 38 and he that taketh not his
[1:41:40] cross and follow after me is not worthy
[1:41:42] of me that's where we gotta find our
[1:41:46] that's where we got to find our ministry
[1:41:48] what's our ministry what's our cross
[1:41:49] what's your cross what's my cross what
[1:41:53] cross are we dragging along on the
[1:41:56] journey of life praise God
[1:41:58] what is that heavy weight burden you
[1:42:00] feel like I just can't get this weight
[1:42:02] off my heart I got to keep preaching I
[1:42:04] got to keep doing everything I can I got
[1:42:06] to take more things on I just got to do
[1:42:08] something I got to get somebody to
[1:42:09] Christ
[1:42:10] what great cross or burden are we
[1:42:12] draggin let's have something on our
[1:42:13] hearts amen we have to have a cross like
[1:42:17] we said for the housewife it's the Train
[1:42:19] the mother right that's a great or great
[1:42:21] training the children that's a great
[1:42:22] burden for the farmer you know he's got
[1:42:24] to provide food and all these things
[1:42:26] that burdens the cross verse 39 he that
[1:42:31] find us his life shall lose it he that
[1:42:33] loses his life for my sake shall find it
[1:42:36] he that receiveth you receiveth me and
[1:42:39] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[1:42:41] sent me he that receiveth the prophet in
[1:42:44] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:42:45] Prophet's reward glory and he that
[1:42:49] receiveth the righteous man the name of
[1:42:50] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:42:52] man's reward and whosoever shall give to
[1:42:55] drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:42:57] cup of cold water only in the name of
[1:43:00] the disciple verily I say unto you he
[1:43:02] shall know were wise lose his reward
[1:43:05] here are two clear clear ways you know
[1:43:09] you're worthy of Christ
[1:43:11] he's made you worthy right you love
[1:43:14] Christ more than everyone in your family
[1:43:16] no matter what anybody says he's and you
[1:43:19] won't deny him before any man or woman
[1:43:20] and second you have a cross you have a
[1:43:24] burden that you carry daily you're
[1:43:27] following you're constantly following
[1:43:28] Christ with this heavy burden you're
[1:43:30] dragging along your journey of life it's
[1:43:34] not easy but you have a God called cross
[1:43:37] to carry it that's how you know you're
[1:43:41] worthy of Christ and that's not my words
[1:43:44] I didn't misplace the word brother Adam
[1:43:46] I didn't this locate it right
[1:43:48] I didn't misplace it I didn't
[1:43:50] misinterpret it that's exactly what
[1:43:52] Christ said let's stand to our feet the
[1:43:59] next one what makes somebody unworthy of
[1:44:01] the wedding they say oh I can't come to
[1:44:03] the wedding I've got merchandise
[1:44:04] I've got farms I've got families that
[1:44:06] makes you unworthy of the rapture the
[1:44:08] Bible says I mean we could go I could
[1:44:10] this is a whole nother message I got one
[1:44:12] two three four five I got all kinds of
[1:44:14] more slides all kinds of scriptures
[1:44:16] unworthy how many want to be worthy
[1:44:18] though the way we're worthy is Christ
[1:44:22] with Jesus we'll look at us church our
[1:44:38] faith you all want to be there
[1:44:41] look at all of us who are faithful no
[1:44:44] say you I'm walking with you because not
[1:44:47] because on earth you walk for me you
[1:44:51] kept your garments unspotted from the
[1:44:53] world you were constantly watching even
[1:44:57] late nights even in hard hours even
[1:44:59] times where it's very hard to watch you
[1:45:01] stayed awake spiritually you kept
[1:45:06] looking at with you kept holding your
[1:45:08] little candle burning your candle
[1:45:10] looking out the window
[1:45:13] I wonder I hear Christ coming is Christ
[1:45:17] coming soon I hear the horses coming of
[1:45:21] Christ a great audit tirage we kept
[1:45:25] looking we kept watching we kept being
[1:45:28] prepared we kept our lives pure
[1:45:31] unspotted from the world
[1:45:33] how many Father Lord your word says pure
[1:45:36] religion is to visit the widows and
[1:45:40] their children in their affliction and
[1:45:42] to keep himself unspotted from the world
[1:45:48] when I thank you for those Lord and we
[1:45:52] could boil down Lord many of our
[1:45:54] motivations this morning
[1:45:55] I wonder if that be our main motivation
[1:45:56] dear God all I want is to be pure from
[1:46:01] sin all I want is to be free from the
[1:46:05] stains of this world how many raise your
[1:46:06] hands say brother Jesse that's my design
[1:46:08] I want to be free from the stains the
[1:46:10] word I want pure religion in my life
[1:46:15] North appeared on Wednesday night I just
[1:46:18] want to do something for you Lord not I
[1:46:19] want to preach your word I want to be
[1:46:21] faithful with the influence you've given
[1:46:23] to the Lord God I wanna be faithful with
[1:46:27] nor the groups that you placed me with
[1:46:30] your God especially the church but also
[1:46:34] now the school Lord is there's a little
[1:46:35] group there dear God and now go in the
[1:46:38] middle school I want to be faithful I
[1:46:41] don't want to get drunk in spiritually
[1:46:43] as Jesus's parable said and start
[1:46:45] beating and mistreating the people but
[1:46:50] your promise that we don't want to pull
[1:46:51] any punches if we know their sin we
[1:46:53] don't want to Barney punches and let sin
[1:46:55] grow as leaven in the church we're in
[1:46:57] our school group Lord God we want to
[1:47:02] hear you say your word Lord is that we
[1:47:06] said I try to get the people to imagine
[1:47:08] themselves saying it it's so hard to say
[1:47:10] I'm worthy of Christ's reward it's so
[1:47:12] hard to say because we often fall short
[1:47:17] remind us of how quickly you forgive
[1:47:19] dear God remind us of how gracious you
[1:47:21] are
[1:47:24] bring these things to our remembrance
[1:47:27] truly in Luther's day you had a few that
[1:47:30] walked before you and white and the Lord
[1:47:33] you have a few today Lord God that are
[1:47:36] walking before you right they're walking
[1:47:38] with you they're following you they have
[1:47:41] a cross they have a burden they have a
[1:47:43] ministry it's heavy at times it's hard
[1:47:49] to pull it sometimes as long as we keep
[1:47:51] our eyes up on the one who's in front of
[1:47:53] us one of her following you Lord God you
[1:47:58] said you'll make up burden light will
[1:48:02] transform our minds Lord will simply see
[1:48:05] that our affliction was light affliction
[1:48:06] for God and it's unworthy to be compared
[1:48:11] to the glory which will come here after
[1:48:14] Lord the sufferings we have now are not
[1:48:19] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:48:20] that is to come for the privilege or
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:29] night yesterday as I drove all my count
[1:48:31] of such a privilege I get the stand
[1:48:33] there against rock and roll and rap I
[1:48:35] just counted a privilege I get to stand
[1:48:36] there against that can call out against
[1:48:39] the Lord God thank you
[1:48:41] I'll stand with you I'll never deny your
[1:48:45] lord help me to never deny you lord help
[1:48:47] us each one of us Lord God do not deny
[1:48:51] you before men and help us to walk with
[1:48:56] our cross that might be worthy of this
[1:48:58] vocation
[1:48:59] where'd which we're talking these are
[1:49:02] red letter words Lord I have not added
[1:49:04] to your word this morning these are just
[1:49:05] your pure beautiful words to whom much
[1:49:09] is given this message much is required
[1:49:13] I remember my mother told me that many
[1:49:18] times and I tried to walk worthy of that
[1:49:19] Lord even in high school I do have
[1:49:22] things other people did Lord God I try
[1:49:24] to keep a pure Peter knows Lord it might
[1:49:27] be said Lord how much greater that Lord
[1:49:29] God or would not publicize our own us
[1:49:34] necessarily but heavens eyes are all
[1:49:36] parts of your God
[1:49:38] the Bible said there's a cloud of
[1:49:41] witnesses Oh glory there's angels that
[1:49:45] are witnessing Lord God our lives no God
[1:49:49] nor most of all you're watching their
[1:49:52] choices you're watching when you're
[1:49:55] looking for someone Lord who's walking
[1:49:57] worthy that will keep their garments
[1:49:59] white Lord if any of us the Lord have on
[1:50:03] shore or maybe spear see take the beach
[1:50:06] of the blood and just feed off our
[1:50:07] garments right now as we pray more clean

[1:50:20] keeping your lamp trimmed wonder if this
[1:50:24] is the day what would I do how would I
[1:50:27] act if I knew he was coming today
