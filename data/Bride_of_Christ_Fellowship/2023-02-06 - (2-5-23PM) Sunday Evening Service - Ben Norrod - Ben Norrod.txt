invite our brother to come on [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] those he says it is [Music] us came along please [Music] so appreciate that appreciate the Lord's Grace to us tonight and I want to say thank you to brother Jesse and the church body for receiving us I've had a wonderful time today fellowship and just being able to got to jam with my buddy and and play some music this afternoon and if you know anything about me at all you know that I'd be sitting there like that 12 hours later just like that I'm not moving I I like that I told somebody one time if I could just do the music thing and quit the preaching thing I'd do that thing and not that thing amen I I like it I enjoy it and we so appreciate the Lord now I I sang everything I'm going to sing to you this morning we're going to get into the word of the Lord right away all right Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 I know that it's getting uh late in the evening and I know many of you are going to be traveling home trying to get back in the bed get rested up for work and for school or whatever else you got facing you and so I'm going to try my best not to be too lengthy let's see 10 before I promise to get you out of here no later than 8 30. I promise that'll be amen that'll be be my word to you amen and I'm not even careful talking that way because I've seen the Holy Ghost come down make that happen just that way amen people sit Spellbound for hours at a time I sure see the Lord do that amen but you know we try our best to be mindful of everything that we're facing and time is honest whether we like it or not time is tearing us right in the face but appreciate you folks appreciate everything about you and love your spirit your Christian spirit and I love your fellowship and and you know just appreciate the Lord and we're certainly going to be continuing to pray for you all and you all continue to pray for us and thank you for all the hospitality and so Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 23 and 24. uh the Lord willing tonight I want to speak to you upon the ministry of surrender the ministry of surrenders how I want to title this and I I know now you married women you've done now you think you're going to get it now right now is the time you know I I I promise you I'm not going to use this scripture to hit on the married women and and Bash at them and whatever more you're not in trouble tonight I promise we're going to use this as a parallel to some spiritual things and I think brother Brown did that himself whenever he preached the visible Union of the Bride he went to Romans 7 and he brought it back in how that seemingly he said Paul speaking marriage and divorce he said but this is a spiritual thing that he wanted to talk about between Christ and the bride well that's that's what I've got on my mind tonight too Ephesians 5 verse 22. it says wives submit yourselves under your own husbands as unto the Lord the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything you know I like the way the Bible does things and the way God allowed scripture to be wrote I like the way that it shows did you notice Paul's saying your own husband's in there and you know that kind of knocks in this whole commune cultists you know every man bosses the women around and this kind of thing you know this really kind of shows you exactly how that God wanted things to be done and uh not you know one man boss and all the women around and stuff like that but let every woman unto her own her own husband and the spiritual type to that is is that God don't want 48 men trying to tell the bride what to do he's the boss he wants her to be subject unto him not 12 different denominations and 14 different this that and the others amen but unto him alone shall she keep I like that amen now I want to read to you the Lord we will end here out of a message called Jehovah Jireh and uh the Bible said that we're to be submissive and to subject ourselves and then brother Bram says that it's a woman's nature he says the nature of a woman to surrender to a man the nature of the church he said is to surrender to Christ surrender to his will Just Surrender she has no thinking of her own she takes his word not somebody else's and he says that if Eve would have done that very thing said we would have never had to die but she listened to reasoning but the real bride of Christ takes the headship of Christ the word and only believes God's word that's the real restored bride he says hallelujah amen let's pray together with the word while your heads are bowed this evening if you'd have a need in your heart something you'd like to be remembered in prayer would you just raise your hand to the Lord amen my hands up too Lord Jesus we are so grateful for the opportunity to come into this place Lord which is called thy house Lord really this room in the building that we're in could be used for any purpose but father it's been dedicated to the service of God and dedicated to the joyous rejoicing in the happiness of the Saints and for the prayers and the tears and the supplications of those Believers calling upon thy name and fathers we come into this place today we're asking that the Holy Ghost will not only take his word and speak to us by that word but Lord that you will also Grant to us the favor and the strength to be able to do and deliver what we need to do and say what needs to be said and father give us the strength to receive it as your children and I pray tonight Lord every evil thing will stand at Bay while we worship and receive from you and may the power of the Holy Ghost I pray just come down now take your word bless every life bless every uplifted hand may you not forget Lord that which is underneath each hand as we commit it to you for the glory of God in the name of Jesus we surrender it amen and amen and the Saints said amen and you may be seated and I said that out of habits you all had a good amen out therefore I could get it amen I like that that was good amen and you're a good church for that I promise you know not to not having to pull too much on that part I like that some Churches I feel like I I say come on say a man more than I actually preach amen try to get them to get in the rhythm of something you know and and uh and people that get mad at you about that oh you shouldn't pull on people you should pull on them in a congregation well I when you go to a basketball game that's what they got some cheerleaders in that band out there for us to get you into Rhythm or the spirit of something amen and uh when they're playing them old fight songs and then to get your hands are clapping you know and doing all that kind of stuff they're trying to get you in the Rhythm and the spirit of the of the game the football or whatever it might be that you're watching or playing and uh we sing and worship and say amen and praise the Lord and clap our hands and maybe even do a little dancing that the spirit hits Us in the right way Amen to get into the anointing of the Holy Ghost I like that amen now I want to speak to you tonight the Lord Lord helping us now I promise I'm not going to hold you super long I know you've had a long day already and I preached a little over with all the singing and everything it takes it into overtime and I'm going to try to be very brief with this and get the main points across and uh you know if you didn't have a good pastor I'd be worried I'd just dig in take extra time and do this like can but you know you you got good teaching here and good instruction at the little home church and and uh we thank the Lord for that so it uh it actually makes an evangelist job very very easy when you got a good pastor to come and visit I like that and um we sure appreciate amen the word of God we appreciate what we're being able to read and study after and I hope that what I've got to say tonight I hope it drives right to the core right to your very Soul amen the importance of surrendering to God and I know that I've uh probably come by this way and preach things that are similar I've mentioned surrendering and different things and I'm sure you're a pastor and other brothers has come through here have talked about they've talked about you know the uh the benefits and the uh the necessity and so forth of surrendering to the Lord and uh so I'm not really going to say much to you I don't think that uh in the way of the text itself that's odd or different to you surely by now you understand fully what it means to be a surrendered Christian to the Lord but what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to fill in all them little nooks and crannies on the subject that maybe things you haven't thought of or things you haven't seen or thought of before I'm going to ask the Lord to help us to see those parts and bring a lot of benefit to hearing about the subject tonight because we we need to understand I believe this with all of my heart we need to understand how important it is to become a surrendered person to the Lord now now I'm saying that and in your mind you're a Manning man and you know but we have to understand the exchange of that first of all it's easier said than it is done and I can stand up and say all day and end up preaching consent and say serve the Lord surrender the Lord give yourself to the Lord you know what I found out in my years of traveling and service to the people of God I found out a lot of people can say it but they don't know how to do it they don't know what it looks like and this is where I think that good Bible teaching comes into play here and now you little kitties you wanted Bible study somebody mentioned it or not I'm going to give you a lot of scriptures to run through so you keep your Bibles ready and we're going to look at some things by the help of the Lord and when we look at these things God helping us now I want to be very clear to you and say that first and foremost and this is something if you're taking a note be sure to put this down remember that the bride I'm talking about the wife of God the elected of God is the only one that can fully surrender to God understand that right now just like in Acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's only one real genuine true group on this planet for the last six thousand years there's only been one little bride of Christ that's ever been able to make that scripture Fully live by full repentance and that is the Bride of Jesus Christ now you say but brother Ben people surrender and people repent and things of that nature I know they do I'm certainly not saying that they don't I know what brother Brandon preached in future home when he talked about people that'll go to a meeting repent experience great sanctification and justification and things but yet what I'm talking about is more than just coming to church and receiving enough of the spirit to live a little cleaner and a little nicer a little bit better I'm talking about fully completely surrendering to God now you say well is it important why well it's important because a man and I'm quoting to you now from the Patmos Vision a man or a woman that is fully surrendered to God brother man says a man that does it I'm I'm saying a woman as well that fully surrenders to God is omnipotent in other words all powerful completely powerful and can control any situation now nodding back to this morning you think well what's the benefit of preaching things like what you preached if I've got real power with God I should be able to create squirrels speak to storms give uh you know give people their children and all the things that brother Branham did when he was here and the third pool come to him the message opened up to him the power and the authority come on him and he done all kinds of great Supernatural things yes but before that took place before any squirrel was created before any storm was moved and before any child was caused to come to repentance Amen brother branham's real power came from the ability to return love for hate good for evil and not to return evil for evil that's real power with God if you want to have real power with God Amen don't seek all of the great Supernatural things out there that that moves mountains and things like that Amen Let the love of the Lord Jesus and the power of God help you love those that would kill you Amen in that day in Calvary the prophet of God sin amen that when a man a woman comes to the place to where they can love the married very person that's going to kill him or want to kill him or do harm to him he said you can love that person not a put on but really love him he said you are staring heaven in the face you are standing in the vestibule of Heaven amen it goes to show real power with God is more than Supernatural outworking healing for example we've used healing for many years to be a Vindication of somebody's Ministry or somebody's life and well if I can heal the sick then that proves I'm a servant of God but Jesus said in that day many would come and say I've even raised the Dead cast out devils and done all kinds of things that's Divine Healing amen and yet at the same time Jesus said but I never knew you I never had a relationship with you so see they can be surrendered to a certain degree you with me still all right you listen amen now listen a person can surrender a gift they can surrender a gift and be very effective with that gift a person can surrender uh their mind and the God use them in a way with their mind to be very scientific and come up with answers and cures and whatever for things a person can surrender their body and Achieve great things in the physical manner amen but a person a man that is fully surrendered to God ain't just surrendering a part of them amen are just a portion of them or the one that's just going to help them look big or help somebody else out of a jam or something like that amen the Holy Ghost and real surrender is not a fire escape come on somebody amen but it is power with God to surrender everything you are including those parts that you don't want to surrender I hope you realize that the ability to want to to surrender the things you don't want to surrender that's what we're talking about God the Rubber and the road meeting together amen when a person can surrender something they don't want that ain't no problem parts of you that you don't care whether it gets surrendered or not that's not real overcoming y'all look at me like the mule staring at the new gate come on now amen but it's imparts of you that you're not all that interested in surrendering things about you you like or parts about you that you enjoy things or some little thing that you do amen but we don't want to surrender that to the Lord because that's where the real battle comes in but God wants you to surrender Body Spirit Soul every part of you every part of you exactly right now turn me to First Peter chapter 5. amen chapter 5 verse 5. but let's take for just a little bit Peter's words about surrender and submission and I'm going to say something to you and I hope you understand this real Christians are the only ones that know how to do this what I'm talking about real Christians now everybody else they're put on like they can you know you take a person that was raised and maybe a oh I don't know maybe the military or something like that and they learn how to be submissive and be obedient but obedience is not training obedience is not learning how to do something obedience is an act that comes from the heart to where you say to God even though I don't know how to do it I still want to I still want to do it that's real surrender and submission to God now looking at Peter's words here now watch he said likewise you're younger submit yourself unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resists of the proud and gives grace to the humble so humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time I want you to think about these words for a moment you know we get this idea a lot of times that people are supposed to be surrendered to just the Elder of the church that's true but you see Peter didn't just identify to be surrendered to just the Elder of the church but he said you all be subject one to another oh Hallelujah here's where the grass gets a little taller huh because then we go to thinking well you know and maybe not in this little Church of course but you know most of your home folks or family put together and and uh you know and you become friends and acquaintances and what more and you love the Lord and I don't expect you to have issues and things with one another but you know people they they have a problem being surrendered to somebody else has taught us and trained us to think in a manner of I do for me I don't do for you that is his anti-god and anti-christian as it can get amen amen well not too many amens on that but that is true anyhow right and that's the facts of it whether the world or Society or whatever tells us you better get chose because if you don't somebody's going to take it from you they can say that but when a Christian is is demanded by someone to they take something from you listen Jesus's words are still just as true as what we read this morning when he said if somebody steals your coat give them your cloak also the purpose of them scriptures is not to become pushovers to let people just run over us and do anything they want to but the purpose of that scripture is to tell us and instruct us not to get caught up in trying to be your own advocate amen why in the world would I want to advocate for myself when he is promised to be my advocator remember the Holy Ghost series brother Robin said that he is not only our our comforter and he's not only our forgiver and whatever more but he's also the advocates he speaks on our behalf I feel sorry for some of these people that will bash and fight against Ministry you know you take brother Jesse's broadcast on YouTube you know and and no doubt I'm sure as as I've experienced traveling like this you know you'll you'll find a Critic everywhere you turn around that you know people should be careful they should be careful when they start speaking to men anointed by the Holy Ghost led by the Lord to do things they shouldn't jump on the preacher for every little detail they shouldn't whisper behind the pastor's back about every decision he's made sure that's good amens keep them coming now let's get it out where it belongs neither should you do that one to another it shouldn't be that way for the saints of God everyone should be subject one to another one Believers should not be against believer and at each other's throat and all these kind of things like that all of that should be put away from us that there be no Schism in the body of Christ you see people can get attitudes well you know you're not the pastor well so what well you're not the song leader so what do I look down at my little toe and say well you're not an ear stupid thing no it's a part of me I want him right where he's at right and if I had to lose my toe I'd be mad about it I'd be upset about it hurt about it I'd feel weird and strange looking at my foot and see no toe there come on somebody we should feel the same way about one another that we should be so knit together in the love of God that we should long to have that kind of Fellowship one with another I don't mean you lay on the phone with one another and talk about all the latest happenings but you are bound together in love if something happens to that person though they might be living their own life in their own private way with their own autonomy yet you're still in the corner and in their Corner if they need help you'll be right there for them sure I think sometimes love in church is what we call Loving churches they think that means everybody getting together and going fishing all the time you know our sister's going out and doing certain things or whatever they might do amen I believe in Fellowship but Fellowship ain't always a sign that everybody's knit together in the love of God how do you know a church is going through the thing together whenever persecution strikes that little body brother Adam said it like this in the word of the church he said you just cling that much closer together right in other words have each other's back submit yourself one to another you know people will sing songs and they'll do things and uh you know and and maybe read a poem or you know help take the offering or some kind of a testimony and people because of the status of what they're looking at will be a little bit critical of that who's that guy think he is standing up here talking about what the Lord's done for him what the Lord's done as much for me as he has for him good for you but the point of it is we should be knit together be willing to hear what the toe has got to say when the ear gets its turn it can talk amen that's right but be there for one another support one another hold each other up in prayer you know I'm not a very big Fellowship guy Jesse no I'm not on the phone all the time and you know I'm a lot like brother cam I guess in a lot of ways I got my little bunch and you know I stay kind of isolated sometimes really I have to almost Ministry and busyness and things you know it you try to make friends and then you know you can't keep up on calls and you can't keep up on contact and somebody gets their feelings hurting and I feel like a dog so sometimes I just try to do what I can to look for those quality moments to reach out and tell somebody I really love them it proves that it don't always have to be a constant 24-hour surveillance of somebody's life but just a word at the right time the Bible said it this way a word fitly spoken in other words a word in the right season and that's what Believers that support one another do they look for the right moment to speak in and say hey I just want you to know you mean something to me that's why we should take advantage of every opportunity we get like that why would brother banham think it's such a bad thing that people be upset each other in the Tabernacle this is in 1960. he said they'd see each other on the street turn their head and walk the other way he's a this is a Freewheel Army this is a volunteer army what's he care what they do what brother Ben I'm having a problem with people getting mad not speaking to each other in the church as long as they're behaving themselves let them do what they want to but see he knew the scripture like we've read tonight submit yourself one to another become one body one Mind One Soul and you see when people get that attitude you do your thing I'll do my thing they don't realize it but they're under the spirit of the hour and the spirit of the hour is to isolate Satan's great tactic is to isolate divide and conquer get you off by yourself then he starts filling you up with the ideas that you're alone and by yourself and nobody loves you right and excuse this for my blunt speaking but sometimes we're dumb enough to let the devil get away with that hello church Preach to me amen exactly right we're silly enough to let the devil get away with them things when we should be seizing opportunities to reach out at the right moment and say hey I just wanted to send you a card what's your address and maybe in that card you might say something like I just want you to know I appreciate your testimony before the Lord Little Things married men and women can tell you that one of the things that keeps a marriage thriving is them little things oh some of you unmarried kids and boys and girls and men and women or whoever you are you may think ah brother Ben that don't help nothing uh-huh wait till she steals every hairbrush you got and tell me it don't mean nothing I went mining the other day through the house little old bags and purses and things had been kind of cast off you know they buy 4 000 of them things they use two of them and I went mining through the the land the the the the the landfill of bags and things I found I found 13 brushes every one of them belong to me amen I've been telling people for years they steal my brushes amen and nobody believed me but I found 13 of them things in bags little things maybe it wouldn't be that big of a deal if we were facing death but when you're living life little things matter and everything has a season to it some people say ah it doesn't matter if we were dying what would it matter I'm not dying though I'm in good health by the grace of God I'm happy I'm living my life and little things matter to me while I'm not in a state of desperation when emergency strikes those other things take their priorities that really matter things that maybe would be super important would come to the Forefront whether a man's got a hairbrush or not ain't gonna matter if I was facing the last hours of my life but I'm not dying I'm not in a state of emergency and sometimes people think that the only time it can reach out to one another and have Fellowship one with another is when somebody gets into a state of an emergency but you know just a handshake after church and a hey I really appreciated what you had to say you know I like that skirt and of course this is a sister to a sister if any brother tries that I think maybe we're going to have a funny spirit amen but maybe a compliment a nice compliment a Godly well-placed compliment might do a lot for somebody you don't know what kind of mind battle they might have been in just that week but for some older sister perhaps to look at a younger one and say I love the way your dress looks I love that color I love those beads you know sometimes when I was a boy I think back to the times that I felt the most supported and it wasn't in the the big things like that but it's whatever uh brother Ledford many years ago my pastor he'd been gone a number of years from Middletown Ohio I'd come to church and I started taking an interest in church and I sort of wanted to dress up and I stole some of Daddy's ties I put a shirt on and a tie on I go to church no brother left for wouldn't say nothing all that much at all to me hardly ever but I just sitting in the restaurant he'd say Hey you look like a little Reverend preacher over there I wouldn't didn't even know I was called to preach at the time but many years later I thought about how that made me feel I felt special I felt important I felt like I belonged to the group is anybody hearing what I'm saying to you this is what Peter said submit yourself one to another when one cries we all cry when one rejoices we all Rejoice amen now notice that he tells us that God resists the proud first then Pride takes on a different shape sometimes than what we think he does pride and arrogance can come in many many many many different multi-colored forms sometimes somebody that's prideful and has a lot of Pride about him or her don't always act like or look like they got a lot of pride Sometimes they come across very subtle in other words I I've met people in Ministry that you try to explain things to hard to say a word they even act agreeable at times but six months later you can see a complete difference toward the negative than the positive why why they were listening to you smiling and saying okay uh-huh wow uh-huh deep in their heart they were saying why don't you just be quiet I'm going to do what I want to do anyways stubbornness can take on that kind of form Pride can look like just the attitude of I ain't doing it who Do You Think You Are sure Pride can look like that but Pride can also Veil itself in a religious form stay with me a little while amen not but two hours to go don't worry Pride can reveal itself in the way of sin God done this for me and I've done this for the Lord and I it's all right to say them things and testify it's all right to talk about what the Lord's done and what you've done for the Lord but remember you're not the only Pebble on the beach and when you get excited about what you testify about what God's done with you and you've done for God Amen you need to show double excitement when the other person starts telling us right makes a big difference in that big difference because whether we believe it's not people can tell when you don't jump up and down for them and you do for you you can't Bluff Humanity folks they'll know exactly what's going on and they know exactly how to take you when you go One Direction instead of the other now remember I'm not poking this at this church specifically this is generalized preaching now in general hey if the shoe fits where but otherwise I don't think there's any feet in here that need the shoe I'm just saying but if you do that's all right so submission comes from an attitude of all right if you're a part of the body of Christ then I am under obligation to you my brother you my sister are part of me and I've got to take concern for you even if I don't know you think about how many times you hear about little works of God and things going around and people having things and it comes public all of a sudden the Holy Spirit strikes maybe the pastor's heart to announce it to the church not only are you praying for them but perhaps maybe you get together and send cards out or you you go visit them or do some kind of a thing if you sat on taught long enough you might disagree on everything there is Under the Sun from politics to favorite color to favorite team but that's not what binds us together not the agreement of carnality but what binds us together is the submission to the Holy Ghost that's in you and that's in me that we are brothers and we are sisters serving in the same body it's like in the military you take a couple guys and set them down and talk them out they may not have a speck of things in common not a spec but when that drill sergeant hollers out there I attend every one of them soldiers white black red purple green tall fat skinny whatever they are they snap in order why they've been trained to stay together not to be divided oh Hallelujah there's a prophecy about that you know one day standing in an old shopping center the prophet looks out and sees a vision and there comes a little bride every one of them dressed in their National garment and they were ever won an order you say prophecy prophecy it speaks of one day there'll be a group on this Earth amen maybe those that have gone by the way of the Grave amen that will combine and merge together with us that are alive and remain but before this bride goes out of here in the Rapture she will be an army Walking In step with the word of God and with each other whether you know it or not I got to stay in my place or I either step on you or fall back on you so The rhythms Hallelujah have to be perfect praise God you got to know your place and stay there that's a hard thing well how am I supposed to know what God wants to do with me have you asked him have you went to him in prayer and say hey what do you want me to do because that's the answer to a lot of things you know notice again in the message called the meanest man what about speaking about Rebecca I said Rebecca come to meet Isaac said did you notice she failed her face he said they do it yet today you see the nature of a woman is to yield to that man and that's the reason the church should be veiled is because it's got a head that's Christ now compare that with what Peter said here that God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble and this humble is clothed with humility I like that so in other words when she veiled her face to meet him the veil he spoke of was humility you know people in in in the message especially to my opinion have this all kind of mixed up had a conversation with a brother some weeks ago about this very thing I was carrying on at the pulpit and talking about how you know man and woman get on each other and how they fight and argue and fuss and carry on and you know the angels in every Church they have they almost have heart failure when you talk this way but that's what marriage is made of some guy said to me one time my wife and I don't ever fight and I said you don't lie either do you everybody has fusses I don't care who you are and I was talking about how that you know sometimes my mind may be going a certain direction my wife would have a better idea of it than I would and feeling led to the Lord no doubt stop me in my tracks hey think this over this is what you probably should do I know there's a lot of men right now in the message if they're online right now they're falling out of their barcaloungers oh my God you listen to a woman sure I would if that woman told me the truth if it's my wife and she tells me what's right then I ought to be humble enough and clothe the veil of humility to say it's not her it's not the man it's not the position not the church not nobody it's truth that was spoken to me and I stay humble when I hear the truth it doesn't matter where it comes from hey believe me I'm a big guy right you know big and scary sometimes scare kids the miracle of God I teach them for as long as I have been being scary as I am but they've got to worry anymore they're not too scared of me my little Chinese kids come into the window now and they see me and they go the Viking the Viking but you know sometimes sometimes I've had little grannies come to me 80 pounds soaking wet 104 years old with blue hair get me by the arms as sunny think this way about it not that way about it now you know what some big tough preacher guys would do some little frail woman speak to him in that manner I'm the man of God who does she think she is but brother Jesse if I'm veiled in humility Hallelujah I'm willing to listen to truth no matter where it comes from amen amen I'm a child of Truth and I'll receive it when it comes to me oh I like that yes sir no matter who they are or what their name is or where they come from doesn't matter to me I want to hear what's rhymes therefore the Bible said submit yourself one to another people have problems with that kind of stuff this brother was saying to me the other night he said brother Ben you and your wife fuss what was going on with something about her she's always going on something about me well don't you think that you ought to straighten that out I said why some of the best fun I've ever had in my life leave me alone and you know for him he said to me he was raised by a very militant father who said women didn't have an opinion in the house is that what Peter said be subject one to another in other words you'd be subject to me and I'll decide when it's time for you to be subject or not be subject or vice versa I'll decide when it's time for me to be subject to you in other words that's not what the Bible's saying you see the family unit which is what makes up our churches by the way can only be strong enough to survive all of the pitfalls and the harshness of Trials persecutions and everything else if we learn to submit ourselves one to another some of our sisters and I I don't mean no harm by this but some of them have been absolutely beat down by these dictating men that don't even want the women to raise their head in the church house so they come to the house of God they feel like a second-class citizen and whether we like this or not we using Brother brahm's message incorrectly have created race Wars gender Wars and everything else in our churches because we have forgotten the basis of this scripture right here submit ourselves one to another sure we have got to come walk into the platform one time talking about how you know that all of the evil started from a black man the serpent what he said I went back one day there's been many many years ago you know something a big rich white guys telling me yeah that's what that's that's right that's right I said wait a minute I had about 17 at the time I said where'd president say that at I was reading one day brother Jesse and I come across the quote we used to call it hybrid religion they named it spoken word you were going to see many years later the whole book is hybrid religion and in that very book brother Venom said they're trying to lay the serpent off to the colored race there's as ignorant as they can be he said color that was brother Ram's turn back in the 50s in other words the black people African-Americans whatever how you want to say it he said there's as ignorant as they can be what does that create it creates a divide in the church where if you're not white or you're not some kind of a uh typical atypical American white skin and whatever more somehow another God looks at you better than they looks at the the Asian or the uh whatever race they may be creating weight race Wars in churches because we focus upon you know these things and brother I'm going to describe Adam and Eve and he talked about Eve with her blonde hair and her blue eyes red Ram didn't do things like that because he was trying to throw off on One race or support another one he was just putting it in terms that he could understand he was dramatized in his own way and yet people will take things like that and use that to drive down the other groups in the church sure they do it you can sit look at me and be quiet all you want to but I'm telling you the truth and you know I'm telling you the truth sure I am gender wars in the church I said this some time ago in Iowa I was at brother Brooks says and I I I I wish I'd have expressed it better than what I said it up there but I was talking about you look at sisters in this day and age around the message and there's a lot of similarities between them you look at the girls they've all got the same kind of clothes the same kind of flat shoes and the same kind of hairdos that's all right Holiness unto the Lord fine Holiness is one thing but manufacturing is another and if we're not careful we're going to lose our individuality as believers and we're going to start adopting standards of what we call holiness that ain't nothing but a manufactured religion you take some of the African sisters and some of the colors and the bright colors they wear my mother's an old hardcore Apostolic she wouldn't be caught dead in some of them bright colors like that because to her you're sinning but like I told my mama a thousand times that's what they taught back in the 50s that ain't what's true that's not according to the message bright colors don't make you a prostitute that's what some of the more people believe hello somebody but what has it done created all kinds of schisms because we don't submit ourselves one to another I heard a story one time about the prophet of God and this gives you a good example of the attitude we should have about things like this brother Brown was down somewhere I think it was around the natives there was some kind of place and I forget it might have been even in Africa now that I think about it but anyways these men got down and they started worshiping at the bottom at the foot of a totem pole they looked around some of the brothers about to say isn't that awful and they looked around by the brown was down there with them he got back up in the truck and they said brother Branham what in the world were you doing he said see you don't understand they were worshiping the true God they just didn't know what he was all about so I got down there and worshiped with him he said because I know who he is he's not that God in that Idol down there and I guess brother round was down there with him raising his hand saying thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah they didn't even have the vocabulary to say it but Paul said I became a man to all men Glory that I might win the sinner and those that have no understanding and that's the same thing we've experienced around the ranks of this message we want people to come to the church that are already well trained and know all the message could say is and all the message words God help us if we had a group of people come walking in here tonight women would cut hair and man was shorts on and whatever other kind of thing they come walking to the back door and we'd set them down and we said don't you know what the prophet of God said no wonder we have completely forgotten the mission of the church is to go out there and win people to Jesus Christ [Applause] take them from any background any situation and place them where they can serve god without a hitch but we've tried to put people in a condition and put people in a position to where we want them to be the complete perfect message prototype before they sit down on our pews I could read you a couple things here I'm going to say because time won't let me but Brethren said that's where Pentecost has fell bitterly he said they want to get the Upper Crust he called it and they've long forgotten to go to the prostitute in the center and the drunkard and everybody else what am I trying to say this is why schisms have come because we've lost the vision as a people as a group seemingly we we've lost you say how can you be Samoan and say that look around us everywhere you go everywhere you see people are into themselves they have no concern for that guy walking down the street I just found out that his baby is addicted to some kind of painkiller or some kind of a thing or his wife's about to leave you more some kind of a thing he's involved in and you walking around with that Jesus in your heart holding the very answer to the very questions they're holding and yet we put our nose in the air and keep stepping on and then it comes sat down in the church house hypocritically and say well we love God with all of our hearts Jesus made his reputation with Sinners folks and we should be willing you say what are you saying brother Ben we should be willing this is what I'm telling you listen to me carefully we should be willing to Humble ourselves to help anybody within our spirit of influence I've seen a time in churches where people of different color wouldn't even shake hands sure some man said about a sister one time she's real exuberant talked a lot and was really chatty the guy got away from her and he looked at me and he said boy that woman needs to learn some submission I knew this family very well fact of the matter is she might have been a chatty Kathy but when old buddy said we're going to do it this way she said yes sir and how high should I jump she's completely surrendered to her husband in every way personality is not a sign of not being surrendered hello somebody having a bride exuberant demonstrative personality is not a sign that you're not surrendered people have treated folks that have been really wild and exuberant and talkative and what more almost like boy you need to get humbled down they think humility is being dead quiet never say in a word and being passive and letting everybody beat on you all the time they think a humble person walks around Walmart with their Bible in their arms saying amen praise the Lord God bless you it's manufactured humility real humility is being able to demonstrate to anybody in any circumstances any time or any spot of life that what God Said is true and I'm willing to obey it and help you understand how it fits together amen are we together now sure but we create these things in the churches yeah I know white men have been prejudiced but there have been a lot of prejudice people on the other side too it's easy for uh you know people that have got control of a place to do certain things I was in a a camp meeting number of years ago and I won't dare call this brother's name I love him he's my buddy he calls me big brother now but I'm the only white guy in 5 000 people and he's laying it on about the Americans how awful the Americans are I'm going to tell you right now these Americans aren't going to deceive us I'm the only American in the place laughs but listen I know these things make people uncomfortable but you shouldn't be uncomfortable what we should be is we should be honest with ourselves and say you know Lord that is the nature of the world to pick at issues like that and create things like that we should be subject one to another amen do you agree with that I think it's true as well so she closed herself in humility all right now let's move on to something else same idea but sometimes leaders preachers like myself can get themselves so high above the people some fellow ask a question or ask some kind of thing have you oh you just squared them shoulders back and say how dare you question me what does it cause it's caused people to look at preachers as dictators not servants dictators are not God's way of Leading the People God never sent a dictator to no place in any way shape form or fashion never in the world has God ever ordained a dictator to leave the church Real Men of God are servants to you they humble themselves to your needs aha unless of course you don't think that you know maybe that time that you made that phone call and brother Jesse happened to answer or brother so and so happened to answer and he was so sweet with you and so kind and took an hour with you and you just kept going with another conversation and kept going and kept going and what you didn't know was that the family was standing with a picnic basket and things ready to go out when you called them but what does he do he humbles himself his family has to Humble themselves to be servants to the people and let me tell you all something and I don't I I'd say this about digestive about any family being a preacher's kid is a hard job because you gotta you live in a fishbowl and it's tough you have to live by a standard of living sometimes my kids sometimes get so aggravated to me about things little tiny things that ain't no big deal and quite honestly it wouldn't even be sinful but I said if you do that people are going to judge me as a minister based on that one thing out there and we don't want to cost cast stumbling blocks and cause somebody to lose their influence or their feeling toward the ministry we've got to be careful about things sometimes even more so careful than other people but if the church is surrendered to the pastor and the pastor surrendered to the church you know what president said here if they're happy and he's happy God is happy I like that amen but we can't come to the place of such exaltation you know in churches I've said this to you before but we have Patriarchs and matriarchs our churches are made up of a lot of these kind of people and you know you take somebody that was in a lot of brother Rams meetings or they were somebody that you know uh uh you know I I got a piece of brother Brown's suitcase or his sleeping bag or I was in the seals when they come in and you know or something like that people almost look at that individual as being the old sage of wisdom that knows all the answers but look at what Paul said but when someone Young comes along he said don't despise their youth being subject one to another now this is important for us because you know it's older people we don't like to listen to the younger one we don't you might as well say hey man I can't this way it's true we all we think we know everything some young kid come say something a little certain things you stupid kid get out of my face twice as well I got food in the refrigerator older and you get out of here but who was it that Jesus used to feed five thousand a little boy another city playing hooky from school and had his lunch box with him Paul tells Timothy be thou an example this word example in the Greek means to make a stroke or a blow or an impression so in other words don't just say it but be an example in word indeed in Doctrine and spirit and in life Hallelujah what are you talking about brother Ben I'm talking about a mighty Army of God that you can't put a Schism between this is the kind of body that cannot be defeated Hallelujah this is the kind of army that cannot be overcome in this state there's such love there they are absolutely undefeatable and unconquerable that's why Satan could not defeat that early church they were bound together they had all things in common [Applause] praise God all right you ready with your Bibles let's go Second Chronicles 34 27. do they read out loud do you read you do good all right you're the first one that looked at me so you're going to read Second Chronicles 34 27. I'll give you a hint it's in the Old Testament amen now why sister is finding it there listen this brother said the first thing you've got to do is surrender yourself entirely to Christ surrender your mind to his word listen these words Lord I won't act upon my own feelings or my own thoughts oh my God if I could get that drove to you as a revelation tonight I'd solved 99 of our problems in life I will not act upon how I feel I will not act upon how I think Glory I'll just wait on you tell me the answer for the next step Hallelujah and if I can have that kind of submission and patience how could I lose when I'm waiting on the one that is the Conqueror of all things hey man what's now second Chronicles 34 27 got it baby nice and loud good job good reading nice reading that's good reading good job I bet you do good in school don't you I want you to notice this that that pause your mind a moment and go back and catch some of this here okay number one their heart was tender you don't you don't get it do you you don't fully understand it let me break it down to you unless your heart is this you'll never get any of this other you know what some people don't get any further with God than they are because their heart isn't tender anymore they've let life they've let circumstances they've let trials tribulations huh they let all of that Harden them to where they don't even have faith to believe that God could do anything for him anymore we must keep our hearts tender before the Lord how do I keep myself tender before God I keep myself in a constant state of needing him never thank myself to be self-sufficient or that I can do it on my own keep myself in a place God I need you it won't be accomplished amen amen right right he said thou let us humble thyself you heard the words you rinse your clothes all right the Jews now when they would humble themselves it was a common tradition for a Jew to grab their beard if they're a man pluck it out take their clothes and rip them like this to get down on the ground grab the dirt and rub dirt on their face and they would get into what they would call The Wailing spawn they'd rot back and forth like that this was their way of showing God that they were trying to Humble themselves before him you know we have a similar custom deny ourselves the pleasures of Flesh sometimes often the way we dress and talk and walk things we say no to it shows God and on very much the same way as them Jews showed it that we're humbling ourselves before the Lord when a sister wears an appropriate dress and a brother has the appropriate conversation sees him with assault and the grace of God in his mouth and so forth like that it shows humility to God humility isn't shown by people walking around going oh now brother now sister I just you putting that on because you're trying to prove something to somebody you want to prove something you prove it in the way that you're surrendered to Jesus Christ surrender to truth surrender to the word you don't have to put it on just do the action of being surrendered and watch and see if humility don't follow it Walks Like A Duck talks like a duck it ain't gonna be a chicken two plus two is still four and every mathematical science of the world and if you allow yourself to be surrendered to Christ humility will be the product of what you get imagine that all right Psalm 10 17 who's next you yeah you looked right at me you want this one all right Psalm 10 17. it's all right brother Jesse picking on me all right Psalm 10 17. you got it you got it go how about that not only another great reader but another great scripture do you want God to hear your desire do you how does it happen the desire of the humble everybody's got desires folks but God don't hear every desire that comes across his desk he's looking for those that are willing to be humble humble means if I ask God for something and he says no I'm willing to say okay you know what's best for me that's true humility you mean Lord you're going to make that decision as I said this morning he don't consult us it's fine but if I'm humble whatever he chooses I'm willing to go through that if it be that way right Proverbs 16 19. who else who will my next victim I mean my next reader you want to do it babe both their hands are up on it you won't read all right Proverbs 16 19. if you need help in your book that's all right Mama got it yeah good yeah that's all right take your time I'm gonna preach four hours anyway so they got plenty of time to worry about Proverbs 16 19. good job baby dog good good reading nice job nice job do you know what spoil means what spoilers it's rich people you know the Bible said better it is to be of a humble spirit with low people the poor disenfranchised the lower crust than it is to have so much that you can divide what you got with proud you know what that looks like don't you when people divide with the suppose you know how them big guys they get together well we went to Switzerland this year where did you go we went to Taco Bell bragging rights for everything they do I'm not saying you can't talk about trip or something but I mean this bragging thing of we got this and we got that when you see that kind of stuff like that somebody walk around bragging on their chest stuck out how much money they spend how much they bought and what they've done that now had a woman many years ago as a pastor's wife she sat at the table and flashed her phone back and forth like that yeah it's fourteen hundred dollars this phone right here it wouldn't have been so bad except for the preacher only put 180 in the offer proud God hates a proud look Proverbs 29 23 who's next all right you got you got it look it up Proverbs 29 23. these are some good scriptures now these are good to keep notes on remember Proverbs 29 and then 23. I don't do 23 and 29 and you'll get the wrong scripture be backers 29 23. I'm just filling in time while they find their place Proverbs 29 23. you got it I pulled the humble and spirit right good job good job kiddo so a man's Pride will bring him where who wants to be there unless he wants his name singing about your achy breaky heart or if I hadn't Friends in Low Places Brooks one at Garth Brooks Ron Brooks we got a better Brooks than that Bruce unless you've got that attitude of well I like I like hanging with the you know but a man's Pride in other words we'll bring him to the ghetto it'll take him to a place of such low Place see this is one reason well Jesse when we see this prideful stuff going on around the churches and things like that it's one reason why in some ways just let it go because eventually its Folly will be made manifest sometimes you got to take a stand speak out against things and praise God for everyone that does it every man of God that stands for principles and instructs other believers of how to think and what the word teaches but many times pride in somebody's heart like that all you got to do is give him time Oh Brother The Homer long Glory down in Alabama is a given time baby given time and that's right give them some time and you'll find out their pride will do what go before their fall but honor shall uphold The Humbling spirit so if you're humble in spirit obedient to God honor will always follow your life but see see that's easy to say a man to except for you're not attaching that to the fact that you don't feel like you come from a place of honor you think of your background Mommy and Daddy and cousin aunt and uncle and whatever and you look at that and you don't feel like that's an honorable place but it doesn't matter you don't have to come from royalty for honor to come to your doorstep well right all you got to do is be humble and God will bring honor right to your foot can we go a little bit further all right Isaiah 57 15. 57-15 whose name bigger kids can read too can that little one read no who else you'll have to put your arm up if you're trying to motion me you have it how about this before we let you read anybody else that didn't get to read one or read anybody put your hand up if you do or not we'll give it to say do you want to try to read no were you telling her just now were you reporting don't let him ask me I don't want to do it okay anybody else you want to try no yeah you do you want to try can she do it no she's not ready yet okay all right all right says looks like it's all you you ready Isaiah 57 15. a couple more scriptures we'll quit this has been good for me though I've enjoyed this this kind of preaching helps me helps me keep my focus don't you think so kind of brings you back down and think about things rethink really Isaiah 57 15 got it contrite is that word comes right you know what contrite means means to be um what's a good explanation there Roger Majestic contract hey it's a beautiful way to put this they always ask I always ask a a school teacher how to handle those things like that right so in other words this is a Dandy this is beauty woman this is this God says I'm holy I'm the lofty one I dwell in a high and holy place but look here with him that is of a broken and humble spirit God help me say this right God shares his eternity his kingdom with the humble and the broken he don't share his riches his glory his power with those that are so prideful that if it was a rain it'd drowned him I got their nose stuck up near so high he shares himself you know what that does it gives me and you a chance to serve him in the best way we can amen yes sir glory to God all right just a little further James 4. we're going to read two verses there's six and ten you know these so well you probably could almost quote them James 4. six and two this is a very beautiful passage of scripture both these verses are just just gorgeous I love them James 4 6 and 10 on who we got you ready all right that big Smith smile of yours Ain't No Way in the world I could have missed that I know he's right as a son come on yeah and I dropped down to verse 10 read 10 for me amen beautiful and see to the humble he doesn't just give you Grace did you get that he gives you more grace so if you humble yourself in the Lord that he'll lift you up but he'll give you the even more grace so whatever Grace you think you need whatever Grace you think you need it he'll turn around and give you even more than what you thought you did in other words it's like a little bitty tiny fish standing in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and saying I drink all this water up in a week's time no way in the world could that little fishy ever exhaust the grace that's been given to it Hallelujah and so is it with the humble and those that learn how to surrender God just keeps pouring it on them you ever see people that are so blessed it's almost sickening when you gonna have troubles down your way you just don't know that guy that girl she got troubles they got troubles but they're just getting that much humbler that much humbler and God just keeps pouring it on that you don't even see the other stuff in the background oh that's the way I want to live right there amen live to such a level that God can just keep parting on me till people do it we say do you ever get sad do you ever have a problem it just happens to be that my blessings are a whole lot bigger than these curses That You Don't See I love that humble yourself in the sight of the Lord that means he's seeing me you have to have eyes to have sight and if I'm in his sight and he sees me thank now he sees all of me he sees the good he sees the bad he sees the indifferent he sees the parts of me that are not so shiny and Fabulous and yet if I stay humble no matter what part of me he sees he'll never hold it against me it'll never meet me at judgment he'll just keep pouring Grace on me to overcome overcome repent be forgiven get Mercy get Grace overcome fight win the battle it'll just keep coming now whether you realize it or not we've just put together the formula for a true Victorious Life you know that doesn't it so if you walk out of here tonight saying I just can't get no Victory I don't know what to do I'll just give you the answer to it and so do these kids all of us reading humility surrender yourself listen to this we'll bring it too close the prophet said like this and I I this question always stands out to me he said whether it's a man or woman he couldn't tell but the question is brother Branham I just can't give over completely to Jesus have I an evil spirit he said you can't surrender to Jesus he said I don't know whether you're a man or woman but he said what's the matter he said if you're a woman don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife surrender all that you are tell us the way he puts us little lady said you were virtuous and follow your life to stay virtuous he said but then you found somebody a man that you love you were his completely and the thing that you'd fought against all your life try to live clean clear virtuous now you surrender every bit of that to one man you put yourself completely in his hands you're his all that you stood for in decency moral and everything like that you turn it and surrendered over to this man why can't you do the same thing for Jesus I don't think you're possessed of an evil spirit but I think an evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts to make you think you cannot surrender I'm closing here this is a lot of the problem with folks that get in their mind that somehow they can't surrender you know what it is it's not that you can't you were made and created and born with the ability to surrender to God but Satan's scheme is to try to make you think that you can't do it and if he keeps you thinking that it's impossible he that liar knows you'll never do it but if you ever just kick him in the face one time and say would you please shut up close your mouth don't say another word to me because I heard God's prophets say tonight brother Branham that I have the ability to surrender to God how do you know because you want to that's big evidence that you've got something you can surrender with if you want to that says everything about you but if you can't if you can't surrender it's not that you can't is that the devil tries to make you believe it's impossible but it's not with man things are possible but with God all things are possible stand with me praise the Lord let's say buddy praise His holy name praise His holy name amen

the Lord [Music] Music Factory [Music] dancing Mississippi of my plan [Music] foreign [Music] what an absolute completely totally wonderful privilege it is to be able to do that folks may not get around like that I've lost count of the times I've run into somebody in this message that won't do that right there stubborn hard-headed got everything figured out going to do their own way thank you breach until I almost fall in the floor scream holiday I'd climb up on the roof and carry on like a monkey if I thought I'd get their attention and get a new song about stood on my head almost try to get himself a hard head stubborn defiant you know what it is God has to give you that and if you've got that in your heart no matter how old you are no matter how long we've been around if you've got that feeling that Ministry of surrender as a wife as a Ministries if you've got that in you just forget about all your other problems and issues and all that and put that aside you ought to be the happiest person ever loves you man because I'm telling you not everybody has that I'm glad that Jesus put that in my heart many years ago and I pray if you let me stay straight that he never lets that leave me alone I may get discouraged upset I may get frustrated by all kinds of things you know life happens get your aggravated life get you down life gets you but God please don't ever let me become so discouraged or don't ever let me lose sight of what's really true in the word that I lose that feeling want to be completely surrendered to Jesus Christ you don't know this guy probably but years ago there was a preacher he's a message preacher he's just about dead and his weight is up and up up in 98 99 years old something like that and he used to run big tent revivals and he said brother NORAD you know 10 preachers had them rough voice brother no rod yeah he said I used to climb up to 10 posts and preach on the top I'm just trying to get their attention he said you know what I found out I said what is it brother he said if God don't put it in their heart no matter the demonstration no matter wildness or craziness and then nothing you can do let's go put it in there like for example you get done with a sermon like this today go home maybe get get in your car and start yelling at your youngins straighten up yell at the wife of the husband you heard the preacher tonight don't matter what you say to them no matter who's you're saying it to if God don't put this in you it ain't never going to be there so what is my advice if you look in your heart tonight and you see that ain't there you've heard the word which gives you an opportunity to say God put that in me put that in me because if I can handle to be surrender I know you'll always lead me you deserve the glory amen you deserve the glory and the honor I lift my hands in worship and to praise your holiness yeah [Music] God bless you folks I love you yeah [Music] you know [Music] if the rain [Music] if
