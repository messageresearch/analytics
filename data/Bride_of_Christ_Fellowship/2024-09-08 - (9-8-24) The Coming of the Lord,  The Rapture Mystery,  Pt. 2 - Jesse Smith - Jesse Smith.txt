TRANSCRIPT
========================================
taught you know outside the message too much where uh it's actually called a mystery this whole topic is a mystery and a lot of people uh don't know that but how many thankful to know it praise God how many glad you had a special night when you came face to face with eternal life very thankful Hallelujah so 1 Corinthians 15:51 so we see the mystery the mystery is in the body change Hallelujah and it happens in a moment and a twinkling of the eye praise God so this is uh I hope this to be the sermon where I can kind of look at that uh recently I told you about Tucker Carlson and uh John Rich you know talking about the Rapture and so I hope this is the sermon where I could address that you know it just it just shocked me I just I was like wow they're talking about my Bible the Scofield bible so I just thought I'd like to preach that today so if you remember Wednesday night I was preaching on that uh sermon from 1958 the sudden secret going way of the church right so I'm going to pause I'm going take a break from that and we're going to go to this mysterious element of the Rapture the Rapture mystery 1 Corinthians 15:51 if you have it say Amen all right so let's read uh 51 and 52 that'll give you some good reading there I love to hear the Saints read the word of God hallelujah so let's read this starts with behold let's start this on three ready 1 2 3 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God you can raise your hand or in your heart just pray with me here by God's grace father God we're thankful Lord for another opportunity to be in your house Lord God we're so thankful that eternal life has come to us Lord Lord you told your disciples you did not search after me I came searching for you Lord God hallelujah so Lord thank you Lord for each one of us Lord You've chased us down lord God you've brought us unto your glorious light and we want to say thank you Lord not in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be believing the Bible in the way that I am today Lord God not in my wildest dreams so that song is such a reality we thank you for that Lord God thank you that your Bible is alive Lord It's a Living Word of God it's sharper than any double-edged sword Discerning between the thoughts and intents of the heart and the spirit Lord God so we're thankful for the Living Word Lord God just let the Living Word preach now Lord you chose the foolishness of preaching to save them that would believe Lord God so just anoint me anoint your people to receive it Lord God me to receive it as well and father we'll be happy when we leave this place may you accomplish all that you want to accomplish today Father we'll give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so okay I have a few slides here H I'd like to show you know not every Sunday do I uh you know share slides but kind of worked out you know today I'd like to just show a few slides here by the grace of the Lord I don't know will that work okay that worked out good all right praise the Lord I'm going to be referencing you know some of the things I wrote uh in my book because I have a whole chapter on um The Rapture it was easier just to read out of it rather than you know copy and paste it all that because I've already written on it by God's grace so let's look at part two here the coming of the Lord uh the Rapture mystery so we started out with our text you know seeing how the Bible literally calls it a mystery uh there's 12 topics where the Bible calls them mysteries in the New Testament praise God this is one of them amen it's the uh mystery of how we're all changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and it's not the whole world is the Believers who are filled with the spirit of God hallelujah those are the ones that will be made ready Hallelujah uh for the Rapture going out to meet Jesus Hallelujah so uh it's called a mystery as we said uh it's one of the the 12 um I think it would be good to see you know that that that some people believe all Christians will go in the Rapture but that's not exactly right uh because they they they fail to see other scriptures there's two types of Christians there's wise Christians who are full of the Holy Ghost full of oil and there's foolish Christians who run out of oil so they're not full of the Holy Ghost now which one do you want to be praise God you have the choice today praise God you can be filled with the spirit with your lamps trimmed and clear or uh people will be uh will fail to make the preparations but now is the time to prepare Hallelujah as long as we've got breath in our lungs and as long as Jesus isn't here yet we've got time to prepare Hallelujah we got time to get the oil Hallelujah so just uh keep your spot there I'll just go back to Matthew 25 I don't have this on my slide so I'll just read it briefly because some people don't uh believe that uh but there's two types of Christians Jesus wouldn't lie to us Jesus is not trying to deceive us now was he speaking in mystery yes he was speaking a mystery because he called or he had Paul called this a mystery and Jesus is the one who revealed this to Paul Paul said in Galatians chapter 1 that he received the Revelation from Jesus Christ and thereby would preach these topics one of them included the Rapture praise God so Matthew 25 uh we'll start at verse one then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom so in those days I've seen this partially done down in South America in those days uh the bridegroom came at a certain time you know you had you you had the uh you had a bride of course and a groom and they they they never really knew when the wedding was going to take place they knew it was going to be a 7-Day celebration remember that from Jesus's Miracle the can of Galilee Miracle where he uh you know he turned the water to wine uh but in these days you know no one uh when the Jews separ uh celebrated this nobody knew when the bridegroom was coming you had to you had to be willing to to be ready you had to be willing to just drop everything in a moment's time and get ready for the celebration it was such a special moment it was one of the most special moments of every Community right every Jewish Community uh the Bible calls it the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom Hallelujah uh two Souls United as one it was one of the uh happiest days of the year Hallelujah outside of the you know regular feast days and everything well you had to be ready and so uh the Bible said uh that these 10 virgins went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish Hallelujah they that were foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them that means of course extra oil because their lamps had to have some oil in them in order to have light right if you've seen the old style uh oil lamps I there's oil in there but it quickly runs out like that story I told you from Brother Simon within a few hours his lamp his wife's lamp had already run out and the light had grown so dim and he's like what a reminder let's trim our lamps Hallelujah it doesn't last very long you know uh you you got to be you got to be in this for the Long Haul say it like that how many it for the long haul amen that's said if he comes in my lifetime Hallelujah if he doesn't come in my lifetime hallelujah praise God I'm going to be I'll be ready as long as I'm alive I want to be ready for his coming hallelujah amen but see he says it plainly you know uh so some of now virgin means of course no intercourse with the world this is a physical uh condition but it's speaking of a spiritual condition because Paul said in 2 Corinthians uh 11 uh he said that I've I've uh I I prepared you as a Chase virgin to Christ I've I've preached the gospel you've repented and now you're a chased virgin to Christ so other words God wipes away all your immorality and you're pure before God when you get saved Hallelujah so so just getting saved makes you a virgin spiritually in God's eyes hallelujah amen you're free you're forgiven all your past amen what a loving God Amen to forgive all of our past and give us a hope for the future hallelujah amen in his eyes it's it's like we never done it amen we he's washed it away and the Bible said he throws in the sea of forgetfulness praise God hallelujah and the devil tries to bring it back but just say Satan get behind me Hallelujah you're an offense under God you're a liar you're a bluff I only believe the word of God hallelujah we have to tell the devil that he's a liar amen and say get behind me Satan Hallelujah but see the oil took I'm sorry the wise took the extra oil and we're not going to read it but Zechariah 4 says not by might not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord and that spirit is represented by oil oil uh that that feeds into the olive trees right and gives them light uh Hagi and Zechariah are the uh are the representations there in Zechariah Chapter 4 Hallelujah verse 5 while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept so this was this was part of common life you know they'd say it's time for a wedding but then the bridegroom wouldn't come what they're testing Your Allegiance right it's a test of Your Allegiance it's a it's a test of your preparation Hallelujah it was in that day and it is in this day amen hallelujah naturally even in the natural those Jewish families they wanted the people ready to be able to go at any time it showed a respect it showed a reverence for the family Hallelujah it truly did amen you can see it here so they wait so long they start falling asleep because it's a Midnight Cry went out at midnight amen hallelujah now when I saw it was it was a it wasn't a Midnight Cry so it was on a Sunday it was after church I think I just preached on a Sunday morning it was at the church of the firstborn there in Guyana okay uh but this was there was actually opposite in South America in South America the bridegroom sat right at the pulpit they had two chairs right here and he sat there they had a crown on him and they had all like his best clothes and he looked he was all dressed up like Christ amen and he was sat there and they they said uh behold the bride coming so they actually switched it there and so we sat there and it's it's hot it's like 9500 degrees I sat there waiting around for hours you know I stood for a little bit and I sat down for a little bit I stood for a little bit all of a sudden out of nowhere you hear a honk honk honk honk honk and there's the bride with all of her uh bridesmaids in this van and they got all the they got all the bells on the car and they're driving him and then they start the wedding ceremony so that that's how I saw it amen but the actually the opposite is true praise God right Hallelujah Jesus comes back to us he comes back to meet us in the air hallelujah hallelujah amen but it was a nice it was a nice uh kind of prefigure of this of of how you just have to be ready praise God and think about that God is going to have people ready all around the world for the Rapture think about that they're all going to be in one mind Glory I know what mind it is it's the mind of Christ amen it's not the mind of the Republicans or the Democrats it's not it's not their mind it's the mind of Jesus Christ amen they're going to be so in tune with Christ that they're ready to go in the Rapture amen around the world the Holy Spirit Will anoint people to believe as Jesus said whether they're sleeping whether they're working in the field whether they're working on the bread you know at the Mill grinding wherever they are they're going to be ready because the love of God is in their soul the love of God is shed abroad within them by the grace of God hallelujah amen man verse five they fall asleep verse six at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him then all those virgins arose and and trimmed their lamps they had to trim their lamps cuz lamps were almost going out Hallelujah so they trim it and then of course the wise realize oh thank God we've got enough oil but the foolish realized we didn't bring any extra oil now what does this represent it represents there's three parts to every person you have your body you have your mind and your soul that's what it represents Paul says that in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 everybody has three parts so see the wise version had extra oil they just didn't have the Holy Ghost they just didn't feel the Holy Ghost on their body they just didn't think about the Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost sealed in their soul praise God right but the foolish virgin didn't they might have had it on their body and in their mind but they weren't born again in the soul that was the whole purpose of the New Testament the New Testament was Jesus said I'm going to give you rest for your not your body not your mind he said in Matthew 11 I'm going to give you rest for your soul Hallelujah that was the purpose of the New Testament Hallelujah was to give people the Holy Ghost in their soul and then Paul calls it Christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah it's a mystery that's another mystery amen along with the Rapture praise God is Christ in the soul of man or woman by the grace of God hallelujah now verse eight the foolish said unto wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answered saying not so I can't I can't give you the Holy Ghost only Jesus gives the Holy Ghost amen Jesus said John said it John said there's one one coming after me John the Baptist there's one coming after me mightier than me and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire John said I can baptize you in water even John had the Holy Ghost the Bible said he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb that was in his Spirit right he said but there's one coming after you who after me who's going to give you the holy ghost in a way I can't give it that's the Son of God that's the Messiah that's Jesus Christ that's God in flesh Hallelujah God's going to give you the holy ghost in your soul Hallelujah he's migher than me amen Jesus is the mighty one he's the Holy One amen he's God in flesh amen the almighty God hallelujah amen no man see no man can give you the Holy Ghost don't care what anybody says now God might direct that man or woman to pray for you and and they'll know they'll have a revelation you're going to get it you know but they're not the ones who gave it John said only Jesus can give it amen hallelujah and they'll say like this then you'll spend the rest of your life making sure that that was a genuine experience Hallelujah is that right Church you'll get because what happened after Jesus got the Holy Ghost what' the Holy Ghost do go out in the wilderness it's time for a test because God wanted to make sure that Holy Ghost you got was the real deal and if it's the real deal it will overcome the Gates of Hell amen it'll overcome the high school trials amen it'll overcome the the workers the the adult workers trials amen children's trials it'll help you in the schools this Holy Ghost is everpresent he never leaves he never forsakes he's an everpresent help in time of trouble amen yes amen he said it's better that I leave because then I'll send the Comfort comforter and he'll be with you even in you to the end of the age amen we don't need to Hope and say I wish Jesus body was here you've got the Holy Ghost now amen the Holy Ghost I'll say is more than a match for Satan I'm going to say it again the the Holy Ghost is more than a match for your trials Satan cannot he can't even stand in the presence of Christ hallelujah we're more than conquerors amen we're uh the Bible said uh the power of God is mighty for pulling down strongholds amen we have a weapon that can tear down every chain every gate every obstacle every wall every trial God is more than able we just got to yield to God Amen he does all things in his perfect time Hallelujah he works at the pace of perfection that's right see so verse 8 and9 you know you can't give the Holy Ghost to somebody you can't prepare them for the Rapture you can only prepare yourself for the Rapture you can guide others as a father as a pastor I can guide people but I can't give it myself God's Got to Give It Hallelujah verse 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut so see not every Christian not every virgin as a Christian makes the Rapture only those who prepared oil go in the Rapture right and people say oh no that's just a parable just a parable I'm sorry excuse me red letter words are just words no those are words from God Almighty amen because you can see the two kinds of Believers all down through the Bible Hallelujah right you can see it you had Enoch and Noah Enoch lived a higher life than Noah praise God right Abraham and lot Abraham was totally out of Sodom lot kind of hung around there too long and the Bible said lot was scarcely saved from that but Abraham was totally out of it amen you can see it all down through the whole Bible amen it's just laying right there you have David he was a man after God's Own Heart then you had Saul King Saul who barely got saved right at the end he got saved because he stopped chasing David and he went out to fight the Lord's battles he repented of his sins and then David sang about him said he was a mighty like a lion during his lifetime and yet he spent most of his adulthood chasing down David trying to kill him but how did the Holy Spirit anoint David the Holy Spirit anointed David to show that his grace was sufficient even for Saul hallelujah amen God's grace is sufficient even for the thief at the cross in his last dying hours where he started off making fun of Jesus saying save us but within a few hours the Holy Spirit had changed his heart and they said Jesus Remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus gave that great consolation not tomorrow today you'll be with me in Paradise amen what a consolation what an expression of Grace that's our savior he's mighty to save he's King Jesus amen let me tell you he's the same yesterday today and forever he can say today that way too Hallelujah that's right so see only those that were ready with extra oil an extra dose of oil an extra portion of oil go into the marriage the marriage is the rapture of course afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us and he answered said to the and said verily I say to you I know you not so they're they're virgins but he doesn't know them intimately like he should know us remember Paul said we got to know him in the power of his resurrection everybody say and and see most people just want to know him in the power show me Miracles show me Miracles but he said I got to know him also in the fellowship of his sufferings that's what most of us don't want to do you you don't to say Amen I'll say amen for you amen right we don't like to suffer for God but we have to learn how to suffer for God he said I want to know him in both ways in the power the glory but I also want to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings so I can be conformed to be like him amen Paul said you only Reign if you overcome suffering now I'm paraphrasing that that's that's not the exact quote from the King James but I'm paraphrasing I taught on it uh not too long long ago now he says that verse 13 watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh see God is keeping this a secret and remember God's even keeping a secret from Jesus Jesus doesn't even know that's in uh since you're Matthew 25 I just look geography like brother said g uh ge geographically I just look across the page Matthew 24:36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man not the angels of heaven but the father only and then in Mark 13 He says the son doesn't even know it only the father Hallelujah this is such a mystery church we got to be watching and praying we got to be watching and calling on God Hallelujah Lord help me to be ready Lord fill me with your power fill me with your spirit help me to be ready for your coming I don't want to miss it Hallelujah Glory now okay now that's the introduction that wasn't even in my notes amen so he says now of course it's in my heart amen it's written on the fleshly table my heart the mystery the Rapture is called a mystery in 1 Corinthians 15:51 now the mysterious part he says it's the moment of the change it's at the unknown day and hour of his coming now for the Deep teaching you remember this the unknown day and hour is the reality form of the seventh seal right because when the seventh seal breaks in a literal reality form the Bible said Heaven is silent There's No Angel singing brother there's no there's no angel Ministry nothing all of Heaven is quiet because Jesus left heaven and he's coming down to earth to meet us in the air amen hallelujah so that's the mystery behind the seven seal now do we have the revelation of it yes it's the unknown day and hour there's no really there's really no symbol to it other than the conditions of Heaven there's no symbols for it like a horse rider or or balances or nothing like that in the first five SEALS or six seals rather there's there there's no symbol to it really that's why it's mysterious that's why it's called a mystery now most of you know this but if you don't you'll be blessed go to Isaiah 25 because when Paul Paul when he says uh death is swallowed up he's actually quoting an Old Testament verse so I thought I'd bring this out here just aesh and looking for more revelation of the Holy Spirit how many believe God's going to give us more Revelation as we approach the Rapture God always does that there it's always a progressive revelation right in the Garden of Eden for th000 years before Jesus God gave their first Messiah prophecy right Thou shalt bruise his head and thou shalt bruise his heel that's the first prophecy of Jesus 4,000 years but you fast forward Isaiah started prophesying said a virgin shall conceive Hallelujah Micah said he'll be born in Bethlehem amen and so it was Progressive as you got closer to the first coming you understood more about the coming as we approach the second coming we should understand more about it Hallelujah that's what I'm trusting in amen because again he's the same yesterday today and forever now you're there in Isaiah 25 but I'm going to read uh 1 Corinthians 15 again verse 54 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory so Paul says Jesus showed me that Isaiah 25:8 is the body change that's the mystery of the Rapture hallelujah amen is't that beautiful if you just would have read Austin before you knew about the Rapture Jose if before you knew about the Rapture if you just would have read Isaiah 25 would you have thought oh that's the Rapture of the New Testament Church you would never thought that because it's hidden because it's a mystery glory amen and the Mysteries are for the people of God hallelujah they're to us and our children that we might do all the laws of the Lord amen not legalism now but it's the law of the Holy Spirit now Romans chapter 8 is plain on that we live by the law of the Holy Spirit not by the law of the the Jews hallelujah amen now I'm going to go back to Isaiah 25 in my Bible okay so I read that Paul cites this and just look around uh at at the cont context here look around at the context that's why you might remember I brought some of these things out especially the part about the wine okay now I'm going to start at verse one Lord Thou Art my God I will exalt thee I will praise thy name for thou Hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are faithfulness and Truth anything said yet about the Gentiles any Gentiles anybody see anything in there no was this originally written to Gentiles not that I can find but God hid the Rapture in this chapter and the Jews they still don't see it to this day and they're not going to see it right they're not going to see it God hid the Rapture for you and I the Gentiles in this chapter what a mighty God we serve amen verse two for thou Hast made of a city and heap of a defense City a ruin a palace of strangers to be no City it shall never be built therefore shall the strong people glorify Thee the city of the Terrible Nations shall fear thee for thou Hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy and is distress how many can say Amen to that as I told you we were on food stamps my whole life God was a strength to the poor hallelujah a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a CO of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low now verse six uh speaks of a mountain Hallelujah and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the leaves of fat things full of marrow of wines on the leaves well refined okay so the mountain of course if there's only one mountain it's got to be Jerusalem right either the natural Jerusalem or the New Jerusalem Hallelujah and what are they having they're having a feast so God takes down all the enemies God destroys all the enemies God fights all of our battles Hallelujah and then God will give a feast in his holy mountain verse 7 and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations so when God has his people gathered there there's feasting there's wine wine represents the stimulation or joy of the Holy Ghost and then God takes away this Veil off the nation's eyes verse eight now let's be honest we don't see the Gentiles really in here it's the mountain of the lord it's it's God's people it's spoken by Isaiah but verse eight is what you and I are trusting in with thus sayeth the Lord how many know the raptures thus sayith the Lord that's what I'm talking about we don't know when we don't have thus sayth Lord on that but we do know the Rapture is thus sayith the Lord amen because it's in the Bible in fact that's what brother r ends the Rapture sermon I listened to it yesterday uh in December 1965 that's what he ended on there's going to be a Rapture it's thus sayith the Lord most people don't think that most people think well Jesus will come back and then we I'll just have a brand new life again no there's lots of things that are going to happen there's lots of events that are in the scripture praise God he's got to come back first and snatch away his wife before he pours out destruction amen what man would let his wife go through all that destruction and the tribulation no man would do that and if we wouldn't do that if I would to do that to my wife then God won't do it to his wife hallelujah amen he's going to snatch her away Hallelujah like the Bible says so you and I our hope is in verse eight he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces Hallelujah is there anything you'll be crying about then Jesus will say let me wipe that away let's not cry anymore I'm the answer to all your questions amen I've got all the answers to everything you want to know about amen hallelujah because he's all knowing he knows all things Hallelujah he'll be able to take you know you'll be thinking about something and Jesus will be able to explain something where you stop crying oh praise the Lord it is finished amen hallelujah he knows what's right and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off the Earth for for the Lord has spoken it and it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our God ah this is our God this is who he is he loves us we have waited for him and he will save us this and this is the Lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation amen for in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest and Moab should be trotten down under him even as straw is trotten down for the dung Hill and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he that swimme spread forth his hands to swim he shall bring down their pride together with The Spoils of their hands and the Fortress of the high Fort of thy walls shall he bring down low lay low and bring to ground even to the dust if you didn't know 1 Corinthians 15 you and I would have no idea that's about us at least one verse Hallelujah at least one verse but we see in this that God breaks down every enemy in order to save in order to give his people the victory praise God right we can all see the one world uh government happening we can all see that with currency going digital anybody can see that anybody can see that with with covid you know uh wrecking the economy and all these things everybody can see that's what eventually it's going to get to it's in the Bible it's Revelation 13 we can all see that but God promises there's going to be a people that I'm going to help give them victory over this as the as the world uh rallies against Jesus Christ I'm going to give them Victory I'm going to let I'm gonna let life swallow up death in Victory Hallelujah am I'm gonna because because they're so swallowed up on my word I'm going to let uh their their their physical bodies be swallowed up in a new body praise God Amen that's right amen because you see man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God hallelujah and as we keep swallowing and enjoying the word of God and feasting on the word of God we become one with the word and because we eat the book Hallelujah the spirit of God will swallow us up as well Hallelujah how do I say it amen because we swallow the book life will swallow us up hallelujah it's a great promise Hallelujah and see that's what you can tell the devil devil you can't swallow me up because life's going to swallow me up I've got the promise he's like a lion seeking whom he may devour but you can say Satan you can't swallow me up God's already promised me he's swallowing me up Hallelujah ah glory amen hope somebody's being blessed today amen so see now the context I don't know which all those verses in here apply to the Rapture all I know is that verse eight applies because that's what Paul said but there could be some clues in here you know the wine that kind of reminds me of the former and latter rain right new wine and all these things kind of reminds me of that there I've used that before it's possible you know you have uh that could be the former latter rain in there uh the feast As We Gather into the Lord we're feasting with him uh this is our God you know verse 9 he saves us we're saved from the tribulation Hallelujah so there there's many verses that could apply to us but we need God to give us greater Revelation Hallelujah that's why we're here today amen now I just thought I would share this not every Rapture is the same did you know this I just thought this the Holy Spirit brought this to my memory today Elijah and Elisha and the sons of the prophets they knew the day of his Rapture ain't that something not every Rapture is the same Hallelujah but Jesus said you don't know the day or the hour Elijah was privileged to know it and all the the spiritual people around him knew it was the hour I'm sorry the day and he could say this day I'm being raptured now for us we'll never know that day Jesus said no man knows it but I say like this we can know the season of The Rapture amen because that's what Paul said the times and Seasons Brethren you don't have any need that I can write I I write that unto you we'll Rec ize the One World Government we'll recognize these things coming on we'll see it it will not take us surprise we're not groping around in darkness like Blind Mice or something like that our eyes are open we're the children of God God's turned on the light we see what's happening we'll be ready for the body change amen amen that's what the Bible says amen that's not what I say that's what the Bible says hallelujah so see every Rapture is slightly different now what we want to be is like Enoch we want to to be pleasing to the Lord because the Bible said Enoch was not for God took him because he had a testimony that he pleased God right so we want to find that type in the in the Rapture and we want to say Lord help me each day to live a pleasing life unto you that's how I'm going to get prepared for the Rapture that's how I'm going to be ready for the Rapture Hallelujah I feel like I got a good start here amen now I'm going to just lay this in here here's a mystery that I don't quite yet understand this is part of the mystery rather it's part of the mystery I don't quite understand uh here's what's needed for us and I'm sorry here's what's needed for me sorry my throat's getting a little dry it's about the last Trump because it confuses so many Christians which is understandable that's why this is called a mystery okay so Paul said it the Rapture the body change takes place at the last Trump how let me read that Hallelujah yes it's again verse 52 1 Corinthians 15:52 the Bible says in a moment in the twinkling of a eyee that just means like a a twinkle in the eye or like a blink of an eye so fast can't even time it at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed Hallelujah now the reason this confus confuses so many Christians which is understandable remember church God allows people to be uh confused because Jesus said I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent but reveal them unto babes such as would learn for even so it seemed good in your sight so see God only gives out Revelation to the people who are humble that become his children before him oh God help us to be humble amen am Jesus said he thank God God you hide these Revelations from the prideful people and that's why churches can't see it because they're prideful they trust in their money or their denomination or their attendance or whatever you know they trust in other things their status in life their bank accounts they trust in all those things rather than trusting in God hallelujah so God hides it from them see because they write up their their bylaws and their Creeds right that are unscriptural and they keep changing and they keep allowing more sin into the church that's the devil allowing more sin in the church God makes us more holy Satan makes us Unholy God will make us more holy praise God remember 2 Corinthians 7:1 uh Paul said examine yourselves he said and perfect Holiness in the fear of God see that's why denominations always miss the mark and they can be good for a season but a denomination will miss the mark because they don't perfect Holiness they actually allow more unholiness that's right church that's right I know we understand that Hallelujah but this is this is why it's confusing and I'll have a few visuals here in just a moment 1 Corinthians 15:52 calls it a last Trump and I believe 1 Thessalonians 4 also calls it the last Trump okay no it just calls it the Trump of God so I'm reading 1 Thessalonians 4 uh 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first so this is the mysterious element of it it's because some people read last Trump and they think the seventh trumpet of Revelation 11 but that's not the right Trump Hallelujah there's a different Trump God has to finish uh God has to finish the Gentile age with a trump hallelujah it's the last Trump to the Gentiles cuz Romans 11 said he cuts off the Gentiles he's going to graph back in the Jews and then the Jews have trumpets Hallelujah any Bible reader should be familiar with that okay if you studied real deep and long Hallelujah sat in the presence of the Lord so see our last Trump for the Gentiles is different from the seventh Trump of Revelation 11:15 Hallelujah so this is a topic I need to study what I need to do I need to find the last Trump for the Feast of P Pentecost or the Feast of Weeks I got to find that in the scripture so brother Austin that's what I'm looking for you find it brother you let me know we're gonna I'm going to go digging for it here hopefully the next few weeks by God's grace now let me show you the calendar now I'm sorry you know it's okay that's actually pretty big okay I thought wouldn't be that big so remember Israel every year Israel has seven feasts right Passover unleavened bread first fruits these are all within three days in March or April they happen three days in a row okay but then 50 days after first fruits you have Pentecost which is also called The Feast of Weeks okay now this lasts for uh 3 months and then in the seventh month you have trumpets 10 days later's atonement I forget how many days I think it's seven days later they have Tabernacles okay now they they all had natural they all have natural meanings to the Jews and the natural meaning is down here like we're familiar with that how many you familiar with that raise your hand if you I preach this it's been a I guess it's been a while since I preached this but they all had they all had spiritual meanings so the Passover actually represented Jesus's death the unleavened represented Jesus taking all of our sin down to Hell right the Bible said he descended and preached to the spirits that were in prison and he got the keys of death and Hell praise God right he took care of all our sin and then the first fruits represents his resurrection 50 days later represents the Feast of Pentecost now this Feast has been going on for 2,000 years see now this website's uh yeah this I disagree here's where I disagree the trumpets I believe will will call Israel together because it's calling Israel together for what for the day of atonement that's what the Feast of trumpets was about they blow the trumpets and they'd gather for a day of mourning right and then 10 days later then all their sins will be forgiven Hallelujah with the the Two Goats remember the Two Goats the uh uh we went through that before in Leviticus the Two Goats it was the day of atonement but this is symbolic of the 144,000 Jews having all their sins forgiven because a fountain of the blood of Jesus Christ will be open in the House of David Hallelujah Zechariah tells us that amen and then they and then for seven days they sat in booths uh because it reminded them of when they come out of Egypt but for us you know we're not going to set up booths we're going to build houses for a thousand years glory to God Amen everybody see the everybody see the types and then this is the type and then this is the anti-type or fulfillment now what I'm looking for brothers if you read your Bibles here here I'm looking for I got to find a last Trump that ended the Feast of Weeks because remember there was barley Harvest and there was Fruit Harvest in the Feast of Weeks maybe I'll preach a series on that by God's grace okay now the Rapture is not the trumpets because it's calling Israel together for the Forgiveness of sins right the Rapture is not for the Forgiveness of sins we're already forgiven Saints I'm already forgiven how many y are already forgiven by God's grace amen the Bible said you already are you now are the sons of God hallelujah you're already forgiven Colossians 2 says he's already forgiven all your trespasses hallelujah amen you already are but this is calling Israel together to forgive all their sins because they rejected their Messiah right and they said let his blood be upon us and our children and so it has been Mercy Lord so that's just gives you a visual of what I'm looking for in the scripture I need to go study the uh Feast of Weeks brother William and feast of Pentecost I'm talking about in the Old Testament so I can try to find is there some trumpet that that brings to the end of the Harvest so is there some trumpet that gives you a harvest at the end of the Feast of Weeks how many know understand what I'm talking about okay hope it's not hope it's not over your heads I don't think so but it's been a while since I preached it now Church remember brother said some doctrines do not pertain to Salvation such as the coming of the Lord you know whether a person believes the raptures before or after the tribulation that doesn't mean they're not saved it's just they can't understand the mystery that's right right not everybody's going to understand all the Mysteries you get the Mysteries if you humble yourself that's what Jesus said you got to become like a child and then God will reveal the Mysteries to you Hallelujah and you also have to rec you have also have to recognize Revelation 10:7 when Jesus brings down the book and he gives it to the seventh angel which was a man and he and he finishes the mystery of God how many understand that he preaches the mystery of God then we eat the book and we prophesy again amen glory to God now brother bam said the serpen SE doesn't even pertain to Salvation I don't think I had time to put the quote I think I forgot to put the quote on here and of course believing if God's three persons or one person or two persons that doesn't save you or make you lost right now we believe God's one person God never says I'm three persons just because there's a father son holy ghost that Jesus baptism that doesn't mean there's three persons it just means God can manifest himself in as many ways as he wants because here's a study I showed I was reading this week Jesus the Bible said God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost well if there's three persons why does uh why does the second person he's already supposed to be God why does he need anointed by another person he's already God and the doctrine says they're already co-equal so their doctrines a lie amen and we don't believe lies amen what if you're already God if you're already the Eternal Son of God why do you need more of God you're already Eternal Son of God it don't make any sense it's a contradiction it's a lie God's not three persons God is one person amen he just changes his mask Hallelujah he just changes manifestation and remember on the day of Pentecost he broke up into 120 fires that don't mean God's 120 persons it just means you can't limit God God is the Holy One he's unlimited he's almighty God hallelujah amen he could have broke himself up into a million Flames it don't matter that don't limit God God said the Bible says uh the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one didn't say three persons it's three manifestations are one Hallelujah that's what the Bible said God was manifest in flesh Amen Hallelujah Jesus was a manifestation an appearing of God not a second person he's the physical image of the person of God hallelujah because God the Father cannot be seen has never been seen will never be seen we only see the father in The Son hallelujah amen hallelujah I just want to thank the Lord for letting me hear his word brother William never my wildest dreams that I ever think I'd preach something like this never I in my life wi dreams that I ever think I'd be a preacher anyways brother was talking about uh in 1963 brother was talking about uh does the bride get raptured before after the tribulation he says the the brother said the brother said well the bride's got to she's got to go through the tribulation to be purged and brother Braham disagreed he said I can't agree with him because I don't see it like that but it doesn't pertain to Salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord he sees the church has got to go through the tribulation period for purification but brother says I don't see that I say the blood of Jesus Christ has already purified the church amen and remember you can't throw out Matthew 25 we already read that there's a wedding going on and some virgins make it and some don't that's Jesus's words he's not lying to us he's telling us the truth we got to have more oil we got to have the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen oh thank the Lord amen see so then all those people really when when when they say that when they say all Christians go to the Rapture what they're doing is they're basically ripping Matthew 25 out of the Bible we don't need that that's not true that doesn't apply to us I'm sorry it applies all the word of God applies see I believe the church Church goes through the tribulation period the church organization so that that's what he means the foolish virgin but the bride the wise virgin does not would you choose a woman you had to purify before you married her see Christ's bride is chosen she's elected she is God's bride the Bride of Jesus Christ now this is a different one but he says I believe it'll be the same thing when Jesus comes again each man has him a chart well he's going to come riding on a white horse the other one said no he's coming on a white cloud he said what difference doesn't make as long as he's coming so see these people will argue they'll call you you're a devil you're a heretic you're all these things it don't even pertain to Salvation the question is have you confessed your sins have you for ask God to forgive you of all your sins and have you received salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ amen is your faith in your denomination or is your faith in the blood of Jesus Christ that's the question amen that's right that's right and then if you say you know my my salvation's in my mom's experience or my grandma or my granddad or my denomination if you say that then you are deceived Hallelujah then you're on your way to hell you this pertains to salvation Salvation is in the blood of Jesus Christ only not a man not a woman not a church Creed not a pope not a cardinal not an Archbishop salvation is by Jesus Christ Alone hallelujah amen that's right he said that's the main thing but they fall out on that that's why I can fellowship with a Catholic I can fellowship with a Baptist I can fellowship with a Pentecostal I can fellowship with all of them as long as we're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ but if somebody say well you got to pray to Mary to be saved well I said I say I'm sorry I don't believe that I can't have fellowship with you if you're going to say that you know with all the kindness in my heart right see but people will fall out on that one will start a group over here the other one over there just whether he's going to ride a white horse or White Cloud it does it doesn't make any difference just so he comes that's the main thing is to believe is coming Hallelujah now my precious brother now here's where brother R says it he says it with thus sayith the Lord because brother Braham was a prophet I heard a lot of back in 2020 I heard a lot of TV internet preachers say the Lord told me Trump's going to be president he's gonna have two terms in a row and they lied they lied in the name of the Lord they are false prophets but every time brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord it has come to pass we're still waiting on some but we're also still waiting on on Isaiah's prophecy about the Rapture amen hallelujah that was eight let's see 900 years before Christ so 2900 years ago almost 3,000 years we're still waiting on a prophet's prophecy to come to pass see God's people are patient Hallelujah in patience we possess our souls we're still waiting for Isaiah his word to come to pass he had something to come to pass but we're still waiting on some but we will wait on the Lord we'll renew our strength like the ego praise God amen amen glory said now my precious brother look how he calls trinitarians he said you're precious he didn't say you devil you devil possess trinitarian he didn't say that he disagreed With Love Christian love my precious brother I know this is on tape also now don't get excited I love his self-control let me say this with Godly love the hour has come I'm sorry the hour's approach where I can't hold still on these things no more it's too close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil because like I told you it contradicts itself it's a false Doctrine why does the second person need to know and the Bible Jesus said the father that dwelleth in me does the works but then the Bible said Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost you mean one person has two other persons inside of him brother what sense does that make huh one person had the Son of God had to get two other people to dwell in Him Sister beus does that make any sense to you no that must mean it's not true because it's not in the Bible either two persons have to anoint another person and then he's fully God and then he then he's anointed what what doesn't make any sense brother man says it's of the devil now look what who who who started this it was the Roman Catholic church now look at all their false doctrines they got now like I said praying to Mary saying you know brother William you and I went to all those churches remember years ago and they would hold up that wafer like it was and they say that wafer is the literal body of Jesus and they give out the cup and say this is the literal blood it's not just one or juice it's actually the blood that's a false that's a lie that's the devil telling you that that that bread doesn't turn into the body the Bible said and mass means a sacrifice they Chris mass or or in this case the Catholic mass it means Jesus is going to be sacrificed again right there but there's the Bible said he only dies one time amen he only dies one time so see the church at start of the Trinity they also have all these other false doctrines because if they don't correct one it's just going to lead to more mistakes it's like leaven you put a little leaven in it's going to impact the whole lump thank God for the unleavened lump of God's Church hallelujah hallelujah Paul Paul said get that Lev them out from among you that you can be a new lump Hallelujah brother said I say that thus sayith the Lord now that's a real prophet of God right there and remember the Trinity Church I don't know why I'm on this so much the Trinity wasn't even formulated till uh 200 years or so after John died the Bible writers didn't even write the Trinity that was all 200 some years after John died the last Apostle died but see they love that they worship that and I've been called a heretic because I don't believe in three persons well the Bible never called it three persons I'd rather believe the Bible than man because Jesus said let no man deceive you by any means and Satan only changed one word in the Bible to Eve he said Thou shalt not surely die and look at all the effects we got because of it now change in one word what about injecting uh two extra words three persons the Bible never said he's three persons look what it's done look where it come from it come from the Nan Council that was around 325 ad when the Catholic Church came in rulership the word Trinity is not in the Bible unless you have an amplified Bible I showed that to brother William yesterday Trinity that they put the word in the Amplified Bible don't you be reading Amplified bibles if I see some of you reading Amplified Bible and say can you please consider did you know there's a trinity in there I wouldn't read that version if I were you I don't think you would the word Trinity is not even mentioned entire book of the Bible and as far as three persons that's from Hell there's one God that's exactly right now do you say then do you believe that all those people are trinitarians are of hell no sir look at that see they can be saved even though they only even though they believe in three persons I believe they are Christians but the hours approaching brother when they're sincerely wrong see because remember we preach on the image of the Beast remember the mark of the beast it's going to be connected what's the mark in the forehead it's believing their false doctrines church we better stay awake hallu you I'm talking about naturally and spiritually we better stay awake that's going to be their calling card what aren't you a trinitarian don't you believe the early church fathers I don't believe the early church fathers unless it's the fathers who wrote the Bible which which early fathers you talking about I certainly going to follow Augustine after the things he said I'm going to follow the early church writers the authors of the New Testament praise God all right now I'm not GNA do this I might do this next time on Wednesday but I want you to see this okay uh the word caught up 1 Thessalonians 4:17 we which are alive and remain shall be caught up everybody say caught up ready CGH up here's the Greek word for caught up hard pod harpazo looks like harpazo that's the Greek word now this is used 13 times in the Bible the New Testament so I maybe I'll preach on that on Wednesday just so you can see it I want you to see it now this this helps prove the raptures before the tribulation period right because what does it mean Church These are different ways that authorized version will give you English words to try to understand it so caught up can mean catch up and can take by force not like oh can I please have that pretty pleased devil can I have the church no Jesus is going to come down and say give me my bride that's right amen I'm taking her because I bought her with my own blood Hallelujah sorry Lily I don't mean to scream in your face there she's sleeping sorry Lily bless your heart but Jesus come down and said I'm gonna snatch her up I'm gonna seize I'm going to carry her off by force before the tribulation I'm snatching her away like if I did this I'd say I'm snatching this I need this right now that's Jesus coming in the Rapture it's not like Devil pretty please devil uh pretty pleased devil can I have the bride he don't apologize to nobody hallelujah amen he's taking his bride cuz he bought her he paid for her he gave her extra oil praise God she's got the oil she's ready she heard the Midnight Cry he's taking her because she has made herself ready hallelujah oh my it means to seiz on claim for oneself eagerly see not a I'm going to apologize here uh denominations I'm GNA apologize Den nominations of the Catholic church can I have my bride sorry no it's no apology his wife made herself ready Revelation 19 to snatch out to snatch out or way so just in the very definition of caught up now we use the word rapture the word rapture is not in the King James vers version right but that's a that's a similar word in our language where oh a Rapture means to take away right or caught up in you're caught up into Glory right Rapture I'm raptured up oh I'm enjoying this and raptured feeling right it just means caught up you're in a higher Place higher realm and we don't we don't you know I don't have to call it the Rapture I don't have some I don't have some uh uh I don't have a claim on the word rapture I don't have to call it the Rapture I can call it the catching up I can call it the seizing I can call it whatever the Bible calls it amen but the thing is Jesus is taking her away he claims that church for himself that's what we need to find out today where's the church Jesus claims for himself Hallelujah where's the church who's in the word all the way and is constantly trying to get sin out of her midst and seeing the spirit of God move amongst her Hallelujah not a pretend but a real move of the Holy Ghost how you know it's a real move it'll line up with the word of God that's how you know glory to God now forgive me if I'm wearing you out I I want to go half an hour more I don't know we'll see here by God's grace yeah now I want to get to okay now everybody this should perk everybody up here now this is a recent attack on the pre-tribulation Rapture and I I mean it in the nicest way possible okay because these people they seem like good people now Tucker says he's always believed in God but he went to a fake church he said growing up now that that's his his words now John rich now he's a country singer he started off as a bad singer but now he sings good song good songs for country I don't listen to them I'm not going to start listening to them okay we got enough good musicians we in songs we don't need to listen to people that you wonder about okay but let me tell you him a little bit about him on and you can watch the whole thing it's a I listened to the whole thing on twice two speed you know or 1.75 something like that so his dad was so zealous for the word of God his dad had a scoffield Bible he went to Seminary and he uh he preached the pre-tribulation Rapture until recently I don't know maybe the last few years and so as a boy he saw his dad go to Marty Groth I think at 36 years in a row now I've never been to Marty Groth I don't plan on going because it's just it's an excuse to live in sin and debauchery it's a license for levious it's a licens to sin right but John rich said he saw his dad play Christian songs as the prey would go by and got spit on for 36 years he would be just covered in spit he said but every now and then he said maybe uh maybe one or two times people stop by and say why are you singing and getting spit on you know cuz he's singing about Jesus and all these people are living in sin they don't want to hear Jesus they're getting drunk you know how it is you know some even my kids from first grade they come back and have these Marty girl parties they come back with all these beads on and all these hats and it's just rry they're teaching their first graders to do stuff like that like it's okay it's not okay the Holy Ghost makes you holy praise God and loves Holiness praise God but he said he said his dad was his hero grown up because he'd stand there and just play Jesus songs like The Old Rugged Cross and I'll Fly Away Hallelujah and Amazing Grace amen hallelujah and when the Savior calls I will answer he said and let's say one out of a hundred people that would stopped to talk to him would get saved he said maybe in those 36 years maybe he just saved a hundred people and he said my dad was my hero and so this guy knows knows some of the word of God I respect that let me say I respect that because I've never done that I've only brother Brooks and I only went out in the park did it once or twice we didn't get spit on people started joining us that was nice but this is kind of viral you know it's almost four million way more than videos that I've ever got you know definitely viral but um you know they have a lot of conversation if you want to watch it go to the 38 minute Mark and from there on they kind of talk about uh the mark of the beast and everything like that but our our our uh I'm sorry this this man John he takes a hard stand against anybody who believes in the Scofield bible and I got my Scofield bible right here by God's grace I got my Scofield bible the one I preached with since 2009 so this is a very almost 20 years I preached out of this scoffield Bible and church I went and looked scoffield only has brother there's just a few notes on the Rapture it's not like he F it's not like he fills the book and says anyone that doesn't believe in the preach ration Rapture is of the devil he don't even say that he just says there's uh there there's a there's a Rapture before the tribulation and then Jesus C has to come back to the Jews uh for the 144,000 and then Jesus has to come back at Armor again he just brings out that point that there's numerous comings of Jesus how many remember that when I said that there's numerous comings left of Jesus there's the Rapture for the Gentiles there's the 144,000 uh there's Armageddon Hallelujah and then uh yeah then he's here yes there's at least there's three there's still three more comings he's already had one there's at least three more but most people don't know the scripture and so they say oh there's only one more coming and think about that they put all these different they make all these events one event to me that's the uh that that that's the almost the insanity of it how can you make the Rapture and the 144,000 Jews and uh uh and Armageddon how can you make all that one event in the moment of twink of an eye that it's you can't do that there's too many things happening all right everybody with me everybody feeling good today I'll give you a chance to reset that's what I tell my class all right everybody reset now there's a video link if you want it so this is John Rich's claims at the 39 minute Mark he said in 1830 John Darby introduced a pre-tribulation Rapture now I studied Darby I didn't find much bad things about him he seemed like a pretty good preacher I don't know searched two websites got answers and Wikipedia I didn't see much bad about him but scoffield learned from him and and then uh in uh Scofield put this his pre-tribulation teaching in his first Study Bible it was 1909 Scofield put out his first Bible now does 1909 mean anything to anybody that was when brother Brown was born so that's why in 2009 Brother Joseph put out a 100-year anniversary Bible of the Scofield bible with some brother Ram quotes in there and was my first scoffield Bible that uh Joe and Carrie C gave to me a special gift by God's grace you got one too oh yeah I think we got one do we glory amen that's right yeah that's right Hallelujah and so uh John Rich makes this claim and he might be right I don't know but he makes a claim that it all started from John Derby but I say like this the pre-tribulation Rapture started with Paul Hallelujah I believe we can prove that by the Bible and then you know on the video he reads all of Matthew 24 John Rich does he reads it to Tucker Carson and Tucker Carson he's he's actually more humble right now he says when the Jehovah's Witnesses knock on his door and they want to give you paper hey can I give you a paper can I he says he reads every one of those now that's a sincere man that's a man who's open to truth how many of us are that open to truth now we we know better right but how many of us when we were searching for God we're just willing to read and learn and uh Tucker said he even bought a Bible with no notes in it so he didn't get any deception from any man that's pretty good that's pretty good I like that I like that if I just had a way to email him somehow you know anybody got his email address I like to text him and so Darby was a lawyer turned preacher he taught premillennialism which means Jesus comes back before the Millennium and dispensationalism like Gentile Jews right he goes from dis this dispensation into the next dispensation also the seven Church ages are dispensational now scoffield had a very sinful past I'm not going to say much about it but he had a very sinful past that's why some people don't like him I'll say like this he lived in adultery he was in adulterer uh but he turned to a preacher and he published his first Study Bible in 1909 the same Year brother Bram was born now here's Tucker's claim now this is what I don't understand if anybody can help me on this you're welcome to help me Tucker claimed that Scofield's commentary his commentary had has had massive effects on United States politics and resulted in the deaths of many people there's the time Mark if you want to go listen to it I'm like how is the pre-tribulation rapture caused people to Die the pre-tribulation Rapture I wish I could have got more answers on that I don't see how it would make anybody die then three minutes later John Rich tells listeners the supposed danger of the Rapture I'm sorry the pre-tribulation Rapture he says there's danger in teaching that I I've been preaching it for uh 20 years I haven't seen any danger in it I've seen hope in it think about what's the other the other thing is if you don't believe in the pre tribulation Rapture then you're going to suffer through the tribulation period there is hope and Jesus says remember and Paul says we will not obtain the wrath of God but we will obtain salvation from the Lord hallelujah so John Rich says the danger of scoffield and his Bible which brother Bram didn't find it to be danger did he he took it in the cave and the angel met him in the cave Hallelujah he said it can't be the mark of the beast oh yeah uh John Rich says if you're a scoffield Believer he said you'll go up to the mark the Beast and say oh yeah th this this Mark in your hand or head yeah this can't be the mark of the beast because I'm still here go ahead and sign me up that's what he thinks is the deception friends that is no deception any Bible reader any lover how many love Jesus Christ any lover of Jesus Christ will know Revelation 13 anytime the world is going to force you to take a mark of the beast you know it's the devil in other words that won't deceive a real believer and the church said amen hallelujah everybody's a little tired today okay so I'll try to try to see if the Lord will stir us back up amen hallelujah because I got to finish this thought amen bear with me that's understandable praise God we all have tired Sundays don't we all have tired Sundays anybody have ever have a tired Wednesday night now what about when you're the preacher in it's tired wies tday you got to let the songs lift you up and then you got to get out of your uh tiredness you got to get in the spirit amen hallelujah so he says that's the danger well uh I'm still here the world's forcing us uh to take a mark to buy or sell well sure I'll take it I'm sorry the Bible says if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life brother William before the foundation of the world you won't take the mark of the beast Hallelujah you'll be able to recognize the Beast the wisdom of God will help you recognize the Beast and you'll turn on you'll overcome the Beast system Hallelujah if your name was on God's book Hallelujah before the foundation world the elect cannot be deceived hallelujah amen glory to God so see this is a weak at best weak argument to attack our our scoffield Bible and our pre-tribulation Rapture and then he says when he does show up the Antichrist the pope Antichrist which the Antichrist is going to be a pope there the pre-tribulation Believers are going to be walking right into a buzzell so that's what he thinks he thinks Christians who believe Scofield's Bible and brother Ram's teaching right anybody who believes pre- tribulation are walking into a buzs saww and they can't see the buzs saww I'm sorry the Revelation gives you victory over the gates of hell we don't walk into the Gates of Hell brother William Hallelujah we we overcome the Gates of Hell Hallelujah I mean this just goes against all common Bible knowledge is anybody being helped today by God's grace Hallelujah and here's what I like about Tucker brother William it raises the question I wrestle with every day which is how do you know what's true how do you know what's deception and what's truth and the brother and and John rich said you got to have discernment and anyone who's not telling you the word of God is a deceiver and I said Amen to that Hallelujah and also God sent us a prophet named William brandham to point us back to the Bible to finish the mystery of God with the spirit of Elijah to tell us how to get ready for the Rapture by pointing us to one thing everybody say the Bible ready the Bible that's it he pointed us to here every man of God every true preacher of God will point you right here to the word of God hallelujah won't be something outside the word you can't add one word or take one word away it'll be right there in the Bible Hallelujah see I think there's hope for tuckle Carson Hallelujah I think there's hope I know he's done a lot of cuss words I've heard him say cuss words and I don't listen to him much at all anymore but when I saw this I thought oh my There's Hope now uh let's see I've got all this here uh let me close let me close I'm going to close with this brother brandom came and as I said he gave us thus sayeth the Lord how many know that by God's grace he gave us I've never heard Billy Graham say that I've never heard TD Jake say that Joel ostein now I've heard Kenneth and say it but he was wrong remember he said thus sayith the Lord Co you're going to end right now it was March of 2020 well Co is still going on right we had kids miss school recently because of Co CO's still going on and he said I command you to stop well it actually got worse after that that man's a liar he's not a prophet of God but remember um I want to read this here it's a reference for me I'm reading it here the last sign before the Rapture now this is a little deeper here but in Genesis 18 God foreshadowed the last sign before the Rapture right the last sign and the Rapture is typed through Isaac Isaac's birth represents Jesus's Second Coming Hallelujah that's what we can see because it's the coming of the son it's the promised coming and in order for that to happen Abraham and Sarah had to have a body change the Bible said her womb was dead and Abraham's strength was dead and then but God had to come to him in Genesis 17 and say Abraham you're gonna have a son through Sarah and and Abraham laughed in the face of God remember that but what'd he do eventually he believed him praise God because unbelief does not hinder God I thought I'd hear a little louder Amen on that cuz you're Abraham you're Abraham's seed Hallelujah you and I are Sarah we don't always just easily believe God and you know you and I just we never get to the spot where we have no no unbelief or no sins we're always going to be battling sin right up until the time of the Rapture praise God but see our unbelief as children of God does not hinder the move of God hallelujah God will accomplish what he said every word in the Bible will be fulfilled Hallelujah so in Genesis 18 God comes to Abraham and Sarah the last time before Isaac comes remember and God told Abraham surely I'll visit you right and Sarah will have a son remember that now Sarah was right there behind the tent right behind the the the tent and she laughed at God I'm G to have a son impossible how can I have a son and then God called her out and said Sarah you laughed and she said I didn't didn't I didn't laugh she lied in the face of God God said no you did laugh right so see God forgives our lies didn't God forgive rahab's lie Hallelujah didn't God forgive Abraham's lies how many believe God has a message of Grace amen hallelujah our sins God forgives if we'll confess them and own up remember the I heal your backslidings you got to you and I got to come to God and say God forgive me bring the sacrifice of your lips the calves of your lips I was wrong it was my sin it was my iniquity receive me return to me and God will return to you Hallelujah I will heal your backslidings Hallelujah so then God told Sarah yes I'll visit you according to the time of life so next year the very next year was when Isaac came so in that one year of time Abraham and Sarah started slowly getting younger and think of that church didn't Abraham have six more Sons after that or seven who who remembers huh you remember Lydia how many sons Abraham coutura bore him some sons and I mean he was so thoroughly changed Oh my he was th so thoroughly changed you know after having Isaac he didn't go back to being old he still had this body change Hallelujah and he had numerous more Sons afterwards why because death was swallowed up in life Hallelujah amen I'm trying to close but I'm enjoying this amen I know you are too I know it's just a tired tired Sunday here hallelujah so what was the last sign before Abraham and Sarah's body changed it was God revealing the thoughts and intents to Sarah's heart right and that's what God did in brother Brandon's Ministry we have 1,00 tapes of brother random from when he preached from the 40s 50s 60s I would say there's maybe a thousand maybe more you can hear the prayer lines where they'll bring people to before brother brandom and he'll tell them their name their address their doctor what happened he'll tell them all their secrets and brother R said this is not me this is Jesus giving you a sign this is jesus' sign that you're the true church if you believe the word of God and then remember brother said this six times he said remember let me tell you thus sayith the Lord that's on me this is the last sign to the Gentile Church before the rapture three days later he said thus sayith the holy spirit this is your last sign write in your Bible and if something Rises beside this greater than this call me a false prophet I've watched that Malachi for your whole life amen I've watched it when is somebody gonna rise who can do a greater Ministry than brother brandom it's never risen they can't even get close like I told you Kenneth copen I remember watching that it was so sad he stood there and he said I stand as a prophet of God and I command uh Co to end in March of 2000 and they're saying praise God it's over praise God it's over and it's still going he saysi he Saidi I stand in the office of a prophet of God that's no Prophet that's a false prophet that's a charlatan after your money bragging about how many uh private planes he has Jesus said you can't serve two masters either love one and hate the other you can't serve M and money and god let's serve God hallelujah amen third time he said Just remember sayith the Lord you'll never in any more Gentile Church age ever see a sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign of the church in 1962 you'll never see another sign this is it thus sayith the Lord would a prophet of God make a statement like that if it wasn't true you're receiving your greatest sign your last sign before the appearing of Christ April 1964 this is the last sign remember thus sayith the Lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you're seeing your last sign this is scriptural you've seen your last sign Pentecost and I was raised in the Pentecostal church and I've seen the fall of the Pentecostal church and even no now more my my mom's still there we talk about it even she's seen the Fall Away from Holiness into sin and immorality even she's to this day she's 74 almost she still sees it and brother said th it's your last sign Pentecost the Pentecostal church should have accepted brother R's Bible teachings but they still wanted to live in sin they they didn't want to they didn't want to tally up and Obey God's word I saw it my mom saw it amen verse and then the last one I'm sorry not verse last quote 1965 remember Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God until the promised son arrived how many knows that's true that's that sign of discernment and the Royal Seed of Abraham let me hear you or let me tell you thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last sign that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart that speaks that this is the truth and the church said we have six thus saith the Lords that we've got the last sign before the Rapture it was brother Ram's Ministry that Jesus was doing through him Discerning the thoughts and intents telling them their secrets just like God told Sarah her secrets and then there and then there was a body change Church there's going to be a body change Hallelujah I hope we live to see it here's my last quote and I'm finished after this I'll be done right about about 12 here I heard a preacher preach this brother Jose I thought you liked this one the church is going to be there without one spot or wrinkle how many can say Amen to that you're going to the church is going to be there that wise virgin was there right the grace of God will do that it'll have to it'll take Grace now what does he reference when he says you're going to be uh without spot Rinko in the Rapture what Bible verse does he reference Abraham and Sarah he like he talked to Abraham and Sarah doubt him well right then he could have slayed them right he could have slew Sarah right therefore for doubting him and laughing at his face because that's the worst sin there is is unbelief it's the only sin right unbelief is the real Sin they just don't believe God's word and she doubted and laughed within herself when the angel discerned her through the tent is that right but why couldn't he take Sarah because she's part of of Abraham he'd had to take Abraham too because they were one and we are part of Jesus when we're in the body of Christ Hallelujah not only church were are you the part of the body of Christ you were in the mind of Christ before the foundation if I was in his mind I could never get out amen if you're in his mind you'll never get out praise God your name was on the book your name was on the ls Book of Life you won't take the mark of the beast because he for knew you would be a believer I love this our beliefs are excused if we do it ignorantly like she did for she was scared let's stand to our feet musicians can come so church I wanted to encourage you with this you've been a good audience Hallelujah I got a lot more to go here well yeah yeah I told you that was my last quote so I'm not going to do that okay I'm I got I
