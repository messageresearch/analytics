========================================

uh Isaiah 27 tonight Isaiah 27 never preached this text before it was kind of Quicken to me while I was uh uh preaching on the Rapture on Sunday I noticed brother Brandon he quoted a scripture and I don't know if you remember it but I went and found it you know from Isaiah where it said I the Lord will water it uh and keep it day and night and i' I'd always wondered what scripture that was so let's read it here tonight we'll read verses 1 two and three it's good to see Elijah again tonight let's give him a round of applause Hallelujah God bless you Elijah buddy you're you're spoiling me brother you're spoiling me brother two weeks in a row man and who's this my cin let's give Lucas round Vol God bless you Lucas hallelujah praise God yeah we're very proud of Elijah very proud of you sir you know just was really something you know when your children start graduating you know it's just it's it's a whole different thing right Lydia it's a whole different thing it's just like wow how how did that happen so we're thankful for Elijah thankful for uh Lucas by God's grace Isaiah 27 we'll read verses 1 two and three I trust this will be a blessing to you tonight I want to preach on I the Lord will water you every moment I want to preach on that tonight by God's grace I never had this thought till just kind of was quickened to me actually today while I was studying I didn't know which way to go and uh the Holy Spirit kind of brought me back to Sunday when I finish with this uh scripture brother Brandon mentions this he mentions this scripture 23 times and he never cites the scripture that's why I had to go back and look at it because I'm like what scripture is this Isaiah 2712 and 3 I'll read one two and then we'll read three together have another word of Prayer in that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish Leviathan now this is not speaking of the leviathon that we know of like the water serpent it's actually figurative language of Babylon the piercing serpent because remember he's called that old dragon that old serpent even Leviathan that crooked Serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea remember this is the days of Isaiah this is 800 or 900 years before Christ verse two in that day sing ye unto her a Vineyard of red wine so singing of course to Israel now let's read verse three ready 1 2 3 I the Lord do keep it I will water it every moment lest any hurt it I will keep it night and day may God add blessing to ring his word you can be seated there yeah I guess we'll just get right to the preaching here by God's grace Hallelujah so I want to preach on this here just for about an hour by God's grace anyone that knows me knows hour is pretty short sermon so we would like to look at this I the Lord will water you every moment this was an extremely uh strange scripture to me as I was preaching on the Rapture on Sunday uh I come across that that's right brother bam said this and I thought what verse is that and so I ran it back here and it's Isaiah 27 uh 1 2 and three now of course this whole chapter uh deals with Israel now one thing you'll see though brother random often puts at the end of this he puts uh this extra thought of and no one shall pluck you out of my hand now that's not in the scripture right but we do see God keeping the vineyard right in verse three and we see uh it won't be hurt right so we get this idea that God is going to protect his Vineyard and he will keep it which means guard it night and day what a promise to Israel I hope you know where I'm going Hallelujah if not well now what most people don't understand is that this is a promise for Israel for the Millennium so if you have your Bible go to Isaiah 27 and go down to verse 133 I believe it's the final verse of the chapter it says and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown now remember we preached on the Millennium this summer did we not and we preach on the future home and they shall come with which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria which was near Babylon and the outcasts in the land of Egypt which was far from Babylon and shall Worship the Lord in the Holy Mount of Jerusalem so this is a scripture that sets us up for uh people were going to perish in uh Assyria they're going to perish down in in Egypt but God's going to blow a great trumpet or Christ would we'd say would grow blow a great trumpet or maybe the angels and then they're going to come they would have perished but God's going to have mercy on them and they're all going to come to Jerusalem to worship now we all know that hasn't happened uh since Isaiah spoke this right Egyptians have not all the Egyptians all the leftover syrians and the Babylonians they've not all come to do this so this is a scripture referring to the Millennium a millennial scripture now what's interesting to you and I is that brother Brandon would use this preaching to the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ Hallelujah so uh was brother random using this out of uh context the answer is no Hallelujah brother random was seeing a type in here uh by the grace of God which we're going to get to tonight Hallelujah now I want to read uh from one of the commentators I believe this is Albert Barnes if I'm not mistaken he said uh chapter 27 has lots of different expositions on it but uh everyone all seems to agree that's preach this that chapter 24 of Isaiah chapter 25 and 26 all go together the main idea was to show The Joy which would be uh given to Israel upon their rescue and uh brought back to their land the main purpose is to show the effect that the Captivity and deliverance in purifying the Jews themselves and in overcoming their prosperity to idolatry on account of which the Captivity has been suffered to take place the design of this chapter chapter 27 is like that of many others in Isaiah to comfort them when they should be oppressed during the long and painful Exile hallelujah how many know God loves to comfort us hallelujah one thing about God God will not keep suffering from you he'll let you go through suffering in order to help you be more obedient but while you're going through the suffering God will give you reason to Hope Hallelujah so God wrote this uh almost 2800 years ago maybe 29 almost 3,000 years ago to Israel church and it gives them hope today I showed my wife I've been finding these shorts on uh YouTube and it's showing the Israelis dancing by the Western Wall dancing these and only the men are together right the men are always separated from the women they're dancing shouting the praise of of of Jehovah they're blowing the chofar even in the midst of War they're still doing their celebrations they know God keeps his word hallelujah in fact uh I've seen many numerous Israelis make shorts and say the fact that that we've had thousands of missiles shot at us very few people have lost their lives he said it's proof that the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is still watching over his Israeli seed Hallelujah I mean Israelis today that don't even know Christ they're constantly putting on social media God's the god of Miracles God's a supernatural uh faithful God he keeps his word he protects his people now how many can say Jesus Jesus protects you hallelujah amen exactly right have we just seen it with this election hopefully by God's grace we'll see how it plays out I'm cautiously optimistic right I was not so optimistic on Sunday just because of the last four years I just can't understand the Deep state but God knows all things and God is able to silence them Hallelujah so we'll see we'll see how things go but see uh Israel can even see in the midst of their trials God is protecting them and although Isaiah 27 hasn't been fulfilled they've seen all the other scriptures been fulfilled that God is keeping Israel God's protecting Israel God gives Israel the best weapons God gives Israel the best defense Hallelujah uh God and it's it started since they came back into the land with the Six Day War God has done continually done Supernatural things God's hand is over Israel and I'll say like this God's hand is over his bride as well Hallelujah so we're thankful for Amazing Grace Hallelujah now now we can see in verse one that this great Leviathan is a serpent and we know that serpent we'll get to that in just a moment but then we see that's verse one but in verse two it's a song uh it's a song uh because it says in that day sing ye unto her so in the day when the serpents destroyed sing to her sing to Israel a Vineyard of red wine so Israel isn't a Vineyard of red wine yet but she's going to be now church we all know the third seal what's the oil and wine everybody what's the oil represent everybody say it the baptism of the Holy Ghost what's the wine represent stimulation of Revelation or Joy right the joy of Revelation Hallelujah good job you're a good Bible class Hallelujah been taking good notes been paying attention so this is speaking future Israel is going to have the wine but church we have the wine already hallelujah it's the word I was so simulated by Sunday on Proverbs 8:17 I went home and I started quoting the scripture why do I have to be tired I don't have to be tired in the morning I need to get up I need to get up because God's going to meet with me Hallelujah and I've had three good days by God's grace may God help it to continue Hallelujah just the word it stimulated me it it just changed my thoughts it just changed my whole outlook on things that's the power of God's word hallelujah it's able to stir us up amen hallelujah and so we see uh she's going Israel is going to have red wine she's going to have the oil wine she's going to be born as a nation in one day Hallelujah 144,000 will receive receive the baptism of holy ghost in one day Hallelujah now the rest of the chapter goes on to give Israel even more comfort in this song yahweh's protection over the vineyard is shown in Isaiah 273 right that's the protection God is going to keep it God's going to water it every moment everybody say every ready every every moment there's never going to be a time when Once God returns to Israel that he's not watering that people hallelujah less any HT it he's not going to let anybody hurt his Vineyard and I will keep the guard day and night now lyia Mal kind Cas you know there's some Scallywags that go in the Ritman Orchards and they kind of mess up the orchard right right that that's allowed but but not in God's Orchard Hallelujah in God's Orchard God protects his Orchard if God's going to do this for Israel what about the bride hallelujah amen everybody understand that Hallelujah God's going to protect his Orchard he's going to prot protect his Vineyard and he's going to guard it day and night God always has a guard how many know there's always an angel guarding you Hallelujah the Bible said everyone who fears God has an angel camped around them Hallelujah and brother R tells us to entertain those angels right so praise the Lord hallelujah that makes the angel happy Hallelujah right praise the Lord give God honor say thank you Lord for protecting me all the way from manura thanks for helping me drive all the way up here right that'll be that'll be Elijah's Praise on the way home Hallelujah Mali that'll be your drive on the way home praise God all the way from Doylestown God's protected us hallelujah entertain the Angels tell God how much you appreciate him Hallelujah do we ever think about it how we get all this free oxygen and we get all these cells multiplying millions of billions of cells in our bodies every day our strength is renewed every single day sometimes we take it for granted God help us to show some gratitude once in a while hallelujah amen all that God has given to us praise God we got two eyes that can see and we got bodies that can move we have so many uh natural blessings and on top of that we have so many spiritual blessings we ought to be a happy Vineyard tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen now we see also in verse uh five I'm sorry four and five Hallelujah well yeah let me read verse five or let him take hold of my strength that he may uh make peace with me and he shall make peace with me so God even uh gives the promise here gives the promise of Peace if Israel uh uh needs uh takes a hold of God and they take a hold of his word God will give him peace how much more will God give us peace Hallelujah if we take a hold of God's strength and what is the strength of God the joy of the Lord is our strength if we remember to be happy about God happy about what Jesus has done happy about the New Testament the New Covenant the word of God written upon the fleshly tables of our heart if we choose to be happy about that we'll be strong when we go to school we'll be strong when we go to work we'll be strong in our homes we'll be strong when we have the joy of the Lord hallelujah praise God God is so faithful so we must trust him right if we take a hold of his strength we'll have peace with God God's not fighting against us God's fighting for us we can trust God too because Hebrews 13 says uh he'll never leave us nor forsake us God doesn't forget about you Hallelujah he's never forgot about you Malachi right sister Zer sister NE uh sister Lydia Casa God's never forgot about you one time hallelujah amen and that's what the devil the devil's trying to lie to you to tell you that he has forgotten about you but God never forgets about you Hallelujah I heard a good preacher say this this week he said you know how Satan kills and Steals and destroys you know the Bible says Jesus comes that we might have life and have it more abundantly but Satan only comes to steal from you kill you and destroy you and how does he do that he lies to you that's all this is Satan Whispering lies in our ears and we have a choice either Believe it or cast it down let's cast it down tonight Hallelujah that's how he's trying to steal from you kill from you destroy you just tell you lies church we must go back to the word of God we must find what the Bible says we must believe God's word above Satan lies hallelujah amen hallelujah that's what I need that's what you need amen he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us hallelujah and then we're even given a promise that will flourish and Israel of course this is speak in Israel but we I'm going to show you this has to apply to the bride as well uh verse six and he shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root Israel shall Blossom and Bud and fill the face of the world with fruit remember the 144,000 are called the first fruits unto God but Church there's a thousand years imagine a thousand years that Israel will multiply and and have uh families and for a thousand years Hallelujah Jesus will rule over Israel with a rod of iron Hallelujah and the TW Apostles will sit on Thrones judging the TW tribes of Israel right under Jesus Christ Lord of lords King of Kings King of the Millennium Hallelujah H oh now here's the quote I read to you on Sunday night or I'm sorry mentioned but I didn't read it now this just for you who uh who are wondering about that what about the heathens who di that never heard about Christ now one time brother Ram said it it's May 27th 1962 brother Ram said and then at the return of the church and the bride the Bride In Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and there they shall reign and the Heathen that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time now now I'm not making this Doctrine I'm just telling you the quote because I told you there's a quote that says God might raise up the people that would include the babies that never got a chance that were aborted or whatever they never got a chance or sick and died at young age they never got a chance to hear it's possible I'm not saying it is but it's possible now to me that would make a lot of sense well God wants to give them a chance right God doesn't do away with their souls and their Spirits God has a waiting Spa station for it because remember God fornew us before we even formed Us in the womb hallelujah hallelujah and he knew like we read in in Romans 9 he knew what we would do before we even had one day upon the Earth Hallelujah so it just it's just one thought everybody say that's just one thought ready that's just one thought that's it's just a thought it's not I'm not making Doctrine he said the heathens never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested ah will be manifested Hallelujah all the creation will no longer have to grown because God's children will be manifested will appear like Christ will be like Christ and we will rule this Earth by the grace of God hallelujah that's what you and I ought to live for we ought to live so holy now let the people rule whatever they want rule there but we've got to rule over sin now so that we can rule during the Millennium if he's to rign and I'll put she's in there for all of our sisters because we have a lot of sisters in our church if she's to rain she's got to have something to rain over he's got a domain and they ruled and reigned with Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of iron the Nations that then the gospel then the manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here see there come there will come the Millennium in that rain see upon the ashes now wouldn't that be amazing if we have the same Authority Christ had when Christ was on the earth I'm talking about power over storms amen hallelujah I'm talking about power over nature speaking to trees come on Church speaking to storms and and all this power power over death even amen hallelujah I mean all things are possible to them that believe eyes not seen ears not heard it's not even entered in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him amen and God loves us tonight let me let's go back I'm going off my notes go back to Revelation one let me just remind you of this this was a real blessing to me on Monday morning well I needed this on a Monday morning Revelation chapter 1 verse five now this is written to John to the seven churches in verse four verse 5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead how many know he's alive today amen hallelujah if you let his Spirit come upon you you'll know he's alive Hallelujah because he'll give you new life in your uh and take you the sin nature out of your heart and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us who do he love us who does Jesus love he loves he loves you Hallelujah and washed us from all our sins in his own blood so Jesus did not go get the detergent bottle like you and I do to clean the dishes or to clean the the clothes he didn't go get something else he brought his own blood hallelujah amen and he washed us in our in his blood from our sins with his own blood he didn't get some other detergent from somebody else or something like that he used his own blood oh the precious blood of Jesus that washes us white as snow amen and what he do he loves you right that's what the Bible says so remember tonight God loves you Hallelujah God washed you himself hallelujah how can you act like a Christian how can you live like a Christian because Christ has washed you hallelujah amen glory to God Amen that's right now let's go back here uh well well I'm skip ahead here by God's grace I'm gon to skip ahead I'm not going to read all Isaiah 27 because I'm almost halfway out of time here um almost there let let's go back uh let's remember how God God cannot forget Israel at all so uh Deuteronomy 4:31 I'm gonna have Casa pretty busy here on the computer H just for a little stretch by God's grace Deuteronomy 4:31 for the Lord thy God is a merciful god how many grateful for mercy and mercy is what you get when you've done wrong brother amen asked me to preach on that I might do that at some time Grace is just a gift but Mercy is when you don't deserve it right Hallelujah so for the Lord thy God is a merciful god that means he's merciful to your iniquities when you know to do right and you don't do it he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he swear unto them Hallelujah God does not forget his covenants he keeps his promise Hallelujah Isaiah 49:15 16 Isaiah 491 15- 16 can a woman forget her suckling child now in these days yes not so much then a lot of women do awful things now abortion and so forth that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget thee amen behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me I don't know if this ties in this just struck me now the Bible said not only is Israel on uh Israel is is engraved in the palms of God's hands right or Christ's hands but remember the walls are contined before me but remember the Bible said God broke down the middle wall partition so there's no separation between the Jew and Gentile Hallelujah and that means if God's not going to forget Israel God just didn't die for Jews God died for Gentiles amen hallelujah he he called a people that were not his people his people he called children that were not his children his children he called us that were unloved he called us his beloved Hallelujah glory to God so even now even as Israel is blind to Christ they only know uh the the Torah they only know the prophets in the Old Testament even though uh they're blinded to Jesus Christ they still have God's covenant God cannot forget them and who tonight has the New Covenant of the Holy Ghost written upon the fleshly tables of your heart somebody ought to say Amen to that Hallelujah and if God doesn't forget them while they're blind God won't forget you while your eyes are wide open hallelujah amen oh thank God God put isav on my eyes Hallelujah so I can see the truth of God's word hallelujah that's what he promised in this hour I'll give you eyes have so you can see the real condition of the church the real condition of the world and you can walk in the light of the Gospel I don't know if Elijah knows this but uh most you know it but I was raised in a church Elijah almost every week there was tongues and interpretation people screaming and crying and my mom was healed of cancer when I was 8 years old I mean I've seen emotion I've seen Miracles uh throughout my entire life but uh they never lived a holy life right and so I I saw the power of God but I didn't see the real love of God the humility of God the Holiness of God cuz God said be holy for I'm holy God didn't say be ye woke cuz I'm woke he said be ye holy cuz I'm holy Hallelujah he said be separate separate yourself from the things of the word come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord and I'll receive you Hallelujah that's right we must come out from among these things and that's how I know that God has uh uh called us to the truth because brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord over a thousand times and I found at least six and then there's 10 at least 10 that applied to Divine Healing he told people thus sayith the Lord that were healed and it's on tape I need to preach that sometime soon like in the early 50s brother R will tell somebody it's brother or sister so- and so might be Shepherd I can't remember the exact name I was reading through a few weeks ago he said thus sayith the Lord you're going to be well and you fast forward a couple years that person came back and brother BR said how you doing are you well according to the word of the Lord there said they said just exactly as you said brother brandom thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah that's right church amen thus sayith the Lord k not fail Hallelujah God has sent us a prophet for a reason to direct us back to the word of God now remember God promised to gather Israel and that's what he's done did you know this in the last 120 years more than 3.5 million Jews have immigrated back to the land of Israel from all over the world they have come rushing back that's because God promised to do it Jeremiah 16 164 let's read that Jeremiah 16:14 and 15 a lot of people don't know that Israel was spread out remember we saw it in the dispersion they were all spread out uh they even brought in Babylonians remember we preached on the partial fear of the Lord they brought in Babylonians to kind of live there in Samaria while so many people were scattered around in different nations verse 14 Jeremiah 16:14 there behold the days come sayith the Lord that it shall be no more said the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of land of Egypt but the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands with he had driven them and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers how many know we're living in the Fulfillment of this right here it doesn't apply to us but it applies to the land of Israel they are living in that day they're saying the Lord lives who's brought us back from the north from the south from the east from the West the Lord lives God Is Watching Over his people because they're his Vineyard hallelujah oh my glory to God now let's go back to that leviathon remember Revelation 12:2 let's go back to that leviathon therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell them dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the seal I'm sorry and for the sea for the Devils come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time so this is right after the Rapture Satan the bride goes up Satan's down and he knows he's got seven years left that's right he's got a whole week left brother said a couple times Israel has a week left verse 13 and when the dragon there's that Leviathan saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the Manchild that's Israel verse 14 and to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the Wilders so see uh women are like nations are lik into having wings as birds Hallelujah that will prove there's no women Angels if you read Zechariah where it talks about the the the two angels that have wings like uh like women and they're they're carrying Israel in an epha right which is a a storage container these two angels uh these two women with wings are carrying Israel to Shar and people say oh there's women Angels that's a lie there's no such thing as women Angels there's only men Angels Hallelujah that's right and so who were those Nations that was uh Assyria and Babylon we carrying Israel out of their Homeland and that's where it is right there the woman Israel was given two wings of a great Eagle not a stor remember Assyria and Babylon had the stor wings that's an unclean abominable bird but not Israel Israel's liking unto an eagle Hallelujah that she might fly into the Wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time that's a year times two years and for the half a time which is half a year so three and a half years from the face of the leviathon I'll say like that Serpent and the serpent cast cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the Earth helped the woman and the Earth opened up her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth amen look how great God is Not only does God swallow up the enemies of Israel but before that God swallows up you the Bible says death will be swallowed up in life hallelujah amen God can swallow any enemy that comes against him he can defeat any foe nobody can conquer Jesus Christ he swallows up all the enemies Hallelujah nobody can stop Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the Earth okay we read that verse 17 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her sea because remember the fifth seal told us there's still some of the Brethren that have to give their lives as Martyrs which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ so this is after Christ has uh returned to Israel and revealed himself to them and they have the testimony of the word of God the Old Testament and the testimony of Jesus Christ the New Testament Hallelujah now brother random uses that this phrase uh I'll Water it day and night and though no one will ever pluck them out of my hand I think brother R's uh combining John 10:27 if you go to John 10:27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give them unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand a sheep is a defenseless animal a sheep must be uh protected by a shepherd and that's what Jesus is saying tonight I'm protecting You Like a Shepherd amen there's no wolf there's no devil there's no addiction there's no evil spirit right there's no lust there's no sin that can ever pluck us out of the hand of God that ought to give us some confidence tonight Hallelujah that God's for for us God's with us I'm going to be saved God's going to finish what he started in my life Hallelujah no devil can pluck me out of my father's hand verse 29 My Father which gave them me is greater than all see so don't worry about the wolf you got a father that's greater than the wolves and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father are one Hallelujah so the father is in the son amen the father is in the Great shepher glory to God so see God's sheep follow the voice of the Bible the word of God and they will not be deceived by a stranger's voice you have nothing to fear oh is somebody going to deceive me no you have nothing to fear nobody can pluck you out of the father's hand you cannot be deceived because Christ is in you Hallelujah and church they will never perish which means will never be lost Hallelujah uh I like the story brother told you he said this he said uh when you hear Brother randoms died uh and dead he said don't believe him he said because I'm still alive on the other side Hallelujah so even if we perish right naturally that's not what it's talking about what it's talking about God won't let us perish spiritually we've got eternal life Hallelujah and we're promised uh we're promised eternal life with God almighty we're promised a mansion we're promised a future home but the thing that attracts us is the maker of the home it's Christ Jesus for in in Christ Jesus all things were created hallelujah oh that's what we're attracted by is Jesus Christ amen now how does this apply to us well turn your Bibles back to Matthew Matthew 20 verse1 for the Kingdom of Heaven is like un a man that's a householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his Vineyard and when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent them into his Vineyard now you know the story goes on uh at the 11th Hour which would have been what that been 5:00 p.m 5:00 P PM there's still work they still need workers and there's people just standing idly by and they say uh hey do you want to work why aren't you working he said well no one's invited us out and so okay come out they so they invite the 11th Hour workers to come out at the last hour kind of the cool of the day right so you have people that worked all Elijah how many hours you work today eight hours8 nine probably sometimes work 10 or 11 right probably sometimes 12 if they need you well they had to work 12 hours out in the field some of them worked 12 hours some of them only worked one hour but when they all come in after the out of the fields everybody got the same pay but the ones that were there the longest complained and God's like didn't I just promise you one thing I promise you all the same thing you all get eternal life hallelujah amen no no matter how hot it was no matter how many hours you worked you all get the same thing you all get eternal life with Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother R says we are the 11th Hour workers were to go out in the what Vineyard I showed you how Israel is going to be the vineyard but right now Church you're in the vineyard so Lydia Malachi and case you're G Have A New Perspective come spring Matthew 21:40 Matthew 21:40 when the Lord thereof The Vineyard cometh what will he do unto these husband men now this is the parable where the husbandman gave his Vineyard out to some workers he left he said keep it while I'm gone but when he would send Messengers they would kill the messengers because they want to keep the goods and finally he said well I'll just send my son because surely they'll respect my son that represented God sending Jesus Christ what they do they killed him right so then the the the owner of the vineyard gets upset right and he comes and brings judgment on them what will he do to those H husbandmen verse 41 they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men speaking of Israel and will let out his Vineyard unto other husband men which shall render him the fruits in their Seasons how many believe you got the nine fruits of the spirit flowing out of your life that's the fruit he wants you might say fruits of even saved Souls that's the fruit in other words you're working in the vineyard tonight Hallelujah you could be working at all kinds of places tonight but you're here at the house of God you're here planting seeds you're here watering you're here trimming you're here grafting you're doing all the works you're picking you're doing all these things out here you're doing all the work of the vineyard why so the master will have fruit to his Vineyard Hallelujah Jesus said unto them verse 20 or 42 did you never read in the scriptures the stone which a builder rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and is it marvelous in our eyes so the Jews rejected the owner of the vineyard but not the Gentiles the Gentiles accepted him and then the Gentiles he became their Cornerstone another words your life has stability because you've accepted Jesus Christ your life is going to stand no matter what Trials come or persecution or test you're going to stand you're going to keep the faith because your testimony is founded on the cornerstone The Rock Jesus Christ oh my other people their lives and their testimonies I'm sure even a lot elah Seena over there at the other Church in Michigan I'm sure people fall away why aren't they serving God anymore what happened to them they weren't founded on the Rock they weren't founded on the cornerstone the storms are coming but make sure you're established on the rock of Christ Glory verse 43 therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you Jews and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits there of Gentiles and whosoever shall fall on the stone shall be broken but on whomsoever shall fall it will grind him to powder right so we don't want Christ to come down and crush us we want to throw ourselves at the mercy of Christ and say Christ heal my broken pieces my life's broken without Jesus Christ but he can fix it Hallelujah he can heal my broken heart he can he can heal my wounded Spirit he can take the pieces of my life and place them back together so I know life is worth the living hallelujah hallelujah glory to God oh thank the Lord h verse 45 and when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his Parables they perceived that he spake on them oh Jesus preached on religious people sometimes yeah I do it too sometimes every preacher does while they're listening brother Jesse while they're looking right at you yes I do that sometimes too you have to because you have to preach what God puts on your heart Hallelujah Paul did it Stephen did it right Stephen looked right atad him said you stiff necked and uncircumcised and hard and ears how long do you resist the Holy Ghost H okay so can everybody see that how many know that we have access to the vineyard now Israel had the vineyard right but now you're working the vineyard you have a work to do think about that God thought so much about you he hired you there's a lot of people I wouldn't hire to work at my house I hired Austin a couple times when he was before he had a job he was a good worker Hallelujah but God thought so much of you he called you in the last hour to come work one hour oh Church can't we just work one hour for Jesus Hallelujah can you just work one hour please can we just handle it one hour Mali can we do it of course if we can work one hour he gives us the reward of all the other Saints who've labor much harder much longer than we have now who's the greatest now not us nor do we care to be we just want to be one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them Hallelujah and church the Bible tells us we're working in the vineyard 1 Corinthians 9:6 or I only and Barnabas have not we power to forbear working so preachers have the right not to work some of them have the blessing some of them don't verse nine who goeth a Warfare any time at his own charges see you don't go to war unless you're paid to go to War soldiers are always paid to go out and fight who planteth a Vineyard and eateth not the fruit thereof so now Paul call call preachers Vineyard Planters so that's what I've been doing for 18 years I've been planting seeds of the Gospel in the lives of the people and if they'll only let the seeds be watered Glory if they'll just give God praise if they'll just water the seeds that God has had me to preach they're going to bring forth fruit hallelujah amen oh that makes me happy hallelujah amen or who feedeth A Flock and eateth not the milk of the flock say I these things as a man or saith not the law the same also God's word also says this so preachers are workers in God's Vineyard Hallelujah sometimes it get so hot children I start sweating up here it still get so hot in the vineyard or sometimes the pressure gets so hot right some the pressure gets so intense that I start sweating all the pressure but we're thankful we're thankful God called us to work hallel it's a blessing to work Hallelujah for Jesus amen now what we got to do church is avoid being lazy Proverbs 24:30 let's read 30 down to 34 we must be very careful not to be lazy now Church what does that mean for us we got to read our Bibles every day you got to pray to God every day Hallelujah don't be lazy and uh the spiritual you got to confess your sins every day and the church said don't let sin stay in your life don't keep cussing stop cussing don't stop don't don't keep stealing stop stealing don't stop don't keep watching porn stop watching porn whatever it is stop it because if not it's like letting a a a Vineyard grow and not even taking care of it wasting wasting what God has entrusted to you wasting your future and sweat just rolled down my back so yeah it does get hot out in the vineyard here I went by the field of the slothful The Lazy and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding they just didn't understand the message did they there's some people that in God's called them but they don't understand the message the message is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and lo it was all grown over with thorns now what are thorns remember Church what are thorns cares of this life well I've got to do that I've got to do that I gotta that but remember church you can do all that as long as you put God first if you put God first God will give you time to do all that Hallelujah the cares of this life they can all be taken care of if we put God as number one in our lives and Nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down what the Bible say a man's spirit is the wall right a man who doesn't control his thoughts he's lusting all the time or he's greedy all the time he's dreaming about being Elon Musk all the time and you know he's got all these women he's got all these he's got like all these kids with all these women that's a hormonger now I I appreciate his freedom of speech but he's living like a hormonger that's right right so he don't have control over his human Spirit sexually speaking right his stone wall is broken down I I don't even know if he's working the kingdom probably not the way he talks and cusses but it just shows he don't have any wall built up but we've got to build the wall we've got to keep the enemy out build the wall here we go this politics stuff I I'm not talking we want to do it naturally but I'm talking spiritually build a wall in your life keep Satan out of your mind amen hallelujah if not you become lazy spiritually and you you you you you you ruin the potential God has given you to really do a work in the vineyard of God I got another email this week you know a mother saying brother Jesse thanks for writing your book I read it every day and teach my kids right out of your book I said praise God I got another email this week I just want to thank you God bless you I read I've read both your books keep up the great work for the message of the hour I said those are good fruits of the ministry verse four 32 then I saw and I considered it well I considered a lazy message believer I looked at it and I received instruction see church you can learn from Mrs lot don't be like Mrs lot don't be like a lazy Christian whose life and everything's broken down their lives they're lazy they don't live a clean Gospel Life they don't dress right they don't talk right they don't think right they don't live right let's learn from that let's live holy hallelujah hallelujah yeah we can take instruction from backsliders we can take instruction from make Believers we can take instruction from lazy message Believers verse 33 yet a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep see too tired to pray too tired to go work too too tired to uh feed the poor hallelujah too tired not enough not enough energy to go do anything for God so shall thy poverty come as one that travaileth and this is talking about spiritual poverty right no love of God no prayer life no joy no Victory thank God for the power that God's given to us and they want as an armed man my goodness so see they got no they got no ammunition right they they don't have nothing their walls are torn down everything's grown up no Harvest no no weapons no nothing they're just exposed they're laid out there and Satan has exposed them we got to keep Satan out Hallelujah people say where's the power of the Holy Ghost brother said who's got the power who which women got power to not cut their hair he said that's power amen he said which who's where's a woman that don't have that has power to not wear makeup brother said That's The Power of the Gospel amen you little sisters got good power Hallelujah who's he said where's the power of a woman not to wear sexy clothes and show off her body there's power in Holiness it's power that those girls that women they don't know nothing about because they're given to the power of Satan that's exactly right the power of Jezebel that's exactly right that's the spell of Jezebel I'm going to keep mentioning that brother Elijah that's a that's a that's called a red letter day when you have a good day like that A good sermon you never forget it that's a that's a red letter day now notice God had given this lazy uh message believer a a Vineyard but he hadn't kept it God always keeps his garden though God always watches over his garden we're the ones who don't Hallelujah now what I love about God is that God sees Our lives our own lives are like a Orchard our own lives right because we're producing fruits all the time let me go back let's go to Galatians 5 just I want to again I haven't read it I think I read it few weeks ago Galatians 5 let's look at the fruits of the spirit Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love I'm talking about real love not sexual love I'm talking about real love love joy how many people do you know are joyful about Jesus Christ not many because not many are very faithful with their Orchard or their Vineyard peace where's the person that's got peace with God where's the longsuffering person oh you you mistreated me again that's okay I still forgive you you mis you mistreated me 70 time 7 490 times I'll still forgive you 491 right longsuffering gentleness not rough and harsh goodness faith I still believe God I still trust in God despite my circumstances I still trust in the Living God I have faith in God meekness see there's that humility a humble Christian I don't know everything I'm not perfect I'm humble I want to be led by God I don't know all things God can still teach me something and then Temperance that's self-control over sexual sin right in bodily passions I don't get drunk I don't smoke I don't take drugs I don't commit sexual sin that's a fruit of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that's a mature uh fruit or outcome of the life of God it's evidence Glory it's evidence of the Holy Ghost in your life hallelujah amen against such there is no law but see 24 is what most people don't do and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust see most people don't crucify all the Temptations of the world right they don't crucify cigarettes or weed or porn as we said or greed they don't crucify that but you and I as Christians we must crucify those desires that's taking care of your Vineyard Hallelujah Glory now what I love is that uh God is so good to us he gives us the fruit of the Holy Holy Spirit and how many know uh that God God promised to water Israel day and night right pull it out there again uh Isaiah 273 God promised to water him every moment I'm trying to close here give me about 10 more minutes 8 o'clock is kind of like my time okay that's good you you had your hour you had your you had your hour to shout and praise God and give God glory now that's that's all relax verse three now look this is future I the Lord do keep it what his Vineyard his red wine vineyard The Vineyard that produced The Wine the stimulation the Revelation I will water every moment lest any heard it I will keep it night and day now we are now working in this Vineyard Glory remember didn't oh didn't the third seal said uh the third seal the word hurt the third seal the voice came out from the throne and said hurt not the oil and the wine there it is I knew there was something in there hallelujah praise God Amen God can't hurt your worship amen I'm sorry the devil can't hurt your worship God God will protect your worship Hallelujah if you want to praise God if you want to shout and give God glory if you want to dance around and worship God and give God glory the devil can't touch it Hallelujah if you want to praise God if you want to sing his Praises if you want to dance and worship God you Satan cannot hurt it and then God will keep giving you water he'll give you blessings his spirit will pour out on you God will bless you day and night hallelujah how many are living testimony of that I am I know that Hallelujah Elijah you you keep coming back we're have a dance service buddy I told the girls I said girls you got to give me a list now I'm still waiting now maybe you forgot give me a list of songs well when he's here we'll have a dance service Glory Hallelujah the said praise His name in the dance Hallelujah God deserves to be praised now he promised to do it now how does he do that how does God water you day and night very simple it's John 7:37 in that last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me John 7:38 as the scripture saith out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water amen hallelujah but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified look at this this is awesome setup God lets you be a Vineyard God makes your life a Vineyard to produce the fruits and you've got a well you've got an artisian well inside of you and as long as you open up that well the spirit of God will flow out it'll flow out into your life it'll water your life and you'll bring forth the fruit of the Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God Amen oh church he said I'm GNA water every moment so see church that's why we got to look for God in every moment look for him tonight we normally do on a Wednesday night right normally on a Sunday morning we're looking for God but look for him in the moments tomorrow am look for him early in the morning he promised if you seek me in the morning you'll find me amen hallelujah he promised it and he said I'm not going to water it once I'm not going to just water it three times a week I'm going to water it all the time every moment can be a moment of Joy the presence of God I know we're going to fight trials but I'm talking about when we're walking in Victory hallelujah amen glory to God he said I'm going to water it day and night that's the future but it's the present for us because we're in the vineyard of God almighty hallelujah what a blessing now I'm going to read this quote I heard this one again this week now I've been preaching on the seed right the wheat the wheat seed it starts off as a chute stem then chaff and then the seed we are in the seed stage it's harvest time right it's almost time for Jesus to come back we see Israel in her Homeland we so we see evil seducers waxing worse and worse once America changes the laws to kill Christians then we we know the Rapture will be very close because that's what the Bible said if you don't take the mark they'll kill you right buy or sell you can't do it without it brother is talking about changing from glory to glory and he said it's the the church has to come back to its original Glory it's just like a seed of a morning glory the seed of a flower it falls into the ground the seed of corn falls in the ground what's the first thing it comes up it's a little Sprout then it goes to a tassel from a tassel back to the original grain what's the first thing I'm sorry well that's exactly what the church has done it come up from Luther Wesley and now back to the original grain back to its original Glory back to the glory it was at the beginning the Sun that Rose in the East is the same Sun that's manifesting the same in the west changing from glory to glory it changed from the Pagan uh down into Luther from the Luther down into Wesley he talks about how the church had to die in the uh the fourth Church age almost and then into Wesley and then Wesley and the pente C and on and on from glory to glory producing the hidden mana and now it's ripe to bring him back exactly like he was in the beginning his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from Glory unto glory to glory and it's back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people act in the same way with the same power with the same sensation it's from Glory unto glory and the next change will be will be changed from Glory into a body likened unto his glorious body when we shall see him Hallelujah that's a mouthful I feel worn out now in other words God is bringing us back to they were at the beginning praise God we can see it with the doctrine we can see it with the word we can see it with our lives and we're going to see it more with more power Hallelujah I believe that because with sincerity comes power we must be more sincere Hallelujah brother R I talked to him on the phone the other day that met yesterday and he said he'd been praying for Revival for the last uh few weeks and he said he fasted three days and you can watch it on YouTube God had a real nice pouring out of the Holy Ghost there people at the altar praying glorifying God people got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and I said that I just was there a couple months ago it was very similar to that Hallelujah looked a lot like that You Weep there Hallelujah so God wants to pour out the same thing but we have to get into it we have to receive the water too we got to take the water drink the water amen because God wants to water us day and night God wants to bless us every moment praise God hallelujah let me close yeah I'll do one more I'll do a couple quotes uh brother brah prayed for God's Vineyard this is in 1964 who is Jesus now we pray that you'll just bind us around the court of the Holy Spirit and gather our hearts together and speak to us through the word of God bless this little chapter the businessman's chapter give it strength I the Lord have planted it I'll Water it day and night lest some should pluck it from my hand I pray Lord as your servant bless them strengthen them Lord for the Kingdom's sake so he's applying Isaiah 27 to a business a full gospel businessman's chapter and the church said is that part of the vineyard yes hallelujah oh Cas Mal are there some trees that are super fruitful and others less fruitful yeah so that means there's like wise virgin trees and foolish virgin tree lyd's laughing yeah there's different kinds of fruit praise God yeah lyd's like yeah good I didn't plan that but that's right some and brother is praying for the whole thing Lord you promise you'd water it you'd watch over it you wouldn't let the devil pluck it up amen and we wonder why we're here tonight because God has watered us he's kept us he's guarded us he's protected us he's given us everything we have need of not just three times a week but every moment of Our Lives hallelujah oh he said hurt not the oil and the wine Satan don't touch the oil and the wine this is my Vineyard my people love to praise me my people people love to shout my people love to give me Glory because they're bringing forth fruits under the Holy Ghost Hallelujah cuz it's the same Holy Ghost same power acting the same way same Sensations same everything it's Jesus Christ the same Hallelujah yesterday today and forever we're going to get a Revival pretty soon too I think maybe it' be Sunday Hallelujah we had a good Revival when Paul Griffin was here amen didn't that revive your hearts I remember coming back after that service everybody was really in into it worshiping and praising God that we we need them as much as God can send them as much as we'll let God water our Vineyard brother B applied to this course to his own church I don't have time because it's already 8 o'cl let's apply uh let me read a couple more here last one and then I got one more statement brother R says like somebody said brother random how you ever have anybody to listen to you that's what people say to me too uh how do you have anybody at your church brother Jesse the way you scream and shout and spit and dance and they said well we can see I can see Billy Graham he's got every denomination in the country with him I can see or Roberts every pan costal hangs right onto him but said you're against the whole thing kind of like brother Jesse is against the whole thing right the whole denomination outfit see said how in the world did you ever get anybody and I'm just adding that to come to your church brother Ram said I said it's God how did we get these people to even come here tonight Elijah uh it's God God's drawing Elijah God's drawing each one of us here and then brother R quotes I the Lord hath planted it before the foundation of the world so when was when was this Vineyard planted when he put that seed in you before the found ation Of The World God planted that in your soul Hallelujah by four knowledge Now by four knowledge then remember even their Angels the little angels even their theophany bodies behold the face of my Father in Heaven huh I he said I'll Water day and night unless some of them should pluck it up from my hand Isaiah said I water it I planted it I put their names on the book before the foundation of the world by pre destination I'll Water it just keep on moving I'll furnish the water you just spray it out now L Malachi Cas you have to water no you guys don't water right well maybe a little bit okay it's a little bit okay but that's what that's what that's what God Said God said I'll give you the water just make sure it gets spread out to where it needs it Church God's supplying the word we just got to come and accept the word of God and apply it to our lives that needed hallelujah what part of my life is struggling let's take some water in let's drink some water cuz God said he'd water it every day and night and every moment he give us water to overcome our trials Hallelujah he he Pro it's thus say the Lord every moment Saint we don't have to take off a few moments we can have the water of God in the moments we need it most excuse me he says yes I'll just water just keep on moving I'll F the water you spray it out Lydia that's right I'll Water it day and night unless one of them gets plucked out of my hand there you are so in closing I'm saying this Joel 223 says we have former rain latter rain brother Ram said his ministry was the former rain the teaching rain to teach us the message the latter rain is rapturing Faith we're waiting for the last rain to give us the energy we'll need to mature the seed Hallelujah to bring rapture in faith to us but in all these times too we're still receiving showers because the rain falls on the just and the unjust brother saw the vision the man in Black went forth I'm sorry the man in white went forth first that was Jesus he SED all the seeds then the man in Black came he swed all the tears and they said the rains came and uh and all the plants came up there was a time of drought and some more rains came up and the tears were saying praise God for the rain praise God for the rain so was the wheat the wheat was saying praise God God for the rain Hallelujah and church if we're the wheat we need to praise God for the water that he's given us hallelujah because the wheat the the the tears are going to do it we've got to say God thank you you didn't leave me dry you didn't leave me alone you never left me uh thirsty you never uh forsake me you always sent me water you always sent me scriptures you always send me songs you always refresh my spirit thank you Lord for these songs I'm giving you glory you promis to water me every moment and you'll keep watering me every moment Hallelujah you'll cause my Vineyard
