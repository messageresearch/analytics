course we want to pray also for those still uh battling with sickness and we know God is the Healer and so we're just going to lift each person up in prayer today that's sick and Afflicted and ask God to minister healing to them we just had a few prayer requests and a few announcements um one announcement is I put the giving statements for your taxes out on the prayer request table so you can write off all your charitable giving so um I think there's I think there's only four out there so if you if you'd like to do that I put them out there by God's grace so we're thankful again for God's mercy

battling cancer uh Mandy and Robbie and another woman named Melissa which you remember them in Prayer by God's grace also there's a friend I have just through you know texting he's from Canada he goes to a message Church his name is Brother Ray and he needs prayer for uh some documents I think he moved over from the Congo or some other country and he wants I think he wants to have permanent residents in Canada but they're having trouble with paperwork and he really wants our prayers he said brother Jesse if you could really do do this he said the only way this will work out is if God does a paradox how many know God's a god of paradox God God just did that for me you know this this just last year with my documents I didn't get them on time I forgot about it and God did a paradox he uh he allowed the the leaders to accept my paperwork late normally that's unacceptable God did a paradox there so that gives me faith that God will help this brother so his family is not divided

Jesus Christ's name SS said amen amen praise God you may be seated God bless you I just want before we open our Bibles you can be seated just for a moment just want to greet everybody again in the name of the Lord car can you see is the live stream still working we've had it you know we've had it Dro I think it dropped while Simon was preaching and I don't know why um it must just must be a setting or something like that but by God's grace hope everybody can live stream here for the glory of God um you know each year I like to recognize our church officers you know that have been voted in uh by God's grace and as you know you know every church is Sovereign we don't have to do an election every year especially when I see the church you know uh as the same members every year I don't really feel a need to uh you know do elections every year so that's why I don't as Pastor I have that you know Liberty to do that uh by God's grace but uh I I do like to recognize our elected leaders you know and all that they do for us by the grace of God I wanted to do it last week but you know just ran out of time there last week by God's grace so I think ID like to start with brother amen sister who would both of you come up uh sister who is just a very good helper to brother amen so if you can both come up I want you to stand up here here by Me by the pulpits and all the saints can see you here so if you just stand up here by God's grace it's that's okay sister thank you I appreciate that brother amen was elected you know as trustee uh two years ago he's been a very done a very good job very faithful yes you can step right up here I just want all the live streamers to see see you um and brother amen's been such a faithful song leader and the sister who is there to help like today she's helping with the computer uh she also helps clean the church and does so much uh for the church um and I guess I'd say she does a lot of things behind the scenes that nobody sees you know but I want I know one thing Jesus sees it all praise God Amen and so we appreciate brother amen Faithfully leading songs you know and all his trusty work he's helped out here with the building so I just want to take an opportunity and uh for the past year of 2023 to thank you for your faithful service and as we'll talk about brother B here a little bit but we got a decision this year you know our contract of Renning this is up at the end of 20 24 so have to make a decision and we'll be talking about that praying about that throughout the year U but we just want to be led by the Holy Spirit and trust these make that decision U but of course we can ask for votes as well you know we feel that by the Holy Spirit but it's a joy to serve with our brothers and sisters and we're thankful for brother amen being elected and uh being very faithful to his post of Duty and sister who being such a wonderful helper so if we can give them a round of applause let's do that by God's grace love you all God bless you Sister thank you for always helping God's Grace Just a Little Love token for for me to all you so God bless you love you the Lord thank you so much God bless you's give them one more round [Applause] you up here you can bring baby if you want everybody loves to see Andy I know the live streamers would like to see Andy one of my children told me you know every Sunday night now we go around and we say what was our favorite part about the service I think it was jevie who said uh when Andy was up here trying to touch the microphone last week that was her favorite part of service maybe he come over here a little bit of course brother Bang's been here since the beginning and uh he has a course he's been a dear friend all this time so faithful um brother and just so you know all the saints ask about you every time I talk to Jim or brother Brooks brother Brook's like how's brother bang doing I talked to him a few weeks ago he said thank God for a man like brother van being so faithful appreciate brother van and also brother amen just quiet leadership you know they're not the ra or the loud loud let's you know they're not like that they just lead by example and so I want to thank the Lord for you know amen and brother bang I couldn't ask for more wonderful brothers and helping every time I ask or send a text hey can we look at this we look at that brothers are right there to help out so it means so much and all the years together brother almost 18 years now by God's grace so in June it'll be 18 years we've had this church and then's been here since day one uh and I've told this to other people too you know we couldn't have a church without all the pillars and the pillars are everybody that comes every week and so everybody in our church is a pillar right we think about that we don't have people in and out we don't we have people that are here every single service and so we count it a blessing to have these pillars and Bang's family and uh we're so thankful for Andy to come on this year and bang sent me a text and I think it's okay that it share this but then just told me to text it's just been it's been a busier busier year for him it's been a more challenging year um but throughout all that he's been so faithful and so we want to thank the Lord for brother V all that he does for us by God's grace let's give round Applause can I give any little kiss here love you buddy then when the star PS get back I'll give the little girls you know you know how they do the uh feet washing tubs I'll give them little little token of my appreciation as well uh by God's grace but thank you to everybody for all that you do every person but especially our officers you know they're the real legal representatives of our church um so we thank God for that and as youve I've said this before but if there was ever a problem with me as a pastor you know if I ever you know got a complex or I ever uh fell into sin God forbid but I ever fell into sin I just want to remind the church the trustees you know uh would bring any accusation with two or three Witnesses of a local Elder they bring that they would bring that to me if there was ever anything that I did and I just want you to know that for the future I don't know how long I'll be on the scene I don't know we don't know how long we'll be here remember the Bible says against an elder do not receive a an accusation except with two or three Witnesses um so there's been numerous people email me over the years and they said our pastor did this our pastor did that I said they said what should you do I said you should follow what the Bible says you need two or three witnesses to bring an accusation against a local Elder which is the pastor R tells us but um you know with all the people leaving the message you know one one of their criticisms is that the pastors have too much power and in some Churches they don't have trustees which is a really awful thing um because then the pastor can do whatever he wants uh right but in our church you know the trustees and I'm a trustee as well but that's why I wonder brother amen on the board uh so now I'm outnumbered so if I ever do anything wrong you know the trustees can either remove me you know or something like that but what I'm trying to say is I don't want our I don't want our church to look like it's run by me like it's all run by me because the trustees have uh the trustees really have the authority okay but of course I'm a trustee so it's it's just interesting how that works out but that's how brother brandom was when he started his church so if you have any questions about that you know we could do a bible study on that in fact I found the paperwork from brandom Tabernacle that lists all the all the requirements for each office you know Pastor trustee Deacon song leader all these things uh and of course we don't have to mimic everything about brand Tabernacle because every church is Sovereign of itself but if you like more information on that you know uh I could give that to you and then I'm going to take that information down to Junction City in two Sundays and I'm going to give that to brother irin because the people there kind of Desiring to start a church as far as officially like having a voted in Pastor having voted in trustees a voted in uh Treasurer and so forth deacons and so forth so I just thought I'd share that you know uh for the sake we're starting new year and we're going to we wanted to recognize our officers uh by God's grace so let's stand here let's go to Romans chapter 8 verse1 I'm just going to preach a little message on Romans and as sure feel good you know Wednesday was wonderful you know what as I started going I was preaching all by myself down in my office you know but as I got going I felt more free but I feel a lot more free today CU I I have more than one I'm just I'm not in the room all by myself you know of course you know the Lord Jesus is always with us no matter where we are uh so be sure love everybody and appreciate everybody's uh faithfulness to be in the house of the Lord today that could make it Romans 8 verse1 I was studying yesterday and I thought this thought was a good thought um as you'll see we'll eventually get to the scriptures look at spend uh more time on some scriptures but let's start with Romans 8 vers1 this is part 16 that's just for my reference of just saying that we're going to save the seron Romans 8 verse1 a very powerful scripture this is the scripture brother R used when he preached invisible Union and he was talking about it's as though you never did it in the first place amen praise God so this this scripture of course ties in with other scriptures about what the cross of Jesus Christ actually accomplished for us and it's so much it accomplished everything for us and we just simply church we just simply have to have faith in what the cross has already accomplished Hallelujah Sorry God already knows here let's read this all three if we can ready 1 2 3 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit let's have one more word of pray and I've said a lot here and uh let's have one more word of prayer father God as we approach your word Lord God we ask God that you just anoint me to preach your word bless the saints that they press out to the house of God lord you said faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God lord we just want to Lord get real uh familiar with our Bibles Lord even more familiar Lord God just make these scriptures fresh to us Lord God help us to see Lord the shess of your promise that your word can never fail Lord God Lord this gives us hope for eternal life as the Bible tells us Lord God as we look at these scriptures father God surely that's what we need today we need hope for the future we need hope in the midst of sickness uh we we need hope Lord God uh for our prosperity of our health even as our souls Prosper Lord God so speak to us today give us hope for the future we pray and God let your word just transform our hearts and Minds we ask it in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen amen God bless you to being seated praise God I also thank brother Jose for this nice tie brother thanks for that I've got numerous ties I I just forget to wear brother so I got to he's giv me numerous ties over the year I just forget to wear so I said I'm not going to forget to wear this one I'm going to wear this one so the Bible said the righteous are as bold as the lion how many want to be bold today praise God just boldly believe the word of God thank you sir appreciate that by God's grace we'll be looking at Romans 81 now the first thought I had was just remember the context of this verse you know this verse again brother R use this verse to show how there's no condom Nation he uses it to show it's as though a Christian never sined in the first place amen that's based upon 1 John 3 verse 9 the seed of God that's in you cannot sin the seat of God never sinned now if you look at context remember church when this was written there were no verses written by the the words like there was no there was no chapters either right how many you know that by God's grace so that's why you know it's many times helpful to to get rid of the chapters and the verses and just read this in context so that's what I'm going to do I'm just going to go back up a few verses in front of this uh and read so uh I'm going up to Romans 7:23 but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so in context he's talking about this war between wanting to do right and wanting to do sin right yes he said this is a war that I'm going through constantly praise God and you know sometimes the wars get long like the Israel war sometimes the wars get long but how do we win church we win by never giving up praise God amen amen uh we win by finding strength in the battle righten it's like David I was reading through my Bible yesterday and just going through all my highlights and I I was back in first Samuel when when David got back uh remember David went out to war against Saul but God would not allow him to fight against Saul he comes back right uh he comes back and uh he comes back to zigg and all his two wives and all the wives of the mighty men were all taken right and how does he encourage himself the Bible said he encouraged himself in the Lord while other men were saying let's Stone David let's kill David imagine your own friends imagine your own mighty men are calling for you to be executed uh but how does he get out of this he encouraged himself in the Lord and then he said to the priest he said bring me the amen so for us bring me the Bible amen hallelujah if I got a problem if I'm discouraging if I'm running out of Hope and I've got to encourage myself bring me the word of God the word of God is the only thing that will encourage me praise God amen amen and so he asked the Lord he said Lord I'm inquiring of you should I go up and possess everything and the Lord said go and David said then then he says can I will I possess everything and the B and God said you'll restore all things amen hallelujah so David had no fear after that after looking the word of God and after after seeking God inquiring of God he had no fear the same is true for us when we want to encourage ourselves we look to the word of God God's word gives us strength and encouragement and the Bible said perfect love will cast out fear praise God Amen we're not immune from fear we all go through fearful moments but we must encourage ourselves in the Lord and we must look to the scripture and the scripture will encourage us and remind us that we are Overcomers amen and God will restore all things that were lost hallelujah amen amen amen we've all been through that before you know we lose our Zeal or we lose our excitement we lose our our strength our Vigor but God always has a way to restore that back to us hallelujah amen praise the Lord God is so faithful amen amen but notice he says I'm War I'm in a war then he says in verse 24 oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death so he's in a war he's tired of fighting sometimes he wants to get out of the war he wants to be deliver and he recognizes I'm a Wretched Man you know I had that brother Ray you know I sure appreciate Ray he sent me this uh he sent me this audio yesterday and he's like brother I'm so thankful for your ministry you know I put out the video yesterday about why brother random wore shorts and everything and he said I'm so thankful for your ministry and all these things like that but you know when I I send him back a message I'm like but when I look at myself I see a Wretched Man and that's biblical right I'm glad people see good things in me because when I see me I'm many times I'm involved in the war within my members and the church said Hallelujah see we know each one of us you know thank God Christ shines through our lives Hallelujah that other people can see the love of Christ in our lives but in ourselves we're constantly fighting a battle when will this war end when can I get delivered when when will the Rapture take place when can I get a new body praise God right amen this is what this is the context that Paul's writing in I'm in a war I want to be delivered I see I'm a Wretched Man he says I want to be delivered from this body amen but then he says I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God with the flesh the law of the spirit so he ends the chapter by saying the way I get Victory is to renew my mind amen I've got to direct my mind I got I've got to get my mind off my failures or off my my sinful desires my carnal mind I got to get off that and the Bible said when you get your mind on the word of God your mind gets transformed amen so I just love this context because you know we just I just started chapter chapter 8 verse one and I forget about what's before that Paul's just he he's he's just being honest I struggle I've got a war going on I wish I could be delivered from this I wish I got a new body I wish the Rapture would have happened yesterday right because I'm I'm battling today right I'm in a war today he said I want to be delivered this from this he said but I thank God that God can give me a new mind he can transform my thoughts hallelujah amen now with that background you go to verse one now there is now let's all say now can we now now there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah now the word condemnation there means a damnatory sentence so that would be of course the white Throne judgment when Jesus will look at all the goats and they'll say I never knew you depart from me you workers of iniquity right so the Bible said there is no damnatory sentence for you and I so that means there's a sentence of Grace for us hallelujah if we're not damned then we're blessed hallelujah amen hallelujah so we have a sentence of blessing upon us this uh it's already guaranteed Paul says we have it now hallelujah amen Hallelujah the sentence has already been declared upon your life you're forgiven you're blessed you're the child of God and get you you're a joint air with Jesus Christ hallah I want to eventually get to verse 17 I'll be happy if I get to verse 17 for today's service hallelujah oh my so I'm Waring I'm a Wretched Man but I have no condemnation whatever it's just it's just it's just par Paradox I mean that's the best word to say it's a paradox at the same time I'm Waring and seeing how wretched I am at the same time I have no condemnation yeah amen hallelujah so Church many times what does it come down to we just need reminders about God's faithfulness and God's promises hallelujah amen many times we just need that because our minds focus on the difficulties or the trials or the struggles but Paul says my body is wretched but my soul has no condemnation there's no damnatory sentence remember that takes us back to John 5 where the Bible said we have already passed Jesus said he that believes in me has already passed from Death the damory sentence unto eternal life oh it's already happened praise God yes amen hallelujah it's already for sure it's already a certain thing praise God we've already passed from death and there is no condemn ation to them which are in Christ Jesus now remember how do we get into Christ Jesus the Bible said you were baptized into Christ how many understand that let's read that Romans 6 Hallelujah verse three know you not that so many of us that were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized in his death I have the privilege to say I've seen almost everyone in this church here baptized in water that's a privilege amen other words I saw back in it was December of 2006 uh when Bo and Zur I was there Hallelujah I saw when they were baptized into Christ amen hallelujah I was there Hallelujah now the only one that haven seen I think is brother Jose but I know what happened when was it brother what year were you baptized into Christ uh November 6 1990 amen you know the day God bless you that was my day that's a red letter Day November 6th Hallelujah amen see that that that's that's as wonderful as it is when you were baptized into Christ you repented of your sin and you pass from the damnatory sentence unto the sentence of Eternal blessing praise God Amen that's how you get into Christ and it we'll prove it later because the Bible said the Bible says anyone who's Justified already has the righteousness of Christ hallelujah amen amen which proves the foolish virgin are saved and they are God's children of course they they do not inherit all that the wise virgin inherits but they are still Justified and there is no condemnation to the foolish virgin Hallelujah well she know for those foolish virgin who live through the tribulation will they have to suffer yes yeah because they they didn't prepare and so they'll have to they have to suffer a little bit because of their uh uh because of their uh lack of moving on with God it's just like Saul Saul had to suffer right but he was saved at the end praise God had to suffer that awful end to his life W that's a really good type there and remember Saul I was reading that yesterday too Saul looked at David the second time David spared his life and Saul finally says David you are more righteous than I Hallelujah the wise virgin is more righteous the wise virgin lives more closer to God more closely obeys the word of God than the foolish but both are forgiven Hallelujah both have no condemnation Hallelujah because they've accepted Christ Hallelujah in other words they've all come out of Egypt but one took their position in the promised land while the others stay down in the wilderness oh my let's be the Believers that go all the way to the promised land that say we can possess this land we can overcome these Giants hallelujah amen we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus all things are possible to them that believe am our Prophet said we can possess this land amen said we can possess it we can possess it hallelujah amen we don't stop short in foolish version say well I don't know if I can come to church or I don't know if I can pay ties I don't know if I can dress holy I don't know if I can ever overcome smoking those are words I used to say but once I got faith then I said I can overcome all these things amen all things are possible to them that believe I'll s that to my friend uh at school this week oh no I was talking there's a brother on the uh there's a truck driver I was telling you about and he just said I he said I just got to talk to you so I was I was on break and I called him up and he was shocked to know you know he's I he's watched lots of our services maybe he's watching now as he's driving I don't know but he was shocked to know that I once thought I could never overcome chewing tobacco and J that was the honest thing you know I was so addicted to that I told Christen we already engaged message Believers and I said I don't know if I can ever overcome this now think about that think about the the the demon influence that was over my life now maybe it was just unbelief right maybe it's unbelief or no doubt it's a lust of the flesh right cuz your flesh likes that sensation of the tobacco whatever but he was just shocked to to think that wow you're a preacher uh and to see God preach through you and teach and everything he said to think that once you thought you could never overcome it and I thought wow what what a I think that's a wonderful testimony because the mind of Jesse Smith thought I could never overcome this but event the mind of Christ took over praise God hallelujah amen the Bible said we don't keep our caral carnal Minds we have the mind of Christ hallelujah amen and he said he's 60 years old he said this has given me much hope praise God and I told brother no matter what you're struggling with as soon as you were baptized you were saved you were Justified amen hallelujah there was no condemnation praise God hallelujah and as you draw closer to God I said the biggest help to me was having a home church and then have to have faithful Bible teaching because the Bible says he that the son is set free is free indeed and faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God I started hearing quotes from Brother R I never knew before amen I started finding scriptures I never heard before and the more truth I receive the stronger I get the more faith muscles I got Hallelujah I don't have much natural muscles right so God give me much Faith muscles Hallelujah and I can cast out the I can cast out the cigarettes I can cast out you know the the chewing tobacco I can cast that out and then God sets us free as we stand upon his word amen amen I didn't I didn't plan to preach that but that thought just kind of came to me now the Bible says there's no condemnation to them that walk now church this is of course is not the natural word for walk this is to make one's way or progress through life Hallelujah to make due use of your opportunities so the Bible says you and I have no condemnation as we progress and make our way through life and the church said amen in other words it's not well this day I have no condemnation today I have condemnation no no once you're saved once you're baptized in Christ with real Faith you pass from Death unto life hallelujah amen now remember there's a difference just between condemnation which is the condemnation on the day of the the white Throne judgment we've all passed from that there's a difference between that and just the the guilt of needing to repent so you have to know there's two kinds of of condemnation there because remember Paul went to Peter and said you're to be blamed right right and that was that was there's a temporary condemnation but then there's a permanent condemnation we've passed from the permanent condemnation we're permanently blessed hallelujah amen we're permanently saved amen but yes when we when our sin within us falls short there's a temporary condemnation that we have but that doesn't mean we're lost god brother said God doesn't run his business way brother R said God doesn't save you if he knows he's going to lose you amen hallelujah because you're the elect hallelujah amen amen amen he doesn't sa you know well I might lose them someday God doesn't brother said you wouldn't run your business that way you wouldn't if you're running a business of a truck you know a a a trucking business you wouldn't buy these trucks knowing you're just going to throw them away and not use them no you buy the trucks and you load up the trucks yes you drive the trucks you use them you don't buy something with a plan to throw it away and that's what get God did God bought you he purchased you with his blood so he can use you amen am amen and he is using you praise God Amen whatever your testimony is shared you know whenever uh God anoints you to help the poor or clothe those that need clothes or any any Act of love any fasting and prayer arm giving anytime God uses you to do that God is getting use out of his purchase hallelujah amen glory amen so you and I have no condemnation as we make our way through life and we make due use of the opportunities God has given us hallelujah no condemnation now moving on to verse two and remember what verse one to show the that it's as though we never sin in the first place there's no damnatory sentence against the bride of Christ Hallelujah nor the fish virgin verse Two for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death okay so this is why there's no condemnation the law of spirit of life in Jesus Christ has made me free from the law of sin and death now uh free means to set at Liberty so see we are liberated from being slaves to sin hallelujah how many can look at your life and you can see I was a slave to this sin but now I'm no longer a slave to that hallelujah praise God I used to buy I I was some of the worst with music I'd buy the worst music it was all I would buy Marilyn Manson and Snoop Dogg I would buy the worst of the worst you know notorious b y I was I heard it at a store recently I was thinking my goodness I bought that well see I was I was under the law of sin and death That's the Law I live by but now I live by a different law I've got a different rule over my life Hallelujah I'm led by the spirit of life amen now I got life in Jesus Christ Hallelujah now I buy songs like all things new like I shared with you this week Hallelujah he makes all things new praise God Amen amen hallelujah so we're liberated from the slavery of Sin Sin does not dominate our lives on a daily basis now we might have some difficult days we've all had them I've had them we've had difficult weeks and everything where we just struggle but doesn't God show his faithfulness by coming around and blessing us and bringing us out of that amen amen every time every time we're trapped in a a struggle or a battle and many times like I said we get ourselves trapped in there every time we allow ourselves to be taken captive God always comes along and he's faithful to Deliver us from our own mistakes praise God Amen Hallelujah see we have no condemnation because we're we're free from the Dominion of Sin Sin does not have dominion over us praise God think about that today you got you got dominion over sin what would your flesh tell you to do today sleep in go gorge on some unhealthy Foods right right don't go to church don't pay your ties don't worship God don't sing Don't Clap skip church I mean the flesh tells us all these things but look at all the victories you already got today praise God Amen Hallelujah you know I I believe this we can get so devoted to God that it it's a uh it's not a very hard battle to bring your body into subjection and what I mean by that is every Sunday morning like even this morning I woke up and no one had to tell me you know you should fast today brother Jesse no one had to tell me that the Holy Spirit didn't have to do that it's just I knew it was Sunday and I don't even go to the food right now I'm not I'm not saying that to Rejoice like a Pharisee I fast twice a week I'm just saying brother had a fast day he fasted every Friday that's what he tells us so I'm saying you know once we overcome all these uh uh bad habits once we're really trained up in the spirit of life it's a more it's a very natural thing to surrender and yield to the Holy Spirit praise God that's I'm saying amen and if and if you're not where you want to be you know you don't have to make a New Year's resolution praise God you don't have to do that I mean talk about a rough start to the new year that's been us with all these sicknesses my my family it looks like a emergency room all my kids are laying out you know there's like five or six kids all laying out on the floor and on the couches and just like everybody sneezing coughing hacking and there tissues everywhere it looks like a emergency room everybody's sick has it's been a start to the year so it you know we just have to trust in God we have to raise up uh you know from from our discouragement we just got to raise up and say Lord I'm giving you this day praise God I'm walking to the according to the law of the Holy Spirit today praise God amen amen then you can yield you know we yield uh to the Holy Spirit each and every day now I had a picture up here but I can't I don't want to share it today but there there's two paths you either walk on the law of sin and death or you walk on the law of the Holy Spirit now I like this picture it says if you're walking by the law of sin and death the law increases under more sin and then the wages of sin is death so that that that's your old law you used to walk according to right remember the Bible said you were married to that law but that old law is dead now you're baptized in Christ Hallelujah now you've got the holy spirit in your life whether you're Justified Sanctified or filled with the Holy Spirit but each one of us are still daily Desiring to be led by the Holy Spirit but now if you're under the law of the Holy Spirit now you're not under the law you're under grace and grace imputes or gives you righteousness and righteousness then freely gives you eternal life amen so law imputes sin and the wage of sin is death but Grace imputes God's righteousness to you and freely gives you life amen amen that's the path you're on Amen you're on the path of grace and grace will give you more righteousness Hallelujah I'm talking about in your daily life God already attributes righteousness to you in heaven you're already righteous think about this church you've already got a theophany body brother Jose there's a theop body that looks like 21 you got to get your 21y old picture and share with me sometime then I'll put it up here on the screen I wish I had V I might have V 21y old picture remember all those anniversary pictures I used to show come in Jun I put bangs 21 and I'll put my 21 brother Jose has a each one of us have a theophany and the Bible said it's waiting there in the presence of God waiting for your soul to reunite with it amen hallelujah amen yes so in other words you're already righteous in heaven but on Earth God is developing as you walk as you progress in your Christian walk God's developing your character to be more righteous hallelujah amen what so what I'm saying is you have progressing righteousness on the Earth Earth but God has already imputed righteousness to you in heaven you've always been a child of God you came out of the mind of God and God's got a glorified body he's got an eternal house in the heavens with your name on it praise God Amen that's what the Bible says hallelujah if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens waiting for us amen Zion was telling me daddy why are you getting all those gray hairs in your beard I saidwell I'm getting old Zion I said but I got a a body in heaven that's got all black hair on my beard Hall if I can have a beard in heaven I don't know Sam I had a a beard when remember as the offering came up and he had a white long beard now we're promised new life because of the blood of Christ Hallelujah Samuel came up and he had a beard Hallelujah white beard white robes but that's the that's the path wrong we're on the path of Grace imputing righteousness to us and it leads to eternal life praise God hallelujah I want to show you this is what the Bible calls there's two Ministries and we're under the ministry of God's righteousness so let's read second Corinthians 3:9 you got your Bible just turn over there I just want to lay this in here and we're going to do a little bible study here by God's grace I forgot to set a timer but uh yeah sorry I forgot to set the time after this we I just want to do a I want to show you this this idea of the Bible teaching about righteousness where you already have God's righteousness in heaven but God is trying to uh mold you to be more righteous in other words to more surrender to the Holy Spirit as you walk through this life Hallelujah now one thing I you know I think I've Shar this before I think this was back in 2010 or 11 because I was at my house in doy toown and I remember that year I realized the Holy Spirit showed me I had complexes toward five preachers in other words every time i' I'd see say their name or hear their name I'd get real upset at them and then I would even talk I would talk to other brothers about them I'd say I'd say bad things about them and that's not right brother R had the same thing he said he battled a critical spirit as I remember the Holy Spirit Led me uh to repent and I called up each one of those brothers and said will you forgive me in my complexes now why am I sure because I can see how righteousness is progressing more in my life amen I don't got that anymore remember the one brother told me I was a little jealous of the bigname preachers I'm not God knows my heart I am not jealous of them I wish the best for them God has given me the Revelation that whatever lot in life he's given to me I'm content with it right amen I want godliness with contentment to be my great game amen that's the one thing I want to gain amen I want to gain thank God for all you've done for me I'm happy with what you've done for me praise God Amen of course you want to see more Soul saved don't get me wrong don't wrong you know I'd like to have you know more money so I can help more people out don't get me wrong I mean I desire I desire blessings but I want to be I want to be thankful for all that he's given me now praise God Amen I don't want to be Covetous which is idolatry I don't want to be I don't want to have Idols in my life but I want to be content with what God has given me praise God in other words that's that's one area I can see God is developing more righteousness in my my life Hallelujah now it's 2 Corinthians 3:9 for if the ministration of condemnation think about that that's what you were married to the law right we're married to the law of sin and death the ministry of condemnation be glory now remember why was it glorious because the Bible said the law was holy the law was good but the condemnation was if you break one thing you're you're judged for all of it right that was the condemnation that's what we read there in Romans right but the the law itself was a glorious thing but the Bible says soon here we'll see it it's the weakness of our flesh that couldn't keep the law right because Adam and Eve Sinn and now every person born after Adam and Eve now they got the sin nature in them and their flesh is weak how many know your flesh is weak right amen right just it doesn't always doesn't always want to obey the word of God and so the flesh can never keep the law the law is Holy but because we couldn't keep it it was a Ministry of condemnation now Church let's let's let's be encouraged let's not walk around this week feeling condemned all the time let's walk around this week feeling forgiven praise God amen amen because we're not under the ministry of condemnation G remember brother I love this St said the Christian should be the happiest person on the earth amen amen hallelujah praise God well when you know if we're all discouraged all week when are we ever going to be happy praise God and then if we're tired in church or frustrated in church or you know whatever we go through I'm not poting about any I'm not talking about anybody today you know but what I'm saying is that if we're supposed to be the happiest person on Earth because of the blood of Jesus Christ let's walk in that happiness let's let people see the happiness in our lives praise God Amen we are not under the ministry of condemnation we're under the ministry of Jesus sharing his righteousness with us amen so it's uh finishing three thank you sister I appreciate that so there there there's two there's two laws the law of of sin and death and the law uh of the spere of life there's two laws yes so we're not under the ministry of condemnation we're under the ministry of righteousness which exceeds in glory in other words Moses lived a glorious life he was under the law of Ministry of condemnation Joshua think about all these soldiers Ezra Nehemiah you know David Solomon look at all these wonderful uh Servants of God God but they were under the ministry of condemnation but you and I are under the ministry of righteousness and it exceeds in Glory Hallelujah in other words in our life think about this in our life we can experience more of the glory of God amen amen isn't that right Church think about that David flew a giant but then he also did the basba thing and Uriah but we can have more Glory Hallelujah we have more Glory because we cast down all the imagination that exalts itself against the word of God we we don't have to live our lives with that type of St on our lives amen we can experience more of the glory of God think about Solomon he saw Jesus twice he saw the theophany of God twice in the vision but then he builds all these houses to all the other false gods think about that but see our lives have more Glory than his life amen even if we don't see Jesus the Bible says we're more blessed if we haven't seen yet we believe hallelujah amen we're more blessed the Bible says it our lives should exceed in glory in other words more obedience to the Holy Spirit more power more Victory Hallelujah more righteousness because of the blood of Jesus Christ because of the New Testament because of the law of the spirit of Life hallelujah amen It's Made Me free from the law of sin and death hallelujah amen amen Church think about that the greatest man ever was John the Baptist in the Old Testament because he didn't fall like David Solomon Moses right killing a man he that's why he was the greatest of all them because he lived such a Godly life but the Bible says because the the blood of Christ now we can we can serve God in exceeding Glory we can live a more consecrated life to Christ amen hallelujah that's the word of God so those are the two laws there's a Ministry of condemnation there's a Ministry of righteousness Hallelujah now let me read the definition of righteousness for you uh from the Lexicon it's being in the condition acceptable to God yes sir so if I said you know you're righteous today brother Jose then that means God has accepted you God's not rejected you he's accepted you he said Jose is my genuine child amen I've accepted him as my child it also means Integrity virtue purity of life right rightness correctness of thinking and feeling and acting you know I get I get comments all the time people text me and say brother Jesse I'm amazed at the comments you make to people on YouTube because you're so gracious to them and yet you rebuke them and correct them so that's one thing I want to get good at brother say I want to get good at lovingly rebuking people because that's what Jesus diden Hallelujah brother say brother he makes this point Jesus never let anybody say something wrong in his presence Jesus always corrected the word always corrected corrected Mary amen that's right she said your father and I have been looking for you he said I'm about my father's business that's right and look he showed he showed kindness to his mother but he corrected his mom right every time the Pharisees and Sadducees and tried to Corner him he'd always correct them with the word of God and that's what I want to see in my life too I want to see the god giving me more righteousness where I can have the correct way of feeling and the correct way of acting I want to feel compassion to Sinners am I don't want to just be like I hate Pharisees and I hate I don't want to feel like that I want to have compassion for them right amen but yet I want to correct them as well like Jesus did cuz I don't know which ones are going to turn around and join our side amen hopefully some will join our side Hallelujah right amen I used to fight against the holy way I used to speak against the holy way and God if God can be merciful to me God can be merciful to our friends yeah amen it means uh righteousness also means Justice or The Virtue which G gives each person his due so I'm not really certain about that definition but we can clearly see when you're righteous God accepts you as his child and then he gives you the correct way of thinking and acting that's the Ministry of righteousness so God declares you're righteous you're forgiven in heaven he's already accepted you you're already go you're already accepted in the Beloved praise God Amen that's that verse I love that verse you're already sitting in Heavenly places that means your faith is in heaven Hallelujah your hope is in heaven I'm seated in Heavenly places my hope is in heaven my faith is in God Amen but on Earth he slowly transforming my character into his righteous character from Faith to Faith from glory to glory so I I use this example but last year God really gave me uh growth in my righteousness related to dancing so before before 2022 and 23 I feel a little condemnation dancing but now I don't feel any condemnation amen because I only dance to glorify Jesus amen see I'm I'm growing he's he's letting his righteousness grow in me and also know I'm not condemned if I don't dance when I come to church every service I'm not I'm not I'm not judged by that I dance when God leads me to dance amen God do something great for me I wanted to give him a dance amen CU I recognize dancing is a season remember Ecclesiastes 3 I read that I think I read that on Wednesday night there's a time to mourn and a time to dance well if I'm not mourning you better get you better believe I'm getting my dancing shoes on Amen I dance and praise the Lord and give God glory praise God because I'm not mourn there is a time to mourn but there is a time to dance praise God see and yes that's a minor yes God is God's working minor things into my character right because he's already got the majors amen right I'm I'm I'm not living in these major sins of murder or adultery or blasphemy or all these heresies I'm not live God's given us victory over the majors so God's got to make minor tweaks in our life praise God Amen oh Hallelujah bang fixes his cars all the time right he's got to do minor little repairs most of the time right brother hopefully not too many major repairs but bang has really learned to do minor repairs Jose too right you're kind of like your own mechanics because you're so you're so skilled with that right I admire that but see it's not you know if it's a major thing they might they might they probably might even do the major thing right but but under normal C circumstances they're just doing minor repairs on the car I used to be able to change my oil El I can say Amen to that one time I did one time I used to do minor repairs one time I changed my battery and uh some other things uh air filters oil filters things like that there's just minor things and that's what God is doing in our lives our lives are moving along and as time goes on God will do minor Corrections in our lives he'll do he'll help us live righteously on these minor things Hallelujah cuz all the majors are being played out praise God we forgiven we forgiven people Hallelujah Jesus said if you forgive others I'll forgive you praise God Amen all these Majors God has worked out in our lives but we're still under the ministry of God's righteousness he's trying to form righteous that's the Bible say church I like the Bible say you go from Faith to Faith you go from glory to glory the Bible says in Proverbs your life shines more and more unto a perfect life a perfect life complete maturity Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect hallelujah hallelujah see your life each year it gets slowly molded into a more righteous life but you're already accepted in heaven God already knows the end from the beginning praise God Amen but we're under the ministry of righteousness Jesus making us more righteous Hallelujah now now let's do a little bible study here get your Bibles ready here we'll just flip through these real fast here Matthew 6:33 why don't we start with that one sister you want to get that one um got your Bible there brother amen you got your Bible buddy good thank you sir uh but B you got a Bible it's okay if you're you're watching are you watching the children yeah go Caris you got a Bible yep okay let's have you three help me out so uh sister Zer you'll get Matthew 6:33 brother uh amen Romans 325 and 26 it's Matthew 633 Romans 32526 Caris Romans 4 4 5 and 13 now all these verses have the word righteousness in it and all these verses will show us we're under the ministry of righteousness we've already got righteousness in heaven God's already imputed it to us because we've accepted Christ but on Earth he's building he's progressing righteousness in our lives or I should say rather as we're progressing through each year he's making us more righteous so sister Z you want to read that one verse 3 yes 633 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added onto you amen I'm G to give her I'm GNA give her some cheers here hallelujah so see here's where what are we doing we're seeking righteousness every day so this definition is the Integrity we're seeking God's Integrity every day right especially if you got a big meeting at work or you got a big meeting at church and you really want to make the right decision that morning you better be seeking God's righteousness Lord I want to I want I I want to be so close to your word that I know I'll make the right decision amen right no matter what decision I got to make so there's the verse where you're already righteous but under this ministry of righteousness in your life you've got to seek it daily seek more righteousness Amen brother amen uh Romans 3:25 and 26 whom God has set forth to be a appropriation through faith and his blood to declare his righteousness for the remiss of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus amen praise God now this is the Heavenly righteousness can everybody see that the Bible said he's declaring Jesus's righteousness for us and the Bible says declare which means a token Hallelujah the token amen it's a sign of evidence so Jesus's blood in heaven is the sign or evidence that we are righteous it's for the sending away or the remission of sins and now Jesus is just and he justifies each one of us he declares each one of us righteous because we have faith in him praise God amen amen what a beautiful scripture so the so we're seeking righteousness on Earth every day we seek more of his Integrity more of his character but we've already got it through the blood of Jesus Christ in heaven hallelujah amen I love these truths here car going to read Romans 45 now to him for what sayith wait what was I Chapter 4 Verse 5 but to him that worketh not but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifi the ungodly for faith is counted for righteousness all right praise God giving you son now this is back to Abraham when we preach on chapter 4 so the Bible says anyone that believes in Christ with Faith remember that Faith was also a gift from God it's not something you worked up God gave you that Faith said the faith is a gift of God amen glory so the Bible says if you believe then you're Justified and this Faith counts for your righteousness so the very fact you believe in Jesus is proof that you're righteous praise God amen and then by your fruit you're known right well you might we might think what about uh the people in the CMA this morning for me what about the people in Assembly of God well if they if they got genuine Faith then they'll live a Christian Life praise God Amen right they're known by their fruits so God's able to look at each and every heart and say that one's sincere that one's that one that this one's not sincere this these These are sincere God knows if it's real faith in the word of God hallelujah amen amen now verse 13 I'll read that one for the promise that he he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith there's that righteousness again we have we're righteousness through faith in God okay now the Bible says uh here's another one let's go to Romans 6:16 I'll read some of these here we just preached on this recently but I want to give this idea we're under the ministry of righteousness this was fresh when I was studying it today so here's the Bible says uh now this is a righteousness where you're you're you're uh laboring for it in this life you're D in other words you're dying to self every day you're trying to OB be obedient to the word of God that you might live more righteously Romans 6:16 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness Hallelujah so we we're Servants of Christ how many Servants of Christ you got here amen amen because you're a servant of Christ you yield to the Holy Spirit you obey the Holy Spirit and it makes you righteous it makes you act the right way in this world Amen right but you're already and you seek that every day you're seeking obedience every day we tie that with what our sister read Matthew 6:33 so these two go together Matthew 633 Romans 6:16 it's obeying it's seeking his righteousness so you can live the right way on this Earth Hallelujah now here's a wonderful one too uh 2 Corinthians 9:9 let's read that 2 Corinthians 9:9 here's another way and you you see this often with people as they get older right uh when they get older and they get towards the end of their life you hear about some people donating their life savings to a Christian cause right or helping the poor that that's a great thing to do because here look what the Bible says as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth forever so this is a righteousness on Earth in other words we're seeking God God who can I give today what Al should I give this week or next week or this year right so the Bible says look you know this you know the the more you give to people the more righteousness you develop in your life I love that illust you know uh when you give to others when you give to others in this world it makes you it does the opposite instead of you know your hands want to hold on to it right that's what we all want to do right in part of our flesh we just I want to get every penny I can I want to hold on to everything I can but Force but but giving forces you not to not to grab it all in but to give it out hallelujah amen right like in our in our sinful nature we want to get as much as I can I I want to hold it in but the the the the spirit of Christ makes you want to give it out Hallelujah am does you want doesn't make makes you want to not hold on to everything it makes you want to empty out brother says that's right amen amen hallelujah brother said we should be trying to get we should empty out to be ready for the Rapture praise God Amen and this is a perfect example of that see we're not holding on we can't take anything with us when we die praise God right so we should be constantly trying to give out of course we have to have savings the Bible talks about grandparents can give to their grandchildren there's a great balance in that christans grandparents are really good at that they saved and they were able to give you know certain money to each grandchild right so that that's something as well you want to you want to save for all these purposes but here as you as you learn to give right as you learn as we learn more righteousness in giving to others it helps us not to hold on to the things of the world because we can't take them with us anyway praise God naked we came in this world naked will return right our bodies will go back to the Grave right but our soul will go to meet Jesus amen the righteous one who made us righteous amen hallelujah that's that that's just a good reminder about you know you can increase your righteousness in other words you can die out more to yourself you can obbey the Holy Spirit more as you give to others amen now here's a good one too Titus 3:4 Titus 3 4 and 5 so I want to spend most of the service on this idea of rightousness here Titus sorry there we go Titus 3:4 but after that the kindness of the love of God our savior toward man appear now that's of course after all our all our sins in verse three now verse five not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost so this is about that righteousness you have in heaven the the giving and seeking God that's the righteousness you develop on Earth but here Paul's talking about the righteousness in heaven we're not saved by our righteousness we're saved by Christ righteousness right but then he washes you on this Earth and he makes you live like he lived on this Earth and that's having more of the righteousness of the character of Christ in our lives now right amen see and the reason I'm saying this church cuz some churches will say you know I I've I've got accused of this recently uh some people online call me a legalist cuz I was remember I put up that video about the 25 rewards you can earn remember that video somebody asked me for a list of that I think Zur asked me for a list of that too that was a wonderful blessing I I love that message and but somebody tried to accuse me oh you're a legalist you're trying to earn salvation and what I told them was you don't understand there's two types of righteousness there's a righteousness I get in heaven not by my works but then there's a righteousness Christ gives me as he molds my character right like brother said he said may God in this new year shape Our Lives by self-control amen amen I can control this old sin nature and bring it into obedience to Christ hallelujah amen so that that's sad they just don't understand that and I think I wrote back to the the precious person I said I'm sorry you don't understand the Bible I said you're focusing on one verse what about all these others that promise Us rewards what about where Jesus said you should you should invest in your talent because I'm going to ask you what did you do with all the talents I gave you what works do you have what proof do you have that you invested in the all the talents that I gave you right what about those verses so see it's without understanding Church what I found is this like Jesus said and just like the Bible said most people few people are there are that actually find the narrow road that leads to life right very few people will actually find the narrow road that leads to life and a lot of these people they lash out at me or lash out at us they lash out us because they've been hurt by their previous pastors right or people in their family and they r at a church that was like a Brandon worship church so sad Wicked or tape only church you know or they had a church would say a denomination where uh it was a legalistic preacher and he was trying to get them to do works works without even their souls being saved right what is it uh there's that one uh oh yeah it's the Jehovah's Witnesses the reason they go door to door Church you ever have they ever knocked on your door brother B yeah amen sister the Jehovah's Witnesses ever knocked on your door at least once once Jose okay so I I saw that on the online they are only promised eternal life if they go to so if they go to as many doors as they possibly can that's why they do that because they they they're taught if you don't do that you're lost see now that's a works-based Salvation right now the truth of that is we're saved by the grace of almighty God Amen and then but the the the other side of that if we don't do what call what God called us to do we lose our reward but not our Salvation that's the truth of that church right is that right yes if God called somebody to go door to door they better go door to door or El they're not getting the reward that they supposed to get right if God called me to preach and Pastor the church and I fail to passor this church shame on me I lose my reward as long as my heart is right I still get saved at the end so as long as I Repent of my sins I still get saved hallelujah amen so that's the balance of that so that that's why sometimes we got to preach all these scriptures that's why people make these harsh comments because the the conditions that they've been brought up in were very awful spiritual conditions like the Bible said a lot of them were in cages of unclean and hateful Birds imagine that imagine going to church at a Catholic Church where there's abuse going on and it's just you're you're going to church and they hate going to church because they're in a cage of unclean and hateful Birds well see that's awful we ought to be thankful we can come and we're in a church fill with dubs yes amen we're in a church fill with Lambs hallelujah hallelujah that's why all the preachers come and say we love your worship you got you got the sweetest Church you know have the sweetest people you want to have because we don't have a cage of unclean hateful Birds we've got a cage of doves or we got a flock of lambs here amen hallelujah praise God see we're not saved by our righteousness but in our daily lives we're trying to bring our our our mind into the law of the Holy Spirit the law of the spirit of life to make us live more like Christ on this Earth amen and that's that's what the Holy Spirit does it brings us balance to all these scriptures okay now Hebrews 11:7 let's look at Noah Hebrews 11:7 I love the Hall of Fame of Faith Hallelujah and church I'll say like this there's a place for you in that Hall of Fame as well praise God there's a place in there Hallelujah when we stand behind or stand beside rather the heroes of the faith praise God Hebrews 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear now that's Godly fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith hallelujah amen see the righteousness which is by faith so faith is just Assurance right revelation of what God wants you to do because he had Faith he was a righteous man the Bible said he was also a preacher of righteousness amen amen that's right I think that's in uh it's not in Hebrews I think it's in Genesis he was a preacher of righteousness so he preached let's live a righteous life let's get in the ark amen Let's Escape salvation isn't that what we preach as well praise God Let's Escape the tribulation Let's Escape the mark of the beast Hallelujah let's get into Christ let's be ready for the return of Christ let's meet Jesus in the air at his Rapture praise God let's be ready for the wedding ceremony praise God and if we're ready for that we'll also enjoy the wedding reception and then the wedding honeymoon praise God amen amen praise God because he had Faith he was righteous and then he was an heir of the blessing of God hallelujah he inherited he had inheritance because he had faith in God's word amen now what does air mean one who receives by lot or a portion in the Messiah the Messianic usage it's one who receives his allotted possession by right of sunship so that that's how it applies to our lives We Are All Sons and Daughters of God and so our heavenly father has an inheritance to give us praise God Amen so Noah was an heir of righteousness he was an heir of believing he was a child of God so God gave him God gave him a lot Hallelujah God gave him a reward for his labor Hallelujah that's what we see today by God's grace now let's look at a few more here on this uh topic this is a a very good topic let's go to James 2 verse5 we're already in Hebrews let's go to James 2 verse5 Hallelujah James 2 verse5 hearken my beloved Brethren ha not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and hes of the Kingdom which he promised to them that love him so we're now with this idea of heirs right we have something we're going to inherit from our father most of the people that inherit from God the Father are poor people they're not the wealthiest Of The World God doesn't choose many wealthy people because they Trust in uncertain riches they're not they're not quick to give out they're quick to grab and and greedily keep to on so here we see Noah was an heir of righteousness but then God mostly chooses naturally poor people to be his heirs amen think of that this this world is fighting for uh you know millions of dollars and billions of dollars for homes that are eventually going to burn right but we get Mansions the Bible says that have no ending praise God they never get dust in them there's there's no moth and dust and rust in heaven praise God hallelujah when we get to our future home there's streets of transparent gold praise God the streets are made of gold but there's never going to be any dust there's never going to be any maintenance Gru to fix the roads in heaven praise God but who inherits those those who are poor many times poor in this life Hallelujah but they were rich in faith hallelujah amen amen amen God could teach them to live a more righteous life and they could live righteously in this present World amongst many unrighteous people praise God Amen the Bible also says let's go to this one yeah back to Titus 3:7 I wish I just would have stayed there but Titus 3:7 I really enjoy this bible study on righteousness praise God hallelujah amen Titus 3:7 so we just read five let's read six which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior see that that Mercy that washing that righteousness is shed upon you abundantly by Jesus Christ I'm glad God gave me abundant Mercy that's what I need I need abundant Mercy praise God Amen Hallelujah verse seven that being justified by his grace not by my works by Grace unmar a gift we should be made hes according to the hope of eternal life so see we're saved by grace and we're given an inheritance hallelujah amen I'm saved by grace I didn't earn it now usually we think you know we got to we got to earn it in order to have a reward right that's normally what we think but not with salvation because brother tells us even though the foolish virgin will lose all their reward they still are heirs to one thing how many remember what he said they're HS to what they're HS to eternal life amen hallelujah although they squandered much of their lives you know they have no reward but they still are heirs to something they're heirs to eternal life praise God am think about Saul again my goodness think about lot he at least stood up against the homosexual gender he at least stood up with it and called it wickedness well he's got he's got some inheritance he's got eternal life praise God MH the Bible called him a just man remember Church let's let's always remember his testimony he chose to every day live in torment now our lives should be different like Abraham we should not be living in torment we should be living in the peace of God yes amen there is no price you can put on peace like one time I watched a video of Tom Brady uh and all these other famous guys and they're like they're like wow you have millions of dollars you have a beautiful wife uh you've won all these Super Bowls are you content and in every case they said no this this didn't make me happy I watched that video Deion Sanders he thought once I win the Super Bowl I'll be happy and you know what after he won the Super Bowl you know what he did he took his car brother B and he tried to commit suicide he drove off the cliff but God stopped him there and he didn't die this is how empty these people are you know the devil likes them trying to tempt us well if you just had more this and more money and more houses lands and we'd be more happy no sir no sir it actually makes you more uh it makes you more uh selfish it makes you more discontent right because I mean they're on the interview saying that and all these rich people say all these millionaires they say I wish I never would have got famous because now I have no privacy I can't even go to the store people are begging me all the time for uh autographs and all these things like that they said I wish they said uh I wish I never would have got rich like this and famous my what what what good lessons to learn at the beginning of the Year Praise praise God to to be content with the things that we have praise God and to remember Hallelujah if we have the righteousness of Christ if we have God's abundant Mercy Hallelujah we should be the happiest people because we know our inheritance isn't on this side our inheritance is on the other side praise God amen amen hallelujah I'm I'm I'm not telling you not to increase your business or increase your investment that's not what I'm saying I'm saying is what I'm saying is that we should not ever think that our we're actually going to be satisfied with attaining worldly things on this Earth we will never be satisfied with things on this Earth we don't put our hope in this world we put our hope in Jesus Christ amen amen so see if we are Justified this is why foolish virgins have an air an inheritance the Bible said if we're Justified we're hes that I'm going to read that again being justified by his grace we should be made HS according to the hope of eternal life all these things all these uh all these uh accomplish m to the world they never satisfy there's no righteousness in them praise God there's only righteousness in Jesus Christ Hallelujah just a good emphasis on these scriptures now go to Hebrews 1 verse2 I want to show you of course I want to remind you who inherits all things Hallelujah Hebrews 1 verse one God who at sued times in diverse manner spake in time past under the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world praise God Amen the Bible says God lets Jesus inherit all things think about that the Universe the worlds the future home Hallelujah the Earth Jesus inherits all things and then he gives out your inheritance as well based upon your obedience to him praise God hallelujah back to the parable of the talents Hallelujah let me pull that up there the Bible says that if we overcome remember if we overcome in our age we inherit the Tree of Life escaping the second death we eat the hidden Mana the white stone with a new name power to Ru rule over Nations think about that which one of us you think would rule over Nations the Bible said the most humble of us yeah it's the most humble the Bible says the least esteemed in the church right the least esteemed think about that I wonder which one of us are going to rule over the area of North America the Nations right the Bible said you'll rule over Nations if you can overcome sin now he makes you a ruler over a nation so if you don't if you and I don't get elected as present which we never will be we don't have to worry about that God could still have us rule over a nation one day yes MH amen amen because why because of the righteousness that we have now in Christ Jesus we're living a righteous life now we've just seen it this week remember did you see how they released some of these names that were going off to these evil Islands you know these were leaders of Nations Bill Clinton yeah right leaders of Nations caught with the unrighteousness of the sinful world but you and I if we have the righteousness of Jesus Christ we won't rule over Nations now we'll over them later right because we turned down sin we we uh we avoided sin we overcame Hallelujah by the grace of God also Saints we get the Morning Star we get white rment white clothes Hallelujah we get our name in The Book of Life the last book of life we become a pillar of the temple of God in the New Jerusalem we get Jesus's new name we get God's new name name we get the new Jerusalem's new name written upon us and we sit with Jesus in his throne sometimes it just seems impossible how is this all going to happen to me I don't know I don't know how it's going to happen to you and I but if we live righteously the Bible said eyes not seen ears not heard all the things that God has in store for them that love him praise God Amen I don't know how God God's going to do it but God said he do it praise God Amen so what are we living by we're living by the promise of God amen amen almost an hour and 10 here so bear with me here let's remember church if you are faithful over five talents and you get 10 talents he makes you ruler over 10 cities Hallelujah Luke 19:17 Jesus says the Overcomers get power over the Nations I would think Martin Luther is going to rule over many nations because he defied he defied Italy and Rome brother Jose amen and he was from Germany too I I think he might rule over Italy and Rome in Germany because he defied those Nations those kings and the pope and everything he defied all of them and he overcame this man will rule over Nations and the Bible said he'll rule with a rod of iron Hallelujah so God has Jesus has many rulers beneath his rulership As We Know hallelujah what wonderful promises now let's go back to I'm going to close this thought maybe give me five or 10 minutes to close I going to close with this thought on Romans 8 let's go back there Hallelujah now we're at 8 verse well I'm just going to skip ahead here because I don't want to read through all that I'll read through that Lord will Sunday or next uh Monday or next Wednesday sorry I find this verse here yes go down to Romans 8:17 I'll close with this close with a few thoughts here by God's grace there's so many wonderful things in the Book of Romans as I showed you at the beginning brother used Romans for many of his important sermons even with the fist seal he used Romans chapter n so Romans 8:17 and if children then heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together now here's the hard part of being a Chris the suffering yes yes none of us we want we want to know him in the pover resurrection as Paul said but we've also got to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings and that's the suffering you get for being a Christian the rejection from F friends and family most notably right or other church friends or being rejected by other churches or even Sinners and heathens whenever we're rejected or or uh mistreated by people just for being a Christian the Bible said that's the suffering we must go through in order to one day reign with Christ Hallelujah I'm going to read 18 as well just to encourage you anybody we know I know we got some people suffering physically uh and that's also part of it as well but remember Verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US praise God amen amen amen praise God the suffering cannot even compare to the glory that's in front of us and I'm going to use this example again brother amen being rejected by his family think about that the suffering of being rejected now of being just kicked out of your house saying I don't want anything to do with you the suffering of that is not worthy to be compared to the glory which our brother will receive from Christ amen hallelujah praise God the suffering of being rejected it cannot compare you know as as as our brother's been rejected here on Earth well then surely then he'll be accepted in heaven there'll be a great welcoming for our brother amen that that's his testimony that's his God God wrote that testimony before the foundation World God ordained this testimony amen no matter how we're rejected down here we will receive the reward up in Heaven praise God Hallelujah the sufferings now are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed in US think about that church the Bible said you're a joint air with Christ how many how many understand that joint air let me look up that word joint I don't remember that if I looked that one up yet I don't think I defined that one joint air means a fellow Heir one who obtains something assigned to himself with others a joint participant Hallelujah so that means we get some of the rewards that Christ gets because Christ suffered and overcame we get rewards if we suffer and overcome amen I think even brother brother Jose you know he's got to he stands he's the only one in his family standing for this message right that there's suffering that goes along with that you've had many difficult conversations with your family right brother yeah yeah thousands yeah numerous times we prayed for you brother for those for those conversations we know you're going to go have we know you're going to have them but the suffering of this present world isn't worthy to be compared with the glory that we shall share with Christ so because we've stood for Christ we we we stood against friends and family that the Bible says we receive a reward with Christ we're joint HS we both we both inherit something for overcoming this reminded me of 1 Peter 3:7 you that are married the Bible says you both get rewards you get a joint reward together for your ministry together 1 Peter 3:7 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the I'm sorry yeah giving honor unto the wife as into the weaker vessel and is being a together of the grace of life so there's rewards Vang and CIA are going to are going to earn together because they they worked on through the family together in each married couple see so I I love this God gives us rewards on Earth for those of us who are married because we work together with our spouse but all that is is a foreshadowing of Christ in the church hallelujah amen hallelujah what the Bible say There's No Greater Joy than to see your children walk in the truth right amen amen so when we see our children serve God that's a reward you that's a blessing and the reward goes to the parent well the same thing is true with Christ and the church praise God hallelujah as the bride is faithful to the husband Christ then there'll be a reward shared because it's a marriage they did things together amen church if I ever did anything good for God it was because Christ was in me praise God it wasn't because of my goodness it's because of my faithful Lord my faithful Savior praise God remember he said apart from me you can do nothing but if we ever accomplish something it's because our husband worked through US praise God amen amen amen because Christ was working in me the hope of glory praise God Amen yes so see we're join a just like a husband and wife inherit certain things because we work together we labor together we serve God together so it is with Christ in the church I was just remind this I heard A good sermon yesterday uh I was listening to brother Donnie preach and of course I know there's things we disagree a lot of things I disagree with him but I enjoy many of his wonderful messages Matthew 10:40 I'm going to read this I got a couple more verses Matthew 10:4 Look what Jesus told the apostles when he sent them out so our brother used some real good scriptures I appreciate this message he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me amen amazing truth amazing truth Jesus said whoever I send whoever receives that person I set it's the same as receiving me hallelujah amen let let's be let's be encouraged by that today praise God anyone that receives us if Christ has sent us how many know Christ has sent you praise Goden I didn't want to preach the gospel I wasn't I didn't want to come to aan I didn't know aan existed right B didn't know nothing about this message none of us knew anything about this message God came looking for us praise God to live the forward of God hallelujah amen right and now God sends us out to our families our workplaces wherever he said God God is sending us out and whoever receives you receives Christ Hallelujah that's exactly right because remember now go to Matthew 25:40 people can receive you just by helping you out when you're sick I love what brother Donnie said brother Donnie said today we have another chance to visit Jesus did you know that that was such a good reminder to me today you have another chance to feed Jesus how do I feed him when I feed the least of his Brethren I've done it unto Jesus that was such a fresh reminder to me yesterday like oh my goodness that's right I can I can do something good for Jesus if Jesus is here but amen uh and he didn't have a house do do you think you and I would try to make him a house or something like that we try to go get apartment real quick wouldn't we if Jesus didn't have a car brother man and he was here today what do you think you and I would do we'd probably go get him a car wouldn't we right and the that just struck me yesterday when he was preaching I like wow that's right Jesus is here amongst us he's in his children yes and whatever we do to jesus' children we've done that to Christ amen amen Lord I said Lord take any put the eyel back on my eyes so I can see Jesus sitting out there in the congregation Hallelujah and all the Jesus uh all the representations of Jesus we have in our home homes right the sick that are our Saints right that are sick at their at their houses right now Matthew 25:40 I'm in the wrong yeah I'm in the wrong CH yeah verse I'm going go go to 34 then shall the king say unto them on the right hand Come Ye blessed are my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world see these are the these are the foolish virgins that there was a kingdom prepared for them because they inherited eternal life yeah and they get to be part of the kingdom of God for out for for throughout all eternity they get they have a part they have a lot in this Kingdom remember brother R said the bride is with Jesus throughout all eternity he said but the 144,000 are servants to the bride amen think about that everybody has a degree everybody's going to have a position in heaven the wise virgins they're going to be the bride the foolish virgins are not going to be the bride according to the Bible looks like they'll be the attendance to the bride y right now the millenniums hold separate thing I'm not sure exactly how that works out but we know what the future home entails the Bible said will ever be with the Lord hallelujah amen right 144,000 servants to the bride look at this here he says because he tells the foolish version because I was hungry and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me a drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me praise God hallelujah we have a chance today to feed Jesus to visit Jesus Hallelujah of course he's represented in his children praise God Amen that's right joint ears the Bible says we are joint hirs and then God will reward us for anything we do for his body for his people what a promise how many enjoy that promise today let's stand to our feet by God's gra brother amen if you'd like to come here I'm going to read this last quote brother R uses the joint airs in the Ephesian Church age chapter one and this is under the the the section where it's Revelation 2 to him that overcometh will I eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God and brother Ram says this and now to these sons of God who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of God think about that we live in Satan's Eden right now but if we're faithful to Christ he'll give us a paradise Hallelujah to live in amen amen now I I might I might say this sometimes our services feel like paradise sometimes fellowshiping with b and amen and all the same sometimes fellowship with him out there feels like paradise so we get a foraste of Glory to line here but after we pass on to the next Dimension with our new bodies the Bible said we inherit the paradise of God we get a perfect atmosphere to live in Hallelujah a perfect home perfect family perfect Fellowship that's the reward we get for overcoming the wicked one now he says he says and we get the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ now he remember I'm getting to to Joint air so keep that thought joint air you inherit with Jesus so you get fellowship with Christ that's part of your reward I don't know how he's going to do it with all these millions of Christians brother B but I know if anybody can do it he can do it how's Jesus going to fellowship with you and me and each one of us I don't know but all things are possible amen hallelujah he'll do it he'll fellowship with us by God's grace there will never be any more separation from him wherever he goes the bride will go amen what what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship that's why he shares the the rod of iron see that that's why he shares he has a rod of iron but he shares that Rod of iron Hallelujah the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known Hallelujah we'll know all the secrets of History right and people will know us by what we are we're a seed of Christ we're a child of God hallelujah we're a joint air with Jesus we shall be like him this is the heritage of the Overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ let's have word of prayer here Heavenly Father we thank you for the word of God today bless your people they've been very
