========================================

brother Brandon I'm sorry in the series on this song The Coming of the lord The Rapture mystery I want to look at a we'll probably take a few services on this one kind of review some things and hopefully bring out some fresh thoughts here by the grace of God so we look at uh the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery that's how that second verse ends the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery now I see God in Simplicity that'll be the next one Lord willing and that final one will be the spoken words Original Seed that's a six-h hour sermon so that's going to be a long series but I'm just joking we'll hit the highlights by the grace of God that's a very memorable sermon U if you know anything about that with a pick up your pen and WR portion so uh let's go where brother Ram brother Ram started in 1 Thessalonians 5 vers1 I think that's the same text I took on Sunday night at the Bible study we looked at the Antichrist on Sunday night 1 Thessalonians 5 vers1 brother raam's text was uh verses 1-5 and then he said just look across he said geographically across your Bible across the page and then he read the verses on the Rapture the shout voice and Trump so we'll do that tonight I'm going to try to just keep the sermon short I said I'm going to try so I'm going to try by God's grace we kind of see how the uh poll goes here by the grace of the Lord I'm turning there so thank you for your patience 1 Thessalonians 51 I'll read 1 through four and then we can read verse 5 together but of the times and of the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety now don't we need safety with all this news coming out my goodness hasn't it just been more magnified the days of Noah hasn't it been magnified then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief I love how the bible promises us and Escape praise God I'm very thankful for that we know sudden destruction is coming but he said You shall Escape Hallelujah there's Escape Hallelujah now verse uh verse 5 let's read that on three 1 1 2 3 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness praise God may God add His blessings to the Ring of his word you can be seated there I also love verse 9 verse 9 is one of the most beautiful uh uh scriptures about the Rapture in fact if I'm not mistaken uh there's a pastor I know I listened to his sermons he quotes verse 9 every night before he goes to bed uh because he wants to be reminded of God's grace for God hath not appointed us unto wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ what a great scripture to quote before you close your eyes right God doesn't have wrath for me God has Mercy For Me amen hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace all because him all because God called you to grace you didn't earn Grace Jesus said you didn't you didn't go looking for me I came looking for you it's all by God's grace Hallelujah God's amazing Grace and we just got to let God have more uh uh have more uh I'd say leadership in our lives or have have more uh Authority in our lives uh we want to give God his way Hallelujah we want to give God the preeminence in our lives I'm looking for the right word there now uh on the same page in chapter 4 brother Ram then read verses 14 to or I'm sorry verses 16 to 18 and I guess I need to say this I'm preaching uh from the sermon the sudden secret uh going away of the of the church brother man preaches in 1958 because uh as you may or may not know I would probably guess you don't know uh because if you haven't done this study yourself and I'm not saying that to make you feel bad but if you just haven't done this study there is no sermon called the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery I looked okay uh we have uh 1 two 3 4 five six seven eight sermons with the word coming in it and none of them are that specific title okay uh but then there there are sermons like the great coming revival the the second coming the second coming of the Lord living dying buried Rising coming he preached that twice the oncoming storm the signs of his coming and the flashing red light of the sign of his coming right so in the song You Know The it's it's strange in that song they listed nine sermons well this one isn't the exact name of the title of the sermon okay so I'm just going to pull I'll just preach a few sermons on the Rapture that I think are the CL closest right okay so that's what I'm going to do now there also is no sermon called The Rapture mystery but there is a sermon called The Rapture from December 1965 there's only one sermon with the word mystery in it and that's Christ is the mystery of God revealed right from 1963 so whoever wrote this song You Know Kudos on writing the song but you know you got one title that's a little off you know it's not the exact uh title of a sermon just thought you'd be interested in that so uh we're on the six sermon I'm sorry there's eight sermons in this song we're on the sixth one we preached on the recognizing your Dan's message we preach on serpent seed we preached perfect Faith uh we preach the breach and we just preach the message of Grace eight sermons on the message of Grace how many enjoyed the message of Grace what a what a phenomenal series that was by the Holy Spirit praise God uh just thankful to the Lord for his mercy and the grace of God hallelujah so again there's no sermon that says the the the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery so this is the one I thought I would uh preach is from 1958 the sudden secret going away of the church um and uh again he ended this one with a story like he did the message of Grace brother ended the message of the grace with that story of the King's son who was killed with a spear right and then they found the man who did it he was in prison um and then the king wanted to have mercy on him and because the man asked for Mercy remember the story he he went the king went and destroyed all the records and made this murderer his son and put his son's clothes on him and his ring on him and made him his own son that's that's our story Hallelujah for all have fallen short of the glory of God Amen there's none that seeketh God no not one Hallelujah I've never heard a preacher use that story before William have you there's another witness there see people like they like all these stories where it seems like well we didn't do we're that pure woman who never sinned right that's true in one way that's true in the soul amen but in the flesh and the mind we sin daily and we're we're unworthy in in our in our flesh and our in our minds praise God but that's why I love that story because it proves we're all guilty but God showed us Amazing Grace amen God had pity on us as a father pth his son so the Lord pth his children praise God thank God for pity amen hallelujah God showed pity on us amen so uh he ends this one uh with a story as well I'm going to set a timer uh so I'm going to set for 45 minutes Hallelujah now I'm going to read brother am's opening prayer to this sermon again 1958 the sudden Seeker going away the church let us bow our heads in a moment for prayer Lord we like we say like those of old I was happy when they said unto me let us go to the house of Lord we can find no better place to be today than to be right here with the congregation of the Lord in worship can you find a better place to be would you rather be uh on a Wednesday night would you rather be down at the Applebees today where' you rather be the best place you could be is in the house of God though it may be raining outside now we got nice weather and there may be miseries and things but when we're in thy presence we have this smile of satisfaction that we know that you understand and are working everything just right for us amen he keeps praying we would ask this special blessing this morning on those who were unable to get through the service so I have to pray for those who are working tonight right brother Amen brother Vang probably brother Jose sister C is probably watching the kids tonight you know he says many perhaps would have come if the weather had not been so bad or they didn't have work but may they find consolation in reading your word and listening to ministers on the radio oh we've got one of those right it's called the internet now and programs that are designed for those people so look even Brother's Day those were the programs designed for the people that couldn't come to church radio read your Bible internet read your Bible and the church said that's what they're designed for that's why they're out there Hallelujah we would ask that you would especially bless those who who are in divine presence that are here for their effort coming forth this morning this evening to hear the word of the Lord and to minister to him in Psalms and in prayer and in Thanksgiving Hallelujah so brother mam said especially bless those who came to church right Hallelujah and we ask God that you will touch the bodies of those who are sick and needy and who are just waiting just now has come a long distance to be prayed for I'm sorry I made a note on my phone I want to pull it up real quick there it is okay yeah just made a note I just took a picture of it so I didn't have to scribe it all out again he says uh they've come a distance to be prayed for and we ask that you would just look upon us and speak to us that we who are here this morning should take inventory of our own situation and say search me said one of the prophets and try me and see if there be any evil in me now that's quite a prayer right to say God if there's any evil in me Purge it out of me amen right it's quite a prayer and then Lord in your searching if you find that there's evil in US Purge us Lord as we humbly confess our sins and our evil doings and he closed The Prayer by saying this and we ask that you remember us as we I'm sorry as you look at Jesus so he's praying to the father and he's saying look at us as you look at Jesus amen who died to be a pritu that means the wratht taker for our sins and our iniquity as we confess that we believe that he died for this purpose and rose again that we'd have the grand privilege of doing this this morning Grant it Lord and speak to us through thy written word as we wait further to hear from you in the name of Jesus we pray amen so that was brother Ram's opening prayer now friends tonight I'm not going to get to the mysterious part of the Rapture in this sermon I imagine I'll get it to in part two or part three now the fun part which I'm excited to preach now fun I should say fun the exciting part I'm excited to preach is the part where I told you this summer that Tucker Carlson did an interview with a country singer who was a worldly country singer or now he's a Christian country singer if that's a thing I mean might be and uh and he went on there and he told Tucker there's no such thing as a pre-tribulation Rapture so I'm excited to I I'll probably show you the I don't think I'll show you the videos in here but I'll show you the the screenshots of it and I'm excited to preach on that and you know what he attacked brother William he attacked the Scofield bible my my Bible I took it personal do you know church this is the Bible that brother Ram had when the angel of the Lord met him in 1946 he said I'm taking nothing in there he told he told ma he said honey if if I never come back he said if God don't answer me you're going to be a widow I'm going to die waiting in that cave until God answers me why I'm seeing these Visions what's happening my preachers are telling me it's the devil but I don't understand it it looks like God's doing doing something I'm going to die I'll die in there trying waiting on God to answer that's what he told his wife and the only thing he took in there was this Scofield bible Hallelujah a prophet of God Amen and God answered that Prophet am glory to God Amen now Scofield wasn't perfect he's a trinitarian as you know but he had a lot of things right and for me personally I love him because he had those 11 New Testament Mysteries but I found another I found 12 so Scofield means a lot to me brother William it's his inspiration brother R preached serves this the end time and then in that sermon I saw oh there's only 12 called mysteries in the entire Bible and brother R come to finish the mystery of God hallelujah so to me this Bible means a lot to me and I'll eventually get to that uh scoffield part maybe Sunday uh maybe next Wednesday by God's grace we'll see how the Lord leads and of course we'll get to the shout voice Trump that's kind of the mystery behind the Rapture other than the timing of the Rapture all right now what's interesting now look how humble brother Ram is when he preaches this and this if you receive this this will help you appreciate a preacher who maybe uh didn't have enough time to study the night before look what brother Ram says he says I want to take a text for this morning the sudden secret going away of the church let me announce it again because I haven't had very much time to premeditate on any comments but just Hing this is what I love about brother BR he's so honest he said I hurried to get the sermon ready and I hurried into service this morning well why brother bradam let's find out he said we were out late yesterday and never got in last night till real late so he was out with his family doing something and rushing down here this morning and church I've been to I drove by his house it's only like a it's not even a mile from the church but he's got a rush down there to church you been there probably don't remember but you know we W remember all the details but he but this just came to my mind so I didn't get a chance to study last night necessarily I just rushed in here I heard in here and I just wrote down some thoughts he said but just maybe later I might catch something that would do someone some good and I love this subject the sudden secret catching away the church so this is how he starts the sermon what a way to start the sermon it wasn't I prayed and fasted all day and I I studied all week at the library like he did for Daniel 70 weeks he studied at the library all week for those sermons all week he said he shut in uh for a whole week before he preached the uh uh the seven Church ages and then he did shut in for nine straight days for the Seven Seals but this one he just says I had to rush in I was out late didn't get a lot of chance uh to study and premeditate so I like how brother random is so honest Hallelujah and lets me know even a prophet Glory even a prophet don't his time schedule doesn't always work out perfectly but what does he do does he Sher the duty and say well somebody else better preach no if it's his calling if it's his time the Bible said God will help you in season and out of season amen ought to be encouragement to you well I didn't have enough time to fast and pray last night well that's okay you can still pray for the sick just pray with a sincere heart you won't always have uh all the time you want to do something right you won't always do now always try your best always try your best to give time to reading prayer uh but but but don't uh but don't don't neglect your duty don't neglect if God's called you to pray for somebody or witness somebody don't don't neglect that just because you're in a hurry or is a busy time of life Hallelujah that's why Paul said be instant in season out of season how many times have I come here not a lot of time to study now today I had a lot of time I studied all week and had over an hour and a half to study so it's been a good study by God's grace I've enjoyed it amen I'm looking forward to preaching amen I'm not rushing in here know some nights I do some especially on Wednesdays uh but not not not recently I've had a lot of time of course the summer took plenty of time to study and preach and pray all these good things but just showing the balance hallelujah it's a good thing now brother R goes to the next thought the next thought is about the sick that are in the church he says uh this is an unusual thing to speak a subject like this when I come down to minister to the sick so it's supposed to be a prayer for the sick service he said but there's a greater sickness Than Physical sickness so he's going to pray for the sick but he's going to preach on the Rapture because he wants them to be well spiritually before he prays to make them well physically amen hallelujah and it's much more essential that we be well for this great event that just fixing to take place if if it was just fixing to take place in 1958 what about today praise God he thought it was just fixing to take place Hallelujah and look what he look what he'll say here that it would be even to be asleep in the Lord or dead as we would know it it's better to be ready I'd rather be a sick man ready with the Lord than be a well man not ready to go with the Lord see Church no matter where we find ourselves you know lyi Mal they're listening let's get make sure you're right with the Lord while you're sick okay everybody should realize that whether you're whe whether you're sick or well make sure your soul is right with Christ Hallelujah if you're backsliding with a major sin by God's grace get right Hallelujah as we preach on Sunday if you're backl in a major way get your thoughts right Hallelujah get your get your thinking right get your anointings back Hallelujah get the spirit of God back on you amen am Hallelujah don't walk in Disobedience don't turn and go the other way in your thoughts keep your thoughts on the Lord Jesus Christ it's the sweetest Fellowship you'll have all day Hallelujah so think about God that's right he says but however it may be God is so willing that we will both be ready and well soul and body so brother God's willing we want to be healed physically and be ready spiritually and then he quotes the scripture uh Psalm 103 for he forgives all of our iniquities and all our diseas and heals all our diseases he died for a compound purpose amen I've always been blessed by that brother maybe brother William can help me later on but I think it's in Mark chapter 8 how Mark quotes Isaiah 53:4 can you pull that up Jesus was healing the multitudes he was doing Miracles he was multiplying bread and fish uh he was casting out devils and and and and Mark says Jesus did all this in fulfillment of Isaiah 534 surely he hath borne our griefs so even before Jesus died they were beneficiaries of his future crucifixion that's right right before the sacrifice was even made they were already drawing dividends on God's promise amen that I don't understand that but it's true praise God they're already drawing Ben benefits on a promise that actually hadn't been uh carried out in the literal sense getting benefits of a future promise I feel like that's where we're getting we got the Holy Ghost we got the down payment amen we're drawing benefits on the body change the adoption to it the EMP the Redemption of the body praise God we're already drawing benefit brother say when you get healed physically that's a sign that you'll be in the Rapture that's right because your body's already experienced the down payment of what you got in your soul praise God your body gets healed because you're already going to get a body changeed amen Oh Glory I love it amen by he says he's already bore your Greece and carried our sorrows so those are your mental mind battles right there the Sorrows he's already carried your mind battles far away your backslidings right and yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted and one of those words is either that one that one means both physical and mental pain and stress I don't I don't have the notes in front of me I'm kind of just shooting off the hip I'd say like that you know just going from memory because I just read it this week I was like oh my goodness that's right they were drawing benefits on a promise that actually hadn't been purchased yet you know by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ right just like you know like I told you God can do whatever he wants Enoch was raptured before Jesus you know 4,000 years before Jesus you can be raptured under the blood of bulls and goats see because the sacrifice doesn't limit God's power God can do whatever he wants praise God God can still forgive him with the blood of bulls and goats and God could show a Rapture because you can't stop God's plan amen it's impossible pra God can do whatever he wants amen and if Enoch was raptured on the blood of bus and gos then let us believe he's going to Rapture us under the blood of his son Jesus Christ the Holy Blood of the Son of God the Messiah hallelujah oh gives us a good a good consolation doesn't it brother William we got a good I'm just going to call you lot tonight okay brother brother Austin doesn't make you feel good brother I don't want you to shout too loud of a sleeping little child there though I mean sometimes they sleep through it you know I've had plenty of things plenty of time that happened to me now he goes on to the next thought he says now now he's starts breaking into the Rapture so he talks about you know uh that first how he's busy then he talks about um making sure your body's your Soul's right first even if your body's sick and then he breaks into how people their attitudes their bad attitudes towards the Rapture he said says when I was thinking on today on this subject people live today as though just before the coming of the Lord Jesus if he was going to send a host of angels down to all the newspapers or us uh social media accounts right x uh if he's going to send a host of angels down to all the newspapers or social media accounts for today and for a year or so announc it throughout all the world in the newspaper that on such and such a date Jesus will arrive brother R said that's how most people think think they're going to get a warning in every newspaper or on every social media right post better get ready for the Rapture better better get better get ready for the Rapture and he thinks they'll they think they'll have to broadcast it by the radio and put it on the televisions and everywhere just the day and just the hour that he was coming that's the way people live today isn't that right they people will live in sin because they think well I'll hear about the Rapture before it comes and then I can conf rest my sin and get ready to go in the Rapture no that's not how it works and the church said you can't live in sin and expect to go meet the sinless one you ain't going to go meet the sinless one unless you're trying to live sinless I said trying Hallelujah that's right you got to try you got to cast down everything that exalts itself against the word of God you got to try you got to try to live holy praise God God sees your efforts remember Peter twice said all diligence everybody say all all diligence ready all all that means all your effort all your earnestness but brother said people live like they're going to get an announcement on their phone okay uh got a couple days for the Rapture better get ready the Bible said it comes like a thief in the night nobody knows thief and night uh how many times Austin happened to Austin recently how many uh how many times Well when I lived in akaran I go to bed real happy I wake up in the morning somebody broke my window in my car a Thief got me in the night other one time I had this nice bike and I didn't lock it up huh honey remember that honey what a shame that was that was a nice bike too I woke up I go to get on my bike there's no bike a thief got in the night it's my fault I didn't lock it up I thought well I don't need to lock it up around here I'm pretty good you know no I'm pretty bad pretty bad area and that that's what the world right those thiefs didn't you know text me and say uh you might want to lock lock up your bike tonight I'm coming pretty soon I'll be there in a few hours no thiefs don't do that and look Jesus don't do that either because that Thief represents Christ Christ is no Thief he's taking what belongs to him amen but he's given us an Insight a thief would never let you know he's coming that's right right and that's how Jesus is going to come he's going to come at a time when the people don't think he's going to come Hallelujah now we know there're going to be uh there's going to be a lot of uh Wars right because they want peace and safety there's going to be a lot of violence lot of Wars but they're not going to think Jesus is coming but we know he's coming praise God the king is coming Hallelujah that's a good song that they were singing on Monday Jesus Christ is coming back Hallelujah and we will not be caught off guard as long as we keep our lamps trimming clear the foolish virgin did not uh was not prepared did not have her lamp did not have extra oil wasn't prepared they she knew it was coming and the type of that is brother brandom's Ministry brother R's Ministry is to shout get ready Jesus is coming back brother randam was the Forerunner to the second coming just like John was the Forerunner of the first coming amen the Midnight Cry is gone out get ready the Jesus is coming get ready to go out and meet him so we better get the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen amen we better be born again we better have everything trimmed off amen Simon preached and I listen to his sermon and he said with that storm last Wednesday they lost power he said he said' thank goodness my wife Beth uh had an oil lamp and he said I was up there for a couple hours cutting these huge branches off his neighbor's uh garage and he said he just watched though over the minutes the light got weaker and weaker and weaker he said it's time to trim that Wick Hallelujah he said what a reminder praise God in the in the storm ah in the midst of this storm Amen in the midst of of America falling apart in the midst of all these things we better make sure our light is burning bright praise God Amen we just have to do that praise God what a good reminder that in the storm you know we can even see how our light will fade if we don't go trim it up if we don't go make sure this is burning as brightly as I can go can I say like this I I should preach as hard as I can preach and really mean it and I should I'll say even better I should try to keep I should fight sin in my life with everything that I have praise God that's what for each one of us you should fight sin as hard as you can with every single uh ounce of energy you have keep sin out of your life Hallelujah that that that's going to be trimming your lamp praise God watch and pray pray as often as you can even if it's just in your car even if it's a on the drive home pray Hallelujah right whisper a prayer pray to the Lord amen sing to Jesus get the presence of God on your life praise God we got to live like he's coming hallelujah amen remember we're Children of the day we are not children of the light Hallelujah glory to God and then brother said see but God has said in his word it would be like a thief in the night coming it would be so people would say as the world thinks today oh there's just plenty of time it'll be well announced he said but you see it is announced but it's a secret announcing the world's looking for oh announce announc it brother I said well it is announc but it's a secret way it's a whisper to Jesus's bride amen hallelujah he's Whispering love secrets to his wife amen it's almost wedding time Honey Hallelujah is everything ready Hallelujah he's whispering to his wife to get ready it's a secret announcing it's just those who are willing to hear it he said those who are willing to consider it who loves the Lord I think of what Paul said there's a crown I think it's 2 Timothy 48 because I did it at bible Club on I taught Bible Club at the middle school on Tuesday I think it's second Timothy 48 there's a crown yeah henceforth there's a there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also also that's you and I that love is appearing now keep it up there you know I didn't know what to preach I was going into I 6 it was 6:30 brother uh brother William and I was like what do I teach these kids and I just looked at my desk and I saw my two state championship rings I'm like I'm gonna preach on those today I just put them on and I go down there and I said and I just preach on this uh I just preached on this you get a crown of righteousness I said where' I get these rings and they said oh you were a champion that's right I was a champion nobody cares anymore though it's it's more of a burden than anything uh but I said you know I had to labor to win to win these championships I had to stay healthy and church we need to stay healthy if we're going to be Champions Hallelujah right I remember my my my junior year before we uh won the football state championship I was getting cramped up and they said why you cramping up and I said I don't know they said have you had any bananas lately I said no and I I was I was leaving at really crucial parts of the games I was all cramped up and my mom's like oh that's right yeah you need to eat some bananas I forgot to eat the bananas I ke I started chugging I was eating bananas every day and then the rest of the the the the season never cramped up one more time we won a state championship see I had to take care of myself I had to stay healthy we got to stay healthy on God's word amen don't feed on things of the world don't feed on sinful things feed on God's unfailing word praise God hallelujah that's how you be in the best shape amen the best shape of your spiritual life that's right but I showed those boys and those girls I said look I'm a champion because I said really because of God's grace but I said these things are going to fade away and I said can I touch one of your heads and I didn't touch there was only one girl there there was eight boys one girl I said can I touch your head and I went around like this brother Willam can I touch your head I said if you're faithful and you win this battle I said Jesus is going to put a crown on your head just like this is that the word of God yes the word of God God wants us to be a champion of what the righteousness of Christ because we have none of our own but if we yield to the Holy Spirit if we obey the word of God we get on his righteousness praise God I I went around each one I said you'll get a crown of righteousness if you follow Jesus Christ you'll get a crown of righteousness you'll get a crown he offers it to all of us and the announcing is going on right now praise God he's announcing You Can Be A Champion as a spiritual Champion a champion of the faith and see and brother M said he'll get to later everybody's afraid of Jesus coming back we should be the opposite we should love Jesus coming back oh come quickly Lord Jesus amen come to your people make us ready Hallelujah now I know we got to make ourselves ready but remember we can't do it all on our own we got to be yielded to the Holy Spirit praise God now it's a th thief in the night it's a secret announcing because we're the children of the day brother Bram said usually the people think that appearing of the Lord is a horrible Dreadful thing my goodness he says oh the world might come to come to us and say don't talk to me about that they'll say they don't want to know about those things they don't care about them just for the present day living that's where most people live they just live for today they're not living for the Rapture that should be our goal is to live for the Rapture Hallelujah now we do have to do some adjustments right brother William when we first come in the message we think the Rapture is happening tomorrow right we got to use a little wisdom right we got to adjust the ship a little bit you can't put you can't just wear yourself out and go head long forward you got to have some endurance my wife smiling at me you got to have some wisdom or your Zeal is going to eat up your wisdom right like I told you those before but one brother told me uh he didn't go to college you know because he thought the Rapture is going to be soon and he he had a lot of hard jobs till he finally found a good job I mean he struggled financially he'd have to move in with people if he just would have kept going to college he could have got a better job no I'm not saying but but they were trying to tell me not to go to college because the Rapture was going to happen well here we are 23 years later Hallelujah and the one brother said the Rapture is going to come so I'm not going to build a or I'm not going to dig a uh a basement in my home and then I we were joking a few years later he said I wish I would have dug that basement see just you know what we got to do Church we got to pray and find the leading of the Lord remember I I showed you that sermon from questions answers brother R said preach like it's going to be 10 years from now but live like it's going to be today amen so you you you have permission from brother Brandon make a 10-year plan you have permission okay I I'll say it from me from a preacher because he said preach it you have permission from me a preacher make a 10-year plan but then live spiritually like you're going to go in the Rapture tomorrow or tonight or you might wake up in the sky amen well imagine that brother you going to bed singing about Jesus or going to bed just Lord help me to get ready for tomorrow uh and then you wake up I'm in the air I got a brand new body praise God there's Paul there's Silas there's Barnabas amen there's Mary there's Joseph there's brother Ram Hallelujah and will ever be with the Lord amen what and then the Bible says that two will be sleeping in a bed one will be taken one will be left it's going to happen to somebody praise God amen amen it's going to happen go to sleep thinking about Jesus wake up with Jesus we're going to see him in wide and robed and wide in all his glory what a way to wake up amen my goodness but the man said uh what if one of your loved ones some of you older people so brother William Brother William what if your mother or father that's passed on and had been away for so many years and you know they might appear any time why you'd have your house all cleaned up brother Bram says you wouldn't just be laying around well I'll just take the day off no no if you knew your loved ones were coming if you knew Mom or Dad oh you'd get everything in order M I want to be ready I want them to see me at my best amen praise God Amen I want everything in order I want them to see like I was ready for their coming amen like I love when you guys come over because then I got to do some extra cleaning right we always joke about that it's kind of like a good stress I got to really clean up my office this time and I really got to clean up the outside you know I kind of like that cuz I could do a little deeper cleaning amen and that's the point he's making here he says why you'd have the house all cleaned up you would just be ready and watching down the road every car light you'd think it'd be them is that Mom is that Dad amen is that Grandma is that Grandpa brother said that's the attitude we should love their appearing amen we should love Jesus's appearing Hallelujah come to me Lord Jesus the only way we wouldn't is if we're living under condemnation and we just preach on that on Sunday so you don't have to stay backsliding God said I will heal your backslidings amen I'll heal you praise God see it takes a spiritual healing he can heal you from sin he can heal you from iniquity he heals us from idolatry he's the great physician Hallelujah the sympathizing Jesus Hallelujah remember he just said return and bring words those words are the calves or the sacrifices of your mouth amen and say forgive me I'm guilty it's my fault Wash Me In Your Blood let's have Fellowship again and the fellowship will come back hallelujah oh how many times that happened to me brother I've been serving God only 24 years how many has times that happened to you buddy amen yeah all the time you know we we we fall short and we make mistakes and God's sweet Spirit comes right back to us just like Samson look at Samson prostitute and then Delilah sold out his Nazarite vow and God still comes back and anoints him for one more powerful move of the Holy Spirit just once more praise God talk about a backslider coming back amen hallelujah praise God Amen God loves the backslider I'll say like that if they repent Hallelujah brother says next that's the way the church ought to be watching for the coming of the Lord all in order all ready all packed up and ready to go as soon as he comes now other quotes say you got to unpack to go up he says here pack up but other quotes say unpack ah I'll just say like this packing all the anointing Hallelujah packing all the anointing in your thoughts in your mind make sure your Soul's got the anointing of the Holy Ghost the bapti of the Holy Ghost packing all the anointing but unpack everything you don't need Hallelujah unpack all the cares of this life unpack any grudges Hallelujah unpack any Temptations just leave it all down here get ready to go to see Jesus Hallelujah I love it amen glory he says because so there's a because you got to unpack because he says it'll be in a moment in a twink of an eye he said just try to time how long it would take your eye to twinkle not not even blink but twinkle so there's some type of a some type of a light upon your eye that fast that's how fast Jesus is coming coming back he said that's how quick the Rapture of the church will take place he says you know the enemy always uses the tactics the Lord uses he says you know when he seen that God was going to have a righteous church and the things he was going to do the enemy used the same strategy he's got a church so Satan has a church and he's got a people that's very religious aren't they how many know a good Catholic that's very religious right a Baptist very religious right uh 7day Adventist very religious Mormons very some of them are very religious he says and they're just right on the toe as religious people because he knows that Christ Church is the same way but remember church I'll say like this they're ever learning but never able to come to the truth what is the truth the truth is thus sayith the Lord the truth is thus sayith the Bible the truth is thus say the Lord this message is the truth we have thus say the Lord on marriage and divorce the Seven Seals right water baptism the godhead we have thus say the Lord on all these things that's the truth they're able to learn knowledge about stories and history and uh maybe some nice patterns in the Bible but they don't get the truth thank God for the truth we've got the truth amen I know I was raised in a Pentecostal church we didn't have much truth I know truth when I see it praise God amen amen and ain't speaking in tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost praise God that ain't the truth amen anybody can speak in tongues live any kind of Life praise God but anybody who has Jesus Christ in their soul they can only live one kind of life that's a dedicated taking up your cross and following Jesus life every day of your life hallelujah amen hallelujah I didn't expect all this Zeal tonight amen hallelujah so because you're watching because all's ready because it happens in a moment twink of an eye right he says got Satan has his own church now brother R breaks into the story he spends about five or 10 minutes on this story how many know about Pearl Harbor 1941 December 7th a day that will live in infamy it's the day where the United States was attacked by Japan it started started uh the United States getting into the War World War II and then World War II but what I read was 35 to 65 million people died just in that war alone now brother R breaks into the story because he's talking about the sudden secret coming of the Lord and He brother Ram wants us to be ready brother raham uses this he says I was just reading on the sudden attack of Pearl Harbor that wasn't no exactly unknown attack how many know that there was numerous warnings even months in advance that the Japanese were planning a surprise attack now they did some of them I read one where they did send some of the ships out to sea just in case there would be attack but other than that there wasn't much done they they thought oh it's not really possible it's not likely they're going to attack us another problem was they had to translate some of the the codes they got the the Japanese codes but they didn't took them so long to translate them my goodness you know I I don't you don't don't you think church if they had have been praying if they had been seeking God don't you think God would have helped them to know unknown tongues don't you think God could have gave him interpretation God God knows all languages the article brother R said I'm sorry the article brother R read it said that most of those people most of the soldiers were on leave to go out to parties and party on a Saturday night and they had had numerous warnings you know just Japanese are coming all this information there's a surprise attack coming sometime and brother Braham read a story and the captains let most of the men go out now there are many still on the ships right especially if you know about the USS Arizona Lord have mercy but you know there was there was a lot of people still on duty and on station but a lot of them just went out to party the night before brother said there was threats from uh the Japanese in the water and in the air and there was a time for they were exactly in line for the invasion but they ignored it on the whole brother said that's the way it is today with the church the church is in line for judgment now not the bride but they're ignoring the coming of the Lord so that you can't so he says so that you can't blame him no one's going to blame God because God's sending warning he's sending preacher after preacher Allelujah or sermon after sermon right all even these signs with Israel and and Hamas these are all war right the devil is trying to attack God's people you can see it plainly said you can't blame them now brother said he read one story where uh they were in a Tavern or a bar this is the story he reads he said a man went down and uh a soldier sat down he's off duty and the bartender said hey do you hear the rumor he said no I don't believe I did he said uh there's something about a Japanese Fleet coming this way then he said young beautiful girl silly girl bounces up and sticks her foot up on the bar so can you imagine she's got a skirt on you imagine she's showing off her nudity yes that's right yes and she said oh you gloomy headed warts don't you know that we're here for to have a good time and not not talk about war he said isn't that just the way the world's saying today about the coming of the Lord you old-fashioned fogy back numbers what makes you dress and act the way you do uh sister Christen why are you dressing like that because the Lord is coming brother Jesse why don't you uh grow out your hair long again and take off your shirt and wear shorts uh because the Lord's coming he's coming I want to be ready praise God I know how he expects me to behave and the church said I know what the Bible says I know how the story ends Hallelujah also know how the story story finishes up too praise God I know how the Gentile Church must act he said 'th World calls us you oldfashioned fogy back numbers he says' but we're looking for that sudden secret appearing of the Lord for there's something in the air listen he says a message of the Holy Spirit am that tells us the coming is at hand Hallelujah and church every age remember every age has to live like it's coming in their age if not they'll get lukewarm and backside on God so for 2,000 years they've had to believe like look at this sign look at this sign the coming of the Lord is soon but one of these days it's going to be their turn one of these days they're going to be exactly right amen hallelujah one of these days it is going to be the final final days of before the Rapture and how many want to be ready by God's grace amen I don't want to take a break on God I don't want to act like it's not I want to be ready right I want to plan for 10 years financially and physically hopefully in 10 years I can have my house finally paid off you know but I also want to be ready spiritually all my sins are confessed I'm loving Jesus I want to see Jesus amen I'm not afraid of the Rapture I'm welcoming the Rapture praise God glory amen he said it was I read that night they took a beautiful built young girl stripped her clothes from her put her in a little wagon with only her underneath garment on so her underwear and run her down the street and so forth just having a big old time and all the time the Japanese was gaining grounds coming right on while they're you know getting their lust of their flesh on playing and hooping up getting drunk the enemy's on the way they've been warned about this story brother Bram read and shared the next morning the men that was on the post of Duty the airplane signal watching and so forth had they'd been out now this story now not all the men were out drunk but you know he's he's headed for this story the men were out drunk and running around with these women and so forth they were so drowsy when they set up the next morning from the big party until they were caught asleep on the job the first bomb exploded at 7:55 a.m. on a Sunday morning they knew what they were doing because Americans didn't work now back in those days now they do today but they don't work they didn't work on Sunday back in 1941 so they planed it out the devil always knows when to attack you but don't forget God knows he's coming amen don't be scared of the devil God's Got Your Back Shadrach meshack in to go he's got my back amen hallelujah just be ready for his coming stay faithful say as your post of Duty oh Watchmen on the tower amen hallelujah we need a Watchman on the tower we need men and women that are watching for the coming of the Lord hallelujah but with this particular article most of these men were sleeping at 7:55 because their drunkenness and their immorality with women they were caught asleep on the job we won't be caught asleep at the Rapture I refuse to do it I haven't given my life to this Bible to be caught and go in Tribulation I'm Living For The Rapture praise God that's why I break open my bible every morning I can try to pray every morning I can because I know there's life in there I know God's word is real hallelujah it's God's love letter to us brother William it's a love letter he said I'm afraid that's what it's going to be likewise at the coming of the Lord the church is so took up on the I'm sorry took up and drunken with the cares of the World Church you got to care about the world in a little bit but don't give all your care over to it like I gotta I got to go pay the insurance I got to do this I got to pay the mortgage yeah you got but don't don't care about it too much than you have to don't care too much about it where you don't give time to talk to your savior you don't give Time To Worship the Lord every day or crack open his body Bible and said these are so true I never want to forget these brother that's how we should Lord I want to read this I don't want to forget this Lord keep it in my mind but most importantly put it on the fleshly tables of my soul praise God I want to be ready I don't want to get distracted by the things of the world I got to deal with them but I can choose not to care as much and not let it control my life but Let Jesus Christ control my life amen what a story the church is so drunk with the cares of the world till they're going to be asleep at the post of Duty at the coming of the Lord see the foolish version they're going to miss the coming of the lord they're going to be in darkness in church aren't they in darkness I mean there's good don't get wrong there's good people in there but they are in darkness how this week another Mega preacher Prophet fell to sexual sin and he's already married and got all these kids how many preachers have fallen this year already this that was the guy who tried to reach out to me he wanted to collaborate with me I'm like I'm not making collaboration with any false prophet he was trying to pretend to be like brother brandom he was using the internet to try to be like brother Bram and discern people's hearts and lives he would always have to check his iPad then he' say do you know does anybody know this number this I mean you can just find that you can find all that information on Facebook they're Facebook prophets and that's a false prophet right but he fell this week he's already married uh but he he prophesied to one young woman and got her in a car they got in the car together and they did their immorality and it finally come out and then when he when he resigned it was like well uh I hope someday you'll trust me again he I mean he said sorry but it was all about him it wasn't I'm feel so sorry I mean he said sorry a couple times but it all about I hope someday you'll come to my school and and you know it's $2,600 to learn how to be a prophet from him $2,600 to try to be a prophet I'm sorry El never had to pay Glory Elisha had never had to pay 2,600 but he had to sell out everything amen he had to sell out his his his livestock amen he had to sell that out and he had to follow Elijah he had to follow the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen he had to sell out his family not sell out his church and reputation to make $2,600 from somebody try to teach him to be a prophet you're born a prophet amen hallelujah you're born a pastor you're born a preacher you're born with the gift of faith Hallelujah where am I trying to get to oh here's what I want say 755 was the first wave there was actually two waves of attack from the Japanese they sent out the second wave one hour later it began on a Sunday morning when they should have been at church but you know most of those guys were not a church most of those women were not a church 300 153 Japanese planes led to the destruction of I'm sorry the death of over 2,44 people in one Sunday morning what a rebuke on the nation there's my okay oh yeah I'm almost done I'll close probably after this story here now the US was able to recover a little bit they only shot down 29 of those 353 planes now what's sad is 1,177 of them were all aboard the Arizona of the USS Arizona and that over a thousand people died in one vessel one ship so almost half of those people were people were men and soldiers that were drowned or uh exploded on the USS Arizona 68 civilians there in Pearl Harbor were killed because of these uh attacks and like I said just as soon as uh the the first attack stopped the second wave came all because they didn't heed the warning all because they weren't praying and looking at the signs they weren't watching and praying and the church said you know the same thing happened kind of on September 11th 2001 I remember that I was in class and on my way back I remember there was something I forget what was happened at had a 7:45 class I always had 7:45 classes and it was only like a 50-minute class I was on my way back and when I got to the house the guys are like Jess sit down yeah I heard like fire sirens going off on the W walk home I'm like what's going on this kind of weird you know and as soon as I got in the house the the other guys's like sit down look at this on the TV the first plane hit the uh North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. 17 minutes later the second plane struck the South Tower 2,750 people died in New York City there was a message person well I'm sorry he was a sinner he was working there he backed from the message church after he saw that he came back to the message and he saw he said it was a conspiracy theory I'll just say it like that it was set up and that brought him back it also uh helped him to uh his girlfriend helped them to make up and get married now they have a happy family because he was living in fornication 2,750 people so more di more people died at World Trade Center now that seems wrong but that this is what I got off of Britannica so I don't know if britannica's wrong forgive me 184 people died at the Pentagon when the Pentagon was struck and then 40 people died in Pennsylvania out in the field where that third plane landed church this is what happens when people don't take heed to warnings right now nobody's perfect I'm not putting any shame on anybody I'm just making a point brother Ram draws this as a lesson this is how the enemy is going to try to attack a surprise attack but nothing's a surprise for God am and the thing to do Church Our Lives is say God strengthen me strengthen me so when the next trial comes the next snare comes I'll be ready to overcome I'll be ready for it amen right and I found that with all of our trials in our life it seemed like God beforehand would always give me a scripture to warn me if I just pay attention if I if I just pay attention like Simon text me on a Monday he said just he said uh the devil's just threaten us threaten us within a week I'd got threatened with money things like I I forgot that's right Simon warned me I had you know I said amen to it but I didn't really pray about it if only I would have prayed a little more praise God but the point is God gives us warnings but preach a sermon God always sends warning before judgment brother Ram said if you won't heed to warning there's only one thing left that's judgment if there ever was a time this America was ever at its lowest e it's right now now think about what it is now all these years later goodness gracious he says it's indifference toward the gospel the gospel's been preached from Shore to Shore signs and wonders have been performed great Miracles have been done they continually go in there revry drinking ignoring making fun of Christianity brother Braham said out of the 200,000 pulpits in America I'm sure we have a lot less than that now all these churches is closing what we need today is those pulpits is prophets of the Lord who's not afraid to blast out God's Thunderbolts of judgment upon this generation of sinful people that we're preaching to amen what do we need we need people preaching the judgments of God this is what God's going to do get ready get ready to escape Hallelujah you can escape Hallelujah if you're willing to get ready praise God Amen that's what brother R says we need Thunderbolt BS preaching God's Thunderbolts I love it when The Thunder Rolls while I'm preaching amen not here tonight yet but I love when that happens he says we need Thunderbolts to give out the warnings like Isaiah Isaiah said a wicked generation oh how he did condemn that generation and tell them the oncoming judgments he said but too many of our ministers are afraid to say these things I'm not I've always preached the Rapture is going to rescue us from the awful tribulation period now it's not going to get awful really to the second half right because the first half they can't lay down the mark during the first half because the 144,000 got to be alive to get the Holy Ghost and you know the 144,000 won't take no mark of the beast and go to hell because they're going to get the mark of God the Holy Ghost amen there's going to be pressure before the Rapture about this Mark but it's not going to be po it's not going to be uh actually uh pushed out to the people to the second half remember not one trumpet can blow till the the seal has been sealed in the foreheads of the 144,000 Hallelujah Revelation 7:3 people need to read their Bibles they say the trumpets have already sounded they need to read their Bible they're ignorant of the Bible they got to read the Bible amen I'm being a little harsh but you know I'm saying maybe it wake somebody up sometimes you need a good rebuke to wake you up how many can say Amen to that I need it too brother sometimes I need somebody to just whip rebuke me into my face or rebuke something you know get a good reminder Hallelujah he said they're scared to give a direct witness of warning for would mean some of their jobs I'm glad that if this church closes down I still got a job by God's grace another words I'm not afraid to preach you because oh I'm going to get less ties or I'm I'm not going to have money I got enough money to thank God I got enough money to feed my family I don't care if anybody come if you want to leave you want to come or go you can come or go whatever you want to do I'm here to preach God sent me to Aran praise God a preacher sent I didn't ask to come here God sent me here amen I didn't even know existed brother William they said akan wants to give you a full scholarship where's akan where's that what how do you pronounce that Acron what I didn't even know it was on the map amen like where is that place I didn't ask to come here God sent me here amen God sent you here hallelujah praise God he said but some of that would mean their jobs if they preached too hard they have to leave their pulpits he said perhaps take another stand at some other Church chur or something but it's just too bad we got those kind of people in our pulpits I'm glad we don't amen we need men like John Wesley of the early Reformation Martin Luther we need some people like Paul who's willing to give it all and to surrender their themselves even it means separation from this life as a witness of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ did you know John Wesley was kicked out of every church early in his ministry every church he had to go preach in the fields and then there was mobs that would come and try to beat him up and break up is he he got beat many times and he have to just you know run away and get away from the mobs beat him up and all he was preaching was you can leave live a Sanctified life you can actually live by the power of God you can live a clean life unto God and all these other guys are serpents and Vipers they're a brood of vipers well no wonder they kicked them out of their churches he's calling them serpent seed Hallelujah same thing happened to Martin Luther Martin Luther stood stood there and said he said the shall live by faith and I think it was the Council of vers if I'm not mistaken but the the the leader there of the church it might have been the Pope I don't remember but he condemned him and they were taking him out they were arresting him but then some of his supporters did a pretend kidnapped they broke in kidnapped him they dressed him up like a knight Hallelujah Soldier he's a real Soldier he's a pretend Soldier there but he's a true champion of the Gospel hallelujah amen and and during that time when he was under arrest when he wasn't on the night Duty or as a night he would go there and translate the Bible from Greek into German and that helped bring us a Bible too that's 1519 if I'm not mistaken we got the King James in 1611 God knows what he's doing church God if if God's got a job for you he's going to save you from arrest amen or like Paul he might use you when you're arrested to write the Bible or we won't write the Bible but you know God has the purpose for everything Hallelujah God is in control we saw that with Daniel Shadrach Meshach and Amo even in the midst of Babylon God's spirit was mightily with them why because God's not a respector of person if you call on God God will answer you amen hallelujah and we know Paul's testimony of suffering Shipwrecked five times beaten three times 39 strip or 29 Stripes was it 39 39 Stripes each time Hallelujah out in the sea many nights and days he would get robbed all the time Paul would get stuck up and robbed what do they call it now when you get uh robbed what is it called mugged yeah you get mugged or you know pulled up or stuck up what do they call I forget you get mugged Paul would get mugged all the time give me your money give me your money you mean God would let his Prophet get mugged yes you mean God would let his Prophet get whipped on the back and bleed and almost die and get stoned but God healed them from the Stone Church God does things that we're not always aware of sometimes we have to have confidence church as this Rapture ears or as we get closer to death whichever one it is we got to have confidence God's in every detail of Our Lives amen amen he and his grace is sufficient in our weakness Hallelujah he's letting things happen so we'll learn to trust in him if he could trust think about that 39 times brother if he could 39 times they ripped his skin off his back 1 2 3 4 and then that happened a couple times if he can trust Jesus in the midst of that why can't we trust God in the midst of our Trials of course we can Church let's just be more let's be more sincere praise God he says what he said today education and societies and little he says frenetico delicate things I don't know what fral means uh delicate things of societies in their own feelings has took the place of the Holy Ghost in the church see people don't want the Holy Ghost they just want their feelings to feel good I tell you you'll feel really good if you get the Holy Ghost amen you get the right feelings amen hallelujah what we need today he says it a second time what do we need today he said what we need today is to cry out to America is a godsent god-filled men he didn't say man good glory there it is I'm going to go send that to Jeffersonville he said what do we we need God filled men because they say it's a one- man message I'm sorry we got quotes there's one man yeah there's one Prophet there's one messenger but then there's all the fivefold ministry under him he said we need god-filled men filled with the power of the Holy Ghost who's not afraid to cry out against that thing that's wrong and warn the people of the oncoming judgment let's
