the reason we came is to worship You Lord God receive all the glory today in Jesus Christ the church said he must remain standing to take our Bibles here let's go to our memory verse Matthew chapter 5 here verse 3 Matthew 5 verse 3 we'll go three to twelve by God's grace remember psalm 119 verse 19 says thy word have I sorry 19:11 thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee let's recruit these together as we as we can by God's grace Matthew 5:3 2:12 let's begin on three one two three blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you praise God let's read one more scripture if you go to first Thessalonians 5 verse 21 let's read that again I'd like to preach again on prove all things this morning part 3 verse essence 5:21 so we said last Sunday this is right after Paul's text on the rapture and encouraging the Saints that they will not taste of the wrath of God but they've passed from death they pass from wrath and death unto life and he tells them these last parting words in this letter Matthew I'm sorry 1st Thessalonians 5:21 let's read that on three one two three prove all things hold fast that which is good may God add his blessings agree of his work may be seated I'd like to take as said a few more sermons on this and kind of prove why you know we follow brother Branham and kind of answer maybe questions that you've heard I know I've heard a lot and so I'd like to continue look at these things you can switch over I do have some slides to show I just want to remind you of a few things here you know the Bible says Jesus said the Holy Ghost will bring all things to your remembrance as you have need of it and so we were thankful for that and some of these things I'm just encouraged as we are reminded of them the Lord is so merciful you know again I made this video a few years ago and why believe brother bran is and I guess you could say is still a prophet like Samuel still was a prophet even after he passed away but as far as in the land the living we would say he was a prophet because he's no longer in the land of the living David speaks of that the land of the living so I made that video you know three prophecies a brother Branham and I found five you know I'm sure there's more but there's at least five requirements for a genuine prophet live a godly life of holiness Paul talked about that remember he was trying to prove to the Corinthians that he was a real man of God he started the church but then wolves had came in and tried to persuade them that Paul maybe wasn't a faithful man of God but he went through his list of all the things that he did he said you know other preachers can have wives he said I could have a wife but I don't have one he said other preachers you know take the tithes and offerings he said I don't do that and he goes through all the reasons why he lived such a godly life of holiness and it was to to make sure that he was not a shipwreck praise God he said he had to beat his body and bring it under subjection so Paul realized in his experience to keep himself pure he had to sacrifice more and I think we can gain a great lesson from that that we've got to be able to sacrifice to keep our sincerity before God because as time goes on our bodies get more tired our minds get more tired we're prone to be lazy if we're if we're not sacrificing praise God if we just give and it's we don't feel the pain of it then there's no sacrifice we have to feel the pain of sacrifice that was the power of animal sacrifices because they would raise these animals upright and they would love these animals but then to see the firstborn that you know the firstborn lamb at the Passover the firstborn lamb the most precious lamb the one that you loved the longest to see that one died a year old to see that one die and give its life would have such an impact on the owner and the family and so that was the power the animal it would it could cleanse the flesh but it can never purge the conscience praise God so the sinner would offer would offer the sacrifice they would feel bad they know they'd be forgiven in their flesh but their conscience would still be plagued knowing that they they they left feeling the same way towards sin as when they came but we've got a greater power than that amen thank the Hun we've got to let the presence of the Holy Spirit be dear to us praise God that we don't we don't we won't see the animal sacrifice but we've got a we got experience the the spirit of Jesus praise God the spirit of God sacrifice his Holy Spirit to renew our minds praise God and to renew our walk with the Lord so Paul had this way of holiness about him proving that he was a genuine prophet but also he taught the Word of God in his purity Paul said if anyone teach anything other than what I first teach or taught rather let him be a curse in Galatians 1 and every preacher should have converts to Christ as fruit of their ministry praise God you know I just had somebody call me yesterday I didn't get a chance to come back but a couple years ago when I preached out Minnesota a sister came out for prayer afterwards I remember her name but I don't want to say it because you know people might talk but she called me yesterday left me a voicemail saying you know of all the preachers she said you stand out to me you know I appreciate my pastors she said but you stand out to me as a real man of God she said can you call me back and I got a question for you so I haven't really caught her back because I I want her to ask her past her first you know before she calls me but you know she still remembers the ministry from three or four years ago that the Holy Spirit brought there and that that's fruit of our ministry you know our lives your life my life should speak and influence others praise God you know we're in the age of the you put YouTube age where you know what they call themselves you don't youtubers call them some creators if they call themselves influencers and Bella Bram preached a message influence hey before they call themselves that Amen that's what we are we're creators were minor creators and were minor influencers amen praise God they're just stealing it from us cuz we are the original ones I'm talking about believers praise God every believer was a minor creator praise God was a minor influencer and that's what our lives are to be if we're supposed to have fruit to it we should be able to look back at our lives and say my the Lord has used me to influence that person the Lord has used me to help that person and those are fruit to your ministry praise God and then also prophets now this is genuinely a prophet requirement not not most of us but prophets reveal the secrets that were previously hidden praise God and that's one thing brother Branham ministry has clearly done and we're beginning to that more as we go to the believe this side right now we're on the Jeffersonville kind of false teachings but we'll go Lord willing we'll go to the believe the sign ones after that and that's one that they really fall off and they really miss that one a lot of course the Jefferson bill will follow a lot of these but they'll actually exalt brother Branham above where he should be exalted because they he doesn't deserve any exaltation he deserves honor every person deserves honor but Paul said honor all men and were to give them honor which means respect in the fear of the Lord in other words we don't exalt we should prefer others above ourselves right we shouldn't say oh I'm better than that preacher or I'm better than that sister no we should we should prefer them above ourselves that's giving them honor praise God but not worship and not exaltation and they should have the anointing of the Holy Ghost for Supernatural signs and prophecy so I kind of put signs miracles and wonders and prophecies as one I think just to save room I think on that study but brother Branham meets all those requirements praise God that's why I know he's a genuine prophet of God now I added this list a couple weeks ago I actually forgot the seven seals I put that on there totally that was one of the major secrets that his his ministry revealed all these mysteries all these uh all these truths that were lost are now restored by the Ministry of God's profit you know this morning I was just looking at Baptist ministers and different ones I used to follow and they still they still don't believe that Jews can be saved like right now they though they believe Jews will be saved 144,000 but they don't see it now why don't they see it because they don't have the revelation of the fifth seal because God has got to show that that the souls under the altar who quiet cry out for revenge and do not have robes of eternal life those have to be Jews because Christians have eternal life now and don't call out for revenge that's a great mystery that they miss and so all these truths are lost and God had to send his prophet to come in and finish all the mysteries of God amen hallelujah thank the Lord so this is why I believe because he met all the requirements praise God but as I showed has been showing the last few weeks and over the course of my whole ministry I've always been who showed how brother man's a man just like I'm a man just like you're a human you know his mistakes and mine and anyone we have at least three causes we could have our own personal opinions and me wrong we can just say an honest mistake we can just make an honest genuine human mistake but in wrong but it's not a sin other than being wrong or we can have personal sins where we actually purposely sin right and that's what we showed on Wednesday night hopefully got the chance to listen that program purposely sin he purposely lied to the IRS he knew what he was doing you know and he admits that and so you can put these you know at least in his mistakes in at least one of these categories but remember Church you don't we're not we're not making program look bad we're not trying to do that but just trying to show that he was man and he was fallible but with thus saith the Lord I still believe he was infallible like st. Paul like Moses like Isaiah right like Haggai and Zechariah any true prophet of God is infallible with thus saith the Lord and so I'm I was reminded of 2nd Timothy 1 verse 8 I don't have it up here but be thou therefore I'm sorry be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord so that's Christ nor of me his prisoner praise God so Paul says don't be ashamed of my testimony now I've said this before but imagine you know you're in Jerusalem and you're worse when you're a Christian in the days of Paul and you talk to maybe your neighbor and you find out they find out oh you're one of those Christians and you know there are staunch Jew and they kind of corn you and say oh how can you be a Christian when Paul you know he he used to try to eat just to take some of you guys to jail and now he's on your side and he was that were there when Steven was mark how can you be a Christian some of your own followers you know kill people and were put their death and so Paul's saying don't be ashamed of my testimony and you'd have to have the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to tell your neighbor yeah Paul was he had a made bad decisions he made mistakes but the but the grace of God has extended the Paul I'm a him in the same grace that extended Paul is the same grace that saved me amen glory he said don't be ashamed of me and my testimony as his prisoner praise God as I said last Sunday you know I kind of went through that list of other preachers you know that that the believers who made mistakes you know how John saw the vision of the the dove but yet he doubted the Messiah and Peter denied Christ before the Holy Ghost but after the Holy Ghost he didn't want to eat with Gentiles and kind of it was discriminatory and that there's so many more things that that people did but you had to be able to look past that and realize God allowed that to humble that person and God allowed that so we wouldn't exalt a man we wouldn't exalt flesh above what we're supposed to right we wouldn't give extra honor to people so so God allows brother brand to make mistakes to show that he's not God just like you and I make mistakes and so these are the purposes here or at least the causes rather of the mistakes that the brother man makes and and I let me just show those from Wednesday I don't know if everybody got a chance to listen to it but I just want to go show those quotes real quick about exaggeration but a man admitted that he he would exaggerate yeah hear this he said so now I want you listen the last two nights I'll say this may God help me not to exaggerate but just be as honest as I believe from my heart he praised and said God helped me not to exaggerate he's I'm not very good at making or estimating crowds because I usually exaggerate on it so brother man realized he had this human behavior where he'd often exaggerate and he asked God to help him not to exaggerate and so you've got to keep this in mind you know as you as you listen and as we grow but there's a fresh thought I just want to bring out a little more of a thought I had this morning and as I read this I started crying at my computer I just put my hands in my my face in my hands rather started crying just about how the Bible says we will be judged by what we knew in church the reason I'm starting crying because we know so much we have to make sure we're faithful with what God has made known to us praise God we will be judged by what we know and what we did with what we know and here's the scripture that was kind of tugging on my heart this morning and that servant which knew his Lord's will now we know all about the rapture and the Bible said she hath made herself ready praise God but see the though that those that knew his will and didn't prepare themselves for the rapture neither did according to his Will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for whom sever much is given of him shall be the much required to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more what uh what a striking thought and this thought kind of came to me how notice there's some that know God's will and their son that don't know God's will now don't don't let that stumble you because the reason they knew God's will was because of God's desire and I believe this the reason they knew God's will or didn't know God's will because because of their desire because Jesus said you have not because you ask not amen praise God see you and I will have no excuses because Paul said he's made known unto us the mystery of his will God's will for our lives is no mystery the mystery has been revealed amen his will is his word from him tells us amen so all these doctrines all these prophecies all these teachings that God has made known to us it's the will of God amen they known to us we know his will we won't be able to stand there and say we didn't know the will of God we know the will of God now your individual walk with God is determined by how meet you can be did you hear me your individual will God's individual will for your life is determined with how much you can humble yourself go to Psalm 25 I'll prove that by the word this was a fresh thought I was reading a book by a Charles Swindell this week I've been it's kind of different I've just been led to start at the back and work my way forward because I wanted it's called the mystery of God's will and I just found some good scriptures in there so Psalms 25 and I found a good scripture about doing God's will and it's only to be done by humbling ourselves Oh glory now I'm gonna skip around here so bear with me if you would go to oma there's just so many good ok let's go to verse 5 so I'm twenty five five well let's go to verse four I didn't wasn't planning on preaching this it show me thy ways o Lord teach me thy past so see God wants you to ask to know his will show it to me Lord we got to come to church show me your will and I'll do it verse five lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on the dua way of the day so see David saying I'm waiting for you to fulfill your word I wait for you to reveal your will for my life now he says remember O Lord my tender mercies than thy loving-kindness for they have been been ever of old I'm gonna skip down to nine now here's where I was saying if you really want to know you're in God's perfect will for your life you we have to humble ourselves because look at verse nine the meek will he guide in judgment not the proud because the proud will won't wait on God long enough they'll try to jump through their own conclusions and run up to riches or or sensuality or cares of the world or they'll shrink away and in fear and doubt and unbelief but he said the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way and head glory amen all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth under such as keep his covenant and his testimonies look good let's go to verse 12 what man is he that feareth the Lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose seize the man who fears God he's taught God's Way now go down uh verse 13 his sole sword well at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him amen look up here church the mystery of his will you want to know the mystery of God's will the Bible said the secret Lord is with them that fear God and He will show them his covenant praise God now if you just remember I'm gonna turn to Matthew 11 the Bible says he shows it to the meek and look at Matthew 11 come unto you me verse 28 all either labor and heavy laden I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart a man if you want to know God's will if you want to know what you're supposed to do for God you must become meek because the one who's going to teach you is meek doesn't brother man say that's why we love God so much because he's so great he humbled himself praise God if we want to know that we're doing God's will we would know the mystery of God's will the full Ministry of God's will for our life we must humble ourselves and fear God humble ourselves and come before the meek one and then he said then you'll find rest for your souls there's that peace David was talking about for a soul for my yoke is easy and my burden is light are you thankful for a light burden on this earth there's a whole lot other burdens you could bear that would be a lot heavier praise God but he give us a light burden amen thank God now notice revelation 20 says the dead were judged out of those things that were written the books according to their works and then he says it again in verse 13 they were judged every man according to their works so God is watching the works that we do once once God gives someone information or it's a revelation in this case then he watching what you do with the revelation because you can have all the mysteries and not yet have charity and they profit you nothing unless you have charity praise God because Peter said this he opened his mouth in Cornelius house and I said God is no respecter of persons God doesn't love Americans more than he loves Asians God doesn't love Americans more than he loves Africans Amen right or Europeans or whenever God is not a respecter of persons amen but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him amen not just some nations but every nation praise God and look what gee member Jesus in our memory verse he said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they might be filled no they shall be filled so Jesus promises in any nation if anyone hungers and thirsts after the true God they shall be filled amen so see were judged by what we know and then God promises now look at this this is in the days of King ASA but ASA trusted in God or man one time and though he got he didn't rely upon the Lord so he got chasing because God said remember when you did rely upon the Lord and he delivered them the the Ethiopians in your hands look what he says for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him Amen God is searching all the earth saying is there anybody that wants to know me is there anybody that wants to do righteousness God that I am searching the earth for anyone to be a witness anyone who's hungry and thirsty I'll lead them out guide them if they can just humble themselves that the Bible says he searches the whole earth Peter said every nation anyone who fears God will be accepted of him so see let's go back to that parable Luke 12 there's some servants that knew God's will because they wanted to know it and some of them were born into it like if you're born the message you just had you're born into it but we were I wasn't born in it but God knew I would want it praise God so he made away he knew I would hunger and thirst for righteousness so he made a way that I could be philony how did he Leah because he his eyes were going around the whole live is there anyone that fears me is anyone that loves me is there anyone and of course he knew who was he was searching about and he predestinated that they would receive his word Lucas Psalms 96 13 says the same thing before the Lord for he cometh for that he come to judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth every nation knows truth because he appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained who is that man Paul tells us that man he said God so judge the secrets of men by the man Jesus Christ according to my gospel praise God amen every nation is going to be judged by Jesus Christ because he is the truth amen and God was searching God will be able to say I searched though every nation I searched Australia the Aborigines I searched the deep jungles of Africa I saw the jungles of South America I searched all those tribes looking for someone who was hungry for righteousness amen that's what the Word of God says and they're judged by what they knew now remember the Bible says I'm going to skip down to verse yeah there's no respect to persons all have sinned verse 14 for when the Gentiles which had not the law see so ever talk about these Aborigines or people that never heard of God when they do by nature that things contain the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the all written in their hearts amen hallelujah Church that means the ten commandments are written in every human's heart amen it says right there they don't have a law but there are lots of themselves because the law is written in their hearts amen hallelujah show me any civilization where murder and rape is okay it's not you know it's not and see God wrote in their hearts and their conscience also bears witness with it and that's and that's where Paul gets to this scripture he's gonna judge everybody by Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the truth and the truth is the law and that law was written in their hearts amen was it the Mayans that did all those human sacrifices I believe in South America was that the Mayans I believe it was doing there's another one too what was it Aztecs so they had he had human sacrifices and they had him often and the leaders could just sacrifice anybody they want but the Bible says here that that wasn't always the case there was at some point in that Aztec civilization they knew it was wrong but if they keep running and keep going past it and don't want to believe the truth then the Bible said God will give them over to a lie but the law of God was written in their hearts and not to answer on the day of judgment because God put a conscience in every man he's a minor God he minor creator he's a minor influencer amen and we either use that influence influence for God's glory or for human selfishness or gain because remember the Bible said the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifest in them God has two witnesses against all man if they won't serve Him the first one is in him for God has showed it unto them so a human looks at themselves and were judged by what we know but everybody knows there has God because every person can see the creative powers of God working in their body when was the last time you told your heart make sure you pump today don't forget it I need that oxygen oxygenated blood when was last time you told your heart to do that you didn't it just does it well his last time you told your eyes and all the muscles in there to catch the light and make sure they could arrange it and understand the right way you did it it was all autonomous right it was already built in and so see God has built-in to everybody a manifestation of his glory and a manifestation of his presence and there's no man who's without excuse praise God because the Bible says they are without excuse the second one so God first he puts himself in every puts a creative power in every human and then second he is seen by what is clearly seen in the creation so a man can't look at the Setting Sun a man can't look at a waterfall a man can't look at the Stars and the planets and the rotation and eclipses man cannot look at that and not confess there's a God they may limit lie about it later on down the road but at some point when they look up and they see the Sun and they can't look anymore they know it's God's creation I'm not being judged by what they know at church so Louise we got to be careful that's God to help us to live what we know so I want to just lay that foundation that was a fresh thought to me because some of them don't know the commands of God and it's because they don't ask for it because the Bible said ask and you shall receive and God puts that hunger program called the holy thirst God puts that holy thirst in every soul to win a thirst and know God and know the truth and no righteousness does this help pray this is help church every soul thirst to know righteous what is true what is righteous they know there are some God out there and they either stay either hush that holy thirst or they they they keep crying out and they try to bring satisfaction to that holy thirst and if they they'll find Jesus Christ aren't you glad you found him amen yeah so good I found him and he found me praise the Lord now I want to continue on this I just thought I would lay that groundwork there because it was important to me to say some of those things so we we started that on Wednesday there's I have at least seven I could probably do a lot more I just didn't write them all down there's at least seven wrong things that the Jeffersonville movement is saying the first one I think is the most evil is not every word brother Adam said is thus saith the Lord here's the exact quote the the leader says Amen I believe everything but Aram says is thus saith the Lord I believe everything the Prophet says that is the truth of God to mean you whether we want to accept it or not look at the pressure that puts on people well you better accept it or not or you're going to be lost if you don't make every word they'll say the Lord then you're not you're not even saved look at the pressure behind that that's not right okay I'm gonna skip I did have the recording there but yeah for some reason I don't have I don't have a good understanding of how to do the audio now let me just review these real quick there's a give at least 18 statements that prove he's fallible he's a man I want to go over them quickly because you'll run across them you've probably run across them as you listen to the tapes so these two cannot be thus saith the Lord because God does not lie so here's what I was mentioning but Memphis that I make thousands of mistakes in each month in each year surely I do but when I see I'm wrong I say God I didn't mean to do it you know my heart I didn't mean to do that I was trapped for that I didn't mean to do it you forgive me Lord now let's say thousands let's just say as he says thousands rights that's more than 1,000 let's just say 2,000 you used to send 2,000 times in one year how many times is that well 2,000 one year divided by each day is about five six sins a year or six ends a day now how many evil thoughts do you have per day now how about the does literally like birds flying over and you shoo them away I'm know about the ones you actually entertain so see this is why I can look at brotherman and I can respect him because he was honest he might have forgot a lot of things he might exaggerate it but I can respect him because that's the reality some days I probably more evil thoughts than that right I thought thousands I said on Wednesday I think occasion Lydia when tried to figure out that number how many were sins would that be in a day five evil thoughts that you entertain Oh me back it you know yeah then you gotta cast it out Oh forgive me Lord I didn't mean to think that oh this person so evil I'll just get back at them Oh God forgive me I didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to think that help me Lord Jesus but see in each mistake in each word that he would say maybe that would be wrong and what that wasn't thus saith the Lord because the Lord does not lie now I've read the a few of these quickly on Wednesday as I close but I want to show you the whole quotes is that okay I want to show you the whole quotes I think it'll help you to understand this so there's four predictions that cannot be thus say at the Lord and here they are 1977 death by gunshot Martin Luther King jr. Movement and Billy Paul was the promise Joseph so let's go through the quotes you can see it now Bertram says two things left are those seven great prophecies that is for cars to be on the road with remote control looking like a egg only you won't drive it it controls itself and then there will be a great woman rise up because America is a woman's nation it'll be great women rise up be President or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total annihilation that entire nation will be wiped out and I predict now this is not the Lord saying this now I don't know how that the family members of our own can say everywhere does thus saith the Lord when he says this is not the Lord I believe everywhere does us a look well then what you don't believe him he's saying it's not the Lord that shows us a spirit it's an evil spirit because if the man is humble if brother has humble enough to say this is not the Lord this is me if he's humble enough to say that and you won't admit it something's wrong with your mother you've got an evil spirit on you he's remember an evil spirit well not you trying to reason with it you try to show it truth it will not accept it because it's hanging on to something else and I think it's the love of money because it's either women love of money or popularity what could be popularity too but I think behind all that is either popularity or money because the love of money is the root of all evil why would this family why would the family members say every word is done because it puts a binding on them they've got to stay with the tapes and they got they gotta stay with the family members it binds them doesn't it he says this is not the Lord but I predicted in 19:33 that the world would meet total annihilation before sister Karen lived through this she sister Karen saw people that knew this quote and they run up their credit card bills oh I would have to pay it because it's gonna happen before 77 I remember you and Loras told me that see now that was evil then they do that because the real Christian doesn't want to steal money a real Christian wants to pay their dues off or their debts off that shows it was the wrong spirit to start with selfishness so I didn't know then that that they had something that could annihilate it like they got now but I seen that nation total annihilation just stumps of trees and things like that left so Graham is saying I only saw tree stumps left before 1977 and as I said on Wednesday night although the jeffersonville people have to do is go outside and if they find one tree that's not a stone and it's a full grown then they have to recognize that what's in the state the Lord so look the trees are witnessing against them amen ah see God God's Word will stand true when God speaks something it's going to happen you can rest your soul on it praise God but as humans we can make our own ideas and our predictions and that's okay but let's not hang on then let's hang on thus saith the Lord because he says this is not of the Lord he says it again in another way in the church age book and here's what stumbles to believe the sign people my butt wraps I sincerely believe maintain as a privacy of the word along with divine inspiration see the guy he says it in there 1979 - still didn't say they'll say the Lord cookie says I predict I do not prophesy that they'll all come to pass by night by 1977 and so he slides this divine inspiration because Marvin was inspired he was inspired when he saw the visions and he had made he made two calculations I'm gonna show you in just a moment he made two calculations that he thought lined up perfectly with 1977 now did he have divine inspiration on some of these things yes on some of them but not all of them but he didn't save us saith the Lord he just said I feel I'm inspired at church how many times have you and I said God's leading us to do something and that maybe wasn't God how many times have we had dreams and the Lord showed me this the Lord showed me that and it turned out not to be the Lord see any honest person could admit we do the same thing because we're just trying to be spiritual church we're just trying to figure out God's will we got to sweat it out and what am I supposed to do Lord and and so and what is it it's all testing us God's putting us through the fire to test us to make our faith more sure because when all these 1977 people fell away what it thin down the crowd it kept the pyramid going more narrow and more narrow thinning it out thinning it out thinning it out until whoever's left is gonna be the real bride of Jesus Christ because Christ is gonna sit himself right on top of that church amen I think that's gonna be a very small group and their ministry is going to match the Ministry of Christ the word perfectly because their hearts are going to be turned back to the Apostolic fathers the Word of God hey man see they love money they love vacations they loved all that mourn they loved Christ to begin with looking for an easy way out sorry God brings all his saints along the same way praise God the hardship of fires fiery tests and trials of our faith amen more precious than gold well that burns them up that believe the signs of divine inspiration it ought to terminate now we still have the world systems right I still got to go get my Social Security card for the babies yeah I still gotta get I still gotta pay taxes yeah they're they're still here so how is this thus saith the LORD it's not but you know better because you don't worship brother Brandon nor even either do I amen now what's the cause of this 1977 air it's his personal opinion and yet this does not disqualify him from being a prophet because this prediction was not spoken in the name of the Lord now look as a student of the word brother Ram was looking at dates and numbers when he made the 1977 predict miscalculated these and he tells you this he tells you this in Daniel 70 weeks 1961 here's his to miscalculations he thought the Gentiles would only get 1954 years to hear the gospel because that's how long Moses got before Christ King so Moses gave the law about 1954 years before Christ so Graham saw that in the in the the the genealogy the lineage and Oh if the Jews got 1954 years then that's what the Gentiles will get so see he was just trying to be spiritual just like you tried to figure out when the rapture is just like me trying to figure out when will the church's unite with the president when will they all try to figure it out mercy 2nd 1977 was actually the 70th jubilee 70 times 70 so he found that in the genie out at the numbers so he saw these two witnesses he's the one divinely inspired I'm not gonna prophesy see the Holy Spirit kept him from doing that David raised God because he had two witnesses he thought oh this will like this would be perfect and you should hear him if you haven't listened to that Daniel seven weeks ago listen to that writer and he ends the sermon in the last hour talking about 1977 go listen that he's so convinced because he saw these two numbers line up he thought oh it's got to happen before 77 you say where's that in the Bible well yeah that's definitely the Bible John 21 the Bible said a saying or prediction went out that John would not die because he'd see the Lord's second coming John died and Jesus had still not returned see they had a prediction and it was time-stamped to the end of John's life just like the 1977 prediction was time-stamped see but Jose Christians are always trying to get a little insight on when is the rapture going to take place oh it's been going all the time amen if you and I would have been live at that time for the Amen we would have camped right around John's Church because oh I heard him say Jesus said you know I'm not tested taste death till he sees me coming in his kingdom oh you know it church you would have done the same thing because what we don't want to miss it we want to be ready we're sincere so we would have moved from church well we would have followed John if he would have went to Ephesus or Patmos hurry we would have found him around the whole time because we thought we heard we thought we knew that John was going to see the Lord's coming so I want to be where John is so the same thing repeats in our day where BAM thinks he sees it he gives out a date and so everybody just wants to maybe say hey I want to be ready for that day I'll do everything I can to be ready for that day but then the prediction comes and goes and God's people are left wondering scratching their heads the whole time as gods like you should have just stayed with us say at the Lord it's a good test for you you're learning to trust me don't trust in men don't make your own ideas it's okay to try to to try to predict and things like that but you only hang yourself on thus sayeth the Lord amen Andy how many times you better have to have to say how many times the brother I have to say that it's not me it's not I'm sorry's not gonna say the Lord it's just me it's not it's not the Lord I'm just predicting how many times has he got to say that to people catch it but would it be hard absolutely absolutely here's this here's the second one this is insulted our person now which is a very challenging sermon can I just say like that because at the end sister Karen this is the Brendan knows at the end brother branham still thinks time might be over for people to be saved if you listen to the breech brother that makes it sound like this is a March of 63 right before the seals he makes it sound like when Jesus looses the seals there's no more redemption because he's taking the book everyone's still not sure mercy goodness eight months later but I'm still not sure he said mercy might be over and you can hear him cry out he cries out for the salvation of Joseph and Sarah and Rebecca and he's like crying and you can hear the people the barren tabernacle crying oh God mercy but then thinks time still but then thinks time might be over and we might be in the third pole which is preaching to the eternal lost this into a church if you haven't done that so he tells this dream this is challenging sermon because brother Brad was growing and understanding now does he fix it he fixes it in the next year in August of 64 nasan brother Graham is time and over and he said no he said he said it could have been my fault he said no he said don't never think that don't you ever get that in your mind was just a year ago you told us it might be over are you a checked a year ago forever you're making a sound like because he was just look he was open for more revelation so he says some sister he said look he's saying all keeps dripping with blood he's singing that song it's dripping with blood it's this Holy Ghost gospel it's dripping with blood time all the martyrs he said yes they keep dripping with blood yes sir it'll do it someday but I'm late I'm waiting that hour when it's finished some sister had a dream she said to me and said I seen them that church fixed away is going to kill me secretly sometime when I'm getting out of my car going in be fired on but said then the spirit said not at this time but it will come later look brother I'm never disagreed with this he said uh-huh listen to it he agrees with the dream it says Oh huh the boat rammed I have a gun shot secretly no he died of a car accident but I thought the spirit said it wasn't the Holy Spirit it was a dream where the sister thought it was the Holy Spirit but it wasn't the Holy Spirit but brother I'm never cruxit on the tape and on the tape it makes it sound like uh-huh uh-huh the spirit said later uh-huh is that the state the Lord no no it's just like oh I felt letting the Holy Spirit to do this and you find out you weren't letting the Holy Spirit to do that it wasn't the Spirit of God leading you not all dreams are from God dreams are like the male some of you get good mail somebody get junk mail somebody get some junky dreams I get him to I don't like him but see this dream was not thus saith the Lord but if you say about everywhere program says thus saith Lord well then he must have died from a gunshot wound and not a car accident there's some conspiracy spirit theory here we better go back to a Texas and figure out what happened there it's time to open that investigation back up right because everything every words that saith the Lord it's gonna come later uh-huh god forbid I compromise on anything I know nothing but Jesus Christ him crucified we're living a horrible day sinners has did this yep there they stone Stephen they cut they had John's head cut off she did I don't know what we'll give ours but it'll be something look he says I don't know he just says the spirit and he says huh huh but he says I don't know but it'll be some day no it'll be all right notice now Church the same thing I don't have the quotes today but I'll show you this those are the same words he said maybe where'd he say yeah I don't know those are the same words he says when he said the Holy Spirit told him Joseph was a prophet he said he said it's my prayer at least or he said I hope he's a prophet brother Graham says the Holy Spirit struck him when he was dedicating to son Joseph and said Joseph my son you're a prophet I wrote a says I hope so at least that's my prayer I hope the same thing see we attribute things to the Holy Spirit which arch how do you know by their fruits you shall know it it will come to pass if it's thus saith the Lord it'll come to pass and that's why those return ministry people are still hanging on for buh-bam to rise from the dead because they know some of these things haven't come to pass but they believe they are listen Church the thus saith the Lord are going to come to pass but there's going to be no return ministry above the rim the ministry is in the bride the Living bride whose only ass right now praise God that's the only living ministry is the bride of Jesus Christ because the spirit and the bride say come amen that's how it is I don't know how we'll give ours well you just got a dream where the spirit said you to go die by gunshot he says I don't know but it sounds like uh-huh sounds like uh huh see so not every word is thus saith the Lord so the cause of this air well it's perhaps of both a personal opinion and honest mistake every man and woman probably holds dreams or ideas about the future they think it are from the Lord's Holy Spirit when in reality they're not it could have been an honest mistake in which program did not pray enough about the sisters dream before publicly repeating it and we've all done that yet this is not disqualified from being a prophet because it was not shared with us saith the Lord so perhaps also now here's a Bible example David was convinced Saul was gonna kill him someday so he left Israel and escaped to the Philistine land did you know he said that the Bible records that saw never saw David's life after he saw how David had mercy on him and could have killed him and just cut off the little clothes from his skirt they called it a skirt into long robes the Bible said Saul said oh you valued my life my soul has been precious he said I'll net all no longer go after David but Dave was convinced he's going to kill me he's going to kill me he's gonna kill me same thing here but Rama thought I might die by gunshot might die by gunshot what was in the case praise God David was convinced he was so convinced whether Amen he left the country now that's convinced that's convinced and concerned sister Wendy you're so convinced you lead the nation and you go to your sworn enemy because you're so scared you're gonna die this way but yet church you had nothing to worry about the whole time but he was so worried I'm gonna die I was gonna kill me and he had even King yet he forgot about the prophecy of the Prophet uh help us not to forget about the prophecies for Christ's bride in the rapture amen let's not forget that and get to scourge amen let's be encouraged by the grace of God like I had a dream one time where I found my dad dead in a rocking chair I woke up from that dream and I cursed that dream in the name of Jesus so I'm not gonna find my dad dead in the rocking chair and somebody had a dream they called me a few weeks ago said brother Jesse I hate to tell you this he said I had a dream of you you died in a very I'm not gonna give the details because my tuner listened but they died in this dishonourable way and everything like that I said brother I'm gonna curse that dream in the name of Jesus Christ I'm not gonna be like David and you know he's the wave godly man and I was you know better but I'm just saying I want to learn from that example I'm not gonna run and I'm not gonna live in fear I'm a living faith amen but if felt what's it take me whatever way you want to take me so--but I'll trust in God because he's kept me this far and he won't let me go and toast my time to go praise God I curse that because I don't believe that he shook me up a little bit was last time somebody called you and said I had a dream about you dying I sure didn't I sure didn't like that but I sure got that I sure got the understanding I got the assurance that I all things will work together for my good to them to love the Lord and I appreciate something that I honestly do I appreciate the person for calling me up because they were honest like if I had a dream about somebody I wouldn't go tell them the dream because it might be from God it might be here's the next one Martin Luther King jr. this was this was a pretty harsh prophecy I'm sorry this is a pretty harsh prediction I'm sorry friction but that's all about Martin Luther King jr. this is in July 63 but this man if I can only speak to him leading those precious people under the name of religion into a death trap where he's gonna kill thousands times down of them program makes it sound like Martin Luther King jr. which we're gonna have a holiday for him pretty soon who's gonna kill thousands of them by leading them into a death trap now look what he says next Church I'll tell you this is you really need we really need God's grace here brace yourself for this quote here there the next one one thing I pray brother Martin Luther King will certainly wake up what good would it be if you went to a school a million of you laying yonder dead what good just to go to school just the same I'm gonna skip down just like Hitler did over in Germany led them right into a death trap so brother Branham is comparing Martin Luther King jr. to Hitler they he thinks they're both gonna lead people into a death trap let them write them precious Germans and they laid by the means or bins piled up on top of one another look.we says this is what I was saying this is the tough one and that's exactly the same thing but BAM says as Hitler had millions of Germans killed Martin Luther gene Judith ur King jr. was gonna lead millions of african-americans to death and he says remember I'm on tape after maybe after I'm gone that's exactly what's going to happen then precious people will die down there like fly start a revolutionary both white and color will fight again so Batman was saying a civil war is gonna break out white against black in southern America and he says listen I'm on tape talk about boldness but here's what I'm gonna say it now just so you got it he lived through two world wars Church brother murder bro brother man wasn't you know unaware of death he saw it in the papers every day can you imagine World War one of course he's a little boy World War two he saw the the millions died he's he's surrounded by death surrounded by wars so wouldn't be maybe a surprising thing for him to say something like this because he was surrounded by wars his whole life heroes killed on this or do you just announce that there would be this happening now I see I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to see there's so much of it that's just the human side but always if there's something that goes forth it will speak it how much always its thus saith the Lord even divisions or anything the visions on the platform is so you're doing that yourself it isn't God it's you God doesn't produce that vision you do it yourself by your faith and divine gift here's what I said on Wednesday I about fell over when I listen to this quote I was driving some glad I didn't fall over said I'm in a very bad situation like the woman that touched Jesus's garment he didn't know who she was or what was wrong with her but she did that herself now see that wasn't thus sayeth the Lord when Jesus said who touched me it was thus saith the Lord when Jesus spoke back and told her that her faith had saved her but see you have to watch so I made this statement a few weeks ago we all amend it I remember I said every word jesus said was thus saith the Lord and we all amend it I amended numerous times in the sermon but here program says when Jesus said who touched me that wasn't the Lord because think about it the Lord knew know who touched him the Lord knew the Holy Spirit knew so this is teaching me even quite a bit here I'm not sure what to say I said on Wednesday was every word though jesus said pleasing to God yes because he said I always do that which pleases the father but not every word jesus said was a prophecy because remember Jesus flesh did not know all things he didn't know the day or the hour not even the Angels know the day or the hour I mean brother Jose let me throw a new one at you yet but on your shock vest here but Ranson when you get your theophanies it's a word body and you know all things well is that exactly right do you know the day in the hour of the rapture once you die I don't know but I know this the angels don't know and they got the Alpha knees and the church said so I don't know I don't think of the AH phanie then would know everything because then if we know everything what do we need Jesus for but man says the hidden manna is Jesus answering all of our questions throughout all eternity so see we got to take every quote back to the word praise the Lord hoo-boy quite a message this morning that yeah the more I listen to this the more Wow God is he what is he doing he's refining her faith and I'll say like this he's teaching us to rely upon the Holy Spirit yes we thank God for the tapes we listen to the tapes yes we thank God for the Papo ministry but listen Church you're not gonna get there because of me you and I are not gonna get to the rapture because of my gift for anything I got you're gonna get there because you love the Holy Spirit and you want the truth from the Holy Spirit amen because another man's revelation cannot get you there you must have the revelation and the greatest revelation you can have is that you're bored again amen hallelujah that you have the love of God sorry in your heart and there's air in your heart you can be patient waiting on these the state the Lord's and all these predictions whether these going to come to pass I can be patient because charity has long-suffering I'm not giving up if if Trump doesn't get reelected I'm not giving up him if something happens to Israel I'm not giving up why cuz I've got charity and charity suffereth long even though I don't understand every word sister Karen even though I don't understand every prophecy of prediction I can wait upon the Lord because I've got charity my soul and the love of God in my soul can wait upon the Lord until he fulfills his word I'd say that threw me for a loop that wasn't thus saith the Lord who touched me that wasn't thus saith the Lord I know so they asked him did you prophesy no I was just talking about Martin Luther King on this great disaster they're having down the South now see Church we weren't living in those days but there was a lot of riots there was people killed did you know they shot bullets through Martin Luther King Jr's house they threw the gasoline pop bottle bombs and exploded him right outside of his house there's all kinds of violence against Blacks so programs read this in the newspaper he saw all the world war and he seen the vision of America destroyed he said I'm on tape just listen it's gonna happen he thought he saw the same signs down south the racial evils he saw the same thing as it was in Germany the racial evils and he thought oh it's just like that it's gonna be a repeat he said listen I'm on tape but they asked him a month later he said no that wasn't us saith the Lord he said we're all one blood see we're all creatures of the almighty you see there shouldn't be any differences in us it's inspired the wrong thing the civil rights movement see see them people and that's the reason I say that not that there's any prophecy concerning it but yet he said I'm on tape he said and you'll know afterwards he said that I just read you that see we got to let him be a man he thinks he's guessing he thinks it's gonna be that's what's gonna happen I have nothing on it from the Lord and you be sure now if I anything from the Lord like that to tell you I'm speaking now but when he speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith the Lord and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong and I thought about Martin Luther King jr. I don't know I can't say that's just my opinion well what does Jefferson bill gonna do with that quote back here he said that's exactly the jefferson bill every word is das saith the lord so that's exactly going to happen and it hasn't happened were they gonna do with that well they'll say all you know God will help us to understand it we believe it anyway really okay believe whatever you want you can you can believe that if you want but I'm not gonna believe that so what's the cause of this air as a personal opinion but that doesn't disqualify him from being a prophet because it wasn't spoken with us say at the Lord we're called brother Branham was well acquainted with wars and uprising he lived during the first two world wars born in 1909 it seems his observations from his travels in the South States made him think of civil war was a possibility all humans including prophets are open their own opinions this opinion was not a prophecy is more like a warning against the uprising that would lead to a violent revolution Colossians 1:28 says Christians must offer warnings to all men when needed does that help by God's grace I was trying to show you just you know I was shocked when he said listen I'm this is on tape see we gotta be we just gotta be real sharp praise God we've got to be real straight with the Word of God we've got to know exactly what the word says so this is the one I'm you know I started writing the script I'm gonna make a video and share it with just Joseph and Billy Paul if they'll watch it I'm gonna email it the voice of God because they won't talk to me about it anymore they won't email me about it anymore they said we don't want to argue I said I'm not arguing I just want to talk about it they won't return my emails anymore so what can I do so but if every word is thus saith the Lord then Billy Paul is the real Joseph well then who is Joseph I don't know there to Josephson the old doesn't there's only one so who is he I don't know he said my little boy this is a 1951 I forgot the 9 there sorry it's not 151 it's 1951 little boy that's now he's soon to be 16 that's Billy Paul Billy Paul's 15 he said about a week after that I said daddy I want to be a Christian I want to serve Him my Joseph was right with me and I didn't even know it in 1946 Melbourne was praying in Minnesota in a hotel room and the Holy Spirit said you're gonna have a son named him Joseph so here we are five years later five years later he just had Sarah born Sarah wasn't a boy Sarah was a girl so boban thinks well okay well if this is a girl then I've already got my Joseph with me already I didn't even know it but yet four years after this he had a Joseph now if you listened what sermon is at 1965 brother Brennan tells his story about Joseph and brother Graham makes it sound like he never wavered on it Levin tells his story and the preacher a preacher made fun of him and said oh it's Sarah Oh Sarah was born not Joseph oh you met and Josephine but Ram said that man died because he mocked for the branham's prophecy but if brother when brother and tells the story he never says anything about how he doubted this who this was gonna be why because he was a man he wasn't perfect he fell short of the glory of God sometimes row bran would reveal his mistakes other times he just didn't think in minute which was okay when it was last time you told all your mistakes everybody publicly remember I said that a few weeks ago I would like to come up here and just admit all your mistakes this past week we didn't like to do that I don't think I get any takers on that see the little baby I thought would be Joseph is a little girl and I called her Sarah I'm thankful for her I love her with all my heart so this is the first one I'm going to bring to the on the video I've already written it out I'm about halfway done with the script I hope to record I want to record yesterday I just have time so I want to record it maybe next Saturday how in the world can you say this is thus saith the Lord because that means Billy Paul is the real Joseph well who's Joseph is that he's an imposter right if it's I say the Lord this is the save Lord then he's somebody else I don't know and that means really pause I'm a prophet but then Browne also said the Billy Paul's not called to preach anymore it's not gonna be a prophet if he's not a caught if she's not allowed to preach what have you made this now what have they made this if everywhere does that say the Lord and you know there's quotes but Ram said he prayed that Billy Paul would be a preacher in a prophet he said lord I believe you're gonna make Billy Paul prophet and a preacher someday you know program said Rebecca would take his place did you know program said Sarah would take his place one day seeing the visions and praying for the sick did never do that not that I've seen I've got a quote program said may double may God double x double every gift I have and give it to Joseph is that the said the Lord I email guy on YouTube one of the guys from Jeffersonville I said if this is the say the Lord then come tell me when Joseph Branham is discerning people because I want to get in the prayer line because we're gonna have double x double all the answers to prayer and he said oh you're a man of misunderstanding I said no I'm just saying what the tape say right double x double okay well if a couple of people raised from the dead then I should see double with Joseph raising from the dead I asked two of Joseph Brennan's closest childhood friends I said can you prove me any proof as the Prophet has he ever said they'll say Lord they both said no they said the only thing they had was that one employee a voice of God got up from a morning and opened his email and I guess he was looking at something evil on the internet the night before and he got an email from Joseph Branham and this is when all around voice of God and he said what were you doing last night on the internet so that could be it could be a gift to discernment or if he was on the voice of God's internet server he can check what websites they go to and then it wouldn't be a gift of discernment right Church I don't know but Brennan said double times double so see his human desires and prayers weren't let's say at the Lord it was thus at the Lord when he said thus saith of the Lord Amen man I hope it's helping you Church I hope it's helping you but Ranas misinterpretation ability Paul as his promise Joseph was both the honest mistake and his personal opinion he never said Billy Paul's my Joseph thus saith Lord he never said that brother rogram was simply trying to understand the meaning of the Lord's promised him about a son named Joseph while waiting for the promise to come to pass let's give you a bible example oh that's easy genesis 16 abraham's and sarah tried to figure out god's promise for abram to have seen come from his own bowels how is this promise gonna come about oh listen to abraham you take hagar then you'll have seed from your body yes we figured out we did it we figured out god's word God don't do it would like that God doesn't ask you to figure it out God doesn't ask me to figure it out God figures it out God brings it the pass and what it produced a wild man Ishmael see we can't let our personal opinions try to bring the promise of God to pass no let me go just five more minutes oh I'm so timer here I know you I've been about hour and a half give me about five more minutes more willing on Wednesday we'll look at a few more of these now these are all doctrinal statements because what I mean by dr. blood Ram will say something and then he'll quote a scripture and he'll try to teach something but then they're actually he changes it later or he admits he's later wrong so how many know that Bob Arum said Jesus is not on the throne in heaven right now I mean no he said that I've heard preachers preach that it was a couple of years ago at a convention and Wendy went to I listened to it and the brother he's a real famous preacher I love him I'm his friend on Facebook he's a wonderful brother but he said he said Saints he said Jesus ain't in heaven right now Jesus is on earth and the place erupted I'm thinking man are you serious brother that's okay I make mistakes too but he's quoting this we're brother Ram said Jesus is not in heaven anymore he's on the throne of your heart which it's true he's on the throne of your heart as the seal of the Holy Ghost but he's still in heaven Amen praise God he then his corporal body is still in heaven hallelujah his corporal body still in heaven but yet his spirit can be in each and every one of our souls at the same time as a throne of God but seabird ran thought it's kind of kind of me too when I study sometimes I think I'll get oh that's a good thought oh yeah yeah I see that but I didn't set it out all the way I gotta come by and fix it later let's see the quote well dad said where's his throne today now this is right after the church ages this is a couple of days before that the Holy Ghost came down and did the seven the seven shadows for the seven Church ages on the back wall of the brand tabernacle remember brother never was there he's seen it brother never was there he said well where's the throne today now brother Neville if I passed over who asked me Wow where's his throne today I think I'll get to it now where's his throne at now if he's not on his throne now he isn't on his throne now no sir where's his throne at now in the heart so this is where the brother got it from which he's studying the message you know I found it while I was studying the message and when I preached that revelation series the remm said he's not on his throne now he's in the heart oh my two years later he said he sits on the throne of God tonight and it must remain there for by his stripes he's the sacrifice the sacrifice is on the altar see he fixes it if not then if everyone I'll say the Lord well no he's not on the throne wait wait yeah he is no he's not yeah is see how you have quotes fighting against each other God is not the author of confusion so how do you know it'll just we've got the word to know praise God we prove all things by the word of God hallelujah that's why God gave you the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost would discern the truth because he is the Spirit of Truth that's how you know that's what the brothers told us that voice and God member Jose they told us well if we got to make every word us say the Lord because we're not sure which ones or not and I said that I said well that's why God gave us all he goes to rightly divide the word of truth and they just said okay went on to something else see that they don't want to hear it they want to believe because they're their money's invested into it their 401ks their income everything since they got to keep the money coming might be all about money are they sincere absolutely are they nice hardly we could be hard to be treated any nicer hospitality now that did they give us the I think they offered us water to I mean never gave us a water and they were Lord you know there's a reward for that well see you can't make every word that I say floor because they contradict each other he's on his throne by the Amen no he's not he's not on his throne he's not on strong weight yeah yeah yes no he's not yeah yes no he's not and now who you gonna believe I'm gonna believe the word praise God I believe the Lord see and then he says later he says the Bible said he's a high priest right now a high priest sitting at the right hand the majesty of God to make intercessions upon our confession right now now here's was that here's was his doctrine he said the first throne was in heaven which this sounds pretty good first orders in heaven judgment-seat second throne was in Christ third as in man because no ground liked numerology right he liked biblical numerology so do i but this was his teaching it was that he's gonna make this doctrine see it was in heaven than it was in Christ and now it's in the heart of man now that's true but it doesn't mean heavens empty heaven still has the corporal body of Jesus Christ amen all right so see you just honest mistake in church I never found brother I'm repeating that doctrine after that every time afterwards every time I type in throne and the body of Christ he's always in heaven still he's always in heaven still just a one-time thing see he thought there was a three-step progression changing from the throne in heaven to the throne Jesus body found a throne the believers heart leavers can see the progression of God dwelling among them today when he draws within men but that doesn't mean Jesus bodies not on the heavenly throne this is a wonderful example of God correcting his prophet on doctrine and this shows how brother Branham can grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord what a perfect example he thought oh he's not on it anymore but then God straightens him out later and says no he is seated on the throne right now preachers must grow an understanding just like every other believer believer brother Branham was constantly growing in wisdom and understanding Apollo screw in revelation after meeting with Aquila and Priscilla in acts 18 26 Peter was corrected about his by pause dr. enough separating from the eating with Gentiles and Galatians 2 this was the spirit of discrimination the spirit of pride may be spirit division something related Peter urges all of us to grow in our knowledge of the Lord do you want to be stagnant in your understanding or do you want to grow in your understanding of Christ I want to grow I'm gonna go good brother branham grow yeah can you grow absolutely I can grow let's stand to our feet we'll stop right there I actually that was my last kind of ran out of time for the quotes because you know church I want to take a little bit time and I want you to see the quotes I want you to see them so that you understand so understand like this we accept God's prophet but we've got to remember brother Branham is not aren't really the interpreter right the Holy Spirit is the interpreter does a profit reveal yes but not every word brother branham said interprets the Bible the Holy Spirit is the interpreter the Holy Spirit directs us back to the word by God's grace I wanted you to see him now as I said I want to I'll get to the other ones here I got a whole bunch brother Brahim says the Holy Ghost is the third person of the Trinity I got a quote brother am said it doesn't even matter how you're baptized Lord Jesus Christ if I almost don't even matter he said honey no why you guys get upset upset about he says when other times he's blasting it like you're gonna be rebaptised what which one is it it's the word it's the word this is the one he said they're seven weeks from Pentecost atonement that was it was four months four times four so it was 16 weeks not seven weeks and brother BAM said it's a mix-up on the tape he said but remember if there's a mix-up look in the Bible and this one by the Amen I were talking about earlier this year we had a preacher coming here and said oh well the new birth is different from the baptism remember that program does say that but then later on after the seals he said no it's all one in the same thing his brother branham his brother branham fallible Church yes is the Holy Ghost fallible no no the Holy Ghost is not fallible is the Holy Ghost infallible absolutely and that's what we're supposed to have in our souls and bodiham said it's like a little buzzer brother amen whenever you hear something wrong like when I heard these quotes so Oh literally when I heard that cord about brother Ram or Jesus not being on the throne a couple years ago it went the buzzer went off because what if I would preach that sister Wendy Jesus is not in heaven right now he's in you speak the word whatever you want have it right now what if I said that and what if she spoke it and then it come to pass would she have any confidence in me after that probably not and we got to be careful that sometimes happens at those special meetings or wherever there's a lot of excitement we got to be careful Church can you just speak the word well no you only speak it if he tells you to speak it don't ask according to your lust but ask according to the will of God musicians if you'll come by God's grace why you given that buzzer to protect your life but you don't go on this far side as we're seeing in Indiana we're seeing this far side go and they're just hanging their soul on every word on the tape I'm sorry I'm not doing that the tapes point me back to the Word of God and every word in here is thus saith the Lord that God allowed it and it's true right it's a true event of something that happened if it's not prophecy it's a true thing it's real but in other sizes we don't need brother Branham anymore well then you're leaving out water baptism in Jesus Christ's name you're leaving out casting out Devils and miracles you're leaving out this original scene you're leaving out God as was just one person so it's not either side it's right and with God's side in the Bible it's right in the middle of the road praise God let's just bow our heads here for a moment by the grace of the Lord and this this quote just comes to me you know we at our house we're listening through the seven seals right now we're in the breach but there's a quote in God hiding himself and simplicity brother Branham said the church we either going to one side of the it'll go into fanaticism where everything has to be emotion or I felt I felt that I felt it or I'll go on the side of cold intellectualism a church you and I know we're not we're not going on the side of fanaticism we're more tempted to go on the side of intellectualism my brother has had the bride of Jesus Christ has the understanding uses her mind to look to the word to discern the word but she's also got a real warmth in her heart with the emotion for the Holy Spirit how many want a warm heart here today where you feel the warm you feel the anointing but it's under control by the wisdom in your heart how many want that by God's grace let me pray for you that God will help you to grow in grace you pray for me that we will grow together in Grace and knowledge of the Lord and keep a warm heart for Jesus Christ and you don't get scared about the anointing you don't get scared but the anointing is under control to the Holy Spirit in your soul let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you today we thank you Lord that you're here to prove all things we honor your prophet we still believe he's a problem you always believe that but Lord we're showing father how the Bible is the absolute how every word of yours is the same to the holiday hallelujah thank you Lord and no flesh shall glory in your presence teach us plainly help us to grow in knowledge and understanding or help us to use our minds that you gave us through the leadership of God but let us also be open to the anointing of the Holy Spirit to feel warm in our heart and feel your holiness to feel the anointing are in our minds and our bodies give us the middle-of-the-road you're done let us not be cold stiff and starchy but let us be on fire for you Lord keeping the great belts I'll believe it when it's proved by the word I'll believe it when the Lord reveals it to me yeah hallelujah we pray for revelation there reveal yourself to your people and then let them take the time to go back to the Bible the fruit to believe that it's right or Paul said whether we are an angel and anything in the word its curse so we've got to take everything back to the word to agree with it and help me Lord help every preacher in the fivefold ministry help us as we witness not to say things what I believe I was guilty I was almost guilty what about Hillary Clinton becoming president Lord forgive me I never prophesied but I sure made it sound like it was gonna be that's my human mistake you're gonna just kind of predicted just want to be ready to your company or we've all got it dear god help us Lord to prove all things by the word of god help us to be humble enough to wait upon you as David said in Psalm 25 that the meek shall be guided by the moon help us to be humble help us to be be growing in grace yet with a warm heart of the Holy Spirit that's us now Lord in Jesus Christ the church said [Music] touching [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's where I belong see it your baby your laptop [Music] I just cannot worship all for you thank you all thank you for your word [Music] ladies doc no church that's a reality to me you know the reason I haven't preached those false doctrines because I was in his presence praise God are you with me I come across all those quotes reason I don't preach some of those things is because I got in his presence and as his presence is where he reveals the truth because he directs us to the word always to be ventured the people don't get this presence enough so they'll just say whatever but we're all guilty but that's why I appreciate the present it'll direct me away from my thoughts and directly to the word that's the beauty of spending time with the law how many enjoy spending time with the look my brother's saying about it earlier you found that secret police praise God we're secret things are revealed a other people stumble over these stumbling stones when you get God presents he helps you to kind of step over them so you don't stop just got to get this present that's right and stumble over that 1977 sister care as you were in this press experiment Allen area that's the power of the Holy Spirit brain I use that little buzzer to protect your money I will be taken away by that wind the doctor among the rock I'm on the rock of revelation of the word of God other dude say we need prayer today I'm gonna bring both Jose I bring someone let's pray for our brother [Music] [Music]
