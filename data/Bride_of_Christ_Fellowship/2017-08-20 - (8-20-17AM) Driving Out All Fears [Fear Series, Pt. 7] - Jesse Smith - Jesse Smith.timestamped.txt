[37:05] Lord the power Lord God to keep us Lord

[37:17] this morning Lord may we yield to thy
[37:19] spear Lord Jesus help me to yield how
[37:22] many get completely out of your way and
[37:23] may you be glorified and your children
[37:25] in Jesus Christ name Amen god bless you
[37:28] maybe later we'll have some slides
[37:43] uh-huh but I don't have them ready but
[37:45] don't think I'll put them up there right
[37:46] now
[37:47] [Music]
[37:50] you can switch over here I just want to
[37:53] review real quick from Wednesday and
[37:59] that was a real blessed time as we
[38:03] looked at the effects of fear and hope
[38:07] you've been enjoying the the lessons on
[38:09] fear praise God and I was texting a
[38:12] brother yesterday he said oh yeah we
[38:13] preach on that last year and it was such
[38:15] a blessing to the church and hope the
[38:16] same is true for our church amen
[38:18] hope it's been a blessing to hear the
[38:20] Word of God about fear now remember you
[38:23] and I are not given fear by God it it
[38:27] lays in our members I think Helen and I
[38:28] talked about it last time we have an
[38:31] automatic fear in our in our bodies and
[38:34] in our minds because we're human we're
[38:36] sinful we run a falling condition so
[38:40] many times you know you'll have a
[38:41] natural fear reaction but it depends
[38:44] what you do after you have that fear
[38:46] what's your decision after that that
[38:48] we'd say that bursts of fear what's our
[38:51] decision after that do we choose to feed
[38:53] that fear and let that fear overtake us
[38:56] or do we choose to cast that fear down
[38:59] and I think as believers I think we we
[39:01] can all agree that we're commanded to
[39:03] cast any fear down the Bible said that
[39:07] we must take the spirit of love power
[39:10] and a sound mind aren't you glad for
[39:12] love of God this morning
[39:13] now Wednesday we looked at different
[39:15] things the effects of fear we looked at
[39:18] how fear proves you actually don't
[39:20] believe the Word of God and the example
[39:22] is from Deuteronomy about the children
[39:24] of Israel
[39:25] when they got to Kadesh Barnea and they
[39:27] said all we're just grasshoppers there's
[39:29] no way we could we could possess the
[39:31] baptism of the holy ghost there's no way
[39:33] I could live that there's no way I could
[39:35] do there's no way I could overcome these
[39:36] trials when they said that Moses said
[39:39] later it proves you didn't believe the
[39:41] Lord your God so they got to the spot
[39:44] where it proved their fear proved they
[39:46] didn't believe the Lord also we saw that
[39:50] fear keeps people out of their
[39:51] inheritance which ties in with the first
[39:54] thought you know about Israel and fear
[39:56] will keep many people from doing what
[39:58] God's called them to do keep them from
[40:00] being a real godly father or mother or
[40:02] maybe a preacher or maybe a deacon or
[40:05] maybe a trustee or maybe whatever God's
[40:07] called them to be maybe a speaker in
[40:08] tongues maybe one who prophesize one who
[40:11] prays for the sick fear will keep
[40:13] someone from their calling in life fear
[40:17] is ultimately selfish we saw that with
[40:20] Gideon's army Gideon said everyone
[40:23] that's a fearful leave and instead of
[40:25] hanging you know with the group and
[40:27] saying well I'll die with you brother
[40:29] you know if you go out there and the
[40:30] minions defeat us out late I'll pour
[40:32] mile spill my blood with you instead of
[40:34] doing that they were so selfish
[40:36] twenty-two thousand left their army so
[40:39] fear is selfish and it causes someone to
[40:42] be isolated because those 22,000
[40:45] isolated themselves from the real move
[40:47] of God the message of the hour we'd say
[40:49] the army of God and fear then we saw
[40:52] make somebody useless in God's army they
[40:55] can't they can't do anything for God
[40:56] because of fear all because they're
[40:58] scared and fear actually brings on what
[41:02] we are fearing it's prophetic right
[41:04] because there's power of death in the
[41:07] tongue but also life Peter sink in the
[41:09] water was one example fear brings on
[41:12] what what we fear Joe what Joe fear came
[41:15] upon him Joe bus I've always been
[41:17] fearing off I ever lose my money oh I
[41:19] think one day I might lose my children
[41:21] or something like that and whatever he
[41:23] feared the Bible said it came upon him
[41:25] yet God saw him perfect through the
[41:28] blood of the sacrifice thank God for
[41:30] that and then we saw how this the last
[41:33] one here fear Lau's send us spread in
[41:35] the church because bishops are called to
[41:38] false teachers and then a little leaven
[41:41] leavens the whole lump so many times if
[41:43] if a church is just afraid to confront
[41:45] somebody about their fear or their sin
[41:47] or something that will spread out in the
[41:49] whole church well we're scared to
[41:51] approach the pastor he preached the
[41:52] false doctrine but we're scared to
[41:54] approach him
[41:54] well that will cause fear to spread or
[41:57] if I'm scared approach so and so well
[41:59] this person's a real heavy tithe payer
[42:01] or this person's a real popular person
[42:04] the church boy I don't know if I could
[42:05] remove them out of their position or
[42:07] something like that that fear will
[42:09] spread in the whole church like leaven
[42:12] and so real love of God has no fear fear
[42:17] feeds racism there's a lot of talk right
[42:19] now racism I think the media pumps it up
[42:21] to more than what it actually is I
[42:22] really don't think there's that much
[42:24] racism going on I just think it's a
[42:26] really small groups and remember the
[42:28] meat is always trying to get money to
[42:29] get people to watch their shows and
[42:31] advertisement
[42:32] so they put on their the worst news
[42:34] right they don't put the good news on
[42:36] there so I think they're making it
[42:39] bigger than what it is but but because
[42:40] of the impact of media that can spread
[42:44] Peter was great racist we say he's
[42:47] segregated himself from the Gentiles one
[42:49] time and the Bible said that's because
[42:51] he feared the Jews so the spirit of fear
[42:54] will cause people to segregate
[42:56] themselves away why I don't want to
[42:58] spend time with them they're not as holy
[42:59] or they're not you know they're not as
[43:01] good as us or I don't wanna lose my
[43:03] fellowship with that church so I won't
[43:05] fellowship with that church cuz that
[43:06] brother has it against that brother you
[43:07] know all kinds of racism and segregation
[43:09] divisions we'd say we saw how fear makes
[43:14] someone useless and guy okay that's just
[43:15] okay I must know I'm sorry the last one
[43:19] fear can destroy us all ultimately if
[43:22] someone is a fearful of God and we'll
[43:24] get to this later if someone has a fear
[43:27] of God and just is so scared of God you
[43:30] know and they don't have the right kind
[43:32] of fear of God if they have the wrong
[43:34] fear of God ultimately that fear can
[43:36] destroy their soul cuz they're never
[43:37] though never surrender they'll never
[43:39] repent
[43:40] they'll never serve God their heart will
[43:43] be a selfish heart and the Bible calls
[43:45] it an evil heart of unbelief so that
[43:49] will cause millions if not billions of
[43:50] people to lose their souls
[43:52] because they're fearful they have
[43:55] unbelief in God's Word they truly don't
[43:57] believe God will do what he said he will
[43:58] do if you repent and be baptized and
[44:01] truly believe that you shall receive the
[44:02] gift of the Holy Ghost
[44:03] somebody believe that if you lay hands
[44:06] on the sick they shall recover how many
[44:08] believe that we have to take God at His
[44:10] Word amen that proves of course if we
[44:13] believe it or not as we saw so we want
[44:18] to be mindful of those things now I want
[44:21] to briefly review last Sunday as well
[44:23] those seven nations that Joshua drove
[44:26] out I'm just gonna go right to the
[44:28] highlights and I shared him with my
[44:30] brother cam and he said oh wow where'd
[44:31] you get those I said either got them
[44:33] from their direct Hebrew names or from
[44:35] their the Bible occupations that that
[44:37] these that these seven nations occupied
[44:40] so if you missed it you can listen to it
[44:42] last Sunday hope if you don't listen to
[44:45] it you get a chance to do that so
[44:46] Canaanites were we got there the name we
[44:49] got this meaning from what they were
[44:51] they were the merchants the traders of
[44:53] all the manufacturing the richest people
[44:56] were the Canaanites in the promised land
[44:58] so I typed that to the love of money and
[45:02] then next was the Hittites which Hittite
[45:07] means a son of Heth and the name hef in
[45:10] the hebrew means dread or fear so that's
[45:13] clearly typed out as fear remember these
[45:16] you drive all these out after you get
[45:19] the Holy Ghost and after you cross
[45:21] Jordan after you're taking the Promised
[45:23] Land amen
[45:24] after you been circumcised they men like
[45:27] the new generation glory amen
[45:30] that's when you start taking on these in
[45:32] a real way amen because they remember
[45:34] many of these are Giants and you never
[45:37] had real battles about Ram said do you
[45:39] get the Holy Ghost you never have a real
[45:41] battle a real one to get real ice a real
[45:43] hard one a giant one hivite remember
[45:48] compromising with worldliness okay yeah
[45:51] cuz the Hittites were the Gibby Knights
[45:53] and Israel made a league or a friendship
[45:55] with the gig and gimme night so this was
[45:57] compromising or friendship with the
[46:00] world and many times were tempted to do
[46:02] that well we won't exactly share with
[46:04] our co-workers or our family what we
[46:06] believe
[46:06] even or it might be like a bad
[46:09] relationship friendship with the world
[46:10] is flirting with the world something
[46:13] like that
[46:14] parasites were the carnal mightiness
[46:17] because parasites were keepers of the
[46:20] I'm sorry they were they dwelt upon the
[46:21] clay and clay represents the flesh and
[46:23] so they were caught in flesh is carnal
[46:26] carnal minded and many people are men in
[46:29] carmell a carnal mind they'll say I'm
[46:31] appalled I'm of Apollo's I'm a Peter I'm
[46:33] a Cephas you know all these things and
[46:35] that's what they'll say today they'll
[46:36] say I'm a brother so-and-so I'm a
[46:38] brother so-and-so I'm a brother
[46:40] so-and-so and they're carnal and they've
[46:42] got a battle that after they get into
[46:44] the promised land girgashites were
[46:47] double minded instability unstable were
[46:51] the girgashites I don't member much on
[46:53] necks I'm just reviewing my rights were
[46:55] the these were the giant fleshy lust the
[46:57] am rights were the last remaining giants
[46:59] of course there were Philistines outside
[47:00] of the land you know that were giants
[47:02] later but these were the last remaining
[47:04] Giants in the land so these were giant
[47:06] fleshly lusts that you got to overcome
[47:08] any time it's like maybe it's a maybe
[47:11] it's a adultery in the in the minds of
[47:13] men right that's a fleshly lust men got
[47:15] to overcome it's a battle the RAM said I
[47:17] the Holy Ghost for years so I and I
[47:19] battled the lustful thoughts had to put
[47:20] a he said I put a cross in my car so
[47:23] that when a woman walked down the street
[47:25] that was pretty I take my eyes off of
[47:26] her and put it on Jesus
[47:28] these are fleshly lusts maybe it's
[47:31] overeating or maybe it's a anorexia you
[47:34] know something like that some fleshly
[47:36] battles that people fight maybe it's
[47:37] battling to try to cut the hair again or
[47:40] makeup or or something like that or
[47:42] brothers being tempted to go back to
[47:43] drinking or smoking its fleshly lusts
[47:46] that war against your soul and then
[47:49] Gebbie sites were the the complexes
[47:52] because that word jab you jeebus means
[47:56] stronghold fastness or stronghold so and
[48:00] that was brother Rams last battle
[48:02] according to Owen Jorgenson when he
[48:03] studied his life he said his last battle
[48:05] that he ever had to get victory over was
[48:07] the complex about preaching to the
[48:09] people so that was interesting that was
[48:12] the seventh the last one
[48:14] very interesting now let's get to our
[48:16] scriptures like I said I'm gonna try to
[48:18] keep this message sort anyhow
[48:20] because we have communion by the grace
[48:23] of Lord and I know people get hungry and
[48:25] everything like that but let's look at
[48:27] this here now I want you to remember
[48:30] this because this ties in perfectly with
[48:32] with our scriptures what actually drove
[48:36] out the inhabitants for Israel if you
[48:40] search the scriptures you're gonna find
[48:41] a two fold a two phone meaning of what
[48:44] drove it out first of all it was God's
[48:47] love and God's promise drove it out so
[48:52] let's look at let's look at the
[48:53] scripture I don't remember this
[48:54] Deuteronomy for and because he loved
[48:57] their fathers therefore he chose their
[49:01] seat after them and brought thee out in
[49:02] his sight with his mighty power out of
[49:04] Egypt to drive out nations from before
[49:07] thee greater mightier than thou art to
[49:09] bring the in see the baptism Holy Ghost
[49:11] to give thee their land for an
[49:13] inheritance as it is this day amen so
[49:18] why why did God drive out these
[49:20] inhabitants one reason was God loved the
[49:22] father's God loved Israel remember we
[49:26] went over last week the reason those
[49:27] seven nations had to be driven out
[49:29] because they were so evil God had given
[49:31] them over 900 years to repent and they
[49:33] failed to repent now that's love and
[49:35] mercy God gave you nine hundred years or
[49:38] God God will give us a whole lifetime
[49:39] that's love and mercy Church gotta give
[49:41] somebody a whole lifetime to repent and
[49:43] get things right and if they don't then
[49:45] that's their decision but God is
[49:47] constantly offering the Bible said God
[49:49] is ready to pardon he's always willing
[49:52] to pardon us and forgive us he's ready
[49:54] like the fabi's waiting for you to run
[49:55] back to the father's house amen so it's
[49:58] his love that does this it's his love
[50:00] that drove them out because they were
[50:02] murdering their babies it kind of sounds
[50:03] like America today abortion and they
[50:06] built groves and they worshiped all
[50:08] their gods other than the true Living
[50:10] God in the chapter seven so three
[50:13] chapters later he says it again the Lord
[50:15] did not set his love upon you nor choose
[50:18] you because you were more in number than
[50:20] any people so other words God didn't
[50:21] look at Israel and say oh you're the
[50:23] biggest nation I'm gonna love you for ye
[50:26] were the fewest of all people now that
[50:28] encourages us God can look at our church
[50:29] this morning and say you're the smallest
[50:31] Church in Akron and I Love You amen
[50:33] because God's not looking for the
[50:35] biggest church he's looking for the
[50:36] church that he made the promise to Amen
[50:38] the one that he loved their fathers he's
[50:41] looking for the seed of Abraham glory
[50:44] and when we have faith in Christ Jesus
[50:46] the Bible said in Galatians three we are
[50:48] the seed of Abraham amen now look here's
[50:52] that there's the twofold I'm sorry I'm
[50:56] sorry I forgot to switch over here
[50:57] number verse eight but because the Lord
[51:00] loved you and because he would keep the
[51:03] oath which he had sworn into your
[51:05] father's half the Lord brought you out
[51:06] with the mighty hand and redeem you up a
[51:08] house of bondman from the hand of
[51:10] Pharaoh king of Egypt humming of the
[51:12] Lord it was God's love and God's promise
[51:16] that drove them out what's the Bible say
[51:18] perfect love casts out all the
[51:20] inhabitants amen
[51:21] it is God's love for you and I that will
[51:25] drive out any inhabitant any demon power
[51:28] that we're battling it'll be God's love
[51:31] that does it we must just submit to that
[51:34] love and yes we have a duty we must obey
[51:36] the Lord we must put the Lord first we
[51:39] would not we must not be like akin as we
[51:41] saw on Sunday night last Sunday night we
[51:43] must not look after that Babylonian
[51:45] garments I really like to dress like the
[51:47] world or I'll never like that gold wedge
[51:51] and those silver coins all that money
[51:53] and all those although those blessings
[51:55] of being a sinner
[51:56] no although we must cast that down don't
[52:00] take that into your house and don't bear
[52:01] it in your house right don't bear it in
[52:03] your heart and mind cast it out amen
[52:05] remember because God did the same thing
[52:07] when Israel put compressed past the
[52:09] promised land God did the same thing the
[52:11] first people that sin God killed him
[52:14] the New Testament the first people that
[52:16] got that sin Ananias and Sapphira God
[52:18] killed them
[52:19] it's a beautiful type it's the beautiful
[52:22] type when you get in the baptism Holy
[52:24] Ghost God requires you to walk in love
[52:26] amen he requires all the people to walk
[52:30] in the love and obey and obey the Lord
[52:32] Jesus it's not a it's not a picnic it's
[52:35] a battlefield amen we must make sure our
[52:38] lives constantly line up with God's Word
[52:40] if we're to conquer and possess the land
[52:42] that's right Church that's right now I
[52:45] want you to see this here
[52:47] so what will drive out our inhabitants
[52:49] we remember this of course we just said
[52:53] it earlier here as our love made perfect
[52:55] our love our love our love is perfect
[52:58] when we act we can have boldness when we
[53:00] die or when we go to God's throne that's
[53:03] when your love is complete when you know
[53:04] that you love Jesus so much and Jesus
[53:07] loves you so much that you're in have
[53:09] boldness that God's throne this is what
[53:12] our love is made perfect that we may
[53:13] have boldness in the day of judgment
[53:15] because as he is so are we in this world
[53:17] what does that mean that means the
[53:19] nature of God is living in my life as
[53:22] God's nature is in heaven that's how my
[53:25] life is on earth amen and when you see
[53:29] the life of Christ in you when you see
[53:31] Christ living in you in such a way where
[53:33] I can recognize this is not the old
[53:35] Jesse Smith this is a new one amen this
[53:37] is a new believer I see I see my life
[53:40] looking like his life when we can see
[53:42] the life of Christ and our lives that we
[53:44] can say devil I've got boldness I'm
[53:46] filled with the love of God God loves me
[53:49] I love him and I have boldness even if
[53:51] you take my life amen I'll have boldness
[53:54] in the Day of Judgment how many one
[53:56] boldness amen
[53:57] because there's no fear in love but
[54:00] perfect love casteth out fear because
[54:04] fear hath torment he that feareth is not
[54:08] made perfect in love remember as we said
[54:12] last Wednesday this isn't a one-year
[54:14] battle it took Joshua years and years
[54:17] and years to kick out all seven nations
[54:20] it took him years
[54:21] remember God said if I Drive mountain
[54:23] one year then the beasts are gonna take
[54:24] over right the beasts are gonna take
[54:27] over maybe your beastly nature we get
[54:29] all prideful right if he lets you get
[54:31] all the victories in one year
[54:32] your beastly nature your human nature
[54:34] you thought oh I had something to do
[54:37] with this and God said it's not about
[54:38] you it's about me amen
[54:39] I we just yield we just yield and watch
[54:43] God whenever we seen America what
[54:44] happens it's just God it's just us
[54:46] yielding to God God takes over God does
[54:49] it amen it's just so beautiful so how
[54:54] many 1 be filled with perfect love
[54:55] now here's I want to and here's how I
[54:58] remember we went over it briefly a few
[54:59] weeks ago and I kinda
[55:01] short names when my mother-in-law was
[55:02] here on a Wednesday night and it was
[55:04] nice and she was leaving the next day
[55:05] she looked at me tapped me on the
[55:06] shoulder she said I really enjoyed your
[55:08] sermon Jessie well thank you I
[55:10] appreciate that
[55:11] that was happy to hear that you know but
[55:15] we preach on that and and we if we're
[55:18] starting out and we have fear in our
[55:19] lives what we must first do is remember
[55:21] God's love because as the is the
[55:25] goodness of God that will lead us to
[55:26] repent to get the fear out so the first
[55:29] step is remember how much God loves us
[55:31] and then when you remember how much God
[55:33] loves you then you can repent so as
[55:36] first remembers love repent then when
[55:39] you repent you have no condemnation and
[55:41] then you're filled with the love of God
[55:43] when you truly repent that love
[55:45] automatically flows back into your human
[55:46] spirit and then that perfect love can
[55:49] cash out all the fear amen and then now
[55:52] that you're filled off with love there's
[55:54] no more fear now that love will operate
[55:56] your faith because the Bible said faith
[55:58] worketh by love
[56:00] hey Tommy do it church right there
[56:03] that's the simple we say mechanics of it
[56:06] don't you love the Lord Amen have you
[56:08] seen that operate in your life I hope
[56:09] you have by the grace of the Lord
[56:12] repentance and then loving God and then
[56:14] driving out the fear then now faith can
[56:17] operate by the love that we have the
[56:19] confidence we have in Christ Jesus now I
[56:22] want to read a few quotations that will
[56:24] bring this to light a little more I want
[56:25] you to see this here this is how we
[56:27] drive out the inhabitants and it deals
[56:30] with confessing the word how many know
[56:31] we need to confess the word more we must
[56:34] believe the word and confess the word I
[56:38] don't know what giant you're facing
[56:40] today I don't know I don't know what I
[56:43] don't know if you're in the wilderness
[56:45] no driving trying to press in the
[56:46] Promised Land or I don't know if you're
[56:48] facing a giant in the Promised Land but
[56:51] one thing we know is that the love of
[56:53] God will drive out any giant that stands
[56:55] before you it might be a fleshy lust or
[56:59] it might be a spiritual battle like a
[57:00] complex against somebody or an arrogancy
[57:03] or something like that right
[57:05] it might be an indifference just feel
[57:07] like going against somebody you know it
[57:10] might be a temper oh you're just getting
[57:12] hot and angry at this person I
[57:15] know what you're battling but Jesus
[57:16] Christ is here to set you free amen
[57:18] he's here to give you the victory he's
[57:21] here to drive out any inhabitant you're
[57:23] balan this morning that's exactly right
[57:26] so we would see Jesus when God gave
[57:29] Israel the promised land while they were
[57:30] still in Egypt they had to fight for
[57:32] every inch of that land God told Joshua
[57:35] in Joshua 1 wherever the soles of your
[57:38] foot treads upon that I've given you for
[57:41] a possession so footprints means
[57:43] possession some people can just get just
[57:46] barely get to the edge of the land look
[57:48] some people just get there some people
[57:49] just get the sanctification but thank
[57:51] God for it
[57:52] we're not downing people that can only
[57:54] go so far with God we're thankful
[57:56] outside of this were cheering them on
[57:58] amen we're praying for them Abraham was
[58:00] praying and cheering on lot amen Lord
[58:02] save him leave he was desperate for me
[58:05] men birthday as far as you can get with
[58:08] God hallelujah get as far as you can get
[58:10] with God amen but we're always saying
[58:12] that this though that if you want more
[58:13] of God there is more of God for you amen
[58:18] because the worst one the worst place we
[58:20] can get and I want to get to it later
[58:22] the worst demon to deal with is the
[58:26] religious demon which is someone I go to
[58:29] church I think I got it all figured out
[58:30] and my ways the right way that's the
[58:33] worst one to deal with notice I said
[58:36] deal with to try to bring to repentance
[58:38] because they think they got it all
[58:39] figured out they think they know
[58:40] everything they know more than the
[58:41] preachers they know more than the
[58:43] brothers and sisters they know more than
[58:44] everybody that's the worst one to deal
[58:47] with because mother have said that's the
[58:48] one that crucified Jesus when the real
[58:51] word was coming in to try to do a move
[58:53] of God they knew all about it they
[58:54] kicked out people if you follow that
[58:56] word because they knew all about it so
[58:58] god help us not to have a religious
[58:59] spirit but get as far as you can go with
[59:03] God some people can just get barely get
[59:06] to the edge of land some can take the
[59:08] two-handed sword and cut their way
[59:10] through the Philistines and am right so
[59:12] they take the whole thing
[59:14] amen that's what we should do every
[59:18] promise is to us footprints as a
[59:21] possession walk right up and take it God
[59:23] give it to us it's a promise and it's
[59:25] the truth
[59:26] it's for us
[59:28] next one God talked to Moses Jesus
[59:32] Christ is here we'll make every person
[59:34] the building well if you'll believe it
[59:36] now if you'll accept it right now and
[59:39] say Lord I accept it as my personal
[59:41] property I know I have the Holy Spirit I
[59:44] am into your kingdom here I am in your
[59:47] grape variety store and I have a right
[59:49] for healing and I'm just going to walk
[59:51] over here and step up on the ladder and
[59:53] climb up and take it off and come on
[59:55] down and then ain't nobody going to tell
[59:57] me nothing about it because Jesus Christ
[59:59] has done brought me in here and said all
[1:00:02] these things was mine so pretty you ever
[1:00:05] seen those TV shows where they give
[1:00:06] somebody a shopping spree I've seen the
[1:00:09] ones with grocery stores they'll give
[1:00:10] him like a one-minute shopping spree you
[1:00:12] ever seen what do they do Church they
[1:00:14] take that they take that grocery cart
[1:00:17] and they just run down the aisles and
[1:00:19] throw it you ever seen that brother Ram
[1:00:20] said that's what God has done to us
[1:00:22] except we have more than a minute we've
[1:00:25] got as long as we can believe amen glory
[1:00:29] they said oh yeah I saw the Bueller's
[1:00:31] one time they were getting ready now I
[1:00:33] was in there cuz I used to work there
[1:00:34] but at Bueller's they had a one minute
[1:00:35] shopping spree and they got all the
[1:00:38] decorations and they were all excited
[1:00:41] this person is gonna be on TV
[1:00:42] they got one minute to get whatever they
[1:00:44] want I thought my that's pretty that's
[1:00:47] fine but how much more do we have in
[1:00:48] Christ Jesus that's what it's like it's
[1:00:52] like a free shopping spree in God's
[1:00:55] variety store and programs so you can go
[1:00:59] in there and if you need healing and
[1:01:00] it's way up there it looks like it's way
[1:01:02] far away he said just get a ladder climb
[1:01:04] up there by your faithful prayers grab
[1:01:07] that promise I am the Lord and heal
[1:01:09] the-- and bring it down that's what it's
[1:01:13] like like at Walmart or Sam's Club you
[1:01:16] know they have the shelves and shelves
[1:01:17] and I get low sometimes what I want is
[1:01:19] way up there on the shelf and it will
[1:01:21] discourage me like I don't have to call
[1:01:22] that guy to get that and I got to go
[1:01:25] cause I gotta get the ladder and you
[1:01:27] know how they got to do that to make
[1:01:29] sure they're safe and sometimes it kind
[1:01:32] of discourages me from one do that but
[1:01:33] spiritually we should not be discouraged
[1:01:35] if their promise is up on the second
[1:01:37] shelf it just means we need more help
[1:01:39] amen but I'm still in the store
[1:01:42] this is still my father's store praise
[1:01:44] God and he's the one that let me in here
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:47] hallelujah I could not let myself in
[1:01:50] there he had to let me in his store I
[1:01:53] ran said Satan will start talking to you
[1:01:55] when we preached like this and the devil
[1:01:57] is standing at the window of the store
[1:01:58] and say hey you can't do that or you
[1:02:01] can't have God's promise you can't have
[1:02:03] divine healing you can't have peace you
[1:02:05] can't have that humble spirit you can't
[1:02:07] have the first love and brother man said
[1:02:09] this is what you say oh I can't then
[1:02:12] watch me he says that's right see if I
[1:02:14] don't take God at His Word see if I
[1:02:16] don't take God's promise amen
[1:02:19] because he let me in here praise the
[1:02:22] Lord run around so when you get the Holy
[1:02:24] Ghost it's like going into a room and
[1:02:26] you say there's a piano there's a chair
[1:02:28] there's a couch and God will use you on
[1:02:30] different things and that's what he says
[1:02:31] like the gifts are the piano might be we
[1:02:34] say the gift of tongues or and the couch
[1:02:36] might be interpretation of tongues we
[1:02:38] are let in by God God's the one who
[1:02:41] invited us in he said whosoever will let
[1:02:44] him come amen and drink of the waters of
[1:02:46] life freely praise God this is how we
[1:02:49] must see the promises of God can you say
[1:02:51] Amen
[1:02:54] he said say now you better not so the
[1:02:57] devil say you better not testify your
[1:03:00] heel before you feel something ramm said
[1:03:04] feel something brother I don't feel
[1:03:06] something I believe something I believe
[1:03:09] what God said is the truth don't you
[1:03:12] later he says Jesus didn't say beat unto
[1:03:16] you according to you feel
[1:03:17] he said beat unto you according to your
[1:03:19] faith it's about what you believe not at
[1:03:22] what you feel it's about what we believe
[1:03:24] Amen that's right he said oh God
[1:03:29] til tonight there's not even one of
[1:03:31] these cases in the building I thank thee
[1:03:33] Lord for thy power and as I pray as we
[1:03:35] as your living church tonight challenge
[1:03:37] the devil will not let any hit Ike or
[1:03:41] Canaanite or anything else stand in our
[1:03:43] way

[1:03:46] believing God's Word and that the angel
[1:03:50] of God is here to lead us Howie

[1:03:58] drive out the Jebusites those complexes

[1:05:38] discontent that I feel or this fear that
[1:05:40] I feel or this anger or temper or hatred

[1:05:45] Jesus Christ name I'm gonna believe his
[1:05:48] promise I'm gonna challenge that cruel
[1:05:50] ungodly spirit and I'm gonna get a
[1:05:52] victory over Satan amen that's how we
[1:05:54] can expect to get the victory amen
[1:05:58] praise the Lord
[1:06:00] he said there was another there's
[1:06:02] another that's right stand up and praise
[1:06:03] the god holly there you are God be
[1:06:05] blessed and God be praised amen
[1:06:08] here's
[1:06:09] the wings that was snow-white dub look
[1:06:10] at this this is quite a situation the
[1:06:13] Provost said this woman never had a
[1:06:15] peaceful night in her whole life never
[1:06:18] can you imagine that I have a couple in
[1:06:20] a week and I feel like I'm about ready
[1:06:21] to quit I'm ready to give up cuz I
[1:06:23] really need sleep and I don't get a
[1:06:25] whole lot that's my own fault many times
[1:06:27] but if I say I'm attacted with an evil
[1:06:29] dream or you know some attack of the
[1:06:31] enemy I just get so discouraged I get so
[1:06:33] tired but look he says have faith all of
[1:06:36] you pray with us now lucky there's a
[1:06:38] blank spot he's in the prayer line
[1:06:40] depression and fear I know what this
[1:06:43] poor little thing she said she's never
[1:06:46] seen peace in life can you imagine to
[1:06:51] never have peace how many could you
[1:06:52] raise your head how many have felt peace
[1:06:53] in their life and with God look at all
[1:06:55] those hands you felt peace well this
[1:06:58] woman comes and she's never felt that
[1:07:01] can you imagine
[1:07:02] never felt the peace of God that means
[1:07:04] she's felt at war with God all her life
[1:07:06] I never feel right I could never rest I
[1:07:08] could never have any peace with God I
[1:07:11] feel like God hates me or gods fighting
[1:07:13] against me not one time has she ever
[1:07:17] feel peace in her life now if you just
[1:07:19] go through a hard week or a hard month
[1:07:21] sometimes we get discouraged right but
[1:07:25] we must remember I'm fighting and
[1:07:27] inhabitant Satan's trying to take my
[1:07:29] possession I've got to drive it out I've
[1:07:33] got the power in Christ to drive it out
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:37] now look what he says can't sleep
[1:07:40] nervous tension later I'm going to show
[1:07:44] you brother Ram said this feeling of
[1:07:46] having nervousness and he said distress
[1:07:50] nervousness and the stress he said is
[1:07:52] the worst feeling that you can ever have
[1:07:56] that's why people commit suicide is one
[1:07:58] of the saddest things they are truly
[1:08:00] hurting but they've let the demon powers
[1:08:03] make them feel that way right
[1:08:06] we can't excuse that and say well that's
[1:08:07] okay it's a sin it's not it's not it's
[1:08:10] not the worsen it's not the unpardonable
[1:08:11] sin but suicide is still a sin because
[1:08:14] you're yielding and giving in to the
[1:08:16] spirits of nervousness tension
[1:08:19] oppression distress hopelessness
[1:08:23] you're giving into all these things when
[1:08:25] God is offering and inviting you into a
[1:08:27] whole variety store of peace and love
[1:08:29] and power and victory and joy amen
[1:08:32] he's saying he's saying Adam he's saying
[1:08:34] bang come on into the store come into my
[1:08:38] variety store I got peace joy love we'll
[1:08:40] take whatever you want and people will
[1:08:43] shy away in fear and think that the only
[1:08:47] way out the only hope I have is to go
[1:08:50] and my life now they can still be safe
[1:08:53] right a person who sins in suicide can
[1:08:56] still be saved cuz that's what happened
[1:08:57] to Saul King saw he was still saved he
[1:08:59] tried to kill himself didn't make it
[1:09:01] then somebody killed him right he
[1:09:03] attempted suicide he was still saved but
[1:09:05] church he lost a great reward and if
[1:09:09] you're struggling today with depression
[1:09:11] or nervousness or can't sleep there's
[1:09:13] hope in Christ Jesus this morning but
[1:09:16] God is asking you to drive out the
[1:09:18] inhabitant praise the Lord one time in
[1:09:22] South America I cast a demon off his
[1:09:24] sister and it came back in - it was in a
[1:09:26] few days I think we saw her three days
[1:09:27] later and it was back on her she was
[1:09:29] like just all back into that same stereo
[1:09:32] awfulness and I said what happened to
[1:09:33] her and they said we don't know she just
[1:09:35] went back to that that's happened many
[1:09:37] times happens many times in the
[1:09:39] scripture jesus said if you cast out a
[1:09:41] demon out of a house and if you don't
[1:09:42] put a strongman in the house it's gonna
[1:09:44] get seven more and come back and then
[1:09:49] the words the last case is worse than
[1:09:51] the first so see when when we assert
[1:09:55] when we start serving God we've got to
[1:09:56] give everything we've got to God amen if
[1:10:00] somebody gives up and and gets weak a
[1:10:02] one time with sin it was I say with
[1:10:04] drugs like we said last Sunday it'll
[1:10:06] take him to alcohol then they might get
[1:10:08] drunk and then that will take them to
[1:10:09] cocaine and that will take them to
[1:10:11] what's next you know meth and all these
[1:10:14] things it'll take them so far just by
[1:10:16] letting up on one thing we got it's a
[1:10:18] joy to serve the Lord it's a joy to
[1:10:19] clean out our lives amen
[1:10:21] it's a joy to invite a stronger one into
[1:10:24] your home the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:26] it's a joy to have that it's a shame to
[1:10:30] send though and let's send come into our
[1:10:31] lives and we should feel a shame when we
[1:10:33] sin we should
[1:10:36] now look what he tells this woman here I
[1:10:38] think I have two slides on this yeah two
[1:10:42] slides on this look we tell us he starts
[1:10:44] praying she can't sleep she never felt
[1:10:46] peace one day our life now none of us
[1:10:47] have ever had that as far as I know
[1:10:50] you've never had any peace look what he
[1:10:52] look what he prays
[1:10:53] dear God bear me record Lord that I've
[1:10:54] told the truth how I feel for this
[1:10:57] little woman I pray God that you'll send
[1:10:59] her tonight that streak of faith Amen
[1:11:03] streak of faith from above in other
[1:11:05] words like a lightning bolt
[1:11:06] Lord send a spiritual lightning bolt
[1:11:08] down to this person that knows that you
[1:11:11] are obligated to your word and you'll
[1:11:13] keep every word may the God of heaven
[1:11:15] take this fear away from my sister and I
[1:11:19] obey you by laying my hands upon her and
[1:11:21] commending it I'm sorry condemning it in
[1:11:23] the name of Jesus Christ may it come out
[1:11:25] of her amen he said now look sister you
[1:11:28] believe me now if you can start from
[1:11:30] right here by the cross from this night
[1:11:34] deny you got it see go on saying I
[1:11:39] haven't got it no more then it will
[1:11:41] leave you
[1:11:42] it hasn't left her yet because God for
[1:11:45] some reason let it stay on her until she
[1:11:48] drove it out are you with me Church it
[1:11:51] was her responsibility you've got to
[1:11:53] drive it out and I talked to many people
[1:11:54] like that they say brother Justin will
[1:11:56] you pray for me and drive off this demon
[1:11:57] power I'd tried that before and it
[1:12:00] doesn't happen for many people because
[1:12:02] they still love that demon so much
[1:12:04] especially with addictions like drinking
[1:12:06] smoking or lust people I've had a couple
[1:12:09] brothers or a couple people lately ask
[1:12:11] me that and I pray for them but then I
[1:12:13] just told them I said I shouldn't pray
[1:12:15] for you until you fully died to it
[1:12:17] because then it'll just come back or
[1:12:19] won't move because whatever you love
[1:12:21] will possess your heart right whatever
[1:12:24] treasures you have will be your
[1:12:25] treasures you know if you want treasures
[1:12:27] in heaven and then you'll cast out
[1:12:29] everything on this earth but if you want
[1:12:30] treasure on the earth you'll keep
[1:12:31] falling in love with more and more sin
[1:12:36] look at this from this night on the
[1:12:39] night you got got what tonight you got
[1:12:40] what deny deny the the war with God and
[1:12:44] claim peace amen
[1:12:45] deny the fact that you can't sleep deny
[1:12:48] that say I can sleep
[1:12:50] I've got peace denied nervousness deny
[1:12:53] attention say I'm not nervous
[1:12:54] I have no tension because Christ has set
[1:12:57] me free a streak of faith has struck my
[1:12:59] heart and I'm gonna drive out this
[1:13:01] inhabitant I've never felt it before but
[1:13:03] I have peace now Amen I'm going in the
[1:13:05] name of Jesus
[1:13:06] how do you praise the Lord so simple you
[1:13:11] would think what brother just isn't it
[1:13:12] more complicating that no it's not more
[1:13:15] complicated than that you have to die to
[1:13:16] yourself right repent of your sins and
[1:13:18] then claim the promise of God and drive
[1:13:21] out that evil inhabitant by the word of
[1:13:23] the Lord
[1:13:23] that's right now look here's another one
[1:13:26] I make this is yeah I think I read this
[1:13:31] yeah I read this I think I finished with
[1:13:33] this on Wednesday night if I'm not
[1:13:34] mistaken
[1:13:34] Loran said I may go through the hittites
[1:13:36] through the Canaanites I may have to
[1:13:38] pass through my own criticizing Lord
[1:13:40] I'll just keep moving on so see one of
[1:13:43] the ways to drive out it is to just keep
[1:13:45] moving on
[1:13:46] just keep possessing keep believing keep
[1:13:49] confessing I'm gonna drive out a hittite
[1:13:51] amen glory drive out inhabitant amen
[1:13:54] the next one the Prophet said this in
[1:13:57] 1983 was you here last night when I was
[1:13:59] speaking on taking the Hittites and the
[1:14:01] sea just push them out of the way now
[1:14:04] and go on thanking God for being healed
[1:14:07] this is how you drive them out you use
[1:14:10] the power of the word the power of the
[1:14:12] word the power of the word and Church
[1:14:14] this is what you have to imagine if
[1:14:16] you're sick you got to drive that
[1:14:17] sickness one step at a time I'm well I'm
[1:14:21] healed in Jesus name
[1:14:22] or I don't have anger and the next day
[1:14:24] you gotta push it a little further and
[1:14:25] keep pushing it until it's completely
[1:14:27] driven out and now you possess all this
[1:14:30] land Haim head you possess all this land
[1:14:33] you might not possess anything but just
[1:14:35] take one step at a time
[1:14:36] little by little well I made one day now
[1:14:39] I can make it the next day the next day
[1:14:40] drive it all the way out and now you
[1:14:43] have all this area to praise the Lord
[1:14:45] now you have all this room all this
[1:14:46] ability all this opportunity to serve
[1:14:49] Christ the way you ought to amen
[1:14:51] exactly right hallelujah that's how I
[1:14:54] overcome chewing tobacco
[1:14:56] I just kept throwing it out one day I
[1:14:57] was maybe it was like this one day I
[1:15:00] threw it out but then the next day I
[1:15:02] went and get it I take a step back
[1:15:04] and then one day I threw it out and in
[1:15:07] two weeks God knows this is my witness I
[1:15:09] didn't think about chewing tobacco for
[1:15:11] two weeks after being addicted for three
[1:15:13] or four years and doing it every day all
[1:15:14] day after that two weeks went by and
[1:15:18] supernaturally God was helping me push
[1:15:20] it out because I prayed for I'd asked
[1:15:22] for I'd believe for and so at the end of
[1:15:24] two weeks I get to this spot over here
[1:15:25] my my I haven't chewed tobacco for two
[1:15:27] weeks no way am i letting that demon
[1:15:30] come back on my land God gave me this
[1:15:32] land and we've kept the demon off the
[1:15:34] land for 15 years amen
[1:15:42] Christian's we can drive it out by the
[1:15:44] Word of God by the Word of God that's
[1:15:52] one way to drive all your happiness
[1:15:54] today you have to leave that door and
[1:15:56] walk out to your car and you got to keep
[1:15:59] thanking God for your victory over that
[1:16:01] it happens if you up and stop and you
[1:16:05] got to start again right get back on
[1:16:07] fight him back get get that land back it
[1:16:09] may go back and forth but you're gonna
[1:16:11] be the victor if you've got Christ Jesus
[1:16:13] amen you cannot fail because his word
[1:16:16] cannot fail amen exactly right
[1:16:20] now I did I was gonna put another quote
[1:16:22] there and I didn't have time to get one
[1:16:23] so remember this quote brother Adam said
[1:16:26] I'm coming down too close here it's
[1:16:29] gonna be one of my shortest sermons ever
[1:16:32] you remember this story by the band told
[1:16:35] about Jesus crossing the sea
[1:16:37] Jesus was tired after one of his
[1:16:39] meetings I believe it was a mark for if
[1:16:40] I'm not mistaken and the Bible said
[1:16:45] Jesus wanted to take a nap he want to
[1:16:47] take it he wonders he was in the boat he
[1:16:49] said let me take a rest so he takes the
[1:16:51] rest in the boat and program said that
[1:16:55] that spiritually he said there was ten
[1:16:58] thousand demons hovering above the
[1:17:00] waters and they'd sworn they were gonna
[1:17:03] drown Jesus Christ that's right because
[1:17:08] demons hate messengers of light right
[1:17:12] and so the Bible said Satan you know to
[1:17:15] control the winds and everything like
[1:17:17] that
[1:17:18] and there's all these winds and all this
[1:17:20] and you remember the story you know
[1:17:22] before the wind started all this the the
[1:17:24] disciples were testifying Jesus did this
[1:17:26] Jesus did that Jesus did that Jesus did
[1:17:28] that but then when the storm came they
[1:17:30] got scared and their faith muscles kind
[1:17:32] of shrunk because they see the storms
[1:17:37] and they they have to go shake and wake
[1:17:39] up Jesus they Jesus wake up or if you
[1:17:42] don't come out we're gonna perish
[1:17:44] and Jesus said where is your faith o ye
[1:17:46] of little faith where's your faith in
[1:17:51] other words Jesus saying you have the
[1:17:53] same power that I have and the only real
[1:17:56] all you have to do is speak the word and
[1:17:58] believe it's going to happen these
[1:18:01] twelve disciples were no more special
[1:18:04] than you and I I was studying a few
[1:18:06] months ago tax-collectors plane
[1:18:09] fisherman
[1:18:11] religious zealot you know the zealot
[1:18:13] thought was the Simon the zealot he was
[1:18:16] just a zealous church remember in the
[1:18:17] wrong church you know you these guys
[1:18:20] weren't anything that special they were
[1:18:21] just the humble guys and they constantly
[1:18:24] failed God they argue about who is the
[1:18:26] greater is vain greater or Loras greater
[1:18:28] huh who's the best member in the church
[1:18:30] here they they argued about who was
[1:18:32] greater they were in other words they
[1:18:33] were human like you and I are human and
[1:18:36] yet Jesus looked at them and said if you
[1:18:38] have faith just to speak the word and
[1:18:41] don't doubt you could do the same thing
[1:18:44] there's a Thousand Devils surrounding
[1:18:49] and all Jesus did was stand up and
[1:18:50] recognize that he was the son of God
[1:18:52] amen and the Bible said he said peace be
[1:18:56] still and the Bible said in just a
[1:18:59] moment everything departed one time I
[1:19:01] was driving to pray for my grandpa he
[1:19:03] was in the hospital in Toledo and I
[1:19:06] didn't check the weather that morning
[1:19:08] and I got on route 76 west and church
[1:19:15] the darkest greatest blackest clouds I
[1:19:17] ever saw came right down in front of me
[1:19:19] I thought if I don't go I felt my heart
[1:19:22] if I don't pray for my grandpa he might
[1:19:24] not make it and it was right before I
[1:19:27] was gonna go somewhere or do something I
[1:19:28] don't know if I was going to South
[1:19:29] America before that I know
[1:19:30] remember I had something to do and I
[1:19:33] just listen to brother branham like this
[1:19:35] and I reached out my finger out of the
[1:19:36] van and I said in the name of Jesus
[1:19:39] Christ I said storm you're gonna move
[1:19:41] and you're gonna get out of my way and
[1:19:43] just a matter in a few minutes drove
[1:19:46] right through it by God's grace I got I
[1:19:48] drove three hours pray for my grandpa
[1:19:50] say 10 minutes and drove back and that's
[1:19:53] one time where I seen something like
[1:19:54] that where if you speak to it you but
[1:19:56] you got to believe it amen I didn't want
[1:19:59] him to die I don't want him to know and
[1:20:01] he come out of the hospital II thank God
[1:20:03] for it after that he gave a testimony
[1:20:04] about coming out of the hospital hey
[1:20:07] church that's all it's required God just
[1:20:10] wants somebody who believe his word and
[1:20:12] speak the word amen ten thousand demons
[1:20:16] now just a moment I don't have the
[1:20:24] quotes and I'm sorry yeah I do have the
[1:20:25] codes just a minute I want to bring this
[1:20:27] thought out a little bit about demons
[1:20:29] how demons hang around believers just as
[1:20:33] angels hang around believers demons hang
[1:20:35] around believers - this is fully
[1:20:38] scriptural I want you to read though I
[1:20:41] want to read something those to you from
[1:20:46] this is from a message 19:54 God's
[1:20:48] preparation now the prophets talking
[1:20:52] about the prayer line now what you
[1:20:54] listened if you can please pay attention
[1:20:55] here like I said I'm gonna try to close
[1:20:56] soon by God's grace brother Ram said
[1:20:59] he's talked about the prayer line you
[1:21:00] don't realize every one of you as a
[1:21:02] spirit there's a body declaring you but
[1:21:05] everyone's a spirit and a lot of you
[1:21:07] sitting here looking around you're
[1:21:08] lovely people I love you and God knows
[1:21:10] that see but faith is in this first
[1:21:14] person here this first conscience but
[1:21:16] when you look up way down in your heart
[1:21:18] the least little fear will come in there
[1:21:21] and say well I wonder how this could
[1:21:24] happen so he's talking about how a
[1:21:26] little fear will come into our minds and
[1:21:28] we'll say well I just don't think I
[1:21:30] could overcome that that's fear
[1:21:33] I just don't think God could deliver I
[1:21:35] just don't think today's a day that's
[1:21:37] fear but RAM said
[1:21:39] no fear will come into people's hearts
[1:21:41] and he said and just like that he said
[1:21:44] it cuts me down right here that I can
[1:21:47] feel it
[1:21:48] so but RAM would feel those evil spirits
[1:21:50] anointing people and they would say well
[1:21:52] it's just not for me right now he can
[1:21:55] feel it and then he says it just comes
[1:21:57] in like oh like a win he does a blowing
[1:21:59] sound he can listen to it so better I
[1:22:03] was looking at the people who might
[1:22:04] believe out there in the audience
[1:22:05] and he sees somebody trying to believe
[1:22:07] but then a little fear comes over them
[1:22:09] and then when that fear comes over he
[1:22:11] said an evil spirit will blow and go and
[1:22:15] brother answered I said I'll look over
[1:22:16] at him and I'll think well god bless the
[1:22:19] man's heart I know he don't mean that
[1:22:20] I'll look to somebody else and he goes
[1:22:25] through all this description he's trying
[1:22:27] to find people out there that believe
[1:22:28] but when they when they lose that battle
[1:22:30] that between faith and unbelief a spirit
[1:22:34] will come in and start blowing in the
[1:22:35] church and we know from the other quotes
[1:22:36] that spirits like to get help from other
[1:22:38] spirits right because they go get seven
[1:22:41] other spirits so what I'm saying is
[1:22:43] their spiritual battle going on right
[1:22:44] now and we can't see with their eyes but
[1:22:47] we can feel it with faith now in other
[1:22:51] words how do you feel how could you feel
[1:22:52] your seat well you're like you're in the
[1:22:54] valley decision you're saying you're
[1:22:55] trying to get the bat you're trying to
[1:22:56] get the victory that's how you know
[1:22:58] there's a spiritual battle going on are
[1:23:01] you gonna believe God's Word am I gonna
[1:23:03] believe God's Word or not and that's and
[1:23:05] this is happening brother Branham says
[1:23:07] this happens just the least little fear
[1:23:09] will cause somebody to just take on an
[1:23:11] evil spirit that spirit will start
[1:23:13] blowing everybody say well bless his
[1:23:14] heart I've got to go to somebody else in
[1:23:16] the audience you can read this if you
[1:23:19] want I think oh and I looked over I
[1:23:22] think well bless this man's heart and
[1:23:24] somebody back here say well I wonder how
[1:23:27] er then he says I need to hear another
[1:23:31] he said hear now it's on this side and
[1:23:34] then back here you think oh they don't
[1:23:36] mean it bless their heart he says then a
[1:23:39] visions breaking here and somebody
[1:23:41] sitting here once 100% faith amen
[1:23:45] so he's seeing all this unbelief but he
[1:23:47] finally finds somebody who wants a
[1:23:49] hundred percent faith amen
[1:23:51] how many 100% faith this morning
[1:23:53] absolutely they're moving in and you're
[1:23:56] seeing something here that's moving
[1:23:57] here's something now that's the reason I
[1:23:59] try to get to the person first right out
[1:24:02] to me or something where there be no
[1:24:04] spirit around it so by the way I was
[1:24:07] trying to find somebody who doesn't have
[1:24:09] an evil spirit on them oh my the church
[1:24:11] we're all trying to have the right
[1:24:12] spirit on us amen we want to come in
[1:24:15] here with the right spirit on us even if
[1:24:18] you're battle you should still come but
[1:24:19] you should seek God and say God help me
[1:24:21] to get the victory
[1:24:22] so can I can have the right spirit upon
[1:24:24] me he said the least little fear is a
[1:24:30] demon spirit moving in the audience well
[1:24:32] I wonder if it could happen today I
[1:24:34] don't know if it'll happen today now you
[1:24:36] know your Giants how many know your
[1:24:37] Giants let me know your battles you've
[1:24:40] got your battles I've got my battles but
[1:24:43] our attitude toward our faith or doubt
[1:24:45] in it will cause the actual effect of it
[1:24:48] that's right I remember that scripture
[1:24:53] because if if a man kicks out evil
[1:24:55] spirit and now he's got the victory if
[1:24:56] he's not careful if he doesn't keep
[1:24:58] building up his faith and get stronger
[1:25:00] in faith then that unbelief will creep
[1:25:02] right back in Satan loves that keep to
[1:25:05] leave Saint loves to get back into where
[1:25:07] he was I'll say like that guys forgive
[1:25:09] me he loves to get back where he once
[1:25:12] was he wants his land back see we both
[1:25:14] are trying to possess land we're trying
[1:25:16] to possess land for God's glory Satan's
[1:25:18] trying to possess it for his glory but
[1:25:20] we know God will get the glory in this
[1:25:21] church amen
[1:25:22] it's exactly right amen now look at this
[1:25:25] here let me just bring this to your mind
[1:25:27] here I made this yesterday it's really
[1:25:29] simple
[1:25:30] you and I are either gonna live in faith
[1:25:32] or unbelief you and I we're either
[1:25:35] living faith or unbelief and love faith
[1:25:38] works by love so we got to have our love
[1:25:40] and everything cleaned out here by love
[1:25:41] clean out all of our minds then this
[1:25:43] love will move our faith to pray for
[1:25:45] somebody or pray for ourselves or pray
[1:25:47] for God's will to be done but
[1:25:49] everything's got to be cleaned out and
[1:25:51] the church said but see where we battle
[1:25:54] and where brother haven't said this he
[1:25:55] said oh poor little fella you know that
[1:25:57] that's dealing with fear and the least
[1:25:59] little fear now look let's start down
[1:26:01] here
[1:26:02] fear accompanies doubt and of course
[1:26:04] that was unbelief so we into that a
[1:26:06] little bit but fear brother
[1:26:07] the greatest thing against the church
[1:26:09] today is fear that God won't keep his
[1:26:11] commands how many can say amen to that
[1:26:12] I think you've all felt it I felt it I'm
[1:26:14] a little scared to prayer a little
[1:26:15] scared to speak God's Word to the
[1:26:17] situation the biggest hindrance to the
[1:26:20] church this church any church is fear
[1:26:22] that God won't keep his word and perfect
[1:26:25] love has to cast that out
[1:26:27] Amen you leave that perfect love has to
[1:26:32] drive the fear out so nobody in here
[1:26:33] fears that God's not gonna do it we have
[1:26:36] to believe God's gonna do it oh yes now
[1:26:39] look at this this is why I said earlier
[1:26:41] brother this electro quote the worst
[1:26:42] feeling anyone could have is distress or
[1:26:45] nervousness which distress leads to like
[1:26:47] depression oppression I'm just I'm
[1:26:50] hopeless right hopelessness
[1:26:51] I feel awful for people that you know
[1:26:54] talk about suicide it's an awful thing
[1:26:55] to be in but they don't have to remain
[1:26:58] there
[1:26:58] remember in 1st Thessalonians 4 the
[1:27:00] Bible says we are not of those when
[1:27:03] people die and church members believers
[1:27:05] die we are not of those who have no hope
[1:27:07] we have a hope we'll see them again at
[1:27:10] the first resurrection hey man we've got
[1:27:12] hope but those without hope sinners or
[1:27:16] people that church members that just
[1:27:18] have religious demons on them that
[1:27:19] really aren't saved they really have no
[1:27:22] hope and so they they remain in this
[1:27:24] distressful nervousness kind of
[1:27:26] condition and brother brother that's
[1:27:29] that's the worst feeling to have so the
[1:27:31] worst thing we're gonna battle as a
[1:27:33] group is fear the worst feeling any
[1:27:35] individual can have is hopelessness
[1:27:38] nervousness distress that's the worst
[1:27:42] feeling next program said the worst
[1:27:45] demon to deal with is the religious
[1:27:47] demon because they're the one that
[1:27:50] thinks they know everything they're the
[1:27:51] one that thinks they got it all right
[1:27:52] and then they crucify and condemn and
[1:27:54] kill the one who's got it right that's
[1:27:58] the worst one to deal with right that's
[1:28:01] why Jesus said we shouldn't worry about
[1:28:02] proselyting
[1:28:03] you shouldn't be a proselyte er you
[1:28:05] shouldn't say well I want all the
[1:28:06] Baptist's to be come to our church I
[1:28:09] want all the Methodists to come to our
[1:28:11] church all the Pentecostals need to come
[1:28:13] to our church by the Amen know all of
[1:28:15] God's children need to come to our
[1:28:17] church do you want everybody be saved
[1:28:19] yes we want everyone to be filled the
[1:28:20] Holy Ghost yes
[1:28:21] but our battle is not against a
[1:28:24] denomination and trying to proselyte and
[1:28:26] bring them to us our battles against the
[1:28:28] devil praise God and we can get victory
[1:28:30] by the spoken word of God how many
[1:28:33] believe we're in the age of the spoken
[1:28:34] word hey man this is the age of the
[1:28:37] spoken word praise God because the
[1:28:38] spoken word is the original seed we're
[1:28:41] going back to the original faith of the
[1:28:42] Apostolic fathers amen that's exactly
[1:28:46] right and then brother Simon read this
[1:28:49] quote and I had I have it on my notes
[1:28:50] the chief of all demons is unbelief the
[1:28:57] chief of all demons is unbelief and
[1:29:00] that's because the demon of unbelief if
[1:29:03] it's in a person's heart they are not
[1:29:06] saved they're lost let's read that go to
[1:29:08] Hebrews chapter 3 in your Bible Hebrews
[1:29:18] 3:8 we'll go here is 3:8 the chief of
[1:29:23] all demons is a demon of unbelief and
[1:29:25] this is what ultimately anoints a person
[1:29:28] where they don't get saved they don't
[1:29:30] believe the Word of God I want you to
[1:29:35] see some of these demons remember Bram
[1:29:36] even said now the demons have different
[1:29:38] shapes to write you said ones like a
[1:29:41] tortoise ones like a bat though they
[1:29:43] have different shapes that they're in
[1:29:44] some have hairs hanging down the bat has
[1:29:46] hairs hanging down from his wings it's
[1:29:47] awful it's an awful thing but I want to
[1:29:50] just show you some of these that you'll
[1:29:51] be aware of this and remember that we
[1:29:54] are called to dry them out remember in
[1:29:56] one place in one place I didn't get the
[1:29:58] preaches but in one place God said I'm
[1:30:00] gonna drive him out and another place
[1:30:02] God said you're gonna drive him out what
[1:30:04] is it it's us working together with God
[1:30:06] it's us working with God God in us is
[1:30:09] gonna drive it out hey man we've got to
[1:30:12] yield to him Hebrews 3:8 he's talking
[1:30:15] about Israel how they didn't take the
[1:30:16] Promised Land harden not your hearts as
[1:30:19] in the provocation and the day of
[1:30:20] temptation the wilderness when your
[1:30:22] father's tempted me proved me and saw my
[1:30:24] works 40 years wherefore I was grieved
[1:30:26] with that generation and said they
[1:30:28] always do err in their hearts and they
[1:30:29] have not known my ways so I swear my
[1:30:32] wrath they shall not enter into my rest
[1:30:35] now this is Rath this is not I swear in
[1:30:37] my mercy I swear in my wrath let me know
[1:30:40] all those that died in the world or
[1:30:42] something no they were lost they were
[1:30:44] not saved they were lost because in my
[1:30:47] wrath they will not enter the promised
[1:30:50] I just showed him all these miracles I
[1:30:51] in the wilderness and in Egypt and they
[1:30:54] can't believe me just to drive out seven
[1:30:55] seven nations greater than them he said
[1:30:58] then you'll perish in the wilderness no
[1:31:02] that's the reality Church
[1:31:03] look at verse 12 take heed brethren lest
[1:31:06] there be in any of you an evil heart of
[1:31:09] unbelief in departing from the Living
[1:31:11] God
[1:31:14] look at verse 3 verse 13 but exhort one
[1:31:18] another daily so see how much you see
[1:31:20] how much we got to be together we should
[1:31:21] try to text each other all the time how
[1:31:23] many can say amen to that
[1:31:24] we should try to call each other more
[1:31:25] we're to exhort or strengthen one
[1:31:27] another daily while it's called today
[1:31:30] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:31:33] deceitfulness of sin so brother man when
[1:31:35] brother home says the chief of all
[1:31:37] demons is unbelief don't scratch your
[1:31:38] head look in the word because it is the
[1:31:43] chief demon is unbelief because remember
[1:31:45] your soul either has phase or unbelief
[1:31:47] anointing it right if you've got faith
[1:31:50] you're saying praise God you got
[1:31:52] unbelief you're lost and say God help
[1:31:55] you say God help my number leave because
[1:31:57] you don't have any face at that point
[1:31:58] but God give me faith let faith come as
[1:32:01] a streak from heaven that I might take
[1:32:03] the possession today as there's time
[1:32:05] today today is a day of salvation amen I
[1:32:09] go to Jude chapter one church what did
[1:32:11] you chapter one I'm sure the same thing
[1:32:13] these were all lost because they drew
[1:32:17] back they drew back they started out
[1:32:19] with Jesus but then they drew back and
[1:32:22] that's what I try to constantly urge the
[1:32:24] church don't draw back from your
[1:32:26] dedication to God give more dedication
[1:32:28] to God give more time to God because if
[1:32:32] not Satan can tempt us to keep drawing
[1:32:34] drawing back and then if that keeps
[1:32:35] continuing within what then what happens
[1:32:38] to the individual they can have some
[1:32:39] serious soul battles am I saved or not
[1:32:42] am I you know they backs it in so far
[1:32:48] now Jude chapter 1 look at verse 5 I
[1:32:53] will therefore put you in remembrance
[1:32:55] though you once knew this how that the
[1:32:58] Lord having saved the people on land of
[1:32:59] Egypt afterward destroyed them that
[1:33:02] believe not the God who brought them out
[1:33:06] destroyed them because they didn't go on
[1:33:08] with God and that proved they never
[1:33:11] believed in the first place
[1:33:13] right but everybody that believed kept
[1:33:15] going on right Moses Miriam air and they
[1:33:18] went on they died in the weirdness but
[1:33:19] they were saved we know that the Bible
[1:33:21] says that Moses would say we know that
[1:33:23] but then Caleb and Joshua they were the
[1:33:25] two that believed it and they took the
[1:33:27] promised land and brother Ram typed his
[1:33:29] ministry as Joshua and typed us as Caleb
[1:33:32] were the ones that faithfully followed
[1:33:34] Joshua hey man it's exactly right now go
[1:33:38] to Hebrews 10 I think I read this one a
[1:33:41] few weeks ago Hebrews 10:38 yeah you
[1:33:52] know what let's go up and go to verse 35
[1:33:54] Hebrews 10:35 we're here I'm trying to
[1:33:56] finish up cast not away therefore your
[1:34:00] confidence which has great recompense of
[1:34:03] reward see we're not supposed to cast
[1:34:04] down confidence we're supposed to cast
[1:34:06] down doubt and fears we're supposed to
[1:34:08] cast down religious spirits nervousness
[1:34:10] fear we're supposed to cast that down
[1:34:12] but we know so many people course that
[1:34:14] have cast down confidence in God's Word
[1:34:16] well I don't even believe it you know
[1:34:17] man wrote that book and how can we even
[1:34:19] have trust in it how can we don't cast
[1:34:21] down your confidence keep your
[1:34:22] confidence in God's Word for you have
[1:34:25] need of patience that after you've done
[1:34:26] the will of God you might receive the
[1:34:28] promise forget a little while and he
[1:34:30] that shall come will come and will not
[1:34:32] tarry now the just shall live by faith
[1:34:34] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[1:34:36] have no pleasure in him but we are not
[1:34:39] of them who draw back unto perdition but
[1:34:41] of them that believe to the saving of
[1:34:43] the soul see we don't draw back like
[1:34:47] Israel we could never do this we cannot
[1:34:48] take the promise of God I can't possess

[1:46:28] Gracie let's read our text here 1st
[1:46:30] Corinthians 11:23 for I've received to
[1:46:32] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:46:34] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:46:36] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:46:38] bread and when he given thanks he brake
[1:46:40] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:46:43] which is broken for you this do in
[1:46:46] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:46:48] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:46:50] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:46:53] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[1:46:56] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:46:59] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:47:00] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:47:03] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:47:06] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:47:08] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:47:10] and blood of the Lord well that a man
[1:47:14] examine himself so that and so let him
[1:47:16] eat of that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:47:18] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:47:20] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:47:22] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:47:24] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:47:27] sickly among you and many sleep or if we
[1:47:30] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:47:32] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:47:34] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:47:36] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:47:39] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:47:40] tarry one for another
[1:47:44] let's outward prayer Heavenly Father
