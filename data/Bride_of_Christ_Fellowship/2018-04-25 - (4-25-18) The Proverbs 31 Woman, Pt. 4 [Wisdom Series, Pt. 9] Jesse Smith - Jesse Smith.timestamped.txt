[38:36] not the bread of idleness
[38:39] let's stop right there let's have a word
[38:41] of Prayer if you have anything on your
[38:42] heart just make it known unto God as we
[38:44] go before our gracious Heavenly Father
[38:47] dear Lord in heaven we come before the
[38:49] throne of grace Lord and we're meeting
[38:51] here at the appointed time Heavenly

[39:37] opportunity Lord as your prophet said
[39:39] before the government closes the doors
[39:41] Lord we know that will happen father at
[39:44] some point Lord for the mark of the
[39:46] beast will be laid down so lord help us
[39:48] to take advantage and remember that
[39:50] these times are blessing times Lord

[39:56] Lord we thank you for the gathering of
[39:58] the saints bless each and every heart
[40:00] may they be fed the Word of God tonight
[40:02] in Jesus Christ's name everybody said
[40:04] amen god bless she's been and seen the
[40:07] praise the Lord so we'd like to look at
[40:12] this is part 4 on the proverbs 31 woman
[40:15] and we'll look at this apart 9 of the
[40:16] series tonight by the grace of the Lord
[40:20] I want to begin with the court I
[40:22] mentioned on Sunday so they asked the
[40:24] prophet of God this sorry in 1964 they
[40:28] said brother Branham are women allowed
[40:30] to work in public affairs when they have
[40:31] a healthy husband and children I'm
[40:33] asking this question for someone else
[40:35] buh-bam he says well I I I don't know
[40:38] about that I can't say but I I just have
[40:41] this feeling let me say this I believe
[40:43] if I was a woman and I know that my
[40:45] husband was healthy and had a good job
[40:46] working I believe would be a great
[40:48] pleasure to me to stay home take care of
[40:51] my children and make the and take care
[40:54] of my children and raise them up to love
[40:55] the Lord if I had any time from washing
[40:58] and things that I was going to do I
[41:00] think I would teach my children how to
[41:01] serve the Lord
[41:02] he said now here's where he balances it
[41:05] out you know cuz so often we feel like
[41:07] well so often we hear sometimes
[41:09] preaching and people are so hard on any
[41:12] woman that would leave the home you know
[41:13] or or do anything outside of the home
[41:16] but we've got to balance it out by the
[41:18] grace of the Lord just like this week I
[41:19] got an email from overseas and the
[41:21] brothers like do you condemn all
[41:23] smartphones and all tablets and all
[41:25] these things because of what brother
[41:26] Graham said about TVs and and so I just
[41:28] tried to bring the balance brother
[41:29] branham said if you make the TV evil
[41:31] then you make the newspaper evil
[41:32] anything that has any evil in it would
[41:35] then be something you can't touch right
[41:38] he said but it all depends what you do
[41:40] with it and the brother wrote me back
[41:42] and said oh praise the Lord thank you
[41:43] for your answer you know I just try to
[41:45] show the balance and show if you have
[41:47] godly character you'll always turn away
[41:49] from sin whether it's on your phone or
[41:52] tablet or TV if you really have Christ
[41:54] in you you'll hate sin and you'll turn
[41:56] away and that's why a smartphone isn't a
[41:59] sin of itself it's what someone does
[42:01] with it and so just encouraging to see
[42:04] the balance and so just as that topic of
[42:06] TVs and Internet and cell phones and
[42:08] smartwatches just as that has balance so
[42:11] does this subject has balance as well
[42:13] the RAM says if you've got a debt or
[42:15] something like that you're trying to
[42:16] help your husband pay for or something
[42:18] that you have to do that well I think
[42:20] that's fine as you'll try to help him
[42:22] and you live a lady and I think it's
[42:25] hard no man that's got good
[42:27] understanding once if his wife to get in
[42:29] a bunch where there's a bunch of vulgar
[42:31] dirty men and things like that so as I
[42:34] said on Sunday the prophet of God is
[42:36] repeatedly mentioning the atmosphere
[42:38] that a godly woman would be around her
[42:41] character her virtue is so sacred the
[42:44] Prophet is just he's leaning hard on
[42:46] this don't let your wife get in a bad
[42:48] atmosphere and how many know that a real
[42:51] Christian doesn't want to work in that
[42:52] atmosphere anyway they would leave a job
[42:54] that had an awful atmosphere right
[42:56] because they would grieve the Holy
[42:57] Spirit inside of them and a real
[42:59] Christian can't stand to grieve the Holy
[43:01] Spirit that's right so he says but if
[43:04] the woman has to get in that so she has
[43:07] to get in that so he knows there's times
[43:09] that would I think she ought to her
[43:11] husband ought to know that she's a
[43:12] genuine Christian that can be trusted a
[43:14] trustworthy woman that's what we saw in
[43:16] proverbs 31 right her husband can safely
[43:19] put his trust in her amen so brother
[43:22] hands talking here about a proverbs 31
[43:24] woman just not saying the words proverbs
[43:26] 31 woman but now as I as to say that she
[43:30] wouldn't work I don't know see there's
[43:31] no scripture to back that up
[43:33] I'm just I'm just passing that opinion
[43:35] but I think if a woman wants to work and
[43:38] she wants to work now I'm certainly
[43:39] against women working in these offices
[43:41] where all these businessmen they carry
[43:43] on they tell the dirty jokes a nice
[43:46] clean woman sitting there and all these
[43:47] smutty dirty things around like that I'm
[43:49] against that I think you ought to come
[43:51] out from among such stuff as that but
[43:53] now if a woman can hold herself as a
[43:55] real lady and trying to help her husband
[43:58] do something to meet some clothes for
[44:00] the kids to go to school or pay off a
[44:02] bill or something like that and she
[44:04] wants to work till that's over now that
[44:06] this is not she said this is not the
[44:08] Lord because I don't have no scripture
[44:10] for this I'm just saying that be my
[44:12] opinion
[44:13] but otherwise I wouldn't think just
[44:15] because she wants to work just to run
[44:18] around or have money to spend
[44:20] and run to bar rooms and drink or smoke
[44:22] or carry on I don't think she should do
[44:25] it I think she should stay home truly or
[44:27] try to be a lady and take care of the
[44:29] house amen
[44:30] that's the end of the quote how many
[44:31] appreciate the balance of the prophet of
[44:32] God yeah he admits here he doesn't have
[44:35] any scripture where a woman could work
[44:38] outside the home but he doesn't condemn
[44:40] it either he leaves that open that's
[44:42] that's the way a real man of God would
[44:44] do that if he doesn't have a scripture
[44:45] he just says that's my opinion and the
[44:48] Holy Spirit will guide you but look the
[44:50] Holy Spirit will never guide you into a
[44:51] bunch of sin and a filthy smutty
[44:54] atmosphere won't guide you into that
[44:56] amen
[44:58] just like we know with lot member he
[45:00] first planted his tent toward Sodom and
[45:02] then we found him in Sodom the Holy
[45:05] Spirit wasn't leading him there right it
[45:07] was just his own desire he saw and it
[45:09] looked like the Garden of Eden he
[45:10] thought my this place looks like this
[45:12] doesn't really have much promise I want
[45:15] to go to some places great financially
[45:17] and in doing that he went to a city that
[45:19] tormented him day and night you see at
[45:22] Abraham he was a real believer a dollar
[45:25] bill we'd say a silver dollar he stayed
[45:28] outside all that and God protected him
[45:31] amen angels enter at the pole Abraham
[45:34] out of destruction he had wisdom to know
[45:37] you stay away from homosexuality right
[45:40] you stay away from sodomites
[45:42] he had wisdom to know you never plant
[45:44] yourself in a situation like that amen
[45:47] so we see the same thing here with our
[45:49] sisters working outside the home they've
[45:52] got to use the wisdom of the Holy Spirit
[45:54] there has to be a reason for and it has
[45:56] to be God ordained because God will
[45:58] never lead us into a sinful situation
[46:00] now let's look at these next verses here
[46:04] 21 down to actually that's 27 I meant to
[46:07] make that a 27 so pardon me so in this
[46:10] portion here now we've gone through
[46:12] these other things she does and many of
[46:14] these can be done right from her home
[46:16] that we've gone through in the earlier
[46:18] verses but now in these verses it really
[46:21] focuses in on the home so the virtuous
[46:24] woman provides for a family with
[46:26] faithful character let's look at
[46:28] proverbs 31 21 if you got your Bibles
[46:30] there we'll just make a few comments and
[46:32] remember I'm using comment
[46:34] from some writers from the the
[46:36] Philadelphian church age and remember if
[46:38] you remember when we preach on that
[46:40] series on the church ages brother
[46:41] Branham said God anointed those men like
[46:44] Matthew Henry and Albert Barnes he
[46:46] anointed them with that man wisdom of
[46:48] the Holy Spirit and he said there never
[46:50] was a greater riding age than the age of
[46:53] the philadelphia church age so it's not
[46:55] sin for me to use these commentaries as
[46:58] long as they line up with the Word of
[47:00] God amen now look at verse 21 she's not
[47:04] afraid of the snow for a household for
[47:06] all of her household are decked
[47:07] I'm sorry clothed with scarlet so see
[47:10] she does not fear the snow because her
[47:12] house is clothed
[47:13] look they're already clothes so in other
[47:16] words she's already got preparations to
[47:18] keep her children and and her entire
[47:20] household warm in the cold months and
[47:23] remember that included in this case and
[47:25] included her children but also maidens
[47:27] or we'd say serving girls young girls
[47:30] that were not married and so remember
[47:33] this was a double-layered garment I went
[47:35] over this on Sunday night so we added
[47:37] this to her list now there's a couple
[47:39] other slides of these I think there's
[47:40] five slides of these now all these godly
[47:43] attributes of a proverbs 31 woman amen
[47:46] so she produces high quality merchandise
[47:49] prepared an alert inside the home she
[47:53] works with her hands with most ancient
[47:54] of tools
[47:55] she takes initiative to help the poor in
[47:57] the needy and she prepares warm clothes
[47:59] for her children and her servants amen
[48:03] verse 22 now she maketh herself
[48:06] coverings of tapestry her clothing is
[48:10] silk and purple now if you ever study if
[48:13] you study the scripture tapestry is a
[48:16] bed covering if you study the scripture
[48:18] so what's that called honey of the
[48:19] blanket on top what's that called again
[48:21] the comforter yeah thank you aren't you
[48:24] glad for the comfort of the Holy Spirit
[48:26] but see she's worked she works with the
[48:28] comforter
[48:30] I like the spiritual types here she
[48:32] works with the cover just like she works
[48:33] with the thread right they get the token
[48:35] ready amen
[48:36] she works are these things amen so
[48:40] that's an important especially in the
[48:42] cold months that's an important blanket
[48:43] how do we know that can't sleep in your
[48:45] sheets in the wintertime
[48:47] she makes that herself because the Bible
[48:50] says this that you know now this is the
[48:52] the moral woman talked about the
[48:54] coverings of tapestry on her beds that's
[48:56] how we know that tapestry was that
[48:58] comforter or the heavy blanket there and
[49:02] notice her clothing is silk and purple
[49:05] and that's what God adore in Israel with
[49:08] after he found her in the blood her own
[49:10] blood he picked her up he washed her off
[49:12] and he decked her with bracelets and a
[49:15] beautiful garment and and put a crowd on
[49:18] her head and all these things like that
[49:19] but he clothed Israel with fine linen
[49:23] and silk the Bible says that in Ezekiel
[49:25] 16 now silk was probably imported from
[49:29] Egypt and the purple dye came from
[49:32] Phoenicia because I forget where it was
[49:34] but they had to get these little water
[49:37] creatures that were purple and you know
[49:39] kill them and then get out they're
[49:40] purple they're purple whatever blood or
[49:44] whatever it was and then they had to get
[49:45] enough of that to make the purple
[49:47] garment so these were very costly
[49:50] garments so now we know this woman is
[49:52] certainly the wife of a rich King so
[49:56] that's got to give us some context
[49:57] remember it's hard to find a woman like
[49:59] this just as it's hard to find a real
[50:02] Christian woman at all in the world how
[50:04] do we know that it's hard to find a real
[50:06] Christian woman let alone a Christian
[50:08] woman who has all this influence all
[50:10] this money all this power all this
[50:13] possibility it's very hard to find one
[50:16] of these so now it's interesting so in
[50:20] this in this next verse then we see the
[50:23] proof that this is a really a wealthy
[50:25] woman the as the wife of the king
[50:29] because she has soaked garments with now
[50:32] scarlet was costly as well red garments
[50:34] and purple garments were costly now I
[50:36] just want to stop and say this we know
[50:38] God ordains something to be rich and
[50:40] others to be poor in fact I was
[50:43] listening to a letting off the pressure
[50:44] brother Branham said God made some rich
[50:46] and God made some poor he does that he
[50:48] just places people in different
[50:50] situations so I want you to know this
[50:52] proverbs 31 is not condemning poor
[50:55] Christians or Jews but it's just showing
[50:57] how a godly woman presented herself
[51:01] the resources available to her it's not
[51:04] condemning the the rich or the poor so
[51:06] whatever God makes you just be the best
[51:09] rich Christian or the best poor
[51:11] Christian you could be and now we know
[51:13] in America we know all of us were richer
[51:15] than most of the entire world put
[51:17] together right we're have so many goods
[51:19] and there's so many riches and I got to
[51:21] work for it right but most of us live
[51:24] paycheck to paycheck unless you're
[51:25] really good at saving and you're really
[51:27] good at cutting your costs but a lot of
[51:30] us like me had to go into debt to buy a
[51:31] house so I go again we'll go into debt I
[51:33] got to get a vehicle that will make it
[51:35] to work every day so I gotta take a loan
[51:36] out there a lot of us have just lived in
[51:39] debt because that's the way it's set up
[51:40] I come from a poor family my parents
[51:43] didn't give me any money also I got is
[51:45] what God gave me so most of us live on
[51:48] debt in America we're never not really
[51:50] rich but we have access to a lot of
[51:52] things a lot of goods most of us now I
[51:59] want you to bring this quote I wonder
[52:00] well because I want to balance this now
[52:02] we're not saying you know if you're not
[52:04] rich and you if you're not dressed in
[52:05] the nicest dresses you're not a proper
[52:07] 31 woman we're not saying that we're
[52:10] just looking at how a godly Jewish woman
[52:13] would have dressed if she was the wife
[52:15] of a king because remember this type
[52:17] spiritually but look her brother Adam
[52:18] says we preach this last year around
[52:22] said the people of God are not material
[52:24] minded they are Christ minded they do
[52:28] not seek the treasures that are below
[52:30] them they stick those above it's
[52:32] absolutely true the majority of
[52:33] Christians are not wealthy
[52:35] so this proverbs 31 woman these clothes
[52:40] didn't mean a whole lot to her she was
[52:42] not her mind wasn't on all I want the
[52:44] prettiest dress it was just something
[52:47] she just dressed herself nicely because
[52:49] that's what was available to her her
[52:53] mind was not on the clothes to make
[52:55] herself beautiful it was on I want to
[52:58] provide the needs of my husband the
[52:59] children and I want to I want this house
[53:02] to run well by the grace of God it
[53:04] wasn't all my look at that online IRA I
[53:07] think I'll spend an extra two thousand
[53:09] and buy that that's skirt that's a
[53:10] really nice skirt you know that that's
[53:12] not what her motivation was
[53:14] her motivation was to fear God and do
[53:17] good to her husband all the days of her
[53:19] life so in doing that I fear God I'm
[53:23] gonna obey my do good to my husband
[53:25] today I'm the I'm the wife of a king
[53:28] they placed these garments before me
[53:30] I'll wear the nice ones that's just what
[53:32] she had she in other words she cared
[53:35] about her her presentation her
[53:37] appearance she didn't want to look messy
[53:39] she wouldn't look nice but brother have
[53:43] says that most Christians are wealthy
[53:46] rather they're on the poor side it was
[53:49] so in Jesus's day it was true in Paul's
[53:52] day and it should be true today oh it is
[53:54] not so it is not too true today for the
[53:56] lay of caen age is one of a vast wealth
[53:58] where often the criterion of
[54:00] spirituality is an abundance of earthly
[54:01] Goods my how the rich how rich the
[54:05] churches and goods but how poor in
[54:07] spirit blessed are you poor for yours of
[54:09] the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is
[54:11] not meat and drink it is not material it
[54:14] is within us a rich man is rich in God
[54:17] not in worldly things a method that
[54:20] beautiful so our main motivation is not
[54:22] to get more Goods and more Goods and
[54:25] more goods our mone may our main
[54:27] motivation is to spread the kingdom of
[54:30] God that's right
[54:32] because we always have it you know
[54:34] always have things always you know we
[54:36] have you know you just look at our
[54:37] church for example if you go to my
[54:38] office my office is a storage room from
[54:40] all of our earthly goods being a big
[54:43] Church for a bigger church for a few
[54:44] years and then down you know downsizing
[54:47] and we just have extra goods there we've
[54:49] got to work hard to keep less goods
[54:51] because you're my mother-in-law will
[54:54] bring me over three bags of clothes and
[54:55] what am I gonna do with these you know
[54:57] and I don't even have hardly room for
[54:58] these you know or somebody blesses you
[55:00] with all these extra things you've just
[55:02] got to work hard to not be material of
[55:04] mind at amen but that's Laodicea so
[55:07] we've got to constantly get our mind off
[55:09] material things and get it on spiritual
[55:12] things things above so now we now let's
[55:15] add to that list so not only does we
[55:17] read this one already here's this
[55:18] scripture she makes her own blankets and
[55:22] then she wears high quality clothing as
[55:25] wife of the king
[55:26] so she presents herself
[55:29] in a way of dignity we'd say she's very
[55:32] dignified but she's the wife of a king
[55:34] she ought to present herself that way
[55:36] because she's the role model for all the
[55:39] women of the kingdom right that's right
[55:41] that's what the scripture says about
[55:42] Vashti and we know an Esther and we know
[55:46] brother man talked about with Jacqueline
[55:48] Kennedy and how the first lady you know
[55:50] influences the rest of the women I hope
[55:53] you're not influenced by mrs. Trump the
[55:56] third mrs. Trump right because he's on
[55:59] his third marriage with her high heels I
[56:01] saw a picture of her she had the highest
[56:03] high heels on my goodness I know how she
[56:06] even walks afterwards wearing high heels
[56:09] like that and again I'm not condemning
[56:11] her attacking her but I'm just saying
[56:12] she's not our example the proverbs 31
[56:15] woman is our example amen
[56:19] so now let's look at verse 23 look
[56:23] remember she's good with her hands like
[56:24] a lot of this she does herself we saw
[56:26] that on Sunday and Sunday night all that
[56:29] she did with her own hands the spindle
[56:31] the thread the clothes and now her bed
[56:34] comforter she does all this with her own
[56:37] hands verse 23 her husband is known in
[56:41] the gates when he sitteth among the
[56:45] elders of the land now this gives us a
[56:49] good clue as to what time period of life
[56:51] this takes place in I don't think I said
[56:54] more later but I didn't get to that part
[56:55] I don't think I'll be able to preach
[56:57] that tonight now her husband is not a
[57:00] youngster her husband is an elder to see
[57:06] this so see the proverbs 31 woman was
[57:09] not focusing well if you're not 25 if
[57:11] you're 25 and you don't do all these
[57:13] things you're not a proper that's not
[57:14] what it's saying proverbs 31 looks at
[57:17] the whole entire scope of a woman's life
[57:19] and said these are all things that are
[57:21] what godly woman could do if extremely
[57:24] gifted and if given all these resources
[57:27] because she was given thee she was the
[57:30] queen she was given this money she was
[57:32] given these servants she was good this
[57:34] is all she that she was given and look
[57:36] what she accomplished what she was given
[57:37] but let's not feel bad about it let's
[57:39] look and see what Jesus gave us amen
[57:42] let's say God whatever you give me I'll
[57:44] give it back to you like the boy with
[57:46] the loaves and the bread I'll give it
[57:48] back to you and may it be blessed to
[57:50] glorify your name but see this gives us
[57:53] a clue now at the end of their lives as
[57:55] they're getting older maybe we'd say the
[57:57] empty nest stage or you know the the
[58:00] parenting stage where the children are
[58:01] all older now that her husband's an
[58:04] elder she has lived such a godly life
[58:09] that she she she she helped supports her
[58:13] husband's reputation and we'll look at
[58:15] this here in a moment her godly
[58:17] character helped vindicate her husband's
[58:20] godly character so because she lived a
[58:24] godly life it gave her husband an
[58:26] influence in the political realm praise
[58:30] God and Holman said she enabled her
[58:33] husband to sin among the elders a
[58:36] respected local authority how many have
[58:40] seen a preacher fall because his wife
[58:41] didn't live the right kind of life I've
[58:44] seen a couple so see see how close to
[58:50] see how the husband and wife or one is
[58:52] everybody see that she because she lives
[58:55] such a godly holy fearful life of
[58:59] fearful of the Lord it allowed her
[59:03] husband to be respected in public amen
[59:06] to see sisters and brothers you know
[59:09] we're just not living for ourselves we
[59:10] represent one another amen I represent
[59:14] my wife at the people that know me at
[59:15] work they have a certain reputation of
[59:18] me when they see my wife whatever they
[59:21] think of me they probably think the same
[59:22] thing of my wife right there that's how
[59:25] it is to you when you see a woman you
[59:27] see a godly woman then you see a godly
[59:29] man whatever their reputation is it
[59:31] reflects on the other because these two
[59:33] are now one that's right so this deals
[59:40] with
[59:40] reputation and the character he is known
[59:43] in the gates because she helped allow
[59:46] him to be there because if she doesn't
[59:48] stay in order then he would lose his
[59:50] influence and that scriptural as well
[59:52] here's what Clark said she's a loving
[59:55] wife she feels the she feels for the
[59:57] respectability and honor of her husband
[59:59] he's an elder among his people and he
[1:00:02] sits as a magistrate in the gate he's
[1:00:05] respected not only on account of the
[1:00:07] neatness and cleanliness of his person
[1:00:09] and dress but because he's the husband
[1:00:12] of a woman who is justly held in
[1:00:14] universal esteem everybody sees just
[1:00:17] like Ruth everybody she sees she's a
[1:00:19] virtuous woman and her complete
[1:00:22] management of household affairs gives
[1:00:25] him leisure for leisure to devote
[1:00:27] himself to the civil interest of the
[1:00:29] community so that's that's that's why
[1:00:33] the woman's role is so critical like my
[1:00:35] brother Graham calls her the backbone
[1:00:37] right she gives that man stability he
[1:00:40] can go out and do things publicly or he
[1:00:42] can do things in the church or
[1:00:44] politically or wherever he can have an
[1:00:47] influence he can have a bigger influence
[1:00:49] because of the stability of his wife and
[1:00:52] now this should remind you godly men
[1:00:54] were elders at the at the city gates
[1:00:56] remember Boaz in fact the Bible said
[1:00:59] Boaz just went to the gate and sat down
[1:01:01] and pretty soon the rest of the elders
[1:01:03] came see he knew these wise men of
[1:01:07] judgment he knew these judges were going
[1:01:09] to come by because that's where judgment
[1:01:11] took place was at the gates
[1:01:12] he knew wise men will come here to the
[1:01:15] gates and no doubt Boaz was one of them
[1:01:17] remember when Ruth couldn't be redeemed
[1:01:20] by her nearest of kin you know he takes
[1:01:22] off his shoe and he says I'll redeem
[1:01:24] Ruth right and he said let this be a
[1:01:26] witness and all these elders be a
[1:01:29] witness that I've redeemed Naomi and
[1:01:33] Ruth is that right and he was a godly
[1:01:36] man and he could do that because of his
[1:01:38] godliness and there he's taken a godly
[1:01:41] wife a virtuous wife amen
[1:01:43] now remember a lot was a righteous man
[1:01:45] we said he was like a foolish virgin no
[1:01:47] because he chose to put his family in an
[1:01:49] awful spiritual situation but yet he was
[1:01:52] righteous so he was a righteous man
[1:01:54] a good man a save man who made an awful
[1:01:56] decision right but where did he sit when
[1:02:00] the angels came where'd he sit in the
[1:02:02] gate of the city so see his wife must
[1:02:06] have been doing something right although
[1:02:07] we believe she was lost because Jesus
[1:02:09] user has a bad example she turned and
[1:02:11] wanted to look back and and then and
[1:02:14] just miss Sodom but even she must have
[1:02:17] did some good because her character or
[1:02:19] whatever however she lived allowed him
[1:02:21] to sit in the gates and that's a Genesis
[1:02:24] 19 1 & 2 and second Peter 2 8 and I
[1:02:27] feared it's okay now this is also very
[1:02:30] similar in the New Testament because a
[1:02:32] church elder or a bishop or in this case
[1:02:34] a pastor like myself or any pastor you
[1:02:36] know must also have a godly wife the
[1:02:39] Bible says and so much the Deacons wife
[1:02:42] be godly as well so this scripture
[1:02:46] speaks to the point of how if the man's
[1:02:48] holy his wife must be holy right and if
[1:02:52] the woman is only the man must be holy
[1:02:54] if people are going to serve other
[1:02:56] people
[1:02:56] they must be examples to the rest of the
[1:02:58] people the leaders must not be
[1:03:01] hypocrites they must live the life amen
[1:03:03] and if they can live the life at home
[1:03:06] then God will trust them with public
[1:03:08] offices and public responsibilities amen
[1:03:11] and that's what she had because of her
[1:03:17] godly life her husband was known at the
[1:03:19] gate oh you're so your brother so-and-so
[1:03:22] all yeah I've heard great things about
[1:03:24] your wife yes she bought that field out
[1:03:26] there planning a vineyard and my wife
[1:03:29] was tell me she on the radio that a
[1:03:31] vineyard took at least 20 years to
[1:03:32] become fruitful so she had a 20-year
[1:03:35] vision which makes sense I mean if you
[1:03:36] plant the vines they got to grow up and
[1:03:39] you got to stake him up and then the
[1:03:40] grapes got to grow this is a long
[1:03:42] process so she was a visionary she's
[1:03:45] thinking my years down the line if I can
[1:03:48] get this ground cleared and get these
[1:03:50] vines planted mom we're gonna be blessed
[1:03:52] in about 20 years so she must add some
[1:03:54] income right there but was also planning
[1:03:56] for future income as well all right what
[1:03:59] a I don't think I could do that that's a
[1:04:02] wise business mind I've always admired
[1:04:04] all my friends who are like a business
[1:04:06] owners
[1:04:07] like my goodness how do you do that I'd
[1:04:09] be so I'd be a nervous wreck am I gonna
[1:04:11] get a job tomorrow you know and I just
[1:04:13] talked to my friend on Tuesday you know
[1:04:14] Jacob ah bond he said well my workout
[1:04:16] cancelled for dad well he said I wonder
[1:04:17] what the Lord's gonna lead me to I
[1:04:19] thought one of what a man of faith he's
[1:04:23] just used to it he he works for himself
[1:04:25] he's in construction when something
[1:04:26] falls out he just knows God's got
[1:04:28] something else for me I like that but
[1:04:31] see me a mile and sell my own
[1:04:32] personality I just like to rely upon the
[1:04:34] everyday job I know I just I'll go to
[1:04:37] workout I'll give my time I'll trade my
[1:04:39] time for that paycheck but that's you
[1:04:42] know it's just interesting when you look
[1:04:44] at that that he they must live the godly
[1:04:49] life and when they live that God life
[1:04:50] then people know these people are good
[1:04:53] judges because they judge their lives in
[1:04:55] their home and so the godly men she he
[1:04:59] or her husband has known the gates
[1:05:01] because partly because of her character
[1:05:03] now no doubt his character - we're not
[1:05:05] gonna put it all on the woman because no
[1:05:08] one wants a rascal man if even no matter
[1:05:10] how good his wife is nobody wants a
[1:05:12] rascal man as a leader or a judge
[1:05:14] because he's a rascal now so now let's
[1:05:17] add this now in her long list of works
[1:05:19] now she's got a public reputation and
[1:05:23] household management that supports her
[1:05:26] husband's reputation because she lives
[1:05:29] such a godly life right this is the kind
[1:05:34] of woman that this is the very
[1:05:36] embodiment of wisdom Ember this is
[1:05:39] wisdom made flesh this is how she lives
[1:05:42] verse 24 let's go there now look she's
[1:05:45] back to making things with her hands
[1:05:47] she's back to producing things if if
[1:05:50] comforters weren't enough if clothes
[1:05:52] weren't enough if thread wasn't enough
[1:05:55] now she's making something else
[1:05:57] verse 24 she maketh fine linen and sells
[1:06:01] it not only does she have a vineyard on
[1:06:03] the side of the home over here where
[1:06:06] she's selling grapes and selling grapes
[1:06:08] and fruits and all these not only doing
[1:06:10] that now she's got another business here
[1:06:11] she's working with brothers don't I
[1:06:15] heard the preachers say this on the
[1:06:16] under the YouTube sermon he said now
[1:06:19] brothers don't go home and tell your
[1:06:20] wife you need to have three
[1:06:21] businesses on the side or else you're no
[1:06:23] good right cuz I don't even think I
[1:06:27] could handle that many businesses I know
[1:06:28] I couldn't but look how god now she's I
[1:06:31] remember your sister she's got all these
[1:06:33] resources she's got the husband's bank
[1:06:35] you know he's the king he's got a pretty
[1:06:37] big bank account right he's the king and
[1:06:40] Salman was getting all those taxes
[1:06:42] remember all the taxes he pulled in and
[1:06:43] they warned him there he's gonna tax you
[1:06:46] he's going to take your firstborn he's
[1:06:48] gonna take your horses he's gonna take
[1:06:49] and they're like that's fine we want a
[1:06:51] king you know and that's where they
[1:06:52] warned him with Saul you know but then
[1:06:54] Solomon even increased it upon top of
[1:06:55] that on top of Saul's taxes and so here
[1:07:01] we see one more thing about her she has
[1:07:04] a business on the side not only does she
[1:07:06] make clothes and comforters now she
[1:07:10] makes other clothes and sells it and
[1:07:12] also the girdles are the belt so she
[1:07:15] made clothes and belts honey like this
[1:07:19] woman so far she's a pretty good woman
[1:07:21] and she she's much much more smarter
[1:07:25] than me I'll tell you that so she sells
[1:07:28] clothing that she makes so out of she
[1:07:32] has to be in a certain time of her life
[1:07:33] because you can't renew a baby and have
[1:07:36] both hands on the spindle or however
[1:07:38] they do it you know they they gotta Pat
[1:07:39] the foot and they gotta get the thread
[1:07:41] in and I forget how to use the spindle
[1:07:43] it's in the story Rapunzel you know but
[1:07:46] you got to have two hands you can't have
[1:07:48] one nurse and a baby over here just one
[1:07:49] and what you can't gotta have both hands
[1:07:51] on that so see you got to take these
[1:07:53] into context what time period of her
[1:07:55] life would she do this in and so Clark
[1:08:01] said
[1:08:01] makes linen which can be used in both
[1:08:03] inner and outer garments and even
[1:08:05] girdles which are put on last as a belt
[1:08:08] or sash so they walk around the town and
[1:08:11] they see oh that's that belt that sister
[1:08:13] so-and-so made that's pretty nice where
[1:08:17] did you get that oh yeah the sister down
[1:08:19] there the King's wife made that yeah
[1:08:21] she's not up there you know sleeping all
[1:08:24] day or you know pampering herself all
[1:08:26] day she's up there working hard she's
[1:08:28] trying to bring honor to her husband she
[1:08:31] doesn't want to be a burden for the
[1:08:32] husband she wants to be a blessing for a
[1:08:34] husband she wants to do good to King
[1:08:36] Solomon all the days of her life what a
[1:08:41] testimony and not only that church but
[1:08:43] the Bible said that she delivered them
[1:08:46] herself to the merchant so she would bag
[1:08:49] him up can we say box him up maybe I
[1:08:51] don't know they had boxes in those days
[1:08:52] maybe wood boxes but not only did she
[1:08:55] make sure all these clothing and skirts
[1:08:58] that were in line in these robes not
[1:09:00] only that but she boxed them up and then
[1:09:02] she delivered them herself don't you
[1:09:05] think if you were a king or queen you'd
[1:09:07] want to have like a errand boy or
[1:09:08] something like that but not this woman
[1:09:12] this woman found time to even deliver
[1:09:16] her goods so again there can't be little
[1:09:19] children running around that she's got
[1:09:20] to take care of
[1:09:20] she's has to have little more free time
[1:09:22] right because if she neglects her
[1:09:25] children then she's guilty of neglecting
[1:09:26] her home she's left her first her first
[1:09:30] mission her first duty is to her family
[1:09:33] her children so now at this stage of her
[1:09:37] life she makes her own goods and sells
[1:09:40] them on Amazon or Ebay
[1:09:44] or whatever you use Craigslist whatever
[1:09:47] that's dangerous but look look at her
[1:09:52] life this is her testimony and at the
[1:09:55] end and at the end church everybody's
[1:09:57] gonna praise this woman she's not gonna
[1:10:00] brag on herself but everybody in her
[1:10:02] home is gonna bless her now why is she
[1:10:06] doing all this is she doing this for
[1:10:07] money not necessarily for money she's
[1:10:09] doing it to make sure her house is taken
[1:10:11] care of and to do good to her husband
[1:10:13] and to fear the Lord
[1:10:15] you can make a belt and fear the Lord
[1:10:16] yes you can according to the Bible right
[1:10:20] sisters you can have a little a business
[1:10:23] on the side and you can still serve the
[1:10:24] Lord and still fear God and God knows
[1:10:29] you're not in it to be a millionaire God
[1:10:31] knows you just want to be a blessing to
[1:10:33] your family praise God now did the Holy
[1:10:38] Spirit write this chapter or not church
[1:10:40] the Holy Spirit wrote this chapter so
[1:10:44] she must have worked from the homes
[1:10:45] maybe she had little home office and she
[1:10:48] made these fine linen robes she made
[1:10:51] these nice Jewish belts and then went
[1:10:55] and sold him she delivered them herself
[1:10:57] to the merchants quiet quite a quite a
[1:11:02] story in quite a part of you so now this
[1:11:05] after she has this reputation she is
[1:11:07] such a godly life she produces high
[1:11:09] quality clothing and delivers it in
[1:11:11] sells its herself kind of it kind of
[1:11:15] changing our thoughts our minds on what
[1:11:17] a godly woman is doesn't it it's really
[1:11:19] changed my mind a lot and don't get me
[1:11:22] wrong there's nothing wrong with just
[1:11:23] wanting to cook or clean or make your
[1:11:25] house spotless and there's nothing wrong
[1:11:27] with all those those are good things
[1:11:28] wash your clothes
[1:11:29] that's wonderful things but there comes
[1:11:32] a certain stage of your life where you
[1:11:33] have a little more time to do other
[1:11:35] things and so this shows us that a woman
[1:11:38] if gift in these areas can be used by
[1:11:41] the Holy Spirit to be a blessing to her
[1:11:43] family that's right yes sir
[1:11:46] proverbs 31 25 now it really gets down
[1:11:52] to her spiritual character here
[1:11:55] strength and honor are her clothing and
[1:11:58] she shall rejoice in time to come so
[1:12:02] this woman here her true clothing is
[1:12:05] spiritual now we saw earlier right we
[1:12:07] saw how she had the finest scarlet
[1:12:09] purple she had she had access to the
[1:12:11] nicest clothes she had the nicest brand
[1:12:14] names I don't even know what they are I
[1:12:15] think for men it's chaps I think about I
[1:12:18] think that's the best shirts I have I
[1:12:20] think somebody bought him for me I
[1:12:21] didn't buy myself but she had access to
[1:12:24] the nicest clothes but when it all comes
[1:12:27] down to it God shows us that that's
[1:12:30] really not what she's anointed that's
[1:12:32] not really what she looks like she looks
[1:12:34] like an anointed daughter of God because
[1:12:38] she's anointed with strength strength of
[1:12:40] what the Holy Ghost and she has the
[1:12:44] anointing of Honor on her this is what
[1:12:48] she's really clothed in know people they
[1:12:50] just see oh she's a queen and she has
[1:12:52] all this money beautiful belts look at
[1:12:55] those belts look at those beautiful
[1:12:56] dress that's what they see but the Holy
[1:12:58] Spirit gives us the picture that really
[1:13:00] deep down inside of her she's strong in
[1:13:03] the Lord amen and she's strong in the
[1:13:06] power of his might hallelujah
[1:13:09] she strengthened by Jehovah amen and she
[1:13:13] has honor because she honors God because
[1:13:16] the Bible said in you know first samuel
[1:13:17] those who honor God God will honor them
[1:13:20] so she she honored God she must have got
[1:13:22] up and and and love the Lord and prayed
[1:13:25] and read her Bible and she must have
[1:13:27] took care of all the needs memory
[1:13:28] earlier she gave she gave portions to
[1:13:30] her maidens portions to her children she
[1:13:33] made sure everybody had what they need
[1:13:34] for their jobs of the day and then she
[1:13:36] had time for some other activity some
[1:13:38] side businesses on the side oh this
[1:13:41] woman but for us it's the it's the the
[1:13:44] clothing we need is that is the baptism
[1:13:47] of the Holy Ghost because jesus said
[1:13:48] you'll be endued or clothed with power
[1:13:50] from on high so she had this Old
[1:13:53] Testament anointing which was the Holy
[1:13:54] Ghost just not on her soul she had that
[1:13:57] anointing she was a real believer and
[1:13:59] because of that she was really clothed
[1:14:01] with the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:04] now look her rejoicing will take place
[1:14:07] in the future after seeing the fruits of
[1:14:10] all of her Labor's so she didn't she
[1:14:12] didn't take a day off and say mine look
[1:14:14] how great I am you know put her feet up
[1:14:16] on the coffee table and say oh I've done
[1:14:18] such a great job she didn't get involved
[1:14:21] with pride
[1:14:22] see because she's not rejoicing now
[1:14:24] she's not looking at all look what I've
[1:14:26] done look she would always had a goal
[1:14:28] she always had more to do because God
[1:14:31] was giving her more time on the earth
[1:14:32] and she must make best use of this time
[1:14:35] and she knew and I'm
[1:14:37] older and I can't do the spindle when
[1:14:39] I'm older and I can't make my tapestries
[1:14:41] I'll rejoice then amen when I can't go
[1:14:44] out on the field and I can't you know I
[1:14:46] can't pull out the rocks you know and
[1:14:48] and plant a vineyard when I'm older then
[1:14:51] I'll rejoice then because I'll see the
[1:14:52] fruits of all my efforts so she didn't
[1:14:56] relax now there's nothing nothing wrong
[1:14:57] with taking a day off and relaxing okay
[1:14:59] so don't get me wrong there you gonna
[1:15:01] put your feet up and on Sunday night and
[1:15:03] take a rest
[1:15:03] you take her ass you need a day off you
[1:15:06] take a day off but I'm just saying pride
[1:15:08] you don't pat yourself on the back side
[1:15:10] look what I've done mom the best you
[1:15:12] know we don't pride always leads to
[1:15:15] contention the Bible says pride always
[1:15:18] leads to a downfall so this shows this
[1:15:20] woman was not prideful she was doing all
[1:15:23] these side businesses with humility
[1:15:25] saying god you're my strength you're
[1:15:28] gonna give me wisdom for this vineyard
[1:15:29] or it's gonna feed our family 20 years
[1:15:31] down the road when I have grandchildren
[1:15:33] and all these all these needs that come
[1:15:35] up you're gonna be my strength and
[1:15:37] everything she did she was looking to
[1:15:39] honor Christ amen which we know Jehovah
[1:15:42] right but we know Moses serve each owes
[1:15:45] Christ right and Christ ministered to
[1:15:47] him in the wilderness that's right
[1:15:49] that's what Hebrews says so we know it
[1:15:51] was the Holy Spirit Christ
[1:15:54] so she looks forward with gladness and
[1:15:58] she's confident in the fruits that she
[1:16:01] shall reap she knows she knows she's
[1:16:03] live a godly life she know she's
[1:16:05] planning a lot of things and what the
[1:16:06] Bible say the Bible says do not become
[1:16:09] weary in well-doing for ye will reap if
[1:16:11] you not faint Amen always about in the
[1:16:15] work of the Lord for anything you do for
[1:16:17] God is not in vain Amen hallelujah
[1:16:20] that's exactly right
[1:16:22] nothing we do for Christ is in vain he
[1:16:25] sees it all and just like that will
[1:16:27] rejoice in time to come that's right
[1:16:33] and then she has stray
[1:16:35] like the young and honor' like the
[1:16:37] elders that's what she has she's so
[1:16:38] strong so she has strength and honor her
[1:16:41] clothing she's strong she's she acts
[1:16:45] younger than she is we'd say and then
[1:16:47] she's she's so honored she acts like an
[1:16:49] elder to a head now I don't have time
[1:16:53] for all these scriptures but I've just I
[1:16:54] was caught up in my concordance and I
[1:16:57] noticed all the times clothing was it
[1:16:59] was a type of spiritual anointing of the
[1:17:02] anointing of the Holy Spirit so job said
[1:17:05] righteousness has clothed me my
[1:17:07] judgments were my robes so see that's
[1:17:10] what judgments is your wisdom so he was
[1:17:12] anointed with wisdom it's like he wore
[1:17:15] it every everybody saw his wisdom by the
[1:17:18] life that he lived
[1:17:19] so when strengthened on her her clothing
[1:17:22] it means the anointing of the Holy
[1:17:24] Spirit
[1:17:24] and the Bible said we are clothed with
[1:17:27] salvation the Bible said we wear robes
[1:17:31] of righteousness which is doing the
[1:17:34] right thing
[1:17:35] Romans says I love this one put you on
[1:17:37] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:39] put him on wake up in the morning and
[1:17:42] put on Jesus amen being Jesus to your
[1:17:45] your family aim ahead your work your
[1:17:48] school be Jesus wherever you go put him
[1:17:51] on and the Bible said Timothy or Paul
[1:17:55] told Timothy be adorned with good works
[1:17:56] more than riches so put on good works
[1:18:00] more than you do riches and then the
[1:18:02] Bible said be clothed with humility so
[1:18:06] search if you picture this woman this
[1:18:07] picture had you know this woman was
[1:18:09] going to sleep she had you know that
[1:18:10] that candle on at night if something
[1:18:13] stirred she got up took care of it maybe
[1:18:15] went back to bed but then got up early
[1:18:17] got everybody's food ready made the food
[1:18:19] and then once all this the maidens wet
[1:18:21] and the children and all their things
[1:18:22] remember she's out of order stage of her
[1:18:24] life then she got down to some of her
[1:18:26] businesses that she had on her heart to
[1:18:28] do and she never did it with pride she
[1:18:30] did it with humility in other words God
[1:18:33] give me the grace to make these belts so
[1:18:35] I can sell them and make a good increase
[1:18:37] here and make a profit so I can take
[1:18:39] care of my family that's what she wanted
[1:18:41] to do and so that everyone will know
[1:18:43] that my husband's a godly man that were
[1:18:45] a godly family we'll sell them for a
[1:18:47] good price won't cheat anybody
[1:18:49] right he had a good reputation she made
[1:18:52] it a one product we saw that on Sunday
[1:18:54] night she had the finest of these
[1:18:57] clothes I mean she she made a good
[1:18:59] product that's what I love about you
[1:19:02] know a voice of God you know I don't
[1:19:03] agree with their doctor now about you
[1:19:05] know tapes only and things I don't agree
[1:19:07] with that and I don't agree with brother
[1:19:08] Brahim every word he said was the state
[1:19:10] the Lord we'd none of us none of us
[1:19:11] believe that I hope you don't believe
[1:19:12] that as much as we appreciate here but
[1:19:14] one thing I love about them is that they
[1:19:16] do at a one product that's what I love
[1:19:18] about them and I certainly respect that
[1:19:20] and appreciate that that's why I support
[1:19:21] them and I buy their books for you if
[1:19:23] you want their books now if they start
[1:19:25] injecting thoughts in those books then
[1:19:28] I'll get rid of those and well not buy
[1:19:29] those but as long as they just keep it
[1:19:32] what brother bear have said then we can
[1:19:33] rejoice right because brother Ram never
[1:19:37] taught those things some of those things
[1:19:39] that we disagree on he never taught
[1:19:41] those things like recently I heard a
[1:19:45] certain member of the family say that
[1:19:47] the real fivefold ministry was tape boys
[1:19:50] people that just go and you know play
[1:19:53] tapes and don't preach and brother
[1:19:54] Branham never said that so see they
[1:19:57] missed they took a quote I forget which
[1:19:59] quote it was they took it and they
[1:20:01] misinterpreted it was from desperation
[1:20:03] his desperation 63 and they they're
[1:20:05] they're making a statement saying well
[1:20:06] brother Graham said oh the tape boys
[1:20:08] finally got in there to Rahab and the
[1:20:11] family members step back and said see
[1:20:13] that's the real fivefold ministry and I
[1:20:14] have the link if you want to watch it
[1:20:16] I'm not making this up I would never I'm
[1:20:18] not speaking bad about people I'm just
[1:20:20] letting you know we've got to rightly
[1:20:22] divide the word of truth and that's what
[1:20:24] my job is to do rightly divide the word
[1:20:27] of truth to make sure you're eating
[1:20:30] sheep food all the time and that you're
[1:20:34] solid you cuz you're solid on the word
[1:20:36] and you just believing the word of God
[1:20:40] okay so her anointing not after she
[1:20:45] delivers her own goods when she's little
[1:20:47] older her real anointing is strengths
[1:20:50] and honors the real Holy Ghost that's
[1:20:51] what she's really clothed with and she
[1:20:53] she's so shamed face it in a where that
[1:20:57] her greatest joys lay in the future
[1:20:59] she's not going to get caught up in her
[1:21:01] current prosperity
[1:21:03] and all the good things that aren't
[1:21:04] gonna get caught up on that and get
[1:21:06] prideful or get lazy or think she's
[1:21:08] better she's gonna stay humble because
[1:21:12] the Bible says she's not rejoicing now
[1:21:14] she's gonna wait till later to rejoice
[1:21:17] when I'm older when I'm ordering I can't
[1:21:20] do this anymore and the evil days come
[1:21:22] member Solomon said that the evil days
[1:21:25] come when you get old and you don't
[1:21:26] enjoy life anymore
[1:21:27] oh it sounds so awful but I've you know
[1:21:31] I talked to Helen and Helen does it I
[1:21:33] don't think she mind me telling she's
[1:21:34] but but she you know she said every time
[1:21:36] I get up I heard and there's she said I
[1:21:38] guess that's how old I am I'm 92 years
[1:21:39] old you know and it's kind of just this
[1:21:41] running joke she tells me that's hard
[1:21:43] being old and that's what Solomon said
[1:21:47] when the evil days come so remember the
[1:21:50] creator in the days of your youth I'm so
[1:21:53] glad I got saved at 19 and I heard the
[1:21:55] message at 21 I could give the greatest
[1:21:57] years of my life but and I'm starting to
[1:21:59] get a little pain now like for example I
[1:22:00] sit on the floor at school and I sit
[1:22:02] indian-style to read with the kids and
[1:22:04] 20 minutes later I can hardly stand up
[1:22:06] that's how old I'm getting I feel like
[1:22:08] I'm oh I can hardly I just walk like
[1:22:10] this I mean like what is going on with
[1:22:11] my body I never had trouble like this
[1:22:13] I'm only 37 but that's what they're
[1:22:17] saying like when you get older your
[1:22:19] body's breaking down and you want to
[1:22:21] look back and at the end of your road as
[1:22:23] you're closing your eyes you want to say
[1:22:24] this is the greatest moment of my life
[1:22:26] even though I'm in all this paint
[1:22:27] because in five minutes I'll be with
[1:22:29] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah like Billy
[1:22:32] Sunday said hey man are you nervous no
[1:22:34] he said this is the day of my coronation
[1:22:36] amen he said I'll be with Christ in five
[1:22:39] minutes hallelujah because he gave His
[1:22:41] life he gave the early years of his life
[1:22:43] to Christ and he knew who he was serving
[1:22:46] hallelujah he was serving the risen Lord
[1:22:48] amen and then that's a time he would
[1:22:52] rejoice they cry tears of joy
[1:22:54] remember when says I did I tell you this
[1:22:56] one sister Karen's mom passed away she
[1:22:58] and her brothers heard the angels
[1:23:00] singing before she passed away and she
[1:23:03] served a brother
[1:23:04] peregrines church from 1966 all the way
[1:23:08] to when Peregrine passed away and angels
[1:23:11] were singing now what it would be more
[1:23:12] important to be a millionaire she was a
[1:23:14] millionaire
[1:23:15] not hear the angels singing or just live
[1:23:18] a humble godly life a shamefaced life a
[1:23:20] life of humility and then at the end of
[1:23:22] your life hear the angels singing before
[1:23:24] you cross over in that dimension hey I'd
[1:23:27] rather have the angels singing amen
[1:23:29] I'd rather have that testimony to keep
[1:23:32] humble and then rejoice in times to come
[1:23:35] hallelujah that's the kind of clothing I
[1:23:41] on one to strengthen honor the baptism
[1:23:45] of the Holy Ghost proper 31:26 I didn't
[1:23:50] send a timer so I better set one now
[1:23:52] give me 15 minutes I'll try to finish up
[1:23:55] here 31:26 I like this she openeth her
[1:24:02] mouth with wisdom
[1:24:04] not with foolishness wisdom now
[1:24:10] brother's us to write we can say foolish
[1:24:12] things too but this is member the focus
[1:24:15] and this also can apply to the church we
[1:24:18] we all need to open our mouths with
[1:24:19] wisdom there's a time to joke I don't
[1:24:22] understand I understand letting off the
[1:24:23] pressure brother man man had left we
[1:24:25] understand there's times a joke but the
[1:24:27] majority of our time open our mouths it
[1:24:29] ought to be the wise words of God now
[1:24:32] idle words she opened to their mouth
[1:24:35] with wisdom and in her tongue is the law
[1:24:38] of kindness now that law makes it seem
[1:24:41] like it's really stable it's really firm
[1:24:43] right the laws the the bottom line so
[1:24:46] the bottom line of her speaking was
[1:24:48] kindness she was kind and that's what I
[1:24:52] want to be kind of voice of God tonight
[1:24:53] or I want to be kind you know I want to
[1:24:55] be kind everybody don't you just be
[1:24:58] honest you know just say well here's
[1:24:59] where we disagree but I love you yeah I
[1:25:01] appreciate you you know I thank you that
[1:25:03] you do nice things for the Lord
[1:25:05] you know kindness kindness I got an
[1:25:09] email this weekend I said brother Jesse
[1:25:11] you know yeah I watched your videos and
[1:25:13] he's a sabbatarian all he believes is
[1:25:15] that he just keeps condemning me because
[1:25:17] I don't I don't take the Sabbath day as
[1:25:19] a literal day and I keep saying it's
[1:25:22] shown in the same scripture the Bible
[1:25:23] said this is the rest with stammering
[1:25:25] lips and another tongue will I speak to
[1:25:27] this people and
[1:25:28] this is the rest I told him the rest is
[1:25:31] the baptism with all he goes
[1:25:32] but he's so indoctrinated he can't see
[1:25:34] it I'm trying to be kind to him
[1:25:36] anyways he said I watched your videos I
[1:25:38] never sense one ounce of love and all
[1:25:40] these things I felt bad but I just was
[1:25:42] real kind I said well thank you brother
[1:25:43] I appreciate your your email I said but
[1:25:48] even though you don't feel love I know I
[1:25:51] made those videos with love and my proof
[1:25:54] is jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:25:55] commands and all my videos are teaching
[1:25:57] you to obey Jesus's commands they met
[1:26:02] but people but oh you don't feel any
[1:26:04] love I don't feel any emotion I don't
[1:26:06] feel any love and all these things like
[1:26:07] that let people criticize but let us
[1:26:12] have the law of kindness like I was
[1:26:17] talking to I'll just let me just put a
[1:26:19] let me just put a wreath on brother Jim
[1:26:21] schumake's neck for a few minutes can I
[1:26:22] do that he doesn't even know I'm gonna
[1:26:23] say this but those two Canadian brothers
[1:26:25] we talked about that are visiting
[1:26:27] churches and they're causing all these
[1:26:28] you know they're having to call the cops
[1:26:30] on him because they're condemning people
[1:26:31] in the parking lots well they came to
[1:26:33] brother Jim's Church and he was telling
[1:26:35] me this story and he said the brother
[1:26:37] the two brothers were condemning their
[1:26:39] music and saying oh you can only sing
[1:26:40] hymns you can't sing like new
[1:26:41] contemporary songs and brother Jim said
[1:26:46] as their voices rose brother Jim stayed
[1:26:48] calm and used the law of kindness now he
[1:26:51] didn't say that but that's what I see in
[1:26:53] the situation and he looked at him and
[1:26:55] said and he said real calmly he said
[1:26:57] brother is the Lord leading you to go
[1:26:59] around churches and cause divisions and
[1:27:02] brother Jim said the brother looked at
[1:27:04] him didn't answer and just started
[1:27:05] talking about something else
[1:27:06] at church that's the law of kindness
[1:27:08] right there see you can correct and
[1:27:10] rebuke somebody with total kindness it's
[1:27:14] all about your spirit if you keep your
[1:27:16] spear under control and ask for the
[1:27:19] wisdom of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:20] you can rebuke and bring correction and
[1:27:22] you don't you don't to get mad you don't
[1:27:24] to stomp your feet you don't have to
[1:27:25] loosen up your tie and your shirt and
[1:27:27] say well let's talk about this let's go
[1:27:29] sit down in the officer let's go let's
[1:27:31] go out to the parking lot well how will
[1:27:33] talk this out clothes
[1:27:39] strength and honor right open your mouth
[1:27:43] in wisdom that was such a wise question
[1:27:46] and isn't interesting the spirit behind
[1:27:48] that person couldn't answer and say God
[1:27:49] is leading me to do this I know God's
[1:27:52] leading me to preach the gospel I know
[1:27:54] God's leading me to have more children
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:57] I know God's leading me to make youtube
[1:27:58] videos I know that how do you know
[1:28:00] because I've already prayed about it and
[1:28:01] God's already put it on my heart praise
[1:28:04] the Lord so now no one could talk me out
[1:28:06] of it when I see God's hand in it and
[1:28:08] he's leaving me to do that and the Holy
[1:28:10] Spirit is with me amen nobody could talk
[1:28:12] me out of that see in everything we do
[1:28:17] we need to have God's approval first
[1:28:19] right there's no way this woman would go
[1:28:23] out and buy a field until she pondered
[1:28:24] it in other words prayed about it or
[1:28:28] this is this Lanza land is getting more
[1:28:30] expensive Lord here in Judea or what is
[1:28:32] it get in Ohio a lot more expensive in
[1:28:34] Ohio in it brother Adam it's getting
[1:28:38] really expensive Lord is this something
[1:28:40] I should do a you know 20 years we'll
[1:28:42] have more children and and we'll have a
[1:28:44] grandchildren Lord is this something
[1:28:45] you're lead and the Holy Spirit must
[1:28:46] have put on her heart yes do this you
[1:28:50] have to get out there and work but you
[1:28:52] have the time to do this now and so the
[1:28:55] Holy Spirit was guiding all this Lord
[1:28:57] should I make belts at my house or not
[1:28:59] should I sell on eBay
[1:29:01] should I do this on Amazon humble
[1:29:03] yourself humble yourself and see if God
[1:29:06] will anoint you to do his will but see
[1:29:10] the most most usually people don't
[1:29:11] really pray about it they just do like a
[1:29:13] five-second prayer or in their little
[1:29:15] quick bedtime prayer but you got to lay
[1:29:17] before the Lord and you got to pray with
[1:29:19] sincerity because if not you're just
[1:29:23] guessing you're just guessing and what I
[1:29:26] waited eight years with the YouTube
[1:29:30] videos because in 2005 I had the burden
[1:29:32] to make videos and I just waited on the
[1:29:34] Lord waiting on the Lord we learn and
[1:29:35] then 2013 to finally put them on YouTube
[1:29:37] I just got more emails back today just
[1:29:39] people being blessed all around the
[1:29:40] world you know so it's just you just got
[1:29:43] to wait on the Lord and you got to
[1:29:44] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:46] now look Jesus said from abundance of
[1:29:49] the heart the mouth speaks so this woman
[1:29:51] had an abundant
[1:29:53] of wisdom just laying there in her heart
[1:29:56] because wisdom and then wisdom begins
[1:29:58] with the fear of the Lord so before she
[1:30:00] had all this wisdom in here she had the
[1:30:02] fear of the Lord first Lord I don't want
[1:30:05] to displease you Lord I know you're a
[1:30:08] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:30:10] you I also know you rebuke all those who
[1:30:13] transgress your laws so before she did
[1:30:15] any of these great works she first had
[1:30:19] to wrestle it out and say well lord I
[1:30:20] fear you first whatever you say I'll do
[1:30:22] no matter what the Word of God says I
[1:30:25] won't compromise God's Word amen
[1:30:27] I'll never compromise God's Word she had
[1:30:29] to get that settled first and then God
[1:30:32] could trust her with the field then God
[1:30:34] could trust her with a belt business I
[1:30:36] just I think that's so so interesting
[1:30:39] that God would use her as the model so
[1:30:43] belts made comforters for her bed I
[1:30:47] think this is astounding astounding no
[1:30:53] now speaking of her words remember
[1:30:56] contrast this godly woman with a
[1:30:58] adulterous harlot who is loud and
[1:31:00] clamorous and everybody could hear in
[1:31:02] the streets what a contrast she only
[1:31:06] speaks wisdom she's not rejoicing now
[1:31:09] you know she's not boasting now she just
[1:31:11] speaks wisdom she only opens her mouth
[1:31:12] really for wisdom and here we got this
[1:31:14] loud obnoxious glamorous woman who's
[1:31:18] always bragging and laughing and joking
[1:31:20] and dirty words and cuss words and all
[1:31:24] kinds of things like that look at the
[1:31:26] difference between these two now she
[1:31:30] speaks with the law of kindness and God
[1:31:32] help us to minister grace to the ears of
[1:31:35] our words I'm gonna read that Ephesians
[1:31:37] 4:29 that's a good scripture to read
[1:31:38] just to remind us now Church you know
[1:31:41] this but if you if you really feel led
[1:31:44] to rebuke somebody and doesn't sound
[1:31:45] kind then if that's of God then you got
[1:31:47] to do what God tells you to do
[1:31:48] but if we don't have that leading to
[1:31:50] rebuke somebody then let's just be kind
[1:31:52] about it
[1:31:53] visions 4:29
[1:32:05] you know it's the most often I feel led
[1:32:07] to rebuke people is just behind the
[1:32:09] pulpit because the Bible said rebuke
[1:32:11] them before rebuke them that sin before
[1:32:15] all that others may fear does he that
[1:32:17] makes perfect sense the main time I'm
[1:32:20] supposed to rebuke is behind the pulpit
[1:32:23] because that's what the scripture says
[1:32:25] that's when I feel the most zealous for
[1:32:27] the word and you know I don't care what
[1:32:29] anybody says if people walk out or leave
[1:32:30] that's fine I hear I'm anointed I don't
[1:32:33] care what anybody says all I care about
[1:32:35] is what God says that's how hard to say
[1:32:38] but that's the truth remember there's
[1:32:39] quotes from a person I wish I'd have to
[1:32:41] bring this message on my own self I
[1:32:42] don't want to hurt people but I remember
[1:32:44] that quote from the church age brother
[1:32:45] Graham said but if I don't preach it and
[1:32:47] you said Jesus will send me to hell
[1:32:49] remember that from the church ages if
[1:32:51] brother Eminem preached these things
[1:32:53] about the Trinity and the false baptism
[1:32:55] and the cutting the hair and the makeup
[1:32:56] and all this adultery and all these
[1:32:58] things if he didn't preach it he
[1:33:00] disobeyed Christ and he did he'd be a
[1:33:02] worker iniquity and be sent to hell
[1:33:05] that's for all of us we've all got to
[1:33:07] stand with the truth
[1:33:08] how many gonna stand with the truth I am
[1:33:11] seasons for 29 let no corrupt
[1:33:14] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:33:16] but that which is good to the use of
[1:33:18] edifying which means building up
[1:33:20] building up the person that's right in
[1:33:23] the email I try to thank the sabbatarian
[1:33:25] thank you for your study thank you for
[1:33:26] your time but here's where we disagree
[1:33:28] try to build him up pray about it he
[1:33:32] says that it may Minister grace to the
[1:33:35] ears so most of our words are going to
[1:33:40] be kindness and grace to people we have
[1:33:43] to we have to tell them the truth we
[1:33:44] have to differ with them but we have to
[1:33:47] say it in a kind graceful way right like
[1:33:52] people invite me oh let's go bowling on
[1:33:53] Wednesday night or let's uh can your
[1:33:56] children watch this movie I have to say
[1:33:57] oh I'm sorry you know I just say with
[1:33:59] grace I'm sorry you know we have church
[1:34:00] Wednesday night and that takes
[1:34:02] precedence over a birthday party bowling
[1:34:04] on Wednesday night you know I appreciate
[1:34:06] that but oh you know we like to do
[1:34:11] or that that movie might be good but let
[1:34:14] me read the reviews and my wife and I
[1:34:15] we'd like to preview the movies before
[1:34:16] our children watch them because Satan
[1:34:19] might slip some awful stuff on there and
[1:34:21] then who's accountable
[1:34:23] I am well I'm sorry they can't go to the
[1:34:26] movie theatres with you I'm sorry about
[1:34:28] that but that's that's that's how we you
[1:34:30] know the Bible says said no evil thing
[1:34:32] before their eyes right I've said no
[1:34:34] wicked thing before my eyes so see we
[1:34:38] have this we have to be up they'll have
[1:34:39] the law of kindness
[1:34:40] we must minister grace to the ears all
[1:34:44] right so we keep building her resume
[1:34:45] well John I've been talked about his
[1:34:47] resume I bet it's a pretty good resume
[1:34:48] from brother John but this is a pretty
[1:34:51] godly resume here for the proverbs 31
[1:34:52] woman she speaks wise and gracious words
[1:34:55] look at this woman
[1:34:57] look at this godly woman right proverbs
[1:35:01] 31 27 and I got I got four minutes on my
[1:35:04] 15 I get I told you okay I'll try to
[1:35:06] stop there 27 I'm sorry proverbs 31 27
[1:35:10] I'm in Ephesians she looketh well to the
[1:35:14] ways of her household and eateth not the
[1:35:17] bread of idleness so in other words
[1:35:22] Church she's a dedicated guide of the
[1:35:24] home she knows everything that's going
[1:35:26] on in the home and she's very active not
[1:35:30] I don't know what does the Bible call
[1:35:31] idle busybodies the Bible calls them
[1:35:33] going from house to house basically
[1:35:35] gossiping right so we know that's what
[1:35:38] idleness is spending your time gossiping
[1:35:41] spending your time on things that don't
[1:35:43] promote the welfare of others they don't
[1:35:44] build people up right so this woman was
[1:35:47] not involved with that she was
[1:35:50] constantly trying to make the home a
[1:35:52] better place and she didn't partake of
[1:35:55] idle words and idle moments remember
[1:35:59] she's not rejoicing now she's gonna work
[1:36:00] hard now then she'll rejoice at the end
[1:36:02] of her life amen so what is it now what
[1:36:05] is she let's add to a resume now she's
[1:36:07] extremely focused manager of the home
[1:36:10] just you know this is why I've been
[1:36:12] called to do I've got jobs on the side
[1:36:14] here but but I can do those but still be
[1:36:17] focused right here right I know what's
[1:36:20] going on here and she's an active worker
[1:36:22] in her home she's not getting into other
[1:36:25] people's
[1:36:25] business she's just taking care of her
[1:36:27] own business that's this is a godly
[1:36:29] woman
[1:36:30] now let's stand here and let's just read
[1:36:31] that let's listen as we stand here let's
[1:36:34] listen what is going to happen to a
[1:36:35] woman who has all this wisdom flowing
[1:36:40] from her heart of fear of God what are
[1:36:43] the people in her house gonna say about
[1:36:45] her proverbs 31:28 so see now we're done
[1:36:53] we have gone through all those and I
[1:36:55] want I want to put those on a slide and
[1:36:56] just I just want to be overwhelmed and I
[1:36:58] want to be challenged by all the
[1:37:01] attributes this woman has so I may have
[1:37:03] that next week by God's next Wednesday
[1:37:05] night because I just want to be
[1:37:06] challenged with that I want to be
[1:37:07] blessed by that and I'd also like to do
[1:37:10] this I may be one more sermon on this I
[1:37:11] like to take all those attributes and
[1:37:13] then place it for her time period of her
[1:37:15] life so for example you know married
[1:37:18] without children married with young
[1:37:20] children married with older children and
[1:37:23] empty nest wouldn't it be nice to kind
[1:37:25] of place those so you could see which
[1:37:27] which stage of her life were these for I
[1:37:28] think that'd be really nice but I think
[1:37:30] you know if we read it again I think God
[1:37:32] would show us which stage were in right
[1:37:33] or if the sisters let's look at this
[1:37:36] that says because let's look at verse 28
[1:37:39] her children arise up and call her
[1:37:45] slave-driver
[1:37:47] did I read that right no now they rise
[1:37:51] up so they were down maybe little we'd
[1:37:54] say but they rise up so once they get
[1:37:57] older they'll call her blessed and I'm a
[1:38:00] witness to that I didn't like my mom
[1:38:01] very much growing up cuz I was a sinner
[1:38:02] I didn't say much good things about or
[1:38:05] growing up but now if anybody asked me
[1:38:07] also I'm gonna say his good things I'll
[1:38:08] say we differ on this I hope my mom
[1:38:10] grows out her hair I hope she stops
[1:38:12] wearing makeup I love my momma my even
[1:38:14] children my children even witness to her
[1:38:16] about makeup last time at the house in a
[1:38:18] very godly way and I tell her to her
[1:38:21] face I'll tell her the differences that
[1:38:23] we have but if somebody asked me now
[1:38:25] I'll praise my mom and say thank God she
[1:38:27] prayed for me all those days thank God
[1:38:30] she drugged me to church you said your
[1:38:32] parents drugged you yes they drugged me
[1:38:34] to church that's right they drugged me
[1:38:37] to church
[1:38:39] and very thankful for that her children
[1:38:43] rise up call her blessed her husband
[1:38:47] also and he praises her so brothers you
[1:38:52] need to do that to your wife your wife
[1:38:53] does something good praise her and mean
[1:38:55] it from your heart don't overuse it like
[1:38:57] I overused I told my wife you're the
[1:38:59] best cook in the country and I just joke
[1:39:01] around about that but you know bro
[1:39:03] Graham used that one it gets overused
[1:39:04] you know tell her how pretty she is you
[1:39:06] know I like that new dress or you know
[1:39:08] all your hair looks pretty like that you
[1:39:10] know when you wear like that but also
[1:39:12] bless her for all that she does in the
[1:39:14] home because I think I told you before
[1:39:19] but you know when my wife's been sick
[1:39:20] and I've had to take care of the whole
[1:39:21] home I'm worn out at the end of one day
[1:39:24] I'm exhausted my feet her from being in
[1:39:27] the kitchen all day and back hurts from
[1:39:30] leaning down and doing all the work you
[1:39:31] know I just hold all the children all
[1:39:34] day you know I just I'm tired of the day
[1:39:36] they do a lot of great amazing work and
[1:39:39] the Holy Spirit tells us why right here
[1:39:43] this is her this is her position her
[1:39:47] husband also and caught and he praises
[1:39:49] her verse 29 many daughters have done
[1:39:54] virtuously right but thou excels this
[1:39:57] woman excels all of them
[1:39:59] this woman is this is a special woman
[1:40:03] and just like Christ was an amazing a
[1:40:06] perfect immortal man we could never live
[1:40:09] up to that we should strive to live as
[1:40:11] close to like Christ as we can glory and
[1:40:14] sisters you should strive to be like
[1:40:16] this woman this one excels all the other
[1:40:19] ones this one and how did it start she
[1:40:23] feared the Lord that's how it started
[1:40:25] verse 30 favor is deceitful and beauty
[1:40:29] is vain but a woman that feared the Lord
[1:40:34] she shall be praised so at the end of
[1:40:36] this woman's life what are some of the
[1:40:39] rewards that she has her children bless
[1:40:41] her her children don't curse her and run
[1:40:44] her down her children bless her and her
[1:40:47] husband praises her
[1:40:51] this is what a godly life will produce
[1:40:53] the people you're closest to will bless
[1:40:57] and praise you right and how many want
[1:41:01] to live like that
[1:41:02] we're the people around you no you're
[1:41:04] not pretending you're not perfect but
[1:41:06] you've got the perfect one inside of you
[1:41:08] correcting you every day my children
[1:41:10] know I'm not perfect I get tired I get
[1:41:12] worn out I get discouraged but I hope I
[1:41:15] trust they see Christ in me that I'm
[1:41:19] trying I and I and I trust by God's
[1:41:21] grace they'll raise up and call their
[1:41:22] mother blessed and I always I tried to
[1:41:27] praise my wife on Facebook and also to
[1:41:28] her face as well I try to do that often
[1:41:31] to let everybody know how much I
[1:41:33] appreciate my wife for all she does look
[1:41:35] at verse 30 give her what the fruit of
[1:41:39] her hands in other words let her reap
[1:41:41] what she has sowed let all this love and
[1:41:44] all this work and all this effort and
[1:41:46] all this diligence let it all flood back
[1:41:48] to her because Jesus is gonna say well
[1:41:52] done enter into the kingdom the joys
[1:41:55] that been prepared for you from the
[1:41:56] foundation of the world if you invest in
[1:41:59] in your family your children in your
[1:42:01] church in your community and helping the
[1:42:03] poor if you invest all that it'll all
[1:42:06] come back to you how many believe that
[1:42:07] God will not owe you one penny he will
[1:42:11] pay you back right amen give her the
[1:42:16] fruit of her hands and let her own works
[1:42:18] praise her in the gate so she she wasn't
[1:42:21] praising herself but her works praised
[1:42:24] her everybody said my this woman she
[1:42:26] just does she just does wonderful things
[1:42:28] when does she sleep when does she have
[1:42:31] time for anything she has certain stages
[1:42:34] of her life she found what God wanted
[1:42:37] her to do and she poured herself into
[1:42:39] that for the glory of God
[1:42:41] that's just our head seers were closing
[1:42:43] by the grace of Lord next time maybe I
[1:42:46] didn't get to this but I want to get to
[1:42:47] this but like I said the timing of the
[1:42:49] works I like to put these works in an
[1:42:52] order of her life just to give you an
[1:42:54] idea but we'll see what the Lord has I'm
[1:42:56] not promising now I'm not making any
[1:42:58] promises praise God

[1:43:22] Wednesday night service like as I told
[1:43:24] you I'm incredibly challenged by these
[1:43:26] scriptures this is how God would define
[1:43:32] a wise woman a rare special valuable
[1:43:40] woman heavenly father or we've completed
[1:43:47] most of this chapter Lord in these four
[1:43:51] short services Lord and my they've gone
[1:43:54] fast I look back in it can't believe
[1:43:57] there's already just been four on this
[1:43:58] one chapter but no this is what you
[1:44:03] wanted us to know in this hour in an age
[1:44:06] where most women are out of place and
[1:44:08] out of position in government in homes
[1:44:11] and churches because of false doctor in
[1:44:16] the age of science and the exalting of a
[1:44:20] woman's world we'd say exalting our
[1:44:24] flesh and exalting her sex appeal in a
[1:44:27] wicked age like this we can look back to
[1:44:29] the scripture hallelujah
[1:44:31] before your coming and we can see this
[1:44:34] is the kind of character that the Word
[1:44:36] of God will produce these are the works
[1:44:39] these are the actions in the lives of
[1:44:41] the sisters that we should expect and
[1:44:43] then as brothers we can take
[1:44:45] encouragement and we can also learn
[1:44:47] spiritual lessons or that we can be more
[1:44:51] diligent
[1:44:52] that we can close ourselves we can put
[1:44:56] on the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah we
[1:45:00] can live such a life of holiness that it
[1:45:02] shines such a bright reputation on our
[1:45:04] wives and our family hallelujah Jesus
[1:45:09] hallelujah if we have an enemy it's not
[1:45:13] because we made them or or we spoke the
[1:45:16] law of judgment or faust judgment but we
[1:45:19] but because they just don't like us
[1:45:21] because we're so much like Christ
[1:45:24] granted Lord let us speak the law of
[1:45:27] kindness let wisdom flow from our lips
