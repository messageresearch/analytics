[0:00] verse 11.
[0:09] I'd like to preach on John the Baptist
[0:11] today by God's grace. My title is the
[0:14] greatest yet the least. I'd like to
[0:16] preach that today. The greatest yet the
[0:19] least.
[0:32] always been a puzzling scripture. Uh I
[0:35] guess to me like I shared uh last week
[0:38] with uh the scripture and the story
[0:42] about
[0:43] uh how the bride was taken out of Jesus
[0:47] at Calvary. That was always a puzzling
[0:50] thing to me. Uh, then God opened it up
[0:52] and I feel like today this has opened up
[0:54] to me as well. So I trust it be a
[0:56] blessing to you. Amen.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; Matthew 11. The greatest yet the least.
[1:02] Hallelujah.
[1:05] Let's all read verse 11. Ready? 1 2 3.
[1:08] Verily I say unto you, among them that
[1:11] are born of women, there hath not risen
[1:15] a greater than John the Baptist.
[1:18] Notwithstanding, he that is least in the
[1:21] kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
[1:25] Let's have one more word of prayer. If
[1:26] you have a need on your heart, let's
[1:27] make it known unto God here.
[1:30] Father God, we're grateful for today. We
[1:31] love you, Lord God. We give you honor
[1:33] and praise. We worship you today. We
[1:35] sang the songs of Zion, Lord God. We've
[1:37] sang the songs of the new Jerusalem,
[1:38] Lord God, until we get a new song. We'll
[1:41] keep singing these songs, Lord God,
[1:42] because they're glorious songs, truths,
[1:45] Lord, that we want to sing and remember
[1:47] how we have victory in Jesus by the
[1:49] blood of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord
[1:50] God, for the victory today. I pray you
[1:52] give the church victory today, Lord God.
[1:54] Hallelujah. Lord, I pray also for
[1:56] healing of our bodies, Lord. For those
[1:58] that are not here, Lord God, strength
[2:01] for our minds, Lord God, to cast down
[2:03] anything that exalts itself against the
[2:05] word of God. Hallelujah. We love you,
[2:07] Lord God. We worship you today. Help me
[2:09] to get aside that you might speak. Faith
[2:11] comes by hearing. Hearing by the word of
[2:13] God. There's only one way to pep up or
[2:15] stir up the church. That's through the
[2:16] hearing of the word. So may we hear your
[2:19] word and then may we believe your word.
[2:21] Lord God, I pray you bless this service
[2:24] here today in Jesus Christ's name. And
[2:26] the saints said, "Amen." God bless you
[2:28] as you're being seated.
[2:30] The greatest yet the least. Now, to
[2:34] begin with, I don't think any of us are
[2:36] ever going to say, "We're greater than
[2:37] John the Baptist." Hallelujah. So, this
[2:40] sermon is not to make anybody feel like
[2:42] they should say, "I'm greater than the
[2:43] Old Testament people. I'm greater." We
[2:46] know people that call themselves the
[2:48] greatest are likely under a spirit of
[2:50] pride and delusion.
[2:53] But we are trying to understand what did
[2:55] Jesus mean when he said, "Uh, those that
[2:58] are least in the kingdom are greater
[3:00] than John the Baptist." Well, of course,
[3:02] it deals with the blood of Jesus Christ
[3:04] because when John the Baptist was on the
[3:06] earth, the blood of Jesus Christ had not
[3:08] been shed yet. Hallelujah. So, that kind
[3:11] of gives you a clue where I'm going.
[3:13] Hallelujah. Hopefully, that's helpful by
[3:15] God's grace. Now, I just want to read a
[3:17] quote. This goes along with what Brother
[3:18] Simon preached a couple weeks ago.
[3:21] I found this this morning and I shared
[3:23] it with brother Simon. Brother Bram
[3:25] said, "You can't help being what you
[3:27] are. Even if you're a sinner, you're not
[3:29] responsible for being a sinner. Now,
[3:31] does that strike anybody? Right. Brother
[3:34] Simon showed us the quotes where brother
[3:36] Ram said, "You were trapped in it." How
[3:38] many were trapped into sin?
[3:40] &gt;&gt; Now, did anybody ask to be a sinner when
[3:42] you were born? Did anybody ask to be a
[3:44] sinner? No, you already were. So, see,
[3:47] you were trapped into this or you
[3:49] couldn't help being what you were. And
[3:52] brother Ram said, "You're only
[3:54] responsible for remaining a sinner.
[3:58] There is a way prepared for you. But to
[4:00] be a sinner, you was born that way.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, brother says, God
[4:06] doesn't send you to hell for being a
[4:08] sinner. God sends you to hell because
[4:11] you won't repent and take Christ as your
[4:13] savior. Now, who's repented? And who's
[4:15] taking Christ as their savior? Amen.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; You are going to heaven. Hallelujah.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Because that's all you that's all you
[4:21] have to do. That God doesn't hold you
[4:23] responsible for your sins. He just holds
[4:25] you responsible for repenting and
[4:28] believing in Jesus Christ.
[4:31] He said some people refuse to take the
[4:33] right road. He said he said you send
[4:35] yourself to torment. You send your own
[4:38] soul to its eternal destination upon the
[4:40] free moral agency of your own
[4:42] convictions. God doesn't send anyone to
[4:45] hell. Never did and he never will. Men
[4:49] send themselves to hell because they
[4:51] refuse to accept the way of salvation.
[4:54] Hallelujah.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Does that help? By God's
[4:56] grace.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Remember that message? Brother Bo, Simon
[4:59] preached, the sinless bride. This is why
[5:01] you're sinless because you were just
[5:03] trapped into it or you just put in that
[5:05] position. And all you got to do is
[5:07] repent of that. And the Bible said, "God
[5:09] will remember your sins and iniquities
[5:11] no more." Hallelujah.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus took the curse for you. Okay. Now,
[5:17] I want to get into my text here. And I'm
[5:19] gonna set a timer here so I can I don't
[5:21] have to ask uh Lydia how long I've been
[5:24] preaching here by God's grace. So our
[5:27] text was Matthew 11:11.
[5:30] I want you to notice uh Jesus compares
[5:32] John to all the Old Testament saints.
[5:36] Adam, Abel, we'd say Eve, right? Enoch,
[5:40] Noah, Abraham, Moses, Elijah, Elisha,
[5:44] David, Solomon, even Daniel. these
[5:46] mighty men and women of God, we'd say,
[5:49] but I want you to notice the words he
[5:50] uses born of women.
[5:54] So, this is different. Jesus is not
[5:56] saying those who are born of the spirit.
[5:58] He's saying those that are born of
[6:00] women. Hallelujah. So, that's our first
[6:03] clue, right? Jesus is talking about
[6:05] people in the Old Testament that could
[6:08] not be born again of the Holy Ghost.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And John's greatness is
[6:14] measured before the cross, not after the
[6:17] cross.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've heard recently what
[6:20] the blood of Jesus Christ does. It
[6:23] forgives all your trespasses.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Who shall lay any charge to God's elect.
[6:28] It's God that justifies. The Bible said
[6:31] when Jesus rose, he justified you. He
[6:34] declared you righteous already.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So John was before the
[6:40] cross. Now all of us here, we're after
[6:43] the cross.
[6:47] So that's our foundation.
[6:51] Now I want to start. I got like I think
[6:53] I have 15 points. That might seem like a
[6:55] lot and I may not read all the verses,
[6:57] but I just want to show at least 15
[6:58] reasons why John the Baptist was greater
[7:01] than Moses. Think of it. Greater than
[7:04] Abraham. Abraham is called the friend of
[7:07] God. Hallelujah. And John the Baptist is
[7:10] still greater than Abraham. Abraham
[7:13] lived 175 years. Who knows how many
[7:15] years did John live? About 30, maybe 30
[7:18] and 30 and a half. That's it. In 30
[7:22] years, John did more than Abraham did in
[7:25] 175 years.
[7:28] Hallelujah. He did more than Moses did
[7:30] in 120 years. But think about this. He
[7:33] did more than Adam in over what? How
[7:35] many 900 years did Adam do?
[7:38] Hallelujah church. Let's take that into
[7:40] consideration. Jesus is making a great
[7:43] declaration here. Now the first reason
[7:46] if you got your Bible is Matthew 119 and
[7:49] 10.
[7:52] Here's the first reason Jesus said John
[7:54] is greater. But what you went out to
[7:57] see, I'm sorry, for to see a prophet.
[7:59] Yay, I say unto you, he was more than a
[8:02] prophet.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; So all the other brothers we just read
[8:05] out, right? Abraham, Moses, Daniel, they
[8:08] were prophets. But John was more than
[8:11] that.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; He was a messenger.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he says in the next
[8:16] verse, "For this is he of whom it is
[8:19] written, behold, I send my messenger
[8:21] before thy face, which shall prepare thy
[8:25] way before thee." Now remember,
[8:28] according to Numbers 12, a prophet is
[8:30] someone who God makes himself known to
[8:32] in dreams and visions. And then
[8:34] according to Deuteronomy 18, he tells
[8:37] the prophet or prophetist to foretell
[8:40] things that are going to happen in his
[8:42] name and they come to pass.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; But this is greater. John's messenger
[8:48] ministry was greater than those things.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:54] Amen. church. The word prepare in the
[8:57] Greek means to furnish or equip or make
[9:00] ready of builders like Malachi to
[9:03] construct, erect.
[9:06] Uh the idea of adorning and equipping
[9:09] with all things necessary. So John's
[9:12] preaching got everything ready,
[9:13] everything built in order for the
[9:16] Messiah to come and do his ministry.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:22] Now, who knows what was John's preaching
[9:24] message?
[9:26] Repentance.
[9:28] Hallelujah. So, it's amazing. All those
[9:31] prophets had great great powerful
[9:32] ministries. Think of this. Who knows how
[9:35] many uh miracles did Elisha have? 16.
[9:39] How many did Elijah have? Eight. Good.
[9:42] Got some good Bible memory there.
[9:44] Hallelujah. How many miracles did John
[9:46] the Baptist have? Zero.
[9:50] So, see, greatness is not measured in
[9:52] how many miracles you have. Greatness is
[9:55] seen in your Christlike character.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, don't don't get me
[10:01] wrong. We want miracles. I pray for
[10:02] miracles. I'm with our prayer list here.
[10:04] We're praying for miracles. We're we're
[10:06] believing. But, Brother Ram also says
[10:07] the greatest miracle is somebody getting
[10:10] saved.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You no longer love the
[10:13] world. Now you hate the world. And now
[10:16] you love Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[10:21] So John got everybody ready as a
[10:24] messenger.
[10:26] He erected the spiritual building.
[10:28] Hallelujah. He got everybody adorned and
[10:31] equipped with everything needed to
[10:33] accept the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[10:38] Hallelujah. He was more than a prophet.
[10:41] He was a messenger. Praise God.
[10:44] The second reason, John simply did not
[10:48] predict about the Messiah. John
[10:51] introduced the Messiah.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; Everybody else said, "He's coming
[10:55] someday. He's coming some someday." But
[10:57] John looked at him and SAID, "BEHOLD THE
[10:59] LAMB OF GOD. HE'S HERE." HALLELUJAH.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's what brother M said,
[11:04] why he was the greatest. Everybody else
[11:05] said, "Someday he's coming, brother
[11:07] Chris. Someday he'll get here." But John
[11:08] said, "HE IS HERE." HALLELUJAH.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; That's the second reason.
[11:13] And that was uh also found in Malachi
[11:16] 3:1. Behold, I will send my messenger,
[11:20] and he shall prepare the way before me,
[11:22] and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[11:24] come to his temple, even the messenger
[11:26] of the covenant, whom ye delight in.
[11:29] Hallelujah.
[11:31] Behold, he shall come, sayeth the Lord
[11:33] of hosts. So, I believe this is speaking
[11:36] of John the Baptist as the messenger of
[11:38] the covenant if I'm not mistaken. Or it
[11:40] might be the Lord Jesus because the
[11:42] Bible said he was more than a prophet.
[11:43] He was a messenger.
[11:46] Hallelujah. But we still get the idea
[11:48] here, church, that John did something
[11:51] nobody else ever did. And church, I'll
[11:53] say like this. He just didn't point to
[11:55] him. He got to hold the lamb of God.
[11:58] Amen. Hallelujah. They just predicted,
[12:01] but he got to say, "He's here." And he
[12:02] said, "Let me hold you. Let me baptize
[12:05] you in the water as well. It becometh me
[12:07] to fulfill all righteousness. I got to
[12:10] touch God in flesh. I got to touch
[12:13] Emmanuel. I got to baptize him. And then
[12:16] I got to see the spirit descend and
[12:19] remain on him."
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nobody else got to see that.
[12:23] Nobody else got to to see the Messiah.
[12:25] Abraham did it. Now, Job saw it in
[12:27] advance. Hallelujah. They all saw it in
[12:29] advance. The wheel in the middle of the
[12:30] wheel. We all looked at that Enoch.
[12:32] He'll come with 10,000 of his saints.
[12:34] Hallelujah. They're they all got to see
[12:36] a pattern of him or a vision of him. But
[12:39] John said, "This is him." Hallelujah.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not prophesying of him. I'm telling
[12:44] you, he's here and I I held him. I
[12:47] baptized him. Jesus is here. The Messiah
[12:50] is here.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:55] Brother Bam said, "Why was he called?"
[12:57] He's brother said, "Why? There's never
[12:59] been a man born among women as great as
[13:02] he because all the other prophets spoke
[13:04] of him, but John introduced him to the
[13:06] world. Behold the lamb of God who takes
[13:09] away the sin of the world.
[13:12] Hallelujah. So now you got two reasons.
[13:14] Hallelujah. Amen.
[13:19] Oh, there's so many beautiful verses. As
[13:21] I was studying last night and today, I'm
[13:22] like, my this there's so much on John
[13:24] the Baptist. kind of overwhelmed me a
[13:26] little bit, but I said, "Lord, just help
[13:28] me to get enough so the people can catch
[13:29] it." Hallelujah. And at the end, you'll
[13:32] see why. It's it's not it's not just to
[13:34] know about John the Baptist. It's so
[13:35] that you can have the same Christlike
[13:37] character as John the Baptist.
[13:41] Point three, John was a light to bear
[13:44] witness of the greater light. So, John
[13:47] was like the moon. Jesus is like the
[13:49] sun.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many know that you don't
[13:53] have any light of your own?
[13:55] &gt;&gt; You're like, you and I are like the
[13:56] moon. We don't have any light of oursel.
[13:58] God has to share his light with us for
[14:00] us to have any light.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Now, that's in the Bible. John 1 verse
[14:04] 6, there was a man sent from God whose
[14:06] name was John. The same came for a
[14:08] witness to bear witness of the light
[14:10] that all men through him might believe.
[14:12] So, John was sent to be a witness that
[14:14] Jesus is the light.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that what brother
[14:19] Brandon was sent to do? Amen. Brother
[14:21] was sent to say, "Look to Jesus."
[14:23] Hallelujah. I'm here to give you a true
[14:25] relationship between God and man.
[14:28] Hallelujah.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Verse eight. And he was
[14:32] not that light. Speaking of the great
[14:34] light, but he was sent to bear witness
[14:36] of that light, just like of the moon
[14:38] bears witness of the light of the sun.
[14:42] That was the true light which lightth
[14:44] every man that cometh into the world.
[14:45] Amen. The light of God gives every man
[14:48] their physical life or their spiritual
[14:50] life. But Jesus is the true light. Now
[14:55] John is a lesser light as I said because
[14:57] in John 5:33 Jesus says, "Ye sent unto
[15:01] John and he bear witness of the truth,
[15:02] but I receive not the testimony from
[15:04] man, but these things I say that you
[15:06] might be saved." What does Jesus say in
[15:08] verse 35? He was a burning and what?
[15:11] Shining light. So John was a lesser
[15:14] light. We say like a candle. Now, a
[15:17] candle's bright, but a candle's nothing
[15:19] compared to the sun.
[15:22] Everybody understand that? By God's
[15:23] grace,
[15:24] &gt;&gt; the moon is bright, but it's nothing
[15:25] compared to the sun.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; So, John was a burning light. And
[15:29] church, you and I are burning lights as
[15:31] well. In your schools, you're a burning
[15:32] light. Hallelujah. Right in your family,
[15:34] on your job, you and I are to be burning
[15:36] lights for the season that God called us
[15:39] to live.
[15:41] and you were willing for a season to
[15:44] rejoice in his life. See, the preaching
[15:46] ought to make you rejoice
[15:48] &gt;&gt; because we're preaching about Jesus
[15:49] Christ, not about me, not about brother
[15:51] Brandham. We're preaching about Jesus
[15:53] Christ. Hallelujah. That ought to make
[15:55] you rejoice. IT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
[15:57] BECAUSE THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST
[15:59] separates you from all sin and then
[16:01] says, "NOTHING CAN SEPARATE YOU AND I
[16:03] from the love of God."
[16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[16:11] Look at verse 36. But I have a greater
[16:13] witness than that of John. For the works
[16:14] which the father hath given me to
[16:16] finish, the same works that I do bear
[16:18] witness of me that the father sent me.
[16:20] So now Jesus says, "My miracles are so
[16:22] great as well. I have a greater witness
[16:24] than John." Right? Miracles don't save.
[16:28] We know that miracles don't even make
[16:30] you great. But Jesus said, "I have such
[16:32] great miracles." The Bible said you
[16:34] probably couldn't even have enough books
[16:35] to explain all the miracles of Jesus.
[16:38] That's how many miracles he did. So, he
[16:41] was a we'd say a miracle machine.
[16:43] Hallelujah. I'll say it as reverently as
[16:45] possible. He was a miracle machine.
[16:47] Miracles all the time. Amen. Hallelujah.
[16:50] Now, we've gone through three. Now,
[16:52] here's four and five. The fourth reason
[16:54] he was greater is because he was under a
[16:56] partial Nazerite vow. No alcohol. And
[17:00] fifth, he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[17:03] from his mother's womb.
[17:06] Okay. Luke 1:15,
[17:09] for he shall be great in the sight of
[17:10] the Lord, and shall drink neither wine
[17:12] nor strong drink, and he should be
[17:14] filled with the Holy Ghost, even from
[17:16] his mother's womb. Now, think about
[17:18] that. He didn't have any alcohol touch
[17:20] his lips. That made him more consecrated
[17:24] or dedicated to God.
[17:27] Hallelujah.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, that's found in Numbers
[17:30] 6:2. Speak unto the children of Israel,
[17:32] and say unto them, when either a man or
[17:34] woman shall separate themselves to a vow
[17:36] of a Nazerite, to separate themselves
[17:38] unto the Lord, he shall separate himself
[17:40] from wine and strong drink, and shall
[17:43] drink no vinegar or wine or vinegar of a
[17:45] strong drink, neither shall he drink any
[17:47] liquor of of grapes, nor eat moist
[17:49] grapes or dried.
[17:52] Hallelujah.
[17:54] Now, what did what did Noah do? What was
[17:55] his awful sin? Drunkenness.
[17:59] But see, we can clearly see John the
[18:00] Baptist was greater than that.
[18:03] Hallelujah. So, physically, he didn't
[18:07] let wine go into his body. That made him
[18:09] more dedicated to God.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, you and I should drink
[18:13] wine because Jesus told us to.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Right? Do this in remembrance until I
[18:18] come.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:22] Now, the part about being filled with
[18:24] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[18:25] womb, you should remember this, but in
[18:27] John 7, the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[18:30] could not be given until Jesus was
[18:32] glorified. So, how did John have the
[18:34] Holy Ghost if John 7 says you can't have
[18:37] the Holy Ghost? Because John couldn't
[18:39] have it in the soul. He could have it in
[18:41] the human spirit.
[18:43] Okay? There's three parts to man. Body,
[18:47] spirit, soul. John could have it here,
[18:50] but he couldn't have it here.
[18:53] Okay, everybody got that? By God's
[18:54] grace.
[18:57] But it's still true that he had the Holy
[19:00] Ghost in his mind even in the womb. So
[19:04] that tells you the babies in the womb
[19:05] have thinking going on. Now, they can't
[19:08] remember it, but they got it.
[19:10] Hallelujah.
[19:13] Oh my.
[19:15] Now, I want you to catch this here.
[19:18] And I'm I think I I think you'll catch
[19:20] it. In other words, John the Baptist had
[19:23] the second work of grace basically from
[19:26] the womb. What's the first work of
[19:28] grace? Everybody say it out loud.
[19:29] Justification. Good. Good Bible church.
[19:31] What's the second work of grace? Very
[19:34] good. What's the third work of grace?
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Baptism with the Holy Ghost. Filled with
[19:38] the Holy Ghost. Very good. So John had a
[19:40] if his mind was filled with the Holy
[19:42] Ghost, then it's as if he already had
[19:44] the second work of grace. What is the
[19:46] second work of grace? Sanctification. Uh
[19:49] Ezekiel called it a new heart and a new
[19:52] spirit. So he called it a new spirit. So
[19:55] think about this church.
[19:57] His spirit was already his mind was
[20:00] already consecrated to God. In other
[20:02] words, brother Chris, he was ready to o
[20:03] overcome all those mind battles.
[20:06] He came out of the womb overcoming mind
[20:09] battles. Hallelujah.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Because he already WAS FILLED WITH THE
[20:12] HOLY GHOST IN HIS THOUGHTS. YEAH.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; NOW, we get saved, brother Chris, you
[20:16] and I, Jose, we all get saved AND WE GOT
[20:18] TO STRUGGLE for a long time to get our
[20:20] thoughts right. Just get THEM RIGHT. BUT
[20:21] JOHN ALREADY had his thoughts right.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; That's why he's greater than all the
[20:26] other ones because he had it from the
[20:29] womb.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram just gives a a simple
[20:32] definition like this. Brother Ram says,
[20:34] "Sanctification sets our minds in order
[20:37] for holiness." Now, we all as brothers
[20:39] and sisters, we had to learn how to get
[20:41] our mind on holiness. John already had
[20:44] the anointing to do it.
[20:48] Brother Brandham also described
[20:50] sanctification as this. It sets the
[20:52] heart, the mind of the heart in order
[20:54] for holiness and it cleanses your mind.
[20:58] How many know you had a dirty mind
[20:59] before you got saved?
[21:01] &gt;&gt; John's was already clean.
[21:04] That made him greater than you and I.
[21:05] Well, that I'll say this. That made him
[21:07] greater than us in the spirit, but not
[21:09] the soul. Amen. Hallelujah. Which we're
[21:11] not saying we're greater. It just means
[21:12] we have more power. Kind of getting to
[21:15] my main point. It just means we have
[21:17] more privileges in the New Testament. It
[21:19] doesn't mean you're greater like you
[21:21] should brag. You're not. In other words,
[21:24] let let's put your works against John
[21:25] the Baptist works. Hallelujah.
[21:29] We probably don't want to do that
[21:30] because we'll be ashamed of ourselves.
[21:32] But if it causes something good to
[21:34] happen, then praise God. Amen. We'll get
[21:37] to that in just a moment.
[21:39] Brother Ram said, uh, when a man gets
[21:41] sanctified, it cleanses the desire out
[21:44] of him to want to get drunk and look
[21:46] after women.
[21:48] But John was born with the anointing. No
[21:51] desire to look at women, no desire to
[21:53] get drunk. That's what the Bible says.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Fill with the Holy Ghost in his mind
[21:59] from the womb.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; So, as John got older, all he thought
[22:02] about is love your parents. Uh, obey
[22:04] your parents. Obey God. Obey God. He
[22:06] wasn't think who can I date out there? I
[22:08] like to who's some beautiful little
[22:10] virgins in Israel. You know, he wasn't
[22:12] thinking about that.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; He wasn't thinking, oh man, that drunk
[22:15] it looks really fun to be drunk. He's
[22:17] just like, I'm I'm going to serve God.
[22:19] I'm going to be holy. My mind's on the
[22:21] things of God. I'm memorizing the word
[22:22] of God. I'm going to be faithful to God.
[22:24] He already had that filling. It was
[22:26] already his MIND WAS ALREADY FILLED WITH
[22:27] THE THINGS OF GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; And church, we struggle sometimes to
[22:31] fill our mind with things of God,
[22:33] &gt;&gt; but he had it. Hallelujah.
[22:39] He already had a clean mind. No desire
[22:41] for women, alcohol. He was anointed in
[22:44] his spirit.
[22:46] Hallelujah.
[22:48] Now church, regarding that wine, I want
[22:50] to say this. Remember the Bible said
[22:52] Jesus came drinking wine.
[22:55] Now, the word wine has different
[22:57] definitions here. Uh Albert Barnes
[23:00] believes the wine that they're talking
[23:02] about when Jesus drank wine uh he
[23:05] believes it wasn't at a very small
[23:07] alcoholic content and I've heard that
[23:10] before and that's what I've always
[23:11] believed too. Albert Barnes said as wine
[23:13] was a common article beverage among the
[23:15] people Jesus drank it. It was the pure
[23:18] juice of the grape and not anything that
[23:20] can be proved it was without
[23:23] fermentation.
[23:25] So that's what Albert Barnes says. The
[23:27] wine Jesus drank had no fermentation in
[23:29] it. It was just the juice of the grape.
[23:32] That's what he believed. So, I'm just
[23:34] trying to understand that by God's
[23:36] grace. Amen. But remember in Matthew 11,
[23:39] let's go back to Matthew 11.
[23:42] Here we see you can have John's approach
[23:44] to ministry versus Jesus's approach and
[23:47] God can have people on different
[23:48] approaches to ministry and both can be
[23:51] right.
[23:53] This might make some of you think a
[23:55] little bit here. Look at Matthew 11:16.
[23:58] But where and two shall I liken this
[24:00] generation? It's like unto children
[24:01] sitting in the markets and calling unto
[24:03] their fellows, saying, "We have piped
[24:05] unto you, and you have not danced."
[24:07] Okay, so there's the first ministry.
[24:08] Children piping, saying, "Dance,
[24:10] everybody dance. Everybody praise the
[24:12] Lord." That's one type of ministry Jesus
[24:14] said. And that was Jesus's ministry.
[24:17] Jesus' ministry was happy, rejoicing,
[24:20] people being healed, people being saved,
[24:22] people being delivered. It was
[24:23] rejoicing, miracles all the time.
[24:25] Hallelujah.
[24:27] But now the other ministry that God was
[24:30] also in was John's ministry. Verse 17.
[24:33] And we have mourned unto you and you
[24:35] have not lamented. So John the Baptist
[24:37] is saying it's time to mourn. IT'S TIME
[24:39] TO FAST. IT'S time to consecrate. Don't
[24:41] drink wine. It's time to humble
[24:42] ourselves before God. And both were
[24:44] equally right.
[24:47] So what does that tell you? There's
[24:48] going to be time. What the Bible say?
[24:49] There's a time to dance and a time to
[24:52] mourn.
[24:54] Everybody catch that? That's a little
[24:55] deeper.
[24:57] And what did Jesus say? For John came
[24:59] neither eating nor drinking, and they
[25:01] say he hath the devil. So the devil will
[25:03] criticize both types of ministry. Well,
[25:06] you think, well, maybe if I fast more,
[25:07] or maybe if I had more miracles, the
[25:09] devil, the devil wouldn't criticize me.
[25:11] Nonsense. HE'S GOING TO CRITICIZE EVERY
[25:13] CHILD OF GOD.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; You just got to overcome the criticism.
[25:17] Silence his criticism and just believe
[25:19] the word. Just dance if you're dancing
[25:21] and just mourn if God's called you to
[25:23] mourn and fast.
[25:27] Verse 19, the son of man came eating and
[25:30] drinking and they say, "Behold, a
[25:32] gluttonous and a wine bibber, a friend
[25:34] of publicans and sinners, but wisdom is
[25:37] justified of her children."
[25:40] Hallelujah. That means the the result of
[25:43] your decisions proves you're either wise
[25:45] or foolish. Hallelujah. So your fasting
[25:49] and praying will produce something and
[25:51] what it produces that's proof whether
[25:53] you did it right or wrong or you're
[25:55] rejoicing, you're dancing, you're
[25:57] praising God. The results of that, how
[25:59] you live after that will prove whether
[26:00] it was the right decision or the wrong
[26:02] decision.
[26:04] Amen.
[26:06] All right, so we're up to five points.
[26:08] Point six and seven, John won many souls
[26:12] to God. And seven, he had the spirit of
[26:15] Elijah. This what made him greater than
[26:18] other other men all men and women in the
[26:20] Old Testament. Luke 1:16. And many of
[26:23] the children of Israel shall he turn to
[26:25] the Lord their God. How many convers
[26:27] John have? Many.
[26:30] Many. How many do we have? Very few. At
[26:33] least that we know of. Look at that.
[26:36] Many. A lot. In other words, a lot of
[26:39] people got saved with no miracles.
[26:43] Hallelujah. Verse 17. And he should go
[26:46] before him in the spirit and power of
[26:47] Elias to turn the hearts of the
[26:49] children, I'm sorry, the fathers to the
[26:51] children and disobedient to the wisdom
[26:53] of the just to make ready a people
[26:56] prepared for the Lord.
[26:58] All right. So he won many souls. Brother
[27:01] Ram thought he won what? Two million
[27:02] souls, brother Jose. Two million.
[27:05] Hallelujah. Amen. That spirit of Elijah.
[27:08] Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:11] But brother Random had the spirit of
[27:12] Elijah just like John. John rebuked
[27:14] Herodiius just like Elijah rebuked
[27:17] Jezebel.
[27:18] John was a man in the wilderness just
[27:20] like Elijah spent time out in the
[27:22] wilderness. So did brother Brandham.
[27:24] Brother Brandham rebuked Marilyn Monroe,
[27:26] Jacleine Kennedy, all the immoral women.
[27:29] Now John spake in the name of the Lord
[27:31] because he said, "I am the voice of one
[27:32] crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the
[27:34] way of the Lord." He quoted the
[27:35] scripture and said, "I'm speaking the
[27:37] Lord's words." Hallelujah. And brother
[27:41] Rama of course spoke in the name of the
[27:42] Lord. Elijah spoke in the name of the
[27:45] Lord and it came to pass. And hallelujah
[27:49] uh John the Baptist turns the hearts of
[27:51] the fathers to the children. Amen. And
[27:54] the Bible said Elijah turned the hearts
[27:56] as well when he rebuilt the altar of
[27:59] worship. Hallelujah. He took the
[28:01] remember he took the 12 stones on Mount
[28:04] Carmel and he put them together and the
[28:05] Bible said he turned their hearts back
[28:07] to God.
[28:10] So there we go. Seven points. Here's
[28:12] number eight. He had a complete physical
[28:16] consecration.
[28:18] Luke 1 verse 80. And the child grew and
[28:21] waxed strong in spirit and was in the
[28:23] hotels.
[28:25] No. Did I read that right? He was in the
[28:28] deserts. Now, how many of you would like
[28:30] to go out to the desert and try to
[28:31] survive? Michelle, how old are you,
[28:33] buddy?
[28:34] &gt;&gt; 12. Okay, I think that's the age. Maybe
[28:36] it was nine. Maybe it was nine or 12.
[28:37] John the Baptist went on the wilderness
[28:39] about your age, nine or 12. I'm just
[28:42] going to go out and I'm going to just
[28:43] going to dwell in the wilderness. Good
[28:45] luck
[28:46] for me. Good luck for me. Good luck for
[28:48] you even as an adult. Go try to survive
[28:50] in the wilderness for a few days.
[28:53] And John did that. He was totally
[28:55] consecrated. He said, "I'm leaving the
[28:57] cities. I'm leaving the big the big time
[29:00] and the money. I'm leaving all this
[29:01] behind, the business. I'm leaving
[29:03] everything behind. I'm gonna go
[29:05] consecrate myself unto God out in the
[29:07] desert.
[29:09] Sound familiar? When Jesus got the Holy
[29:11] Ghost, what did he do? He went to the
[29:13] desert. John already had the Holy Ghost
[29:15] right here. Amen. Hallelujah. So, he
[29:18] knew God was calling him out to the
[29:20] desert.
[29:22] Now, notice because he was out in the
[29:24] desert, he stayed away from those
[29:25] denominations.
[29:27] Everybody see that? Hallelujah. And
[29:30] second, all the worldly ambition to make
[29:33] money and buy and sell, he was totally
[29:35] out of that. He didn't have everybody
[29:36] pressure him to be rich and be a
[29:38] millionaire.
[29:39] He was totally separated from that.
[29:43] And this prepared him to be in complete
[29:47] spiritual clarity. In other words,
[29:50] completely focus on his spiritual
[29:52] mission. Church.
[29:54] Hallelujah.
[29:56] So, he was phys physically consecrated
[29:58] to God. Now, remember, Moses went out in
[30:01] the desert, but what he got? He got
[30:02] himself a wife and a couple kids. Did
[30:05] John get a wife and a couple kids? No.
[30:08] Is there anything wrong with that? No.
[30:10] But the B Paul does say you're more uh
[30:13] focused or you're more uh disciplined or
[30:16] consecrated or dedicated to God's
[30:18] purpose if you're single. But it takes a
[30:20] gift to do that,
[30:22] &gt;&gt; right? Takes a gift. In other words,
[30:24] don't try to do it unless you got a gift
[30:25] to do it.
[30:27] That's right.
[30:30] Hallelujah.
[30:32] Now, let me say this because for all the
[30:34] people that skip church uh at like tape
[30:36] churches and stuff and even people that
[30:39] might do it here or other places, I
[30:40] don't know. I'm just saying
[30:44] being out of the wilderness was allowed
[30:46] in the Old Testament, but it's not today
[30:49] because the Bible says, "Gather more as
[30:52] you see that day approaching."
[30:54] Hallelujah. And the proof of that is
[30:55] Jesus was always in the synagogue on the
[30:58] Sabbath. Luke chapter 4, I think it's
[30:59] verse 16. And then Paul said in Hebrews
[31:02] 10, "Gather more as you see that day
[31:04] approaching." And John said, "They went
[31:06] out from us because they're not of us."
[31:09] Yeah,
[31:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying God can't call somebody
[31:12] out for a little con time of
[31:13] consecration, but the Holy Ghost will
[31:15] send them right back into the body of
[31:16] Christ because what what did brother
[31:18] Random want to do? Who remembers what
[31:19] brother Ram want to do in standing in
[31:21] the gap? He wanted to leave everybody
[31:22] and just go live up in Colorado and just
[31:24] stomp down from the mountain and say,
[31:25] "Thus say the Lord and then go back."
[31:27] And the Holy Ghost rebuked him for that.
[31:30] He said, "You're not an Old Testament
[31:32] prophet. You're a apostolic prophet.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; You're a New Testament prophet."
[31:37] Everybody got that? Yeah.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to be I'll say it like this.
[31:40] If you want to be a part of God's family
[31:41] in heaven, how many want to be a part of
[31:42] that?
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Then you got to be a part of God's
[31:44] family right here.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; You can't avoid the body and say, "I
[31:48] don't want to be around anybody in the
[31:49] church. I don't want to be in." That's
[31:50] the wrong That's an isolation spirit
[31:52] from the enemy. Hallelujah. He's trying
[31:55] to get That's like we see in our lives.
[31:56] We see people like my family members. I
[31:58] see them isolated. They won't go to
[32:00] church. And look at their lives. because
[32:01] their lives are a sad life of depression
[32:03] and and guilt and and shame and and
[32:06] unconfessed sin.
[32:08] See, they're sick, but they won't go to
[32:11] the hospital. Amen. Hallelujah. If
[32:13] you're sick, COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[32:14] I'M NOT TALKING PHYSICALLY. I'M TALKING
[32:16] SPIRITUALLY. PRAISE GOD.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; If you're sick, stay at home till you're
[32:19] well, unless you know God's going to do
[32:20] a miracle. Or else you're just going to
[32:22] spread it amongst the saints.
[32:23] Hallelujah.
[32:25] But you better have a revelation that
[32:26] God's gonna heal you and not spread it
[32:28] to everybody else. Because is that is
[32:31] that helping your brother and sister do
[32:32] good by getting them sick? Is that
[32:34] loving your brother and sister? No, it's
[32:37] not. So most people got a good
[32:39] understanding of that by God's grace.
[32:42] Point number nine is John only preached
[32:45] God's message.
[32:47] In Luke 3:2,
[32:50] Annus and Caiaphas being the high
[32:52] priest, the wordlord came unto John the
[32:56] son of Zacharias in the wilderness. And
[32:58] he came into all the country round about
[33:00] Jordan preaching the baptism of
[33:02] repentance for the remission of sins. So
[33:04] his sermon, brother Chris, every week
[33:06] was repent and God will send away your
[33:09] sins and be baptized.
[33:11] Amen. And then he'd say, there's
[33:13] somebody coming after me that's greater
[33:15] than me. Hallelujah. In other words, he
[33:18] wasn't saying, "Follow me. Make me rich.
[33:22] Uh, get me some seven uh 47 planes and
[33:25] so forth." That's not what he was
[33:27] saying. Build me a mansion. He wasn't
[33:28] saying that. Hallelujah. He was saying,
[33:30] "Repent and get ready. Someone's coming
[33:32] after me. I'm going to baptize you with
[33:34] water, but he's going to baptize you
[33:36] with the Holy Ghost and fire."
[33:41] Now, look at his ministry. Brother Ram
[33:42] said, "Look at the man's ministry."
[33:44] Verse five. Luke 3:5, "Every valley
[33:47] shall be filled, and every mountain and
[33:49] hill shall be brought low, and the
[33:51] crooked shall be made straight, and the
[33:53] rough ways shall be made smooth."
[33:56] Imagine that. John's preaching,
[33:59] hallelujah, brought every mountain down.
[34:03] In other words, every prideful person,
[34:05] his preaching brought them down. Every
[34:08] low person that's discouraged and had no
[34:10] hope, he raised them up so they could
[34:12] have hope.
[34:13] Hallelujah. So, see, that's what
[34:15] repentance does when you preach it. It
[34:17] raises up the lowly. Well, God will
[34:19] forgive me, right? It raises up the
[34:21] lowly, but it also brings down the
[34:23] humble and say, "You need to repent of
[34:24] your sins. You're not so righteous.
[34:27] There's none righteous. Know, not one."
[34:30] Hallelujah.
[34:34] I like what he said. I like what John
[34:36] says in six. And all flesh shall see the
[34:39] salvation of God. Amen. All flesh.
[34:42] That's really something. I don't quite
[34:44] understand that actually. Verse seven.
[34:47] Then said he to the multitude that came
[34:49] forth to be baptized of him. Oh
[34:51] generation of vipers, oh my precious
[34:54] congregation. Is that what he said? Oh
[34:56] my dear brothers and sisters, my little
[34:58] lambs. Is that what he said? So would
[35:01] you have went to John's church or not?
[35:05] Or you you would or would you have gone
[35:06] home and complained he was too rough of
[35:08] a preacher?
[35:10] Oh, now we can see. Now we can see which
[35:13] side we'd be on. How many want to be on
[35:15] God's side?
[35:16] &gt;&gt; If God leads the man to preach that
[35:19] there's a bunch of vipers around, then
[35:21] let's say amen to it. Let's make sure we
[35:23] don't have the viper in us. Hallelujah.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said to them all, he
[35:28] didn't say to a small group. He said it
[35:30] before everybody. You generation of
[35:32] vipers,
[35:34] who hath warned you to flee from the
[35:35] wrath to come? And what what's the wrath
[35:38] that was going to come? Titus was going
[35:39] to come about 40 years later.
[35:43] The wrath of God, he was going to pour
[35:44] out the wrath of God on Jerusalem for
[35:46] rejecting their own Messiah. And blood
[35:48] ran out of the temple. They killed so
[35:50] many people. It ran down and flowed like
[35:52] streams according to Josephus, not me,
[35:54] according to Josephus, a historian.
[35:59] Verse eight, bring forth therefore
[36:01] fruits worthy of repentance. And begin
[36:03] not to say within yourselves, we have
[36:05] Abraham to our father. For I say unto
[36:07] you that God is able of these stones to
[36:08] raise up children unto Abraham. And now
[36:11] the axe. Brother Ram said he always
[36:13] talked in the terms of a woodsman,
[36:15] snakes, axes, trees, roots. Amen. He
[36:19] didn't talk about uh Hebrew Jewish de
[36:22] I'm sorry, Hebrew definitions. He didn't
[36:24] talk about uh money and riches. He
[36:26] talked in the terms of nature because
[36:28] that's where he lived in nature.
[36:32] The axes laid to the root of every tree.
[36:34] See those high trees? They're going to
[36:35] be cut down. Everything high was going
[36:37] to be brought down.
[36:42] Every tree therefore which bringeth not
[36:43] forth good fruit is heuned down and cast
[36:45] into the fire the lost. And the people
[36:48] asked him, saying, "What shall we do
[36:50] then?" Now, here's what most of us need
[36:52] to do. Look at Luke 3:1. He answered and
[36:55] saith unto them, "He that hath two
[36:56] coats, let him impart to him that hath
[36:59] none." In other words, if somebody needs
[37:01] warmth, help them out.
[37:03] Notice he didn't say give them cash.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; You see these people begging, give them
[37:09] what they have need of. What do you
[37:10] need? Water, food. What do you need?
[37:12] Give them what they need. They're
[37:14] probably going to take cash and go buy
[37:16] some drugs with it.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; But give them what they need. They need
[37:21] If they're cold, give them a coat.
[37:22] Hallelujah. If they're thirsty, give
[37:23] them some water. Not pop, water.
[37:29] And he that hath meat, let him do
[37:31] likewise. So if someone's hungry, give
[37:33] them food.
[37:36] Look at verse 12. Now that's for the for
[37:38] the common man. Just this is how you
[37:41] show you repented. Help out people that
[37:43] are less fortunate than you.
[37:46] Now for the publican.
[37:48] Verse 12. And they came also the
[37:50] publicans to be baptized. So th those
[37:52] that were government officials and more
[37:54] uh have more power. Uh they said,
[37:56] "Master, what shall you do?" And he said
[37:58] to them, "Exact no more than which is
[38:00] appointed to you." In other words, don't
[38:01] steal money from people. Publicans were
[38:04] also tax collectors. In other words,
[38:06] you've got power over people's money,
[38:07] but don't take money that's not yours.
[38:09] Don't steal money. And the church said,
[38:13] "Don't abuse your power."
[38:15] Hallelujah.
[38:17] Verse 14, we went over this last year.
[38:20] Luke 4 3:14. And the soldiers likewise
[38:23] demanded of him, saying, "And what shall
[38:25] we do?" And he said to them, "Do
[38:27] violence to no man, neither accuse any
[38:28] falsely, and be content with your
[38:30] wages." So don't be violent. Don't lie,
[38:34] and be content with your money.
[38:37] Now, church, how many of us can do those
[38:39] things? If we can do those things, John
[38:41] said that's the fruit of being repented.
[38:46] Hallelujah.
[38:50] Praise God. Now remember church also he
[38:53] said be baptized. Now, most of us have
[38:55] been baptized here. If you haven't, pray
[38:56] about it. You should be baptized in the
[38:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you
[39:00] refuse it, like my uncle did, then you
[39:04] refuse the counsel of God because God's
[39:07] counsel is repent and be baptized.
[39:10] Luke 7:29, if you got your Bible, and
[39:12] all the people that heard him and
[39:14] publicans, they justified God, being
[39:16] baptized with the baptism of John. Verse
[39:19] 30. But the Pharisees and lawyers
[39:21] rejected the council of God against
[39:22] themselves, being not baptized of him. I
[39:25] always remember when John Graham showed
[39:26] this to me because it was very special.
[39:27] I was like, "Wow." Baptism is part of
[39:30] the council or the plan or the mind of
[39:32] God.
[39:34] To reject God's mind or counsel is to
[39:37] reject God.
[39:39] Hallelujah.
[39:41] So, everybody here should be rejoicing
[39:43] that you've been baptized.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; That's God's counsel.
[39:48] A 10th reason he was greater than other
[39:50] men is because he feared no man, not
[39:53] even Herod and his wife.
[39:55] In Luke 3:19 and 20, it said, "But Herod
[39:58] the tetrarch, being reproved by him for
[40:01] Herodiius, his brother Philip's wife,
[40:03] and for all the evils which Herod had
[40:05] done,
[40:07] added yet this above all, that he shut
[40:09] up John in prison."
[40:11] So John went to the most popular
[40:14] politician in the whole land and told
[40:17] him all the things he's done wrong. Now
[40:19] Chris, I've never done that. That'd be
[40:21] like me going to President Trump and
[40:24] saying, "You're an adulterer. You're you
[40:26] curse with your filthy mouth. You need
[40:28] to repent."
[40:30] All the things he's done wrong. That's
[40:32] what the spirit of Elijah did.
[40:34] Hallelujah.
[40:36] This made him greater than other men who
[40:38] didn't do that. He went to the greatest.
[40:40] He didn't compromise on one thing that
[40:42] he said. He preached the gospel.
[40:45] Hallelujah.
[40:47] Like in Matthew 14:4, brother Random
[40:50] always dramatized this. For John said
[40:52] unto Herod, "It is not lawful for thee
[40:54] to have her." Brother Man always
[40:56] dramatized this. When Herod came out to
[40:59] the wilderness to hear John preach, he's
[41:01] got camel skins on, Brother Chris. He's
[41:03] dressed in camel fur. He was eating
[41:06] grasshoppers and honey. He was a hairy
[41:09] man, right? He didn't shave. He was out
[41:11] in the wilderness. He was hairy just
[41:13] like Elijah was hairy. He looked He
[41:16] probably looked all dirty. He's just a
[41:17] wilderness man. And brother dramatized
[41:20] and he said when John was getting ready
[41:21] to go preach, his deacon came and said,
[41:23] "Oh, John, you better not preach against
[41:25] Herod and Herodiius being married twice
[41:28] because they're out in the congregation
[41:29] today." And John said, "I'll only preach
[41:31] what God tells me to preach."
[41:34] And brother said, "John walked out there
[41:37] and he went right under Hair's nose and
[41:39] SAID, "IT'S NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO BE
[41:41] MARRIED TO HERODIIUS. YOU'RE AN
[41:43] ADULTERER."
[41:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Think about
[41:48] that, church.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T AFRAID OF MAN. WHY? BECAUSE HE
[41:51] WAS MORE AFRAID OF GOD THAN HE WAS MAN.
[41:55] HALLELUJAH. That's why church, if I know
[41:58] some people are here, we get visitors
[42:00] and I know some sins in their life, if
[42:01] God puts it on my heart, I'm going to
[42:03] preach against that sin because it's
[42:05] their opportunity to get right with God.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; In the church age book, Brother Ram
[42:09] said, "John didn't mean to tear them
[42:11] down or hurt them. John by his love was
[42:14] trying to get them to repent
[42:16] &gt;&gt; because that's what love does. Love try
[42:18] love tries to get you to repent of your
[42:20] sins.
[42:21] Does that help by God's grace?
[42:24] &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commands."
[42:25] Right? So John is trying to get him to
[42:27] love God. Give or se in other words put
[42:30] Herodiius away and just live single.
[42:33] Don't take another woman. That's what
[42:34] John was basically trying to do. Think
[42:36] about that. He took his brother's wife.
[42:39] Think about your brother. You got
[42:40] brothers? I got brothers. Herod took his
[42:43] brother's wife. That's like Hunter
[42:46] Biden,
[42:47] right? Such sadness. such the such moral
[42:51] depravity
[42:53] taking your brother's wife and John
[42:56] didn't even he didn't even question he
[42:58] said it's NOT LAWFUL YOU NEED TO PUT HER
[43:00] AWAY AND HE DIDN'T STOP there brother
[43:02] Chris he went through all the evils that
[43:04] he ever did hallelujah amen it WAS A
[43:06] WHOLE SERMON REBUKING ONE man the leader
[43:10] the political leader of that day talk
[43:13] about a sermon
[43:15] exposing all of Trump's or Biden's
[43:17] wrongs or Obama's wrongs That's what the
[43:19] spirit of Elijah would do.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Well, what would the Holy Ghost do
[43:23] today? Hallelujah.
[43:28] So, John did not flatter people in
[43:31] power. He did not try to protect
[43:33] himself. He just tried to preach what
[43:35] God put on his heart. And he preached
[43:38] the truth where he even got arrested for
[43:40] it.
[43:42] Hallelujah.
[43:46] The 11th point. I'm almost to my 15. I'm
[43:48] I'm doing good on time. I've only been
[43:50] preaching 40 minutes. Hallelujah.
[43:52] The 11th part is there's no moral
[43:55] failures recorded outside of him
[43:58] doubting if Jesus was the Messiah.
[44:01] Think about that. The Bible doesn't
[44:03] record him making any sins. Now, we know
[44:06] he did, right? Because the Bible said
[44:08] all fall short of the glory of God.
[44:10] [snorts]
[44:11] But he lived so close to God that the
[44:14] Bible doesn't record any. Sound
[44:16] familiar? like Joseph. The Bible only
[44:18] records one sin Joseph did. He tried to
[44:21] get his brethren to lie or his dad uh
[44:23] and brethren say uh tell him you're not
[44:25] shepherds because shepherds are an
[44:27] abomination to the Egyptians. That's
[44:29] Genesis 46:34. Joseph was trying to get
[44:32] his brothers to lie.
[44:35] Sounds like the early patriarchs
[44:37] struggle with lying and the church said
[44:40] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Jacob was a
[44:43] deceiver,
[44:45] right?
[44:48] So John the Baptist has no moral
[44:51] failures recorded. Moses was a murderer
[44:55] and he he got angry and he was prideful
[44:57] and magnified himself.
[45:01] David was an adulterer, a murderer,
[45:04] prideful when he numbered the people.
[45:05] And remember he said he did many
[45:07] iniquities.
[45:08] Elijah, the only thing we know about
[45:10] Elijah, he also feared and doubted. He
[45:13] said, "Lord, take my life." Uh, he ran
[45:15] from Jezebel. Is that right? I'm pretty
[45:18] sure there's only that's the only bad
[45:19] part about Elijah that was ever
[45:20] recorded. Very similar, right? John the
[45:22] Baptist and Elijah. Very similar because
[45:24] they both had the spirit of Elijah.
[45:27] Abraham was prone to lie, deceive,
[45:30] right? Two kings. Joshua was also
[45:33] recorded in Joshua 7:7 only having doubt
[45:36] about God because he said, "God, why'd
[45:38] you allow us to come over and lose that
[45:40] AI? Maybe we just should have stayed on
[45:42] the other side, God." And God doesn't
[45:44] even address it. And God said, "Go get
[45:45] the sin out of the camp. Stop
[45:47] complaining to me." Hallelujah.
[45:51] My And we know Job, he had a lot of good
[45:54] things, but we preached on that last
[45:55] year. He also had a lot of sins.
[45:57] Hallelujah. He had great fear come upon
[45:59] him. He He justified himself more than
[46:02] God. He said, "I'm more righteous than
[46:04] God."
[46:07] But church, John never committed
[46:09] adultery. No violence is ever recorded.
[46:12] No deceit is ever recorded in John's
[46:16] life.
[46:18] Now listen, he rebuked all the sin and
[46:20] he was actually innocent from that sin.
[46:23] He rebuked adultery, right? He rebuked
[46:25] all these things, stealing money. He but
[46:27] he lived such a godly life. He was uh
[46:30] innocent of preaching against all those
[46:32] sins. And that's what we need preachers
[46:33] to do today, to be innocent of the sins
[46:36] they preach against. Hallelujah. That's
[46:38] what we want all the saints as well. We
[46:40] want the saints to be innocent from
[46:42] these grievous sins. In other words, we
[46:44] want a life that's sanctified. We want a
[46:46] character that's like the character of
[46:47] Christ.
[46:49] Hallelujah. Now, y'all getting tired of
[46:50] getting less amen, so that's okay.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; I'm getting there. I'm almost got my
[46:53] hour. Bear with me.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Point number 12. He also
[46:59] sacrificed good things in the areas of
[47:02] liberty of a believer.
[47:04] For example, he never married. Think
[47:06] about that. He never loved a woman.
[47:10] He never got to hold children, say,
[47:12] "This is my child or my grandchildren."
[47:15] He never got to do that. Never got to
[47:17] drink wine for communion, we'd say.
[47:22] But he was completely focused on his
[47:25] mission.
[47:27] The Bible said in 1 Corinthians 7
[47:30] regarding people that remain single, he
[47:32] said, "There's a difference between a
[47:33] wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman
[47:36] carth for the things of the Lord, that
[47:38] she may both be holy, both in body and
[47:41] in spirit. But she that's married careth
[47:43] for the things of the world, how she may
[47:45] please her husband. Verse 35. And this I
[47:47] speak for your own profit, not that I
[47:49] may cast a snare upon you, but for that
[47:52] which is calmly, and that ye may attend
[47:54] upon the Lord without distraction.
[47:58] So John never knew a woman. John never
[48:00] had children. So he could be without
[48:02] distraction in the wilderness waiting
[48:05] for God's time to start preaching
[48:07] repentance.
[48:11] And remember, brother Ram said,
[48:12] sometimes God will train a man 30 years
[48:14] for six months of ministry.
[48:18] 30 years. Hallelujah.
[48:22] Like I told you that story of the
[48:23] brother who waited uh since he heard the
[48:25] message, he waited about 40 years until
[48:27] his first wife died. he could marry
[48:29] because she she wasn't a message
[48:31] believer. Uh so he married her and he
[48:34] knew he was supposed to preach all those
[48:35] years. She passed away. Then he married
[48:38] a message believer and then he could
[48:39] preach. But he had to wait 40 years. He
[48:41] always knew he was called to preach
[48:42] after he got saved. But he was married
[48:44] to a woman who wasn't a believer. So he
[48:47] didn't even want to take a chance. So he
[48:49] waited 40 years. I said, "That's a real
[48:51] man of God who will wait upon the Lord."
[48:53] Now he's doing missionary work, winning
[48:55] souls. I thought it was a good testimony
[48:57] by God's grace. How do I know? Because
[48:59] he emailed me and told me. Hallelujah. I
[49:01] never talked to him, but I wish I could.
[49:04] All right, we're almost there. The 13th
[49:07] attribute about him that was different
[49:09] than all the men before him. He had true
[49:11] humility towards God. Moses exalted
[49:15] himself and said, "Do I need to fetch
[49:17] water out of the rock?" He couldn't
[49:19] bring any water out of the rock. He
[49:21] magnified himself.
[49:24] But what did John say in John 1:27?
[49:27] whose shoes latchet, I am not worthy to
[49:30] unloose. I am so humble. I am so little.
[49:35] I'm not even worthy to take off Jesus's
[49:37] feet. Now, that's humble church.
[49:40] Who takes off the shoes? The servant.
[49:42] He's saying, "I'm not even worthy. He's
[49:44] so holy. I'M NOT EVEN WORTHY TO TAKE OFF
[49:46] his shoes."
[49:48] Now, we think we're something great.
[49:50] We're not, church. We've all sinned and
[49:53] fallen short of the glory of God. See, I
[49:56] want you to take these attributes of
[49:57] John, some of them, and apply them to
[50:00] your life. But just remember, the cross
[50:03] makes things different for us.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to say, "I'm greater
[50:08] than John." Like, "I do more works than
[50:11] John." Do you? Let's Let's start taking
[50:12] this list here. Let's see. Let's see who
[50:15] does that. Who wins more souls? We'll
[50:16] start with that. Hallelujah.
[50:19] Who Who's been more consecrated to God
[50:21] and never had wine?
[50:23] uh who's not married that's served God
[50:26] faithfully all these years. Well, pretty
[50:27] soon we're going to find out John was a
[50:29] greater man in some ways than us.
[50:32] And I love brother love what John said.
[50:38] John 3:30
[50:40] John said he must increase and I must
[50:44] decrease. Church, are we wanting to or
[50:47] increase ourselves or decrease
[50:50] ourselves? Do we want people to know our
[50:53] name more or the name of Jesus more?
[50:56] Let's decrease. Hallelujah.
[50:59] That Jesus might [music] increase.
[51:04] Now, John had disciples. He had
[51:06] influence among his disciples. He had a
[51:08] national audience, right? The
[51:10] multitudes, all Israel went out to hear
[51:11] him. But he gave it all away. Willingly
[51:15] gave it away and wasn't resentful.
[51:18] He just said, "I've got a decrease.
[51:20] Jesus must increase.
[51:25] Brother man Ram said then Christ came on
[51:26] the scene. Then he said I must decrease
[51:28] and he must increase. John, I like that
[51:31] he didn't claim to be nothing. He said
[51:34] I'm not him.
[51:36] So friends, let's not claim to be
[51:38] anything. Let's claim to be just a
[51:40] humble servant of Jesus Christ.
[51:45] So I'll say it like this. The greatest
[51:47] ones don't think they're great.
[51:51] Hallelujah.
[51:53] The greatest ones give you less of
[51:56] themselves and point you more to Jesus
[51:58] Christ.
[52:00] The greatest among us are the servants.
[52:03] Jesus said, right? Like I walked up to a
[52:06] sister not long ago uh and she chose to
[52:10] wash dishes
[52:12] instead of go to fellowship. And I
[52:13] walked up to her. I said, "God bless
[52:14] you." I said I said, "You know what
[52:16] Jesus said?" She said, "What?" Jesus
[52:18] said, "The greatest among you will be
[52:20] the servants."
[52:22] Now, church, I'm not telling everybody
[52:23] to wash dishes. Uh, actually, yeah, help
[52:26] your parents wash dishes. Yes. But I'm
[52:28] saying she had a choice. She could have
[52:30] went to fellowship or she could have
[52:32] washed dishes at somebody else's house
[52:34] and she chose to wash dishes at somebody
[52:36] else's house.
[52:38] Some people even was doing some
[52:39] sweeping, too. Instead of
[52:41] fellowshipping, they went sweeping. I
[52:43] think I also told them the same thing.
[52:46] The greatest among you shall be your
[52:49] servants.
[52:51] So, Sister Anna, when you have to stay
[52:53] home and cook, God sees you.
[52:56] Amen. God sees you. It's not easy to be
[53:00] a servant. It's hard to be a servant.
[53:03] But that's what makes the real character
[53:05] of Christ.
[53:10] The great ones do not think they're
[53:12] great. The great ones realize I'm
[53:14] nothing. I must decrease. Christ must
[53:18] increase.
[53:20] The 14th point is that John was faithful
[53:23] even when he doubted. So notice he
[53:25] doubted. He said he said ask Jesus are
[53:27] is he the one that should come or do we
[53:30] look for another?
[53:32] Hallelujah. In other words, he wasn't
[53:34] saying well because I got arrested, I'm
[53:36] giving this up and I deny this and I'll
[53:38] never I'll never believe it. No, he said
[53:40] there's if this isn't him, it's got to
[53:42] be somebody.
[53:44] Hallelujah.
[53:45] So, even in your doubts, church, you
[53:47] want to make sure you still trust in
[53:49] God. You still love God. You're still
[53:51] asking God to fulfill his word. Even if
[53:54] you don't understand it, you're asking
[53:55] God, "God, fulfill your word. I don't
[53:57] understand it, but I believe it."
[54:01] &gt;&gt; And you remember what Brother Ram said?
[54:03] Brother Ram said, "John said the worst
[54:05] thing that he could say to Jesus." And
[54:08] then Jesus turned around and said the
[54:09] best thing that could be ever said about
[54:11] John. Amen. Amen, brother Jose.
[54:13] Hallelujah. SO JOHN, THIS IS HIS LOWEST
[54:16] SPOT. HE'S IN PRISON. And he says the
[54:18] worst thing he could say is Jesus really
[54:20] the Messiah or do we look for another?
[54:23] So Jesus doesn't rebuke him because
[54:24] Jesus knew he was in prison. I'll say it
[54:26] like this. Jesus knew he had the spirit
[54:28] of Elijah. What does the spirit of
[54:29] Elijah do? When you get in trouble,
[54:31] sometimes the anointing leaves you and
[54:33] you want to die or you run from your
[54:35] problems. The church said
[54:38] &gt;&gt; that's what the spirit of Elijah did. It
[54:39] left it left Elijah and he ran away from
[54:42] Jezebel.
[54:44] Jesus knew he's got the spirit of Elias
[54:46] on him and then it leaves him.
[54:49] Hallelujah.
[54:52] May God be merciful to us as well. When
[54:57] we have doubts, when we make mistakes,
[54:59] may God also give us compliments and
[55:02] look look past our faults and see our
[55:04] need. Hallelujah.
[55:08] But Ram said Jesus never condemned him.
[55:10] He know that he was anointed with the
[55:13] spirit of Elijah.
[55:15] Amen.
[55:19] Brother said, "So will it be at the end
[55:21] time. Everything's running according to
[55:24] schedule." Don't be offended in the
[55:25] message, just believe it.
[55:28] Today, the churches are offended to him.
[55:30] Isn't that the truth? They're offended
[55:32] at women not wearing makeup and not
[55:34] cutting their hair. They're offended at
[55:36] men that want to believe hell's not
[55:38] eternal and baptized in the name of
[55:39] Jesus Christ. They're offended at that.
[55:41] Don't be offended. Believe the word of
[55:44] God.
[55:47] He said, "The churches are all offended.
[55:48] The people are always offended. They're
[55:50] all flustered. They don't know what to
[55:52] think. mental telepathy. Something else.
[55:55] No, don't be offended at the message of
[55:58] the hour.
[56:02] Okay, the 15th and final one before I
[56:04] bring it down. I got one more section
[56:05] here. I got Okay, good. I'm only at 50
[56:08] minutes.
[56:12] This final point is that the main one
[56:14] main reason John was so great is because
[56:18] he was so much like Jesus.
[56:22] saints. Both of their births were
[56:24] foretold by angels.
[56:27] Both of them had a level of holiness
[56:29] from the time they were born.
[56:32] Hallelujah.
[56:34] Amen. John was so much like Jesus that
[56:38] they thought he was Jesus. Amen. Look,
[56:41] he didn't get married. You know, he was
[56:42] out in the wilderness all those years.
[56:44] He preached THE TRUTH. HE TOLD EVERYBODY
[56:46] WHAT WAS WRONG IN THEIR LIVES. ALL THE
[56:48] THINGS HEROD had done. He told them
[56:49] everything in his life.
[56:53] He was so much like Jesus in John
[56:54] chapter 1. They asked, "Who art thou?"
[56:59] That's a good question for us to ask.
[57:01] Who are you? Are you the bride?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Are you the wise virgin or are you the
[57:08] foolish virgin?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I want to be wise. Hallelujah.
[57:15] They asked John, "Who are you?" And he
[57:18] said he confessed and denied but
[57:19] confessed I'm not the Christ.
[57:23] HE WAS SO MUCH LIKE Jesus they thought
[57:25] he was. Same thing with brother Brandon.
[57:26] Brother Jose. Amen. HE WAS SO MUCH LIKE
[57:29] JESUS they thought he was Jesus. Some
[57:31] people still do to their own heresy and
[57:34] shame and disgrace and almost blasphemy.
[57:38] That'll be up to God.
[57:41] Who art thou? He said BUT I AM NOT THE
[57:42] CHRIST. AND THEY SAID WHAT THEN? ARE YOU
[57:44] ELIAS? He says I'm not. Are you the
[57:46] prophet? He said, "No."
[57:50] He said, "I am the voice of one crying
[57:53] in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[57:55] the Lord."
[57:58] Hallelujah.
[58:01] See, he was so much like Jesus. He only
[58:04] had one fault recorded. That was just
[58:06] doubting the promise of God. So humble.
[58:10] His birth was like him. His life was
[58:12] like him. They both started at 30 years,
[58:14] right? They both started at 30 years of
[58:17] ministry. There were so much. They both
[58:19] preach repentance. Jesus' first message
[58:21] was repent.
[58:26] But now let's get into this final part.
[58:28] But why are we greater? Well, I told you
[58:31] we're not greater in our works. We're
[58:33] just greater by spiritual blessing and
[58:36] by spiritual position.
[58:39] Hallelujah.
[58:41] Friends, John never saw the cross. You
[58:45] have
[58:48] John never preached the resurrected
[58:51] Christ, but we do.
[58:54] John never parttook of the new covenant,
[58:57] but you do. Hallelujah. Amen. John was
[59:01] great because he held nothing back. He
[59:04] gave all of his life to God.
[59:07] He only pointed to Christ. And when
[59:08] Christ came, he stepped aside willingly
[59:11] and gave up everything and said, "Behold
[59:13] the lamb of God." Church, he even
[59:15] pointed his disciples and said, "Now go
[59:17] follow him." In other words, don't
[59:19] follow me. In other words, I'm going to
[59:20] empty out the church. You go follow him.
[59:22] Now, how many preachers would do that? I
[59:25] would do it if I had to do it to get
[59:26] everybody in the rapture. It's easy. We
[59:28] already got a small church. We don't own
[59:30] anything. I mean, it' be less
[59:31] temptations for me, right? I don't have
[59:34] to pay rent anymore. It's not even our
[59:35] not our building. Same thing with John.
[59:38] He had nothing. He had he had no
[59:39] building. Amen. He had nothing uh uh no
[59:43] mortgage to pay. Nothing like that. No
[59:44] light bill, no nothing. The sun was his
[59:46] light. Hallelujah. The sun was his
[59:48] electricity.
[59:50] But he's willing to leave everything.
[59:52] Tell all his disciples, YOU GO FOLLOW
[59:53] JESUS. He was a great man. Now the word
[59:58] Jesus said, "He that's least in the
[1:00:00] kingdom is greater." Do you ever look up
[1:00:02] that word greater? It means greater,
[1:00:04] larger, elder, stronger.
[1:00:08] stronger.
[1:00:10] Well, John seems pretty strong. Raise
[1:00:11] your hand if you think John is pretty
[1:00:12] strong believer. He is. But the Bible
[1:00:15] said you're stronger. Where are you
[1:00:16] stronger at? In your soul. Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] John never had the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:23] Ghost in his soul. He only had it in his
[1:00:26] mind.
[1:00:27] So Jesus said, "You're greater. You're
[1:00:29] stronger." Isn't that what Jesus said in
[1:00:31] the book of Luke? He said, "When the
[1:00:32] Holy Ghost comes, you have power to be a
[1:00:35] witness." So we get more power. Let's
[1:00:37] say more power, can we? More power.
[1:00:39] That's what we got. We got more power in
[1:00:42] our soul. That's why you should rejoice.
[1:00:44] If you never murdered anybody, you
[1:00:46] should rejoice. The power of God
[1:00:47] protected you. If you never committed
[1:00:50] adultery, you should rejoice. God's
[1:00:52] power protected you. If you never
[1:00:55] magnified yourself in front of
[1:00:56] everybody, name called and and per
[1:00:59] performed some miracle and claim you got
[1:01:00] miracle power and even be able to do it.
[1:01:03] IF YOU NEVER EXALTED YOURSELF LIKE THAT,
[1:01:04] YOU OUGHT TO PRAISE GOD BECAUSE YOU'VE
[1:01:06] GOT MORE POWER.
[1:01:08] AMEN.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; If you've never lied about your husband
[1:01:12] or wife, you ought to praise God like
[1:01:14] Abraham. You've got more power.
[1:01:17] Hallelujah.
[1:01:21] Didn't the Bible say, "Greater is he
[1:01:23] that's in us than he that's in the
[1:01:26] world?"
[1:01:27] You've got a greater power to be a
[1:01:29] witness like they got after the day of
[1:01:32] Pentecost. On the day of Pentecost, I
[1:01:34] should probably say. And friends, let me
[1:01:36] say this too. This is hard to
[1:01:38] understand.
[1:01:41] But we have a greater conscience than
[1:01:43] even John the Baptist in the one area of
[1:01:46] what God has done with our sins.
[1:01:50] Hebrews chapter 10:2 For then would they
[1:01:53] not have ceased to be offered because
[1:01:55] that the worshippers once spurred should
[1:01:57] have no more conscience of sin but in
[1:02:00] those sacrifices there's remembrance
[1:02:02] again made of sins every year leave that
[1:02:04] verse three up there so even though John
[1:02:06] the Baptist had the Holy Ghost what what
[1:02:08] what happened he remembered I've still
[1:02:11] got a sin conscience
[1:02:13] now his his mind though was filled with
[1:02:15] the Holy Ghost so he quickly uh take the
[1:02:18] anointing and trust trust God. I'm the
[1:02:20] Lord thy God that heals all thy
[1:02:21] diseases, forgives all thine iniquities.
[1:02:25] But he still had a remembrance of his
[1:02:27] sins every year.
[1:02:30] Verse four, for it's not possible that
[1:02:33] the blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:02:34] away sins. Go down to verse 14. For by
[1:02:37] one offering he hath perfected forever
[1:02:40] them that are sanctified.
[1:02:42] Verse 16. This is the covenant I will
[1:02:44] make with them, and after those days,
[1:02:46] sayeth the Lord, I'll put my laws into
[1:02:48] their hearts, and in their minds will I
[1:02:50] write them, and their sins and
[1:02:52] iniquities will I remember no more. Now,
[1:02:55] where there is remission of these,
[1:02:57] there's no more offering for sin. Having
[1:03:00] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[1:03:02] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
[1:03:05] by a new and living way, which he hath
[1:03:07] consecrated for us through the veil,
[1:03:09] that is to say, his flesh, and having an
[1:03:12] high priest over the house of God, let
[1:03:14] us draw near with a true heart in full
[1:03:17] assurance of faith. Now, here it is.
[1:03:19] Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:03:21] what? Conscience. And our bodies washed
[1:03:24] with pure water. SOUNDS LIKE LAST WEEK'S
[1:03:26] SERMON. THE WATER AND THE BLOOD.
[1:03:28] HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:29] SO THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN WE CONFESS OUR
[1:03:31] SINS, we should have no more conscious
[1:03:33] of sins. I confess that God forgave me
[1:03:36] of that. Now I can go to God boldly and
[1:03:39] I can make my request known unto God.
[1:03:42] Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Amen. My prayer is that the word of God
[1:03:48] will speak to our hearts today. It'll
[1:03:50] help us to be more bold with our prayers
[1:03:54] because you have a greater power than
[1:03:57] the John the Baptist. I didn't say a
[1:03:58] greater list of works, which that's
[1:04:01] good. Works is a sign of your faith.
[1:04:05] You are saved by grace through faith.
[1:04:07] Ephesians 2 8:9 for verse 10. Because
[1:04:10] God hath created you and ordained works
[1:04:13] that you should walk therein.
[1:04:15] You should have works in your life.
[1:04:18] But we're not saved by works. Neither
[1:04:21] was John saved by works.
[1:04:26] All right.
[1:04:28] So John preached repentance. He
[1:04:30] announced the Messiah, but he did not
[1:04:32] live to see the atonement completed. He
[1:04:35] talked about the lamb of God taking away
[1:04:37] the sins, but his sins were not yet
[1:04:38] taken away. Oh, we can talk about the
[1:04:41] lamb of GOD TODAY, BUT OUR SINS ARE
[1:04:43] TAKEN AWAY.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Thank God for those amens. Hallelujah.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:04:50] John was always pointing, oh, that
[1:04:51] someday your sins are going to be taken
[1:04:53] away. BUT WE CAN SAY THEY ARE TAKEN
[1:04:55] AWAY.
[1:04:57] NOT SOMETHING TO COME. YOUR SINS ARE
[1:04:59] TAKEN away today.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus say it's Did he say it was
[1:05:03] halfway finished or did he say it is
[1:05:07] finished? It's halfway PAID FOR. NO, IT
[1:05:10] IS PAID IN FULL. HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:14] THEREFORE, your conscience should be
[1:05:16] clear when you confess your sins because
[1:05:18] the Old Testament could not have that
[1:05:20] guilt that uh guiltless conscience. But
[1:05:23] we should have a mindset that the blood
[1:05:25] of Jesus Christ has washed me clean.
[1:05:30] All right, there's my hour.
[1:05:33] Let's finish this.
[1:05:35] So the first thing,
[1:05:38] we live on the other side of Calvary in
[1:05:41] the new covenant. John did not. He lived
[1:05:44] under the old covenant. Second, we are
[1:05:46] we're born again by the Holy Ghost in
[1:05:48] the soul. Peter 1:23. 1 Peter 1:23.
[1:05:55] Third, our Holy Ghost is permanent in
[1:05:58] dwelling.
[1:05:59] Ephesians 4:30, grieve not the Holy
[1:06:02] Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed
[1:06:03] unto the next revival until 2027.
[1:06:07] Then you got to get it again, unto the
[1:06:10] day of redemption.
[1:06:12] So, he didn't have that. We have that a
[1:06:14] permanent sealing in our soul. Fourth,
[1:06:17] we have a full revelation of Christ's
[1:06:19] identity and work. John didn't. We know
[1:06:21] who the church is, Gentile and Jew. We
[1:06:24] know the new covenant, justification by
[1:06:27] faith, and we have the resurrection
[1:06:29] accomplished.
[1:06:30] The Bible said in Ephesians 1, "Having
[1:06:33] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:06:36] will." I just keep getting louder and
[1:06:38] you guys keep getting quieter. So, help
[1:06:40] help me not to get so loud. I'm just
[1:06:41] trying to get excited here by God's
[1:06:43] grace. This is beautiful. We know the
[1:06:45] MYSTERY OF HIS WILL AND JOHN DID IT.
[1:06:47] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He was seeing lambs and goats and
[1:06:50] he well Jesus is the lamb of God. But he
[1:06:53] didn't see it like we see it now
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; where all those animals were all meant
[1:06:58] for one thing to show us one lamb is
[1:07:00] going to do more work than all those
[1:07:02] other lambs and goats and bulls put
[1:07:04] together.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, and then God DOESN'T REMEMBER YOUR
[1:07:08] SINS ANYMORE. HALLELUJAH. OH, thank you,
[1:07:11] Jesus. Colossians 1:26, the mystery
[1:07:14] which been hid from ages and
[1:07:16] generations, but now is made manifest TO
[1:07:18] HIS SAINTS. CHRIST in you,
[1:07:21] the hope of glory. So John had the
[1:07:23] anointing, BUT DIDN'T HAVE CHRIST in his
[1:07:25] soul.
[1:07:28] And what's the soul? It's the very
[1:07:30] nature of your being.
[1:07:32] So you are privileged and blessed to
[1:07:34] have a nature
[1:07:37] that is the word of God.
[1:07:41] Number five, you have direct a direct
[1:07:43] access to God. When Jesus died, what was
[1:07:45] the veil? It was torn, which shows now
[1:07:48] everybody can go into the holiest of
[1:07:50] holies.
[1:07:52] That's what we read in Hebrews 10.
[1:07:53] Having boldness to go behind the
[1:07:55] heavenly veil. AMEN. JOHN DIDN'T HAVE
[1:07:58] THAT, CHURCH.
[1:08:00] Number six, now you're adopted. And in
[1:08:03] Galatians 4, you're no more a servant.
[1:08:05] You're a son or daughter.
[1:08:09] You are adopted into the family. You got
[1:08:12] six privileges John didn't have, church.
[1:08:14] And not to make us ha or not to make us
[1:08:16] prideful, but to make us humble.
[1:08:20] Number seven, you are seated in heavenly
[1:08:22] places. John was not.
[1:08:25] Ephesians 2 has raised us up together
[1:08:27] and made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:08:29] places in Christ Jesus. John was
[1:08:32] pointing he's here. He's here. But you
[1:08:34] and I are in him.
[1:08:36] Now, that's quite a mystery, Beatatric.
[1:08:38] Amen. I don't understand it. But in
[1:08:40] other words, his spirit's in in in me,
[1:08:42] and my spirit was in him in the
[1:08:44] beginning. Praise God.
[1:08:47] Hallelujah.
[1:08:50] Eth,
[1:08:53] the kingdom
[1:08:55] is not just coming. The Bible said they
[1:08:57] preach in Matthew 3:2, "THE KINGDOM OF
[1:09:00] GOD IS AT HAND." BUT what did Jesus say
[1:09:02] in Luke 17:21? The kingdom of God is
[1:09:06] within you.
[1:09:11] So friends, we're not saying we're
[1:09:12] better than John. We're uh Jesus is not
[1:09:16] saying we're holier, we're more
[1:09:18] disciplined, we have more works, we're
[1:09:19] more faithful. He's only saying we're
[1:09:22] more privileged
[1:09:24] because we have a better covenant with
[1:09:26] what? Better promises. We're only
[1:09:30] greater because we have stronger
[1:09:32] promises.
[1:09:34] But what did Paul say? I don't brag on
[1:09:36] anything. He said, 'I actually brag when
[1:09:38] I'm weak because then I'm strong. I brag
[1:09:41] on Christ. I don't brag on myself.
[1:09:44] Christ makes me humble so he can show
[1:09:46] his strength in me.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For when I'm weak, then I'm
[1:09:52] strong.
[1:09:56] So John was the greatest man in the Old
[1:09:58] Testament because he stood at the door
[1:10:00] of redemption. HE WAS RIGHT AT THE DOOR.
[1:10:02] But church, the least believer in the
[1:10:04] New Testament is greater because he
[1:10:06] steps inside the door. So John was out
[1:10:09] here. Who's greater? Somebody that's
[1:10:10] outside or somebody that's inside.
[1:10:13] Who's greater? The one who is inside.
[1:10:16] They have more access to everything.
[1:10:19] John was at the door saying, "This is
[1:10:21] here. It's here. It's here. It's here."
[1:10:22] But now we get to go inside. That's what
[1:10:25] makes us stronger. We have stronger
[1:10:26] access. We have stronger promises. We
[1:10:29] have the Holy Ghost down in our souls.
[1:10:33] So John announced the lamb. You trust in
[1:10:36] the lamb with the lamb inside his spirit
[1:10:38] inside of you. Amen. The spirit was on
[1:10:41] John, but the spirit is in your soul.
[1:10:44] The kingdom was at ha at at hand with
[1:10:46] John, but the kingdom's in you with
[1:10:48] Christ.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; John pointed and held Christ, but you're
[1:10:51] united to Christ. Hallelujah. With the
[1:10:54] invisible union of the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:57] John was an Old Testament servant, but
[1:10:59] you're a New Testament son or daughter
[1:11:01] of God.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And church, I found one kind of proof of
[1:11:04] this as well. When John was in prison,
[1:11:06] he doubted. But look at Paul and Silas
[1:11:08] when they were in prison.
[1:11:10] Now, they might have doubted for a
[1:11:12] little bit, but what happened? They
[1:11:13] started saying, "I'm one of them.
[1:11:17] I'm one of them.
[1:11:20] I'm so glad that I can say one
[1:11:23] [applause] of them."
[1:11:25] And then all of a sudden the the
[1:11:26] earthquake started shaking and THE WHOLE
[1:11:28] JAIL WAS BROKEN UP AND THEIR CHAINS were
[1:11:30] broke AND THEY WERE SET FREE. THEY
[1:11:33] DIDN'T DOUBT JESUS. THEY BELIEVE. THEY
[1:11:34] WORSHIP JESUS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; That's one clue. And remember what what
[1:11:40] did Jeremiah do when he was thrown down
[1:11:41] in the pit? He said, "I'll never preach
[1:11:43] for you again." That's not what Paul and
[1:11:45] Silas did. That's not what James did.
[1:11:47] James was put in prison and beheaded. He
[1:11:50] didn't say, "I'll never preach again."
[1:11:51] He just faithfully took the destiny that
[1:11:55] God had for him, the testimony that God
[1:11:56] had for him.
[1:11:58] Hallelujah.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Now, church, I've said this before. If I
[1:12:02] was thrown in jail, I would just tr
[1:12:04] trust and hope that I would have the
[1:12:05] testimony like Paul and Silas. But let
[1:12:08] me tell you this. Even the Jews that got
[1:12:10] uh remember October 7th when Hamas
[1:12:12] invaded Israel, there's men and women
[1:12:15] that just were released within the last
[1:12:17] few months. So almost two years they
[1:12:18] were in captivity and they still held to
[1:12:21] their Jewish faith although they got
[1:12:23] starved and looked like skeletons.
[1:12:26] Even they didn't give up their faith.
[1:12:28] Now they might they might they might
[1:12:29] have doubted. I don't know if they doubt
[1:12:30] or not but I'm just saying their faith
[1:12:32] stood for almost two years of being
[1:12:34] starved and beaten in p prison. Their
[1:12:37] faith to the test. So church our faith
[1:12:39] will stand the test as well. Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Now John never recanted or anything like
[1:12:44] that but I'm just showing you here's a
[1:12:46] clear difference.
[1:12:47] Paul and Silas,
[1:12:49] they don't doubt Jesus. They just praise
[1:12:52] Jesus. And then again, God doesn't get
[1:12:54] everybody out of prison, right? Some
[1:12:57] people have to die in prison. Some
[1:12:58] people give their testimony with their
[1:13:00] life. But it's just one clear example
[1:13:03] how they had a greater power than John
[1:13:06] the Baptist had. But remember, John had
[1:13:07] the spirit of Elijah where when he was
[1:13:09] in trouble, the spirit would leave him.
[1:13:12] Does everybody understand that?
[1:13:14] Hallelujah.
[1:13:16] There's greater power. How many thankful
[1:13:18] for the power of the Holy Ghost today?
[1:13:20] Let's stand to our feet. The musicians
[1:13:22] can come now with that power. How about
[1:13:24] our girls going back to school tomorrow?
[1:13:27] How about our young men and women going
[1:13:29] you guys going back to school tomorrow,
[1:13:30] too? Okay. How about that? John had to
[1:13:33] go into a prison. Now, you might you
[1:13:35] might say you have to go into the prison
[1:13:36] of the middle school or the high school.
[1:13:39] It might feel like that sometimes,
[1:13:43] but let's remember that John had an
[1:13:46] amazing testimony. No man was greater in
[1:13:49] the Old Testament, but he is less than
[1:13:52] all of us by promise.
[1:13:55] We have greater promises than John. And
[1:13:59] church, we can live a life with our sins
[1:14:02] confessed and there's no guilty
[1:14:04] conscience.
[1:14:06] How many accept the word of God today?
[1:14:08] Has
[1:14:10] that been clear to you church today?
[1:14:12] That really blessed my heart.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; I felt that was from the Lord to give us
[1:14:18] a better understanding. I didn't even
[1:14:20] get to where I wanted to go. Brother uh
[1:14:22] Jose, you probably know this.
[1:14:28] And I'll maybe I'll preach a sermon
[1:14:29] about this uh maybe Wednesday.
[1:14:33] Jesus said in Matthew 17:12, "But I say
[1:14:36] unto you, Elias has come already, and
[1:14:39] they knew him not."
[1:14:41] And brother Ram said, "God was so humble
[1:14:44] with John the Baptist that even Jesus's
[1:14:47] own disciples didn't even recognize the
[1:14:49] prophet of God." And brother Ram said,
[1:14:52] "That's what the rapture is going to be
[1:14:54] like."
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So church, we better have our eyes open
[1:14:58] to the word of God.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. That strikes me. I hope that
[1:15:04] strikes you. Jesus own disciples are
[1:15:06] saying, "Who is John? Who is John?"
[1:15:08] Jesus has to let him know after he's
[1:15:09] already come and gone. He already came
[1:15:11] and gone. They're like, "Well, who was
[1:15:13] he? We don't even you don't know."
[1:15:16] And that's how the rapture will be.
[1:15:19] God, help us to be ready. Hallelujah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; If he comes in 2026, how many want to be
[1:15:24] ready?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Let's have a word of prayer. Father God,
[1:15:27] we're thankful for today. Thank you for
[1:15:28] such a attentive church, Lord God. Bless
[1:15:30] them, Lord.
[1:15:32] Thank you for their attention to the
[1:15:35] word of God. Faith comes by hearing.
[1:15:36] Hearing by the word of God. [music]
[1:15:38] They've heard the word. Now let faith
[1:15:39] anchor into their heart just like it is
[1:15:41] in my heart. I want to be ready, Jesus.
[1:15:43] [music] I want to be ready. In one way,
[1:15:45] I'll never be as great as John because
[1:15:47] I'm already married. I got children. I
[1:15:50] drink wine at communion. In one way,
[1:15:52] I'll never be as consecrated. [music]
[1:15:54] But another way, Lord God, all of us are
[1:15:56] considered greater because of the blood
[1:15:58] of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:01] Hallelujah. For us, there should be no
[1:16:03] remembrance of sin year after year
[1:16:05] because we have the lamb of God who took
[1:16:07] away the sins of the world. Hallelujah,
[1:16:10] Jesus. Hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:16:14] And John said, "Behold, there's the
[1:16:16] lamb. He'll take it away." And Lord, we
[1:16:19] are here saying today, the lamb has
[1:16:21] taken away our sins. Therefore, we won't
[1:16:23] walk in a guilty mindset. [music]
[1:16:25] We won't walk in a shameful conscience
[1:16:28] because we know the blood of Christ is
[1:16:30] greater than the blood of bulls and
[1:16:32] goats. Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:39] Lord, you proved it on the thief on the
[1:16:41] cross. In his last words,
[1:16:44] he said, "This man deserves nothing.
[1:16:46] Remember me when you come into your
[1:16:48] kingdom." And Jesus said, "Today you'll
[1:16:50] be with me in paradise." He proved it
[1:16:52] there that the blood of Jesus Christ can
[1:16:54] wash away a lifetime of sin in a very
[1:16:56] moment. Hallelujah. Not even rebuke him
[1:16:59] for it, but it just washes away.
[1:17:02] Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Oh Lord Jesus, let every sin stain of
[1:17:06] ours be washed away [music] by the
[1:17:09] precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:12] What a man. John was the greatest, but
[1:17:15] also the least
[1:17:18] compared to the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:20] Oh God, may this church live in heavenly
[1:17:23] places. May we set the Lord always
[1:17:26] before our face today. [music] Lord God,
[1:17:29] may we not just talk about it, hear
[1:17:32] about it. May [music] we do it. Lord, I
[1:17:34] set you before the congregation today. I
[1:17:37] set you before my [music] actions today.
[1:17:44] Lord Jesus, [music] we love you. God, if
[1:17:47] there's any sin in any heart, Lord, I
[1:17:49] pray they'll confess it just now, Lord.
[1:17:50] They don't even have to tell me.
[1:17:53] But Lord, because
[1:17:55] they we don't need a confessional box,
[1:17:57] Lord God. We don't need a human high
[1:18:00] priest. We have heaven's high priest.
[1:18:02] Hallelujah. [music]
[1:18:04] We have one mediator between God and
[1:18:06] man, the man Christ Jesus.
[1:18:09] [snorts]
[1:18:13] So, Father God, we thank [music] you,
[1:18:14] Lord God, for today. We thank you for
[1:18:17] the words of life, Lord God.
[1:18:20] Remind us, Lord, even when we might be
[1:18:22] at our worst, you'll still say the
[1:18:24] [music] best about us.
[1:18:27] You'll still say that Gentile bride,
[1:18:29] she's my beloved. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:18:33] God.
[1:18:35] Nobody can lay any charges to my bride.
[1:18:37] There's no condemnation to them that are
[1:18:39] in Christ Jesus [music] that walk not
[1:18:41] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:18:44] What a promise, Lord God. [music]
[1:18:46] And nothing shall separate us from the
[1:18:49] love of God which is in [music] Christ
[1:18:51] Jesus. Bless us today, Lord. May these
[1:18:53] young people and children as they go to
[1:18:55] school tomorrow,
[1:18:58] may they go there knowing they have a
[1:18:59] greater power than John. They don't have
[1:19:01] to doubt Jesus Christ. They don't have
[1:19:03] to doubt the message of the hour from
[1:19:04] the Bible. They don't have to doubt it.
[1:19:07] They can trust on it. They can believe
[1:19:08] it. May [music] they put you before
[1:19:10] their faces tomorrow as they go back to
[1:19:14] school and myself including on Tuesday.
[1:19:19] May they remember the scripture, I can
[1:19:21] do all things through Christ who
[1:19:23] strengthens [music] me.
[1:19:26] Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] I believe sister Beatatric [music] going
[1:19:30] back to work
[1:19:32] this coming week here myself. Lord God,
[1:19:37] Malachi, different ones going back to
[1:19:39] work. [music] Lord, I just pray in Jesus
[1:19:41] Christ's name they'd put you before
[1:19:43] them. Hallelujah.
[1:19:45] They remember these precious [music]
[1:19:46] promises, better promises, better
[1:19:49] commands. Lord God, mercy and grace and
[1:19:52] truth. [music]
[1:19:52] Jesus was full of grace and truth.
[1:19:56] And Lord, we're predestined to be
[1:19:58] conformed [music] to the very image of
[1:20:01] Jesus Christ, the character image of
[1:20:04] Jesus [music] Christ.
[1:20:06] Thank you for this word. I felt like it
[1:20:08] opened up to me yesterday and today as I
[1:20:11] listened to God hiding himself in
[1:20:12] simplicity [music]
[1:20:13] there with haven in the case of the car.
[1:20:15] Lord God, thank you Lord God. Help us
[1:20:19] Jesus [music] Lord to believe what we've
[1:20:21] heard today. apply it to our lives in
[1:20:24] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; [music]
