[32:52] to Ephesians chapter 3 verse 8 so just
[32:54] three that one scripture as a text
[32:59] fusions 3 verse 8 I want to preach on
[33:02] part 9 of the book
[33:04] Ephesians I'll just want to have a
[33:05] subtopic the unsearchable riches of
[33:07] Christ I want to preach on that visions
[33:10] 3:8 by God's grace as you're turning
[33:18] there just want to greet everybody in
[33:19] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ god
[33:21] bless everybody I don't know if you saw
[33:23] the email but I send an email this week
[33:24] and one thing I just put in there was
[33:26] just pray for guests ministering I've
[33:28] invited brother Darrell Ward brother Joe
[33:31] Adams
[33:31] Jim schumake and brother Ben deraad I've
[33:34] invited all those and now we're just
[33:36] kind of waiting on the timing of these
[33:38] things so I'm not sure when they'll come
[33:40] but they have an invitation for me I
[33:42] would really like them to come I feel
[33:44] that a lord to invite them so just keep
[33:46] those in prayer if you would by the
[33:48] grace of the Lord and we have brother

[33:55] 5th by the grace of the Lord and thank
[33:59] you for your prayers praise God visions
[34:02] 3 verse 8 now we'll be building to this
[34:09] point this is where I want to get to
[34:11] verse 8 so we'll be building to this
[34:13] point in Ephesians here Wednesday night
[34:18] we spent a lot of time on access to God
[34:20] hopefully got a chance to listen to that
[34:22] that really was a blessing and we we
[34:25] actually used those scriptures this
[34:26] morning in prayer so very thankful for
[34:29] that
[34:29] seasons 3:8 that's all I'm sorry
[34:33] yes visions 3:8 I'm in chapter 2 that's
[34:36] my problem okay let's read Ephesians 3:8
[34:38] let's begin on three one two three unto
[34:42] me Who am less than the least of All
[34:45] Saints is this grace given that I should
[34:48] preach among the Gentiles the
[34:51] unsearchable riches of Christ may God as
[34:54] blessings the ring of his word you may
[34:56] be seated
[35:04] I don't know you can switch over buddy
[35:07] brother bang told me it might be a
[35:10] different setting but try the first one
[35:12] and off the look on the text let's look
[35:23] at this stock here I like to look at the
[35:24] unsearchable riches of Christ but I want
[35:26] to as I was preparing yesterday I just
[35:28] thought we would build to that I changed
[35:31] my text to I thought as I studied this
[35:33] morning I felt kind of led to go to that
[35:35] unsearchable riches of Christ I did
[35:36] change my text a little bit so remember
[35:40] we'll just briefly just review just a
[35:43] minute there's three themes and
[35:44] Ephesians as you study it it's the
[35:46] believers exalted position in Christ in
[35:50] chapter 1 all the way to chapter 2 verse
[35:52] 10 where it says you're saved by grace
[35:54] through faith and you are God's
[35:56] workmanship Amen I'm glad to be a part
[35:59] of God's workmanship amen
[36:00] and then the second theme is the one
[36:03] body of Christ both Jew and Gentile
[36:04] that's what we're on right now we'll be
[36:07] on this Lord willing for a little while
[36:09] here maybe by God's grace and then the
[36:12] third theme is the walk and warfare of
[36:14] the believer chapter 4 to the end of 624
[36:18] and also as I told everybody on
[36:21] Wednesday you know I've been studying on
[36:22] the Philadelphia Church age but I just
[36:24] kind of felt more inspiration right here
[36:25] in the book of Ephesians so just trying
[36:29] to follow the leading of the Lord now I
[36:32] want to look at this thought again in
[36:33] chapter 2 so if you have your Bibles
[36:35] Ephesians 2:19 I just want to review
[36:38] this little thought on how we're built
[36:39] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[36:42] prophets this time I'm going to the
[36:51] church age book on Wednesday I showed
[36:53] what the Prophet taught in the actual
[36:55] sermon itself from the Philadelphia and
[36:58] church age because there's a little bit
[37:00] of overlap here in the Philadelphia
[37:02] Church age I haven't started that yet
[37:03] but the Prophet brings up Ephesians 2:19
[37:07] through 22 and so I thought well we'll
[37:10] just lay that in there it works out
[37:11] pretty good because we're getting ready
[37:13] to go into that here's what the Prophet
[37:16] teaches in the church age book
[37:18] not only giving crowns but he says that
[37:20] these in the bride will be made pillars
[37:24] in the temple of God but what is the
[37:27] temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as
[37:29] being the temple it was it was the
[37:32] temple of God but now that we are his
[37:34] body the true church is the temple of
[37:37] God by the Holy Ghost within us now he's
[37:41] going to make the overcomer a pillar in
[37:43] that temple but what is a pillar a
[37:46] pillar is actually a part of the
[37:49] foundation for it holds up the
[37:52] superstructure
[37:53] he said praise God that puts the
[37:56] overcomer right where in with the
[37:59] apostles and prophets then he quotes
[38:01] what we just read as part of our text so
[38:03] that's why I couldn't help but add this
[38:05] part I couldn't help but jump ahead in
[38:07] the Philadelphia Church age and bring
[38:09] this to where we are an emphasis which I
[38:11] think is a nice confirmation of where we
[38:13] are because we read our text this
[38:15] morning and we are no longer strangers
[38:19] of foreigners were fellow citizens and
[38:21] we're build upon the foundation of the
[38:24] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[38:26] Himself being the chief Cornerstone and
[38:28] I want to just take a moment look at
[38:30] this in whom ye also are builded
[38:34] together for a habitation of the holy
[38:36] spirit so recall again that you know we
[38:41] are the dwelling place of the holy
[38:43] spirit we when we gather we should see
[38:48] the Holy Spirit all a spirit dwells and
[38:54] here brother Branham and he continues in
[38:57] the church age book and verse 22 were
[38:59] builded together with them I love this
[39:01] everything went through the door Jesus
[39:03] and as part of that body or temple now
[39:09] when God puts a man in the temple as a
[39:10] pillar and makes him a part of that
[39:12] foundation group what is he doing he's
[39:15] giving him the revelation of the word
[39:18] and of himself because that is exactly
[39:21] what the apostles and prophets had and
[39:24] he quotes Peter where Peter said he had
[39:26] the revelation that Jesus was the Christ
[39:29] there he is and that word
[39:31] there he stands and I like this no one
[39:33] can get him out
[39:34] amen when you are a part when you're an
[39:37] overcomer you become a pillar in the
[39:39] temple of God you're a part of the
[39:41] foundation you're a part of the prophets
[39:44] you're a part of the apostles you are a
[39:47] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[39:50] Alleluia
[39:51] but we know that we've got to grow as a
[39:54] church and as believers we've got to be
[39:57] growing back to the original Pentecostal
[40:00] faith we and that's where we've got to
[40:02] go and the Prophet said this he said
[40:05] let's come back come back to the altar
[40:08] rebuild the altar again that's been torn
[40:10] down and build up your home so see your
[40:13] home should becoming more of an altar
[40:15] and the church said not less of an altar
[40:21] but our home should be building into
[40:23] more of an altar my prayer this morning
[40:26] my prayer closet was God help my prayers
[40:28] to be more sincere in my closet than
[40:30] they are at church but you understand
[40:32] and they should be sincere both places
[40:34] but let in other words let there be such
[40:36] a reality of Jesus Christ in my home
[40:39] that when I go to church it's just a
[40:41] continuation of the this presence I feel
[40:43] at home does ever understand that and
[40:45] then he says oh that's okay he said take
[40:48] the cards off the table now we got to
[40:50] take the cards off our phones and the
[40:53] church said and the old love story
[40:55] magazines and open up the Bible read the
[40:58] Bible and pray and don't just get down
[41:02] and say bless my family Mary Joe John
[41:04] and all heaven go to bed no sir stay
[41:07] there with God no recently I had a
[41:11] friend tell me that you know he had
[41:15] really had a lot of confidence in when
[41:17] is one of his friends as being a real
[41:19] Holy Ghost film message believer he said
[41:21] one day he come downstairs and he's seen
[41:23] his friend there on a Sunday morning and
[41:26] the friend was playing cards on his
[41:28] phone and he was saying how burden him
[41:32] and he he felt he should have said
[41:33] something to correct his friend there
[41:35] and he was going to make some major
[41:37] decisions in the life coming up you know
[41:38] with marriage and family all these
[41:40] things and he said he wished he would
[41:42] have corrected him on those things but
[41:43] he didn't
[41:45] he said he felt he missed the leadership
[41:46] of the holy spirit and it turned out
[41:49] this person made these major decisions
[41:51] and has now left the message and this
[41:54] person was telling me he said I missed
[41:55] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[41:57] because the Holy Spirit will take all
[42:00] the worldliness out of your life and I
[42:03] just want to bring that up that thought
[42:04] just caning I didn't plan to say that I
[42:06] just hope that helps you by God's grace
[42:09] cards on the phone and and we can see we
[42:12] can apply the message to 2017 right now
[42:15] right we can apply that to right now
[42:17] what's that card game they were playing
[42:19] I don't remember you know some people
[42:21] play that game I can't remember I was
[42:24] never into cards forgive me I can't
[42:26] solitaire that's it right there as it is
[42:28] solitaire and you know I'm not you know
[42:31] I'm not God but I'm just saying look at
[42:32] the quote and then we see from a purse I
[42:34] see from a personal experience of
[42:37] playing cards and then some thinking
[42:39] somebody's born again and then give us
[42:42] some time and the seed is gonna show
[42:44] what kind of seat it is praise the Lord
[42:47] let the watering come let the winds come
[42:50] pretty soon let the seasons come and go
[42:52] you're gonna find out what that seed
[42:54] really is on the inside aren't you glad
[42:56] your life is a testimony that the seed
[42:58] inside of you is Christ the word amen
[43:02] your life is not given away to two
[43:05] worldly things and pleasures and cares
[43:07] this world but through time through
[43:10] every season God has made your life
[43:12] beautiful amen in his time hallelujah
[43:15] that's all we need stay there so that's
[43:18] what we need in our homes that's what
[43:20] I've been praying for God let my prayers
[43:22] because I see that you know as I go
[43:24] through scenes of my life my prayers
[43:25] here at church can be more sincere than
[43:27] at home and that's not right
[43:29] my prayers at home should be more
[43:31] sincere or just as sincere as my prayers
[43:34] here at church that's right now I want
[43:40] to read a few more talks about the songs
[43:43] used to saying and he said he said
[43:46] that's what we need again I can tell him
[43:48] all my troubles alone he said them kind
[43:50] of meetings and that kind of a church
[43:52] that's the kind of church that prays
[43:55] down the blessings of God
[43:58] how many want to be part of that church
[44:00] I do a church that prays down you get so
[44:04] contact with God that God sends his
[44:06] wheel down and answers your prayers
[44:08] hallelujah I'm sure your pastor would
[44:11] appreciate every member becoming like
[44:13] that and you'd appreciate me coming like
[44:15] that right how that he and how it would
[44:18] be if the church could just be like that
[44:23] praise God
[44:25] and the music continually played and
[44:27] then I heard that I knowed it was my
[44:29] time to come out now here I'm bringing
[44:31] this back from when the attempt the
[44:33] tabernacle was dedicated when a minister
[44:35] walks in the congregation of people
[44:37] praying it in the anointing of the
[44:38] Spirit you're bound to hear from heaven
[44:40] that's just all there's no way to keep
[44:43] from it so there's the law of God of
[44:46] reaping or sowing and reaping the
[44:49] Prophet said we need to build up our
[44:51] homes to be a prayer or altar right and
[44:53] then we need a kind of church that prays
[44:55] the blessings down and then he says when
[44:58] you have that and you pray a church then
[45:00] the Spirit of God can move and you're
[45:02] going to hear from heaven nothing can
[45:04] stop that when people want to hear from
[45:06] heaven they pray to the spirit to speak
[45:09] the spear speaks and they rejoice in
[45:11] what heaven tells them then they get
[45:13] there to strut instructions from heaven
[45:14] and then thy kingdom has come upon this
[45:17] earth thy kingdom has come thy will is
[45:20] done on earth as it is in heaven praise
[45:22] God because they pray down the will of
[45:25] God and the blessings of God amen
[45:27] it's so important Church if you're not
[45:29] praying here it's so important to pray
[45:31] at home in the mornings Saturday Sunday
[45:33] it's so important for you to do that
[45:35] we've got to do that if we want the God
[45:37] to move in our mitts praise God and now
[45:40] I'm just bringing this quote where
[45:41] brother Graham's talking to two brothers
[45:43] Collins and Hickerson because they had a
[45:45] ministry together for the church he said
[45:49] that's isn't the ministry brother
[45:50] Neville he said that's your that's your
[45:52] ministry to the church he said that's
[45:54] your example then he said you brethren
[45:57] should be just as interested in getting
[46:00] your ministry in the place in the house
[46:03] of God let me stop right there where
[46:06] were they supposed to get their gifts in
[46:08] place at the house of God as the
[46:12] ester is interested in getting his
[46:14] because it's just essential that you do
[46:18] it but you can't do in the privacy on
[46:22] the room now he's going back to their
[46:23] gifts if you speak and you neuter prett
[46:25] you've got to come together now come
[46:26] together in the church often a room
[46:28] yourself because you have a private
[46:29] ministry it's not an openly ministry
[46:31] it's one that's the help let's the help
[46:33] the church how many want to help the
[46:34] church this morning how many want the
[46:36] church to be a habitation of the Spirit
[46:38] oh that's what we're talking about in
[46:40] Ephesians 2 we're supposed to be a
[46:42] habitation where the Holy Spirit can
[46:44] dwell but see every person has to be
[46:46] just as interested in being in your
[46:49] position as the pastor or the piano
[46:51] player or everybody else aren't you glad
[46:53] when Loras takes his position at the
[46:55] piano aren't you glad when I take my
[46:58] position as a song leader and a pastor
[47:00] aren't you glad that well everybody has
[47:02] a position and it's so essential that
[47:05] everybody gets in their position amen so
[47:08] we can be a habitation for the Holy
[47:10] Spirit I just want to remind those to
[47:13] you I've preached you know those over
[47:14] the years you know and I just want to
[47:16] remind it's so it's so essential your
[47:19] part is so important the house of God
[47:21] and you say well maybe I don't speak in
[47:23] tongues well maybe you might interpret
[47:24] maybe idols interpret maybe you might
[47:26] have a word of wisdom maybe you might
[47:28] have a gift of knowledge but we want the
[47:30] Spirit to dwell amongst us and it takes
[47:34] your efforts and my efforts takes all of
[47:37] us together I hope that will help us I
[47:41] hope we can grow into that by God's
[47:42] grace I'm trusting we can grow into that
[47:45] I'm trusting you and you have to trust
[47:48] me
[47:48] a man that we can grow into it now let's
[47:52] move now to chapter 3 so that I just
[47:54] wanted to finish chapter 2 of that and
[47:55] if I if I get more inspiration on that
[47:57] I'll bring it back to you but remember
[47:59] God builds us to a habitation of God
[48:02] through the Holy Spirit that's what
[48:04] we're supposed to be building to now
[48:07] Paul goes into Revelation this is going
[48:08] to be a little bit of review for some of
[48:10] us maybe not for others of us I know the
[48:13] young people or the younger you know
[48:15] people might be really helped by this
[48:18] but in let's go to Ephesians 3 verse 1
[48:21] we'll read 1 through 6
[48:25] visions three one through six and
[48:28] remember this was penned by a Holy Ghost
[48:31] filled prophet of God in a prison who
[48:35] had a burden to help out the church at
[48:37] Ephesus because of false doctrines and
[48:40] because he saw the families were weak
[48:42] he saw the marriages were weak he saw
[48:44] they wouldn't they weren't putting on
[48:45] the full armor of God and the Holy Ghost
[48:48] wrote this now god help us to catch this
[48:52] for this cause i paul the prisoner of
[48:55] jesus christ for you gentiles there he
[48:59] is dying wasting away in a prison he
[49:01] said i'm actually not a prisoner of rome
[49:03] i'm a prisoner of christ mercy God if
[49:07] you have heard of the dispensation of
[49:10] the grace of God which has given me to
[49:13] you word how that by revelation he made
[49:17] known unto me the mystery
[49:19] so Jesus Christ Himself came to Paul and
[49:22] made him this next mystery known this
[49:25] mystery of the one body or one family or
[49:30] one church made of both Jews and
[49:32] Gentiles glory and he says as I wrote
[49:36] afore in a few words verse four whereby
[49:39] when we read you may understand my
[49:41] knowledge in the mystery of Christ do we
[49:44] I hope we understand what a what a
[49:46] tremendous blessing it is that you and I
[49:48] understand Paul's knowledge in Christ
[49:50] now everybody has this knowledge there's
[49:54] Christians that are now they're really
[49:55] nice people but they're trying to be
[49:57] more Jewish by adopting Jewish
[50:00] observations and holy days and and Paul
[50:05] never told them to do that we see
[50:07] they're trying to be more Jewish elite
[50:09] and no doubt the law was holy but that's
[50:12] not necessarily what we have to do now
[50:15] and they do that because they're not
[50:16] really sanctified the right way right
[50:18] and they feel a burden to do something
[50:21] more to sanctify themselves rather than
[50:23] getting the sin out of their lives do
[50:25] you understand me because they're
[50:26] cussing they're watching movies they're
[50:28] listening to dirty music they're going
[50:30] to concerts a rock and rolling country
[50:32] and they're feeling a pole to be more
[50:34] holy but they're not going about it the
[50:36] right way
[50:38] so they're and they have a
[50:39] misunderstanding of this mystery and how
[50:42] the Jews and Gentiles are going to be
[50:44] more one oh the one way we're one is by
[50:47] the cleaning power of the blood of Jesus
[50:49] Christ that's how we're gonna be one
[50:51] hallelujah look at verse five which in
[50:55] other ages was not was not made known
[50:57] unto the sons of men as it is now
[51:01] revealed unto his holy prophets
[51:03] I'm sorry apostles and prophets by the
[51:06] spirit verse six that the Gentiles
[51:10] should be fellow heirs and of the same
[51:13] body and partakers of his promise in
[51:15] Christ by the gospel we are in the st.
[51:19] guy said like this we're in the same
[51:20] body as Abraham Aden oh yeah we're in
[51:24] the same body as Isaac and Jacob and
[51:26] Sarah and Rachel we are in that same
[51:29] body though one body of believers praise
[51:31] God we are the children we are the seed
[51:35] of Abraham hallelujah
[51:37] we're children out of the flesh see
[51:39] that's what like I said the churches
[51:40] they're trying their flesh to do these
[51:42] things to feel like they're part of that
[51:43] body but we get in there through the
[51:46] circumcision of the Holy Spirit amen and
[51:49] that's how we get in there that the
[51:51] mysteries been made known to us I'm so
[51:53] glad the mysteries been made known I've
[51:55] had two people this past month email me
[51:58] and say why don't you keep the Sabbath
[51:59] and it's right along these lines you
[52:02] know what we're talking about here
[52:03] they're trying to oh you why don't you
[52:05] keep the physical Sabbath and I tell
[52:07] them I take I keep the spiritual Sabbath
[52:09] the baptism of the holy ghost that's the
[52:11] spiritual Sabbath I'm keeping and they
[52:13] just can't wrap their heads around it
[52:15] they can't see and I lined up all the
[52:17] scriptures and they they said I can't
[52:19] see it but I said and that's and I
[52:22] realize later it's because the mystery
[52:24] hasn't been revealed to them they still
[52:26] think they have to have their Saturday
[52:28] for the RAM calls Saturday your
[52:29] commercial day he said that's your day
[52:32] to get all your work done how many know
[52:34] that he said that's your commercial day
[52:36] but they're trying to see they're trying
[52:38] to shut Saturday down and just you know
[52:40] do nothing which it's good for your body
[52:42] that will be good for your mind but
[52:44] that's not the reality of what the
[52:46] spiritual rest is the spiritual rest is
[52:49] where your soul has got inside of
[52:51] amen and then your soul says amen to
[52:54] every word of God hallelujah but see
[52:58] it's it's it's taught its taught
[53:00] they're taught to have the natural
[53:02] understanding but not the spiritual
[53:04] understanding hope you can understand
[53:07] that
[53:07] so the Gentiles are fellow heirs and of
[53:10] the same body and partakers of his
[53:13] promise in Christ by the gospel look
[53:16] what Scofield said I really like this
[53:17] he said the Gentiles that the Gentiles
[53:20] were to be saved was no mystery
[53:22] they knew that I mean that's written in
[53:23] Isaiah the mystery that was hidden God
[53:26] was the divine purpose to make of Jew
[53:29] and Gentile a holy new thing the church
[53:33] which is his body formed by the baptism
[53:35] of the Holy Ghost like you can read in
[53:37] Isaiah and the Bible said all the
[53:38] Gentiles will come before the temple and
[53:40] it's speaking of the Millenium or
[53:42] speaking of the future home and so the
[53:44] Jews can recognize yeah they're gonna be
[53:46] there eventually gonna be saved you know
[53:47] they're all gonna come follow us but
[53:49] they've got that wrong because what God
[53:51] did is he got rid of the old and he
[53:53] started a new covenant amen and that's
[53:56] that's where the mystery was they think
[53:58] well well the Jews will be saved first
[54:01] but then the Gentiles can be saved at
[54:02] the end but God was saying I was trying
[54:04] to put the the wedding marriage or the
[54:07] wedding ring of unmerited grace on your
[54:09] finger by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:11] but they turned it down so God said I'll
[54:13] blind them I'll put them away for a
[54:15] season and I'll go get me a Gentile
[54:17] bride amen
[54:18] a bride that will love every word and
[54:20] live by every word will be a true wife
[54:23] to me amen that's what they missed
[54:25] they knew the scriptures to the Gentiles
[54:27] shall come and worship before the temple
[54:29] they knew that but they didn't know we'd
[54:31] all be in one body with one power with
[54:34] one blessings of God amen and he says
[54:37] the revelation of this mystery was
[54:38] committed to Paul in his writings alone
[54:42] so see we don't find in Peter we don't
[54:45] find it in James we don't find this in
[54:47] John it's just in Paul's writings alone
[54:50] we find the doctrine position walk and
[54:52] destiny of the church amen aren't you
[54:55] glad now this was not revealed in other
[54:58] ages but it's now revealed to us
[54:59] remember this is one of the the great
[55:02] Bible revelations the twelve revelations
[55:05] in the
[55:05] Bible the 12 mysteries in the Bible I
[55:07] should have put mysteries so let's
[55:09] review these just briefly so you don't
[55:11] forget I've witnessed to people this
[55:14] summer and everything I said you know
[55:15] God had 12 mysteries you should come to
[55:17] our church in here I'm like okay and
[55:18] they don't know nothing it doesn't catch
[55:20] them but when I heard it it did
[55:22] something to me praise God
[55:24] because I want to know God's truth I
[55:26] wouldn't know God's commandments I want
[55:28] all of God I want to know God's Word
[55:31] amen
[55:32] so the one we're looking at is the
[55:33] second one there's 12 New Testament
[55:35] mysteries and brother man preaches us
[55:37] and services it's the end time 1962 the
[55:41] Kingdom of Heaven which has seven
[55:43] parable mysteries I preached on that or
[55:46] two years ago the one body of Jews and
[55:48] Gentiles the New Testament church is the
[55:50] Bride of Christ the catching away or
[55:54] rapture the church is called a mystery
[55:56] now we'll stop there here's the seven
[55:58] parable mysteries that Christ preached
[55:59] the seeds on the four grounds there's
[56:02] your four three classes with the fourth
[56:04] class the wheat and the tares the grain
[56:07] and mut of mustard seed 11 hid in three
[56:10] measures of meal the treasure in the
[56:11] field the Pearl great price and the net
[56:14] cast into the sea we have that sermon on
[56:16] our YouTube page if you'd like to go
[56:17] back and listen to that that was just a
[56:19] tremendous I just felt a tremendous
[56:20] anointing during that service now moving
[56:25] on the fifth mystery is the will of God
[56:28] to you personally and to the church to
[56:32] your age as well number six the mystery
[56:35] of godliness which I believe is a statue
[56:37] perfect man I personally believe that my
[56:39] self brother Ram didn't say that but he
[56:41] didn't say much about that at all but I
[56:43] believe that's to me that's the further
[56:44] revelation of the word that's the statue
[56:46] pervert man because godliness is right
[56:48] before brotherly kindness and then the
[56:51] charity the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:53] now seventh the seven stars eighth is
[56:58] the Godhead the Father God father in
[57:01] christ in colossians two to the godhead
[57:03] god's one person number nine the
[57:06] iniquity which is the antichrist sphere
[57:07] the mystery of iniquity and number ten
[57:10] mystery babylon number eleven israel's
[57:12] blindness and gentile dispensation
[57:14] that's in Romans 11:25 then you have the
[57:17] 12th and final mystery of
[57:19] I seen you the hope of glory amen how
[57:22] many appreciate the mysteries of God you
[57:24] see so you can get in the rapture
[57:25] without the 12 mysteries being revealed
[57:27] to you because the Holy Ghost is a
[57:30] mystery the Holy Ghost is a person that
[57:33] must be personally revealed to you and I
[57:35] are these mysteries important extremely
[57:38] extremely important that's why God had
[57:41] to send a prophet hallelujah now beyond
[57:44] that church you have mystery troops
[57:46] because Jesus that Elijah will come and
[57:48] restore all things so beyond all the
[57:52] mysteries beyond that now you've got
[57:54] mystery troops that must be restored in
[57:57] other words the faith of the Apostolic
[57:59] fathers must be brought back to us amen
[58:02] so see we have the baptism there receive
[58:05] the serpent holiness daily life and
[58:08] modest clothing clothing the fivefold
[58:10] ministry and the gifts of the Spirit
[58:11] which is the power of the Holy Spirit as
[58:13] well as well tithes and offerings three
[58:16] New Testament works of grace the future
[58:19] home marriage and divorce the position
[58:21] of women with their gifts and not in
[58:23] aloud in the pulpit the predestination
[58:26] grace and truth not disgrace but true
[58:30] grace the anointed ones at the end time
[58:32] the anointing of the Holy Spirit three
[58:34] divine oranges secret praying alms
[58:36] giving and fasting and you can go on and
[58:38] on and on aren't you glad that the
[58:40] Bible's restored to you now each church
[58:42] is kind of had like a little piece of
[58:44] these of these mysteries or truths but
[58:46] not all of it but we're the Church of
[58:49] the Living God and God has restored all
[58:51] the mysteries of God amen aren't you
[58:54] glad to be a part of a church that has
[58:56] all the mysteries preached to it plus
[58:58] all the restored truths of the Bible
[59:00] hallelujah glory we ought to be Church
[59:03] amen you ought to be happy about that if
[59:05] not something's wrong with your walk
[59:07] with God amen because this this unlocks
[59:10] relationship as we said on Wednesday
[59:12] this unlocks access to God through
[59:15] relationship the baptism of the Holy
[59:16] Ghost and then access to God through
[59:18] intercession intercessory prayer amen
[59:21] it's exactly right
[59:23] glory now let's look at this we'll keep
[59:26] going
[59:27] in Ephesians three seven just a brief
[59:30] review there hope that's okay
[59:31] we're
[59:33] for I was made a minister according to
[59:34] the gift of the grace of God given unto
[59:38] me by the effectual working of his power
[59:44] God made him a minister by a gift placed
[59:47] in his life now we know as Jesus said
[59:51] the gift will only help people who
[59:52] believe in the gift right so Paul might
[59:56] have had a gift and obviously it didn't
[59:58] work with those in Asia because at the
[59:59] end of his ministry in Asia all Asia had
[1:00:01] forsaken him let's read that real quick
[1:00:04] let's go to 2nd Timothy chapter 1 so you
[1:00:06] can see that by God's grace 2nd Timothy
[1:00:15] 1 verse 15
[1:00:16] how many buddy Paul had to give to God
[1:00:19] but the gift of God only works when
[1:00:21] you're in tune with the Holy Spirit
[1:00:23] that's operating the gift just like
[1:00:25] Jesus he could not do many mighty works
[1:00:27] because of unbelief and so it is for me
[1:00:31] as a pastor so it is for you no matter
[1:00:33] where you go or what sermons you hear or
[1:00:35] where if you got lead you to different
[1:00:37] church who ever maybe you only get out
[1:00:40] of it what you put into it praise God
[1:00:41] and Paul said my ministry works by
[1:00:45] effectual power it works by the flowing
[1:00:48] of the Holy Spirit and we've got to be
[1:00:51] the habitation of the Spirit amen
[1:00:53] then the gifts can really operate and
[1:00:55] move for us by the grace of God 2nd
[1:00:58] Timothy 1 verse 14 that good thing which
[1:01:03] was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
[1:01:04] Ghost which dwelleth in us that's why
[1:01:07] people can't keep the victory they're
[1:01:09] not born again but we keep victories by
[1:01:12] what the Holy Ghost that dwells within
[1:01:15] us hallelujah
[1:01:17] verse 15 this thou knowest that all they
[1:01:20] which are in Asia be turned away from me
[1:01:24] of whom our fire jealous and Hermogenes
[1:01:30] an entire continent rejects God's profit
[1:01:35] now they're not going to be able to say
[1:01:37] well Paul your gift wasn't good enough
[1:01:39] you didn't preach good enough for us or
[1:01:41] you you know your gift was too weak to
[1:01:44] ministers know
[1:01:46] said I've got a gift of God and it works
[1:01:48] by the operation of the Holy Spirit the
[1:01:51] thing was the people's hearts and minds
[1:01:53] were not in tune with the Holy Spirit
[1:01:55] God help us to be in tune with the Holy
[1:01:57] Spirit amen
[1:01:58] the gift will only work if you're in
[1:02:01] tune with what the spirits saying amen
[1:02:03] that's exactly right that's a burden for
[1:02:05] me as a pastor I want the gift of God in
[1:02:07] my life to minister to you but you've
[1:02:09] got to have the right attitude toward
[1:02:11] the gift of God I was there at preaching
[1:02:14] in New York and I remember brother
[1:02:15] Vaughn told me he said brother Jesse God
[1:02:16] was so anointing you he said my daughter
[1:02:18] will not move an inch unless the true
[1:02:21] Holy Ghost is there and he said while
[1:02:23] you were preaching on Sunday morning my
[1:02:25] daughter jumped up and she danced around
[1:02:27] that church so much when she finally
[1:02:30] came to herself she was in the back
[1:02:32] staring at the back wall and finally
[1:02:35] didn't even know where she was at I like
[1:02:36] that because that's getting drunk in the
[1:02:38] Holy Spirit and then your soul filled
[1:02:40] with the Holy Spirit God can speak
[1:02:42] anything and you obey it praise God
[1:02:44] hallelujah so I know when I can get in
[1:02:47] the channel when you can get in the
[1:02:49] channel I know the gift of God is
[1:02:51] effective it'll work if we just have
[1:02:53] faith in God
[1:02:55] but you've got to have your heart in the
[1:02:57] right condition so do I see it's an
[1:03:01] effectual gift so there's there's power
[1:03:03] in the gift but it's all about your
[1:03:06] attitude to that right sometimes people
[1:03:09] give the ministers bad looks sometimes
[1:03:11] they fall asleep in the sermon right
[1:03:14] sometimes they'll walk out and slam the
[1:03:15] door now we don't have that our church
[1:03:17] at least I haven't seen it for a while
[1:03:19] but see how much the attitude makes a
[1:03:21] difference it's all about the attitude a
[1:03:24] whole oh it doesn't bother party I'm
[1:03:27] sorry but ma'am said Paul's missionary
[1:03:28] gift was the greatest missionary give
[1:03:30] that ever struck the world the greatest
[1:03:33] missionary ever was Paul and a whole
[1:03:36] nation turns him down because they're
[1:03:37] not giving respect to the gifting of God
[1:03:40] in his life god help us to be more
[1:03:43] respectful hallelujah
[1:03:45] any gift of God can operate if we've got
[1:03:48] the right respect towards God god help
[1:03:52] us so see Paul was made a minister
[1:03:55] according to the gift of God and by the
[1:03:57] effectual working of the power of God it
[1:03:59] was God's
[1:04:00] power that we was gonna work through him
[1:04:02] now look what he says in verse eight
[1:04:05] here's our text yes here's what I wanted
[1:04:07] to go to I'm doing pretty good on time
[1:04:09] as well by God's grace fusions 3:8 here
[1:04:16] now we got to our text here let me just
[1:04:17] set a timers all right unto me who am
[1:04:25] less than the least of the Saints in
[1:04:30] this grace given that I should preach
[1:04:32] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[1:04:34] riches of Christ Paul was preaching on
[1:04:41] searchable riches that means brother
[1:04:45] bang you and I couldn't even find him
[1:04:46] out there so great we go looking for him
[1:04:48] we can find him you ever go on a
[1:04:50] scavenger hunt and not find what you're
[1:04:51] looking for I know you've been to the
[1:04:53] store and you haven't found what you're
[1:04:54] looking for I know that it's
[1:04:58] unsearchable I just couldn't find that
[1:04:59] there out of it oh they're all out of
[1:05:01] this they're out of that Paul says I'm
[1:05:03] preaching on searchable riches riches
[1:05:06] that are so great you can't even find
[1:05:08] them out and yet a whole nation turns
[1:05:11] him down turns out his gift cuz whatever
[1:05:13] reason they don't like Paul they're like
[1:05:15] his doctrine they got a bad attitude
[1:05:17] toward him and yet he says I'm preaching
[1:05:19] brother Graham says every preacher is
[1:05:21] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[1:05:23] Christ amen that means Christ has riches
[1:05:27] that we don't even know but we've got to
[1:05:29] preach that they're available they're
[1:05:31] out there for us if we'll just believe
[1:05:33] amen if we'll just have trust in God's
[1:05:36] Word now Paul said he's less than the
[1:05:40] least so I thought of myself well how
[1:05:44] humble are we if he is placing himself
[1:05:47] lesser than the least like brother Ram
[1:05:51] said he's like the skin on the bottom of
[1:05:53] a foot you know that's on the head of
[1:05:55] the serpent you know or the lowest thing
[1:05:57] in the body that's what Paul's placing
[1:06:00] himself a man who had such great
[1:06:01] revelations and wrote most of the Bible
[1:06:04] the New Testament he humbled himself
[1:06:07] this is how much he thought of himself
[1:06:09] in church let's have a reality of this
[1:06:11] that you and I know not
[1:06:14] joking around her silliness but in
[1:06:15] reality we think so little of ourselves
[1:06:17] that we can be humble like Paul and the
[1:06:20] only way up is down the only way up is
[1:06:25] down look how Paul see how Paul was
[1:06:27] exalted up it's because he'd humble
[1:06:29] himself I realize I am nothing so I just
[1:06:35] give a little just a chart here or just
[1:06:37] a you know an order
[1:06:39] Paul said he's Lisa the apostles here's
[1:06:41] the apostles he's lower than them then
[1:06:44] he's least of all the saints and then he
[1:06:46] said I was the chief of all sinners see
[1:06:49] he's remembering where he came from now
[1:06:51] I know he's not a sinner anymore but I'm
[1:06:53] just showing you where he placed himself
[1:06:54] he never forgot what he used to do he
[1:06:57] never forgot where he came from
[1:06:59] now really of course he places himself
[1:07:01] then right here but I just want to show
[1:07:03] you the illustration he said I was even
[1:07:05] the chief of all sinners so if you're
[1:07:06] the chief of all sinners you're actually
[1:07:08] the lowest of the low right you are the
[1:07:10] lowest of the low so he used his memory
[1:07:14] and sinful background about his memory
[1:07:17] about a simple background as spiritual
[1:07:19] motivation to do something for the Lord
[1:07:23] that's what he said
[1:07:24] he said this for I am the least of the
[1:07:26] Apostles he said that am not neat to be
[1:07:30] called an apostle because I persecuted
[1:07:31] the Church of God but by the grace of
[1:07:36] God I am what I am and His grace which
[1:07:39] was bestowed upon me was not in vain but
[1:07:41] I laboured more abundantly than they all
[1:07:42] yet not i but the grace of God which was
[1:07:46] with me recently I had to cast down a
[1:07:49] pride devil you ever had to cast down a
[1:07:52] pride devil we had visitors come and
[1:07:56] visit our Bible club some grandparents
[1:07:58] and I had 80 kids in there and I'm
[1:08:00] controlling them teaching them you know
[1:08:02] trying to keep them on task and minister
[1:08:04] to them by the Holy Spirit and I was
[1:08:06] really we had a really good service you
[1:08:07] know and some of the kids got baptized
[1:08:09] now I asked him you want to Lord Jesus
[1:08:10] Christ or father son Holy Ghost and and
[1:08:13] I sent him the scriptures I sent him
[1:08:14] nine scriptures I let them decide
[1:08:16] and so I baptized none of those you know
[1:08:19] all the ones that want to say Father Son
[1:08:20] Holy Ghost I let the other guy baptize I
[1:08:22] told him I said this is why and I showed
[1:08:24] him you know showed him in the scripture
[1:08:26] why but it
[1:08:27] and then we had you know numerous
[1:08:28] children give their hearts to Lord and
[1:08:30] get baptized and we were rejoicing we're
[1:08:31] just happy they want to serve the Lord
[1:08:32] but one of the grandparents come up to
[1:08:35] me and said he said something along
[1:08:37] these lines there's a pride demon I
[1:08:38] could tell because I was feeling really
[1:08:40] good and I was almost tempted to agree
[1:08:41] with him he said why I've been to so
[1:08:44] many churches and youth meetings and he
[1:08:46] said you're the best and this and this
[1:08:47] and all that and I I was gonna say thank
[1:08:50] you but all of a sudden this scripture
[1:08:51] came to my mind like it shot down from
[1:08:53] heaven you ever had that before your
[1:08:55] flesh is just ready to say something and
[1:08:58] it came to me and I felt like I got
[1:09:01] inoculated I got a shot and I said and I
[1:09:04] bowed my head and said no I am what I am
[1:09:07] by the grace of God I said there's
[1:09:09] nothing good about me and I just I left
[1:09:11] there feeling good I got a victory over
[1:09:12] that pride demon amen and the man beep I
[1:09:15] didn't know what he was doing but that's
[1:09:17] his way to express his love but I knew
[1:09:20] for me it would have been pride to agree
[1:09:22] with that and I remember where did I
[1:09:24] come from I was the guy and I've got
[1:09:26] pictures of this if you want to seen at
[1:09:27] home I was the guy at Sunday school like
[1:09:30] this and we're all in circles and I'm
[1:09:32] going like this I'm I don't even look at
[1:09:34] the teacher I look so see none of you
[1:09:36] are that bad children
[1:09:37] Lydia maokai none of you are as bad as I
[1:09:40] was I would give the teacher such
[1:09:43] disrespect and I say that to my shame so
[1:09:47] I would say I was the least of the least
[1:09:49] if I could say like Paul I would just
[1:09:52] bow my head there in shame then when
[1:09:53] they talked to me I talked it put my
[1:09:55] head back down so I was too busy staying
[1:09:57] up late watching Saturday Night Live and
[1:09:58] all this they have any energy for church
[1:10:00] when I was in high school and I remember
[1:10:03] I must remember what I was I was the one
[1:10:05] that used to run out of church so I go
[1:10:07] listen to rock and roll in the car after
[1:10:08] church I was the one looking at the
[1:10:11] clock will pastor when you gonna finish
[1:10:12] I was the lowest of the low but by the
[1:10:16] grace of God I am what I am now and I
[1:10:19] want to be like Paul I want to labor
[1:10:20] more than other people not because it's
[1:10:23] me but because I remember what I was I
[1:10:26] want to I want to undo all that and I
[1:10:28] want to do something for the kingdom of
[1:10:29] God you understand I can't say it may be
[1:10:32] just the way I want to but I hope you
[1:10:33] can understand that's what Paul did Paul
[1:10:35] said I persecuted the church I want to
[1:10:39] do and I'm
[1:10:41] less than all the least of the Saints
[1:10:43] I'm the lowest of the low
[1:10:46] remember to who much is forgiven God
[1:10:49] loves much right whoever is forgiven
[1:10:51] much they're just loveth much forgive me
[1:10:53] like the woman caught in adultery and
[1:10:56] the woman who washes feet there the
[1:10:57] prostitute woman jesus said he who loved
[1:11:00] or forgiven much loves much in that
[1:11:02] church that may she make you and I love
[1:11:04] Christ more and more amen remember how
[1:11:07] awful you were remember the evil things
[1:11:08] you did and we can thank God for where
[1:11:11] he's brought us from amen so see it was
[1:11:14] the grace that caused him to work harder
[1:11:17] he labored more than Peter he labored
[1:11:20] more than James he labored more than
[1:11:23] Thaddeus he labored more than John Paul
[1:11:25] labored more than all of them because he
[1:11:28] had that inspiration right he said I'm
[1:11:31] lower than the low you see how humbling
[1:11:33] yourself will make you do more for the
[1:11:35] kingdom of God it's not gonna make you
[1:11:38] do less when you humble yourself it's
[1:11:39] actually gonna make you labor more for
[1:11:41] Christ so you can look at your life now
[1:11:44] and say what am i laboring what am i
[1:11:45] doing for Christ and you can see it
[1:11:49] while I'm laboring a lot because I
[1:11:51] really because I'm staying humble but if
[1:11:53] you're getting prideful you're not doing
[1:11:55] anything for the kingdom of God because
[1:11:57] humility causes you to labor that's what
[1:12:01] happened to Paul how many say lord help
[1:12:03] me with my humility I have my hands up I
[1:12:05] am what I am by God's grace I'm nothing
[1:12:08] we're nothing god help us to humble
[1:12:10] ourselves and pray down the blessings of
[1:12:12] God amen
[1:12:13] because that's one thing we can do we
[1:12:15] can humble ourselves and pray to God
[1:12:16] amen remember it's not about the big
[1:12:20] lights and Hollywood and show and
[1:12:22] numbers and all these things that's just
[1:12:23] about sincere contact with God Almighty
[1:12:25] amen so how humble are we I just I just
[1:12:29] thought yesterday I just put it up there
[1:12:31] Paul was in prison preaching the gospel
[1:12:33] yet still able to minister the churches
[1:12:35] he could have given up he could have
[1:12:37] said I'm you know I'm chained up I'm i
[1:12:39] can't move i got this Roman soldier
[1:12:42] chained up to me I'll just give up I'll
[1:12:44] just pack it in and well wait for the
[1:12:46] right for the rapture that's what we
[1:12:49] sound like sometimes but I'll just give
[1:12:50] up I'll just wait for the rapture
[1:12:52] no stay busy let us labor for the mass
[1:12:54] from the dawn till Setting Sun amen let
[1:12:57] us talk of all his wondrous love and
[1:12:59] care amen
[1:13:00] he's still able to be a minister while
[1:13:04] in prison I like that he humbled himself
[1:13:09] even though the revelation even though
[1:13:11] the 12 mysteries have been made known to
[1:13:13] you you and I must stay humble even
[1:13:16] though all the mystery truths are
[1:13:18] revealed to you and I we've got to stay
[1:13:20] humble and remember were the least of
[1:13:22] the least we have to do that then we'll
[1:13:26] actually work and do something for God
[1:13:28] then I'll say like this then we can
[1:13:29] labour in prayer then we can labor for
[1:13:32] witnessing then we can labor and a gift
[1:13:34] then we can labor in a ministry but we
[1:13:36] the reason we're not is we're not humble
[1:13:38] enough God humble us amen that's my
[1:13:41] prayer God humbles to do something
[1:13:44] that's what Paul saying here it was the
[1:13:46] grace of God that was causing me to do
[1:13:49] this never I understand is there
[1:13:52] anything confusing so far raise your
[1:13:53] hand I'll try to answer it anything
[1:13:54] confusing so far pretty familiar
[1:13:57] okay praise the Lord all right now let's
[1:14:00] get in this last thought here maybe the
[1:14:02] last thought will see the unsearchable
[1:14:05] riches of Christ thank you Jesus this is
[1:14:12] Ephesians 3:8 yo kalbarri did again unto
[1:14:16] me Who am less than the least of All
[1:14:18] Saints is this grace given that I should
[1:14:23] preach among the Gentiles the
[1:14:25] unsearchable riches Christ this
[1:14:31] scripture has always been a little bit
[1:14:32] of a puzzle to me I don't know about you
[1:14:33] but I thought what are the unsearchable
[1:14:35] riches of Christ so I just you know
[1:14:38] being a you know a simple man that I am
[1:14:41] I just typed in unsearchable riches and
[1:14:43] brother brems quotes and there's 18
[1:14:45] quotes on it so I chose the ones I think
[1:14:47] I might have let's see three four five
[1:14:50] six I might have about ten of them so
[1:14:52] let's go through these can we go through
[1:14:53] these real quick by God's grace how many
[1:14:55] appreciate the unsearchable riches of
[1:14:57] Christ whether you know it or not if
[1:14:59] you're sitting here and you are a
[1:15:00] genuine believer you've already
[1:15:02] experienced some of the riches of Christ
[1:15:05] the thing is though the thing we have to
[1:15:07] remember is that we need to keep
[1:15:08] hungering for more of the riches of
[1:15:10] Christ because we get complacent in
[1:15:12] America of course any church in any but
[1:15:14] especially America we have to remember
[1:15:17] there's things out there that God wants
[1:15:19] to do if we'll just get in his will if
[1:15:21] we'll just get in under the anointing
[1:15:23] there are unsearchable things out there
[1:15:25] banking I wonder of and I could look
[1:15:27] back to when we started the church back
[1:15:29] in June of 2006 all the unsearchable
[1:15:32] things that have happened now now
[1:15:34] they're now they're known like saving
[1:15:36] family members and things like that God
[1:15:38] heal and different people and doing
[1:15:40] great blessings but they were
[1:15:41] unsearchable back then but because we
[1:15:44] stayed in the Word of God they become a
[1:15:45] reality praise God the riches of Christ
[1:15:49] our reality brother man you and I and
[1:15:50] sister beau and my wife John Lisa we see
[1:15:53] the riches of Christ because we preach
[1:15:56] the word and now we see the riches what
[1:15:57] are they
[1:15:58] their souls amen what are they they're
[1:16:01] their testimonies there there are
[1:16:03] time-tested memorials of the glory and
[1:16:07] power of Christ letting his kingdom come
[1:16:09] down to this earth amen glory let's go
[1:16:13] through some of these I'm just being I'm
[1:16:15] just enthused for these so bear with me
[1:16:17] hallelujah we need to be enthused
[1:16:20] now bear with you don't lose your
[1:16:21] attention Herod he's talked about John
[1:16:24] the Baptist Herod come up you know that
[1:16:25] with his brother Philips wife I can hear
[1:16:28] some of the outers come out say don't
[1:16:29] preach on marriage and divorce today now
[1:16:31] there's Herod setting down there old
[1:16:35] John full of the Holy Ghost can you
[1:16:38] imagine him holding back walked right
[1:16:41] straight up to his face said it's not
[1:16:42] lawful for you to have her that's right
[1:16:44] God give us some John's why I say today
[1:16:48] what the Baptist Church they're needin
[1:16:50] some more John's like John the Baptist
[1:16:52] who will not compromise but will preach
[1:16:54] the unsearchable riches of Christ
[1:16:58] see how humble he makes this so did you
[1:17:02] catch that marriage and divorce are some
[1:17:05] of the riches of Christ and the church
[1:17:07] said are you with me he said we need
[1:17:10] some more John's that I'll tell the
[1:17:12] truth won't compromise with the word and
[1:17:14] preach to them the will of God and
[1:17:16] brother Ram said they're on there
[1:17:17] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[1:17:19] Christ hey man
[1:17:21] see
[1:17:22] if he would obey this Herod he could
[1:17:24] have repented Herodias could have
[1:17:25] repented they could have separated and
[1:17:27] they perhaps could have got saved that
[1:17:29] would have been the greatest riches of
[1:17:31] Christ would be salvation does that help
[1:17:34] by God's grace you see we so I always
[1:17:37] thought it was so far away but brother
[1:17:38] Adam comes down on down and brings it
[1:17:39] it's it's these truths that we need to
[1:17:41] hear it's all the riches of God's Word
[1:17:44] that will guide our lives those are the
[1:17:47] riches of Christ oh my he man he said
[1:17:50] help me dear God to stand there in the
[1:17:52] valley stand with the sword in hand
[1:17:54] granite Lord and preach the unsearchable
[1:17:57] riches of Jesus Christ telling men and
[1:17:59] women their what how how holy they are
[1:18:03] how great they are how rich and handsome
[1:18:06] and pretty they are no tell them their
[1:18:08] sins then you're preaching the
[1:18:11] unsearchable riches of Christ
[1:18:13] hope this is opening some of our eyes a
[1:18:15] little bit helping us and before the
[1:18:19] unless they confess it and die out to
[1:18:22] self and become born-again they're an
[1:18:23] alien from you that's see see how that
[1:18:26] ties in with the riches of this mystery
[1:18:27] Paul's talking about unless they repent
[1:18:30] and have get rid of their sins and place
[1:18:32] their faith in Christ they don't accept
[1:18:34] they do not obtain the riches of Christ
[1:18:37] which are forgiveness which are
[1:18:40] salvation which is power which is love
[1:18:43] all these things you and I should have
[1:18:44] amen glory
[1:18:46] that's the riches of Christ telling them
[1:18:51] their sins God this lovely big
[1:18:57] Pentecostal Full Gospel group of men and
[1:18:58] women how all they've received the
[1:19:00] knowledge of truth God let them walk in
[1:19:02] the truth now see let them live and
[1:19:04] preach and do the things that the
[1:19:06] Scriptures telling them to do anything
[1:19:10] that was including the atonement is
[1:19:11] personal property for every believer can
[1:19:13] you say Amen when a man gets saved or a
[1:19:16] woman or boy or girl God gives them a
[1:19:18] checkbook as it was with Jesus name at
[1:19:20] the bottom of every check for anything
[1:19:21] redemptive blessing that Jesus died for
[1:19:23] it's your personal property don't be
[1:19:26] afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven
[1:19:28] will recognize it jesus said what summer
[1:19:32] things you desire when you pray believe

[1:24:07] Spirit and go without any education and
[1:24:10] proclaim the unsearchable riches of
[1:24:12] Christ that's what's great in the sight
[1:24:15] of God hey you we've never even been
[1:24:20] there to heaven but yet we're preaching
[1:24:22] about how great it is hallelujah because
[1:24:24] it's unsearchable and that's because
[1:24:26] Heaven's Spirit has entered into your
[1:24:28] soul amen that's why I can preach about
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:31] heavens entered my soul so a part of
[1:24:33] heaven is inside of me that's why I
[1:24:35] preached about the unsearchable riches
[1:24:37] of Christ hey man nobody I never went to
[1:24:42] any I went to school to be a teacher I
[1:24:43] didn't go to school to be a preacher so
[1:24:46] I believe that's me I've risen in the
[1:24:48] power and the anointing of the Holy
[1:24:49] Ghost and I'm preaching the unsearchable
[1:24:51] riches of Christ hey man that's my
[1:24:54] personal testimony I believe that with
[1:24:56] all my heart I'm almost done I got a few
[1:24:58] more to go total deliverance that should
[1:25:02] be the motive every Christian and every
[1:25:03] person the church is to unify ourselves
[1:25:05] and stick together I'm just gonna talk
[1:25:08] about how he's talking about he's
[1:25:10] talking about Church voting cuz they
[1:25:11] were gonna vote to renovate the
[1:25:14] tabernacle and he says you know I should
[1:25:16] throw him out you probably heard that
[1:25:17] before
[1:25:17] I'd put my he said I didn't want to
[1:25:19] build a new tabernacle I don't want to
[1:25:21] he said we'd have the money to do it he
[1:25:23] said but when he saw all the people
[1:25:24] wanted it he threw out his vote and he
[1:25:26] put his vote in with those people that
[1:25:28] won to renovate the tabernacle and look
[1:25:30] what he says here and if this church
[1:25:31] will just go on the way you're going now
[1:25:33] and be united together God will it's
[1:25:36] unlimited what he'll do if we stick
[1:25:38] together it's unlimited there's no limit
[1:25:42] its unsearchable what God can do in
[1:25:44] Akron Ohio if we just all rally together
[1:25:46] what's it gonna take prayer can take the
[1:25:49] anointing of the Holy Spirit it's gonna
[1:25:51] take humility all right we got to humble
[1:25:53] ourselves we got to find our position in
[1:25:55] place and God has to trust us there I
[1:25:58] like that we must stick together that's
[1:26:02] how we want to be so complete with one
[1:26:04] another and then so complete in the
[1:26:05] hands of God oh thank you Jesus Mary's
[1:26:10] believe that's why we're having this
[1:26:12] Christian business men's fellowship this
[1:26:13] morning we're businessmen can worship
[1:26:15] together on one common
[1:26:16] believing Jesus Christ is the same
[1:26:18] yesterday today and forever that's why
[1:26:21] we got churches around over the city and
[1:26:23] around this world that's preaching the
[1:26:24] unsearchable riches of Christ because we
[1:26:28] have fellowship together we set in
[1:26:30] heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy
[1:26:33] Ghost coming upon us and overshadowing
[1:26:35] us empowering us with gifts and signs
[1:26:38] and wonders and miracles why it's the
[1:26:40] closest thing to heaven there is on
[1:26:42] earth amen you see how that's what we
[1:26:47] must preach the unsearchable riches of
[1:26:48] Christ and it creates such a heavenly
[1:26:50] atmosphere that heaven comes down amen
[1:26:53] we all got to support the gift we have
[1:26:55] to believe in the gifts here we have to
[1:26:57] find our position find our gifts we've
[1:27:00] got to have a part in this ministry this
[1:27:02] endtime ministry praise God I've got
[1:27:06] four more to go I believe five more
[1:27:08] let's bow our heads a moment he said
[1:27:11] with there be any here say brother band
[1:27:13] remember me let my spiritual eyes come
[1:27:14] open that I might see and know him how I
[1:27:16] want to see him how I love him he said
[1:27:19] raise your hands and say remember me and
[1:27:22] he says the unsearchable riches of
[1:27:23] Christ the revealing of his power and
[1:27:25] goodness may the God of heaven and give
[1:27:27] mercy kindness and grace to you all so
[1:27:30] see when there's a response to the
[1:27:32] people the Prophet said see look at this
[1:27:33] we've seen the unsearchable riches of
[1:27:35] Christ we've seen Christ move he's going
[1:27:38] to give people healing right he's gonna
[1:27:40] give people power how many of you want
[1:27:42] power how many people want goodness you
[1:27:44] see you've got to respond to that you've
[1:27:46] got to be in the spirit and respond to
[1:27:49] that and the Prophet said now we're
[1:27:50] seeing the unsearchable riches of Christ
[1:27:54] remember I'm just saying what the
[1:27:57] Prophet said I'm not had you can look
[1:27:58] all these up adoption for more to go
[1:28:02] this is number four I remember brother
[1:28:05] Collins thirty years ago when the church
[1:28:07] wasn't built yet the little tent meeting
[1:28:08] we had on the corner my first meeting I
[1:28:11] was preaching this same gospel the same
[1:28:13] thing the unsearchable riches of Christ
[1:28:15] look look what he names water baptism is
[1:28:20] a rich well how come we don't act like
[1:28:22] it's rich anymore right honey you just
[1:28:25] get we just get you know it just becomes
[1:28:27] common to us but brother Graham said
[1:28:29] that is one of the
[1:28:30] she's unsearchable riches of Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ I know it was for me cuz I was
[1:28:34] raised in denomination I never heard it
[1:28:36] when Simon showed it to me it's like all
[1:28:38] heaven it's like the lights of heaven
[1:28:40] shining upon me I never knew this my
[1:28:42] this is all through the Bible this
[1:28:44] there's only one baptism it's the name
[1:28:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:48] that's the riches of heaven being given
[1:28:50] to me amen a believer believing every
[1:28:54] word to be the truth is one of the
[1:28:55] riches of God the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost one of the riches of God divine
[1:28:59] healing the powers of God just like I
[1:29:02] preached it now amen he's still
[1:29:04] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[1:29:05] Christ now look here's where we got to
[1:29:07] be in tune with all the preachers saying
[1:29:10] something you know he's going on that
[1:29:12] same line and as soon as we hear
[1:29:13] something that you've already heard what
[1:29:15] we do is we we may we may shut the
[1:29:17] preacher off you may shut me up and stop
[1:29:20] polling and stop hungry and stop wanting
[1:29:22] to hear the Word of God you may fall
[1:29:23] asleep
[1:29:23] you might yawn you might get tired right
[1:29:27] you might you might walk out and
[1:29:28] whatever more but see he says I never
[1:29:32] varied one inch God's reveal more of it
[1:29:34] to me so as he reveals it I just keep
[1:29:38] bringing it on he never takes away what
[1:29:41] has been he just keeps adding more of it
[1:29:44] now sorry
[1:29:45] hallelujah to see programs message never
[1:29:49] changed God just kept adding more
[1:29:51] revelation more revelation but the
[1:29:53] people got a hunger for more revelation
[1:29:55] you've got a hunger for more I've got a
[1:29:57] hunger for more we have to be a
[1:29:59] habitation for the Holy Spirit
[1:30:03] hallelujah and I preached on this often
[1:30:07] I know I do but Church how can we go any
[1:30:09] further with God until we get our lives
[1:30:11] line up with God's Word and really
[1:30:13] hunger and thirst and forgot
[1:30:15] let me ask again they don't raise your
[1:30:16] hands how many people are so completely
[1:30:18] yielded to God that you know you're in
[1:30:21] your place in your position and God
[1:30:23] speaking through you I'm not asking you
[1:30:24] raise your hands but how many people
[1:30:25] know that that's a pretty serious
[1:30:27] question
[1:30:28] you're so completely yielded you just do
[1:30:30] what God wants you to do well if we care
[1:30:33] if we couldn't raise our spiritual hands
[1:30:34] on that then we should say God take me
[1:30:36] higher humble me keep me little help me
[1:30:40] to remember the unsearchable riches of
[1:30:43] Jesus Christ
[1:30:45] because we're in a spot where if we're
[1:30:47] not careful it's like there's no more
[1:30:49] war we don't fight in prayer for souls
[1:30:52] we don't fight - witness can everybody
[1:30:54] understand what I'm saying can everybody
[1:30:55] relate to that there's no more burden to
[1:30:57] fast
[1:30:58] there's no more you see that there's no
[1:31:01] more war because Satan has rocked people
[1:31:03] to sleep this is not the time to be
[1:31:06] rocked to sleep this is the time to be
[1:31:07] awake we're the children of the light
[1:31:09] we're not children of darkness we're not
[1:31:11] sleeping we know it's a battle we know
[1:31:13] it's a war their souls at stake praise
[1:31:16] God
[1:31:16] there's unsearchable riches for Christ
[1:31:18] but we've got to be in tune with that
[1:31:20] amen it's a wake up call this morning
[1:31:24] right for all of us and I know we get
[1:31:27] that constant wake-up call but guess
[1:31:29] what you need that constant wake-up call
[1:31:31] right I need that constant wake-up call
[1:31:34] because I know my life you know your
[1:31:36] life we must be so completely yielded to
[1:31:39] God praise the Lord
[1:31:44] three more our Father
[1:31:47] he's praying beginning of a service
[1:31:50] we're need grateful this afternoon for
[1:31:51] this another privilege to stand the
[1:31:53] pulpit to proclaim the unsearchable
[1:31:54] riches of Jesus Christ to a dying world
[1:31:58] without God so see this is why it's
[1:32:00] unsearchable people are dying they have
[1:32:04] no hope that's why the gospel is so
[1:32:05] powerful it gives people hope and no
[1:32:09] hope of going with Jesus when he comes
[1:32:11] one of my youtube videos I got another
[1:32:14] comment and they said they said brother
[1:32:17] pastor Smith I blasting the Holy Ghost
[1:32:19] and I got 13 pages proving why baptize
[1:32:21] the holy goat or blasting the Holy Ghost
[1:32:23] can God save me and I said sister I said
[1:32:27] Paul blasting the Holy Ghost but he did
[1:32:29] it in ignorance
[1:32:30] I said you ought to spend 13 pages
[1:32:32] proven why you are going to be saved
[1:32:34] rather than dwelling why you think
[1:32:36] you're going to be lost right because
[1:32:38] the gospel gives hope and that's what we
[1:32:40] do we'll build up the case why we can't
[1:32:42] yield to God more why we can't do this
[1:32:43] why we can't get more to God let's build
[1:32:45] the case why we can amen hallelujah
[1:32:48] because the world's dying
[1:32:50] let's have hope we know Jesus Christ is
[1:32:53] coming he says and we're trying Lord to
[1:32:56] present Jesus Christ to the nation's
[1:32:57] and while we're assembling here this
[1:32:59] afternoon may the Holy Spirit speak and
[1:33:00] warm our hearts here's some more here's
[1:33:03] some more riches of Christ how many want
[1:33:04] to warm heart for Jesus not cold when
[1:33:07] the preaching or : brothers the brothers
[1:33:08] singing is special but it's warm oh I
[1:33:10] like that there's a fountain filled with
[1:33:12] blood all that just warms my soul are
[1:33:15] you with me it's here to warm your heart
[1:33:18] to get you more warm for Christ it's
[1:33:23] here to encourage you while you walk on
[1:33:25] the way the unsearchable riches of

[1:33:33] sinner you're it's here to save you and
[1:33:35] those who are discouraged you can be
[1:33:37] encouraged he already said that twice
[1:33:39] okay and may God receive all the glory 9
[1:33:41] or may be given into his name for that's
[1:33:44] our purpose amen
[1:33:47] two more to go this is the second one
[1:33:49] I'm doing real good on time to praise
[1:33:51] the Lord and brother and sister even to
[1:33:54] young folks let's put all the sincerity
[1:33:58] we can this might be the last revival
[1:34:02] will ever attend and we may not get
[1:34:04] through this one until he's coming I'm
[1:34:06] looking for him today and if he isn't
[1:34:07] here today I'll be looking for him
[1:34:08] tomorrow if I'm here and I've been
[1:34:11] looking for him now since I heard about
[1:34:12] him returning and that's been 33 years
[1:34:14] ago when I gave my heart to him I've
[1:34:16] been behind the pulpit 33 years try and
[1:34:19] proclaim his unsearchable riches of his
[1:34:22] glory and I trust that God will make
[1:34:25] himself known to us all among us that
[1:34:29] every unbeliever will be saved and all
[1:34:31] the sick will be healed and the Saints
[1:34:33] the Lord is believing children will be

[1:35:05] amen heal you save you the Prophet said
[1:35:09] see here's the thought of future partake
[1:35:11] hidden manna I think it will be the
[1:35:13] eternal partaking of the revelation of
[1:35:15] Jesus Christ in the eternal ages to come
[1:35:18] how else could we begin to know the
[1:35:21] unsearchable riches of his own being all
[1:35:25] that we have longed to know all of our
[1:35:28] unanswered questions all that will be
[1:35:30] revealed it will be from Christ who is
[1:35:33] our life that we will receive it Oh
[1:35:35] sometimes we think we get to know him a
[1:35:38] little of him and his word down there
[1:35:39] and it's so good it makes us rejoice but
[1:35:42] one day when our flesh changes that word
[1:35:45] and he will become what we have never
[1:35:48] dreamed possible in other words if
[1:35:50] you're a believer it's only going to get
[1:35:52] better Church Alleluia if you enjoy the
[1:35:55] preaching now if you enjoy the songs now
[1:35:57] if you enjoy the Word of God now it's
[1:35:59] only gonna get better praise God because
[1:36:01] he's gonna keep her being more and more
[1:36:03] of himself
[1:36:03] I mean look forward to that by God's
[1:36:05] grace hallelujah now I'm gonna skip to
[1:36:11] the last few quotes on Wednesday I read
[1:36:15] this I'm gonna skip ahead I'm gonna skip
[1:36:17] past that okay let me go back on
[1:36:21] Wednesday I read this and I was trying
[1:36:23] to be real gentle with it and I'm gonna
[1:36:26] be gentle with it again today by God's
[1:36:28] grace it's a more mature quote the
[1:36:29] Prophet gives us for marriage and
[1:36:30] divorce and it's basically saying we
[1:36:33] need to get borned again in the baptism
[1:36:34] of the Holy Ghost it's like a marriage
[1:36:37] relationship you can't stay in the
[1:36:38] kitchen you got to move past the parlor
[1:36:40] living room and you got to go and
[1:36:42] receive life and you got to bring forth
[1:36:43] life right so that's what the Prophet
[1:36:46] says and he said each age refused to
[1:36:50] become the further part of him by having
[1:36:52] spiritual affair I'm gonna skip that
[1:36:53] word to become pregnant with further
[1:36:56] part of the word he said you understand
[1:36:58] the church refused to go further now I'm
[1:37:03] going down here so it is today with
[1:37:05] every one of them they failed to take
[1:37:07] that word they refuse Christ so I want
[1:37:10] to bring that to today is there
[1:37:13] something God's trying to lead you into
[1:37:15] but we're refusing I can't give that up
[1:37:17] I could never yield to that and yet you
[1:37:21] know it's God calling you to you that
[1:37:23] you see what
[1:37:24] happens when we refuse Christ we've
[1:37:26] refused the word we don't move on with
[1:37:30] God I hope everybody here wants to move
[1:37:34] on with God I hope everybody here wants
[1:37:36] to be so completely yielded to Christ
[1:37:41] that you can find your place you can
[1:37:44] find your position but see what he says
[1:37:47] here we must accept it and not refuse it
[1:37:49] we must go further in our walk with God
[1:37:52] I'm grateful where I've came but I want
[1:37:55] to go further I'm 36 I want to see what
[1:37:58] the Lord has in the next 10 years when
[1:38:00] I'm 46 by God's grace I'm so blessed by
[1:38:03] what he's done the last 10 years since I
[1:38:04] was 26 I'm so unsearchable to me I
[1:38:07] didn't know that but we've got to
[1:38:12] continue to accept his word what do we
[1:38:16] need to yield to him is there anything
[1:38:18] else we need to yield to them or are we
[1:38:19] completely so full of joy and love right
[1:38:21] now and we're a revival mode that's
[1:38:23] wonderful
[1:38:23] glory but if not then there's something
[1:38:26] needs to be yielded to we must not
[1:38:29] refuse what the word is telling us to
[1:38:31] yield
[1:38:32] so my last quote nobody I'm sorry got
[1:38:35] three three more the question is are we
[1:38:38] going deeper or further with Christ
[1:38:40] that's the question or have we refused
[1:38:44] his call to a greater intimacy that's
[1:38:46] what I was going to get to with the next
[1:38:48] scripture is the Fellowship of the
[1:38:49] mystery that word fellowship means
[1:38:51] intimacy like we just talked about
[1:38:53] kitchen living room bedroom
[1:38:56] are we refusing his call
[1:38:59] or are we commuting our lives more to
[1:39:01] Christ what I mean by that
[1:39:04] less cares of the world less care for
[1:39:07] the apps on your phone that aren't godly
[1:39:09] I'm not saying don't text people back is
[1:39:12] that what I'm saying I'm talking about
[1:39:13] the ones that don't have any spiritual
[1:39:14] blessing on them that's what I'm talking
[1:39:16] about
[1:39:18] like for me I got a quickie here for how
[1:39:21] much time I spent on Facebook so I've
[1:39:23] seen Facebook open up Bible studies and
[1:39:24] somebody got baptized that sister got
[1:39:26] baptized through that but I've got to be
[1:39:30] careful not to spend too much time when
[1:39:31] they're talking just keep scrolling and
[1:39:33] scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
[1:39:34] and pretty to them just stare at the
[1:39:37] screen and
[1:39:38] there's time I could be given to God
[1:39:40] somehow I do go on there to encourage my
[1:39:43] friends my old friends I put god bless
[1:39:45] you happy birthday I'm praying for you
[1:39:46] and I actually pray for them right there
[1:39:48] it can be a tool for God these things
[1:39:51] but we got to make sure everything is
[1:39:53] unit to him and God is getting the
[1:39:55] preeminence and everything we do
[1:39:57] remember this the fervent desire to
[1:40:00] please God the passion to know his word
[1:40:02] see how you have a passion to read your
[1:40:03] Bibles in the morning so you gotta have
[1:40:05] that the cry for reaching out the spirit
[1:40:07] all begins to fade we don't want to see
[1:40:09] our walk fade with God brother ran told
[1:40:12] us what to do and just once more in
[1:40:14] Shreveport Louisiana he showed us what
[1:40:16] to do when it begins to fade he said
[1:40:18] you've got to cry out to God and say God
[1:40:20] bring it back anoint me again help me to
[1:40:24] die to myself help me to sacrifice and
[1:40:26] yield to God bring me back my first love
[1:40:30] look what he says I've listened this
[1:40:32] yesterday I was driving the Graham house
[1:40:34] I thought all this is glorious I found
[1:40:36] it in a quote listen this if you haven't
[1:40:38] listened this lately he says this he
[1:40:44] said let's stand up to our feet
[1:40:46] everybody
[1:40:46] he said cry Pentecostal raise up your
[1:40:49] hands this is what I was saying my
[1:40:51] brother Brooks was here but at the end
[1:40:53] of the service remember I said you know
[1:40:55] that's let's pray out loud like it
[1:40:56] that's so we want we want everybody to
[1:40:58] feel so free you can pray out loud to
[1:41:00] God now some of your needs might be so
[1:41:02] personal you have to say those out loud
[1:41:03] but if you listen to a sermon everybody
[1:41:06] it sounds like everyone in the
[1:41:07] congregation just crying out to God and
[1:41:09] if your spiritual you can feel the move
[1:41:11] of the Holy Spirit ya understand like
[1:41:13] you have to be so free here and so unit
[1:41:15] to God that you can actually pray out
[1:41:17] loud and raise your hands to God a
[1:41:19] prophet tells you if you want God in
[1:41:21] your life you've got to you want more of
[1:41:23] God back in your life you've got to cry
[1:41:25] out and raise your hands and say once
[1:41:28] more hallelujah I don't know what to do
[1:41:30] but it's here let's cry with one Accord
[1:41:32] but if your cry is this if our if my
[1:41:34] cries is does it look like I really want
[1:41:36] more of God you might you might you
[1:41:40] might but you see how programs trying to
[1:41:42] bring the people you've got to cry out
[1:41:44] to God you've got to seek God for you've
[1:41:46] got to be sincere got to be sincere
[1:41:51] that's what we've been looking at even
[1:41:52] last week about be more sincere we have
[1:41:56] to be more sincere and brother branham
[1:41:58] is literally shouting at this listen to
[1:42:01] it if you have he's literally shouting
[1:42:03] saying what's more hard once more or
[1:42:06] listen to this the people are just in
[1:42:08] there hungry for God and see when you
[1:42:11] get hungry for when a baby gets hungry
[1:42:12] they start crying out when you get
[1:42:14] hungry you'll start crying out church
[1:42:15] and we've heard that so many times but
[1:42:18] when was the last time we got hungry for
[1:42:19] God and the pastor like me every pastor
[1:42:25] just wants to see revival in the church
[1:42:27] so we got to be patient but we still
[1:42:30] have to preach it praise God because
[1:42:32] there might be a couple of that want
[1:42:33] revival or it might be a time where the
[1:42:35] whole church ones revival but I felt led
[1:42:37] to preach this this morning on the
[1:42:38] unsearchable riches of Christ amen we
[1:42:41] can have the unsearchable riches of
[1:42:43] Christ it's what I've been preaching
[1:42:44] these thirteen years eleven and Akron
[1:42:47] and then two and Lima I've been
[1:42:49] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[1:42:50] Christ for these thirteen years we could
[1:42:52] have that but we've got to cry out for
[1:42:54] it if we've lost that initial love for
[1:42:56] God last quote let's send our feet this
[1:42:58] last one well the ground said see drunk
[1:43:08] on the spirit if the Holy Ghost can just
[1:43:12] pour into you until you're so drunk you

[1:43:20] you so drunk on the spirit do you forget
[1:43:22] your doubts amen

[1:43:29] might happen at your home it might
[1:43:30] happen here at the altar might happen at
[1:43:32] your chair there but if we want more of
[1:43:33] God you've got to cry out for it and
[1:43:35] you've got to get so filled with God you

[1:43:39] forget everything you're scared about
[1:43:41] forget everything that what who's gonna
[1:43:42] who's around you you forget about all
[1:43:44] that you get so filled with the Spirit
[1:43:46] that God starts flowing through your
[1:43:47] lips he said then cry once more goes up
[1:43:52] from the sincerity see sincere God I
[1:43:58] wanted a revival my life I have been
[1:44:00] colder on you I've I don't have a
