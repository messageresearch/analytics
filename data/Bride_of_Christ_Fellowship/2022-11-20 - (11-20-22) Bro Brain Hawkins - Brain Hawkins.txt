========================================

the message that he he brought forth is it okay if I don't say say that every time I say a quote so uh so let's uh get started in Hebrews chapter 9 and and verse 28. it says so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation and in Matthew chapter 25 we'll start at the first verse how many is looking for him how many is just waiting and watching and praying for that day to come I bet he's longing for that day amen so Matthew 25 starting in the first verse it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were Fullers took their lamps and took no oil with them now we know the oil represents the Holy Spirit right we know that so the lamp is a it's a symbol of body or the holder of the oil so also we could we could see that the lamp is God's word for did not David say Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so many people might have the word they might carry the Bible with them they might claim that they're a Christian well we've got the word in this hour we've we've we've got the word and nobody else has the understanding that we do but a lot of times what happens is they might have the word but they don't have the Holy Spirit to go with the word those two are inseparable amen they have to go hand in hand you can't have the word you can't have the Revelation without the holy spirit amen so you have to have the holy spirit amen so let's continue in the sixth excuse me Fifth Fifth verse it says while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry mate behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the Fuller said unto the wise give us of your of your oil for our lamps are gone out see people don't want to do the work that's necessary in this day they just want everything given to them they wanted every they want everything handed to them they don't want to put forth the effort that it takes hmm verse 9 it says but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough uh for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready what's that say they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour and that's so very important you know you don't know you know neither the day nor the hour We're in the the son of man cometh Nobody Knows the day nor the hour so if somebody's coming and saying well the Lord's going to come back in in 2022 before the end of the year we know that that's that's not a that's not a true statement because who knows even Jesus In the Flesh when he was here in his flesh he didn't know what did he say but only the father knows so when a man comes and says this is when it's this is going to be the time of the end we know that that's a false statement amen let's look to the Lord in prayer most Graces heavenly father just thank you so much for the privilege to be able to come here and Minister your word one more time but Lord as I stand here as a I'm a nobody oh God I'm just a a vessel in your hands that you that I I open myself for you to use father I pray that you just speak to my brothers and sisters this morning and just help them and guide them and Lord God I just pray that something would be said that would that would be have a changing moment in their lives not to say that brother Brian said this but it's the Lord spoke to my heart about such and such Lord whatever might be said I just pray that nothing that would be spoken here that I pray that it would not be anything contrary to your word or to the teaching the Lord God or just pray that you would just be with me and protect my lips or guard my lips and protect their people protect their ears Lord God but father I just pray that the truth would come forth and uh again we're just wanting to make a difference in somebody's life Lord we ask all this in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated yeah just kind of like to uh I guess you could say like a little bible study but uh just a bible study on the Midnight Cry so first Thessalonians in chapter four uh everybody knows that that's a uh the Rapture scripture pretty much does the word rapture does it ever appear in the Bible no it does not but the uh it alludes to the Rapture just the definition of what Rapture means that's what's in the scripture is being caught up caught away and uh from from this earth into the presence of the Lord so first Thessalonians chapter four starting in the 13th verse it says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren see he wants to instruct people he wants to give them the truth and that that's what we we want to do in this day we don't want people to be ignorant amen we don't want people to be ignorant of God but we also don't want people to be ignorant of the adversary's devices either so we want to expose him as as much as we can but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again we believe that right even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together and here's where it's the Rapture time caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord that's where I long to be wherefore Comfort one another with these words and we go on and and just to read this quote he says I have a tape or well it's a movie film that was filmed in Jerusalem where we were asking the Jews when they were returning back from Iran and many places a few years ago about five years ago of course it's much longer than that for us packing their loved ones on their back and bringing them off off of ships and out of airplanes and so forth coming back ask them the question are you returning to the Homeland to die they said we are coming to see the Messiah when you see Israel that tree putting forth its buds it's a great enzyme so when the Jews are coming back and searching for the Messiah this was back in uh I can't remember the year but uh 65 and earlier when the Jews uh excuse me I think it was what 1947 1941 47 I'm sorry I can't remember it I always get those mixed up but when the Jews became in their own Nation once again they had their own currency they had their own government so that constituted them to have their own government again so when they when they were all coming back to Israel when they're looking for the Messiah you know the time of the Gentiles is almost done with so this is the stuff that we have to pay attention to because when he turns to them the Gentile dispensation is done so he says or they said we are coming to see the Messiah when you see Israel that tree putting forth its buds it's a great enzyme the time is at hand when Israel becomes a nation and she's a nation today we see things happening that uh to the world it's just as blind to them as it was in the days of Noah see they couldn't see the truth that Noah preached back in back in the into deluvian age they couldn't see that so the same today the people can't see the signs of the time so it's just as blind to them as it was in the days of Noah but to we who look for Christ who's looking for Christ but to we who look for Christ the second time it's an enzyme that he is soon coming we see something fixing to happen and depends on what you're looking at now Noah Knew by the word of God that there was coming a flood by faith he saw it he knew that he he knew that was going to be because God's word promised it now Noah himself by faith did he have something there a script to read off of he didn't have anything he didn't have the word like we have the word today so by faith that's what he that's all he had to go on was by faith and and so how easily we dismiss how important faith is in this day that's what we have to hold on to by faith are you saved amen see there's power in faith but we just so under use it that we don't see the the uh the potential that that the power of faith has amen so again now no one knew by the word of God that there was coming a flood by faith he sought he knew that was going to be because God's word promised it now Noah himself by faith saw what God's word said but the world could not see it because it could not be scientifically proven that there was water up in the sky but no one knew it was there because God said so foreign he says that's the church the bride that called out today knows that the coming of the Lord is at hand regardless of how much we've been able to go in in progress and so forth and succeed in splitting of an atom and sending a radar message to the Moon that means nothing to the believer only a sign that the coming of the Lord is at hand we see Nations breaking in the Nations coming falling apart and the world coming apart and the church move coming apart he even went so far to say in the church move is coming apart so where do we stand now are we staying together are we staying unified or are we coming apart what is it that we're looking at what is it that we're putting our effort toward him but we see Nations breaking in the Nations coming falling apart in the world coming apart and the church move coming apart then we are taught that we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved but as these things begin to happen the church binds itself together Tighter and Tighter by the word of God it's a great day that we're living in amen everybody is looking for something whether it's people out in the world looking for pleasure the things the the pleasure of this world of what it has to offer or or we're looking into the word and getting a closer relationship with him making sure that we're ready amen making a preparation for in Revelations it says the bride maketh herself ready right so you might be looking today to a time that you get home to eat your dinner there might be a picnic this afternoon that you that you're going to take your family to there might be something another next week that you're looking for a neighbor to come or some friend but everybody is looking for something and as a group of Believers today assembled together we want to fix our thoughts our principles and things upon the coming of the Lord is that right looking for Christ who shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation to those that believe and are looking for him to come God here by the writer is inviting us to view this and to look at it the writer says here that we look for Christ the second time to see him as he is and now we know that the word is Christ amen so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in Hebrews 13 8 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore it's the word that we look to then for it is the expression of what God is you ever wonder what well what is God how what are his attributes well if you read into the word it tells you what his attributes are but you've got to look at the right thing and when God came in Christ he was the expression of what God was and whatever he was he ever remains because he's Eternal and he cannot change now kind of like to turn your attention to three minutes to midnight anybody ever search the the message or listen to the messages and all of a sudden brother Brent will make this statement he wants three minutes to midnight does that sound familiar to anybody he says uh do you know it could be possible before we leave this building that this Earth could be blowed up scientific says it's midnight right now time for it to happen all scientists and everything is shaking everywhere and remember the church goes home before that takes place then how close is the coming of the Lord be ready be prepared for we don't know what minute or hour he may appear it might be at any time we're receiving our last sign to the church of his coming now it's later than we think right so again in Matthew 25 and verse 6 it says and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh and going out to meet him everybody know what time midnight is right it's 12 a.m zero hour but in the scripture here it's not saying that it's the the hour of midnight now see that and it's awfully often perceived that it's going to be midnight you know 12 a.m that's not so because if if that if that was so then the other scripture that says no man knoweth the the day nor the hour so it's not a specific hour of midnight what midnight means is it's the midst of night it could be in the middle of the night so it's not a specific hour because again no men know at the hour except my father midnight also represents Darkness evil and destruction and we have so much evil and weakness wickedness and destruction in this day in this day this is the time of midnight because there's so much wickedness around us oh my it seems to be more evil than any other age of course in the medieval times they had their evil and they had their wickedness and they had all that other stuff back then but what is it in this day is it a different evil no it's the same evil it just seems like it's it it's more abundant so brother brother Branham mentions the the uh Minutes to Midnight he mentions that 70 different times so he believed what they were saying uh what is referring to is what the scientists were saying most of the time he says uh that there are three minutes to midnight uh there are places where he said that it was two minutes to midnight in a couple places he mentions that it was one minute but I I wrote I read a quote here uh just a couple minutes ago where he said it was midnight right now so a couple places he says it's midnight right now um I'm not going to say that he made a mistake but sometimes he he said it was three minutes sometimes two sometimes one and and sometimes right now so it varied which I am losing my voice already uh but I don't I don't know if you know what he's referring to when he says three minutes of midnight he's talking about uh with the scientists where the these people that get together in some kind of uh I don't know if club or I don't know what it is but it's a bunch of scientists or smart people that get together but uh it's a Doomsday Clock and this clock represents uh total obliteration by mankind uh it can go forward it could go backward depending on world events so it varies on what's going on in our day such as nuclear tension Global tension this Doom Doomsday Clock initially started in 1947 so you have all these you have the the top five world powers is uh the U.S China Russia uh Germany the UK so you have all the you have these five top powers and every one of them's competing to be the top power whether it's economic and or military weapons power they're all competing to be the top Nation so there is tensions we see that there's tension with with us and uh attention with Russia there seems our our relationship with Russia has been so up and down up and down we'll get along and then they argue they'll get along and then so uh there's there's nothing concrete as a as a true Ally with Russia because it don't make no mistake about it if they can get ahead and they'll lie steep steal cheat whatever it takes to get ahead and uh you know backbite whatever it takes uh to become the number one world power so we see that these uh the nations are competing against one another so the tensions are high you see right now with Russia and Ukraine tensions are high the U.S and China China tensions are really high right now well so you throw Iran in there and uh you know through the uh Afghan War and the war that we had for for years the tensions are still pretty high you know Al Qaeda and these different things tensions is still high uh North Korea you throw that into the mix too so we have all this going on because uh the the nuclear everybody wants nuclear weapons because they want to have the right to protect themselves uh if if the if the big nation starts picking on the little Nation what else does a little Nation have uh against a big nation so they want they want nuclear weapons too so they have a fighting chance for survival so the tensions are high but this this Doomsday Clock it started in 1947. uh initially so I have this thing here go I'm not going to read through because it's there's a lot of years but I'm just going to hit the the uh the Highlight so to speak oh now back in World War II we know that uh we we dropped a couple bombs uh on Japan um little boy and and fat man uh those were two two bombs that that uh pretty much started the the nuclear arms race because uh other nations saw the power that those bombs had and they wanted a part of it uh so that that kind of started a a a a lot you know brother Brandon talks about uh you know mankind has gotten so smart well I wonder what and they're able to uh split an atom and they made the atomic bomb and he says well I wonder what they're going to do with that well usually if it's in the hands of somebody of wickedness that's going to be used in a wicked way so kind of going through that 1947 we said initially started they said that it was Seven Minutes to Midnight uh and this was a couple years after uh after World War II and in 1949 they said it was three minutes to midnight the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb uh officially starting the the officially starting the nuclear arms race 1953 it went down it said uh Two Minutes to Midnight the United States uh tests its first thermonuclear device in November 1952 as part of Operation Ivy before the Soviet Union followed suit with the Joe 4 test in August this remained the clock's closest approach to midnight uh until 2020. so we fast forward a little bit to 1984. you know it it fluctuated uh the highest was was 12 minutes to to midnight that was 1963 1972 so we're going to fast forward to 1984. uh it was three minutes to midnight again uh further escalation of the tensions between the U.S and Soviet Union with the ongoing Soviet Afghan war intensifying the Cold War and so on and so on the Soviet Union and its allies uh except Romania they boycott the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles because the U.S boycotted in 1980. now the highest was uh 17 minutes to midnight which was in 1991. so I guess uh tensions weren't so tense at that time the United States and Soviet Union signed the first strategic arms reduction treaty and the Soviet Union dissolves on December 26th this is the furthest from Midnight the clock has been since its Inception kind of fluctuated a little bit 14. down to five minutes to six minutes and 2012 it was five minutes 2015. it's back to three minutes there it's uh concerns and amid continued lack of global political action to address global climate change the modernization of nuclear weapons in the United States and Russia see that's the same two parties that seem to be involved every time they're not brother Brandon say that Russia has has a bomb with our name on it so and the problem and the problem of nuclear waste now going to 2017. hope I'm not boring anybody so uh it went down to two and a half minutes so it's closer in in 2017 it's getting closer to midnight says United States President Donald Trump's comments over nuclear weapons the threat of a renewed arms race between the U.S and Russia again the same same parties involved and they expressed disbelief in the scientific consensus over climate change by the Trump Administration now we all know that there was a lot of tension with Trump being in office his administration being in office there was a lot of tension uh 2018. it went down to two minutes so we're getting closer 2018 the failure of world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change this is the clock's second closest approach to midnight matching that of 1953 in 2019 the bulletin reaffirmed the Two Minutes to Midnight time citing continuing climate change and Trump administration's abandonment of U.S efforts to lead the world toward decarbonization U.S withdrawal from the Paris agreement The Joint comprehensive plan of action and the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty if anybody understands that stuff then good for you but U.S and Russian nuclear and modernization efforts information Warfare threats and other dangers from disruptive Technologies such as synthetic biology artificial intelligence and cyber warfare now 2020 it's down to one and two-third minutes or a hundred seconds to midnight that is the closest we have ever been when brother Branham said that we're uh we were three minutes to midnight he didn't know what was going to be in this day but he he kind of had a foresight of or he knew it was going to be bad but he didn't know when he didn't know how bad it was going to be but he knew that there was going to be some kind of a destruction which I I think is imminent so at 2020 we're one in two-thirds minutes from midnight now this is due to failure of world leaders to deal with increased threats of nuclear war such as the end of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty between the U.S and guess who Russia you guessed right as well as increased tensions between the U.S and Iran along with the continued neglect of climate change announced in units of seconds instead of minutes this is the clock's closest approach to midnight exceeding that of 1953 and 2018. the bulletin concluded by stating that the current issues causing the adjustment are the most dangerous situation that Humanity has ever faced now in 2021 oh the bulletin reaffirmed the 100 seconds to midnight time setting again in 2021 the 100 seconds it deems to be the uh the same due to major events right so we have nuclear continues to be a threat U.S versus Russia North Korea testing and Iran wanting to get into the race as well and other nations are wanting to keep them from getting the nuclear weapons for uh apparent reasons of terroristic acts yo they just happen to be labeled as a terrorist country uh is everyone in Iran is every Iranian a terrorist no I don't believe that but you have your extremist groups you have them in the U.S you have them in the in in the UK you have them in Russia you have them in China uh One Bad Apple doesn't make the whole uh bunch of bad a bad Bunch right so uh I don't want anybody to think anything ill toward anybody uh so you know I don't I don't want anybody to look at our Iranians and look at them look at them bad I believe they're good people there too so there are people there that just want to live their lives and and you know enjoy their families just like what we want to do you know they they want to live uh in peace I'm sure they want to live in peace as well so it's not a good thing when there's war and you see uh friends family uh comrades falling because of of War but in 20 uh 2020 we also had the the the stolen election in 2021 January uh six uh of how they called that an Insurrection uh that it was a a deadly Riot now uh you could kind of take some of this you could take this info as as possibly biased uh so you gotta take account of who's writing it and where they stand because some people have a hard time separating uh their feelings from fact so they want to put their opinion into things so I don't think January 6th was quite the Insurrection that they're trying to say that it was uh because they call it a deadly Riot because there were five people that died this and that was the first time I heard that five people I knew that there was one person but I didn't keep close tabs with it either so if there were five people I mean it sure wasn't uh it sure wasn't as many deaths as it was in the The Chop zone or whatever they whatever they called that the summer of love you know when when there were several people that that died so that's the Doomsday Clock I don't know if anybody's heard of the Doomsday Clock or what it what it uh if you've looked at it if you knew what it represented or how they came to the conclusion of how we're uh 100 seconds to midnight but it's the closest that it's ever been and uh so we're just waiting to see his appearance the second time right so if you read back in Exodus we know the Pharaoh was given a a similar warning we see the signs of the time so we were given the warning uh before beforehand we read in the scripture we uh brother Brandon made his comments and just all the time we see the signs of the time that the that the uh not to be cliched because there were people back in the 70s 80s you know walking around with signs the end is near and people are kind of tired of hearing that the end is near because the end hasn't shown up yet as far as what they see so take that into account also because that's also in the scripture because people will ask well where is the coming of the Lord that you said that that is coming where is he so don't get into that condition just know that he's going to be coming and when's he going to be coming when people least expect him to be coming because people are going to get tired of waiting and then people are going to start dropping off they're going to not have so much interest in the word of God they're not going to have interest in in going to church so then they start dropping off because well the end was supposed to be near where is it they they've lost the patience to wait for the second coming but Jesus himself told us to continue to watch and pray for we know not what what hour we don't know what day we have no idea when he's going to be coming so it behooves us to be ready and just wake up every day expecting that day to be the day so again Pharaoh was given the same type of warning so I I kind of see it as being uh similar so let's turn to uh Exodus 11. I could see it uh kind of happening in the same see we were given we were given the warning that the Rapture is going to be coming and only the elect will be saved right so certain certain people are going to be saved and certain people will not because they were not ready and they ignored the warning so Exodus 11 in the first verse it says and the Lord said unto Moses yet will I bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon Egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor jewels of silver and jewels of gold and the lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of people of the people and Moses said thus saith the Lord about midnight about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne see there is no respecter of persons that he was even going to go to Pharaoh no matter what position he held and he was the highest in the land so it didn't matter how important he was he still fell into this same thing see God is no not a respecter of persons except those that love him from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant so from the highest to the lowest from the the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it anymore but against any of the children of Israel which was the elect shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel he puts a difference between the world and the elect he puts a difference from the nominal Christian those that say that believe but are a make-believer and the believer there is a distinct difference between the two so and in verse 8 it says and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that I will go out and he went out from pharaoh and a great anger and the Lord said unto Moses Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt say it's for my purpose I'm doing these things and Moses and Aaron did all these and and Moses was getting upset at it but don't be angry Moses this is the work that I'm this is my work this is my time to work right now you you just do what I tell you to do and and sit back and enjoy the ride pretty much and in verse 10 it says and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land and now see you we see the The Exodus Cry at midnight it shows an example of how the Rapture will take place because they're the people aren't going to know about it what's going to happen when all these people are gone there's going to be a cry like nobody's ever heard and see for the time of fulfillment had come the mistreatment of God's people had caused them to to groan and cry unto the father do you see so much wickedness are you not sitting shoulder and shoulder with the world are you not getting tired of these things are you not getting tired of all the wickedness and that you're surrounded in you just walk into Walmart you walk into Giant Eagle you walk into any store whatever it might be and what is it it's wickedness before your eyes there's this wickedness everywhere you just drive down the road and you see bulletin boards and you see half-naked women and you see all this evil that's there and you see this these these mockeries of God and you see all these different things out there we are surrounded by wickedness in order to grieve us to our souls amen but see the warning was given the warning was given to Pharaoh but we know that the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart but he uh not know if we didn't know that we would see that Pharaoh was so angry at the children of Israel that he changed his mind he said no I'm not going to let them go and he went after them to kill them right so Pharaoh completely ignored the warning that was given because the Lord hardened his heart so he couldn't really change it so he lost his his eldest son and everybody that didn't make ready that didn't heed the warning if they didn't put the blood on the uh on the lint on the doorpost they would have lost their eldest as well so it was those that were looking for the promise it was those that made themselves ready that came according to the instructions that were given amen see the warning was given the instructions were given to God's people it was up to the people to get themselves ready it did not it's not up to your pastor it's not up to me as a visiting Minister it's not up to your brother and sister it's up to you yourself to get yourself ready see we read in Revelation that the bride maketh herself ready the word will come to pass God will not see his uh uh his word will not return unto him void amen see warnings have been given for decades and centuries but we are receiving more warnings now we're seeing it in this day now now if people knew the day in the hour if they knew the specific day in the hour what do you think what do you think what would happen they would live any kind of life that they would want to they would live in lasciviousness they would be they would have malice in their hearts they would just be so full of wickedness until the day of until the last minute but God doesn't want his elect living like that he wants us to be ready now he wants to show forth he wants us to show forth that we are a witness of what he's done amen for the work that he has done but we know how the people like to push the limits until they have to do something people will procrastinate until the last second how many in here in school knew that you had a report due on Monday and you had three weeks to do it and you just left the whole time until Sunday night 10 o'clock at night I'm guilty but people just put things off so much until the last minute but we don't have that kind of Grace right now we don't have that kind of luxury to wait until the last minute we must get into the ark now we let's get into the promise now amen he says so will it be at the coming of the Lord there is many Restless people today that knows that something is fixing to happen but they'll never see him they know something's about to happen but they won't take the precautions to get into the ark so to speak this isn't Noah's no is our but you understand what I mean but it's time to get into the ark amen for he will come in the Stillness of the midnight not not a specific hour of midnight 12 a.m just remember that I don't know how many realize that but when when people hear midnight they think 12 o'clock AM but it's not that specific hour let's see for he will come in the Stillness of the midnight to catch away the little church that's longing and waiting and expecting to see him that's the ones he'll come and catch away many of the world who is living on the glamors and feasting their souls upon the things of the world will never know what happened until the church is gone into glory amen they'll never know where we went for he will come as a thief in the night and catch them away so we can say we're back again to the same place now we find out that this this expectations that he always appears to those who were expecting him always to those who are wanting to see him and I'm sure that that's the hope that's on our hearts today amen that's the hope that's on my heart so there's a little bit on the three minutes to midnight now I kind of just want to shift here a little bit to the new Heaven and new earth let's turn to Second Peter chapter 3. as I said some some pastors get a little line easy when when somebody visiting will come and preach something like the I don't think brother Jesse would feel that easy unless I'm saying something wrong which I I pray not I'm sure he'll correct me and I'm open to correction if if I'd say anything incorrect II Peter chapter 3 starting in the first verse it says this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before of the Holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming see here it is and they're asking where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so everything is just the the same thing day in day out day in day out you know so they're not saying that anything that they're getting impatient where is he you said he was coming but where is he now see if if this gospel is such a myth then why did so many people die because of it why are so many afraid of it now if this Bible is such a myth then why do people fight against us so hard I've never heard of anyone burned at the stake for a little Miss Muffet anybody ever here did you know the nursery rhymes and and things like that I've never heard of anybody being burned into the steak for something so mythical is that so such fictional stuff I've never heard of anybody any beheading for Humpty Dumpty I've never heard of anybody being exhumed uh for wee willy winky you know these these little nursery rhymes those are as myth as can be you know the the Disney fictional characters where's the outcry for something like that but it's a lie it's something made up but people fight against the truth so hard because they don't want it exposed that they don't want it to have preeminence in people's lives but see it's it's only now that we see the offenses uh come of other things like Dr Seuss people are offended over Dr Seuss I never even gave a thought of stuff like that with Dr Seuss of what the it's so far reaching of of how they're offended over Dr Seuss it's fictional characters how can you how can you get upset over some cartoon that some man conjured up in his mind it's not even a real character and then we turn to Harry Potter a fictional thing something made up in somebody's mind and it's accepted worldwide and how nominal Christians nominal churches out there how they accept Harry Potter if whether they don't have the discernment to know that it's wickedness they shouldn't be accepting any kind of Witchcraft anything that's remotely related to Witchcraft they shouldn't allow that into the church and here they have they have movie Nights with Harry Potter are you kidding me this is the stuff you should be preaching against but they hail it as something good oh the kids enjoy it they they loved Harry Potter well they should be taught to hate Harry Potter because it goes against the very fabric of God's word either they can't discern the wickedness or they completely ignore it verse 5. it says for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that what that then was being overflowed with water perished Noah right so verse 7 it says but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly man see before it was destruction by water but in the future it's going to be destruction by fire oh my verse 8 it says but beloved just talking to you be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise amen as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish he doesn't want us to perish that's why he gives men warnings so they can get in shape and get raped that's how much he loves us amen but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night right in the which the heavens shall pass away with great noise now pay attention to that where it says pass away in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat the Earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up the works the evil Deeds that's where that's what happened in the day of Noah right he abolished all wickedness he he killed it with the flood right so now this is going to come unto the fervent heat burned by fire and it's going to be the works that gets burned up it's going to be the evil that and the wickedness that's on this Earth that's what's going to be burned up with the Earth amen and the works that are therein shall be burned up verse 11 it says Sing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for looking for looking for and Hasting be Hasty for nothing don't make hasty decisions but in this one thing be Hasty it says looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God we're in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat nevertheless we according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth what righteousness no longer evil but we're in dwelleth righteousness that's the kind of atmosphere that's the kind of environment that we want to live in that's the kind of place where where a Godly person wants to be there's no more evil there's no more falling there's no more giving in to Temptation that's a place of paradise for the believer amen that's a place of righteousness amen praise be to God no wonder we're looking for a place to go because we're sick and tired of this old world verse 14 it says wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless every day being in Repentance every day being renewed in the Lord amen every day being renewed in your mind amen for it's in the mind that we serve Christ correct now see there are three stages of Grace I know this is kind of a tricky this is kind of a sticky sticky spot here because there are people that say that there are four works of Grace but I believe that there are three works of Grace three stages of Grace we know them as as justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost right so uh repentance what is what is repentance that's the justification right that's remitting past sins past sins if you sin this morning and you remember repented it's a past sin right it's not a present sin but it's a person it's now under the blood so that'll get us to uh sanctification sanctification I know this is kind of Elementary but bear with me here uh we're getting somewhere with this sanctification is cleaned and set aside for service right it sets our minds in order for holiness it allows us to accept the word it allows us to bask in the word it allows us to bask in his promise amen so the third one is baptism of the fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in us it's cleansed burnt out cleaned up and then put into service right so we know that in the natural we have a newborn baby a newborn baby a newborn is born in a water blood in the spirit right so the same thing in the spirit spiritual so we know the natural types of spiritual and the spiritual somebody being born again it's of being born again of water blood and spirit right so we have a a messages of of Luther Wesley Pentecost it's justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no more ages to come it's the end time there's nothing else to look forward to except for the coming of Christ amen but the same method that is used for the world to be redeemed is is the same type of the natural of the of the newborn baby baby and the newborn uh born-again Christian the water blood in the spirit the the justification sanctification and uh the the burning of the Holy Fire so the world where the bride will live will be in the same way right because all wickedness Shall Perish oh wickedness no there will be no evil dwelling in the bride so again justification let's say enter deluvian World Noah it's repentance with and and with water right so the Earth with the was destroyed by the flood that's the water baptism uh sanctification Christ coming and shedding his blood that's the blood cleansing and claiming it as his own amen Satan tried to give it give it to him without the purchase of blood if he was to worship him right we know that that he he was given the ultimatum if you worship me I'll give you these things but little did he not even think of that it already belonged to him so it it was eventually going to be uh he was he was it was going to belong to him anyways so Jesus knew I'm not going to worship you because I'm I'm already heard of these things but see it had to be uh so we know Jesus said get thee behind me for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve but it had to be bought right it wasn't going to be just given it had to be bought see Abraham purchased the land and they tried to give it to him uh they tried to give to him as a gift but he he refused it because why he said I will purchase it for it was an enzyme for of what was to come Satan tried to offer to Christ as as if if he did uh a certain thing but again it had to be bought Abraham refused to do it he said I'm not I'll not have it be a witness of you giving me things and I'm becoming rich because of what you've given to me but I'm going to take the step forward I'm going to show forth a witness of a true God Amen so we see which leads us to the baptism of fire we're already at water and blood uh the water in the purchase of blood amen so now we go to the baptism of fire to burn out all the filth it's the destruction of the world as it is now the defiled the evil and the unclean he says I will uh I will cleanse all germs all diseases all sickness even all spiritual things to make it ready for God to dwell in that's the new Earth that's the new spirit amen see the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both the world and the persons to live in it it's see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's going to follow through with the same thing amen so the framework will remain excuse me the old framework was not destroyed by water it was only washed off see the Earth Still Remains it was just everything on the earth that was destroyed it was being washed off it was being baptized wickedness was destroyed see in the same time the framework shall remain though it be burnt by fire it only destroys the sin that's on it just like a born-again Spirit-filled believer your body wasn't destroyed naturally but the evil inside should be burned out with the Holy Ghost and Fire making it habitable where God can dwell amen he had to baptize us with fire in order to dwell in us not a dilation we're not annihilated we're still here walking with the spirit within us right so the same thing with the world though it's not going to explode into Smithereens it's not going to be Annihilation but it's going to be cleansed by Holy Ghost and Fire the meek shall inherit the earth right not a different Earth one that's renewed by cleansing passing uh passing from one thing to another changed Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth right not a different Earth one that is renewed by cleansing but it's passing remember what we've read passing it shall pass away but it doesn't mean Annihilation it's passing from one thing to another change it's regenerated just as we are changed from sinner to Saint the Earth will be redeemed amen new Heaven and new earth just as we are a new creature of Christ the Earth the heavens and earth shall be new amen it shall be cleansed from all unrighteousness who let me get some in second Peter uh chapter 3 and verse 10 we've read it already but it says but the day of the Lord will come as a thief of the night right so the heavens and earth will be burned up uh with a great noise and we won't nobody will really know what's happening because it comes as a thief in the night so the heavens and earth will be burned up with great noise attributed to an explosion the Earth with fervent heat melting the elements nuclear and atomic heat are very intense and catastrophic up to the range of three thousand to four thousand degrees Celsius what is that in Fahrenheit you think 120 degrees Fahrenheit is hot desert hot how about 5432 to 7232 degrees Fahrenheit and that's going to melt the elements of the earth amen and is well able to do it at 7 000 degrees over 7000 degrees we burn we we melt sand I work at a glass factory we melt sand at 3000 degrees that is hot you stand next to that furnace you're going to feel that heat if you were to fall in the furnace you'd disintegrate in a matter of seconds I think by the time you even hit hit the hit the batch in that furnace you'd be disintegrated so could you imagine five thousand to seven thousand degrees Fahrenheit what can nothing is going to be able to stand in that kind of a heat it will burn up so does that help you understand of how hot that's going to be people think hell's going to be hot oh it's going to be hot all right so Satan and all his that are going to be burned up in that Lake of Fire they're going to be burned up into Annihilation amen praise be to God II Peter 3 6 it says whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water in Paris right so that was Noah and in Noah's Day the Earth was was destroyed by flood but it was not annihilated for we're still dwelling in it I know I'm recapping some of the things but just kind of give you an idea Revelations 21 and verse 1. it says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea wow something that hot that's going to lick up all that water that fire is going to be thirsty and it won't be able to quench it all the water on this Earth it won't be able to quench that Holy Ghost and Fire amen now see this is not the Millennium the Millennium is the time of rest the seventh day this is where we build houses and inhabit this is the same time as the great white Throne judgment for the bride is judged already now these I'm getting these statements from from the message this is what what brother Brandon taught amen so for the bride is judged already the new Heaven and the new Earth will be the Eighth Day for we know that the Lord rested on the seventh day right so it's the Eighth Day it starts over it's a new beginning this is where he is already gone and prepared the place for us brother van you want to come we'll go ahead and close I know just when it starts seems to start getting good right laughs but right now this is a terrying Time Matthew 25 and verse 5 said while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and it and this is a recap and verse 13 it says watch therefore ye know neither the day nor the hour I just want to stress that so much that no man we don't know the hour nor the day so he says watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh today people can't wait uh the scripture where it says the Lord delayeth is coming for the Holy Ghost to move so they manufacture to their own idea they have their own uh interpretation of the word whether whether the Lord the scripture means this the scripture means this it's going to be on such and such day it's going to be such and such year you know almost every there were so many people that were saying that it's going to be in this year and they specify a date in the year they no longer live they are no longer alive people that claim to be Elijah or or the two witnesses in this day and uh I think the last ones that I saw uh they're no longer alive so am I saying that it's a coincidence I I don't know what happened that's that's in God's hands so uh so are there still people alive that that have made those yeah there's still some people I've that have made those kinds of claims so it being far from us that we would try to make some kind of false claims like that we don't want to be found in that we don't want to make our own interpretation but we want to say what the word says no matter if if it hurts our feelings or not we want to accept what the word says it's the word that does the changing we're not trying to manufacture something and uh if we a sinner come in God's way he has every right to all of the reductive blessings amen if he comes the same way that you and I came they're they're they are able to receive all the Heavenly blessings amen oh again the the Lord is not a respecter of persons but he is a respecter of obedience he's a respecter of those that respect his word amen so if you would stand to your feet I'll say I know you're taught by a good teacher here and we know that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not in tongues or in other gifts is that right but the evidence is when you could receive the word it's not some system that we enter in but like I said whatever the word says that's what we want to cleave to that's what we want to hold on to if you know what cleave means it means when you cleave on to something it means you're not letting go no matter what Tempest may come no matter what storm may come you're not going to let go whether it's the tornado is coming you're not letting go with every fiber of your being you're going to hold on until you're taken somewhere else you're going to hold on to it so hold on to the promise no matter what storms may come no matter what Temptations come stay on the track of the Lord amen hey man I got a couple more things but I'm just going to go ahead and close amen I hope this was a blessing to you I hope I hope you you learned something today and uh not that I'm a great teacher but I hope something that was said but uh help you in some some way let's look to the Lord in prayer most gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know that your promises stay true and forever [Music] and Lord when we're holding on to the promise that you were going to come for those that are looking for you to come the the second time that you would uh that you would call those that are that are looking for you and take away those that are that are looking for your second coming but father I pray that each and every one of us are in that condition today that if the Rapture would I'm not going to say until tomorrow but I'm going to say today if the Rapture happens today for we have no idea what it is may we live our lives in such a way uh that if the Rapture would come today that we would be ready to go Lord not that we have time to get things ready in in our house in order tomorrow but Lord may all things be ready today so Lord if there's anybody this morning that has that has a need in their life they see something in their in their life that they have to get ready Lord if the if the Rapture happen today Lord may they not be hindered by those things because they have made everything right today I just pray that you would just meet them here today Father I just pray that they would leave everything at the altar not to pick it up again to to live the same way that they were living tomorrow but Lord God I just pray that they would bring everything to the altar every uncleanliness and every Wicked thing Lord I pray that each and every one of us would leave it here at the altar and let it be annihilated by the Holy Ghost of fire not to be picked up again but Lord God we want to live in such a condition that we would live a life that would be pleasing unto You O Lord father I just pray that that your word just would take a place in our hearts that the word would be anchored in our lives that we would forsake all worldliness that our eyes wouldn't be averted to the things of the world but our eyes would stay focused that our eyes would just stay fixed upon you no matter what Tempest May blow no matter what storms may arise no matter what Temptations may come that we would stay steadfast and true for your word is a lamp unto our feet and a light onto our path and may we follow that path that you light up for us oh God may we follow the leading of the Holy Ghost and may we receive that Holy Ghost Lord if there's any here amongst us that does not have the Holy Ghost Lord God I pray that they would get themselves into that condition that they could receive it for Lord they can receive it if they would just come in the condition of repentance and just confess everything and come before you and say that I forsake everything of this world that I forsake everything and I just want to come to you for there's no other thing that I want besides your word and besides your Holy Spirit Lord may they come into that condition and may you meet them here today and that they will walk out filled with your Holy Spirit oh God that they would Mark out as a new creature in Christ then all things in the past would be would be faded away then all sins passed would be Annihilator to God not to be picked up anymore no matter what the accuser of the Brethren would try to do to us from day to day may we forsake those things may they be remembered no more oh God so father I pray that you would be with each and every person this morning that you would help them and guide them by your Holy Spirit and by Your Word every single day and may we look unto your promise until the time if you're coming to call us away oh god father may we be pleasing in your sight I ask all this in your blessed name our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise be to God amen if anybody has a need in their heart in their life I'd be happy to pray with you but if you have something don't wait don't don't put it off if you got something wrong uh and you got to make something right just pledge to the Lord and be careful of a vow unto the Lord because if you make a vow you better repent but if there's something if you say Lord I promise to make that right later on so I could be in the right condition today then then you do it that way so if we were to get yourself ready as if we were going to have communion tonight I'm not saying that we are but if we were or if the Rapture was to take place today or tomorrow that you would be ready amen foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign
