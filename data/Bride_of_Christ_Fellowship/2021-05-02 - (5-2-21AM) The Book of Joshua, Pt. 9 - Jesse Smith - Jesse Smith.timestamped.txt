[18:26] i bought one copy i just want to flip
[18:28] through it looks like it's pretty
[18:29] pretty good pretty thorough and

[18:57] you know we'll take our young people
[18:58] through the church age book like that

[19:03] but that's just another third
[19:04] announcement there so if you're
[19:06] interested let me know
[19:09] also you probably saw that little sign
[19:10] on the door said just please try not to
[19:12] park
[19:12] our vehicles in the grass uh
[19:16] the owner has a landscaper mow this it
[19:18] used to be every sunday that was kind of
[19:19] like a bother because we'd hear the
[19:21] we hear the lawn mower outside of our
[19:23] window or windows rather
[19:26] but anyways if you can just try to keep
[19:28] your car parked so it's the bumper's not
[19:30] hanging over into the grass
[19:32] in case they ever come on a sunday i
[19:35] just thought that's a good reminder

[41:23] to get out of your way
[41:24] maybe receive with inspiration in our
[41:26] hearts lord god may it stir us up
[41:28] lord as you as you talked with cleopas
[41:30] and his friend along the way their
[41:32] hearts were
[41:32] burning without the holy ghost lord if
[41:34] we have the holy ghost today
[41:36] may our hearts burn lord as we hear the
[41:38] word of god speak to us today oh god
[41:40] refresh us in thy divine presence stir
[41:43] our minds by way of remembrance today
[41:45] and we ask all these things in jesus
[41:46] christ's name and the saints said
[41:48] amen god bless you as you're being
[41:50] seated praise god
[41:52] i do have some quotes i'd like to share
[41:53] today so uh today's actually the
[41:56] finally i'm going to get to this picture
[41:57] of what the jordan looked like before
[41:59] they
[41:59] uh they kind of damned it off a number
[42:02] of years ago
[42:05] this is kind of what it looked like
[42:07] years years ago quite a mighty rushing
[42:09] river
[42:10] there but we'll get to that a little bit
[42:11] i just want to pull the screen up in
[42:13] case i got any quotes i like to look up
[42:15] i can't find
[42:21] so let's take a few moments here and
[42:23] we'll preach on god's word today
[42:29] very happy to be in the house of lord
[42:30] today amen so we will look at joshua
[42:33] here we're part nine i believe
[42:35] um it's quite a rushing river there uh
[42:38] brother ram kind of dramatizes a little
[42:40] bit he said
[42:40] he said what a foolish thing it looked
[42:42] like for god to bring
[42:44] israel to this river in the month of
[42:47] harvest
[42:47] april we just finished april he said
[42:50] what a foolish thing it would seem to be
[42:52] uh for god to do that and no you
[42:55] remember
[42:55] no doubt jericho and everybody would
[42:58] would have had at least a little bit of
[43:00] the pressure let off because oh the the
[43:02] river's at its highest this year how
[43:03] they gonna get
[43:04] around that and we know they were under
[43:06] fear but but
[43:07] they knew also the river was at its
[43:09] highest and uh it was quite a
[43:11] quite an obstacle but our god
[43:13] specializes
[43:14] in overcoming obstacles amen he's the
[43:17] great
[43:18] faithful god and uh he delights we know
[43:20] he's so great you know
[43:21] he's so great he just sets up he allows
[43:23] these little obstacles to happen
[43:24] just to raise our faith right right he
[43:27] knows
[43:28] there's nothing he created all these
[43:29] things he know there's nothing that can
[43:30] stop him right
[43:32] we know he's he's he's undefeated praise
[43:34] god in battle he's
[43:35] he's he's almighty he's he's worthy of
[43:38] all praise
[43:39] and he sets these situations up church
[43:42] for
[43:42] our faith to grow praise god he wants to
[43:44] see us
[43:45] overcome the test of trial he wants to
[43:47] see us come through the fiery trials of
[43:49] faith
[43:50] and come out on the other side as gold
[43:53] amen now uh i'm not this is really not a
[43:56] future thought but i just want to bring
[43:57] this out you know before we get as we
[43:59] get started here
[44:00] um just as a lesson that you know as we
[44:03] go forward
[44:04] you know and if the lord tarries we're
[44:06] just going to have to
[44:07] keep growing in grace to rightly divide
[44:10] brother branham's quotes
[44:12] let me say like this i believe brother
[44:14] branham was a vindicated prophet
[44:17] with all my heart i don't dispute that
[44:19] at all
[44:20] but we have to recognize not every word
[44:22] he said was vindicated
[44:25] and that's where there's always less
[44:26] amens but that's true
[44:29] not every word he said was vindicated
[44:31] right he said i believe by
[44:33] by 1977 the earth america would just be
[44:36] tree stumps left
[44:38] he said i believe joseph is a prophet
[44:40] you know god will give him four
[44:42] or double times double everything i've
[44:43] got and he has yet to do one prayer line
[44:46] right and he said double times that's
[44:48] four times right
[44:50] he said your body's 80 petroleum
[44:53] now that's that's the human side but the
[44:55] divine side said thus saith the lord
[44:57] your will amen the divine said these
[45:00] seven seals
[45:01] are thus saith the lord with history
[45:03] with revelation with
[45:04] interpretation that's thus saith the
[45:06] lord amen
[45:08] and we know that was right praise god
[45:10] and he's a vindicated prophet but not
[45:12] every word is vindicated and that's
[45:14] where it takes a lot of maturity
[45:16] but that's what this joshua bride's all
[45:18] about maturity
[45:20] amen we'll get to that hopefully lord
[45:22] winning you this week or next week by
[45:24] god's grace
[45:25] this is what she's all about she's a
[45:27] mature army
[45:29] she's not a baby army anymore she's not
[45:32] a
[45:32] uh a fearful army anymore she's strong
[45:35] right
[45:36] all the voices have told her be strong
[45:38] be very courageous amen
[45:40] walk in the ways of the lord just
[45:42] meditate on the word
[45:44] meditate on what you know is the word of
[45:46] god and
[45:47] i'll bring you into the land amen and no
[45:50] man no woman
[45:51] no church no denomination no government
[45:53] will be
[45:54] able to stand before you all the days of
[45:57] your life
[45:58] just be strong just be courageous just
[46:01] believe the word just
[46:03] walk in obedience to the word of god and
[46:05] nothing will stand before your prayer
[46:07] amen
[46:09] hallelujah now i just want to lay this
[46:11] out
[46:12] that brother branham we we know and i i
[46:14] did it again today i was looking at some
[46:16] of the script or the quotes rather
[46:18] he went back and forth on the meaning of
[46:20] the promised land and we just sang about
[46:21] it
[46:22] uh i went down to the crimson river so
[46:25] there
[46:25] and and there's both types in that song
[46:27] i don't know if we caught that but
[46:29] both times there's a type of being
[46:30] forgiven and baptized with the holy
[46:32] ghost
[46:32] but then when i go down to the river to
[46:34] cross over and go to heaven
[46:38] you have both applications in that psalm
[46:40] did you get that
[46:42] i didn't catch it until right now you
[46:44] have both images of the river you have a
[46:46] river of well i'm going to cross here
[46:47] and i'm going to die to myself
[46:49] but then you have the river i'm going to
[46:50] cross the river and go to heaven
[46:53] right and so we have both types that are
[46:56] can
[46:56] can be used there now brother branham
[46:58] talked about the meaning of the promise
[47:00] and look at this i'm going to show you
[47:01] the quotes
[47:02] brother random called called the
[47:03] promised land the millennium
[47:05] in 1953 55 in 1960 when he preached as i
[47:09] was with moses
[47:10] he called it the promised land and when
[47:13] he preached the adoption series
[47:15] but then at the very end of his life he
[47:17] calls it the millennium again
[47:19] because there's multiple types for it
[47:21] right and so this proves the last
[47:24] teaching of brother branham isn't always
[47:25] the correct one
[47:27] right or or you could have because he at
[47:29] the end of his life he was still human
[47:31] and he could have said something which
[47:32] was his own opinion like martin luther
[47:34] king jr there in 63 right
[47:36] that was just he said that this is just
[47:38] my opinion he said i have nothing on it
[47:40] from the lord
[47:41] he said you got to be very careful what
[47:43] you're listening to
[47:45] the trouble is today we don't have very
[47:46] careful listeners
[47:49] right we and i showed it to you last
[47:50] week i showed you last week where
[47:52] the pastor of the branham tabernacle
[47:54] says you don't have to be careful you
[47:56] can believe everything
[47:57] on the tape that's what he told his
[47:59] church i just
[48:00] played it last week he said you can sit
[48:02] back and relax you don't have to be
[48:03] careful you know what they're doing
[48:04] they're opening themselves up to any
[48:06] kind of a spirit
[48:09] you have to constantly constantly be on
[48:12] guard because i might say something
[48:13] wrong
[48:14] i might hurt you right someone another
[48:16] preacher someone
[48:18] someone might hurt you right you got to
[48:19] be very careful right i'm not perfect
[48:22] i would never want to hurt you but i
[48:23] might say something wrong
[48:25] so you've got to be constantly on guard
[48:27] you got to be careful what you're saying
[48:28] amen to
[48:30] because over there in jeffersonville
[48:31] they're saying amen to everything
[48:33] and acting like everything is from the
[48:35] lord everything was not
[48:38] and so they're in church sin remember
[48:41] has
[48:43] 11 effect sin
[48:48] lost doctrine it's gonna be growing so
[48:50] see i made
[48:52] seven false doctrines out of
[48:53] jeffersonville i increased it to nine
[48:55] and now it's at ten
[48:56] it's growing as time goes on
[49:00] it just it's gonna keep growing until
[49:02] they root out the very nature or the
[49:04] very
[49:04] uh beginning of that sin they've got to
[49:06] go back where they left god
[49:08] if they're gonna get right with god
[49:13] and that's nothing but the truth
[49:16] sin always has an increasing effect if
[49:19] it's not repented of
[49:20] and look at all the brothers that have
[49:21] emailed them and try to get them to
[49:23] repent and they double down on it
[49:26] church we better be careful that god
[49:27] help us not to double down on any
[49:29] and of our mistakes right we've got to
[49:32] make sure we're constantly open to
[49:33] correction
[49:35] right here's in 53 he says
[49:38] when they got over to canaan did not
[49:40] represent heaven they had wars in canaan
[49:42] it represented the millennium so here in
[49:45] 53 the promised land was the millennium
[49:48] here in 55 and i believe the promised
[49:50] land represent the millennium
[49:51] a thousand years in the millennium
[49:55] and it may it may be a dual type now i
[49:58] can't see the millennium type yet but
[50:00] i'm growing in grace i can only see
[50:03] crossing jordan as a promised land of a
[50:06] baptism of the holy ghost type i can't
[50:08] see the millennium type
[50:10] right because there was no wars in the
[50:12] millennium
[50:13] and how many know they right after they
[50:15] crossed it was battle time in jericho
[50:19] people died right thousands of people
[50:21] died in jericho
[50:23] there'll be no death as far as well
[50:24] there's some quotes on that there'll be
[50:26] very little death in the millennium
[50:27] and maybe no death in the millennium
[50:32] now here's where i'm pulling this from
[50:34] now this is right
[50:35] this is four months but this is may 60.
[50:38] uh four months before he preached as it
[50:39] was with moses
[50:40] now canaan does not represent the age of
[50:42] the millennium
[50:44] so see how he was trying to grow he was
[50:46] he was gaining his understanding
[50:48] it only represents the age of the
[50:49] overcomer the dispensation of overcoming
[50:52] because in canaan they killed him burned
[50:54] and took the cities and there will be no
[50:55] death in the
[50:57] millennium but then he says in 64 there
[50:59] might be death in the millennium
[51:01] because the bible said a child will die
[51:02] a hundred years old
[51:06] but what does the promise land to the
[51:08] new believer he said the promise of the
[51:10] holy spirit
[51:14] praise god that's why i like listen
[51:16] brother brad i'm by growing grace but i
[51:17] also see oh he's human
[51:19] and you know church had always come i
[51:20] always get it at a time when i need it
[51:21] somebody that's going to try to rebuke
[51:23] me or something
[51:23] and i got these quotes to show them well
[51:25] what do you say about this they don't
[51:26] have no answers
[51:27] right because they got a they got an
[51:29] evil spirit they don't have any answers
[51:31] now here's the as it was with moses oh i
[51:33] got to stop here
[51:34] many people refer to the promised land
[51:36] to the millennium now brother brown was
[51:37] one of those persons now look at him
[51:39] he's so he's so convinced he's right now
[51:42] he said many of those people refer to
[51:44] the promised land as a millennium i just
[51:45] showed you quotes where he was saying
[51:48] that
[51:50] church he's a man
[51:53] it is not the promised land had wars and
[51:55] killings
[51:56] the millennium won't have any wars or
[51:58] killings it referred to the holy spirit
[52:00] the battlegrounds
[52:02] justification they left egypt there are
[52:04] three stages of their journey
[52:06] okay if you listen to that sermon you'll
[52:08] hear now look in 1965
[52:11] israel the old testament type type of
[52:13] the bride coming up out of the world
[52:15] marching the road to canaan
[52:16] or the canaan that we go to the
[52:19] millennium
[52:22] listen this prophet speak he said the
[52:24] friends of god he know what he was
[52:25] talking about
[52:26] he says the statutes and judgments this
[52:28] is moses which i teach you do them they
[52:30] may live and go possess the land
[52:32] which your lord your god given you that
[52:33] types are
[52:35] millennium so what five months before he
[52:38] passed he's back on oh now the
[52:40] crossing jordan is the millennium
[52:43] right so we got to be we have to be uh
[52:46] we have to be patient praise god
[52:48] and we have to grow in understanding
[52:51] hallelujah amen
[52:52] i just want to show that so you can see
[52:54] the clear examples how he would
[52:56] he would go from one he was convicted
[52:57] really really strongly this way
[52:59] and then he's really convicted the next
[53:01] way and then a couple years later he got
[53:03] a different understanding of it
[53:04] that makes me feel happy right because
[53:07] if god was
[53:08] constantly teaching his prophet god can
[53:10] constantly teach me
[53:12] amen praise the lord now let's get part
[53:15] nine here
[53:16] uh actually i'll change my text there
[53:17] sorry now we start
[53:19] this chapter by saying god magnifying
[53:22] joshua how many can say amen to that
[53:24] he's he's magnifying joshua in the sight
[53:27] as moses is successful in the sight of
[53:29] all israel
[53:30] in verse 7 he said this day i'll begin
[53:33] to magnify thee in the sight of all
[53:35] israel that they may
[53:36] that as i was with moses so will i be
[53:38] with thee now god had told him
[53:40] i'm going to be with you like moses i'm
[53:42] going to be with you just be strong just
[53:44] be strong
[53:44] but josh all those things with moses
[53:48] how the people ever going to respect me
[53:49] like moses and a lot of them didn't have
[53:51] respect like they should have
[53:53] right but this was a new generation they
[53:56] had a new chance to show respect to
[53:58] god's minister
[53:59] amen and so god said i'm going to
[54:01] magnify you
[54:02] in the sight of all israel and so
[54:06] uh robin says now joshua the new warrior
[54:09] only two left now that ever promised
[54:11] that ever left the promised land joshua
[54:13] caleb
[54:13] the new commander the leader army the
[54:15] second to place
[54:17] where a great man like moses stood it
[54:18] was no little task he says
[54:23] he said i think of a minister today
[54:24] that's called of god to step into the
[54:26] tracks
[54:27] where jesus stood what a command what a
[54:29] commission
[54:30] but each that's called of god is
[54:31] commissioned to stand in that
[54:34] same place he said i'll be with you
[54:38] even in you to the end of the way each
[54:40] minister is called to stand where he
[54:41] would the works that i do
[54:43] shall you do also each minister is
[54:45] ordained of god is command to stand in
[54:47] the tracks of jesus christ
[54:49] and perform the duties that jesus
[54:50] performed that's quite a command
[54:53] so church we have a commission now the
[54:55] pope is a perversion of this
[54:57] because he says he's standing in jesus
[54:59] instead on the earth
[55:00] well that's a lie he's not because he
[55:03] breaks jesus's word
[55:05] but there's some truth to what he's
[55:06] saying we have to stand
[55:08] in his stead we stand in jesus instead
[55:12] right joshua stood in moses instead and
[55:14] so preachers today
[55:16] we stand in jesus instead right
[55:19] as we are ministers of the word of god
[55:22] and it's no small command
[55:24] it's no little task brother branham said
[55:26] the highest calling
[55:27] is to be a minister of the gospel that's
[55:30] the highest calling in the world
[55:32] is to be a minister of the gospel it's
[55:34] no small task
[55:35] we're not lifting up preachers but at
[55:37] all because we all need god's grace
[55:39] but they have a task to do what jesus
[55:42] did
[55:45] joshua knew that the land was there he
[55:46] went first and found out that they could
[55:48] come back as a witness
[55:50] god called ministers ought not to be so
[55:52] stuffed out with theology
[55:54] but to have visit the land to where
[55:57] we're going
[55:58] bring back evidence of divine and the
[56:01] power of jesus
[56:02] christ to make known to their
[56:03] congregations that there is a land
[56:06] beyond the river hallelujah so
[56:09] brotherhood says a preacher
[56:10] needs to be able to go into the land
[56:12] like joshua right
[56:14] and bring back evidence here's evidence
[56:16] i've been over there
[56:18] i've got evidence that there is a land
[56:20] amen
[56:22] right brother branham went over beyond
[56:23] the curtain of time and he come back and
[56:25] said
[56:26] the only way to get there is divine love
[56:28] amen he brought us
[56:30] evidence of the vision right and
[56:32] evidence of it and he said i'll never be
[56:34] the same william branham again
[56:36] i'll always be a different william
[56:37] branham he said i no longer fear death
[56:40] now i have a boldness going to death
[56:42] because i know i don't go there's a
[56:44] little cloud floating
[56:46] i've got a spiritual body i've got a
[56:48] theophany
[56:49] and i can hug the saints and i'll be
[56:51] with them and i'll be with you amen
[56:54] thank the lord now church i've got
[56:56] evidence too
[56:58] i've seen god heal the sick bodies i've
[57:00] seen god seal
[57:01] or hear or heal sick hearts and i
[57:03] believe
[57:04] on the lord jesus christ we've seen
[57:06] people say praise god
[57:07] and you can say the same if you've gone
[57:09] over there you know what the land is
[57:11] like
[57:12] it's a good land amen hallelujah
[57:15] it's a good possession praise god it's
[57:17] good to live in that land
[57:19] there's so many blessings in that land
[57:21] amen the land of promise
[57:23] all the inheritance all the spiritual
[57:25] blessing church each one of us
[57:27] should be able to say but especially
[57:29] ministers that they've gone over there
[57:31] they know what it possesses
[57:33] and that it contains many blessings it
[57:35] has everything we need for our life's
[57:37] journey
[57:38] amen amen glory
[57:42] oh what a blessing now go to joshua 3
[57:45] 7.
[57:52] joshua 3 7 i'll read verses 7 to 13.
[58:03] i just want to uh read some of these
[58:05] verses now we read verse 7 this day i'll
[58:07] be beginning to magnify you verse 8 and
[58:09] thou shalt command the priests that bear
[58:10] the ark of the covenant saying
[58:12] when ye are come to the brink of the
[58:13] water of jordan you shall stand still
[58:16] in jordan so the priests were to go with
[58:18] the word the ark
[58:20] and stand still in the jordan right so
[58:24] everybody else can pass over so the
[58:26] priest had to kind of camp out
[58:27] in the word and that's something the
[58:29] preacher's got to live in the word right
[58:30] he's got to be right in the middle of
[58:32] the word
[58:33] if the people are going to cross over
[58:34] the preacher's got to stay grounded in
[58:37] the word of god
[58:38] hallelujah amen verse 9 and joshua said
[58:42] to the children of israel come hither
[58:44] and hear the words of the lord your god
[58:47] so now josh was repeating what god had
[58:49] told
[58:50] him verse 10 and josh said hereby you
[58:52] shall know that the living god is among
[58:54] you
[58:55] and that he will without fail drive out
[58:57] from before you the canaanites and the
[58:58] hittites and the
[58:59] hivites and the perizzites and the
[59:00] gergescites and the amorites
[59:02] and the jebusites behold the ark of the
[59:05] covenant of the lord of all the earth
[59:06] passes over before you
[59:08] into jordan i'm going to 13. now i'm
[59:11] going to read 12 2.
[59:12] now therefore take you 12 men out of the
[59:14] tribes of israel out of every
[59:16] tribe of man and it should come to pass
[59:18] as soon as the souls of the feet of the
[59:19] priests
[59:20] that bear the ark of the lord the lord
[59:21] of all the earth shall rest in the
[59:23] waters of jordan
[59:25] that the waters of jordan shall be cut
[59:27] off from the waters that come down
[59:29] from above and they shall stand up
[59:32] on a heap so they were gonna god was
[59:35] gonna cut off the waters of jordan
[59:37] from the waters that were above north
[59:40] that were flowing down
[59:41] jordan god was gonna cut them off now
[59:44] look at this joshua
[59:45] prophesied so how does god magnify
[59:47] joshua
[59:48] when joshua foretells what's going to
[59:50] happen and then it happens
[59:54] so god uses the spirit of prophecy in
[59:57] joshua
[59:58] to magnify joshua in the sight of the
[1:00:01] people
[1:00:02] amen right and he said this is going to
[1:00:05] be a sign
[1:00:06] the fact that god does this today is
[1:00:09] going to be a sign
[1:00:10] that you will have all the future
[1:00:12] victories amen
[1:00:14] church that's all it takes in our lives
[1:00:16] is one great miracle
[1:00:18] i hope i i hope you understand what i'm
[1:00:20] saying
[1:00:21] that when god does one great
[1:00:22] supernatural work in your life
[1:00:24] and there's something prophetic that
[1:00:26] comes to pass in your life you can take
[1:00:28] that confidence and know if god foretold
[1:00:30] this
[1:00:31] if god did this supernatural work he'll
[1:00:33] be with me
[1:00:34] all the days of my life amen amen
[1:00:37] when you've asked for something and you
[1:00:39] waited on it and god
[1:00:40] finally delivers it or something
[1:00:42] supernatural happens you can stand back
[1:00:44] and say look at that
[1:00:44] this is what god did god is with me god
[1:00:47] is going before me
[1:00:48] whom shall i fear if god has foretold me
[1:00:52] this if god prepared me for this
[1:00:54] if god put me through this he'll bring
[1:00:56] me through my entire journey
[1:00:58] i'm more than a conqueror in christ
[1:00:59] jesus glory
[1:01:02] so how does god how does god magnify
[1:01:04] joshua he lets him say something in the
[1:01:06] name of the lord and it comes to pass
[1:01:10] bill maher said if you're born again
[1:01:11] like joshua he said you can be reckless
[1:01:14] in other words you can have a lot of
[1:01:16] confidence you can have a lot of zeal
[1:01:18] that as long as you're staying obedient
[1:01:20] to the word of god god will be with you
[1:01:23] here's where he says it last night
[1:01:24] preaching on jordan now we get over that
[1:01:26] river it divides us it separates us one
[1:01:27] on the other side something's happened
[1:01:29] to you
[1:01:29] i'm sorry once on the other side
[1:01:31] something's happened to you now joshua
[1:01:33] and all's knowing that the command was
[1:01:35] great
[1:01:35] but having the assurance he could be
[1:01:37] fearless
[1:01:39] he could be we'd call it reckless as
[1:01:40] long as he was pointed the right way
[1:01:42] we might break up against the hill that
[1:01:44] would knock him backwards
[1:01:46] but he was headed the right way so can
[1:01:49] the church of the living god be reckless
[1:01:51] and fearless
[1:01:52] in faith if we're pointed the right way
[1:01:55] praise god see as long as our lives
[1:01:58] are pointing toward christ pointing
[1:02:00] toward holiness amen
[1:02:02] pointing toward faith in god's word we
[1:02:04] can be fearless
[1:02:05] we might run it he said look at that run
[1:02:07] into a hill and knock him backwards
[1:02:10] well the only way a hill could knock you
[1:02:11] backwards is if you run into it and try
[1:02:13] to
[1:02:13] crush the hill right because you
[1:02:15] wouldn't you wouldn't
[1:02:16] you just wouldn't fall down if you walk
[1:02:18] up to a hill you've got to try to run
[1:02:20] through it right
[1:02:20] that's the only way you'd fall through
[1:02:22] it well look at the faith brother
[1:02:24] says we should have such such a faith
[1:02:26] and such confidence
[1:02:27] we should be so so free from fear
[1:02:31] that any obstacle we feel like we can
[1:02:33] run through a troop
[1:02:34] and leap over a wall praise god
[1:02:38] hallelujah amen look at the faith god
[1:02:41] tries to write upon the hearts of israel
[1:02:44] on joshua and this young generation we
[1:02:46] got any young generation saints out
[1:02:48] there praise god
[1:02:49] you just feel i'm a i'm a holy ghost
[1:02:51] filled say i'm not of this whole
[1:02:53] generation that that worship moses
[1:02:55] i'm not of this old generation that
[1:02:57] doubted the promises of god
[1:02:58] i'm an overcomer i'm going to live in
[1:03:01] that land
[1:03:02] the prophet talked about i'm gonna
[1:03:04] possess the promises of god
[1:03:06] all promises of god to me are ye and
[1:03:09] amen
[1:03:12] that's what i am i'm one of those young
[1:03:13] generation believers praise god
[1:03:16] i'm not one of those old-timers that
[1:03:17] doubted moses and wanted to go back to
[1:03:19] the world
[1:03:20] no way i'm one of those that oh give me
[1:03:22] my mountain amen
[1:03:25] give me my inheritance let me see the
[1:03:27] will of god let me see the plan of god
[1:03:29] in my life
[1:03:30] let me see it working out and i'll be
[1:03:31] happy and thankful praise god
[1:03:34] i'm not a complainer can i say it like
[1:03:36] that
[1:03:37] i'm not a complainer when everyone
[1:03:39] there's when there's struggles
[1:03:41] i'm going to confess god's word amen i
[1:03:43] might whisper a few complaints but i'll
[1:03:45] say god forgive me
[1:03:47] i'm not gonna camp around complaining
[1:03:50] they complained ten times and god said
[1:03:52] because you've done that
[1:03:54] and moses because you magnified yourself
[1:03:56] and spoke
[1:03:57] against the people and you let the
[1:03:58] people get you fired up he said you
[1:04:00] won't see the land
[1:04:01] we're not complainers we're not exalting
[1:04:04] ourselves we're worshiping christ amen
[1:04:07] we are thankful and we're giving god
[1:04:09] glory and god's power is going to take
[1:04:11] us
[1:04:11] over we're going to obey every word of
[1:04:14] god amen
[1:04:15] we're going to confess all sin we're
[1:04:17] going to keep all sin out and we're
[1:04:18] going to confess all the promises
[1:04:22] you can be reckless church you can be
[1:04:25] fearless
[1:04:26] if you're pointing the right way
[1:04:30] we talked about that reckless song the
[1:04:32] reckless love of god people didn't like
[1:04:33] that well they didn't know brother ram
[1:04:35] said it
[1:04:36] they must have not been looking the
[1:04:37] quotes too deep right
[1:04:39] we can have reckless faith
[1:04:42] because god is with us as he was
[1:04:46] in the seven as he was with paul so he's
[1:04:48] with us
[1:04:49] amen john said so john said jesus
[1:04:52] is in the middle of those seven church
[1:04:55] ages

[1:05:04] we have nothing to doubt about it he
[1:05:06] promised we just got to recognize his
[1:05:08] presence
[1:05:09] and obey his voice amen amen
[1:05:14] he's the one that promised i'm not the
[1:05:15] one that promised that he's the one that
[1:05:17] promised that
[1:05:18] and he always backs up his word
[1:05:20] hallelujah
[1:05:22] for he said as i was with moses so i'll
[1:05:24] be with you i'll not fail no forsake you
[1:05:26] he never forsaken moses he never failed
[1:05:28] moses
[1:05:29] he will not fail joshua he will not fail
[1:05:30] us he'll be with us

[1:08:11] he's been faithful to me all the days of
[1:08:13] my life
[1:08:16] just this week we're driving on friday
[1:08:17] we come over this little hill on eastern
[1:08:19] road
[1:08:20] i just there's something i just kind of
[1:08:22] felt like oh you better be watching the
[1:08:24] road
[1:08:25] we come up over this hill there's an
[1:08:26] intersection right there a big truck
[1:08:28] pulled out in front of us i slammed on
[1:08:30] the brakes
[1:08:31] it's almost like i was ready for it not
[1:08:33] because of me
[1:08:34] but because of god's faithfulness amen
[1:08:36] we could just my wife and i could have
[1:08:37] gotten a car accident you know
[1:08:39] the guy standing on his brakes and he
[1:08:40] just kind of waved as we drove by
[1:08:42] i was like yeah that was jesus he
[1:08:44] protected me
[1:08:46] i was holding zion walking down the
[1:08:48] stairs last week and i slipped
[1:08:50] or there was something i forget what it
[1:08:51] was something like maybe on the stairs
[1:08:53] and i thought i was going to fall and
[1:08:54] all of a sudden i just caught myself
[1:08:56] it would have been awful it was like the
[1:08:57] top step think about my weight crushing
[1:09:00] his weight
[1:09:02] just think about that and i instantly i
[1:09:03] just almost started crying say thank you
[1:09:05] jesus you just saved my life or saved
[1:09:07] his life
[1:09:08] just little things like that how
[1:09:10] faithful is he he's faithful in
[1:09:12] every one of my footsteps amen or one of
[1:09:15] my car
[1:09:16] tire tracks can i say like that he
[1:09:19] guides my footsteps
[1:09:20] he guides my tire tracks he is the
[1:09:23] faithful god
[1:09:23] and it reaches so high it reaches to the
[1:09:26] clouds amen
[1:09:28] he deserves praise for that amen
[1:09:31] he deserves thanksgiving for that amen
[1:09:34] he's faithful god
[1:09:38] how excellent is thy loving kindness in
[1:09:40] verse 7 oh god therefore the children of
[1:09:42] men put their trust
[1:09:43] under the shadow of his wings you have
[1:09:46] such a place of safety today
[1:09:48] just crawl up under jehovah god eagle
[1:09:50] and just get close up under his wings
[1:09:52] just feel those wings sometimes right
[1:09:54] brother i'm still like this he said just
[1:09:56] get real close to that old testament new
[1:09:58] testament right
[1:09:59] just just just just curl real close up
[1:10:02] there
[1:10:02] and enjoy the wings of jehovah amen
[1:10:06] the old testament says in the new
[1:10:08] testament i'm surrounded by god's
[1:10:10] protection
[1:10:10] i'm surrounded by his power amen
[1:10:14] that's what he promised he told joshua
[1:10:17] the same thing
[1:10:18] as i was with moses so i'll be with you
[1:10:23] as god was with brother branham so he's
[1:10:25] with us amen
[1:10:27] because we're using his prayer class
[1:10:28] amen and god's he on the sick amen thank
[1:10:31] the lord for that
[1:10:32] it's just one example joshua 3 14.
[1:10:37] turn back there
[1:10:40] now i have some notes there as soon as
[1:10:42] the priest's feet touched the waters the
[1:10:44] waters stood up on a heap
[1:10:46] israel passed over on dry ground
[1:10:49] that's what we see in joshua chapter 3.
[1:10:54] now this is quite interesting notice
[1:10:57] god's power and his grace
[1:10:59] to prepare dry ground for israel's feet
[1:11:01] look how god
[1:11:02] pays attention to our needs
[1:11:07] if you took two million people across
[1:11:08] the river and it was muddy
[1:11:12] do you think they trip and fall do you
[1:11:13] think some of those little baby babies
[1:11:14] would trip and fall those two-year-olds
[1:11:16] three-year-olds
[1:11:17] but god is so kind he turns on his uh
[1:11:20] his leaf blower can i say it like that
[1:11:22] we had the leaf blower out yesterday
[1:11:23] he turns on his leaf blower and he
[1:11:25] starts blowing the river back right
[1:11:29] and he he just doesn't stop once the
[1:11:32] water's gone
[1:11:33] he actually pushes the mud back too
[1:11:37] and so the mud has moved back and i
[1:11:39] looked up yesterday on google i couldn't
[1:11:41] figure out how many feet you had to go
[1:11:42] down to get the dry ground
[1:11:43] under a river under river i don't know
[1:11:46] but you probably gotta hit clay or
[1:11:47] something like that
[1:11:49] and then you gotta just so he was so
[1:11:51] careful
[1:11:52] see he protects our footsteps he makes
[1:11:55] our footsteps sure
[1:11:58] now for us we're not crossing rivers
[1:12:00] today naturally
[1:12:01] but he gives us feet shod with the
[1:12:04] preparation of the gospel of peace amen
[1:12:08] and brethren says that is go anywhere go
[1:12:10] any place for the word of god
[1:12:13] so god is guiding your steps god wants
[1:12:15] to tell us to go witness to someone or
[1:12:17] go
[1:12:18] go pray for someone or go bless someone
[1:12:20] with a love offering or something
[1:12:22] he's guiding our steps and and our tire
[1:12:24] tracks as we said
[1:12:25] he's guiding us along and he's going to
[1:12:27] make sure every place we put our feet
[1:12:30] is protected by him he's going to make
[1:12:32] our every step that we take
[1:12:34] he's going to make it sure amen and i'll
[1:12:37] say this
[1:12:38] if we just let the word go first amen
[1:12:41] it was a thousand feet a thousand feet
[1:12:43] just keep the word ahead
[1:12:45] just make sure you're behind the word
[1:12:48] don't get in front of the word
[1:12:49] just make sure the word's going before
[1:12:51] you and every step you take will be
[1:12:53] absolute sure amen
[1:12:55] there'll be no question about it because
[1:12:57] the word already went before me
[1:12:59] amen i didn't move until i saw the word
[1:13:02] go first amen
[1:13:04] that's right
[1:13:08] now think about this brother i i think i
[1:13:10] have this quote here from brother brown
[1:13:11] later
[1:13:11] brother brown said where how did the how
[1:13:13] did the water stop
[1:13:14] brother bram said you had water millions
[1:13:16] of gallons flowing in
[1:13:18] from the mediterranean sea how did he
[1:13:21] just all make it stop because it's
[1:13:22] still flowing right so the water's still
[1:13:24] flowing but he kind of stops it right
[1:13:25] there
[1:13:28] right how did he do that we don't know
[1:13:32] he's just like he said sun stands still
[1:13:34] one of those paradoxes right
[1:13:36] because he controls nature he's able
[1:13:38] just to slow it down right there
[1:13:41] it doesn't get backed up it doesn't boil
[1:13:42] over the edges right we would think
[1:13:44] it would flow over overflow on that on
[1:13:46] the ground
[1:13:47] nope it just stays right there and he
[1:13:49] actually pushes it up and builds it up
[1:13:51] and i don't know if he stopped the
[1:13:52] mediterranean sea i don't know what he
[1:13:54] did
[1:13:55] but he's able to hand it he's able to
[1:13:56] stop it there to protect his covenant
[1:13:59] people amen
[1:14:00] oh church he'll do anything he'll cross
[1:14:03] heaven and earth
[1:14:03] to protect his people under his covenant
[1:14:07] praise god
[1:14:08] he did it with shadrach meshach and
[1:14:10] abednego he crossed heaven and earth
[1:14:12] and he went down with him not outside
[1:14:14] the fire he joined them in the fire amen
[1:14:16] god is joining us today god is with you
[1:14:19] today
[1:14:20] he wants to stay with you today if
[1:14:21] you'll just obey his word
[1:14:28] i love that as soon as the feet touched
[1:14:31] the water moved back why because god was
[1:14:34] blessing
[1:14:35] every step that they took
[1:14:38] he said he said every place the soul of
[1:14:40] your foot goes
[1:14:42] you've got it it's your possession amen
[1:14:45] and he proved it there as soon as the
[1:14:47] first priest put his foot in there
[1:14:48] the water moved back because footsteps
[1:14:51] are possession
[1:14:52] amen that's right now i like
[1:14:56] adam clark i'm just i'm gonna try to get
[1:14:57] more references right because we don't
[1:14:59] want to be plagiarists
[1:15:01] i record that video this week anyway
[1:15:02] it's gonna take me a couple weeks to get
[1:15:03] it out about larkin and
[1:15:05] brandon brother ram did not plagiarize
[1:15:06] him he just forgot on future home but
[1:15:08] i didn't cite anybody on the future home
[1:15:10] that i could find so he just forgot that
[1:15:12] doesn't mean he's a plagiarist he just
[1:15:13] forgot
[1:15:14] remember uh he said the brotherham said
[1:15:16] justification i think seven times in
[1:15:18] that sermon
[1:15:19] he said sanctification like 13 and he
[1:15:21] said baptism in the holy ghost
[1:15:22] almost 30 times in that sermon larkin
[1:15:25] clarence larkin never taught the three
[1:15:27] works of grace
[1:15:29] so brother adam's excitement was wow the
[1:15:31] earth goes through three phases
[1:15:33] the three works of grace just like a
[1:15:35] christian goes through justification
[1:15:36] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:39] he brought out lots
[1:15:40] he brought out at least eight of
[1:15:42] larkin's details
[1:15:43] but that's not what he was excited about
[1:15:45] he was excited about
[1:15:47] the revelation he preached all of his
[1:15:48] life the three works of grace
[1:15:50] was again vindicated and he said he
[1:15:53] lived off that revelation for two weeks
[1:15:57] and that's what i hope church i hope
[1:15:59] some sermon you've heard from our church
[1:16:01] or something brother branham somewhere
[1:16:03] has fed you for weeks on end oh
[1:16:06] that's right that's right hallelujah
[1:16:10] happens all the time if you're if you're
[1:16:11] in tune with the holy spirit it'll
[1:16:13] happen all the time
[1:16:14] but just keep going back to that you
[1:16:15] want to listen to that one again yeah i
[1:16:16] want to listen to that one again
[1:16:19] adam clark said god leaves no doubt as
[1:16:21] to his presence
[1:16:22] power and love for israel
[1:16:25] now i like what he said here this jordan
[1:16:28] river seems
[1:16:29] more miraculous uh than the red sea
[1:16:33] crossing
[1:16:34] because there's no wind recorded in this
[1:16:36] miracle
[1:16:38] the bible said in exodus 14 god caused a
[1:16:41] great southern wind to come up
[1:16:44] and everybody you know all the jews and
[1:16:46] moses they feel this wind
[1:16:49] and and the waters move back but when
[1:16:52] joshua went across there was no wind
[1:16:54] all there was was power of god amen
[1:16:58] just the holy ghost i said this the
[1:17:00] angel of the lord amen
[1:17:02] because as soon as they stepped in they
[1:17:04] didn't feel any wind
[1:17:05] just the power of their steps the power
[1:17:08] of their faith amen
[1:17:10] the power of the ark can i say like that
[1:17:12] the power of the word
[1:17:14] move the waters back amen and although
[1:17:17] the waters weren't as great
[1:17:18] there was no wind it looked like there
[1:17:20] was no assistance from nature
[1:17:22] it was the power of the word amen
[1:17:25] the rabbi said the ark is the word
[1:17:28] because the law
[1:17:29] was in the ark it represents the
[1:17:31] revealed word of the hour amen
[1:17:34] oh there's power in this word today
[1:17:36] praise god
[1:17:37] they'll drive back all your obstacles
[1:17:39] that's exactly right god was going to
[1:17:44] make it sure
[1:17:45] he said this day i'm going to magnify
[1:17:48] joshua in your sight
[1:17:49] as i was with moses so will i be with
[1:17:51] you
[1:17:52] by this miracle now in verses
[1:17:55] 14 to 17. as soon as
[1:17:59] that's what i was mentioning earlier i
[1:18:00] kind of got ahead of myself as soon as
[1:18:02] the feet touched the waters the water
[1:18:03] stood up
[1:18:04] israel passed over on dry ground because
[1:18:06] god said every place the soul of your
[1:18:08] foot shall tread upon
[1:18:09] that have i given unto you as i said
[1:18:12] unto moses now that church they had to
[1:18:15] obey right the priests had to obey
[1:18:18] the priests had to take the word and
[1:18:20] move based upon the word
[1:18:23] right and church as soon as you do that
[1:18:24] as soon as i do that many times
[1:18:26] the obstacle will start moving back if
[1:18:29] we just obey the word first
[1:18:31] is that right whether we're sick we just
[1:18:34] gotta obey the word
[1:18:35] whether we got a a debate coming up or
[1:18:37] whether we have a discussion coming up
[1:18:39] or confront somebody's sin
[1:18:41] we've got to move with the word first
[1:18:43] right and things will get better
[1:18:45] right as we move on with the word praise
[1:18:48] god but you got to step with the word
[1:18:50] and as soon as you put the word first it
[1:18:52] kind of seems like
[1:18:53] everything's going to clear up pretty
[1:18:55] good amen
[1:18:57] hallelujah the feet in the river
[1:19:01] the feet just just stepping into the
[1:19:03] promise of god
[1:19:04] just stepping into the promise of god
[1:19:06] just going forward with the word of god
[1:19:09] will cause your troubles to move back
[1:19:12] that's right so true so true now this is
[1:19:15] a beautiful message
[1:19:16] but then it goes through all the
[1:19:17] memorials god gave you know abraham
[1:19:19] moses and
[1:19:20] he talks about joshua now joshua his
[1:19:23] word was at stake see because he was
[1:19:25] prophesied
[1:19:26] he prophesied to the people his word was
[1:19:28] at stake
[1:19:30] he must cross over this river it looked
[1:19:32] like it picked the worst time that could
[1:19:34] ever be thought
[1:19:36] it was the month of april that's when
[1:19:37] the snow was melting in judea coming
[1:19:39] down through the mountains
[1:19:40] and then old jordan is muddy and spread
[1:19:42] plum in the fields
[1:19:43] to water the fields of jordan and it
[1:19:46] looked like if it would have been
[1:19:48] mathematical or educational or
[1:19:50] scientific
[1:19:51] he picked the worst time in all the year
[1:19:53] to cross jordan
[1:19:54] but the blessing was joshua didn't pick
[1:19:57] this time
[1:19:57] god picked this time right you and i we
[1:20:01] don't pick some of our trials we go
[1:20:02] through
[1:20:03] god allows them to happen amen and we
[1:20:06] must we must remember some of these
[1:20:07] things
[1:20:07] i didn't ask for you didn't ask for some
[1:20:10] of the trials you got
[1:20:11] they just come upon you well that just
[1:20:13] means god brought you to a jordan river
[1:20:15] amen
[1:20:16] and he's going to show his power and
[1:20:18] he's going to move the obstacle amen
[1:20:20] god brought you there just like god
[1:20:22] brought them there
[1:20:24] god you don't over the events of your
[1:20:26] life god orders the events of your life
[1:20:29] praise god see because god likes to take
[1:20:33] those time
[1:20:33] those kind of times to prove that he's
[1:20:36] god
[1:20:38] god likes to get bring you to difficult
[1:20:41] obstacles that he can prove how great he
[1:20:43] is to you
[1:20:46] maybe this will change the way we look
[1:20:48] at some of our trials
[1:20:50] praise god and men of god who believe
[1:20:53] god and know what god has promised
[1:20:55] is not afraid to do it because god will
[1:20:57] stick with his word
[1:20:58] just as certain as he is god
[1:21:04] he said first take the ark and go
[1:21:06] forward when those priests feet touch
[1:21:07] the jordan
[1:21:08] no matter how wild she was and how she
[1:21:10] was swelled it give away to god's
[1:21:12] eternal word
[1:21:14] for the word was in the ark
[1:21:18] said give away right he said give away
[1:21:20] the obstacle has to give away
[1:21:22] when you speak the word of god praise
[1:21:24] the lord
[1:21:26] that depression has to give way when you
[1:21:29] start worshiping jesus with joy amen
[1:21:32] praise god
[1:21:34] that doubt or that fear that has to move
[1:21:37] away
[1:21:37] as soon as you start praising jesus and
[1:21:40] tell tell him what a great god he is
[1:21:42] amen it has to move away whenever you
[1:21:45] put the word
[1:21:46] up against the obstacle the word is
[1:21:48] going to win amen
[1:21:50] you think the word's going to lose the
[1:21:52] word came to win amen
[1:21:54] it's the only thing that can win praise
[1:21:56] god
[1:21:58] it had to give way like brother said
[1:22:01] house of hell give way
[1:22:03] in the name of william branham in the
[1:22:06] name of jesus christ
[1:22:08] house of hell give way to the name of
[1:22:11] jesus amen
[1:22:13] and as long as there's faith in that
[1:22:14] word and as long as it's god's word
[1:22:16] spoken in god's season
[1:22:18] it's going to move the obstacles god is
[1:22:21] the mighty warrior amen
[1:22:25] he said heaven and earth will pass away
[1:22:27] jesus said but my word
[1:22:29] will never pass away so joshua knowing
[1:22:32] this
[1:22:32] that this word must rest upon god's word
[1:22:35] his word must rest upon god's word
[1:22:37] he put god's word first
[1:22:40] i wish you sick people god bless you
[1:22:42] brother jose
[1:22:43] it's hard being sick i wish when i was
[1:22:46] sick i'd speak god's word better
[1:22:49] wish you sick people here tonight would
[1:22:50] do that do what
[1:22:52] put god's word first
[1:22:56] he said put god's word with your
[1:22:58] confession
[1:22:59] put your confession you believe it and
[1:23:02] set it out there and call those things
[1:23:03] that are not
[1:23:04] as though they were then we're marching
[1:23:07] on do it that way
[1:23:08] god's word will take you through
[1:23:12] oh hallelujah church think about the
[1:23:15] obstacle you're going through
[1:23:17] think about the obstacle you're facing
[1:23:19] if you and i put the word of god
[1:23:21] first make sure it's first and make our
[1:23:24] confession match the word of god
[1:23:26] the word is going to go through even
[1:23:28] though it looks like it's impossible
[1:23:30] the word is going to go through because
[1:23:32] it's it's undefeatable
[1:23:34] praise god it's all powerful amen it is
[1:23:36] god's will
[1:23:37] it is god's desire and god's will must
[1:23:39] be done
[1:23:40] amen god's gonna take us through
[1:23:44] give way to the word of god
[1:23:48] hallelujah doubt fear
[1:23:51] right greed uncertainty sickness
[1:23:54] whatever it is
[1:23:55] it must give way to the word of god
[1:24:01] as the priest's feet touched the door
[1:24:02] and she just rolled back from side to
[1:24:04] side
[1:24:05] and the water stayed to realize the
[1:24:08] roaring of that river would have brought
[1:24:09] forth a bank there
[1:24:11] and 20 minutes time would have been as
[1:24:13] big as some of these modern dams that we
[1:24:16] got
[1:24:16] in colorado boulder dam out there way
[1:24:19] that
[1:24:20] was coming out of the mountains with
[1:24:21] great force she's sweeping through those
[1:24:24] valleys and then
[1:24:25] two million foot men with women and
[1:24:28] children
[1:24:28] could pass through there or
[1:24:31] what they gonna do uh what could you do
[1:24:34] with
[1:24:35] water right you guys went to the
[1:24:36] waterfall last weekend right on your

[1:24:44] and they said how many millions of
[1:24:46] gallons go down the waterfall every day
[1:24:48] or every minute and god said i'm
[1:24:51] stopping

[1:24:54] i'm stopping millions and millions of
[1:24:56] gallons

[1:25:08] amen god will stop god will stop

[1:25:15] whether you don't wear a mask at all
[1:25:17] god will stop it praise god because god
[1:25:19] is great and he's merciful
[1:25:21] it's all about the plan of god amen it's
[1:25:24] his plan
[1:25:27] if god can stop millions and millions
[1:25:28] and billions of gallons of water
[1:25:30] he can stop our mind battles praise god
[1:25:34] he can stop our financial trouble
[1:25:37] because he's god
[1:25:39] just take the word and go forward
[1:25:44] he said probably four or five hours do
[1:25:47] you think that river would have filled
[1:25:48] up but god
[1:25:49] stayed the stream he said stay in the
[1:25:51] streams
[1:25:52] he said oh i love that and she laid
[1:25:55] there until they passed over
[1:25:56] he said stream you just stay right there

[1:29:35] but it's a little different in this case
[1:29:37] because we didn't see jesus in a vision
[1:29:39] right but god did bring us through a
[1:29:41] great river
[1:29:43] right sister right great faith you had
[1:29:45] that whole situation
[1:29:47] but church god does this great miracle
[1:29:49] and then he tells them
[1:29:50] build a memorial like this one from iwo
[1:29:54] jima
[1:29:54] that was the second maokai told me the
[1:29:56] second flag they raised at iwo jima
[1:30:00] and this was erected to honor all the
[1:30:03] fallen marines since the 1775 i think
[1:30:06] was but it was specifically for that
[1:30:08] picture from iwo jima
[1:30:10] where they have tens of thousands of
[1:30:12] soldiers died on the beaches right
[1:30:14] malcolm
[1:30:14] was it thousands tens of thousands
[1:30:19] yeah those men just walked into death
[1:30:22] they just
[1:30:23] they got the boats and just walked into
[1:30:24] death and it wasn't an easy battle
[1:30:27] right it was months it was weeks of
[1:30:29] taking weeks of battles
[1:30:31] maybe months until they were finally
[1:30:32] able to say we've taken over this
[1:30:35] this island and because they got victory
[1:30:37] on the island they won the war
[1:30:39] amen church if god gives us little
[1:30:42] victories
[1:30:42] you know we're going to win the war
[1:30:44] praise god
[1:30:45] i didn't hear you if god gave us these
[1:30:47] victories in our lives
[1:30:49] and and times that we get the victory
[1:30:51] you know the rest of the battle
[1:30:53] is going to be now praise god
[1:30:56] because god doesn't lose
[1:30:59] praise the lord so see in joshua 4 they
[1:31:03] get this great victory in joshua 3.
[1:31:09] now i'm not starting a memorial doctrine
[1:31:11] okay so just say you know
[1:31:13] i'm not starting to but i just think i
[1:31:14] may want to do that i might do that
[1:31:16] we'll see because i just uh here
[1:31:20] here's why i mean that i don't want to
[1:31:21] forget what god has done
[1:31:23] and that morning that sermon my whole
[1:31:24] message was on god had uh
[1:31:27] god was taking sides with jesus you know
[1:31:29] the brother man was taking sides with
[1:31:30] jesus
[1:31:30] it was all on how god's those little
[1:31:32] book of acts churches like
[1:31:34] the the church at philippi and we were
[1:31:37] one of those little book of acts
[1:31:38] churches that's what the sermon was
[1:31:39] about
[1:31:40] i kind of gave the background of how the
[1:31:42] philippian church started
[1:31:43] they cast out devils you know lydia
[1:31:45] there was the first convert you know
[1:31:46] lydia
[1:31:47] i said we are just one of those book of
[1:31:49] acts churches
[1:31:51] and then we have a need there we have
[1:31:52] one of these great mighty rivers
[1:31:55] and we apply the word of god the word
[1:31:57] goes before us
[1:31:58] and gains a great victory for us oh
[1:32:01] hallelujah praise god
[1:32:03] amen now joshua 4
[1:32:06] 1-9 we see in this that god commands a
[1:32:09] memorial of 12 stones
[1:32:11] the size a man could carry on his
[1:32:13] shoulder
[1:32:14] as a sign of his power now johnny is a
[1:32:16] great big man
[1:32:18] right but we're not all strong like him
[1:32:21] so picture about
[1:32:22] what size could he put of a stone on his
[1:32:25] shoulder
[1:32:26] i remember israel wasn't very big either
[1:32:27] right saul was the biggest one of all
[1:32:31] they were gonna and god said i've done a
[1:32:33] great thing here
[1:32:35] i've held back the waters i brought all
[1:32:38] my people through
[1:32:39] i don't want you to forget what i've
[1:32:41] done for you
[1:32:43] church because we're we're human we're
[1:32:45] gonna forget after a while
[1:32:48] right we remember how god healed banging
[1:32:50] who is dead but then we'll have a little
[1:32:51] trouble
[1:32:52] and we'll forget all about that what
[1:32:54] didn't god just do something great
[1:32:58] you ever feel like israel sometimes god
[1:33:00] brought me through the red sea but i
[1:33:01] forgot what he you know i forgot about
[1:33:02] that the next child i had
[1:33:03] now i need bread now i need water now
[1:33:05] it's hot now i need clothes you know we
[1:33:08] forget so quickly
[1:33:09] and god understands that but we must not
[1:33:11] complain we must learn
[1:33:13] to remember more praise god we must keep
[1:33:15] coming back to god
[1:33:17] so god will stir us up by way of
[1:33:19] remembrance amen
[1:33:24] now there's one of two interpretations
[1:33:27] either there's two two memorials that
[1:33:30] joshua sets up
[1:33:31] or there's a translation error so my
[1:33:34] opinion is they set up two
[1:33:36] memorials but i could be wrong because
[1:33:39] the scripture says let's look at verse
[1:33:41] uh joshua 4 1.
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:46] so in verse 3 the bible said and ye
[1:33:48] command you them saying
[1:33:50] take ye hence out of the midst of jordan
[1:33:52] uh the place where the priests
[1:33:54] stood firm 12 stones you should carry
[1:33:56] them over with you and leave them in the
[1:33:58] lodging place where ye shall
[1:34:00] lodge this night which was going to be
[1:34:02] gilgal
[1:34:05] okay verse four then joshua called the
[1:34:07] twelve men whom he had prepared for the
[1:34:08] of the children of israel out of every
[1:34:10] tribe of man and joshua said unto them
[1:34:12] passover before the ark of the lord your
[1:34:14] god into the midst of jordan
[1:34:15] and take you up every man of you a stone
[1:34:18] upon his shoulder according to the
[1:34:19] number of the tribes
[1:34:20] of the children of israel that this may
[1:34:22] be a sign among you
[1:34:24] that when your children ask their
[1:34:25] fathers in time to come say
[1:34:27] what mean ye by these stones
[1:34:30] so this memorial was going to be a sign
[1:34:32] for the children
[1:34:34] but i'll say it like this i was probably
[1:34:35] good for the adults too
[1:34:37] right any honest adult would say well
[1:34:39] yeah i struggle too sometimes i forget
[1:34:40] what god has done
[1:34:41] sometimes i forget to call upon the name
[1:34:43] of the lord and the church said
[1:34:45] amen but especially for these children
[1:34:48] in other words god cared about the
[1:34:50] children amen
[1:34:52] god wanted the children to know that
[1:34:54] he's faithful and that as he was with
[1:34:56] their parents
[1:34:57] so he'll be with them
[1:35:01] verse 7 then you shall answer them that
[1:35:03] the waters of jordan were cut off from
[1:35:04] before the ark of the covenant of the
[1:35:06] lord
[1:35:06] when it passed over jordan the waters of
[1:35:08] jordan were cut off and these stones
[1:35:09] shall be for memorial
[1:35:11] under the children of israel forever
[1:35:12] verse 9.
[1:35:16] yeah i'm going to skip down to verse 9
[1:35:17] and joshua's up 12 stones see here's
[1:35:18] where it says
[1:35:19] in the midst of jordan now the
[1:35:22] translators what they say
[1:35:24] maybe they met from the midst of jordan
[1:35:26] or they took them
[1:35:27] from or so instead of the word in the
[1:35:30] translate some people say well they
[1:35:31] translate it wrong they should have put
[1:35:32] the word from
[1:35:34] it could be but uh
[1:35:37] but you know there's some statements in
[1:35:39] the church age book where brother graham
[1:35:40] said there could have been a better
[1:35:41] translation than the king james
[1:35:43] that's possible but i just tend to
[1:35:46] believe they set up two different
[1:35:47] memorials
[1:35:48] one right there at the river when they
[1:35:50] crossed over he said in the midst of
[1:35:52] jordans that must have been a pretty
[1:35:53] pretty tall memorial in the midst of
[1:35:55] jordan and then another at gilgal
[1:35:59] that's verse 9. and joshua set up 12
[1:36:01] stone the midst of jordan in the place
[1:36:03] where the feet of the priest which bear
[1:36:05] the ark of the covenant stood
[1:36:06] and there i'm sorry and they are there
[1:36:08] unto this day
[1:36:11] and so vang i just you know i'm gonna go
[1:36:12] back there real quick i forgot to say
[1:36:14] this
[1:36:14] it's almost been a year brother today's
[1:36:16] may 2nd it's almost been a year
[1:36:18] since your dad got home praise god isn't
[1:36:21] that awesome just to see that
[1:36:23] here we are a year later are we still
[1:36:25] standing
[1:36:26] is god still the victorious god
[1:36:29] hallelujah
[1:36:30] he's faithful i thought wow that's so so
[1:36:32] striking today's may
[1:36:33] may 2nd we were rejoicing that he'd been
[1:36:36] brought home
[1:36:39] now see here at church they they cross
[1:36:41] and then they they went to gilgal which
[1:36:43] was in the plain before
[1:36:44] jericho so now they're going to go up to
[1:36:46] gilgal in joshua chapter four
[1:36:49] okay now in joshua 4 it's either one of
[1:36:53] the others so joshua 4 9 says they set
[1:36:55] stones in the midst of jordan where the
[1:36:58] priest's feet
[1:36:59] bear the ark of the lord but verse 20
[1:37:01] says those 12 stones which they took out
[1:37:03] of jordan
[1:37:04] did joshua pitch in gilgal
[1:37:08] so gilgal wasn't the same as jordan
[1:37:10] right jordan had its own location the
[1:37:11] river
[1:37:12] so it looks like they either set up two
[1:37:15] uh memorials
[1:37:16] or there's a translation error so i just
[1:37:19] believe there's
[1:37:20] i could be wrong but i believe there's
[1:37:21] two two memorials
[1:37:23] now i don't know i've been here do you
[1:37:25] guys remember this when you went to the
[1:37:26] ark
[1:37:27] you guys remember that remember that
[1:37:29] yeah i remember that too i was like why
[1:37:30] do they got 12 stones there
[1:37:32] yeah kentucky that's right so this is
[1:37:34] the ark encounter in kentucky
[1:37:36] and i just want to i just want to kind
[1:37:38] of give you uh uh uh just a modern day
[1:37:40] kind of example
[1:37:42] okay what it might have looked like
[1:37:44] because i went online i was looking for
[1:37:45] ron
[1:37:46] ron white remember ron white he said he
[1:37:47] found the ark of the covenant and
[1:37:49] he passed away now he was a famous
[1:37:51] archaeologist well christian
[1:37:52] archaeologist
[1:37:53] he said he found uh the chariots that
[1:37:55] were in the red sea and
[1:37:57] i don't know he might have anyways i was
[1:37:58] looking on his website i couldn't find
[1:38:00] anything about the 12 stones
[1:38:01] but i just found how this ministry built
[1:38:03] up the 12 stones and just wanted to give
[1:38:04] you an idea
[1:38:05] about what that might look like now
[1:38:07] here's a comparison so here's
[1:38:08] here where's an adult uh okay here's
[1:38:11] some adults
[1:38:12] so you know this memorial is about this
[1:38:14] high
[1:38:15] you know these are children and that's
[1:38:17] at the ark there in kentucky
[1:38:20] so just just to kind of give you an idea
[1:38:22] what this uh
[1:38:24] what this memorial would have looked
[1:38:25] like and when the children walk by they
[1:38:28] say what is this all about
[1:38:29] oh this is when the lord this this
[1:38:31] reminds us
[1:38:32] the lord he moved back though he held
[1:38:34] back all the waters
[1:38:36] on this rushing mighty river and we came
[1:38:39] across
[1:38:40] in other words god made the way god was
[1:38:42] real
[1:38:43] in my generation and god is real in your
[1:38:45] generation
[1:38:47] if god brought me through my trials god
[1:38:50] will bring you son through your trials
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:54] oh glory praise god god made sure
[1:38:57] you i want a physical reminder
[1:39:00] of what i've done don't forget
[1:39:07] now here's where clark says yeah clark
[1:39:09] believed you know clark said that may
[1:39:11] have been a translation here i'm not
[1:39:12] going to spend much time on that
[1:39:13] okay now back to this now church what's
[1:39:17] our lesson
[1:39:18] in joshua 4 1-9 we need to remember his
[1:39:22] faithfulness
[1:39:23] and verbalize it right we need to
[1:39:27] constantly testify about what god has
[1:39:30] done
[1:39:31] okay because your previous
[1:39:35] victories will be fuel for your future
[1:39:38] victories amen
[1:39:40] right that's what god said remember he
[1:39:43] said
[1:39:43] by this you'll know that i will defeat
[1:39:46] the hivites
[1:39:47] the canaanites the parasites all of
[1:39:50] these great mighty nations which are
[1:39:52] bigger than you
[1:39:53] the way you know you're going to
[1:39:54] overcome them is but
[1:39:56] by what i did on this day when i brought
[1:39:59] you through
[1:40:00] into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:02] praise god amen
[1:40:03] in other words if i sealed your soul
[1:40:05] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:07] there's no complex there's no disease
[1:40:10] there's there's no temptation that can
[1:40:13] overcome you
[1:40:14] because you're more than a conqueror he
[1:40:16] brought you through
[1:40:17] he's already paved the way before you
[1:40:19] his will
[1:40:20] is for you to possess all the land amen
[1:40:23] that's his will his will is not for you
[1:40:25] and i to be defeated
[1:40:27] but his will is for us to be conquerors
[1:40:29] and overcome the gates of our enemies
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:33] hallelujah that's what he said he said
[1:40:35] my seed
[1:40:36] will defeat the enemies in their gates
[1:40:38] praise god right
[1:40:40] you're going to possess the gates of
[1:40:42] your enemies
[1:40:44] hallelujah
[1:40:47] that's why i'm not defeated by
[1:40:48] depression like my dad
[1:40:50] because i'm possessing the gates of my
[1:40:52] enemies praise god
[1:40:54] praise the lord that's why i'm not
[1:40:56] defeated
[1:40:57] in denomination like my mothers and i
[1:40:59] love them
[1:41:01] i love them i've already told them these
[1:41:03] things you know
[1:41:04] that's why i'm not defeated because we
[1:41:07] are possessors of the promises
[1:41:09] we obey we put the word first before us
[1:41:13] amen we make sure the word of god is
[1:41:16] first in our lives
[1:41:17] and by that word we are made to conquer
[1:41:20] christ makes us conquerors in this life
[1:41:23] by the word of god
[1:41:25] go to second peter chapter one
[1:41:32] sorry i don't mean to huff and puff
[1:41:35] so loud like that
[1:41:41] if anybody knew about bad memories it
[1:41:43] was peter saints
[1:41:46] can you imagine cussing out
[1:41:50] people the night the lord was arrested
[1:41:54] imagine that you imagine not being able
[1:41:56] to testify to a little maid girl
[1:41:58] which they say was probably like a
[1:41:59] pre-teenaged girl
[1:42:01] he i don't even know jesus he preached
[1:42:03] for jesus for three and a half years and
[1:42:05] then he says i don't even know him i
[1:42:06] don't know the man
[1:42:08] he walked on water i don't know that man
[1:42:10] that saved me from drowning can you
[1:42:12] imagine that church
[1:42:14] if anybody need to know about the power
[1:42:17] of remembering the right memories
[1:42:20] it was peter just like paul
[1:42:23] satan could have just overcome him well
[1:42:25] look what you did you arrested them
[1:42:28] you brought them into the prisons
[1:42:30] there's an hour here bear with me
[1:42:33] you dragged them to prison you tried to
[1:42:35] say would say you tried to get my people
[1:42:36] or god's people to blaspheme the name of
[1:42:38] jesus and you say you're a preacher of
[1:42:40] jesus
[1:42:40] look what you did see when satan brings
[1:42:43] back all these memories
[1:42:44] we bring up his future right right when
[1:42:47] he tries to bring up your best bring up
[1:42:49] his future right
[1:42:51] but you also have to remember what god's
[1:42:53] brought you through
[1:42:55] you also got to remember your jordan
[1:42:57] river amen
[1:43:01] you got to remember that god brought you
[1:43:02] cross jordan
[1:43:05] by a supernatural move of god by the
[1:43:08] word of god
[1:43:09] amen that's right church
[1:43:13] you got to remind satan of his future
[1:43:14] but you've got to remind satan of what
[1:43:16] god did for you in the past as well
[1:43:19] that's how you overcome the hivites the
[1:43:21] parasites
[1:43:23] the temptationites the greedites
[1:43:26] the lustites praise the lord
[1:43:30] the pride ites there we go pride the
[1:43:33] lazy ice
[1:43:36] hallelujah the the fearites the
[1:43:39] scaredy-cat heights
[1:43:41] all these things the angerites
[1:43:45] right as we start on wednesday uh the
[1:43:48] discriminates
[1:43:50] discrimination right like peter's
[1:43:51] discriminated against the gentiles
[1:43:53] sometimes we treat the rich people
[1:43:54] or the nice looking people we treat them
[1:43:56] better than people that aren't so nice
[1:43:57] looking or not
[1:43:58] not so rich sometimes we do that
[1:44:02] but we've got a great power to overcome
[1:44:04] those devils praise god
[1:44:06] amen amen peter
[1:44:11] ii peter chapter 1 13.
[1:44:16] now look at the next look at the
[1:44:18] definition of stir
[1:44:21] stir is to wake up from your sleep like
[1:44:23] jesus waking up jesus on in the boat
[1:44:25] remember that one buddy
[1:44:27] i remember you enjoyed that sermon
[1:44:28] that's why i said i'm sure everybody
[1:44:29] else enjoyed it too but i remember we
[1:44:30] talked about it
[1:44:31] so he said stir up your minds wake up
[1:44:34] your mind
[1:44:36] in other words we're kind of sleeping to
[1:44:37] what we should be thinking about
[1:44:39] right we should we should have alert
[1:44:41] minds i should be purposely thinking
[1:44:43] about
[1:44:43] the memorials of god but instead it's
[1:44:45] like my my spiritual mind is asleep
[1:44:48] and i've forgotten all the great things
[1:44:50] god has done
[1:44:52] anybody guilty of that don't say amen
[1:44:53] don't say amen we all get guilty of it
[1:44:57] that's why a holy ghost to a man like
[1:44:58] peter would say stir your minds up
[1:45:02] by way of remembrance i hope the holy
[1:45:05] spirit is speaking to somebody today by
[1:45:06] god's grace i trust that if you're going
[1:45:08] through you have a river before you
[1:45:10] some travel for you you are more than a
[1:45:12] conqueror church
[1:45:14] you put the word first put the word
[1:45:16] first
[1:45:18] only be strong and very courageous ii
[1:45:21] peter one
[1:45:23] now this is of course the most what a
[1:45:25] beautiful chapter one of my favorite
[1:45:27] chapters the statue perfect man
[1:45:28] it's a tremendous revelation we know
[1:45:30] that
[1:45:31] verse 13. now don't don't forget though
[1:45:34] verse uh
[1:45:36] i want to back up a little bit
[1:45:41] look at verse 9 but he that lacketh
[1:45:43] these things is blind
[1:45:44] cannot see afar off and have forgotten
[1:45:45] that he was purged from his old sins
[1:45:48] see when people feel like well maybe i'm
[1:45:50] not saved they've stopped
[1:45:52] adding the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:45:54] to their life
[1:45:55] when they stop adding those anointings
[1:45:57] when they stop adding more knowledge god
[1:45:58] give me more knowledge god give me more
[1:46:00] patience
[1:46:00] god give me more temperance more
[1:46:02] self-control when they stop
[1:46:03] adding those things they lose the
[1:46:05] anointing and they start thinking i'm
[1:46:07] not even saved
[1:46:09] peter says it right there because he
[1:46:11] went through it oh that's right
[1:46:13] he went through it praise god he didn't
[1:46:16] just
[1:46:17] get sad the bible said he went bitterly
[1:46:20] when he denied the lord he bitterly wept
[1:46:24] he was crying it was so it was such an
[1:46:26] awful thing how could i do this
[1:46:28] he realized that he lost the power of
[1:46:30] god
[1:46:33] now look at verse 10 wherefore the
[1:46:35] rather brother and give diligence to
[1:46:36] make your calling election sure
[1:46:38] for if you do these things you shall
[1:46:39] never fall
[1:46:41] that's a great revelation with the
[1:46:42] mystery of godliness
[1:46:45] how much effort is required to be godly
[1:46:48] all of it
[1:46:50] i'm going to say that again i like that
[1:46:53] how much of your
[1:46:54] effort do you need to be like christ all
[1:46:56] of it
[1:46:57] you're not saved by your effort you're
[1:46:59] saved by repenting right you're saved by
[1:47:01] grace through faith
[1:47:02] but you become like christ by your
[1:47:05] effort by surrendering
[1:47:07] by giving all of your heart soul mind
[1:47:09] and strength jesus said
[1:47:11] love the lord your god with all your
[1:47:12] heart soul mind and strength that's what
[1:47:14] you are
[1:47:14] overcoming by by purposely choosing
[1:47:17] to let god's spirit lead and guide you
[1:47:20] by putting the word first
[1:47:22] first in your thoughts first in your
[1:47:23] word first in your hope first in the car
[1:47:26] first everywhere
[1:47:26] put the word of god first he'll bring
[1:47:28] you through
[1:47:30] that's right
[1:47:34] if you do these things you'll never fall
[1:47:37] like joshua
[1:47:39] if you keep the word first you're never
[1:47:40] going to fall short
[1:47:44] look at verse 12 wherefore i will not be
[1:47:46] negligent to put you
[1:47:47] always in remembrance of these things
[1:47:49] remember peter's
[1:47:50] he's going to keep returning to the
[1:47:51] statue of man he's going to keep
[1:47:53] returning you need more anointing
[1:47:55] amen you need more of god's power in
[1:47:58] your life
[1:47:59] i'm going to keep reminding you because
[1:48:01] i know what it's like to lose power
[1:48:03] and make myself ashamed right to shame
[1:48:05] myself
[1:48:07] i know what it's like to let down the
[1:48:09] bars and lose the power of god
[1:48:11] and i will i don't want you to do that i
[1:48:13] want you to be overcoming
[1:48:15] i want you to constantly grow the bible
[1:48:17] said
[1:48:18] grace and peace be multiplied you he
[1:48:20] said every promise of god
[1:48:22] is given by promise that we can inherit
[1:48:25] all things praise god
[1:48:30] he said though you know them be
[1:48:32] established in the present truth yeah i
[1:48:34] think it me as long as i'm in this
[1:48:35] tabernacle
[1:48:36] to stir you up by putting you in
[1:48:38] remembrance
[1:48:39] so hot peter says how do we stir people
[1:48:41] up make them
[1:48:42] remember what god has done make them
[1:48:46] remember what god has done
[1:48:49] hallelujah how many want faith that's
[1:48:51] awake and not sleeping
[1:48:53] amen i'm talking about faith now faith
[1:48:56] we're all awake today by god's grace but
[1:48:58] sometimes i put those little kids asleep
[1:48:59] back there
[1:49:00] my own my own and some other ones
[1:49:02] sometimes i put them asleep
[1:49:04] but the bible said he said stir up your
[1:49:06] faith by way of remembrance
[1:49:10] and he says in verse 14 knowing that i
[1:49:12] must put off this tabernacle i'm going
[1:49:14] to die soon
[1:49:15] even as our lord jesus christ
[1:49:18] has shown me verse 15 moreover i will
[1:49:21] endeavor that ye may be able after my
[1:49:23] decease
[1:49:23] to have all these things always in
[1:49:26] remembrance
[1:49:28] so church that's one reason we come to
[1:49:30] church for more faith and the church
[1:49:32] said
[1:49:32] amen you come here for more faith i
[1:49:35] trust you got a little faith injection
[1:49:36] today by god's grace
[1:49:38] for more virtue for more knowledge right
[1:49:40] for more temperance patience
[1:49:42] godliness brotherly kindness more
[1:49:43] charity amen
[1:49:45] he said always remember to do this if
[1:49:48] not you'll forget the power of god
[1:49:50] you'll forget what god has done he said
[1:49:53] but
[1:49:53] constantly add more power to your life
[1:49:56] and an
[1:49:56] entrance will be made for you in the
[1:49:58] kingdom of god
[1:50:00] and of his christ

[1:53:20] faith that's active remembering and that
[1:53:23] stirs us up to action
[1:53:26] like i was telling you out in iowa i
[1:53:27] preached that little message on sunday

[1:53:30] said instantly after the service
[1:53:31] they called up two people to make things
[1:53:33] right that they'd done wrong with
[1:53:34] business
[1:53:36] some money or something like that on
[1:53:38] church that's active faith right

[1:53:52] going to act upon the word of god
[1:53:54] i'm putting the word first and the
[1:53:56] water's got to be pushed back
[1:54:02] brother man talks about a backslidden
[1:54:03] church here in tennessee
[1:54:05] he said he said oh the spirit of god
[1:54:08] comes and shows his presence
[1:54:09] these people just set quiet and never
[1:54:11] seem to be thrilled about your spirit
[1:54:13] just falls he said what's entered their
[1:54:15] church this tennessee church

[1:54:19] other's throats
[1:54:20] can you imagine that oh what a condition

[1:54:33] can remember
[1:54:35] a former day how is brother i'm going to
[1:54:38] help a church that has preachers at

[1:54:59] problems happened
[1:55:01] pretty simple very simple
[1:55:05] men and women here have come so cold and
[1:55:07] indifferent until
[1:55:08] they really seem to think they're doing
[1:55:10] all right
[1:55:12] is that is that true lukewarmness when
[1:55:14] people are lukewarm they think they're
[1:55:15] all right but their faith is asleep
[1:55:18] they need stirred up because there's
[1:55:21] problems there's greediness there's
[1:55:22] selfishness there's
[1:55:23] fights among the preachers or people
[1:55:26] shake their souls tonight lord

[1:55:44] everything that's comfortable in their
[1:55:46] life
[1:55:47] the eagle takes out all the soft uh
[1:55:50] branches and then it's just the the
[1:55:52] pokey ones right and then that makes the
[1:55:54] eagles want to get out
[1:55:58] make it so easy for them
[1:56:02] you make next time i pray for you
