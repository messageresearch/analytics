========================================

you know in america we stand for the pledge of allegiance we stand for the national land for the singing of the national anthem and i believe we can truly stand for the reading of the word of the lord amen amen it has way more importance to me than a flag amen genesis the third chapter of the 15th verse then also we're going to read from matthew the 13th chapter i want to just just get a little scriptural foundation this morning for the message i'd like to speak upon genesis the third chapter verse 15 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her sea and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now let's turn to matthew the 13th chapter matthew 13 verses 24 to 30. another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit there appeared the tares also so the servants of the household came and said unto him sir did shall not sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears and he said unto them an enemy hath done this and the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tares you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather you together first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn shall we just bow hearts to the lord today heavenly father as we have come here this morning for one purpose and that is that we might hear from you and receive from you lord god we just ask that you would take the scriptures that i've read this morning father god that you just open up to our hearts today lord knowing that we can come and every one of us that has an education and the ability to read father we can read the word but lord we realize that it will take the holy spirit to to illuminate light upon it father that we might understand what lays there but lord we know that jesus told the disciples blessed are your eyes for they see and blessed are your ears for they hear lord we we asked this morning god that you would so bless us this morning father that our eyes would be opened to your word lord and god that we would hear lord more than just an a voice god more than just a sound but lord that we would hear from you this morning father i pray that you just meet every need of every person that's here lord minister to your people this morning god lord i pray that you just so open our minds our hearts today god help each of us father that we would just be so lord attentive to your word this morning god i just pray that you would anoint me your servant this morning father that i would be obedient to your voice speak what you would have us to hear this morning for we ask it in the name of jesus christ as we commit this service into thy hands for thy glory in jesus name amen you may be seated this morning i'd like to speak to you this morning on a subject as brother makely had mentioned we i he had asked me some time back i was over at with isaiah brooks's church over in lima and he had mentioned to me sometime about coming by and i just and here over the last couple of weeks or so i just kind of felt to to to get in contact with him to come and the lord had just laid a few things upon my heart and as he gave testimony you see how the mind of god is because god doesn't just do something on one side but but we know that three is a confirmation and here you have brother makely receiving something another brother receiving something and then i myself something that god has laid upon my heart to come minister to you today and i hope you have your bibles with you because we're going to be looking at quite a bit of scriptures if you take notes it might be be wise to write a lot of the scriptures down so that you may can go back and look at them again and i always encourage people don't just take my word for it but go home and study for yourselves because each person is the study to show themselves approved in the lord and so i want to just if i may lay a little foundation this morning and just something to lead into the actual subject that i want to minister upon and and we'll be speaking this morning and tonight upon this and so it'd be valuable not to miss either part of it because it's a it's not it's a whole sermon but it comes in two parts you know it's like the main course in dessert so you don't want to just leave without getting the dessert so amen by god's grace but i'd like to speak on a thought on the seed of the antichrist and within this study i want to to try and show within the word of god a truth that will help us understand a lot of what's going on in the world and how a lot of people respond to the gospel but i want to begin by saying that most of the people in the world today have a misconception of what christianity and church is all about there and and the reason is because we find that satan has so has actually moved right into the church and has perverted it so much until the majority of the beliefs that people hold and because ev every one of us this morning we have beliefs if i were to sit down with you this morning and asked you to explain the word of god to me every one of us would have a belief that we hold within the word of god if we went to another church down the street and we went in we sat down with their pastor and and the people within the congregation we would begin to ask them would you please explain to me your beliefs we find that that that every person has a belief but when we speak on beliefs we find that a lot of people get real touchy when you start when you start actually dealing with beliefs because every person believes that their belief of the word of god is right there's not going to be one person that i would speak to today whether it's here in this church or a church down the street or a church in johnson city tennessee from where i'm from that if i begin to deal with them upon what they believe in the word of god every one of them is going to believe that their belief is right but what i want to just to to inject into your mind and i i have a few points that i want to make that i really want you to kind of hold as a very weighty as we move through this but beliefs are pre-arranged organized filters to our perception of the word i want to define beliefs for you again it is uh it is pre-arranged organized filters to our perception of the word in other words we only view the word of god through our beliefs now let me ask this question where does our beliefs come from or does our beliefs come from the word of god now we when we when we're looking at this at a belief as being a filter we find that that we will actually filter the word through a conglomeration of beliefs and thus we only view it in light of these beliefs and are quick to reject anything that does not come to our belief filter now when when we look at this belief i want to just i'm going to constantly be asking you this question this morning where does our beliefs come from the things that you hold as truth this morning the things that that when you look at the word of god and and you envision what the word of god means and what the word of god says where does that belief come from because the beliefs we have fostered them from somewhere but the question is is my does my belief come from the word of god or does it come from something that somebody has just taught me and because they have taught it to me i just accepted it as my belief and that is what i simply believe so we find that the majority of all beliefs is a result of what we have been taught from a child and have learned to filter the word of god from what we have been taught now i want you to notice a few things that i make a few points and as i said i'm just trying to to inject something before i actually enter into our thought this morning but so just bear with me a minute now you take a child that is born in a catholic home and has been raised in catholicism and has been taught the doctrine of the catholic church he he will foster those beliefs as they their filter by which they will view the word of god and christianity we find that the bible and a christian life has one meaning to them and another meaning to someone else who was who was raised in a baptist home you see you take a child that has been raised in catholicism and he will view and his whole belief structure of how he accepts this bible it's based upon the kind of rearing that he has had as he was coming up and to him you asked him what is christianity all about well it's about a rosary and it's about hail mary's and it's about this saint and that saint and say and in purgatory and all of these things but within his mind if you ask him is that what you believe he's going to tell you that his beliefs are right because that has what that is what he has fostered from a child and so he is growing with these beliefs in his mind but then you take a child that is raised in a baptist home to above this the word of god and christianity has a totally different meaning to a person that was raised within within a column of catholicism but you know when we think about baptist for just a moment there are a number of facets under the heading i am baptist when you would ask somebody say oh you're a baptist it's more than i'm baptist but we find that i am southern baptist or i am first baptist i'm missionary baptist or i am calvary baptist and the interesting thing about each of these facets from the southern baptist ii to the first baptist to the missionary baptist to the catholic to the calvary baptist is that even though every one of them will tell you that they are baptist if you go to their churches and look at their doctrines of beliefs you will find out that every one of those facets hold beliefs that are somewhat alike but the reason one is the calvary baptist and the other one is the first baptist it's because they have beliefs that are contrary one to the other but yet they all say i am a baptist and what i want you to try to understand this morning is is that here we have a world today that there are so many people so many churches we can go to a town and there'll be 13 or 14 or 20 or 30 churches in one town and every one of them will foster beliefs of the word that are contrary one to the other and every one every one of those churches will believe that what they believe is right now notice they will you know they'll both tell you that i am a baptist but they have different beliefs when it comes to viewing the word of god each one will argue the word based upon their beliefs which comes from the source by which they have been taught and each one will filter new revelation through their very own filter which is based upon those beliefs that they have been taught from a child for instance if if you were to take something here here and uh under the the atmosphere that we was in this morning of with the holy spirit moving amongst the people and the people entering into a a fellowship of worship if you were trying to take this belief concept of how that we have a freedom of worship and we can enter into the presence of god and the baptism of the holy ghost and speaking in tongues now if you were to take what you believed this morning down to the baptist church which would be no revelation to them they are going to view what you're telling them through their system of beliefs you will find that this system of viewing the word of god through belief filters also extends into the pentecostal churches there is the church of god there are the assemblies of god you have the united pentecostal church and last but not least you have also the independent pentecostal churches and each of these movements has their own system of beliefs by which they view and perceive the word of god now if you was a raised with you israel's assembly of god you will see the word by an assembly of god standard now just follow me now so your beliefs will be be after the pattern that the church elders have set forth and and that is what the preachers preach and if they preach anything that is contrary to the guidelines of that organization they're ousted out so notice again that each of these groups will tell you that i am pentecostal but they have different beliefs when it comes to believing the word of god now i want to ask you something why is that this morning you take a hundred pentecostal churches that may be within a 50-mile radius of this place and you go in and you sit down with them and every one of them are going to foster certain beliefs and that is what they're going to actually filter the word of god and where the separation comes is based not upon the word but upon what they believed the word of god says you know you take this group believes in father son holy ghost baptism this group believes in jesus name baptism this group believes in this and this group believes in that this one is here and this one is there now where is all of these beliefs coming from now i i'm trying to awaken your minds is what i'm trying to do just a moment now when someone says i believe something or i don't believe they are actually saying that the new things that they are hearing do not correlate with their pre-arranged beliefs and most people try and rationalize the word by their childhood beliefs but i want you to catch something that is very valuable to your walk with god this morning we are not supposed to put the word of god through the filter through a church filter of our beliefs but our beliefs are to be filtered through the word of god it's not about saying this is what i believe it's what does the word say amen so our beliefs are to be filtered through the word not the word filtered through our beliefs there's a big difference in that and so this morning what i what i want to try to do is show you that not all of our beliefs that we have been taught from a child is right now i want to just give you a very brief example before i enter into the actual thought this morning i hope this is all right with you and it's a belief that has been adopted into the church as a divine truth that will never make it through god's filter the word but yet it has been received as truth and parents have taught it to their children ministers have stood in the pulpit they have preached it they have projected it to the people and it is a flat out lie when it comes to the word of god are you ready we have been taught from a child that the wise men found jesus in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes with sheep and dung and all of these things around him now let me ask you something is that the truth of god or not do you believe well we when we go down to the courthouse here we see the the manger scene and the wise men and the shepherds are there together with with jesus in a manger wrapped in swaddling claws and this is a belief that has been projected that does not even it's not even in the bible at all you say brother chris that's what i've been taught all my life you've been taught a lot i'm not just saying these things to be saying let's turn to luke the second chapter that's why i hope you got your bibles with you because what i want you to understand is that everything that you've always been taught does not necessarily line up with the word of god luke the second chapter i want to read verses 8 and 6 8 to 16 this is the account of whence of which the shepherds came in contact with christ notice now luke chapter 2 beginning with the eighth verse and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them in the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you and you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there were the angels a multitude of heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace and good will to the word men and it came to pass as the angels were going away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us go now unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger now notice the wording of these scriptures when speaking concerning jesus now this is the account of the shepherds not the wise men this is the shepherds notice in verse 12 and this shall be a sign unto you and ye shall find and if you want to underline this in your bible to keep it in your mind you shall find the babe be a b you shall find the bay wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger then in verse in verse 16 and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger so it's plain and clear without a doubt without a question that the shepherds found jesus just after he was born in a manger and he was a baby right so the bible said i believe that i hope you do as well but now let's turn to matthew the second chapter don't take my word for it now take your beliefs filter them through the word of god see if they line up with the word or not matthew the second chapter i want to begin reading here the first verse this is the account in which now the wise men are going to come in contact with jesus now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen a star in the east and had come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou betham in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel now notice verse 7 just a moment now as i read through this and hold it in your mind then herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared now notice herod is asking them when did you first see the star let's read on now and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for notice now verse 8 the young what child not babe when the when the shepherds found him it was the babe the babe lying in a manger and notice here now when they heard the king they departed in low with the storm and someone before them till they come to and stood over where the young child what's the next word was not is but where he was past tense now notice now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come notice now into the what now where did they find him at not in a manger not in a stable not with dung around him not with not with sheep and oxen and all of these things but when the wise man found jesus he was in a house that's right praise god not in a not in a stable but yet we have been taught from childhood that the wise men found jesus in a stable wrapped in swaddling claws but yet the word of god said when they were coming to the house they saw the young child not baby let's continue reading on down and and with mary's mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to error they departed unto their own country another way and when they were departed behold the angel the lord appeared to joseph in a dream saying arise take the young child not they take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring the word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him and when he rose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt notice verse 16 now then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeded rough and sent forth and slew all of the children that were in bethlehem and in all of the coasts there have noticed this part now from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise man now here herod just killed all of the children two years old and under why because he knew at what time it was that the wise men had asked him about the baby and he had sent him forth and it was when jesus when the wise men found jesus he was not a babe he was not in swaddling clothes he was not in a manger in fact he was two years old and in a house now that's what the word of god says now i don't know about you this morning but if my belief that i've always been taught from a child it's contrary to what the bible said then it would be important for me to get rid of my beliefs and go to the word of god and find what the bible says now i want to just make a few more points and it's very valuable point if it's all right with you now in galatians the first chapter i want you to read something with me because now i want to just bring this down just a little bit more serious to us because people say well brother chris what is what is me believing whether or not the wise man was at the mains or in the house what has it got to do with my salvation i don't know what it might have to do but what i want to say to you is this if in such a minor area something that is so minor is that if you have been taught that wrong what other things what other things that you have been taught in your beliefs that you have right now the things that you hold as truth what other things may be wrong because you've failed to simply go to the word of god or not and to see if your belief lines up with the word amen galatians the first chapter i want to begin with the sixth verse notice now paul begins into something and paul brings this down to a very serious matter now he said i marvel that you're so removed from him that has called you into the grace of christ notice what he says now unto another gospel moved into another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before so say i now again if any man preach another gospel unto you then that you have received let him be accursed notice that paul is speaking of another gospel being preached and those that have believed it he has said they are removed from the faith i want to just place this in your mind the reason it is important that we believe what the word says and not just what we've been taught from a child it's because to believe one simple thing that is contrary to the word of god even the wise men of being at the manger scene will remove you out of the gospel of christ and place you into another gospel that's not my words that's the apostle paul if you believe the word of god or not that's why it is so important for us not just to take beliefs not just to take what well my mama taught me that and i was raised in the church and that's what i've been taught all of my life and that's what i believe i don't want it just to be based upon what my mother and my father has taught me but i want it to be based upon the word of god because my mom and dad could be wrong in fact i'll tell you this much my mother and my father did teach me wrong my mom always told me the wise man was at the um manger i don't know about yours but that's what my mom and dad taught me and i found out right quick that i better come to a point in my life to take everything that mom and dad has always injected instilled inside of me to make sure it lines up with the word of god or not because it's not you're not going to get in on mom and daddy anyhow it's got to be an individual affair you and god alone so paul he says here he said but though we are an angel from heaven preaching another gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we have said before so say now i again if any man preach another gospel unto you that that you have received let him be a curse now this might hurt just a little bit but i'm going to say it anyhow amen any system whether it is methodist catholic baptist pentecostal that teach anything that is contrary to the word of god according to paul is cursed and those that believe based their beliefs upon the things the system has taught is cursed with it amen becomes a little bit more serious now so if those who have taught you have misrepresented the word in such a minor way as the wise man being at the manger scene how many other areas of the word have they misled you to believe as well now i want to just look at this subject this morning because it is important for me to lay that out because what i want you to realize is that maybe a lot of the things that we've been taught isn't always right because if we would go to the word of god we just might see things a little bit differently now i want to look as i said on the subject i'm just going to lay a foundation this morning and so tonight we're going to to pick up back up wherever i don't get finished with this morning so now in genesis 3 15 as we go i want you to turn with me and read all of these scriptures for yourself because as i said i don't want you just to take my word fart because i don't want to just foster some beliefs into your mind but i want to try to project to you the same gospel that paul preached which is the word of god and the truth of god that which lays within the word now we will find that through studying the scripture that the bible depicts that there are two seeds and here in genesis 3 15 it speaks now he said and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between now if you want to underline it you can between thy seed which is one seed and her seed which is another seed so there it speaks of thy seed and heresy then we read in matthew the 13th chapter verses 24 to 30 and laying our scriptural foundation in which that jesus called the two seeds the tares and the wheat and the two seeds what we will find according to what jesus taught in matthew 13 that the two seeds are on earth at the same time now as we study these two seeds we will find that there is a conflict in natures between them in genesis 3 15 it declares that there is enmity between the two seeds for he said i will put enmity between thy seed and her seed now this word enmity comes from the root word or from the word hatred in other words i will put hatred between thy seed and her seed you'll never get along you'll never be able to exist together in peace but there is going to be two seeds and there is going to be enmity between the two seeds now as we take a farther look at these two seeds we will find that there is one group that is cursed while another group is blessed one group is under judgment while another group is under mercy now i want you to turn with me now to matthew the 13th chapter and i want to look at the cursed seed just a moment matthew chapter 13 verse 42. we're going to be covering a lot of scriptures so be prepared to turn and read with me matthew 13 verse 42 notice what the scripture says now and shall cast them into the furnace of fire and there shall be weeping and there shall be welling and gnashing of teeth so notice now the seed of the enemy is cast into the furnace of fire and the reason why we know this is the seed of the enemy is because of this is the latter part of what we read in in matthew chapter 13 verses 24 to 30 in which the son of man sowed his seed into the field and then the bible said while he slept an enemy came in and sowed seed also and now we come and look at the seed that was sown by the enemy and it is that seed that was sown by the enemy that is to be cast into the furnace of fire now go to luke the 19th chapter verse 27. luke 19 verse 27. notice the scripture now but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me notice now there is judgment to the enemy and christ tells here that he has an enemy and those that are his enemy he says to them he says he says bring them and slay them before me now notice now matthew 25 verse 41. matthew 25 41 we're going to lay a lot of scripture and then i'm going to just bring them all together chapter 25 verse 41 notice what he says now then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart for me notice the word next now depart from me ye cursed ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels so jesus speaks to a people here that was cursed a people that was not blessed and the cursed people was on the left hand of god now if there is a left hand then there must be a right hand right so those on the left hand were cursed and those on the right hand were not cursed what we are seeing is the two seeds of genesis 3 15 in which he said i will put enmity between thy seed and her seed one will be cursed the other one will be blessed one will receive mercy the other one will receive judgment now i want to ask this question who are the cursed children turn them into genesis 3 17 who are the cursed children because genesis is the book of begin of beginnings and if there is a curse seed it had to begin in genesis because everything began in genesis now notice now genesis 3 17 you'll find out that adam was not cursed for he said in genesis 3 17 and unto adam he said because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife and has be eaten of the tree of which i commandeth thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curse it is the ground for thy sake notice now the ground was cursed but not adam god did not curse adam but he cursed the ground on adam for adam's stake now notice also now in the 16th verse and you'll find that eve was not cursed for it said unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee notice what he said he said that he would greatly multiply our sorrow and conception but nowhere does he say that eve was cursed when you look at genesis the 3rd chapter and the 14th verse you will find that the serpent was cursed for he said in the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed notice also now in genesis the 4th chapter and the 11th verse we will find out that cain was also cursed amen genesis 4 11. and now speaking of cain for in verse 9 the lord said unto cain then in verse 11 continuing the conversation he said and now art thou cursed so the judgment of matthew 25 41 we find that the multitudes at the end time their curse the judgment where he said to those on his left hand ye cursed children of him and we find that the cursed children started in genesis and moved all the way down to the end time for he said in ii peter the second chapter verse 14 turn with me there if you will ii peter 2 14 and i know you think of brother chris where is all of this sleeping hang on and you'll find out ii peter chapter 2 verse 14 what i want to establish in your minds this morning is that there are two seeds within the scripture in ii peter 2 14 having eyes full of adultery and cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls and heart they have exercised with coveted practice cursed children notice now the bible speaks of cursed children now what we are looking at is that only the seed of the serpent which had to be cain was cursed because adam was not cursed eve was not cursed but the serpent was cursed and cain was cursed and then you come to the end time and in second peter 2 14 he speaks again of cursed children let me say it to you like this no seed of god is cursed only those on the left hand where it is impossible for the seed of god to be cursed you see a wheat cannot be a tear when you go back to matthew 13 verses 24 to 30 you'll find out that there was one seed sown and there was another seed sown and each of them was of different seeds and a wheat no matter how much a tear would desire to be a wheat it cannot be because the curse was on the seed and god set a law and order that said the seed must bring forth of its kind is that what he said genesis 1 11 and 12. genesis 1 11 and 12 here's the law of god god set into order and god said let the earth bring forth grasp the herd building seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and the herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after its kind and god saw that it was good notice what he is saying now here is the law of god god set right into nature that whatever life is in that seed that is the only life that it can produce so each seed had to produce the life that was in it whether it was a tear or a wheat whether it was a good seed or whether it was an evil seed so the enemy is the enemy and a son of god is a son of god you take an apple seed and that apple seed might want to be an orange seed but it can never do it if how if it's going to be an apple tree it had to have apple tree life in it halfway through its life it can't change that's the law of god that's the law of genesis neither we believe the word of god or do we not that's the question to ask yourself so we have the wicked seed and we have the righteous seed one is cursed the other one isn't cursed one is born of god the other one is born of satan because in matthew 13 verses 24 and 25 we find that the son of man sowed watch this now good speed [Music] let's just look at it turn with me matthew chapter 13 verses 24 i want you to see it for yourself matthew 13 verses 24 and 25 and a pair by putting forth on them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sold good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way now notice these two seeds that was sown was later translated by jesus in verse 38 as the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom and the tares are the children of the wicked one right one born of god one born of satan one the seed of god one the seed of satan one are the children of the kingdom the other one are the children of the wicked one and they were what they were because of the seed that was sown now i want you to look at this god takes care of his seed the cursed children are punished they are not the seed of god now you say brother chris but god loves everybody then explain to me why he said jacob i have loved and esau have hated me now do you believe the word of god or do you not believe the word of god jacob i've loved esau i've hated that's in wrong in your bible if you want to look it up so we find that god has a special attention not to all of the world just say but brother chris he died for all the world but yet look at the parable he said also the prayer that he found a treasure in a field and he went and bought the field but he didn't take the field he took the treasure out of the field that was why he came not for the whole world but he come because there was a treasure in the field john 17 9 because some of you thinking that i'm just saying this may be on my own john 17 9 let's look what jesus says now here here is jesus and he's praying notice his prayer now i pray for them i pray not for the what world i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine here jesus prayed for his faith he was not praying for the world he was not praying for everyone he was praying for those that was on the right hand of god he was not praying for the cursed children it's the word of god that's what i believe god it's first john the third chapter now first john chapter 3 verses 10 to 15. i know i'm probably shaking a little bit of your beliefs but that's what i wanted to do because always i believe isn't always right first john third chapter begin with the tenth verse in this the children of god calls his own works were evil and his brothers righteous marvel not my brethren notice here comes this word world again marvel not my brethren if the world hates you now remember what jesus said all the way back yonder in genesis 3 15 he said i will put enmity the word enmity there is hatred i will put hatred between thy seed and her shed and here he comes and said marvel not my brethren if the world hate you what is he doing he is identifying that the world that jesus said that he would not pray for was that wicked seed it was those that was going to be at enmity with the children of god he said we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth and death whosoever hateth his brother is a murder and you know that no murder hath eternal life abiding in him notice verse 13 it tells us that the world is the cursed seat that was born of the wicked one for he said marvel not my brethren if the world hates you genesis 4 11 tells us that cain was cursed here in first john 3 12 we find that cain was of that wicked one and he hated abel so what the bible said notice not as cain who was of that wicked one remember that it was it was a wicked one in matthew 13 verses verse 38 he said that he said the the good seed were the children of the kingdom the bad seed were the children of the wicked one and here he's identifying now john under inspiration he said brother chris what is this holy men of old as they were moved upon by the holy spirit they wrote the word of god and here john comes under inspiration and said not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slewing him because his works were evil and his brothers were righteous amen the cursed children had to be the world cain was a tear yes sir cain was a terror because he was of the wicked one what the bible says now now let's go to ephesians 1 just a minute ephesians 1. i want to read verses 4 to 7 now notice this now because what i want to show you is that redemption comes only to the children of god but notice what he said now in verse 4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world now i don't know about you but if that's what it says it says then i was actually a seed of god before i was even born because according as he has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accept it in the beloved notice verse 7 now in whom we have redemption through the blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now i want to ask you a question in verse 7 who is the we because he said in whom we have redemption through the blood the forgiveness of sin i'll tell you who it is it's the us in verse four when he said according to his chosen us in him the only those that have been chosen in god before the foundation of the world has redemption through the blood of jesus christ and the forgiveness of sin you see brother chris you mean everybody's not going to be saved that's right i mean i would love for everybody to make but the fact of it is not everybody's going to make it because only those that was chosen in god before the foundation of the world is god has forgiveness of sins through the blood of jesus christ you see saints of god some are ordained to life and some to death and redemption don't come to the cursed children because matthew 25 41 tells of the judgment he said to those on the left and get cursed into everlasting fire when we get all the way to the end time and the judgment time the cursed children is still standing there under the judgment of god so redemption is only to those on the right hand of god turn them into acts 13 verse 48. acts 13 verse 48 notice the scripture now here's a story of paul and barnabas they was coming into the city that was coming to to minister the word of the lord and notice what it says in verse 48 and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to what to eternal life believed now here is paul in acts telling us that there are people that are ordained to eternal life and it is only those that was ordained to eternal life that believed what they was preaching now notice in verse 44 because it's important to see this verse because in verse 44 it said and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god now when we look at the broad picture nearly everyone in the city came out to hear paul and barnabas preach but not everyone that came out to hear them preach was ordained to eternal life and the only ones that believed what they were saying was those that was ordained to eternal life then that makes an interesting point of only the true seed of god those who are not the cursed children is going to believe the word of god in his pureness they're not just going to sit around and foster some beliefs but the true bread of christ is going to believe all of the word now why did those believe that believe question right second 10 second thessalonians because almost the whole city came out to hear the word of god but not all of those that came out to here believed it was only those that was ordained to eternal life so then we come to second thessalonians because why did those that believed believed well in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 the bible says but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation that is the same thing that paul said over under in in ephesians 1 and 4 when he said according as he was chosen us in him before the foundation of the world now here he comes back again because god from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief in the truth the reason why those that came out that received eternal life could believe was because they was chosen to believe right but notice in jude jude the fourth verse there's only one chapter so jude the fourth verse notice what it says here now jude the fourth verse for there are certain men crypt and unawares who were before all ordained to this condemnation now in the same bible we find one group of people that are ordained to lie we find another group of people that joel jude says that before over ordained a condemnation we find the right hand of god and a left hand of god we find cursed children and we find blessed children now does your bible say that that's what vine says now notice just now we start seeing these two seeds coming into form now one is blind the other one can see one is death the other one can hear one is ordained to eternal life one is ordained to condemnation that's why jesus said in matthew 13 that described that the disciples asked jesus a question they said why do you speak to them in parables he said because it's not given unto them he said but it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom now here jesus was telling the disciples that one group that's given to know the mysteries and one group that's not given to know the mysteries and then he said in matthew 13 16 he said blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears foreign they hear what is he telling not everybody can see and hear what you're seeing and hear it and you're blessed because why can't i believe because before all he was chosen to salvation to believe this gospel so notice the characteristics of the two seeds one can see one can't see one can hear one can't hear thus we can see why one is cursed and the other one is not cursed let's go back to first john the third chapter i'm going to come to a place to stop hopefully by the grace of god you'll give me just maybe a few more moments and then i'll pick up tonight where we don't finish up first john chapter 3 beginning with verse 8 now he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteous and not of god neither he that loveth not his brother notice this now in verse 8 it tells us that sin originated with satan for it said in verse 8 he that committed sinners of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning sin did not start on earth but sin started in heaven because in revelations chapter 12 verses 7 to 9 you'll find out that there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels and the reason was because in isaiah told us why that he exalted his will above the will of god and when satan exalted his will above the will of god there was a war in heaven and satan was cast out to earth and in ezekiel 28 13 we're not going to read it but i want you to hold this for later use in ezekiel 28 13 the bible speaking concerning satan said thou hast been in eden the garden of god here sin originates with satan in heaven but now we find satan coming down to earth then in verse 9 it tells us that god has a seed and his seed produces his nature for he said whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remain remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god the reason they can't sin is because his seed his seed is in them now if god's children produce his nature then the curse shall reproduce the nature of him that holds his seed now notice this now satan was a deceiver because in revelation 12 and 9 the bible said this and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and satan now notice this wording now which deceiveth the whole world satan deceiveth the whole world now remember that jesus said i pray for them but not the world and here he said in revelation 12 9 that the devil deceiveth the whole world why because the seed of god was not in them they're blind they cannot see blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear but guess what the children of god cannot be deceived because they are not the world seed of god the elected of god those of ephesians one and four according to his chosen us in them before the foundation of the world they cannot be deceived don't you understand that that is why god is so gracious to allow us to cast our beliefs aside and accept the word of god because the elect of god cannot be deceived in first john 3 12 it tells us that cain's worked for evil while abel's was righteous right first john 3 12. let's read the scripture he said not as cain was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew him because his own works were evil and his brothers were righteous what was what are we seeing here we're seeing each seed producing after its kind the tear can only be a tear because his that's a seed life that is in it the wheat can only be weak because that's a seed life that is in it and here cain worked with evil abel's works was righteous because of the seed that was in them in hebrews 11 and 4 you don't have to turn to that one but it says by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain did by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gift and it by it being yet dead yet speaking i want you to understand something here we are now blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for this here father why do you speak unto them in parables because it's not given unto them to know the mysteries of the kingdom accuracy a blessing now when it comes time for these two boys cain and abel to come and to try to find a relationship and fellowship back with god here both boys come both are bringing their sacrifice to god because both of them want to enter back into relationship and fellowship with god but notice when they come to present their sacrifices their sacrifices is on two ends of the spectrum one is blood the other one is the fruit of the ground and cain offered the very thing that god cursed remember he told adam he said adam you're not cursed he said but cursed is the ground for thy sake but able by revelation saw something that his brother could not see and he looked into the mind of god and he knew that it was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and by faith he offered god a lamb knowing that he saw something that cain couldn't see notice now first john 3 9. first john 3 9 i'm going to come to a stopping place in just a moment just give me a few more moments first john 3 9 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is not is now born of god this phrase born of god means proceeded forth and came from god a child comes from a seed a child i want you to grab that now a child comes from a seed and the seed is in the loins of the father the thing that constitutes a child is it first had to be a seed the only reason you're here today is because of the seed that was in your father's lawn and so the to the thing that comes through the child is you had to be a seed and the life of the child comes from the father so if i am a child of god when did i become his child this is an important question well brother chris i was you know i went to the altar on such and such a date is that when i become a child of god no that's when you only come to the recognition of who you really was in god amen because see turn with hebrews 7 and 9 because as i said i'm not just saying these things these are things that are in the word of god and the problem with of it is is because we have failed to go to the word of god to see what the bible says and we've just accepted our child as beliefs as being right and i don't want to do that because if i take beliefs that are contrary to the word of god according to paul he said that i'm cursed and i am removed from the gospel of christ hebrews 7 and 9. and as i may say or as i may so say leave thy also who receiveth tithe paid tithes in abraham now notice this now levi also who receiveth ties paid tithes in abraham now if you are versed in the scripture you'll know that abraham is levi's great great grandfather and when levi was born abraham was already gone but yet levi paid tithes while in the loins of abraham god recognized levi generations before he ever came forth upon the earth god looked at the street line and because abraham paid tithes and levi was part of his seed he was accounted for paying tithes also i hope you see that so when does god recognize us as his children ephesians 1 4 again according as he has chosen us in him not when we're born not when you just come to the altar but god recognizes you because of a seed line a seedline and based upon the seedline god recognizes you as his children or not his children when was our name put on the book of life go ahead well brother chris i went to the altar and god wrote my name in his book no he didn't i know what the bible says let's read the bible revelation 13 8 13 7-8 revelations chapter 13 verse 7 and 8. and it was given unto them to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him notice now whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so when i come to the altar and give my heart to the lord that wasn't when god wrote my name down the reason i was able to come to the altar was because my name was already in the book because as levi paid tithes in the loins of abraham god recognized me generations and way back before the foundation of the world i was in the loins of god and god placed my name in the book before there was even a world so only the only names in the lamb's book is the children of god that was chosen in him before the foundation of the world now remember some ordained to some more life to death some's name was in the book some's names wasn't in the book these before old were ordained to condemnation because they was not in the seedling abraham they wasn't in his loins as levi was so to speak amen so those whose names are not in the book cannot be god sees they are of that cursed seed notice again in first john first john 3 9 whosoever is born of god whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god then he said in second timothy the second chapter verse 19 he said the lord knoweth them that are his the lord knoweth them that are his so let me say this to you a father knows who his children are now with this in mind let's turn to matthew 7. i'll make these last points and then we'll pick up tonight matthew chapter 7 verse 17 to 23 even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit i want you to listen to the word hear jesus speaking now even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit and a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is tuned down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruit you shall know them not everyone that saith unto me lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say of me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will profess unto them i never knew you now paul to timothy said the lord knoweth them that are kids and now jesus speaking he said in that day there's going to be people that's going to come they're going to say lord did we not prophesy did not cast out devils in your name and he's going to say unto them depart from me you worship in the truth i never knew you now here we find jesus speaking of two trees one is called the good tree the other is called the corrupt tree and in verse 18 he tells us that the good tree can't produce evil fruit i want you to get this now because it's important for when we pick up tonight he tells us that the good tree can't produce evil fruit and the corrupt tree can't produce or he said the good tree can't produce evil fruit in the corrupt tree can't produce good fruit because it's only it can only produce what's in the sea good tree good fruit evil tree evil fruit then in verse 19 he tells us that the corrupt tree or the cursed what he tells us they are because notice what he says and every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit and shoot down and cast into the fire remember matthew chapter 25 41 he said those on the left hand you curse children curse he said unto everlasting fire when you start putting the bible together you see the pictures starting coming together there is a good tree there's a corrupt tree the good tree brings forth seed life passes seed you take an apple tree it'll bear forth fruit cut the apple open the seed in it take that seed planted into the ground what are you going to get another apple you're not going to get something contract so the life that is within the tree is the only life that it can produce so a good tree can only produce good fruit it cannot produce something evil a good tree cannot produce something evil a cursed tree can produce a cursed product though right verses 21 to 23 depicts a group of religious people that worship god but their worship was in vain because in verse 23 declares to them that he did not know them now remember that according to second timothy 2 19 the lord knoweth them that are his because they were born of him and came from him cain was just as religious as abel was right they both offered sacrifices to god and verse 20 says that you will know them by the type of fruit it produces abel offered a lamb cain offered that which was cursed amen let's stand tonight we'll pick up on this go a little bit further with it just slay these things into your hearts to your minds because it's important that we don't just take beliefs things that that's just been fostered to us that my mom's taught me my dad's taught me the church has always taught me the saints of god we've got to be careful that the only ones that's going to make it is those that believe this whole word of god everything else paul said will remove you from the gospel of christ and he said if any man come preaching any other gospel than what this bible says he said let that man be accursed and those that believe that cursed word are cursed right with it but you know what the amazing thing about it is the elect of god cannot be deceived because satan can only deceive the world and jesus said speaking to the elect he said i pray for them what was he praying for he was praying that we would not be deceived that we would come to the full revelation of his word i pray for them but i don't pray for the world i'm glad to this morning because i know of an assurance within my heart that i'm part of them that jesus prayed for i know of assurance that i'm one of those that was chosen god before the foundation of the world and he placed my name on the book then when i came to hear the word of god i believe i didn't just take some man's ideas for it i didn't just take what somebody taught me but i wanted to know what the bible had to say amen let's just bow our hearts to the lord this morning heavenly father we're just lord so in awe at your word god realizing that lord that heaven and earth have passed away but your word won't god we realize that even as we close with the scripture father no we'll pick up on it again tonight but in matthew 7 there was people lord that came lord they had prophecy they had signs they had wonders they had miracles but there was something that they didn't have and lord whatever they lacked that's what i want because god i realize that the fruit of the believer because you said in matthew 7 and 20 wherefore by their fruits you shall know them lord by simply looking at the word i realize and i know that the fruit of a believer is not sign wonders and miracles the fruit of the believer isn't whether a person prophesies it isn't whether they speak in tongues it isn't whether they run up and down the aisles because father we know that according to the word there's going to be a lot of people that's going to do that that you're going to still even declare i never knew you you didn't come for me you didn't proceed from me and but father i want to be accounted as those that you declare welcome my good and faithful servant lord not just someone that that fostered beliefs that was contrary to the word of god but lord i want to be one of those that was so humble myself god that i won't try to take things and filter it through my beliefs but god i'll take your word for what it says lord knowing god that when everything else fails and everything else passes away it's your word that's going to remain and lord it's going to be those that are standing and are founded within your unadulterated word god that is going to be accounted as a seed of the righteous we just asked it lord that you take what we've read the things we've spoken this morning god knowing we've covered a lot of scripture maybe even brought a lot of things out that maybe the people hasn't looked at but lord it's in your word and that's what i believe father help us this morning god that we won't reject your truth god that we won't just turn it down because it's contrary to what our parents have taught us god is contrary to what maybe the church that we was raised in has taught us but god let us so humble ourselves that we'll say lord i was taught wrong and today i accept your word as the truth of god we just commit our lives into your hands for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen
