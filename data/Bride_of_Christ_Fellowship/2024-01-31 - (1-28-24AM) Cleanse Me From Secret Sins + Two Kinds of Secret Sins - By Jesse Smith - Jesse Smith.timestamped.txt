[0:01] Psalm chapter
[0:04] 19:12 i' like to preach a simple sermon
[0:06] today on cleansing from Secret sins I
[0:09] like to preach on that today uh by God's
[0:12] grace this kind of comes on the uh you
[0:14] know the heels of brother Dennis's
[0:16] message you know uh messages rather how
[0:19] many enjoyed those everybody enjoyed
[0:21] those
[0:22] amen I was so blessed uh listening to
[0:26] those psalm
[0:28] 19:12
[0:36] so Lord willing will'll look at this
[0:37] thought here this morning and then uh
[0:39] tonight like I said we'll do a a kids
[0:41] Bible study or children's Bible study
[0:43] and I want to share a couple things that
[0:44] are kind of uh important to the message
[0:46] you know like I shared on on uh Sunday
[0:50] or Wednesday there's been another sort
[0:52] of Prophecy that someone's going to be
[0:54] healed um and this group has had other
[0:57] prophecies that have failed
[1:00] um regarding people being healed and so
[1:03] just something I'm watching and I want
[1:06] to be uh cautious
[1:08] of
[1:10] uh you know the same group that calls
[1:12] himself the greatest of all time has had
[1:14] this happen and and you know no doubt we
[1:16] see I you know we've see great
[1:18] testimonies come out of their lives and
[1:20] so forth uh wonderful moves of God but
[1:23] at the same time um just something to
[1:25] watch there I'd like to share that by
[1:27] God's grace so Psalm
[1:48] 19:12 let's read that together if we can
[1:51] on three one 2 3 who can understand his
[1:55] errors cleanse thou me from Secret
[1:58] faults amen May God as his Blessing to
[2:00] reading of his word you may be seated
[2:02] praise
[2:05] God so it's good to be back with the
[2:07] Saints today Hallelujah and very happy
[2:10] again to be in the house of the Lord
[2:11] with all the saints of like Precious
[2:13] Faith every time I'm gone I miss you
[2:14] Saints so I'm I'm really glad to see
[2:16] everybody back together Hallelujah wish
[2:18] looking forward to that one great
[2:19] reunion day when we'll always be
[2:21] together with Jesus and amen we have all
[2:23] eternity and um we'll just have a grand
[2:25] time in the Lord hallelujah I like what
[2:28] the scripture says uh we shall ever be
[2:30] with the Lord I like that I want to
[2:32] spend eternity with the Lord Jesus and
[2:34] of course with you um but we're looking
[2:36] forward to that great great wonderful
[2:38] day by God's grace but here we're
[2:40] fighting the the the the good fight of
[2:42] Faith praise God and God's word always
[2:44] gives us Victory praise the Lord so
[2:46] we're happy to be in the house of the
[2:47] Lord today and like I said I just want
[2:49] to kind of uh preach based off of some
[2:52] of the inspiration that I heard you know
[2:53] from Brother Dennis's sermons I only got
[2:55] to listen to them one time uh you know I
[2:57] got sick on uh Friday so I was sick
[3:01] Friday and a little bit of Saturday you
[3:03] I was so thankful I didn't get sick that
[3:05] whole time you know my my family was
[3:07] sick for about six or eight weeks and I
[3:08] never got sick the whole time but then
[3:11] it came to me on uh Thursday night I
[3:13] tried to rebuke it and I did it it it
[3:15] stayed off a few hours but then it came
[3:16] to me um and then you know had to deal
[3:19] with that but I I recovered so quickly
[3:22] all was I can do is say thank the Lord
[3:23] like I felt like a new person it only
[3:25] last like a day and a half I'm like
[3:26] thank God if I'm going to get sick
[3:28] that's what I want to do just a short
[3:30] sickness but uh God was gracious I know
[3:33] my wife helped me with some herbs and
[3:34] you know all this all this good healing
[3:36] stuff uh so I was very thankful for that
[3:40] uh but if you didn't hear from me the
[3:41] last few days because I've been battling
[3:43] but uh I'm feel much better you know by
[3:45] yesterday night I was back to 100% I
[3:47] feel like myself again amen and so I'm
[3:49] good to be uh I'm glad to be here and
[3:51] Feeling Good by God's grace you I was
[3:53] wondering on Friday am I have to call
[3:54] Simon last minute I going we have to do
[3:56] a tape service or something like that
[3:58] but Jesus really stepped in and helped
[4:00] us out there so I'm thankful for God's
[4:02] Amazing Grace I know you've seen it in
[4:03] your life too you know God God many
[4:05] times would do exceedingly abundantly
[4:07] above all we ask or think praise God and
[4:10] so I count that a blessing today uh just
[4:12] to be with you I count it a real
[4:13] blessing praise God so I want to look at
[4:16] this thought of cleansing from Secret
[4:18] sins and there's there's two aspects as
[4:20] I meditated on this and you know since
[4:22] hearing brother Dennis's sermons I think
[4:23] I put them up I posted them on last
[4:25] Monday if I'm not mistaken or maybe
[4:27] Sunday night I can't remember when I got
[4:29] those actually on there but then I
[4:30] listened to them on Monday morning and I
[4:31] was really blessed and I don't know if
[4:34] you've known it or not I think I told
[4:35] you this but if I didn't I'm sorry but
[4:37] brother Dennis has what we believe is a
[4:39] gift of
[4:40] discernment so remember discernment is
[4:42] judging the secrets and thoughts intents
[4:44] of the heart and there's uh you know
[4:47] that's one of the nine gifts of the Holy
[4:49] Spirit and I talked to them he and I
[4:50] went to Aladdin on Saturday after I
[4:52] picked him up I always take the
[4:54] preachers out to eat but I thought uh I
[4:56] really want to have a good talk with
[4:57] this brother I don't want to take him to
[4:58] Chipotle cuz they got got rap music you
[5:00] know you know sometimes I'm affected by
[5:02] that not all the time but sometimes I'm
[5:04] affected by that I really want to have a
[5:06] good conversation with him so I thought
[5:08] what restaurant can I take him to that
[5:09] doesn't have rock and roll so we went to
[5:12] Aladdin and he noticed it right away
[5:13] Aladdin is actually owned by a Christian
[5:15] at least that location CU my wife and I
[5:18] have talked with him uh he moved over
[5:20] here from uh the Middle East uh maybe
[5:23] eight or 10 years ago and I've told him
[5:25] God bless you and so we had just had a
[5:27] good talk in that atmosphere we both
[5:28] felt the holy Spirit while we were
[5:30] talking amen um and um you know some of
[5:35] the things he preached was what we were
[5:36] talking about on Saturday and then I
[5:39] preach some of those same things on
[5:41] Sunday and grown men grown men in their
[5:43] 50s 60s maybe probably 60s I I don't
[5:46] want I don't want to overestimate their
[5:48] ages but as we were talking we were
[5:50] talking about the Battle of sin and um
[5:54] you know uh putting down a stake in your
[5:57] in your spiritual land and saying I know
[5:59] God's given me this much
[6:01] Victory uh as far as even with the
[6:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost or any any
[6:06] spiritual blessing you've attained you
[6:07] know uh he and I were talking about that
[6:11] and uh and brother Den was like wow
[6:12] that's good and I my brother Bram said
[6:14] that and everything and uh so then when
[6:17] I was preaching on Sunday you know I
[6:18] felt led to preach that uh you know how
[6:21] Christians can have such Victory but
[6:23] then will fall short in a secret sin
[6:25] right like brother Brandon fell short
[6:27] with the critical spirit and I just went
[6:30] through some of those things while
[6:31] preaching that you know Paul said he
[6:33] said he did things he hated now Paul
[6:36] wouldn't reveal to us what sins they
[6:38] were he just said they were hateful sins
[6:41] so you don't have to confess and tell
[6:42] everybody all the details of your
[6:44] hateful sins just be honest right and
[6:46] say i' I've sinned yes um we know Peter
[6:49] you know uh of course the the the the
[6:51] segregation there between Gentiles we
[6:54] see his sin well no doubt he hated
[6:57] that but as I preach that you know you
[6:59] know the Holy Spirit kind of led me in
[7:00] that direction and uh just put a state
[7:03] down put a spiritual Mark and and
[7:05] remember God did this in my life and
[7:07] I've experienced such Victory here amen
[7:11] you know and let's not forget what God
[7:13] has done hallelujah don't forget where
[7:15] God has brought you from praise God Amen
[7:18] and You Know The Enemy will try to drive
[7:19] you back from that place where you've
[7:21] achieved you know brother Ram says
[7:22] footsteps are
[7:24] possession you know testimonies are are
[7:27] possession amen but then the enemy tries
[7:29] to drive you back remember it's a it's a
[7:31] constantly taken ground right it's a you
[7:33] take ground the enemy tries to push you
[7:34] back but you got to possess that you got
[7:36] to get back what you had and then take
[7:37] more ground amen amen and so just as I
[7:40] you know as brother Dennis and I talked
[7:42] about that I just saw how the Holy
[7:43] Spirit brought some of those same
[7:45] thoughts and then a brother would come
[7:47] up after his name's Andy there and he
[7:49] would come up and say brother Jesse I
[7:50] just needed to hear that actually two
[7:52] brothers told me that even brother Irvin
[7:54] and Brother Andy said all week I've been
[7:57] battling that I you know the devil's
[7:59] been tell me you don't have what you
[8:00] said you have and you're not even saved
[8:03] or you're not even forgiven and how
[8:05] could you do this and how could you do
[8:07] that and they were crying you know they
[8:08] were just weeping and and just thanking
[8:10] the Lord that uh that God had brought
[8:12] this word in here the word that you know
[8:15] uh the scripture tells us plainly that
[8:17] the footsteps of the righteous are order
[8:19] of the Lord right and then God God
[8:22] forgives all of our transgressions
[8:24] hallelujah amen and how God totally
[8:26] takes away all of our sin hallelujah
[8:28] amen as soon as we confess it it's
[8:30] abolished brother BR said it's like ink
[8:32] being put in a a bottle of bleach praise
[8:35] God and he said it breaks up and it goes
[8:37] back to what it was at the beginning but
[8:39] brother Adam says when Jesus uh died for
[8:41] all of our sins all that sin went back
[8:43] on Satan Hallelujah because he's the
[8:46] father of it all Hallelujah he said all
[8:48] that sin is broken up all your mistakes
[8:50] all your sins has been broken up and
[8:52] it's gone back to the one who caused all
[8:54] of it Satan Hallelujah the father of
[8:57] lies and so it was just very very
[8:59] special for me to see you know some of
[9:00] the things we talked about there in in
[9:02] our just our little Fellowship there and
[9:05] uh what was uh was was things that the
[9:08] Holy Spirit used to encourage these two
[9:09] brothers and I know the brothers both in
[9:11] their 60s and you know think about that
[9:13] I'm they're 60 years old and battling am
[9:16] I really forgiven or am I saved and
[9:18] we've all had those moments like the
[9:19] dark Seasons where uh Satan brings in
[9:22] all the
[9:23] questions are you sure you've done this
[9:25] are you sure God has done this for you
[9:27] are you sure of this are you sure of
[9:28] that but how God's word comes around to
[9:31] show us that we are more than conquerors
[9:32] in Christ Jesus amen that means we have
[9:35] more than more surpassing victories
[9:37] that's what that more than conquer means
[9:39] we have surpassing victories see we have
[9:42] victories but then we have victories
[9:44] beyond that that surpass some other
[9:46] victories praise God it means we have
[9:49] continual victories amen Victory after
[9:51] Victory Faith from Faith from glory to
[9:54] glory the light shining more unto a
[9:56] perfect day Hallelujah so I love to see
[9:59] how the Holy Spirit you know moves upon
[10:01] us and brother Dennis said he just had
[10:02] me on his heart back in December he's
[10:04] like I just want to reach out to brother
[10:05] Jesse and fellowship with him and that's
[10:07] when I was like I was like brother I've
[10:10] said so many times I'm going to invite
[10:11] you and I keep forgetting so I said I
[10:13] know this is God's will for you to come
[10:15] and how many believe it was God's will
[10:16] to hear him preach praise God Amen so I
[10:19] just rejoice in that I love how God
[10:20] orchestrates it so I'll send you out the
[10:22] dates but I asked him to come back and
[10:24] preach our anniversary services in June
[10:27] that'll be our 18th Church anniversary
[10:29] so I want brother Dennis to preach that
[10:30] by God's grace but just keep that in
[10:32] mind you know when brother you know
[10:33] people said that about brother Diggs and
[10:35] brother uh uh brother McBride and it
[10:38] works on both ends as long as we're
[10:40] living
[10:41] Sanctified then God's gifts can operate
[10:43] and as long as the preacher is living as
[10:45] Sanctified as possible then those gifts
[10:48] operate so that ought have been in good
[10:49] encouragement that people are living
[10:51] pure before God am Hallelujah if you saw
[10:55] uh God's spirit operate there through
[10:57] brother Dennis and you know your heart
[10:59] in life was discerned or like I told you
[11:01] when Simon came the one time I I texted
[11:03] him nine discernments of my heart in one
[11:06] sermon on a Wednesday night God God
[11:08] don't care if it's Wednesday night or
[11:10] Sunday morning amen God just wants
[11:12] people that are hungry for the word of
[11:14] God hallelujah
[11:15] amen and so you know we know if we if we
[11:18] if we trust in the Lord with all of our
[11:20] hearts and lean not on our own
[11:22] understanding then God uh you know God
[11:24] will direct our paths praise God and he
[11:26] will discern you know our our lives for
[11:29] for us so I got this you know thought
[11:31] from that uh sermon he preached the
[11:33] morning of course the evening was more
[11:35] the same but I just found in studying
[11:37] this that there's two types of secret
[11:39] sins I don't know if you found this in
[11:41] the scripture but I found this in my sec
[11:44] I'm sorry my searching the
[11:46] scriptures because you know church I
[11:48] told you this numerous times but I've
[11:49] always prayed this Lord please let my
[11:52] sins just be between you and I well I
[11:55] never realized until brother Dennis
[11:56] preached that what does that mean that
[11:58] means I'm going going to battle my
[11:59] secret
[12:01] sins does everybody understand like I
[12:04] want to live so close to Christ that
[12:06] nobody can see me sin now I know it's
[12:08] not possible but I want to get as close
[12:11] as I can
[12:13] Hallelujah where people just see he's a
[12:15] Godly brother he loves the Lord and he's
[12:17] walking in the with the Lord that's just
[12:19] my request I want people to look at me
[12:21] and I want to be a city on a hill that
[12:23] cannot be hidden I want to shine for
[12:26] Jesus Christ amen you understand saying
[12:30] but I I realized after we preach that
[12:33] wow every sin I have is a secret sin
[12:36] then in most cases now my family could
[12:38] probably see some of my shortcomings I
[12:40] get upset or frustrated or not as
[12:42] patient as I should be I hope I'm not
[12:44] angry with my children too much you know
[12:46] with with sinful anger I hope not uh but
[12:49] I just you know I just realized that
[12:51] after we preached that I'm like I have
[12:53] secret sins in other words that nobody
[12:55] knows about like Paul had right right
[12:59] like he didn't tell any he didn't tell
[13:01] us all the
[13:03] details but then brother Dennis brought
[13:05] out the secret sins of
[13:07] aen right wasn't that his text yes and
[13:11] brother R preach about preached about
[13:12] that of course in adoption part one uh
[13:15] 1960 and how it relates there uh to the
[13:19] believer and so I realized that there's
[13:22] two types of secret sins and then we
[13:24] read where
[13:25] David David a man after God's Own Heart
[13:30] where he had secret
[13:32] sins but wasn't he saved brother Jess
[13:35] yes wasn't he a man after God's Own
[13:37] Heart didn't he please God yes but he
[13:41] had secret sins as well now some of them
[13:44] came out you know the Bible says I read
[13:46] a few weeks ago in Chronicles the Bible
[13:48] said the only one that God recognized
[13:50] was the sin of bash Sheba and
[13:52] Uriah the Bible said David did all that
[13:55] was right think about that all a l David
[13:59] did all that was right except in the
[14:01] area of
[14:03] basheba I thought wow what Amazing Grace
[14:06] that's a kind of Grace I want God to
[14:08] have on my life amen amen you only you I
[14:10] mean think about that you sinned every
[14:12] day but I'm really only fell short in
[14:14] one
[14:15] area I don't I don't know how to explain
[14:17] that church but all I know is that's
[14:19] what God's word said hallelujah
[14:22] amen but but I found that there then
[14:25] there's there these two types of secret
[14:27] sins they secret sins of those who are
[14:31] worthy of
[14:34] judgment okay like
[14:37] achen there secret sins that are worthy
[14:39] of judgment as we'll show a little bit
[14:41] ananas and saf that's it's also a new
[14:44] testament thing as
[14:46] well there's secret sins that are worthy
[14:48] of judgment we'd say done by
[14:50] Sinners but then there's secret sins
[14:52] done by Saints which uh lead us to more
[14:57] sanctification or a pure heart a more
[15:00] Pure
[15:01] Heart okay and so this is what Paul
[15:04] talked about I'm just going to rehearse
[15:06] these real
[15:07] briefly um in Romans 7 I'm just going to
[15:10] rehearse this because I preached on this
[15:12] a few weeks
[15:13] ago Paul said in Romans 7:15 15 I do the
[15:18] things I hate but what I hate is what I
[15:22] do so that that's what you and I our
[15:24] secret sins when we have secret sins we
[15:28] hate that we do
[15:30] it but Paul said it's sin within me that
[15:34] does it he said it's no more I that does
[15:37] it but sin that dwelleth Within
[15:39] Me Hallelujah so these are the secret
[15:42] this is the elements of secret sin that
[15:43] we have to battle Paul said in Romans
[15:46] 7:23 I come into captivity to my sin I
[15:50] become a slave to my secret
[15:52] sins right so as I preach that Wednesday
[15:55] night we we we all come into a prison of
[15:58] our our own
[15:59] sin we we put ourselves in a prison to
[16:03] our sin now for how long that depends
[16:05] how long we want to enjoy the the
[16:06] pleasures of
[16:08] sin right but as soon as we want to get
[16:12] out God offers a way out hallelujah amen
[16:16] Paul says it I I come into captivity he
[16:19] says and then he calls himself in Romans
[16:22] 7:24 he said oh Wretched Man that I
[16:25] am so he recognized I have two parts to
[16:28] me I have a part of me that cannot sin
[16:31] the soul but I have a part of me that
[16:33] that sins and a wretched part of me a
[16:36] hateful part of me a part that I become
[16:39] a slave to sin and then he says he
[16:42] finishes the chapter I thank God through
[16:44] Jesus Christ amen what a way to end the
[16:47] chapter amen I thank God through Jesus
[16:50] Christ that I'm able to overcome this
[16:53] and then he tells us in the next chapter
[16:55] there's no condemnation because I walk
[16:57] after the spirit spirit and not the
[17:00] flesh amen so there we get the New
[17:03] Testament
[17:04] Foundation of having secret sins sins
[17:08] that we hate we do yet we can still
[17:11] overcome them by the grace of Goden
[17:13] Hallelujah now I want to get just share
[17:15] this thought briefly here I just want to
[17:17] spend maybe a minute on this thought but
[17:19] I look forward to God giving me more
[17:21] Revelation on this and and the thought
[17:24] is the death penalty
[17:26] question God gave aen the death penalty
[17:30] but he didn't give it to
[17:32] Cain did you ever think of that so I
[17:35] just I'm I'm I'm in one way I'm excited
[17:37] for God to show me the revelation of
[17:39] this at some point hopefully in the
[17:40] future God did not kill Cain and God
[17:43] even let him have a mark as the mark of
[17:46] the beast a prefigure of the mark of the
[17:49] beast right he had a physical Mark of
[17:52] the spiritual reprobate soul that he
[17:55] had interesting right but then uh but
[18:00] then of course you know he lets other
[18:02] Sinners live their entire lives out like
[18:05] Ahab or even
[18:07] Jezebel he lets these Sinners live such
[18:10] long
[18:11] lives but then he'll give the death
[18:14] penalty to aen for stealing we'd say
[18:16] just stealing now there's never a
[18:18] there's never a a uh there's never a a
[18:22] pass for any sin right but he stole
[18:24] clothes and a wedge of gold was it for
[18:28] just stealing you know gold and clothes
[18:31] he gets the immediate death sentence
[18:33] plus some of his family members because
[18:34] they knew of his
[18:36] sin so I just you know I'm looking to
[18:39] God to understand this here you know God
[18:42] would let Cain live but then he would
[18:44] take ain's life and his family he would
[18:47] let Cain live but then he would take
[18:49] ananas and saf's life for one
[18:53] lie because he said Satan has filled
[18:55] your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost
[18:59] so I don't know you know is that the
[19:00] Revelation when when someone gets filled
[19:02] with Satan does then God judge them and
[19:04] take them off the scene I don't
[19:07] know but one thing's for sure we want to
[19:10] confess our sins as soon as
[19:14] possible right we do not want to become
[19:16] workers of
[19:18] iniquity
[19:21] right uh the Bible said uh God will in
[19:24] John 15 God will Purge us and so if if
[19:30] we get purged like the pruning business
[19:32] that Malachi and Lydia are familiar with
[19:34] they're just going to have less branches
[19:36] for a while less branches but more
[19:38] branches will come amen and it will
[19:41] actually make you more fruitful amen and
[19:44] normally they're pruned in the season
[19:46] after
[19:47] harvest so you and I will get pruned and
[19:50] it'll seem like we have less fruit but
[19:52] God's in it all and God's going to bring
[19:55] you to a more fruitful season hallelujah
[19:57] amen amen so we're have seasons where
[20:00] we're going to look and say well it
[20:01] looks like I don't have as much fruit as
[20:03] I used to have but yet you did you know
[20:06] God uh gave you fruit to your life you
[20:08] have testimonies for your life is what
[20:10] I'm saying but you're going to go
[20:12] through Seasons where it seems like
[20:14] there's not as much testimony but
[20:16] friends be encouraged because God's a
[20:18] god of Seasons hallelujah amen God's a
[20:20] god of restoration Hallelujah God's a
[20:24] god of more fruit praise God more
[20:26] victories Hallelujah God's in that
[20:29] business but he's got to he's got to
[20:31] prune us hallelujah to bring forth more
[20:34] fruit and then what about Herod in Acts
[20:37] 12 Herod talks and one day and they say
[20:39] he's like a God and God smites him the
[20:42] angel Lord smites him dead right there
[20:44] how come he didn't get
[20:45] Grace like Cain
[20:48] got right so it's just interesting you
[20:51] know some secret sins God will have it
[20:54] seems like God just pours out that Swift
[20:56] judgment other times you know the Bible
[20:59] and even Judas for three and 1/2 years
[21:02] he had all that secret sin of being a
[21:03] thief and God let him go for three and a
[21:05] half
[21:06] years until Satan filled his heart right
[21:10] and then he went off and sold Jesus and
[21:11] then he went off and hung
[21:13] himself so just uh it's it's striking uh
[21:17] to think of these things and as
[21:20] Christians we should always ask for
[21:21] Mercy praise God ask Mercy on ourselves
[21:25] trust in the mercy that we've received
[21:27] with and also ask Mercy for our friends
[21:29] and loved
[21:30] ones that God maybe perhaps could use us
[21:34] to share God's word with them to bring
[21:36] them to repentance praise God Amen
[21:38] because none of us want to see anyone
[21:40] taken off the scene prematurely right we
[21:43] all want to see people come to the
[21:45] Saving Grace we know not all will be
[21:47] saved but I feel like God would place as
[21:49] it as it were if we're Abraham I believe
[21:51] God would would Place Lots in our lives
[21:54] praise God where God would remember our
[21:57] prayer the Bible said God remembered the
[21:59] prayer of Abraham praise God God
[22:02] remembered that high that Priestly
[22:04] prayer of Abraham amen and we're Kings
[22:06] and Priests unto God
[22:08] hallelujah God remembered the prayer of
[22:10] his priest Hallelujah because a priest
[22:12] is an intercessor between God and man
[22:14] Hallelujah and that's where God's placed
[22:17] us as priests between the living and the
[22:19] dead praise
[22:20] God Amen so I'm looking for more
[22:24] Revelation on that why does God
[22:26] sometimes let him go and then remember
[22:27] the said some men's sins go before them
[22:31] others a others men's sins await them at
[22:34] the Judgment in other words there's so
[22:36] many judases out there that can hide
[22:38] their sins and we don't really see it
[22:41] yeah but all everything will be made
[22:43] known on that
[22:44] day brother R said that and the Bible
[22:46] says it too the fiery eyes of Jesus will
[22:48] burn through any uh
[22:51] pretending and there will no no one be
[22:53] able to hide anything from Jesus on that
[22:55] day the Bible says he's got eyes of Fire
[22:58] fire so my prayer is Lord show me my
[23:00] secret faults now praise God cleanse me
[23:03] of my secret faults now like David said
[23:05] Hallelujah cleanse me now Purge me now
[23:08] let my purging be be in my lifetime
[23:10] praise God Amen so I don't have to be
[23:13] purged later during the tribulation or
[23:14] something like that but God let me be
[23:16] purged now for my secret faults
[23:18] hallelujah
[23:20] amen oh my so I hope you can see those
[23:24] those two thoughts here we have secret
[23:26] sins that lead to IM mediate judgment on
[23:28] this Earth but then the believer has
[23:31] secret sins that God is merciful
[23:34] upon there secret sins that judgment
[23:36] gets poured out but Believers have
[23:38] secret sins God shows mercy and I'm very
[23:41] grateful for God's mercy Hallelujah each
[23:44] person would
[23:45] be
[23:47] Hallelujah and I just want to look at
[23:49] that David thought you know a lot of
[23:50] these verses were written through the
[23:53] holy or by the Holy Spirit through
[23:55] David uh in 1st Samuel 134 14 uh Saul
[23:59] had disobeyed the Lord and uh Samuel
[24:02] said but now thy kingdom shall not
[24:05] continue the Lord has sought him a man
[24:08] after his own heart and the Lord hath
[24:10] commanded him to be Captain over his
[24:12] people because thou has not kept that
[24:14] which the Lord commanded thee so I love
[24:17] this before David even slays Goliath
[24:19] before David is even King God already
[24:22] recognizes him as a man after his own
[24:25] heart in other words God had four
[24:26] knowledge that David would love God
[24:28] hallelujah amen just like job God sees
[24:32] you in your perfect condition hallelujah
[24:34] amen God sees you as a Believer forgiven
[24:38] as a Son of God hallelujah God sees you
[24:41] in that finished condition praise God
[24:44] Amen even before the victories or even
[24:47] before the
[24:49] failures right even before that God sees
[24:52] you as a child of God just like God told
[24:54] Jeremiah I ordain you a prophet to the
[24:57] Nations Hallelujah before I form you in
[24:59] the womb I knew you praise
[25:02] God that means he knew my faults he knew
[25:05] my good he knew my bad but he still knew
[25:07] I was his son he still knew you were his
[25:10] daughter hallelujah
[25:12] amen he still knew that praise God this
[25:14] was all for known by I love how God
[25:17] chooses to look at the positive and not
[25:19] the negative amen praise the lord
[25:24] lord Psalm 25 verse 7 if you pull that
[25:27] up there
[25:31] did you ever see this I heard a preacher
[25:32] preach this the other day I was like
[25:34] unbelievable uh Psalm 257 remember not
[25:37] the sins of my youth this is a Psalm of
[25:41] David nor my transgressions according to
[25:44] thy mercy remember thou me for thy
[25:47] goodness sake oh Lord now you can apply
[25:49] leave this up here just a moment you can
[25:50] apply this numerous ways he could mean
[25:52] his youth you know from a child or a
[25:54] teenager or just you know a young man
[25:57] man even you know let's say David I
[26:00] think he died what was it 80 I forget he
[26:02] he reigned 40
[26:04] years 70 good okay was it 30 years he
[26:08] was 30 years old when he became king and
[26:09] he reigned 40 years yes 70 good bless
[26:11] your
[26:12] heart so died at 70 so he might have
[26:15] wrote this and thought about well when I
[26:17] was 30 or when I was 50 when I committed
[26:19] that with bash was around 50 or 55 the
[26:21] midlife
[26:23] crisis and uh but I like this he's a man
[26:28] after God's Own
[26:30] Heart but he still had his past would
[26:33] sometimes come back to haunt
[26:34] him the devil would bring up all those
[26:37] things that God already forgave and the
[26:38] church
[26:40] said I love what David said but God
[26:42] never saw that right now God wasn't
[26:44] going to remember that but I like how he
[26:47] even prayed it he said Lord remember not
[26:50] my sins of my youth now he was a child
[26:53] the B he's the one that even wrote a man
[26:56] sorry uh in in sin my mother conceived
[26:58] me in other words that sin nature passed
[27:02] from my mother and father into me I
[27:04] always had a sin nature I've always
[27:06] sinned so even this man after God's Own
[27:09] Heart you know he a sinned as a child
[27:11] now we picture David out there as a
[27:12] shepherd and he's singing and praying
[27:14] the whole time but sometimes he maybe
[27:16] said some bad words to those sheep I
[27:17] don't
[27:18] know maybe he despised that his dad we
[27:20] know his dad was was against him maybe
[27:23] despise his dad yeah right maybe you
[27:25] speak against your parents right now
[27:27] children don't say Amen but I'm sure at
[27:29] some point you upset with your
[27:31] parents why did my dad do this why did
[27:34] my mom do
[27:35] that but David said Lord forgive me of
[27:38] those things amen amen because you can't
[27:42] help it that sin Nature's uh it's
[27:44] already in you it's the part of us we
[27:48] hate it's our biggest enemy that's but
[27:52] we also got our biggest Victory on the
[27:53] inside as well Hallelujah the spirit of
[27:57] God Amen amen amen but I love
[28:00] this God calls him a man after for his
[28:03] own heart and yet he had a sinful youth
[28:06] just like you
[28:07] did no different just like all of us we
[28:11] have this in other words we have secret
[28:12] sin even as a child or teenager right as
[28:18] a teenager David slays Goliath and now
[28:21] they're singing songs to him you ever
[28:22] think you got a little pride in there
[28:25] maybe maybe when was the last time
[28:28] somebody sang songs about
[28:31] you Austin has slayed his 10, thousands
[28:35] you know I'll just put your name in
[28:36] there but Hosea slain his
[28:39] 10,000 I mean there had to be at some
[28:41] point some type of sin because the Bible
[28:44] said we sin every
[28:46] day right but he was able always to
[28:49] confess his sins amen he's always able
[28:52] to say God please don't remember my
[28:55] sinful
[28:56] youth
[28:58] hallelujah
[28:59] amen so he would had have sins before he
[29:02] defeated the bear he would had sins
[29:05] before he defeated the line so Church
[29:07] take that as an encouragement praise God
[29:09] God will forget your past and then he'll
[29:11] give you victories in the present
[29:14] hallelujah hallelujah the thing to do is
[29:16] forget your past amen put your past
[29:19] behind you confess it and take God at
[29:22] his word and now fight the good fight of
[29:24] Faith hallelujah amen amen David had to
[29:27] do that he had to have sins in his life
[29:31] but he said Lord do not remember them
[29:34] hallelujah
[29:35] amen and if God forgave them under the
[29:37] blood of bulls and goats how much more
[29:40] us gracious Hallelujah according to thy
[29:43] mercy remember thou me for thy goodness
[29:46] sake oh
[29:48] Lord remember a sinner saved by grace
[29:51] why so I can magnify your goodness amen
[29:54] so I can talk tell others about the
[29:56] goodness of God
[29:57] amen I will sing of the goodness of God
[30:00] Amen all my life he's been faithful
[30:03] that's what David is saying here Lord
[30:05] forgive my past don't remember my
[30:07] youthful sins and everyone will tell
[30:10] everyone will hear me tell of your
[30:11] goodness to me amen the Lord Psalm 32
[30:16] verse1 if you put that up
[30:20] there some more scriptures about the
[30:22] blessedness of God a Psalm of David Mill
[30:26] m chill I can't know how to say that one
[30:29] blessed is he whose transgression Is
[30:30] Forgiven whose sin is covered now that
[30:33] was covered on the blood of bulls and
[30:34] goats but now it's abolished like the
[30:37] law could only cover sin it would hide
[30:39] your sin but now the sin's already been
[30:41] paid for amen and it's been sent away
[30:46] Glory blessed is the man whom the Lord
[30:49] imputeth not iniquity who wrote this
[30:51] David and in whose Spirit there is no
[30:54] pretending or guile hallelujah amen
[30:58] blessed is man I'm sorry yeah we'll stop
[31:00] right there so David's the one that
[31:02] wrote
[31:03] this God has blessed those those whose
[31:07] sins he covers over it's a blessing that
[31:09] God forgives our
[31:11] sins that person if we could think of a
[31:14] word what would you call them favored
[31:16] highly favored David said I'd call them
[31:18] blessed amen that's how you name a a
[31:21] forgiven son or daughter of God call
[31:24] them the blessing of the Lord hallelujah
[31:27] Psalm 654 H Psalm 654 blessed is the man
[31:31] whom thou
[31:34] chooses and caus us to approach unto
[31:36] thee that he may dwell in thy courts we
[31:38] shall be satisfied with the goodness of
[31:40] thy house even of thy Holy Temple I love
[31:43] this just like I share with that
[31:44] Junction City I didn't choose to go to
[31:46] them God chose me to go to them I just I
[31:49] just like these reminders from God that
[31:52] I didn't choose God God chose
[31:55] me and if God chose me then he allowed
[31:57] me to come before him praise God and if
[32:00] God chose me like he chose David then
[32:03] God is only going to look at my good
[32:04] parts
[32:05] amen God's going to forgive all my bad
[32:07] parts because he chose me praise
[32:10] God here's another one about choosing
[32:12] Psalm 9412 blessed is a man whom thou
[32:17] chastenest it's a blessing for God to
[32:19] rebuke me amen it's a blessing when God
[32:21] spanks me in my secret sins God sends
[32:24] Dennis McBride to spank us or you
[32:27] understand any service right where you'd
[32:29] be corrected how many appreciate the
[32:30] correction of the Lord blessed is the
[32:33] man whom thou chasen us oh Lord and
[32:35] teaches him out of thy law amen the word
[32:38] of Teach Me Lord if I'm wrong show me in
[32:40] the word how I can get the victory
[32:42] praise
[32:43] God verse 13 that thou mayest give him
[32:46] rest for the from the days of his
[32:49] adversity I've gone through many days of
[32:50] Trials I fought this sin very long time
[32:53] it's been a battle with this secret sin
[32:55] but give me rest from that day of
[32:57] adversity praise God give me a season of
[32:59] Grace give me a season of Joy
[33:02] Hallelujah give me a fresh start
[33:04] Hallelujah give me rest from all these
[33:06] trials
[33:09] amen until the pit be digged for the
[33:12] wicked Lord take care of this enemy take
[33:14] this evil spirit away from me right but
[33:17] we got the authority many times to tell
[33:19] Satan get behind me right we've got
[33:21] Authority many
[33:23] times so we're blessed to be called
[33:26] We're Blessed to be forgiven uh we're
[33:28] we're blessed to be chosen by God and
[33:30] we're blessed to be corrected by God
[33:34] remember David repeated this in Romans
[33:35] 4:4 now to him that worketh is the
[33:38] reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt
[33:40] we don't earn our salvation but to him
[33:43] that worketh not but believeth on him
[33:45] that justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[33:48] counted for righteousness see just
[33:51] believing that God has forgiven me
[33:54] that's
[33:55] righteousness now you've got faith
[33:57] that you just believe God forgave you
[33:59] because God said he
[34:01] would you just believe God's grace you
[34:04] believe in God's mercy that's what
[34:06] brings salvation not because you worked
[34:08] and you did something but because you
[34:10] accepted God at his face value of his
[34:14] Worden amen verse
[34:17] six even as David also describeth the
[34:20] blessedness of this man unto whom God
[34:23] imputeth righteousness without works
[34:27] amen wow so David said God gives you
[34:30] righteousness without any of your
[34:33] Works amen wow Malachi you really did
[34:35] all these wonderful works and on the
[34:36] piano and all these other works that
[34:39] that must be why you're righteous no you
[34:42] got righteousness just because you
[34:43] believe God forgives
[34:45] you you just believe God you take God at
[34:48] his word amen amen and then you show
[34:50] your appreciation then you're zealous
[34:52] for good works because of the goodness
[34:54] God has shown you praise God
[34:59] verse 7 saying blessed are they whose
[35:01] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[35:04] are covered blessed is the man to whom
[35:07] the Lord will not impute sin oh my amen
[35:10] hallelujah amen I want to read this one
[35:13] again let's go to John chapter 8 I'd
[35:15] read this and shared this with a friend
[35:17] it just struck me as real
[35:25] sweet
[35:32] no it's not John
[35:38] 8 it's the woman caught in the act of
[35:42] adultery John is it john8 okay I thought
[35:46] see I was looking at the end of the
[35:47] chapter beginning it's the beginning
[35:52] amen yes thank you I appreciate that son
[35:55] thank you Hallelujah
[35:59] you know just remember this you know
[36:00] years ago I preach this Revelation I
[36:02] remember specifically you know we just
[36:03] moved into our house there in DL toown
[36:05] and I thought what is the revelation of
[36:07] God Jesus stooping
[36:09] twice and I waited all day on God for
[36:12] this Revelation brother Austin I sat
[36:14] there I remember I paced back and forth
[36:15] in our bedroom it was upstairs where the
[36:17] girls you know Haven I just paced back
[36:19] and forth God what is the Revelation
[36:21] stooping and then the song came to me
[36:23] stooping to woo to win to save my soul
[36:27] MH there was two stooping of the son of
[36:31] man the son of man stooped and the word
[36:35] became flesh in the life of Jesus Amen
[36:39] but brother R said that son of man gift
[36:41] was not shown to the Gentiles only the
[36:43] Jews and Samaritans got
[36:47] it glory amen this is one of those
[36:49] amazing Revelations I got to put on the
[36:51] video but he stooped again brother Ram
[36:54] said in order for God to be fair and
[36:55] just he he had to come as son of man
[36:58] again in the ministry of brother
[37:01] bradam amen so he stooped down and he
[37:04] expressed himself he wrote on the earth
[37:07] the word expressed itself on the earth
[37:10] hallelujah amen oh it's a beautiful type
[37:12] hallelujah amen and he spoke to the
[37:14] woman he spoke to the church
[37:16] hallelujah amen so see that the woman
[37:19] the woman caught adultery types the
[37:21] church how she was adultery to
[37:24] Christ but as Christ comes the second
[37:27] time here in the light in the ministry
[37:29] of brother Bram he tells
[37:32] her uh in verse 10 woman where are thine
[37:35] accusers hath no man condemned thee
[37:39] Glory now she had all these condemners
[37:42] but then Jesus said well who's worthy to
[37:45] condemn which of you have not sinned I
[37:48] imagine remember the oldest the wisest
[37:50] they're the ones that Dro their Stones
[37:52] first in other words the longer we live
[37:54] the the more we know how much we fall
[37:56] short of of God's
[37:58] glory right the more we're aware wow I
[38:01] really am a sinner saved by
[38:03] grace I'm not the prim and proper and
[38:06] perfect Christian I used used to think I
[38:08] was I was telling the brothers there in
[38:10] Junction City one time I said at one
[38:12] time in my Christian Life I had so much
[38:14] Zeal for God I thought I would never
[38:15] have like any secret
[38:17] sins and I said boy did I get a a
[38:20] reality
[38:21] check I thought well I'd never do this
[38:24] or I'd never do that and I didn't
[38:26] realize it was a little
[38:28] pride now there's still minor sins
[38:32] brother man said if you have if you do
[38:33] major sins you're not born again the
[38:35] Holy Ghost will keep you from major sins
[38:37] but little minor things I thought I'd
[38:39] never do I find myself doing them and
[38:41] the Lord had to Humble me so the older I
[38:44] get the more I realize I need God's
[38:47] grace so the woman so when Jesus says
[38:50] who's worthy to judge all the accusers
[38:53] leave and the woman's just left with her
[38:55] and Jesus that's how we got to see
[38:57] ourselves
[38:58] today we got to remember all these demon
[39:01] lies and all this mind battle we got to
[39:03] we got to remember they cannot accuse
[39:06] they're not the judge amen they don't
[39:09] have the final say hallelujah they're
[39:11] not worthy to judge us or anything like
[39:13] that in fact Jesus Will cast all those
[39:15] thoughts away Jesus will help us have
[39:18] victory over all these mind battles all
[39:20] these lies all these accusations and
[39:22] we've got to get to the spot where it's
[39:24] just us and Jesus Hallelujah
[39:27] amen and she said no man Lord is that
[39:29] how you feel nobody can accuse you
[39:32] today hallelujah amen that's how we
[39:35] should
[39:36] feel right and Jesus said to her neither
[39:39] do I condemn thee go and sin no more a
[39:42] woman who just a few moments ago was
[39:45] caught in the act of adultery Jesus says
[39:48] I don't condemn you now that shows the
[39:50] power and the swiftness of God's
[39:52] forgiving Grace
[39:54] hallelujah oh just minutes before before
[39:57] adulter adulter going to hell can't
[39:59] inherit the kingdom of God and then a
[40:00] few minutes later Jesus said I forgive
[40:03] you you can be part of the kingdom of
[40:05] God
[40:06] hallelujah oh my Amazing Grace How Sweet
[40:09] the Sound
[40:10] amen and saved a wret like
[40:13] me Hallelujah why because the son of man
[40:16] souped a second time
[40:19] Hallelujah he magnified himself he come
[40:22] down to earth and expressed the word of
[40:25] God on the the
[40:27] earth oh it's a beautiful
[40:30] thing and this this of course is before
[40:32] the cross right before the blood was
[40:34] actually shed and Jesus was already
[40:37] forgiving this way even before the blood
[40:41] was
[40:42] shed
[40:44] Hallelujah and so this is a good text
[40:46] here church if you just did a sin a few
[40:48] hours before church God has already
[40:50] forgiven you if you confessed it and he
[40:53] would not hold it against
[40:55] you you must have the desire though to
[40:58] sin no
[41:01] more right go and sin no more
[41:04] am
[41:06] Hallelujah and that's the joy of the
[41:08] Christian it's also sometimes the Mind
[41:10] Battle of a
[41:11] Christian but that's the joy of a
[41:13] Christian even no matter what I did
[41:14] before service or no matter what I did
[41:16] this week if I confess it and I really
[41:19] tell Jesus I'm sorry that he's faithful
[41:21] and just to forgive me of all
[41:23] unrighteousness amen and it proves right
[41:26] there pulled out of the bed of
[41:29] adultery I wonder how much clothes she
[41:31] had on but Jesus say I don't condemn you
[41:35] oh my Hallelujah she must have been a a
[41:37] forn daughter of God hallelujah blessed
[41:40] is one whom thou forgive us whose
[41:43] iniquities are covered hallelujah amen

[41:49] Sound let's get to our our text in Psalm
[41:53] 19 I didn't know how long this was going
[41:55] to be I thought well this my might be a
[41:56] short sermon but you never know with me
[41:58] you never
[41:59] know uh Psalm 197 I think I preached two
[42:02] hours last Sunday to The Junction City
[42:04] Saints it felt like five minutes I
[42:07] thought oh I'm getting my strength back
[42:08] now I could preach three hours
[42:10] sometime no Psalm 19 verse 7 so our text
[42:14] was in verse 12 but I just I looked at
[42:16] this chapter I thought wow what a
[42:18] beautiful chapter to see what what leads
[42:21] David up to write
[42:25] this and church this is what should lead
[42:27] us up to believe
[42:30] God the the perfectness of God's word in
[42:34] other words our our our uh our thoughts
[42:38] of God are so high you know uh we admire
[42:42] God so much our admiration for Jesus his
[42:45] majesty is so great it should make us
[42:47] want to cleanse Our Lives
[42:50] am like that brother preached at the
[42:52] youth meeting you know uh what's the
[42:54] cure for loneliness I still want to
[42:55] preach a sermon on this but it's just
[42:57] fellowship with the greatest being in
[42:59] the entire universe that's SEC cure for
[43:02] loneliness that he would stoop down
[43:04] there it is he stop down and spend time
[43:06] with me in my prayer time or my whever
[43:09] I'm whenever I'm fellowshipping with him
[43:11] that the King of Kings amen and the Lord
[43:14] of lords would spend time with me
[43:17] Hallelujah like that song brother amen
[43:19] sings how do I know cuz I talk to him
[43:22] today how do I get rid of loneliness how
[43:25] do I get rid of my trials how do I
[43:27] overcome this I talk to the king
[43:29] Hallelujah I talk to Jesus today praise
[43:32] God I showed him all my troubles all my
[43:34] sorrows praise God I'm feeling pretty
[43:36] good amen I've got sweating already by
[43:38] God's grace I thought well I'm sick I
[43:40] don't know how hard I'll be able to
[43:41] preach but I'm preaching pretty normal
[43:42] today the law of the Lord is perfect
[43:45] converting the
[43:47] soul the testimony of the Lord is sure
[43:51] making wise the simple see we were just
[43:54] simple Sinners right foolish but God
[43:56] makes us wise through his
[43:59] word the statues of the Lord are right
[44:03] rejoicing the heart see we had some we
[44:05] had some dancing on Wednesday night
[44:06] sorry I forgot to put that sermon public
[44:08] so I'm sorry if you want to go back and
[44:09] listen to that I'm sorry I forgot to
[44:10] make that public after preaching that on
[44:13] on Wednesday I'm just like I just can't
[44:15] preach that and not dance I can't I
[44:17] can't preach that and not praise the
[44:18] Lord and one of our girls was praying
[44:19] Lord let us have a dance service so God
[44:21] was working on both ends there
[44:25] Hallelujah I I I I can't go through
[44:27] these words and not rejoice that's right
[44:31] Hallelujah God God's done all this for
[44:33] me and I'm not going to thank him for
[44:34] what he's done I've gotta I've got to
[44:36] thank God look what he's done praise
[44:41] God the statues of God Rejoice the heart
[44:45] the Commandment of the Lord is pure
[44:47] enlightening the eyes so now we can we
[44:51] with with the purity of the Holy Ghost
[44:52] we can see situations perfectly amen
[44:56] right and we see we see you know these
[44:59] people are like our church we you know
[45:01] we see this these people are real
[45:03] Christians here we fall short of God's
[45:05] glory but we can see their purity they
[45:07] want to do what's right they want to
[45:10] serve God Amen but we've seen people
[45:12] come in and they haven't had that Purity
[45:15] because they get pulled back into the
[45:17] things of the world right and so some of
[45:20] their words and some of their songs or
[45:22] some of their testimonies they weren't
[45:23] in all real sincerity
[45:27] right because it's the purity of God
[45:29] that enlightens our eyes to really see
[45:31] what's in people's
[45:33] hearts amen the fear of the Lord is
[45:36] clean I like that enduring forever the
[45:39] judgments of the Lord are true and
[45:42] righteous all together so this is this
[45:45] is what David's saying leading up to
[45:47] this thought about secret
[45:50] sins wow god is perfect God converts my
[45:53] soul he's sure he makes me wise he's
[45:56] right he rejoices in my heart he's pure
[45:59] he's
[46:00] clean his words endure forever he's true
[46:04] he's
[46:05] righteous more to be desired are they
[46:08] than
[46:09] gold this Bible is more valuable than
[46:12] gold that's right and the church said if
[46:15] only a realized that right he took the
[46:17] wedge of
[46:18] gold this is more valuable than gold
[46:22] Hallelujah yay much than much fine gold
[46:26] sweeter also than honey and the
[46:31] honeycomb moreover by them is thy
[46:33] servant warned so he considered a
[46:36] privilege to be warned by God I love
[46:39] that in other words I don't want to I
[46:40] don't want to be sailing toward a
[46:42] cataract a a waterfall and not be warned
[46:45] I want God to warn me praise God Amen
[46:48] that's like does the Bible say something
[46:50] about sudden destruction I don't want to
[46:51] come upon sudden destruction I want God
[46:53] to warn me and that would be a sign that
[46:56] he loves me praise God
[46:59] hallelujah that'll be a real sign that
[47:01] God loves me that he will keep me from
[47:03] falling amen they'll keep me from
[47:06] falling
[47:07] Hallelujah that would be God's love to
[47:09] his
[47:13] servant and in keeping of them there is
[47:15] a great
[47:17] reward you know one time just on that
[47:19] warning thought after I did the debate
[47:21] against the the believe the sign
[47:23] people they did a video mocking me
[47:26] saying oh Jesse's just warning them
[47:27] Jesse's just warning the homosexuals
[47:29] he's just warning the trans people and
[47:32] they mocked me for
[47:34] that but then come to find out now
[47:36] another one of them uh another one
[47:39] that's left the message now they're
[47:40] accepting nonbinary people so trans
[47:43] people and they're they're they're
[47:45] they're rejoicing in
[47:47] that now see what happened Church they
[47:50] didn't take heed to the
[47:51] warning God can only warn people so many
[47:54] times right
[47:56] but I'm like David I'm so thankful God
[48:00] has warned
[48:02] me these pure words amen now if that
[48:05] ain't proof these people are wrong then
[48:07] nothing will nothing will convince
[48:11] them and I'll just say this you know a
[48:13] lot of these people that leave the
[48:14] message they were in churches that were
[48:16] not filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[48:19] the
[48:20] trouble right they and those churches
[48:22] give the message a bad name but it's
[48:25] churches like that give it the right
[48:26] name praise God amen hallelujah
[48:32] amen thank God he warns
[48:36] us and if we keep the word of God
[48:39] there's great rewards Hallelujah like
[48:41] the Bible said in this life and in the
[48:43] Life to Come praise
[48:48] God like I told you that one time last
[48:50] summer I made these awful Financial
[48:52] mistakes breaking you know breaking my
[48:54] vehicles and everything I just cry out
[48:56] to God and somebody uh somebody put it
[49:00] on their heart to send me a certain
[49:01] amount of money that paid for all of it
[49:03] and I didn't have this money laying
[49:04] around I just I looked at it as it's a
[49:07] great reward for just obeying
[49:10] God it's a great reward like just taking
[49:13] heed of God's warnings there's so many
[49:16] benefits to serving the lord
[49:19] Hallelujah so after all this
[49:21] magnification of God's word is fine it's
[49:24] pure it's holy it warns me it keeps me
[49:28] then he says Lord who can understand his
[49:30] HS sometimes I can't even understand why
[49:33] I sin the way I do am I the only one
[49:36] that can say Amen to
[49:38] that David said who can understand his
[49:40] HS that happen to me so many times I'll
[49:43] say brother all I say why did I say that
[49:45] what what where did I get that from that
[49:48] wasn't me that was that inside of
[49:51] me why and it's a reminder to repent and
[49:55] then say Lord set a guard before my
[50:00] lips Hallelujah put the Holy Ghost there
[50:03] with the sword of the spirit praise God
[50:06] and don't let evil out only let good
[50:09] come out praise
[50:11] God who can understand I love the I love
[50:14] the word so much I love all these things
[50:16] about God's word it's so it's converted
[50:18] me all these things but I can't
[50:21] understand why I do these
[50:23] things cleanse me thou from secret or
[50:26] hidden
[50:30] faults isn't that something the Bible
[50:32] said we can be mature be therefore
[50:34] perfect now how you don't have to raise
[50:37] your hand but how many here have ever
[50:38] loved somebody that was an
[50:41] enemy that if you did that showed you're
[50:43] a mature
[50:44] Christian but even being a mature
[50:47] Christian you have faults that you can't
[50:51] understand right so I just want to
[50:53] balance that out you can be mature sure
[50:56] but then still have sins and faults that
[50:58] you're ashamed of because that's how
[51:00] David was that's how Paul was if anybody
[51:03] was mature it was the first church age
[51:05] messenger yes because all other Church
[51:08] ages are judged by Paul that's right it
[51:12] reminds me of Moses how God told Moses
[51:14] I'll destroy them and I'll start with
[51:16] you but God told Paul I saved you from
[51:21] the depths of sin but I'm making you the
[51:23] pattern praise God the pattern of
[51:27] Grace and everybody will be judged by
[51:29] your gospel you don't change it
[51:32] either my it's beautiful
[51:36] my cleanse me from Secret faults and
[51:40] remember Jesus said I don't have the
[51:40] scripture in front of me maybe one of
[51:42] you can find it but he said where do all
[51:44] these sins come he said they come from
[51:47] within a man it's not that what goes
[51:49] into the body that defiles the man it's
[51:53] what's already in the man that defiles
[51:55] him remember that scripture so that's
[51:59] what David's
[52:00] saying I love the word it it's converted
[52:03] me I'm a not for us to be I'm a holy
[52:06] ghost filled Saint the word of God has
[52:09] power in my life but lord I can't
[52:12] understand my error
[52:14] sometimes cleanse me wash me from my
[52:17] secret
[52:21] faults verse
[52:23] 13 keep back thy servant also from
[52:27] presumptuous sins whoever look who knows
[52:29] what that word does anybody know I
[52:30] didn't know till today now I might have
[52:32] preach it I might have forgot who knows
[52:34] what presumptuous
[52:36] means proud or
[52:40] arrogant see sometimes we think we just
[52:42] know it all well I'm just going to do
[52:44] this because I'm I'm I'm such a strong
[52:48] person in other words I'm going to do
[52:50] this I don't even have to ask God about
[52:51] it I can just do this because I know all
[52:54] about it it or I'm God's gift to the
[52:58] world I'm the greatest of all time or
[53:01] I'm the greatest believer in akan or I'm
[53:02] the greatest believer in albian or Iowa
[53:05] or Napoleon you
[53:08] know he said keep me from proud or
[53:12] arrogant sins now for us it's judging
[53:16] others many times without having Mercy
[53:18] yes right I've seen that in my life a
[53:21] critical spirit right critical
[53:24] spirit he said cleanse me from my secret
[53:27] things that are in here but keep me also
[53:30] from prideful
[53:32] sins where I think I'm better than
[53:36] anybody as far as like for
[53:38] salvation right because we know there's
[53:40] a wise and foolish virgin and I even had
[53:42] a guy tell me that this week on the on
[53:44] the on the uh comments on
[53:47] YouTube he was condem he was trying to
[53:49] condemn me oh you're you're angry and
[53:51] you make Angry comments I said sir when
[53:53] did you start a YouTube channel and when
[53:55] have you when have you had debates with
[53:57] people for 10 years he said you're right
[53:59] you're more righteous than
[54:01] me that's the same thing Samuel said to
[54:04] Saul Saul said David is more righteous
[54:07] than you
[54:08] Saul right so in some ways we are going
[54:12] to be more righteous than the foolish
[54:14] virgin right we're going to obey more of
[54:17] the word of God but we can't let that go
[54:19] to our head we can't allow that to make
[54:22] us stop seeking God we must stand
[54:25] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[54:28] hallelujah and his
[54:31] righteousness I love what that verse
[54:32] said in 2 Corinthians I think it's
[54:36] 6:14 Paul said renew my mind day by day
[54:41] am that means church we need a brand new
[54:44] mind starting
[54:45] today amen well Jesse when can I get a
[54:48] new mind today is a great day for
[54:50] that Paul said each day he said you must
[54:53] take up the cross day daily and follow
[54:56] me amen that's right Die daily he said
[54:59] be renewed in the spirit of your mind be
[55:03] renewed every day hallelujah
[55:07] amen keep me Lord from arrogant
[55:12] sins let them not have dominion over me
[55:15] in other words don't let me get addicted
[55:16] to these things and the church said
[55:19] yes uh can I say like this Lord help me
[55:22] not to get a complex can I say like that
[55:26] right God keep me from
[55:29] complexes then shall I be
[55:33] upright and remember Church the Bible
[55:35] says that the Bible says that you know
[55:37] when we confess our sins we have
[55:39] confidence with God right amen right
[55:42] that God will hear us amen the times we
[55:45] prayed and God has answered well the
[55:47] only way that could happen is if the
[55:49] people both the the the seeker and the
[55:51] preacher or whoever's praying the
[55:53] sisters whoever's praying they had to
[55:55] have confidence with God they had had to
[55:58] have all the sins confessed walking in
[56:01] humility but walking in the boldness of
[56:03] the Holy Spirit praise God Amen
[56:07] see he says let them not have dominion
[56:10] over me I'll be upright I'll be innocent
[56:12] from the great transgression now
[56:14] remember he was going to commit a great
[56:18] transgression but he says Lord you can
[56:20] keep me from becoming arrogant where I
[56:22] get so arrogant that I commit sins and
[56:26] then I do something really
[56:28] awful now how many want that as your
[56:30] testimony I want that
[56:33] testimony cleanse me from Secret sins
[56:35] that are inside of my my mind I'd say
[56:37] and the S the sinful part of My Flesh
[56:40] and then Lord don't let Pride have
[56:43] dominion over me where I do a great
[56:47] transgression that's what we're going to
[56:48] get I'm going to show that tonight
[56:49] that's what I think's happening with a
[56:50] lot of preachers they get so pride and
[56:52] arrogant over the years that they'll
[56:54] speak speak things and it doesn't
[56:57] happen but what is it are they still
[56:59] saved I believe they are but it's a
[57:02] great
[57:03] transgression just like David and
[57:07] Solomon
[57:09] right these great transgressions and yet
[57:12] that God and yet God will say he's a man
[57:14] after my own
[57:16] heart verse 14 let the words of my mouth
[57:20] and the meditation of my heart be
[57:22] acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my
[57:25] strength and my redeemer I remember this
[57:28] couple I think cam was here the last
[57:30] time I remember cam preaching on this he
[57:32] showed a scripture where David said I
[57:34] will Delight in the word of the Lord all
[57:35] the day long amen I even challenged the
[57:38] Bible club kids I said when was the last
[57:40] time you thought about God all day I
[57:43] said I'm not telling you not to pay
[57:44] attention to your teacher you got to
[57:46] pass those tests but I mean you know pay
[57:49] attention but always know God's going to
[57:51] help me pay attention God's helping me
[57:54] remember these
[57:55] facts so I can pass the test all of our
[57:57] students in the back God's going to help
[58:00] you with your test just pray before the
[58:02] test amen
[58:06] hallelujah and I I challenge you that's
[58:09] a that's a heart after God's Own Heart
[58:11] that's David David's heart was L was
[58:13] saying Lord I want to think about you
[58:15] all day throughout all my ups and downs
[58:18] of the day the good times the bad times
[58:20] I want to Delight in the word of God
[58:23] your word rejoices my heart
[58:26] amen oh
[58:32] hallelujah praise the
[58:34] Lord now I want to share a little bit
[58:36] about this achan thought I may preach a
[58:38] uh a separate sermon on this this might
[58:40] be a part one might have a part
[58:44] two this achan effect is interesting I
[58:47] liken it unto the Solomon effect the
[58:49] Solomon syndrome as you get old got to
[58:52] make sure you don't backslide on God
[58:55] like Solomon did as he got older all
[58:58] these he let all these wives turn his
[58:59] heart away from the
[59:02] Lord but the achan
[59:04] effect is secret sin that causes God to
[59:08] put a judgment on your
[59:10] life now I don't know how much this
[59:12] applies I can see it clearly apply in
[59:15] the in the Corinthian Church let's read
[59:17] that 1 Corinthians
[59:22] 11 I mentioned this times but just now
[59:26] think about this in the light of what
[59:27] brother Dennis preached to
[59:35] us verse 27 1 Corinthians 11:27
[59:38] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[59:40] and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy
[59:41] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[59:43] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[59:45] and so let him eat of that bread and
[59:47] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[59:48] drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh
[59:50] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[59:53] Lord's body
[59:55] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[59:58] among you and many sleep okay so many
[1:00:02] people died in their church because they
[1:00:04] didn't treat each other the right
[1:00:06] way so that's the achan effect right
[1:00:10] there was sin in the church they didn't
[1:00:12] take care of it in other words when
[1:00:13] somebody offended them they didn't go
[1:00:15] talk to them about it they just talked
[1:00:16] to somebody else about
[1:00:17] it if somebody offends you go talk to
[1:00:20] them about
[1:00:21] it right don't talk to somebody else
[1:00:23] about it go to that
[1:00:26] individual right but here we can see the
[1:00:29] a achan effect and then many got weak
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] sickly you know think about all the
[1:00:34] people they'd go to pray for maybe they
[1:00:35] had a stomach sickness or maybe they had
[1:00:37] a
[1:00:38] bronchitis a brother in the Corinthian
[1:00:40] Church you know uh can I pray for you
[1:00:42] and they pray and pray and pray and
[1:00:44] nothing would happen because they have
[1:00:46] unconfessed
[1:00:48] sin oh God he our sister he our brother
[1:00:51] but God won't do it until they confess
[1:00:53] their sins amen they're hiding something
[1:00:56] in their life they ought to confess
[1:01:00] Hallelujah you know many many times
[1:01:02] people can't Rejoice or dance or shout
[1:01:04] or sing because they've got unconfessed
[1:01:06] sin oh but if you've confessed all your
[1:01:08] sins you can have joy in the house of
[1:01:10] the Lord today
[1:01:11] Hallelujah CU you know God doesn't hold
[1:01:14] anything against you it's all been
[1:01:15] forgiven
[1:01:17] hallelujah amen amen that's why all
[1:01:20] these people all these men addicted to
[1:01:21] pornography that's why they can't raise
[1:01:23] their hands in sin that's why they can't
[1:01:25] worship they can't get excited about the
[1:01:27] word of God because they live under
[1:01:29] condemnation oh God cleanse them from
[1:01:31] Secret sin hallelujah amen amen
[1:01:35] hallelujah and put your emotions put
[1:01:37] your desires and passions God just
[1:01:40] emailed me yesterday he said how can I
[1:01:42] get victory over this I said look at
[1:01:44] Jesus if you just fall in love with
[1:01:47] Jesus all these things will pass away
[1:01:49] Hallelujah the filth and the destruction
[1:01:52] and the wickedness will all pass away
[1:01:54] away Turn Your Eyes On Jesus look
[1:01:57] forward his wonderful face
[1:01:59] hallelujah look at Jesus for a
[1:02:02] while go read the book of
[1:02:06] Hebrews he was made like unto a man but
[1:02:09] he was close to an angel look at his
[1:02:12] Beauty look what look look what his
[1:02:14] blood did look at him he's the high
[1:02:16] priest now he can be touched by the
[1:02:19] feeling of your Temptation Hallelujah
[1:02:21] that's right get your eyes on Jesus one
[1:02:24] time
[1:02:26] like I told another brother years ago
[1:02:27] he's like how do I overcome this I said
[1:02:29] go get in the presence of
[1:02:33] God I didn't have to give him a list of
[1:02:35] 50 things to
[1:02:36] do go repent and go get in God's
[1:02:40] presence and we sense the Holiness of
[1:02:42] Jesus and you draw n to God God will
[1:02:45] draw n to you
[1:02:51] Hallelujah so this achin effect
[1:02:56] now what's interesting as I was I think
[1:02:58] I was talking to Cas about this on
[1:02:59] Wednesday night we can see the aen
[1:03:01] effect in the Corinthian Church and also
[1:03:03] the galatian church because Paul said oh
[1:03:05] foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you
[1:03:07] they were under demonic influence to try
[1:03:11] to bring the law back into
[1:03:13] Grace and Paul says I'm glad or no Paul
[1:03:16] says I may have to come there and birth
[1:03:17] you again and make sure you guys really
[1:03:18] got the Holy Ghost see because Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost F people don't do
[1:03:22] legalism the church said amen some might
[1:03:25] have to birth you again making all these
[1:03:27] laws and
[1:03:29] rules that aren't in the Bible now not
[1:03:32] in the Bible what was interesting though
[1:03:35] uh this one I shared with AAA you know
[1:03:37] the achan effect didn't impact uh the
[1:03:40] Saints there in Samaria when the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost fell remember Simon the sorcer got
[1:03:45] baptized and he just he still had this
[1:03:47] bitterness in him though and then Peter
[1:03:49] and James and John or Peter and John uh
[1:03:52] they're laying hands and the Holy Ghost
[1:03:53] is Fallen one after another Holy Ghost
[1:03:55] these people are filled with the Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost and then Simon says let me give
[1:04:00] you money so I can have that gift and
[1:04:02] Peter said God be merciful to
[1:04:04] you so look there's secret sin but yet
[1:04:08] God is still
[1:04:10] blessing so there's this accountability
[1:04:13] aspect when there's secret sin and
[1:04:14] people know about it and the church
[1:04:16] doesn't take care of it that's when the
[1:04:18] blessings
[1:04:20] stop is that right
[1:04:23] amen so I want to think of more examples
[1:04:25] on that because it's quite a
[1:04:27] thought the aen effect didn't stop the
[1:04:30] church when ananas and Safa sinned right
[1:04:32] God dealt with it and God kept the
[1:04:34] church pure moved right on and church
[1:04:36] you know if you've been around long you
[1:04:38] know my prayer has always been God don't
[1:04:40] let sin come into that door you probably
[1:04:42] heard me preach that 20 or 30 times
[1:04:44] right you can quote me you know the
[1:04:47] words that are going to come out of my
[1:04:49] mouth and wh why is that because of this
[1:04:53] the ACH and effect
[1:04:54] I don't want people sick and dying
[1:04:56] around here I want people living to the
[1:04:58] glory of God
[1:05:00] hallelujah hallelujah I want to see
[1:05:02] people get their three score and 10 if
[1:05:05] they're really strong four
[1:05:07] score maybe beyond that by God's grace
[1:05:11] Hallelujah we want to live in Holiness
[1:05:13] we want to live in Purity praise God all
[1:05:15] the days of our
[1:05:18] life and just be sure of this church be
[1:05:22] sure of this if you have Secret sin it
[1:05:24] will find itself out it will hunt you
[1:05:28] down numbers
[1:05:30] 32:22 and again this is just God's grace
[1:05:34] it's just God's
[1:05:35] grace that he'll remind us of our
[1:05:39] sin that's God's
[1:05:42] mercy if you get to the spot where your
[1:05:44] sin won't hunt you down now you've been
[1:05:46] reprobate it doesn't bother you to sin
[1:05:48] anymore now they're
[1:05:50] reprobates Psalm 32:22 and the land be
[1:05:53] subdued before the Lord then after ye
[1:05:55] shall return and be Guiltless before the
[1:05:57] Lord and before Israel and this land
[1:05:58] shall be your possession before the Lord
[1:06:00] but if you will not do so behold you
[1:06:02] have sinned against the Lord and be sure
[1:06:04] your sin will find you out which means
[1:06:07] hunt you
[1:06:09] down
[1:06:11] right evil will pursue you if you don't
[1:06:15] confess your secret sins but if you
[1:06:17] confess your
[1:06:19] sins you're forgiven of all
[1:06:22] unrighteousness amen
[1:06:26] Hallelujah Psalm 140: 11 140 ver1 let
[1:06:31] not an evil speaker be established in
[1:06:33] the earth evil shall hunt the violent
[1:06:36] man to
[1:06:37] overthrown it's the law of reaping and
[1:06:40] sewing now we don't take it too far like
[1:06:42] the prosperity just name it and claim it
[1:06:45] right but there is a law of reaping and
[1:06:47] sewing see that evil shall hunt down the
[1:06:50] violent man many times if you're violent
[1:06:53] someone will be violent against you
[1:06:55] it'll hunt you down Proverbs 13:21 evil
[1:07:00] pursueth
[1:07:02] Sinners right it'll chase them down but
[1:07:04] to the righteous good shall be repaid
[1:07:08] amen see one way or another you're going
[1:07:10] to get repaid let's seow seeds of
[1:07:12] righteousness so we get paid back with
[1:07:20] righteousness Psalm I'm sorry Isaiah 591
[1:07:23] and2 behold the Lord hand the Lord's
[1:07:26] hand is not shortened that it cannot
[1:07:27] save neither his ear heavy that it
[1:07:30] cannot
[1:07:32] hear how many know that God hears your
[1:07:34] prayers amen right he might just be
[1:07:38] silent for a season or he might be
[1:07:39] testing you right or you might have
[1:07:40] caused a silence for a season verse two
[1:07:43] but your iniquities have separated you
[1:07:45] between your and your God this is
[1:07:47] beginning Israel and your sins have hid
[1:07:50] his face from you that he will not
[1:07:52] hear
[1:07:57] verse uh 12 in the same chapter for our
[1:08:00] transgressions are multiplied before
[1:08:02] thee and our sins testify against us for
[1:08:04] our transgressions are with us and as
[1:08:07] for our iniquities we know them thank
[1:08:09] God we know them praise
[1:08:12] God so here so here we have These
[1:08:15] Warnings that if we don't confess our
[1:08:17] secret sins God won't hear our
[1:08:20] prayers
[1:08:21] Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 4 verse 5
[1:08:24] therefore judge nothing before the time
[1:08:27] until the Lord come who will bring both
[1:08:29] to light the hidden things of
[1:08:33] Darkness see people talk about
[1:08:35] conspiracies oh yeah there's

[1:08:58] that's what the face of a liar looks
[1:09:01] like right right God will bring it to
[1:09:04] light like Bill Clinton I promise I
[1:09:07] never did anything evil in Old office
[1:09:10] yet he was the biggest hormonger in the
[1:09:12] Oval Office like

[1:09:52] and God will reward you openly

[1:09:58] Hallelujah remember Hebrews 12 the Lord
[1:10:02] uh chastens Those whom he loves
[1:10:06] amen if God lets your secret sins catch
[1:10:09] up you that's just his love to
[1:10:12] you because he could have let it go on
[1:10:15] and you wouldn't have to face it until
[1:10:16] the Judgment I want to face my sins now
[1:10:19] amen cuz everybody's got secret faults
[1:10:23] if David did you do if if if Paul did
[1:10:26] certainly we
[1:10:28] do Jesus said in Revelation 3 as many as
[1:10:31] I love I rebuke and
[1:10:34] chasen
[1:10:39] Hallelujah let us not forget some of
[1:10:42] these uh major scriptures I'm trying to
[1:10:43] bring it to bring this down to a close
[1:10:45] here um Proverbs 2813 and 14 he that
[1:10:54] but who so confesseth and forsaketh them
[1:10:57] Shall Have
[1:10:58] Mercy amen that that that's what we must
[1:11:01] do we must confess them to God and then
[1:11:04] leave those
[1:11:05] sins and get the victory praise God we
[1:11:09] know he's Satan's going to come back at
[1:11:11] another opportune season but let's get
[1:11:13] Victory and forsake them
[1:11:16] Hallelujah happy is the man that fearth
[1:11:19] always but he that hardeneth his heart
[1:11:21] shall fall into mischief
[1:11:25] Hallelujah the hard Hearts remember I
[1:11:27] said sh shared that on Wednesday or two
[1:11:28] Wednesdays ago now with controlling our
[1:11:31] emotions it's okay to be angry at a
[1:11:33] hard-hearted person as long as it's
[1:11:36] Jesus in you right amen as long as Jesus
[1:11:39] in you there's nothing wrong with
[1:11:44] that Psalm 69:5 I love this a Psalm of
[1:11:48] David a man after God's Own
[1:11:51] Heart Church just be encouraged with
[1:11:53] this
[1:11:54] Psalm 695 oh God thou knowest my
[1:11:59] foolishness Jesus told his own disciples
[1:12:02] they were fools of course they didn't
[1:12:04] have the Holy Ghost but Paul told the
[1:12:06] Galatians you're
[1:12:07] foolish and if David could humble
[1:12:10] himself in his own this is his own
[1:12:12] personal song now imagine he sang this
[1:12:14] oh God thou knowest my
[1:12:19] foolishness so even in his own song he
[1:12:22] could say God I'm a fool sometimes yeah
[1:12:25] right I do presumptuous things I knew
[1:12:29] better I got all proud and arrogant like
[1:12:32] I knew about it and I was the best
[1:12:34] person and I got I did foolish yeah if
[1:12:39] David could admit that we can admit
[1:12:42] that and my sins are not hid from
[1:12:50] thee but that's not the end of the song
[1:12:53] Psalm 69 is entire song so the first
[1:12:56] part of the song is God you know I'm
[1:12:58] foolish
[1:12:59] sometimes but he goes on in verse 13 but
[1:13:02] as for me my prayer is unto thee Oh Lord
[1:13:05] in an acceptable time see now I'm
[1:13:07] accepted sometimes I'm foolish but other
[1:13:09] times God accepts me
[1:13:10] hallelujah oh God in the multitude of
[1:13:13] thy mercy hear me I sound like some some
[1:13:16] Catholic chant or something like that I
[1:13:18] went to too many Catholic churches in
[1:13:21] the truth of in the truth of thy
[1:13:23] salvation hear me oh lord for thy loving
[1:13:25] kindness is good verse 16 turn unto me
[1:13:28] according to the multitude of thy Tender
[1:13:30] Mercies amen I've been foolish but let
[1:13:33] your grace come back to me let me feel
[1:13:36] your presence again hallelujah
[1:13:39] amen I'm foolish sometimes but I want to
[1:13:42] be back in your presence hallelujah amen
[1:13:46] glory a man after God's Own Heart
[1:13:49] brother
[1:13:50] [Laughter]
[1:13:51] amen he's got secet faults he's got he's
[1:13:54] foolish he does things that he hates
[1:13:56] sounds a lot like
[1:13:57] me sounds a lot like
[1:14:01] you he says and hide not thy face from
[1:14:05] thy servant for I'm in trouble hear me
[1:14:07] Speedy now I wonder why he's in trouble
[1:14:09] probably because his own
[1:14:10] sins probably because of his own
[1:14:12] foolishness yeah that's right right
[1:14:17] yeah so bring your face remember the God
[1:14:20] said I'll turn my face away from you if
[1:14:21] you sin but he says
[1:14:23] here turn your face toward me so David
[1:14:25] must have sinned he must have did some
[1:14:28] foolish things he said
[1:14:30] God bring your face towards me again I
[1:14:33] want to see your presence I want to feel
[1:14:36] that I'm accepted by
[1:14:38] you how many want to feel that way when
[1:14:40] you come to church that God has accepted
[1:14:42] your

[1:14:54] sickness it lasted for about 6 hours so

[1:19:30] good years lately how many of us would
[1:19:33] label like a whole year as evil I can't
[1:19:35] think of
[1:19:36] any you know maybe as a sinner there had
[1:19:38] some evil years there but look at what
[1:19:41] God's grace God's grace gives us hope
[1:19:43] for the future amen God God's grace
[1:19:46] shines upon us all 365 days of the year

[1:20:46] the gifts that are in my life amen I
[1:20:49] want Jesus to say Well done you had this
[1:20:51] preaching gift and and you doubled that
[1:20:53] gift amen so for each one Lord if you
[1:20:56] Lord if I've got a gift of faith may I
[1:20:58] double this gift as a pleasing sacrifice
[1:21:01] unto you amen
[1:21:07] hallelujah now I think I'll just close
[1:21:09] here because it's already it's already
[1:21:10] been an hour and a half so it doesn't
[1:21:12] seem like that does it does it to you
[1:21:14] ises it to you I hope not it's gone
[1:21:18] fast um couple more scriptures I want to
[1:21:22] read here by God's
[1:21:26] grace numerous ones here um Micah
[1:21:32] 717 he will turn again and have
[1:21:34] compassion upon
[1:21:36] us he will subdue our iniquities and
[1:21:39] thou will cast all their sins into the
[1:21:42] depths of the sea
[1:21:45] amen so what an encouragement in the Old
[1:21:47] Testament the Saints knew if they if
[1:21:50] they had left God God would return to
[1:21:52] them
[1:21:54] God will return with
[1:21:57] compassion now this is why I forgot to
[1:21:59] share about brother Dennis uh did you
[1:22:00] notice he said fasting has been powerful
[1:22:03] for him in this year of his
[1:22:04] life so in our personal conversation he
[1:22:08] said I've been trying to fast my entire
[1:22:10] Christian life and never had been doing
[1:22:12] it the right way Church he's 48 years
[1:22:17] old now I want to use this as an
[1:22:20] encouragement he never gave up trying to
[1:22:24] fast he sought God until God heard his
[1:22:27] prayer amen amen what a sign of a mature
[1:22:31] Christian now I I I told all you he's
[1:22:34] one of the men I respect the most but I
[1:22:36] didn't tell him that because I don't
[1:22:37] want him to get lifted up because if
[1:22:40] people tell me that I might struggle and
[1:22:41] like be a little prideful but I didn't
[1:22:44] tell them that because I always want to
[1:22:45] just keep that humble relationship but I
[1:22:47] really admire his faith but I thought I
[1:22:49] was so humble he could say I've been
[1:22:50] fasting for almost 30 years
[1:22:53] and this is the year that I finally got
[1:22:56] victory in fasting amen so be
[1:23:00] encouraged right if you want more of God
[1:23:03] or if you want God to return to you God
[1:23:05] will return to you yes
[1:23:08] amen did you hear some of the words he
[1:23:10] said out of his mouth he said I want to
[1:23:13] he said I have a death sentence I've got
[1:23:15] to die for my
[1:23:16] family that means pray and intercede for
[1:23:19] his family church that was precious we
[1:23:22] the precious words of God amen amen
[1:23:27] through fasting through prayer amen
[1:23:33] amen he's 48 and finally so brother
[1:23:36] brother bang there's hope for us brother
[1:23:38] Jose there's hope for
[1:23:39] us I'm 43 There's Hope For Me Hallelujah
[1:23:44] I've had great times of fasting no doubt
[1:23:46] about
[1:23:47] it but here God lets a servant Lord go
[1:23:51] decades and still coming into and he
[1:23:54] said it's like a I'm like a brand new
[1:23:56] Christian I feel like I got a brand new
[1:23:59] walk I got my first love back the church
[1:24:03] said there is God wants to have
[1:24:05] compassion
[1:24:07] am and now he can pray for his children
[1:24:10] like he never could before because he's
[1:24:13] gone through difficult Seasons gone
[1:24:14] through trials he's waited on the Lord
[1:24:17] and God has renewed his strength like
[1:24:18] the
[1:24:19] eagle amen hallelujah I was so
[1:24:21] encouraged about
[1:24:23] this is God Amen God is
[1:24:26] here but God will subdue your iniquities
[1:24:30] amen don't worry about that God will
[1:24:32] subdue them he's greater than your your
[1:24:35] sins amen God is
[1:24:38] greater he will cast all everybody say
[1:24:41] all all their sins in the depths of the
[1:24:47] sea um ACAA can you switch over I want
[1:24:50] to show this video real quick

[1:24:56] know how good the volume will be on here
[1:24:58] I'll try to turn this up all the
[1:25:03] way you ever seen a video on the depths
[1:25:05] of the sea God said I'm going to cast
[1:25:08] all your sins in the depths of the sea
[1:25:12] This Woman's talking about the depths of
[1:25:13] the sea but she ain't talking about it
[1:25:14] about God but let's
[1:25:18] see it's going to be just a second here
[1:25:21] to get this going most people don't
[1:25:23] understand how deep the ocean really is
[1:25:25] imagine you walk off the coast into the
[1:25:27] water at 10 m or 33 ft deep you're
[1:25:30] already experiencing an entire
[1:25:32] additional atmosphere of pressure at he
[1:25:35] so catch that by the time your head's
[1:25:37] covered in the water you're already in a
[1:25:39] different atmosphere and this is what
[1:25:41] God has done to our
[1:25:44] sins see where I'm going with
[1:25:48] this just just just in a few feet six
[1:25:51] feet your are already in a different
[1:25:53] atmosphere
[1:25:54] hallelujah amen hallelujah praise
[1:25:58] God and M where do your sins go not to
[1:26:00] the first layer all the way to the
[1:26:04] bottom 114 m you're passing the verified
[1:26:07] record for a human diver with no
[1:26:09] equipment at 830 you're the depth of the
[1:26:12] tallest building on earth and at 1,000 M
[1:26:14] down no light from the surface is
[1:26:16] getting to you anymore and you're only
[1:26:17] about a tenth of the way down
[1:26:21] 1,00 not even a tenth of the way down no
[1:26:24] sunlight can even get down there in
[1:26:25] other words whatever is buried under
[1:26:27] there the sun ain't going to shine on it
[1:26:29] you ain't going to find
[1:26:32] it that's only a tenth of the way
[1:26:36] down mic is like I have no other way to
[1:26:39] say this Hallelujah I don't even know
[1:26:41] how to describe this but the Holy Spirit
[1:26:43] strike in my heart and it says God
[1:26:45] through all your sins in the sea of
[1:26:47] forgetfulness
[1:26:49] hallelujah oh my Hallelujah this spoke
[1:26:51] to me Hallelujah I thought that's what
[1:26:53] God did with my
[1:26:55] sins 220 M and you're in the territory
[1:26:58] of the deepest military submarines that
[1:27:00] we know about at 3,800 M you hit the
[1:27:02] Titanic Titanic just above it is where
[1:27:04] the infamous ocean Gates immersible
[1:27:06] imploded the deepest recorded natural
[1:27:07] point is
[1:27:09] 10,984 M deep or 6.8 mil this point this
[1:27:14] is Challenger Deep if you put Mount
[1:27:16] Everest into the water upside down there
[1:27:18] would still be over a mile until you got
[1:27:20] to the
[1:27:21] bottom
[1:27:23] all right how many can say Amen to
[1:27:26] that the ocean is seven almost seven
[1:27:29] miles
[1:27:31] deep
[1:27:33] Hallelujah and all these years ago 3,000
[1:27:36] years ago God inspired Micah to
[1:27:38] write God is going to return with
[1:27:41] compassion upon you this is why God can
[1:27:43] be compassionate because he can so get
[1:27:45] rid of your sins he'll never remember
[1:27:48] them ever again hallelujah amen now what
[1:27:51] I found was interesting too now you can

[1:28:26] final stage of the historic five depths

[1:28:46] sea what was God showing God was showing
[1:28:49] it's it's nearly impossible for 6,000
[1:28:52] years it's nearly impossible for anyone
[1:28:54] to ever find the sins that I forgive
[1:28:57] Hallelujah for 6,000 years it was man
[1:29:00] cannot ever get to the bottom now what
