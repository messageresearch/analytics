[29:09] be careful to give you all the honor
[29:11] glory and praise in the name of Jesus
[29:12] Christ Let the Church Say Amen
[29:14] amen amen amen if you have your Bibles
[29:18] let's turn to um Romans chapter four
[29:23] you know before we go there let's go to
[29:25] um Numbers Chapter 13 Numbers Chapter 13
[29:29] and then we're gonna go to Romans
[29:32] um four
[29:34] numbers 13
[29:47] . hey man let's start reading that verse
[29:49] 21 numbers 13 and 21.
[29:52] the Bible says so they went up and
[29:55] searched the land from the Wilderness of
[29:57] Zen unto rehab and as men come to hamath
[30:04] and they ascended by the south and came
[30:07] unto Hebron where
[30:11] a Hyman
[30:13] seesaw and telemath the children of anak
[30:18] were
[30:18] now Hebron was built seven years before
[30:22] zoan in Egypt and they came unto the
[30:26] brook of Esco
[30:27] and cut down from Vince a branch with
[30:31] one cluster of grapes
[30:34] and they and they bear it between two of
[30:38] upon a staff and they brought of the
[30:41] pomegrants
[30:42] and of the figs the place was called The
[30:47] Brook of escal because of the cluster of
[30:50] grapes which the children of Israel cut
[30:53] down from Vince and they return from
[30:57] searching the land after 40 days
[31:01] Romans chapter 4
[31:15] Romans chapter 4
[31:17] um
[31:19] let's go to
[31:20] um
[31:22] verse 16.
[31:25] Romans chapter 4 verse 16.
[31:29] the Bible says therefore it is of faith
[31:31] that it might be by grace to the end of
[31:35] the promise
[31:36] that to the end of the promise might be
[31:39] sure to all the seed not to that only
[31:42] which is of the law but to that also
[31:46] which is of faith of Abraham who is the
[31:49] father of us all as it is written I have
[31:52] made thee a father of Nations before him
[31:55] whom he believed even God who quickeneth
[31:58] the dead and call it those things which
[32:01] be not as though they were who against
[32:05] hope
[32:06] believed in hope that he might become
[32:09] the father of many nations according to
[32:13] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[32:16] be and being not weak in faith he
[32:20] considered not his own body now dead
[32:22] when he was about a hundred years old
[32:26] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's room
[32:29] womb he staggered not at the promise of
[32:34] God through unbelief but was strong in
[32:37] faith giving glory to God and being
[32:40] fully persuaded that what he had
[32:43] promised he was able also to perform
[32:47] amen may the Lord blessed reading of his
[32:49] word you can have your seats
[32:55] amen praise God
[32:59] my subject
[33:01] by the grace of God is faith without
[33:03] reasoning
[33:06] faith without reasoning
[33:09] but my
[33:10] my my
[33:12] subtitle or subject tonight
[33:16] is no reason to doubt
[33:20] faith without reasoning
[33:23] no reason to doubt amen you know we we
[33:27] are creatures of Faith amen God has
[33:30] called us to walk by faith
[33:32] you know this whole this whole journey
[33:34] is an unseen Journey so we're walking in
[33:38] in areas we're walking you know by just
[33:41] believing in God Amen you know you know
[33:45] um I had a question one time I was I was
[33:47] asking to God and I was like Lord I sure
[33:50] would and I know all of us may have done
[33:52] this it's like Lord I sure would like to
[33:54] see my life I would like to know what to
[33:57] do where to go and and everything just
[33:59] have it all together you know we believe
[34:01] our journey is heaven amen but just what
[34:04] about what if you just knew the next
[34:07] step in the step after that and the step
[34:08] after that you know wouldn't that be
[34:10] glorious you know that that would be so
[34:12] sweet amen but you know what God doesn't
[34:16] work like that because if we had it all
[34:19] mapped out and everything put in order
[34:21] you know there'd be no reason to Faith
[34:24] there'd be no reason for Faith so what
[34:27] God does he doesn't give us the plan for
[34:30] our our whole journey our whole life he
[34:33] may show you the next step Hallelujah
[34:35] but he won't show you step out of step
[34:37] out of step out of Step all at once amen
[34:39] what do you do if you give us a little
[34:41] bit and do you cause us to pray
[34:43] Hallelujah did you give us a little bit
[34:45] more and he'll cause us to pray
[34:47] Hallelujah why what is it why is there
[34:49] such a walk of Faith because that's how
[34:52] God Keeps Us close
[34:53] Hallelujah because if you didn't have
[34:56] the element of Faith or or or having to
[34:59] prove God Amen your journey would be all
[35:03] on you all in your hands but because
[35:06] we're believing and we're walking by
[35:08] faith and we're walking according to the
[35:10] Unseen we have to rely on God
[35:13] but you know it's too often that when it
[35:16] comes to Faith that doubt is acquainted
[35:19] by it yes but if I can tonight if I ask
[35:23] each and every one of us who are truly
[35:25] redeemed and truly serving God what
[35:28] reason do you have to doubt God
[35:30] [Applause]
[35:32] if we really think about it has God ever
[35:35] failed us
[35:38] if we would just take the Bible and go
[35:41] in the Bible and pull out Believer by
[35:43] Believer by believer and look according
[35:46] to the scriptures we wouldn't even have
[35:48] a reason to doubt
[35:50] because God has never failed
[35:53] [Applause]
[35:55] he has never failed he has never come up
[35:59] short
[36:00] so church we doubt god without even
[36:02] having a real reason to doubt God
[36:06] so what is our doubt our doubt is based
[36:10] upon reasoning amen
[36:13] amen hallelujah and the prophet of God
[36:14] said in wisdom versus faith that
[36:18] reasoning always tries to find a better
[36:20] way
[36:21] believe me I ask you something if God
[36:23] lays something out and he says okay I
[36:26] need you to do thus thus thus and thus
[36:27] that is the perfect way
[36:30] but because our flesh keeps up against
[36:33] it we try to find it easy around
[36:38] and you know sometimes easier is not
[36:40] always better
[36:42] [Applause]
[36:45] so sometimes we have to fight for the
[36:48] promises sometimes we have to come
[36:50] against trials and tribulations and all
[36:52] these things just so God can show us who
[36:55] we are
[36:56] show us who we believe in God loves to
[37:00] take away our doubts
[37:04] Hallelujah he loves to strip away all of
[37:08] our reasoning
[37:09] [Applause]
[37:12] hey you know church this this message
[37:14] tonight is is real to me amen because
[37:17] you know just living by faith and and
[37:19] and not having real real sources of
[37:22] finances and all these things I have to
[37:25] be able to look back at my testimony and
[37:27] say God you've always provided
[37:29] [Music]
[37:29] [Applause]
[37:31] so why am I doubting this situation when
[37:34] you've always provided you you your name
[37:37] has remained to be Jehovah Jireh so what
[37:40] makes this situation any different
[37:45] he's always been Jehovah Rapha he's
[37:48] always been a Healer so what makes this
[37:50] situation any different
[37:52] [Music]
[37:54] what what are we what are the basis of
[37:57] our doubt
[37:59] reasoning
[38:01] reasoning reasoning is the basis of our
[38:03] doubts
[38:04] but when we when we when we look at
[38:06] reasoning and we think about uh
[38:09] just just you know God in himself and
[38:12] how great he is hallelujah we shouldn't
[38:16] even
[38:16] put reasoning in the same category with
[38:19] God
[38:21] [Applause]
[38:23] oh my God reasoning let's look at the
[38:26] word for a second
[38:28] reasoning Hallelujah
[38:30] is such as a host it's hostile to God
[38:36] reasoning is the thing that fights your
[38:38] faith
[38:39] reason is the thing that Hallelujah
[38:41] challenges your faith so we should never
[38:44] reason when it comes to the word of God
[38:47] Hallelujah it deals with your conscience
[38:50] and conceit and here it is again
[38:51] reasoning deals with what your
[38:54] imagination
[38:56] hey
[38:57] yeah
[38:58] [Applause]
[39:00] you get a pain you get something going
[39:02] in your body and God says you're healed
[39:05] but then that pain causes you to reason
[39:07] because you can feel it
[39:09] that does not change the promise
[39:13] the promise stays the same
[39:15] and see if you could kick out your
[39:16] reasoning your reasoning Hallelujah will
[39:19] if you can kick out your reasoning you
[39:21] have no reason to doubt
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:24] Hallelujah
[39:25] get rid of your reasoning and your doubt
[39:28] will leave right along with it
[39:30] Hallelujah because the Republic of God
[39:33] said there's two elements we can live by
[39:35] it's either Faith or doubt if I can get
[39:38] rid of your doubt tonight we'll see
[39:40] Supernatural things take place in this
[39:42] building
[39:43] Hallelujah he said we can get everybody
[39:46] on the same Accord Hallelujah he said
[39:48] there'll be no one walking out seek in
[39:50] the next five minutes
[39:51] [Applause]
[39:53] that's why he came to a prophet and he
[39:56] told the prophet if you could get the
[39:58] people to believe
[40:00] all things would be possible so what did
[40:04] God do God gave him gifts undeniable
[40:07] gifts that will operate in the presence
[40:10] of the people why distribute with their
[40:12] doubts hey man so there'd be no
[40:15] reasoning there'd be no way if you could
[40:18] even doubt God
[40:19] because of what God is doing amen now if
[40:23] you just take your life your assembly
[40:25] your church and think about all the
[40:26] things that God has done why should we
[40:28] leave out of here doubting
[40:34] and I'll tell you right now while I'm
[40:36] preaching
[40:37] if you think about your situation and
[40:39] you say but but is the first substance
[40:42] of reasoning yeah
[40:43] [Music]
[40:46] as soon as you say but
[40:48] reasoning and doubt begins to kick in
[40:51] because of God you think what God Said
[40:54] let there be there was no but in that
[40:57] whatever he said it came to pass he said
[40:59] let there be the sun let there be the
[41:01] move Let It Be affirmative between the
[41:03] heavens and the Earth all the things
[41:04] that God said there was no but even
[41:06] found whatever he said came to pass just
[41:10] like he said amen
[41:13] that's why it's very important for us
[41:15] hallelujah not to try to interpret the
[41:18] word let's just believe the word
[41:20] [Applause]
[41:22] Hallelujah but the thing I love about uh
[41:26] uh right here in the in the in the book
[41:28] of uh numbers if we go back to Numbers
[41:31] Chapter 13.
[41:32] I ain't gonna be long tonight y'all know
[41:34] I'm about to close
[41:37] Numbers Chapter 13. now we know before
[41:40] the children of Israel got here
[41:42] they they the only the only reason they
[41:46] were here is because they were seeking
[41:48] out a promise
[41:52] they were singing out the promise of a
[41:53] land that was filled with Milk and Honey
[41:56] Hallelujah a land that God promised 400
[41:59] plus years ago
[42:01] other but now they're on the journey
[42:04] they're out of Egypt and they're coming
[42:06] Hallelujah they're walking towards that
[42:08] promise amen but they have people with
[42:10] them that don't believe the same thing
[42:13] you have to be careful who you
[42:15] fellowship with because the Bible says
[42:17] evil Communications corrupt good matters
[42:20] and if that person if you're not able
[42:22] Hallelujah to witness to that person and
[42:25] your beliefs overcome their beliefs
[42:27] you'll begin to believe what they
[42:28] believe
[42:30] and they'll even get you to start
[42:32] doubting her look at your salvation amen
[42:35] like I said uh one of my friends I work
[42:37] out with and and and and and and and I
[42:40] never knew she believed like this until
[42:41] we started talking about the Lord one
[42:43] day so we started talking about the Lord
[42:45] and you know uh uh uh all my friends
[42:48] that call me Reb at the gym so we were
[42:50] talking uh about God and and she she
[42:53] began to express to me that uh I don't
[42:56] believe uh God like you do but I believe
[42:58] in God and I'm thinking the way I
[43:01] believe is the only way
[43:04] Hallelujah
[43:06] so I'm already looking at her like she I
[43:09] ain't gonna say crazy but I'm already
[43:11] looking at her like what's she gonna say
[43:12] because what I believe Hallelujah has
[43:16] been proven amen
[43:17] [Applause]
[43:19] amen
[43:20] what I believe has has produced we gonna
[43:24] get to it what I believe has produced
[43:26] real clusters of greats
[43:29] well I believe I have evidence to walk
[43:32] back and say hey because I believed in
[43:34] this I got proof
[43:37] amen that's why I can stand where I'm
[43:40] standing Hallelujah because I have proof
[43:42] I have evidence Hallelujah of what God
[43:44] is saying
[43:45] you know what she was saying that
[43:47] Christianity is not even the real
[43:49] religion it's just come around or 2 000
[43:52] years ago I said see that's where you're
[43:54] wrong yeah
[43:55] I said see you don't know your Bible
[43:58] you're basting Christianity on AD and BC
[44:02] like before Christ and A.D and all this
[44:04] stuff I say look the one who said let
[44:06] there be was Jesus
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:13] let's do this
[44:17] the one that said let there be light was
[44:20] Jesus Christ
[44:22] see you're basing us upon what
[44:24] historians and all these things we say
[44:26] but let me show you something let me
[44:28] take you up to the book of Acts remember
[44:30] God is identified by a pillar fire or
[44:33] pillar of light now you go over them to
[44:35] acts amen God knocks Paul of his horse
[44:37] and Hallelujah that same pill of fire
[44:39] that led the Chisel of Israel
[44:44] it wasn't a man Hallelujah it wasn't a
[44:47] man of The Voice
[44:49] he's a voice leading to people and they
[44:52] called him what Jehovah what do they
[44:54] call him the Mighty God God Almighty
[44:57] Hallelujah but when Paul said Lord who
[45:00] are there he said I am Jesus
[45:07] so you want to give me a gospel that was
[45:10] only here in 2000 years and I'll give
[45:12] you a gospel that was here from the
[45:14] beginning
[45:18] that's what I put my faith on
[45:22] Hallelujah
[45:25] see people don't know their Bible bad
[45:27] and you know what clearly
[45:29] you know we started talking some more
[45:31] and different things and and she was
[45:33] saying I'm not saying what you believe
[45:35] is wrong I just don't believe it the way
[45:37] you believe it
[45:38] and then she starts to say
[45:40] you know uh well how do you know God
[45:43] wasn't a woman
[45:45] I say because the Bible says his name
[45:46] was Emmanuel
[45:50] hallelujah amen the Bible says and he
[45:54] shall come hallelujah amen
[45:58] and then the Bible says the shoulders
[46:00] shall be the government shall be upon
[46:03] his shoulders
[46:04] Hallelujah so if we we do like that
[46:07] Community every pronoun recognized that
[46:11] God was a man
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:21] see the problem is
[46:22] people want religion without an absolute
[46:28] they want a religion that they can fit
[46:30] into their own lives to believe and make
[46:32] it an issue of cardinality like black
[46:35] and white and race and female and male
[46:37] and all these things no we don't deal
[46:39] with none of that hallelujah we're not
[46:42] worried about what color God is
[46:46] that's that's the silliest argument ever
[46:49] what color God is I'll tell you what
[46:52] color he is if God is in me he's a black
[46:54] man if God is in you he's a white man
[46:56] regardless of you he's anxious
[47:00] that's what color he is
[47:02] [Applause]
[47:09] because I'll show you the mystery the
[47:12] mysterious what Christ in you the hope
[47:14] of glory
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:22] think about it Church in their old
[47:25] theology that old gospel they preach
[47:28] they make God a racist
[47:30] [Music]
[47:32] that's ridiculous
[47:34] God is only this group and only that
[47:37] group and only that how could he be
[47:39] Sovereign and he's still segregating the
[47:41] people
[47:44] their own argument is silly so anyway we
[47:48] me and her kept talking you know and we
[47:51] we didn't really get to a purpose of our
[47:53] conversation it just kind of let me know
[47:55] that there's so many other strange
[47:57] beliefs out there
[47:59] so I so I I say you do believe in God
[48:01] she said yes so I'm trying to give to
[48:04] the place of Jesus Christ so I say well
[48:06] who do you pray to if you don't believe
[48:07] in Jesus Christ she said I pray to
[48:09] myself
[48:14] and I did like y'all did just now huh
[48:19] [Music]
[48:20] I'm sick old Cadre of Heaven
[48:24] please heal yourself
[48:27] it don't even make any sense
[48:30] see that's why the prophet preached that
[48:32] message wisdom versus faith and he also
[48:35] said that he hides it from the wise and
[48:37] prudent Hallelujah these people are so
[48:40] wise they got so much intellect and and
[48:42] they're breaking seeds and all these
[48:43] things and they kept believing the
[48:45] Simplicity of God
[48:47] Hallelujah and if you can't believe in
[48:49] the Simplicity of God always trying to
[48:51] break things down to another layer only
[48:53] thing you're doing is producing doubt
[48:55] amen
[48:58] amen that's all the scientists are doing
[49:00] they're producing doubts Hallelujah I
[49:02] had a conversation with an atheist amen
[49:04] and he begins to tell me that
[49:06] God uh uh That Never Was a God who began
[49:10] to create everything it came from a big
[49:12] bang
[49:14] so I began to ask him where the big bang
[49:17] came from
[49:19] and he says well everything has to be
[49:21] proven because first he began to tell me
[49:23] that I wasn't divinely healed
[49:26] and I was like beg your pardon yeah
[49:29] because now you want to fight
[49:31] now you want to fight when you want to
[49:34] tell me my experience of Faith doesn't
[49:36] exist
[49:37] I don't care what kind of giant is in
[49:39] your land they can never take the
[49:42] experience of faith
[49:43] and you know he began to say well I
[49:46] don't believe I don't believe you were
[49:48] divinely healed show me the paperwork
[49:51] show me where the daughters had X-rays
[49:53] and all these things this and that and I
[49:55] said you know what that's fine I said
[49:56] but check this out I say you see this
[49:58] scar this is not me losing my hair this
[50:01] is where they put a shunt in me I said
[50:02] you see this right here this is where I
[50:04] had 27 Staples in my head I said you
[50:06] know what sir I don't need no paperwork
[50:09] I am the paperwork
[50:14] Hallelujah
[50:16] I am the paperwork you are the paperwork
[50:19] who are the paperwork
[50:23] you all the experience of faith that God
[50:27] is dealt with on this Earth
[50:30] Hallelujah
[50:31] I don't got to go to the hospital
[50:33] Hallelujah why am I going he said bye
[50:36] Stripes I'm Healed
[50:37] [Applause]
[50:38] I don't need no paperwork to prove my
[50:40] God is alive all I got to do is keep
[50:42] living amen amen
[50:47] teachers God is calling in our time for
[50:50] faith without any reasoning and you know
[50:53] even continue talking to that young man
[50:55] he began to say well uh you need
[50:58] evidence you need to prove it and after
[51:00] I told him I said I am the evidence
[51:02] well I said I say well you tell me how
[51:04] do you know that there was a big bang he
[51:06] said well five million years ago signs I
[51:09] said ho ho ho
[51:10] oh
[51:11] don't give me that five million years
[51:13] ago stuff
[51:15] he said I'm trying to tell you how the
[51:16] big bang happened he said five million
[51:19] years ago saying I said stop amen
[51:22] stop telling me about five million years
[51:24] ago in scientists
[51:25] I want you to tell me your experience
[51:27] with the big bang
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:34] how do you know it exists when you can
[51:37] only take the word of a man
[51:40] and the word of a man who was not there
[51:43] [Music]
[51:51] I was glad when he took away all the
[51:53] sins of the world I was in his body
[51:56] thrown across with him
[52:01] I was there Hallelujah
[52:04] he begins to say well science I say no
[52:06] no no you can't give me what scientists
[52:08] say
[52:09] were you there
[52:11] he says no I wasn't there I said well
[52:12] how do you know it's true if you wasn't
[52:15] there you're taking the word of a man
[52:18] Hallelujah I said what I'm telling you
[52:21] I've experienced myself
[52:25] because the things I used to do I don't
[52:27] do anymore the places I used to go I
[52:30] don't know anymore the things I used to
[52:32] believe in don't have authority in my
[52:35] mind anymore why is that Hallelujah
[52:37] because Jesus that stepped in my body
[52:42] and what did he do he Stripped Away all
[52:45] my doubts
[52:51] and furthermore you may be right there
[52:55] was a big bang but that big bank said
[52:58] let there be and it was
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:07] so we went on and on to me him talking
[53:10] just like me and her talking and I came
[53:12] to the conclusion that without a
[53:15] revelation you'll live something that's
[53:17] false and think it's true
[53:19] with no evidence
[53:22] hallelujah what good is a gospel with no
[53:25] evidence
[53:26] Hallelujah let me tell you something if
[53:28] you're in this message and God has never
[53:31] confirmed it to you personally you're
[53:33] just religious
[53:35] [Applause]
[53:38] but the things that happened in the
[53:40] prophet's Ministry happens in your life
[53:42] then you've got some substance
[53:45] see I'm like Paul Hallelujah I wasn't
[53:48] there holy when he preached marriage in
[53:50] the voice I wasn't there when he went to
[53:52] Sunset mouth I wasn't there Sabino
[53:54] Canyon none of these things Hallelujah
[53:56] but just like him I believe in that same
[53:59] God and he's giving me that same
[54:00] Revelation Hallelujah and he told Paul
[54:03] blessed is he who believe in have not
[54:06] seen
[54:10] Hallelujah
[54:12] because when we match up we're going to
[54:14] be believing in the same thing
[54:18] but you be careful who you listen to and
[54:20] what they say and they'll try to
[54:22] disprove you know how they can disprove
[54:24] what you believe in
[54:25] if you don't have an experience amen
[54:29] amen that's the only way they can
[54:31] disprove what you believe that is if
[54:33] you've never had an experience in what
[54:35] you're confessing
[54:36] [Music]
[54:38] but how far
[54:40] can a real experience take you
[54:43] it'll take you to the next battle
[54:47] a real experience will take you to the
[54:49] next battle
[54:50] and then after that battle it'll take
[54:52] you to another experience and do another
[54:54] experience and to another experience
[54:57] hurry see it's a walk of faith
[55:01] Hallelujah David did not defeat
[55:05] Galatians Hallelujah by his own strength
[55:07] he defeated Goliath by his experience
[55:10] with faith
[55:15] a walk with no reason
[55:18] now according to science a man with his
[55:22] bare hands is not able to kill a bear
[55:27] science will tell you that amen amen
[55:29] they're too strong they're too massive
[55:30] scared to think all the stuff bones in
[55:33] the neck too strong all that however
[55:35] David killed it they'll say it's not
[55:37] possible that's what scientists say
[55:39] Google Google say that too
[55:42] and it'll also say that lion being the
[55:45] strongest powerful pound at its size
[55:47] there's no way that a that a a 17 18
[55:51] year old man can kill a full-grown lion
[55:56] I I wish I had time to put it up on the
[55:59] stream but I've been to Africa and I've
[56:01] seen those nine foot lions
[56:04] and just when they're playing in that ah
[56:07] they make you want to look for some
[56:08] safety
[56:10] because of the makeup
[56:12] and you know it's it's it's it's
[56:14] according to man's Wisdom and knowledge
[56:17] a man is not able to kill a lion with
[56:21] his bare hands
[56:22] amen but let me tell you something it
[56:24] happened
[56:28] happened in Hallelujah no way just as
[56:33] the Red Sea opened David killed the lion
[56:35] in The Band
[56:36] just as Noah escaped the tribulation of
[56:39] the heart Holly David killed a lion in
[56:42] the bed
[56:42] just like Hallelujah me confessing that
[56:45] God is my savior
[56:47] it's the same faith that God has given
[56:49] today
[56:53] Hallelujah
[56:54] the faith that it took for him to kill
[56:57] that lion and that bear was the same
[56:59] faith it took to destroy Goliath
[57:04] because when he came to Goliath he came
[57:06] without any reasoning amen
[57:08] Holy Faith without reasoning amen so he
[57:12] looks like he looks he he is Goliath
[57:14] saying bring me a man and y'all heard me
[57:16] say this before he wasn't saying bring
[57:18] me a man I want somebody to fight he was
[57:20] like bring me a man
[57:24] trying to intimidate
[57:26] try to bring for fear and a little bit
[57:28] of doubt
[57:28] [Music]
[57:29] but in the in the heart of battle David
[57:32] was built in such a way where he would
[57:34] have no fear
[57:35] [Music]
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:39] see that's where Goliath Hallelujah made
[57:43] his mistake David was never afraid in
[57:46] battle he was built that way just like
[57:49] some of us some people are afraid of
[57:51] spiders some people are not some people
[57:53] are afraid of snakes some people are not
[57:55] Hallelujah you're built a certain way
[57:59] and David was built without a fear of
[58:03] War
[58:05] but Goliath didn't understand that he
[58:08] didn't understand he was coming against
[58:10] a man who didn't know what it means to
[58:12] reason in battle
[58:13] [Music]
[58:15] David's mindset was I'ma win and if I
[58:18] don't win nobody ain't gonna win
[58:21] [Applause]
[58:24] notice you go back and look at David
[58:27] Harley anytime there was a battle David
[58:30] said if you don't do it my way my God's
[58:32] way you got to die
[58:35] David didn't compromise remember
[58:37] remember he he was going down to
[58:39] neighbor and different things he told
[58:41] the neighbors hey give me and my men
[58:43] some food and they were like I don't
[58:44] know who you are I ain't giving you
[58:45] nothing and David said I'm gonna kill
[58:47] you your cousins your brothers your
[58:51] in-laws your mama your daddy oh your
[58:54] animal I'mma kill everything
[58:56] you don't deny Hallelujah my God you
[59:00] don't deny the people of God Amen David
[59:03] me business when it came to Hallelujah
[59:05] what is God asked him to do enable not
[59:08] knowing what was going on Abigail was
[59:11] there Hallelujah and she was a woman
[59:13] Hallelujah without any reasoning she
[59:15] knew that David was come to destroy
[59:17] everything so she had to operate in
[59:20] faith and she began to get her hands
[59:22] made get the food you gotta get
[59:24] everything and she came to meet David
[59:26] Hallelujah and what does she do she
[59:28] presented a meal offering today
[59:33] and it was that meal from Abigail that
[59:36] saved everybody's life
[59:42] a woman
[59:45] who didn't operate in doubt
[59:48] but she knew who David was Hallelujah
[59:50] and she came and she spared the whole
[59:52] country Holly she spared neighbor's
[59:55] whole house hallelujah amen so you need
[59:58] so Church what you need is you need a
[1:00:01] journey where you're walking by faith
[1:00:03] and no reasoning and no doubt
[1:00:05] and now you look church I I'ma finish up
[1:00:08] with this you look how David he comes
[1:00:10] out took a lion
[1:00:12] and he says who is this
[1:00:14] uncircumcised feelings
[1:00:16] see no doubt
[1:00:19] operating in faith who is this now
[1:00:22] remember I believe the Bible said he was
[1:00:23] nine foot
[1:00:26] he was a big boy
[1:00:28] he was totally in Shaquille O'Neal
[1:00:31] he was told in LeBron James
[1:00:34] he was a real giant Hood and you know
[1:00:37] Hallelujah David looked at him and David
[1:00:39] was like hallelujah look at David's
[1:00:42] mannerism he didn't have any fear of
[1:00:43] Doubt David looked at that giant and
[1:00:45] David said hey hey hey hey my guy
[1:00:49] what's the reward if I kill it
[1:00:55] tell me what y'all gonna give me when I
[1:00:57] kill it
[1:00:59] what's the reward
[1:01:00] and you look and you read it David
[1:01:03] didn't stop asking questions until he
[1:01:05] got in front of Goliath
[1:01:10] should him to get in front of a Goliath
[1:01:11] face
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:15] to your faith will put you in position
[1:01:18] for victory
[1:01:22] it may look like a stone battle but if
[1:01:25] you operate in faith God is putting you
[1:01:27] in position for victory
[1:01:29] when everybody else was afraid when
[1:01:31] everybody else was afraid to stand in
[1:01:33] front of your life God called David
[1:01:35] Hallelujah to come out there and stand
[1:01:37] in the place of Victory
[1:01:39] when everybody else was doubting and
[1:01:42] everybody else had fear when everybody
[1:01:44] else even saw Hallelujah who was almost
[1:01:47] the same size as Goliath
[1:01:51] the Bible says he was Head and Shoulders
[1:01:53] above everyone
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:56] but what do you have doubt
[1:02:00] Hey listen to stay away from them church
[1:02:02] people who telling you you can't operate
[1:02:04] in the word of God
[1:02:06] and when the prophet preached was back
[1:02:09] for the 60s notice for right now
[1:02:14] church that's the spirit of Saul
[1:02:17] Hallelujah somebody who's had an
[1:02:19] experience with God but doesn't believe
[1:02:21] it
[1:02:23] he's had experience with God and now he
[1:02:25] comes to David and he's trying to get
[1:02:27] David to operate in something that David
[1:02:29] doesn't even have in him which is fear
[1:02:33] which is reasonable which is doubt and
[1:02:36] they and Saul says to David now David
[1:02:39] you're only a youth
[1:02:41] he says and he's been fighting and
[1:02:44] conquering and doing all these things
[1:02:45] when he was a youth since he's been a
[1:02:49] youth he's been destroying Nations and
[1:02:51] countries and all why are you going to
[1:02:52] pump up the enemy like that
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:59] let me give you a word of wisdom
[1:03:02] when challenges
[1:03:04] come upon your life
[1:03:06] don't be so quick to say this is the
[1:03:08] devil
[1:03:11] because just that confession alone what
[1:03:13] are you doing you're giving the devil
[1:03:15] control of that situation
[1:03:19] when I go through things I don't never
[1:03:21] say this is the devil or the devil did
[1:03:23] this or the devil did that no oh
[1:03:25] my my word tells me that the footsteps
[1:03:29] of the righteous are ordered by God
[1:03:33] Hallelujah so even when it looked like
[1:03:36] it's a battle I may not be able to
[1:03:38] overcome or something goes a little bit
[1:03:40] wrong in my mind I'm still not going to
[1:03:42] say man the devil did this no thank you
[1:03:44] Lord
[1:03:47] God I don't know what you're doing
[1:03:48] Hallelujah but open my eyes that I may
[1:03:51] see you
[1:03:52] earlier because when you say the devil
[1:03:55] did the devil did that you're giving the
[1:03:57] double control
[1:03:59] and I refuse to give him control
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] because if he has control over your life
[1:04:05] he can dictate to the next step
[1:04:08] and I refuse to give him that kind of
[1:04:10] power
[1:04:12] so even when things don't work out the
[1:04:14] way I think it ought to I say God I
[1:04:16] thank you
[1:04:18] that's why job could look at everything
[1:04:20] Hallelujah and still have no doubt that
[1:04:23] God was in control
[1:04:24] [Applause]
[1:04:27] Church he's losing everything he's
[1:04:30] getting sick he's lost all his status
[1:04:32] all his social status they sat down his
[1:04:34] Facebook account
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:38] and Joseph the Lord God give it and the
[1:04:42] Lord God taketh away
[1:04:44] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:04:51] he's coming to church
[1:04:53] Covenant Church got boiled all over me
[1:04:55] sick all this every day Joe his wife
[1:04:58] comes to say Joe how long are you going
[1:05:00] to continue to believe
[1:05:02] and Joe says to her honey do you expect
[1:05:06] to receive good at the hands of the Lord
[1:05:09] and no evil
[1:05:12] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:05:16] what do you do in your moment of trial
[1:05:23] Hallelujah
[1:05:25] God wants us to believe without any
[1:05:27] reason amen you know that's why the
[1:05:30] story of the super tip and the Caribou
[1:05:33] is is so powerful
[1:05:35] amen because nothing was there
[1:05:37] and and the man that's walking with the
[1:05:40] prophet after he after he didn't already

[1:08:29] coming up against a man without any fear
[1:08:32] he was coming up against a man who
[1:08:34] believed in his God
[1:08:36] but what makes David like us

[1:09:21] says Hey Saul this uncircumcised
[1:09:25] Philistine is going to be just like that
[1:09:27] lying in that bed
[1:09:34] and it's all
[1:09:37] be careful who you're talking to
[1:09:39] because they'll try to place they doubt
[1:09:40] on you and then Saul says okay well let

[1:09:46] let me put you in all my armor let me
[1:09:48] put you in the things that I would wear
[1:09:50] if I would go out there and David put it
[1:09:52] all on and David said no this don't just
[1:09:54] don't fit me right
[1:09:56] just don't quite fit my fate right this
[1:09:58] right here got a little fear in it this
[1:10:01] way here this way he got a little reason
[1:10:02] in it Church like I used to say doing a
[1:10:05] pandemic I used to go to People's Church
[1:10:07] and everybody be sitting in there with a
[1:10:08] mask on and I say you think that mass is
[1:10:11] protecting you
[1:10:16] the only thing protecting us is the
[1:10:18] grace of God
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:28] and you know you had people who were
[1:10:30] real radical with this I really need
[1:10:32] this covert is real and all these things
[1:10:35] and this and that and then you know
[1:10:36] where they tell me that I I go I go to
[1:10:38] extra mile
[1:10:39] as a city with a big old man song
[1:10:42] looking like Darth Vader
[1:10:44] I said but that ain't gonna stop you
[1:10:45] from getting sick if you're meant to get
[1:10:48] sick
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:53] hallelujah hallelujah the only thing
[1:10:56] that's going to stop it is the blood of
[1:10:58] Jesus
[1:10:59] Hallelujah
[1:11:01] amen
[1:11:02] and you look at it right now what's
[1:11:04] happening the world is going on we we
[1:11:07] will say we got covert behind us why why
[1:11:10] is it behind us because the fear is gone
[1:11:12] amen
[1:11:16] fear is gone
[1:11:18] but if you bring you let an outbreaker
[1:11:20] some people start getting sick again
[1:11:22] that fear come right back around
[1:11:24] what is it it produces doubt or walk
[1:11:26] with reasoning
[1:11:28] but David didn't have a walk with
[1:11:29] reasoning
[1:11:31] now he gets out there in front of
[1:11:32] Goliath and Goliath say y'all seen a
[1:11:34] mirror boy out here do y'all know who I
[1:11:36] am I'm gonna put him on my spirit I'm
[1:11:39] gonna feed him to the birds and David
[1:11:40] said you come to me with a spear and
[1:11:42] brass and all these things and I come to
[1:11:44] you in the name of the Lord God of
[1:11:46] Israel and this day I'm gonna cut your
[1:11:48] head off
[1:11:49] real Faith earlier a real experience
[1:11:53] Hallelujah just like I'll read about
[1:11:55] Abraham he staggered not
[1:11:57] he didn't stagger at the promise but he
[1:12:00] spoke those things Hallelujah that were
[1:12:03] not as though they were
[1:12:05] David is speaking of cutting Goliath
[1:12:07] head off Hallelujah without even
[1:12:10] possessing a sword
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:17] what was that that was the faith of
[1:12:19] Abraham
[1:12:22] she real faith will produce what you
[1:12:25] need in that moment
[1:12:29] because Abraham Hallelujah church we
[1:12:31] always have to take it back to the
[1:12:32] scripture because Abraham holding him
[1:12:35] and Isaac on the mountain they have the
[1:12:37] altar they have the wood and he says
[1:12:39] where where where where is the sacrifice
[1:12:41] though and Abraham says the Lord God
[1:12:43] shall provide himself a sacrifice and
[1:12:45] the next thing you know a ram is over
[1:12:47] there going
[1:12:54] who didn't realize what was it it was a
[1:12:57] gold Hallelujah so what does it say that
[1:12:59] Jesus Christ is the greatest of all time
[1:13:02] [Applause]
[1:13:08] Jehovah is my goal
[1:13:11] [Applause]
[1:13:12] Hallelujah not LeBron not Jordan not
[1:13:16] Kobe Jesus is the greatest of all time
[1:13:21] because he can appear right when you
[1:13:23] need him
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:29] a friend of mine
[1:13:30] everybody all right
[1:13:32] a friend of mine in Arizona was hunting
[1:13:34] he was hunting deer
[1:13:36] Hallelujah see faith without reasoning
[1:13:39] he was hunting deer and he had to scope
[1:13:42] on a bunch of those and he said it was a
[1:13:44] tree right there he says he says man
[1:13:48] he's looking through the scope he says
[1:13:50] all those books he says all those does
[1:13:52] but no buck he says I want a buck I
[1:13:56] don't want no door so he's looking he's
[1:13:58] looking at all the all the uh uh those
[1:14:01] are walking around the tree and all
[1:14:03] these things and going from this side to
[1:14:05] that side you know and he sees this tree
[1:14:07] and he sees all these those about form
[1:14:10] walking around
[1:14:11] he says you know what I want a book
[1:14:14] he said I ain't gonna leave here till I
[1:14:15] get a book
[1:14:16] so he puts his he puts his gun in scope
[1:14:18] out there he stands up you know as soon
[1:14:21] as you stand up they start running yeah
[1:14:23] he said he stands up and he says Hey
[1:14:26] buck
[1:14:28] he says and as soon as he say that a
[1:14:30] book comes from behind the tree
[1:14:33] Church there was no bug there
[1:14:36] but his desire to speak to what he
[1:14:39] wanted created
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:45] Church it had aunt Leslie was big it was
[1:14:48] everything now you tell me there had to
[1:14:50] be a mighty big tree to hide a book
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:56] but I'm telling this testimony to tell
[1:14:58] you you can speak what you have need of
[1:15:01] and it will come to life Hallelujah just
[1:15:05] like it did for him
[1:15:07] he said hey buck
[1:15:10] he said as soon as he said it the book
[1:15:12] came from behind the tree Hallelujah he
[1:15:14] caught the gun put it on the book pow it
[1:15:17] wasn't a vision it was real
[1:15:22] Hallelujah
[1:15:24] and I almost got some of that meat but I
[1:15:26] had to leave quick
[1:15:29] Church what I'm saying is
[1:15:31] there's a real faith
[1:15:34] with no reasoning
[1:15:35] and that's what God calls us to be
[1:15:38] that's why I came here to the children
[1:15:39] of Israel God told them a land flowing
[1:15:42] milk and honey now we know the story I
[1:15:44] challenge you to go back and read number
[1:15:45] 13. the place where we read
[1:15:48] it it's dealing with where they they go
[1:15:52] into the land
[1:15:53] they see the vine of grapes they cut it
[1:15:55] down they eat the grapes
[1:15:58] but notice they also said that the sons
[1:16:01] of anak were there
[1:16:03] so Church they get the grave they
[1:16:06] experience Hallelujah the promise in the
[1:16:09] Land of the Giants amen why were the
[1:16:11] grape so big because Giants was eating
[1:16:13] them
[1:16:16] see God don't give you some ordinary
[1:16:19] we not just some ordinary blessed people
[1:16:21] hallelujah amen we have the blessings of
[1:16:24] giants
[1:16:27] in church look they give the grapes
[1:16:29] Hallelujah and the evidence of the
[1:16:33] promise of the land flowing milk and
[1:16:34] honey and then the Bible says after 40
[1:16:38] days of being in that land they go back
[1:16:42] they missed the terminology of God
[1:16:44] hallelujah see they were already there
[1:16:46] for 40 days that mean they survived the
[1:16:49] temptation
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:52] that means they've survived the
[1:16:54] persecution 40 means Temptation or
[1:16:57] persecution Hallelujah and they were
[1:16:59] already in the land for 40 days with the
[1:17:01] Giants
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:06] but then reasoning comes in
[1:17:09] from those same unbelievers who were
[1:17:11] there experiencing it
[1:17:13] and they come back and says oh yeah here
[1:17:16] Moses here's the evidence here's here
[1:17:18] Joshua here's the evidence the land is
[1:17:20] truly flowing like God said but there
[1:17:23] are giants in the land
[1:17:25] you know what Joshua and Caleb says they
[1:17:27] so what Hallelujah we don't care let's
[1:17:30] go take the land at once Hallelujah
[1:17:33] Church what they should have said was we
[1:17:35] was already there for 40 days and nobody
[1:17:37] bothered us
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:44] Church we're already in the Promised
[1:17:46] Land
[1:17:47] the only Power the devil got is what you
[1:17:49] give him
[1:17:53] you make him strong
[1:17:57] they were already in the Land of the
[1:17:59] Giants
[1:18:00] they already walked out with the Giant's
[1:18:02] food
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:05] so where did that doubt come from
[1:18:08] it came from those who really didn't
[1:18:10] believe in the first place
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:15] because you think about it God give you
[1:18:16] the prophet of God said he said God gave
[1:18:18] them the evidence of the Lamb being true
[1:18:20] let's read it
[1:18:23] let's read it he said so this is in the
[1:18:26] message confirmation and evidence
[1:18:28] he said so I'm about to close don't get
[1:18:30] nervous
[1:18:32] he said so they come up out of Egypt and
[1:18:34] they came to a place called Cadence
[1:18:36] Barney
[1:18:37] and I believe it was alone
[1:18:39] there that Joshua a great warrior among
[1:18:42] them went over to spot the land he
[1:18:45] crossed joy we know Jordan means death
[1:18:46] Hallelujah he crossed he calls he
[1:18:49] crossed Jordan and went over to the
[1:18:52] other land and came back with the
[1:18:54] evidence that the land was good she's
[1:18:56] coming back with the evidence that the
[1:18:58] land of good if you've got evidence
[1:19:00] there should be no doubt
[1:19:03] if you've got evidence there should be
[1:19:06] no reasoning
[1:19:09] I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you
[1:19:11] what real faith is
[1:19:12] that doubt and doubt will never be able
[1:19:14] to touch
[1:19:16] commission stand up
[1:19:19] turn around turn around
[1:19:21] is that your dad
[1:19:23] I know I don't know about that
[1:19:26] I don't know about that
[1:19:29] can you prove it
[1:19:31] ah
[1:19:33] I don't think that's your dad
[1:19:35] that's your dad it's it's it's it's it's
[1:19:37] it's something that you live by it's
[1:19:40] something that's a part of you nobody no
[1:19:43] matter what you go through nobody can
[1:19:44] tell you any different there's no doubt
[1:19:47] there's no reasoning let's let's just
[1:19:50] say he go out of town for a week is he
[1:19:52] still your dad yeah let's just say if
[1:19:54] you get a little sick in his body is he
[1:19:56] still your dad let's just say he becomes
[1:19:58] a millionaire
[1:20:01] Hallelujah is he still your dad and if
[1:20:04] he because of me there he's not only
[1:20:06] your dad but he's your dad Hallelujah
[1:20:09] and your dad and your dad Omar and your
[1:20:12] husband
[1:20:14] amen but none of that Hallelujah all
[1:20:18] those things that may be added to him
[1:20:19] could never change what you started with
[1:20:22] the basis of what you believe
[1:20:24] before either that ever came in his life
[1:20:26] he was always what
[1:20:31] [Applause]
[1:20:35] Church
[1:20:36] no matter where we go no matter what
[1:20:39] happens
[1:20:40] whatever trial we go through none of
[1:20:43] that will be able to change who Christ
[1:20:44] is to us
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:49] so whether there's Giants in the land
[1:20:51] that still didn't change the promise
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:56] let me finish he crossed Jordan went
[1:20:58] over to the other land and came back
[1:20:59] with the evidence of the land was that
[1:21:01] the land was good that's God's word was
[1:21:05] made perfect he promised his promise was
[1:21:08] true and he had the evidence the
[1:21:11] confirmation that the land was there
[1:21:13] Those Grapes was a confirmation
[1:21:16] you know what church I'm gonna go on and
[1:21:19] put it out there on the limb y'all know
[1:21:20] what I am a confirmation

[1:21:36] those who are far off
[1:21:39] you uh come for me you are a
[1:21:41] confirmation of the promise
[1:21:42] [Applause]
[1:21:45] from the evidence
[1:21:48] what is that God is a redeemer
[1:21:52] I'm the evidence that God is a savior
[1:21:57] I'm the evidence that God Is A Healer
[1:22:01] I'm the evidence that God is going to
[1:22:03] live around
[1:22:05] [Applause]
[1:22:09] without the evidence that God is
[1:22:12] faithful
[1:22:15] I don't care how many Giants out there
[1:22:17] in the world
[1:22:18] God has already shown himself to be true
[1:22:22] amen Church let's continue to walk by
[1:22:24] faith
[1:22:25] without reasoning
[1:22:27] and the evidence is that we have in our
[1:22:29] life is the proof that God exists
[1:22:32] let's just keep walking and believing
[1:22:34] amen yeah it gets tough sometimes but
[1:22:36] that's what made God so good

[1:24:20] the Bible say in that day every knee
[1:24:22] shall buy every tongue shall confess
[1:24:24] that he is Lord
[1:24:27] and I say this all the time but think
[1:24:29] about it Church Hallelujah when we get
[1:24:31] to heaven and start to testify on what
[1:24:33] we came through
[1:24:35] amen the prophet of God he said why
[1:24:36] didn't Miriam dance he said because she
[1:24:38] looked back
[1:24:40] and she saw all her problems being
[1:24:42] drowned in the seat
[1:24:45] she's on all her trials oh tribulation
[1:24:48] all her enemies Hallelujah and she
[1:24:51] started to dance
[1:24:53] she started to praise the Lord she's
[1:24:55] starting to worship and Hallelujah
[1:25:02] hey and you know what I believe I
[1:25:05] believe when I get there I will be doing
[1:25:06] some dances that it turns people won't
[1:25:08] let me do down here
[1:25:11] hey
[1:25:15] Hallelujah he's the king of kings and
[1:25:18] Lord of lords
[1:25:21] but think about it let's just think
[1:25:23] about it
[1:25:24] what kind of spirit is that that's
[1:25:26] trying to stop the rejoicing in church
[1:25:32] think about it
[1:25:33] right why would you want to stop the
[1:25:35] rejoicing in the sanctuary
[1:25:38] well we're supposed to be worshiping the
[1:25:40] object of worship
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:45] some some just ain't right about that to
[1:25:47] me
[1:25:47] why would you want to uh the Bible says
[1:25:50] clap your hands
[1:25:52] why would you not want me to cut my
[1:25:54] hands
[1:25:55] the Bible says play all the instruments
[1:25:57] sing the song Hallelujah why would you
[1:26:00] not want me to do that unless there's
[1:26:02] the wrong Spirit there yes
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:04] [Applause]
[1:26:07] Hallelujah think about it
[1:26:10] God loved to be worshiped so much he
[1:26:13] created angels He said it's the only
[1:26:15] thing I want you to do
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:17] I don't want you to pray
[1:26:19] I don't want you to preach All I Want
[1:26:21] You To Do Is Sing
[1:26:23] all I want you to do is worship if God
[1:26:26] didn't love it why would he create
[1:26:28] beings just to worship Him
[1:26:32] honey and then we come along Hallelujah
[1:26:35] not only are we worshiping but we're
[1:26:37] worshiping by revelation
[1:26:40] we're worshiping on the basis of
[1:26:42] redemption
[1:26:44] we're worshiping based upon what we came
[1:26:46] through hallelujah what God has did for
[1:26:49] us
[1:26:50] this is not worship of angels this is
[1:26:53] worship of redemption
[1:26:56] Hallelujah
[1:27:01] Jersey I I I I can see the different
[1:27:03] ones written songs and going on to be
[1:27:05] with the Lord you think about a church
[1:27:07] but we get to heaven uh let's just say
[1:27:09] we hook up with sister Brenda Lewis
[1:27:12] woke up with her and say sister brother
[1:27:14] remember you wrote that song is going to
[1:27:15] take a stronger win harder than this to
[1:27:18] keep me from my promises and she says
[1:27:20] brother Diggs you know when the lord
[1:27:22] gave me that song true story when the
[1:27:24] lord gave me that song There was a
[1:27:26] hurricane out on the water the winds
[1:27:28] were 150 miles per hour blowing my house
[1:27:30] beating the trees and then inspiration
[1:27:32] started to fall hallelujah what was God
[1:27:36] doing God was getting rid of her doubt
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:45] you get rid of your doubt probably the
[1:27:49] wind's starting to blow in Hallelujah
[1:27:51] and God made a song out of that
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:59] something that looked like it should
[1:28:01] have destroyed became a blessing
[1:28:05] with a blowing
[1:28:08] with an unrelenting Force it's gonna
[1:28:11] take a stronger wind than this to keep
[1:28:13] me from my promises
[1:28:19] Homa
[1:28:21] because we're the children of God and we
[1:28:23] have the promise that God has given us
[1:28:26] let's not doubt
[1:28:29] because I want what I want you to do I
[1:28:30] want you to look at your situation and
[1:28:32] you say ask yourself
[1:28:34] do I really have a reason
[1:28:36] to expect failure
[1:28:41] and if you tell me yes I'll tell you me
[1:28:44] and you are not serving the same God
[1:28:50] cause he's never failed me yet
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:57] and let's not even say yet
[1:28:59] he's never failed me
[1:29:02] now that means that means it might be
[1:29:05] he'll never fail me
[1:29:07] he's never failed me he can't fail me
[1:29:12] come on musicians
[1:29:14] he's always on time
[1:29:17] he's worthy of your faith
[1:29:20] he's worthy of you believing in him
[1:29:23] never let anybody tell you anything
[1:29:25] different when it comes to the word of
[1:29:26] God all the answers to everything you
[1:29:29] need is in the word
[1:29:31] Hallelujah it's not in the world is in
[1:29:33] the word find your place in the
[1:29:35] scriptures and God will continue to
[1:29:37] reveal himself amen let's have a walk
[1:29:40] without reasoning
[1:29:41] let's have a walk without doubt and what
[1:29:45] does that become it becomes perfect
[1:29:46] faith
[1:29:48] that's what we want
[1:29:50] we want to live through perfect Faith

[1:29:54] David used Goliath's own weapon against
[1:29:57] him
[1:29:59] the thing he brought to the fight was
[1:30:01] the very thing that caused his head to
[1:30:03] get cut off
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:05] right and then I did not like the Act of
[1:30:07] Faith David takes Goliath's head and put
[1:30:09] it in a bag
[1:30:11] he says I want the evidence
[1:30:14] this is just just this is just how I see
[1:30:17] it David has the head of Goliath going
[1:30:19] to the next battle
[1:30:21] he gets to the battle he says hey now he
[1:30:24] uses Goliath's own sarcasm there's no
[1:30:26] need for innocent blood to be shared
[1:30:29] he says there's no need for us to fight
[1:30:31] he says but if y'all want to fight I
[1:30:34] want to show y'all something
[1:30:36] and he pulls the head of Goliath out
[1:30:39] he says just what I'll do to you like I
[1:30:42] did to your Champion if y'all want to
[1:30:44] fight amen amen now we ain't got to
[1:30:46] fight but if you want to fight this is
[1:30:48] going to be the results
