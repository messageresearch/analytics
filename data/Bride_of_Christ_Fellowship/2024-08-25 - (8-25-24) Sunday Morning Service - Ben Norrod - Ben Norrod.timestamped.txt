[0:00] preaching of the word of the Lord God
[0:01] helping
[0:02] us amen we're so glad for the realities
[0:08] of godone the wonderful things that he
[0:10] does and who he is and uh if you got
[0:13] your Bible this morning there's so many
[0:16] different things that I would love to
[0:18] bring this morning I'm telling you I I
[0:20] I've got I've got it loaded up and I'm
[0:22] not joking when I say I could literally
[0:24] probably preach three or four hours this
[0:26] morning and not even get halfway through
[0:28] all that I've got in these pages right
[0:30] here and so I uh now I'm not announcing
[0:34] to you that I'm going to preach three or
[0:35] four hours don't get nervous on me but I
[0:38] I I'm telling you so many good things
[0:40] that I would love to be able to share we
[0:42] got these two services to do it and uh
[0:45] if you'll be patient relaxed and just
[0:47] open your heart and let the Lord amen
[0:49] just bless you and encourage you on what
[0:51] we're going to speak on I think it'll be
[0:53] a great blessing to you now I want to
[0:55] start in Hebrews chapter one and uh
[0:59] there's so many different things that uh
[1:02] Paul says in this book of Hebrews and of
[1:05] course there is a uh as you may know you
[1:08] may not know this but I I'll I'll share
[1:10] this part with you that uh many are not
[1:14] exactly certain and there's a debate as
[1:16] to who the writer of Hebrews was but
[1:19] because we know brother Brenham was a
[1:20] prophet and he opinioned that he believe
[1:24] Paul was the writer of this book and I I
[1:26] I'm sorry to say this I know this is
[1:28] probably going to wind me up on
[1:29] somebody's we website or somebody's
[1:31] Facebook or something but I'll take
[1:33] brother bram's opinion any day of the
[1:35] week over many of these guys I hear that
[1:36] say different and him being a prophet
[1:39] his understanding was enlarged he saw
[1:41] things in a bigger view than what we see
[1:43] it and I certainly believe it when
[1:45] brother Bram read Hebrews you know he
[1:47] was someone that probably saw the
[1:49] parallels and the things in it and knew
[1:52] in some way that Paul was the writer of
[1:54] this book now we're going to start at
[1:57] chapter one and I'm just going to pull
[2:00] open a couple places here in my Bible
[2:01] I've got it electronically but I've also
[2:03] got it here on these little old onion
[2:05] skin pages and I like the Bible for more
[2:09] reasons than just be in the Bible but
[2:11] that cover is an animal skin cover
[2:14] something had to die in order for you to
[2:16] have this book in your hand this morning
[2:17] and I like that something died for us
[2:20] amen Jesus was the one that gave his
[2:22] life amen God gave His only begotten son
[2:26] that whosoever that's me I'm part of
[2:28] that group of Amen people that amen God
[2:31] could call and uh I want to be as
[2:34] sensitive to this as I can with what I'm
[2:36] getting ready to say but I believe by
[2:38] faith that he died for me am I want to
[2:42] be that as sensitive as I can saying
[2:44] that I know you have an opinion yourself
[2:46] but and a faith yourself but I believe
[2:48] he died for me amen and I can't even
[2:51] speak for my own wife standing here I
[2:53] believe he died for me my sins were
[2:55] buried Amen in the sea of God's
[2:57] forgetfulness I don't mind telling you
[2:59] you I am so glad that I know that to be
[3:03] the truth hallelujah brother I'm telling
[3:05] you if it wasn't for that something of
[3:07] his blood breaking over our lives we
[3:10] would be of a people most miserable and
[3:12] greater than that he rose again and we
[3:15] live in resurrection power Resurrection
[3:17] Life and I love that amen so we're going
[3:20] to begin at verse one now if I was to
[3:22] call a title I want to speak to you the
[3:24] Lord helping us upon living in the true
[3:28] Tabernacle living in the true Tabernacle
[3:30] and we're going to talk just a little
[3:32] while about some of these chapters and
[3:35] and now when we get done with the text
[3:36] reading now just hold your book right
[3:38] there to Hebrews 1 because the Lord
[3:40] willing what I want to try to do if God
[3:42] will help me is I want to go through
[3:43] some of these chapters and I want to
[3:45] show you some things there's a a great
[3:48] debate upon being prophets in the last
[3:51] day prophets in this time well that
[3:53] ain't going to work it ain't holding it
[3:54] ain't got enough Pentecost in it to hold
[3:56] that jacket amen we going to have to
[3:58] convert it up from where it was amen
[4:01] amen it needs a better upswing when I'm
[4:02] trying to say it's still back in the
[4:03] Lutheran days I think that little thing
[4:06] amen hallelujah but anyways U not that
[4:09] this is a Lutheran pull pit I didn't
[4:10] mean that but I mean that little hook
[4:12] amen but there's a great debate about uh
[4:15] whether we should believe in prophets of
[4:17] the last day Messengers like brother
[4:19] brandom and I believe the Lord give me a
[4:21] little something here in the first
[4:23] chapter of Hebrews and coming up here
[4:26] and the Lord putting this on my heart
[4:28] brother Jesse I don't mean to say this
[4:29] this out loud like I'm going to say it
[4:30] and I know it's going to be heard but I
[4:32] so wished in my heart knowing that you
[4:35] know the critics stream these little
[4:36] services and things out here I so wish
[4:39] these people would get a hold of what
[4:41] I'm going to say in this first couple
[4:42] verses I think it would help them if
[4:44] they could see it right because you know
[4:47] we could debate about who God's
[4:48] messenger is and we could fuss and go
[4:51] back and forth and opinion about this or
[4:53] that who was supposed to be Malachi for
[4:56] the the argument always goes back well
[4:57] there ain't supposed to be prophets in
[4:59] the last stage we're not supposed to
[5:00] have prophets in it then I will say this
[5:03] for the benefits of not just the Saints
[5:05] but those that be critical and hear me
[5:07] and say this I I want to let them know
[5:09] and I want to let you all know that I
[5:11] don't blame people sometimes for looking
[5:13] at the message people in the churches
[5:14] and the message way they do we've had so
[5:17] much nonsense in the name of this truth
[5:20] it it's understandable why people would
[5:22] be critical it's understandable why they
[5:24] would Point their fingers at certain
[5:26] things around the message of the hour we
[5:28] have certainly been our Own Worst Enemy
[5:30] around this truth and remember it's not
[5:32] been the Pentecostals the Baptist or the
[5:34] Methodist that have brought the shame or
[5:35] the reproach on us it's been our own
[5:37] kind it's been our own people and it's
[5:40] it's important for us I'm saying this
[5:41] for a reason now it's important for us
[5:44] to know not only by Revelation what we
[5:47] believe but to be able to have an answer
[5:50] by scripture of the hope that lays
[5:52] within us now I wouldn't say it this
[5:55] strongly if I didn't know your pastor
[5:56] already preached it this way I might I
[5:58] might might dumb this down or water it
[6:00] down a little bit if somebody was a
[6:02] little bit more upon everything has to
[6:04] be quotes and quotes and quotes and
[6:05] quotes and I I try to respect that too
[6:08] but I know Jesse preaches this and I'm
[6:10] right in the same fellowship with him
[6:12] that everything brother brandham taught
[6:14] to us has to be tied back to scripture
[6:18] amen and here is my hope and here is
[6:21] what I believe that if I can take what
[6:23] brother brandom preached back to the
[6:25] Bible and that is true then I can
[6:28] already give brother Bram the benefit of
[6:30] the doubt and the assumption that his
[6:32] experiences were just as true as what he
[6:35] preached because it come out of the
[6:36] Bible and if I had a man that come to me
[6:38] or a woman come to me and said they had
[6:40] all kinds of experiences and their
[6:41] Revelation was as rotten as it could get
[6:44] then I would sit back and say you know
[6:45] something is not right somewhere because
[6:48] right Revelation now listen to me
[6:50] closely don't you fail this you you
[6:52] little aconites over here you little
[6:54] bride of Christ Fellowship people you
[6:55] listen brother Ben if your Revelation is
[6:58] right it will make your experiences be
[7:00] right that's right people that have
[7:02] wrong experiences more than likely they
[7:05] don't have an understanding of
[7:06] scriptural things can I give you an
[7:08] example before we read a person has a
[7:10] dream brother Ram taught us this and the
[7:12] Bible also teaches us that if a dream
[7:15] comes without an interpreter in the land
[7:17] it must be a direct message Joseph fear
[7:20] not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for
[7:22] that which is conceived in her is the
[7:23] Holy Ghost uh of the Holy Ghost so when
[7:26] we see people come with dreams a lot of
[7:29] Dreams I had a vision I had a this and I
[7:31] had a that and not any of it lines up
[7:33] with any spec of scripture or no
[7:35] Revelation to it most of the time it's
[7:37] just their own subconscious doing a lot
[7:38] of things because of the busyness of the
[7:40] day and they try to make something
[7:42] spiritual out of it to the point to
[7:44] where they can't be corrected amen that
[7:47] you know right then somewhere in their
[7:49] Doctrine somewhere something is wrong
[7:52] because if it is truly God it can be
[7:55] corrected
[7:57] by by the word right no matter what they
[8:01] say it can always be corrected by the
[8:03] word and we want to be correctable
[8:05] people right so the Lord helping us now
[8:08] I want to dwell on this first couple
[8:10] verses but let let's read it together
[8:13] God who at sunry times and in diverse
[8:16] manners spake in times past unto the
[8:19] fathers by the prophets verse two hath
[8:22] in these last days spoken unto us by his
[8:26] son whom he hath appointed heir of All
[8:30] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[8:33] now verse three with me and then we'll
[8:35] pray who being the brightness of his
[8:37] glory and the express image of his
[8:40] person and upholding All Things by the
[8:43] word of his power when he hath by
[8:46] himself purged our sins sat down on the
[8:50] right hand of the Majesty on high and
[8:53] all of the children of God said amen
[8:56] let's bow our heads and pray over the
[8:58] word father thank you for the reading of
[9:00] Thy word Lord as we have quoted it
[9:03] together stated it together Lord we've
[9:07] sat and recited the songs of Zion and
[9:10] sang them from the bottom of our heart
[9:12] we've taken up the offerings and the
[9:14] tithes which is a part of your worship
[9:16] we've come in with our prayer requests
[9:17] which is a part of your worship I would
[9:19] all men stand praying Lord we've come
[9:22] with our Bibles and our hands and our
[9:24] hearts open in the attitude of agreement
[9:26] that's a part of the worship of God
[9:28] we've a with the opening prayer Lord and
[9:31] the songs of special songs and things
[9:34] have been sung to the glory of God now
[9:36] we come to the most sincere part of any
[9:39] service and that is the preaching of the
[9:41] word of God lord we're praying that this
[9:44] morning you will forgive our frailties
[9:47] in every way sins indiscretions wrongs
[9:51] or silliness of humankind forgive us of
[9:53] it Lord wash us of it may we with all
[9:56] seriousness and sobriety approach this
[9:59] open word May the power of God fall upon
[10:02] it fall upon me fall upon them and may
[10:04] you speak with a voice of utterance may
[10:07] it even be a thunder of God that speaks
[10:09] through the words of the Lord this
[10:11] morning that not only announces Lord in
[10:14] the heavens above but in the earth below
[10:16] and in our hearts in the middle may we
[10:19] just as the expression goes may heaven
[10:21] and earth may they Embrace and kiss
[10:23] together and may we just get caught
[10:25] right in the middle of the smack as the
[10:27] old fell said one day Lord Lord Jesus
[10:29] may your glory pour out on us we pray as
[10:32] we look at the great things of God bless
[10:34] us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[10:38] and amen and amen and amen God bless you
[10:40] you may be seated amen now hold your
[10:43] book there in Hebrews for just a little
[10:45] while and being that this is a a good
[10:49] solid teaching church amen I like that
[10:52] because sometimes I feel like we dig
[10:54] into things a little bit on the
[10:56] Evangelistic side which is all right but
[10:58] often we rush through subjects and jump
[11:01] from one thing to another and not really
[11:03] dig deep enough to understand the depth
[11:05] of it all now I want to show if the Lord
[11:08] will help us now how this puts together
[11:11] in the first chapter of Hebrews now I
[11:14] want to get some background about what
[11:17] it is that we're looking at and there's
[11:19] seven chapters right in a row of course
[11:22] I don't mean chronologically or
[11:24] sequentially but I mean there's seven
[11:26] chapters right in a row introducing and
[11:29] these seven chapters bring up a
[11:31] background Paul leading into the eighth
[11:34] chapter where he starts speaking about
[11:36] the Tabernacle of God and the uh body of
[11:40] Jesus Christ which would become the new
[11:42] Tabernacle of the Lord amen in which God
[11:44] would dwell and His glory would never
[11:46] depart from these seven chapters leading
[11:50] up and again I don't mean
[11:51] chronologically now I mean somebody
[11:52] could say well of course they're in a
[11:54] roow brother bin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but what
[11:57] I mean is each of these chapters that
[11:59] they serve a specific purpose in
[12:01] introducing Paul's main idea or his main
[12:04] thought in this book of Hebrews and in
[12:07] order to understand the entire book
[12:09] itself you have to understand how Paul
[12:12] laid this out and what we look at many
[12:15] times in this first verse is Ammunition
[12:18] by those outside the ranks of what we
[12:21] would call the message of the hour that
[12:23] would use this verse to try to establish
[12:26] an understanding about being no more
[12:28] prophets but actually when you look at
[12:31] this in the correct way through the eyes
[12:32] of Revelation what you'll understand is
[12:35] that in this first chapter Paul is not
[12:38] dismissing nor is he distinguishing any
[12:42] type of ministry in the New Testament
[12:45] whatsoever actually what Paul is
[12:47] establishing here is he is referring
[12:50] back in the very first verse he is
[12:52] establishing the Old Testament
[12:54] principles of how the church was called
[12:58] out of Egypt amen under Father Abraham
[13:00] the promise given the church called out
[13:03] amen as the word church is the called
[13:05] out we know and then that church called
[13:07] out amen out of Egypt and then placed
[13:09] under a spiritual system that God had
[13:12] ordained of them in their order of
[13:14] worship we know that when the Tabernacle
[13:17] was pitched amen that God established
[13:19] how to pay tithes how to give offerings
[13:22] how to offer incense how to sacrifice
[13:25] animals what the priest was supposed to
[13:26] be dressed like what the inner Court was
[13:28] supposed to look look like all of the
[13:30] duties and the responsibilities
[13:31] throughout the three courts amen
[13:33] including where the tribes would be
[13:35] positioned on the outside now if you'll
[13:37] think with me just a moment and go right
[13:40] back before this first chapter of
[13:41] Hebrews and let's go back into the Old
[13:43] Testament because when you look at verse
[13:45] one Paul is directly inviting us Amen to
[13:50] go back into the Old Testament to see
[13:52] how God done it look at them first words
[13:55] God in sunry times in diverse manners
[13:59] spaken the past unto the fathers by the
[14:02] prophets if we just stop right there
[14:04] amen and just look exactly what he's
[14:06] trying to tell us he is inviting us to
[14:09] see how God done it in the original way
[14:12] amen and remember before the very days
[14:14] of all of Moses's system setting up and
[14:18] when I say system I don't mean
[14:19] organization but I mean God's way his
[14:22] order or his system of doing things now
[14:25] amen when God established that in Moses
[14:27] amen the sacrifice had to be offered at
[14:30] a certain season time under a certain uh
[14:32] uh pretense a certain animal it had to
[14:35] be perfect it had to have all sort of
[14:36] things amen associated with it and only
[14:39] a certain man could go behind that Veil
[14:42] once a year and offer up the sacrifices
[14:44] to God Amen for the sins of Israel amen
[14:47] but before that system was established
[14:50] amen a man didn't know where to pay his
[14:51] ties at didn't know where to give his
[14:53] offerings unto the Lord at amen anyone
[14:55] at any time could sacrifice at any
[14:58] moment as we would say on the street
[15:00] amen out in the world and things we' say
[15:01] well as the mood hits some amen they
[15:03] just stop and they'd offer up a bulock
[15:05] or Ram or something like that amen it's
[15:08] not that God didn't recognize it amen
[15:10] but there was as Paul tells us a more
[15:13] excellent way coming down the road amen
[15:16] just like the church ages amen when God
[15:18] opened up the church ages amen he
[15:20] started with the church of Pentecost and
[15:22] those early firstborn Believers amen
[15:25] they came on fire for the powers of God
[15:27] that had come through Jesus Christ amen
[15:29] and set the world on fire amen without
[15:32] question they went about doing good that
[15:34] seed then was swn in the seed Amen swn
[15:37] in the ground I mean to say the seed was
[15:39] swn into the ground too many s's in that
[15:41] sentence amen amen amen swn into the
[15:44] ground hallelujah amen and then it come
[15:47] back up through Martin Luther amen now
[15:49] we know that when we examine and study
[15:52] the things that Martin Luther taught
[15:54] amen his hatred against the Jews and his
[15:56] feeling calling them the Antichrist and
[15:58] such as that amen it would be the same
[16:01] exact idea amen as some man out there
[16:03] wandering around in the desert amen and
[16:05] feeling a burden to do something for God
[16:08] like balam who would go and offer seven
[16:10] Rams and seven Bullocks amen a true
[16:12] prophet of God within his time and
[16:14] within his moment that he was true to
[16:16] the Lord amen and here is balam who
[16:18] later becomes a false amen anointed one
[16:22] as we would say in the last day he
[16:23] become an anointed one but false himself
[16:25] amen knew exactly by revelation what it
[16:29] was that God would tell Moses later
[16:31] would be offered all speaking of Christ
[16:34] all speaking of the Resurrection all
[16:36] speaking of the seven Church ages all
[16:38] speaking of all the sevens that would
[16:39] come later on Amen but here's a man
[16:42] without a pastor without an evangelist a
[16:44] teacher a prophet or an apostle without
[16:46] a church without an assembly without a
[16:48] group out by himself all of a sudden
[16:50] gets a revelation sound familiar amen
[16:53] there's Martin Luther he has no guidance
[16:55] he has no Pastor he has no leader and
[16:57] then all of a sudden in the middle of
[16:59] nowhere so to speak God reveals to him
[17:01] the just shall not live by works but the
[17:04] just shall live by faith can you say
[17:06] Amen now God took them into a deeper way
[17:09] amen they come up through Wesley came up
[17:10] through Pentecost and now God Amen after
[17:14] the church ages are running out remember
[17:16] brother bradam his ministry was not to
[17:19] the elect of God entirely but he was a
[17:22] dual type Ministry being a breach
[17:24] messenger like John was he had to stand
[17:26] between two ages and two dispensations
[17:29] amen John was baptizing unto while still
[17:33] standing both feet in the Old Testament
[17:35] amen under that anointing he was
[17:37] pointing unto and now here comes Elijah
[17:39] in the last day amen standing at the end
[17:42] of the Gentile Church ages he's pointing
[17:45] this way to Pentecost and announcing
[17:47] that he who will come will be the
[17:49] Capstone Ministry of the last day Amen
[17:51] brother bradam stood right in the middle
[17:53] between both of them ages amen he was
[17:56] not just the ministry of the minister to
[17:58] you you and I the bride of Christ but he
[18:00] was also the messenger of Lady oia amen
[18:03] and all of that had to be closed out why
[18:06] when the Thunders would begin to sound
[18:08] and the seals would come open amen God
[18:10] like Moses would call them back to the
[18:13] mountain of the Lord amen and in the
[18:15] mountain of the Lord that statue of a
[18:16] perfect man there would have to be a
[18:18] Capstone there would have to be an
[18:20] established order of how God expected us
[18:23] to live and what to do and how to behave
[18:25] amen therefore amen marriage and divorce
[18:27] had to us be established
[18:29] amen the trumpets had to be saw the
[18:31] plagues had to be talked about the vs
[18:33] the Thunders the seals Daniel 70 weeks
[18:36] and every single bit of it amen had to
[18:38] be established for us to know exactly
[18:41] hallelujah how to approach God his word
[18:44] to get oursel ready for the coming of
[18:45] the Lord Jesus amen it's a beautiful
[18:48] type and how it parallels itself and
[18:50] remember now Paul is inviting us to go
[18:53] back and look at that before he
[18:55] introduces his main thought any of you
[18:57] people that's ever been in school here
[18:59] in any way you remember when you used to
[19:01] have to examine a book you had details
[19:03] but you also had a main idea and all of
[19:06] the details were the things that
[19:07] described your main idea and if you
[19:09] don't know the details you don't know
[19:11] the main idea and if you don't know the
[19:12] main idea you probably don't understand
[19:13] the details amen but Paul had to
[19:16] establish for us amen how he was going
[19:19] to bridge the gap between the Old
[19:21] Testament and the New Testament Church
[19:23] all right now watch now he tells us
[19:26] inviting us now God in Sun UND times in
[19:30] diverse manners spake in times P unto
[19:33] the fathers by the prophets now listen
[19:36] to me carefully this is not a
[19:38] declaration of the ending of the
[19:40] prophets right right this next verse
[19:44] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[19:47] by his son whom Heath appointed heir of
[19:51] All Things by whom also he U made the
[19:55] worlds now if in the last days he had
[19:58] spoken unto us by his son all right
[20:02] let's establish what the last days are
[20:04] remember the last days is not just a uh
[20:07] uh just a time period hanging in space
[20:09] somewhere or another nobody knows when
[20:11] it begins or when it ended but the last
[20:13] days are the last two days that was
[20:15] prophesied or 2,000 years of church
[20:18] history amen these men had no Revelation
[20:21] on when the coming of the Lord was going
[20:23] to be and when they spoke it they spoke
[20:25] it like it happen any moment in any hour
[20:28] right and you know what beautiful about
[20:29] it when they went down into the dirt and
[20:30] took the dirt nap as brother B called it
[20:32] amen when they get up at the coming of
[20:34] the Lord Jesus they went down looking
[20:36] for him urgent for his coming they'll
[20:38] get up looking for him urgent for his
[20:40] coming oh what people we ought to be
[20:42] sitting here this morning urgent for the
[20:44] coming of the Lord hallelujah amen and
[20:46] this is not let me say again this is not
[20:49] a declaration of the ending of the
[20:51] prophets stop with me a moment this man
[20:54] said he spoke to us by the prophets now
[20:57] he speaks by his son
[20:59] if Paul believed that God was no longer
[21:03] going to use prophets then somebody
[21:06] please tell me what he meant by this in
[21:09] 1 Corinthians
[21:11] 14:37 I'm going to give our sister about
[21:13] four or five seconds here every how long
[21:15] it takes you to put this up I'm going to
[21:16] let I'm going to let you see it with
[21:17] your eyes first it'll just make a deeper
[21:20] impression all right and then let's see
[21:22] I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 14:37 is that
[21:25] right7 37 what did I say 47
[21:29] by yeah that's the one all right yeah
[21:32] yeah all right just let it linger a
[21:36] moment all right now if we take what
[21:38] they say people in the world hath in the
[21:41] last days spoken unto us by his son see
[21:44] there brother Ben see no more prophets
[21:47] same man said this same man said that
[21:50] yes amen good brother good now we got a
[21:52] problem here either Paul's being like
[21:54] Peter and speaks out of this side of his
[21:56] mouth with one group and then speaks out
[21:57] of another out of that one
[21:59] or maybe the man that they're assigning
[22:01] and and attributing that that thought
[22:04] that there's no more Prophet they're
[22:05] attributing it to the man saying that
[22:07] Paul believed that when really if you
[22:10] look at this Paul didn't believe that
[22:12] that's right yes amen because you'll
[22:13] notice he says if any man thinks himself
[22:16] to be spiritual or a prophet well if he
[22:19] didn't believe in prophets what's he
[22:20] saying this for yes sir hello somebody
[22:23] Hallelujah the fact of the matter is
[22:26] this man didn't believe what they say he
[22:27] believed here
[22:29] that's right but rather if you look at
[22:30] it closely and let the Holy Spirit open
[22:32] up to your eyes he is introducing to us
[22:35] a change oh my in verse one he's telling
[22:38] us what God did in verse two he's
[22:41] telling us what he's getting ready to do
[22:42] amen Paul has not established to these
[22:45] people yet who is speaking to us in the
[22:48] last days remember many of these people
[22:51] that he introduces his letters to
[22:52] they're already Christians they're
[22:53] already born again they've already heard
[22:55] the gospel preach you can tell by his
[22:57] salutation to the church that's in
[22:59] Ephesus the saved the Sanctified the
[23:01] born again but where's that at in the
[23:03] book of Hebrews Hallelujah when he
[23:06] starts out chapter one he don't say to
[23:07] the saved and the Sanctified and the
[23:09] Born Again In Heavenly places he starts
[23:11] introducing to them the Gospel of Jesus
[23:14] Christ as has been updated by the season
[23:18] and the time of Prophecy and the hour
[23:20] that Paul was living He is telling this
[23:22] Hebrew church about what God did and
[23:25] what God is doing right now and what
[23:26] he's getting ready to do he spends the
[23:29] entire book trying to show them who
[23:30] Jesus Christ was Hallelujah now if these
[23:33] are born again people what's he spending
[23:34] all that time
[23:36] for the problem is they're not looking
[23:38] at it through the eyes of Revelation
[23:40] they've taken some scholar some
[23:42] Theologian that's tried to explain away
[23:44] the need for a messenger in this day and
[23:47] in doing so they use these verses to
[23:49] back them up and their argument as thin
[23:51] as the broth made from the shadow of a
[23:53] chicken starve five times a death that's
[23:55] right there not a scriptural basis in it
[23:57] whatsoever come on don't you get quiet
[23:59] on me it's true right exactly what
[24:02] they're trying to do and it's nothing
[24:03] but the devil putting deception on the
[24:06] people because in order for the
[24:08] mysteries of God to be finished in the
[24:10] last day it wasn't an apostle that he
[24:12] said he'd s he didn't say behold I'll
[24:14] send you Malachi amen Elijah the pastor
[24:18] or Elijah the teacher or Elijah the
[24:20] Apostle but he announced he would be a
[24:23] prophet why because only the word of the
[24:27] Lord can come to the Prophet yes oh my
[24:31] now that's a big statement within
[24:32] himself seeing as how in the book of
[24:34] Acts alone you got 13
[24:36] prophets go back and count them Judas
[24:39] and Silas and agabus and different ones
[24:42] amen all called prophets of the Lord
[24:45] amen in this day and age people have
[24:48] such an Old Testament thinking about how
[24:51] the church is supposed to operate amen
[24:54] and if I can preach fast enough and you
[24:56] can listen quick enough if that clock
[24:58] will SL slow down on me I'm going to
[24:59] show you some things about the order of
[25:01] this if God help me because I think what
[25:03] we need to understand is how the order
[25:05] of the church has been established God
[25:08] never intended for us to be left without
[25:11] profits even in the last
[25:13] day the biggest argument we have today
[25:16] is over Joseph brandham why because
[25:18] we've got quotes about Brother Joseph we
[25:20] don't have quotes about John or Jack or
[25:23] these other guys we have quotes about
[25:25] Brother Joseph therefore everybody will
[25:27] lean to those quotes quot I say
[25:28] everybody but I mean a portion of people
[25:30] will lean to those quotes because
[25:32] brother bam said it but let's understand
[25:34] something in the New Testament Church
[25:36] amen it is not a prophet exactly that is
[25:40] the voice of God to the day remember
[25:42] Isaiah said to whom of the AR is the arm
[25:45] of the Lord revealed and then John sees
[25:47] that arm in the Book of Revelation and
[25:50] that arm is clutching Seven Stars and
[25:53] the revelation of Christ would come
[25:55] through those Seven Stars what were they
[25:57] seven Spirits amen seven anointings that
[26:00] was sent by the one anointing the great
[26:02] spirit of God like a fountain pouring
[26:04] out Seven Rivers or seven streams Amen
[26:07] in every age under a specific message
[26:10] that would call the people out and I
[26:12] know what the critics are saying now how
[26:14] in the world can a man like it was in
[26:16] the days of Columba and them amen that
[26:18] they was in one age and the people was
[26:20] in another amen well if God Amen had it
[26:23] so perfectly then why did Brother B put
[26:25] him dead before the message even lived
[26:27] on you know it's almost like people
[26:29] don't believe in Preachers even in the
[26:30] critic side of things amen because all
[26:33] it would take is for one Columba to
[26:35] preach what the spirit spoke to him and
[26:38] let one evangelist One Pastor one
[26:40] Prophet one Apostle and one teacher get
[26:42] a hold of that message and that message
[26:44] would propagate for Generations amen I
[26:47] haven't seen Paul either I'm not in
[26:49] Paul's age amen but if I preach anything
[26:52] contr let me be a cursed that's right
[26:54] Hallelujah a man don't have to be
[26:55] present to have an influence over the
[26:57] age that he's been given that's right
[26:59] hallelujah amen it's just like you at
[27:01] home amen living the life that you live
[27:03] I'm talking about Good lives Christian
[27:04] lives amen your pastor don't have to be
[27:06] sitting in your leg just he don't have
[27:08] to be amen sitting with you in Wally
[27:09] world Amen or going to the schoolhouse
[27:11] or somewhere with you to make sure that
[27:13] you live right to have an influence over
[27:15] you no he preaches the gospel he brings
[27:18] in men that believe the truth amen you
[27:20] Fellowship around the carcass of that
[27:22] word and where the carcass is the Eagles
[27:24] will be
[27:25] gathered hallelujah amen you come and
[27:28] you Feast on that word and the influence
[27:30] of that word follows you in the absence
[27:33] of the messenger hallelujah amen it
[27:35] doesn't matter if the man was present
[27:36] for the age or not he was the one that
[27:39] started as it was threw the rock up in
[27:41] the air and got the message going but I
[27:43] don't want talk about that how many
[27:46] times have people been influenced by
[27:48] this remark it is the right mental
[27:52] attitude toward any promise of God will
[27:55] bring it to pass how many has been
[27:57] influenced by that little statement
[27:59] brother Brams said it but it wasn't
[28:00] brother
[28:01] Brams that come from FF Bosworth go back
[28:04] and read his book Christ the Healer go
[28:06] he didn't get that from brother he
[28:07] didn't get that from Brother brand
[28:08] brother brand got that from brother
[28:09] bonworth who was his mentor that's right
[28:12] hello somebody yes sir amen unless
[28:13] you're a prophet worshipper this is this
[28:15] easy for you come on now amen and where
[28:19] did Brother Bosworth get it he got that
[28:20] inspiration from somebody else and they
[28:23] got that inspiration from somebody else
[28:25] it may have trapped back hundreds of
[28:27] years before the original remark was
[28:28] even given but just because a man isn't
[28:31] sitting right there does not mean the
[28:34] influence of it
[28:35] is I've never seen brother brandom I
[28:38] know it's not in one meeting the best
[28:40] I've ever done was read a book hear a
[28:42] tape see the videos and the pictures
[28:44] that's about as good as it gets for me
[28:45] but the influence of this message has
[28:48] caused me to come closer to Jesus Christ
[28:50] than I've ever been in my entire life
[28:53] and that's what matters at the end of
[28:54] the
[28:55] day amen and you have to understand that
[28:57] the Prophecy of the last day was God
[29:00] would send Elijah the
[29:02] prophet why the prophet of the hour
[29:05] would be the one inspired and gifted to
[29:07] be able to take the message the word and
[29:10] break it down and interpret it for the
[29:12] people it could have been prophesied in
[29:14] the last days I'll send you Elijah the
[29:18] pastors it could have been prophesied
[29:20] I'll send you Elijah the apostles God
[29:22] could have done whatever he wanted to do
[29:24] but the key thing to remember was the
[29:26] man was a star first
[29:29] he that hath an ear not they not them
[29:33] not those he that hath an ear let him
[29:36] singular him hear what the spirit says
[29:38] unto the church that star was the only
[29:41] one that could hear what God was saying
[29:44] in that age could you imagine what a
[29:46] responsibility that must have been
[29:47] brother b stand there knowing he was the
[29:49] only ear on the earth that was hearing
[29:51] directly from God what God thought about
[29:53] this hour Hallelujah GL none of the
[29:55] other ones had that Revelation about
[29:57] themselves not only that he had the
[29:59] burden of the sign M Messianic sign he
[30:01] had the burden of people sleeping on his
[30:03] front doorstep his kids having to step
[30:05] over him to go to school if he was such
[30:07] a deceiver and such a liar why'd people
[30:09] run to him like that why didn't his
[30:12] peers speak up and say what a liar is
[30:14] why have we waited 60 years for a bunch
[30:16] of intellectuals to go back and pick up
[30:18] a bunch of magazines and
[30:20] articles amen that I don't know I could
[30:22] trust those men and women either that's
[30:25] right I'd like to see what else they
[30:26] wrote how biased they were about
[30:28] subjects you don't know maybe one of
[30:30] their grandmas got offended by Brother
[30:32] bam telling her how short her hair was
[30:34] and he decided to get even with the
[30:36] prophet of God right oh it's easy to
[30:38] declare amen and establish something
[30:40] when you're looking at it through the
[30:41] keyhole of your own filter amen but if
[30:44] God thought enough of William brandom to
[30:46] cause all of the Miracles that he caused
[30:48] all of the Revelation that he caused
[30:51] Hallelujah and it stayed right with that
[30:52] word right there that I'm just dumb
[30:55] enough to believe that everything else
[30:56] has to hit true the same word
[30:59] do I believe brother B got confused do I
[31:01] believe he misunderstood things do I
[31:02] believe he mixed it up of course I do he
[31:04] was an uneducated
[31:06] hillbilly now listen I'm raised with the
[31:08] hillbillies my people are Hillbillies I
[31:11] know how they do I had an uncle that
[31:12] would tell me the same story 40
[31:14] different ways every time he told it
[31:16] that doesn't strike me as that he's some
[31:18] kind of a oh he's an idiot he's a dummy
[31:20] he's a fool he's a he's a deceiver
[31:22] I didn't call the man name I just said
[31:24] to poor old Hill he can't remember
[31:26] nothing I attribute that kind of respect
[31:28] to brother brandham listen as it was
[31:30] told one time amen as it was told Amen
[31:34] to a brother down in Dayton I'll just
[31:36] say it that way maybe I should keep his
[31:37] name out of my mouth amen he asked Billy
[31:39] Paul Billy he said that man in Canada
[31:42] for example he said how many times did
[31:44] that happen to brother Brenham he said
[31:46] Billy Paul rolled his eyes kind of back
[31:48] in his head like this he said I never
[31:49] thought of it like that he said but you
[31:51] know that happened to Daddy over and
[31:53] over and over and over and over and over
[31:56] again now you w't tell me bunch of
[31:58] intellectuals come along that ain't
[32:00] never laid hands on nobody and never
[32:01] seen God do nothing ain't never preached
[32:03] a sermon and see nobody saved and where
[32:05] what church are we supposed to go to if
[32:07] we leave the message what place do we
[32:10] leave that's got more truth that's got
[32:12] more to us if we are in a call why are
[32:14] people in this message getting closer to
[32:16] God and God vindicating it better
[32:19] Hallelujah that's right oh you say it's
[32:21] become a great mess yes it has because
[32:24] it's supposed to every true move of God
[32:25] will have this foolishness around it but
[32:28] that doesn't mean God disqualifies the
[32:30] real that's inside of it that's right
[32:34] Hallelujah and here we
[32:37] see God in the last days has spoken to
[32:40] us by his
[32:43] son same man Ephesians chapter 4 and he
[32:47] that's the son gave some Apostles
[32:50] prophets teachers evangelists and
[32:51] pastors sir for the work of the ministry
[32:55] and Paul was trying to dismiss prophets
[32:58] in this verse oh here we go but brother
[33:01] Ben the law and the prophets were until
[33:03] John I wish y'all just look up in school
[33:05] what that word and
[33:07] means it's a conjunction it's a part of
[33:10] speech that connects two main thoughts
[33:12] yes sir for the law and the prophets
[33:15] were until John that's right but after
[33:18] the law had been completed after the law
[33:22] had been fulfilled that did not mean God
[33:24] dismissed and distinguished uh uh
[33:27] extinguished rather the prophets of God
[33:30] prophets carried on the law was
[33:32] fulfilled
[33:34] amen hello yes sir and again Jesus was
[33:37] not making a declaration that because
[33:41] I'm here I'm ending all prophets that's
[33:43] right brother if he did then why'd he
[33:45] come along in Matthew and say truly
[33:47] Elias will come and restore all things
[33:49] that's in the
[33:50] future yes sir sir praise the Lord if
[33:54] that's the case why did Jesus himself
[33:56] say beware of false prophets in the
[33:59] future last I checked if there's a false
[34:02] one there's got to be a true one hiding
[34:05] somewhere Jesus did not declare the end
[34:07] of the prophets all he was declaring to
[34:09] the people was look at the present stage
[34:13] of my Ministry look at where we are
[34:16] right now it was not a declaration of
[34:19] the extinguishing of these men or their
[34:21] Ministries he was trying to show them
[34:23] glory to God where they were living and
[34:26] what time they were living in hallelujah
[34:28] amen and if they saw it correctly saw it
[34:30] right they would see Jesus was showing
[34:32] them you have held on to the prophets
[34:34] and the law but then he turned around
[34:35] and said but here I am I fulfill every
[34:37] bit of that that's right he wasn't
[34:40] trying to dismiss these men he was
[34:41] trying to show them I am completing
[34:43] everything they work for yes sir every
[34:46] labor that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the
[34:48] rest of time had put in Amen to build
[34:49] the body of Christ up to get it ready
[34:51] for the headstone I am your
[34:54] head and they wanted to kill him for it
[34:57] so Jesus prophesied to him again he said
[34:59] that's right the head he said the
[35:02] Cornerstone would be rejected that was
[35:04] him he said but that Cornerstone that
[35:06] stumbling Stone would also be made the
[35:09] head that which was the corner would
[35:11] also be made the head and do you know
[35:14] that word that Jesus uses in there when
[35:16] he talks about amen he said that the
[35:18] builders rejected do you know that word
[35:20] means
[35:21] preachers many of the leaders in that
[35:23] day now I'm simplifying that of course
[35:25] but at the essence of it it is the
[35:27] Ministry of that day that stood right in
[35:30] front of their congregation said now
[35:31] listen this Jesus of Nazareth he's not
[35:33] approved of us but he didn't have to be
[35:36] cuz John said he was approved of
[35:39] God woo glory to God hallelujah he
[35:43] didn't need to be approved of man
[35:44] neither did Brother bradam neither did
[35:46] Paul neither do you neither do I we must
[35:48] be approved of God that's how we get our
[35:53] Vindication amen God approved him going
[35:56] about doing good and doing the things
[35:58] that his father would show him amen it
[36:01] was not a declaration of the ending of
[36:04] the
[36:04] prophets how in the world can people be
[36:07] so blinded it's the devil that's all
[36:09] there is to it yes sir even Luther
[36:11] Wesley the Pentecostals all the way far
[36:14] back even after the death of the
[36:15] Apostles there was still an
[36:17] incorporation of prophetic throughout
[36:19] the entire church ages until we come all
[36:21] the way to the end time and all of a
[36:23] sudden magically out of nowhere we don't
[36:25] believe in prophets no more right for
[36:27] 2,000 years the church has believed in
[36:30] prophets until we get to this age wonder
[36:34] why if people have got any wisdom at all
[36:37] if they intelligent spiritually speaking
[36:39] they can see it's nothing more than the
[36:40] devil trying to throw the heat off of
[36:42] the Revelation that's being fulfilled in
[36:44] the last day right yes sir
[36:47] good you know the nature of anything by
[36:50] watching what it
[36:51] does good and
[36:54] yet somebody will say well now brother
[36:58] being we only believe in one Prophet to
[37:01] the age woo be careful
[37:04] now now you're talking like the Old
[37:06] Testament may I say to you like Paul did
[37:09] God in sunry times and diverse manners
[37:11] spake unto the fathers by one
[37:14] Prophet God dealt to isra dealt with
[37:17] Israel as a Onan ministry right there
[37:22] were no evangelists under Isaiah's
[37:24] Ministry that's right brother yes they
[37:27] were are no teachers
[37:29] pastors which which group of people did
[37:32] Isaiah write and say now when you go to
[37:34] a city ordain
[37:37] Elders never in the Old Testament do you
[37:39] see the ministry being established
[37:41] except for one place that was in the
[37:43] Tabernacle yes good good and those men
[37:47] would preach what the prophet said to
[37:49] those
[37:51] people interesting isn't it that they
[37:54] would preach what the prophet said but
[37:56] they had to line up with what the
[37:57] prophet said for the age just like you
[38:00] and I we have to line up to what brother
[38:02] bam said in the last day amen or you say
[38:05] but I'm confused by that get the Holy
[38:07] Ghost you don't have to worry about that
[38:08] confusion will be solved when you get
[38:09] born again that's right Born Again will
[38:12] straighten out have all that problem am
[38:13] mean because Jesus himself said when I
[38:15] come and make my Abode he the spirit of
[38:17] truth will show you things that will
[38:19] come shortly to pass I'll solve all of
[38:22] those confusions if you just get born
[38:23] again hallelujah amen so it leads me to
[38:26] believe a lot of the reason people are
[38:27] confused either a they're not studying
[38:29] deep enough and they are born again and
[38:31] they're just not applying themselves or
[38:33] they're just not born again all the way
[38:34] through it that's amen remember what
[38:36] Paul said they that are of a carnal mind
[38:39] amen they can only compare things
[38:42] natural to things that are natural but
[38:45] we that are born again with the spirit
[38:46] of God in us we can compare that which
[38:48] is spiritual Amen to that which is
[38:50] spiritual as well
[38:52] Hallelujah that's why you can take these
[38:54] things and parallel them to the Bible
[38:57] cuz you're a spiritual minded person you
[38:58] can see it if it's laying there you can
[39:00] see it
[39:02] plainly oh my imagine that Paul
[39:05] backgrounding we have heard from the
[39:07] prophets of the Old Testament one man to
[39:10] one
[39:11] generation those men that was dedicated
[39:14] to the Tabernacle they would come and
[39:16] they would speak to the people but God's
[39:19] mouthpiece was not those
[39:20] men one Prophet to the age coming to the
[39:24] New Testament God had one star and from
[39:27] from that star he sent the message and
[39:29] then that message would be propagated
[39:32] now in the five-fold ministry that came
[39:34] out from it listen to me carefully those
[39:37] five-fold Ministry would become the
[39:39] voice of God to the people yes was no
[39:43] longer just standing up there and
[39:44] reading the prophet said the prophet
[39:46] said Moses said on page so and so verse
[39:48] so and so volume God didn't call us to
[39:50] be professional
[39:52] quarters praise the Lord somebody my job
[39:56] is to take the INSP ation that came from
[39:58] the angel of the age and preached that
[40:01] to you just as likeminded as if brother
[40:03] Bram was standing right here himself
[40:05] amen hallelujah which is entirely
[40:07] different from what they had in the Old
[40:09] Testament those men didn't have the
[40:10] inspiration of God to break into what
[40:12] the prophet said for that day and break
[40:14] it down to the people that's right
[40:16] that's
[40:18] right because we're not talking about
[40:20] gifted men now we're talking about men
[40:22] that were anointed by a natural
[40:24] bloodline do you know the difference
[40:26] between those In Those Old Testament oh
[40:28] I don't say they couldn't get inspired I
[40:29] don't say God couldn't reveal things to
[40:31] them and show but not like today it's a
[40:33] completely different thing as it is
[40:35] today the blood of bulls and Bullocks
[40:36] and goats and lambs and things will not
[40:39] cover the sin of a human being today
[40:40] they could Slaughter every lamb in the
[40:42] field it would not take your sin away
[40:44] amen cuz there was only one and John
[40:46] declared him Behold the Lamb of God that
[40:48] takes away the sins of the
[40:51] world Amen and as he was declared to be
[40:54] who he was that's the only lamb that can
[40:56] wash away our sins
[40:57] GL to God they all had their place they
[40:59] all had their time and the voice of
[41:01] their blood spoke for the people of that
[41:04] dispensation but now we have a more
[41:07] excellent
[41:09] way and that is the blood of the Lord
[41:11] Jesus Christ and the life thereof
[41:15] Hallelujah notice now the men of God the
[41:20] ministry become the voice of God hold on
[41:23] under their
[41:25] messenger saying only what Paul said
[41:28] saying what all the rest of them said I
[41:30] was preaching in a church quite far
[41:32] north from here and if any of these
[41:34] folks are streaming me and they hear me
[41:35] say this you forgive me I'm not say
[41:36] anything ugly about you but there's a
[41:39] group up there and some of them are just
[41:40] absolute brandom worshippers and I I
[41:41] told them so so I'm not hiding
[41:43] anything and I told him I said to hold
[41:46] brother brandham to that kind of a
[41:47] standard that brother brandham had a
[41:49] superior Revelation to everybody else
[41:51] nonsense and
[41:53] hogwash William brandham never done what
[41:56] he done done on his
[41:58] own all right now here come our Critics
[42:00] on the other side that's right he
[42:02] plagiarized everything please for God's
[42:04] sakes please go back and look at the
[42:06] definition of
[42:07] plagiarism plagiarism is to make it your
[42:09] own and not tell nobody where you got it
[42:11] and I go all through the message of the
[42:13] hour and show you places that brother B
[42:14] talked about amen Clarence Lark and all
[42:16] the rest of them that he studied after
[42:18] he made no bones or no exceptions about
[42:20] telling us that he had to study and read
[42:23] and find out what these men believe to
[42:24] find what the Holy Spirit would say for
[42:26] the age he never heal hid that or
[42:28] concealed that from us he told us right
[42:30] off the bat what was going on in the
[42:32] beginning that's not plagiarism that's
[42:34] using work to try to uh previous work to
[42:37] try to establish an understanding on
[42:40] something is it me plagiarizing if I
[42:42] stand here and quote Paul and didn't
[42:43] tell you Paul said
[42:45] it you got your own Bible you know where
[42:48] it come from do I have to stand up here
[42:51] and say to you every time I say it now
[42:53] the Apostle Paul said Jesus Christ the
[42:55] same yesterday and forever
[42:58] brother R knew people studyed they
[42:59] understood where they could get these
[43:00] things that's right if he was trying to
[43:03] conceal it from us he would have done
[43:04] something so much different change words
[43:06] change phrases change dates made it look
[43:09] like he didn't get it from them at all
[43:11] but he was dumb enough to even use their
[43:13] own diagrams and things like that I
[43:15] guess there were no libraries in the 50s
[43:17] and the 60s that people could go find
[43:18] these books for themselves I guess they
[43:20] wasn't selling them on bookshelves
[43:22] brother Jesse I guess it was only
[43:23] brother Bram that had his very personal
[43:25] copy
[43:28] right wasn't
[43:30] plagiarism he was doing what God called
[43:32] him to do which is take all of the
[43:35] truths for 2,000 years and tie them
[43:38] together and solve and answer these
[43:40] questions for us and he didn't have a
[43:42] superior Revelation he went beyond the
[43:44] curtain of time and said I preach
[43:45] exactly what Paul
[43:47] preached where did Paul get where God in
[43:51] sunry times and diverse manners spake
[43:54] unto us he's putting himself in there
[43:56] you know
[43:57] wo Glory oh that was fresh and new I
[44:00] like that spoke unto us by the fatherto
[44:03] the fathers by our
[44:05] prophets he didn't get it on his own
[44:07] either he quoted so many different
[44:09] places that all of those men said and if
[44:12] you go through Paul's own letter he
[44:13] didn't go around and say now John said
[44:15] Jeremiah said Ezekiel said every great
[44:18] now then you'll hear him say as it is
[44:21] written well and by the terms and
[44:24] definitions of most people today Paul
[44:25] was a plagiarizer
[44:30] but it ain't true that's right it ain't
[44:32] true it's just absolutely not the truth
[44:35] it's people with an agenda who have been
[44:37] hurt hurt by message Theory hurt by
[44:40] message ideas hurt by message dogmas
[44:43] that's right brother that's right and
[44:45] really what these people need they don't
[44:46] realize that they need deeper healing
[44:48] than some of our own people sitting in
[44:49] the pews yes sir yes sir because to take
[44:53] such an attack against one man like that
[44:55] that ought to tell you something
[44:58] yes if the message is false why
[45:00] care just walk off and leave well we're
[45:02] going to warn everybody else to wear
[45:05] where you going to take us when you're
[45:07] done warning me what church should I
[45:09] believe oh just believe the Bible and be
[45:10] a good Christian well good for you you
[45:12] now join the same Club as 900 different
[45:15] denominations all saying the same
[45:17] foolishness love Jesus you'll go to
[45:19] heaven not everybody that loves Jesus is
[45:21] going to heaven I got news for you it
[45:24] ain't whether you love Jesus or not it's
[45:26] whether Jesus loves you that's right oh
[45:29] you say he loves everybody be careful of
[45:31] that Jacob have I love and Esau have I
[45:34] hated there is a perfect hatred that
[45:37] comes from the Holy Spirit when you
[45:38] cross that word he'll Mark your name out
[45:40] of the book and you're done that's right
[45:43] you think he has love for Judas you
[45:45] think he has concern and care for Judas
[45:47] he did it one time but when he crossed
[45:49] the line that was it God can't love and
[45:52] hate a man at the same time his own
[45:53] nature condemns him to be mixed minded
[45:55] like that that's right right amen amen
[45:58] the denominational thinking is well just
[46:00] love God and just serve the Lord and
[46:02] just read your Bible really okay we've
[46:05] had this book for 2,000 years and still
[46:08] we got organization trinitarianism false
[46:11] baptisms of all kind beliefs on Holiness
[46:14] that's every Wich of place I've been
[46:16] going back through brother Jesse's book
[46:18] again and I got I bought me a a journal
[46:21] just for the purpose of going through
[46:22] the book been making notes and things
[46:24] like that and about about back through
[46:27] the first four chapters again and I tell
[46:29] you to me it was so beautiful and I put
[46:33] a flower Bud on him before amen the
[46:35] grave gets him
[46:37] amen amen but I thought it was so
[46:41] beautiful how the
[46:42] idea one of the premises of the book
[46:46] behind all that was written was not this
[46:48] idea you better do this or you'll going
[46:51] to hell but it was the idea of if you
[46:53] love God you want to be the most
[46:55] pleasing to him that you can
[46:57] you want to serve the Lord you want to
[46:59] serve him in the deepness of sincerity
[47:01] so you're willing to do or dress or act
[47:04] in any way that God would be pleased
[47:06] with your life amen and brother Jesse
[47:08] let me say publicly amen I know this
[47:10] goes on this internet I know shame in it
[47:12] but let me say publicly how proud and
[47:14] how much I admire that kind of spirit
[47:16] behind text like that because we've had
[47:19] one quotebook after another we've had
[47:21] one writing after another amen that's
[47:23] constantly pointing Believe it or you're
[47:24] going to hell amen but the real idea
[47:26] behind the message of this hour and I
[47:27] want critics and all to hear me amen is
[47:30] a relationship with the Lord Jesus
[47:32] Christ falling in love with God somebody
[47:34] help me preach right now amen falling in
[47:37] love with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[47:40] having your heart full of the Holy Ghost
[47:42] with it you are on your way to hell but
[47:45] not because God wants to send you there
[47:48] because you choose to go there that's
[47:51] right that's the reason you go God don't
[47:53] send nobody to hell they do by their own
[47:56] decisions they send them to hell that's
[47:58] right amen if Jesus had his way if he
[48:02] wanted to have his perfect way I'm
[48:04] willing God he said I don't want anybody
[48:06] to perish that's what I feel in my heart
[48:09] for Humanity I know what kind of
[48:11] condition they got into I set the stage
[48:13] for this all to work out the way it did
[48:15] and if I had my brother so to speak I'd
[48:17] let everybody be saved but God knows
[48:19] they can't he knows it's not possible
[48:22] for everybody to be saved he knows that
[48:24] the serpent seed introduced another
[48:26] spiritual line that's right yes and
[48:29] being that God had to express everything
[48:31] that he was and knowing that he had to
[48:33] open up that window to let the devil
[48:36] come into the human race and start this
[48:38] thing a person as I went through some of
[48:41] the believe the sign material on
[48:42] Facebook the other day I noticed again
[48:44] and again and again a complete
[48:45] repudiation of the serpent Seed doctrine
[48:48] how in the world are we going to know
[48:50] how Satan's working on humankind if we
[48:52] can't find out how he got into the
[48:54] humankind how are we going to know where
[48:56] it all started as I've said to you
[48:59] before a little Tabernacle out here amen
[49:02] Jesus and John the rest of these men
[49:05] when they talked about the devil they
[49:06] called him serpents and
[49:08] snakes of all of the animals they could
[49:10] have chosen the animal kingdom of all
[49:13] the animals that God could have told
[49:14] Moses to put up on a pole why didn't you
[49:16] say put a chimpanzee on a
[49:18] pole why didn't you say put a baboon or
[49:20] put a put a monkey or put a rhinoceros
[49:23] or or an elephant or a giraffe on the
[49:25] pole yes sir all the animals that God
[49:28] wanted to bring healing through why'
[49:30] they have to look at a serpent on a
[49:32] pole why was it a snake that John said
[49:35] you Generation of Vipers down there
[49:37] right cuz God and those men and those
[49:39] prophets know amen where that original
[49:41] sin began amen right back here in the
[49:43] Garden of Eden when there was a creature
[49:45] that stood upright like the serpent amen
[49:47] had the ability to be indwelled by the
[49:48] devil and Satan used that being to
[49:50] interject his human seed that human seed
[49:53] the serpent wasn't a man amen just like
[49:55] we would think but he was was a man just
[49:57] the same sure he was he had a different
[50:01] look he was much taller and bigger than
[50:02] everything else stronger for the Giants
[50:04] come from later that's right brother yes
[50:07] amen and brother even said one place and
[50:08] forgive this I'm using a term from the
[50:10] 50s but I'm quoting this directly from
[50:13] condemnation by representation brother
[50:14] said and throwing it off on the colored
[50:16] race he call them amen we wouldn't say
[50:18] that today we'd say the black race or
[50:19] something like that he said they're as
[50:21] ignorant as they can be the serpant
[50:24] wasn't a monkey he wasn't a reptile he
[50:26] was a
[50:27] man and he was built in a way that his
[50:29] seed line could mix with Eve that's
[50:31] right and he done it and produced twins
[50:34] within that girl from Adam and from The
[50:36] Serpent and then God cursed him and put
[50:38] him on his belly and made him a snake
[50:41] Moses picked him up John picked him up
[50:43] amen they come all the way into the New
[50:45] Testament Church and even in history
[50:47] they're worshiping serpents yes sir yes
[50:50] sir why John called it that old serpent
[50:53] that old Dragon called the devil
[50:57] amen why are these things being
[51:01] concealed number one God hides it from
[51:03] the eyes of the wise and prudent but he
[51:05] reveals it to Baby such as we learn I
[51:08] want to say something to you little
[51:09] church I don't care what you're going
[51:11] through I don't care what mistakes you
[51:12] made I don't care how down you feel on
[51:14] yourself if you've got a teachable
[51:16] spirit within you that wants to know
[51:17] what's right that alone ought to be
[51:19] enough to make you rise to your feet and
[51:21] scream to the top of your lungs and say
[51:23] thank you Jesus for keeping your hand on
[51:24] my life Hallelujah Glory amen I mean if
[51:27] you want to be just the least bit
[51:29] teachable the least bit understanding
[51:31] amen get an understanding rather from
[51:33] the word of God and be understood and
[51:35] the things that you are dealing with as
[51:36] a
[51:38] Christian it ought to put pride in your
[51:41] heart a pride in your heart to say Lord
[51:44] thank you thank you for loving me and
[51:47] caring for me and not giving up on my
[51:49] life no matter what came my
[51:51] way amen it ought to make us rejoice it
[51:55] ought to make us like Jesus he said
[51:57] father I thank you I thank you that
[52:00] you've hid these things from the eyes of
[52:02] the
[52:03] wise Hallelujah God amen and praise the
[52:06] Lord and Hallelujah now notice again in
[52:09] this first chapter Paul is now
[52:12] introducing to them and backgrounding
[52:15] them the change from the Old Testament
[52:17] to the New
[52:18] Testament in Hebrews chapter two Paul
[52:22] continues to position Christ in his
[52:25] supreme authority
[52:27] just background these and find out the
[52:28] pattern of this as I said all seven
[52:30] chapters I don't mean chronologically or
[52:32] sequentially but the thought that Paul
[52:34] is bringing he's building up all of the
[52:36] background to get to his main
[52:37] idea the second chapter he is
[52:40] positioning Christ as Supreme deity go
[52:42] back and read that second chapter
[52:43] Hebrews and watch again if Paul didn't
[52:45] say it over and over and over again made
[52:46] him a little lower than the Angels thou
[52:48] has put all things under subjection
[52:50] under his feet it becomes him who are
[52:52] all things by whom are all things and
[52:54] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[52:56] the captain of their salvation per
[52:58] perfect through suffering on and on
[53:00] chapter three he identifies him as the
[53:02] high priest of the New Testament and it
[53:05] continues to bridge the gap in chapter
[53:07] three between the Jews of the Old
[53:09] Testament and how there is a new
[53:11] generation of Believers given a covenant
[53:13] through Jesus
[53:15] Christ all right then you pick up
[53:16] chapter four Paul tells us that we are
[53:19] to enter into this promise of God not
[53:21] like those of the Old Testament who and
[53:24] I quote not to plagiarize of course but
[53:26] to quote they had their hearts
[53:28] hardened to the truth but Christ gave
[53:31] them a natural Sabbath but unto us we
[53:33] are given a spiritual one in Christ
[53:36] Jesus anybody remember what Hebrews 4:12
[53:39] says for the word of God is quick and
[53:41] more powerful sharper than a two-edged
[53:42] sword dividing aunder between the finest
[53:45] parts of humanity spirituality and
[53:47] anything else in the universe chapter
[53:50] five he establishes Jesus as the new
[53:52] high priest and he explains the New
[53:54] Order of mzc Hebrews chapter 6 Paul is
[53:58] admonishing us to leave those former
[54:01] things and move on into Perfection we
[54:03] use Hebrews chapter 6 and we quote it
[54:05] for the New Testament Church but he's
[54:07] really not even talking of the New
[54:08] Testament Church as much as he is
[54:10] showing we need to leave those old
[54:12] things in the Old Testament
[54:14] right because he tells us baptisms
[54:18] resurrections of the Dead they had all
[54:20] of that in the Old Testament friends yes
[54:22] good John
[54:24] baptized praise the Lord yes many of
[54:27] them establish the the message as we
[54:29] would say that's right A lot of the
[54:31] things Paul is referring to in this
[54:33] sixth chapter he is talking he is still
[54:35] Bridging the Gap between the old and
[54:38] between the new oh God if you look at it
[54:40] right you can see it plain as day he's
[54:43] not even got to his main thought yet and
[54:46] yet they go back to verses 1 and two and
[54:48] Hebrews 1 and one and Hebrews 1 and two
[54:50] and say see there no more prophets well
[54:53] if you just keep reading through the
[54:54] next seven chapters you'll see that's
[54:56] not even idea at all that's right he's
[54:58] not even talking about thatl that's not
[55:00] even his subject that might be their
[55:01] subject but that's not Paul's that's
[55:03] right brother good wo come on now
[55:06] Hallelujah right he's establishing
[55:07] something completely different than what
[55:08] they're talking about look again he
[55:10] talks about leaving the former things
[55:12] moving into Perfection to Christ and to
[55:14] not become a borderline believer as they
[55:17] did back
[55:19] there in verse seven he is connecting
[55:22] the Old Testament priesthood with the
[55:24] New Testament priesthood under mesic now
[55:27] let's turn to Hebrews chapter 8 let's
[55:29] pick up about six verses there now Paul
[55:32] is coming in to the main idea everything
[55:35] he started in the very first verse now
[55:37] he's brought it to the Apex here he's
[55:40] been preaching for seven chapters now
[55:42] he's going to hit the secret of the
[55:43] message this is the thing he been
[55:45] holding in his heart he's been driving
[55:46] them building them up to get him and it
[55:48] puts me in mind amen when brother bam
[55:50] went down to Arkansas some years ago
[55:52] amen after he preaches I think it was
[55:54] the Third Exodus or perhaps he brings
[55:56] the thir Exodus after that amen he goes
[55:58] down amen into Hot Springs I think it
[56:00] was or Lon perhaps one of those amen and
[56:03] it was Sam Johnson one of our brothers
[56:05] right down there in Michigan amen who
[56:08] had I called him up one day I said Sam
[56:11] brother Braham said that he was down
[56:13] there in Arkansas trying to get them
[56:15] people out of that thing they were
[56:17] trying to get into I said Sam you were
[56:18] there that you were the campaign manager
[56:21] I said what was brother Bram trying to
[56:23] keep them people from you know what he
[56:24] told me he said brother br had that
[56:27] group of people down there that was
[56:29] Oneness of God true Oneness baptized
[56:32] correctly believe Holiness believed
[56:34] everything like we Believers believed he
[56:36] said but they were trying to organize
[56:37] and denominate that belief to protect it
[56:40] they said and brother Bram went down
[56:42] there to try to swing them out of that
[56:44] idea of organizing and you know what he
[56:46] done for three and four Services he
[56:48] preached and built them up for three or
[56:50] four days to the sign of the
[56:53] Messiah isn't that amazing that he's
[56:56] trying to keep them from organizing and
[56:58] he spends his entire Revival bringing
[57:01] them up to the point to where he's
[57:03] showing them the sign of the Messiah
[57:05] well why would he do that because we all
[57:08] know the sign of the Messiah and the
[57:10] prophet was a signpost not pointing
[57:13] backwards to denomination those ages had
[57:15] already run out but pointing them ahead
[57:19] to the new message of God the opening of
[57:21] the seven celles come on somebody help
[57:24] me right now he was pointing them ahead
[57:27] and he knew if you didn't couldn't see
[57:29] the sign you couldn't move on that's
[57:31] right brother but if they could see
[57:33] Jesus Christ Hallelujah standing there
[57:35] in human flesh again amen designing the
[57:38] very thoughts and intents of the heart
[57:39] as he did with Abraham and the rest of
[57:42] them he would say if he was standing
[57:44] right here in this business
[57:46] suit he said what would he say to us he
[57:49] said would he act exactly the same as he
[57:51] did then let's see if that same Jesus is
[57:54] here C the prayer L now sister you're
[57:57] not from here your name is so and so and
[57:58] you live it so and so you've got such
[58:01] and such disease now let's see if
[58:03] Abraham am man had the promise of God
[58:05] Elohim you see if that Elohim is still
[58:07] here and he turned his back and he said
[58:08] now you over here and you over there yes
[58:11] amen oh I know I know I know they say
[58:14] that technology was so powerful and so
[58:16] great back then they had a little system
[58:18] worked out where people could understand
[58:20] their names and he he had all that
[58:21] memorized isin't it amazing when it
[58:24] comes to discernment brother had a
[58:26] perfect memory when it comes to telling
[58:29] a story he didn't good brother good very
[58:32] good pot can't call Kettle greasy folks
[58:34] and a white man can't speak with a
[58:35] forked tongue said Mr Indian brother
[58:37] that's right that's right right either
[58:39] he had a bad memory or he
[58:41] didn't right but you're taking a prophet
[58:43] who did have a bad memory about things
[58:46] you say he didn't he said he did yes
[58:50] hallelujah oh oh oh we got quiet on that
[58:53] one well let's just throw a quote in
[58:54] there and support it and break it up but
[58:56] said now here I'm standing here he said
[58:58] I'm got getting to be an old man I can't
[59:00] remember things like I used
[59:03] to I think he said I may call the number
[59:06] wrong but he said I used to be able to
[59:07] remember 60 or 70 scriptures without
[59:08] opening my Bible he said now I got to
[59:10] write it all down he said if you'd see
[59:12] my notes a star passing over a bridge
[59:14] and things like that what was those
[59:16] notes for to help him
[59:19] remember
[59:22] Hallelujah right oh I know I know we're
[59:25] just giving B too much credit we're just
[59:27] giv I'm giving him all the same Grace
[59:29] I'd give to anybody
[59:30] else I give that to pastors I give that
[59:33] to evangelist teachers Apostles I give
[59:34] it to anybody a prophet whoever he might
[59:36] be I give it to lay people painters
[59:38] Farmers Factory workers Auto Workers I
[59:40] give it to everybody yes sir yes sir
[59:42] amen I don't care who they are or what
[59:44] your color is or what nation they come
[59:45] from or how tall or skinny or fat or
[59:48] ugly or pretty or what I don't care who
[59:49] they are amen I give everybody the
[59:51] credit and the benefit of the doubt that
[59:53] sometimes they just can't remember
[59:55] things yes Amen brother amen
[59:59] hallelujah amen oh my here's the beauty
[1:00:03] of it in questions and answers brother R
[1:00:06] is misquoting one of the scriptures in
[1:00:07] Revelation 5 and calling it
[1:00:09] wrong one of the old men he's dead now
[1:00:12] used to come by the house all the time
[1:00:13] fell about him anded Iverson brother BR
[1:00:16] said who who what's the matter
[1:00:17] somebody's sick everybody okay what's
[1:00:19] going on in here he said everybody right
[1:00:21] my so brother Ned holler read it again
[1:00:24] brother Bram oh the scripture the
[1:00:27] scripture oh I see now yes and brother
[1:00:29] ramman they put it in Capital H is which
[1:00:31] the only time Jeff lville should be
[1:00:32] putting in capitals on there like that
[1:00:35] his brother br's voice ain't the capital
[1:00:36] letter by the way his vocal cords is a
[1:00:39] small letter that was a son of man
[1:00:40] little a revealing the son of man that's
[1:00:43] the
[1:00:44] capital right we shouldn't capitalize
[1:00:46] brother bram's name and make some kind
[1:00:47] of big powerful thing out of it when he
[1:00:49] was just an instrument of God who would
[1:00:50] have quoted it
[1:00:52] wrong and a Nazarene told him to change
[1:00:54] it
[1:00:56] good brother good the scripture brother
[1:00:59] said he Capital H was so determined that
[1:01:02] I wouldn't miss
[1:01:05] that and that same prophet of God goes
[1:01:07] right on there preaching about 7,000 and
[1:01:09] calls it 700 six or seven different
[1:01:11] times in the very same paragraph and God
[1:01:13] never stopped him not one time you know
[1:01:16] why because people could understand what
[1:01:19] had happened we should afford to profit
[1:01:22] the same kind of Grace now as we did
[1:01:24] then Amen brother amen praise the Lord
[1:01:26] somebody same you should afford to your
[1:01:28] pastor well brother Jesse just don't
[1:01:31] understand that maybe he
[1:01:33] don't well he just don't get it maybe he
[1:01:36] don't that's right what's wrong with
[1:01:38] that last I check God doesn't use this
[1:01:41] most Superior genetic streamline to lead
[1:01:44] the
[1:01:44] bride believe me when I tell you I am
[1:01:47] the dumbest box of rocks you've ever
[1:01:48] seen in your entire life and if it
[1:01:50] wasn't for the grace of God I wouldn't
[1:01:52] have nothing to my name
[1:01:56] we don't lead because we're smart
[1:01:57] because we got a good memory because
[1:01:58] we're intelligent because we're
[1:01:59] charismatic we lead because we're led by
[1:02:01] the
[1:02:02] Lord that's right we make mistakes we do
[1:02:06] things
[1:02:07] wrong hello yes sir even you sir even
[1:02:11] the
[1:02:12] congregation it's easy for pastors and
[1:02:15] preachers alike to misunderstand their
[1:02:17] congregations I've had people stare a
[1:02:19] hole through me and I think that fell
[1:02:20] that woman she's disagreeing with every
[1:02:22] word to come my mouth come they're the
[1:02:24] only ones in the church was listening
[1:02:25] that night
[1:02:27] it's an easy thing to get in there and
[1:02:29] misunderstand that's why we have to look
[1:02:31] at one another Through The Eyes of
[1:02:34] Grace Grace of God grace is the cry
[1:02:38] Grace is the Cry of the Capstone Bride
[1:02:40] of the last
[1:02:41] day amen notice now Hebrews 81 let let
[1:02:45] let me hurry we're already past 12 now
[1:02:47] of the things which we have spoken this
[1:02:50] is the sum don't don't don't rush past
[1:02:53] that Linger on that a moment seven
[1:02:56] chapters Paul has been talking about
[1:02:59] things he comes to 81 and now he's going
[1:03:03] to sum up everything he's been talking
[1:03:05] about here's Paul's main idea starting
[1:03:09] at Hebrews 1 and
[1:03:11] one we have such a high priest who is
[1:03:14] set on the right hand of the Throne of
[1:03:16] the Majesty in the heavens what all kind
[1:03:18] of people you think he's talking
[1:03:20] to you think he'd preached this brand
[1:03:23] new to the
[1:03:24] Ephesians did he need to go to the
[1:03:25] Galatians and tell them you have a high
[1:03:27] priest no Paul was preaching this kind
[1:03:29] of stuff to the Galatians you are
[1:03:31] already sealed under the day of your
[1:03:33] Redemption amen Ephesians chapter 1
[1:03:37] after you heard the word of Truth you
[1:03:39] he's talking to them you were sealed by
[1:03:42] that Holy Spirit of Promise the message
[1:03:44] was direct that they were already in but
[1:03:46] this Hebrews group
[1:03:48] wasn't he is evangelizing to people who
[1:03:52] don't know Christ and don't understand
[1:03:54] the mystery of the day they're living in

[1:04:00] showing plainly you don't know what hour
[1:04:03] you're living in so I'm going to show

[1:04:08] of everything I've been saying as a Jew
[1:04:11] as a Hebrew you already know God in
[1:04:13] sunry times and diverse manners spake to
[1:04:16] us but now he's speaking
[1:04:20] differently this is I'm again I'm going
[1:04:22] to say it again and again and again to
[1:04:24] get the point down and nail it down hard
[1:04:25] heart this is not a declaration of the
[1:04:28] end the the ending of the prophetic
[1:04:31] offices God didn't turn around and say
[1:04:33] I'm going to do away all the prophets he
[1:04:34] turned around and gave
[1:04:36] them not only am I going to give you
[1:04:38] prophets but I'm going to give you
[1:04:39] Shepherds after my own heart too and
[1:04:42] evangelist set on fire as a fire breath
[1:04:44] and teachers to establish the truth

[1:04:55] tree all that other is plural until he
[1:04:57] comes
[1:04:59] there cuz there's only one Ministry that
[1:05:02] we're looking at that's that ministry
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:05] there the ministry of Jesus Christ I
[1:05:08] have only been given a borrowed gift
[1:05:13] right yes sir this gift is not mine I
[1:05:17] don't own it I'm responsible for it I'm
[1:05:21] responsible for its use for its
[1:05:22] Effectiveness and for what I do with
[1:05:24] this gift but it's not mine Hallelujah
[1:05:28] he gave me a portion of his own Ministry
[1:05:32] for the work and the edification of the
[1:05:34] saints of God the body of Christ praise
[1:05:37] the Lord so you can be people walking
[1:05:39] around my Ministry my church and my
[1:05:41] sheep they're as ignorant as dumb as
[1:05:43] they can be spiritually speaking yes sir
[1:05:45] they're foolish when it comes to
[1:05:46] understanding the things of God this is
[1:05:47] not your church these are not your sheep
[1:05:49] it's not your ministry if God called you
[1:05:51] at all it's God's Ministry he just let
[1:05:54] you partake in his gift amen hallelujah
[1:05:56] amen amen that goes for singing or
[1:05:59] anything else no matter what that
[1:06:00] gifting is God gave it he shared it with
[1:06:03] you to be a blessing to the body of
[1:06:05] Christ hallelujah amen it's not your
[1:06:07] gift it's God's Gift given to you
[1:06:10] hallelujah thank you
[1:06:12] Jesus look verse two a minister of the
[1:06:17] sanctuary I love that this word a public
[1:06:22] Minister a servant of the state one
[1:06:24] busied with holy things oh I love that
[1:06:28] so Paul now is telling us that Jesus our
[1:06:32] high
[1:06:32] priest is busied with holy
[1:06:36] things for all y'all that might have had
[1:06:38] yourself picturing Jesus sitting up on a
[1:06:40] box somewh another doing nothing but
[1:06:42] just kind of taking it easy with his
[1:06:43] feet kicked up just forgiving a few sins
[1:06:45] every now and then you don't realize how
[1:06:47] hard Jesus works every single day he
[1:06:49] might have rested on the seventh day but
[1:06:51] he's busy
[1:06:53] otherwise he might have retired from the
[1:06:56] job of making the worlds and the
[1:06:57] dimensions and those things but he's
[1:06:58] like every other retiree he just don't
[1:07:00] sit around lay around do nothing he goes
[1:07:02] to work in other places woo thank you
[1:07:05] Jesus and he's been doing that for 6,000
[1:07:07] years amen he rested on the seventh day
[1:07:09] and HED it and called it holy and then
[1:07:11] started busying himself amen with
[1:07:14] mankind he still feed
[1:07:16] sparrows yes so if he's still feeding
[1:07:18] sparrows I know he's still listening
[1:07:20] he's still watching he's still hovering
[1:07:22] he's still protecting he's still
[1:07:24] brooding Oh Glory to God God he buses
[1:07:27] himself as a
[1:07:29] minister of holy things beauti amen I'm
[1:07:35] so glad to be a part of the family of
[1:07:38] God and of the true Tabernacle which the
[1:07:41] Lord pitched and not man for every high
[1:07:44] priest is ordained to offer gifts and
[1:07:46] sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity
[1:07:50] that this man have somewhat also to
[1:07:53] offer now what does it sign like this
[1:07:56] does not sound like a man that is
[1:07:57] preaching to save people this is a man
[1:08:00] preaching to Jews this is a man
[1:08:02] preaching to those steeped and stooped
[1:08:04] in Judaism and they are so deep in it
[1:08:06] that they don't see what God's done in
[1:08:08] that
[1:08:09] generation and Paul is introducing to
[1:08:11] him what God's done the same as you I
[1:08:14] would find some old Baptist or Methodist
[1:08:16] or a presbyterian some old fell out
[1:08:17] there am man or some woman or something
[1:08:19] that's been a a Methodist or whatever
[1:08:20] they had their whole life hey hey man
[1:08:24] hey you heard what God done in this last
[1:08:26] day the promise of Malachi 4 the promise
[1:08:30] of Luke 17 the promise of Revelation 10
[1:08:33] God in this last generation this last
[1:08:35] day oh I know I know buddy God in Sury
[1:08:39] times and diverse manners spake in that
[1:08:41] church of yours and some of those
[1:08:42] forefathers you had but in the last days
[1:08:44] God's taken a man in this day to speak
[1:08:47] to us the things of God and restore the
[1:08:49] original faith of the fathers that's
[1:08:51] exactly what Paul is doing he's
[1:08:52] witnessing to these people the same as
[1:08:54] we be witnessing to somebody else about
[1:08:55] our
[1:08:56] generation amen oh I love it for if he
[1:09:00] were on Earth he should not be a priest
[1:09:02] seeing the priest that offer gifts are
[1:09:03] according to the
[1:09:05] law so Jesus wasn't a law a priest
[1:09:07] according to the law how could you come
[1:09:10] from the tribe of Arian when you are the
[1:09:11] tribe of
[1:09:14] Aaron hello somebody how can you be a
[1:09:17] levite when you are the levite where do
[1:09:20] you think they come
[1:09:21] from he's the main
[1:09:24] one Hallelujah
[1:09:26] he is the priest according to not the
[1:09:29] law but watch they served unto the
[1:09:32] example of a Shadow and Shadow of
[1:09:34] heavenly things as Moses was admonished
[1:09:36] of God when he was about to make the
[1:09:37] Tabernacle see saith he that they'll
[1:09:40] make all things according to the pattern
[1:09:42] showed to thee in the mount but now turn
[1:09:45] to Christ now he hath obtained
[1:09:48] what a more excellent
[1:09:50] Ministry by much also he is the mediator
[1:09:54] of a what
[1:09:56] better Covenant which was established
[1:09:58] upon what better
[1:10:01] promises now this does not sound to me
[1:10:03] like a man who is talking to Born Again
[1:10:05] believers who are following Jesus Christ
[1:10:07] and preaching the gospel and
[1:10:08] establishing
[1:10:09] churches God and Sury times and divers
[1:10:12] manners but now have spoken to us by his
[1:10:15] son I see there no more
[1:10:17] prophets when you look at it through the
[1:10:20] whole seven chapters up to this eth
[1:10:23] chapter right here you can see it does
[1:10:24] not even in the subject
[1:10:26] matter that wasn't even Paul's thought
[1:10:29] Paul's not even looking at in that
[1:10:30] direction he's not even studying in that
[1:10:32] direction that's not his purpose his
[1:10:33] intent or his main idea every author has
[1:10:36] a purpose behind their writing and if
[1:10:39] you know the author's purpose you know
[1:10:40] what he's writing about and remember I
[1:10:42] learned this in college when I was first
[1:10:44] learning how to write and speak and be a
[1:10:46] smart guy which I'm still not there but
[1:10:48] I got a paper that says I'm supposed to
[1:10:49] be but I
[1:10:51] ain't but I learned the first thing you
[1:10:53] need to know is you need to know your
[1:10:54] audience
[1:10:57] for example there's some of our Saints
[1:10:58] in here that their their motherland is
[1:11:00] not America you come from GH or these
[1:11:02] other places like that so if I had a
[1:11:05] whole church full of Gins believe me
[1:11:07] when I tell you I spoke to over 5,000 of
[1:11:10] them at a time I don't go under those
[1:11:12] churches like that and use all of the
[1:11:13] American terms and slangs and idioms and
[1:11:16] jargons when I'm driving up and down the
[1:11:18] street and and brothers are packing me
[1:11:20] around I'm looking at the Billboards I'm
[1:11:21] looking at the at the at the the stores
[1:11:24] I'm looking at people how they dress and
[1:11:26] I'm going to find some way to be able to
[1:11:28] identify something in Gana with my
[1:11:31] message try to be a man to all men as
[1:11:33] Paul said and I'm going to preach along
[1:11:36] that way and I'm going to say things
[1:11:38] along that way so that's where I started
[1:11:40] developing I I've done it just as a
[1:11:42] little funny thing amen not as a fun
[1:11:44] making thing to make fun but it's just a
[1:11:46] little silly thing amen just kind of
[1:11:48] expressing my own love for the African
[1:11:49] people but I would be preaching to them
[1:11:52] and I'd hit a little point and I go ah
[1:11:54] and every one of them they know what I
[1:11:55] was talking
[1:11:56] about cuz them African Saints hit that
[1:12:01] little and I love I get done I hear them
[1:12:04] brothers they come around they say now
[1:12:05] look at there that's one reason we love
[1:12:07] brother Ben he speaks like
[1:12:09] us well I meant to because I want to be
[1:12:13] able to relate the gospel of what I know
[1:12:15] and relate it in a way that they can
[1:12:17] feel the most home with it it's the most
[1:12:19] effective that way amen and I may not
[1:12:23] hit every custom and culture just
[1:12:24] exactly that way but I'm going to preach
[1:12:27] the gospel and present it in the best
[1:12:28] way I humanly know and here's Paul is a
[1:12:32] Jew who knows his own Hebrew people and
[1:12:36] he is presenting it to them in the
[1:12:38] language they
[1:12:39] understand this whole book of Hebrews is
[1:12:43] Paul dealing with his own kind the
[1:12:45] Ephesians wasn't his own the Galatians
[1:12:48] wasn't his own many of those were
[1:12:50] Gentiles that had come into the truth
[1:12:52] through the preaching of the Gospel many
[1:12:54] of those Gentile people had come in
[1:12:56] under the truth of Paul's message
[1:12:58] hearing maybe Peter or or or bolom or
[1:13:02] some of the other ones preach Thomas or
[1:13:03] whoever it might have been they heard
[1:13:05] the gospel preach and came in as
[1:13:07] Gentiles but now Paul is talking to his
[1:13:09] own right so now Paul might have done a
[1:13:12] little every now and
[1:13:15] then right he's relating the message oh
[1:13:19] can you see it friends can you
[1:13:20] understand it he's talking to his own
[1:13:22] kind he knows that they cannot see that
[1:13:26] gap between the prophets and
[1:13:28] Jesus so where does he start at the very
[1:13:31] place he needs to God in sunry times and
[1:13:34] divers
[1:13:35] manners it's like any Jew that believes
[1:13:38] their prophet he knows better than to
[1:13:40] walk out there and present them a letter
[1:13:42] that discredits The Messengers that came
[1:13:44] before him that's right he knows better
[1:13:46] than to present the Gospel of Jesus
[1:13:48] Christ without acknowledging the ones
[1:13:50] that brought the truth in the first
[1:13:52] place Hallelujah
[1:13:55] very good so he spoke unto our
[1:13:58] fathers by the
[1:14:01] prophets I love that man's boldness but
[1:14:04] now in the last
[1:14:07] days woo said hold back a little bit
[1:14:09] Paul give him a little bit more Runway
[1:14:10] said you kidding these are my people I
[1:14:12] know them I'm just hitting them with a
[1:14:13] blood
[1:14:14] Hammer yes sir I give them one verse to
[1:14:17] get warmed up here we
[1:14:18] [Laughter]
[1:14:20] go
[1:14:23] Glory that's how God deals with all of
[1:14:25] us in the way that we think the way
[1:14:26] we're made up Amen in every culture God
[1:14:29] will deal with them in that certain way
[1:14:31] to help them understand what is truth
[1:14:33] all right let's go a little bit further
[1:14:34] let's quit now in Exodus chapter 25: 8-9
[1:14:38] this is where he tells them to make a
[1:14:40] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[1:14:44] according to all that I show this is
[1:14:46] what Paul was quoting from after the
[1:14:47] pattern of the Tabernacle the pattern of
[1:14:49] the instruments thereof even so shall ye
[1:14:53] make it so if we're talking about amen
[1:14:57] living in this true Tabernacle now Paul
[1:15:00] is going to spend the rest of the time
[1:15:02] dealing with how we get
[1:15:04] there now you and I we don't have to
[1:15:06] take that Journey this morning or
[1:15:08] tonight but suffice it to say that when
[1:15:10] we start coming in just look at this I'm
[1:15:13] just going to pick up one in Hebrews
[1:15:14] chapter 10 verse one the law having a
[1:15:16] shadow of good things to come not the
[1:15:18] very image can never with those
[1:15:20] sacrifices they offered year by year
[1:15:22] make the CER there unto perfect for the
[1:15:25] worshipper once purged should have no
[1:15:28] more conscience of sin that's right do
[1:15:30] you understand folks he's not talking to
[1:15:32] Believers yet they're potential
[1:15:35] Believers they're still living outside
[1:15:38] they haven't come into Christ yet still
[1:15:41] in the 10th chapter he's still trying to
[1:15:42] show them how to achieve true for oh my
[1:15:45] God
[1:15:48] hallelujah why couldn't he just say to
[1:15:50] them well you believe the message of
[1:15:51] prophets are already saved cuz they
[1:15:53] wasn't
[1:15:55] they might have been Justified and
[1:15:56] Sanctified under the
[1:15:59] law but the Tabernacle was now rent in
[1:16:02] Twain and the earthquake that happened
[1:16:04] at Mount Calvary they say the temple was
[1:16:07] right below Calvary and when the
[1:16:08] earthquake Struck it it took the temple
[1:16:10] and rattled it right in half until the
[1:16:12] veil of the temple was completely ripped
[1:16:14] in
[1:16:15] half God showing that the priesthood was
[1:16:17] changing because you remember unless a
[1:16:20] priest died or somehow if he would take
[1:16:23] and there was a symbol that he would use
[1:16:25] take His Garment by the collar and rip
[1:16:27] it in half and it was a strong collar
[1:16:29] WRA time many many times over and the
[1:16:31] think of the anger that cus had when he
[1:16:33] grabbed his collar and rent it like that
[1:16:35] be like like some of these super guys
[1:16:37] amen these big powerful bodybuilders
[1:16:39] ripping a phone book in half that's how
[1:16:41] mad Jesus made him and with all that
[1:16:43] demon power hiding in cesis that little
[1:16:45] backslid message believer anyways he had
[1:16:48] enough power to take that car and rip it
[1:16:49] in half you know how to shine that there
[1:16:51] was a new priesthood coming in
[1:16:55] yes woo that the old Tabernacle was gone
[1:16:58] away and a new priest would take over in
[1:17:01] a new
[1:17:02] Tabernacle and Not only would he forgive
[1:17:04] us of our sins once a year but he'd
[1:17:06] forgive us forever past present and
[1:17:11] future that's why when I'm in trouble I
[1:17:13] go to the blood when I'm hopeless I go
[1:17:15] to the blood when I'm sick I go to the
[1:17:18] blood when I need Joy I go to the
[1:17:21] blood and the blood is the power thereof
[1:17:24] the life thereof Hallelujah that's how I
[1:17:28] receive the Holy Ghost the breaking of
[1:17:29] that blood cell the breaking of the
[1:17:31] promise of
[1:17:32] God and down upon my heart comes the
[1:17:36] baptism of the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost all the way Plum over you just
[1:17:40] keep on turning he's all the way over
[1:17:42] here into chapter 11 faith is the
[1:17:44] substance of things not seen he spends
[1:17:47] an entire chapter reviewing to them why
[1:17:49] their brothers and their fathers and
[1:17:51] their people done what they've done
[1:17:54] well it's a good thing to do don't
[1:17:56] discredit the Believers before you like
[1:17:58] some of us message people do right throw
[1:18:01] off on Pentecostals and throw off on
[1:18:02] these people somebody come from a
[1:18:04] denomination throw you don't know
[1:18:06] anything in that old Baptist church or
[1:18:07] you don't don't you say that to them
[1:18:09] Faith LED them somewhere it may have
[1:18:12] only LED them to salvation but Faith LED
[1:18:14] them somewhere amen I'm acquainted with
[1:18:16] a a brother he's a message believer to
[1:18:18] this day he's not a preacher or nothing
[1:18:19] like that but got saved in Billy
[1:18:21] Graham's
[1:18:22] meeting and it preachers right say billy
[1:18:25] goat Graham and he was just an
[1:18:26] unbeliever an impostor shame on him
[1:18:29] everybody gets a start somewhere don't
[1:18:30] get quiet on me come on everybody gets a
[1:18:34] start
[1:18:35] somewhere their faith took them through
[1:18:38] this Hall of Fame just like that Faith
[1:18:40] may have led them to a Baptist Church
[1:18:41] and if they're True Believers that faith
[1:18:43] will lead them right through that system
[1:18:44] right into something else right into
[1:18:45] something else because once Jesus starts
[1:18:47] leading you you don't always have to be
[1:18:49] right in Canaan land to be led by the
[1:18:50] Holy Ghost you can still be in the
[1:18:53] wilderness and sanctification and the
[1:18:54] Journey you could still be following
[1:18:55] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost man
[1:18:57] of Fallen daily and not having nothing
[1:18:59] in your soul you can still go through
[1:19:01] every stage of the journey yes sir and
[1:19:03] God still be leading
[1:19:07] you
[1:19:12] Hallelujah he comes all the way up now
[1:19:15] in Hebrews chapter 12 now he's
[1:19:17] established and we have are compassed
[1:19:19] about with a great cloud of
[1:19:21] witnesses following peace chapter 13 let
[1:19:24] Brotherly Love
[1:19:27] continue oh
[1:19:29] my and he finishes out Grace be with you
[1:19:32] all amen salute all of them that have
[1:19:34] rule over you and all the saints in
[1:19:39] Italy Salute You Grace be with you all
[1:19:40] he's finishing the letter around by
[1:19:43] bringing them into true
[1:19:45] Christianity for you that are born again
[1:19:48] he's establishing the people in the
[1:19:49] faith he takes them from chapter one at
[1:19:52] the very very Foundation of it all by
[1:19:54] time he gets to the 13th chapter he
[1:19:56] finishes out with that amen that's the
[1:19:57] Capstone of everything he's been trying
[1:19:59] to
[1:20:00] bring so this book is not an indictment
[1:20:02] of prophetic offices this book of
[1:20:05] Hebrews is not an indictment of the
[1:20:06] prophetic it is a journey from when God
[1:20:09] spoke in the Old Testament to Jesus
[1:20:11] being established in the new to what
[1:20:13] God's going to do all the way through it
[1:20:15] because don't forget it's in that 13th
[1:20:17] chapter somewhere around verse 8 where
[1:20:19] he said Jesus Christ is the
[1:20:22] same Hallelujah
[1:20:28] praise the
[1:20:30] Lord amen God
[1:20:33] establishing the entire
[1:20:37] gospel in this book of
[1:20:40] Hebrews let's
[1:20:43] stand let's
[1:20:46] stand praise be to
[1:20:49] God let's bow our heads together
[1:20:55] Lord Jesus we so thank you
[1:20:57] today how powerful how Mighty and how
[1:21:00] wonderful is your word and your
[1:21:03] truth
[1:21:06] Lord people may want to make fun of us
[1:21:08] for this truth and for what we
[1:21:12] believe you know Lord as far as my
[1:21:15] heart's concerned that's up to
[1:21:18] them never do I want to come to a
[1:21:21] place to where I feel like that Within
[1:21:24] Myself
[1:21:27] that I know
[1:21:29] everything I've read this book of
[1:21:31] Hebrews so many different times in my
[1:21:34] service to
[1:21:36] you and yet Lord just the other day you
[1:21:38] opened it up to me to see different
[1:21:40] things that i' never seen before that's
[1:21:42] what I love about your word Lord no
[1:21:45] matter what's being said or how we read
[1:21:47] it it's an eternal thing that just keeps
[1:21:51] opening opening opening and opening take
[1:21:54] the dictionary and do that it won't read
[1:21:56] the encyclopedia it had does have that
[1:21:58] power but every word of God establishes
[1:22:01] a new truth in there
[1:22:03] somewhere whatever angle you show us
[1:22:05] whatever Direction you take us it shows
[1:22:08] us what is right and what is true and
[1:22:10] Lord we thank you so much for unfolding
[1:22:14] this little part of this today I believe
[1:22:16] it's a help Lord and for whatever reason
[1:22:19] Lord I felt just compelled by you to
[1:22:22] preach it like I've been preaching it
[1:22:25] maybe dealing with that critical side of
[1:22:27] these
[1:22:28] things and Lord I know somebody might
[1:22:30] get it try to use it against me or try
[1:22:32] to make me look bad but Lord I I don't
[1:22:35] mean it like I'm coming up here for the
[1:22:37] purpose of
[1:22:38] attacking but Lord in my heart I really
[1:22:41] wish some of these people could see it
[1:22:43] in a better
[1:22:44] way I know how other folks have been
[1:22:46] damaged by these things in the world and
[1:22:49] denominations have discredited prophetic
[1:22:51] offices even if you turned on TV BN or
[1:22:55] some religious station or you got on
[1:22:57] serus or one of these satellite programs
[1:23:01] some internet
[1:23:03] station if the subject of a prophet of
[1:23:05] God comes up they're either going to be
[1:23:08] for it but some ridiculous version of it
[1:23:11] or they're going to be completely
[1:23:12] against
[1:23:14] it and Lord we know that counterfeits
[1:23:16] are always
[1:23:18] sent before the true
[1:23:20] arrives and there's been Elijah's coats
[1:23:23] Elijah's manels and all of those things
[1:23:25] that come to this
[1:23:26] day even the very man that established
[1:23:29] the Jehovah Witness got a same got the
[1:23:32] same pyramid
[1:23:33] Capstone called himself the seventh
[1:23:36] angel said the seals would come open
[1:23:38] Lord It's not that what they said was
[1:23:40] wrong all of them were falling under the
[1:23:43] anointing of the
[1:23:44] hour probing and probing and probing but
[1:23:48] the problem is they didn't have the call
[1:23:51] or the prophetic office or the min
[1:23:54] Ministry prophesied to tie together
[1:23:57] every one of those loose ends so for
[1:24:00] Generations they probed at it Lin had
[1:24:03] some things right he was a very
[1:24:04] spiritual man in many ways same Lin was
[1:24:07] a trinitarian some of the very same
[1:24:09] simple things that brother brenon pulled
[1:24:11] out of his truth he didn't go along with
[1:24:14] the second person of a
[1:24:16] godhead do we turn around and say about
[1:24:19] to hust and these guys Lord that that
[1:24:22] these men that the bride is the h
[1:24:25] 44,000 and were saved by regeneration of
[1:24:28] the
[1:24:29] water lord every one of these people
[1:24:31] probed it what's
[1:24:33] true but without a messenger of God in
[1:24:36] the last day to tie it together and take
[1:24:38] truth from here and here and here and
[1:24:40] here we wouldn't understand what the
[1:24:42] full truth of the whole thing is many
[1:24:46] were working a puzzle as it were but not
[1:24:49] many could put it together by the
[1:24:50] spiritual discernment of the holy spirit
[1:24:53] so father thank thank you for brother
[1:24:55] Brenham thank you for this message yes
[1:24:58] Hallelujah I would never be bold enough
[1:25:00] to call him a liar I'd never be bold
[1:25:02] enough to say that he was wrong even
[1:25:05] though I know there's many times that he
[1:25:07] missed things and misunderstood it but
[1:25:09] that doesn't make him completely wrong
[1:25:10] if it does then I'm in a mess cuz Lord
[1:25:13] there been many times my Revelation has
[1:25:15] developed and changed and I I've evolved
[1:25:18] over the years from what I believ 20
[1:25:19] years ago 10 years ago I've seen
[1:25:22] different truths
[1:25:24] Lord we preach what we get when we get
[1:25:26] it we try our best to deliver to the
[1:25:30] people and Lord if they can see it they
[1:25:32] can see it if they can't they
[1:25:34] can't but
[1:25:35] Lord would you be kind enough to not
[1:25:39] only Open the Eyes of those that are
[1:25:41] sitting here today to what I've preached
[1:25:44] but Lord in your sweetness will you go
[1:25:46] to those critics out there with all
[1:25:47] their websites and all their materials
[1:25:50] and all their
[1:25:51] things cuz Lord I know there's been an
[1:25:53] attack against this little church but
[1:25:55] Lord I don't speak ill of them I don't
[1:25:57] speak meanness to them not not this
[1:25:59] point I'm not saying a mean thing to
[1:26:01] them I'm praying Lord
[1:26:04] that like you said that you would open
[1:26:07] their eyes that they could see what's
[1:26:10] right for Lord every one of us visible
[1:26:13] and invisible we've been hurt by things
[1:26:15] in the world we've been offended by
[1:26:17] people in the
[1:26:19] message folks say things to us we hear
[1:26:22] things going around and some people
[1:26:24] they've sheltered themselves away from
[1:26:25] it and almost get scared to hear
[1:26:27] anything and that's not wise either Lord
[1:26:30] we have to open our eyes and our ears to
[1:26:32] understand the day and the time we're
[1:26:34] living The Good the Bad and the
[1:26:36] Ugly and Lord we need to have an answer
[1:26:38] for the hope that lays within us so
[1:26:41] father at the end of this message the
[1:26:43] best that I can do to try to show the
[1:26:45] people and establish us as Christian
[1:26:47] Believers in this one little thought
[1:26:50] that you never indicted prophetic
[1:26:53] offices for this day Hallelujah but Lord
[1:26:55] you established them through the
[1:26:56] ministry of Paul and now as you gave
[1:27:00] gifts unto men now there is an order of
[1:27:02] the church which if you're willing in a
[1:27:03] few hours time we'll come right back
[1:27:05] here to this church I'll come to this
[1:27:07] platform we'll pick it right back up in
[1:27:08] Corinthians and go to show that divine
[1:27:11] order of the believing Church of God if
[1:27:13] it Be Your Will that you'd let that be
[1:27:16] just that way I pray you'll meet us back
[1:27:18] here at this platform Lord and anoint
[1:27:20] the people open our hearts to be able to
[1:27:22] receive it and understand why we come to
[1:27:24] church what the benefit of being in
[1:27:26] church was and why we need Ministry and
[1:27:29] why we need the gifts of the Spirit why
[1:27:30] we need the workings of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:32] if it be thy will bring us back at this
[1:27:35] appointed time and season as we ask it
[1:27:38] for your grace and Your
[1:27:40] Glory by your grace and For Your Glory
[1:27:44] in Jesus
[1:27:46] name amen and

[1:28:20] prophet of Mali

[1:31:12] well I want to sing this for he us
[1:31:16] Believers and for the critics as well
[1:31:19] now listen I keep saying this like I'm
[1:31:21] saying it because this is the way the
[1:31:22] Holy Spirit told me to approach this
[1:31:23] this morning but Jesse I ain't got no
[1:31:25] idea why I'm doing it this way just the
[1:31:26] Lord put it in my mouth just this way I
[1:31:29] don't even know what's been going on up
[1:31:30] this way but I can tell you this much I
[1:31:32] know what Jesus told me to do so I want
[1:31:35] to sing it like this to you as Believers
[1:31:37] and to the critics as well now things
[1:31:41] have not worked out the way God's people
[1:31:47] thought for we're still here fighting
[1:31:53] the the greatest battle ever
[1:31:58] fought but we must have the faith of
[1:32:05] Abraham knowing God's word never fails
[1:32:10] that if we'll trust in him here a Critic
[1:32:14] it don't matter you'll find that all is

[1:32:55] rest for all is
[1:32:58] well B you hands with me just a moment
[1:33:00] as they play softly
[1:33:02] now I wonder if somebody here this
[1:33:05] morning or even tonight whenever they
[1:33:08] might hear this
[1:33:09] message perhaps you're even a Critic of
[1:33:12] the truth but maybe something you might
[1:33:14] be a Critic in here this morning I don't
[1:33:17] know but perhaps something in your heart
[1:33:19] has resonated with the little truth that
[1:33:21] I've tried to bring you I don't know it
[1:33:24] all and I don't try to be a know- it-
[1:33:26] all if I am God forgive
[1:33:29] me but maybe something inside of you
[1:33:31] maybe you've even been wavering about
[1:33:33] what is
[1:33:34] right maybe you're sitting here
[1:33:37] listening on the internet and you're a
[1:33:38] Critic truly but God's been dealing with
[1:33:41] you to look at things in a different
[1:33:43] way maybe you would see the holy
[1:33:45] spirit's calling to you to change your
[1:33:48] mindset maybe the Lord's trying to show
[1:33:51] some of you people that's listening to
[1:33:54] my voice maybe your way of approach has
[1:33:57] just been affected by the people you've
[1:33:59] hung
[1:34:00] around maybe them birds of a feather you
[1:34:03] shouldn't have been flocking together
[1:34:05] with anywhere there's a counterfeit
[1:34:07] there's got to be a real somewhere and
[1:34:10] maybe you're even a Critic you might
[1:34:11] have YouTube channels I don't care what
[1:34:13] you got but if you're here or abroad or
[1:34:15] wherever you might be and in your heart
[1:34:17] you know God's dealing with you to
[1:34:18] change your mind away from the things
[1:34:20] you've been following you want to be
[1:34:22] different I want you wherever you are
[1:34:25] here or wherever to raise your hand to
[1:34:26] the Lord and say Jesus according to what
[1:34:29] I believe you're dealing with me about
[1:34:31] and what brother Ben's been preaching
[1:34:33] about and what the holy spirit's been
[1:34:34] saying I feel I need to be different as
[1:34:37] of today this morning tonight wherever
[1:34:38] you may be won't you raise your hand up
[1:34:41] to the Lord at this moment and say god
[1:34:43] father forgive me Lord I followed the
[1:34:46] wrong influences and I want to be
[1:34:48] different I want to be changed show me
[1:34:50] what's true show me what's truth and
[1:34:53] what is right and I'll Follow You Lord
[1:34:56] and say it in Jesus Christ's name and
[1:34:58] mean it and watch and see if God won't
[1:35:00] visit you right where you're at but be
[1:35:02] weary take heed it may be your last
[1:35:04] opportunity last call that God ever deal
[1:35:06] with you so don't take it lightly don't
[1:35:08] take it lightly don't lay that down
[1:35:10] lightly say Lord here I am whatever you
[1:35:13] want to do with me don't throw me away
[1:35:15] but remold my clay remake me shape me
[1:35:18] again in a new image take away all of my
[1:35:21] hurts and my ills and my fears these
[1:35:23] Spooks and specters that surround these
[1:35:25] truths and these words of people help me
[1:35:28] not to look to websites into men leaning
[1:35:31] to their arms of own understanding but
[1:35:33] help me look to the word of God the Holy
[1:35:35] Spirit and to a prayer life to lay
[1:35:37] before your word ask you to show me
[1:35:39] what's true and to lay there until you
[1:35:41] fill me with the Holy Ghost and solve
[1:35:42] the sin question of my heart and life
[1:35:45] Grant it Lord in Jesus name if there be
[1:35:47] anybody in the sound of my voice lost
[1:35:49] don't know Jesus as their savior you
[1:35:51] want to get saved tonight this morning
[1:35:53] morning whenever you hear this if you're
[1:35:55] in this building this morning same to
[1:35:57] you as it would be to anybody else you

[1:36:09] you the Father in Heaven who knows all
[1:36:12] things sees every hand every life every
[1:36:15] heart maybe he's just trying to attack a
[1:36:18] spirit this morning that might be
[1:36:19] working on maybe your mind who knows but
[1:36:22] don't let that word depart from your
[1:36:25] heart hide it deep within your heart
[1:36:29] child don't let go of the things you
[1:36:32] know that are pure and right leaning to
[1:36:34] the arm of one's understanding for David
[1:36:37] said he that leans to the arm of flesh
[1:36:39] is cursed
[1:36:40] already Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood
[1:36:44] didn't reveal this but my Father which
[1:36:46] is in
[1:36:48] heaven he opens a door no man can open
[1:36:50] and shuts one no man can shut he is the
[1:36:53] GI of Revelation and life alone he is

[1:37:20] name and I ask it in the name of the
[1:37:21] Lord Jesus Christ and him crucified and
[1:37:25] resurrected on the third
[1:37:26] day in Jesus Christ's name hallelujah
[1:37:31] how many you just believe with me for
[1:37:32] all things once you raise your hand up
[1:37:34] to the Lord let's give him praise for it
[1:37:35] right now somehow God's been
[1:37:37] supernaturally dealing with people I'm
[1:37:40] telling you that right now all these
[1:37:41] years I've been preaching I can't think
[1:37:43] of a time even since we had the first
[1:37:46] defections in this message I can't think
[1:37:48] of a time I've seen the Holy Spirit go
[1:37:50] into it like this brother Jesse not my
[1:37:52] intention to take the directions I hope
[1:37:55] people hear and everywhere I hope you're
[1:37:57] listening hope you're opening your heart
[1:37:59] to the Holy Spirit and say Lord Teach Me
[1:38:01] Guide Me show me what's right show me
[1:38:03] what's truth and if you want to know a
[1:38:05] greater portion of this I challenge you
[1:38:07] here and abroad come back into the
[1:38:09] message tonight sit down at my feet a
[1:38:11] little while and let me teach you what
[1:38:12] the Church of the Living God looks like
[1:38:14] amen because I promise you as a minister
[1:38:18] I only mean it for your good and for
[1:38:19] your benefit Hallelujah he is a minister
[1:38:22] unto thee for good
[1:38:24] and not for
[1:38:25] evil May the Holy Spirit bless us now as
[1:38:28] we give him thanks for all he's done for
[1:38:30] all things for all things and whatever
[1:38:34] need you might have this morning if you
[1:38:36] want you like to come be prayed for I'm
[1:38:38] going to turn it back to brother Jesse
[1:38:39] let him lead the service out you come
[1:38:41] right over here to the side I'll come
[1:38:43] pray for you if you have a
[1:38:45] need you know I I'm the world's worst
[1:38:49] about the anointing oil part of it it's
[1:38:51] not that I don't believe in it but
[1:38:53] brother B said when you had certain
[1:38:54] kinds of gifts he said you know the oil
[1:38:56] you put it on the person the oil he said
[1:38:58] is there to protect you from that Spirit
[1:39:00] that's on that person me a sickness or
[1:39:02] whatever it is he said but if there's a
[1:39:04] gift there like healing or faith or
[1:39:06] something like that he said that gift
[1:39:07] stands between you and that person so
[1:39:09] I've never been one for the oil but not
[1:39:11] that I won't use it if you want it you
[1:39:13] want to be anointed of oil for some
[1:39:14] reason hey that's all right brother
[1:39:16] Jesse's always standing ready I'm it
[1:39:18] ready we pray for you know where we can
[1:39:21] otherwise let's worship a little bit as
[1:39:23] our brother comes and we'll close out
[1:39:25] this morning saying it's been good to be
[1:39:28] in the house of the
[1:39:29] Lord can you say Amen to that it's been
[1:39:34] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:39:36] morning his presence has been so rich
[1:39:39] and so sweet and so deep this morning I
[1:39:43] just I've been a long time since I've
[1:39:46] seen him come to battle for lost souls
[1:39:48] like this morning that's what he was
[1:39:50] doing partly there's somebody on that
[1:39:51] camera out there that God's dealing with
[1:39:53] brother Jesse and I don't know what's
[1:39:55] been going on on your side of the world
[1:39:56] out here but God's dealing with somebody
[1:39:58] out there I'm telling you and I don't
[1:40:00] know maybe somebody in here has been
[1:40:01] affected by things if you have you
[1:40:03] listen to the voice of the holy spirit
[1:40:04] this morning let God deal with your
[1:40:07] heart because I can tell you right now
[1:40:09] looking at the Bible the way I see it
[1:40:11] the way that I believe it to be true
[1:40:13] there's no way that all of these other
[1:40:15] things could be right that we don't
[1:40:17] believe in church anymore people do away
[1:40:19] with paying
[1:40:20] ties how in the world can we even call
[1:40:23] oursel Believers if we're not willing to
[1:40:26] take a portion of our money and give it
[1:40:28] into the church I know there's been
[1:40:30] preachers turned into fat cats and
[1:40:32] driving Mercedes and living high on the
[1:40:35] hog I get that but I shop at Walmart and
[1:40:39] some of those fat cats sitting in their
[1:40:40] million dollars home do the same thing
[1:40:43] some of you will vote Democrat Michelle
[1:40:45] Obama talking the other night about how
[1:40:47] she' like to see things uh distributed
[1:40:49] to the poor in her $50 million worth of
[1:40:52] property that her and Barack live in I
[1:40:54] don't say they don't earn it and don't
[1:40:55] deserve it but let's look at the thing
[1:40:58] in the right way why would we take a
[1:41:00] tenth of our living and bring it to the
[1:41:02] church why why would we take our
[1:41:04] offerings and give them unto the Lord
[1:41:06] you know why we don't do it because we
[1:41:08] just don't understand the benefit of
[1:41:10] church anymore we've lost that Vision
[1:41:12] brother Jesse people I hear them all the
[1:41:15] time sick in their body and troubled and
[1:41:17] have a need they'll come to me after
[1:41:18] church I was going to go up there I
[1:41:20] thought maybe I should I wanted you to
[1:41:22] pray for me but but what what you come
[1:41:25] to church for that's right to come in
[1:41:27] with a burden and leave with a bigger
[1:41:29] one why do we come to the house of God
[1:41:31] so we can be relieved of the burdens
[1:41:33] that's within our body spirit and soul
[1:41:37] and to re receive to receive
[1:41:40] instruction in the things of God and how
[1:41:43] to be a better Christian how we might
[1:41:45] please him betterall right but you know
[1:41:48] in this day and age if you ain't got
[1:41:49] some big great charismatic Ministry and
[1:41:51] you're kicking the walls out of things
[1:41:52] and seeing angels
[1:41:55] and listen I'm a man that believes in
[1:41:58] the Supernatural I don't say this
[1:42:00] bragging but just to show you my words
[1:42:03] are powerful sometimes the way I present
[1:42:04] myself it sounds like I'm swinging One
[1:42:06] Direction but I believe in all these
[1:42:10] Supernatural things I've spoken tongues
[1:42:13] I've prophesied I've interpreted I've
[1:42:15] laid hands on the sick I've manifested
[1:42:17] every spiritual nine gift I've seen the
[1:42:19] love of God in my life to be able to
[1:42:21] look at men that I knew was going to
[1:42:23] going to kill me and love them just like
[1:42:24] brother BR Lov the bull and the bees
[1:42:27] I've I've felt the presence of angels of
[1:42:29] the Lord I've seen the pillar of fire a
[1:42:31] time or two in my life I've heard God's
[1:42:33] voice speak to me audibly right here in
[1:42:35] my heart I've seen the supernatural God
[1:42:38] do many many things in the 30 plus years
[1:42:40] that I've served him since a boy many
[1:42:43] years ago when I was a boy that cloud I
[1:42:45] told you the cloud put right on top of
[1:42:47] the trees I wasn't even saved yet I
[1:42:49] wasn't even full of the Holy Ghost yet I
[1:42:51] was out flying kites with my daddy and I
[1:42:53] was out there at 12 years old and my
[1:42:55] kite had taken a nose D brother Jesse
[1:42:56] and I went out there to go run and grab
[1:42:57] it I picked up the cord like this and
[1:42:59] went to turn and run so I could pull it
[1:43:01] up in the air and right on top of the
[1:43:02] trees and it was one of those blue sky
[1:43:04] Ohio days without a cloud in the sky and
[1:43:07] that seven angel cloud appeared right on
[1:43:08] top of the trees and I stood there and
[1:43:10] looked at it for 10 minutes long and I
[1:43:11] knew it wasn't no rocket ship smoke and
[1:43:13] I knew it wasn't some fig somebody's
[1:43:15] imagination cuz that picture hung on my
[1:43:17] pastor's wall in our church and I
[1:43:19] studied until I knew every little whip
[1:43:21] of the tail and right there it was in
[1:43:22] front of my eyes
[1:43:24] 40 years nearly I went down my life
[1:43:26] wondering why God let me see that until
[1:43:29] all of a sudden one of these boys got on
[1:43:31] the internet and started hitting against
[1:43:33] the cloud again this is an old debate
[1:43:35] anyways talking about it being fake and
[1:43:38] being false and how it wasn't true they
[1:43:41] you or anybody whoever you might be come
[1:43:43] too late to tell me such a thing yes I
[1:43:46] saw it with my very own eyes I know it
[1:43:48] to be the truth I was in Arizona some
[1:43:50] years ago and some of them that was
[1:43:52] living during that time time they walked
[1:43:54] right out on their porch and could see
[1:43:55] it standing right out in the air they
[1:43:57] didn't say it looked like a white cloud
[1:43:58] they said it looked iridescent at night
[1:44:01] all them seven colors of the rainbow
[1:44:03] sitting right up in that cloud a rocket
[1:44:05] don't hang in the air that long smoke
[1:44:08] don't hang in the air that long but God
[1:44:11] hides it from the eyes of the wise and
[1:44:13] prudent some time ago the critics put up
[1:44:16] a a picture of The Beatles and Ed
[1:44:18] Sullivan in the same Houston
[1:44:20] Coliseum it's a black and white photo
[1:44:23] with those lights above them and they
[1:44:24] had streaks above them the same as
[1:44:25] brother Brenham had above him one day
[1:44:28] that one troubled me I thought boyo how
[1:44:30] am I going to explain that one that's a
[1:44:32] toughy because they look exactly the
[1:44:34] same of course the argument is that
[1:44:36] George dayy had nothing to do with it
[1:44:38] well fine fine I'll go your way but the
[1:44:41] one problem I've got with their photos
[1:44:43] is they're not in color CU if you saw it
[1:44:46] in color you wouldn't see a pillar of
[1:44:47] fire black and white over brother bram's
[1:44:49] head you'd see this color above the
[1:44:52] Beatles but above brother Ram's Head
[1:44:54] would be an ambrish yellow green
[1:44:56] color see God hides it from the eyes of
[1:45:00] the wise and prudent and reveals it to
[1:45:02] babes such as would learn because all
[1:45:04] you got to do is put it in color baby
[1:45:05] and you can see what it
[1:45:07] is what I'm trying to say to you is
[1:45:10] there's no reason that we should walk
[1:45:12] out of this church this morning and have
[1:45:14] any doubts in whom we have already
[1:45:16] believed that's right that's right God
[1:45:18] didn't establish the truth and put this
[1:45:20] church here and send ministers around
[1:45:22] the world to establish the truth of this
[1:45:24] message just to let a bunch of people
[1:45:26] that didn't have the Holy Ghost tear it
[1:45:28] up a bunch of uneducated and illiterate
[1:45:32] people didn't know hardly how to write
[1:45:34] their name and God take them and shake
[1:45:35] the world with them and then a bunch of
[1:45:37] intellectuals come along the think
[1:45:39] because they got a bunch of newspaper
[1:45:40] clippings and talk to some guy that's
[1:45:42] got about as much recall about what he
[1:45:44] ate for supper 20 years ago as what he
[1:45:45] did in brother Bam's
[1:45:48] meeting
[1:45:50] hello we're leaning to the arm of Flesh
[1:45:53] in these matters when we should be
[1:45:55] leaning upon one
[1:45:57] thing the
[1:45:59] Bible this is my road map right here
[1:46:02] hallelujah so should I believe in
[1:46:05] prophets should I believe in a Ministry
[1:46:08] amen I'm glad y'all saying amen tonight
[1:46:10] would be a hard message for you if you
[1:46:11] couldn't say
[1:46:12] it I'm setting this up for tonight I
[1:46:14] want you to understand where we're
