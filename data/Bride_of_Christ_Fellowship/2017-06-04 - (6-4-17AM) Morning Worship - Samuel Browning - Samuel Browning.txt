that is without yes sir yes of me we simply don't have the stamina nor the patience for it doesn't matter how strongly there be any virtue even a person can do a lot of patience as a person that will not quake and as you're up to what God has called it really takes some more it takes godly patience yes on moving the north marks we just want to just give glory to the north and maybe G was awarded God I know every lead Oh friendship logistics we're throughout the years we just want to look into the word of a lawyer this morning before we maybe a turn there if we could just go in the morning morning prayer there's certainly happier this morning Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are just so privileged just to be able to come into your presence yes Father to know that Lord we believe ordained Lord for this time services Lord we just ask that you would help us because we realize that in every time that we are purpose more to come together Lord and seek after you know father that Lord that's when the enemy or also try to find all the different things the Lord that can arise whether to the physical body Lord in the spirit Lord the father we ask the more than as we come here more our desire Lord is that to present ourselves to you Lord God we ask the door that you would just have your way in our midst or father just reserved myself unto you Lord for the services Lord yes Father Lord that you would just guide the director Lord truly that means that are here Lord father to take you Lord to bring everything together one and we are certainly need people more as we ask that you would just move among us more than a special way it's speak to each and every one of our hearts Lord Lord we just ask that you would meet the needs or God that are here this morning we presented water ourselves to you Lord it would ask the Lord if our faith is not in the place where it needs to be father to be able to receive or what you have for us we have the Lord that you will move by more than move upon us Lord that father our faith might be equipped in more thought to that place Lord Jesus to be able to receive more than take hold upon that North God which you are desiring Lord God to move in our lives with more father we just ask them even just take a flea control now father we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ let's go to Exodus chapter 25 I could Exodus 20:5 we'll just read a few verses and let you be seated verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me in honor of every man that giveth me willingly with his heart he shall take my offer I don't want either a look at that there in the scripture God is already regarding it as his offering yes but it's his offering that must come from a willing heart in that so God is interesting things but those things must be surrendered willingly vnn so if we're going down to verse 8 and let them make me a sanctuary but I may dwell among them according to all that I showed me after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments their own even so shall you baby may God richly bless you this is where this morning you should be seated like you just take one one step forward here and just stop working with us this morning a little bit to see how the auto Texas model with my seat move so much that [Music] you know this is always been where there's always been people there are people all across the face of the earth your separate existence depends on luck people are dedicated amen and in order to become dedicate there has to be something that would strike a person's brother and will tell us even in the message perseverance he said there's a spirit that moves upon you and you are motivated by that spirit a mad verbal driving and set your ambition so then you begin to give to that and begin to move toward that and you know it's really not anything that is a great mystery when someone is dedicated to something it shows yes did you don't hear oh you have asked because it is really a theme of their life a man as a focus of their conversation yeah he audio CD action in their life you'll see to where things will be expended where people will expend great integration and make great sacrifices because of dedication and dedication itself is something that is not where for an individual doing it for a reward but it is simply because it is moved in their heart and they desire to do that amen I don't think any of the young people here you know you know jump for joy when it comes to sand you know God get to take out the trash no those are using things that even all of us that you have to say it's getting high let's guess I better take it out right now and right now those are not things that you look at it are overjoyed with but there are certain things that you like to do maybe certain hobbies and certain things and you know you can do it and nobody pays you for it you just enjoy doing and you're dedicated to it you'll read about it you enjoy looking at it finding out little little things you're there you willingly dedicated yes and then that is exactly what God Himself and so forth and ordained that our lives would be dedicated in that minute there's absolutely no way that we're able to do it and actually have the dedication that God desires just from our own human merits it takes gone to raise up what he has already placed within us and that's what we want to just begin to even look at because when you look at it across of what God is saying here within this portion of scriptures knowing that within God haven't spoke to them or to Moses here in this time this is when Moses has been caught up by the Lord and the Lord is speaking to Moses heart letting him know of all of these things within here the scripture says in verse eight let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them and well you know we would have a tendency to think sanctuary we're thinking of tabernacle but yet God differs between the tabernacle and the sanctuary the sanctuary is the innermost part of the tavern and here is what God's desire is that they would make him a sanctuary a place where he could come and dwell fully and how can a person make God a sanctuary of their own accord there's got to be inspiration come from God a pattern come from God that God Himself cuz we know he won't dwell within anything but it'll work right so it must be God that was sent forth his word by his spirit that then he'll come and dwell in the pattern that he set forth a mess so women will you find that even in your life of how that God is moving these things didn't just happen all at once but God was moving it had to move upon the hearts of people and then the people are responding to what God's desire is so then when we look at God's whole purpose a desire was not just for a tabernacle not just for something that would be on the outside that would be wonderful but God wants not just something that is just an our image but God wants a durable substance from the inside out man and this is gospel right let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell there so we were looking at it I want to just come back to one of the first times that this word of sanctuary is used within the scriptures and we want to look at it even in this matter because it's important that you had not just in having knowledge that God's purpose cannot be defeated but it's important that that is made real to you and I any good we we see our godly seed our short coming up but God Himself sees something much deeper and there's no way that we're able to pick ourselves up but I believe that God himself we are standing here as witnesses this morning that God is able to fulfill and provide for one year's colorful that he is still to over John game board so within the measure knowing that God's Word cannot be defeated as the Prophet would tell us many times or put it within phrasing in this manner but God did not save you today knowing he's going to lose you tomorrow defeats his own purpose right so God we recognize that our election with Paul could say the word make your election sure and he says or there was Peter but Paul says in Thessalonians he said brother beloved O God that you would know your election yeah you see God already knows your election no lenger soccer notice it wasn't one that we no relation it is important as Peter could say make your election and call it show so these are very important things that here we know that that election was before any alum starter sir molecule and I've been saying it at home a little bit but you know election is not like you are I uh coming up out of the recess and we'll pick a kickball geez where people come forward and then God said I'll choose this one I'll choose that one I choose this foot that's not election my election is that within himself before anything than gun good or evil God has already chosen we are the fruit and the seed of his loins a magazine the God has already purposed that election so with it if we find that God's purpose cannot be defeated even when you look at where it travel of their exodus out of Egypt they come here to the Red Sea in Exodus 15 and Moses you know after they crossed the Red Sea and God mix away through that that is that the the Rick see itself order or the obstacle that was there and has they come up on the other side you know it Moses is singing the song of Moses and he is singing a song jubilee their love of deliverance and I want to just look here just for a moment in verse 16 of Exodus 15 Moses is even not just speaking of what God has done many caught up on the Spirit of God and he begins to speak not only of what God has done but if he gets to speak of what God is going to do amen you say the word of God his luck is not sterile oh my oh hey is he which is uh uh which was which is and which is to come up I'm talking about the word from the where it is me well it's not equal give it something just of mass it's a sterile water it lacks the authority and the power to address present situation in a special condition and that is not the Word of God though we can look at a letter that people can look at the letter you recognize that the only way that you had to truly believe God for who he is is because you are a part of God and God has revealed itself but I removed you from just the past it brings the card from history to the table breasts and thighs press it then he's also a prophesied and reveal those things the Troy el Chacal just you and I standing in a holding pattern and waiting to find out what's God's gonna do I wonder what's going to take place but we have a confidence by pressing reality Oh present God the same God who boo-bear it's the same gonna move out a true comfort hey so within this here Moses his prophet I'm under this under the Spirit of God and he says in verse sixteen fear and dread shall fall upon them speaking about in heaven by the greatness of that arm they shall be as steel as a stone till that people pass over the Lord to the people pass over which thou hast purchased cry purchased Israel to himself how about it yes oh my god tonight a slate off all that first one that's you Michel free in your stead I came down in your stead I banged away just walking up said either purchase me amen Paulo purchases the only purchases that was belongs to him I have these freshest anything yet not only belongs to him he's got a purpose and a reasonable yeah Lord he says Moses going on he says thou shalt bring them in there's no question about this God shall bring them in and let them in the mouth of the light inheritance in a place Oh Lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in the Bliss was balanced made for me the Grumman yes God makes his own place come to worship in the confines of man he worships in his word status is always yes not you coming to the people's place God ordains the place and his people come to you [Applause] here as Moses cause uncle say in the sanctuary Oh Lord with thy hands have established lujah the Lord shall reign forever and ever so we see even in the scripture the scripture is not just speaking of them coming and building the tabernacle it's speaking of elder very many of the dwelling where God Himself will bring forth a body ah that he have set has established but this was also speaking of my Millennium but that even which goes on in the control looking at and you know Israel at the time they don't see all of those parts in there but God is letting if he know this is where I will be look at there is no ass gifts maybe we should repel a door close okay so when we're looking at it the purpose of God it cannot be defeat earlier so when we're giving at the thought here of dedication partly just a moment here I don't want to sweat my jacket later on even break a sweat thank you we're looking at the dedication must be leadership from the Lord by his spirit yes that would bring forth what he's calling for a man it has to be because otherwise it's us presuming and what God wants anytime we presume and I don't know what you later you know deep thinkers here and so forth ah you know we can build bridges right right look at things that this listen this we can do all that we presume on fit right but when it comes to this what is most important is that with our soul there be no presume most important yes they just to have other effects and things around our life for their jobs of others but yet thank god we've got contact with God then we have one who's able to stabilize us Hey what is able to discern and we can hear his voice and that pulls everything else in line in our lives yes thank God sure it must be gone to come and bring leadership in our lives that what he's calling forward we might be able to move in line with it and this is where brother Branham will speak about in the message invisible union of the right of frightened and it talks about how that you know we're looking at the different churches and then actually see we living in and out so he's watching how they're going about and he's talking about the character he's talking about all of these things I remember character is a true substance alright man the outside the outside form is not character the character is a durable substance yeah so here it is a word that's discerning the character he says with Eason I want you to watch is that was the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watched it again how that the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that right catch that woman to left man God made a promise that he was going to deliver God with a strong in God made that promise yes yes Abraham was asleep drunk made the promise I'm going to be at least Rick that's why Moses he failed he was even doing it by her true strength right it was not going to be by Moses himself being one who was alert but it's got to take the calling of that one that God ordained that he would be raised up yeah about the Moses inside of Moses amen amen so we're looking at it it is God Himself remember the people were living down in Egypt a hundred years and here they are we know that Moses you know there was a rejection and Moses goes out for 40 years under the people are conditioned notice God will never move unless the people are in condition beget it's not a burglary that brings him on the seat right allows conditions of time to come into a place to where the people of God they begin the Moose sight of everything else around them in Egypt and the Bible say baby get the crowd to God and God had respect unto the red God hearing them pray in a manner that he had not heard that great before the thing was bread yes say that we're praying but it was something about it they were calling out in tune and in line with what God's desire was to do for God we can be lined with the Word of God he's lined with the sterile I pray in the spirit look at your pad not in the skull step on the seat and God on the chemical fillers were in a today hey I'm speaking to people this morning I let myself at times when you were pray at times be prayed and all of a sudden you hear yourself speak things out of your mouth and you think rulers that adjusts it that does that mean why am I saying that like that gosh God will bring it right to pass amen amen yes sir is exactly the truth I'm a much son bitumen right here you're only taking it to the doctor he had the tumor on his eye that thing's stuck out like that but just so you remember that he is stuck out on this I like that and we have taken him to Kruger claims just a little felt they have put him under it and you know they're going to do x-rays and so forth and I remember I put him up her prayer and we went up to pray and we were just going to pray for God to be with me in the midst of the surgery and we begin to come up there and pray as I was praying I was my mouth king when all the brothers were getting around I'll begin to fake God for His healing God thank you for delivering thank you for judging you listen I'm hearing myself praise this if you go to the bottom alive to think what are you saying but I couldn't stop it a man in your I find you know what in a few days we're setting up again if it wasn't looking wasn't looking this is going down you feel with the Spirit of God is a shadow longer your body you go shake you get down sometimes a righteousness is ready because that sucks your life God will move even the things that need to be prayed about think about what in Luther's time and God was fixing to move in a transition for those things and he began to pray concerning those things even with WestEd think about think of you know brother William Seymour and how that man will all miss some sisters and things like that I I love looking about that I love repeating on yes I don't think the street you're not really dude there's a lot of things but not I read you know it went one book if they can brother cam in 10 meter region I really enjoyed there was you find out there's young people 10 and 12 years old that were being led by the Spirit of God causes moving on their heart and they were praying for people come on somebody yeah you say well brother Sam you're not going back to his usual street but the same God it was back there he comes forward take on their sin but not amazing opening of the work just not doing it or do away Google her God brings him more pressing right through sometimes you know you you're prayed for and you're healed and then there's other times you're grateful and you gotta go to the doctor right any case plane no but the one thing about it is is our faith listen you don't have to go this way whether God heals me here but you know every day of our lives we would love your video our lives to be miracle right without every day about a lot we would we would love every day I love every day when air sickness will come around you know even when I don't feel good oh look when I pray there it is his song God just takes it from me but if it did I'd become very comfortable in eating right brother right I won deliberately I think I need but God knows just the measure of Allah put everything together next where he was right about him dealing with this particular quote and I'm really referring to of how the bright lines will shut up with the Word of God by his Spirit he moves even into that of speaking of a family he goes right from dealing with this and he says you know how it is in a family things can run well for a good period of time he said and then all of a sudden he said it's like they say in the South you know when it rains it pours you should see everything runs on a beautifying and in continuity he said that there's a law to all of that his tears Titus I'm just gonna I'm following him that's what I'm reserved you feel we've many times within our families that here everything is just sealing in mind everything just you know right in order I'm talking about even our attitudes object you die spirit everything yes they not and then you get pressured you get things that come off I get just just the things of life and then what has to happen it has to be the Lord moving on your heart you say wait a minute this thing seems a little bit out of line yeah your may as an amateur creator your desire is to see things brought in line yeah placed on your heart to see those things in life yes and you know what it's God taking those opportunities to prove his grace to you hey man you can look back and say through many dangers total stairs we have already come yes sir that what yes sir you um never existent your faith you you recognized the faith reside in your very precious faith but you and even not even be as precious as it is you just phony having not been that you can see we're here hey ash catcher trick through trail yes hallelujah so this so here the spiritual church there has to be God moving on the scene here remember God was getting Moses ready the people were ready that's the same way it spin within every age yeah you know you would look at this and you would think well these are the people that's ordained of God to hear it why don't they just hear it but you see it's got to be it's got God has to create the atmosphere in order for us to be able to receive a mad they mad you know it is sometimes we're not in the right right right demeaning yes sir this is a matter that you covered the pizza I will cut half a sphere where I will take it right right girl right or you'll say Mary manin that's true but Cohasset o'clock comes down and creates that to where the people begin to call yes yeah here everything is working all of these parts are working together and and notice how that when the gods will send a word that the people that will begin to line with that word that becomes a hunger within the people to line with the Word of God like to spend a little more time with that delicious sleepy just go on just a little bit here when God is speaking to Moses and it's in regard to all of these things in in a vision that God is making known to Moses there when he Moses walks upon the mountain here is Moses in the cloud and God is letting him know many things that as a matter of fact what we read in Exodus $25 our text God was speaking to Moses this was not something that has been made known to the people yet yes then in Exodus 29 just just a few different places God even is making known even of the tabernacle how the Tabernacles to be set up the pattern of it of the garments even with God would begin to deal with the different feast all of these things God is doing in the midst of this time and when he's speaking of it I want just to really draw our attention to this that God is even in verse 43 when he's speaking of the the tabernacle I don't need to run off and leave you I'm just trying for sake of time to keep moving here and in Exodus 29 verse 43 he said there I will meet with the children of Israel and the time and I shall shall be sanctified by my goal see it's no it's no maybe God said I will can verse 24 I will think about the tabernacle congregation and the altar I will say that I also Aaron and his sons to match - near the priests office and I will dwell among the chair viscera and will be their God and they shall know that I the LORD their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell about there I have the Lord their God and God continues to speak to Moses in the midst of this act not keep in mind God's purpose cannot be defeated God continues to speak to Moses in the midst of this time and he goes into infinity X to the sturdy he speaks about with be the the Apocrypha the anointing oil and want is to be anointed and you see within the whole of it there is especially 26 through verse 30 of how that Moses instructed by God that all things are to be ignited in unity see the anointing of God the true anointing of the Holy Spirit coming to the word moving on the seat of God it brings unity it brings unity when God came down to look upon the Tower of Babel God came down did he not but with what they had he did not bring unity it brought separate so you know a person can say well - it got the Holy Ghost we got the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost comes to the word to make it live you see many of the churches the Bible says that God would find his spirit upon all flesh and look there's many songs it's written even for this time there are even not believers but the inspiration strikes I said what are you going with that with the bainham prophesied truth if you didn't me his prophecy did not make him elect or true but what was spoken was what God spoke through me even made of Balaam didn't know him as Lord God your look in the scriptures they all knew it God said baby anyway listen you and I can see Minnesota but we know that Saint God in a personal way and that personal relationship yeah Laurie so so you find that this unity the Spirit of God by the Word of God is set to bring unity and by miracles truly there is no unity and harmony outside of the body of Jesus Christ yeah yeah I'm talking about you can make people that can be uh sex and different things together and they can be a harmony around something of the yet still is not the harmony that God is calling for woo isn't as a harmony that God's calling for remember what what what when the Lord Jesus was pray in John 70 here he is in an intercessory prayer that they may be one even as you and I want a style art in bi in there yes drama - the true brothers it's like Welling inside of us because when his life is dwelling inside of us in the most holy place then it would bring every gives us power to bring everything else into subjection the first time I can't you got to get the camera there right with all the generals in the bed and the Holy Ghost seriously that you say I can't you need to get the camera because when you get the camera I can do all things right we have a - that strip and you have a sprint it is an outfit or we got some great big muscles but the stripe is you - here amen so all the almost be anointed together not just the congregation anointed but the congregation and the ministry together are anointed but the same only goes whoo many things begin to move been things because the change is it oh it isn't it wondered how that the enemy will try to affect you you know your breakfast goes right every other day of the week and Sunday morning comes right no coffee in the house that's a red light emerges something comes at the team what was wrong with these aids what's wrong just close it you know you find things what you're trying to do you're trying to break trying to break that unity he can't break that seal on your soul but he tries to break that unity to try to get you an outset so we're not able to receive the listen brother sister you and I might come into service and here we are ordained for this moment and it may not be that you receive healing in your body you may not even be able to say I receive deliverance this morning but it could be that you are just a conduit and pulling on the gift of God as a part of a body you are anointed by the Spirit of God and God moved out in blue throughout your life and you witness Congress why is that because we're a part of his father is working so God has spoken and made it a firm here I'm gonna I'm going to say to father tabernac I'm gonna say to father altar you shall not the Tavener but you shall in North the altar you shall him not Aaron in his son God is laying all this out in Exodus 31 verse 1 remember his purpose cannot be a fief Exodus 31 here you find this is a vision Moses is still up there and here he is speaking the Lord is speaking to Moses and he says see I had called by name verse 2 vasila the son of you you're the son of hur of the tribe of Judah I have filled him look at this in verse 3 I have filled him with the Spirit of God see God doesn't look at things of well some day God sees this that's finished I want to come instead you may have just received the Holy Ghost but God already seen you filled her glory be to God he already make prediction that you and I could be filled with the Holy Ghost and let me say provision wasn't just Calvary Calvary made away but because we were sons and daughters of God we could be born a cow free has such a very very if what mean to us it's not just us looking and saying I might save your blood and died we realize it was God because one of us a man I'll make another step forward God becoming one of us in relationship and can't folks to us it has a meaning to us a great significance so here're God is speaking and letting this be known i have already in wisdom and understanding in knowledge in all manner of workmanship is it amazing listen like somebody talking behind your back they're talking about your brother Dominick thing you're going to do a job they've already get it there they are again I got the the program of the plans laid out and here you are you you're home on Saturday to go on the grass and the buses are already saying with I'm just going to do this so we're going to come out like this really you don't really know but then you get back to work on Monday morning reality strikes done make meetings even your office I look at these plans and these things right here we were looking at these things you've done before and we want to see this time woo what is it they make known to you what they discussed when you want it in the presence are you that's a man we love those things Oh II don't understand but the boss calls you hit you I know my prince will come yes a Oh what do you want beauty of usual wondering is it gonna be more work this is a part of us boy we like things to be easy thanks for truth we like things to run at ease but you know what there's times everything is a wall contrast oh my so here God is already let it be known of these things in even in verse six I've given unto out given with him around the son of a shimmer of the tribal dad and the hearts of all that are wise hearted I put wisdom that they may make all that I have commanded thee so when you come down here all of this heavenly vision is taking place but then God ends it and he tells Moses to get down you need to go down the people by people have corrupted thyselves oh my you think about here Moses at a time of such glory in the presence of God right and God at the end of it my you know they've corrupted themselves know if it's you and I knew things oh boy hmm let's take the vision and let's mark out Aaron's me let's mark out Betsy loves me let's mark out and light a lamp let's mark out their names because surely surely they can't be God must have made a mistake no God did make a mistake right but God's choosing was not based on what they were doing I am you with me yeah you follow me into the few minutes yes so here God makes it known to Moses even the probably doesn't say this is what's taking place but you have to know they turned aside unto other gods of which I have commanded them that they should and if you notice in here in the scripture when Moses comes down and he addresses the situation this as well I want you just to look at you're very close to when God has given a word that it is to address to the people of God for that generation within that within that word God is there to make good on every promise he's there to see that it comes into full manifestation malaria so when you see this Moses comes down and Moses could see the condition of the people the Bible says he saw in Exodus 30 to 20 values of the people were Nicky and and he says that Aaron had made them naked no will you look at it the people and they begin to come to Aaron Aaron himself went along with their pool right you see the vision is breaking forth but they don't know it right God knows they're in this vision they don't know they're in the vision you see what's taking place is that if that vision had truly already broke on their lives this would be happening but this taking place is showing that the vision that God is given to Moses has not broken their lives in a night vision race there is no offering that vision is surety and that vision is what God Himself that's already promised I right man yes yes so here they're they're naked naked mean the word the word used you're naked means let loose without restraint the people are moving with a dedication I hear hear they've come out of Egypt they hear a prop that a message that yet within it they they're not recognizing and have not come under the anointing of what is all about so what is it give Aaron Erica the attack which we recognize Aaron a fight of the priesthood and of a of the ministry yes but if that ministry is not anger the true anointing of that perfect one I'm not talking about imagine right right you know where you care the Bible a certain way to do this eagle but I'm not talking about that that fails all right that kind of stuff producers go to tests right see God move but yet it's what's what God's desire is he wants to meet that same God living inside of you and me 2004 he told me said don't you make an image welcome to the winged fowl behalf or likely any four-footed beast or anything of this era why because God had already ordained that it would be his image living inside of Shakeology hey hey man - close the sock that's his iPhone Luud so this is nakedness that come upon the people he's recognizing there without restraint there's no leadership and I don't think we need to head is not a rocket science we see that with where the people of this time of this age that even though they can have the Bible but yet even in having the Bible without having Christ and South has the integrity of that word and living that word out the people there's no standard to all the people you find them giving whereas getting better that's why there is no answer to sin the only answer to the same question yes the blood of Jesus Christ the way to repeal it yes sir you might say go send a handle some people right now that I mean they think the rid of there's some holy and purchase I'll say my god I really mean that friends yes I really mean it hey guy said do you believe there's some people out there that are not compromised understand I sure do there are they're anointed for where they're supposed to be a little my heart yes but but the thing of it is is that what we see in the midst of this hour and this age to wear that the people there is no shrimp to a stand was coming on what must I do compromise how do they have no access to the authority and the power of the Spirit of God although they can be amazing but they don't have access now a cheap way and goes mad bad light travels through use work hurry up so then they have to make compromises they have to look at things and say well oh you know I think it's okay to have you know homosexuality in gays in the church and things like I wanna I just watch back in December a whole round table of of different pastors and things like that and these different pastor to say they said we would sat down all of our worship leaders they said this is we would lose you we lose you set them all down because of that they said so we believe there's room in the church for it might be room in a church but there's not room in the body there's not even room for anything outside of Christ himself oh yeah notice the importance now they're naked and this is the same scripture that uses the same word that's used naked here and this scripture is where there is no vision the people perish all right that same word perish is the same word that used make it there without restraint so a vision that God's word God by his Spirit giving thought of his word and that word taking hold upon the people when you and I are our people of vision it's not just people as we said moments ago that look back to a passage we talked about we talked about what God did what God did but we have we have an experience you don't way we can know what God should have did back there if you have to have an experience right now right now and not attach you back there but it also gives you your destined a thank you when you look back and see what God did that you know where Congress is moving and gives you stability in this aisle yeah did you trick amen where it David you could say dr. love is my light it is my strength yes it rose up just up on my flesh they stumbled oh yeah yeah alright so there we are vision or because it is no vision the people will perish yes it says the vision itself is not just a Bible right the vision itself is not just fiction books right the vision is the divine revelation wrought by the holy ghost himself lujah back your sight you gives hip opens to you and I purpose it makes know who we are yeah she did he moved upon me here it comes now what Satan does the same thing he doesn't come to me and begin to make known his whole plans but he begins to move up on her with word first all right it moves a father with word what's he doing breaking down all the barriers I can't do it a mission from it try is that right yes sir the enemy cannot bring trouble to us unless we permit I understand I'm talking about he can he can make it bring suggestion but if they stop them then you fight for your company all right whether it's about your health or whatever more is the enemy to come you know and say oh you're not gonna make it and the noise the devil I say what is that bother me because your desire is hey you would even bother you to somebody say that you have faithfulness of your wife or of your husband he was trouble you for somebody to say something against now right amen yes so he moves even he she opens in in full dedication a word yeah and she opened and then she is so moved to Ana dedication to where that it completely takes her oh the Word of God Wow yes sir who do you see I'm an RD trishing it's animated yeah that anointing safe there was anointing her with unbelief right yes sir spiritual and it was carrying her above was me her feel like she was no no oh god help slide right god help us in this out a matter history main humble amen things that we see and brought us it gotta show us I'll tell you one thing I have to look at those things and say Lord I know I don't see it the way I need to see ya show me just think sometimes you know hardest you can read in the message reading the scriptures but I know there's something there going I don't know what it is but I know something that I keep bringing this back to you you keep bringing anybody I don't know what it is but will you show them you know hey mess portly show me but let it be my life hey yeah you love it yeah let me try to move here your Moses he comes in at this time and God from Moses Moses he stands in the breech in this time pepper God has told Moses here that he is going to destroy the people he says I'll raise up a uh I recently bought it yourself right so when you're looking at this the Bible says in Psalm 106 23 therefore he said that he would destroy them had not Moses his chosen stood before him building a bridge to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy it you know was something greater that God saw him Moses yes it went ahead much go in the flesh but it was the Spirit of Christ that was there in Moses he was seeing he was seeing the cross you seen have you seen sacrifice they're coming through Moses hallelujah I want you to just to take this just just for a moment because you see there are promises that God has made in his word there's promises of healing yes many promises and there are distance a tional promises which are identified with the light and in that it also includes all other promises of healing so there are times where God is visiting to make a promise that he is made to a people to a generation just like uh you know finding how in the problem was here on the scene and how how often you had people that were rising up and they had a you know Elijah's garment your different things was rising up have Elijah's garment and all of these things why because it was to try to take away from what God was getting right that's he same we'll do that yes sir um how was I had hours the preacher back in you see God mess us up oh shut that guy up down there removing his voice going to go out there going to write the book God and shake this come then but you know what God's Word will not return boy it is also that we are children of God that the word asked me just keys to set my sheep Laura a manatee because he looks different if because of his presence his person it moves upon us and we're like that boy who calls the train with amnesia you start getting into familiar territory man and all of a sudden start walking what is it we're in place of that are familiar to us though it seems like I never been here before but yes you were you are always in the mind of God do I always have taken this word becoming flesh Oh a word that God is sin now watch how God he looks at Moses but when Moses coming down and God tells Moses fat people that tells Moses that you have corrupted themselves Moses never looked at it as his people Moses turns right around in the scripture and Moses begins to if we could say rebuke God and say Lord Lord God you brought these people out these are backing now wait a minute we got we got an argument going on your people know that your people your people know they're your people so are we talking about the flesh man Moses oh these all mozart's it's the promise that God has spoken and when God has made a promise he who feels it by his spirit so it was the Spirit of Christ when God was looking at Moses he was looking at the flesh of Moses and saying there are your people he was looking at Christ it's all high and he said these are high people hey Christ's these concepts there are your people oh the father hath given me shop coming to me and I will not lose one the right Paul said all that our Christ our gods so here it's recognize it thank God for that because if it had not been that the people were all in a ticket taken by that word but Christ there is no intercessor but see what God has made a word like God moved on day to try to find a place to build the tabernacle is that right but David couldn't bring it too fast the Solomon brought it in the manifestation there are same same God moving and working to bring and fulfill his promises Oh glory be to God so when we when we notice and we look at it that how God he's moving within this it's where that Moses he took God remember my servants a brand Isaac and he says of Israel thy servants whom thou swearest by thine own self and it goes on to everything he's calling it God to what his word because God won't step off his horse brought a human stepovers word and the God in you and in me if any part of us steps over the word if God it you or me brings us back you what brother some of that could happen oh brother balanced and it was clicked in that material he's looking at the woman and he sees a dress the way she is and the policeman has his arm around her anyways the old God Huskies he lets us stand on this right how can the critical spirit yes sir all right yes how dead brother branches got caught him to the side and dropping into talks with every rep says I realized he said that how was just hate my brother member wearing short britches you wanting a halter top but its spirit yes sir is had to she got it looks deeper I'm he has a bringing back in mind whatever I do is the door for you yes it brought things back in I didn't see was stepping over what God's grace to you that's that's the only thing God is great by spirit that separates us from the rest of the world it may have not raised grace would be said in first moment he said you'd be going right overhead right brother eyes would because of his grace God has given us understanding just like what's it concern head backs it up he said I feel dualism deliver my spirit and understand it but you are on day to understand I know sometimes I feel like what I don't understand you don't help me to see this yes so help me to see this you are dating for no sender why am I not understanding it why am I not seeing it the way I need to because God want you to pray - had people down through the ages where a church would start and they begin to seek after God where the Spirit of God but then the congrat children struggle having it they come up and they alder seek after God and begin to take what the founders have said without having a personal experience we're very much listen to you follow after I let this be right things I'm good and they fail to recognize God moving out of there next oh yeah they don't see after God yes yes God most people go seek every hallelujah hey hey so he calls his attention to his word and God can't step over his word you see that word for the outer which God had spoke to Abraham it was just a couple verses there in Genesis 15 here's God fulfilling that word there was a message that was there and that message in Genesis 15 were guarded spoke out delivered with a mighty hand it was seal up but when it came time forgot to move the seal was ruggedness and the commandments that were inside of that word come forth yes His commandments is his will make no there's a protection for our life within those two verse of scripture I've seen you don't see Moses name in there do it while I things not in the Bible they're right who's the first one to call Moses name hero's sister God that was it was it was it not Moses was his name not to be Moses it was God move it and no us even in your own life there might be things are you in the back maybe you don't see family or middle like us a strong spiritual journey but let me tell you something God I just stand upon your life yes God he Lucia he's knew where you were at yea or nay men and that word when that word rose up notice here in this time when Moses is coming down from the mountain and he stands on behalf of the people and programs has no normal thinking man would do this the Spirit of Christ why it was the achievement of Christ in Moses that was moving on behalf of the people there that you see that's why he takes the holy spirit taking the word breaking it to our hearts and to our life as he stands as the high priest of his own word oh yeah hey I always think how brother Barry stumbling in him in the middle I think it was in adoption part one he stopped all by the devil did you get it he said he is a high priest of his own word my failures but he's a high priest of his word he releases to you and I the strength that we got neither back a performs in my life the way that he is or they gonna let me support and minister to us in this time one you understand you and I want to understand understand taxable but yet he reaches clear back and he moves from that with just spent eternity and it gets to a fall to you have that vision that we did even though we were part of [Applause] yeah I guess the stabilizer door hey it gets close to rise above us that dedication luigi's I'm alluding it because God already if God is calling you and I I'm coming down as God calls you and I say dedication he don't call you a knight to something and he's not already example of hallelujah God is dedicated yes yes he's dedicated let me show you look at the strength of this dedication clear back before Adam Stardust or molecule before you I ever had a need the Bible said the lamb lamb was slain dry what a foundation Thank You Marty before there was ever a devil God the lamb was slain sure the color hey it's not like you're going to build something and then after a while we get the looking at academic this more sure how God made it sure that's why we this is the church when that came that's why Paul could reach back and say brag forget don't even get consumed with all this the foundation of the Lord standard are his a lure they met God's foundation is sure and their the lamb slain over you and I all that we would have need of glory see God as a prophet could put it like this when you look at it in the scripture in Romans 8 for all he whom he did foreknow yes then he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son can I have about 10 more minutes sir yes sir don't let me do it I'm asked for 10 more I just want to get get us to a place here just a feeling just to come to this place there yeah this is cause God's and I don't want to just say determine because God Himself being determined or perseverant it must be perseverance is own Buffy you can only have perseverance we have faith that God doesn't have faith in anything but it's word could be perseverant we cannot these perseverance unless there is faith and we cannot faith he had got to us a measure here in order to be persevered God is showing his perseverance yes we did foreknow then he also did predestinate any prick to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first ornament many brothers wonder whom he did predestinate Amy also called when we called them II also just the back whom he justified them he also glorified yes all right ho goes on to say here what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against what can you say what can you say beat him to me Lord yeah according to thy will oh yeah yes this is where the public could say in question from answer I believe this year he said I just wanted mean it is so good yes Lord I mean this is just like eating the top edge of a cherry pie you got to you know all of them I don't want to just crusts and he goes into how I are Oh predestination and here we are grilling in the body of Jesus Christ I want spirit we are baptized into one body he said now now you have been called like that I want to speak chosen ones that God chosen him before the foundation world think of that God chose us in him before the foundation of the world God knew before the foundation world that I speak the same subject tonight he's different and before there was a world is a group get the Holy Ghost now the word the word will bring it that's how it come up here yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them yes before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to get ahead ago because he him that you'd be watching it yeah what as it was in his mind to give it to me why did he just give it to me because he had to raise if you the desire to receive me sanctuary my MA and he chose you himself all he said he chose you in crash fit for you or Jesus any of you was on the earth and he sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself all he says to fake it's not what I wanted it wasn't my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God Souls and put our name on the Lamb's Book a lot before there was even a world oh he's here oh my god Laurie God's purpose cannot be defeat yes so then all of this has been spoken Karen and his sons shall minister unto me in the priest's office thou shalt anoint you bet solo film i have already filled him with the spirit with my spirit yes it will happen I think I've got that right and I'll say right all of this God has spoken it's already and we see that even by we had a vision that we're looking at right here you and I being in God's mind but you see when Moses the sins here the people are all deserted there has to come forth direction by virtue of God the dedication yes and that has to come dedication to his word that he's spoken to his promise see God's promise it couldn't or it wouldn't be the overriding of his own nature and we'll right amen so here what God has spoken I watched let me just the majestic drop in this God brings forth his children by his word that's right amen that's why a word it must take the word and inspiration by the spirit of up for this moment for this time this hour the Luthor's word or weapons whir although there was truth there but that would not take effect upon you and I today I believe that we can hear that and we can live a true are justified by faith I'm seeking the Lord by faith I'm saying sure we can live there and hear it that Wesley's message I talked about some some method is that was kill preacher real save the fine gospel we can say Amen a really nice event but I hear that out of the dish being restored back to the Church of the Living God we could say amen amen you must be a word telling birth Amen Alleluia not bring back to you and I remember as we said at the beginning there's got to be a death before life comes oh yeah yeah we're not the socializing gospel is going now even when you find people that you're walking away saying I just want to Jesus or love he does love us you can say one of us take a look at this apply the fingers of God takes a word to move upon our lives in this hour to do up break away all those things everything around us to do what free for that which God himself has sown unto himself that's what Paul could say the gospel of your salvation you you you believe it when you hate but after you believe yeah I was working bringing forth got close with your life you start walking come all have all the desires to but you're walking yes lucky the water baptism you're still walking what is it it's a word that's dealing with your life a presence of the Lord and you start moving your God is dealing with your life and you start you start saying ma I gotta leave this aside I like that aside I like this and it's not something that you're just doing but you're laying in a sack because of him yeah it's like a queer it's going to blend into and everything else fades away yeah Oh Sofia yeah but it's coming time for unite the Bible could say when it looks into the scripture says last labor to enter into his rest yes the gift is written yes because it's labor yes yeah this really it's true it is a free gift that's not something you're acting merit right right on God that that gift of God the mystery of God God is good is sad before it stir something up within us assess that we're gonna receive the Holy Ghost bless he moves so that you and I would rise a better sing Lord hallelujah Lord say to hide it all oh yeah move it must be something to jump you will not override our free will oh yes the gardener be he was led away she surrendered under deception the Iron King that a body has not prepared for me here came forth a body that was reserved to the little God right here came for the truth temple and Tabernacle Almighty God he came forward the tabernacle in who was a sanctuary yes yeah well glory be to God glory hallelujah there had to be you know when all this vision takes place here in the scriptures the God is like he puts a pause button and you put all this on hold yeah what does he tell Moses to finish the tabernacle out there at the base of the mountain that word kappa not enough sanctuary that come forth yet but the tabernacle yeah push pitch the tabernacle and the people must go out to the tabernacle oh they will seek after God and that tabernacle is that altar that was built at the base of the month a man see in order for you an act to become the sanctuary God had to become tired they had to become a tabernacle that would be one man in the lattice of single flesh that through the shedding of his blood at that life might be imparted that you see prices cut it all up and say after he went through among the people a notice out Moses is going about the Spirit of God Moses ethical down here abuse Aaron and here the column of people into repentance and and he says who's on the launch site come stand by me yes he was got spokesman in an hour yes yeah you want to be on God's side you're on Moses side today because Moses was God's representative I I've got a straw Christ identified by his own characteristics yes Amen Peter got so as he's standing there remember the people could not the people had not the power to come into acceptance under God when it Moses say I'll go make a tournament for you amen he didn't go through the lamb it was it was that sacrificial life that was the true sacrifice right there the body itself true that there had to be a a virgin born body a blood that was not created between that of a man and a woman it had to be better blood that will wash you a nap but what was it going to release oh I and that sacrificial blood come back upon us is the worship call you and I into sacrifice Laurie here is Moses I go to make an atonement Moses comes down what does he do God kills him and he speaks God says tell the people I'm not gonna go in a moment yes I'm not gonna go mom let's say smile all of the mercy of God yes and under people or they do repent they begin to strip themselves of all one of us why what at work I'm just happy to look at is that even though what God has internal it is God who comes to stir those things up in you and Miriam who desire and asked for what He desires to give a men it already belongs to you they have put you must rise and take the you must make it yours that's why Paul could say I seek to apprehend that which I'm happy to move the Holy Ghost is for you but you must rise and they've got it all in your life hi everything or a see that many decide that isn't something out of that a ministry that that anybody can tell you that's something that it has to be God deals with your life yeah God's culture hey you're recognized as you walk on with the Lord that laboring to enter injures rest it's not our works that labor is not our works that labor is faith yielding to him is being drawn to fall in love with him or you find how that God comes and he quickens it and the love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is God yes and God is love it is the love of God in you then the love of God is love you love him you desire to release him about all other yes yeah you can look in your life and you know whether the tokens better plan because you can see have my desires hey so then what are you fully satisfied Christian yeah hey what's about a word that calls you an act in the dedication that's what happened on the day of Pentecost the people the disciple all of them they were in disarray yes you know what happened they knew that their new they've been a prophetic ministry but they needed leadership to go for one case to be a bangle there was misery if the Lord Jesus had not spent the forty days not only showing infallible proofs but the Bible says speaking things pertaining the kingdom of God he who came back to give them you yes yes he was he was letting him know all the things that I told you before I'm telling you right now the circumstances have not turned out like you thought they were going to turn out but it's exactly according to my plan hey what is it doing every time God does that it stabilizes you yes me that are I yes God stabilize unite what does it do it gives you direction okay now go there what is it the word itself the Living Word is gathering the people in dedication and they were dedicated unto the word now the Holy Spirit and they became dedicated in the word a man not a hotel but in it goes out it is Christ in them dwelling in the midst of your lives let's go to design for everyone else hey daddy I'm truly you can be tested I can be tested all many different things can come our way throughout time even even after being filled with the Spirit of God but remember at all times on life is not there you don't hey because it that that life moves with there's sacrifice and service to say Lord I'm Yours I'm Yours fully Lord yes how how I want to respond to what you're calling for just like even as a any of you in any of us no matter
