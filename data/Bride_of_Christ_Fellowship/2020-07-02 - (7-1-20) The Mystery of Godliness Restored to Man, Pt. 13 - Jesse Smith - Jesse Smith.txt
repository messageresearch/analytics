reading of the word we're gonna do here tonight they father be magnified and glorified of Jesus Christ name Church said Amen I think our Bibles will just read our regular verse 2nd Peter 1:7 let's read that verse 2nd Peter 1:7 second Peter 1:7 or VMI rivers hey bro van good to see you sister see you god bless you good to see you are you off work today brother wonderful oh you find like a holiday break is over or do you take did you take vacation oh shut down that's right brings along hey guys are we so happy in the house of God I tell you that's a blessing may the Lord keep that on your heart all your life I wish I would have that when I was younger 2nd Peter 1:7 I remember every promise of God I'm sorry every blessing of God is obtained through believing the promise how many things you have a promise for brotherly kindness or look at that tonight just like you have a promise for godliness we saw on Sunday night temperance you have those promises with all those promises but it's to whosoever will whoever will believe God's Word and we're believers so thank God there for us 2nd Peter 1:7 let's read this on three one two three and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity I'm just going to read verse eight myself for if these things be in you see they got to be inside you and abound they make that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so see all these attributes are added to you and they make your understanding of the gospel increase we shouldn't be more can we shouldn't be more confused about the message as time goes on we should understand it better because that's what the scripture says is you get another more anointing another anointing your understanding of the message I'll say like this crystallizes right it becomes so clear that's what the power of God does may God add his blessings to reams word maybe see the praise guy and again I'll try to watch the time here again by the grace of Lord but you know the funny thing is like we said last week we'll just stay in fellowship longer so we thank the Lord for the fellowship and that kind of goes along with our thought though for tonight you know brotherly kindness amen and I were just chatting before hand and he said I always feel so great being around you and the believers I said exactly right there's no other people I don't want to be around he's got the sweetest people in the world is the bride of Jesus Christ and the foolish murder are wonderful people as well praise God Jesus said he they were blessed and he foreknew them as well before the foundation of the world so we love all God's children praise God all right so let's take a look at these scriptures tonight I want to just teach on brotherly kindness I'll just pull up a rope quick quote I was looking at I was thinking about this quote when I pulled up here real quick all right so let's look at the start on brotherly kindness I trust you enjoyed the godliness on Sunday night I just love seeing how God's Word fits perfectly together when your godly your love like God sinners and enemies you love with the love of God by the grace of the Lord so tonight as we look at brotherly kindness remember it's the seventh anointing God gives you and let's just go back and look real quick briefly I all the things you have to reject the Bible says that we know Satan's devices yeah praise God we are not the bosses we're not ignorant of what Satan's trying to do so church if you and I if we're not born again then we know specifically where Satan's trying to attack us he's trying to get us to disbelieve right reject the faith that we first received and then he's trying to get us to be hypocrites to reject virtue right so he's gonna try to anoint believers with hypocrisy to say what they believe but not actually follow through on it and then Satan's gonna attack many in the message with human reasoning so they they they try to understand things with their own way rather than taking God's understanding God's knowledge of the situation also next is he'll try to tempt them with sensuality my this is a tough one all around right whether you got the Holy Ghost or not just bringing your fleshly body into subjection but Satan gets many people on sensuality next one is haste so instead of patience instead of accepting the anointing of patience Satan tries to tempt people to make quick hasty decisions without praying about it first Amen thank the Lord we always got to pray first even if it's just stopping for 10 seconds just stop and pray and you've got a chance to work on the situation praise God before making a decision praise God and then if you want godliness we saw on Sunday night you have to reject ereference you can't we just can't we get dissed Reese back sinners I told this thing the statement a few months ago but I've seen numerous Christians and I think it's just my judgment looking at their life I didn't talk to them personally about it but because they were ear reverent towards sinners and even the devil I feel like evil situations have happened them because they've been irreverent to the things too even sinners too even the devil make in front of the devil making fun of I've seen that at least two occasions people making fun of the devil and not respecting it remember the scripture says that even Michael didn't make fun of the devil let's go there let's go to Jude 1 so you can see that even Mike Michael had some level respect and I'm trying to think of the second one one of them was really really awful let's go to Jude what was the other one yeah help me Lord perhaps the Lord to help me remember another one railing yeah the scripture says yeah verse 4 in verse 8 Jude which was the I believe the the brother of James Jude is warning believers not to to be like the sodomites right and then the angels because he warns him in verse 5 that God destroyed the the Jews that left Egypt because afterwards they believed not they didn't believe on all the way see we got to keep on believing praise God look at verse oh and just converse sixth and the Angels was catching up or cut not their first estate but left their own habitation you have two reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day even as Sodom and Gomorrah the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh see that sensuality there they never got an only thing of godliness right I'm sorry temperance they never got it despise Dominion and speak evil of dignities now isn't that something all these riots member of a man we're talking bout that scripture they riot during the daytime Peter talked about they riot during the daytime look at all these riders a lot of them are for like the the homosexual movement the transgender movement they speak evil against any leader that won't give them any any demand they have even the mayors and the cities that let them do it and then if the mayors don't give them exactly what they want they go to their houses and you price all the violence this week you know with that they're just filthy they defile their flesh filthy dreamers they speak evil of the dignities and then verse 9 yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses Durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee so Judas giving a differentiation between a holy angel and a filthy dreamer or a filthy sodomite a filthy sodomite isn't scared to speak against principalities and government's those though they'll rail against them in other words they'll attack their character but Jude says even a holy angel doesn't bring a railing accusation against Satan he just says the Lord rebuke thee any spot and you never see brother branham making fun of the devil now in the one case I I don't remember the second example mercy I wish I would remember that I wish would have wrote that down but the example I saw was this individual kept going around making fun of the devil and I never as soon as I heard it I didn't like it well the devil came in that person's family and made one of his family members go crazy now they're almost there on medication and almost insane and and someone that said they were born-again the Holy Ghost and had the Word of God well now the couple's divorced and a doctor II and people thought they were like solid and then with the Holy Ghost now I didn't I didn't talk to individual yeah I haven't felt led to do that yet but I just noticed I mean making fun of the devil and this happened so in other words it seemed like some confidence it seemed like an overconfidence you know the Bible says we don't bring railing accusations against Satan but we just rebuke him in Jesus name Amen praise God see whenever because we never want to get exalted with pride have a Satan's thing right pride but we be like him we we mimic him a week when we exalt ourselves even above him now as far as in the blood of Christ yes if we're exalted as far as God's glory but that's not something we brag about it's just the fact it's just our position but church let me say like this we got to be very careful what we say with our words this tongue is a world of iniquity the Bible says and who-who contained the tongue the Bible says I say who can the Holy Ghost field man or a woman praise God that's her Lord what's the obey God's Word and what's to live right before the Lord and once they learn from their mistakes cuz who hasn't made a mistake here we've all made mistakes especially with our lips oh my goodness so see let's be careful who we rail against be careful that's why when people move churches no matter never obviously people do it in Lima in different places and here we have to be very careful what they say about their past Church we have to be very very careful it's okay to differ with people but if you're blasting to them and giving regula accusation against them something's wrong with that heart something's wrong with that the church let's be sure we don't gossip and we don't rail against people and we don't judge people before the time he's got so see that's a temptation boy Satan gets a lot of people doesn't he say gets a lot of people with ear reference doesn't he they'll just say anything I'll just blast anybody and rail against them he gets a lot of people with that so they never get godliness and now tonight the the great temptation the the great device Satan tries to use is selfishness the last step before being born again yeah selfishness Oh help us Lord amen thank God so brotherly kindness is the self less miss you need to live for your Christian family while all God's Way praise the Lord so see those are great devices Satan uses unbelief époque recei human reasoning or man's intellect sensuality hast ear reverence and tonight selfishness now brother man tells us here now remember a temperance brother branham said you're starting to become a pretty good man at temperance he said but people can fall off at any point before charity people can fall off because they can they can blaspheme the Holy Spirit that was sanctified them that's what the scripture says in Hebrews 10 Loran said he said how many people are on the trash pile of ministers he comes him as we walk I'll rock along this highway causes the highway of holiness he said oh look at the trash heaps if you haven't listened that's a great message to listen to thank you for every minute he said how many people are on the side of this highway in the trash heaps they tried to serve God but when it came down to one of these anointings are one of these temptations they chose a lot of people to sensuality right instead of temperance they have to have this certain relationship or they have to have this certain drug or this certain thing to satisfy their flesh and so they never get the anointing of temperance same thing as irreverence instead of godliness instead of instead of speaking kind or just not saying anything at all like children we have a good conversation about that if we don't have anything good to say children what should say anything at all that shows if you got that quarter this you got some good godliness if you can hold your tongue and not speak against your brother and sister like we talked about this week with my family that's a good attribute of course that probably is with brotherly kindness but you understand what I'm saying when you have that reference you reverence your dad you reverence your mom you reverence your grandparents right you reverence everyone because you understand they're a child of God amen so tonight we want to look at this brotherly kindness and make sure we don't fall to Satan's temptation to be selfish now I'm still fighting the quo here yeah here Ryan gives the smallest teaching on brotherly kindness in this sermon it's the smallest amount he gives it a strange example maybe to us well Ram said adding relly kindness he says he says when you got that put yourself in his place on the matter so when you have brotherly kindness you can you can put yourself in somebody's shoes how would they feel or how would I feel if I was treated like that how would I feel if I was in her situation how would I feel if I was in his situation he then he quotes Peter he said Peter said Jesus my brother sinned against me shall I forgive him seven times a day and Jesus says seventy times seven Levine says brotherly kindness he said now you see if a brother's all out of tune don't be impatient with him be kind to him go anyhow so if somebody's attitude be kind to them and try to go to them and bring reconciliation to them that's being a problem a brother in Christ that's being kind to them if their attitude and try to help them out well Ram goes on to say somebody said not long ago oh can you brother branham believe these things the way you do and still go to the summaries of God and the oneness and all the rest you know that's a that's a good question if brother Ram but you know you hear him preach he preaches hard brother Graham preaches hard against the Trinity and sprinkling babies yep that for baptism and he blasts it you know he really does blast denominations but they asked him well how can you believe and preach so hard and still go to those places where the RAM says see brotherly kindness he says is the answer he said hoping some day I'm patient with him temperate and during with them knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that some day God will bring him in and that's where brother Graham stops that's all he says about brotherly kindness so he says it's forgiving uh forgiving your brother 490 times right not seven times in a day 490 times in the day brother hey man I hope I never do that to you hope I never do 490 sins against you in one day if I do please forgive me each time you know and then go ahead and jump so people outside of the message that's a good example for him say he read praise God I said how can you go he said go and preach to them he said you still go preach to the summaries of God that's where I was raised I was raised in somebody's of God denomination or the oneness how can brother Graham still go to Trinitarian churches and oneness you know all these kind of churches he said what helps him do it is brotherly kindness preaching the word and hoping someday somebody will catch the revelation of God's Word now over the years church when we've traveled and gone on different vacations I think the last time was last year we went through Columbus I don't remember why we were traveling well it was a Sunday morning on the way home do you remember Oh was the homeschool convention okay and so ends Saturday night well we don't want to drive late in the night I get tired when I Drive at night so we stayed til Sunday and I think I had Simon cover for me or Brian Hawkins or something here well that morning you know if we left at 7:00 a.m. or 8:00 a.m. we get to Columbus right about the time a family members church service started well they're kind of Baptist or I don't even know what they are now Presbyterian Lutheran there's kind of like a strange mix but church we were able to go there and now it's totally different than our church right they come in there and let it look like they got their street clothes on nobody had a tie on I think I was only one that had a tie on everybody got their jumps their gym shoes on like their Nikes and like their basketball shoes out and there's collars and all undone and it's just different from us the women got their skinny jeans on the men got their senda skinny jeans on they got their earrings and the men the women and always the family and I are always nervous and us mr. Mason because we know we stick out like a sore thumb well you know church as they as they gone on I was just able to participate as much as I could I raised my hands I whispered a few amens because nobody was saying really anything and I'm just nervous in that situation but you know he preached on Philippians he preached on the book of Philippians and that's where I got some of the original notes I took notes on the Sir Martha I never knew that I never knew this is Paul was in jail when he wrote this and I learned quite a good few things from that and the preacher was a black young man and I went up afterwards I said I really appreciate that sermon brother and I did he said oh thank you and and I you know I didn't I had some books but I already gave it him out and I didn't have time to run out to the car but I did get my book away to my family member at that time and we went there and I just prayed about it my wife said what do you think we should do should we try to find a message church it's kind of odd the way and I was like no let's just let's just go to that family members church and show them some love then they've come to numerous services of ours and and in church that was my expression of brotherly kindness just like brother brand you say how could you go to a church where they wear skinny jeans I don't look at them I just yawn I don't support that I don't wear skinny jeans but I can still go there hoping that someday my testimony will have an impact on them and also sister Beatrice I went there as a messenger to deliver my book praise God which introduces brother branham's and then if they'll just read it it will show it right down through the scripture so I went there as not just a a worshipper I wasn't worshipper but I was also a messenger praise God now how can you do that because I'm kind to them I want to be kind of family I want to be kind to denominational people uh and all times cuz this in church I don't know who's gonna be saved and who's not we don't know who's gonna be saved my brother man told us he said never make yourself odd to be a Christian he said just tell everybody how much you love Jesus amen make yourself a fanatic we already said we already stick out like a sore thumb because of the way we dress right we already stick out let's not let's not raise our nose like we're better than anybody we're not we're still saved by the same grace they are now it's different that we've just we just continued on into the Promised Land praise God they might be on their way but we cross over amen so we should be glad they're on their way they may never get where you get but they got if they got out of Egypt praise God amen they're out of slavery hallelujah it might be go through some hot trials in the desert it might be really struggling with your skinny jeans this must be a really hot temptation these people God have mercy on their souls ah I don't know I don't know how they do it I don't know how they get past that I remember a few of them fine it you know but we want to be kind and church remember like Bobo says your your actions speak way louder than your words amen just my wife and the six jurors six girls walking in there with dresses on it my son and I with ties and shirts and looking like we're dressing that speaks louder than anything I could say praise God you can tell look at their faces I can tell I look their faces are something strange something happened they know we're different praise God but I just tried to encourage them the best we can because that's what a brother would do a brother would be kind to them how many got a college education here sister Naomi get one okay guys have a college education now which one of you with the college education would ever look down on one of the children because you don't have a college education which one do you think well I'm the way smarter you know look how great I am you know let me handle that problem because I got a college degree you know we all that means is we just spent more time in the school you know sitting at the desk taking more tests than you did but that doesn't make us any better I know but they men can try do a lot more things for this EDS better than I could I know for a fact bank and I'm I may have more credits than value at a school but that doesn't mean anything it just means that I know more about my job than he knows about my job that makes sense but he knows more about his job than I know about his job thank God and that's hard look at it like the denomination's praise God we just got a different training we just we've been trained longer the Word of God amen as far as deeper we've been we've seen the teachers notes praise God we got the answers to the task they even had the Ramson we got the devil we got the answer to the devil's question they don't have the answers to the devil's question but we got the answers the answer is the Living Word of God amen take the promises and take search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me we've got the devil's answers because we've got the revelation of the word that defeats him at every one of his tricks praise God they don't have the answers partly because they don't want them because he said whosoever will let him come and drink it's freely given to all of us so church that's what we have to have let's have faith that someday God will bring our brothers and sisters in that's faith someday God will bring them in let's show kindness to them while they're out there forever like I told that one brother Randy Merton you know Simon just since I would told me he he said he knew Randy was watching his post so with brotherly kindness he posted that in order to stir them up and that Facebook post from Simon one is so restored his soul back to the faith that's kindness instead of instead of preaching against him or railing against him he had kindness to him and keep giving on more opportunities more opportunities and then finally our brother came back in thank the Lord that's a good example hallelujah I'm never gonna get to my text here I got okay wow 16 minutes now this is the second stage of sanctification that's right this is the last stage of sanctification sorry now the Greek word you know means Philadelphia and this means love of the brothers or sisters the love which Christians cherish for each other as brethren now remember brother may have identified the Philadelphian church age because of all the outreach that they did two men in particular did tremendous missionary work William Carey I preached on it a couple years ago 2017 and Livingstone I think it was Scott Livingstone Carrie Carrie started a foundation I believe in Europe and then they raised they they raised thousands of dollars and millions of dollars and they would send he and he himself was the first one to go to India and started processing the heathens and they there their record is spending millions of dollars to send missionaries and Bibles and books to make schools and church God use schools did you ever know that the Old Testament had a school the prophets that godly men that came out of there did you know the messenger Martin came out of a school did you know st. Patrick who was Martin's nephew came out of a school in other words what I'm saying is any fellowship where you're in with Holy Ghost field people is a school this is a school phrase God go Ram taught it just the seven seals he said he said you've been the best class you could ever been God amen it's a school you're learning you're being taught God's word amen and so living Carey started many schools of over in India which they still go to this day now we don't believe in denominational schools but any fellowship as we'd say as a school it's a learning opportunity right because you're learning and then Scott livings Livingstone I'm sorry David Livingstone that Scott he's known as David Livingstone he went down into the deepest parts of Africa he was the first one that in the the age of the the friendly love went deep in Africa started many churches with many signs wonders and miracles that's why that age is called the age of brotherly love also they had just had the printing press invented the movable-type and they print off hundreds of thousands of millions of tracks and that was the age Jesus called the age of the open door see the whole world was opened up praise God and the missionaries went everywhere in the world praise God and so the best way Jesus could describe that church age was the caught brotherly kindness but you and I I get a special anointing of that right before the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you and I will have love for our brothers and sisters we will cherish each other as brethren I was gonna say this later mama st. now Church it's it's it's gonna feel different between men and women right in other words brother amen should feel my love way more than his wife right right in other words let me say like this sisters don't let brothers talk to you too long right it's not your husband you know I mean in other words I should have walk up to someone that's not my wife and just talk to them the whole time and give them attention and you know you don't I mean flirt with them or something like that so see what I'm saying you know because remember even in some countries they have brothers or sisters sit on different sides of the churches don't they sister now we seen on your head because they respect that line so much they respect the difference between male and female but as far as sacrifice yeah should be able to sacrifice my time and do the Bible study if sister who once won with brother amen I would minister them you know and likewise with any sister so you know I just want to make sure I say that specifically before my time runs out which it just seems it goes must be the summer time it must make it go faster this beautiful sunshine so see you are gonna strongly love your Christian family more than everybody else it's true it's true the Bible tells us plainly let's read it a Galatians 6:10 I don't have can you pull up there we'll just reading a few scriptures some of the easier real familiar with true disciples of Jesus Christ fervently love their church family fervently love them now Galatians 6:10 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so church you know when we're together we have lots of opportunities to be good to each other right lots cuz we see each other three or four times a week you know three at least hopefully you know some less some more so we should find opportunities to do something good for our family you know there'll be Express of course in different ways when Jesus said in John 13:35 all men shall know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another so sinners will have to look at our church and say they really love one another praise God they're willing to gather you know three nights and oh sorry Sunday or sorry Friday Sunday for church services they're willing to they're willing you guys wash each other's dirty feet well I try to wash it beforehand right before you come to church now I don't always do that so brothers forgive me if I don't sometimes I put you through it ahead i watch my toes real good but the fact is that we laugh at that but the fact is a lot of churches don't do that they don't humble themselves and wash one another's feet but it's a great reminder that I am your servant for they men I am your servant if I can help you you got you have to please let me know and let me the Holy Spirit let me know that I can help you sisters you are your your your one another servants and God help us especially in America help us to always remember we serve one another we're here to help one another and that's why the way sinners should know that were true disciples of Christ like how many times have I shared it with you know Wendy's testimony of driving three half hours just to come to our church and people their eyes literally you know bug out of their face you know like they drive three hours that well there must be something special about that because there's many churches she passes there must be something about this church that's real special to her right you and everybody passes numerous churches to go to this one right I know I do what is it there's something special about God's people praise God they have they have a harmony as we saw on Sunday they got a unity of mind they all think the same way praise God they want to see Jesus returning they want to see Jesus in their lives now and they want to see Jesus in the air amen praise God we want to see them now and every service and every every day of our lives and our fellowships and we want to see it mostly in the air praise God because most won't see them in the air right most will see them at the white throne I want to see him in the air praise God that's our that's my desire that's what I'm living for praise God so see brother Titus is the last thing you get before God officially puts you into his family he's got to make sure that you are gonna treat his family the right way praise God I wrote this in the book I said it's as if God is saying I gratias they built you up into a godly spiritual being but before I officially adopt you into my family by the seal the Holy Ghost I'm giving you brother kindness so you will serve and love my other children that I've adopted that's what I wrote but that in the book by God's grace Oh to make sure you're gonna serve the body help the body not harm the body so the last anointing he gives you is a desire to love everybody in the church praise God now we know the Scriptures love is gonna continually decrease right Matthew 24:12 because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold I've heard that a few times the last few scriptures Paul said Paul and Paul says where that love is going to go love for God is gonna go way down but love in general is going to go to two other things love to south and love to pleasures okay so there's either there's one of those three things you can love either God yourself or pleasures let's love God and if you love God you'll love God's children hey grace why we shouldn't love ourselves more than God we shouldn't love pleasures more than God we must love God above all things like I said there's nothing wrong with the pleasure of liking ice cream once a week there's nothing wrong with that brother man I talked about pies and eating cherry pies you got all kinds of chocolates every year for Christmas I mean there's nothing wrong with you know what so a couple of times a week have a little pleasure for the flesh but we know we're talking about a pleasure that denies the word any worldly pleasure that makes people deny the word and get evil spirits and disobey God's Word that's the kind of pleasure we don't want praise God just little simple pleasures in life but it's actually pleasure that becomes an idol and becomes so great that the worship of God is dismissed and decreased we see the love of God should increase praise God hallelujah like like Paul Rader said I'm taking care of God's man I'll go first class if I'm gonna if I'm dying from from tiredness and I got a headache I need to take care of God's man a little bit praise the Lord oh I love that coke now look pull up first oh she's out can you do Lydia first Thessalonians 3:12 just to save some time the world is gonna decrease their love for God with Church we have to let God increase our love for him in other words you've got to yehliu not have to you the guy just look at this now look the Lord make you is God gonna make you love him more no in other words it's not gonna force you to be a better Christian no he can't force you or else you're a mindless dumb robot I use that word but a mindless unintelligent robot say like that I don't like to use that word you forgive me but see we have to understand what it's saying the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another toward all men even as we do toward you in other words he's saying let God increase your love because God can't do anything outside your will he can only do what you let him do praise God so in other words yield your will to his and God will cause you to grow in love hey glory see guys aren't gonna make you go to the rapture guys not gonna make someone go to hell do you let some choose whatever they want so we have to make sure we read the scripture the right way thanks Lydia and thanks in case you're are you sweet helping appreciate then see the world is going to decrease and love but our love should increase so see Turk that's why that scripture your first love is so important you know and if this is right if this is right then we should go something our first love should increase praise God I don't know if I'm saying it not maybe the Lord could help me your first love is a great portion of love but if you got if you're praying for this your first love should be more loving Amen I don't know how to say it I'm just uh I'm too educated I'll say like that maybe I know steady words enough I need to be good more in the dictionary not dictionary the Bible that's the dictionary I got to be in but you understand you know we shouldn't be living in our second love or a lukewarm state we should be on fire for the Lord we're gonna guess we're gonna vote we got any like we said last week we're going to constantly battle we might be impatient at times you might be a little too sensual a time but all you have to do is say God forgive me restore the joy of my salvation bring that first love back and then increase my love again oppa a man I've seen over doors for the Lord now since what well I gave my heart Lord a night mm I'll just say for 20 years I've seen it go up and down but it's on a steady increase i like the stock market i like that we're making spiritual gains though that's right he's gonna go through mountains and valleys right ups and downs but we're steadily increasing upward praise God that's our trend or trending upward amen it's it's true you know even writing this book I have such a burn to do it I know it's the Holy Spirit cuz preachers have told me I couldn't do it I don't know how you do it that's a huge job how could you well the Holy Spirit so the more on summer they men the more I think about the book that less I think about you know things I should probably be doing there's like other jobs you know like oh yeah choosing somebody to do a memory verse for July just forget about that because the whole time thinking about is God's Word and so forgive me if I forget little things like that but you know finding God's will for your life is the crucial thing and we'll have a whole series on that - it's a beautiful topic we'll see we should see our love increasing when and if our love increases our submission increases praise God in other words we do what God wants us to do praise God instead of what we want to do because we're not so much like it's living for other people amen praise God now in the book I put a I'm have to go a little bit longer than I think maybe my watch is broken I need to get a new watch throw this thing on there I I you know I just felt a lot of the Holy Spirit I wrote this chapter months and months this might been a year ago to put a section there if you have brotherly kindness you will locate and live for your Christian family you will not be a lone ranger Christian I had a person comment on my latest YouTube video this week and they said oh the Holy Spirit led me out of my home church and I just sit home and play tapes and I said I doubt very much sir that the Holy Spirit led you out of there because you're not part of a body and the Holy Spirit says gather Moors you see that Day approaching and the Bible says the five bold preaching ministry will perfect your faith and bring unity to the faith of the bride it literally says that till we all come in the knowledge and the unity of the faith until where's God far as I can tell we're not all unified quite yet we're getting close okay Evan brother Brooks Adan Jim and all these wonderful Saints we're very very close we're more unified than ever praise God it's true with our doctrine with our love but you're not going to have broadly kindness and run away from God's family you're gonna run to God's family as member Christ's custom was to be in the synagogue every sabbath day in other words there's forty minutes but i've nobody little further it's only eight o'clock how did that happen mercy I'm gonna give myself 30 extra minutes yeah somebody or something messed up with my watch this is just I must have pressed the wrong button or something anyways the Lord Jesus Christ God in the flesh his custom was to always be in church that was his example acts 20 verse 7 in case you can you put up there on the first week the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached to them and he continued his speech till midnight till midnight he preached till now the thing is we don't know what he started for in this case he preached him midnight and after midnight actually after midnight and so see that's that zeal of having you know no you know he's gonna leave soon he's got to get he said later he said I taught them the whole Council of God he knew there was part of the word of God he had the cover before he left so he preached really really long but you see first week Sunday that's why we gather Sunday that's why we break bread that's why we have communion that's why we preach sometimes love that's why we come together so much because Jesus did it constantly Paul did it constantly it's the example as set forth in the scripture Jesus can you go to Matthew 9:36 huh Jesus looked at the multitudes with no pastors and then he urged the disciples to pray for God to send laborers amen I'm laboring in the word of God and doctrine that's Scripture building a doctrine is labor it's not easy there's lots of scriptures to go through there's lots of things you have to rightly divide and take out and put in the Bible cause the labor took my own horn I'm just saying like it's a position I've caught up and called to it praise God see what he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and they were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd they never pasture they were just scattered abroad they really have somebody guiding them they follow Jesus or they'd have someone there just to be a shepherd that verse 37 they said his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few next one pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest Jesus doesn't like to see people wandering without a shepherd and this man tells me the Holy Spirit let him do it I doubt that very much unless he that about to spank him and chase it at birth awhile so he can send them back in get the evil spirit off take him out get an evil spirit off and send him back in maybe that was it I don't know but look at Jesus he said pray you brothers need to pray that they'll be labor sent out who will feed these sheep praise God in other words I need somebody with brotherly kindness someone who's concerned about the souls of the people to make sure that they hear the truth of God and not some live from Hell or some televangelists or some headquarters right just taking orders from headquarters letting man rule over men but to make sure seen someone labor to feed them God's Word constantly and if they eat it and if they exercise they'll grow up in a real spiritual army of God amen hallelujah thank the Lord see harvests and preachers for a harvest that's why after he finally sat down in heaven Jesus he sent down five gifts to the church he sent them he ordained it praise God remember these gifts the fivefold ministry promotes precise truth unity and it keeps you church from immaturity doubt hesitation and deception you ought to be thankful for this local church it keeps you from being deceived think about where you'd be think about the church you're at before you came to this church now some of you might have good churches by God's grace but I know I you know before the message I didn't have some good at churches I've been very deceived in those churches because even let you divorce remarry as long as you spoke in tongues you're good you're good remember that was I'm another suicide missed testimony on YouTube this week it was so awesome after he first got saved he walked in there he was so on fire God but he would see the church members speak in tongues and then go do these sins and Simon's like how can I without the gift of tongues how can I live a more holy life than these people got miracles and speaking in tongues sounds like it don't make any sense the sign went to the pastor he said pastor you needed preached against it in the pastor it's assigned to one in the closet for three months every every night he said after work before like in bed said God send me the truth I don't care what it looks like I don't care what I have to do as long as I'm as long as I got truth I'll believe it and then God knocked down those two those two towers to fall and to shake people up and Simon got invited the Bible study the rest is history God showed him the truth it didn't matter what it doesn't matter who's around or how big the group how small the group how humble the group is as long as it was truth I want to be one of those race God that's the truth look for holiness remember Paul said follow those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart hey people that are pure spiritually love God hard to find so because of our local church I believe you're not your mature you got faith you're not doubting you're not hesitating and you're not deceived I know you know there's five things or to go with before I close there's just five simple scriptures Church on how you can love your local church and I'll go through each one I'll try to just share a few comments here okay so the first one I had here I just going over the scriptures was meeting their physical needs now the early church acts 6:1 case you can you pull it up there now I'm going to share a literal example of this here in just a moment because the people never no longer come to our church and in those days when the number of disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration AC membra these people don't have freezers like we got they didn't have refrigerators so they couldn't store food right so every day there was widows that believed the message but they needed food delivered to them every day imagine that kind like your children right deliver food every day calicos Aldi workers are gonna get to deliver their groceries every day right kinda like that you have to make sure it's got like a parent they had two parents over the adults these widows didn't have any food and so every day they got to talk about meals on wheels how many know what meals on wheels is talking about that's exactly what it was just no wheels just meals every day these poor Christians verse two then the twelve called the multitude disciples of them said is not me I'm sorry is that reason that we should leave the Word of God and serve tables so no they never said it you know we don't we don't believe in giving people food they believed in it so in other words I'm trying to say some people's job in the church is to just help the poor people that can be your job thankfully at this point over our church I don't know anybody that is from with finances but if there was you know that's why when we had to so people come in the past you saw me with them a lot drive them to church I would buy them groceries because they needed food and their coming to church that's the Christian thing to do praise God you and I can't say we're Christians and say we're going to meet someone's spiritual needs if we don't meet their physical needs first right James says if you see someone cold and say go be warm but you don't give them a coat your faith is dead praise God that's why first we must look at our local assembly to see who has physical needs now how many member when sister Kahn used to come well she got sick and got laid off or something couldn't work for the errand gave me a check I'm not gonna say them out but it was multiple hundreds of dollars I just announced it over the pulpit you know she's out of work he just come up and give this big old check and I mailed it and let her know it was coming but she never cashed it I mean just and to me like that was such like childlike faith right and our brother was on fire for a while we know we have differences now but that to me that was like such childlike faith and not and so he must have had extra right you know which is understandable right so there's sometimes we have extra sometimes we don't I just want to use that as a simple example and we hear somebody struggling let's try to do something right away to help out let me say that again you know we had that fellowship for a couple weeks ago and I asked at the beginning I said does anybody know anybody that doesn't have food or clothing in the church and every said no we're not aware of it so just so you know I'm asking about everybody how you ask about everybody you know do they have it or not if not let's get it for them because that is our job our job is to make sure the physical needs are met first praise God think about even with Elijah member Elijah and the widow woman she's like we're gonna die he's like go make me a cake first well we're just gonna die we got one meal left he said she said he said put God first in other words he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you meet my physical needs first your spiritual needs see you if we're gonna be Christians we have to find we have to look and see people in our church you like when the coronavirus it I asked Amen and bang and different ones they got laid off I just want to know like I want you have any you need anything let me know if you need anything that's why we're here is to help people with their physical needs so how many want to just I don't say lord help my ears to be open you know sister Naomi here your dad got that shirt for that brother who used to come I've emailed him multiple times asking for his mailing address I could mail two people give it to me so just say you know I'm trying and I want to send them you know some cash and I knew he's out of it fine fine brother but I just can't get an address yeah I should I should have text people in the church used to go to that might be a better idea I just thought that now so you try you you you tried to meet the needs of people so they can worship the Lord because once your physical needs are met then of course that opens up you know get your focus off that and get your focus on God the spiritual things of God now for times sake I'll go to the next one you should have you and I should have radical forgiveness towards fellow Christians like 490 times a day radical in other words like 500 times a day forgive me if I make a mistake 500 times a day that's astounding you know a Peter set out to that he he said oh that's easy Lord no he didn't he said Lord increase our faith right he's they all Jesus that's easy he said God you better give me some more faith in other words you better give me more of a nice day ain't ahead if I'm gonna forgive my brother 500 times a day I better have more Holy Spirit strength cuz right now I know I don't have the strength to do that this is brotherly kindness this is the example program gifts for brotherly kindness and church think about we get all bent out of shape out of one mistake one thing somebody does one thing wrong oh right Jesus says it's way beyond that now of course when we repent right we repent yeah weak but in our flesh if we're if we're if we're caught in that moment of being in the flesh it's hard it can be hard but see God gives us he does increase our faith praise God he does increase the anointing remember Jesus gave the parable in Matthew 18 of the unmerciful servant Jesus forgives our sins that are so great we should be able to give people sin debts that are so tiny in comparison remember he was like the guy was forgiving of like one hundred thousand pounds or something and then he can't forgive somebody of like a hundred pounds one thing we should have is radical forgiveness in our church remember Philemon story I'll just read out of here Paul requested that Philemon offer generous forgiveness to a Inessa mmus his former slave now this Inessa miss had ran away from a slave owner Philemon that it cost him a lot of money you know slaves were very expensive that cost him a lot of labour too and Paul says I've led him to Christ he and he said now he's profitable to both of us and Paul says receive him as a brother and lay his debt on my account Oh talk about a Christian active dude how much would it cost us to somebody to load a part-time employee cost to clean your house all year what do you think I'll just make a guess how about $30,000 part-time boss say and that's not even the cost to buy the person that's just the yearly value he said take that 30,000 or bit let's say 50,000 put that 50,000 and put it on my account I'll pay it off now that's real Christian forgiveness right there don't hold it against him you know he's broken your trust how many ever had their trust trust broken yeah you bought this servant you know he's supposed to he told you he's going to stay there but he lied and he ran away Church let's be a church of giving second and third chances fourth we go up to 500 let's be a church where we give people more chances I'm not saying purposely be hurt now there are times we do have to like Jesus said on Sunday with goddess there are some times you have to be used despitefully used on purpose okay there are so many God will lead you to that or the God will just allow it to happen well I'm saying like don't let yourself be abused right you know better I hope everyone derstand what I'm saying but let's be a church that gives second and third chances now it's different in our day because in our day we all got cars and we can drive around to any church or in the message there's new worries just within an hour - there's numerous message churches so people can leave on church and just be happy the other one but those days they couldn't do that so some cities just had one church and so that person would sin they couldn't go to another church they couldn't stay at home they must they got to go back and make it right that's a real example of Christianity third has increased your gathering - I preach on this all the time so you're familiar with Hebrews 10 24 and 25 but I will read Romans 12:16 can you put that up there when we have fellowships or what do we have guess try to condescend to the less popular Christians it's okay to go say hi to the guest preacher yea spend some time talking on the guest preacher but make sure according to Romans 12:16 make sure you find the people that don't get talked to very much now be careful like I said like I wouldn't go to specific women and just spend a lot of time but I might in passing shake their hand and move on you know what I mean because I don't want to look like I'm doing anything evil avoid all parents of evil to see being the same night one to another might not high things but condescend see humble yourself to the lowest state the less popular or Christians being out why in your own conceits this is early kindness right it's easy you want to go hang around the guest preacher I know what that's like it's easy you want to go be with the guest preacher's wife you know that's easy thing to do and that's okay to do but Paul says don't forget to humble yourself if your brother if you have brotherly kindness and you really cherish the whole body of Christ you'll want to spend time with the popular ones and then unpopular ones because the unpopular ones still have a portion of God's Spirit that you love right there's still something if there are the message that they got though the ghost there's still something real special about them that's right you know James I'll go to James to you know this was a trouble in the early church and you know that and Naomi told me this trouble is something in some churches in Ghana if you serve people a certain amount of money just spend time with those people you got the same amount of money you're rich you hang out with the rich if you're poor you hang out with the poor same thing happens in America same thing happens it does certainly does James to 1 to 9 I'm gonna I - yes to one tonight yeah look at verse 2 for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and goodly apparel and their coming also a poor man and bow raiment and you have respect him that where the gate clothing is they didn't sit now here in a good place and say to the poor stand now here or sit here under my footstool are you not then partial in yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts hearken my beloved brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he had promised them they love it Paul says it normally works opposite what we think we think the guy with the big ring and the nice jacket we think he's the one that's got so much faith James says it's usually the poor people in the message that have the thing and the church said usually it's the poor why because they need God right they they gotta have got every day I got it I'm calling out on the scene everyday for my general necessities I'm not trusting in these fleeting riches I'm trusting in eternal riches amen James says it usually works the opposite so this is an example of what burly kindness will produce you will see you will want to be around the least popular Christians I'm thinking about sharing somebody's testimony about better not I know people are listening I'll just say like this there are some people or some churches I love going to and they're not very attractive looking I've talked about brothers now and they're not very nice to look at they don't have a lot of money but I tell you I feel the love of the Holy Ghost on those people and I love spending time with some of those people and then the rich and the esteemed and the so sometimes there's the snobbiest people you want to be around and I wonder are they even born again right so honestly church if you condescend to the lower less popular people you probably have a better time rather than that less mind battle soon cuz this let's say a Spears all those rich people might jump on you oh you're better than other people not better than anybody praise God we're all saved by the grace of God and we're all a part of a body that needs every person like on Sunday I needed Beatrice to hold Genevieve until I got back from getting the coffee's everybody right is she and she stayed with you that was great I needed that just a small example you know but we all need everybody's important pray everybody has a part praise God brother Bob says the preacher is the least of all because he's the servant of all so I need you more than you need me maybe that's just my opinion but we're swell I'm supposed to be a servant give my time get my energy give everything I can to the people now remember church jesus said you only get blessed when you have a fellowship when you invite people now you get blessed with fellowship with Christians but he said you'll get more blessed when you only invite the people that can't pay you back they can't invite you over to a fellowship jesus said when you have a meal inviting the poor the maimed the the blind the halt and the blind because they cannot repay you so let's consider that as we go I know I know in our society like there's not evil people out there right so we there's a lot of crazy people we probably don't host a lot of free meals at our homes right but let's be open just to think of our friends that are struggling and maybe have them or maybe just take them a meal that's the same thing have to come to your house you can take them a meal just I just want to get back to some basics of Christianity's if I understand what I'm saying like these are real examples of chryses what Christians do they pray they give alms they fasten it they love other Christians and this is what a lot of people don't do in the message so we want to be what the Bible says were to be and be real message believers praise God okay good five minutes okay yeah so we're impartial towards socio-economic status we don't favor rich or richer we love everybody in the church praise God no got two more things I'm sorry yeah one more thing as far as the things we're going through Christians need to pray for one another Ephesians 6:18 says a fully-armored Christian prays always with all prayer and supplication of spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints all the saints you know Sunday and Wednesday it's a good time to pray for everything the church Wednesdays usually the day where I pray for the minister's you know I think that other brothers they're laboring on the win not a camera I have worked all day and I think Lord shrinking brother can anoint him tonight for God's glory just praying for one another when you hear when we hear of Christians suffering persecution we should feel their pain and care enough to pray for them first Corinthians 12 25 and 26 says that there should be no schism in the body there's no division but that the members should have the same care one for another whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it so seaters that's where we have to be so in tune with people's feelings that's why I told you before I can go to being so happy for Christians and then so sad because I hear about Christians dying or people having struggles overseas like your heart can break within the matter of your moments you can rejoice because somebody else has a good testimony or God does something great for somebody it's just it's being able to feel for the entire body of Jesus Christ now one more I want to read this here go to Psalms 12 verse 6 last one this is beautiful now you know the statute over man is a little different doctrine because it kind of brings a little different numerology right Bible numerology you know we know there's three works of grace but in those three works there are seven works in the three so I don't understand that yet but with the stature of a man there's seven anointings and then the eight caps it all office seals it all in which is kind of strange but we know eight represents a new beginning or the first all over or eternity look what the scripture says I'm I was just when I was writing this chapter I was just praying God send me a scripture that I can see clearly the stature of a perfect man amen the words of the Lord our pure pure words as silver how many times has tried a silver trying the furnace of Earth purified seven times now that's silver what about gold right this is silver so Redemption right silver represents Redemption right the silver that had to be paid for each soul each so all the silver shekels the men had to pay to redeem their souls to the tabernacle have to preach a whole separate sermon on that but silver always represents Redemption gold represents deity no so in other words in order to finish your purification your Redemption you got to be burned or fired seven times praise God faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness see so brother bang always wanted all these years why the Scriptures lot lay it lay like that in the scripture because it's the point to the revelation of God for this day he said great is the mystery of godliness it's not a small mystery it's a great mystery praise God how do I become godly how do I become like God how can I have the character of Jesus Christ you must be purified seven times seven anointings see you must reject those seven devices of Satan and if you concur if you get purified seven times then they will cap you off with the eighth one praise God charity which is what we'll look at next time by the grace of God let's say in our feet thanks for let me go over by God's grace it's only 8:30 so doing pretty good we're only gonna talk till 10:30 anyway so that's okay just kidding by God's grace let's have our musicians come sorry I should invite you guys early you've got song on your husband someone's purify their song I'm singing about yeah every fighters fight a church after all that reason I just preached you know what thirteen sermons so far the stats perfect I'm not done I got a few more and then we'll get to these really these are really good chapters coming up I I so enjoyed sitting under the anointing below this curve to see how the Scriptures for the will of God and they have max this is no faster think about that God wants a purify your unbelief away who to take your hypocrisy when your reasoning sent you out hate the irreverence and the selfishness help us to see if there's any needs in our church right now I don't know help us to see them our needs physical needs and also do not open up our hearts to they say our denominational brothers [Music] I can't [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] yes let's pray look for community centers places where we can just not let our right hand know what I'm not handsome I just shoot over this week Jesus said blow a trumpet race [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] - - community centers I just always shoppers somewhere where we can just be a little messy [Music] [Music] to our other brothers and sisters whether spiritually or natural whether those who some [Music] [Music] all of us I'm sure love to give [Music]
