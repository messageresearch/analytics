[29:11] amen God bless you as you're being
[29:12] seated praise God
[29:16] Hallelujah
[29:22] so I could look at part four here
[29:24] tonight of this little series here on
[29:26] the seven Church ages
[29:28] and Trust would be a blessing to you
[29:31] uh this week I think yesterday I put out
[29:33] the video about uh the question they had
[29:35] about
[29:36] um divorce but random said thus say to
[29:38] the Lord you know a man could divorce
[29:39] his wife if she cut her hair you know so
[29:41] I put that video out yesterday
[29:44] um try to explain it as best I could by
[29:46] the grace of God so if you'd like to
[29:48] listen to that one I got that one out I
[29:50] got a lot of good or some numerous good
[29:51] comments on it one one person disliked
[29:54] it but everybody else seemed to like it
[29:55] by God's grace so
[29:56] the point is that you know in that
[29:58] statement it looked like brother Brown
[29:59] was just rebuking the people and he was
[30:01] showing you know the severity of
[30:03] Dishonor
[30:04] it remember it's just as much of a
[30:06] dishonor if a man doesn't cut his hair
[30:08] as a woman cutting her hair
[30:09] the Bible says it's vile for man doesn't
[30:12] cut his hair
[30:13] and the Bible says it's a dishonor if a
[30:15] woman cuts her hair which means a
[30:18] repulse like you think of like the a
[30:20] moment you're disgusted right you look
[30:22] at some like rotten food or something
[30:23] you know you're just repulsable that's
[30:25] what it is when a woman cuts her hair
[30:27] that's what it is when a man grows his
[30:29] hair out that dishonors not just you
[30:32] know not just the person but then each
[30:33] each of the headships all the way up to
[30:35] God Almighty the invisible spirit so
[30:38] um I was looking this year you know all
[30:40] the things God has had me put on YouTube
[30:41] and I was just I was rejoicing like wow
[30:43] we've tackled some or by God's grace
[30:44] we've tackled some controversial
[30:46] subjects this year and a lot of people
[30:48] have been helped so I thought well
[30:49] praise God there's a time and season for
[30:51] everything and it started last of
[30:53] Thanksgiving with brother William
[30:54] remember brother when we were talking
[30:55] about ministers marriage requirements
[30:56] remember that at my house I don't know
[30:58] if you remember but we talked about that
[31:00] we were talking about I like to put a
[31:01] video out about this you remember that
[31:02] so I just we prayed about it and felt
[31:05] led to do it so I know it's helped many
[31:06] people
[31:08] well let's look at this here for about
[31:09] 40 minutes we'll try to preach 40
[31:10] minutes if we can you know my wife my
[31:12] wife keeps reminding me that I I
[31:14] preached a little longer each time you
[31:15] know
[31:16] and she does that because I I kind of
[31:18] complain like my voice is sore you know
[31:21] so it wouldn't be sore if I didn't
[31:22] preach as long so so God is good and I
[31:26] got my timer here hopefully that'll work
[31:27] out tonight by God's grace
[31:29] uh you know we've gone through the part
[31:31] three parts here and right now we're in
[31:33] the section of how the messengers are
[31:35] identified and their names so in the
[31:38] next section uh brother Bama actually
[31:39] teaches us in the church age book there
[31:41] are three requirements every preacher
[31:43] has to meet now that's on top of I think
[31:46] there's like 18 the book of First
[31:47] Timothy you know they have to be uh
[31:50] hospitable the Bible said husband of one
[31:53] wife you know all those and then brother
[31:55] Ram says there's three general ones uh
[31:58] also that you can see through Paul's
[32:00] Ministry they are teaching the true word
[32:02] of God
[32:04] powerful manifestations of the written
[32:06] and spoken word
[32:08] and third Soul winning
[32:10] those are three evidences again are
[32:13] requirements that a preacher has to have
[32:16] now in this case he's talking about the
[32:17] church age Messengers and boy I can't
[32:19] wait to preach some of them because they
[32:20] have some really powerful testimonies
[32:21] just some amazing you know defying the
[32:24] laws of nature uh you know uh being uh
[32:29] being martyred you know burned at the
[32:30] stake
[32:31] freely giving up their lives just
[32:33] amazing testimonies that they have these
[32:36] Church age Messengers you know winning
[32:37] almost a whole cotton or not a whole
[32:39] continent but a whole country to Christ
[32:40] almost a whole country one to Christ I'm
[32:43] just amazing testimonies about the power
[32:45] of Jesus Christ in these messages no
[32:47] wonder he called them Stars
[32:49] because they shine so bright with the
[32:52] power of Jesus Christ just like brother
[32:54] random praise God hallelujah amen now in
[32:58] Paul's life let's look at these three in
[32:59] Paul's life he was true to the word so
[33:01] much so he was so true to God's word
[33:03] that he went and rebuked Peter face to
[33:05] face when Peter separated himself from
[33:07] the the Gentiles a man that had seen
[33:10] Jesus face to face
[33:11] Paul said I haven't seen him face to
[33:13] face but I met him by the Holy Spirit
[33:15] praise God
[33:16] so again showed the power that he had
[33:18] with the word of God he was true to the
[33:20] word no matter who he had to rebuke
[33:22] and and I think we're a good example of
[33:24] that our little church praise God Amen
[33:25] we can take on debates or we can take on
[33:27] anybody whatever and the word of God
[33:30] will stand that's why we're not afraid
[33:31] because God's word will never fail
[33:33] praise God hallelujah Paul said anyone
[33:36] who altered the gospel was cursed and
[33:39] then he charged Timothy to invest all
[33:42] his time look at think about this invest
[33:43] all your time rightly dividing the word
[33:46] of Truth
[33:47] okay so let's read that I like to read
[33:49] that if you pull it up there
[33:50] um
[33:51] that was uh
[33:54] second Timothy 2 15. if I'm not mistaken
[33:56] second Timothy 2 15.
[33:58] give all your time think about that he's
[34:00] telling a pastor to give everything
[34:02] you've got to rightly dividing the word
[34:04] of truth that must mean if he's going to
[34:06] give his whole time to it that must be
[34:08] there's there's a lot of partial truths
[34:10] out there and the man of God has got to
[34:12] go find the real truth in it praise God
[34:15] he says studies to show thyself approved
[34:18] unto God a Workman that needeth not to
[34:20] be ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[34:23] Truth it is absolute work to find the
[34:26] rightly divided word of Truth praise God
[34:28] hallelujah but God has ministers who
[34:31] will strive to do that by the grace of
[34:33] God now uh Paul told Timothy give
[34:37] yourself holy to that in first Timothy 4
[34:39] we're not going to go there but notice
[34:41] Paul said any spiritual person would
[34:44] recognize that God's word came out of
[34:47] him and should thus be obeyed sure
[34:50] now think about all these people that
[34:51] say oh Paul's a woman hater
[34:53] or Paul's legalistic I've had church
[34:55] friends tell me that
[34:57] that Paul was legalistic and how could
[34:59] that be but Paul says anyone who's
[35:01] spiritual will know that the word of God
[35:04] came out of him praise God now what's
[35:06] amazing to me brother William is that at
[35:07] the end of his life he could say all
[35:09] those churches in Asia had rejected me
[35:11] so how spiritual were they
[35:14] they weren't very spiritual they could
[35:15] receive it at first but then by the time
[35:17] Paul was going off the scene around 67
[35:19] A.D they just rejected him he was in
[35:22] prison he looked like he was he lost his
[35:23] ministry brother Adam says demon said
[35:25] forsaken him all these people he just
[35:27] looked like he was fading away my
[35:29] brother brother Adam said he wasn't
[35:31] baiting away he was actually in the
[35:33] perfect will of God Amen he was doing
[35:35] what God had called him to do he was a
[35:37] witness in the prisons amen he was
[35:39] writing the Bible in prison amen
[35:41] hallelujah amen God had to hide him away
[35:43] in a prison cell amen so you and I could
[35:46] have this wonderful uh Bible here with
[35:48] the truth of God that are Eternal and
[35:50] can never change amen so God had to hide
[35:53] him away in a prison God hide me away
[35:55] Hallelujah so I can know you better
[35:57] praise God
[35:58] hide me away a little a hole in the wall
[36:00] Church in Akron so I can know you better
[36:03] because it's not about money it's not
[36:05] about popularity it's about Christ it's
[36:08] about purity it's about Holiness praise
[36:10] God
[36:11] amen
[36:13] he said what came the word of God out
[36:15] from you or came it unto you only if any
[36:17] man think himself to be a prophet or
[36:19] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[36:22] things that I write unto you are the
[36:24] Commandments of the Lord what a
[36:26] statement praise God so all true
[36:27] preachers will be as true as possible to
[36:31] the original word of God that Paul had
[36:33] amen now the second one here is uh Power
[36:36] of the written and spoken word Paul was
[36:40] powerful with the spoken word he cast
[36:42] out Devils remember he spoke to the the
[36:44] girl who had the the Divination Spirit
[36:46] he just said Satan come out of her right
[36:48] he'd come out of her
[36:50] at the right time he loudly instructed
[36:52] that impotent man to rise up and walk
[36:55] for the first time and he never even
[36:57] walked before that's power of the spoken
[36:59] word praise God and he raised up euticus
[37:01] from the dead after he fell out of the
[37:03] Second Story uh service right and late
[37:06] raised him up in the name of Jesus amen
[37:08] that's powerful but his written word was
[37:11] just as powerful
[37:12] look look what he's doing today we've
[37:14] never even met him but yet the word of
[37:16] God has completely transformed Our Lives
[37:18] amen oh my just as powerful praise God
[37:21] the written and spoken word of God
[37:25] Hallelujah and remember Brothers said
[37:27] which were his greatest Services was it
[37:29] South Africa where they had van loads of
[37:31] crutches or was it the revelation of the
[37:34] Seven Seals I think you know the answer
[37:35] praise God it was the revelation of the
[37:38] Seven Seals he said I've never worked in
[37:39] spheres as high as I've worked in these
[37:42] areas so see we have to have both we
[37:44] need the spoken word of power and we
[37:46] need the spoken written word we need the
[37:48] revelation of God Jesus gives us both
[37:50] both Spirit and the word praise God
[37:52] spirit and truth hallelujah amen
[37:55] hallelujah
[37:58] Paul's words were so powerful it caused
[38:01] the Corinthians to repent in Godly
[38:03] sorrow from his written rebukes and
[38:05] that's recorded in second Corinthians
[38:07] chapter 7. he was thankful that his
[38:09] written words were such a rebuke to them
[38:11] that they found repentance at the altar
[38:13] that's the power of the Holy Ghost man
[38:15] of God his written spoken word now
[38:18] thirdly we cannot calculate how many
[38:20] Souls Paul led to Christ but no doubt
[38:23] there's great fruit to his ministry he
[38:25] said I am nothing behind the very
[38:27] chiefest Apostle an apostle is one cent
[38:30] so out of all the Believers that all the
[38:33] apostles that were sent out Paul said I
[38:35] was he said nothing behind the chiefest
[38:37] of them so if he wasn't behind him he
[38:39] was at least equal to him right but then
[38:42] he gives us another clue he says I
[38:43] labored more abundantly than them all
[38:46] praise God and he said NADA but the
[38:48] grace of God that worketh in me may we
[38:51] let God's grace labor in our lives amen
[38:53] that's all that's all it is yielding the
[38:56] to the grace of God and then Grace will
[38:59] give you Grace will give you the
[39:00] strength to do what God's called you to
[39:01] do
[39:02] absolutely
[39:05] you know we had some more just you know
[39:08] on the on the thought of Grace we had
[39:09] some more student behaviors in our class
[39:10] this week that were crazy right
[39:13] like I've been slapped I've been spit on
[39:14] all these things we had some more crazy
[39:16] ones this week but the teachers out
[39:17] there telling me wow Mr Smith wow you're
[39:19] how do you keep control all these things
[39:21] I looked at him I said it ain't me it's
[39:22] the grace of God that's in me
[39:25] and they say oh you're such a great
[39:26] teacher I said no it's the grace of God
[39:28] that's in me see once again Grace
[39:30] because we know we're human we know we
[39:32] fall short all the time
[39:34] and we know we have these feelings these
[39:36] human feelings that come up but what
[39:38] takes over every time before something
[39:40] sinful comes out it's God's grace that
[39:42] comes out amen god holds us God keeping
[39:45] us praise God hallelujah I like what
[39:46] brother has said it wasn't me holding on
[39:48] to God it was God holding on to me
[39:50] praise God well that's just another note
[39:52] on Grace you know people can see it in
[39:54] your life church
[39:55] people on your job you're you're your
[39:57] boss out brother
[39:58] amen that's why you got favor with your
[40:01] boss amen it's God's grace amen
[40:03] hallelujah
[40:05] thank you Jesus
[40:06] and member church he labored in three
[40:09] grueling missionary trips and on those
[40:12] trips at least five times he was
[40:13] Shipwrecked
[40:15] stoned a number of times
[40:17] in the in the in the in the in the in
[40:19] the night in the water for one night he
[40:22] hung on to a piece of wood in in the
[40:24] water for a whole night
[40:27] I would have probably just let go and
[40:28] drown that's what I probably would have
[40:30] done but not this man Paul what a man of
[40:32] God hallelujah he just sat there in the
[40:34] cold water all night till he got picked
[40:36] up praise God because he knew God wasn't
[40:38] done with him yet praise God
[40:40] he labored so hard during three grueling
[40:44] missionary trips and he told those
[40:46] Corinthian Believers you are the Seal of
[40:49] my apostleship in the Lord
[40:52] praise God
[40:54] so in other words if you're called to be
[40:55] an apostle you need a Vindication the
[40:57] Vindication is the souls that God gives
[40:59] you
[41:00] Hallelujah and then he also said he said
[41:03] uh
[41:05] the the the the Philippian Believers and
[41:07] the Thessalonian Believers he said you
[41:09] are my joy and my crown
[41:12] Hallelujah is that how you see the
[41:14] Believers here are the Believers hear
[41:15] your joy praise God Hallelujah the
[41:18] Saints here ought to be your joy praise
[41:19] God Hallelujah now if you win a soul
[41:21] then that person's your joy praise God
[41:23] hallelujah
[41:24] thank God
[41:26] and that's exactly what Paul said he
[41:28] said he said you're my joy you're my
[41:31] crown see that's where that's where
[41:32] everybody gets that idea you win a soul
[41:34] it's like a jewel in your crown that's
[41:35] where that comes from
[41:36] because Paul said you are my crown the
[41:39] souls I've won you're the crown uh uh
[41:42] that God that Christ is going to place
[41:43] on my head and then Jesus and then Paul
[41:46] said I have such Godly jealousy over
[41:48] them he wants them to be chaste virgins
[41:51] of Christ in other words don't let any
[41:53] Idols in don't flirt with sin they said
[41:55] right don't flirt with anything praise
[41:57] God say totally true totally Chase holy
[42:00] Pious totally holy don't let anything
[42:02] take the place of your love for Jesus
[42:04] praise God such a Godly jealousies I'm
[42:07] jealous over the church
[42:08] I'm jealous over my converse that's how
[42:10] much he cares about them and loves them
[42:14] I don't think Paul said well let's let
[42:15] him go if they want to go you know I
[42:17] imagine Paul Zeal over them and would go
[42:19] and and plea with them and ask him to
[42:20] repent and come back praise God
[42:22] and so much so he said I make mention of
[42:25] you in all my prayers
[42:27] all my prayers I'm still trying to
[42:29] attain to that praise God hallelujah
[42:31] usually I just pray for me in my prayers
[42:32] you know the battles I'm going through
[42:34] and then the prayer requests we get in
[42:36] but that's where we want to go we want
[42:37] to get to where we're constantly praying
[42:39] for one another praise God constantly
[42:40] making mention of each one in prayer
[42:43] praise God
[42:44] that's where we we we're going by the
[42:46] grace of God so Soul winning mattered
[42:49] more to Paul than money and every
[42:51] worldly Temptation he was all about
[42:53] winning Souls gave himself to three
[42:55] grueling missionary trips praise God now
[42:58] I want to switch over here just to show
[43:00] you something here
[43:01] um you're familiar with these but I just
[43:02] want to give you a few visuals here by
[43:04] God's grace
[43:07] so uh So based upon those requirements
[43:10] right baseball and those requirements
[43:11] brother Brandon gave us these Messengers
[43:15] okay as church history demonstrates
[43:16] Jesus seven star Messengers the e-church
[43:18] age
[43:19] who meet these three messenger
[43:21] requirements were Paul iranius Columbo
[43:24] yeah Columbus Luther Wesley and brother
[43:27] Branham of course
[43:29] now the one thing that I made a video
[43:30] about this year was Columba according to
[43:32] this he didn't live even in his church
[43:34] age
[43:35] now to me that's okay because uh brother
[43:37] random said he he didn't get the dates
[43:39] from God he got the dates from
[43:41] historians
[43:42] okay and I made a video on about it and
[43:44] you should be surprised a lot of
[43:45] mastered people agree with me but a lot
[43:46] of them spoke bad about me I got like a
[43:48] 50 50 split on that one
[43:51] um that's because people just I don't
[43:52] they just don't study the scriptures I
[43:53] guess or they just don't study quotes
[43:54] like this
[43:56] he said tomorrow tomorrow night we're
[43:57] starting on the second Church age
[43:58] tonight we're starting on the first age
[44:00] I'm sure the Lord has a blessing in
[44:01] store for us remember as I said before
[44:03] sometimes on things these things we
[44:05] might disagree upon them as far as the
[44:07] theology is concerned and most of my
[44:10] dates I got from God
[44:13] no most of my dates I take from the
[44:17] authentic historians
[44:20] which really not interested in any side
[44:22] they just wrote down the facts whatever
[44:24] it was what the churches did and I of
[44:26] course the Divine part of the
[44:28] interpretation I try to place upon there
[44:30] myself the best I know how
[44:34] and the church said
[44:36] it's amazing you know people will argue
[44:38] uh tooth and nail that every word was
[44:41] thus said the Lord and we have we have
[44:43] statements like this he says I didn't
[44:45] get it I didn't I I got the dates from
[44:46] somebody else praise God right I got the
[44:49] dates from authentic historians but I
[44:51] love how program was so honest I love
[44:53] how he was he was so humble praise God
[44:55] and how can they have accused him of
[44:57] plagiarism was he when he said I took it
[44:59] from them praise God
[45:02] they got an evil spirit praise God these
[45:04] people have an evil spirit
[45:07] because they I don't know they just got
[45:08] the what I told what I told them is they
[45:11] just don't want to obey the word of God
[45:12] praise God they want to have Dracula
[45:14] parties they want to have Halloween
[45:15] parties they want to listen to rock and
[45:16] roll they want to watch evil Wicked
[45:18] movies they love sin but they should
[45:21] love God more than anything else praise
[45:23] God Amen now I've got all my
[45:26] that's my statement on that now um
[45:30] so again now if you notice church here
[45:32] uh notice colomba uh he now from what I
[45:35] believe I think I put in the book uh I
[45:37] believe the church age I believe the
[45:39] fire to your church age actually started
[45:40] earlier so colomba could live inside of
[45:42] it because there's a quote brother Adam
[45:44] said that Columba came in the fire to
[45:46] your church age
[45:47] so see brother Ram he was just doing his
[45:49] best he must have just you know didn't
[45:51] check the dates really of when when uh
[45:53] Columbo was born and he didn't have
[45:55] Google like you got Google praise God I
[45:57] can type in when did Columbus live and
[45:59] I'm going to answer in 0.8 seconds right
[46:02] didn't have that luxury
[46:03] okay and he said Columbo lived in
[46:06] thyartira well according to the dates he
[46:08] didn't so that that means he probably
[46:10] didn't check those dates right let's
[46:11] give him the benefit of the doubt he's
[46:12] human he's a man but he said I take him
[46:14] from the historians Hallelujah okay
[46:18] so I'm gonna leave that up there just
[46:19] for a moment here now how do we
[46:21] determine the dates how did Brother Ram
[46:22] determine the dates and the lengths of
[46:24] the church ages how did he do it
[46:26] uh well first of all they're approximate
[46:29] they're not exact dates right they're
[46:31] just approximate dates just like a
[46:33] season right uh don't forget the time
[46:36] changes this this Saturday night okay
[46:38] don't forget we fall back one hour
[46:40] praise God
[46:41] so just enjoy that by guys but but now
[46:44] I'm thinking of that because we're in
[46:45] Seasons when did fall actually start was
[46:46] it September or October when
[46:49] September
[46:50] yeah
[46:51] September now it wasn't on that specific
[46:55] day that all the leaves started falling
[46:56] the leaves were falling back in August
[46:58] because I was I was sad when they
[46:59] started falling I remember when they
[47:01] started well I'm like I don't want to
[47:02] rake leaves again I don't want to chop
[47:04] them up
[47:05] so the the seasons blend into each other
[47:08] right and so the so do the church ages
[47:11] they and the Seven Seals right they kind
[47:13] of blend into each other especially the
[47:14] church ages
[47:15] uh but brother Ram did take a lot of
[47:17] these dates from Larkin which I'll show
[47:19] you in just a moment but then he
[47:20] actually moves he moved three of the
[47:22] dates himself just so you know he moved
[47:24] through the dates because he must have
[47:25] seen things happen in history that he
[47:27] just wanted to adjust them a little bit
[47:29] but again it's more of like Seasons
[47:31] right they go into uh one season they
[47:34] slowly fade into uh one another now but
[47:37] I think brother Ram uh use uh Jesus
[47:42] descriptions from Revelation chapter two
[47:43] and three and then he matched those
[47:46] descriptions with major events in church
[47:48] history like the easiest one is Azusa
[47:50] Street 1906 right we can see that's the
[47:52] beginning of a brand new age right gifts
[47:54] are restored uh the name of the Lord
[47:56] Jesus Christ came back right although
[47:58] they denominated within uh 20 years they
[48:00] denominated that a Jesus only group but
[48:03] I mean all these great Revelations are
[48:05] coming back one God not three persons
[48:07] one God one person was coming back and
[48:09] so that's an obvious moment where wow
[48:11] Revival praise God that was a Revival so
[48:13] it must be the beginning of a new age
[48:15] you can see it plainly praise God now
[48:19] actually I'm already I'm ready for the
[48:20] next one so here's so here let's compare
[48:22] Larkin Larkin's uh uh dates to brother
[48:25] branham's here just for a moment so see
[48:28] they agree on most of them and they just
[48:30] have slight differences between Ephesus
[48:32] Philadelphia laodicea
[48:35] the church notice most of the messengers
[48:38] Minister during the beginning of their
[48:41] Church ages
[48:43] okay now there are some quotes brother
[48:44] Adam says there at the end they come at
[48:46] the end of their ages
[48:47] and other quotes he says they come at
[48:49] the end of the previous age which that
[48:52] makes sense right after at the End of
[48:53] the Age
[48:54] comes the messenger to the next stage
[48:56] right
[48:57] okay but
[48:58] which that would that would make sense
[49:00] but there are quotes on both sides just
[49:01] so you know but if you look at the order
[49:03] of them the messenger comes at the end
[49:05] of the age or at the beginning of the
[49:06] age and I love that because God is
[49:09] sending that star to shine bright and
[49:11] then and then the age has time for other
[49:14] men to take that anointing and spread it
[49:16] to the uttermost parts of the earth amen
[49:18] ah it proves God is long-suffering
[49:21] praise God he sends the messenger at the
[49:23] beginning so other men can receive it
[49:26] and then and then they can get a reward
[49:27] they can get a crown because they can be
[49:29] Apostles amen hallelujah oh it's
[49:32] beautiful it's God's long-suffering is
[49:34] what I'm saying God sends the messenger
[49:37] at the beginning of the age or near the
[49:39] beginning so the rest of the age can
[49:41] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[49:44] churches amen hallelujah that's proof
[49:46] that God is a god of long-suffering
[49:49] and he's a god of Revival Hallelujah
[49:52] he's a god of Revelation amen oh
[49:55] hallelujah oh it's beautiful and notice
[49:58] these were all stars Paul was a star
[50:00] iranianism Martin Colombo was the star
[50:02] Luther Wesley brother Rand they were all
[50:04] stars shining the light of God and what
[50:07] is light the word made manifest brother
[50:09] random says hallelujah they manifested
[50:12] God's word praise God
[50:14] Paul manifested Jesus Christ
[50:16] brother random manifested Jesus Christ
[50:19] Martin Luther manifested the presence of
[50:21] Jesus Christ amen each and every one
[50:24] manifested the presence of Jesus Christ
[50:26] they were the light to their age
[50:28] Hallelujah
[50:30] that's why that you know there is a good
[50:32] thing about press and play at home
[50:33] that's a good thing to do at home or if
[50:35] you got a question in the service you
[50:36] can press play I I press play a little
[50:38] bit but don't press play where it takes
[50:40] away the fivefold ministry because now
[50:42] you've broken the word of God
[50:43] but when you press play you're listening
[50:45] to run the ram doesn't it raise your
[50:46] Faith Church oh Hallelujah doesn't just
[50:48] feel like God is so real praise God that
[50:51] God can do anything praise God that's
[50:54] exactly right
[50:57] now let's go through each of one of
[50:58] these here by God's grace
[51:01] now what's interesting is Larkin started
[51:03] his church age of course A.D 70 right so
[51:05] I think that's where I like it Larkin
[51:07] started after Titus invaded uh Jerusalem
[51:11] because it looked like the end of the
[51:13] Jewish age right it looked like the end
[51:14] of the Jewish age the temple Harris
[51:16] Temple was destroyed
[51:17] okay so that's where Larkin starts
[51:19] brother Randall starts it in 53 A.D now
[51:22] church that's because the three-year
[51:24] Revival in Ephesus started in 53 A.D
[51:28] and that's recorded in Acts chapter 20.
[51:31] right remember that because the Bible
[51:32] said he was there three years and he
[51:34] taught them the whole counsel of God
[51:35] within three years
[51:37] okay so the church age likely starts
[51:40] around 53 A.D
[51:42] okay and it started with a Revival in
[51:44] Ephesus praise God
[51:46] now what's interesting is that the
[51:48] Ephesian Church thought was founded in
[51:51] Paul's third missionary journey
[51:53] third missionary journey which is
[51:55] interesting
[51:56] and he also started the churches in
[51:58] Philippi thessalonica Berea Corinth
[52:01] among others and that's in Acts chapters
[52:03] 16 through 20. now the word Ephesus
[52:06] means permitted
[52:08] okay it was a permitted age now and then
[52:10] Larkin adds the words to relax it means
[52:13] to relax so that they mean the same if
[52:15] you permit something you're relaxing
[52:17] your standards you're allowing something
[52:19] so emphasis means permitted if you look
[52:21] at look it up in the Greek Lexicon and
[52:23] so that's exactly what Jesus said uh he
[52:26] said his main concern for the age is
[52:29] that they lost their Zeal and left their
[52:32] first love
[52:33] okay so it makes sense Ephesus was
[52:35] permitted they permitted things in their
[52:37] lives that they shouldn't have let in
[52:38] their lives
[52:40] praise God now God help us not to permit
[52:42] anything evil in our lives that's why
[52:44] that's why you're here tonight you're
[52:45] not going to let you're not going to let
[52:46] anything be permitted in your life that
[52:48] shouldn't be in your life praise God
[52:49] that's right even going to keep clean
[52:51] praise God by the grace of God Amen
[52:54] now I'm going to go quickly through this
[52:56] Smyrna began around 170 and ended about
[52:59] 312 so Smyrna sorry means myrrh and
[53:03] myrrh is costly perfume and embalming
[53:07] antiseptic
[53:08] okay so it's used in the dead and this
[53:12] aligns perfectly with Jesus prophecy
[53:14] that this time period will be the age of
[53:16] Martyrs because in Revelation 2 10 he
[53:19] said be thou faithful unto death and I
[53:21] will give Thee the Crown of Life
[53:24] so Smyrna matches perfectly myrrh death
[53:28] be faithful unto death now what's
[53:31] amazing church I found this in history
[53:32] brother Brandon didn't say this but I
[53:33] found this in history
[53:35] the uh this age began in 170 because
[53:39] Justin Martyr and six of his disciples
[53:42] were were the were some of the first
[53:45] Martyrs in ad170.
[53:48] right just in the Justin Martyr I wonder
[53:50] if that's where they get the name Justin
[53:51] Martin I haven't studied his life enough
[53:52] to know
[53:53] but this church ages begins with a
[53:57] persecution
[53:59] and seven Christians lose their lives
[54:02] and it also ends with a gruesome 10-year
[54:06] Christian persecution under Diocletian
[54:08] around 303.
[54:10] uh yeah 303 but then it goes to 312 A.D
[54:14] I'm sorry yeah it started 303 but ended
[54:16] 3 12.
[54:17] yeah so diocletians persecution end
[54:20] around 312. so it started with Martyrs
[54:22] and then it ends with this martyrs
[54:25] okay so see made there's major events in
[54:28] church history where these ages are
[54:29] aligned to
[54:30] right Larkin just wasn't guessing
[54:32] brother Ram just wasn't guessing they're
[54:34] reading history and see when did God
[54:35] move when did God start something new
[54:37] and how does that line up with Jesus
[54:39] seven seven letters and in each case it
[54:41] lines up wonderfully that and that
[54:43] proves history and Jesus's words prove
[54:47] that the revelation of the seven
[54:48] churches is exactly right
[54:50] amen the third age pergamos
[54:54] began around 312 and went to 606. it
[54:57] began with Emperor Constantine's Reign
[55:00] Over the Western Empire of Rome
[55:02] uh and later expanded to the entire
[55:04] Roman Empire empire around 320 480 right
[55:07] before the Nicene Council
[55:09] uh as Jesus foretold in Revelation 2 14
[55:12] many in this age would succumb to an
[55:15] Unholy religious Union similar to the
[55:17] one of Balaam and balak the union of
[55:20] church and state how many know this age
[55:22] had the union of church and state
[55:23] Constantine and Rome
[55:26] right so we see that Jesus talked about
[55:27] that in this letter to the pergamian
[55:30] church age
[55:31] so false Christianity in Rome United
[55:34] with Constantine now notice what
[55:36] Constance he did he actually stopped
[55:38] Christian persecution
[55:41] and everybody thinks he's a good man
[55:42] because of that well he might have
[55:44] started good but he ended up an awful
[55:45] man
[55:47] right because so friends uh I have
[55:49] family members who are Christians
[55:52] um and they sent my children I don't
[55:54] remember this Lydia Malachi but they
[55:56] sent you guys books chapter books on
[55:58] church history that were kind of kids
[55:59] books I don't know if you remember this
[56:00] I took them to Goodwill just to let you
[56:02] know
[56:02] I didn't want him in my house because
[56:04] the first book was about Constantine how
[56:06] he was such a wonderful Christian and I
[56:08] knew the history and I knew he wasn't
[56:09] see so the denominational people uh the
[56:13] mark of the beast kind of churches that
[56:14] are linked to that they think
[56:15] Constantine was good because he didn't
[56:17] kill Christians
[56:19] but the RAM said actually Satan's more
[56:21] deceptive when he doesn't kill
[56:22] Christians
[56:23] he lets them live and he he he deceives
[56:26] them into Wicked sins
[56:29] right he deceives them into lacks living
[56:31] lazy living
[56:33] compromising on sin
[56:35] that's what brother says God of this
[56:36] evil age I believe if I'm not mistaken
[56:38] he said he's more deceptive when he lets
[56:40] him live
[56:43] and so either Constantine was a True
[56:46] Believer or he was
[56:47] he was used by the devil at the
[56:49] beginning he actually ended the
[56:51] persecution of Christians it's the first
[56:52] thing he did
[56:53] uh second thing he donated property to
[56:56] Christians
[56:57] Christians right
[57:00] and then he had many churches built or
[57:03] constructed with government money
[57:05] again to have the church and state
[57:07] United
[57:09] right just like Balaam and uh Barrack
[57:13] or balak yeah
[57:15] now church I don't know if you knew this
[57:17] but he still remained a murderer he had
[57:20] his oldest son and his wife killed
[57:23] towards the end of his life while he was
[57:25] away at a different city and they were
[57:27] in Rome he had them killed
[57:29] now Church what Christian could ever
[57:31] possibly even think of doing something
[57:33] like that
[57:34] and like his like denominations exalt
[57:36] this guy he's some great Christian
[57:38] and he murdered his own wife and his
[57:40] oldest son
[57:41] because he wanted to protect his crown
[57:42] he wanted to keep the crown anything to
[57:43] keep the crown there it is my goodness
[57:46] so likely his conversion was false or
[57:49] incomplete or it was like Judas Iscariot
[57:51] where he started off good but then he
[57:52] fell away
[57:53] but that's what this church age is all
[57:55] about uniting church and state
[57:58] but it started with uh Christians no
[58:00] longer being persecuted uh but it ends
[58:04] in 606 because something awful happened
[58:06] in 606. in 606 6 Pope Boniface III
[58:11] accepted the title of universal Bishop
[58:15] of the entire Christian Church in 606.
[58:17] so you have us you have said this a May
[58:19] or this not amazing but this awful
[58:21] church history moment where now the pope
[58:24] assumes I am the pope I'm Papa I'm
[58:26] father over the entire Christian church
[58:28] and it starts ushers in a new age the
[58:32] darkest age brother said it was the
[58:33] darkest age out of all of them that's
[58:35] right we are the most deceptive age but
[58:38] we're not the darkest age we've got a
[58:39] whole lot of light let's say thank God
[58:41] Amen church thank God that we have light
[58:43] in this age Hallelujah we have way more
[58:46] light than they had in the Dark Ages way
[58:48] more light but it's more deceptive now
[58:50] it was darker than because they did less
[58:53] Bibles and less truth and and uh the
[58:56] popes had Mighty control over the
[58:58] governments right literal control
[59:00] immediate control over the governments
[59:03] but here in this next age it starts with
[59:07] a pope saying I'm the universal Bishop
[59:11] and that was the beginning of the
[59:12] darkest time in all church history and
[59:15] also this was also the age
[59:17] that's about
[59:19] control of the wrong Church and took her
[59:22] to the depths of Satan think about that
[59:24] the very depths of Satan
[59:27] through fornication Jesus said idolatry
[59:30] and other doctrines of devils
[59:33] right I'm going to get to this history
[59:34] later where the popes of this time they
[59:36] had they just had harems of prostitutes
[59:40] right and there was there was uh the
[59:43] priest would say don't let my wife and
[59:45] daughters run the pope because the
[59:46] Pope's going to get my wife and
[59:47] daughters
[59:48] even the priests around the popes would
[59:49] say that that's how awful these guys
[59:51] were
[59:52] any anybody they could ravish anyone
[59:54] anyone they could rape they do it
[59:56] some of the most wicked wicked and this
[59:59] is called the depths of Satan by Jesus
[1:00:01] Christ
[1:00:02] and it matches perfectly I love it it
[1:00:04] matches perfectly with history amen
[1:00:05] because Jesus is not a liar Jesus is
[1:00:08] telling the truth he foretold all these
[1:00:10] events he knows the beginning from the
[1:00:11] end he's the author and finisher of all
[1:00:13] human history praise God
[1:00:15] that means your life is in his hands
[1:00:17] praise God
[1:00:19] Church you're right where God wants you
[1:00:21] to be if you're in obedience by the
[1:00:22] grace of God you're right where God
[1:00:23] wants you to be Hallelujah couldn't be
[1:00:25] an any better spot Hallelujah than
[1:00:27] servant Jesus Christ
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] now this is the age I I personally and I
[1:00:33] wrote this in the book I personally
[1:00:34] believe thyroid Tierra started in 560
[1:00:36] now that's just my opinion but let me
[1:00:38] tell you why
[1:00:40] I'm not trying to upsurp anything but
[1:00:41] brother said he just took the dates he
[1:00:42] did the best he could on the dates he
[1:00:43] took them from historians
[1:00:45] did you know in 560 A.D
[1:00:49] there was a Holy Ghost and Power
[1:00:51] movement in phrygia it was a five-year
[1:00:54] Revival and it resembled the day of
[1:00:56] Pentecost history says and I got this
[1:00:59] history from the same books brother got
[1:01:01] his history from
[1:01:03] this revival and freesia had all nine
[1:01:07] gifts of the Spirit
[1:01:08] and they were operated perfectly for
[1:01:11] five years imagine that
[1:01:14] it seems likely so it seems thyartira
[1:01:17] began just like laodicea with the
[1:01:19] Revival
[1:01:20] because uh when Azusa I'm sorry yeah
[1:01:22] when Azusa started those gifts were
[1:01:24] operating perfectly if you actually
[1:01:26] listen to their own testimonies
[1:01:28] those gifts started they started
[1:01:30] perfectly they would have tongues I know
[1:01:32] tongues and they have interpretation
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:35] and then there are prophecies they would
[1:01:36] have discernments of spirit everything
[1:01:38] was right at the beginning as far as
[1:01:40] what I've read if I'm wrong somebody
[1:01:42] help me out later by God's grace but
[1:01:44] that's what I've read it seemed to start
[1:01:45] right but then it got off brother
[1:01:47] answered the denominated within 20 years
[1:01:48] they started a denomination
[1:01:51] okay so that's why I believe uh thy
[1:01:54] artera probably started earlier and if
[1:01:56] it in church if it started in 560 look
[1:01:58] at that that allows uh the messenger to
[1:02:00] preach 36 years during the church age
[1:02:04] so that's just my humble thought we'll
[1:02:07] find out later in Heaven by God's grace
[1:02:08] but it's just a minor this ain't a major
[1:02:10] amen we're just talking about dates and
[1:02:12] it don't really matter
[1:02:15] but remember then again if it starts in
[1:02:16] 560 that allows Columbo to live in the
[1:02:18] age because brother Graham said he he
[1:02:20] lived in Colombia I'm sorry he lived in
[1:02:22] the artera okay that help by God's grace
[1:02:25] have you ever see that all right
[1:02:27] if I find out if you have any other
[1:02:28] opinion uh then brother Branham or
[1:02:31] something like that people don't like
[1:02:33] you
[1:02:34] but then brother Ram has all kinds of
[1:02:35] different opinions right and they change
[1:02:37] so you need uh you need to rightly
[1:02:38] divide the word of Truth praise God
[1:02:40] that's what we try to do by the grace of
[1:02:41] God now the Sardis Church age began now
[1:02:43] listen to this it began around 50 . but
[1:02:46] did you know this what you
[1:02:49] eat five Theses on the uh Wittenberg
[1:02:51] Church door
[1:02:52] three years earlier
[1:02:54] in 1517. did you know that like we
[1:02:58] always think uh uh Reformation started
[1:03:00] when Martin Luther nailed
[1:03:02] nailed those Theses so I went and
[1:03:04] searched it out why Larkin say that
[1:03:05] Larkin said it was 15 20 because in that
[1:03:08] year Luther actually put out three great
[1:03:10] documents that laid down the fundamental
[1:03:12] principles of the reformers and that
[1:03:15] started a wildfire it was like going
[1:03:17] viral today on YouTube or Twitter or
[1:03:19] something like that he wrote three
[1:03:21] documents and they spread like wildfire
[1:03:23] and it just took off so just the the
[1:03:25] pounding of the nail and the 95 thesis
[1:03:27] that didn't maybe impact people as much
[1:03:29] right away but once he got out those
[1:03:31] foundational documents people spread it
[1:03:33] around they were texting all over the
[1:03:34] place praise God they were sharing it
[1:03:36] all over they were just they were
[1:03:38] constantly getting copied praise God he
[1:03:40] was he was one of the most best authors
[1:03:42] of that time was Martin Luther people
[1:03:44] couldn't get enough of his truth why
[1:03:46] because he was a star for Jesus amen
[1:03:48] he was making his uh making his
[1:03:50] Revelation go viral praise God
[1:03:52] hallelujah definitely Church
[1:03:55] so that's interesting just keep that in
[1:03:56] mind just so you know 1517 was when he
[1:03:59] nailed the Theses three years later is
[1:04:01] when Larkin and brother Branham said
[1:04:02] that's when the church age started so I
[1:04:04] just say well praise the Lord I don't
[1:04:06] know Hallelujah God is good amen I
[1:04:08] believe it it just it's got to be one of
[1:04:10] those by God's grace
[1:04:13] now what's amazing or you might forget
[1:04:14] about this age the age was powerful but
[1:04:17] it ended with a lot of disappointment
[1:04:19] because Jesus said only a few names in
[1:04:22] Sardis have not defiled their garments
[1:04:24] so it reminds me a lot of episodes they
[1:04:26] start off good but then very few
[1:04:29] actually make it out of the age
[1:04:32] right and remember you said you have a
[1:04:33] name that you live but you're dead so
[1:04:35] that means after Luther and zwingly and
[1:04:37] all these uh reformers died then the
[1:04:39] people just they gave they got they got
[1:04:42] permitted right they they got they relax
[1:04:43] spiritually
[1:04:45] and that's what we can't do brother
[1:04:46] Ram's not on the scene so we still have
[1:04:48] to have strong faith in Jesus Christ we
[1:04:50] still have to pray and have expectation
[1:04:52] and trust God and go to God In Prayer
[1:04:54] amen and let the holy spirit guide Our
[1:04:56] Lives constantly praise God we've got to
[1:04:58] keep that fire alive amen
[1:05:00] I'm gonna say it again like our eyes do
[1:05:02] if any you ever see me get off the word
[1:05:04] come talk to me about it I'm gonna say
[1:05:05] especially brother amen because he's a
[1:05:06] man you know sisters might feel
[1:05:08] uncomfortable but amen if I ever get off
[1:05:09] the word you come tell me about it by
[1:05:11] God's grace
[1:05:12] right brother said even the janitor he

[1:05:25] you want to talk about serpent seed or
[1:05:27] godhead he was so humble praise God
[1:05:30] and that's why that's why church it's
[1:05:32] everybody's responsibility here to make
[1:05:33] sure this church moves on
[1:05:35] in the power of God you can't put it all
[1:05:38] on me I can't put it all on you we're
[1:05:40] all in this together praise God Amen
[1:05:42] we're a body Ministry praise God
[1:05:45] we cannot do uh uh uh Conquering the
[1:05:48] laity we can't do nicolaitas Somewhere
[1:05:50] Only The Preacher's anointed you're all
[1:05:52] anointed this year you've seen it you're
[1:05:55] all anointed praise God
[1:05:56] Hallelujah everybody's anointed
[1:06:00] and we must stay anointed by the grace
[1:06:02] of God
[1:06:03] Hallelujah
[1:06:06] yeah when Luther zwingley and John
[1:06:08] Calvin died
[1:06:09] everybody went down a few people
[1:06:11] actually kept the faith after that I
[1:06:13] remember Martin Luther wrote those
[1:06:14] famous words I don't know if you know
[1:06:15] his brother Ray he said I'll be he said
[1:06:17] I'll be amazed if 10 of my converts make
[1:06:19] it to Heaven Martin Luther said that I
[1:06:21] got the book where he said that
[1:06:22] unbelievable ten percent
[1:06:25] because that's what Jesus said if you
[1:06:27] there be a few of them will actually not
[1:06:30] defile their garments
[1:06:33] all right now uh Philadelphia the period
[1:06:36] of broadly love
[1:06:39] I started around 1750 it lasted to 1906.
[1:06:42] Jesus called this the open door age
[1:06:44] because George Whitefield John Wesley
[1:06:47] William Carey David Livingstone
[1:06:49] evangelized the world teaching Saints to
[1:06:52] keep Jesus word name and patience
[1:06:56] right so some of these like Whitefield
[1:06:58] did England and United States Wesley did
[1:07:01] England John Kerry I'm sorry William
[1:07:03] Carey uh he did India David Livingstone
[1:07:06] did Africa
[1:07:08] and members John Wesley would preach
[1:07:09] eight sermons a day
[1:07:11] I don't know how he controlled his voice
[1:07:12] with that he must have some Supernatural
[1:07:14] fire anointing or something like that I
[1:07:17] lose my voice if I preach hard one time
[1:07:18] a week you know I lose my voice what
[1:07:20] happened I think it might be the coffee
[1:07:22] actually I need to talk to my doctor
[1:07:23] about that yeah the doctor told one time
[1:07:25] do you know coffee makes your throat
[1:07:26] real bad I'm like oh I really like
[1:07:27] coffee
[1:07:28] so anyways I got I got room to grow by
[1:07:31] God's grace
[1:07:32] so these men did it but notice church
[1:07:34] now what did something I put in here I
[1:07:36] found in history
[1:07:38] 1750s when it started but the season was
[1:07:41] already changing in 1739 so 11 years
[1:07:44] earlier guess who came uh to America to
[1:07:48] preach Revival to start the Revival
[1:07:50] George Whitefield came to America
[1:07:54] and guess where he started his first
[1:07:56] Revival Church in America any guesses
[1:07:58] Philadelphia Pennsylvania
[1:08:02] see how that's amazing I found that I'm
[1:08:04] like unbelievable 11 years before the
[1:08:06] Philadelphia Church they started we got
[1:08:08] a sign that we're moving into the season
[1:08:10] of the open door amen God always does
[1:08:13] that there's always a glimpse hopefully
[1:08:15] don't well yeah we already had snow this
[1:08:16] year right that's kind of like that same
[1:08:17] thing we had snow a couple weeks ago
[1:08:19] right I'm driving home and there's snow
[1:08:20] I think it was on a Wednesday actually
[1:08:21] there's always a glimpse before the
[1:08:23] season starts there's always this
[1:08:25] reminder that season's going to change
[1:08:27] and so God did the same thing he said
[1:08:29] Whitefield and he preached Revival in
[1:08:31] Philadelphia 11 years before the church
[1:08:34] they started because seasons are
[1:08:35] changing praise God
[1:08:38] oh if that's true brother what about the
[1:08:39] Rapture amen hallelujah amen by God's
[1:08:43] grace may we have latter rain anointing
[1:08:45] praise God latter rain Services later
[1:08:47] rain Revival may we get some of those
[1:08:49] before the season of crossing over
[1:08:51] praise God Amen
[1:08:54] oh that's beautiful praise God
[1:08:56] help us to blend in that season well by
[1:08:58] the grace of God
[1:09:00] hallelujah oh thank you Jesus
[1:09:03] I'm almost down here by God's grace I
[1:09:05] don't want to go too too late
[1:09:08] I know I'm doing a lot of teaching on
[1:09:09] this but this really strengthens my
[1:09:10] faith as I read church history really
[1:09:12] strengthens my faith because I realize
[1:09:14] wow they if they did it if they could
[1:09:15] have testimonies to overcome what should
[1:09:17] I do how should I feel praise God
[1:09:20] you know church I found that when I read
[1:09:21] about the testimonies of other people or
[1:09:23] hear their testimonies I stopped feeling
[1:09:25] sorry for myself
[1:09:27] right I stopped I stopped making excuses
[1:09:29] when I started hearing other people's
[1:09:31] testimonies and the devil you know
[1:09:33] trying to discourage me I find that when
[1:09:35] I hear other people's testimonies it
[1:09:36] gives a fire within me like Lord I want
[1:09:39] to make my calling an election sure
[1:09:40] praise God
[1:09:42] they've already passed me on and the
[1:09:44] Bible said there's a cloud of witnesses
[1:09:46] praise God God's given us clouds of
[1:09:48] witnesses all these examples Hebrews 11
[1:09:50] the whole Old Testament the book of Acts
[1:09:53] praise God and now we have church
[1:09:54] history all these Witnesses may God help
[1:09:56] us just look up and set our eyes on
[1:09:58] Jesus and press on towards the mark of
[1:10:01] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:04] oh you can find so much courage from
[1:10:07] these testimonies throughout the church
[1:10:09] age
[1:10:11] Hallelujah
[1:10:13] thank you Jesus now the final One Church
[1:10:17] H we're now laodicea in 1906 began with
[1:10:20] the Azusa Street Revival
[1:10:22] and the gifts were restored just like
[1:10:23] Joel 2 25 said I restore to you the
[1:10:26] years that the locusts have eaten the
[1:10:28] canker room the caterpillar the Palm
[1:10:29] worm my great Army which I sent among
[1:10:32] you
[1:10:33] now church just so you know Martin
[1:10:35] Luther spoke in tongues Wesley had all
[1:10:37] kinds of Miracles people would pass out
[1:10:39] he prayed for his horse with a broken
[1:10:41] bone it was instantly healed
[1:10:43] I mean people would scream and shout and
[1:10:45] and uh they'd be slain the spirit under
[1:10:47] John Wesley
[1:10:48] he had amazing testimonies remember
[1:10:50] brother tells that testimony he went to
[1:10:52] a sick friend and his friend was on his
[1:10:54] deathbed and Wesley was so sad but he
[1:10:56] said he just took his Bible and he read
[1:10:57] all the scriptures about Divine Healing
[1:10:59] by his stripes you're healed I'm the
[1:11:01] Lord thy God who heals all that diseases
[1:11:02] brother said he left and then just hours
[1:11:05] later that man Rose completely up he was
[1:11:07] near death and he said Oz it takes
[1:11:09] sometimes is the word of God praise God
[1:11:11] the word is so powerful just read it
[1:11:14] just speak it and let God move amen
[1:11:17] let God do something praise God but I
[1:11:19] love he was discouraged but he said the
[1:11:21] only hope I have is to read the word of
[1:11:23] God
[1:11:24] and it brought forth healing praise God
[1:11:26] not instantly but within a few hours
[1:11:28] praise God Divine Healing amen oh man
[1:11:32] men like that praise God courageous men
[1:11:35] like that
[1:11:37] God restore so see we've got we had
[1:11:39] tongues and Gifts brother said Luther
[1:11:41] had all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:43] Wesley a little more and then Azusa
[1:11:45] Street here all these gifts on a greater
[1:11:47] group of people a larger number of
[1:11:49] people right the gifts were poured back
[1:11:51] out on them now sadly the Pentecostals
[1:11:53] all denominated and independents have
[1:11:56] grown lukewarm on Jesus word and spirit
[1:11:58] and they don't want no more Bible
[1:12:00] Revelation they've kicked Jesus out of
[1:12:03] their churches right
[1:12:05] yet Jesus the Bible says stands there
[1:12:07] knocking at the doors trying to enter in
[1:12:09] now if you we all say we want him to
[1:12:11] come in but if he comes in church he's
[1:12:13] going to rebuke us chasing us and ask us
[1:12:15] for Fellowship
[1:12:17] hallelujah praise God Amen everybody
[1:12:19] catch that praise God
[1:12:21] when you let Jesus in your life he's
[1:12:23] going to give some I'll say it like
[1:12:25] every day and when we invite more of
[1:12:27] Jesus in our lives we got to be ready
[1:12:28] for him to rebuke us
[1:12:30] and tell us where we're wrong
[1:12:33] then we've got to be ready for him to
[1:12:34] chasten us and then ask us for more
[1:12:36] Fellowship praise God
[1:12:38] and Church believe it you believe this
[1:12:40] in the busyness of life we can still
[1:12:42] always make time for Jesus
[1:12:44] in the busyness of this day brother said
[1:12:46] when Martin Luther got more busy he said
[1:12:49] I had to spend more time in praying he
[1:12:51] said because he had more responsibility
[1:12:52] to make sure the results were the right
[1:12:54] kind of results that he wanted
[1:12:56] he said well I have this meeting this
[1:12:58] meeting of this letter I got all these
[1:13:00] rebuttals I have to make he said I had
[1:13:01] to spend even more time in prayer when I
[1:13:03] got busy
[1:13:05] so
[1:13:06] so now we have a good lesson uh put a
[1:13:09] few more minutes on your prayer time
[1:13:10] right before if you're busy or praise
[1:13:12] God it makes your prayers the most
[1:13:15] important thing praise God
[1:13:16] Hallelujah
[1:13:18] that's what Mighty Men of God have
[1:13:20] learned down Through the Ages Hallelujah
[1:13:22] there's no power without prayer
[1:13:24] Hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:13:28] all right now
[1:13:30] let's see I think I'll uh
[1:13:33] I think I better stop right there by the
[1:13:35] grace of God
[1:13:36] okay so musicians can come I think I'm
[1:13:38] gonna stop right there by God's grace
[1:13:42] so musicians can come praise the Lord
[1:13:43] how many love the Lord tonight amen
[1:13:45] that's usually my signal that okay we're
[1:13:46] done how we love the Lord let's stand to
[1:13:48] our feet by God's grace
[1:13:52] so George we've seen that now you can
[1:13:54] see exactly why brother Branham chose
[1:13:56] the dates and why did Larkin choose the
[1:13:58] dates that they chose
[1:14:00] because each of these ages had different
[1:14:03] signals and different revivals at
[1:14:06] different times and it signaled wow this
[1:14:07] is the beginning of a new day this
[1:14:09] beginning of a new age praise God and
[1:14:11] now we're coming down we're looking for
[1:14:13] the signals for the end of this age
[1:14:15] we're not looking for the beginning of a
[1:14:17] new age on Earth we're looking for a new
[1:14:18] Eternal age praise God
[1:14:20] and so by the way I don't know if you if
[1:14:22] you saw it but I preached on Russia on
[1:14:23] Sunday I don't know if you saw that okay
[1:14:24] did you okay good praise God I just want
[1:14:26] to make sure
[1:14:27] I knew that was something we could
[1:14:28] probably Fellowship about by God's grace
[1:14:30] because it's a great topic you know it
[1:14:32] really is a tremendous topic
[1:14:33] but that's why you know we preached on
[1:14:35] that on Sunday about Russia and things
[1:14:37] and
[1:14:38] we just want to be ready for us coming
[1:14:40] praise God
[1:14:42] and I believe God will help us you know
[1:14:44] after I preached out I went in my prayer
[1:14:45] closet I think it was Monday or Tuesday
[1:14:46] I'm just crying asking God lord you know
[1:14:48] my heart I don't want to miss it Lord if
[1:14:50] at all possible lord always make me
[1:14:53] ready for your coming
[1:14:54] I want to live to see it but if not
[1:14:56] somehow let me know praise God I'm so
[1:14:58] I'm still asking God for that praise God
[1:15:00] let me know
[1:15:01] I want to be ready I don't want to miss
[1:15:03] it I want your people to be ready for
[1:15:05] your coming praise God
[1:15:07] because if I thought the Lord was coming
[1:15:08] any day I'd be on my phone call on every
[1:15:10] single person I knew not just texting
[1:15:12] them I'd be calling them praise God
[1:15:14] I thought the Rapture was next week
[1:15:16] Church wouldn't you be in desperation
[1:15:18] if the Rapture was next week
[1:15:20] what about your lost loved ones what
[1:15:22] about your aunts and uncles and what
[1:15:23] about your brothers and sisters wouldn't
[1:15:24] you just be like knocking down their
[1:15:26] door just to talk to them
[1:15:28] if you really felt like it was or would
[1:15:30] you would you be building million dollar
[1:15:31] churches which one would you be doing
[1:15:34] that's
[1:15:36] that's that's that's that's one of those
[1:15:37] signs that it doesn't seem right if you
[1:15:39] believe the Rapture is tomorrow why
[1:15:40] would you be building a million dollar
[1:15:42] Church
[1:15:43] or 10 million dollar Church
[1:15:45] program said that the fruits don't line
[1:15:47] up with what your your confession is

[1:16:11] and losing of Truth during the church

[1:16:14] through the scriptures
[1:16:16] then we'll get into the each and an
[1:16:18] individual age we'll go over them kind
[1:16:19] of uh briefly and hit some of the
[1:16:21] highlights
[1:16:22] by the grace of God hallelujah how many
[1:16:25] want to have fellowship with Jesus
