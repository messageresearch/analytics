========================================

because of my voice and we'll see how that goes by God's grace Hallelujah let's go to First Kings 17. First Kings 17. I'm not really going to preach a series or anything like that tonight I'm gonna I just want to preach a sermon kind of based off what happened there on the weekend and someone preach a simple sermon called spiritual food and due season praise God no doubt that's what it was over the weekend and it's all God's doing we were just there when it happened praise God so First Kings 17 of course brother Brown preached this in 1965. just a few uh months before he went off the scene and in that sermon I was listening to it today he said you didn't have much time left before he had to cross over to the other side and that was exactly right there First Kings 17. pardon me as I get there first king 17. my brother Ram says this story here is a perfect type verses one to seven uh we'll read seven together I'll read one to six myself here spiritual food induces and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor Reign these years but according to my word I think about that brother Adams makes that statement have you ever seen a time where there was no rain or Dew Reign or do for three and a half years so this was brother said he got so close to God he knew exactly what God wanted that's how he could say something like that he was so so close in Fellowship to God verse two and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hands and turn the Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan so he comes out with thus saith the Lord to Ahab we'd say like the president of the nation and then he goes into hiding you see how God has certain times and seasons for us here he's out in the public declaring the word of God but then God says go hide yourself verse 4. and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there but remember to see there we always want to be there where God wants us to be hiding myself well if that's where the Lord tells me to go yes I want to be there praise God verse 5. so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord so see that's where we want to be the word where the word of the Lord tells us to be for he went and dwelt by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook let's read verse seven ready one two three and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land let's have one more word of prayer if you have anything on your heart just don't make it known unto God here father God you are faithful you're the only living God Hallelujah you know all things you know you know the beginning from the end you wrote our stories God you're still writing it Lord God we want to see what you're doing right now we know you're going to do great things in the future you're doing great things in the past help us to see what you're doing right now Lord God and Father Lord you saw my life I've tried to prepare myself I believe each person has as well father God forgive us of any shortcomings today God we know this is by Grace Lord God we know Lord the grace of God is for us we know no one could lay anything to our charge Lord God we know there's no condemnation to us those of us who are in Christ Jesus which I believe is everybody by God's God because we're in Christ We Believe In Christ We Trust Christ Lord God Hallelujah and Lord You're for us so nobody can be against us Lord God doesn't make a difference there's no weapon that's formed against us that shall prosper Lord God that's what your Bible says organize that song says we don't have to fear Lord God we don't have to fear God give us power love and a sound mind tonight God father I'm just leaning on you Lord I'm tired I'm exhausted I'm worn out my voice is really weary but Lord your strength is sufficient in weakness Lord God so so help me and help your people father God we're so happy to Dance For You Lord God Lord if there's one thing I want to say in my life I want to lift you higher Dear God I want to make Jesus greater and greater Lord God because I know I'm nothing God I know I'm a failure Lord each one of us do Lord God so we rejoice in the blood of Jesus Christ and thank you God for making us overcome us Lord God Hallelujah we know the story Lord we know how the story ends Lord God we're fighting a battle that's already won as Shane and Shane saying Lord God we're just fighting the battle you've already won Dear God you've already given us Assurance of Victory so we thank you for that victory tonight Lord God thank you for your food and due season I pray you minister to your people tonight God I'm nothing I can't help anybody Lord as I've seen you time and time again I pray you just speak to your people here tonight God because you are faithful Lord Jesus we love you and worship you in Jesus Christ's name the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God bless you are we live streaming then okay praise God God bless the life Chambers and certainly love everybody by God's grace I have a few slides I'd like to share here if I can get this plugged in here so uh I'm gonna set the timer I hope I just really want to preach about half an hour I don't even know that's possible but and I want to I want to stop the live stream and just share some personal things from this weekend that meant a lot to me and and some of the people I know that were involved and then I just thought too I'd like to have a little testimony if anybody has a testimony from the weekend I'd like you to come share it maybe by God's grace I like to put you on the spot because I know everybody likes being put on the spot no I know you don't but we sure would like to hear some testimonies you know I would like I would like I did something you know for each person so brother Adam's text of course was you know uh First Kings 17 like we read one to seven and of course speaking of uh Elijah Elijah now a little later once it gets into a sermon he says I'm going to type this great ministry tonight of Elijah and the time of Elijah with the hour that we're now in I believe it's a perfect type so he says verses one to seven are a perfect type okay so as you'll see later on the type is is that God's word has been spoken and then judgment is upon the unbelievers so that's not us God's grace is on us how many can say Amen to that we are with Elijah praise God we believe Elijah's message can I say can you say Amen to that I believe it Bill Graham's message I believe it um so that's the type you're eventually going to see he gets to that and the whole point of this type is that we will be like Elijah will have his word and then we will hide away with God okay while the world is suffering drought now brother man types it it's a spiritual drought while the world is suffering spiritual drought we're enjoying the blessings of God being shut away with God amen so he says verses one to seven is a perfect type I can see that I can see that because of the scripture Amos and so forth we'll get to that here in a little bit by God's grace Brother Bear mentions that scripture right in the sermon he said and then of course they had a he preached really short I think it might have been like a 40-minute sermon then the rest of time he spent praying for the sick if you listen if it's only an hour and a half this sermon the whole whole recording from beginning to end now he says that type there I'm going to type Elijah with a church today the Church of today just before judgment he received this message Elijah he represented being cared for in the natural his natural food because it wasn't going to rain now according to the word of the Lord for three years and six months or until Elijah called for him whatever time you say Elijah that's what it'll be therefore he walks up to the king and said there will not even be do fall till I call for it that's quite a load isn't it that's quite a message now think about think about what prophets have spoken I mean this this just blows my mind he stands there and says there will be no do until I call for it Joshua stood there and he said Son stand still it's never been done before and it's never been done after Moses said let there be flies and then nine other plagues I mean these guys have to be filled with God's spirit to speak such things like that because we can try to claim things right we've all tried to I'm guilty we can all try to claim and speak things but does it happen it's a different story when you're a prophet right that's why these guys are called prophets that's why we honor them as Prophets because they have power to speak for God they're speaking on God's behalf and that's why church that's why you know even I you know Jesus says uh like we preached on a few weeks ago they call them Gods to whom the word of God came to like see I don't even like to put myself in that position because look what these guys said yeah I mean I've spoken a few times a few situations thank God for the answer but to me it's just not on this level this is a whole The Profit level is a whole another level that's just that's just me you know and I just feel like we should be humble you know he said that's quite a message now we're going to type that with a spiritual drama today now we all know we're very aware there's a great spiritual drought in the land today spiritual speaking and you know that this was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of Christ would be there would come a famine in the land and it won't be for bread alone but for the hearing of the word of God and that day is now hearing the true word of God you know church I uh I got back from the weekend you know so it's on fire I was tired but I was on fire and I just scroll and I think it was Sunday night yeah I got home and you know I was getting ready for bed and everything I saw oh they had a service at Lincoln Memorial in Washington Washington D.C and I clicked on there I said I'm just going to fast forward to the end what did this preacher say like so what so what is the world preaching um you know I compared to what the lord gave me for Sunday morning the lord gave me you know the the thought about how Jesus is is so faithful Even in our mistakes he he even though the Sheep are scattered he goes and gathers them all back and then if you're risen with Christ you'll crucify right so this guy talks about what this this worldly preacher we'd say worldly preacher denominational preacher whatever he is he talks about how God accepts homosexuals and how that we that we have God in us and we just gotta tell people that Jesus is Alive that that was just the basics of it I mean listen I kept waiting for something about repentance and uh but he he said imagine we have God's Own Spirit living in this we have the uh we have eternal life living in us and church it was all good news now good it was all good stuff now of course the homosexual stuff is not I thought well let me just compare what God gave us to come compared to what the denominations got today I was just so I was so astounded because there was no mention of any dying out to self no mortification right no sanctification it's just we we you know Jesus is Alive and our his spirit's on us and we just got to tell others that he's alive now I believe we got to tell her he's alive but when we're not doing that we got to die to ourselves if we're risen with Christ those things that are above yes I just thought well what what a great and so see that's why people will drive I think there was 10 000 people there at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday morning and it was a it was a uh sunrise service so they were there while it was dark now look at look at the dedication look at the dedication I've never been I think I may have only been to one or two sunrise services in my life you know in denominationalism but look at the dedication they'll drive 10 000 people drive across the country or drive across or fly in they said people flew in from all over the nation to be there that morning and they hear and they're here there they hear the word of God now church what do you think what's your judgment did they hear the fresh word of God or was there a spiritual drought there drought they're flying all in they think it's going to be some some great move of God and then here we are a tiny little church in Napoleon Ohio repenting of our sins dancing rejoicing praising the Lord shouting screaming crying I don't know if anybody spoke in tongues but it would have been a good atmosphere to speak in tongues Hallelujah it would have been a great atmosphere to get healed and so forth like that that's what I was praying for but I just thought wow what a contrast of a people that in Napoleon that get the rain from God and then the people that are in a spiritual drought it's the same old same old and now they're just letting more goats in all the time now I'm not trying to be critical but I'm just saying once you allow sin it's just letting the goats in right you can't allow the goats in I thought wow what a perfect application from this today we ought to be able to recognize they they just have a drought they can't hear the true word of God now the man said many right things but then he also said some bad things and he left out so much too there's so much that was left out so what was left out is like the drought right we didn't get the rain we didn't hear all the truth right they didn't hear everything they should have heard he said sit and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought the place to this coming oncoming judgment then they had turned from God's word and his Prophet to a modern theological terms of the word right just know him by theology all these three persons and let's recite the Creed let's allow sin to come into the church that's theology right that's man-made theology now here's a scripture brother Ryan was talking about Amos behold the days come saith the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord and they shall wander and look at this from sea to Sea from North even to East they shall run to and fro to seek the war Lord and shall not find it they think they're hearing the word of God but they're not hearing the word of God and let me say this blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear because we can see their sin loving Doctrine taking them further down further away from Christ as if they're as if as if they're I'm sorry as if they have no rain praise God as if they're drying out yeah on the outside they got all the they got the fancy sunglasses they got the leather jackets I mean they look like they're hip and cool and Rich they look like they got everything figured out it's perfectly loud to see a rich and increase with Goods have need of nothing the guy was testified oh we started our church with 34 people now we're up to 600 whatever like like that's a is that a measurement of God's blessing not always not always it could be if it is well I sure miss God a long time ago praise God as far as I know I've been serving God as best as I can in all these years but I realize they are they don't have the reign of the word of God so it's still Trinity still sprinkling right it's still sin loving religion all these things I realize I really know what church and you know you do too we know what the reign of God produces praise God we know what God's Reign brings to the believer praise God refreshing amen that's what the Bible says it's refreshment in the presence of the Lord Hallelujah you notice here it's just at that time God always raised up something because he always he he does nothing until he first reveals it to the people and he always reveals it to his servants the prophets now but Elijah during this time had a secret place that God had ordained for him to go that's the thing we want to see now just before we have the prayer line he's only been preaching like 10 minutes Elijah had a secret place provided by God himself now the church now look at this the church never provided for him the key never provided for him he didn't provide himself but God provided a secret place for Elijah to be fed all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day let me just say this I can't provide the secret place for you what I do is I preach about the secret place amen hallelujah amen can't provide the secret place for us he he can't sing us into that secret place his singing will not take us in there Malachi's playing Lydia's playing they will not take it in there we're singing about that secret place but each one of us have to choose to go into that secret place that's what brother says the church the church can't take you there you know like nobody can do it it's it's each one of us submitting to the Holy Spirit praise God and walking a secret consecrated life with Jesus Christ feeding on God's word every day have you have you found on God's word today praise God if not now's a good time Hallelujah see that daily need for God is that daily communion with the Lord he didn't need to wonder what's what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply will run out I wonder if God will have enough word for me for tomorrow I wonder if God's word will be able to keep me in 2023 the rest of the way right got about six more months right I'm sorry eight more months right can God's word keep me the rest of this year we have to wonder about that God said I've commanded the Ravens and they'll feed you what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place where where is it in Christ Christ is the word Christ is the Holy Ghost our secret place is fellowship in the Holy Ghost now I'd like to just you know move from that sermon I'll get back to that sermon I'm going to move here to some scriptures about the importance of words in due season now think about your life you know a word you heard the word of God right at the right time you think about the examples you know you could pull out in your life when Austin really needed to hear that God loved him and Austin be loved to the Lord talk about it we're in due season buddy Hallelujah each one of Simon when he preached there nine I mean the certain nine events of my life talk about here in a word and due season I mean it just blew my mind you know right when we need it it seems like right we need it that's what God shows up praise God you know why because he knows you want to be in that secret place with him amen that's right that's right Hallelujah he knows he knows you're waiting on him so he shows up and gives you the word for the due season and of course you could church I didn't do this but you could take this all down through the Bible think about how each person had a word induced Enoch had the word for the Rapture in the season Noah had the word this is the season to build the ark the word and then and then the season was get in and then the season was uh then the season finally was the Dove's not coming back now it's time to leave the ark and think about the words that he needed in every season we could run this thing all the way down to the Bible think about Elijah said he said Elisha if you want a double anointing that's a hard thing to ask he said but if you watch me you'll get it by God's grace look at the word and new season you had to know you had to hear the word at the right time the church as children of god let's just let's just agree to this tonight I'm sure you do but let's just believe since God loves us so much God will bring us the word at the right time and he'll make sure we don't miss it too if God took Enoch in the Rapture without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we got it we're going to praise God Amen he had blood of bulls and ghosts we got the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things better things that's just how I believe that's how I believe it that's how I live my life I know there's I know there's five and a six hour services like Saturday night but I also know there's two hour services right think about that if you did a six hour service every night how would you feel after about a couple days you wouldn't be able to come to church you'd be passed out you'd be in the hospital they'd be pumping oxygen in you at least I would be if I was preaching I know that I'd be out of water and everything but you could take this all out onto the Bible you know God's word always comes at the right season right when you need it that's just what you needed to hear exactly right praise God now of course they needed natural rain in due season and God promised Israel if you walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments to them then I'll give you the rain right at the right time you obey God's word I'll send the rain right when your seeds needed remember rain something they can't control so the natural needs were based upon their spiritual obedience that's now that's not here in America right because people we have sin loving Nations or cities like New York and California they still get rain I know California is running out that might be a spiritual application but it wasn't like on one nation like with Israel just one God was focusing on that one nation right one nation so this was based upon the natural rain and due season was based upon their spiritual obedience in every season another one uh revolving I'm sorry involving sacrifices God no no notice God required them at the certain season to make a sacrifice he said he told Moses command the children of Israel and say to them my offering and my bread and for my sacrifices made by fire for a sweet saber to me you should observe them to offer me in their due season so God had a set season also God said you got to obey me and then he said you got to do it at the right season praise God now we know the seven piece of Israel I preached on that I wrote it you know I got I got it in chapter two I think it is in my book in the 2021 book but God had specific details here's how you Worship On this day and then uh uh you know the the first three feasts were three days in a row right and then you 50 days to the Feast of Weeks and then three more months and then you had three more feasts right in a row and these were specific times if they wanted God's favor they had to be obedient in the right season right so let's let's uh let's have it in our hearts tonight that we're going to make the sacrifices when God wants us to praise God let's not let's out withhold worship let's not withhold of sacrifice let's give God everything we can praise God which actually let me go back here you did do that last weekend by God's grace by making the great sacrifice to go there if you could I know we Austin was working and everything like that but I'm just saying the people that could get off and I know Austin wanted to make that sacrifice praise God uh that's just just the point I'm making everybody brother Cam and them were blessed by the sacrifice that was made and look here George here you know behind this it wasn't like a legalistic like God's mad at me God's love was behind all this and that's why I always want you to see and I hope you felt that when I as I preached it obedience is always based upon love God's not trying to beat us down and make us feel like we're just Mindless robots it's all like God's love wants us to obey God love God's love wants us to draw closer to him like the motivation is always love it's not that we're worthless or anything like that or or we should feel worthless God doesn't come to condemn us but in God's love God God is saying this is going to produce the best life for you this is going to produce happiness for you if you can mortify your desires if you can crucify your desires it'll make you the happiest you ever be right if we're not convinced of that look at the people out there still addicted to drugs look at the people that have been married two three four times they think they think uh satisfying their flesh is going to make them happier it doesn't it makes them angrier it makes them bitter right it makes it makes them sad it makes them depressed God's ways always produce Joy he said this is a land the Lord thy God cares for the eyes of the Lord God are always upon Him God's always looking after this land now what about the bride amen if you just looked at that natural piece of land what about his his blood-bought people praise God the Bible said the Bible even says God's eyes run to and fro around the whole world right his eyes are constantly running around the whole world well if you believe it's flat then it's like this I guess [Laughter] but they're they're constantly running around and look the Bible says God's always on it oh isn't that beautiful church God don't sleep or slumber you know you're going through a hard time God's not sleeping God you hear me God uh can you wake up Lord no he hears us all the time he's testing us he's training us praise God he's teaching us to trust in him praise God look from the beginning of the year even what to the end praise God we're almost in the middle of this year is he still with us yes he said he'll be there at the beginning he'll be there at the end too he's right here in the middle almost we're almost to the middle it should come to pass if you shall dip now looking look at this hearken diligently in other words put your whole heart into it unto my Commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God see the love hearken diligently in other words give God your love with all of you all that you've got serving with all your heart with your soul that'll give you the reign of your land in his due season the first Reign the latter rain that thou mayest Gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil see it's about love it's about letting love motivate you to diligently certain I'm sorry diligently serve God pardon me this chapter is beautiful I read this this week I I hope I can convey this help me Holy Spirit to convey this uh this is a long chapter but he says there go the ships and there's the Leviathan remember that's the water the water dinosaur the Bible Hebrew calls it a serpent it's a serpent dinosaur talk about those sea serpents right they got movies about sea serpents well yeah there used to be I used to be whom thou Hast made to play therein now look Church These weights all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season that thou give us them they gather thou openest thine hand they are filled with good look church every living creature seeks food from God in their season I didn't look online but I could make a guess about how many billions of creatures there are in this world how many fish do you think really are in the ocean right now who could put a number on that how many how many whales or how many dolphins how many minnows are out there in the ocean how many crayfish right you can start naming all the life I've not studied up on that lately so I can't give you all the the different kinds but look the Bible said every single living creatures waiting on God to feed them now what about you how many waiting on God to feed them I think I think the creator of all the world one person God sits up there he says I can take I can feed all of them I only have to make a Sweat Right he said they're all going to come to his hand and they're going to all feed out of his hand that's how God pictures all creation coming to him to feed him to give them what their meat in due season God it's been a hard season just wait Church his hands open praise God stands open that's what the Bible says he opens his hand he said here it is just keep trusting to me so it's the sea serpents not anymore I don't know if there are any more but the sea dinosaurs they're waiting on God can you imagine the dinosaurs are swimming through the ocean I'm just waiting on you Lord I'm just waiting on you how silly can I make myself look to try to get the point across or just swimming I'm waiting on you Lord I'm waiting for waiting for a good catch here pretty soon I'll just keep swimming until I finally get something every one of them Church every one of them just waiting on the Lord see church now we don't feel so alone do we all of creation is Waiting on Jesus Christ oh he's faithful now earlier in this chapter the Young Lions Roar after they pray and what they do they seek their meat from from who Mother Nature the zebra families see even the lions are looking to God for food so next time you squirm you watch an animal kill another the next time you scream I don't feel so bad because God provided that lions are there in the world and God each one God knows each one well that one needs a that one needs food I think about a zookeeper they got they got a schedule right they gotta feed this one at that time how about God's schedule in the zoo of the world the zoo of the entire Earth he's got it all planned out same chapter he sends the Springs into the valley so he sends water to The Valleys which run among the Hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches so all the beasts rely upon the Lord for water God sent the water out there right where he knew it would be it gives them food gives him water every Beast relies on the Lord he causes the grass to grow for the cattle the herb for the service of man I should show that to my wife she'd like that she's a herbal that's right that he may bring forth food out of the Earth the wine that maketh glad the heart of man and the oil to make his face shine and bread which strengtheneth the man's heart he said I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live I will sing praise to my God while I have my being my meditation of him shall be sweet or Pleasant so so thinking of all this thinking of all that all nature is waiting on God to feed them they're all Waiting for God to open up his hand and feed them that ought to make us have sweet meditation about Jesus that if he's faithful to feed all those fouls of the air all the fish of the sea all the cattles of the field he he will give us our food in due season as well they're talking so much natural I'm talking about spiritual praise God thank God for the natural blessings in America thank God and then he kind of kind of gives a rebuke on Sinners there and he says bless thou the Lord O My Soul bless ye the Lord so church that's tonight you know as we're as we're you know moving on here I'm not sure when I'm finishing meditate on God's pleasantness and look at this his absolute faithfulness to all living creatures he is absolutely faithful when a lion's hungry he Roars we think he's roaring to scare him away but he's probably worn to God where where's my meat in due season God hears it God said I'm getting ready there it is he'll open his hand and feed him that's how much God cares he is absolutely faithful to feed the Natural Things of this world so he is the spiritual now church now think about that with with our with our two sermons we heard from Sunday right or I heard the one from the denominations and the one we had ours is the only one where God opened up his hand and said come feed on my word the other one was not God's hand right if they sought God's hand if you seek me you'll find me so see they're seeking after what bigger buildings fancier musicians or more popular musicians and bigger production more money that's what they're seeking after popularity we're seeking after the Risen Christ and again I'm not trying to be critical I hope everybody can feel that I'm not trying to be critical I'm just saying there has to be a difference there has to be because the Bible says so there's a famine in this land and most people are not hearing the word of God well I don't want to be one of those I want to be one of the people that hear God's word and church honestly with all my heart my soul is not in a drought I feel refreshed if I've ever felt refreshing it'd be from this weekend praise God but let me say this too because of my sins and my failure sometimes sometimes I feel like I'm in a drought you'd have to say Amen too loud but I'll be honest there's times I feel like I'm gonna drown but that's my fault but if I look at the overall course of my life God is sending his reign the God is set in his room I'm saying Lord Send the Rain send the word he sends the word in new season you know why because he cares he loves to send his word to his people every time I go back to the Bible every time I go back to brother and quote I hear something oh that's right that's right I forgot about that Hallelujah that's new oh thank you Jesus amen it's refreshing the times are refreshing come from the presence of the Lord the Bible says now a few chapters later is how many yeah 41 chapters later thy kingdom is the Everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth throughout all generations the Lord upholdeth now look he upholds all that fall and raises up all those that be bowed down so if you trip and fall guess who's going to catch you Jesus he would say oh Jesse don't stumble over that here get up or if you're bowed down he'll come around and he'll lift you up to push that chest back a little bit and lift your head up if you're not just looking at your your symptoms all the time or looking at your situation he'll cause you to look up to heaven seek ye things that are above praise God where the Lord sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high praise God ah it's the one who Catches Us God's the one that will straighten us up again praise God this is the Old Testament the Lord and he says the eyes of all wait upon thee so look everybody's really looking to God everybody animals humans everyone's looking we're all waiting on God and God is faithful to give them their meat in due season everybody's looking at him right everybody's looking what's he going to do when are you going to send it God I'm looking to you God I'm looking to God I need a financial blessing right I need a healing or I I want my I want my loved ones to be saved everybody's looking to God at all these things and the Bible said God is faithful to give them their meat in due season he's faithful he's faithful he says Thou openest thine hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing every every how many plants are there in the world how many trees how many ants are there in the world God satisfied my monsters I hope your worry or your doubt or fear is starting to fade praise God yes he hears every one of them it's it's amazing when I read this the other day I was like what I said God I was like forgive me why do you doubt so much silly he's so human all the time trust the Lord without counsel purposes are disappointing of course that's Holy Ghost Council Jesus I counted I counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire white Raymond I South also you know you can look at in the book of Acts you know when there was questions they would go to the elders they would go to Paul and James and Peter so trusted people so there's times when we do need to have counsel from others I've needed it we all need it but in the multitude of counselors they are established but you want Godly counselors in your life um a man has Joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good it is think of what brother man spoke to Hattie Wright you know I think about what Hattie Wright said that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon that was a word in due season because it brought forth the salvation of her voice think about I read this remember a couple weeks ago Mina's tumor she was going getting ready to go to the appointment there and the Holy Spirit said stand up and brother Brown stood up and he says whatever you say that's what will be and brother man said before the doctor's hand could touch the tumor it will vanish and then just maybe an hour later she was there to you know Across the Nation she was there at the doctor's office was sitting on the table had the tumor and within a few moments it vanished by God's grace a word in due season how good it is and then of course I'll get to this later but the Easter Service is there in Napoleon it was the word in due season a word in due season and just to prove that you know not every Service is like that Sarah nice service right because it's a different different season you know it's a different time it's a different need for that night like I was thinking too like I don't know if I haven't been in a service like that that long maybe 10 or 11 or 12 years that long it's been a while it's been a while um well like but like I said again you know we don't make those type of service those types of services aren't evidence that we're born again and let me give you some Bible proof on that okay everybody ready for this are we ready okay Acts chapter 10. Peter sees a vision right no Lord honest it's unclean I'm never gonna eat that he said go to the house of cardios Cornelius bows down to worship and he said get up I'm just a man he said but I got something to preach to you go gather your people he preached him a five-minute sermon and the Holy Ghost fell in that place amen amen and the church said did he have to pray all night the corneas have to fast all night do they have to have a five hour service no he was already Justified and Sanctified he was ready for God's spirit to pour into and praise God oh he was ready for the word and due season praise God amen but do we so see it doesn't take a five-hour service that's why the Bible doesn't say thou shalt pray all night and then get the Holy Ghost the Bible don't say that you get the Holy Ghost when you're ready for that word and due season praise God what's the season forget born again that's when you get born again but those are great special moments you know when you have long surfaces or pray all night or whatever whatever God gives you those are special moments to enjoy the presence of God but Cornelius didn't have to wait five hours he just had a five I mean you could look at the it was a five-minute sermon if that and the Holy Ghost fell right there so see what we want to be doing we want to be balanced in the word of God that's what we really want and yes we want to draw all night of God yes we want to enjoy the presence of God but really the word in due season is what God determines it to be and then of course this is a parable I'm not going to just for times like I'm not gonna I could preach a whole sermon on just this parable but Jesus says who is that he's talking about the day and the hour no man knows and two will be in a field want to be taken two will be in a bed want to be taken of course the Rapture he said who then is that faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made him ruler over his household to give them meat in due season so so Jesus gives two different kind of preachers one of them he's looking for the coming of the Lord and so he's feeding the people meat so they can be ready for the Lord's coming the other one says oh he's the land is coming Jesus ain't coming back anytime soon I'm going to start smiting the people I'm gonna start beating the people and I'm gonna start getting drunk so you have two different kinds now church I believe we gotta we have faithful ministers that come to our church I believe I'm a faithful Minister I believe you're getting the meet and due season if I didn't uh I need to be voted out praise God and get somebody in here who who will feed your soul Faithfully praise God I've been standing at this Pulpit I've been standing at this Pulpit since 2006 praise God almost 17 years giving people the meat and due season praise God Amen I see myself growing in the grace of God now Naomi Naomi who would have thought we'd been dancing in Akron praise God like you dancing God praise God see we're growing right we're growing did you almost feel home on Saturday night by the way let's give her a horizon that's what I was thinking of something I was like I wonder if her and Beatrice are really enjoying this or not I wonder if they feel like they're free like they are at home you know because I've always desired that you know I've always known you know they have a dance they get to dance in Ghana almost every service I just always wanna I hope they can feel at home some at some point in America Hallelujah but see a faithful Minister gives people the word a new season now like I've told you sometimes I come to Papa I don't even know what I'm going to preach and God will give you the meat sometimes I know I got directly like Saturday night I knew that was exactly God's service for that night nobody was going to talk me out of that I knew two months ago I was going to preach that sermon at Cam's Church if you would ask me I would have told you I can actually prove it I got my journal I got over in January I was a preached dancing in the point I can show you I knew I was going to preach out I knew that was the word in due season um I had uh three or four Witnesses on that I knew it was the right the right message but it's all God it's all God you know sometimes you just sometimes you just know things sometimes you just know things it's what is it it's God leading you because we're just sheep and we can't lead ourselves so I need somebody to Lead Me praise God because God just leads us right he leads us on um I just got a couple more here let's see yeah be not deceived church God is Not mocked for whatsoever man plants in his life that will he Harvest whatever we plant every single day that's the kind of things we're going to harvest if we plant to the flesh if we enjoy sins and keep sinning we're gonna of the flesh reap corruption but if we sow to the Holy Spirit so shall we reap of the spirit life Everlasting I love this let us not be weary in well-doing I wonder how many sermons I preach from the time we you know in 2011 when I dance around there for I dance for two hours around that church I wonder how many sermons I preached from 2011 until last Saturday night some of those I could have got weary I could look back and said when are we ever going to have Revival right I could have I could have got weary in well doing I could say well I'll just throw in the towel we're never gonna have Revival what do we keep believing we keep believing that God keeps his word and God orders the events of Our Lives anyway right our thing is to just keep crying out for meat and due season because that's what all the that's what all living creatures do feed me Lord feed me Lord Roar feed me Lord whatever like a lion that's what we must do we must say God feed me God feed me God feed me God feed me and he'll say I'll feed you at the right time I always give meat in due season praise God I'm faithful to every living creature because in just be just be faithful church that's the main thing I found just be faithful to God just Faithfully confess your sins seek God every day be as faithful as possible in due season we will reap a harvest if we faint not and as we have therefore opportunity let's keep our eyes open let's do good unto all men but especially the Saints right here in Akron and the church said let's be especially good to one another I hope I'm good to you I really want to be good to you you're the ones God put in my circle of influence I can't help people other any other place I can only help the people right here I hope I've been good to you praise God that's what I want to do I want to keep doing that if I have by God's grace I believe I have if I'm not God help me we should especially be good to those of the household of faith now so the final brother brand closes this sermon Here's the final application he uses I kind of mentioned it earlier but just so you can see it notice there was meal in the barrel every time she went after the meal now brother man breaks into the next story but his text was only you know with with Elijah at the brook and the Ravens feeding him but he breaks into this other the next story it's verses eight to 16. every time that Widow went to the meal there was a meal in the barrel there was oil in the cruise every time she went for it why meal represented Christ in the meal offering the birds had to be set just right to grind every one of them every bird of this meal exactly the same showing that he's the same yesterday today and forever that was the word the bread of life following the message to vindicate the word so it is today friends so it is today that the bread of life that children eat on it follows the message of God to sustain them during the time of the drought so while everybody is in a drought we are not we have we have food in this drought we are sustained we're not ignored and we're not starving we have sustainment we have nourishment praise God we have nourishment in the midst of this drought right what if he stood in our presence today what if he stood in our presence right now we would act and do just exactly like he'd done the days when he was in the flesh here on Earth so Jesus he would do the same right Jesus would act the same I imagine Church don't you think he'd rebuked some of us for not have enough faith but would you ever leave us or forsake us of course not if it I mean if I can handle rebuke from anybody it's Jesus praise God because he died for me he loves me amen I know he wants the best for me praise God and I'm not trying to hang around with the devil I'm trying to hang around with Jesus Christ praise God I'm trying to he's my best friend he's my Lord praise God I can handle a review from Jesus he's only going to help me praise God the only what's the best for me amen I'm his child you're his child amen you're his son you're his daughter praise God he would treat us the same way as he did the disciples in the Bible the bride is part of the husband the church is the same as Christ The Works that I do shall you do also it is the word that done it he told us the things that he did that he would also do we notice here again if the word is in us and has come to us as it did to Elijah in that day it'll do the same thing that he did it would feed on the secret things of God which is hid from the world oh again it makes the message and the messenger won the spiritual food is ready and it's in season now and each one of you can have this food if you wish how many wish for it if now here you can have it if you're willing to what steal away from all the unbelief so in other words you gotta you have to say I'm not gonna disbelieve I'm gonna believe if you're ready to come into Christ come into his promise and what are these promises brother Jess I'll be happy to read them I'm actually making this video I'm almost done with this video there's I got 30 verses of how brother Ram defines the message I got 30 right now I'm sure there's a lot more I'm about 33 done hopefully I can have it done by Friday or Saturday and remember his promises in Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 also Saint John 14 12 and how many more scriptures of telling Joel 2 28. what he would do in these last days how the prophet said it'd be light in these last days how it would work what it would do and all the scriptures pointing these last days and that is Christ what is what is Christ the scriptures are Christ Hallelujah if you can hide away in that now in what I'm gonna how can I hide in Malachi 4. because I can see I'm one of the children whose hearts are turned back to the fathers I gotta hide in that verse in other words God I'm just a child and just turn my heart to be like the book of Acts praise God Amen right how could I hide I can hide in John 14 12 The Works that I do so you do also we gotta hide in that yes I can lay my hands on the sick they shall recover Hallelujah some of us will speak in tongues the Bible says these signs follow them that believe praise God some of us will cast out devils like I said they'll cast them out with the music amen amen amen right if you're sick there's healing oh yeah I'm sorry if you can hide away in that now in that secret place you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God see God's not hammering us like oh you poor person or you're awful person God it's God's care God cares God wants to pour His mercy and goodness on us in a time of drought he puts you in a place there where he can feed you and actually it's in Christ it's not by a brook right it's not an underground layer you know you know it's not it's not at the top of a skyscraper it's in Christ in Jesus Christ the word so Church you got to find a verse whatever we struggle with this week or now we got to find a verse and we got to hide in that verse Lord you said Lord you said just like the Lions you're gonna leave here thinking I'm just like a lion I'm just I'm like I'm just like a bird well one way yeah in One Way You Are you're his creation and you're calling to him keep your promise Lord God I know you'll do it right but we're not gonna be discouraged you're going to keep your promise I'm your child open your hand to me open it up I need a great blessing praise God if you're sick there's healing there and now today he visits the Gentiles in their time and it's and you say why is it that the message don't go out in these great big places like these big Crusades like amongst the denominations it's not their food it's not the church so-called food it's the bride's food it's spiritual food in season it would make them sick at their stomach to hear a sermon about the serpent seed right to your sermon about marriage and divorce oh there's only one cause for remarriage that'd make them sick to their stomachs women having long hair and not wearing makeup and Men clean up their lives and not a bunch of whoremongers that would make them sick to their stomach it's too rich for them that's kind of how my wife is and she stayed from away from sugar so long like she can't even handle like some sweets I could still handle them sometimes I have sweets but she's been so far from sugar she can't even handle something I'm like really that tastes too sweet to me that sounds just right for me but it all depends like that's how it is not spiritually right the churches can't handle the richness of God's word that we that we receive it's too rich for them brothers says it's too rich and make them sick to their stomach he says see you can't you can't do it but for the children it's bread it's life it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now we're going to get too late if we don't start the prayer line I want you to see I want you to listen to his prayer listen to prayer before he starts this is finishing finishing up the thought it's just a simple short sermon spiritual food and due season dear God food induced season spiritual food something that the world knows nothing of I didn't know nothing about this I was raised in church I didn't know nothing about the spiritual food we got today all these great Promises of God how we hear our Lord say that night or that day down there at Samaria the same place that Elisha walked up and said why the Dew will not fall for I call oh there's a mistake in me there you go it was Elijah Elijah not Elijah every words I say the Lord here's to Jesus there tell his disciples said Master why don't you eat he said look at that in John 4 he said I have food that you don't know of what was Jesus food the food was to do the will of God to see the works of God May manifest in his hour praise God he was there to see that it was done I do nothing except my father shows me first what the father shows me that I do and father so is it today the church the True Believer the body of Believers has access to food spiritual food that the nominals know nothing about the world knows nothing about of this food father but your church your people the Bride of your son loves it oh I love this word amen bring Simon in here bring cam in here bring brother Diggs in here bring brother Brian Hawkins in here I love God's food praise God I'm going to say Amen to God's food because I know it's just going to be just exactly what I need at the right hour we have access to healing of our bodies when the doctors has failed we have access to this it's one of the foods of God that He gave to his church and promised in the last day to his believing children and father help us to be believing children for all things are possible to the Believers granted dear God we ask it in Jesus name amen and notice this is just kind of for me but also for you the importance of Doctrine we have to have the right Doctrine brother random in this sermon at the end brother man says but the lord gave me what I should do in my message he said do the work of evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the hour will arrive when they will not endure sound Doctrine if that hasn't come now every church denomination has turned me down they wouldn't endure sound Doctrine think of that why'd they turn brother Branham down because of his Doctrine right he said after their own lust so see true Doctrine will cut out all the lusts right it'll show the the sinfulness of lust they'll bring their own teachers in and they'll be turned into fables like I saw a preacher down in Georgia he has a huge mega church he he uh he's inviting homosexuals and he said homosexuals have way more faith than us because they still come to church even though churches preach against homosexuality he said they have more faith than me and this guy sold millions of books Christian he says they have more faith because they've been they've been spoken against yet they still come to church it's amazing what people will say but these are teachers bringing in their own lusts the Bible said they'll be itching ears now Church don't be wrong I want every homosexual to come in here but leave out not a homosexual praise God just like I want every fornicator to come in here leave out pure before God and not a fornicator anymore every cigarette smoker cocaine addict prostitute would ever be I want you to come in here but I want you to leave out Washed by the blood amen I want you to I want you to get out of that drought I want you to get the reign of Christ on your life praise God Amen once you get the refreshing and the presence of Jesus Christ amen so if you leave out of here refresh praise God change a new creature in Christ Jesus so I hope you understand what I'm saying by God's grace we want him to come in but we want them to be changed by the word of God okay I think I'll just finish up here um yeah the Bible says there come a time when they won't endure sound Doctrine and remember Simon preaches Balaam had the same Spirit anointing him on Moses but what was the difference the teaching of Moses Moses was what perfect that's one thing I believe we have by God's grace now we're not perfect every word but overall generally we have the perfect teaching of the Bible we don't have every detail but overall we have the complete teaching right three works of Grace we've got the Mysteries the Seven Seals Holy Ghost the power of God we teach perfectly on all these things for the most part no one's no one will ever be absolutely perfect outside of Christ but generally we have the complete revelation of true Doctrine and the Bible says my Doctrine shall drop as rain praise God hallelujah it's refreshing when you hear the real truth it's refreshing to you oh again like Saturday night brother Cam said oh we never heard a a the right balance on dancing like we did tonight he said it just dropped down like rain Harmony got wet I got wet praise God and then brother random says uh brother Brown says his ministry was the teaching reign so anyone that received brother Adam's teaching they got the reign of the Holy Spirit they got the reign of the doctrine right he says the latter rain can only come after the former Reign which is the teaching rain and the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this how could the how could Azusa Street which we preached on be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not yet come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and their turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come okay
