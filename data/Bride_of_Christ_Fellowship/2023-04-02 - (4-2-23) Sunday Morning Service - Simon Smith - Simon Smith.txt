========================================

so I had to read by myself it was you know and uh if I'd listen to a couple sermons and you know the prophet God taught one called giving respects or something like it's called respects and just how you ought to honor Christ and give him uh all the glory why because we're sitting we're standing here as Sinners who were saved and we were all lost at a time and we're so grateful for what God did in our lives our brother had called me uh yesterday and he asked me he said Simon he goes I don't have the Holy Ghost he goes and I still struggle with smoking he says am I still saved am I saved I said yes brother you're saved right now you're at that justification level I said and just continue to come to church continue reading don't worry about that that'll fall off God's not God there's one thing we're serving God looks at the heart and I said brother you just keep reading the Bible keep praying those things will fall off that's that thing those things falling off are called sanctification and I saw then when he were clean and God sees and you've believed every word and waited for him to clean you up then he comes and fills you with the Holy Ghost so hopefully we're able to bring the modification there and clear that up for him is you know the devil fights everybody and the battles are raging hard so uh let's get into the scripture here if you could turn to uh Romans 11. Romans 11. so Romans 11 here let me get through to myself but there's still a songbook down everybody have a good week this week and as long as you're still standing and in the in this truth we ought to be grateful I heard some people maybe you know some people are struggling and uh some maybe even on the verge of quitting but imagine quitting right now at this time when we're seeing they're literally telling everybody hey this thing's collapsing it's going to collapse the banks are bankrupt look what the prophet said 60 years ago and what he's talking about right then is happening right now so we're literally at that hour it's almost like the vision is catching up and we've got to then once it catches we've got to start walking in that and fulfilling all his righteousness so Romans 11 verse 1 sorry to keep holding there standing Romans 11 verse 1 he says and I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid he says for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham and of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people which he foreknew I want you not that but the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars he says I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal hi the image of Baal verse five now notice what now Paul picks up right there says even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace amen so let's jump down to verse 16 as well got a little lengthy reading here by guns Greece verse 16. for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the the root be holy so are the branches see look we're all depending on that Holy root who's that root who's the root and offspring of David Jesus Christ he says and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree we're grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and the fatness of the Olive Tree boasts not against the branches but of thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root the thou will then uh say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou stand Us by faith be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee see that's why we'll be so humble Reverend because remember well you'll see here in a little while here by God's grace we have but we're not to think any more higher than we ought to verse 22. behold therefore the goodness and severity of God of then on them which fell severity he says but toward the goodness if thou continue in his goodness see how it's just not a one-step deal we've got to continue on now notice he says towards he says if thou continue in this goodness otherwise Thou shalt be cut off see the danger of this we've got to go all the way to the end and they also if they abide not stealing unbelief shall be grafted in for God is able to graft them in again why because he's the husbandman he is the great the remember if Adam was a garden keeper then then uh the second Adam would be the garden keeper of his garden right here on Earth remember he says he went into a field and sowed on these seeds and this and that and the enemy came and sowed seas behind him and those sort of things he is the husbandman now let's continue on here verse 24 for if thou word cut out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and we're grafted contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own Olive Tree now notice verse 25 I think yeah we'll continue on verse 25. oh I guess I do have all that never mind for I would not Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel unto the fullness of the Gentiles become in so let's say a word of prayer here and father Lord Jesus Lord we come humbly Lord and Lord God giving you respects Lord for you're the creator of heavens and earth Lord and Lord how you've even created us Lord and Lord God we were wrought in your image Lord God our lord Jesus Lord we have assembled Lord those that heard this word and something stirred and changed in their lives something the desire for the world is completely left and they'll may be tempted here there every once in a while or or however you know how the man the East person battles the Lord but Lord Jesus Lord we are here assembled uh for the post of Duty Lord not of law but of Love Lord we we know you called us to assemble together Lord and we love to come together Lord to hear your word Lord to be uh in your presence Lord God and to believe all things Lord bless the people bless the Saints Lord and Lord we ask a special anointing a blessing upon brother Jesse Pastor Jesse York as he is doing a great work here Lord though look may he look humble Lord the outcome will have a Bountiful Harvest Lord those some might think were outcasts Lord or some might not think as a high-class people yet Lord God your seed is everywhere Lord maybe be conscious of that oh God we love you so much Lord protective God as he even drives back Lord bless his Services Lord bless those baptisms in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you have your seats there we're all excited about that I can't wait to hear what happens there and brother Jesse had asked me a couple weeks ago to go down it was like 10 o'clock on a Saturday night and I'm like huh you have to drive two hours here and then another two two and a half down south to pick a family up and I was like whoa that's in the first one of the first times I said no and I said that's a little late even for me now if I would have had like something pierce my my mind and run into my heart and say well we'll get it then we'll get it right because that's what we do right sure um so we thank the Lord for all things and I think about uh who you are and how what God has declared you to be he's declared you to what to be the Kings and Priests what of this world and I just have a real simple uh study this morning just a real thought but I want it to be an encouragement because I see battles raging at the home Church so much going on up here in individuals and people so many thoughts so many uh polls from this person that person or from the world or however just seeing things and and things people are going through and just hearing through the grapevine and we there's so much to pray for and there's so much to believe for for others to receive what they need of God it's a burden you know and just like uh I sometimes every once while I get a little down and I say Lord I don't know what to do for these do for people you know all you can do is pray ER remember the prophet of God he would say he said if I could heal you I would if I if I could encourage you and and uplift up lip uplift or heal that broken Spirit he says I would but in those sort of things we've got to intercede from one another and and really pull on God and try and get in his presence and ask the blessing for the other person you know to lift them up and make them the the higher calls than yourself and to really you know be a a a a a a an animal of self-sacrifice you know because Christ who who is our example Jesus Christ right did he seek his own did he seek his own good and this and that and however no he was all about his children or his people right he he literally he literally laid down his life and gave it and shed his blood for us I mean what more what what more can we ask for he's given us that's why that's why he had to close that book of Revelation said you can't enter take away because what it's already been done everything everything we need has been given to us so you know he's been so good and so kind uh so now here we'll start we'll just end here in verse 26 and we'll move 28. he says and so all Israel he says shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion or Zion to deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob this for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes you look at some of the famous Jews like in America what's that famous intellectual they have now uh Ben Shapiro Jewish super super intellectual just an absolute just talking just rattle machine gun fire drop anyone that's contrary to logic but when you see him taking everyone about Jesus Christ he's like no he was just a man you know he's just you know this and this why because they've been that that seed that that line there was blinded in that natural Branch was broken off and cast what so that we then could be grafted in we are blessed and he did it on purpose see the election of God he would he for some he would let absolutely not allow to see these things and then others must see these things this was given to them specifically to understand and to see amen now as concerning the gospel they were enemies for your sakes but it's touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes and I did another study a continuation of what I taught here last time at home and you better bless those Jews God God uses the Gentiles for the Jews amen notice it says he says and out of Zion to deliver in other words who Zion the bride out of the Bride will come come what the deliverer Christ is going to rise and I was like this when when the bride then brings forth Christ once again the way it's supposed to be in the book of Acts but Graham said he said well he says that same gospel that was that we received here will be preached to them and bring them into the Covenant as well and the Bible says in one day 144 000 will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same thing we've received the same promises we have they are going to receive them back amen why but we have to wait to the Gentiles days are over and that's what we're we're seeing the culmination that right now this thing's breaking forth very very rapidly now this morning nothing deep but I want to just I want to this was kind of on my heart here did I just jump out of this okay no so I didn't okay uh so this has been on my heart here and I want to um just something last night just I just want to I hope this is a blessing so we want to teach on an individual revelation an individual revelation now notice here in second Corinthians 3. and this is a very serious uh I mean I guess it's simple but it's a very serious this is coming down to it right here this is literally this this distinguishes this this shows who's going to make Rapture and who's not okay because God always deals with the Jews different than with the Gentiles now notice here in second Corinthians 3 11 he says for that which is done away with was for that which is done away with was glorious now they're talking about the Old Testament the old ways the laws and the those sort of things he says much more that which remaineth is glorious so in other words what what God has magnified in the law that's even more glorious right because now he said he said he said we're going to do away with this legalist and this thing and that law and this uh thing here and this here but he said but these Ten Commandments were continuing on and we're going to make it even harder to make it so he says seeing then that we have such a hope we use great plainness of speech a great plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face so Paul reading the Old Testament sees when Moses come down from receiving those in the Bible said his face shown it glowed and he had actually it was so it Shine so bright they had to put a veil over and Paul's reading this and the Holy Ghost quickens to him what that meant he says he says that the children could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished he says but their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth that same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament see we have so many scriptures what thousands of scriptures uh I had young banaya wanted to teach a Bible study a couple months about a month ago and I and I had to I actually had to come here and teach and uh I said banaya what are you teaching on he says I'm teaching on the Prophecies of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament I said oh that sounds very good why because there's hundreds and hundreds of them and Christ his testimony was what that he would fulfill each one of them he said look and the Bible talks about how his bones are out of joint and he'd look down at his chest he could see his ribs and he said to my bones stare at me and he gave his back to the smiders and they ripped out his beard and all those things exactly he fulfilled it to the T amen and he did it what for you and I that what we could receive salvation because without that human sacrifice without Christ giving his own life what we would still be what dead in our sins absolutely because the Bible says in First Corinthians 15 he says if you're baptized unto the dead he says he says we're still yet in our sins right but he didn't just die but he was raised again what showing what that the same life that was in him and if it being you it'll Quicken that same mortal body amen sure he says For unto this day remaineth that same Veil taken away in the reading of the Old Testament which was veils done away in Christ even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart they literally they can't see it see this is a spiritual thing you know what if you take a an Old Testament or a Jew right now with a with a it's like this someone who believes this word and you asked him two plus two you guys are going to have the exact same answer and you can run through algebra with a Jew you can go run through algebra through you guys and you guys can come up with the same answers you can ask them scientific questions one after the other and what you guys are gonna have the same answers you're going to say uh uh uh like brother malkai is a he was at one time I don't know if you still are a big history buff or whatever in World War II and he sent me a couple of those pictures of planes and tanks and all those sort of things and uh give them to me and they're not so you can actually ask them old uh World War One World War II history of this and this and give them the Jewish angle and the the American angle this this and they'll come up with the exact same stories right because what is history because in other words their minds operate the exact same way we all can think we can all we're ease and we call someone memorize and think those sort of things but when it comes down to spiritual revelation this is something that's beyond the natural it's something higher it's something greater what God has there literally God has given you the ability to spiritually hear and to spiritually see these things just we can't take this for granted we have to be thankful for Jesus Christ to Jesus Christ what the God gave us this ability amen sure he says nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now notice once God comes and what turns them God is going to take all that darkness and they're going to read the Old Testament in a new light in the in the and for for us who is in this message the Bible is going to be a new book to them and they're going to receive the Holy Ghost in one day but if you look at Israel in the scripture God says so many wonderful things about them now notice here in in Deuteronomy 32 and verse 8 he says when the most high divided to the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam now notice there are sons of Adam there is a seed line he says he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel for the Lord's portion is his people he says Jacob is the lot of his inheritance notice he says he says these are my inheritance what does he point to are those natural Jews absolutely those were the inheritance absolutely but he's looking forward Christ is always looking forward to what the end of the entire work the entire I say like this we just had a brother in our assembly and and he's married to a wonderful sister and she has a mother and they went through years now going to Chicago and back witnessing to their mother Chicago and back and this and that and then finally the mother in Chicago agreed to move back with them and she moved in and the brothers had to come in and unload a ton of her stuff and trailers and semi trucks and all those things bring it into the house and then they get all sorted assists and the brothers looks so tired and guess what yesterday that woman was your 80s 80s got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in Ottawa Ohio and I looked at that brother and I said brother all those travels all those laboring witnessing to your mother-in-law paid off today and I went to the Mother-in-law sister and I said sister this is literally one of the few things God actually asks us to do in the physical is get baptized you can't call yourself you can't justify yourself you can't sanctify yourself you can't fill yourself with the Holy Ghost but he asked you to do one thing he says get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen and now she's done it and now what there's a promise that that is hovering over her she'd come up out of the water just crying and it's a beautiful thing but all all that was for this one moment right there and Christ when he started this great story this great I'll say this this great mystery from the beginning and just creation this and creation and doing this in the 50s and fourth days and third days and all those stories the whole thing he's looking forward he was looking to the end he was looking at what he was going to produce at the end and who is he trying to produce himself in you and through you and that you would be what led by he himself and doing the exact same signs wonders and miracles amen so about notice here in verse 10 and he found him in the desert land and in the weight howling the waste howling Wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye and yet he called he called these Jews what the apple of his and yet what he let many Fall by the wayside he let many of this and many of this he sent him into captivity time and time and time again but what God loved him but what he was looking at them and seeing it was in them all the way at the End Amen sure he says and as the ego stirs up her nest flutters over her young spread of the brought her wings taketh them and bear them upon her wings so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him look he did all that for them when they came out of Egypt there was literally only two real Believers that came out of Egypt and he did it all for them and the seed that would come out of the fathers that failed in the wilderness that's what the prophet God said he said he said this is just like it's just like a plant there's the seed and then out of the seed comes the the the the stem and the and then and then the tassels and then the the shock and then this and then the seed itself is in that Shug a lot of people are just carriers of the life of God and there is a generation that's going to and I believe we're in this generation that's going to Manifest this thing the way it was meant to be manifested amen now let's continue on here so he calls them the apple of his eye notice also what the Lord calls them in verse 22 he says and thou shall say unto Pharaoh he says thus say the Lord Israel is my son even my firstborn look at God he see God he picked and chose this people and the Bible says not because they were biggest or not because they were strong as me what because what God loved them amen in the Bible the reason why he loved Israel so much is because he picked Abraham he picked Jacob he picked Isaac and those and he loved those three fathers so much a lot of times he said he says I remember he says and Moses would cry out and say he said Lord don't don't slay these and don't say that he said remember that you're the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and sometimes the Bible would say he says he's the he's you're the god of Abraham Isaac and Israel amen and that's a there's a major uh uh some Revelations there by God's grace when he switches that name change and really pulls on the heartstrings of the Lord amen sure he says say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me he says if thou refused to let him go behold I will slay thy son even thy first born see so because Christ they came out of Christ and he called them his firstborn I said what a nation an actual like church first born Church nation and here now he calls it the firstborn he says if you don't let this church my firstborn my son go he says I'll slay your firstborn and he did right absolutely so now so if you see this here whenever God deals with Israel's within it's an it's the whole thing it's a nation they were a nation Church a nation people when one person failed just like we've seen the promised land uh Aiken rose up and this and this he stole this and hid that and did that or whatever and the entire nation suffered because of that right absolutely so now uh here's here's another uh thing right here we see this take place in second Samuel 21 verse 1 then there was a famine in the days of David three years year after year so David comes into power and all of a sudden he comes into power and a famine strikes Israel why did this famine happen we see right there and David inquired of the Lord the Lord said answer it he says it is for Saul and for his bloody house because he slew the Gibby Knights so one man did one wrong thing one king did one wrong thing and the entire nation had three years of famine that's enough to wipe them out and David he finally got so desperate after three years like Lord what have I done what have I done what's going on what's going on he finally entered in and God answered and said it's because of what Saul did the Forerunner remember he was a type of what denominational Prophet God said that he was he we had the easy ecclesiastical swords and ecclesiastical jackets and vests and armor and mail and all those things for what ecclesiastical battles but now notice here wherefore Davidson to the giving us what shall I do for you and where was shall I make the atonement they may be that he may bless the inheritance of the Lord and to give you I said unto him we will have we will have no silver nor gold of Saul nor of his house neither to us they shall Thou shalt neither for us shalt thou kill any in Israel and he said what shall I say what shall I do for you and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised us against us that we should be destroyed from a remaining in any of the coast of Israel that seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up before the Lord and give you of Saul whom the Lord would choose and the King said I will give them anytime you see that number seven that represents the church ages seven is always them Church ages but now remember be because of these famine because of this famine what what they have to do they had to offer up these men which is a type one a denominational offshoots this is what this is the because in every Church age what was the problem organization my pastor just listened to another sermon and he said he said he goes everything this entire Pro the entire problem with why the book of Acts fell had to do with organization the reason the book of Acts could never spring forward once again was because of organizational Spirit men coming up what and taking that spirit and it and then the Bible says well not the problem but the prophet God said God says what he says he says what is it he says it's divine leadership plus human and that's where I would get in trouble that's where all of us would get in trouble if we take Lord what is your wallet what is your will what is your will and then we come a thought comes and we don't know if it's God or if we think it's our own or however but if it's our own we cannot add it into whatever the answer would be we're preying on or asking for a leadership right amen he says so let the seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up into the Lord in gibeas in other words we have to do away with all organizational ideas anything organizational and I'll say it like this any dogmas that have come up in the message I'll say now I'll just make I'll just mention one here I've been studying out a couple things our past has been hitting back home and wow I was originally taught that the the Rapture was a process and I said hmm and then so we did some study on that some research and we found out exactly where that Doctrine came from is the rapture a process the Bible says when the Lord descends he shall send what a shout voice and Trump and if you look at the Shadow and type or the first one It All Happened very very very quickly so we're kind of leaning against that now that not the Rapture is not a process because once you receive the Holy Ghost you've made the rapture there is a time a point in time where Jesus Will descend and all these things will take place and then the Rapture that in Christ will rise first and they which were alive and remain shall be caught up with him in the clouds forever amen that's what we're looking for amen sure now let's continue on here by God's grace now notice and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hang them in the hill before the law seven together notice in one day and we're put to death in the days of the Harvest in the first days in the beginning of the barley Harvest so notice all seven of them were identified this one this one this one this one this one this one and they were all taken down in one day in the days of the Harvest what Harvest was it according to commentators he says they were put to death in days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of the barley Harvest which began at Passover what so that Death Angel couldn't touch him anymore that angel or that Spirit one that would bring forth the famine the land or however or try to steal from the people what it would be atone for amen and what that that would literally show that everything has been made right amen when Christ came he would they were Moses was bringing judgment plague plague plague plague and the final one that would strike that nation was death sure but when that took place if we had to have the the the uh the blood applied we had to have that hyssop use the hyssop to apply the blood and if we had that we would be saved sure amen so uh we're seeing those things now and I wanted to to kind of just uh teach on these individuals here because if you look at this Revelations two and four he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee against thee because thou has left thy First Love remember for therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except our print but this thou Hast that thou hatest the deeds and neglatans which I also hate so what was the entire the seals were revealed in 63. revealed right what were the Seals All About they were about the Antichrist spirit and what did the what was the first thing the devil went after he went after the laity because Nicholas wanted to conquer the laity the body of Christ that's been the whole battle that's organization when the when the when the body of Christ or the laity is put under the thumb of a headship it shuts it down but we've got to come up out of that no I don't think brother Jesse is definitely not Nickelodeon there's no doubt about it he's not where does he want to now he's supposed to watch over the house of God and make sure everything's in order and those sort of things but the whole point of this thing is to bring us into Liberty you have to come into Liberty the pastor the the Evangelist the however the five-fold still operating they're trying to do their best but we're sowing they want to we went to sow the seeds of bringing the individual laity into power literally recognizing who she is and what to do with what she's been giving that's what was stolen from the beginning and then that must be restored now notice he says it's not I'm not one of those Believers in the nicolaitan taking all conquered ladies putting it all on the pastor putting it all on the how much how much work does brother Jesse do here [Music] teacher in a Bible study should I go down on the road and just let it back me up back me up what else does he do whether he does it all right it's not all on this must not all be on brother Jesse and that calls for what the other men of the church to rise up and take positions if they see their past or needing rest here or they're passed to this or Pastor that saints of God do not be scared to offer your services why because God placed you in a position what are the gifts in your life your brothers sisters as well what are the gifts you're like what can you do to make this congregation better what can you do to usher in the Holy Ghost more don't limit yourself all of you do not limit what God can do with you he says he says is the the Holy Ghost doesn't doesn't just doesn't baptize the pastor it baptizes the Leia to laity too it's all in the laity and the pastor is just one of us see see the we've got to get out of the mind oh he's the pastor he's the bishop this and the saints of God we are a unit we are a living breathing Stones what of the temple of God and each one of you has to come to their maturity right me as well I'm striving I'm like Lord how do I get there I don't know but he said he would do it look at Peter James and John they're fishermen just common everyday guys to go out in the boat smell like fish constantly washing our hands in seawater touching dead guts of fish all day long mending Nets doing those sort of things and one day they're out there mending Nets or whatever they're by the seashore and a man says come follow me and they're like [Laughter] Jesus said come follow me how many other how many other fishermen were there that day how many well their dad was there I'm sure Zebedee right and though he heard it did he come fishing did he come with Jesus no those that were ordained to hear they said come follow me and those went and left their jaws went and what followed the Lord Jesus Christ common everyday ordinary individuals when Jesus came and said come follow me to the entire nation of Israel follow Jesus but at that point he says I was looking for the Lost sheep he didn't say goats he said sheep of Israel and did Jesus accomplish what he said he was going to do or not he came and did exactly what he said he was going to do and there's still more sheep to be found what he sent those sheep that he didn't catch strength and then God strengthened them encouraged them fill them with the same Spirit he had and set them off to catch more more Sheep amen yes he says means Shepherd Pastor which means the feet of like the holy spirit gives overseer to watch it and to control it absolutely but what about you you're the individuals he says now we know that God that God was always wasn't always been against organized religion yes sir he said it Nickelodeon is what I hate Nicola means to conquer the lady laity is the laity is the church the body who's the body of Christ you are I have been now speaking here for a little bit to the body of this assembly he says the body Nico Nico nickeo means to conquer overcome in the words to make to make a holy man somebody above the other so let's say brother Jesse invites someone who's somewhere felt well well known and everybody's like you know how it is and there are some that have very tremendous Ministries very gifted and eloquent and bringing these things have power all those things anointed and all those sort of things but remember that's not them you're seeing a gift not the person you're seeing a gift the anointing is that the person no that's the Holy Ghost on them so you can have a wonderful service the Holy Ghost can come down but remember you're just as equal as he is in the sight of God because remember that gift is a gift for who the laity the body of Christ you that's for you that's your chef serving up the meal right he says we're all children we got one king that's God we all got one Holy One he says and that's God Amen he is in the midst of us he says in the form of the Holy Ghost he said that's the Holy One that's why we don't call them beyond what they what they are we just call everybody brother here we go we give double you call them Pastor Jesse or brother Jesse but you know just give them a little extra iron give them that that title name because he's a pastor it's a high calling it's a high standard and someone's maybe called to be a pastor they have to walk on eggshells before the people sister Lydia brother milk I had to probably raise pretty strictly Keisha raised pretty strictly Haven see there's people there should be raised pretty strictly it's cares Toba raised strictly right absolutely why because the pastor must have his children in or must it's not that's not an option it's a requirement amen now he said that's what started the chaos for the first time the chaos he says at the 90 Council they wanted the doctor the neglators mean to conquer the lady takeaways and lazy and make a holy man he said that's not a holy man holy Hill it's the holy God a holy God amongst the people the laity has part of it we've got to come up higher I've got to come up higher I am being honest I want to speak in tongues I want to interpret I want to warn of there's if there's a danger up ahead anybody know the future no but the Holy Spirit knows the future it's the spirit of Prophecy right and if someone can get into the anointing and worship God and that gift of speaking or interpretation in tongues lay in you God can use you to warn of impending Danger in the book of Acts didn't didn't one of the prophets say he says there's a famine coming and the Bible says it was fulfilled in such and such days and they were given ample time to prepare for the famine other things they may have perished did not Jesus himself the spirit of Prophecy in him say what he says he says when you see this city surrounded do not go back to your house is so he said he says when you see this when you see Titus or Nero whoever was surrounding he says don't go back just flee the hills and stay away and it saved those Jews that heard that prophecy that God opened their eyes and ears to hear and see save them see the Holy Spirit was our keeper we need him more than we even know even comprehend he says remember he says there the laity is part of it we are children there's no great ones Among Us how can you have faith when you desire respects one from another we're all one in Christ you are all one in Christ amen to me this is we can let's see when we call each other or fellowship or another we should be so excited because brother what is God doing in your life or sister what is the Lord working what have you what has God manifested listen this and what's going on over here and why because we are the body of Christ we should all be operating letting the Holy Spirit work through us continually and the Bible said Mark 16 was what he says these signs shall follow them that believe well verse I am just a sister I'm just a young man or however no no you all have this potential everyone here can raise the dead and heal the sick and those sort of things it can all be done by the yielding to the spirit of God absolutely I've seen it I'm a most of the times I've seen a healing take place where I've actually laid my hands on them haven't he been at the church it's been out in the job force or this person or that person or however why because I'm most people aren't sick when I come to teach or however they've already been healed but what making yourself available out in the world Jesus said I send them out to the world what as sheep uh you know Among Wolves right you're to operate out there what to do to to display the power of Christ that's manifestation absolutely now he says we're all one in Christ Jesus there's no big men and no littlemen we're all the same we're children of one father and his children see bro equal brother you have the exact same potential as anyone in this entire world sister as well well brother Graham had Signs Now brother Graham was the seventh star in the hand of God okay that was that was a once in 2000 Gentile lifetime or whatever you want to say that we actually saw a real Prophet given to us he's the only one that's going to be right there's no other stars that's the last one but there are gifts nine spiritual gifts healings miracles wisdom knowledge those sort of things that is in the laity that's in the bride to operate in the time of deception in the time of deception wouldn't you want ourselves in operation so that whoever walks through here will be called out from sin like right now what if I'd done something completely evil and I walked through here and and sister Naomi raised up thus said Lord Brother Simon you better repent I will drop to my knees run to the altar here Pastor Jesse please pray for me saying to God Brothers keep pray for me then you know this place is clean that'll spread really fast at the power of God is working among you but aside that's going to take labor and that's going to take yeah absolutely it's going to take a heart and a hunger for God that you want God in the midst in such a way amen yeah I mean that's that's what we're straving for right that's this is the whole point to reproduce to what the restoration of the book of Acts amen let's continue on here now now notice what the prophet God says he says there's no great ones he says how can you have faith when you desire respects one from another he says my brother and have not faith in the Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect of persons Pastor Jesse's just drove down picked up like a family of Amish or come on Amish and this and this he drove down he said there's people with a lot of problems and see people the way they dress is a little bit more old school than our holy sister is here right and brothers say oh they're just this blah blah blah but notice brother Jesse with the heart of to save Souls the Bible says he that is wise when his Souls now he's been what called to baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ why because he sees every soul as ten thousand worlds that's what we're called to do is to get to find our seed Lord God direct our past to find the lost sheep of the House of Gentiles of God's Gentiles absolutely this dissensations thanks to God one of these days we got to get the rest of them and then we go there's got to be some out there and we got to go how's this rash going to take place unless God Saves all of them amen make yourself available help us Lord Jesus now let's continue on here he says for there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there'll also come a poor man and vile Raymond and ye have respect to him that wears the gay clothing or the the fancy clothing clothing he says and saying to him here sit down here in a good place and say to the poor stand out here or stand upon my footstool see putting plate by notice they're looking on on the outward completely carnal completely carnal looking at the appearance of what the person could afford or what the person could or how even dressed he says are you then not partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts the Holy Ghost said that was evil now here's the dangerous part in America because there's so many people on the on the the Homeless Action now and you drive past from this this and you're thinking is this a real or is this they choose to be this way now it's become a battle because there's so much opportunity out there I mean they could go get a job here this and this and this is the one to get to that point it's hard to climb back up but it can be done hearken he's with my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith he says in Heirs of the Kingdom which he hath not he hath promised to them that love him amen so God sees the poor and says that's my people I was out with apprentice and my Apprentice he's the first year and he's like one day he's like sorry can we go get some breakfast sandwiches I was like okay let's go so I cleaned out my front seat because it's always dirty and he jumped in and we drove downtown Toledo to this my favorite little breakfast sandwich place we got our breakfast sandwiches and we're eating them in the truck and blah blah and boom a guy walks up says hey can you spare like uh and he had his gas can he's like I need gas I'm like okay he goes I'm living my car but it's so cold I can't run my my truck because I don't have any gas she stayed warm at night and I was like okay and my parents okay let me goes I'll be all right you know what we did I gave him 20 bucks and I said I'm going to fill your gas can up went and got the gas drove it back to me where he was at delivered it and you know what really moved me because when he came up to me he was about my dad's age and he had my exact name my dad's eyes and when I saw him I saw my father you know my dad asked me one time your grandpa asked me he said he said Simon go just take me to the Cherry Street Mission in Toledo and I go I am not as your son going to take you to a Cherry Street Mission he wanted to be homeless I said Dad those guys will eat you alive you don't even know what you're asking well he just just did not have the wisdom to understand what because once cold out you don't stay in there they kick you out for the day and you got to walk around because I see him downtown Toledo you gotta walk around I said my father is not and I told my parents I see the reason he's in his car and not with his son is because I'm not his dad and you're not his you know staying with your mom and dad for so long see when you see the poor you don't know what they've been through and the prophet God said Jesus from that he presents from from that time some people take shots and they just never recover they take they go through such battles and they're built maybe a little weaker than you are in the mind or don't have that drive and don't have that fight in them some don't have that you better thank God for what you have amen praise God if you're so standing if you can still go to work and this and this and you you go through your mind battles or your things at home and you still push on praise God because there's a lot of people who can't do that and God has allowed that for what what did the Bible tell us he says what he said he says you strong he says strength in the weak all those that don't have strength to even don't even have the motivation to do something and count themselves as nothing praise God we've got a lot to do a lot of work to do Saints but the Lord knows how to get it done just in time he says uh but you have despised the poor do not Richmond oppress you and draw you before the Judgment seats do not they blaspheme the word the name by which you are called he says if you fulfill the Royal law written in the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself what he says ye do well amen got to get our eyes off this guy well I've wanted that saints of God looked so many people need love so many people just need a friend and that can lead right into salvation if they see something real a real loving kind gentle honest Pure Heart and they're ordained you're going to win them now look at this we're dealing with individuals and Peter said repent me baptize everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children to all that are to all that are far off even as many as the Lord God shall call amen that's individuals he didn't say full groups full churches he just said he says two those that God would call individuals amen now notice here you know why it's so hard for us to push through those things and I'm just speaking to myself too is because you look at someone more gifted than yourself I can get up here and say man I need to sing a song I look at brother amen I'm like if only I could play those strings if only had the ranger voice yeah I could be better for Christ I'm supposed to do what I'm supposed to Rejoice we have someone who can play and sing we've got someone who can praise God and look at you can you can hear it when he sings that he's a worshiping God he's not putting an entertainment or a show on for you he's worshiping the Lord's savior amen he's the worshiping the great Creator amen that made that voice that made that hard to receive him sure you know why because we're all built different for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me oh I says in my mother's womb we all came from there I will praise thee for him fearfully and wonderfully made each one of you is wonderfully made well I wish I was like no no no you are specific built you didn't come out of no shop out of China where everything's the same or Taiwan or wherever you come from Heaven down here there's twins but up there I don't think there is amen everyone's individual he's a gardener he had a garden in the beginning Adam why because God is distinct he likes variety he says marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not a hit for me when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth yet my Thine Eyes didn't see my substance yet being unperfect he knew what you were going to be and yet he still chose you to come on this side hallelujah amen you mean all the sin all the iniquity I'll say this same to God for the most part the message uh most message people don't really sin their sin is Iniquity their problem is Iniquity knowing how much do you understand what when I was a denomination I first got saved and this is like oh man I'm saved this is but I didn't even I didn't even know I was sinning half the time because I didn't know I didn't know sisters were supposed to wear skirts and dresses I didn't know I couldn't go to Sunday second service with my umbros on and this tank top and a white beater they'll assembly God come on my brother-in-law Dustin before he's married to your mom he walked up he showed up one day with a super super tight shirt and I go uh I go Dustin what what size is that shirt and I go D size and what then they got me into it and I'm starting wearing tight shirts to church and this and this and you know I wasn't billed at all but we just wore tight shirts he got me into it I mean I just started wearing them they called d-sides right I didn't know you weren't supposed to display your flesh even though it's really not that attractive but that's not what that now that's not really iniquity because I didn't know any better that's just flat out ignorance oh my it's embarrassing yeah I look back and I'm like he saw this and being unperfect yet he still decided yet let's make him yeah that bring him forth what Jesus say he said my blood is strong enough my spirit is more than able to change that guy he's more than able to change you and to keep you changed and bring you what higher in him amen yes that's the truth oh man what were you where did he where would you be without this where would you be without the revelation of Jesus Christ in this day Omaha bar joints may be dead when in jail who knows where filthy we'd be 10 million tires still there without Our Hope without a prayer oh my God praise God yes I'm not where I want to be but thank God I know we're not used to be and we're not there anymore we're just we're moving forward amen he says yeah being perfect and in thy book all my members were written small feet small hands tall legs those short mamas High voices low low voices eyes this way eyes that way brother Jose with the Mexican Moses beard everything was written you are unique scientific just think about it you know your pastor has a memory like a steel trap right and he can go sister God did this read this God did this for you God did this for you sister God did this for you this brother he he can run down and what every one of those every one of you has testimonies in this assembly I've seen one back there on a photograph wait brother [Laughter] each one of you has testimonies was what strengthens and encourages the people well we're just a small assembly big numbers doesn't mean blessings big numbers doesn't mean God's with neither the small numbers remember it's individuals all all David knew is what how precious he says are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them to look past all this yeah absolutely every mistake every failure fault I just failed my wife about six months ago I I got scammed on something and I had to go home and confess and this and this and I'm like it's too much of a giver right we just failed now notice and God the great Creator who has expressed itself through all his creation we are part of his creation just as those flowers are just as the trees all other nature we are part of this creation think about it all creation are you not his creation absolutely how many stars are like zero how many snowflakes since the beginning of time are like zero how many Blades of grass are exactly perfectly the same zero how many trees zero how many people are exactly the same but you're all individually wonderfully made special well brother Psy how come how come this happened this happened we're going to get to that we're going to get to this now now God is a god of variety he doesn't have anything just the same he just doesn't have all mountains he has deserts planes grassy Fields yellow flowers white blue pink different colors he has a large man small men and dark-headed brown-headed redheaded he's a god of variety for everything is to serve his purpose you have a purpose each one of you has a potential some 30. 60 100 fold reach your potential reach your potential Lord what am I to do what gifts do I have Lane what did you place inside of me bring this out he's the god of writing for everything to serve his purpose he's got everything to serve his purpose purpose and everything that does serve as purpose correctly there is a resurrection to it [Laughter] fine why what did Enoch do the Bible said Enoch please God he obeyed God in all things and it pleased him so much that he made the Rapture without the Holy Ghost pleasing the Lord I know now I know we're at one hour right now got a little longer okay now now notice this Christina 16 7. and the Lord said to Samuel look not upon his countenance nor the height of a statue because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man see you for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart sister could you maybe come back a little bit taller next time and could you like put a little more muscle tone on those arms is that going to please the Lord but if this sister goes home seeks God in such a way and if there's anything in her heart got a funny feeling against brother Malachi well milk I grew taller than me why did he do that I think he's got something on me he's got something against me for sure or if she's jealous of his height like I might have been ah what hey you've got to have you got a clean heart see all we have to do is keep our heart clean it doesn't matter how you look how is your heart condition that's what he's looking at he's looking right in here is there evil continually is is deep down your desire to serve the Lord 100 absolutely now are there still evil thoughts absolutely but here's your desire say Lord I'll be honest like me I always say Lord you know when somebody's body is going to be I'm gonna be perfectly serving you when I have one evil thought and the rest of my eternity so Lord that thing I just did or I said or I acted in the wrong kind of way I don't like it I want to be freed from this because it's so much better to be happy and to be joyful in the Lord than to be you say you win a thousand dollar ten thousand million dollars there's no there's no lasting joy in that I'll say like this last time I was hearing about Justin you guys were singing better as one house one betters one day in his uh course than a thousand elsewhere man I felt that song I felt that song and I come out here and I said that's how that's how I feel so to be right here I am so you hate to to give the example of like lot the Bible says a lot his his righteous Soul was vexed from day to day seeing the wickedness because we don't get to live like Abraham Abraham was out in out there by himself he lived by himself with his servants and everything was he was in charge of everything you don't don't use that you do this you do it right we have to go out in the world and I've got to hear country music blurry 24 7 of the job site and it's absolutely wretched with their singing it's horrible then you got to hear This Man costume this man costume this so tall dirty this and dirty that and that's like oh you can't even Escape it and you come here and you're just like however he's like praise the Lord we love you Lord Jesus praise God and everybody's happy no negativity man I'm like you hardly you know you invite people to church they don't come but if they get negative on jobs like guess what I'm like hey it's gonna be the right day man let's let's smile let's just be happy and just you don't want to worship God guess what I'm just going to have him get them excited to be happy you know I don't know I just don't like being negative I don't like that down timing I like depression I don't like any of that stuff he says but the Lord look at upon the heart now notice what it says here in second chronicles 28 9 he says and thou Solomon's son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind individuals individuals you clean keep your heart clean not a root of bitterness one thing or this person or my wife or my husband or my brother or my sister or my friend or my pastor or my Deacon or this no nothing you know who you know who's one of the best Brothers I've ever seen like in taking something like that his brother Matt Leitner for the Matt leitler can can like someone can like jump in front of a line at like a buffet you know like must be hunger than me I've seen him do I've seen he takes everything straight he's just like well this guy did this to me he's like must have been the Lord's will okay he like takes it just like just keeps on going and you can literally see he he takes no offense to it just like this is my predestinated walk as David men spitting on David and trying to kill him this this and they was just like well I'm just gonna try and survive that's all I'm gonna do I'm not gonna say anything bad about the person just kind of Dodge arrows and Spears and all kinds of things and hide out in caves and this snat and however and whatever foreign God told him to do it hey man that's right now he says for the Lord shall judge the people judge me O Lord according to my righteousness and according to my Integrity that is in me oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to to an end but establish the judge the justice for the righteous God strieth the hearts and Reigns he's gonna try you oh brother I'm clean I've got nothing around somebody then the Lord lets this person that really rubbed you wrong about three years ago come back and say he's gonna try you and when you fail guess what you got to go through the test again and maybe even harder until you overcome that now notice neither is there any creature that is not manifesting his sight but all things are naked and open under the eyes of him and whom we have to do if the Lord Jesus Christ which he is right here but if he was in flesh and you got to see him in his Corporal body and he walked up to you it didn't matter if you did your hair nice or if you didn't do your hair nice he would be able to see your heart right now and know what you are all about remember Christ went to the cream of the uh the Pharisee crop went to the fair to the sadducee to the best guys their they sent their guys out and when these righteous men showed up Jesus looked at him and said you're a serpent I said Who who how do you know that he's a trust me absolutely why because he could see right into their heart and discern it what was in their heart what was it all about now I don't wanna now let's continue on here he says he says now look at the ill-fame woman she recognized that she wasn't in document made it he says the lamp on she was morally wrong of course no one would re endorse that the laws of God condemned that but she was morally wrong see God don't judge you upon what you are he's dealing with the woman with well he judges not how big or how little you are he judged your heart what you want to be everybody want to be a Christian everybody want to hear want to be the bride of Christ everybody want here want to lay their lives down and yield to the spirits to what he can work through you has he worked through you already absolutely we've all got testimonies and those sorts of things now see God judges the heart man judges the outward appearance now look how God judges right here this is a I've seen this coil like oh it's beautiful like the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the Pharisee with a pure body and a defiled heart you see how you see how deceptive this can be there can be absolutely someone who's a prostitute who is completely defiled and everybody in town knows it and God says it's mine I was like a perverted Minister well what no then Christ could come up to the highest minister in the message or highest this and denomination say you're nothing but this or that you need to clean up repent because remember God knows the heart and if you keep your heart clean things of God the reward is what Thou Art well done amen now let's continue on here it condemned one and saves the other why outward appearance praise God now it's getting late let's just let's just uh let's just stand here by God's grace David says create and me a clean heart oh God I renew a right Spirit Within Me sure he says who can say I made made my heart clean I am pure for sin not a one that takes the work of the god right and look at this don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into what was the message coming to Christ receive the token receive the Holy Ghost you say well I believe every word said brother Graham that's good but that just makes you able to read see we can't stop at this no you've heard it and believe it we've got to receive it and manifest it take the message in your heart that you may have a token the very Life of Christ that was in Christ be in you now I want to read this real quick we're not going to okay let's just let's just jump to what I want to read remember do you guys remember Ernest Sandler's letter let me get ready here one time but I want to you to listen to this I'm going to have you read this as we okay and remember well you well we're not the biggest church and our pastor is not famous or or this or that or I'm not a big of this Robert let me tell you something this I don't know the reason why brother Branham gave this letter to Ernest Handler I don't know why but one thing we're certain he gave it to him now I've looked once I copied and pasted this into my own thing the they took this off the website for whatever reason but I still got it so let's read this together individually as individuals how special are you let's just let's look read this the High Calling of God it's called given by Brother Branham to Ernest fanler from brother Robert Goff brother Ram told Ernest fans to write a book of his life story which you can read below this exhortation so here's the letter right here if God has called you to really like to be really like Jesus in all your spirit He will draw you into life of crucifixion and humility my mom doesn't accept me my dad doesn't accept me for what I believe this this this this he will put on put such demands of obedience that he will not allow you to follow other Christians and in many ways he will seem to let other good people do things which she he will not let you do I've experienced it spanked me heavy ties in it from them on high the old spiritual leather belt comes out and uh other Christians and ministers whom seem very religious and useful may push themselves pull wires and work schemes this happens to carry out their plans but you cannot do it if you attempt it you will meet with such failure and View From The Lord as to make you sorely penitent others can brag about themselves their work their success or their writings but the holy spirit will not allow you to do any such thing if you begin it he will lead you into such deep mortification that will make you despise yourself in all your good works if you've been called to be like Jesus my others will be allowed to succeed in making great sums of money or having a legacy left to them or in other having luxuries but God May Supply you daily because he wants you to have something far better than gold and that is a helpless dependence on him that he may have the privilege of providing your needs day by day out of the Unseen Treasury well hard sounds like you might be one of these guys well the boss only pays me so much and this and this and my bills are stretched from here to here and I'm I'm splitting pennies might be the bride of Christ the Lord may let others be honored and put forward but comes but keep you hidden away and obscurity because he wants to produce some choice fragrant fruit for his coming Glory which can only be produced in the shade hmm anybody can relate to this God will others be great but keep you small he will others do a work for him and get the credit for it but he will make you work and toil on without knowing how much you are doing then to make your toil still more precious he says precious he will let others get the credit for the work which you have done and this will make a reward ten times greater when Jesus comes let's see here I better not okay we're still on this letter the holy spirit will put you strict put your strict watch on you with jealous love and we rebuke you for little words and feelings or for wasting your time ma my goodness which other Christians never seem distressed over I still feel bad even right now about some things I said 20 15 years ago which is my foreman or my boss and I probably should make those things call them and they know nothing about it but I said it under my granddaughter not swear words just or something like that you know so make up your mind that God is an infinite Sovereign and has the right to do as he pleases with his own why am I like this well you must be the other earnest fanlers he will not explain to you a thousand things which may puzzle your reason in his dealings with you why this why did this happen to me why did that take place sister brother I still don't understand this part of my life not he might not answer you hope so God God will take you at your word if you will absolutely love will yourself to be his slave he will wrap you up in a jealous love and let other people say and do many things that you cannot do or say I'll say like this and the Lord open up deeds and neglatans to me and brother Kim I thought everyone's going to see this but I thought I thought the same thing when I saw baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I was like oh my whole entire youth group is coming into the message because they're going to see it guess what didn't even see it he says settle it forever that you are to deal directly with the Holy Spirit also that he is to have the privilege of tying your tongue or changing her hand or closing your eyes in ways that others are not dealt with he's trying to make you a love slave to him did not tape Paul say he goes I am a prisoner to Christ look what God did in his life as a prisoner to Christ because he was always in the will of God what building the kingdom in the father's business now when you are so possessed with the loving God that you are in your secret heart pleased and delighted over this particular in other words you're happy you get to the point where like Lord I I give up and you say and you take everything God allows you you're just waiting for uh uh this money or you're waiting for this or you're waiting for that you're just and then you find yourself happy to be in that position whoa that's a whole other level he says please and Delight over this particular private personal private jealous Guardianship and management of the Holy Spirit over your life you will have found the vestibule of okay this comes saying to God this thing comes to individuals not everyone in the churches are going to make it the Massachusetts is not going to make this rapture it's not gonna happen oh brother side there how many have fallen away in the last 20 years since I've been here thousands have fallen away is there more coming yeah because there's a great trap set count do discount yourself worthy that God has done what he has done in your life you may not be exactly pleased exactly but when you get there when you see that hey God is in full control of every FAFSA of my life everything has happened for a reason everything to the smallest minor thing this why did I uh night I walked out here with my collar up I'm thinking that was for a reason that just tells you I don't care really how I look right God loves each one of you individually and he's waiting each one of you are a special built uh seed person bride of Christ and each one will be equally loved by the Lord Jesus Christ on that side that's just the truth my musicians even come play here it's been an hour and 20 sorry we're just I skipped over quite a bit here but uh just kind of took my time here be the individual never try to fit in with the crowd be who God made you to be and love him for it absolutely right everyone is unique specially designed I'll say it like this you know you go to Home Depot and let's say your brother right here needs a drill they make 3 000 different kinds of drills one has bigger Motors some has bigger batteries some has bigger Chucks three eighths half inch Chuck then you got the impacts with quarter inch but guess what they all do the same thing and all them drills harnessed by a trained like a master Tradesman can all be used very specifically and precisely to accomplish most efficiently the job put before the man you're literally the tools of God who are the children of God and God wants to use you in a mighty mighty way well Versailles I'm just this run that seek the Lord seek his face is the time right now to seek his face all Hearts mind and clear I'm not trying to Rattle on here just uh and I think we got what Sunday school for the children next after this okay we're gonna try and dial with that we're gonna try that okay so if you need prayer you're more than welcome we'll pray over you we're believing the promises that were given to us by the shed blood of Jesus Christ and by the power of the Holy Ghost who are who is our enforcer and we have the right the privilege to call on him to accomplish anything we desire in the scriptural or scripturally so if you need prayer Let's uh let's just sing a couple songs here brother you got some in your heart let's sing a couple songs and we'll say a prayer then we'll be dismissed in the morning [Music] Jesus Jesus Christ [Music] I remember [Applause] every day again [Music] foreign amazing again [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign
