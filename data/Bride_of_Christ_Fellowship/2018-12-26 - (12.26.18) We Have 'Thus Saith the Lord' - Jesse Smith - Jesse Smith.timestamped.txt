[33:39] our Bibles this evening by the grace of
[33:41] Lord that's why we sing right for all
[33:45] that he's done for us praise God
[33:47] well I like to look at a little
[33:48] different thought here tonight I've been
[33:50] dealing with the book of Revelation and
[33:52] also numerology but I spent about three
[33:54] hours a day trying to get a sermon on
[33:56] numerology it just didn't come to me I
[33:58] was trying to get all the numbers in the
[34:00] Isaiah 53 and it was just a little bit
[34:03] too much I didn't have enough time I
[34:04] need a little more time so I want to go
[34:06] back to this message I've never preached
[34:09] it here but I preached it down in North
[34:10] Carolina last year I like to preach on
[34:12] we have the say at the Lord so let's go
[34:15] to James 5:10 James 5:10 so I want to
[34:25] basically preach all these thus saith
[34:28] the Lord's that brother Branham has
[34:29] given us to kind of help us remember the
[34:32] power of thus saith the Lord praise God
[34:35] and also all that we have and as you'll
[34:39] see what the Prophet said when we have
[34:41] thus saith the Lord
[34:42] it should take away all of our fears all
[34:44] of our all of our questions thus says
[34:47] the Lord should just clear everything up
[34:49] we should be able to stand on God's
[34:50] eternal Word amen we all need it by
[34:53] God's grace amen
[34:55] so so often we forget so james 5:10
[34:59] there was 3247 thus saith the lord that
[35:03] i went through on this study so quite a
[35:05] few and this was a wonderful study that
[35:08] the Lord gave me numerous years ago I
[35:09] don't think I've ever preached it here
[35:11] so I like to
[35:12] preach it by the grace of Lord tonight
[35:14] then Lord willing this weekend get back
[35:17] to numerology or the book of Revelation
[35:19] or where whatever God would have us to
[35:21] continue on by his grace James 5:10 if
[35:25] you're there say Amen now here's how you
[35:30] know a prophet a prophet will speak in
[35:32] the name of the Lord so let's read this
[35:35] together let's read verse 10 together on
[35:37] three one two three
[35:39] take my brethren the prophets who have
[35:43] spoken in the name of the Lord for an
[35:46] example of suffering affliction and of
[35:49] patience let's read one more let's go to
[35:51] Hagee i chapter 1 verse 13 Hagee i 1:13
[36:05] how many know that brother Branham
[36:08] brought God's message it was his message
[36:11] to bring by the Rams to preach but it
[36:13] was actually God's message how many know
[36:15] that brother Ram did not think this up
[36:17] and thinking well I like to preach
[36:18] something new this is all for me he
[36:21] never said that it was always God's
[36:24] messenger preaching God's message and
[36:27] that's how we know thus saith the LORD
[36:29] is not from brother Branham it's
[36:31] actually from the Lord here's a
[36:33] beautiful scripture that says it plainly
[36:34] this is how prophets preached a message
[36:37] they must get it from God first Hebrews
[36:41] 1:13 then spake Haggai the Lord's
[36:44] messenger in the Lord's message unto the
[36:49] people saying I am with you say it the
[36:52] Lord are you glad he's with you tonight
[36:53] if God ever sends a message to people
[36:57] he's always letting them know I'm with
[36:59] you alright let's bow our heads for a
[37:01] word of Prayer we know we know Hebrews
[37:03] 13 says the Lord says I will never leave
[37:05] you nor forsake you so we know we have
[37:08] at least two witnesses the Lord is with
[37:09] us here tonight let's bow our heads and
[37:11] church remember he's walking him he's
[37:14] the Bible said he's walking and in the
[37:16] myths of the seven golden candlesticks
[37:18] which is a seven Church ages he's with
[37:20] us here tonight Heavenly Father we bow
[37:23] our heads we just come again Lori read
[37:25] your
[37:25] Lord our title is we have thus saith the
[37:28] Lord and we're grateful for that we
[37:30] recognize that it's your message dear
[37:31] God and father we just want to rehearse
[37:34] these things to our hearts in our minds
[37:37] Lord Jesus and we'd ask O God that they
[37:39] would make us rock solid Lord they would
[37:42] remind us of our rock foundation Lord
[37:45] God and father they would take away any
[37:47] doubts or any confusion any
[37:49] misunderstanding any fear lord or any
[37:52] drifting eyes Lord God that they would
[37:54] just bring us right back Lord to your
[37:57] word and your foundation that we need
[37:59] for surely we want to build our lives
[38:01] upon an unfailing rock Lord a solid rock
[38:04] we don't want it we want to be solid we
[38:06] don't want to be shifting we want to be
[38:08] Lord upon your Eternal Word so bless us
[38:11] now in your divine presence break this
[38:12] word to your people in Jesus Christ's
[38:15] name the church said Amen god bless you
[38:17] mean seated praise God so let's look at
[38:22] this thought here like I said I I never
[38:24] finished it you know I appreciate last
[38:26] last year last year at at North Carolina
[38:30] but I never really got to finish it so I
[38:32] like to preach it here tonight and
[38:36] rehearse some of these things to you by
[38:39] the grace of the Lord now let me read a
[38:44] few things here I'm gonna be reading a
[38:48] lot of quotes tonight now often often
[38:50] I'll put them up here but I didn't have
[38:51] a chance to put them all on individual
[38:53] slides and you know maximize the words
[38:56] or anything like that they're all really
[38:58] small even on my screen here so I'm just
[39:01] going to read off from here by God's
[39:03] grace now bro Ram tells us based upon
[39:07] Matthew 16 where Jesus said flesh and
[39:10] blood hath not revealed it but my father
[39:12] hath revealed it and upon this rock of
[39:15] Revelation I'll build my church the
[39:18] Prophet says the church is built on
[39:20] Revelation on thus saith the Lord
[39:23] anything that God makes known to you
[39:26] that is his will is a revelation how
[39:28] many know that well Graham said he said
[39:31] no revelation is God making his will
[39:33] known to you so when you know it's God's
[39:36] will for you to do something now you
[39:38] have a revelation
[39:39] of God's will and now you have something
[39:43] that you can build your life upon you
[39:45] can build it upon thus sayeth the Lord
[39:48] now program says this in 1956 he says
[39:53] say I feel religious I really do
[39:56] oh it's wonderful to serve the Lord and
[39:58] no it's thus saith the Lord takes all
[40:00] the Scarecrow's out and the spooks out
[40:03] and puts the Holy Spirit in there and
[40:06] lives with you with the Dove of meekness
[40:08] and quietness and eternal hope in your
[40:11] heart he said it takes all the guests
[40:14] out and all the hocus-pocus out and all
[40:17] the formalism out of your heart and puts
[40:19] a real nose so in there and a faith
[40:22] that's everlasting true amen he said
[40:25] that's true
[40:27] so I hope you heard that there he said
[40:30] it takes all the Scarecrow's out right
[40:32] remember scarecrows are set up to scare
[40:34] away the birds but if there's a
[40:36] scarecrow
[40:36] there must be something real after that
[40:39] right so if the devil is trying to put a
[40:41] scarecrow where you're not sure about
[40:43] something you got to remember there's
[40:45] something real there like that we know
[40:47] the Bible said there's a deep call to
[40:50] the deep praise God
[40:51] if you've got a deep desire for
[40:53] something from God in your heart and
[40:54] Satan puts a scarecrow there just
[40:56] remember that that thus saith the Lord
[40:58] will take you past that scarecrow and
[41:01] it'll take you to the the possession or
[41:03] or the your inheritance that God wants
[41:07] to give you praise God that's right so
[41:10] the said the Lord takes out the
[41:12] scarecrow the spooks and it gives you
[41:15] the Dove of meekness and quietness and
[41:17] eternal hope it takes the guessing out
[41:20] all the hocus-pocus all the formalism
[41:23] and puts a real no-show in there and a
[41:27] faith that's everlasting amen
[41:30] what a confidence that we have when God
[41:32] gives us thus saith the Lord
[41:34] there's no more guessing there's no more
[41:36] wondering about it there's no more
[41:37] questions we have exactly God's Word we
[41:40] know exactly what God wants us to do
[41:42] amen
[41:44] but Rahab said he was talking about how
[41:47] he was preaching this a new quote
[41:48] brother Ram because he had thus saith
[41:51] the Lord he said
[41:52] he said now you see why I'm hampering
[41:54] the way I do
[41:55] I got thus saith the Lord a church have
[41:59] you ever hammered how many hammering in
[42:01] a nail recently most of time I don't use
[42:03] hammers I use screws the power screw
[42:05] right so that's a lot easier than
[42:07] hammering it but the it's been a while
[42:10] since I used to hammer but I have you
[42:12] know I guess in the last year or so
[42:13] we've hammered different things but
[42:16] brother ham says as a Christian you're
[42:17] hammering away at something you're
[42:19] trying to you know drive a nail right
[42:22] you're trying to make something stick to
[42:24] something you're trying to make
[42:26] something solid right you don't want
[42:28] something that's flimsy that'll fall
[42:29] apart and brother says what what gives
[42:32] him strength to keep hammering away is
[42:34] that he has thus saith the Lord in other
[42:37] words he knows what God wants done with
[42:39] his life that's why he can just keep
[42:41] hammering away he can keep pressing on
[42:44] and church isn't that how you can keep
[42:46] pressing on you're not wondering if if
[42:49] our church is right about the Bible we
[42:51] don't don't wonder about is is this the
[42:53] right way for me to live I live
[42:56] hammering on that nail you can keep
[42:58] driving a nail after now after nail you
[43:00] can keep putting up the wall you can
[43:02] keep putting up this foundation you can
[43:04] keep putting up the house that God's
[43:06] giving you spiritually because you've
[43:08] got thus saith the Lord you got the
[43:10] blueprint ain't a glory you can hammer
[43:13] away you can keep putting up God's will
[43:16] for your life because you got thus saith
[43:19] the Lord hallelujah the Prophet tells us
[43:24] here that when you've got thus saith the
[43:28] Lord he said then you put away the
[43:30] leadership of man and man's plans and
[43:33] man's ambitions and thus saith the Holy
[43:37] Ghost is a living reality so church when
[43:43] you've got thus saith the Lord it's a
[43:44] reality your life is real it doesn't
[43:49] seem like a dream it doesn't seem like
[43:52] you're grasping at you know trying to
[43:54] grab a hold of something that you just
[43:56] can never grab a hold of right now
[44:00] you've got to bear with me here Church
[44:01] there's a part of us where the Bible
[44:03] says work we're longing right all
[44:05] creation is long
[44:06] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[44:08] right we're all longing for the latter
[44:11] rain I believe brother Simon said he
[44:12] mentioned that on Sunday the latter
[44:13] eight we're all waiting for the latter
[44:15] rain but just while we're waiting it
[44:18] doesn't mean we're just kind of guessing
[44:20] at our life we should know exactly what
[44:24] our life has meant to be amen
[44:26] we should know what God has called us to
[44:28] do and Lord willing we'll look at that
[44:31] on Sunday here by God's grace but it
[44:34] should be a reality we should know
[44:36] exactly what God has called us to do
[44:39] because we have thus saith the Lord amen
[44:42] hallelujah programs had noticed the
[44:47] harmony of the father and the son Jesus
[44:49] never did anything unless it was first
[44:51] showed him by the father John 5:19 this
[44:54] harmony is now to exist between the
[44:57] groom and his bride he says the word is
[45:02] in the ride as it wasn't Mary the bride
[45:05] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[45:07] what he wants done with the word she
[45:10] performs the command of the word in his
[45:12] name for she has thus saith the Lord
[45:16] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[45:19] and it comes to pass like a seed that's
[45:22] planted and watered it comes a full
[45:24] harvest serving its purpose hallelujah
[45:28] so brother ham says the word should be
[45:31] in you like it was in Mary how did the
[45:34] word get in Mary the Holy Ghost
[45:36] overshadowed her how does the word get
[45:38] in you the Holy Ghost has to do more
[45:40] than overshadow and you he has to live
[45:42] in you amen he has to seal your soul
[45:46] seal means mark he has to be a mark upon
[45:49] your soul and then you know what he once
[45:53] done with the word now churches should
[45:56] be pretty easy for us we should know
[45:59] what God wants done with this word right
[46:02] for example when we see somebody sick we
[46:06] should know what God wants done we
[46:08] should pray and find out God is at your
[46:09] wheel to heal them and if not then God
[46:12] then help us to show mercy to them help
[46:15] us to show them some kind of love if we
[46:18] see somebody the church you don't have
[46:19] enough money
[46:20] or seems like they're struggling we
[46:21] should feel we should know what God does
[46:23] once done with the word the Bible said
[46:26] you should do good to those of the
[46:27] household of faith especially as it is
[46:30] the opportunity that you have to do it
[46:32] grace it hard we should know what God
[46:37] wants and with the word the Bible says
[46:39] gather more as you see that Day
[46:40] approaching so if I call the service on
[46:43] New Year's Eve which I might and we
[46:46] might have communion on New Year's Eve
[46:47] night then you should come because the
[46:50] Bible says that gather more's you see
[46:52] the Day approaching we should know what
[46:54] God wants done with his word praise God
[46:58] and church that fills many of our days
[47:01] there's many days we don't have to
[47:02] remember to know or we have to know we
[47:04] don't have to wonder what does God want
[47:06] done today we should know most days what
[47:09] God once done we should look out and see
[47:11] the needs of the people if we're living
[47:13] for others we should have our eyes on
[47:15] other people and we should be able to
[47:17] try and help them by God's grace amen
[47:20] hallelujah amen she knows what he wants
[47:25] done with us say the Lord praise God he
[47:32] said those in the bride do only his will
[47:34] no man can make them do otherwise they
[47:37] have thus saith the LORD or they keep
[47:38] still they know that it has to be God in
[47:42] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[47:45] word he did not complete all his work
[47:47] while he while in his earthly ministry
[47:49] so now he works in and through the bride
[47:54] she things that him up but he will now
[48:00] fulfill through the bride the work that
[48:02] he left for this specific time praise
[48:05] God
[48:05] oh thank you Lord God's doing something
[48:08] now in other words God left a job for us
[48:11] to do praise the Lord
[48:14] now let me jump to another quote 1965 C
[48:18] does not air with a Chuck motor and said
[48:19] o jehovih eagle feed your little ones
[48:22] tonight upon that word Lord they're
[48:24] needy
[48:25] that's the diet they need that's what
[48:26] they need to know what the food is what
[48:29] thus saith the Lord is so your food
[48:33] but you're gonna eat on tonight what you
[48:35] eat on every service it should be the
[48:37] stay at the Lord and if not Church I'll
[48:40] tell you I'll say this is my thought
[48:41] where I'm not sure what brother I met
[48:43] here or I don't know what this means
[48:45] here but but when we've got the word and
[48:48] we know what the word says in a life
[48:49] with the Prophet and everything is
[48:51] pointing in one direction everything's
[48:53] in harmony then we know we've got thus
[48:55] saith the Lord hallelujah now here's
[49:02] what we'll find here brother Branham
[49:05] says it's not like it used to be his
[49:07] people has lost their common decency and
[49:10] modesty he said it used to be when the
[49:13] Prophet said thus saith the Lord the
[49:14] people trembled he said yea they
[49:16] certainly did they were they the people
[49:18] move for they were afraid but now they
[49:21] lost all the scare of it they don't fear
[49:23] God but the fear of God is the beginning
[49:25] of wisdom just the beginning of it so
[49:29] when we get to the spot where we're
[49:31] really nervous like oh I better do this
[49:33] have you ever been there recently I
[49:35] better confess this sir oh my I better
[49:37] do this when you're trembling right
[49:38] there and you're you're fearing God now
[49:41] you've got the beginning of wisdom
[49:43] praise God that's right church but the
[49:49] Prophet today can speak with thus saith
[49:51] the Lord and that people say nonsense
[49:54] see there's not a hope for them so
[49:57] church there's only a hope for those of
[49:59] us who tremble at the sat the Lord
[50:03] that's going to take a real sincere
[50:05] Christian isn't it it's not going to
[50:07] just takes not just gonna be somebody
[50:08] who just sometimes reads their Bible
[50:10] sometimes prays or we're just going
[50:12] through the motions of coming to church
[50:13] it could take somebody who really
[50:15] believes that this is God speaking to us
[50:18] right now that's right
[50:24] the Prophet goes
[50:26] to say this in power transformation it
[50:28] used to be in the church life long ago
[50:30] when the prophet has something to say
[50:32] thus saith the Lord the people moved
[50:33] they stayed right with it they moved but
[50:36] now they say I don't like that guy
[50:38] vote him out he said see they don't have
[50:41] understanding no more the people just
[50:42] don't move by the Spirit of God anymore
[50:45] he says God's Word as his spirit and his
[50:48] word comes to his prophet and the word
[50:50] is supposed to transform you from what
[50:53] the things of the world are into the
[50:55] image of sense of sons and daughters of
[50:58] God and the world can only come through
[51:01] these prophets as they spoke and it came
[51:03] has to be compared with the word and
[51:05] show that it was the word then if you
[51:07] accept that it'll transform you amen how
[51:11] many want to be transformed to be more
[51:12] like Christ yeah I was watching a little
[51:14] glassblowing class you ever seen
[51:16] glassblowing didn't we never see that
[51:18] and it reminded me of this word conform
[51:23] hum you know the Bible says we must be
[51:24] conformed to the image of the son of God
[51:27] anything that you see that's made of
[51:29] glass like these mason jars anything
[51:33] that's glass ornaments anything that's
[51:35] made of glass they've got to put it on
[51:37] this stick this big long rod they got to
[51:39] heat this furnace up to like thousands
[51:42] of degrees and they got to stick that in
[51:45] there and they just got to keep turning
[51:46] in it so all the heat goes equally
[51:49] around all there and then they got to
[51:52] bring it out they got to put these
[51:53] gloves on the handle and they got to
[51:55] have a tool and they got to start
[51:57] forming it and once it starts cooling
[51:59] off they got to put it in there again
[52:01] and they got to bring it out they got to
[52:02] smooth it out and they've got to shape
[52:04] that thing and and finally when it's
[52:06] about ready they'll have like a like a
[52:09] cookie cutter kind of thing and they've
[52:11] got to put that cookie cutter around
[52:13] that glass there to get the right shape
[52:16] kind like a template every know what I'm
[52:17] talking about what's what's another word
[52:19] like a factory makes them what are those
[52:21] called then they got like little
[52:23] templates I'm not sure what they're
[52:24] called now but it's like a cookie cutter
[52:29] yeah like a pretty a like a printing
[52:32] press or something like that so they had
[52:34] like that like they were making they
[52:35] were making sinks out of glass they're
[52:37] these stylish sinks that's when I was
[52:39] watching
[52:39] and so you know you have your faucet
[52:41] right and they're making a curved faucet
[52:43] and so that to take that faucet and know
[52:46] now then take the glass which was almost
[52:48] of the shape of the faucet and they had
[52:50] to kind of push it into that that cookie
[52:53] cutter thing there and then it pushed
[52:56] out everything that wasn't exactly right
[52:59] and when they brought it out of that
[53:01] pattern
[53:02] it was exactly in the right pattern and
[53:04] they just had to shave off some of the
[53:06] sides amen that's what all I should be
[53:08] praise God all live shirts got to be
[53:11] taking on this big stick of God and the
[53:14] Bible says the fiery trial of your faith
[53:16] will work patience in your life amen
[53:20] did you know that there's a pattern that
[53:22] God wants to form you off of and it's
[53:24] the pattern of Jesus Christ amen
[53:27] I'll tell you that's a really nice
[53:29] pattern and I'll tell you like this our
[53:31] lives don't always fit it very well do
[53:33] they and the church said how many of you
[53:38] live a life like Jesus Christ constantly
[53:41] casting out demons and healing the sick
[53:43] and raising the dead amen
[53:46] now we might not be called all those
[53:48] things but at the same time don't you
[53:50] want to live a higher life so God has to
[53:52] you have to say God okay take me through
[53:55] this fire take me through this trial
[53:57] help me not to take myself out of it and
[53:59] you know try to take the easy way let me
[54:01] go through the fiery trials and then for
[54:04] me let me be formed in the image and the
[54:07] shape of your son Jesus Christ amen but
[54:11] that's watching they got to keep that
[54:13] glass in there a long time it's got to
[54:15] be and around and around and around it's
[54:19] got to go it's got to go back in and
[54:21] another trial and another trial then put
[54:24] it in that little pattern maker there
[54:27] I'll just say like that a die again it
[54:29] might be a die there we go and you got
[54:31] to put in the die that's what we need to
[54:32] do die glory we need to fit into the die
[54:37] and it's the only way to do that is
[54:39] pressure they've got to put the pressure
[54:41] on that glass and put into that die so
[54:44] it fits and then they got to trim off
[54:45] anything that doesn't match that die or
[54:48] that pattern and this word is the great
[54:50] pattern that we want our lives to be
[54:52] based upon
[54:54] praise the Lord as a member it's never
[54:57] going to be in some great big Church
[54:59] Church we got such a we got such a
[55:01] blessing we have such an advantage
[55:03] because we're not a part of some big
[55:05] denomination or organization we're not
[55:08] following man we're not following money
[55:10] or popularity we have such an advantage
[55:12] but we've got to give a bit a greater
[55:14] sacrifice we've got to give God more of
[55:17] ourselves we got a trend what does st.
[55:19] the Lord amen praise God we have to
[55:26] tremble at the say the Lord if you want
[55:27] to be transformed you got to trem what
[55:29] the word when you went out when I read
[55:33] what what brother Adam says with thus
[55:34] saith the Lord I read out of the Bible
[55:36] and it's thus saith the Lord and if we
[55:38] don't tremble at it something's wrong
[55:39] with us I mean if we're not living it
[55:42] yeah you don't have to tremble if you're
[55:44] living it you can just rejoice and say
[55:46] hallelujah
[55:46] keep me humble Lord keep me on a real
[55:48] sweet Christian but if we're not living
[55:51] it we should be able to sit we should be
[55:54] able to tremble and say God help me to
[55:55] live that because when you tremble
[55:58] physically it shows that spiritually
[56:00] you've got the fear of the Lord that's
[56:03] what brother Branham said power
[56:04] transformation now here's the trouble
[56:08] church let me read it to you when the
[56:11] world and the church joins itself
[56:13] together then they don't want nothing
[56:16] spiritual they don't want thus saith the
[56:21] Lord they want what they want they want
[56:24] the world and to say they're Christian
[56:26] but live in the world and live with the
[56:29] world and live like the world and still
[56:32] maintain their confession of being a
[56:34] Christian that's a program says so they
[56:40] that's what the worldly Christians do
[56:43] they really don't want thus saith the
[56:45] Lord like like it is with water baptism
[56:47] right it's an easy one well you should
[56:50] you have to be baptized in the name of
[56:52] Lord Jesus Christ to receive the Holy
[56:54] Ghost and they'll say oh no it's okay I
[56:56] can still be sprinkled or I can use
[56:57] father son Holy Ghost right that's what
[57:01] people will say they don't want you to
[57:03] actually tell them that no it's actually
[57:05] thus saith the Lord if you want the
[57:07] the ghosts you got to be baptized in the
[57:08] name of Lord Jesus Christ right they
[57:13] don't want that say the Lord because
[57:15] they want to live like the world and
[57:16] still be called a Christian and we've
[57:19] got to make sure that we don't get
[57:20] complacent in our Christian walks with
[57:22] God right and just say well I've come
[57:26] this far I can relax I could I can just
[57:28] cool off with God no we've got to take
[57:31] thus saith the Lord to be transformed by
[57:33] the Word of God all right now I want to
[57:40] make I want to find something real quick
[57:42] here because I know I got something that
[57:44] everybody wants and I've got a thus
[57:46] saith the Lord for you because I never
[57:49] preached this anywhere I told you I was
[57:51] going to preach it my little prayer
[57:52] series I think I got through three only
[57:54] three parts on that series because I
[57:56] started reading other things I started
[57:57] reading other books maybe I'll go back
[58:00] to that we'll see but I got some quotes
[58:02] here I want to make sure that I pour in
[58:04] here and we'll probably revisit them
[58:06] again by the grace of the Lord yeah here
[58:15] they are here's one here's one yeah this
[58:21] will make sure I don't miss this here
[58:29] all right so here it is now before you
[58:32] raise your hand let me warn you don't
[58:34] raise your hand unless you really mean
[58:36] it but I'm not I'm not gonna ask you to
[58:41] raise your hands
[58:41] but just think in your heart if you
[58:43] would like to have a revival don't worry
[58:47] your hands because rub man tells us the
[58:50] stay at the Lord how to get a revival
[58:51] and that's not like well that's a pretty
[58:55] good idea too brother branham it's thus
[59:00] saith the lord so this is from 1956 and
[59:05] this is in Shreveport Louisiana
[59:08] now he's preaching this miss message
[59:11] called make the valley full of ditches
[59:12] remember that Jehoshaphat and Ahab's son
[59:17] right we're coming to Elisha I think it
[59:21] was it was Elijah for thus saith the
[59:23] Lord and Elisha is like I'm not gonna
[59:25] talk to them but the only reason I will
[59:27] be was because jehosophat's here
[59:28] remember that and they say what do we do
[59:32] you know we've got to take this victory
[59:33] and Elisha said thus saith the Lord go
[59:36] make the valley full of ditches and he
[59:38] was saying you got to dig and what
[59:40] remember that when they dug out the
[59:41] ditches water filled them and then when
[59:43] the enemy woke up in the morning the
[59:45] sunlight reflected off and it looked
[59:46] like blood and the enemy all got
[59:48] confuses at all we've all heard they've
[59:51] already defeated all these people let's
[59:53] run away that's what the enemy always
[59:55] does he runs at the blood of Jesus
[59:57] Christ amen
[59:58] hallelujah the brother has preaching
[1:00:02] this message in Louisiana now let's see
[1:00:05] if you want a revival and I got to do
[1:00:07] the same thing and now Church if you
[1:00:09] want a revival this would make you
[1:00:10] tremble in your soul if you want a
[1:00:13] revival or if you want to see revival in
[1:00:16] someone else's life
[1:00:17] I've never preached this anywhere so
[1:00:20] it's coming tonight he says now notice
[1:00:24] when they begin to dig they dug against
[1:00:27] things they just throwed it out they
[1:00:28] made big ditches the next morning the
[1:00:30] enemy looked down and the Sun come up
[1:00:32] and looked like blood they said well
[1:00:34] they fought on one soldier killed each
[1:00:36] other and away they went and
[1:00:42] were ambushed and they said this is just
[1:00:44] the light thing before the Lord sending
[1:00:47] forth his water and they went out into
[1:00:49] another land and they stopped up every
[1:00:51] well they cut down every good tree they
[1:00:53] just had a real old-fashioned revival so
[1:00:57] but I'm saying revival comes by digging
[1:01:01] revival comes by cutting digging and
[1:01:07] cutting brings revival brother Branham
[1:01:10] says listen Church I'm getting I'm
[1:01:14] getting to thus saith the Lord and I
[1:01:18] think if you're honest Church if you've
[1:01:20] ever seen a revival in your life which I
[1:01:21] know bang and I have and I'm sure
[1:01:23] everybody everybody's here seen a
[1:01:24] revival in your life right where the
[1:01:27] dead things you push out the dead things
[1:01:28] and now y'all you got no dead things in
[1:01:30] your life you're just living pure before
[1:01:32] the Lord how many of how many ever felt
[1:01:33] that way now it'd be a good time to
[1:01:34] raise your hand there's be a good time
[1:01:36] before I get to this quote if you've
[1:01:40] ever pushed all the dirty things out of
[1:01:42] your lake right like bro that's all the
[1:01:44] lake and here's a storm and a push out
[1:01:45] all the day if you've ever pushed now I
[1:01:47] don't want that anymore I don't want to
[1:01:49] see that I don't want to say that
[1:01:50] anymore I don't want to treat people
[1:01:52] like that if you've ever gotten to that
[1:01:54] place you've had revival Amen hallelujah
[1:01:57] and it takes Diggy now and it takes
[1:02:01] cutting out and he says they had a real
[1:02:07] old-fashioned
[1:02:08] and when it gets to that place at the
[1:02:10] people that love God will throw
[1:02:13] everything they got right into the
[1:02:16] revival with are you ready are you ready
[1:02:20] take a deep breath drink some water
[1:02:23] maybe you got to run to get some water
[1:02:25] real quick so you don't pass out he says
[1:02:29] we'll throw everything out and get right
[1:02:31] into revival with prayer and with
[1:02:35] everything else and seek God's face and
[1:02:37] pray and seek God and call out in the
[1:02:41] hours of the night for mercy and get the
[1:02:46] neighbors saved and so forth
[1:02:48] I tell you we'll stop the mouth of every
[1:02:52] critic we'll knock down every formal
[1:02:54] thing that's standing up and they'll
[1:02:55] have to know that God's been in the camp
[1:02:58] that's right friends we'll never do it
[1:03:01] until that thing takes place what thing
[1:03:04] he says prank seeking God and calling
[1:03:07] out to God in the night he said that's
[1:03:10] the way of revival for thus saith the
[1:03:13] Lord Elijah spoke it in the name of the
[1:03:16] Lord amen that's why didn't I didn't
[1:03:22] want to ask you to raise your hands now
[1:03:25] when if that ever becomes of the sat the
[1:03:27] Lord reality to us we know the way of
[1:03:31] revival now it's through prayer seeking
[1:03:35] the face of God
[1:03:37] trying to get the neighbor saved and at
[1:03:39] any time of the day calling out for
[1:03:41] mercy listen it don't have to be a
[1:03:42] nighttime making me during the daytime
[1:03:44] the thing is we just got it if God's
[1:03:47] really in your heart for revival brother
[1:03:49] hands houses thus saith the Lord you
[1:03:51] seek God and that lines up with what
[1:03:53] Peter said if you draw nigh to God God
[1:03:56] will draw nigh to you I mean it lines up
[1:03:59] with every other scripture if anybody
[1:04:01] wants revival in our church er if we
[1:04:04] will revival in our lives we've got to
[1:04:06] do thus saith the Lord
[1:04:08] he said that's the way for revival so in
[1:04:14] other words it means giving God all your
[1:04:16] free time praise God
[1:04:19] god never asked us to quit working Paul
[1:04:23] had great revivals but he's still had
[1:04:25] time to make tents praise the Lord he
[1:04:28] said time to eat right now I hope that
[1:04:34] was a blessing there and you could see
[1:04:36] that now I think there's another one let
[1:04:43] me see if I can find it real quick I
[1:04:44] thought I had - thus saith the Lord's on
[1:04:47] prayer oh here it is yeah yeah here's
[1:04:50] another one he said yeah here this
[1:04:52] chatauqua ohio 1960 he says if he can
[1:04:59] just get the Pentecostal Church now
[1:05:01] let's bring it down to us let's bring it
[1:05:02] down to message okay that's can we just
[1:05:04] bring it home tonight
[1:05:05] let me let me put let me put our church
[1:05:07] name into it if he can get Bride of
[1:05:09] Christ Fellowship Church to start
[1:05:12] thinking more of their buildings and
[1:05:14] their well-dressed congregations then
[1:05:20] they do have an old-fashioned prayer
[1:05:23] meeting and pairing meeting and the
[1:05:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost and a godly
[1:05:29] life and clean up their women and clean
[1:05:32] up their men make them live holy and
[1:05:34] either toe the mark or get out and not
[1:05:37] put so much on money and more money and
[1:05:39] raising funds the first thing you know
[1:05:41] you're gonna find going off without
[1:05:44] Christ again amen so like Mary and
[1:05:47] Joseph they left Christ right back at
[1:05:49] Jerusalem Laura said that's what the
[1:05:51] church does they leave the revival they
[1:05:54] leave Christ they leave the word and
[1:05:56] they care more about buildings clothes
[1:05:58] money and all these other things and I'm
[1:06:03] not done I'm not done brother sister you
[1:06:08] remember this listen thus saith the Lord
[1:06:11] now this I hope this makes somebody trim
[1:06:13] me the church better clean up you're
[1:06:15] drifting too far out come back to the
[1:06:18] Lord come back to real prayer meetings
[1:06:21] now church you might this might be just
[1:06:24] for Chautauqua Ohio's Church and night
[1:06:27] in in June of 1960 but listen it's got
[1:06:30] to be the same yesterday today and
[1:06:31] forever
[1:06:32] they cannot have a Holy Ghost revival
[1:06:34] any differently than we could and church
[1:06:38] brother hey miss and he just got the
[1:06:39] Holy Ghost two months ago
[1:06:41] I mean the Holy Ghost has been here
[1:06:42] praise God he was memories praying all
[1:06:45] week for the Holy Ghost I think he may
[1:06:48] have missed a few meals sport and he's
[1:06:51] been a different person since then he's
[1:06:53] been faithful right here it is posted
[1:06:56] dude he has he not see because the Holy
[1:06:59] Ghost puts you in power for service and
[1:07:02] this is the best service you could be in
[1:07:04] right here tonight amen because God says
[1:07:09] gather more gather more as you see the
[1:07:11] Day approaching get together with the
[1:07:12] Saints if you love one another you'll
[1:07:13] get together with each other and that's
[1:07:16] how you know you're my disciples you
[1:07:18] have love for the believers let me read
[1:07:21] that again brother sister you remember
[1:07:24] all my brothers did all my sisters here
[1:07:25] tonight
[1:07:26] you remember this thus saith the Lord
[1:07:28] the church better clean up you're
[1:07:30] drifting too far out come back to the
[1:07:32] Lord come back to rear real prayer
[1:07:34] meetings now I've told you this I've
[1:07:38] invited you to prayer meetings my heart
[1:07:40] my prayer meeting is 30 minutes before
[1:07:42] church that's a good prayer meeting
[1:07:45] could the Holy Spirit lead us to more
[1:07:47] sure but we ought to support the ones
[1:07:51] we've already got going first and then
[1:07:54] that'll create a hunger for more I
[1:07:55] believe a church that's those who are
[1:07:59] thus saith the Lord if you really want
[1:08:01] to revival if somebody wants to revival
[1:08:02] in their heart we don't have to wonder
[1:08:04] what it takes
[1:08:05] program tells us it takes us cleaning
[1:08:08] out a digging out digging out everything
[1:08:10] out of our life cutting down anything
[1:08:12] that's grown up in our lives seeking the
[1:08:15] face of God calling out to God
[1:08:17] I've never preached it anywhere else I
[1:08:19] was saving it right here for the home
[1:08:20] church
[1:08:21] I didn't preach this in North Carolina
[1:08:23] last year but this is the way for
[1:08:26] revival anything's that that's that's
[1:08:29] this laying in our lives must be dug out
[1:08:31] anything growing up must be cut down and
[1:08:33] let's give ourselves to prayer seeking
[1:08:36] the face of God he says that's thus
[1:08:39] saith the Lord
[1:08:40] that's how a revival comes
[1:08:45] hallelujah so I want to lay that in
[1:08:52] because I think that's most important
[1:08:54] how many be that's important to us
[1:08:56] certainly and like with brother amen
[1:08:59] testimony said he was praying all week
[1:09:01] for the Holy Ghost listen to the token
[1:09:03] message all week and you and you and I
[1:09:06] can do that too that's it we might you
[1:09:08] might already think you're born again
[1:09:09] which is wonderful praise God
[1:09:11] if God's give you that revelation but
[1:09:13] what about saving your neighbor that's
[1:09:16] something I can do right what about
[1:09:18] saving family members that's something I
[1:09:20] can do that's something you can do but
[1:09:22] if we really want to see revival the
[1:09:24] Prophet said that's how it's got to be
[1:09:26] done we really have to seek the face of
[1:09:28] God amen and that's not the stage I see
[1:09:32] that's thus saith the Lord
[1:09:35] that's right the Bible want a revival
[1:09:38] you got to dig out cut down seek the
[1:09:40] face of God
[1:09:41] God brings revival now see that's what
[1:09:46] the denominations do Church and you've
[1:09:47] all heard it you've all watched TBN or
[1:09:49] you probably watch YouTube of preachers
[1:09:51] every year this is the time church in
[1:09:53] fact it's going to be this Sunday every
[1:09:55] Church around in America is gonna say
[1:09:57] well that's I'm bringing the word for
[1:09:59] 2019 how many times have I seen that
[1:10:02] well let me let me prophesy let me give
[1:10:05] you a word from the Lord for 2019 Church
[1:10:08] if you're not a prophet if I'm not a
[1:10:10] prophet that we don't really have the
[1:10:13] word for in 2019 but let me tell you
[1:10:16] we've got the word for the age of
[1:10:18] Laodicea praise God now don't get me
[1:10:22] wrong God might speak through some of
[1:10:23] these things but what it oftentimes is
[1:10:25] is just people trying to become a minor
[1:10:27] prophet or something like that
[1:10:29] preachers just trying to prophesy oh
[1:10:31] this is the now whoever now listen
[1:10:33] whoever comes whoever follows up with
[1:10:35] those things that make sure it's right
[1:10:37] and the scene was this a year of what
[1:10:40] all those things they prophesied nobody
[1:10:42] follows up with it see because it's not
[1:10:44] real real revival it's not a real
[1:10:46] prophecy it's just presuming we don't
[1:10:49] want to presume we want to tremble it up
[1:10:51] saith the Lord amen
[1:10:54] and I'm not asking everybody to fast and
[1:10:56] pray and I mean if you got
[1:10:58] to do that but I'm saying if you if you
[1:11:00] and I ever won a revival we know thus
[1:11:04] saith the Lord what needs to be done
[1:11:07] pray see God called on God throughout
[1:11:10] the day night call on him all the time
[1:11:12] and he says thus saith the Lord will
[1:11:13] have a revival Amen so I never preached
[1:11:20] it anywhere I saved it for all you cuz I
[1:11:22] love you so much
[1:11:23] you're my sheep and I mean I'm your
[1:11:26] shepherd none just naturally but I'm a
[1:11:28] sheep too I need God's help too
[1:11:30] I'm not trying to exalt myself in like
[1:11:32] that but the Bible does say yeah I need
[1:11:33] a shepherd so I'm saying this is what
[1:11:36] thus saith the Lord is we have thus
[1:11:38] sayeth the Lord
[1:11:40] now remember this is the way to know the
[1:11:43] sayeth the Lord brother Branham says I'm
[1:11:44] speaking now but when he speaks I say
[1:11:47] it's not me it's thus saith the Lord he
[1:11:50] says and I can't say it until he tells
[1:11:52] me praise God
[1:11:57] now let me see how I'm doing on time
[1:11:59] here
[1:12:00] give me 30 more minutes I'd like to just
[1:12:03] do 30 more minutes that would give me an
[1:12:04] hour alright now let me go through these
[1:12:08] briefly and then it will try to close in
[1:12:11] 30 minutes now 30 minutes I don't know
[1:12:13] that's a bad word to use close I just
[1:12:15] shouldn't say that word until I'm ready
[1:12:17] to close there's three fulfilled or
[1:12:20] standing prophecies brother random game
[1:12:22] three of them are standing now these are
[1:12:26] ones that let me say like this these are
[1:12:28] ones that he said on tape before they
[1:12:29] happen there's some that are standing
[1:12:31] that were never on tape like the seven
[1:12:33] major visions of 1933 that was never on
[1:12:35] tape so we we actually can't say to
[1:12:37] somebody we'll see this was recorded
[1:12:39] before it happened we don't have the
[1:12:41] recording before it happens so while I
[1:12:43] believe those prophecies from 1933 I
[1:12:46] believe them I can't actually say that
[1:12:49] that I have proof that they had they
[1:12:51] were prophesied before they actually
[1:12:52] happened does anybody understand okay I
[1:12:55] believe they were but I don't have any
[1:12:57] proof other than just someone's word and
[1:13:01] even that was not in 1933 it was in 1958
[1:13:05] was the earliest one I had of that but
[1:13:07] let me give you three that have already
[1:13:09] fulfilled or standing the first
[1:13:12] BAM says this he says the sign of the
[1:13:14] sermon he says the Royal seed of Abraham
[1:13:17] let me tell you the saith the Lord
[1:13:19] you're receiving your last son that's
[1:13:21] according to the scripture and the
[1:13:22] revelation of God in my heart that
[1:13:24] speaks this is the truth he says thus
[1:13:28] saith the Lord you will never and no
[1:13:30] more Gentile church age ever see any
[1:13:33] sign to succeed this go greater this is
[1:13:37] the last sign to the church amen glory
[1:13:40] brother Rams gifted discernment in the
[1:13:42] prayer line was the last sign to the
[1:13:45] Gentile church before the rapture thus
[1:13:47] saith the Lord he said nothing will rise
[1:13:50] he says if something rise is greater
[1:13:53] than this call me a false prophet has
[1:13:55] anything risen greater than brother Rams
[1:13:57] discernment no nothing is even close
[1:14:01] they're just guessing in ballpark
[1:14:04] prophecies nothing even comes close
[1:14:07] remember I heard I heard a recording a
[1:14:09] Benny Hinn he seems to be like the
[1:14:11] closest I imagine but there's recording
[1:14:13] of him in 1988 is and he's saying in the
[1:14:16] 1990s God will judge the homosexuals and
[1:14:19] burn them up in America did that ever
[1:14:21] happen no they only got more and more so
[1:14:27] see whenever they've tried to prophesy
[1:14:29] they always fail because God's not with
[1:14:32] them they might get the anointing as you
[1:14:34] know false prophets false Christ get the
[1:14:36] anointing sometimes and God might do
[1:14:38] miracles and things like that but when
[1:14:40] they try to prophesy it's never gonna be
[1:14:42] right it's not gonna be right because
[1:14:44] they're not they're not obeying all the
[1:14:46] Word of God because I thought the women
[1:14:49] cut their hair and he you know they
[1:14:50] these he's been known to do drugs and
[1:14:52] he's the lover of money rather than
[1:14:54] lovers of God we know it's we know how
[1:14:56] they live all right second here's
[1:15:00] another one this is so true knowing -
[1:15:03] one - the end time he said it's
[1:15:06] predicted they're going to it and
[1:15:07] they're going to do it for it's thus
[1:15:09] saith the Lord they're going to do it
[1:15:11] you remember them denominations will
[1:15:13] never break up and their denomination
[1:15:15] come back to the word it's thus saith
[1:15:17] the Lord they won't they will they go
[1:15:19] into the Antichrist exactly it's thus
[1:15:22] saith the Lord they will amen hallelujah
[1:15:26] so I told brother fangs when a brother
[1:15:28] brains banks brother I'm not going to
[1:15:29] call his name but I told brother veins
[1:15:31] brother to his face I said it's thus
[1:15:33] saith the Lord you better come on that
[1:15:34] denomination because I said your
[1:15:36] denomination is gonna take the mark of
[1:15:38] the beast I said it's thus saith the
[1:15:39] Lord and he told me said I'm gonna wait
[1:15:42] there to the sea if they get a revival
[1:15:44] and last time I talked to him he said
[1:15:45] they hadn't got it yet and I told me
[1:15:46] what you better get out of here sometime
[1:15:48] soon I said you don't have to come to
[1:15:50] our church but you better get out of
[1:15:51] denomination because it's thus saith the
[1:15:53] Lord they'll never break up their
[1:15:55] denominations and come back to the
[1:15:56] message and they will take the mark of
[1:15:59] the beast
[1:16:00] it's thus saith the Lord they will
[1:16:02] because that's what Revelation 13 says
[1:16:04] he deceives all nations and they all
[1:16:07] take a mark that they they so they can
[1:16:09] buy and sell and worship the Beast
[1:16:10] worship Antichrist they all going to
[1:16:12] Rome we know it okay that's the second
[1:16:15] thing
[1:16:15] third thing the third thing was on the
[1:16:21] preview of the bride oh here's another
[1:16:26] one - here's what I'm sorry yeah this is
[1:16:27] another one that goes along with that
[1:16:29] denomination one he says the chief
[1:16:31] captain Jesus Christ our general wants
[1:16:34] to lead us into the promised land and
[1:16:36] he's the only one that can do it our
[1:16:38] organizations will not do it thus saith
[1:16:40] the Lord mark that down praise God
[1:16:44] amen Church you're in the best place how
[1:16:47] many wanna go in the promised land of
[1:16:48] the rapture can I say like that you're
[1:16:50] in the black best place to do it because
[1:16:52] it's thus saith the Lord
[1:16:54] denominations can't take you there only
[1:16:56] Christ can take you there
[1:16:58] glory so the third one the first one is
[1:17:05] that we have the last sign
[1:17:06] he said no sign will ever rise greater
[1:17:08] than brother Graham's time discernment
[1:17:09] and never has that prophecy standing
[1:17:12] second one the denominations will never
[1:17:14] come back to the message and they'll all
[1:17:15] go the Antichrist the third but then
[1:17:18] said the preview of the bride he saw the
[1:17:21] Church of United States dancing the
[1:17:23] rock-and-roll smoking cigarettes naked
[1:17:26] from the waist up led by a witch I don't
[1:17:30] know who that witches in the Christian
[1:17:32] denominations but he said they're led by
[1:17:35] a witch dancing to rock and roll
[1:17:39] yeah might be a might be I'll have to
[1:17:42] see if she dances they're led by some
[1:17:46] woman which who must be call herself a
[1:17:49] prophetess like Jezebel but I believe
[1:17:52] this is one that's even most close to be
[1:17:54] fulfilled because and they all smoke and
[1:17:59] they all cuss and drink and they all
[1:18:00] live like the world and claim to be
[1:18:02] Christians now we try to be nice to them
[1:18:04] right we try to be nice to them but if
[1:18:06] they ever came here
[1:18:07] they're gonna hear us say at the Lord
[1:18:09] because we're not the judge and you know
[1:18:11] we're not we're not gods
[1:18:14] we're not we're not God we can't storm
[1:18:16] out we don't know who's gonna be saving
[1:18:17] who's now so we just talk real nice
[1:18:19] about Jesus we tell him how much we love
[1:18:21] that's her brother and said he said
[1:18:22] don't make yourself out to be a
[1:18:23] Christian
[1:18:24] just tell everybody how much you love
[1:18:26] Jesus amen hallelujah and if there's any
[1:18:29] seed in them if there's any desire then
[1:18:31] they'll see you're a real Christian and
[1:18:33] they'll want to be like you that's right
[1:18:37] all right okay twenty minutes okay all
[1:18:42] right now let me uh I'm gonna go through
[1:18:45] these quickly but the RAM said about
[1:18:47] United States there's numerous thus
[1:18:49] saith the Lord's brother branham said
[1:18:56] hey Lord in 1956 she made her fatal move
[1:19:01] but man said Los Angeles will go beneath
[1:19:04] the ocean thus saith the lord it will
[1:19:05] she's done she's washed she's finished
[1:19:08] what our I don't know when but it will
[1:19:10] be sunk right after that the earthquakes
[1:19:11] begin to jolt and bo-hee watch what the
[1:19:20] spirit following it there come a time in
[1:19:22] the name of the Lord that people will go
[1:19:24] completely insane the Bible says so
[1:19:27] they'll scream and holler great hideous
[1:19:29] things in their imaginary mind the
[1:19:31] radios and things our television
[1:19:33] programs are producing it there'll be
[1:19:35] such things as ants rise up on the earth
[1:19:37] now he's speaking of the this is the
[1:19:39] fifth trumpet I believe and there'll be
[1:19:42] high as 14 trees they're becoming a bird
[1:19:45] fly across the earth with wings four or
[1:19:47] five miles across and people will see
[1:19:49] them they'll scream and holler and cry
[1:19:51] for mercy
[1:19:52] but it'll be the plagues I'm sorry it's
[1:19:54] Revelation 15 and 16 wait till I
[1:19:57] preached on the plagues opening up so
[1:19:58] that's thus saith the Lord now we see
[1:20:00] the insanely happening already right
[1:20:03] many people insane in fact the Bible
[1:20:05] says if you accept homosexuality the
[1:20:08] Bible says you're already insane it's
[1:20:10] already says you've got a reprobate mind
[1:20:12] there were already see how Loren day go
[1:20:15] I hate to call names whatever I see how
[1:20:16] Loren day go said last week or a couple
[1:20:18] weeks ago well the answer is
[1:20:19] homosexuality wrong she says I don't
[1:20:21] know I don't think so she said I'm not
[1:20:23] God Church she's borderline insane when
[1:20:28] you get to the spot where you can say
[1:20:29] God says Sodom God condemns Sodom and
[1:20:32] Gomorrah over fifty times in the Bible
[1:20:35] and the New Testament and the Bible says
[1:20:37] five times plainly that homosexuality is
[1:20:40] wrong in the New Testament and if you're
[1:20:42] to the spot where you saying well I
[1:20:43] don't know I don't know you are almost
[1:20:45] insane and you've almost crossed the
[1:20:49] line between mercy and judgment almost
[1:20:51] because most people that go on that side
[1:20:54] they never come back why because the
[1:20:56] Bible said God gave them over to a
[1:20:58] reprobate mind a reprobate means
[1:21:01] rejected they're rejected and I heard
[1:21:04] people say well you know Lauren that's
[1:21:05] okay Lauren dayyou'll said that you know
[1:21:07] these celebrities get up there and say
[1:21:08] she's done more for Jesus then you'll do
[1:21:11] in 50 lifetimes and I said nonsense just
[1:21:13] because somebody seems a nice song
[1:21:15] doesn't mean you've done more for Jesus
[1:21:17] you've only done more for Jesus when
[1:21:19] you've done his will which is his word
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:22] I don't know if you saw it I did repent
[1:21:25] to God because I watched a youtube video
[1:21:27] of her on a late-night show but she goes
[1:21:29] out there and she almost exposes all of
[1:21:31] her chest on there I say God forgive me
[1:21:33] always like that forgive me I don't I
[1:21:36] won't watch that again now that proves
[1:21:38] Church that that woman is getting close
[1:21:40] to crossing the line between mercy and
[1:21:42] judgment accepting homosexuality and
[1:21:46] then exposing yourself the Bible said a
[1:21:49] woman that will do that she wears the
[1:21:51] attire of a harlot and her heart is full
[1:21:54] of nets in other words she's trying to
[1:21:57] seduce men she's trying to drag men down
[1:21:59] to hell just like she's full of hell
[1:22:01] amen any woman that will take her shirt
[1:22:05] off or wear
[1:22:05] those yoga pants or whatever they're
[1:22:07] more strip herself off like that she's
[1:22:09] basically insane amen
[1:22:11] don't be fooled by that so we don't play
[1:22:14] her at our house anymore no more Lauren
[1:22:15] a go for us now I find people that do
[1:22:18] singer songs I'm not gonna play that
[1:22:20] woman she might be the witch I hate to
[1:22:22] say that but remember she's naked from
[1:22:26] the waist up and bromances like paper
[1:22:29] newspaper gray newspapers wrapped around
[1:22:31] her singing and dancing to rock and roll
[1:22:34] and smoking cigarettes oh we better be
[1:22:36] careful what we listen to any woman that
[1:22:43] exposed herself like that has done
[1:22:44] nothing for God because she's an object
[1:22:47] of lust is that right Church that's
[1:22:51] right the Bible said there's their dead
[1:22:53] while they're alive if they live in
[1:22:55] pleasure on this earth they're dead
[1:22:57] while they're alive oh did you know this
[1:23:02] - I hate to say more about this woman
[1:23:03] but she was recently invited because of
[1:23:06] her popularity for music this fall she
[1:23:07] was invited to a award ceremony for
[1:23:11] rappers and a rapper had wrote this evil
[1:23:15] song and got a word for it while he died
[1:23:17] in a gang shooting and she gave it she
[1:23:21] gave this award out and was clapping for
[1:23:23] this rapper and he was rapping about
[1:23:26] sexual immorality and all kind I went
[1:23:28] looked up the lyrics it was all
[1:23:29] customers it was all sexual and she's in
[1:23:32] there clapping and giving her there's
[1:23:34] this man's family members and award
[1:23:37] award do you think that person's going
[1:23:39] to get from God and hero someone who's
[1:23:41] claiming to be a Christian given award
[1:23:43] to someone who's taking people's souls
[1:23:45] to hell through rap music God won't give
[1:23:48] that a reward God will give that
[1:23:50] judgement amen
[1:23:51] I wasn't planning on preaching that so
[1:23:54] this is all coming fresh I'm acting
[1:24:00] insane
[1:24:01] he said it's thus saith the Lord they'll
[1:24:03] go insane what do we got today well
[1:24:09] that's that must been from God because I
[1:24:11] was not planning on saying that advance
[1:24:13] that's usually how I knows from God when
[1:24:15] I just feel to say something I wasn't
[1:24:17] planning on saying it well and said it
[1:24:20] in the name of the Lord he said there's
[1:24:22] a hydrogen bomb judgment is upon this
[1:24:25] nation she spurned God for her last
[1:24:27] there's no more hope there'll be a few
[1:24:29] stragglers coming to receive the Holy
[1:24:31] Spirit how was the meeting out of there
[1:24:33] yeah I was one of those truckers that
[1:24:35] came into the Holy Ghost right before
[1:24:37] this bomb falls on America oh I can see
[1:24:41] myself in that quote amen also those
[1:24:44] little stragglers right at the end
[1:24:46] praise the Lord right before the door
[1:24:48] closed oh my said by the america's
[1:24:57] judgment it close at hand mark that in
[1:24:59] your book and see if it comes to pass a
[1:25:02] hydrogen bomb heading this way thus
[1:25:04] saith the Lord Moran said so you just
[1:25:08] mark it down we're coming into a
[1:25:10] religious persecution with the same
[1:25:12] things they did in pagan Rome many years
[1:25:14] ago for it's thus saith the Lord so is
[1:25:18] there a persecution coming to America
[1:25:19] yes the Bible the details in Revelation
[1:25:22] 13 it's thus saith the Lord it's coming
[1:25:27] remember thus saith the Lord there will
[1:25:29] be a woman rule before the end time
[1:25:31] should either be a president vice
[1:25:33] president or it'll be the Catholic
[1:25:35] Church as a woman I've seen her a great
[1:25:38] woman the nation bowed to her it'll be
[1:25:40] one before the end time thus saith the
[1:25:42] Lord we don't know it's a it's
[1:25:45] either president vice president or the
[1:25:47] Roman Catholic Church
[1:25:48] we don't know I really thought it was
[1:25:50] Hillary but boy I was wrong on that one
[1:25:53] now here's what other half says now
[1:25:56] there he says many of you are looking
[1:25:58] for great growth and outpouring things
[1:26:00] just remember marketing your Bibles
[1:26:02] you'll not see it that's the sin it the
[1:26:03] Lord you'll not see it this nation is
[1:26:06] not going to have a great outpouring and
[1:26:07] great revival and all these things like
[1:26:09] that it's thus saith the Lord now
[1:26:12] brother man
[1:26:13] he says now seven major visions he says
[1:26:16] there were seven things smoke of what
[1:26:18] would happen it'll be that way that's in
[1:26:21] the name of the Lord it shall be that
[1:26:23] way the seven major visions it'll be
[1:26:26] that way
[1:26:27] thus saith the Lord but the RAM says
[1:26:33] I've got thus saith the Lord he said
[1:26:34] about the seven major visions he said
[1:26:37] she'll continue to strip herself he said
[1:26:39] they'll just be a little tiny group with
[1:26:41] a very elected that's predestination
[1:26:43] he said predestinated will escape that a
[1:26:46] man on an area so she's going to
[1:26:50] continue the women of this world are
[1:26:52] gonna continue to strip themselves so
[1:26:54] sisters continue to cover yourselves
[1:26:57] they're gonna continue strip more strip
[1:27:00] more strip we just more cover more cover
[1:27:02] more holy more pleasing to God it's a
[1:27:06] good sign that you're close to God when
[1:27:08] you're not stripping yourself if you can
[1:27:09] look in the picture five years ago and
[1:27:11] you got more clothes on or the same
[1:27:13] amount of clothes on you can say praise
[1:27:14] the Lord
[1:27:15] hey hallelujah because they're gonna
[1:27:19] keep taking off more and how many of
[1:27:21] these grandmother's do you think ever
[1:27:24] thought they wear yoga pants or leggings
[1:27:29] who ever thought a grandma would wear
[1:27:33] yoga pants and show off what's left of
[1:27:36] her body can I say like that who ever
[1:27:39] thought I never thought I'd see that in
[1:27:41] my lifetime but yet when I go to the rec
[1:27:43] center I see it I go in there to do my
[1:27:46] exercise in my modest clothes to do
[1:27:48] Taekwondo and I see grandma's walking
[1:27:50] out and they got those pants on what are
[1:27:54] you doing and I got all painted up and
[1:27:58] haircut and and also you know I'll just
[1:28:01] swagger it or whatever who would've
[1:28:04] thought that same could convince seventy
[1:28:07] year old women to wear yoga pants and
[1:28:12] try to be sexy at the age of 70 what a
[1:28:15] shame it shows you the spirit it's a
[1:28:20] spirit
[1:28:24] but ma'am says thus saith the Lord he
[1:28:26] said he said out here he said he says
[1:28:28] they don't know what decency means
[1:28:30] little old tight dresses on and things
[1:28:32] like that a man lusting after than our
[1:28:34] sisters we got to be careful we don't
[1:28:35] wear tight dresses right sisters he says
[1:28:40] and things like that men lusting after
[1:28:42] them and think they're decent you might
[1:28:44] not have done wrong sister but let me
[1:28:46] tell you something you're two of the
[1:28:47] devil so with a tight dress on it's a
[1:28:50] two of the devil and at the judgment bar
[1:28:52] they'll say if the Lord your answer for
[1:28:55] committing adultery and your soul will
[1:28:57] be gone can you imagine how much grace
[1:29:00] God is gonna have to have upon all of
[1:29:01] our Christian friends especially the
[1:29:03] women that wear tight dresses and short
[1:29:05] shorts and those yoga pants can you
[1:29:08] imagine man said thus saith the Lord
[1:29:10] you'll answer the judgment bar it's thus
[1:29:12] saith the Lord they will answer at the
[1:29:15] judgment bar as having a spirit of a
[1:29:17] prostitute
[1:29:18] can you imagine the grace God is gonna
[1:29:20] have to have on them in order for them
[1:29:22] to be saved and what is the grace the
[1:29:26] grace is when you've done it to one of
[1:29:27] the least of these my brethren you've
[1:29:29] done it unto me that's the only grace
[1:29:31] that's only hope they have for grace
[1:29:34] that's thus saith the Lord I have to
[1:29:38] wonder was that brother Branham was that
[1:29:40] is that somebody else that's God he said
[1:29:44] that's how you know it'll speak it it'll
[1:29:46] say thus saith the Lord
[1:29:50] alright got about 12 minutes here let me
[1:29:52] try to finish this up here by God's
[1:29:54] grace probably got three or four I guess
[1:29:59] said there's three thousand four hundred
[1:30:00] quotes if I just pulled out the ones
[1:30:02] that were very important for us here
[1:30:11] let's see
[1:30:12] I got doctrine ones I got mark of the
[1:30:15] beast thus saith the Lord what can I do
[1:30:17] in 12 minutes
[1:30:20] let's see got the revival
[1:30:29] okay let me let let me close with these
[1:30:38] few things here yeah let me do these go
[1:30:41] in your Bible you got your Bibles go to
[1:30:42] Revelation 13 revelation 13:16 Simon
[1:30:48] said he mentioned the squeeze again so
[1:30:50] let me just go back we have two
[1:30:51] scriptures at least that prove that
[1:30:53] there's gonna come a rush the oyster
[1:30:58] let me just rehearse those and I want to
[1:31:00] read another one more quote Revelation
[1:31:05] 3:16 I'll try 13 16 forgive me let me
[1:31:16] read it and he that's the Antichrist and
[1:31:20] he causes all both small and great rich
[1:31:23] and poor free and bond to receive a mark
[1:31:25] in their right hand or in their
[1:31:27] foreheads a church don't let this
[1:31:30] booming economy deceive you
[1:31:33] we are still 20 trillion dollars in debt
[1:31:38] and the church said did you see today
[1:31:41] they have the biggest jump ever on the
[1:31:43] stock market they had a huge that an
[1:31:44] awful plunge the day before Christmas on
[1:31:47] Christmas Eve and not today that the
[1:31:49] biggest jump don't let any economists or
[1:31:52] any political figure deceive you this
[1:31:57] nation is in trouble because of our debt
[1:32:00] I don't care how rich people are getting
[1:32:03] I don't know if you're getting rich or
[1:32:05] not I'm really not I haven't seen it
[1:32:09] it's probably for the stock market
[1:32:12] people the big business people
[1:32:14] I'm thankful though I mean haven't had
[1:32:16] many more new taxes I'm thankful for
[1:32:18] that but don't be deceived here this
[1:32:22] nation is still gonna have to sell out
[1:32:24] its twenty trillion dollars in debt and
[1:32:27] the spending bills they say well then
[1:32:30] they didn't know of course the President
[1:32:32] signed the last one which I don't blame
[1:32:33] him I kind of want the wall to if we're
[1:32:34] gonna be here but
[1:32:38] but the reality of it is over this year
[1:32:40] they've signed all these different bills
[1:32:42] they keep spending more than they bring
[1:32:45] in it's never they're gonna keep they
[1:32:48] all say they're stop kicking the can
[1:32:49] down the road but they're all just
[1:32:51] kicking it down the road they're just
[1:32:54] kicking it down the road why because
[1:32:56] they have to go that way because they
[1:32:58] have to sell out and somebody's got to
[1:33:01] bail them out they're kind old priests
[1:33:03] is going to bail them out the Pope
[1:33:07] because that's what prophecy says kind
[1:33:11] old priests got to bail them out
[1:33:12] did you see which have to look it up I
[1:33:14] saved I say the article one of these
[1:33:17] nations that produces all this gold I
[1:33:19] think it was Venezuela did you see that
[1:33:21] last week or couple weeks ago Venezuela
[1:33:24] when to get all their gold and cash in
[1:33:28] for their bonds because they're one of
[1:33:29] the biggest producers of gold and I
[1:33:32] think it was like 55 billion dollars
[1:33:34] because all the gold that back that
[1:33:37] money was in Europe somewhere I think it
[1:33:39] was break Britain and they're demanding
[1:33:41] they want their gold for these bonds
[1:33:45] well that's what it's going to come down
[1:33:47] to but answer they're gonna call the
[1:33:49] bonds they're gonna call the bonds in
[1:33:50] theirs and there's got to be something
[1:33:52] to back it so it looked like Venezuela
[1:33:55] was kind of catching that little it gets
[1:33:57] a little wisdom beforehand to get the
[1:33:58] gold I don't know we don't know the day
[1:34:01] or the hour but I thought that's
[1:34:02] interesting why would the nation all of
[1:34:04] a sudden want their gold and cash and
[1:34:06] all this paper bonds interesting now
[1:34:10] brother branham reads this scripture and
[1:34:12] he says this and pick up your pen and
[1:34:14] write this is his quote now he said I
[1:34:16] never wrote this the Spirit of God wrote
[1:34:18] this I believe someday the real Bride of
[1:34:22] Christ will be forced to stop preaching
[1:34:23] the Word of God the Bible prophesies it
[1:34:26] in revelation 13:16 so this is prophecy
[1:34:31] that you and I will have to stop coming
[1:34:33] to churches that our church that
[1:34:35] preaches the real gospel truth if it's
[1:34:37] in our data if it's in our lifetime he
[1:34:40] says if you want to put it down did Hama
[1:34:42] nations will force it to stop or take
[1:34:44] its mark
[1:34:45] then when the lamb the lamb will take
[1:34:48] his bride and judge the for this
[1:34:50] so this is an evil thing that the
[1:34:53] is going to bring down you got to take a
[1:34:57] marker we're controlling your money and
[1:34:59] brother BAM said Jesus gonna destroy the
[1:35:01] for doing this all right so we got
[1:35:08] scripture for do we not we got scripture
[1:35:10] we have scripture for the squeeze well
[1:35:12] Graham said they're gonna force the
[1:35:14] bride of Jesus Christ that's not
[1:35:15] preaching the Word of God all right go
[1:35:19] to Revelation 3:10 this is our second
[1:35:21] scripture saw Church I believe it is
[1:35:25] scriptural that the Bride of Christ will
[1:35:27] go through some small little minor
[1:35:29] persecution or squeeze because that's
[1:35:32] what that's what the Prophet said when
[1:35:33] he said this holy spirit told me to pick
[1:35:35] up my pen and write he said it was a
[1:35:37] message for the bride with the word
[1:35:43] revelation 3:10 because thou has kept
[1:35:46] the word of my patience I will also keep
[1:35:48] thee from the hour temptation which
[1:35:49] would come upon all the world to try
[1:35:51] them that dwell upon the earth brother
[1:35:58] Branham says that will come as follows
[1:35:59] the Academical move that has started on
[1:36:02] what seems such a beautiful and blessed
[1:36:04] principle fulfilling Christ prayer that
[1:36:06] we all might be one become so strong
[1:36:08] politically that she bears pressure upon
[1:36:10] the government to cause all to join with
[1:36:12] her either directly or through adherence
[1:36:14] to principles and acted into law so that
[1:36:17] no people will be recognized as actual
[1:36:19] churches unless under direct or indirect
[1:36:23] then I'm sorry domination of this
[1:36:25] council as this pressure increases so
[1:36:30] it's going to get greater and it will it
[1:36:32] will be harder to resist for to resist
[1:36:34] is to lose privilege and so many will be
[1:36:37] tempted to go along for they will feel
[1:36:39] it is better to serve God publicly in
[1:36:41] the framework of this organization then
[1:36:43] not to serve God at all publicly but
[1:36:45] they err to believe the devil's lie is
[1:36:48] to serve Satan even though you may want
[1:36:50] to calm Java 9 black will not be
[1:36:55] deceived we're not gonna be to see by
[1:36:58] churches that are trying to pressure us
[1:37:00] into joining some council
[1:37:03] I could be pressured into that if we
[1:37:06] live to see it
[1:37:09] he says the church system of the Roman
[1:37:11] Catholic Church in the Protestant is
[1:37:13] coming together will control the whole
[1:37:15] wealth of the world system and force the
[1:37:17] whole world into its religious trap or
[1:37:19] will kill them by refusing them the
[1:37:21] privilege of buying and selling whereby
[1:37:23] that would may they would make a living
[1:37:27] he says with no gold the system fails or
[1:37:31] Falls the Jews will be trapped and come
[1:37:34] into alliance and the harlot Church will
[1:37:36] take over the world how many believe
[1:37:39] that I believe that praise God let me
[1:37:42] see if I can poop that Mena's whaler
[1:37:43] quote real quick I think I can do it
[1:37:45] then is yeah there it is
[1:37:47] here it is yeah it's from the business
[1:37:49] insider Venezuela is coming again it's

[1:37:54] England they want their gold and this
[1:37:58] was this was December 7th this year and
[1:38:02] Venezuela is one of the biggest
[1:38:03] producers of gold in the world and
[1:38:06] they're saying well we want our gold
[1:38:07] back the Bank of England's like what was
[1:38:09] it you just take your paper and he's
[1:38:11] like no we want the gold but ramesses
[1:38:14] without gold the system Falls the Jews
[1:38:18] will be trapped and coming to the Lions
[1:38:19] and the harlot Church will take over the
[1:38:21] whole world because it's got to come
[1:38:24] back to gold oh don't you see Church
[1:38:27] you're either gonna take natural gold or
[1:38:30] spirit so go there to see they want the
[1:38:35] natural gold but we want the spiritual
[1:38:37] goat we want the Holy Ghost amen
[1:38:39] hallelujah we want God's real deity in
[1:38:43] our myths we want to see the Holy Ghost
[1:38:46] win souls bring sinners to repentance
[1:38:48] heal the sick how do you you that's the
[1:38:51] gold we're concerned about but they're
[1:38:55] after natural gold we want the spiritual
[1:38:57] gold hallelujah let's stay on our feet
[1:39:01] here by God's grace I'm closing with
[1:39:03] this well this might seem a little
[1:39:05] different I'm going to close to this it
[1:39:07] kind of goes back to this move around
[1:39:09] Jeffersonville this is not the stay at
[1:39:12] the Lord but I just want to do this I
[1:39:14] want to say this Paul
[1:39:16] warned them the Ephesians to say what he
[1:39:20] said even as Peter did likewise he
[1:39:24] warned them that even he could not
[1:39:26] change one word of what he had been
[1:39:28] given by revelation I mean oh let it's
[1:39:31] Galatians chapter 1 let me read it to
[1:39:32] you Paul warned everyone and said if you
[1:39:38] change one word you're cursed but though
[1:39:50] we that includes Paul though we or an
[1:39:53] angel from heaven preach any other
[1:39:55] gospel unto you than that which that we
[1:39:57] have preached unto you let him be
[1:39:59] accursed as we said before so say I now
[1:40:03] again if any man preach any other gospel
[1:40:05] unto you then that you have received let
[1:40:10] him be accursed for do I now persuade
[1:40:14] men or God or do I seek to please men
[1:40:16] for if yet I please men I should not be
[1:40:19] the servant of Christ hate to say church
[1:40:23] but I'm not here to please you neither
[1:40:25] are you here to please me although I
[1:40:28] want to make you happy I want to serve I
[1:40:30] want to serve you I want to help you
[1:40:31] guys out there how about all the church
[1:40:32] if I can but really I'm not here really
[1:40:35] to serve your desires I'm here to serve
[1:40:38] Christ desires and that's what Paul said
[1:40:42] anyone who tries to change the message
[1:40:45] the Lord's message because his aim
[1:40:47] brother branham's really it's really
[1:40:48] God's
[1:40:49] he's the messenger of the Lord's message
[1:40:52] how many remember we read read that
[1:40:53] tonight brother man said I may not do it
[1:40:56] but this message will introduce Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ to the world amen hallelujah I
[1:41:02] love that quote romance says Paul warned
[1:41:08] them that even if he could not change
[1:41:11] one word it would have been given by
[1:41:12] revelation oh how important is to hear
[1:41:14] the voice of God by the way of his
[1:41:18] messengers and then say what has been
[1:41:20] given them to say to the churches
[1:41:28] but false apostles come with their own
[1:41:31] word those Ephesians knew that the words
[1:41:34] that Pau thought they were full of the
[1:41:36] Holy Ghost by laying on Paul's hands
[1:41:38] they look those false apostles in the
[1:41:41] eye and said you're not saying what Paul
[1:41:43] said you are therefore false oh that
[1:41:49] sets my heart on fire get back to the
[1:41:52] word it is not you that really tries the
[1:41:59] Apostle and the prophet and the teacher
[1:42:00] it is the word that tries them one of
[1:42:03] these days there's going to come a
[1:42:04] prophet he says to the latest scene in
[1:42:07] church age and you will know he's the
[1:42:08] real one sent from God or not yes you
[1:42:11] will
[1:42:12] for he is of God he will be in that word
[1:42:16] exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't
[1:42:18] deviate from that word for one moment
[1:42:21] not by one iota how do we know brother
[1:42:25] Ryan was a prophet well he has
[1:42:26] prophecies that came to pass but also he
[1:42:29] didn't change one word in this holy
[1:42:32] blessed book that's either what I told
[1:42:36] you I'm closing with this the tape
[1:42:37] ministry movement of just play tapes
[1:42:39] just my tapes what does it do it it
[1:42:41] changes one word now pastors aren't
[1:42:44] needed to preach now evangelists aren't
[1:42:46] needed to preach you just need brother
[1:42:48] Branham to preach that change is what
[1:42:51] Paul said because Paul said when you
[1:42:53] have five ministry perfects the body of
[1:42:56] Christ does ever understand that's why
[1:43:01] it's so important not to change one
[1:43:03] thing that the Apostle Paul said not one
[1:43:07] now we're willing sunday will show all
[1:43:09] the other the state the Lord's I didn't
[1:43:10] get like it halfway through all those
[1:43:12] let's say the Lord's the church have you
[1:43:15] been blessed tonight by thus saith the
[1:43:16] Lord now you heard things I wasn't
[1:43:19] playing on I wasn't playing on the gold
[1:43:21] I wasn't playing on Lauren Daigle but I
[1:43:23] just said it I just felt like God wanted
[1:43:25] to bring that out so I just let it go by
[1:43:30] the grace of the Lord and we should be
[1:43:33] mature enough Church we should be
[1:43:35] spiritual enough to recognize demon
[1:43:37] spirits in fact that's when you now
[1:43:39] being winning invincible
[1:43:41] when we can recognize the two spirits in
[1:43:43] the framework of the church and then
[1:43:46] withstand them amen
[1:43:48] and do not not do not accept them but
[1:43:51] withstand the demon spirits and cast
[1:43:53] them out in Jesus Christ name
[1:43:56] praise God Brooke now Kai won't you come
[1:44:00] mmm bringing I'm going back to those
[1:44:02] quotes about prayer let me close with
[1:44:05] this I want to buy everybody last year
[1:44:07] Christmas time or I invite everybody to
[1:44:09] come before service to pray early I want
[1:44:10] to invite the church again if you can if
[1:44:14] you can come early to pray before
[1:44:15] service I really appreciate that
[1:44:16] I didn't get the time today that was my
[1:44:18] fault I didn't get here early enough I
[1:44:21] was trying to get some errands done I
[1:44:23] lost track of time
[1:44:24] so forgive me for that but I got there
[1:44:27] on Sunday at cam Church I was there half
[1:44:29] an hour early praying so I believe that
[1:44:32] I believe these quotes if you believe
[1:44:34] these quotes are for thus saith the Lord
[1:44:35] for brother Branham
[1:44:36] if you are revival he said throw
[1:44:40] everything you've got into prayer and
[1:44:42] seek God's face and call on God's mercy
[1:44:48] in the night time is it night tonight
[1:44:51] Church can we cry out to God in the
[1:44:55] night time hallelujah I just think
[1:45:01] that's such a beautiful quote he says
[1:45:05] friends will never have a revival until
[1:45:07] that takes place
[1:45:08] there'll be no revival in our lives
[1:45:12] there'll be no a revival in the church
[1:45:15] he says until that takes place when you
[1:45:19] throw everything you got into praying
[1:45:21] everything you got into crying out to
[1:45:24] God for something that's what a revival
[1:45:26] happens and that's not thus saith
[1:45:31] William Branham that's thus saith the
[1:45:32] Lord praise God let me go back to the
[1:45:40] other one that talked : brother sister
[1:45:45] you remember that saith the Lord the
[1:45:47] church better clean up you're drifting
[1:45:48] too far come back to the Lord come back
[1:45:50] to real prayer meetings real prayer
[1:45:56] meetings now the dangerous thing
[1:45:59] churches that make it about well the
[1:46:02] dangerous thing to say well we have to
[1:46:03] pray all night in order for God that you
[1:46:05] know in order to have a real prayer
[1:46:06] meeting that's not always true that's
[1:46:09] not always true if it takes like bodiham
[1:46:14] said if it takes you all night to die
[1:46:15] out then you better pray all night
[1:46:18] however long it takes you to die out
[1:46:20] that's how long you pray but this is how
[1:46:28] revival comes to us save the Lord
[1:46:31] we have aren't you glad for thus saith
[1:46:34] the Lord church that just means that all
[1:46:37] the free time I can't stop taking care
[1:46:39] of my children I got it I got how many
[1:46:41] times a day that I run them to the
[1:46:42] restroom especially Victoria I can't
[1:46:45] just say well no I gotta pray you just
[1:46:47] let nature take its course
[1:46:49] can't do that but in all those free
[1:46:53] moments all those little times you can
[1:46:54] just pray in your heart crowd to God can
[1:46:59] we just do that can we just pray for a
[1:47:00] few moments together Church I'm in my
[1:47:11] heart I'm just trembling now because
[1:47:12] this is the safe alone just trembling in
[1:47:16] my heart and you know I'm trembling
[1:47:20] because I know when I had to revival my
[1:47:22] life this is how I lived and I'm a man
[1:47:25] and I get busy I get into other things
[1:47:28] too but I know in my heart I want a
[1:47:32] revival sometimes I'm they want a
[1:47:34] revival sometime I didn't say today I
[1:47:36] said some time now be good time to raise
[1:47:38] your hand to be a good time to raise
[1:47:41] your head man I tremble at this the
[1:47:44] saying the lord I tremble at it
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:48] and that's how you know Church you got
[1:47:50] the fear of the Lord when you can
[1:47:51] tremble when the state the Lord it
[1:47:53] shakes you ago god I wonder if I want my
[1:47:57] neighbor to be saved glory
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:02] I want to see people in the church
[1:48:05] filled with the Holy Ghost if they're
[1:48:06] not filled fill them put them into
[1:48:08] service let's just have a time of Prayer
[1:48:13] can we just if you want to just raise
[1:48:14] your hands or if you just want to bow
[1:48:16] your head let's just have a word of
[1:48:17] Prayer here Heavenly Father I thank you
[1:48:21] for thus saith the Lord how they loo you
[1:48:24] Jesus Lord of my heart I'm trembling
[1:48:27] Lord because I see what your prophet
[1:48:29] said fake Christians just what they just
[1:48:36] want to look be in a church but they
[1:48:39] won't tremble thus saith the Lord the
[1:48:41] Lord we want to be real Christians
[1:48:43] hallelujah that tremble at the saith the
[1:48:46] Lord we would have been gee I need your
[1:48:57] mercy and forgiveness Lord at some point
[1:49:02] we all want a real revival and Lord
[1:49:06] you've told us not a suggestion on how
[1:49:09] to do it you told us thus saith the Lord
[1:49:10] how to do it dig out everything cut down
[1:49:13] anything seek the face of God call out
[1:49:17] to God in the night times cut the God in
[1:49:21] the morning card to God all day how they
[1:49:26] loo you Jesus hallelujah Jesus nor do
[1:49:31] you know I never preaches anywhere
[1:49:32] because I knew it was so crucial for our
[1:49:34] church it's crucial for every Christian
[1:49:37] my lord is machine for this little
[1:49:40] church that you may be pastor of Lord
[1:49:42] and I love so much they love me and such
[1:49:46] a special gathering that we have Lord
[1:49:48] every time we're gathered how I love
[1:49:52] these people and all they love me dear
[1:49:54] God
[1:49:55] they're your people Lord God and we're
[1:49:59] gonna stand together in judgment one day
[1:50:01] Lord and we want to be able to answer
[1:50:03] and give it a count of our lives with
[1:50:05] joy that we followed thus saith the Lord
[1:50:15] so father with that thought of mine I
[1:50:17] just pray right now Lord I see I know
[1:50:19] other people are praying to Lord John we
[1:50:24] just asked Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[1:50:26] Lord God you'd guide us to little
[1:50:28] revivals in our life and I say little
[1:50:31] because Lord we know it won't be
[1:50:32] something great like a nationwide thing
[1:50:34] we know the nation's gone but Lord may
[1:50:37] you bring a little revival in our lives
[1:50:39] in our church Lord God I imagine I guess
[1:50:42] you could bring a big one like happen in
[1:50:44] Lima but Lord we just ask that you to
[1:50:47] lead us into revival the Lord we know
[1:50:51] that would require sacrifice we know
[1:50:54] other things and other projects in our
[1:50:56] lives are gonna have to be put on the
[1:50:57] back burner because it's thus saith the
[1:51:00] Lord because it's the Word of God that
[1:51:03] says when you seek me with all your
[1:51:05] heart you'll find me babe oh thank you
[1:51:11] Jesus I troubled the how the Lord God at
[1:51:13] that scripture Lord in the context it
[1:51:18] was at the end of 70 years that the
[1:51:20] people started trembling at the words of
[1:51:21] Jeremiah
[1:51:22] and they started laying aside things in
[1:51:24] their lives they said prayers more
[1:51:26] important Oh God
[1:51:28] Lauren I'm a failure I'll be the first
[1:51:31] to admit I'm a failure many times of
[1:51:34] course I did pray today and I was in the
[1:51:36] closet praying Lord father many times
[1:51:39] I'm a failure Lord and I'm ashamed of
[1:51:42] that
[1:51:44] and I just pray God you lead me to
[1:51:47] revival you lead all of us to revival we
[1:51:51] know we're not lost
[1:51:52] but Lord we just want to be closer to
[1:51:54] you dear God we want to tremble when we
[1:51:58] hear a preacher say thus saith the
[1:52:03] father will be rarely anything from our
[1:52:06] own thoughts it'll always be from
[1:52:08] brother branham's your prophets thoughts
[1:52:11] opposite tremble either way dear God the
[1:52:15] Lord I trouble here tonight to your
[1:52:16] conscience I'd repeat but I pray that
[1:52:19] the Lord will have a burden for our
[1:52:21] neighbors Lord God give us a burden for
[1:52:24] our family we cried to God tonight
[1:52:26] Allu you with tears Lord God with
[1:52:32] sincere hearts we cry out Lord Jesus
[1:52:35] save them save our loved ones we cry out
[1:52:42] Jesus save them Lord use us Lord God to
[1:52:48] save souls bring revival Lord God we
[1:52:53] crowd tonight may the crying out
[1:52:55] continue tonight when we get home save
[1:53:00] my neighbors Lord dear God especially my
[1:53:03] atheist neighbor Lord I won't talk about
[1:53:05] it open his heart Lord open his life's
[1:53:08] heart and they'll want to talk about
[1:53:09] Jesus Lord God
[1:53:13] granted dear Lord Jesus Oh God
[1:53:19] it was a real prayer meeting Lord God
[1:53:21] before church after church Lord God
[1:53:26] hallelujah heal the sick Lord God fill
[1:53:32] those that are hungry for the Holy Ghost
[1:53:33] dear Jesus think of my children Lord may
[1:53:38] they be filled with the Holy Ghost dear
[1:53:40] God
[1:53:42] hallelujah hallelujah give each person a
[1:53:46] revival in their hearts dear God Nord if
[1:53:52] you do we know what we'll have to do
[1:53:55] we'll have to seek you with all of our
[1:53:57] hearts so that's what Jeremiah 29 says
[1:54:03] granted Jesus we tremble it thus saith
[1:54:05] the Lord and yet it's our foundation as
[1:54:09] well
[1:54:11] it's what the church is built upon thus
[1:54:13] saith the Lord
[1:54:15] thank you lord thank you for your word
[1:54:19] heavenly father I feel so close to you
[1:54:21] all nights like this dear God help us to
[1:54:25] keep just a real reverent atmosphere
[1:54:26] here Lord God Jesus will give you all
[1:54:31] the honor and all the praise in Jesus
[1:54:36] Christ's holy name the church said let's
[1:54:39] give the Lord I'm applause amen thank
[1:54:41] you lord
[1:54:41] thank you for that saith the Lord
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:48] remember church that Jeremiah said when
