========================================

relied by God's grace and live streamers if you're from our church we'll have communion Lord willing on Sunday I'm not sure if it'll be amen I say Amen am or p.m I'm sure amen will be there by God's grace so a part of me a little tired today I got up you know I tried to go to bed early and then I just wake up early so I woke up at like 4 50 this morning couldn't go back to bed but we're making it by God's grace it's going to be a good good service here so we're looking at our sermon title as fighting multiple enemies our text was with Jehoshaphat I want to read a little bit on the background here John Gill uh the preacher from the 1800s says this he says Jehoshaphat having notice of a numerous Army coming against him he takes himself to fasting in prayer with his people so I'll get to more on John Gill's statements later on but we see the background is with King Jehoshaphat he's the Israelite King one of the few good Kings of Israel right because most were not good Kings there were no good Kings of Northern Israel the only good kings were from Judah and Jehoshaphat was one of those Judah Kings we'd say now church if you read there in the scripture there's at least three groups that come against him now imagine you just don't have to fight one enemy not just two but three or maybe more some commentaries think more now you think one would be enough right oh my here's War again right Another War another battle it's kind of like uh we get we we get uh to a spot in our lives we feel relaxed we feel Victory we feel like we're on the Mountaintop and here comes another battle but like brother Brandon and I we talked about we you've heard it uh said it before we're either in a battle coming out of the battle or coming to a battle right it's one of those so wherever you find yourself you know be encouraged you know Israel found them spot themselves in a spot they were having peace but then enemies invaded them and sea church that's sometimes how we'll we'll go through our lives you know we'll be doing everything right and then the enemy will attack us it'll be like Joe right job is doing everything right he was praying for his children he was making sacrifices for the children praise God he was given wise words to all those that would come and sit at his feet he was helping the widows he was helping the poor he was helping he was helping everybody helping the fatherless but then God was bragging on job in heaven and he didn't know it praise God right if he had known that that probably would have helped him in his battle but God knows what we can handle he won't give us nothing that we can't handle praise God Amen but there he finds himself on multiple battles his family right his money and then his health so three areas and then his relationship his wife right even his wife imagine losing all your money imagine losing uh your children or I mean just this was these would be some of the most terrible enemies you could ever face spiritually right right or naturally or a combination but job is able to fight Hallelujah and we know how he gets Victory praise God hallelujah he gets Victory by not quitting amen amen amen he gets Victory by not cursing God hallelujah he gets Victory by we'd say toughing it out right just getting to just get through it praise God just keep asking call upon God I love it God even in the midst of his suffering God will send Revelation certain Revelation here he says I know my redeemer liveth praise God and I'll stand with him all day on the earth praise God Hallelujah in this body I'll see God hallelujah and God keeps him encouraged and I love it he cries out to God he said I just wish I could talk to God face to face then God comes down and talks to him praise God in a whirlwind and so we see we we see uh some of these keys to Victory when you're fighting all these battles cry out to God don't quit all right just continue in the faith try to stay positive amen right we saw with Joe I preached on that a couple years ago he went from negative to positive negative to positive finally he got on the positive Hallelujah yeah yeah trust God give God praise in the midst of the trial but here Joseph and Israel gets attacked they get invaded by at least three armies right I thought about that too you know we battled the lust of the eyes of pride of life lust of the flesh it's a great it's a great uh spiritual type for us Not only was it the moabites the ammonites John Gill right the syrians hired somebody to come and uh pay them back for what Israel did at Ramos Gilead now friends remember Moab and Ammon were descendants of lot right and what how did a lot have children remember that most of them died but he had children through his daughters the incest Acts or act and and luck with that you know look look what a compromising life allows look what it look what happens in a in a life of a compromiser like lot and yet the Bible said he was a judgment so we know he must have repented praise God yes right now I know we know his daughter's got him drunk and everything like that but still the fact that you'd get drunk right of course they didn't have the Holy Ghost like we got it today but look but look where it comes out it comes out of people that should have known right he knew the prophet's message lot knew the prophet Abraham praise God should have looked for the promised son but because he was a compromiser look at the fruits of his life It produced moabites and ammonites and it always comes back to hunt right well he's come back to hunt of course the Arabians there were uh heathens we'd say as far as We Know by the scripture and so he's not just attacked by one enemy not just two but three and so what does it drive a real believer to do go to church fast and pray amen the church said when you're facing trials on every side you got nowhere to turn because you're surrounded right it may look like I'm surrounded praise God right but I'm surrounded by Christ amen amen hallelujah so he's got one choice really the real believer only has one choice Run To God In Prayer right right Hallelujah that's what we've got to do I wanna I wanna now move to the New Testament and I'm going to end up closing with Jehoshaphat of course at the end I want to show how Saint Paul also fought multiple enemies okay this is because I just listened to the sermon present stage of my Ministry September 8 1962. if you want to know the day it was a powerful sermon I was really enjoying listening to that one I love hearing Brother Band talk about just his trials and the things he goes through and yet he still preaches the word of God all the rejection he faced but he still stayed true to God's word amen amen multiple fronts he had one group uh from Asia the Bible said all in Asia he said have rejected me so in almost an entire continent now I believe he was just being uh hyperbole there I'm sure there was a one or two Believers in Asia right he's probably using hyperbole I feel like everybody's rejecting me in Asia so he had a group that they just want nothing to do with him and no doubt you think they were talking good about Paul I think they're talking bad about Paul when was the last time somebody rejected you and would even text you back wouldn't even call you back all right that happened last year somebody in the message that I witnessed a message to I'm not gonna call names but you could probably figure it out I witness to message you I said you're wrong and he won't text me back anymore I said I kept texting won't text me back I said you're off the word of God and he's saying we're off the word of God well just battles we got to face on multiple fronts praise God we got to do that another uh battle he he fighted was the prosperity preachers in the message Paul said don't go to those preachers who suppose that gain is godliness that's a group he was fighting and no doubt they looked down on Paul because Paul only had one coat or sisters he only had one dress or one winter jacket we'd say maybe maybe you only had one pair of shoes look at our shoes down here he wasn't a rich creature the gospel didn't make him popular right now I can say Amen to that praise God not every preacher can say that in the message I can say Amen to that gospel has not made me popular now I understand there's big churches that are faithful and little churches so I'm not saying all big churches are wrong they can be right but in the life of Jesus and the life of Paul the brother random their filings got smaller as they grew in the word of God now Jesus of course grew the Bible said he grew in favor and knowledge as well the Bible said that and so he's fighting a battle there so he's rejected by Asia the prosperity message group saying well if you're not gaining you're not godly and I just heard brother Adam said Brother Robinson in 1962 he said you know the preachers out in California say if you don't have two Cadillacs you're not spiritual even in brother Adams day they were saying you've got to speak Cadillacs into existence how about we speak against the Temptation for a Cadillac right so in other words Satan get behind me I don't need your Cadillac I just need a car that runs now they brought an excessive God gives you Cadillac praise God right but you know you didn't speak them just speak for something just speak for what God promises it is where praise God amen praise God but that was already uh it was already a popular thing in brother random's day and then Paul said in the Corinthian Church some thought uh they wish they could have been baptized in Paul's name remember that Paul said I'm glad I baptized none of you because you would have said I baptized in my name so then we had Prophet worshipers as well there's another battle you got to face Prophet worshipers sound familiar right I'm gonna get this out of that a little bit by God's grace because I just want to show that these some of these battles I mean we're still about these same devils Prosperity message preach preachers that worship the prophet because Spirits never die thank God the holy spirit's Eternal praise God amen and then he's fighting on this front where people just forsake Him like demons Demas was with Paul for men numerous trips with him for a while but then Demas for succumb Paul said because he loved this present World more than Paul now what do we got we got message members like that they say they say they still love us but because they love the world they stopped coming to church right they don't have time for church anymore because they love this world so much so worldliness gets them right she got the prosperity the the prophet worshipers you got these guys you know they you got them on every side they just stopped coming they still say they're your brother but they love the world more than they love the message I want to read this quote from president Sage of my Ministry brother random said Paul with one quote one quote rather coat not one quote one quote he tells Timothy bring it to him because it's getting cold up there a man that had a Ministry that preached to tens of thousands that Paul did and in Ministry that could do all kinds of Miracles and seeing Jesus in a pillar of fire think of that Jesus commissioned him and yet owned one coat amen demon said or fell like that he'd turn away from him even if you see Jesus even if you have great testimonies that doesn't ensure you're going to have a lot of money because Paul knew Jesus in this in this sermon brother Ryan said Paul knew Jesus better than Matthew Mark Luke and he didn't say John he said Matthew Mark and Luke and he said what do you mean he says they got to walk with him right he said but Paul saw him afterwards and got a commission to write the Bible praise God yeah brother said Paul knew him better than the men that actually walked with him Hallelujah how's that working out for you Paul working out getting real wealthy getting real popular actually not so church I can't if I believe God's giving me more Revelation I can't expect to be more popular right we can't expect that because in the Bible looks like the more Revelation you get the more hated you are I can say Amen to that Hallelujah now Paul was up here preaching in troas we find out that a man was up there a coppersmith and he was a rascal and he hated Christianity and he'd done everything to Paul that he could do to him in the book of Acts and throw it had him thrown in jail and Paul even warns Timothy in the same thing watch that guy remember that in the scripture and here's Demas oh God let the people here here's the demon standing by a man that struck a man blind for disputing with him now you Church of Christ preachers put your coats on now he said I had one tell me one time smite me blind smite me blind you got the Holy Ghost brother random Smiley this might be blind and mother said how can I you're already blind right spiritually yeah think about that asking somebody to Smite you blind what kind of spirit would that be that's a devil challenging the real man of God now brother Adam says this now to show you the side that that Demas was on he remember battling on numerous fronts why didn't Paul Smite the coppersmith blind you know why Roman tells later because it wasn't God's will yeah you could only do what God's called you to do you can only do what the anointing that you have allows you to do and the church said church God when God wants you to do something he's going to send the anointing for you to do it and I believe like David if you missed the first time you get it right the second time he'll send it again praise God amen amen hallelujah that's what I believe with bring in the ark I believe God's a god of Second Chances he said that's the same kind of spirit that's on people that he said the same thing was on Demas a man that could Smite a man blind for disputing with him and then turn on a I'm sorry copper Smith spoil his ministry in the city no doubt demon said oh Paul's washed up he lost all of his gifts he lost his gift of smiting blind that's an interesting view that brother Adam gives because there was something that happened in Paul's Ministry that Paul that demon said I'm going to leave him the world looks more more uh appealing to me than Paul's Ministry because he stopped doing the Miracles now stopped right I'm sure he still had Miracles yeah right man said don't you see how that Spirit still lives today you're all washed up brother and brother is talking about himself preachers were telling brother Branham you're washed up because you don't have the big meetings like you did but that was so carnal it's not the size of your meetings it's the amount of truth that you have praise God because the Holy Ghost doesn't lead you into less truth it leads you into more truth praise God he said oh it just goes over the people's heads they just don't get it that's all there is to it they can't see it they don't understand so worldly message Believers think the size of the crowd is the most important thing yeah or the the money in the ministry is the most important thing don't get me wrong I wish we could build churches I mean some of these message churches have built hundreds of churches that's fantastic but the main thing is what do they do in that church now that they got it are they preaching the truth let's hope so or are some of those preachers trying to get rich off the money that they're given to them yeah yeah right in the other countries that's happened too now Demas he didn't Smite that man blind because he uh because he didn't want to didn't Jesus say I do nothing to the father shows me first and program said even when his own mother my own mother was died she would say Bill What's My outcome brother man said I couldn't say nothing until God said so first and that's just what happened man can't man is a failure to begin with he's only an Asian to which God works through and God works his own will but you see these now listen he says these super duper people that's always having this and that and the other you better stay away from it so brother Adam says any preacher who says I got every answer I've got a thus days Lord for everybody I got all the anointing to all these things but remember you better stay away from that because that doesn't match Paul's Ministry it doesn't match brother Adams Ministry now if somebody if a preacher has a gift and it's genuine gifts and God is giving them a season of lots of Miracles yes let's support that let's let's say Amen to that amen but brother is making the point every man of God doesn't have every answer and every miracle for every distressful situation like brother said I gotta sweat it out just like you've got to sweat it out Hallelujah Jesus himself didn't do that he said Jesus said I only work as the father Works he shows me what to do and then I go do it I can't do anything otherwise than that that's in the Book of John chapter 5 and John chapter 10. Jesus of course says the father is greater than I love this little me my God uh there's these trinitarians run into Jesus and they're saying Jesus uh you're equal to the father you're you're the second person the Trinity and Jesus says the father is greater than that how can I be co-equal with the father that's a good meme I like I like to share that with some trinitarians hallelujah it's because Jesus's body was not God it was a human body praise God Jesus body could die it could be tempted but God could never die and God can never be tempted praise God but the spirit that was in Jesus that was God hallelujah but that makes it sound like there's almost like two there's like a dual person brother random says but there's only one person right and George remember I I heard a preacher say this and I agree with it because I was just studying on it Jesus never said all power is given to me until after the resurrection did you notice that during his life he always had no it was Earthly life before he died you always had to wait on the father wait on the father he never said I have all power until after he was raised from the dead now why could he say it then because then he has a glorified body he has a perfect body right yeah it's never it's never going to go through Temptation it's never going to have to sweat it out and pray it out in the Garden of Gethsemane he's now perfected praise God and then he says in Matthew 28 9 28 19-20 all power is given to me in heaven and earth praise God Amen Hallelujah now he's got full power full Authority let me drop a little deeper Revelation on you here now Solomon said he said even the heaven of Heavens cannot contain you God Simon said how much less could this Temple that I built contain your spirit when the heaven of Heavens can't contain you so the point I'm trying to make is that all of God's spirit could not have dwelled in Jesus body but what does that mean the fullness of the godhead body that means God's full power and full authorities in that body because God's spirit cannot be contained in one body it's greater than the heavens of Heaven amen amen hallelujah that's a deeper thought there Hallelujah it's God's full power full Authority in the body of Jesus Christ and yes I agree with every scripture the fullness of the godhead bodily yes hallelujah amen full power full Authority but if if a temple can't contain God's spirit how much less a body of one person okay that's a little deeper thought there Hallelujah hope that doesn't choke anybody if so get some water that'll help help your choking there by God's grace then we can preach on that uh on Solomon's thought there and he said here Demas saw Paul a man that had a Ministry like that and yet was so poor he only owned one coat and wanted Timothy to bring it to him one coat but Paul set the example like Christ was he had one quote one quote keep saying quote then why does riches and lots of money and things mean so much to people today notice now and he had power till anything that was contrary to what he preached he turned around and said you'll be blind for a season and the man was blood and here the coppersmith done 10 times to him what that other man done he yet he got away with it Demas must have thought well see the other fellows washed up now he's lost his ministry no he hadn't lost his ministry not at all God don't do things like that God's not an Indian giver yeah notice now now that might not be politically correct anymore any Giver but God's not one that gives a gift and takes it away he said Paul was something on the order like Elijah Elijah the prophet went to the mountain by the commission of God called for fire to fall out of heaven and it fell he called for water came and then he commanded by the message of God and killed 400 priests chopped their heads off let them roll he said then run it then he run at the threat of a woman one little hypocrite hypocrite woman she was an Infidel Jezebel that one little woman which was keynote to every bit of it she's the one that caused it looked like he'd have got her first but God has his way of doing these things and his servants can only work according if he works according to the will of God okay so how come Elijah got scared at the threat of one woman because God hadn't called him to to do the judgment on Jezebel right how could Paul not Smite the copper Smith blind because God hadn't called him to do that but see that will choke some people all right do you remember when brother Adam said this and Look Away to Jesus he said watch my Ministry now it's not going up he said it's going to come down he said because prophecy has to catch up with my Ministry remember he said that liquidity Jesus December 29 1963 I always remember that because it's such a powerful message that's the one that has the five third pole speakings of brother Branham in it brother man's wife uh the storm the snowstorm he spoke to uh Sunny shim and there's two more I always forget he said not going up not getting greater but he said lesser brother random knew his ministry was not going to go greater it was going to become more humble why because God does that to his servants praise God I don't want your faith to go down I want your faith to be right where God wants your faith to be right amen but I'm bringing this out for a purpose so you can see how every preacher battles on different fronts yeah yeah Hallelujah he said don't you see friends you've got to move according to God's way of moving how many times have I set and set and counseled Brethren and how I would like to walk over and shake their hand say brother it doesn't make any difference let's just be Brethren along how can I do that and keep my commission with preach the word I don't want to do that so brother says I like to be brother with them but I've got to stick with the word of God now for him it's probably you know no women preachers serpent seed Lord Jesus Christ baptism God's one person that separates Fellowship right right some of those major topics well Ram said I've sort amongst amongst brother random my aunts over I know you're proud sent from God go over and restore her sight wish I could I'd do it I can't do it tell he tells me to do it see no one could do it Elijah couldn't do it no one else could do it amen amen so what do we have to do we have to wait on God now I've also read some testimonies from Brother matters Ministry brother random gave one of these young men a belt buckle and he said keep that it's going to come in handy one day so he one time he was uh he was diagnosed with cancer he put the belt buckle on and his cancer was instantly healed right what is that just like a prayer cloth and then he said he put it on a woman family member now imagine a woman wearing a belt going down and she had cancer she was healed as well but how come you know he doesn't get these other ants how come he can't go to this preacher and uh restore the blind sight because it wasn't God's will right Hallelujah so can we see the importance of knowing God's will church that's what I ended last Wednesday night remember the Divine Healing brother man brought it down to the great Revelation find God's will first yes you can speak as much be as positive as you can speak speak but you got to find God's will first doesn't matter how much oil you pour on yourself but man I said doesn't matter how many preachers pray for you you got to find God's will first praise God he said that he said that's good though if a preacher Brian or me or cam or brother Brooks or anybody brother Simon if a preacher prays for her he says that's good that'll encourage you praise God lives but he said find the will of God first now what I find is that sometimes we don't even find the will of God and God still answers our request like with Austin's migraine I didn't pray first well let's have word let's see if it's God's will we just prayed yeah right so there's times like that too so we have to say Lord if it's been a while since you haven't answered this prayer now let me seek your will right because after a while we don't know if God if it's God's will or not to do it if if he hasn't showed it to us and church this is what I'm talking about this is spiritual algebra when you have questions in your life that it doesn't actually say in the Bible this is when maturity has to take over and you got to find God's will for your life and then like like brothers I read that quote a few weeks ago no matter what God says yes or no you still love him amen why because he died for your sins amen hallelujah he sends the Holy Ghost on you and you scream and shout and rejoice and clap and dance all over the place Hallelujah speak in tongues whatever you might do prophesy dream dreams whatever you might do God has been so good to us praise God amen and we love the father so much that no matter what he says we'll trust him so see brother Brandon fought it on all the sides you've got the prosperity the people that left him right preacher saying come over do a miracle give give sight to my my blind aunt I have a I have a child uh in my class who's blind in one eye I have a child who's deaf in one ear I need to start praying for them now wouldn't that be powerful God did something just in the school day or something though on the weekend or whatever as soon as I heard that I'm like oh I believe I know he's able but I gotta find God's will right right I don't remember this a few years ago brother Kevin we were at the other place are they kidding brought up his uh was it granddaughter and she had eye trouble and I prayed for her and I said I don't know what you're trouble I think it was hearing trouble I don't know it's either I trouble your trouble we prayed for it right in the service I asked her is it insulin better it wasn't but brother Kevin said uh I think a year later it started healing and I never got the full details but I was the under the anointing in that service I was praying for it I was expecting her to say okay now can you hear better like I was expecting it right there but it didn't come right there I had to wait a little while by God's grace yeah right but sometimes our faith is so strong now me I'm not I was a little discouraged you know because it didn't happen instantly because I listened to brother Graham and it happens just instantly in his testimonies right right but there's testimonies where it doesn't happen instantly and you got to have patience how many want to possess your soul and patience tonight yeah we don't want to get impatient with God we don't want to get Hasty with God we don't want to get upset with God we want to have patience with God Amen now we fight the same battles and we fight other battles on both sides now I put out the video today I don't know if you saw on six dust save the Lords but we're fighting one battle where the people say brother man wasn't a prophet I just want to remind us he was a prophet hallelujah amen now there's many many thus say the Lords that have come to pass but these are the only ones I can verify with before and after so if you know of some other ones let me know first in 1958 brother random told Marilyn Hickey she's a short-haired red-headed woman preacher but she was in Brothers prayer line and brother random said thus saith the Lord you're going to have a baby if you believe go receive it well she didn't get it till 10 years later but thus saith the Lord came to pass and she talks about it they made a little video about her testimony brother Brown said I see a light between us and so they made like a Hollywood video of the light coming out of I think it was coming behind brother Brandon or even been on this side the light came and the sister and Marilyn saw that light come out and ten years later she got the baby ten years it is no joke to wait that's no joke that takes real maturity how many times do you think she questioned was was the man of God right or not was the man of God right am I a Believer or not the whole time she was a believer so what am I encouraging you be a believer praise God you're a Believer Hallelujah that was thus saith the Lord and second 1961 Birmingham said there will be no greater gift to the Gentiles than his gift and that's been 61 years I'm sorry that's been uh I can't remember the number of years sorry I had on the video I forgot it anyways it's been many years and no gift has even gotten close to brother Ram's gift nobody can stand there and tell them all the secrets and thoughts and do it seven or eight times in a row who can do that nobody can do that third brother said women will continue to strip themselves thus saith the Lord he said that in 1962 now sisters aren't you glad you keep your clothes on aren't you glad you're not a striptease to men but I said sending them to hell because of their lust and their immoralities their adulteries and fornications their whore-mongeries aren't you glad you live a holy life like I read that quote my man said you got something those women will never have the virtue of the Holy Spirit the character of the Holy Spirit fourth Abraham said thus saith the Lord I saw a vision of the United States Church dancing to rock and roll with bob hair and makeup on and that's exactly what we got thus saith the Lord 1965 for the man prophesied of Florence shakarian's death now she had stage four cancer and I showed on the video it's not hard I agree it's not hard to predict someone's going to die with stage four cancer but the reason why that was significant was because all of Flora shakarian's preacher friends were saying thus saith the Lord she's going to be healed so yeah false prophets let's say 20. 20 false prophets versus brother random who is right brother Brown was right so it took a stand it took some it took a vision for brother Ram to know sorry sister unless God sends some other Vision or sends healing like Hezekiah right set your house in order unless God sends that passed away in 1965. so there's five six brother Randolph said in anointed one's the end time no denomination will ever break up and come back to the word of God now somebody on YouTube asked me show me some proof show me the dates and show me the quotes I sent them the quotes and they said that's not very convincing and I said I feel sorry for you I said Mercy who do you know who's prophesied one thing with thus saith the Lord and it's coming to pass who do you know nobody Hallelujah and there are six but there's of course there's many more in that those are just the ones that I can confirm that I know I've heard those people or those people have their own testimony and I said if you know some more share them with me and I'll make a new video okay who do you know that's even done one let alone six thus saith the Lord's ever come to pass you know thus saith the Lord had to return because the pillar of fire returned amen hallelujah when do we hear start people start saying thus say the Lord when the pillar of fire came to Moses Hallelujah and then Joshua and then Samuel then David then Solomon breaks down let me get Jeremiah Ezekiel Hallelujah all these Isaiah all these Mighty Men of God why because the pillar of fire came back and that's what we got today the pillar of fires back and we have thus saith the Lord we have thus say the scriptures Hallelujah amen well Ram gave us eight thus say the I'm sorry 12 I'm sorry six thus say the Lords on the Mysteries brother Adam said trinitarian is of the devil thus saith the Lord he said yet they can still be saved because it's a mystery second Israel's blindness program gave us thus saith the Lord Israel's blood until after the Rapture and then God will open their eyes when a fountain is open in the House of David third the baptism Holy Ghost I'm giving you the saith the Lord on the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a third work of Grace foreign on the seven Church ages amen hallelujah fifth program gave us thus Faith the Lord on the Roman Catholic Church he said she's the mother of harlots he said they're harlots and the Catholic and Protestant churches that's flat but that's thus saith the Lord Now isn't that hard to say to a Assembly of God person that's what I was Raising or how about a Christian Missionary Alliance person right isn't that hard to say but it's thus saith the Lord let me say that let me say a different way that's thus saith Jesus Christ can I say it differently so it kind of sounds different for a new testament person it's thus saith the Lord these churches are right the systems of them they make like brother amen was saying they make love with fantasy football leagues on Sunday they get drunk on Saturday night uh suppers in the basement that's making love to demonic spirits they love fantasy football and drunkenness or they love the Holy Ghost but we love the Holy Ghost amen that's what makes us the bride Hallelujah because we won't cheat on the G on the Lord Jesus Christ we'll be faithful to Christ Hallelujah we will be a chaste virgin to Christ how many will be the chase virgin praise God like to hear amens I know so this is a review but think about this this is the man we're standing with and yet this attack says we're all crazy they're crazy I say that with love because they might watch our video I'll say I said that with love go back and watch the video I love you but you're crazy you're crazy because you disbelieve God's word where does the bible say God's three persons it doesn't say that right right where's the Bible say a woman can cut her hair hey don't say that where's the Bible said the Roman Catholic Church is a good church the Bible don't say that but I can show you where it says she's the mother of harlots okay and six and finally brother Graham said he said the Antichrist come in he said the mystery of iniquity what a revelation it's absolutely thus saith the Lord so the revelation of the mystery of the iniquity the Antichrist we have thus saith the Lord on it Satan Works through deception right in other words he's in the churches it's Satan in many of these churches deceiving people making them think they're Christians when they're not so I just shared this church I just gave you four I'm sorry uh 12 thus saith the Lord's 12. you can't get that at any other church and the church said you can't get that in the Baptist Church you can't get at the Pentecostal church we got 12 don't save the Lords amen and in my book I got 30 of them 30. here's eight more doctrines with us saith the Lord the water baptism Brotherhood says that's thus saith the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ be back if you're baptized father suddenly goes go be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ so it's 12 plus 8 20. I'm giving you 20 here tonight 20 thus saith the Lords second program gave us marriage and divorce he says the mystery of marriage and divorce he said it's thus saith the Lord what is it the quickening power coming to the church see God gave us thus said the Lord and Saints a preacher a Baptist preacher walked up to me last night at school and said pastor Jesse I got to ask you a question he said I'm coming to you because I have confidence in you I won't go to many preachers he said a couple wants to marry their divorced and he's divorced and he wants to marry another woman and wants me to do it should I do it and I said absolutely not I said because there's not a verse in the Bible where a divorced person can remarry and he's like you're right Jesus said if that person remarries it'll make them an adulterer and the person they divorce and daughter I said that's exactly right I said but now I said this because of Billy Paul Billy Paul's divorce and remarried I said what they can do is they can go get married at the courthouse and come back in we can still minister them but they got to know they're still living in adultery Hallelujah that's what brother Rand did yeah Billy Paul I'm not going to marry a second time go get married in the courthouse and come back to church and you can still be my secretary but you said you're still you're still living in adultery right and so he said I think you're right he said he said that's what 90 of the 99 of the preachers have told me I said well you've got some pretty good preachers there I'm actually surprised it's 99 I thought 10 or something like that but we got nothing to the Lord brother random gave us interpretation of Daniel's revelation of the image with thus saith the Lord he said it's not Russia that will rule the church I'm sure sorry rule the world it's wrong thus say the Lord show me a scripture where communism or anything else will rule besides Rome brother have said women who purposely dress in sexy provocative clothes will answer for committing adultery because they cause men to lust after them he said you're a tool of the devil at the Judgment bar thus saith the Lord your answer for committing adultery and your soul will be gone you know better look these women know better they have all these TV shows now all these apps women can make money just by stripping their clothes on an app yeah I think it's called what only fans or something like that Austin and Benjamin were telling me about that like all these dating services you can get a prostitute in a matter of minutes and they know better they know what their brother said thus save the Lord you answer for Judgment at the day of judgment and you'll be lost if you don't repent of that now which preachers are preaching that just a few faithful churches thank God we got it amen that's what the Bible said the woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives yeah which preachers are preaching that Urbana said a woman who cuts her hair is spiritually dead she's not born again he said that's thus saith the Lord I don't care how much he speaks in tongues dances sings sings in the choir runs up and down the church has all kinds of AIDS Society she's dead that's the saith the Lord amen Hallelujah see because she's already Dishonored her husband what's the other word for that dishonor is a really awful word for it I use on my video it's a really awful word like this it's a disrespectful kind of word I have to look it up the fullness of Pentecost will come back to the bride that's after 26. I've stayed on that many times over the years brother said the Elijah Messenger to the Gentiles appeared in the United States in 1965. that's thus saith the Lord he said so it can't be Joseph Joseph didn't have a Ministry in 1965. okay right there I just gave you 20 the state the Lord whether the church has that right now you would think we'd be shouting uh from the top of our voice but you did when you first come in the message but this is review right we got thus saith Jesus Christ why because it lines up with his Bible praise God Amen amen so we're fighting a battle on that side right so there's so there's 30 in there 30 thus say the Lords in that chapter now we're finding the other side this is the one I've been I preach on usually every service the voice of God or Brandon Tabernacle uh worshiping of brother Branham they mainly break at least eight scriptures I think they call us preachers to neglect their gifts they do not gather physically together they add to the Bible they take away from the Bible they worship Brothers they won't ask questions I'm sorry they won't answer questions and there's a couple I think there's two more I'm forgetting but let me read you this list here's 24 lies that are coming out and they're all related to breaking those scriptures and I've shared these with the leadership there the first lie every word on tape is thus say the Lord they say the tapes can never be wrong the tapes have no mistakes the tapes have every answer that's the first line the second line all the answers are on the tapes if you have a question that answers on the tapes um is Moses and Elijah the real Moses Elijah or not but man said I don't know well the answer is not on the tape these people are insane and I love them third they say we we must unquestion believe every word on the tape is thus saith the Lord even if brother man made a mistake that's a lie fourth they said every Church must catch the vision you've got to play the tapes and every church is a take church I'm sorry the program never said that and church remember all these things brother random never said right Hallelujah who's the crazy one praise God it's not me Hallelujah not you you're the ones that got some sense about you praise God Amen but where's the big crowds going to all the other things except the truth prosperity No Mess no mistakes in the message no depends like I told the brother it depends what you mean by the message if you mean the Bible revelations I'll go with you on that but they make it sound like it's a tapes right number five the tapes are the token they actually say that and if you're in a tape church that's the evidence you have a token that's the same as saying speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost same devil amen I'm gonna say Amen amen same devil number six they say take boys are the true five-fold ministry that's a lie from hell preachers preach the gospel Hallelujah I'm getting fired up now I better calm down they say tapes are number one in the fivefold ministry show me that in the Bible right they say tapes are the primary Ministry brother Rams Head tapes are secondary it's a literal quote why aren't they saying what the tapes say because they're insane we got to pray for them the seventh lie they say brother random was identical to Jesus and his spirit and soul that's total heresy Jesus never sinned in his mind brother I'm sinned every day in his mind brother Graham's Saul was dead in sin Jesus Soul was never in sin sin somehow I don't know how but their spirits and souls are not the same eighth line anyone who doesn't uh say brother random uh has a living Ministry today is Demas Saints brother Brown is dead all right right we appreciate him we'll honor him to the day we die or the day we're raptured or the day we see him in the Rapture amen hallelujah but the Bible never says a dead Pastor or dead bishop or dead Prophet rules the church the word of God they preach still rules the church praise God but there's a lot of those prophets not just one yeah these are the same people that say brother M is the greatest prophet of all time but they don't say except for Jesus now why don't they say except for Jesus because they don't honor Jesus they honor brother more than Jesus the ninth lie they say Jesus said all churches must be taped churches according to revelation 22 16. it's a lie the 10th lie they said brother random is the angel in Revelation who reveals everything to John that's impossible there's no pre-existence of Souls the eleventh line brother Branham is the absolute I'm sorry brother's tapes are the absolute brother man never said that he said the Bible is the absolute the 12th lie any where and because I can answer questions and the Holy Ghost guides us into all truth the 13th lives I think the worst their Pastor said with thus saith the Lord they're in the perfect will of God by playing tapes I said there's no way they're in the perfect will of God there's no way God said that I think he got he might have got his channels mixed up they might be in God's will but they're in God's permissive will because they're breaking the word of God impossible the 14th as they say brother Adam is the greatest prophet of all time Jesus is the greatest Prophet about that brother I might be the greatest New Testament that'll be up to God I've always thought Paul but we'll see I don't know it's up to God but you can't say it unless the Bible says it because you can't add one thing to the narrative you can't add one thing to this Bible praise God or take away the 15th lie they say a prophet cannot be judged and brother random said in numerous quotes I have on there he said Judge Me by if this prophecy comes to pass or not a prophet doesn't mind being judged a prophet has to be judged the how are we going to enormous the prophet unless he passes the test 16th line I got videos on all these it's brother Brandon is their Pastor brother Ram said I won't always be your pastor and I got the coach this week brother said I will he said I never made a successful Pastor or never would never would that means even now he couldn't be a successful pastor he said because I've got a rambling Spirit In other words God called me to be a prophet not a pastor Hallelujah the 17th lie they're not Gathering more as we see that day approaching the 18th line life only comes to the tapes brother Brown never said that brother said life comes through the word see they're making this tape player where's my phone oh my phone's right there they're making that phone like they're phone equal to God somehow because they've got the message on there that's what I asked him I said does my phone have the token because the message is on my phone yeah does my phone have the Holy Ghost of course not the 19th lie God's program is to play tapes that deletes four folds of the fivefold ministry actually deletes all five because dead profits are not here right the 20th live we are we they say we are now in the wedding ceremony Brothers of the wedding ceremony is the meeting in the air right the 21st line the take when we listen to tapes it's like God speaking lip to ear like God spoke to Moses face to face I said show me one quote on that and there's not one quote in fact remember I said God never spoke to anybody else like that other than Moses and Jesus amen so who's saying what the tape is saying we're saying what the tape is saying think about this church think about it this this these lies gather millions they get millions of times last time they were set they had over 110 million dollars lies bringing money lies could make you popular lives make you famous I'd rather tell the truth and be rejected because I could stand before God and say I told the truth I said what the Bible said Hallelujah you all looking at me like brother Jesse yeah you just gotta overcome this I am the 20-second LIE they said they hear from God just like Abraham heard from Melchizedek that's a lie God was in a physical body when he when he was in Melchizedek God's not in the physical body in all their homes when they stream around the world that's what that's what they say they said just push play and Obey is the perfect will of God and they said God will still be pressing play brother Ram's tapes in heaven that's a lie now God's going to play all of our lives back but God's not going to say this way I'm not going to talk I'm going to press play and we're just gonna listen to brother Brandon in heaven that's what they say that's what they teach that's what they sing about that and this is the battles we're fighting see that's why I had to do this series I see all these 24 lives in church honestly every week I can go to their website they put a new blog post I can find more lies every single week if I wanted to but I just thought well I'll do 24. something good about 24 I guess 24 hours right something holy about that and the last lie put brother Brandon back in the Pulpit when did Brother Bear never say when I'm dead put me back in the Pulpit right and the Very quote the very sermon they're talking about brother Adam quickly taught at Perry Green's church and said I don't want to take the pastor's time and they use those quotes to say put brother Brandon back in the Pulpit he said purposely I don't want to take up the pastor of time in other words brother random respected the fivefold ministry and so do we praise God by the way I'm never a served Authority and so I'm greater than anybody remember you've heard it said he said I'm just at one Pebble on the beach now we know he he said he was a small pebble but we know he's a greater bigger Pebble because he's a prophet messenger all right now that's done with that okay so everybody can take a deep breath now bro Jessie's got his thoughts out all right so the I mean we're fighting battles on all fronts now thank God some of these don't affect us right thank God the tape movement doesn't affect us but churches have it remember I told you that Pastor from Florida member church this is back in 2016. evil spirits would battle him for like two weeks in a row in his in his house and he cried out to God and two people told him there was witches in your church and there there was the same people that were saying press play and stop preaching but once he preached it they left the church and everything was fine because Rebellion is the spirit of witchcraft Hallelujah so we're fighting battles on these fronts too and that's why I gotta stand where I stand but see how can I how could I not stand where I stand who wants me to make a compromise and say well you're the greatest children of all time who wants me to say that who wants me to say that anybody want me to say that nobody who wants me to say well maybe uh maybe we are all believers if we don't play tapes in the services who wants me to say every answer is on the table does anybody want me to say that like I asked him I said you want me to say what's on the tablet said he said the third person the Trinity dwells in my heart and how we love the third person the Trinity who wants me to preach that do you want me to preach that say sister who are the third person treat it came in your heart right at this altar do you want me to preach that of course not she's already not enough oh you want me to preach the Revelation the further revelation Hallelujah see we're fighting battles on all these friends but then we gotta battle friends right because we have not friends it's the spirit behind friends family house family situations right work situations School situations we got all these battles but the Lord fights for us through them all praise God that's why I'm gonna close it go back to Second Chronicles 20. okay verse 5. second chronicles 20 verse 5. I'm already eight o'clock okay I'm a little a little longer than I wanted to foreign the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem and the house Lord before the new court and said O Lord God of our fathers art not thou God in heaven and Rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in thy hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee what a great revelation you're surrounded by enemies but you know God nobody can defeat him Your Darkest Hour surrounding me we're we're still you have the confession God's greater than all these armies verse 7 art thou not our God who does drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave us to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever I like that see church it's okay to ask God questions when you're going through trials didn't you deliver so and so didn't you do that for brother Austin didn't you do that for sister who didn't you do that for sister Naomi didn't you do that for Sister Christian didn't you do that for Malachi brother Malachi did you do that for sister sir God wants to hear our prayers God wants us to have communion with him praise God this is Jehoshaphat he stands he says I'm in the presence of God I'm in the house of God I've got a need I just got to call on God hallelujah doesn't the Bible say Church did a man for God's Own Heart saying I will call the Lord who's worthy to be praised and I shall be saved from my enemies praise God Amen that's a man after God's Own Heart if I call I'll be saved Hallelujah I didn't know you didn't say when but he said if I call I will be saved Hallelujah a man after God's Own Heart how do you worth a bride after the heart of our husband Christ didn't David say as for me I will call upon God and the Lord shall save me evening and morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud for he shall hear my voice church God shall hear your prayers you're facing multiple battles multiple trials I seen it again today I was telling this to uh australina when I uh counsel them I said you've got to make time every morning to pray I said every time I do no matter how busy my day is I get everything done that's important I've never seen that fail it's like today I prayed I got up at 4 50.
