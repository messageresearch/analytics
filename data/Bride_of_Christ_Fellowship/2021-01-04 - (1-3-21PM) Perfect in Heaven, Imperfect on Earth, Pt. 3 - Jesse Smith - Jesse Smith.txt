time we get busy we kind of don't give jesus enough time then we gotta surrender and say lord i'm gonna make more room for you praise god i think that's a beautiful song as you're standing let's take our bibles i'd like to go to uh job let's go to job 31 35 i think we'll finish this little brief series here tonight by god's grace and then we'll get back into the music one yesterday i listened to an hour and a half of music sermons uh but i wanted to and i made notes you know about which i want to i want you to hear samples of you know good rhythm good melody uh good beats and then they have samples of bad ones right after that so i want to i want to get those to you but i want to put them on my document first so i didn't have enough time to get that done today so sorry about that like i said i slept two extra hours today so forgive me but i'd like to as your turn there job3135 i'd like to recognize lydia lydia wasn't here this morning but um she's constantly playing and helping us out our music ministry and then when she doesn't when she's free back there she'll help out with the computer sometimes let's give her a round pause god bless you ladies let's express my love to you honey thank you for your faithful service god bless you love you honey joke 31 35 and we'll take this thought hopefully we can finish this uh series tonight by god's grace i do have uh scriptures to show and everything so let's read uh job 31 35. it's part of me i need a minute to get there let's remember brother jose this week in prayer i'll probably i'll probably fast wednesday or maybe even tomorrow we'll see but i'll text everybody just as a reminder let's try to miss a meal or two for our brother instead of eating just get on our knees or uh maybe about the table and just give a sacrifice of prayer for brother jose that his eyes can be healed by god's grace job 31 35 let's just read that one together um here's where job demands god answer him remember brother brahm did that too he said brother he said god you know me an understanding and it made it made god of course upset job 31 35 let's read that one two three oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book let's have one more word of prayer heavenly father lord we just come again here tonight lord god we're moved by the holy spirit together more as we see that day approaching we know lord god that wherever two or three are gathered there you are in the midst so lord we honor your presence in the midst tonight lord god we know you're here we're thankful that you're here lord you're our guest of honor lord without you we wouldn't want to be here lord god and we're only here because you're here lord god so let your presence just minister here for the next few moments give us another blessing more instruction lord more faith more revelation may we go from faith to faith to glory to glory we pray we want to be more like you we want to make room for your lord god to do whatever you want in our lives we want to be humble we want to be submissive help us now to understand our sufferings in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god okay thank you and i'll try not to preach an hour and a half tonight okay but i just couldn't it was like it was like new wine okay i was just all bubbling up this morning and uh felt good to get it all out there by god's grace so i just you know to me a lot of these things are fresh i've never seen job in this way before so a lot of these are fresh i would say revelation or understanding to me and it really helps me as i said to put job on the level with all of us he wasn't above us or anything i'd say he's on the same level as far as like he was a man he had mistakes he needed god's grace he was trusting in the blood um and we can relate to him really well so let me do this let me set my timer for uh 40 minutes okay and hopefully we can uh hopefully i can be done in 40 minutes we'll see we'll see how the holy spirit directs us so let's uh i want to just put two new things in here i do a new thing here and a new thing there this was our text uh this is at the very end of job's words in chapter 31. uh he for he said he said oh that one would hear me behold my desires that the almighty would answer me remember it seems as if god has been quiet this whole time from chapter 3 all the way to 31 god has been quiet he's just let job kind of blurt out you know some things now god's showing him a few things right i know my redeemer liveth but god let it be silent and let them debate for a while uh and and then he cries out and he's demanding god oh that god would answer me that my adversary had written in a book and so part of this prayer being answered is elijah coming right because he says i'm not eli who says i'm not speaking by myself i'm speaking by the anointing of god amen right he said usually young men don't speak he said but i feel the spirit of god like wine pushing out of me and i've got to speak these things and he said job if i'm wrong you speak up and correct me and job never did now to back up what we said about job being a type of laodicean look what he said here he said i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder so job said he got to a place of relaxing in a spiritual walk right and we all know what that's like right we just get consumed with worldly things or family responsibilities or we forget to pray or we're not because you know we're not focusing on the things of god we didn't make something right he got at ease uh he stopped being diligent about the things of god so that's like laodicea right not as diligent as we ought to be so i just thought i'd bring another scripture there to show that these are job's own words right job understood uh he had good he had good things in his life but he was also a man he also had struggles in his life okay so with that being said um let's go the next scripture here okay so job 34. if you got your bibles let's go to job 34. we ended with chapter 33 and then we opened up now in chapter 34. i just want to bring out a few important things out of these uh scriptures here i'm gonna read verses three through nine and the main idea is now listen look at this eli who says job is accused of believing scorning against god so job must have heard scorning against god but the bible says he drank it up scorning against god so he heard it from somewhere now it could have been the devil too right that's where this is where we get some of our bad ideas right from our mind battles but he he is accused by elihu for drinking up scorn against god which is like anger and bitterness and judgment against god okay so 34 verses three through nine for the ear trieth words as the mouth taste this meat so he's talking about job's ears are listening to words verse four let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is good for job has said i am righteous and god have taken away my judgment right there he said i'm righteous and god isn't judging me the right way again very harsh words against our creator god right should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without transgression now look he says i won't get healed yet i didn't do anything wrong that's not true what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water so job is he's just taking the wrong ideas right he's just listen remember because he said earlier for the ear tries the words and the mouth taste is meat so job is listening he's listening what other people say and he was believing it right sometimes we'll believe the wrong thing somebody will share the wrong idea and you'll start believing it well the bible says try every spirit amen so don't believe everything you hear if anything's taught us that it's this election psycho right and all these uh coronavirus news reports and everything oh my goodness you don't believe everything you hear you must and we know that we must rightly divide the word of god right we must discern is this the right spirit or the wrong spirit well job during the trial right like we all would he starts drinking in the wrong thing scorn angered and then he says god is not ju i'm righteous god is not righteous remember just like brother graham see this is why it reminds me so much about branham god you owe me an understanding why would you heal someone and then take them home why would you save a woman from drowning and then just shortly after she dies in the hospital she has the little children right you owe me an understanding and god put a black sheep between the prophet and him for a while because we don't demand from god uh verse okay that was uh verse seven so see look joe was believing and drinking up uh wrong thoughts verse eight which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and worketh with wic i'm sorry walketh with wicked men so look the elihu even says he's going with the company of those workers of iniquity so i'm not even sure about that is that physically or what because he was drinking up their scorn right that's quite a statement i didn't actually didn't look at that one too deep verse 9 for he has said it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god now look at that job said it doesn't do you any good to enjoy god doesn't do you any good that's what he said right and job never corrects him so now we see a lot more job said a lot of things that we would hopefully not say we might feel it we might think it right but god forbid may god help us not to utter words like that like it doesn't do us any good to come to church it doesn't do us any good to anoint the sick it doesn't do us any good to sing songs oh no it does it changes everything praise god amen it restores us it transforms us it heals us amen i'm going to show you lord willing on that music thing you scientists have just played classical music and they can prove that classical music brings healing it forms certain crystals in water even but then they play rock and roll to the same water and it deforms all the crystals and it looks like they have scientific proof on that music heals amen brother divine healing malachi lydia divine healing when you play that glorifies the lord not just physically but spiritually as well praise god but see job got to the spot his trials were so difficult which was not downing job but he just got to the spot where he said it doesn't do me any good to delighting god okay now i went through the harsh words already because verse 5 said for job hath said in other words elijah remembers what job said and he reminds them of it okay now verse 10 to 15 therefore hearken unto me men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways so here eli who says god does reward according to his ways and it is beneficial to serve the lord 12 yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert judgment who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole world if he set his heart upon man if he gathereth unto himself his spirit and his breath all flesh shall perish together and no man shall turn i'm sorry and man shall return again unto dust so eli who says if god wants to he could come down here and every man would just turn to dust but remember job was saying things like oh god's not fair god's not fair and you lie who's trying to say no you've lost sight of how great god is right sir sometimes amongst our blessings and our jobs and our talents what we can do sometimes we forget how great god is so job had become so rich so smart so admired by everybody at ease he had all these things he he he'd seen all that yet he had fears right he'd done all that and he kind of forgot about the greatness of god because now god is wrong and i'm right oh my so see elijah justifies god and if god would personally reply men would turn to dust so even in the whirlwind right god must he's limiting himself right because when he came when jesus came to john in revelation 1 he fell down like he was dead right he had to touch him and then he raised him up so see god always has to make himself humble in order to appear before man he's got to hold forth some of his power and his glory amen now let's keep going here now verse 16 to 19. here he says it again that job is condemning god so let's read 16-19 if now thou has understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most just is it fit to say to a king thou art wicked and the princes ye are ungodly so what's elijah saying you're calling god god unjust he said but you couldn't even call princes or kings that on earth now you can do it today right but usually you couldn't do it they can call trump or biden you can call them whatever you want barack obama today you can get away with calling them about anything but in those days you couldn't right it used to be they'd respect kings right now they used to be in america they respect the president but elijah uses this argument you know you wouldn't even say evil things about a human ruler let alone heaven's ruler he said job is done wrong now verses now let's get down to verse 23 this reminds me of first corinthians 10 he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god all right so in other words god won't let too much happen to you that you can't control it right let me read that first corinthians 10 sorry let me read that i'm kind of misquoting it i want to quote it the right way let's go to first corinthians 10. beautiful chapter here uh saying everything that egypt i'm sorry everything that israel lost on the way to egypt or failed we should not fail and we should learn from israel's mistakes amen how many are learning from job's mistakes out there anybody learn out there praise god that's what the bible says we're supposed to do praise god come together read the old testament we should learn from that amen now verse 13. actually let's read verse 12 because this is where job failed wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall remember he said i got ease i started taking it a little easy on my walk with god i stopped looking for that lion that was seeking to devour me he started taking it easy verse 13 there's no temptation taken you but was but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it amen that's what elijah said elijah said he will not lay upon man more than what's right amen god will not mistreat us amen god will be he will be faithful to us he'll respect us praise god he won't give us more than we can handle he doesn't delight in us making mistakes he wants to see us overcome praise god hallelujah so see he won't give us more than we can handle not 31 to 37 this must be an important section here because it's such a sixth verse's law so eli who shows job how to repent amen and this also says job was not always wise and he gives a strong rebuke okay so 31 surely it is meat to be said unto god i have borne chastisement i will not offend any more so see this is what you should say job i will not offend you anymore that which i see not teach thou me if i've done iniquity i will do no more praise god amen now remember he did do iniquity that's what he said we saw that earlier today okay 32 no i'm sorry 33 shouldn't it be according to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore speak what thou knowest let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me let's see we're going down to 37 okay end of the chapter job has spoken without knowledge and look what he says you spoke and you didn't understand what you were saying how many times do we see that in people's lives they speak things off they don't even know what they're saying right and his words were without wisdom so in other words job was foolish remember he was wise at the beginning his wife was foolish but what happened to him he became foolish by uh giving in to the the wrong thoughts and listening to other people's words right taking in the scorning words so he became foolish verse 36 my desires that job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men wow she wants job to be judged i want job to be tried by god and that's exactly what happened praise god amen this is christ for he added now look my goodness i didn't see look at this one for he added rebellion unto his sin so not only is he iniquity pride lazy scornful he's rebellious really church really i mean think about this he has rebellion under his sin he clapped with his hands among us and multiplied his words against god so you know someone is in a very sad condition when they're saying lots of words against god right just watch their words that when they're speaking against god they're in rebellion so what a what a chapter praise god church what a chapter i hope you've seen now things about job you didn't know before right i know i have i might have i i read and highlighted this years ago and i forgot it but now it's come at this time for a time and season a purpose there's a purpose for knowing it now praise god for any trials of course we have trials every year for the trials of this year we want to be ready right we don't want to charge god foolishly we want to be ready to praise god in the midst of the storm praise god amen now 35 1-3 eli who repeats job's claimed that he was more righteous than god so read that this is a very short chapter well 16 verses but they're short elihu spake moreover and said think it's thou this to be right that thou has said my righteousness is more than god's do you think it's right to say this job that you're more righteous than god for thou said us what advantage will it be unto thee and what prophet shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin my goodness so see job was he was in a really bad place i'll just say like that yeah and that church i'll simply say like this it's a place i've never been i've never lost 5 million i've never lost 10 children i've never lost my health right i've lost i've lost little things of those you know maybe finances and sick for a little bit but this guy has lost everything in a matter of months so that's why i'm not judging him i'm not looking down upon him but i'm trying to get us to see that god is very gracious and god is very merciful praise god amen in the midst of our evil words in the midst of our complaining god will be faithful to us amen now verses four and five look now eli who says look to the clouds to see how much greater god is so see job understandably was looking down at his situation and he said god is going to teach job the same thing that eli who is teaching him so verse 4 and 5. i will answer thee and thy companions with thee look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than thou in other words look higher than where you're looking praise god right stop looking so low look higher now look at verse 13 to 16 god is angry uh god is angry with joe i put god up there sorry that's wrong god is angry that should be job by fall 13-16 surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty regard it although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou and him so see job wasn't trusting see elijah is here to correct him to help him right to be the mediator to bring peace between job and god right and elijah is saying you need to trust in god amen praise god let's trust in god in the midst of our storms amen 15 but now because it is not so he has visited in his anger so he's angry with god i'm sorry god's anger with job yet he knoweth it not in great extremity but it's not going to be too extreme so even god in his anger is going to be is going to be merciful to us therefore death job open his mouth in vain he multiplies words without knowledge wow so what's that that's the same accusation the other chapter ended with chapter 34. job's talking too much his words are vain his words don't mean anything right his words are not helping the matter see how there's life and death in the power of the tongue we've got to make sure we're speaking life into the situation let's not waste our words let's make them useful praise god for the kingdom of god amen keep going here elihu let's see how many more slides i got okay some of these maybe won't read through all of them but let me just go through 36 1-3 eli who speaks of god's behalf showing god's righteousness he shows his dealings with kings righteous men and wicked men so now elijah starts showing how god is faithful with all men right with kings and and common man right righteous men unrighteous men god is righteous and that's chapter 36 let's skip ahead now to 37. god's power in creation is explained in chapter 37. verses 14 to 24 elijah for runs god's 60-plus nature related questions for job and he says god is excellent in judgment amen so job has been saying god doesn't judge right god doesn't judge right and eli who comes and said god is excellent in judgment praise god god is fair in judgment amen he's done exactly what he had to do job job's like god doesn't know what he's doing he lies as he knows exactly what he's doing amen he's faithful so see and this is this is a forerunner here to what god is going to say to job himself okay now verse 37 ends i'm going to read 37 24 the last verse of 37 men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heart so again he's rebuking job you're too wise for yourself right you've got a foolishness a false wisdom you think you're so smart but you're not and then saints all of a sudden the atmosphere changes right up to this point you just got men arguing and debating you know one sits up one stands up at a time the first one stands then job stands they take turns all of a sudden the atmosphere changes imagine the clouds start rolling in church allahu looks around he said i knew he was coming he told me he was coming all the friends you imagine those three friends hold them together imagine job hiding himself all of a sudden the storm clouds come in and then the wind picks up and pretty soon the wind starts circling around like a tornado praise god and pretty soon that tornado looks far off it starts coming really really close and these men these little men like i love how god does this he comes in a way where they can't deny it they can't change it they can't affect it because the power is greater than their power amen remember for these men by the amen think they know all about it they think they know how everything works right they're so much wiser in their judgment than god and so how does god reveal himself to them in a whirlwind they can't control it they can't stop it praise god they can't explain it praise god amen this is how god in his wisdom comes to correct his son that he loves so much he comes in the form of a whirlwind now wouldn't it be a disastrous whirlwind it would be a whirlwind and probably god's theophany body you might see the outline of the son of god in there that's what some of the commentators think because it wouldn't be like the destructive whirlwind right that took down job's house for us where sons and daughters passed away it wouldn't be like that it'd be a divine whirlwind praise god like the one brother ram saw and that talk to him in the trees when he was a little boy praise god so god comes in a way that these men can't control they can't explain and what's god's first words to job i love this look at this god is so gracious verse 1. then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said well done prophet of god nope job god says this he says who are you who do you think you are remember god let god look how merciful god is he let these men spew off and say i'm better than god i'm better than god god doesn't know what he's doing god doesn't know what he's doing while at that very time god is saying have you considered my servant job that's what he says to the devil he's bragging on job and job's like i'm better than you now god leaves that holy dimension praise god where the blood of where god's uh keeping track of the sacrifices and he comes down here to talk to his child and he says who are you i love that i love that question who am i i know because it's a very easy answer nobody right who are you brother bank who am i who are you amen nobody that's a great question to ask praise god amen who am i that i should speak against the almighty god amen so his first his first word to job is is not i love you so much thank you for trying your best to make it through your trials no i remember church he's still got black skin right he's got bruises uh it's dying it's kang or maybe yellowish you know he still lost his hair he's got boils he says who are you because remember this man exalted him exalted himself above god not and like i heard a preacher say this he said basically the next few chapters are just god saying job you are ignorant [Laughter] i thought that's a good answer right there and how many would say that we need god's help to not be ignorant as well praise god see we just speak things that just let it fly out like for example we'll criticize the leaders and say oh wish they should have did this well it's easy to say that because you weren't in the position right right let a big emergency come upon you let's see if you make exactly the right decision nothing wrong with it oh you'll probably make a mistake right because we're all prone to make mistakes so god's first words who are you and not only that but who are you that darkeneth who are you that perverts the word of god you're darkening it you're not more light you're darkening it without knowledge who is this man who's preaching false doctrine right that doesn't have the knowledge of god yeah member up in heaven he's a perfect man satan wow church see this is amazing amazing god's mercy and god's love then he says verse three gird up thy loins like a man now that means you're ready to work in other words god said get ready to work come on get ready to get ready to uh do something for me get ready to show me your power boy gird up your loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me cause remember he just demanded oh i wish i could talk to god i wish i could talk to him he said you want to talk to me come on up girl up your loins let's see what you got you're gonna answer and i said i'm gonna make you answer my questions my what a scene what a uh what a humbling situation for our dear friend job this is why brother ram will say many times god has to get a child of god on their back in order to look up to heaven this is why the bible says if you don't take the communion worthily many are sick and weakly among you because god remember we saw he's gracious he's pleading with them just just say the right thing just learn from me but then they're trying to exalt themselves like there's something special i know more about it i got more revelation than god i can oh my mercy now you know this you know as i told you there's over 60 questions that god asked job he takes him on a virtual tour of the universe so all the friends are sitting there they're all trembling you know and the whirlwind is speaking who are you job who are you why are you darkening counsel against me the second question is where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth let's start with when the earth was first laid laid in its position right so god placed this on mercury and venus and then he laid the earth in its place where were you job when i did that oh my he says declare go ahead declare if thou should understand i wonder how long god waited until he moved on where were you job job don't say anything [Music] who laid the measures thereof in verse five where are the foundations fastened where did you lock down the earth's foundations where did you lock it into how did you get to stay in place job verse 7 when this morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy praise god amen where were you and all the angels were praising and worshiping god and the stars were singing amen now so he starts with the earth and in verse 8 he goes to the sea who shut up the sea with doors when it break forth as i had issued out of the womb so who stopped the ocean waters from flowing did you do that job when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddling band for it he made a garment a clothed clothing for the clouds where were you and i made clothes for the clouds right now if you just scroll down here he gives him a virtual tour look at verse 17. well verse 16. hastat entered into the springs of the sea so where is the very spring where's the source of the sea like where is it springing forth and bringing water up from it where is that job or hast thou walked in the search of the depth of the seas god said if you walked down the bottom of the ocean have you searched down there look at 17. this is a great question have the gates of death been opened unto thee do you know how to open the gates of death in closing or has thou seen the doors of the shadow of death have you gone down to hell right and seen satan how about the size of the earth in verse 18. hast thou perceive the breath of the earth declare if thou knowest it all oh man he said he can judge better than god god's given many chances okay the sea right the earth go ahead go ahead what do you know about it oh look at her 19 where is the where i'm sorry where's the way where light dwells where is light's home so when light gets done shining where does it where does it go to sleep at night go ahead tell me where's light's home at where is it as to the darkness where's the place thereof where does the darkness go do you know the home address of darkness man oh yeah look at 22. hassan entered into the treasures of the snow do you know how do you know how to make snow where is this the home of snow karis do you know where where does home go where does snow go home you know the treasures have you seen that or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail where does god store those hail stones which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war god saving those hailstones somewhere he says have you do you know where that house is look at verse 28 hath the reign of father are you the father of rain job can you make some some rain for me or we have begotten the drops of dew can you make some do for me oh my god look at verse 29 out of whose womb came the ice well who's the mother of ice or how about the horny frost of heaven who had gendered it who's the mom and dad of frost and now not now we've just been on the earth right now now we're going up into the constellations so he's taking him on a tour around the earth into the sea snow and now he goes up to the stars the really really far stars away can that bind the sweet in influence of pleiades or loose the bands of orion orion's got those three stars at the belt can you take that apart can you loose that and kind of split them up any way you like joke bye and he goes through more consolations in verse 32 and 33. verse 23 or 35 can you send lightnings that they may go and say to thee here we are i love how god answers god knows how to humble his people he gives them questions they can't answer i tell you that's what's been humbling about this year with i believe the sign attacking brother branham they've given us a lot of questions right and some of them don't know how to answer that's okay we're not going to curse god we're not going to curse his prophet we're going to trust god amen look at this and now he goes back down to earth after going up to the heavens he comes back down to earth to the animal life verse 39 wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion in other words god is saying i give the lion food to eat are you going to give the lion food to eat have you ever given the lion food to eat who makes job can you make sure the lions get every meat that they need so they don't starve now we have hard he probably had enough time keeping care of his goats and calves right right we have a hard enough time with our animals right so god is giving him so much to think about verse 41 who provideth for the raven is food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat think about that all the baby birds and all their nests god says have you made sure they they get their meals and they don't cry too loud to their mama you go around and feed all those ah job you're just ignorant praise god you're just ignorant right i'm almighty god and i do all these things praise god amen i place the stars i i place the foundations of the earth i made the sea stop i feed the lions praise god i know where light is i know where dark dwells praise god i say this the snow the hailstones i'm in control of all this i make sure everybody gets fed praise god amen a virtual tour of the universe now in chapter 39 he goes on more look at verse one notice the other time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth or can't stop mark when the heinz do calve so are you gonna are gonna are you gonna help all the the baby or all the moms have their babies up in the mountains all the mountain goats up there gonna make sure they have their babies the right way gonna take care of them make sure make sure that's taken care of right he says verse two can you number the months that they fulfill or know us out of the time when they bring forth do you know how many months they need until they're giving birth right now some scientists might be able to remember some of that information but job was not that kind right we know he wasn't he was more of a spiritual man so god is asking him all these scientific questions and of course job doesn't have any answers he talks about the mountains in verse 8 the wings of peacocks in verse 13. now look at this one yeah look at the peacocks look at verse 14 which leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dust and forget it that the foot may crush them or the wild beast may break them so god even says look i make the great animals but i also make the ones that are not so smart see he's letting he's letting god he's letting job no i do all these great things but i make all these humble things too i'm in charge of all of it i make strong great awesome animals and i make foolish animals they leave their eggs around they get smashed i make those so that means god even makes mosquitoes right i can't really say i'm really thankful for those all the time but god's saying i do the foolish i do these things that seem foolish to you i make foolish animals why because they all have a purpose right they all have a purpose yeah look at verse 17 god deprived her of wisdom so god didn't give this peacock enough wisdom god did that remember church don't get discouraged now remember the bible said god makes some rich and god makes some poor so don't get discouraged about our financial conditions now it's different if we've done sin then we need to make it right right but if we're faithful with our tithes and offerings that we're faithful and we're giving people then god will be with us but there are certain people god is made really smart and maybe not so smart right there's certain people god has made rich and certain ones god made poor he's in control of all this and then he goes into the horse in verses 19 to 25 he talks about the horse look at verse 19 has to have given the horse his strength has to have clothed his neck with thunder canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible so he talks about a horse in battle can you can you make that horse afraid he's like no right you can't you can't even control that horse the horse will run into battle so see it's getting closer and closer to job right the bible said he laughs at the trumpets the war horses now they have fierceness and rage in verse 24 they run right into the battle at the sound of the trumpet and job can't even control them look at verse 26 does the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch out her wings toward the south does the eagle mount up at thy command amen praise god you sometimes i wonder where are those hawks and eagles going they're going somewhere where god commanded them to go god's commanding them to come up higher god's commanding them to go nests and roost up there god is directing them praise god now i did forget this look at chapter 40. i'm sorry job does speak a little bit here i'm sorry look at verse one yeah i forgot to read verse 40 or chapter 40 rather let's read verse one moreover the lord answered job and said no i'm sorry no no i'm sorry oh yeah in verse 3 and 4 yeah verse three four five job does answer in the middle list so here let's see what he says verse one verse two shall he contendeth with the almighty i'm sorry shall he that contended with the almighty instruct him he that reprove with god let him answer it amen see god recognizes job you're arguing with me you're exalting yourself greater answer any of these questions so what does job say then job answer lauren said behold i am bio what shall i answer thee i will lay my hand upon my mouth once i've spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will not proceed any further now look job can't even answer the breath of the earth now we could answer that one right if we got google out it could tell us how many miles around it but that's about all we can answer but then we we would need help to answer right but job's like i can't even answer the size of the earth i don't know any of this i don't know how long these animals are pregnant i don't know what time i don't know where snow goes i i don't know i'm vile before he's like i'm righteous and now in the presence of that whirlwind amen he says i'm vile amen i've uttered things i should not have said praise god verse six then answer the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said gird up thy loins like a man he says it again praise god come on show me your strength show me how strong you are get ready to work show me your show me your power act like a man job what was that yeah malachi was saying that yesterday he was playing that tank game he said let's fight like men he said right i think i heard you say did you say that fight like men yeah yeah i think i heard you say that that's what god's saying to joke come on fight like a man come on show me show me show me what you got verse eight will thou also disagree my judgment look he's rebuking him you say i'm i'm bad at judgment you got better judgment than me will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous amen see church god don't play around can you get amen for that amen god doesn't play around you're questioning me that's god that's our loving god amen you're questioning me i'm not writing judgment come on talk talk like a man now come on give me an answer pass out an arm like god in verse nine or cant thou thunder with the voice like mine oh my look at verse said deck thyself now with majesty and excellency now look at the funny part look at the sarcasm of that one and array thyself with glory and beauty this is the ugliest job has ever been right he's lost his hair right we've all seen the pictures on he lost his hair he has red spots everywhere sores everywhere he's probably barely got any clothes on right you can hardly sleep he's got huge bags under his eyes he can't sleep at night his skin has got black and purple and it's decaying all over it he says come on make yourself beautiful if you understand judgment come on in other words heal yourself that's something that usually humbles us all right we get sick right and the doctors can't heal us nobody can heal us only god can heal us come on job dress yourself like a man put on glory make yourself glorious and majesty while that that whirlwind's whirling like this speaking out of the whirlwind come on show me your majesty joke see we must be very careful with our words church he ends this which you remember god ends this discussion with job by showing him two amazing animals right so he takes him around the universe right takes him up to the stars down the bottom of the ocean he takes him out in the weather in the skies and all these things and then he finally brings it down to this and he says i'm going to give you two different animals in chapter 40 verse 15. because he says in verse 14 then while i also confess to me that thine own right hand can save thee in other words job can you even save yourself from these two animals these two beasts so he really brings it down close down to home for job if you're so great can you save yourself from the behemoth which i made with thee he eat his graph as an ox now people say this is a hippo it's not a hippo it was a brontosaurus or brachiosaurus it was a dinosaur yeah look at verse 17 they say oh it's a hippopotamus he moved with his tail like a cedar a hippopotamus has a tiny tail anyone knows that this animal had a tail like a cedar tree so his tail is like this it's massive right a cedar tree that's not a hippo that's a brachiosaurus what's the biggest one gigantosaurus which one is america you remember okay yeah i just thought because the name gigantosaurus i got them all mixed up i know a brachiosaurus is really big brontosaurus brachiosaurus in other words that real big one with the real long tail the real long head and the big huge belly and the four legs look at verse 19 he's the chief of the ways of god amen so it says save yourself from the brachiosaurus he's the chief of the ways of god he that made him made him make his sword to approach unto him the mountains are food for him in verse 20. oh my god he drinks up a river and doesn't even doesn't even blink an eye that's in verse verse 23 yeah he just drinks up a river can you defend yourself can you save yourself against the brachiosaurus he brings it down to two beasts the last one is the leviathan leviathan is a water dinosaur god says you can't get him with a hook in his nose right he won't make a covenant with you in verse 4 so he won't surrender to you this fire breathing dinosaur verse 10 none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me praise god so there used to be dragons in the sea right before the flood there should be dragons in the sea and he said no one would dare stir this animal up how are you going to fight against me if you can't even handle my animal my little pets how you going to handle me come on joe gird yourself up fight the leviathan right fight the behemoth go ahead get your get your belt ready show me how great you are job same thing for us let's not think about how great we are because we're nothing let's remember how great our god is let's remember i'm vile i'm a failure i can't do anything without his help without jesus i can do nothing yeah he was a fire fire-breathing dragon look at verse 15 his scales are his pride so the scales on this this dinosaur shut up together as with a closed seal one is so near to the other that no air can come between them uh the bible says the spears can't even pierce him this this uh this dinosaur of the the sea was so great a spear could even prod him yeah look at verse 29 darts are counted as stubble he laughed without the shaking of a spear so whatever dinosaur this was he didn't care about the men's spears didn't bother him look at verse 19 out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out this was a fire breathing dinosaur and god said can you handle this guy if so what about me and if not what about me he actually made the seed to boil like a pot in verse 31 he would breathe underwater he made the seas hot and boiled verse 33 upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear he belongeth he beholdeth all high things he is king over all the children of pride and then church he god ends with that this this uh sea dragon dinosaur is the he's the king over all the children of pride god says and then all of a sudden the clouds roll back and god is gone god just goes like that and he ends by by ending with this uh this dinosaur from the sea is the greatest of all my creations greater than all the children of men job and god just goes did god answer job's questions directly not directly not exactly but he did answer praise god amen he answered in a specific kind of way now i want to get to this thought here let's yeah let's let's go to this thought here let's go go now to the blood i just want to end with a few thoughts about the blood i'm going to do it on time i must have i must have stopped my timer sorry man i thought i got that okay now look what he says i want you to notice closely job then in all of his distress sitting out there church members come and turn their back on him for seven days little later about any man that comes and said job you're a secret sinner you've done something wrong you've sinned secretly job knew he'd not sinned because he come upon the basis of god's word in other words job didn't have any sin that wasn't covered by the blood praise god see he had fears he said words but he always brought the sacrifice amen he always had a blood sacrifice waiting for him amen amen in other words he always confessed his sin to god praise god he didn't let days and weeks go by without saying jesus i'm sorry forgive me my sins you know of course it was yahweh lord jehovah see he come upon the basis of the shed blood knowing that god required a blood sacrifice and blood was what job offered knowing that god could not refuse it amen the whole picture is a perfect revelation amen the whole picture of what job's perfection is a picture of revelation we are perfect before god not based upon our efforts but by meeting god's requirement of blood sacrifice amen oh my god it's a perfect revelation of fellowship with god almighty fellowship through the blood oh thank you lord say prove it i would love to now the god of peace we're saying about peace this morning peace of god cover me that bringeth again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect and who else was perfect job job so now the new testament saying were perfect through the blood just like the old testament said john was perfect through the blood amen one was animal and the next is the son of god amen the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world see both of us can be perfect in that beautiful praise god both job in the old testament abraham and moses and david they were perfect so are we perfect but our covenant speaks better promises than that of the old amen so the blood brother amen will make us perfect in every good work the blood's gonna do that what does that mean well the blood offers forgiveness now i gotta yeah so job kept offering remember in chapter one he kept offering burnt sacrifices he kept trusting in the power of the blood oh that's what i'm trusting in tonight amen amen i'm trusting not in my power but in the power of jesus's blood amen amen because remember what does the blood the blood do the blood gives us redemption right remember i don't know the scripture but romans 5 says we have faith in the blood see so forgiveness of sins redemption was redemption it's a releasing of ransom it's deliverance it's liberation from guilt praise god this is how we're perfect this is how we can actually do a work for god by trusting in the blood by trusting that the blood frees us from our guilt amen frees us from our condemnation amen frees us from our complexes right the blood freezes from that and we become redeemed we become perfect we're delivered praise god we're seen as perfect in the eyes of god and god can use us for little humble works of service oh thank you jesus praise god i love it and remember this is this is the whole key here church i know it's very familiar but if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness right and if we walk in the light now which verse is that let me turn that real quick we walk in the light as he's in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all righteousness yeah verse seven i don't have it up here verse seven says if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen ah the power of the blood so see foolish bush virgins won't be confessing it as much as we will right because they can't do all the perfect works of god okay sinners they won't be confessing anything right so we've got to constantly confess our sins and that will help us feel forgiven help us walk and we'll walk in the light we won't be in darkness we'll be in the light amen we'll see what god wants us to do and we'll do god's perfect will through the blood just like job did it through the blood as well now here's what i wanted to show you there's at least uh four benefits to suffering i know it's kind of hard to get go to this but i found this quote today this is beautiful look at job a perfect man a just man and god permitted the evil devil to come upon him and chasten him or chastise him and everything else for what the perfecting of his spirit right not his flesh his mind see all these trials we go through and so we'll be stronger in our minds see so evil spirits god uses evil spirits many times to work out his plan and his will i thought that was so beautiful god wants to perfect your thinking god wants you to think perfectly and precisely about the things happening in your life to always make sure you think the right things about him now this is really small but this is schofield um i will just skip ahead to the next one because that's so small let me read it i'll just i'll just skip to these because i'm proud i'm probably an hour right i'm probably did anybody think i'm at an hour honey do you think i'm gonna yeah okay so let me finish up here i'm almost done yeah i'm almost done i got one two three four more slides so the first thing it will do suffering will bring you self knowledge and self-judgment and that brings you to humility and the reason you need humility is so you can reign because god doesn't want a prideful ruler that's what we got today church and look look at the mess we got they're all prideful they're doing it because they think everything the decision they make is to exalt themselves look at these governors and mayors and man look at the presidents and you know look at these congressmen and congresswoman they're all pride but ii timothy 2 verse 12 says if we must reign with him we must suffer with him so suffering is directly connected to being able to rule when you suffer it gives you a better perspective how to rule because you can relate to how other people are suffering if you suffer you can relate to those who suffer like any time people have children trouble you know like you know they're have trouble with their children i can relate to that i haven't always known how to treat my children and people have uh you know people have struggles with having a small church like i've had people email me and text me oh i'm a pastor of a small church too well i can enter into your sufferings you know i know all about that i gotta work and preach yeah yeah i can enter that suffering well i had covert yeah i can relate to that yeah [Laughter] praise god i'm just happy forgive me i'm just happy today by god's grace but i can relate to those things anything i suffer i can relate to and then that will give me wisdom to make the right judgment now the the scofield said calls this self-humiliation which i agree that's why i put humility in there so when you suffer you really realize knowledge about you boy i'm not as strong as i thought i was i always think that every time well i'm not as healthy as i thought i was mercy right self-judgment oh you know i was i was too loose with myself i should have been more should have been more diligent i kind of let things slide in my life so god allows us to suffer right so we can see our self-knowledge and our self-judgment but then we'll judge correctly on the other side in heaven praise god right i'm sorry other side in the millennium praise god also jesus learned what through suffering he learned obedience so we suffer so we'll obey the word of god next time right and i love that part of it because i want to obey i don't want to lose battles to the devil right i want to defeat the devil praise god amen i want to win these wars amen i don't want to be addicted i don't want to get kicked around i don't want to be the loser i want to be the victor praise god so you suffer so you can learn how to obey next time next time i won't do this next time i won't say that next time i'll say the right thing the third thing jesus says in john 15 2 i'm going to read it so i don't misquote it i know it's about pruning but if i quote it it'll be way off i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that bear through he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit did you catch that sometimes you don't have fruit coming from branches so god prunes you but sometimes you do have good fruits but they get pruned anyway i thought i was really patient why haven't another test of patience right i thought i was i thought i was really joyful i feel like my joy's been taken away so the next time you'll be more joyful right because that's how it is if you trim it right my wife's trimmed the apple tree the last few years it brings forth better branches praise god with more apples so see suffering many times allows you to be even more fruitful in your life and remember the fruits of the spirit love joy peace temperance long suffering goodness gentleness kindness self-control praise god now self-control is not the exact word i think it's different but you understand galatians chapter 5. so we all want to be fruitful right we all want to be obedient we all want to reign but we all don't want to suffer and lastly one benefit of suffering is you become a strength to other people because now think of all the think of all the weaknesses of job we've heard today church yet what does james say about him what a weak man he was james says he was a patient man oh my james 5 11. this blows my mind in one way it blows my mind but another way the blood covers over it all amen the blood covers over it all church now sometimes the the bible will tell us about people's bad points right but james doesn't even mention it he don't say anything about job struggles he just says he was patient behold we count them happy witch endure so when jo when james looks at job's life he looks at a man who endured the suffering in other words god's like i don't really care what you do in between i just want you to become a chris i just want you to stay a christian on the way out right just get through it amen that's what james sees right james says happy are those who endure don't quit just don't turn around just keep going praise god you might mutter some things that you don't like and you might get spayed for it but just keep walking just keep going onward christian's shoulder don't retreat don't run back to the world stay in line with christ amen just endure it just get through it praise god amen we count them happy witch endure job endured months of sores sleepless nights arguments you've heard of the evil words of job no i said it wrong you've heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very harsh pitiful and of tender mercy so when he was there saying okay job tell me what you can do tell me all this that was merciful to job tell me can you make the horses do this can you can you make sure all the birds get their food today come on stand up like a man boy come on that was merciful that was a pitiful god amen so see when you can endure suffering you become a testimony to other people how many want to help other people is anybody out there want to help somebody endure endure just keep running the race praise god how many will do that just keep running the race i'm closing joe passed the test it was job's own words church he said when i am come forth this i will come forth as gold that was when he was strong he said that when he was strong but if you read chapter 42 he does come forth as gold i'm not going to read it because running out of time he was double rewarded with money same number of children remember as i said some will be rewarded in heaven jesus died on the cross he wasn't rewarded here on earth his reward comes later yeah yes his kingdom is not of this world not yet praise god amen at the millennium praise god his kingdom will come the kingdom of the son of david hallelujah but job was double rewarded with money here because he passed the test and job is still the example of patience in the bible just getting through it gritting your teeth and get it i'm going to make it through this i'll get through this help me god to get through without complaining without saying evil words against you let's stand last one listen notice church job never cursed god in all this he never said there's no god he never cursed god all he said now he only right because of blood he only claimed he wasn't righteous he never denied god he said there's he never said there is no god or i curse god or he just said god doesn't judge as righteously as i would only only and yet god still called him perfect i'll tell you when brother bram used that word paradox that's a real word right there he said strange but true this is all strange but this is true he was perfect in god's sight in heaven boy sure wasn't perfect on earth now look at this church in job 42 verse 7 god tells job he said job you've spoken the right things but your friends haven't and so they need to repent now what is he talking about what god meant was job spoke right when he repented because we saw words where job didn't speak right like not every word of job was right but he spoke the right words when he said i'm vile and he said i repent in in dust and ashes that was the right word to say because those three friends they never repented so he says you three friends you go offer sacrifice have my prophet pray for you just like abraham writing king abimelech make sure my prophet prays for you and pharaoh right pharaoh said have abraham pray for you then your women will start having children again yet we know job wasn't sinless with his words he admitted he said i have uttered a lot of things that i did not understand musicians if you'll come here and i believe that's it i don't know if i'll go another sermon but i hope those three sermons was a nice little blessing to start the year with praise god yes i know they sure were for me this has been a beautiful study for me like i said i've never uh i never felt like i've job to the point like i do now and i hope the holy spirit brings all these things to my remembrance especially the part about the purposes of suffering praise god can you play that little song just real slow i know my redeemer lives [Music] and i know i [Music] let our creation testified as this life within me cry [Music] he lives [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] and let me see
