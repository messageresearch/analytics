[4:03] we're going to go to a few chapters in
[4:04] James mainly one and chapter three so
[4:07] chapter one we'll go to first then we'll
[4:10] go to chapter three and we'll start at
[4:12] verse 19 and chapter
[4:17] one and I'll just read these two
[4:20] chapters the verses here and then let
[4:22] you be
[4:23] seated uh James 1 and9 it says wherefore
[4:27] my beloved Brethren let every man be
[4:29] swift to hear slow to speak he says and
[4:32] slow to wrath for the wrath of man
[4:35] worketh not the righteousness of God if
[4:39] any man among you seem to be
[4:41] religious verse 26 I'm sorry if any man
[4:45] among you seem to be religious and

[4:58] Masters I'm sorry
[5:00] moving too fast chapter 3 verse
[5:06] one okay says my brethren be not many
[5:09] Masters knowing that we shall receive
[5:11] the greater condemnation for in many
[5:14] things we offend all but if if if any
[5:18] man offend not in word notice what it
[5:20] says here it says the same as a perfect
[5:23] man and able also to Bridal he says the
[5:27] whole body
[5:29] it says behold we put bits in the H's
[5:32] mouths that we may that they may obey us
[5:35] and we turn about their whole body
[5:37] behold also the ships which though they
[5:40] be a great be so great are driven of
[5:43] fierce winds yet are they turned about
[5:45] with a very small Helm withs soever the
[5:48] governor listed even so the tongue is a
[5:52] small is a little member it says and
[5:53] boasteth great things behold how great a
[5:56] matter a little fire kindleth it says
[5:59] and the the tongue is a fire a world of
[6:01] iniquity so is the tongue among our

[7:46] living and working within us Lord in our
[7:48] name in your name the name of our Lord
[7:50] and Savior Jesus Christ we ask these
[7:52] things and we pray Let the church say
[7:54] amen amen amen you may be seated Saints
[8:01] praise the
[8:10] Lord hey man I
[8:17] uh I didn't know I was going to minister
[8:19] on
[8:20] this
[8:22] tonight I thought it was one thing that
[8:24] the Lord was really dealing with my
[8:26] heart deal dealing with me and my heart
[8:28] on before I left
[8:30] home andan that's been building up for a
[8:33] few weeks there and then uh I got to
[8:37] praying on the plane and I was
[8:39] like you know I was kind of praying in a
[8:41] particular way and I you know my prayers
[8:45] went in a certain
[8:47] direction and I'm just kind of feeling
[8:49] right it's like Lord you know maybe this
[8:52] is it because it's just something that
[8:53] he's still dealing with me on
[8:56] here and then I got into the room
[9:00] and trying to settle down and everything
[9:02] and and I'm ironing my
[9:07] pants and this certain thing came on my
[9:12] heart so I pray it's the will of
[9:16] God um and I pray it'd be a blessing to
[9:20] you
[9:22] okay
[9:24] um so as a topic um I'm I'm bringing it
[9:28] from James
[9:30] um and the Bible actually says
[9:36] uh in James chap 3:2 for in many things
[9:41] we offend
[9:42] all it says if any man offend not in
[9:45] word it says the same as a is a what it
[9:48] says a perfect man so as a title I want
[9:51] to deal with a perfect
[9:54] man amen a perfect
[9:56] man um what I've come to realize
[10:00] and I know brother Jesse deals with this
[10:03] as well as you
[10:04] all um the word of God can
[10:10] sometimes you
[10:14] know it can seem
[10:17] complex right but that's only without an
[10:21] understanding anything you don't
[10:22] understand can sometimes be confusing or
[10:25] like I said seem complex but once
[10:28] understanding comes you like
[10:31] oh wow you know
[10:34] so
[10:36] um I pray that tonight God impart
[10:40] understanding of these things because
[10:41] they're very important
[10:43] right okay so when our opening
[10:46] scriptures just right off you see that
[10:49] God is dealing with through James he's
[10:52] dealing with the church on how they talk
[10:59] all right so this is very important to
[11:02] God
[11:04] obviously right and the number one thing
[11:06] I want to say from this point is uh your
[11:12] speech it comes from a
[11:15] source yes sir the Bible says out of the
[11:18] abundance of the heart the mouth
[11:21] speaks right so it it it
[11:25] matters the source of what you're saying
[11:28] it means a lot amen amen right and and
[11:32] it's I mean and and we really need God
[11:36] Saints because words can be very
[11:40] deceiving you know uh people can mean
[11:44] you wrong they can mean you harm but
[11:46] their words won't it won't indicate
[11:50] that right but they could just be
[11:52] buttering you
[11:54] up you know as they say to come in and
[11:58] and kind of work the work that they
[11:59] really have in their hearts and Jesus
[12:02] you know he he was dealing with those in
[12:04] his day when he was walking on the earth
[12:07] you know and he said he asked him a
[12:09] question you know and it seemed like he
[12:11] was a little baffled by it but in him
[12:13] being God he already knew what was going
[12:16] on but he just kind of posed a question
[12:18] to them and he says how can you being
[12:21] evil speak good
[12:25] things you know he just put that out
[12:28] there for them to think about
[12:30] it you know you know us in your heart
[12:33] you know how you really are but yet you
[12:35] coming to me as though you got some kind
[12:37] of a respect for me and you don't have
[12:41] no respect for me you don't even like me
[12:45] yes you trying to entangle me in my
[12:48] speech but you coming to me and calling
[12:50] me your
[12:51] master yes sir you know so words can be
[12:55] very deceiving so we need God right like
[12:58] young people old people yes I think I'm
[13:03] the oldest one in
[13:07] here yeah you know but we need God
[13:10] because we it's not humanly possible for
[13:13] you and I to be able to navigate in this
[13:16] life victoriously and successfully
[13:20] without God helping us to be able to
[13:23] identify those traps and snares of the
[13:26] enemy
[13:27] sir right see the enemy don't want us to
[13:31] be a perfect man or a
[13:34] woman
[13:36] right he wants us to fly loose at the
[13:39] lips if I can say it like that you know
[13:43] what I mean amen he wants us to uh and
[13:46] and and and I know you experience this
[13:48] too Satan always trying to get us to
[13:51] react in a spur of a
[13:53] moment he spring things on us and he
[13:56] wants you to hurry up and react hurry up
[13:57] and say something
[14:05] praise
[14:06] God Amen but the Bible says let every
[14:09] man and woman be slow to
[14:12] speak amen amen now I have to bring this
[14:16] in at this point because I don't want
[14:18] nobody to be discouraged so much so
[14:21] right but this right here is talking
[14:24] about another
[14:25] level it's not talking about just you
[14:28] know as a a natural man and a natural
[14:30] woman with a natural mind listen that's
[14:33] not converted yet and I want to I want
[14:36] to maybe I need to rephrase that it
[14:38] doesn't matter if you're
[14:39] converted or not converted cuz even if
[14:43] you are converted how many realize you
[14:46] can still walk in the flesh yes sir yes
[14:50] sir
[14:52] Glory the these are Needful Things
[14:55] Saints for us to understand because what
[14:57] happens is you can actually slip up you
[15:00] can allow you can allow an evil spirit
[15:02] to anoint you to bring you down into a
[15:05] carnal frame of mind isn't that right
[15:08] and then you react or you respond or
[15:10] whatever and then the devil leave you
[15:12] hanging out there and in that time what
[15:15] begins to happen you begin to get
[15:17] discouraged amen and then he comes in
[15:20] with his gospel and begin to tell you
[15:23] that you know you ain't got no
[15:24] experience with God
[15:26] right but that's not so Hallelujah you
[15:29] understand the Bible says walk in the
[15:31] spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of
[15:33] the flesh but as we're growing as we're
[15:36] going through the process we will make
[15:41] mistakes but don't wallow in it don't
[15:44] stay that a Bible a righteous man he
[15:46] falls many times seven but he gets back
[15:49] up
[15:53] again see the devil want us to get all
[15:56] dirty and wallow around you know in our
[15:58] good church clothes and stuff like that
[16:00] you want us just wallow all in it you
[16:02] know just keep you down in the dumps in
[16:04] your mind
[16:07] amen amen you know he he has a level of
[16:10] success with that people in the church
[16:12] today are bound by past mistakes that
[16:15] they made that the devil in them in
[16:18] their minds he arises that thing in
[16:20] their
[16:22] memory and he wants them to lay down in
[16:24] that
[16:25] memory and don't rise from that place so
[16:28] that they they lose all
[16:31] hope but the blood of Jesus
[16:35] Christ you understand what I'm
[16:38] saying it already took care of all of
[16:41] that all we got to do is confess amen
[16:44] and repent amen now listen now brother
[16:48] Brandon said when God already done
[16:50] forgave you once you once you come clean
[16:54] now the Lord will convict your heart if
[16:56] you wrong he ain't gonna let us we're
[16:59] we're his children he ain't going to let
[17:00] us get past that cuz he's calling us to
[17:03] a higher calling
[17:06] right so he'll convict you when you're
[17:09] wrong right but he also he once you once
[17:12] you come his provided way you're
[17:15] forgiven right you're forgiv but brother
[17:17] brandom said you got to receive it by
[17:20] faith just like you receive salvation he
[17:24] said you got to actually receive your
[17:26] forgiv meaning you got to accept it
[17:29] by
[17:32] faith so if the enemy is trying to hold
[17:35] you or has been successfully holding you
[17:37] in one way or another for something that
[17:40] you did wrong and you may have actually
[17:42] been guilty if you've confessed that
[17:46] made that right now accept your
[17:48] forgiveness by faith
[17:55] [Applause]
[18:00] so now on that
[18:03] note what we're talking about right now
[18:06] it it's not humanly
[18:09] possible it's not humanly possible for
[18:12] either one of us within
[18:14] ourselves to be this perfect man the
[18:17] Bible talks
[18:18] about that's right can we say praise the
[18:21] Lord the Lord sir I want to deal with
[18:25] this right here if you don't let me read
[18:27] this right here
[18:30] brother brandom says in the message
[18:31] called Look Away to Jesus this is just
[18:33] an encouragement to you he says well he
[18:37] says when I seen that he says I run in
[18:40] I'm sorry no that's not what I
[18:49] want here it is this is speak to this
[18:52] mountain he says don't you fear Church
[18:55] of so even though we're dealing with
[18:57] this tonight
[18:58] no doubt it's going to it it may right
[19:04] it may deal with your heart very
[19:06] stronger I don't know
[19:10] right but whom the Lord
[19:13] loves he chastens them sir he he he's
[19:18] raising he's raising children to be
[19:20] mature spiritual Sons and Daughters of
[19:23] God right so brother brandom says this
[19:27] and speak to this mountain he says don't
[19:28] you fear Church of God I know you got a
[19:31] lot of Scruples among you he says you've
[19:34] got a lot of ups and upsets and downs
[19:37] sets and everything else he said but
[19:40] still you are the Church of the Living
[19:42] God by the grace of God you are he says
[19:45] no matter what you've done or how or how
[19:48] you done God forgive you of your sins he
[19:53] said listen now he says he wants a
[19:57] consecration so this is to encourage us
[20:00] to a more consecrated
[20:06] walk whenever God allows us to see
[20:09] ourselves whenever God permits us to
[20:12] have situations arise in our lives and
[20:14] we find ourselves
[20:17] failing that's just opportunity for
[20:19] growth God is showing us ourself to show
[20:22] us where we need to grow
[20:25] at right he's not showing us those he's
[20:27] not allowing those things to arise and
[20:30] you react wrong or think wrong or
[20:32] whatever just to beat you down just to
[20:34] make you feel bad right but he allows
[20:37] those things to surface because that's
[20:39] what he wants to deal with you on to
[20:41] help you to grow in that
[20:45] [Applause]
[20:50] area so God wants us to grow in our
[20:52] miles
[20:54] tonight praise
[20:56] God okay so I want to I want to go to
[20:59] this scripture real quick if you don't
[21:01] mind
[21:16] um let's go to Luke chapter
[21:21] nine let's go to Luke chapter 9 I want
[21:23] to start at verse 51
[21:28] Luke 9:51 it says and it came to pass
[21:31] when the time was come that he should be
[21:34] received up he steadfastly set his face
[21:36] to go to Jerusalem and sent Messengers
[21:39] before his face and they went and
[21:41] entered into a village of the Samar
[21:43] notice it says of the
[21:45] Samaritans to make ready for him verse
[21:49] 53 says and they did not receive him the
[21:52] Samaritans didn't it says because his
[21:56] face was as though he would go to
[21:58] Jerusalem
[22:00] J so now they had religious
[22:03] differences right remember when he went
[22:06] to the woman at the well she says now
[22:08] the Jews don't have no dealing with
[22:10] Samaritans why are you talking to
[22:12] me right so they had issues between the
[22:16] groups right so when it looked like he
[22:18] was going to go to Jerusalem and the
[22:20] Samaritans saw amen that the servants
[22:23] have come in trying to make ready for
[22:24] him to come into that area to that
[22:26] Village they refused him we don't want
[22:29] him to come because he's going to
[22:30] fellowship with this group over here and
[22:32] we don't want nothing to do with that
[22:34] group and if he's a part of that group
[22:35] if he'll go to that group we don't want
[22:37] nothing to do with his
[22:39] ministry glory denomination of
[22:44] walls amen it brings division you
[22:47] understand but notice this now notice
[22:49] how it says in the in these next few
[22:51] verses here it says they didn't receive
[22:54] him verse 53 verse 54 says and when his
[22:57] disciple
[22:59] James and John saw this they said Lord
[23:02] wil thou that we command fire to come
[23:05] down from heaven and consume them even
[23:09] as Elias
[23:13] did now that seems noteworthy right
[23:16] they're going back to a scriptural
[23:19] example and they're trying to they want
[23:21] to be like the
[23:23] prophet
[23:25] right but they were in a wrong Spirit
[23:28] the Bible says Jesus turned around and
[23:30] rebuked them and said you don't know
[23:33] what Spirit you are of now we just read
[23:35] in the Book of James where it says the
[23:37] tongue is set on fire of
[23:41] hell even though the word was with them
[23:44] the word was not in them yet so that
[23:48] character and that Temperance that they
[23:50] needed Amen to be able to respond
[23:52] correctly to the situ listen Christ was
[23:55] the one that was being refused and look
[23:58] at how he
[24:00] responded you understand what I'm saying
[24:02] he's God and what I'm saying tonight
[24:04] Saints is the only way you and I can
[24:07] actually as as the Bible says be a
[24:10] perfect man or a perfect woman is when
[24:12] the holy God is on the inside of us
[24:15] having the
[24:18] preeminence unless God is there and has
[24:21] the level of control he desires to have
[24:23] we will
[24:25] fail we will find ourselves having wrong
[24:28] responses having wrong thoughts amen
[24:31] allowing the Devil to anoint us to speak
[24:35] things in a wrong Spirit yes
[24:40] sir
[24:44] wow so they had an evil spirit that
[24:47] slipped
[24:48] in and they thought they were standing
[24:51] for the
[24:52] word but they were actually doing damage
[24:59] how much of that is going on around the
[25:01] message right
[25:05] now glory to God saying all the right
[25:10] things you understand what I'm saying
[25:13] saying what the prophet
[25:15] said right but in a wrong
[25:18] Spirit they haven't allowed God to gain
[25:21] control yet in that area of their lives
[25:24] to bring about listen now a god-given
[25:27] temperance
[25:32] and it shows it reflects
[25:34] itself mishandling
[25:39] people
[25:41] criticizing you understand what I'm
[25:43] saying using the word to bludging
[25:45] people's
[25:48] Spirits now that will not that that that
[25:50] does not say at all see now we we that's
[25:52] what I'm saying we need God right
[25:54] because we need proper discernment
[25:59] yes cuz it's not at all that God won't
[26:02] come and talk a little course to his
[26:05] bride when he sees the need for it and
[26:08] I'm going to give you an example of that
[26:10] God will come right down and he'll
[26:12] chasen that
[26:14] bride through his
[26:16] ministry but if you're not
[26:19] spiritual you will take the whole
[26:21] situation in a carnal
[26:23] manner glory and the enemy will take
[26:26] your thoughts and cause him to run
[26:31] South that's what that region is it's
[26:34] down it ain't up it's down isn't that
[26:37] right that's exactly what happened and
[26:38] now you got people having all kind of an
[26:40] offenses and things of that nature CU
[26:42] they can't the Bible oh my now this
[26:45] fresh now I ain't I ain't this nothing
[26:47] amen the Bible says if you can't receive
[26:50] chastisement it says you are bastards
[26:52] and you are not his
[26:56] children huh
[26:59] glory to God Amen so his children have a
[27:03] characteristic built on the inside of
[27:05] them where they're able to submit and
[27:08] humble themselves to the word of God and
[27:11] even if the initial response might be a
[27:14] little too strong or might be out of the
[27:16] way because they are the children of God
[27:18] it'll be brought into
[27:21] track Heen God won't let it stay that
[27:24] way and because they are a child of God
[27:26] brother brandom said that's when I the
[27:29] are dealing with us right amen the word
[27:33] of God he liken it to a woman that has a
[27:37] child and that baby and that mother that
[27:40] growing baby a mean it has certain needs
[27:44] right so it might need
[27:47] iron right so if it needs iron and I
[27:50] know our sister you know a whole lot
[27:52] more about these things than me to my
[27:55] sister Smith there well that baby needs
[27:58] iron right that baby can't talk to the
[28:01] mom and say I need iron but the body is
[28:04] calling for it and because that body is
[28:08] connected to her on the inside of her
[28:10] you know what I'm saying am me all of a
[28:12] sudden it comes to her mind honey I want
[28:15] some
[28:16] liver I want some fried
[28:20] liver I just got and and and and she
[28:22] don't want a little bit of it cuz now
[28:24] she got a craving huh she want to get a
[28:26] whole pack of it amen fry it all up so I
[28:30] can eat it all up because something is
[28:32] calling for this iron on the
[28:35] inside and that husband when he sees the
[28:38] desire of that wife he'll go right out
[28:41] and go get the art deliver she want to
[28:44] satisfy that taste to satisfy that need
[28:48] and brother brandham says when God sees
[28:50] the need that his bride has he said
[28:53] he'll get a minister bring him to the
[28:55] pull pit and Supply to that bride with
[28:58] your theophany is calling
[29:02] for Spiritual
[29:05] vitamins

[29:09] topnotch amen uh
[29:12] Entre prepare by the hand of God to give
[29:16] to his bride that she might feed on the
[29:18] things of God that she might
[29:23] grow amen growing up into a perfect man
[29:28] glory to God the stature of the fullness
[29:31] of
[29:33] God by the power of the Holy
[29:39] Ghost so with a convert with an
[29:41] unconverted
[29:43] nature these men was able to be listen
[29:48] oh my you know how that that Spirit just
[29:51] slipped in so
[29:53] quick just in that moment that Spirit
[29:56] anointed them had them thinking they
[29:58] were standing for the right things and
[30:00] had that come out of their mou shall we
[30:02] call down fire to come down upon them
[30:05] Christ said you don't know what Spirit
[30:06] you ow that's
[30:11] right that wasn't the expression of a
[30:13] perfect
[30:19] man one thing I realized that I was
[30:22] considering these things the Lord allows
[30:25] things to come into you and our life Our
[30:28] Lives the Lord allows
[30:32] misunderstandings and
[30:34] arguments to actually come
[30:37] about in a home of a
[30:41] family for the purpose of
[30:46] growth he allows you to be tried in the
[30:49] very area that he wants you to grow in
[31:00] so notice this let's bring it down a
[31:03] little further First Peter chapter 2
[31:06] starting at verse
[31:09] 21 this is
[31:11] how see in order to be a perfect man the
[31:15] perfect one has to be inside of
[31:19] you and all he's going to do is just
[31:22] live his life through
[31:24] you as we yield as as we submit now he
[31:28] has to train us he has to he has to
[31:30] teach us how to
[31:32] yield he has to bring us to a yield cuz
[31:35] we ain't used to that we used to we're
[31:37] used to living Our Lives according to
[31:39] whatever we've been we we become
[31:40] accustomed to for all the years we've
[31:42] been on this Earth for whatever age you
[31:44] are amen and the Holy Ghost is trying to
[31:47] establish amen this new creation these
[31:50] new ways amen within a vessel that's not
[31:53] that they're not they're not used to
[31:56] this I want to say this right now while
[31:59] it's on my
[32:02] mind you can have a human
[32:07] Temperance and you can become confused
[32:10] by that you can say well brother I do
[32:13] pretty good holding my
[32:14] tongue you
[32:17] know and you got to try real you you
[32:20] fighting or you got to try real hard cuz
[32:22] if something catch you the wrong way
[32:25] unexpectedly you ain't going to have
[32:26] your guard up like you going to be able
[32:28] to Be watchful like that it's got to be
[32:30] something that's a part of who you
[32:32] are if it's on The Human Side listen it
[32:36] will fail time and time and time and
[32:40] time again so that you know it's on the
[32:43] human side but when it's established by
[32:46] God when it's been quickened on the
[32:48] inside of you by the spirit of God
[32:53] himself I'm going read to you a few
[32:55] examples here I said second p Peter
[32:58] let's go there it says for even here
[33:01] unto were ye called because Christ also
[33:05] suffered for us leaving us an example
[33:08] that we should follow his steps it says
[33:10] who did no sin neither was G found in
[33:14] his mouth notice what it says in verse
[33:16] 23 it says who when he was
[33:19] reviled revil not
[33:23] again that word revile it means to
[33:26] criticize in a in an abusive or angrily
[33:30] insulting
[33:31] manner it says to say unpleasant things
[33:35] to or about
[33:37] someone amen so it says when he was
[33:40] reviled he did what Saints he reviled
[33:43] not
[33:45] again amen he's our example amen when
[33:49] when people are being mean to you
[33:50] listening to the Lord will allow people
[33:52] to be mean to you why he wants you to
[33:55] grow in your mouth
[33:58] he wants you to grow in that way amen he
[34:00] wants you to be able to sit there hear
[34:02] the insulting uh manner in which
[34:04] somebody is dealing with you totally
[34:07] unmar amen he want he wants to allow you
[34:10] to be tried in that
[34:14] way he knows you will fail in the
[34:17] beginning but he knows you'll grow from
[34:19] that
[34:23] point and he's going to let that same
[34:26] test come right right back
[34:29] around but listen when God really got a
[34:32] hold of you you become so
[34:36] unconscious you you you're not having to
[34:38] try to remember the answers to the
[34:40] test but the Bible say be slow to speak
[34:44] be slow to speak be slow to don't get
[34:46] upset don't get up you ain't gonna be
[34:48] none of that glory amen it's just going
[34:51] to be a natural response amen and then
[34:54] then and then listen you will do it
[34:56] unconsciously and the next thing you
[34:58] know God will come down and have
[34:59] fellowship with you and he'll say you
[35:01] see how you passed that
[35:03] test glory to God and then you'll look
[35:06] back you'll say oh Lord that is right
[35:09] amen Lord I've grown I I'm not the
[35:11] person I used to be no more
[35:14] Lord amen and that's exactly right it'll
[35:17] be a time of
[35:18] rejoicing to see that the devil ain't
[35:21] got the power over you that he used to
[35:25] have G glory to God god notice this
[35:29] Saints now these are people with the
[35:31] Holy Ghost here let's go to First
[35:33] Corinthians chapter 4 I like this
[35:37] everybody all right I'm having a good
[35:40] time
[35:41] now I know I know that that ain't always
[35:44] a good sign to Saints when ministers
[35:47] having a good time because that mean
[35:49] he he can just go and go and go and
[35:54] go amen we ain't going to keep you long
[35:56] tonight praise God but I am having a
[35:59] good time you know what it's a wonderful
[36:00] spirit amen this is a testimony of the
[36:03] work of God that's taking place among
[36:05] you Saints yes it is yes it is man Glory
[36:10] all right where we at what did I say I
[36:13] said where 1 Corinthians chapter 4
[36:16] starting at verse 10 it says we are
[36:19] fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise
[36:23] in Christ he says we are weak he said
[36:26] now this is the ministry speak now he
[36:28] says but ye are strong he says ye are
[36:31] honorable and we are despised
[36:35] normally God uses his ministry to
[36:38] Pioneer Works in certain areas like he's
[36:42] anointed brother Jesse to work in this
[36:44] area and he's been pioneering it's God
[36:46] the one that's anointing him to do it
[36:48] but he's reaching out in the area trying
[36:51] to find people amen that that that are
[36:53] heed the call of the Holy Ghost trying
[36:56] to find elect seed amen but in doing so
[36:59] and in having to express what his
[37:01] beliefs are and what have you amen it
[37:04] causes amen it causes offense to be
[37:07] taken people that have never heard this
[37:09] manner of Doctrine before amen they they
[37:11] they they they kind of take it in the
[37:13] wrong way and they begin to slander and
[37:16] they begin to bring about all kinds of
[37:18] of unfavorable things that a man don't
[37:20] want to deal
[37:22] with but he's doing it for the sake of
[37:24] the people you understand what I'm
[37:27] saying so Paul is saying we're being
[37:29] defamed but you're being honored you
[37:32] know we're having to push this work
[37:33] forward and we're having to suffer the
[37:35] scars and the battles that come along
[37:38] from the that come from that enemy's
[37:40] realm that's trying to hinder the work
[37:43] of God from going forth because it knows
[37:45] we have light and it don't want nobody
[37:48] to be able to hear this light amen
[37:50] because he understands it'll bring about
[37:52] a
[37:53] change so they fight us and they they
[37:55] they take us through all kinds of stuff
[37:57] but because we understand our purpose
[37:59] and who we are amen now with with the
[38:02] anointing of the Holy Ghost he said we
[38:03] suffer this
[38:06] gladly notice what he comes on down and
[38:08] says here Saints talking about a perfect
[38:11] man now verse 11 even unto this present
[38:13] hour we both hunger and thirst and are
[38:16] naked and are buffeted and have no
[38:18] certain Dwelling Place he says and labor
[38:21] verse 12 working with our our own hands
[38:24] he says being reviled
[38:28] now the Bible says Christ was our
[38:31] example now we see in Christ's life
[38:33] according to what we just read in First
[38:35] Peter he was reviled and he reviled not
[38:37] again so now you see a man that's full
[38:41] of the Holy
[38:43] Ghost right and without him having to
[38:46] memorize a scripture or trying to replay
[38:49] something in his mind he's naturally
[38:52] living out because it's not him Paul
[38:54] said it's not me that liveth he said but
[38:56] it's Christ that liveth in me you
[38:59] understand what I'm saying amen and so
[39:01] Paul down is saying here being reviled
[39:04] in return We
[39:07] blessed we don't let amen the strong
[39:10] speech that's coming from people that's
[39:12] intended to hurt us bring us into a
[39:14] carnal frame of mind that we lash back
[39:17] out at them
[39:19] again amen but there's a power that's
[39:22] residing on the inside of us that
[39:25] enables us to hold our peace amen and
[39:28] whereas it looks like the situation
[39:30] might Merit us to lash back out we don't
[39:33] what we do in turn is we
[39:38] bless somebody giving you down in the
[39:41] country huh amen and you sitting there
[39:45] wondering what's wrong with this
[39:47] person amen what is it God is allowing
[39:50] you to be
[39:52] tested glory to God Amen to see if
[39:55] you've grown to the point to where when
[39:57] you revived you are
[40:01] blessed they telling you off as hard as
[40:03] they can and then you turn around and
[40:06] say God bless you
[40:09] sir God bless you man said what you
[40:13] say you heaping like hot coals on their
[40:17] head amen am man they don't know what to
[40:20] do with that amen and the devil don't
[40:22] know what to do with that because now
[40:24] you ain't playing into his field
[40:31] Yes
[40:34] Man praise the
[40:41] Lord Mark chapter 7 I'm G try to bring
[40:45] this down to a close Mark chapter
[40:47] 7 starting at verse
[40:52] 14 amen it says and when he had called
[40:55] all the people unto him
[40:58] he said unto them hearken unto me every
[41:00] one of you and understand Mark 7 I inan
[41:02] verse 15 now it says there is nothing
[41:05] from without a man that entering into
[41:07] him can defile him but the things which
[41:10] come out of him those are they that
[41:12] defile the
[41:14] man amen it
[41:17] says if any man have ears to hear let
[41:21] him here and when he was entered into
[41:23] the house from the people his disciples
[41:26] asked him concerning the parable and he
[41:28] said unto them are ye all are ye so
[41:30] without understanding also do ye not
[41:33] perceive that whatsoever thing from from
[41:36] without entereth into the man it cannot
[41:38] defile
[41:41] him everybody read that
[41:44] right praise
[41:46] God so it's okay to eat some sweet
[41:53] sometimes praise the Lord it says verse
[41:56] 21 for for from within out of the heart
[42:00] of men proceede evil what thoughts
[42:03] adulteries fornications murders and
[42:06] that's dependent upon the spirit that's
[42:09] residing the spirit that's dominating
[42:12] that's what causes certain issues to
[42:14] come out of that
[42:15] heart yes sir amen the lust of whatever
[42:18] spirit is anointing a person it begins
[42:21] to issue out from that person's heart
[42:25] amen it's lust it's
[42:27] desires what it's feeling that person's
[42:30] with what it's feeling that person's
[42:31] mind with and that translates down into
[42:34] actions and things of that nature right
[42:37] sir verse 22 thefts covetousness
[42:39] wickedness deceit lasciviousness it says
[42:42] and an evil eye blasphemy Pride
[42:45] foolishness it says all these things all
[42:48] these evil things come from within it
[42:51] says and that's what defiles a man now
[42:53] what caught me was the word the meaning
[42:56] of the word
[42:58] defile the meaning of the word defile it
[43:01] means this Saints it means to make
[43:04] unclean or
[43:06] impure it says to corrupt the Purity or
[43:11] Perfection it also means to
[43:14] debase now debase is the one that really
[43:18] caught me right so I need to understand
[43:21] what debase mean and when I looked up
[43:23] debase I was like Lord look at this and
[43:25] we're going to hit a few things here to
[43:26] let you know how important amen us
[43:29] having this this quality and this
[43:32] characteristic of God living in our
[43:34] lives
[43:36] is the word debase it means to lower in
[43:42] status
[43:44] esteem quality or
[43:50] character I believe there's a scripture
[43:52] that says answer not a fool according to
[43:55] his folly L you be like him right that
[44:00] devil want to take you from where you
[44:01] are and he want to pull you
[44:05] down he want to pull your the amen he
[44:08] want to pull your testimony down he want
[44:11] to pull your life down that's why Paul
[44:14] said let us lay aside every what wait
[44:17] and the sin which does so easily beset
[44:19] us those Devils hang weights on us
[44:22] things that hinder us when you got
[44:24] weights on you how fast can you run
[44:27] you can't run too Swift right you
[44:29] weighed down you getting heavy amen you
[44:32] getting bogged down in your spirit yes
[44:34] sir when you coming to church you
[44:36] hearing the right things or whatever but
[44:38] because you allowing the Devil to hang
[44:40] his
[44:42] ornaments on your life glory to God in
[44:46] your mind you can't go you you you can't
[44:48] enter into a real
[44:50] Victory so now you got to go and pray
[44:54] and ask the Lord to show you how is this
[44:56] happening where where am I allowing this
[44:58] to come in at Lord so he can show it up
[45:02] and give you strength to be able to go
[45:05] resist that devil and close that door
[45:08] lock
[45:15] itall praise the Lord Saints yes
[45:21] sir I don't want to allow the
[45:24] enemy to debase me
[45:32] amen this can't be achieved outside of a
[45:35] consecrated
[45:38] walk the level of importance that
[45:41] reading your Bible and praying hes in
[45:43] your
[45:44] life it seems so simple but why the
[45:47] devil fight so hard with those two
[45:51] things because it creates the right
[45:53] atmosphere it gets your mind on the
[45:56] right thing
[45:58] and when your mind is on the right
[45:59] things when wrong things come up hey man
[46:02] it's almost like
[46:03] you you know you be some place you be so
[46:06] far in in God's world you don't even
[46:08] really know what's going
[46:10] on somebody can be and it it done happen
[46:13] to me before I ain't I ain't nobody I
[46:15] ain't putting myself on no pedestal but
[46:17] somebody got upset with me I'm driving
[46:20] and I don't even know I did anything
[46:22] wrong and somebody just going off on me
[46:24] and I'm hearing horns and whatever but
[46:26] I'm just listening to the
[46:29] message I'm
[46:32] oblivious then all of a sudden I see
[46:34] somebody Zoom I did they zoom up beside
[46:36] me and cut I like what's wrong with that
[46:38] person I ain't even know they was upset
[46:40] I ain't know I did nothing wrong but am
[46:42] man you can get so lost in the things of
[46:45] God until the devil can't even brother B
[46:48] say he can't even find
[46:50] you to be able to draw you down into a
[46:53] cornal frame of
[46:55] mind that's the importance of reading
[46:57] our Bible and praying Saints it sets the
[47:00] right tone in our
[47:04] Spirits yes that ain't nothing but the

[48:06] spirit so that you can have the same
[48:08] testimony that Paul had Paul said the
[48:11] Holy Ghost God himself is working in me
[48:15] mightily that you understand that's the
[48:17] place that we're growing up to
[48:22] Saints to where there is a greater
[48:25] reflection of the Holy God on the inside
[48:27] of you and
[48:29] I can we say praise the Lord the Lord
[48:32] and just to help you with that thought
[48:34] part just so you understand now cuz some
[48:37] people feel safe when they think it and
[48:38] don't say it I want to take you out of
[48:41] your safety
[48:42] zone the Bible says in Proverbs 24 verse
[48:47] 9 everybody turn that with me or you

[49:13] it in the sight of God is
[49:18] sin don't get scared though let's go and
[49:21] pray
[49:22] more say Lord I Ain know this was here
[49:25] now you telling me that even if I think
[49:28] it so Lord I ain't safe in my thoughts
[49:31] or in my spirit Lord help me to get all
[49:33] together
[49:38] right okay coming down to a close I got
[49:41] many more areas here I could cover but I
[49:44] want to leave you with a few things here
[49:46] by the grace of
[49:54] God this message here is statue of a
[49:57] perfect
[49:58] man brother brandham says Temperance
[50:01] does it mean stop drinking alcohol here
[50:04] he says either he he's referring to the
[50:07] scripture there he says no no Temperance
[50:09] does it mean alcoholic cure he says not
[50:12] in this case he says this is Bible
[50:16] Temperance he says holy spirit
[50:18] Temperance that's just one of the lust
[50:21] of the flesh talking about the alcoholic
[50:23] part that's just one of the lust of the
[50:25] flesh but we're talking about Holy
[50:28] Spirit Temperance he says that means how
[50:31] to control your
[50:32] tongue he says no matter he says listen
[50:35] not not be a
[50:38] Tattler spreading
[50:40] gossip praise
[50:42] God spreading
[50:45] rumors having an issue with somebody and
[50:48] quickly going and talking to somebody
[50:50] else about it versus talking to God
[50:53] about it amen and I'm saying it's very
[50:56] care we need to be very careful in those
[50:58] areas because how many realize because
[51:01] we're human we can misunderstand things
[51:04] we can misinterpret things so again the
[51:07] Bible says be slow to speak slow to R
[51:11] quick to
[51:13] listen hold up don't be so sharp don't
[51:16] be so fast with what you want to say
[51:18] even what you what you allow yourself to
[51:20] think go and pray about it allow God to
[51:23] give you clarity
[51:27] then you might find it ain't even no it
[51:30] wasn't even no issue at all I was wrong
[51:32] I misunderstood
[51:35] that praise the
[51:37] Lord watch what he goes on to say
[51:40] Saints how do you control your tongue
[51:43] not be a Tattler how to control your
[51:46] temper not fly off every time anybody
[51:49] speaks cross to
[51:52] you he says Oh my he says listen to this
[51:55] Saints
[51:57] this this right here is a vital
[51:59] part of the further part of your
[52:03] growth understand that he says boy a lot
[52:07] of us going to fall off before we get
[52:10] started aren't we he says see then we
[52:13] wonder why listen to this now then we
[52:15] wonder why God is not in his church
[52:18] doing Miracles and things that they used
[52:22] to
[52:24] do so because of LA ATT in the
[52:27] temperance which is holy ghost
[52:29] controlled in the soul of a man or a
[52:32] woman Amen to help them to have a a
[52:35] proper speech a proper response in
[52:38] thought and in word amen as a result of
[52:42] that being lacking in the church he said
[52:44] it hinders the moving of the Holy Ghost
[52:47] amongst the
[52:53] people he says add these things add
[52:56] Temperance to it oh Temperance how to
[52:59] answer in kindness when wrath is spoken
[53:03] to you scripturally we saw where they
[53:06] said in being reviled they said we
[53:09] blessed that was a testimony of the life
[53:12] that they entered into with Jesus Christ
[53:15] himself it wasn't just a
[53:18] religion you understand it wasn't just
[53:20] an intellectual knowledge but it was a
[53:24] life amen and that same Holy Ghost
[53:27] echoing these things through his Prophet
[53:29] right here praise
[53:32] God he says don't jump out and roll up
[53:35] your sleeves now see not that but talk
[53:38] with Godly love Temperance kindness is
[53:43] that the way he says you want to be he
[53:45] says when you're riled upon R not back
[53:49] let him be your example he says when you
[53:52] got the right kind of temperance like he
[53:55] had he says it'll vulcanize he says if
[53:58] you have it he says just a manmade
[54:00] halfway soued up belief of temperance he
[54:03] says oh I ought to slap him
[54:07] down I done heard people I done heard
[54:11] people around the
[54:13] mess huh they still a work in progress
[54:17] right and it
[54:20] shows cuz they talk about putting
[54:22] religion down and picking it back up
[54:25] again and what have you whe you you
[54:27] don't know what Spirit you
[54:29] are
[54:31] huh right now your tongue ain't anointed
[54:34] by the right place the right
[54:37] Source amen I ought to slap him down but
[54:41] maybe I better not listen this real talk
[54:43] now I ought to slap him down but maybe I
[54:46] better not cuz they might put my my name
[54:48] in the paper about
[54:51] it huh that devil trying to come in and
[54:55] anoint
[54:56] to bring about actions that he want to
[54:58] see come to pass Amen to see his lust
[55:00] carried out he says that ain't the kind
[55:02] of temperance he's talking about he says
[55:04] don't try to add that he says it won't
[55:07] work but when you can really with the
[55:09] sweetness from your heart forgive every
[55:12] man and hold your
[55:14] peace you ain't always got to respond
[55:18] somebody could be dead
[55:22] wrong and the Holy Spirit anoints you
[55:25] the Bible say says as a sheep before her
[55:28] shearers was Dum it says he opened not
[55:31] his
[55:32] mouth totally innocent no wrongdoing but
[55:37] he knew it was the will of God and he
[55:40] was subjecting himself to what the word
[55:43] was calling for concerning what his life
[55:46] was to
[55:47] display but when that same person is on
[55:49] the inside of you and I you know what
[55:51] it'll do it'll have us hold our speech
[55:55] yes sir yes sir
[55:56] can we say praise the
[55:58] Lord everybody okay now you know I got
[56:02] to show you the
[56:04] scripture praise
[56:07] God oh my where we at here it is Psalms
[56:12] 39
[56:14] verse1 Psalms 39 verse1 it says to the
[56:17] chief musician even to judian a Psalm of
[56:22] David Psalms 39 verse1 he says I and
[56:26] this is David now listen a man without
[56:29] the Holy Ghost but the anointing of the
[56:31] Holy Ghost was upon his
[56:35] life I said I will take heed to my ways
[56:39] notice this now that I do what that I
[56:41] sin not with my
[56:44] tongue David listen when you living in
[56:46] that place with God when you reading
[56:49] your Bible when you praying right when
[56:51] you having a daily walk with God God
[56:54] brings you conscious
[56:57] you understand what I'm saying God
[56:58] brings you conscious of things amen
[57:01] because David had this daily walk with
[57:04] God this is the effects of the Holy
[57:06] Ghost in his life amen he said I want to
[57:09] be so mindful of you Lord that I that I
[57:12] don't want to sin with my tongue I don't
[57:14] want to say the wrong
[57:17] thing he was guarding his heart with all
[57:20] diligence for as much as he could in the
[57:23] state that he was in Hallelujah
[57:27] praise the
[57:28] Lord amen he says he goes on to say I
[57:32] will keep my mouth notice he was he
[57:35] David was pursuing the life of a perfect
[57:37] man even though he couldn't be perfect
[57:40] in that hour it was in his heart to be
[57:43] perfect amen he says here I will keep my
[57:46] mouth with a
[57:47] bridal while the wicked is before me he
[57:51] says I was Dum with silence he says I
[57:55] held my people peace even from good and
[57:58] my sorrows were stirred it wasn't that
[58:01] he wasn't affected by things that was
[58:03] going on around him but he had become so
[58:06] anointed by the spirit of God until God
[58:09] wasn't allowing him to react like a
[58:11] normal man
[58:15] would that's the ER that that's how you
[58:18] come into to be a per or to express a
[58:21] perfect man or a perfect woman yes sir
[58:23] yes sir it's when you give way you yield
[58:25] your yourself to a mighty God that's
[58:28] able to come on the inside brother
[58:30] brandom said you ain't even got to write
[58:31] to your own
[58:34] opinion can we say praise the
[58:37] Lord cuz God say I want you to love me
[58:40] with all of your thoughts all of your
[58:42] mind all of your heart all of your
[58:45] strength I want you to love me with all
[58:47] that mean you giving it over you're
[58:49] acknowledging me as being Lord and you
[58:51] allowing me to come down and control
[58:54] every facet of your life
[58:57] amen you know my way is a better way
[58:59] you've come to learn that now you don't
[59:01] trust yourself no more your heart is
[59:04] deceitful you've come to see that now
[59:07] and now you want a better way which
[59:08] you've come to understand it's my way so
[59:12] you're humbling yourself to me now
[59:14] allowing me to take my Throne inside of
[59:16] your soul that I might manifest
[59:20] myself I believe it was at the end of
[59:22] the sardian church age I've been all
[59:25] over the place I've been digging all
[59:27] into the church I just been having a
[59:30] good old spiritual Buffet man but at the
[59:32] end I believe it's a is of the sardes
[59:34] and church age there was there was
[59:36] tongues and interpretations that came
[59:41] forth praise God and God is was one part
[59:45] I honed in
[59:46] on God spoke about a person giving
[59:50] themselves over to him that he might
[59:53] glorify his name in his name in that
[59:55] person
[59:58] huh God want to glorify his person
[1:00:02] inside of earn vessels we are that
[1:00:06] people can we say praise the Lord praise
[1:00:09] the Lord amen Proverbs
[1:00:12] 1429 it says he that is slow to wrath is
[1:00:15] of a great understanding but he that is
[1:00:18] Hasty of spirit exalteth
[1:00:21] Folly I'm going to read that from the
[1:00:23] Amplified version that same verse
[1:00:25] chapter
[1:00:26] verse proverbs 14:29 he who is slow to
[1:00:30] anger has great understanding that means
[1:00:33] he's learned something from
[1:00:35] God Amen the Bible says the wrath of man
[1:00:38] it don't work the righteousness of God
[1:00:41] isn't that
[1:00:43] right Amplified again he who is slow to
[1:00:46] anger has great understanding and
[1:00:48] profits from his selfcontrol but he who
[1:00:52] is quick tempered exposes and exalts his
[1:00:55] own foolishness it says for all to see
[1:01:00] ain't that right a man that get up that
[1:01:02] get upet quick he just he he get the
[1:01:04] blurting out stuff and just like a
[1:01:09] beast
[1:01:12] huh I was that man yes
[1:01:16] sir I am what I am right now by the
[1:01:19] grace of God that's right and I ain't
[1:01:22] going to call myself a perfect man I'm
[1:01:24] going to let the Lord do that
[1:01:27] mean I want him to express it out of my
[1:01:31] life it's not important for me to call
[1:01:34] myself something no more I want God to
[1:01:38] testify I want him to show who I am
[1:01:41] through him living it in me and
[1:01:44] expressing it through me if somebody
[1:01:46] called me a Christian it's not going to
[1:01:48] be because I say I'm a Christian don't
[1:01:50] let them see that I'm a Christian let it
[1:01:53] be like the book of Acts
[1:01:56] yes all right I know I said I'mma close
[1:01:59] a few
[1:02:00] times forgive me
[1:02:04] Saints I'm having too good of a time man
[1:02:06] I'm I'm trying to stop I'm trying to
[1:02:09] stop now all
[1:02:11] right so many nuggets Lord have
[1:02:17] mercy okay so brother Brandon was told
[1:02:19] by God ahead of time about a trap that
[1:02:22] was set for him by
[1:02:24] Satan okay
[1:02:26] but that trap ended up being was a young
[1:02:29] man and a young woman listen that God
[1:02:32] permitted God permitted that
[1:02:35] young brother brother brother Jesse them
[1:02:39] deacons brother Brown said that deacons
[1:02:41] couldn't get them to
[1:02:44] stop if somebody getting unruly in the
[1:02:47] church service the Deacon supposed to go
[1:02:49] and just firmly encourag
[1:02:54] them huh somebody the preacher preaching
[1:02:57] and somebody in the Pew holling out all
[1:03:00] kind of stuff drowning them out the
[1:03:02] Deacon is supposed to go and firmly
[1:03:04] encourage the person to depart the
[1:03:09] sanctuary but because it was a test that
[1:03:12] God allowed to
[1:03:14] come God didn't allow the deacons to
[1:03:17] enter into that frame of
[1:03:19] mind cuz God intended for the whole
[1:03:22] thing to play out because it was a test
[1:03:24] for his prophet and I I want you to
[1:03:26] understand that I man it's
[1:03:28] so it was a test for his Prophet listen
[1:03:33] it was a test for his Prophet that was
[1:03:36] going to dictate his advancement to the
[1:03:40] further part of the ministry that God
[1:03:42] ordained for him amen
[1:03:45] amen so God told him it's a trap set for
[1:03:49] you the young couple came
[1:03:52] in doing everything
[1:04:01] yeah just carrying
[1:04:04] on the deacons say they couldn't get
[1:04:07] them to
[1:04:08] stop that didn't make sense so I said
[1:04:12] God had to keep them from doing that
[1:04:14] because God wanted the whole test to
[1:04:16] play out now brother brandom is
[1:04:18] preaching and he looks out and he sees
[1:04:20] the stirring trouble and it's drawing
[1:04:22] the attention of the people and he says
[1:04:24] hey young man don't do that if you want
[1:04:27] to if you want to deal with her like
[1:04:28] that go and get a hotel room or what
[1:04:30] have you but don't do that in the
[1:04:32] service of God he went on trying to
[1:04:35] preach and it went back out again they
[1:04:37] start getting worse and brother bradam
[1:04:39] warned him again and he said the man
[1:04:41] just outright laughed at him he says
[1:04:43] then he knew that that was the
[1:04:47] test and right when that happened all of
[1:04:49] a sudden a voice came in Saints listen
[1:04:52] to
[1:04:54] this and then when I was turned I said
[1:04:57] don't and something said to me say what
[1:05:00] you
[1:05:01] will talking about a perfect
[1:05:04] man talking about Godly Temperance it
[1:05:07] says say what you will and it'll be done
[1:05:10] I stood there Mr Mercy the tape boy and
[1:05:13] all of them standing brother Fred and
[1:05:15] many of them standing present and
[1:05:16] perspiration and just running from me
[1:05:19] something says say blindness it'll be
[1:05:21] blind say
[1:05:24] death talk about death and life is in
[1:05:26] the power of the
[1:05:28] tongue when those young kids came out
[1:05:31] those untrained kids that the prophet
[1:05:33] kind of said that they were possibly Pro
[1:05:35] probably you know following a wrong
[1:05:37] example from their parents and their
[1:05:39] mindset toward the prophet he's walking
[1:05:42] along there and those little kids come
[1:05:44] out making fun of the prophet and his
[1:05:47] you know missing hair and whatever you
[1:05:49] know and then all of a sudden the
[1:05:51] prophet just turned around and call for
[1:05:52] those Bears to come
[1:05:54] out and it killed I think it what 42 of
[1:05:57] the kids or something like that
[1:06:04] right so here it is God got his prophet
[1:06:07] in this situation and he says say death
[1:06:10] it'll be death you know what would have
[1:06:14] happened but the Holy Spirit warned him
[1:06:17] he says be careful what you
[1:06:23] say he says and they'll pack them out
[1:06:25] say what you will he says I couldn't
[1:06:28] speak I love this I couldn't move he
[1:06:31] says and it just left me left me with
[1:06:33] those
[1:06:35] options they disrupt in the service
[1:06:38] listen the devil wanted him to get
[1:06:39] caught up in the
[1:06:41] moment glory to God saints is't that how
[1:06:44] it happens the devil will caused a
[1:06:46] situation to be stirred no matter where
[1:06:49] you might be or whatever cuz he's always
[1:06:51] got his eye on you because you're the
[1:06:52] one that's amen subjecting yourself to
[1:06:55] the truth
[1:06:57] amen so if you find yourself you if
[1:07:00] somehow you begin to feel like w these
[1:07:02] things happening to me I want you to
[1:07:04] understand it's because you're
[1:07:07] special huh and the de and those demons
[1:07:10] see you special amen so they want to
[1:07:13] disrupt your world they want to keep you
[1:07:15] as frustrated as possible as stressed as
[1:07:18] possible feeling as unloved as possible
[1:07:21] amen they want to pour it all out to get
[1:07:24] you downright to
[1:07:28] discouraged cuz they want your mind to
[1:07:30] get so far away from God and to drown so
[1:07:32] much in your world of whatever it's
[1:07:34] trying to create in your mind yes sir
[1:07:38] huh yes that's exactly what's happening
[1:07:41] I I know it I'm telling you praise

[1:07:49] must I do now what I what I what I what

[1:07:59] life this was Temperance on
[1:08:04] display yes
[1:08:07] sir I thought God what must I do I
[1:08:11] turned and he stood there and his face
[1:08:15] white now he he know something that
[1:08:17] happen now that spirit that was on him
[1:08:20] now he got
[1:08:22] scared huh he stopped all his
[1:08:24] foolishness amen cuz amen they that the
[1:08:27] presence of God was

[1:08:36] thought what must I
[1:08:39] say then I turned and washed this Saints

[1:09:03] yielded mature Son of God that has so
[1:09:07] surrendered his life to that one to his
[1:09:10] King to his Lord to his husband until he
[1:09:13] was able to control his
[1:09:15] thoughts which in turn enabled his
[1:09:18] speech to be controlled to where now it
[1:09:20] ain't being set on fire of hell but his
[1:09:23] tongue was set Ablaze from heaven
[1:09:27] amen that was the Holy
[1:09:29] Ghost saying out of that prophet's mouth
[1:09:33] I forgive you of your he said for I knew
[1:09:35] what I said it happened so
[1:09:37] fast yes amen isn't that how you want it
[1:09:41] that's how I wanted that's why God gave
[1:09:44] us this example to show us listen he was
[1:09:46] a sin born man that had many mistakes in
[1:09:50] his lives but amen but he was a Son of
[1:09:52] God that was able to go through the
[1:09:54] process of being chastised and dealt
[1:09:57] with and taught by God to bring him to
[1:09:59] this place of
[1:10:01] maturity Amen to where it was no more
[1:10:04] him now it was Christ stepping
[1:10:08] forth that's the real purpose of the
[1:10:11] prophet's Ministry is to show us the an
[1:10:15] example of how it really should
[1:10:23] be and must have been he says just the
[1:10:27] right thing to
[1:10:28] say he says it was God listen to this it
[1:10:33] was God trying a reaction on an
[1:10:37] action that's why the deacons couldn't
[1:10:39] do nothing with it God said no deacons
[1:10:42] don't you even think to go any further
[1:10:44] with apprehending them you let them sit
[1:10:47] right there cuz I want my Prophet I want
[1:10:49] to I want what I've instilled in him to
[1:10:53] come out and be put on display
[1:10:59] he said it was God trying do you
[1:11:01] understand I want you to going forward
[1:11:02] now I pray the Lord help you to become
[1:11:05] mindful when these attacks come to
[1:11:08] you that is God allowing
[1:11:12] a what did he say he said God Allowing
[1:11:15] God trying a reaction on an action he's
[1:11:18] letting a certain action come to you cuz
[1:11:20] he's trying your
[1:11:23] reaction may God make us mindful of each
[1:11:26] one of these
[1:11:27] times so that we can properly pass these
[1:11:34] tests glory to God he says that he said
[1:11:38] that night was it was revealed to me
[1:11:41] that I said the right thing I know it
[1:11:44] was all leading to something but what
[1:11:46] was it what what to do watch this you
[1:11:50] know you he said you know you have to
[1:11:51] watch with a Divine gift what you do
[1:11:53] with it remember what Moses did so I
[1:11:56] must have said the right thing I forgive
[1:11:59] you cuz Moses smoked the
[1:12:01] rock right he got he the people got on
[1:12:03] his
[1:12:04] nerves he said you bunch of rebels shall
[1:12:07] I fetch you water out of this rock huh
[1:12:11] SM
[1:12:12] it he was upset praise God Amen and God
[1:12:16] said now
[1:12:18] Moses what you just did you Sanctified
[1:12:21] yourself in the eyes of the people he
[1:12:23] said but you didn't glorify me
[1:12:26] and because you did this you look all
[1:12:28] around but you ain't going over into
[1:12:30] that Promised Land naturally speaking
[1:12:34] right all right but this is the point I
[1:12:37] want to get to
[1:12:39] Saints he says Jesus said you don't know
[1:12:42] what kind of a spirit you are he says
[1:12:45] the son of man came to save life I'm
[1:12:47] sorry where am I yeah yeah the son of
[1:12:50] man came to save life not to destroy it
[1:12:53] talking about John and James right he
[1:12:55] says them scriptures just kept pouring
[1:12:57] over all night I didn't sleep he says
[1:13:01] but that was a trap set that Satan would
[1:13:03] get me all worked up and then make me
[1:13:07] say the wrong
[1:13:09] thing he says but the Holy Spirit was
[1:13:12] there and told me beforehand to be
[1:13:15] careful what I said oh the goodness of
[1:13:18] God how it was he says just his Mercy he
[1:13:21] says be careful what you said and this
[1:13:23] is the point I'mma end on he says and
[1:13:26] from then on there was a relief
[1:13:30] come he says I be to notice the
[1:13:33] different things that I would speak out
[1:13:37] unconsciously he says not knowing what I
[1:13:39] said and it would happen that way I
[1:13:43] begin to speak about it and as you go on
[1:13:46] this message is called speak to this
[1:13:47] mountain as you go on down just a few
[1:13:50] paragraphs down he be to describe how
[1:13:53] God be to introduced the third pool to
[1:13:59] him so God let a
[1:14:01] trial that involved his reaction to an
[1:14:06] action to be the test that when he
[1:14:09] passed Advanced him on into the third
[1:14:13] pool
[1:14:16] Ministry can we say praise the Lord you
[1:14:20] see how important it is for our tongues
[1:14:23] to be controlled by the Holy
[1:14:27] Ghost you see what it's going to lead to
[1:14:31] that's necessary in order for us to move
[1:14:34] on into this further part oh
[1:14:39] my no wonder we get so many
[1:14:43] trials and these little testing things
[1:14:45] that rise
[1:14:47] up man I didn't had people handling me
[1:14:49] all kind of
[1:14:52] ways and you
[1:14:57] and I I'm like where is this coming from
[1:14:59] what did I do to this
[1:15:02] person I'm I'm caught off God I'm like
[1:15:05] man why they acting like that to what
[1:15:07] did I do and I'm trying to search myself
[1:15:10] saying what did I do what did I
[1:15:12] say and the Holy
[1:15:15] Spirit when I'm alone with him he just
[1:15:19] begins to minister to me and you know
[1:15:21] what he the Lord won't even let me
[1:15:23] defend myself
[1:15:25] said hold your
[1:15:27] peace so I'm sitting there quiet about a
[1:15:30] whole lot of things right now because
[1:15:33] the Lord and I I'm seeing it now so now
[1:15:36] my I'm I'm it makes it
[1:15:40] better when you see what is working when
[1:15:43] you see what it's
[1:15:44] producing when you see the area that is
[1:15:47] leading
[1:15:49] to so now I gladly hold my
[1:15:52] peace I ain't got to be heard
[1:15:57] I ain't even got to respond
[1:16:02] oh oh man I wanted to show you something
[1:16:05] here I'll stop right there I ain't gonna
[1:16:08] do that I'll stop right there amen but
[1:16:11] this is beautiful Saints amen we ain't
[1:16:13] trying to bring a well sounding word a
[1:16:16] well put together sermon that ain't what
[1:16:18] this is about this is about growth this
[1:16:21] is about no this is about the rapture
[1:16:24] you know but but but even even outside
[1:16:27] of the Rapture there are things that you
[1:16:28] and I have to come to express God's
[1:16:32] perfect will has to be expressed
[1:16:33] according to the purpose that he placed
[1:16:35] into our
[1:16:36] lives right so he's grooming us he's
[1:16:40] working with us he's massaging us he's
[1:16:43] he's dealing with us his tender hand of
[1:16:47] Mercy is hard sometimes amen as you're
[1:16:51] going through your
[1:16:53] change amen it's real change and some it
[1:16:57] can get downright difficult sometime you
[1:17:00] know we we in a Christian environment or
[1:17:03] whatever so we we know is we know better
[1:17:05] than just to say anything or whatever
[1:17:06] because the Bible even say be careful
[1:17:08] what you allow your heart to utter
[1:17:10] before the Lord just don't let it be
[1:17:13] rash right but we going through that and
[1:17:16] God is he's he's laying it down on you
[1:17:18] because you got a higher calling right
[1:17:21] and it can be tough
[1:17:23] sometimes right
[1:17:27] we have to die we have to give ourselves
[1:17:30] more to the things of God because our
[1:17:32] Victory is within that there is no way
[1:17:35] you're going to have Victory or pass
[1:17:37] these tests if you doing things halfway
[1:17:40] in your spiritual
[1:17:43] walk your failures will be you have a
[1:17:47] gazillion of them because it's not
[1:17:50] possible outside of you and
[1:17:52] Christ being in a community
[1:17:57] God bless you
[1:17:59] Saints I thank God for his
[1:18:03] grace and helping me to express
[1:18:06] this so I got a little relief right
[1:18:10] now but I ain't got complete
[1:18:13] relief because I got to preach tomorrow
