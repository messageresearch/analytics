one just want to tell brother amen really appreciate that brother wonderful songs beautiful just love that worship and so thankful for the gifts God's placed in your life praise the Lord and also how you're investing in those gifts amen may God richly bless you so refreshing to hear those songs praise the Lord so Revelation Chapter 2 uh verse one want to look at Ephesians Church Age part two tonight these are just such special words I really believe this is a a crucial book to understanding the end time message you know the prophet of God said you can't even understand the seals until you first understand the church ages he said and after you get to the church ages then the seals he said then the trumpets then the woes then the vials work your way through how many enjoying this church ages amen I'm surely enjoying I've waited years and years I just wonder why I haven't had this inspiration to do it but now I got the inspiration to do it so I'm GNA stay right with it by God's grace Revelation chapter 2 verse one like I said whole you know whole entire churches and Ministries have been built upon the teachings of the prophet of God from this series and God has blessed those Ministries tremendously so we know there's many many great truths in this teaching here Revelation 2 verse one Lord willing we'll just read verses one and two I I don't really think I'll get much further than that tonight by God's grace uh as I read through this book and study the church age book I just can't leave some of these things out they're just so dear and precious to my heart and uh important for us to understand it so if you're live streaming here or if you're here and you haven't read the church age book I think it's good for us to go slow slow through it and a lot of these truths you know you'll see they're completely scriptural you know of course but uh uh if if you haven't uh studied that and learned it and uh gained that knowledge of Christ in your life then you need it you really need it and it's always good for us to remember it if we have read it and be refreshed by it praise the Lord so Revelation 2 verse one I'll read verse one and then we I'll read verse two unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks now let's read verse two 1 2 3 I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou c not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars amen let's bow our heads in word of prayer if you have an eat on your heart just make it known unto God maybe raise your hand or or just speak to the Lord in your heart as we pray Heavenly Father we're gathered here again it's not in vain many faithful prayers have been prayed tonight already faithful songs and sincere worship and praise has gone up to thee dear God you're are uh you're our wheel in the middle of the wheel you're our life you're our Stone cut out of the mountain that'll destroy these evil Gentile ages you're our life our bread our water our husband our ruler our King Our Redeemer savior our Alpha and Omega the beginning and end Rose of Sharon Lily and the valley you are our all in all tonight we love you we worship you Jesus take this word break it to our hearts and give me Grace Lord wisdom not to wear myself out but Lord just to be used by you as a vessel of Honor help me to be faithful tonight Lord we love you in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen God bless you being seated praise God so want to uh look at part two here so Malachi when you're ready we'll switch over here and I'm going to try this uh high-tech remote brother van gave me here so I'm going to try it by God's grace and we'll see if it'll work uh by the grace of the Lord for our live streamer so Malai just watch that screen in a moment once we get connected here and uh brother lur said it worked great on Sunday so I want to thank brother bang for that it worked really good on Sunday so brother Vang told me to do this how'd that okay Glory see even I can even you can teach an old dog an old Eagle New Tricks I'm not a dog you can teach an old Eagle New Tricks Eagles renew their strength amen praise the Lord I like technology anyway so I'm not too far out of the mix you I can't I can't build much online but I sure like computers you know amen so let's look at this Ephesian Church Age part two I think you'll really be blessed uh tonight by God's grace so let's look at this here now our full text for the of course the the church age is 1 to 7 and uh we want to look at how and we'll notice this as we go through this in the next few months Lord willing if God carries and if I keep feeling led to do this on this topic uh but brother ramam said Jesus starts every Church age out by introducing himself to the church age uh so we we want to look at tonight how he introduces himself by the grace of the Lord so uh let's look at our scripture uh unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right now we did that on Sunday so we I I got through about onethird of the verse on Sunday because there's so much in there to learn from from the prophet of God uh God's servant the prophet brother Brandon so the angel of course was the messenger we know was St Paul because every man even Peter had to submit to St Paul because St Paul had the greatest Revelation for that age he was the man uh that God would use as an example all preachers aspire to be like St Paul amen I'm aspiring to be like St Paul like this one time I'm like this uh remember the Bible said Paul saw a man who was uh he was crippled and the Bible said Paul saw faith in him to be healed he just saw it so he said with a loud voice stand up upon your feet and be made well I like to do that by God's grace uh that's the kind of Faith we're looking for amen uh Rapture in faith by God's grace but that's a we want a model want to see the Christ in Paul you want to see it in our lives amen so he's the angel or the messenger uh to the the church and Ephesus we saw was a very rich city a very important city uh economically but Also spiritually it's called the third Christian Church as we went over um and the word means aimed at and relaxed as we saw uh aimed at now what you could use aimed at in both ways they were aimed at by the devil but they were they at the beginning they were also aiming brother B said at the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus they were striving to be uh just in the very depths of God the heights of God they could go and the powers of God they were aiming at it but then they got relaxed as time went on and that's what we must not do we must uh we must be in this for the Long Haul praise God uh you know some people get discouraged if the Rapture don't come each year I don't get discouraged I just know I'm one year closer to it by God's grace uh if it don't come this year praise God hopefully it'll come next year if it don't come in my lifetime praise the Lord I hope it comes in the next lifetime but I'm going to be serving one thing I'm going to be ready whenever it comes amen whether I got to get a resurrected body and come that way by the grave and get a glorified body to catch my theophany with or if my body gets swallowed up in life amen While I'm Alive if that happens hallelujah amen but there's one thing for sure I'm going to be a part of it by God's grace I'm believing that with all my heart amen uh and Ephesus started out on fire but they many of them fell away not everybody because remember when when brother bam says this when Jesus is is WR is uh speaking this to the church age he's talking to two churches he's talking to the true church and the church that falls away praise God so the message goes to both the true church will receive the correction and stay with the word and then the false church WIll backside and fall away right so he said the message goes to both because remember they're both intertwined we went over that a few Wednesdays ago both churches the true church and the false Church they're intertwined amen now I got this thought here from I was listening to the sermon in 19160 brother B said I want you to notice every time that he introduces himself to a church age he puts forth something of his deity so he starts revealing more of himself now remember in chapter one he already did the Sevenfold Glory of his his person as a judge but during the church ages here he's showing more of his glory to the church ages okay he said that's the first thing he tries to make known to the church that's his deity he's God Amen Jesus Christ is God Amen so I'm been doing of course a lot of reading here as I just feel led of the Holy Spirit I'll stop and make a few comments uh and maybe read some scriptures I got a few on my heart I just want to make sure I I flip there before I forget so uh the next portion here we'll see this in just a moment read that in just a moment so uh let me find a notes in Genesis just a moment here you can start reading on that if you'd like there okay all right well I miss I have to look for that I have to look it up on my phone I was looking for the scripture about Esau we'll get to that in just a moment now he says after he gets to the Angel and the the the messenger here and the empis now he gets into the rest of the scripture this is the last two-thirds of it these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so this deals with something about the deity of Christ so through this we can see that Christ is God as we know Christ holds seven stars Christ holds those Messengers he was holding brother brandom in his hand how many you to believe that and then he walketh that means he's currently he walketh walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's right amongst the church today how many see him in your life today you see him you see him walking in your life amen we ought to because he's walking in the church amen he's walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks he he should be walking in our lives this is he of whom it said this this same Jesus is both Lord and Christ he's the ruler and he's also the Messiah there he is the one and only Lord God Almighty beside him there's no other there he is the savior salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9 walking in the midst of the seven of the churches throughout the Seven Ages now I'm skipping down to the white what he was in the first age he is in all ages to every believer he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever what he did once he's still doing and will keep doing amen now you'll notice that Jesus is walking alone now now brother Ram's goingon to break this thought of how he's walking there but he's walking all alone in the midst of his churches there's no one else with him now why isn't there anybody with him here he tells us why neither indeed can there be there can be no one with Jesus as he walks in the church for he alone wrought her salvation or or worked for it and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her how many know your property of Christ tonight he if any if anybody would take good care of their property who who would it be Jesus Jesus would take care of his property he said he is her Lord and Master she gives him all the glory and that Glory he will not share with another amen I want to make sure he's all alone because he alone bought her okay now look he says there's no Pope with him how you know that there's no Archbishop with him Mary the mother of his Earthly body is not with him glory I I love this this is so such a blessing to my heart I almost shouted he does not speak and turn to a father for he is the father he is the image of the invisible God Amen he does not turn to give orders to the holy spirit for he is God eternal spirit amen that Eternal spirit's giving him life it's inside uh the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell in him bodily right so the spirit's inside of him he is the image of the invisible father I love it and it is his life that's flowing and pulsating in the church you feel life in your in yourself tonight Church you feel life in yourself amen pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life salvation is of the Lord I hope you can feel the pulse of the Holy Spirit tonight amen giving you life if we if we hooked you up to a natural uh EKG machine right or whatever machine they have we could get your pulse right You' hear you feel the pulsation what if we hook you up to a spiritual machine could we feel the pulse of the holy spirit in your life amen we wouldn't want to be a dead church we want to be a living church amen that we're living and breathing and pulsating we've got life here amen hallelujah we were dead before if you checked me brother amen if you check me when I was in high school I was dead no life no Pauls oh but when the love of Christ Came Upon me hook it up now and see you'll see there's life in the body amen there's a Paul there's something there's a life PA F ating to serve Christ and love Jesus amen and look he still goes on with how he's all known there was no one with him when he trod the fierceness of the Wrath of the fiery furnace nobody nobody walked with him when he went to Calvary was not another but him who hung on the cross and gave his blood he's the author and finisher of our faith he's the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation we're spoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church did you notice that you don't belong to this church praise the Lord you don't belong to any church you belong to Christ amen we belong to him his word is our law Creeds dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no effect upon us yes it is Jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is God in her I like this willing and doing of his good pleasure never forget that so when you see somebody walking in the spirit and they're turning down pleasures of life and lust of the flesh uh that is God doing his will in our lives amen it's God's pleasure you think oh this person uh like for example like we talked about with marriage oh this person's divorced and they got oh they're not allowed to marry again because they got a living spouse how sad no don't be sad for them if they're walking in truth be happy that they're keeping the word amen that's God's will uh you'll have more pleasure and more love and more life In You by keeping God's word rather than transgressing God's word amen God is giving us his good pleasure his pleasure is his word and we live we live for that he said never forget that you have only one relationship to God and God has only one relationship to you that is Jesus and Jesus alone amen all right there he stands now he goes to the Stars okay so there he's talking about walking the midst now he moves to the next part of his deity is the the the stars there he is with seven stars in his right hand the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of God Psalms 44:3 for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them but thy right hand and thy thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou Hast a favor unto them in that right hand a power of seven stars who according to Revelation 1 120 are the seven Church age Messengers amen how many know the right hand represents power and authority most people as we know this most people picture God in heaven and he's got a physical right hand and then Jesus is right there on his right hand that's not what it means it means the right hand of authority praise God uh so in other words in other words the invisible ible Spirit the visible Spirit doesn't have a physical right hand because it's invisible right but the next in line of power is that body of Jesus that's what that means amen all the authority of that invisible is in that body of Christ how many you understand that by God's grace so it's as if that Christ is at the right hand of the power all power and authority Jesus said is given unto me not a physical right hand now Jesus has a right hand his own body but that eternal spirit doesn't have a a physical hand uh but it shows that Christ is operating Under full of power and authority of the eternal spirit amen glory hope that's understandable so this right hand signifies the very power and authority of God are behind his Messengers to every age they go forth in the fire and power of the Holy Ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect is his light they have no no light of their own they Kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their Sparks let's read that I let's go to Isaiah 50 I didn't read that one 50 vers 11 I like to read that they don't kle their own Sparks okay Isaiah 50:1 behold all ye that Kindle of fire that Compass yourselves about with Sparks okay so see how they're building their own fire walk in the light of your fire and in the Sparks that ye have kindled this shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in sorrow okay so see they have no light of their own so God is telling them to walk in the Sparks of your fire that you've kindled all right and that's just like a fiery messenger praise God God gives a Believer a fire in their life walk by that fire in other words walk by your testimony praise God never forget what God's done for you never forget what God's done for this church you must you overcome Satan what by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony always remember the testimony that's why every time I meet somebody like I saw Lucy remember on Sunday what do I do I tell her testimonies about the church testimonies about what God's doing in the church to keep them inspired because that's what we overcome by is our testimonies if we don't repeat those what happened the same thing will happen like happened to Israel remember after Joshua died and a few Generations later they stopped telling about what Joshua did did they stopped telling their children about the power of God that's why want tell Lydia and Malachi and AAA and all my children and if God gives you children God gives everybody children whatever more you want to tell them about what God has done never forget because he's the same yesterday today and forever it's our job to train the Next Generation in the fear of God Amen that's what I love telling everybody about my mom being heal of cancer I didn't see it happen but I saw her go from lying in a hospital with my very eyes to just a few weeks later out of there and cooking me breakfast listen now I'm still alive today nobody can tell me that didn't happen amen I saw it I was there and I um those Sparks that God has given me in in my life like the Bible said here walk in the light of your fire amen walk in the light of your testimony Hallelujah and thank God for the fire that he started in your life amen never forget keep that fire burning praise God now look it is night because for that is when the stars come out so Jesus has those Seven Stars it's night time we went over this a little bit but he repeats it it is the night of the Blackness of sin for all even the whole world have sinned and are constantly falling short of the glory of God now that's of course you know Romans 3:23 we know that all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God now these seven Messengers are making God known to the people has brother Ram done that to you when you listen to his sermons does he make God known to you he ought to if you're a Believer he will make it known to you praise God I remember the first time when I went to Guyana uh because of what brother Ram taught through the scriptures and things God became known to me when I was casting out demons there I I never done it before but God became known to me through what brother brandom taught me because I just follow what brother Bram said which just was already in the Bible it was already there no glory to brother brandom he just repeated what the Bible said but that's God's vessel I repeated that and I did exactly what the Bible said and I got the same results amen it became and that's what I told people the power of God became real to me after taking those trips before the word was real the Revelation was real but the power became real after that amen because I heard brother Ram say it and then I repeated the word and it happened for me the same way amen so I'm very thankful for that now I like this let's go to John 13:20 this is such a powerful thing and this means so much to me John 13:20 beautiful red letter words amen uh Austin's mom asked me this week in the car she said why is there red-letter words in the Bible aren don't you love those little questions like that she said she's gonna clo she might want to serve the Lord someday which is good we're witness we're praying for her at home and everything and I said well sister those are the words of Our Lord the literal words quoted of the Lord Jesus Christ and she said oh I never knew that said my Bible doesn't have your Bible has r letter words mine doesn't and I said those are precious words amen verily verily I say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me who sent Christ the Father the eternal spirit praise God so it's a great chain right it's like a domino effect if you receive the one in front of you preaching to you then you receive Christ because Christ sent them and then if you receive Christ they receive the eternal spirit praise God so when I receive brother Isaiah Brooks I receive Christ when I receive Craig Boer I receive Jesus Christ amen well you could take it back to brother brandom you know you take it back all the way all the way to Christ and then because I receive them I receive God and God will receive me praise God and if you if you receive me as God's messenger then you receive Christ hallelujah it's exactly right every preacher is like that for each age if you receive Martin Lu Luther then then you receive Christ amen hallelujah he said they speak and act upon his authority he stands behind them with all the power of the godhead Glory let's read that Matthew 28 these are just things we cannot forget we must remember these Matthew 28:18 now we know verse 19 is the most misunderstood scripture in all of christiandom they call it but what the people ask me they say was that what was that Jesse why why does it say like that Jesus is speaking in a mystery remember the Bible said he would speak in Mysteries the Bible said he would speak Mysteries that were kept secret from the foundation of the world and this was one of those Mysteries how could God be both or all three of Father Son and Holy Ghost how could he he could do it by becoming in his son amen could be the father Son and the Holy Ghost all in one person amen not three persons one person that's a mystery he was he would speak that would be kept from the foundation of the world all right um and just a real quick testimony before we read this a person saw my YouTube video today on water baptism and he lives in North Carolina he lives in Kings Mountain I preached there before and he said can I be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said yes sir and he just emailed me and said give him my phone number he said uh he said I'm looking forward to hearing from you or your friend thank you in his name praise God so looking for another good testimony those videos being online we've seen people just this month a woman said she'll stop cutting her hair stop wearing makeup now this gentleman wants to be baptized and I just got in touch with Tim Myers tonight uh sister AO remembers Tim I don't know if you guys met Tim or not but he saide we'll be happy to baptize him because that's where their church is in Kings Mountain so God knows amen just thankful we're trying to spread the word if I can't go overseas or whatever I can at least put a video on the internet amen and preach so one little soul Who's hungered On YouTube can find the word of God Amen okay so Verse 18 and Jesus came and spake on them saying all power is given un me in heaven and earth see he's deity all everything we have a portion of the power but he's got all power go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name name not names the name the one name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost brother BR brother B emphasized the of the of the father of the son and of the holy ghost He said if it didn't say of the he said then it would be the titles he say in the name of the father son Holy Ghost he said but it's Jesus makes sure that all three have ofthe because all three point to one name of the father of the son and of the Holy Ghost there's a name in other words there's a name of the father a name of the son and the name of the Holy Ghost and they're all Jesus Christ see brother man said every word's critical in the Bible that's exactly right teaching now verse 20 this is what we're doing right now in Aran Ohio in 2016 we're teaching all of us to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world so will he be with us Church yes and as we will'll receive as much of Christ in our lives as we'll give him he will manifest other words he'll do as much in our lives as will believe hallelujah amen that's right because Jesus told him he said be it unto you according to your faith praise God be it unto you be it unto us according to our faith so I say let's raise our faith amen let's believe let's pray Lord increase my faith Hallelujah Glory let me believe believe and have assurance and Revelation that all things are possible Glory now go to Matthew 13 because I believe this is where the scriptures at where it says he would utter things uh from the foundation of the world and give me just a moment because I'm going look it up in my concordance if anybody finds it let me know but I know the scripture said he would uh secret what was it 35 bless your heart hallelujah thank you darling all right yes and lyd's almost through reading her Bible one time through God bless her amen Matthew 13:35 that it might be spoken look so Jesus preaches these seven Parables then he goes to verse 35 that it might be Pro fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables he said I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world Amen look at that see he would that's when he said Holy Ghost that's what he was doing he was uttering a secret that there'll be one name to the father son Holy Ghost right that was a secret and if you search all the Bible you'll find that there's one name and that's the Lord Jesus Christ now let's prove it again just bear with me just a little bit um John 5:43 I think I'm just going by the unction of the Holy Spirit my memory John 543 if I'm wrong I have to look it up yeah that's right yep yep there it is brother amen can you read that when you get that John 5:43 sir I am father re amen so Jesus said I didn't come in my own name I came in my father's name what was your name Jesus well the angel said call him Jesus amen the son's name you'll have a son who'll be born of a virgin uh Mary you're be a virgin he said call him Jesus amen Jehovah is our Salvation so there's a scripture that proves the name of the father is Jesus is that right okay you don't have to turn there but Matthew 1:21 that scripture proves uh Gabriel told Mary call call the son Jesus now here's the name of the Holy Ghost is Jesus John 14:26 if I never taught you this now you got it tonight 142 this is just a bonus tonight by God's grace extra blessing John 14:26 this proves Matthew 28:19 that the father son Holy Ghost all point to one name father's not a name son's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name if you never understood this now you can catch it here okay John 1426 does anybody want to read that oh Malachi okay go ahead sir now this is a great scripture for the baptism Holy Ghost but it's also a great scripture for the name of God what name does the Holy Ghost come in not his not not the title Holy Ghost he comes in my name who's who's talking there Jesus so if you want the Holy Ghost you got to cry Jesus Jesus come Lord Jesus fill me Jesus because the Holy Ghost comes in my name amen cripples were healed in in my name the name of Jesus Christ right uh uh dead were raised in the name of of Jesus Christ everybody was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so that proves right there and this was such a great Revelation for me John 543 John 14:26 they all say that the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ all right now that's just a little bonus there for you let's let's continue going on by God's grace and I promis myself I'll be done in about uh okay I got 30 minutes all right I don't want to preach too long because my voice I'm just finally starting to get my voice back so there they are full of the Holy Ghost and Faith talking about those stars on fire with the fire of God how many love that by God's grace want to be on fire with the fire of God holding forth the word of Truth and there he stands to back them up Hallelujah I got church like like brother man said when you're an ambassador for Christ he said uh uh he said You' got all of Heaven backing you up amen well people say I can't do this or I can't stand up to my family or I can't stand up to my boss you can't you've got all Heaven backing you up amen you might lose and forfeit a few things on this Earth but you've got all Heaven behind you to lead you to the next Open Door amen sacrifice everything for Christ amen he'll make it turn out good if we just realize who's behind us amen who's backing us up Hallelujah who's behind Stephen who was backing up Stephen when he got stoned that day Christ all heaven was backing him up it was God's will for him to die as a martyr amen but all heaven was backing up how how do you know because Jesus stood up he was sitting down at the right hand of majesty he stood up to receive him and salute him as he came to Heaven Hallelujah he raised there to receive him and he said receive my spirit and no doubt Christ did amen exactly all Heavens backing you up and he backed him up so much that he didn't even feel the the pain of the stones right the Bible said he went to sleep before he got hit with the stones hallelujah amen because all heaven was backing him up I love this let's let's pray this is a reality this next what I got here in yellow brother Ram's words and think of it not one believer of any age needs cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age when the apostles were first sent out he said there is no need to look back look up isn't that such a isn't that such a faith raising statement there we don't have to look back and say oh I wish we were in the days of the Apostles brother BR said just look up to heaven praise God don't look back and say oh I wish we could have did that there look up and say he's the same yesterday today and forever Behold Him who is now walking in the midst of the churches throughout all ages say Lord we're looking up to you you're walking in our lives right now you're walking in this church in our Humble Church you're walking our humble families and our humble lives we look up to you we ask you to move upon the scene that simple humble childlike faith God will honor childlike Faith praise God Behold Him him who is the same yesterday today and forever and who never changes either in essence he said or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst he's here tonight amen glory and not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to the church Hallelujah so Jesus is not just here taking notes I wonder how Adam and Bo are gonna behave tonight I wonder how brother Jesse is gonna behave and just standing back he's actually standing here like trying to offer and give us something brother bam said Remember the Holy Spirit goes to every aisle and once to minister to every aisle like what do you need brother amen what do you need Lydia what do you need Saints you know he's here to give you something here tonight he's not just watching and just making sure you know you're behaving and you're you're nice and you're in church order more than that he wants to give you life he wants to strengthen you he wants to sustain you tonight because he wants to give you all good things praise God I like that not just onlooker not just observing but he wants to be a part of the worship amen wants to be a part of your experience tonight don't you love him for that amen so now all right how meaningful are those words he walks in the midst of the seven candlesticks viewed when viewed in the light of scripture which describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life and look at this without him she's simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of the people so those without the anointing without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the true word of God it's just a simple religious Society or Club a meaningless Gathering of the people so the worship is done in vain let's go to Matthew 15 you remember when Jesus said this any church or any Gathering any no matter how mega church or how small it is anyone who denies the word it becomes just a meaningless Gathering of people uh their Gathering is in vain and that's hard to say but it is the truth so we must make sure we never limit the Holy Spirit we must know that all things are possible we must not break the word all right all right let's read verses eight and nine anyone want to read eight and nine brother Adam yeah you want to read eight and nine thank you sir this people unto me with their mouth and hon me with their lips but their heart is from me but in V they do worship me teaching for do the Commandments of man amen thank you sir anytime someone teaches their own ideas and makes it seem like it's the commands of God they've entered into vain meaningless Church worship God does not receive that right so we must take the and this is of course the Pharisees of the day they were saying oh you know you can remember that remember they told the the the children oh you don't have to support your parents when they're old just give that money that you're going to give to your parents don't support them give it to the church just as an offering and Jesus said you worship God in vain that's not keeping the word of God you've changed the word and you perverted it and now it's a meaningless Gathering I don't want to be a part of a meaningless church I want a church that's pulsating with life amen you can feel the life you can feel the love for Christ people hungering for more of the word I want to grow deeper in Christ brother Jesse I don't want just a society I don't want to be bride of Christ Society I want to be bride of Christ True Fellowship amen Spirit anointed Fellowship not Club Fellowship not Society Fellowship not meaningless Fellowship but Life Fellowship amen see as a corpse and this is quite a picture as a corpse be jeweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might aeve achieve without Christ she is a corpse also that's quite a statement but the scripture says it right here when you take the commands of God and change them to commands of men you've already entered into vain worship now we don't know who get saved in those churches right because it all depends on how they treat the True Believer that determines their salvation at that point if they turn down the Holy Ghost if they turn down the word how they going to get the Holy Ghost when they can't even get Sanctified and get the sin out of their lives how they G they can't it's impossible they Cru they crucify the effects of the word to the people right and so that's what we see we cannot become a club we have to have the Life of Christ he is my life that's the reason I'm here because I'm living I'm on fire for him amen okay the white but but with him W with him in her midst I like this with him motivating her what's your motivation tonight I hope it's Christ motivating you it's not like well I don't want the pastor to email me or text me where' you you should have come to church how come you're not at church that's not your motivation your motivation should be I'm here to love Christ I'm here to receive something from the sustainer I'm here to receive something from The Giver I want to be a receiver tonight remember at the same time you can be a giver too give him some praise give him some worship give him some love give him some real praise from real lips not just honoring God with your lips but real praise from your lips amen because my heart is not far from him my heart is close to him amen he's in my heart hallelujah amen yes he's my motivation that's why I'm the first one to church that's why I'm the last one to leave that's why I'm the one praying or that's why I sing or that's why I raise my hands he's motivating me to worship amen he's my motivation so with Christ in the midst of the church the church becomes a wonderment the people wonder at her of all his body the fullness of him that filth all in all and this very hour he's walking in the midst of the last ages golden Candlestick that's us when he was I'm sorry when he was as he walked in the first age he is even now in this last age so as he was then he's now Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen all right next one okay doing pretty good I got about 15 minutes that'll be good now he goes back to the golden Candlestick see that he walks now he gets back to the gold I preached a little message on that remember about the golden candlesticks but here he brings it out again he brings out a little more on this about how we're liking on the golden candlesticks Exodus 25:31 and thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made his shaft branches his bowls his knops and his flowers shall be of the same so now he gets back into giving his comments these are a prophet's inspired thoughts about uh this beaten pure gold Candlestick the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes is I'm sorry yes her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect so other words however he lived his life that's how we live our lives what he has she is to manifest amen there's no fault in her why because she walks in the light she confesses her sins She Walks In The Blood amen she is all glorious within and without so she has a pure heart and she lives pure before man because she's being washed from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can we understand this how can one understand it though we cannot do that we accept it by faith for God has spoken into it in other words Christ is going to pound on our lives Christ is going to beat on our lives till all people see in US is gold all people see in US is the word praise God but we got to lay there brother said you gotta lay there and get beaten you imagine if the gold jumped off the gold Smith's you know table you's got you gotta you got to chase that gold around and get it bring It come back here well that's what we do if we don't take the word of God if we don't come and hear the word and apply the word to our lives we got to lay there and let Christ beat us until all the dross all the dirt gets out of our life but not only is the Candlestick of gold it is a beaten gold handcrafted a beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit-given remember where did Moses get the the the the pattern he got it from Heaven the Holy Spirit showed him the Candlestick in heaven so he built it on Earth Glory outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of Christ can you think of anyone else being beaten and purged as much as the bride of Christ surely she's filling up the sufferings that Christ has left behind remember uh SS schmucker's glorious Reformation I think he wrote it in the 1800s uh they calculated at least 68 million Martyrs and I've heard bigger numbers than that from different historians at least 68 million Christians were killed uh from around 300 ad um what's that man St Augustine of Hippo that's it right there it's coming back to me now St Augustina hippo was a a Roman Catholic priest and he said uh shouldn't we compel people with Force to bring them into the um uh to bring them into the Catholic Church he said because if we do that he said then they'll be saved from hell so through that letter and I can show you the letter brother it's in the books it's recorded in the books brother BR recorded as well through that letter they started taking that letter from that Pope or not Pope Cardinal Bishop whatever he was and they started persecuting Christians and from that time in 300 ad all the way up uh to the 1800s at least 68 million at least recorded and that was the true church see that's Christ letting his church be beaten praise God beaten that's a beaten Church they got to be killed they got to go through suffering they got to lose uh their very lives but was ever a body ever beaten as much as the body of Christ brother said no the body of Christ has been beaten and purged more than any other people think about that now remember how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust seven or eight million look at this with Christians look at this Christians over this course you see that was ever a church ever beaten so much as the bride of Christ look at this her goods are despoiled her life is in Jeopardy now not ours at least in the US not yet she's accounted as sheep for the slaughter she's killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer so that that's what we got to be careful of when we're hurt what do we do many times we lash out other people for not careful right but a Christian when they get hurt should not lash out at others but just give commit that unto God say God you take that pain I don't want to I don't want to uh cause anyone else pain I'm going to give that pain to you I'm gonna cast that care upon you just because somebody hurt me doesn't mean I have to hurt somebody else I'll take that hurt and I'll give it to Jesus and that stops the cycle amen worthy of the Gospel is this lovely bride of Christ amen and as gold is malleable or which means shapable bendable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord so notice we're not called an iron or brass Church we're called a gold church because we can be shaped and molded by the pounding and beating of God's word hallelujah not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy Forever by the trials and testings of this life praise God I've got about 10 minutes I want to bring these quotes back to you now for some reason USA citizens will suffer at some point remember there's about four or five quotes in the church age book brother Bram said the bride will be forced to stop preaching um that's I think I taught that a few weeks ago and I told I I share with you what I feel has to be uh has to take place before the Rapture and that's part of it the political system has to come down I believe on the True Believer and has to put pressure or a squeeze upon them brother bandam said he he thought the Holy Spirit told him that the bride would be forced to stop preaching in America uh so at some point this suffering we may experience some suffering but church that that that this will be nothing compared to the tribulation period in the tribulation it'll be so awful that they'll be crawling in aves just seeking to die and they won't be able to die that's tribulation and us if we if we can't have this building anymore and I can't preach and and you can't come and sing together anymore that's nothing compared to what they'll go through that's not a tribulation that's just a squeeze that's just a little bit of a squeeze like squeezing the orange you know that's not tribulation they'll be so brother said they'll be in insane he said thus say the Lord they'll be so insane they'll be be so insane they won't even be able to kill themselves anymore no guns knives drugs they'll be so insane they won't even be able to kill themselves they'll be just scratching and crawling to be able to die and the Bible say they won't even be able to find Death that's the tribulation they're going through we'll see nothing of that how many you believe that and brother baham said in 1953 he said thus say the Lord he said before any soldiers and he said Russian but he didn't say Russian soldiers he thus say the Lord he just said soldiers he said before any soldiers would come to this nation and uh rape our women or or do anything like that he said the church will be gone he said thus sayith the Lord so we have nothing to worry about that anything evil like that the church will be gone before that he said thus sayi the Lord I can show you that it's on the video if you want to look it up on our YouTube channel uh the future Prophecies of brother Brandon thus sayith the Lord but here's the quotes where at some point there will be some suffering and some persecution okay now but not for the bride now the bride will be squeezed but it ain't tribulation it's not like what we're talking about now see I copied this from the website and I put all this white on there hope that don't hurt your eyes but did you notice the Beast that come up out of the sea now I taught him that that's ma that's Revelation 13 that Beast is the same Antichrist power that was in Pagan Rome 2,000 years ago The Same Spirit behind that is now in Papa roome right and that Papa roome Spirit has risen up here in the United States it got a president there JFK and now most of the I think a third or two-thirds of the Senators and so forth are Catholic that's right and when you see the Beast coming up out of the sea that's uh the the spirit the Antichrist Spirit coming up out of Rome it's meant that this power was raising up amongst the people but in Revelation 13 when this lamb came up he came up out of the earth no people United States right we went over that he come up out the land that was United States so the Antichrist Spirit United States he says' but then after he had two little horns civil which is political government and ecclesiastical which is church powers that little Buffalo civil political and church Powers he's got two powers and then he received power and spoke like the dragon did before him now look what he says so you just got to mark it down I'm not I'm not going to tell you to mark it down your Bible but I'm going to tell you I'm marking it down in this PowerPoint right here it's marked down you mark it down we're coming into religious persecution with the same things that they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus saith the Lord we're not experiencing we're not seeing we're not we're not slaughtered like sheep right in America but some countries do have to battle that brother Craig just got back from Gana I'm sorry Uganda in Africa and he said they have to pray every day just for their safety because Christians get killed every day there there and there they are preaching amongst you in Uganda I think it's right near the Horn of Africa if I'm not not mistaken a very poor poor country he said but you he said you should hear those people sing and the faith they have to see Miracles and he said they barely have any food but they pray every day and God sends them food somehow he said now look at our lives are so uh so much different and so he says we must not get weak in faith we must remember them we must be strong in faith because at some point it's coming to us we'll get squeezed but not not tribulation material all right now that's if we live to see it we could live out and we might not even see the persecution but it sure looks like it's going to come soon it sure looks like it the way they're letting homosexuals and transgender and all these things like that it sure looks like it'll be soon but we don't know it could be another hundred years we don't know that was in 1958 he says it again in 61 three years later now you see why my voice is going to be stopped pretty soon somebody's going to know yes why Revelation 2:20 she called herself a propheus that's speaking of course the spirit in the Roman Catholic Church you just watch the wave of sin happen now you watch Core Go Plum to the core haven't we seen it look at that that was 1961 hasn't it gone uh Plumb to the core of sin and rotness that we see now it is to the core it's rotten to the core this nation is rotten to the Core there's no hope for this nation it's so in love with sin and drunken with sin and evil spirits there's no hope for the nation but there's light for the church because Christ is walking in our midst amen glory Christ walks in our midst to save souls in this hour to heal Hallelujah to forgive uh to restore Hallelujah to prophesy he's right here in the midst tonight Hallelujah for those that love him you watch my monistic watch ungodly things happen to the churches and finally there will come a persecution the Bible says so thus sayith the Lord he says certainly there will be all right he says again 1954 someday thus saith the Holy Spirit here's a real man of God who knows how to use thus sayth the Lord out of the word of God that America there had been a whole turning of God down and America will receive the mark of the beast according to Revelation the 13th chapter and we're moving into it God cannot let any Nation he goes dot dot dot he kind of goes off on a different thought so there it is there's thus sayth the Lord America will take the mark of the beast which brother brand said was unionized religion we went over that unionized religion okay I got about two minutes here so let me you know look at this next one I thought I would get that far but let me just go a couple can I just go a couple more uh by God's grace something else I wanted to show let me uh yeah let me let me uh stop with one more let me go one more uh let me go two more slides yeah two more slides these are just some just I want to close these beautiful quotes here of Revelation 2 verse2 I want to close with this this just was really encouraging to me and this is how I want to run the church as the shepherd I want to run the church by the spirit like Christ does and like brother Bram told us to run the church Watch How I want you to watch this is how you're supposed to run the church and your family so now we're starting to get some fam some married couples amen some more you know by God's grace if God terries have little children running around here that's why I told brother amen we got to pray and maybe God would have us to build a church you know because if God terries we need a place for your children you know we need a Sunday school and it'd be nice toh not pour the money into you know just the renting it' be smart if God carries and there's two or three more Generations you know before the Rapture it would just might be a better investment but the point is if God gives us families and children we must raise them in the fear of God they need to be taught the word of God and we must run our homes and this church the way Christ runs the church age so I want you to see this scripture as as we as odd as it might seem this scripture shows how Christ runs the church right here which means he starts out with a compliment how many like to hear a compliment well you know your your wives husbands husbands got to tell your wies honey you look real pretty tonight you you you look real beautiful you know oh this was a beautiful it was a delicious meal honey you know you got a compliment her right Brothers like to hear compliments oh honey thanks for doing that thanks for taking out the trash or thanks for paying the bills or thanks for going to work I appreciate you you know uh everybody likes to hear compliments well that's what Christ does Christ compliments his wife amen and that makes me humble because I would love to hear him compliment me or compliment our church or compliment our families in the church would you love to hear that because so often we just think condemnation or wrath wrath or judgment judgment but really Christ always starts off with compliments because that's how he starts off the church age he says listen here's the one who has seven seven stars in his right hand I'll use my right hand and walks in the churches and he starts off with a compliment I know your Works your labor brother amen I know your labor brother Adam I know your labor you sisters I know your labor and I know of your works and your patience and I know how you can't bear them which you're evil now let's get into this these last two quotes I got two more slides and we'll stop because that is about an hour I told my wife I said if everything works out I'll just preach hour I'll end at 8:30 and it's 8:32 so we're doing pretty good look brother bam says us how beautifully the Savior praises and commends or compliments his children so Christ always starts off with an encouragement how many you like to be encouraged remember one of the benefits of coming to church is that you strengthen other people just by coming to church like I told you when I see everybody come to church I am so encouraged I could I don't care if I'm just preaching to two of you if two people come I just get so encouraged hallelujah we're gonna have church amen we're gonna we're gonna glorify God we'll sing and clap and shout and whatever because it builds people up just to see you gather together in faith to experience God's spirit amongst us it's true look at this how beautifully he Praises them so that's why everybody likes to be complimented because that's what Christ does Christ compliments his people he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he's watching your attitude your good attitude about the reading the word and praying and and listening to the messages he likes your attitude Hallelujah he likes your good behavior he knows that there is a weakness amongst them but as yet he does not cry out against it you see that he he knows they got everybody's got weaknesses but he starts off with a compliment isn't that just like the Lord isn't that just like Jesus he knows how to encourage Us in the right matters and discourage Us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families now as a man as a husband as a father of six children I've learned that this is the best way to correct my children it's not just to shout and scream right away the first time somebody spills something what are you doing how could you spill that or if you see them doing something wrong the first response shouldn't always be negative we have to ask the holy spirit to guide us and so many times you want to start with a positive before you bring up the negative right because that's what Christ does with the church Christ doesn't come out and say you bunch of backsliders and you're all fallen short and you left your first love that's later he starts with a compliment to the church he shows them as D I am God I'm walking in the midst of the candlesticks I've got seven stars in my hand I control The Messengers I control the word for each age and he said I know all about your works and your good behavior I want to praise you for that that's what he says and that's a good lesson so sometimes in my family or if I see something wrong in someone's life I'll wait a little bit before I talk to them about it because I want to see I don't want to just be like a a you know a strict judge you know as soon as I see like a Catholic nun like my dad said he said if they were messing around in the school they'd walk over there with a a a ruler and s slap them on the knuckles if they're playing inside their desk they' slap them like that with with rulers with wooden rulers and till they bleed no mercy just correction and that's why you know that's why I try to be like that I try to be more start with a compliment before you bring the correction praise God start off with a handshake and a hug and then say well brother or sister can I can I talk to you about something by God's grace start with a commment start with love to let the person know that you love him now are there times that God has to ball people out of course yes eleazer remember when he took the the spear and and thrust it through that man and the msh woman you know to stop the plague in the days of Moses there's times yeah there are times to lay the hammer down but when Christ address addresses the church he starts off with encouragement and we could all learn a lesson by running our churches and our marriages and our fames by encouraging us first before we do the correction how many can say Amen to that does that does that make sense Christ starts off his greeting to the church I know your works I know your labor he said and better still we could all learn a good lesson and that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way so not just to the church ages do Christ treat us this way it's every one of us as taught individually so on a whole church scale a whole age scale he treats them all that way but also on an individual scale well I really appreciate he might whisper this in your heart I really appreciate your worship and coming to church today but we really need to work I really need you to repent of this area and get this area cleaned out of your life praise God that's our Gentle Savior praise the Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the things we're doing right and he knows how to discourage us say this is is not pleasing to me this hinders the move of the Holy Spirit when you do this but I really appreciate your service you're really growing as a real Christian amen don't you like that he starts off with a compliment and then he brings forth the correction so especially the brothers you know because the brothers are the ones that to lead in the family now if they got to bring correction to the wives or children or anything like that they want to do it in love they want to bring love and then they want to bring correction all right but remember too sisters there's a way to bring Godly correction to the husband it's live a Godly life in front of him that's what the Bible said if your husband's not obeying the word then you without the word correct them with your love and I'll tell you there's a quote I found too brother Braham said this brother Braham said he said Brothers you know how your wife is your correction he said he said my wife ma is my correction did you know he said that I have to bring that quote on Sunday so you can see it and I found the same thing in other words my wife many times in other words I'm the one who offends my wife more than she offends me praise God I'm not getting many amens but that's okay I don't need many amens I'm just I'm just telling you what brother Ram [Music] said so in other words uh maybe maybe it seemed like from Brother Bram his wife his wife's Godly character correct him more than his cor character corrected her interesting but I'll show you the quote if you want it I show you the quote he said why and he even makes a joke in the 64 questions answers and he says he says honey or he said which one's better if I'm close to the mic like this or far back and his wife said close to the mic he said but he stepped back and said and everybody said oh it's further away he said honey I finally got one thing on you I got one wrong against you now he's just making a joke like because normally the godliness of sister M would correct brother bradam right because Brothers tend to get a little loose sometimes you know but yet they're called to lead but God uses The Godly character not the preaching of the wife right not the quoting of the scripture and let me tell you something it's The Godly character and the prayers and The Godly nature of that woman that is often a man's correction but when he's got to bring correction he needs to do it with love bringing bring compliments and then you bring correction and better still we could all let's say nor feet I'm already going over an hour and 10 minutes we better St hope that's helpful by God's grace we could all learn a good lesson and that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged bride of Christ Fellowship saint of God for God is not ungracious God's not ungracious now gracious means having favor so God is not a God who doesn't he takes away his favor from he's not ungracious he's very gracious he's not ungracious to forget your labors of love all the times you tried to do something right for God all the times you tried to help somebody and nobody noticed he's not ungracious he'll remember all that you do for the Lord whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and a blessing from the Lord how many love the Lord tonight praise God don't you love the scripture tonight praise the Lord see if people don't read these they're missing out on some some of the most beautiful teachings that we have because he took four years to write a book can you imagine four years I'm really feeling like I said I'm Inspire inspired to write a book soon I really want to write a book like my wife would wrote a book I kind of want to do what she did except for I want to write mine all about doct you know but look he poured four years of his life into this book and we get some of the most wonderful pure words from a prophet of God that we could ask for praise God Amen let's just sing that little song His Banner Over Me Is Love I know that's a Sunday school song but church that should be a reality tonight how many you believe that his Banner Over Me Is Love Jesus loves me and if he's going to correct me brother Adam he's going to do it like he did to the whole church he's gonna say Jesse you're my son I love you I don't forget all that you do for me but I don't like when you do this and you need to I'm going to discourage you don't do this anymore do something else that's how the voice of the Holy Spirit speaks to his children how many how many how many experienced that grace before he brought me to his banqueting table His Banner Over Me Is Love he brought me to his banqueting table His Banner Over Me Is Love he brought me to his banqueting table His Banner Over Me Is love and His Banner Over Me Is Love I am I am my beloved

on the Holy Ghost 1959 he said now my wife she's my correction he said you know my brethren what I'm talking about God help our brothers to live better lives but look even a prophet of God there's something about a holy ghost filled sister that can live so close to God it'll even convict a husband praise God he's the leader but yet as a submissive follower she can be such an influence on the leader she said the people in the back last night couldn't hear me because I was speaking into this thing and now before I get started I'm going to try something I wonder if it's better is it better back in the back or is it better is this better now honey that's one time I got a mark against you he says now they say that's better all right oh my that's a woman that's a good one because it's been a long time since I had one she's usually right Glory I saw you like that by God's grace see a prophet of God who seen Visions brother Adam and talk seen Jesus Christ twice but yet a Godly wife who never seen Jesus Christ but yet seen his Spirit you understand seen the effects of the Holy Spirit she could live such a close life to Christ that it would encourage him to be corrected by his wife not by her preaching but by her Godly example take the name of Jesus with you child of sorrow and of wo and it will give you oh take him everywhere you go precious name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy Of Heaven precious name oh how sweet hope of Earth and joy of heav Heaven at the name of Jesus Oh at the name of Jesus bowing oh falling prostrate At His Feet Kings of Kings in heaven will crown
