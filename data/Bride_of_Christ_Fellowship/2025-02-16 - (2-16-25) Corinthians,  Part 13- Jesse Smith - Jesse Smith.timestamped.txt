[37:33] all clear from 76 down to 77 so thank
[37:35] you for pressing your way to the house
[37:37] of God by God's grace Hallelujah I got a
[37:41] few uh quotes here so we'll go through
[37:43] some of the slides by God's grace I
[37:45] appreciate uh everybody again pressing
[37:48] the route to the house of God I've set a
[37:50] timer here I know everybody we want to
[37:52] be uh cautious of the time here by the
[37:53] grace of the
[37:55] Lord hallelujah
[37:59] so let's look at here this is part 13 if
[38:01] I'm not mistaken yeah part 13 and uh
[38:03] we're looking at the Corinthians
[38:04] hopefully everybody was able to listen
[38:06] to Wednesday night's sermon this is all
[38:08] tied together because this is the
[38:09] sections on the same thoughts about
[38:11] Liberties of the Christian uh but then
[38:14] there's warnings uh inside these
[38:16] Liberties of course we know that uh
[38:18] there's warnings uh uh with all the
[38:20] commands of God right if you don't do
[38:22] this this will happen there's there's
[38:24] temporary curses for Christians right we
[38:25] know that uh if you do this you're going
[38:27] to get that punishment but even in the
[38:29] Liberty areas of Liberty whether you
[38:31] know you put up a tree or you don't put
[38:32] a tree up or you uh drink wine or you
[38:35] don't drink wine or you eat meat or you
[38:37] don't eat meat or you wear the jewelry
[38:39] or you don't wear jewelry even in that
[38:40] there's warnings in there too so we want
[38:42] to be mindful of that and remember what
[38:44] God has given to us here in the word of
[38:46] God now this chapter 10 has a outline
[38:48] there's three different kind of ideas he
[38:50] talks about Israel in the wilderness is
[38:53] a warning example so we're going to look
[38:55] at that in the first 15 verses and then
[38:57] it goes to the fellowship at the Lord's
[38:59] table demand separation so this is nice
[39:02] this ties in what we looked at on
[39:03] Wednesday if you remember I just briefly
[39:05] talked about how Corinth had many Idol
[39:08] temples right we looked at Aphrodite uh
[39:11] posidon and Apollo they actually had
[39:13] temples and and some of these message
[39:15] Believers and the early Christians were
[39:16] actually going into those temples and
[39:18] eating uh but they were houses of demons
[39:21] right like we compare it to like a adult
[39:23] uh club like nightclub or something like
[39:25] that we compare it to that or a bar uh
[39:27] just houses of lewdness houses of
[39:30] wickedness because they were houses of
[39:32] prostitution and homosexuality and
[39:34] fornication and adultery and so here
[39:37] Paul the next chapter or two chapters
[39:39] over now he gets into saying you can't
[39:41] have fellowship with both right you
[39:44] can't you can't go to those places and
[39:46] then try to come here and have communion
[39:48] so he kind of uh he gave us the
[39:49] introduction there in chapter 8 uh to
[39:52] that and then here in chapter 10 he's
[39:53] going to say you cannot drink from both
[39:55] cups you cannot do both things uh so
[39:58] that's of course a warning there and now
[40:01] it becomes a command do not go to those
[40:03] places and of course he said as long as
[40:05] the world stands I wouldn't do that
[40:07] because it would cause somebody to
[40:08] stumble but the young immature
[40:10] Christians would need those reminders by
[40:12] the grace of
[40:13] God pardon me I'm battling a little
[40:15] runny nose myself here by God's grace
[40:17] but doing good verse thir 20 23 rather
[40:20] to 33 looks at the law of love in
[40:23] relation to eating and drinking again
[40:25] finishing up this section on Christian
[40:26] liberties so we're right here we you
[40:28] know we've been going through chapter 8
[40:29] n 10 as on Christian Liberties and their
[40:33] warnings so we've looked at all these
[40:34] other topics here in this
[40:36] letter I'm glad you know I'm glad there
[40:39] was such a thing as a Corinthian Church
[40:41] because it shows us people can do these
[40:43] things and yet still be saved but there
[40:46] the way we'll know they're saved is if
[40:48] they receive the correction of the word
[40:51] right as we'll see in this chapter this
[40:52] chapter actually lays it out here and
[40:54] gives the warning uh to how people know
[40:57] they're saved or not uh it gives it very
[40:59] plainly in here and then it's
[41:01] interesting he'll go into the headship
[41:02] with hair and uh Christ I'm sorry God
[41:05] Christ man woman in the next chapter the
[41:07] then communion he deals again with
[41:08] communion as we read that countless
[41:10] times uh hundreds of times we'd say for
[41:12] the our communion Services then looks at
[41:14] the spiritual gifts God bless you Sister
[41:16] and then of course charity uh in Chapter
[41:19] 13 and then the gifts of the holy spirit
[41:21] tongues in chapter 14 and then
[41:23] resurrections the the certainty of the
[41:25] Resurrection praise God okay okay so uh
[41:28] remember this was brother braham's text
[41:29] if you haven't listened to that I would
[41:30] encourage it's only like an hour and 20
[41:31] minutes if you uh if you're on a drive
[41:33] or something or just sit down and listen
[41:35] to it it's a great message uh he talks
[41:37] about Corinthians book of Correction so
[41:39] in the in the 12th paragraph So the
[41:41] beginning of the the message he said
[41:42] this message has come to my heart is a
[41:44] message of warning so chapter 10 is a
[41:47] message of warning that's what Paul's
[41:49] giving them warning uh and that's I
[41:51] imagine brother bam got it right here
[41:52] from the scoffield because it says a
[41:54] warning
[41:55] example he said I thought maybe if we
[41:57] could get this warning to the people as
[41:59] Paul was warning these Corinthians if we
[42:01] can get this warning to the people
[42:02] knowing that we're facing a Revival now
[42:05] and an examinating time when we must be
[42:07] examined as Paul said and then he reads
[42:09] of course the first two verses that
[42:11] reread so his text was verses 1 and two
[42:14] of chapter 10 to preach about the entire
[42:16] book of Corinthians so after reading
[42:18] verse two he says now he's given them an
[42:20] understanding that when God brought out
[42:22] Israel from the Wilderness Into the
[42:24] Wilderness to serve him and to take them
[42:26] to the promised land he's setting forth
[42:28] an example there that as we are brought
[42:30] out in all the material things all the
[42:33] rituals and orders they were the
[42:37] same so we're going to see here you know
[42:39] uh in other words Israel went through
[42:40] all the rituals right in other words
[42:42] they got
[42:43] baptized right uh they they followed the
[42:46] prophet right all these initial things
[42:48] you know when Aus and I first heard the
[42:50] message oh we didn't know there was a
[42:51] prophet that was new to us like some of
[42:52] you were raised in it God bless you for
[42:54] that our children were raised in it uh
[42:56] so you learn about the rituals right
[42:58] away but to us Austin and Lena it was
[43:00] different it was like wow I didn't know
[43:01] this is all the a beginning instruction
[43:03] and we thank God for it but Paul's
[43:06] saying Israel went through all that as
[43:08] well just as the Christian Church goes
[43:10] through all these beginning rituals or
[43:12] the beginning uh procedures of becoming
[43:15] a Christian or the beginning steps we'd
[43:16] say of
[43:18] Christianity verse 13 and we find on
[43:21] down a little farther in our lesson that
[43:23] many of those were overthrown because
[43:25] they they could do all the rituals
[43:27] and all the orders and everything that
[43:29] God required and still their hearts
[43:32] wasn't right with
[43:34] God okay so in other words like this
[43:37] people can go through justification but
[43:38] they still need full sanctification or
[43:41] else their hearts will not be right with
[43:43] God they got to be fully Sanctified and
[43:46] filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[43:48] now the battle is going to be hard
[43:50] enough with the Holy Ghost and the
[43:51] church said but without the Holy Ghost
[43:54] it's it's a very very likely someone
[43:56] without the the Holy Ghost will fall
[43:58] into one of these uh sins that we're
[44:00] speaking of here in chapter 10 right
[44:03] because Paul said most of Israel fell to
[44:05] these things and why did they fall
[44:07] because they didn't make it they didn't
[44:08] have the the hearts weren't right and
[44:10] they didn't actually want to go to the
[44:11] promised land how many want to go to the
[44:13] promised land amen glory so see their
[44:16] hearts weren't right with God and it was
[44:17] shown all the way uh through the Old
[44:20] Testament you know all all the story of
[44:22] Moses to Joshua it was shown time and
[44:25] time again over 10 times cuz remember 10
[44:27] times they they murmured against Moses
[44:30] 10 times they complained to God about
[44:32] their tough journey and that and that
[44:34] was just 10 times on top of that there
[44:36] was other times other tests that they
[44:37] failed as well so all these tests just
[44:40] showed their hearts weren't right so
[44:42] it's so important to make sure we have a
[44:44] clean heart you know a brother emailed
[44:46] me uh from I think he South Africa again
[44:48] this week and he said brother Jesse I've
[44:49] fallen into fornication again I can't
[44:51] get rid of it what should I do and I've
[44:53] told him many times I said brother go
[44:54] read Psalm 51 and if if God made David's
[44:58] heart pure for him after what he did
[45:01] surely God will make your heart pure if
[45:03] you come on the same grounds Hallelujah
[45:05] in other words if you come with the same
[45:07] repentance God will create in you a
[45:09] clean heart as well Hallelujah see but
[45:12] you got your you have to open up your
[45:13] heart and say God make my heart is my
[45:16] heart's dirty wash my heart and create
[45:18] in me a clean heart put your desires in
[45:21] my heart brother man says and we know if
[45:23] you come to God with the same desire or
[45:25] the the same approach same faith God is
[45:28] obligated to give you the same results
[45:29] Hallelujah if you want to be saved by
[45:31] grace through faith and God saved that
[45:33] one by Grace then God Will Save You by
[45:35] Grace as well Hallelujah he has to right
[45:38] he has to meet everybody the same or
[45:40] else he's he's unfair but we know God is
[45:42] just Hallelujah and he no one no one
[45:45] will be able to accuse God of any
[45:46] Injustice on the day of judgment
[45:49] Hallelujah and so we got to make sure uh
[45:51] you know people can go through all all
[45:53] all the rituals here of a Christian all
[45:55] the beginning steps but they got to make
[45:57] sure their heart gets clean before God
[46:00] now brother R list some examples so
[46:02] these will be common to us here now we
[46:03] can do many things think about that
[46:05] think of all the people in our church
[46:06] over the years that have taken communion
[46:08] anybody can do that that's good but
[46:10] anybody can do that we could be baptized
[46:12] we can come to church have our names on
[46:15] the book or you can have your uh phone
[46:17] number in the church group
[46:20] text because we don't have a membership
[46:23] book he says or just as respect and
[46:26] reverent as we could be sit there and be
[46:29] so respectful and and so Pious right
[46:31] they can look so
[46:33] holy and he says still be lost that's a
[46:37] solemn warning we could just rejoice
[46:40] when the spirit would fall and in a
[46:42] meeting where the word was being
[46:43] preached and our souls would just
[46:45] Rejoice with the word and still be
[46:49] lost the rain falls on the just and the
[46:52] unjust the same rain that makes the
[46:54] wheat grow makes the weed grow it's the
[46:56] the nature of the product see it's the
[46:59] nature of it that tells what we are
[47:02] therefore it's the nature that's in us
[47:05] that tells what we are Hallelujah see
[47:08] church we should constantly brother said
[47:09] don't judge yourself by how many
[47:10] miracles he said judge yourself by the
[47:12] current fruit your life is
[47:14] producing the fruits of the spirit I'm
[47:17] going to just to read them again real
[47:18] briefly here since I I got it there
[47:20] because I always for some reason I
[47:22] always quote the NIV version because
[47:23] when I was a child I memorized that NIV
[47:25] verse so uh I'd rather read the the King
[47:28] James I of course you can get saved in a
[47:30] NIV but uh you're not going to get to
[47:32] the baptism Holy Ghost I don't think in
[47:34] one of those versions verse uh
[47:37] 20 22 but the fruit of the spirit is
[47:40] love joy peace I really got to Commit
[47:41] This to Memory love joy peace
[47:44] longsuffering that's the one I always
[47:45] forget gentleness goodness Faith
[47:49] meekness Temperance against against such
[47:52] there is no law praise God hallelujah
[47:57] read that again love joy peace
[47:59] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[48:02] meekness Temperance against such there
[48:05] is no law that's the fruit of the spirit
[48:07] that's the nature that we want inside of
[48:09] us hallelujah the fruit of the Holy
[48:12] Spirit now uh this is the last one I got
[48:14] two more quotes yeah two more quotes
[48:15] before I get to the scriptures now we
[48:17] might be so religious till we could turn
[48:19] our hands on Sunday morning on Sunday to
[48:22] do a thing I'm sorry we wouldn't turn
[48:24] our hands in other words I'm not going
[48:25] to work all day Sunday now that's a good
[48:26] thing I really think that's a good thing
[48:28] you want to have at least one day of
[48:29] rest right we might not even take a
[48:32] stitch in our clothes on Sundays to just
[48:35] put one stitch now this is the old days
[48:37] when they used to sew but when they had
[48:38] sewing machines most of you sisters
[48:40] don't sew anymore right I've never i i
[48:42] soed in high school but I was in a home
[48:45] at class but not not
[48:47] since we might not even feel Justified
[48:50] to buy food on Sunday so look brother
[48:51] mam always bought food he always took
[48:52] his family out on Sunday to the Blue Bar
[48:54] Cafe right so brother Mam's even said
[48:56] some people probably criticize me
[48:58] because I take my family out and brother
[49:00] say there's and I have a quote brother
[49:01] say there's a lot of legalists in our
[49:03] church he said that's
[49:04] okay right so some people in the church
[49:06] would look at brother Bram said well you
[49:08] you you make people work on Sunday you
[49:09] go out to the blue board brother BR says
[49:11] well I got the Liberty to do it but he's
[49:13] saying you might be so religious you
[49:15] don't even buy food on Sunday you won't
[49:17] even go to the the store on
[49:20] Sunday he said you might be so religious
[49:23] and so Pious but yet if we're not
[49:25] literally born again of the spirit of
[49:27] God we're just worshiping in
[49:29] vain right in other words if we got sin
[49:31] in our lives right and our hearts are
[49:33] clean of course if you're Justified and
[49:35] your heart's clean you're worshiping God
[49:36] God's receiving your worship if you're
[49:38] Sanctified God received your worship but
[49:40] he's talking about people that will
[49:41] ultimately be lost he's talking about
[49:42] these Corinthians here right and
[49:45] bringing it down to our day where people
[49:47] can act so holy or they can be so loud
[49:49] another quotes remember the one I read
[49:51] Wednesday he said you might be able to
[49:52] clap your hands louder than anybody else
[49:55] he said but make sure your heart is
[49:57] right with God
[49:58] hallelujah I can clap with the best of
[50:00] them I can clap till Lydia has to leave
[50:02] this room because I clap so loud I can
[50:05] Scream and Shout I can cry I can cry
[50:07] crocodile tears with the best of them
[50:09] but that don't mean I'm saved Hallelujah
[50:12] the life I daily live proves I'm saved
[50:14] Hallelujah that's right and it stand a
[50:17] testimony stands the test of time that's
[50:21] right he says now so now it's pretty
[50:25] stiff that's a pretty stiff thing to
[50:27] say you don't even buy things you won't
[50:30] even Stitch a stitch on Sunday you won't
[50:31] even uh go to the store on Sunday You're
[50:33] So
[50:34] holy it's so stiff and we want to really
[50:38] find it and know the truth because
[50:40] remember we're not going to get a second
[50:42] chance at this Hallelujah see there's
[50:44] some people they won't get a second
[50:45] chance at coming to our church right
[50:47] look think about down through the years
[50:50] it's just one this one time and we got
[50:52] one life to do it so you better be real
[50:55] sure he's saying you got the nature of
[50:56] the the Holy Spirit Glory now Brethren I
[51:00] would not have you ignorant now he gets
[51:02] into verse one I would not have you
[51:04] ignorant brother now these Corinthians
[51:05] what did I say in the first place they
[51:07] were basing their
[51:09] Eternal uh holds upon some sensation so
[51:13] you'd ask them say uh you'd say Hey
[51:15] brother God bless you sir uh uh you know
[51:18] are are you going to heaven and and yes
[51:20] yes I'm going to heaven why you going to
[51:21] heaven they'll say because I
[51:23] shouted or because I play the piano
[51:27] because I lead songs on Sunday night or
[51:29] because I pastored for 18 years uh uh oh
[51:32] yeah and God came on me and I danced one
[51:34] time or I prayed for somebody and they
[51:35] were healed right there instantly they
[51:37] were healed and I felt the power of God
[51:38] come on
[51:39] me brother said that's the equivalent to
[51:41] today to people saying well I'm going to
[51:43] get to heaven because I had this
[51:46] experience now Church do we need a place
[51:48] and and some of you shouted amen which I
[51:50] enjoyed a few months ago I said you got
[51:51] to put a steak down we all got to put a
[51:53] steak down but he's he's comparing this
[51:56] how the these these uh Corinthians so so
[51:59] the so so so they were saying well I
[52:01] have all the experience but yet they're
[52:02] suing
[52:04] people they're divided saying well I'm
[52:06] of Apollos I'm a brother Jesse or I'm a
[52:07] brother cam I'm a brother Brooks I'm a
[52:09] brother Jim schake you put the name in
[52:11] there whatever name you want we're all
[52:12] Sinners saved by grace and they were
[52:15] causing divisions in the church some
[52:17] were they were saying oh I put a steak
[52:18] down but I can still get drunk at the
[52:19] Lord's table so see that that's what
[52:22] we're saying yes you got to put your
[52:23] Stak down but you also got to live a
[52:25] holy life Hallelujah
[52:28] yes well I I've I've made 400 YouTube
[52:31] videos surely I'm saved that's not what
[52:33] we're saved by we're saved by grace
[52:36] Hallelujah I've written two books that
[52:38] has nothing to do with anybody people
[52:40] can write hundreds of books that doesn't
[52:42] mean you're saved you're saved because
[52:43] the love of Jesus Christ has been shed
[52:45] abroad in your heart Hallelujah and
[52:48] you're living as close to God as you
[52:49] possibly can you die daily praise God
[52:52] and you ask for a transformed mind Paul
[52:53] said examine yourself make sure you know
[52:56] you're living in the faith
[52:59] Hallelujah but they were basing well I
[53:01] can sue people I can sleep around I can
[53:05] cause div Vision in the church I can get
[53:07] drunk at the Lord's table and I had an
[53:10] experience the Holy Ghost anointed me
[53:12] well of course the rain falls on the
[53:13] just and the unjust if you just get
[53:15] yourself in in the certain conditions
[53:17] yes the Holy Ghost is going to fall but
[53:19] they were basing it on some
[53:21] sensation Paul says when I come around
[53:23] you one has this one has that that's all
[53:25] right now he that's in 1 Corinthians 14
[53:27] that's a great verse I like to use that
[53:29] verse it's a just a beautiful
[53:34] verse uh let me see if I can find it
[53:38] yeah verse 20 it's 14:26 it's a
[53:40] beautiful verse how is it Brethren when
[53:42] you come together every one of you hath
[53:43] a Psalm and a Doctrine and a tongue and
[53:45] a revelation hath interpretation let all
[53:48] the things be done and edifying so in
[53:50] their Church saints they they came to
[53:52] church and every Sunday somebody had
[53:53] something from God well I heard from God
[53:55] this week imagine a church like that
[53:57] we're rarely like that right our church
[53:59] is just not like that this this Sunday
[54:01] the brother comes in I heard from the
[54:02] Lord I got a revelation and it might be
[54:04] exactly right and then a sister I've got
[54:07] a revelation oh God spoke through me I
[54:09] felt this I felt that I yeah there's a
[54:12] lot of things we feel that might not be
[54:13] right let's check it by the word
[54:14] hallelujah I've had a lot of feelings
[54:16] this week I didn't like so much right
[54:18] but I was feeling things right he says
[54:21] that's all right we have nothing against
[54:22] it but that's not we're talk what we're
[54:24] talking
[54:25] about so just because God can flow
[54:27] through us and use our gifts that's
[54:29] wonderful but we also have to have the
[54:31] character of Jesus Christ to go along
[54:33] with the flowing of God's gifts in our
[54:36] lives this is kind of like a review for
[54:38] all of us but it's fresh it's good and
[54:39] fresh I love
[54:40] this I love seeing what brother Bram
[54:42] said what would what would a prophet of
[54:43] God in this day say about it and we've
[54:46] seen it he said you can act so holy you
[54:48] can jump so high you can clap so loud
[54:50] you can cry so much you Cann not work on
[54:52] Sunday you can do all these great things
[54:54] but how are you living your life to your
[54:56] brother and sister Hallelujah verse
[54:59] verse one now we'll get into some
[55:00] preaching here uh by God's grace and I'm
[55:02] going to be using some uh I'm going to
[55:04] go back to chapter 10 I'm going use in
[55:06] some of these Bible uh references these
[55:09] U references and let's go back and see
[55:11] in Exodus and numbers and so forth let's
[55:14] see uh what what what Paul is talking
[55:17] about and he's saying we can learn so
[55:20] much from the
[55:21] Israelis we can learn so much from the
[55:24] the generation that left Egypt
[55:27] Hallelujah hard to imagine what does
[55:29] that show Saints the sin nature doesn't
[55:33] change yes you and I are so modern boy
[55:35] we got the nicest hair and we got some
[55:37] of the nicest clothes but we still got
[55:38] that a old same dirty sin nature inside
[55:41] of us so we ain't that much different
[55:44] right now we got access to more power
[55:46] that's the big difference amen we got
[55:48] access to more power whereas David could
[55:51] fall in murder and adultery we should be
[55:53] able to overcome that because greater is
[55:55] he that's in us than and he that's in
[55:56] the world we have rest unto our souls
[55:59] Hallelujah they couldn't have that in
[56:01] the Old Testament they couldn't have
[56:01] rest to the soul the soul was constantly
[56:04] in unrest but now we can have rest and
[56:06] Power in the
[56:08] soul moreover Brethren I would not that
[56:11] you should be ignorant how that all our
[56:12] fathers were under the cloud and all
[56:14] passed through the sea now ignorant in
[56:16] the Greek means not to know not to
[56:19] understand so let's make sure we
[56:21] understand all that Israel went through
[56:24] so it'll help us uh to navigate our
[56:27] Christian Life as we head to the
[56:28] promised land and as we head to the
[56:30] Millennium as well
[56:33] Hallelujah verse
[56:35] two and were all baptized unto Moses the
[56:39] prophet they were baptized by the
[56:42] prophet in the cloud and the Sea now he
[56:45] already mentions the cloud and the Sea
[56:46] right but now he brings in the prophet
[56:48] well actually the prophet allowed this
[56:50] Cloud the prophet called on God was led
[56:52] by God to bring about the cloud the
[56:54] pillar of Fire by Night Cloud by day
[56:57] and to part the sea but it was done
[57:00] through a prophet verse three and did
[57:03] all eat the same spiritual
[57:06] meat verse four and did all drink the
[57:09] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[57:11] that spiritual rock that fou them and
[57:14] that rock was Christ oh my ain't it
[57:17] wonderful Church to know that as we go
[57:19] through our we go through the famines of
[57:21] Life as we go through the deserts of
[57:22] life isn't it comforting to know that
[57:24] Christ follows you
[57:26] amen if he followed them he follows us
[57:30] as well Hallelujah and you always know
[57:32] he's got plenty of water praise God oh
[57:35] you're going to get thirsty you're going
[57:36] to get tired you're going to get
[57:37] exhausted you're going to get worn out
[57:39] you're going to get frustrated on this
[57:40] journey but don't forget Christ is he
[57:42] goes before you in the cloud and he
[57:43] follows behind you as well Hallelujah
[57:46] it's Christ that rock was Christ Christ
[57:49] is following us now there that's quite a
[57:52] statement that this is quite that that
[57:53] word many is quite a word there but with
[57:56] many that means
[57:59] 9999999999999 it's hard to be so
[58:01] repetitive I'm just trying to make the
[58:02] point God was not pleased with
[58:05] 99.9% of the message
[58:08] Believers because how many adults made
[58:10] it over
[58:12] two two now don't forget God was pleased
[58:15] with some of them like Moses uh Aaron
[58:17] Miriam you know they were still God's
[58:18] servants but they died in the Wilders
[58:20] but two two of them that that walked
[58:23] across through the waters imagine the
[58:25] walls of water and it's dry ground and
[58:27] two of them that saw the pillar of fire
[58:29] every day I would just like to see it
[58:31] one time right cam seen it Cam said he
[58:34] saw it over dve lwell and shoulder one
[58:36] time in the service there cam seen the
[58:37] pillar of
[58:39] fire but they saw the pillar of fire
[58:41] every day like
[58:43] clockwork and they could walk outside
[58:45] every day oh there's some fresh angel
[58:47] food out here you talk about Fresh
[58:49] Tortillas now how how good those tastes
[58:51] are fresh bread this was angel food this
[58:54] is even better it said honey taste to it
[58:57] some of you like cinnamon bread with
[58:58] honey on it or something like that or
[58:59] cinn bonds or whatever this has honey on
[59:01] it from
[59:03] Heaven freshly delivered to your door
[59:06] every day praise God and that wasn't
[59:09] enough that that would convince them to
[59:11] love God and have a pure heart see
[59:14] Church all these blessings we got to
[59:15] look past the
[59:16] blessings the blessings don't make us
[59:19] love God we should be grateful for him
[59:21] but we should love God just because he's
[59:24] God no matter what he allows no matter
[59:26] the story that he writes with our lives
[59:28] no matter how much suffering or pain we
[59:30] should love God just because he's God
[59:32] hallelujah he's our creator he's our
[59:34] father hallelujah amen but think about
[59:36] that seeing
[59:37] Miracles uh seeing a prophet seeing the
[59:40] pillar of fire having food and and water
[59:43] gushing out of the that that rock I've
[59:44] seen that rock on videos have you ever
[59:45] seen that rock uh archaeologists have
[59:48] found that rock it's a huge Rock
[59:49] standing up there on this on this near
[59:51] the mountain and like there there's a
[59:53] hole like there's a hole where erosion
[59:55] has Eros Ed out where the water went and
[59:57] there's streams still my wife has a
[59:59] video I think we saw a video on it like
[1:00:01] it's still there water came out of
[1:00:04] nothing right it seemed like but really
[1:00:07] water God just created water just like
[1:00:09] God created the loaves of bread
[1:00:11] Hallelujah he just at that little point
[1:00:13] there inside the rock where the crevice
[1:00:14] was he just brought he just created
[1:00:16] water right there and brother man said
[1:00:17] it wasn't like a little drop of Guster
[1:00:19] brother says how could I artist think
[1:00:20] that little boys were going up there
[1:00:21] with cups and catching water he said he
[1:00:23] had to feed three million people plus
[1:00:25] all the cattle he said it was gushing
[1:00:27] out of there when God pours out his
[1:00:29] water it gushes for us hallelujah we
[1:00:32] don't got to worry like God don't have
[1:00:33] enough God's gushing forth his Spirit
[1:00:35] Hallelujah you can enjoy God's spirit
[1:00:37] there's so much of it
[1:00:40] Hallelujah but with
[1:00:42] 99.9% of them God was not well pleased
[1:00:46] for they were overthrown in
[1:00:48] sanctification and the church said most
[1:00:51] of them didn't make it to the baptism of
[1:00:52] the Holy Ghost that's why with all you
[1:00:54] got keep pressing on until you get
[1:00:56] baptized with the Holy Ghost till you
[1:00:59] have a moment where you know power came
[1:01:01] inside of you all I know like I you know
[1:01:04] sometimes I dramatize it but all I know
[1:01:06] is I started weeping and crying I saw a
[1:01:08] vision in my mind and you know in that
[1:01:10] moment I didn't even really know it was
[1:01:11] a vision I was just enjoying the worship
[1:01:13] I just know when I walked out of there I
[1:01:15] had so much love I never felt that
[1:01:17] before but then I had to constantly test
[1:01:19] myself was that real was that right was
[1:01:21] that right and over the years I just I
[1:01:23] just had to make a a stake there
[1:01:25] something happened there and I'm living
[1:01:27] a new life Hallelujah power came into me
[1:01:30] there and I've lived differently since
[1:01:32] that moment praise
[1:01:35] God he says now they were overthrown in
[1:01:40] sanctification verse six now these were
[1:01:43] for our examples
[1:01:46] huh Old Testament stories are your
[1:01:49] examples to learn from to the intent
[1:01:52] that we should not lust after evil
[1:01:55] things
[1:01:56] as they also lusted so now let's look at
[1:01:59] some of these examples here uh as we go
[1:02:01] through the scripture we you'll be turn
[1:02:03] your Bibles in just a minute but I just
[1:02:05] thought about this Paul lists five
[1:02:08] things experiences and five is a number
[1:02:10] of Grace in other words God poured out
[1:02:14] his grace and look these all have
[1:02:16] spiritual meanings what does the cloud
[1:02:17] represent leadership you got someone
[1:02:19] going before you right so all of us when
[1:02:22] we came in the message we started seeing
[1:02:24] Oh God's leading me oh now I can see my
[1:02:26] life is being led the right way now I
[1:02:28] know where to go follow those that love
[1:02:30] the Lord right follow the pastor follow
[1:02:33] the example of the preachers they're the
[1:02:35] leaders of the church they have the rule
[1:02:36] over the church as we've seen it in the
[1:02:38] scripture recently they have the full
[1:02:39] Authority all authority rebuke and teach
[1:02:41] with all authority when I got leadership
[1:02:45] the pillar of fire is leading me on the
[1:02:46] spirit of God is leading me and they
[1:02:49] passed through the sea and they didn't
[1:02:50] just stop there they got up the
[1:02:51] tambourine and the sisters started
[1:02:52] dancing and praising God and giving all
[1:02:54] the glory this was F experience praise
[1:02:56] God it's a shame some people don't even
[1:02:59] have that and they say they're baptized
[1:03:00] or they say they've had been forgiveness
[1:03:02] right oh my it ought to make us have joy
[1:03:05] unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah
[1:03:08] to know that we're forgiven
[1:03:12] hallelujah oh Grace Grace provided this
[1:03:14] Grace provided leadership forgiveness of
[1:03:17] my sins and the joy of being free The
[1:03:19] Joy from overcoming addictions and slave
[1:03:23] masters Grace provided I was baptized in
[1:03:26] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[1:03:28] know God sent a prophet that's God's
[1:03:30] grace to
[1:03:32] me remember brother Ram commanded he
[1:03:34] said thus sayith the Lord if you've been
[1:03:36] baptized in the titles father son Holy
[1:03:37] Ghost you've been baptized false he said
[1:03:40] I command you to be re-baptized in the
[1:03:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a
[1:03:43] prophet Hallelujah he wasn't he wasn't
[1:03:46] stutter brother said he didn't stutter
[1:03:47] with thus say the Lord Elijah didn't
[1:03:48] stop down down there and say uh uh I I
[1:03:51] don't know about this he said thus
[1:03:52] sayith the Lord it will not rain for
[1:03:54] three and a half years till I call for
[1:03:56] it Hallelujah he didn't stutter with
[1:03:58] thus sayth the Lord neither did Brother
[1:04:00] brandom Hallelujah he gave us thus
[1:04:03] sayith the
[1:04:04] Lord and they ate the same spiritual
[1:04:07] meat my which is the body remember the
[1:04:08] body's the meat the body's the bread boy
[1:04:11] you've been you we've all enjoyed some
[1:04:12] of these wonderful sermons it tasted so
[1:04:15] good it's been so fresh uh we felt full
[1:04:17] leaving the house of God oh I could just
[1:04:19] love God I could just listen to sermons
[1:04:21] forever now what happened to
[1:04:23] that we got to be careful we got to keep
[1:04:26] feeding on the word of God but we've all
[1:04:29] I mean all the people that have been
[1:04:29] here to this church over 18 years they
[1:04:32] they all could say that my they enjoyed
[1:04:34] the meat of the word and they all drank
[1:04:36] the spiritual drink and Christ the Rock
[1:04:38] which is the holy spirit they've all
[1:04:40] been drunk uh drunk drunken on the
[1:04:42] things of God and tasted they've tasted
[1:04:44] and seen that God is good they they they
[1:04:48] I'll say like this for a moment they
[1:04:49] stopped thirsting for the things of the
[1:04:51] world and they only enjoyed in the
[1:04:53] thirst quenching blessings of the Waters
[1:04:56] of life that's
[1:04:59] right and then Paul says you can have
[1:05:02] all these experiences and still live a
[1:05:04] displeasing life to our Lord Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ and remember in fact the majority
[1:05:10] will not be
[1:05:11] pleasing so you know what I don't feel
[1:05:13] so bad that our church is small because
[1:05:15] we got we might be in that we might be
[1:05:17] in that small minority praise God think
[1:05:20] about that the big churches there the
[1:05:23] minority might be the only one saved in
[1:05:25] those big old churches
[1:05:26] yep beatric not head she knows what it's
[1:05:28] like to be in a big
[1:05:29] church you've seen them over the years
[1:05:31] right you see the people who really
[1:05:33] believe and who really don't I really
[1:05:35] believe let's really believe Hallelujah
[1:05:37] let's have a clean heart before God
[1:05:40] that's
[1:05:42] right and remember it was only two that
[1:05:44] were 20 years and older that made it
[1:05:45] unless they died before they got there
[1:05:48] and Jesus said few there be that find
[1:05:50] the narrow road that leads to life see
[1:05:53] it's got to be found you go to and where
[1:05:55] do you find it on your knees in prayer
[1:05:57] that's how you find the narrow road that
[1:05:58] leads to life
[1:06:00] Hallelujah so I just thought that was
[1:06:02] amazing there uh he Liv
[1:06:04] five uh experiences where they could say
[1:06:07] I've had the experience of the
[1:06:08] leadership of God I've been led by the
[1:06:10] pillar of fire oh I've had Joy I've been
[1:06:12] forgiven oh I believe God sent a prophet
[1:06:15] I feasted on the word uh my thirst for
[1:06:17] the the things of God has been quenched
[1:06:19] I've drank of the Holy Spirit and yet
[1:06:21] their heart is not right with God what a
[1:06:24] thing to say and brother calls all these
[1:06:26] the routines of the the rituals of the
[1:06:28] church right our rituals that when they
[1:06:30] want to be baptized go baptize them
[1:06:34] right our ritual is teach them what
[1:06:36] brother bam said brother point us back
[1:06:38] to the word of God our ritual is preach
[1:06:40] the word sing in the spirit till the
[1:06:42] spirit falls on them
[1:06:44] Hallelujah and yet Hearts cannot be
[1:06:46] right when they experience all these
[1:06:48] things okay get your Bible ready here by
[1:06:50] God's grace now he gives now he gives
[1:06:53] the sins the the sins to warn the
[1:06:57] people these are the sins to warn the
[1:07:00] people in this message Church in the
[1:07:02] early
[1:07:03] church okay neither be ye idolators as
[1:07:07] were some of them as it is written oh I
[1:07:10] did set a good I did set a timer good
[1:07:11] amen glory all right I got half I got 30
[1:07:14] minutes left Glory as some of them were
[1:07:16] as is written people sat down to eat and
[1:07:20] drink and Rose up to play now let's go
[1:07:22] read
[1:07:23] that that is uh Exodus
[1:07:27] 326 pardon me Exodus 3 I don't need that
[1:07:30] right now Exodus
[1:07:34] 326 now many you remember this I
[1:07:36] preached on this with uh the music
[1:07:37] series I did last year I think if I'm
[1:07:39] not
[1:07:43] mistaken verse six and they rose up
[1:07:46] early on the tomorrow and offered burnt
[1:07:47] offerings and brought peace offerings
[1:07:49] and the people sat down to eat and drink
[1:07:51] and Rose up to play then God tells them
[1:07:54] in verse 6 and 7 they better go down the
[1:07:55] people have already got into
[1:07:59] idolatry uh God said he's going to
[1:08:01] destroy him but Moses stands in the
[1:08:05] Gap now uh look at verse 17 and when
[1:08:08] Joshua heard the noise of the people as
[1:08:09] they shouted he said to Moses this is a
[1:08:11] noise of war in the
[1:08:14] camp okay now and then uh verse 19 it
[1:08:17] came to pass as soon as he came n to the
[1:08:19] camp that he saw the calf and the
[1:08:20] dancing and Moses anger waxed hot and he
[1:08:22] cast the tables out the hands and break
[1:08:24] them but benath the
[1:08:26] mount all right now so the first warning
[1:08:31] is be not idolators now look what went
[1:08:33] along with this idolatry this was loud
[1:08:36] music right some of you in the world
[1:08:38] know what I'm talking about they really
[1:08:40] like to crank up the music right so the
[1:08:44] the Believers got to be careful don't
[1:08:46] give yourself to Idols where they crank
[1:08:48] up the music really loud but look what
[1:08:50] goes along with it sinful dancing and
[1:08:53] also fornication so sexy dancing
[1:08:56] right there's nothing wrong with
[1:08:57] cranking up the music the Bible said
[1:08:59] play Loud for God but Joshua said this
[1:09:02] is a wrong kind of
[1:09:03] loud this ain't the this ain't the the
[1:09:07] the loud noise of worship this is the
[1:09:08] loud noise of uh sexual
[1:09:12] immorality
[1:09:14] right so he he said they sat down to eat
[1:09:16] and drink and Rose up to play when did
[1:09:18] they do this when there was no more
[1:09:19] prophit around now church I believe this
[1:09:22] is my home opinion I believe this is
[1:09:24] fulfilled Maybe not by message people
[1:09:27] but by the charismatics and the
[1:09:30] Pentecostals such as uh the Mike ble
[1:09:32] groups I don't know if you heard about
[1:09:34] Mike ble he started uh he started
[1:09:37] 24-hour prayer Chapel they prayed and
[1:09:39] sang 24 hours a day for years and years
[1:09:41] and everybody said he's the most H holy
[1:09:42] guy but you know what happened he got
[1:09:44] caught 17 acts of sexual abuse
[1:09:47] 17 17 but yeah if you look at their
[1:09:50] services loud loud all these things but
[1:09:52] you also look at them the women got pain
[1:09:53] on their faces they're dressing sex with
[1:09:55] short hair so see this is this is a
[1:09:59] modern example of that and then you know
[1:10:02] the when they pray for them they shake
[1:10:04] and it looks like they're in pain that's
[1:10:05] not the Holy Ghost and how do you know
[1:10:08] by their fruits they're
[1:10:10] known right by their fruits they're
[1:10:13] known so they the the prophets off the
[1:10:16] scene and all these guys but Austin you
[1:10:17] probably seen the videos all these guys
[1:10:19] say what a man William brandham was what
[1:10:21] a boy he had a gift of God we can have
[1:10:23] that same no you can't all of them say
[1:10:25] that oh yeah we uh and one guy his name
[1:10:28] is Chris valon I'm going to make a video
[1:10:29] on it he said I prayed to God and said
[1:10:31] God can I have the mantle of William
[1:10:32] brandom he said no that I'll make you
[1:10:33] prideful he said well how about it get
[1:10:35] gets on everybody and then we won't uh
[1:10:37] no one will no no one will look better
[1:10:39] than others and he said God said I'll do
[1:10:41] that that wasn't God that said that
[1:10:45] because not everybody's born a prophet
[1:10:47] and brother Ram said there'll never be a
[1:10:48] greater gift than his
[1:10:50] ministry right so it's impossible the
[1:10:54] Bible said are all prophets yet the
[1:10:57] people and the people will swallow it
[1:10:58] down they all honor brother Ram but when
[1:11:01] the prophets off the scene what do they
[1:11:02] do they crank up the music they allow
[1:11:04] sexy things to come in and what they do
[1:11:06] they raise up the play they're not
[1:11:08] serving God they're not getting down to
[1:11:09] business with God they're really not
[1:11:11] being uh Sanctified and filled with the
[1:11:13] Holy Ghost Hallelujah but they got loud
[1:11:16] music they got loud music in 17 counts
[1:11:19] of sexual abuse that's what they
[1:11:22] got now could yes this does this happen
[1:11:24] in mess Church yes it does I've told you
[1:11:26] about some of them right I'm not going
[1:11:28] to maybe get in those details
[1:11:30] today but that's what people got to
[1:11:32] watch out for some people would be in
[1:11:33] the loud worship Services the loudness
[1:11:36] and then the uh the immoral clothes and
[1:11:38] then sexual immorality he says don't be
[1:11:41] like
[1:11:42] that hallelujah how many believe the
[1:11:45] word of God that's right verse eight and
[1:11:48] I'm you know just stay there uh 1
[1:11:50] Corinthians
[1:11:53] 10:8 neither let us commit foreign
[1:11:55] fornication as some of them committed
[1:11:57] and fell in one day 3 and
[1:12:00] 20,000 okay this was numbers 251 and N
[1:12:04] numbers 20 I think this is speaking of
[1:12:05] balum numbers 251 and
[1:12:10] N 25 1 and
[1:12:16] n and Israel Abode in shtim and the
[1:12:20] people began to commit whoredom with the
[1:12:22] daughters of Moab now if you remember I
[1:12:25] don't know if you remember CU I I even
[1:12:27] any reminders if of this there's a
[1:12:29] four-step Antichrist process with the
[1:12:31] four horse riders the first step is
[1:12:33] Deeds of the nicians the second is
[1:12:36] doctrine of the nicians the third is uh
[1:12:39] balum bism that's what this is and the
[1:12:41] fourth is Jezebel religion that's the
[1:12:44] four steps of antichrist spirit this is
[1:12:47] Israel and step three balum religion
[1:12:49] what was balum religion he said Israelis
[1:12:51] come on down let's have a combined
[1:12:53] worship service and he stripped the
[1:12:54] women almost nude and there was a
[1:12:56] fornication between the men of Israel he
[1:12:58] taught them it's okay to commit
[1:13:00] fornication and 23,000 what was it
[1:13:03] 23,000 died in one
[1:13:06] day right now this is hard to find
[1:13:08] anything applicable to this in the
[1:13:10] message that I've heard of but I'm sure
[1:13:12] some people have been sinful around the
[1:13:14] world right but this is the but this is
[1:13:16] what he warns us of don't don't people
[1:13:18] should not commit fornication they need
[1:13:20] the anointing of temperance to control
[1:13:22] their sexual passions Hallelujah right
[1:13:25] that's what it he takes the anointing of
[1:13:26] the Holy Ghost so he gives us uh the
[1:13:30] golden
[1:13:31] calf and then he gives us uh balum balum
[1:13:35] right and brother man said that was
[1:13:36] liken unto spiritually it was liken un
[1:13:38] the Council of NAA where a lot of the
[1:13:40] church members United with the Roman
[1:13:42] Catholic church and uh Constantine
[1:13:45] right all right so we got two examples
[1:13:48] there uh golden calf loud music sexual
[1:13:51] immorality dancing and then uh next is
[1:13:54] just uh going to worship with
[1:13:56] denominations can I say it like that
[1:13:59] church we unless I'm going to preach I'm
[1:14:01] not going there unless I'm going to
[1:14:02] witness too right you see my example if
[1:14:05] they invite me I'll go preach I'll
[1:14:06] preach little like brother bam brother
[1:14:08] said when I'm out there I Don't Preach
[1:14:10] Doctrine so much but I'll I'll try to
[1:14:11] lay some things in there so the elect
[1:14:13] will catch it right because the elect
[1:14:16] cannot be
[1:14:17] deceived okay so Paul gives us these two
[1:14:19] examples balum and uh uh his Feast of
[1:14:23] balum bpor and then he also gives us the
[1:14:26] golden calf now number I'm sorry first 1
[1:14:29] Corinthians
[1:14:30] 109 neither let us tempt Christ as some
[1:14:33] of them also tempted and were destroyed
[1:14:35] of
[1:14:36] serpents okay so this is
[1:14:39] uh Exodus 172
[1:14:42] and7 Exodus I'm just using my uh uh my
[1:14:46] notes there from
[1:14:48] scoffield Exodus Exodus 17 2 and7
[1:14:52] tempting Christ
[1:15:00] all right verse one 171 Exodus 17 and
[1:15:03] all the children of the children I'm
[1:15:04] sorry all the congregation of the
[1:15:05] children of Israel journeyed from the
[1:15:06] Wilderness of sin after their Journeys
[1:15:08] according to the Commandment of the Lord
[1:15:10] and pitched in Reid him and there was no
[1:15:12] water for the people to drink so think
[1:15:13] about a time where you've ever uh felt
[1:15:16] like you've had no resources it's all
[1:15:18] run out what was your response we're
[1:15:20] going to see the wrong response that we
[1:15:23] might learn to give the right response
[1:15:25] praise
[1:15:27] God verse two wherefore the people did
[1:15:30] chide with Moses and said give us water
[1:15:32] that we may drink and Moses said to them
[1:15:34] why chide ye with me wherefore do ye
[1:15:38] tempt the
[1:15:40] Lord all
[1:15:42] right so here is a third
[1:15:45] example and uh of course we know the
[1:15:47] Lord sent water of course to them so we
[1:15:50] see a third example we should not tempt
[1:15:52] Christ so we shouldn't complain we
[1:15:55] shouldn't question God when things
[1:15:56] aren't going our way and I'll say like
[1:15:58] this even when we don't have our basic
[1:16:00] necessities we shouldn't tempt God
[1:16:03] because God's letting you be tested to
[1:16:05] see if you will serve God or not now
[1:16:08] most of us thank God in America most of
[1:16:09] us haven't had to deal with that some of
[1:16:11] us have right but it's a test God lets
[1:16:14] different ones go through this and how
[1:16:16] many want to pass the test hallelujah
[1:16:18] amen they so in other words when things
[1:16:20] got bad they spoke against the leader in
[1:16:23] our case the pastor or they some people
[1:16:25] might speak against brother brandham
[1:16:26] right why are things so hard in Leo deia
[1:16:28] maybe brother Bram didn't do his job of
[1:16:30] course he did his job Hallelujah he's a
[1:16:33] genuine prophet of God hallelujah of
[1:16:36] course but they speak against the
[1:16:39] leadership and they complain like it's
[1:16:42] it's God's fault that they're in the S
[1:16:44] situation that they're in it's not God's
[1:16:45] fault it's God's plan the footsteps of
[1:16:48] the righteous are order of the
[1:16:50] Lord God had ordered this as a
[1:16:53] test Hallelujah and church think about
[1:16:55] this just because everybody else fails a
[1:16:58] test doesn't mean we have
[1:17:00] to brother Austin there was a joshu and
[1:17:02] Caleb saying I believe God will give us
[1:17:04] water amen the rest of the crowd's like
[1:17:06] well God has forsaken us we don't have
[1:17:08] no water shame on Moses but Joshua and K
[1:17:10] like praise God it's got to be around
[1:17:12] here somewhere praise God because God's
[1:17:14] with us God brought us out God won't
[1:17:16] bring us out to kill us God Will Make A
[1:17:18] Way
[1:17:20] Hallelujah there was two people that
[1:17:22] wouldn't say these things Joshua and
[1:17:24] Caleb
[1:17:25] got any joshuas or Caleb ETS out there
[1:17:28] any calebs out there yeah I see some
[1:17:31] some Joshua ETS out there yeah I see a
[1:17:32] few by God's grace
[1:17:35] Hallelujah and what did God do they
[1:17:37] tempted God they spoke against God and
[1:17:39] his servant and so they were destroyed
[1:17:41] of serpents but then God even gave in
[1:17:44] the midst of that God gave Grace and
[1:17:46] said just look and live just look to
[1:17:48] Jesus just look to the one who took away
[1:17:51] your sin who paid the penalty for your
[1:17:53] sin sin was already judged Jud Jesus
[1:17:55] Christ took the Judgment upon himself
[1:17:57] just look to Jesus and you're forgiven
[1:17:59] Hallelujah just look to Jesus and you'll
[1:18:01] be healed Hallelujah all right I've got
[1:18:04] 20 minutes left some of you are like how
[1:18:07] did that happen already some of you like
[1:18:08] it's about
[1:18:09] time verse 10 uh 1 Corinthians
[1:18:13] 10:10 now here's what we've experienced
[1:18:15] in our church lately I put it up there
[1:18:17] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[1:18:20] murmured and were destroyed of the
[1:18:23] Destroyer so some some people tempted
[1:18:25] God put the fault on God other people
[1:18:28] murmured against
[1:18:31] god let's look at the the reference
[1:18:34] here numbers 142 and 29 numbers 142 and
[1:18:44] 29 numbers 142 and 29 so cor and daythan
[1:18:49] I preached it last week I think was in
[1:18:50] chapter
[1:18:52] 16 that was also murmuring right
[1:18:54] remember the Bible said they complained
[1:18:56] let me just get that reference for you
[1:18:57] if you want
[1:18:59] it the whole church
[1:19:01] complained uh against Moses it was
[1:19:03] number 1641 all the congregation
[1:19:06] murmured against Moses and
[1:19:08] Aaron all right number and uh yeah now
[1:19:11] numbers
[1:19:13] 14 numbers 14 2 29 according to
[1:19:19] scoffield this is oh this that Kadesh
[1:19:21] barnea that's right okay they didn't
[1:19:23] want to take the promise thing verse one
[1:19:25] and all the congregation lifted up their
[1:19:26] voice and cried and the people wept that
[1:19:28] night so see that's the wrong kind of
[1:19:29] crying they're crying out of Despair
[1:19:31] that's worldly sorrow we need Godly
[1:19:32] sorrow Hallelujah cry and say God raise
[1:19:35] my faith God I'm going to cry but it
[1:19:37] seems it seems I'm emotional right it
[1:19:39] seems like things are hard but I'm still
[1:19:41] going to believe Hallelujah but they're
[1:19:43] crying worldly sorrow verse two and all
[1:19:46] the children of Israel murmured against
[1:19:48] Moses and against Aaron and the whole
[1:19:50] congregation said to them would God that
[1:19:52] we had died in the land of Egypt or
[1:19:53] would God we had died in the
[1:19:56] wilderness so
[1:20:00] sad verse 29 your carcasses shall fall
[1:20:03] in this Wilderness so in other words
[1:20:04] you're not going to make the baptism of
[1:20:05] the Holy
[1:20:07] Ghost now none of us are perfect brother
[1:20:09] BR like I said brother Bram battle a
[1:20:10] critical spirit but I'm saying once you
[1:20:13] realize you got it repent of it and get
[1:20:15] that Spirit off
[1:20:16] you right verse
[1:20:20] 29 your carcasses shall fall in this
[1:20:22] Wilderness and all that were numbered of
[1:20:24] you according to your whole number from
[1:20:25] 20 years old and upward which have
[1:20:27] murmured against
[1:20:29] me see murmur against God or the
[1:20:31] five-fold ministry or brother brand
[1:20:33] people can murmur against whoever but
[1:20:35] look these are the sins look at this
[1:20:37] idolatry which was loud music and uh
[1:20:40] sexy dancing and sexy clothes
[1:20:43] fornication right going with the
[1:20:44] nominations or people just for sexual
[1:20:46] pleasure G unlawful
[1:20:48] Gatherings tempting Christ because you
[1:20:51] don't have water like it's the it's the
[1:20:53] preacher's fault or it's it's God's
[1:20:55] fault it's a test you just got to be a
[1:20:56] little more
[1:20:57] patient and then murmuring so he gives
[1:21:00] four what's the four number four is the
[1:21:01] number of the Earthly number so four
[1:21:04] trials on
[1:21:05] Earth murmuring these are the four and
[1:21:08] he said this is for us everybody say
[1:21:11] this is for me ready this is for me this
[1:21:13] is for you this is for
[1:21:15] me fornication murdering I'm sorry
[1:21:18] murmuring uh tempting the Lord idolatry
[1:21:21] this is for us uh no brother it's for
[1:21:23] some other Church I think we know it's
[1:21:25] for us
[1:21:27] hallelujah this is for the book of Acts
[1:21:30] Church Hallelujah that God is restoring
[1:21:33] I'm glad to be a part of it praise
[1:21:35] God so see we all need reminders brother
[1:21:38] man said his spirital I'm sorry his
[1:21:40] critical spirit was Haunting him there
[1:21:42] in the 50s and we know he battled all
[1:21:44] the way up to standing in the Gap 1963
[1:21:46] where he said well if they won't receive
[1:21:47] it I'll just go up he said I lost the
[1:21:49] feeling of the people just like Moses
[1:21:51] when he said Rebels brother man was
[1:21:53] comparing himself to brother uh to
[1:21:54] brother Moses yeah there we go uh and
[1:21:57] then but then he got the victory right
[1:21:59] the the the angel said you're not an Old
[1:22:01] Testament Prophet you have many
[1:22:03] Apostolic gifts right you're a new
[1:22:06] testament
[1:22:07] prophet and we've just come through this
[1:22:09] tell it to the church situation and the
[1:22:11] main sin that I saw was murmuring false
[1:22:14] accusations Hallelujah so I found this
[1:22:17] church the Bible's always applicable to
[1:22:19] our lives praise God whether I'm
[1:22:21] preaching in Corinthians whether I'm
[1:22:23] preaching in Hosea about backsliding
[1:22:25] whether I'm preaching a revelation about
[1:22:27] the Seven Seals there's always going to
[1:22:28] be something that applies to the church
[1:22:30] hallelujah it's an eternal book praise
[1:22:33] God that's
[1:22:35] right
[1:22:38] Glory I can see I'm probably not going
[1:22:41] to get through this chapter
[1:22:43] today maybe we'll
[1:22:46] see because some of it's review like uh
[1:22:48] the last uh the last 10 verses are very
[1:22:51] repetitive they say a lot of the same
[1:22:53] things Romans 14 say so we'll see we
[1:22:55] might we might get verse 11 now all
[1:22:57] these things happen unto them for
[1:23:00] amples okay so we're supposed to learn
[1:23:03] all these things happen for the New
[1:23:05] Testament
[1:23:06] Church why oh that just makes it more
[1:23:08] beautiful with the three works of Grace
[1:23:10] right because we would have to come out
[1:23:11] of Egypt right justification we'd have
[1:23:14] to go through the red sea water baptism
[1:23:16] we'd have to go through the Wilderness
[1:23:17] sanctification and then we want to
[1:23:19] possess the promised land we want to go
[1:23:21] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost there
[1:23:23] it is
[1:23:26] new heart new spirit my
[1:23:28] spirit three works of
[1:23:31] Grace Cam and I just recorded or yeah we
[1:23:33] last week we recorded the next podcast
[1:23:35] on the um on the Bible versions and we
[1:23:38] saw numerous of these verses they
[1:23:40] changed to get rid of the three works of
[1:23:42] Grace the dominations do not like three
[1:23:44] works of Grace and they'll throw every
[1:23:47] dirty word at you oh you're a legalist
[1:23:49] you're a heretic uh no uh they say you
[1:23:52] haven't been to school no I've been to
[1:23:54] the school of the
[1:23:55] scripture like brother brandom said I've
[1:23:57] been to the school of
[1:23:58] scripture you're the one trying to
[1:24:00] change the Bible not me I'm trying to
[1:24:03] stay with the Bible and the church said
[1:24:05] remember he said don't add one word
[1:24:07] don't take one word
[1:24:10] away and you know do you know what the
[1:24:12] uh the new the new versions do to
[1:24:14] Revelation 18 they say uh if any man
[1:24:18] taketh away the words of the life Words
[1:24:20] of Life from this book The the Amplified
[1:24:22] cam showed it to me the Amplified says
[1:24:24] his part will be taken out of the Tree
[1:24:26] of
[1:24:28] Life church that's a see see the the
[1:24:31] Slick lie of that that's not what the
[1:24:33] Bible says the Bible said Your name's
[1:24:35] taken out of the Book of Life see what
[1:24:38] the new versions do oh now well you just
[1:24:40] miss out on a few bites of fruit in the
[1:24:42] future home Austin that's all they miss
[1:24:43] out on for changing the Bible but you
[1:24:45] still get to be there uh no you
[1:24:48] don't the Bible said Your name's not
[1:24:50] even in the book see how the devil see
[1:24:53] why they do that because the devil's
[1:24:54] anointing these people well well I'm
[1:24:56] going to take words away but I'm still
[1:24:57] going to be saved no you're not not if
[1:25:00] you take away the words of God on I'm
[1:25:03] talking about on
[1:25:04] purpose
[1:25:06] Hallelujah right just like blasphemy
[1:25:08] blasphemy if it's done ignorantly well
[1:25:09] God will look past that and if you're
[1:25:11] real real child of God you'll repent of
[1:25:12] that we saw it right we see it when we
[1:25:15] preach on that on backsliding and uh uh
[1:25:18] yeah the blasphemy against the Holy
[1:25:19] Ghost when brother Chris heard on that
[1:25:21] and he was uh hearing the same thing God
[1:25:23] was discerning in the thoughts and Tents
[1:25:25] of his
[1:25:26] heart so Church all these things all
[1:25:28] these five experiences plus these four
[1:25:30] sins were written for our help and our
[1:25:35] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:25:37] world are come think about that church
[1:25:38] we're living right at the end of the
[1:25:39] world we're living right at the end we
[1:25:41] can look back and see oh my all this has
[1:25:43] happened to get the bride to get a bride
[1:25:45] ready for Jesus Oh My Hallelujah and I
[1:25:48] know feels like you got your whole life
[1:25:49] in front of you that's how I felt 21
[1:25:51] years ago and when I heard the message
[1:25:52] too or 24 now oh my goodness I heard the
[1:25:55] 2021 yes I'm sorry 2001 so 24 years ago
[1:25:58] but it's going to go like this so make
[1:26:00] sure you give every
[1:26:01] yeara make sure because the years are
[1:26:03] just going to go like this make sure you
[1:26:05] give every year to Jesus Christ no
[1:26:07] matter when he comes you're ready when
[1:26:09] he comes
[1:26:11] Hallelujah so we can see the end of the
[1:26:13] world
[1:26:14] conditions verse 12 wherefore let him
[1:26:18] that thinketh he standeth take he lest
[1:26:20] he fall don't raise your hands but how
[1:26:22] many think you're standing for Christ
[1:26:23] today
[1:26:25] all right well then you then you're
[1:26:27] given a direct command since you think
[1:26:29] you're standing you better take you
[1:26:31] better check up and make sure you don't
[1:26:34] fall how many people have we seen fall
[1:26:37] in our church fall into one of these
[1:26:39] sins that we've been through right we've
[1:26:42] seen it so many times I've seen it so
[1:26:43] many times over the years that's why
[1:26:44] I've told people in my office I don't
[1:26:46] care who leaves or comes or goes I'm
[1:26:47] going to serve Jesus because my faith
[1:26:49] isn't in somebody else my faith is in
[1:26:51] Christ I don't have the faith of sister
[1:26:53] so- and so I don't have the faith of
[1:26:55] brother so and so I don't have the faith
[1:26:56] of my mom I got the faith of Jesus
[1:26:58] Christ Hallelujah that's the faith I got
[1:27:03] Hallelujah my hope is built on nothing
[1:27:05] less than brothers so and so and
[1:27:07] righteous no than Jesus blood and
[1:27:09] righteousness that's what my hope is
[1:27:11] built on so let people come and go I've
[1:27:14] seen it for almost two decades they just
[1:27:16] come and go let them keep going the real
[1:27:18] believer will keep walking on with
[1:27:19] Christ
[1:27:20] Hallelujah that's right amen that's
[1:27:23] right
[1:27:25] let him that thinks he stands in this
[1:27:26] message take heed lest he fall so be
[1:27:30] careful that you don't fall to one of
[1:27:32] these sins as well idolatry fornication
[1:27:35] tempting Christ
[1:27:37] murmuring this is for our admonition
[1:27:40] this is for our
[1:27:42] correction and don't forget church this
[1:27:44] is all written right after verse 25 in
[1:27:47] chapter 9 said every man that striveth
[1:27:49] for the Mastery who's striving for the
[1:27:51] Rapture you must be temperate in all
[1:27:54] things so it doesn't mean you're not
[1:27:56] going to be tempted you're going to be
[1:27:57] tempted with idolatry you're going to be
[1:27:59] tempted with fornication or adultery or
[1:28:01] something like that you're going to be
[1:28:02] tempted to speak against God you're
[1:28:03] going to be tempted to murmur against
[1:28:05] and
[1:28:06] complain but if you got the anointing of
[1:28:08] the Holy Ghost you'll overcome it
[1:28:10] because you have control over these
[1:28:12] things Hallelujah that's what it is it's
[1:28:14] self-control it's the control of the
[1:28:16] Holy Spirit over this human
[1:28:20] Temple because the temple of God is your
[1:28:22] body which Temple you are the temple the
[1:28:24] Holy
[1:28:27] Ghost so this is the context I'm trying
[1:28:31] to win a race Glory I'm trying to get to
[1:28:33] the promised land or for me I'm trying
[1:28:34] to stay in the promised land I'm trying
[1:28:36] to drive out all now all these Devils
[1:28:38] that are trying to invade my land I'm
[1:28:40] I'm trying to fight them and drive them
[1:28:42] out because I'm already there but I'm
[1:28:43] still fighting battles I'm still pushing
[1:28:45] the Giants Out Sister beatress
[1:28:47] Hallelujah remember they had to drive
[1:28:49] out the
[1:28:51] Giants so there was Giants before I
[1:28:53] could show that Moses that they they
[1:28:55] fought Giants uh there uh in in the
[1:28:57] sanctification but they also fought
[1:28:59] Giants in the land as well that's right
[1:29:04] so see you're going to have giants
[1:29:05] either way let's get to the promised
[1:29:06] land where there's power amen let's get
[1:29:08] to the promised land where we've got the
[1:29:09] promise of verses that give us Victory
[1:29:12] we can enjoy the blessings of God where
[1:29:14] all things are possible to them that
[1:29:16] believe
[1:29:17] hallelujah
[1:29:19] hallelujah thank you
[1:29:22] Lord now let's remember this I love this
[1:29:24] verse some people misunderstand this
[1:29:26] verse but I I've just been be I've
[1:29:28] become aware of it recently there hath
[1:29:31] no
[1:29:32] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:29:35] common to man you're not the only one
[1:29:37] that's battled
[1:29:39] that you're not a special case that uh
[1:29:43] uh well no one's ever been tested as
[1:29:44] hard as me that's why I can give in
[1:29:46] that's a
[1:29:48] lie well I I should have pity on myself
[1:29:50] no one's been through what I've been
[1:29:51] through that's a lie somebody's been
[1:29:53] through through
[1:29:56] it it's common to all men someone has
[1:30:00] been through the difficulties you've
[1:30:01] been through and you've heard me say
[1:30:04] before I've never been tempted like job
[1:30:05] and I don't want to
[1:30:07] be I I'm not going to ask for
[1:30:10] that that's just one simple example when
[1:30:12] was the last time all your family died
[1:30:14] on the same day your wife your children
[1:30:16] every I'm not wife your all your
[1:30:18] children you lost all your money on the
[1:30:19] same day and you lost your health not
[1:30:21] long after that it's never happened to
[1:30:22] anybody here very very few people I ever
[1:30:25] know had this ever happened to let's not
[1:30:27] act like we're job if we're not like job
[1:30:31] right this is common we've all you the
[1:30:34] same battle you fought I probably fought
[1:30:36] it in some other way just a little
[1:30:38] different uh a little different approach
[1:30:39] from
[1:30:41] Satan I love this but God is
[1:30:45] faithful we all we all get tested but
[1:30:48] God remains faithful I'm glad when I'm
[1:30:50] unfaithful God is faithful still
[1:30:52] Hallelujah
[1:30:55] Glory I can say someone's some
[1:30:57] preacher's been through this before I'm
[1:30:59] not the only preacher that's been
[1:31:00] through this before I'm not the only one
[1:31:01] that's been tested like this there's
[1:31:03] been some other preacher I love when I
[1:31:04] can find it right in the Bible sister be
[1:31:07] I love when I can find somebody just
[1:31:08] went through this just like I am right
[1:31:10] and I can gain courage from that praise
[1:31:12] God and God will be faithful if I want
[1:31:14] to overcome it God will help me overcome
[1:31:16] it praise God let's be the let's be in
[1:31:19] the group that want to overcome it and
[1:31:22] not give into it brother Chris gave a
[1:31:24] good reminder to me last week he and I
[1:31:26] were talking there and I it's probably
[1:31:27] okay that I share this cuz I'm just
[1:31:28] going to leave out this the specifics
[1:31:30] but he said he was tempted recently in
[1:31:32] an area and he said he went right to his
[1:31:33] Bible and got Victory he said he felt
[1:31:35] the demons
[1:31:36] leave he said but then a couple weeks
[1:31:38] later it came uh the the the Temptation
[1:31:41] came harder and it he went to the Bible
[1:31:43] and it didn't leave and he said brother
[1:31:45] Jesse what happened and I said the verse
[1:31:47] just came to my mind that demon went and
[1:31:49] got seven more and came back and he said
[1:31:54] and he said 'w why can't I overcome
[1:31:55] because now you're fighting eight of
[1:31:56] them instead of one I said so you've got
[1:31:59] to go to Greater lengths to overcome
[1:32:01] eight if I was in a fight with eight
[1:32:04] people I'd fight differently than just
[1:32:05] one
[1:32:06] person hallelujah thank God I'm not the
[1:32:09] most we've done at Ty one knows too you
[1:32:10] fight two people at a time Eight's

[1:32:13] story but he he's like that's right
[1:32:15] brother Jesse oh yes he said uh so we
[1:32:18] were talking about that and that's a
[1:32:19] good reminder for us all just because
[1:32:20] we've defeated something in the past
[1:32:22] doesn't mean it's going to stay away
[1:32:23] it's actually coming back next time and
[1:32:26] we got to be more willing and more able
[1:32:28] and more uh in tune with God to be able
[1:32:30] to overcome it the next time Hallelujah
[1:32:32] but don't forget God's faithful
[1:32:35] Hallelujah he will make a way look at
[1:32:37] the verse says he won't allow you he
[1:32:40] won't allow you to be tempted above your
[1:32:41] strength and that includes his
[1:32:45] strength right because you're not
[1:32:46] fighting your battle all alone right
[1:32:48] you're fighting a battle that's already
[1:32:49] been won he's given you the power Jesus
[1:32:52] overcame all these sins so now now his
[1:32:54] spirit's in you so you can overcome all
[1:32:56] those sins
[1:32:58] Hallelujah but will with the Temptation
[1:33:00] he'll make a way see that's why I love
[1:33:02] that song God will make a way where
[1:33:04] there seems to be no way he works in
[1:33:07] ways we cannot see right he will make a
[1:33:09] way for me this is in
[1:33:12] Temptation right whether you got one
[1:33:14] demon or you got eight demons I don't
[1:33:16] know if they double after I I don't know
[1:33:18] if they get seven more and then we get
[1:33:20] uh 15 I don't know I don't know if it
[1:33:23] keeps increasing like that but either
[1:33:24] way we've got the sword of the spirit
[1:33:27] you got the you've got the greatest
[1:33:29] weapon that was ever given to man
[1:33:30] Hallelujah God gave you the greatest
[1:33:32] weapon it is written God says this God
[1:33:35] says that we've got the greatest weapon
[1:33:38] so Whom Shall We Fear Hallelujah right
[1:33:40] who are we going to be afraid of a bunch
[1:33:43] of devils or we're going to fear God
[1:33:44] let's fear God hallelujah we fear God
[1:33:47] more than we fear Devils let's keep his
[1:33:49] word
[1:33:51] hallelujah so your your experience
[1:33:53] that's not that's not so hard that you
[1:33:55] can't overcome let's not see that's why
[1:33:57] I was telling uh somebody we don't want
[1:33:59] to we don't want to baby Spirits I'm not
[1:34:02] going to Baby Spirits you shouldn't baby
[1:34:05] spirits and give into evil spirits
[1:34:08] whether acting sad or however they're
[1:34:10] acting whether they're acting real
[1:34:12] friendly or whether it's like Delilah oh
[1:34:14] I love you so much don't give in Devil
[1:34:17] Spirits
[1:34:19] Hallelujah don't give into
[1:34:21] them and I thought of this this morning
[1:34:24] Church you're going to be tempted to lie
[1:34:25] like Abraham but but you'll tell the
[1:34:28] truth hallelujah you'll be tempted to
[1:34:31] commit adultery like David but you'll be
[1:34:33] faithful to your
[1:34:35] vows right you'll be tempted to curse
[1:34:38] God like his wife said why don't you
[1:34:39] curse God and die you'll be tempted to
[1:34:41] that but you'll overcome and you'll
[1:34:43] bless God
[1:34:44] hallelujah why because God's going to
[1:34:46] make a way out Hallelujah you'll be
[1:34:50] tempted to exalt yourself like you bunch
[1:34:52] of rebels I'm the only one you name call
[1:34:54] everybody in the church but you'll
[1:34:56] overcome and as we've seen some people
[1:34:59] might strive for power like cor and
[1:35:01] Dayan but not the the children of God
[1:35:03] the children of God will submit to the
[1:35:05] word of God hallelujah you'll be content
[1:35:07] with what God has given
[1:35:13] you Hallelujah well I I know Heaven's
[1:35:15] amen and by God's
[1:35:18] grace you might run from God's call like
[1:35:20] Jonah but God's going to come running
[1:35:22] after you praise God
[1:35:24] that's God's mercy God's goodness is
[1:35:26] running after you he's going to chase
[1:35:27] you down get you on the right path right
[1:35:31] that's right Hallelujah see in the in
[1:35:34] the time of Temptation he'll make a way
[1:35:36] for you to
[1:35:38] escape and you'll be able to Bear
[1:35:42] it oh man I'm down to two minutes
[1:35:44] unbelievable
[1:35:45] okay can't believe
[1:35:48] that now some some people have said this
[1:35:52] um well the Bible says Temptations will
[1:35:54] never be above your ability or in the
[1:35:56] Greek it means power or that's what I
[1:35:58] like right here
[1:36:00] resources brother brandham says it
[1:36:02] plainly we are no match for Satan
[1:36:04] Satan's more than a match for us so when
[1:36:07] we when we realize that we're we're we
[1:36:10] you know we'll never have a Temptation
[1:36:12] uh that we can't overcome it's talking
[1:36:13] about we have to take Christ's word to
[1:36:15] do it of our own selves none of us could
[1:36:19] defeat Satan but with Christ we're more
[1:36:22] than conquerors in Christ Jesus Jesus
[1:36:25] Hallelujah because greater the sources
[1:36:27] we have is the spirit of God the
[1:36:29] resource we have is the sword of the
[1:36:31] spirit the word of God greater is he
[1:36:33] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:36:35] world
[1:36:36] Hallelujah he makes a way Escape because
[1:36:38] he is the way the truth and the
[1:36:42] life
[1:36:44] now so I heard a preacher say this but
[1:36:46] he was using this in the next book to
[1:36:49] show that sometimes we are tested above
[1:36:52] Abel and I said no I think you
[1:36:53] misunderstood this for we would not
[1:36:56] Brethren have you ignorant of our
[1:36:57] trouble which came to us in Asia that we
[1:36:59] were pressed out of measure above
[1:37:02] strength in so much that we despaired
[1:37:04] even of life now we don't have time to
[1:37:07] go there but in Acts
[1:37:09] 19 all this multitude came against Paul
[1:37:12] because he was against Diana and the
[1:37:14] silver smith remember that and remember
[1:37:16] Church they shouted for two hours so
[1:37:18] Paul's in this mob of people shouting to
[1:37:20] kill him for two hours and this is what
[1:37:22] he's talking about for two hours he
[1:37:24] thought this mob was going to rip him to
[1:37:27] pieces this is what he's talking about
[1:37:29] and he said this is pressed out of
[1:37:31] measure so this this felt like it was
[1:37:33] above anything I could
[1:37:35] handle this was above my strength
[1:37:37] because he's surrounded by a mob and
[1:37:39] angry mob wanting to kill him shouting
[1:37:41] for two hours let's kill Paul let's kill
[1:37:42] Paul now church if then you read chapter
[1:37:45] 20 the first thing he does he's he gets
[1:37:47] out of there he says let's go to another
[1:37:49] city let's get out of this place because
[1:37:51] these guys are going to kill me
[1:37:55] but see he says it seems like in this
[1:37:57] case there's my hour he said it felt
[1:38:00] like I was pressed all the pressure and
[1:38:02] all the violence coming around me I felt
[1:38:05] like it was I was pressed out of measure
[1:38:08] and I despaired even of life in other
[1:38:10] words job said I wish I wasn't born
[1:38:12] remember Jeremiah he cursed the day he
[1:38:13] was born such Trials of being arrested
[1:38:15] and thrown into a pit almost drowning in
[1:38:17] a pit of mud just for preaching the
[1:38:20] gospel just telling him thus sayith the
[1:38:21] Lord and he said but we have the
[1:38:23] sentence of death in ourselves that
[1:38:24] means they knew they were going to
[1:38:26] die so for two hours the men are violent
[1:38:29] pushing and the the crowd is surround
[1:38:31] him he's like I'm just going to die here
[1:38:33] he thought he was pressed above measure
[1:38:36] like he couldn't handle it but what
[1:38:37] happened church that we should not trust
[1:38:39] in ourselves but in God which raised the
[1:38:42] dead so what happened he delivered
[1:38:45] us hallelujah see it wasn't above
[1:38:49] measure it felt like it but it wasn't he
[1:38:53] he had to wait two long hours but after
[1:38:55] when was the last time you fought sin
[1:38:56] for two
[1:38:58] hours now I'm talk that's what I was
[1:39:01] talking about brother Chris you got to
[1:39:02] fight longer than five
[1:39:04] minutes Paul thought I'm dead for two
[1:39:06] hours I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead but
[1:39:07] finally God come down delivered his
[1:39:09] servant out of there and he said why did
[1:39:12] he do this because in whom we trust that
[1:39:15] he would now when he was pressed beyond
[1:39:17] what he thought was measure now God had
[1:39:19] a chance to teach him I'll even protect
[1:39:21] you in this too Hallelujah so now trust
[1:39:24] you more next time because you were with
[1:39:26] me in the midst of this fire you'll be
[1:39:28] with me again you've taught me a lesson
[1:39:30] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:39:32] that's in the world hallelujah
[1:39:35] amen so see God's going to allow us to
[1:39:37] go through a new season right a harder
[1:39:40] test than we've ever had before we've
[1:39:42] just come through a hard test in our
[1:39:43] church we haven't had one like this like
[1:39:45] I told you we have never had to tell to
[1:39:47] the church before but in each time if we
[1:39:49] keep true to God God will give us more
[1:39:52] grace amen and will'll learn to trust
[1:39:54] God the next
[1:39:56] time God will Deliver us from our
[1:39:59] trials it will teach us to trust in God
[1:40:04] see they some people say oh see this is
[1:40:06] th this this negates or it does away
[1:40:08] with First Corinthians 10:13 it can't
[1:40:10] it's got to all it's got to all be
[1:40:12] harmonious church it's all written by
[1:40:14] the Holy
[1:40:16] Ghost God will not allow you to go
[1:40:18] through something that you cannot handle
[1:40:20] you might have to hold on for hours but
[1:40:22] God will bring bring you through it if
[1:40:23] you want a way out of it
[1:40:27] Hallelujah so this proves they were able
[1:40:29] to withstand the trial although they
[1:40:31] thought they were going to die they just
[1:40:33] hung on to God God brought them
[1:40:37] through Hallelujah now I've had a few
[1:40:40] times just I've just had a few times
[1:40:41] where I was near death right some car
[1:40:43] accidents like like I told you on the
[1:40:45] way to college we spun my buddy was
[1:40:47] going 90 miles per hour I'm like dude
[1:40:49] slow down and he slam on the brakes and
[1:40:51] we slid across four lanes and as soon as
[1:40:53] we stopped right by the the concrete
[1:40:55] barrier then all these 18 wheelers drove
[1:40:57] by God spared my life there now I
[1:40:59] thought I was going to die in Guyana
[1:41:01] when I first got there because we're
[1:41:02] driving through the the city and there
[1:41:04] was these men with machine guns and they
[1:41:05] were staring at and the the guy said
[1:41:07] they don't like Christians very much
[1:41:08] here like oh God have mercy what did I
[1:41:11] sign myself up
[1:41:12] for but you know I what I'm saying is I
[1:41:15] haven't been that close but the times
[1:41:17] that I had been close and I felt like
[1:41:18] the planes were going to crash and we
[1:41:19] were flying through lightning and
[1:41:20] thundering and storms the times that I
[1:41:22] had been close God is held the Anchor's
[1:41:25] held Hallelujah and I haven't even been
[1:41:27] that close other than the car
[1:41:29] accidents which thank God God's
[1:41:31] protected
[1:41:32] us so see God will press us maybe beyond
[1:41:36] what we thought we could handle but in
[1:41:37] every case God is faithful God Will Make
[1:41:40] A Way Out of the Temptation or the trial
[1:41:43] every understand
[1:41:44] that all
[1:41:47] right that's my hour so yeah I should
[1:41:49] probably stop here let's see it probably
[1:41:50] be a good spot to stop right here where
[1:41:53] therefore my dear dearly beloved flee
[1:41:55] from
[1:41:57] idolatry so he ends this section
[1:41:59] actually verse 15 is the next one but
[1:42:02] I'll just read it I speak as to wise men
[1:42:05] judge ye what you say now did I yes I
[1:42:09] did so think about this idolatry loud m
[1:42:13] music drunkenness dancing sexual sin
[1:42:17] fornication mixed meetings with with
[1:42:19] people that aren't in the message really
[1:42:20] have the Holy Ghost tempting Christ
[1:42:22] getting mad at God murmuring against
[1:42:24] anyone any leader or anybody in the
[1:42:26] church it don't have to be the leader it
[1:42:27] could be anybody in the church murmuring
[1:42:29] against all these were written that we
[1:42:31] would learn and that and that we would
[1:42:34] do this in the moment of Temptation my
[1:42:37] dearly beloved we must flee from
[1:42:39] idolatry you must run from that
[1:42:44] situation here's what it means and I'm
[1:42:46] closing with that so just so you can see
[1:42:48] what does flee mean in the Greek
[1:42:53] you go that's the English way to
[1:42:56] say to
[1:42:58] escape You Must Escape murmuring we must
[1:43:02] escape tempting Christ right don't join
[1:43:04] in with that kind of
[1:43:06] sin right the Bible said you that are
[1:43:09] are Meek go to them and try to correct
[1:43:11] them but be careful that that Spirit
[1:43:12] doesn't jump on you that's what the
[1:43:15] Bible says Galatians 61
[1:43:18] and2 so what must what must we do church
[1:43:21] when we're tempted to flee away seek
[1:43:23] safety by flight to flee to shun just
[1:43:26] shun that thing just don't give it any
[1:43:29] attention get away from it as fast as
[1:43:32] you
[1:43:34] can flight run away from it drive away
[1:43:37] from it something abhor especially vices
[1:43:39] do everything in your power to get away
[1:43:41] from
[1:43:43] temptation to be saved by flight to
[1:43:46] escape safely out of danger poetically
[1:43:49] to flee away to vanish out of that
[1:43:53] atmosphere vanish out of the people and
[1:43:56] away from the people that do all those
[1:43:58] sins Hallelujah this is what advice
[1:44:01] would would a prophet of God give us
[1:44:03] vanish out of it Escape out of it flee
[1:44:06] from it do not partake in it and the
[1:44:10] church
[1:44:11] said
[1:44:12] amen all right let's stand on our feet
[1:44:14] I'm not going to get to this I could
[1:44:16] probably preach a couple hours here but
[1:44:17] I want to be mindful of the time
[1:44:18] musician malind video can come here by
[1:44:21] God's grace
[1:44:24] how many appreciate 1 Corinthians
[1:44:26] chapter 10 praise God appreciate that
[1:44:28] what a great reminder for us who's this
[1:44:30] written for written for us oh you know
[1:44:32] this is for somebody else no no no no
[1:44:34] this is for bride of Christ Fellowship
[1:44:36] this is for me this is for you I need
[1:44:38] this kind of preaching we all need this
[1:44:40] kind of preaching if you think you're
[1:44:42] standing if you think you're so strong
[1:44:43] today you better take heed lest you
[1:44:46] fall because we've how we've seen the
[1:44:48] Mighty Fall think about that David song
[1:44:49] how the Mighty
[1:44:51] Fall people we think are so mighty
[1:44:53] spiritually and such gifted uh gifted
[1:44:56] people and I'm talking about all over
[1:44:57] all the years all these people people I
[1:45:00] thought preachers that I thought were so
[1:45:01] so anointed and I've seen them fall how
[1:45:04] the Mighty
[1:45:06] Fall may God have mercy on us let's take
[1:45:10] heed to our lives today let's bow our
[1:45:11] heads for a word of
[1:45:13] prayer uh play uh spirit of living God
[1:45:16] fall fresh on me because if we let the
[1:45:17] spirit of God fall fresh on us then we
[1:45:19] won't let these other spirits of uh
[1:45:22] tempting God murmuring idolatry
[1:45:25] fornication sexual sins we won't let
[1:45:27] those Spirits fall on us if the spirit
[1:45:29] of God is on us I just saw this morning
[1:45:32] as you play that Malachi just what did I
[1:45:34] read in
[1:45:38] Isaiah where is
[1:45:41] it yeah my chapter this
[1:45:46] morning I'm going to read
[1:45:48] this church this is what I believe
[1:45:50] happened remember we preached on at the
[1:45:52] beginning of this series God gives you
[1:45:53] the desire your heart God gave balam
[1:45:55] what he really wanted he wanted money he
[1:45:57] wanted to be an evil teacher so God gave
[1:45:59] it to him I read this in Isaiah this
[1:46:02] morning Isaiah 19:14 the Lord hath
[1:46:04] mingled a perverse spirit in the midst
[1:46:06] thereof and they have caused Egypt to
[1:46:09] air in every work thereof as a drunken
[1:46:11] man stagger in his vomit so what am I
[1:46:14] saying I'm saying just like this
[1:46:15] Corinthians chapter here God sometimes
[1:46:17] allows God allows evil spirits to come
[1:46:19] in there to see if the people are going
[1:46:21] to overcome or not
[1:46:23] God mingled it didn't the Bible say God
[1:46:26] sent the evil spirit on sa isn't that
[1:46:28] what the Bible said it's right there in
[1:46:30] First Kings I'm sorry it's 1st Samuel 6
[1:46:33] put put that up there 1st Samuel
[1:46:35] 16:14 God allowed this in here you think
[1:46:38] was it brother Jesse's fault was it my
[1:46:39] fault was it the sister's fault God
[1:46:41] allowed it it's a
[1:46:43] test remember God allowed three million
[1:46:45] people to have no water and the church
[1:46:47] said what kind of God would do that a a
[1:46:50] wise God who wants to see who will watch
[1:46:54] their tongue who will trust in God for
[1:46:57] just a few more hours by God's grace who
[1:46:59] can hang on a few more hours glory to
[1:47:01] God
[1:47:03] Amen put that up there H would you uh
[1:47:05] 1st Samuel 16 I got four Witnesses
[1:47:08] sometimes God allows these evil spirits
[1:47:10] to come in to see which side we're going
[1:47:12] to stand
[1:47:13] on but the spirit of Lord departed from
[1:47:15] Saul and an evil spirit from
[1:47:18] who the devil no God allowed it because
[1:47:23] Saul was angry and jealous of David so
[1:47:25] God gave him what he
[1:47:27] wanted God allowed
[1:47:29] that put up uh First Kings 22:22 this is
[1:47:33] with Mah we preached on this I think
[1:47:35] last
[1:47:37] week and the Lord said to him wherewith
[1:47:39] and he said I will go forth and I'll be
[1:47:40] a lying spear in the mouth of All His
[1:47:42] prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade
[1:47:43] him go forth and do so God sends the
[1:47:47] lying
[1:47:49] Spirit to test the people are going to
[1:47:53] stand with M and Elijah you going to
[1:47:55] stand with brother Bram or you going to
[1:47:56] stand with the people
[1:48:00] sinning last one job 1 vers2 yep is it
