testimony this evening and uh but we'll just sing this song i don't know if if you know it but uh it's that song uh uh i won't go back to the way it used to be i just thought it might be fitting to sing right now just because testimony we're not we're praising the lord for the things he's brought us from and we're not going back do you know that song uh it's pretty easy but let's can you give me

[Applause] the scripture says it's impossible for those that were once enlightened and have tasted the good word of god to renew under repentance but we're not as such amen we tasted the good word of god and we're going to press forward we're going to go keep going amen praise the lord [Applause] amen thank you i appreciate i'm just impressed with with your brother malachi and sister lydia with your musical abilities and brother amen i'd sir i so enjoy it it's a it's a it's it's a a joy to hear you know even such a small space you know you don't feel like oh we don't have a lot of musicians but you know what you can feel the heart in it and the real inspiration and it and it fills the room by the grace of god and it it really brings the spirit of the lord down i believe he's pleased with those sacrifices so you know by the grace of god we'll just give our testimony this evening brother jesse had asked me to do it last time and i and i didn't feel led but last night kind of right after the service i just lord really impressed upon my heart like it'll be a good time to do it so you know we want to you know no matter what your intentions are unless you do something in the season god desires you to do it it'll never be as effective so we believe that you know as that song even said right now is the moment today is the day so we'll uh we'll do that by the grace of god but uh we'll turn into a couple scriptures here first if we can uh the first one we'll do uh proverbs 22 and verse one and then we're after that we're going to turn to hosea chapter 11. so just kind of have that in mind how many feel good to be in the house of the lord this evening it's good to see everyone out here sister wendy good to see you again so soon i'm uh you've probably heard i mean if you're listening to service yesterday but i told the testimony about being able to see at the restaurant so it's good to see you again and all those that were able to make it out here and and uh we're just grateful to the lord jesus so uh proverbs chapter 22 verse 1 says a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold amen and then we'll turn over to hosea chapter 11. and if you read if you were to read this whole thing you'll find out that it's quite a rebuke actually on the children of israel but i just want to pull out one scripture here in particular because i believe for all of us we could say that this typifies the life that we've been given in christ and what he's done for us in uh verse chapter 11 verse 4 the lord says i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid unto them neat and i laid meat unto them amen i've always been so struck by that scripture i it's that he drew them with bands of love and i and i know he drew me with bands of love and and i think all of us could have that testimony so as we'll just have a word of prayer and then just ask the lord to lead us and guide us in the little service this evening heavenly father lord as we just come before you once again to fellowship around your word lord and as again it's fallen my lot to to be behind the sacred desk this evening lord and just to give my testimony of what you've done for me and lord as we've even heard before it said that if you can't tell anything just tell how the candle got lit lord lord we want to tell that lord and maybe even a little more of the things that you've done since that time and lord more than anything father and all these things we want to give you glory father for there's no one else worthy lord there's no one else that's holy lord there's no one else oh god that was worthy lord to take the book and to loose the seals thereon father lord and we glorify the name of the lord jesus christ this evening lord we lift you up and magnify your name lord lord and everything that's said and done may be a glory to you father may give all glory and honor and praise to you father may you just anoint the speaker anoint the here lord may you just be get glory unto thyself this evening father and may you just anoint us lord to draw closer unto you father we ask these things father right now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats so i've maybe never given my testimony in such a we'd say an official capacity you know up here but uh you just bear with me we'll just kind of talk and wherever the lord would go we'll go with that but uh for those of you that don't know me uh mj i believe your names good good to meet you good to see you and you know by the grace of god always good to see new faces pressing into the kingdom in this dark age you know you know the the light is a precious thing the light of the gospel is a precious thing in this age you know and the scripture said that in that day there'd be a famine not for food or drink but for of hearing of the word of god and we know you know there's it's such a we even spoke a little bit yesterday of the of the idea of a paradox and things that seem to be in complete contradiction to each other but are yet true and isn't it a paradox that you can go down the street and see a church on every corner but yet the scripture says that in the last day there'd be a famine for the word of god because the true word of god is a precious thing and we've seen how it's been perverted in so many ways and and those things and you know for those that don't know me i'm my name is randall scott verton you can call me brother randy you can just call me brother you can call me whatever you want to call me as long as as long as you as long as uh you know as long as i'm called in into the marriage suffer i think we'll be okay uh but i was uh just kind of i guess give you a background i was born december 28 1983 so i'm going to be 38 years old this year 2021 83 yeah so 38 this year and uh you know uh i you know i we don't you know we don't necessarily believe in christmas as it were but the world you know we use that as kind of a marking stone on the calendar and i always told people i'm the best christmas gift my parents ever received and i and knowing and knowing the truth of the gospel and the truth of the word i can say that without condemnation because we know jesus wasn't born on christmas so so i could say i'm not i'm not overstepping the bounds of the word of god by saying i was the best christmas gift my parents ever received because we don't go with that so but but you know i was born i was born there i was actually you know i was born in germany i was actually born in a a city called wiesbaden that's in the state of hessen or i guess province i don't know how they say it over there in germany but my dad was in the military he was in the air force and uh you know uh i was only there i don't speak any german or anything and i didn't have german citizenship because i was technically i think i was born on an air force base which is officially considered uh american soil which is uh which is kind of a powerful thing because if you think about it even though we're born in satan's eden physically our spiritual birth is in the in in the body of christ and even though we're inside inside than earth that seems to be owned by the devil is that we were born on property that he can't touch so our citizenship is in heaven so that's a pretty good inspiration right there i think that makes me feel really good about that so uh you know i i pray you just it's probably gonna be informal this evening so i trust you just bear with me i'd maybe i forgive me if i maybe joke a little too much or say i i'm a nervous person by nature so i get really i'm definitely not a public speaker by any means but we want him to speak anyway so but you know i was born there so i don't speak any german i was only there i think if i remember correctly i was only or i don't remember because i wasn't i was too young but i think my my dad told me we i was maybe only nine months old when they left because you know air force they kind of move you around so but uh just even a quick testimony even on my birth you know when i was born uh i for you know a period it was kind of a normal birth as far as they knew and then after a short period of time within a few weeks i couldn't eat i would they would try to feed me you know feed me a bottle or breastfeed me i don't know you know how it was but i would i would puke it all up shortly after i couldn't hold anything down and it would be kind of projectile vomiting where i just couldn't eat and they couldn't figure out what was wrong and they went to the doctors and they couldn't figure it out and and uh so they see the devil try to kill me right there you know and come to find out my parents uh went to doctors tried to find out and finally they found a doctor who was able to kind of deduce what it was and it was a it was a problem they call pyloric stenosis which i guess is actually reasonably common in in sometimes in children but if you know anatomy the pyloric valves are the little uh the little valves that open up into different parts usually of your intestines and things and the pyloric one is the one that opens from your stomach into the small intestine to begin digestion well pyloric stenosis is basically that muscle is kind of jammed shut and so i would eat but it couldn't get matched to stomach and i would just i would puke it up and my parents were really worried so they were able to do by the grace of the lord you know i'm still here so they did a little surgery on me when i was a baby they actually had to cut my stomach open and i have a scar to this day and they had to go in there and release it and i always kind of joked with people ever since that moment i never stopped eating because i like but i like to eat i really like to eat i didn't stop but you know but you know i see even then you know how the lord had grace on me you know that they were to find that so uh you know so growing up uh we lived in san antonio texas from there and my uh i have two younger sisters my first uh sister whose name is chelsea she was born in santa too young and then from there we moved up to to uh selfridge michigan which is kind of right on the eastern side i think if you were to look at michigan i think from your perspective it would look like that with the thumb over here selfridge i think is kind of right in this area it's right near a lake uh called lake saint clair which is a little lake kind of between the canadian and uh united states border there and air force base there and my other sister was born there and and uh i kind of always that's always a moment i kind of remember that's one of my most i'd say striking memories of my youth i don't some people have really good memories of their youth and i i kind of don't have a lot of memories of that and i don't know if it's because our home life might have not always been the greatest or something i don't know you know psychologists would try to tell you one reason or another why those things might be but uh one one striking memory i have was being there at the time in 1991 when the the gulf the first gulf war began and i and i always remembered that because as a child i was still i mean i guess 91 i would have been eight years old and i just remember having a great fear at that time because we were going to war and knowing that my dad was in the military at the time and he was just actually i didn't know but he was just actually getting out of the military and to go into what he would do later but i remember having a great fear and watching the news when i was a child and seeing the tanks going into iraq and kuwait and these things i was like oh my and it was just kind of a one of those seminal moments of your childhood that always kind of stuck with me and but by the grace of god my dad didn't have to do that he was he had gotten out of the military and gotten another job as an air traffic controller and so we ended up moving down to ohio you know an hour an hour and a half south or so and you know from there uh we ended up in uh springfield ohio so over there kind of kind of actually we're near where we ate dinner dinner with sister wendy and then the other night uh when we moved there i was in uh i think first and second grade and and then from there uh we moved over to delta ohio which is where i spent the majority of my childhood and graduating high school from and i moved there in third grade and uh you know the the lord just has a way when you look back it's amazing how i believe you know uh even brother jesse you know as i'm reading i was began to read your book a little bit i told you i started to read your book and on the the 12 revealed mysteries that we have in this that we've been received in this age and and one of the scriptures that stuck out to me that i'm always impressed by is how it pleases god to hide things you know it it god gets pleasure in hiding things and then revealing things to those who he would desire to do it to and and i find even in our own lives he does that to us without us even knowing i believe in the book of job it says that god would even implant instruction in a man's dream and then he and and maybe it's just my own little idea that i have but i've often we have that idea of deja vu where you'll have an instance like i've been here before and how many of you had that where you've been in a situation and it's almost like you could almost feel like you could reach out and tell what was going to happen because you know you've been there before and to me that's always been a comforting thing because i think about that scripture and job how lord perhaps you you know you've maybe four ordained this moment for me to be here and now i'm i'm actually living out that instruction that you've given to me you know but you've hidden it you know many times i feel the lord has to hide things from us because if it were up to us we'd try to put our hands into it and and we would mess it up but i reminded also of the scripture where in the old testament when the lord commanded the children of israel he said if you were to build an altar unto me he said do not lift do not lift up your tool upon mine altar for you will pollute it and how often we take the tools of man and our own ideas and our own our own thoughts on something and we try to mess around with the things of god without even knowing it but we're polluting the things of god which is one of the reasons why we understand god despises denominations so much because man takes their tools of intellect and theology and their own intellectual ideas and they put their hands to the word of god and the lord is holy and those those unholy hands that would try to try to grab the word of god and do something with it that's unrighteous how dare we would do such a thing you know so i i'm just always i'm amazed by that and i and i say all that to say from from the point on you know all your life leading up to certain moments god hides it many times from us and it isn't until there's a reason why you know there's i'm always amazed at how even in our language in in the the way that we've heard things how things are hidden even in our language the truths of god you know one thing i've said you know people use this as an insult and i don't think they understand how much of an insult it is and how how deep and evil it goes but how many of you heard the phrase have you if someone would look at something that someone does something silly or you know what we would call that stupid or so i hate to use that word but oh that was a stupid thing to do and they said what were you born in a barn did you know that's a direct reference to jesus christ because jesus christ was born in a barn you know i've always thought that struck me one day and i said my how how much of an unrighteous even saying that is but even in that declaring the works of god and they don't even know it you know to say because they thought it was an unrighteous thing to be born in a barn and he had a bad name you know we read in the scripture in proverbs there you know a good name is to be chosen rather than riches and gold and all these things and yet jesus humbled himself to come underneath the bad name of what what the world thought was infidelity and being what they thought was a bastard child and yet he bore that reproach for you and me and i thank the lord jesus for it i mean we can't even comprehend those things but uh again and you forgive me i i know i sometimes maybe ramble but we're just trusting it's the lord i trust for saying something to bless you so but i think about that phrase often about hindsight being 20 20. you know it's always easier and it's clearer once you pass something to look back and say oh this could have been this and i should have done that and it is true in our lives and how often we've crossed a path and we look back and see what the lord has done after the fact and how much of a how much of a hand he had in our lives you know and so you know i we moved over there into delta ohio and you know my parents had gotten saved i believe while they were in san antonio there was a oh i can't think of his name now brother jesse may be able to remind me of it but he was a great denominational minister that was uh john hagee was that was headquartered i believe in san antonio or somewhere in that might have been houston in that area and i don't think they had directly gone to his services but maybe watching it on the tv or something at the time the lord convicted them and brought them under under that and and the lord brought them to salvation by the grace of god and you know they served the lord the best they could and when we when we moved into delta uh they were looking for a church and they just happened upon delta assembly of god and uh and many you maybe heard some of the testimonies from obviously brother jesse and brother simon and and different ones maybe brother cam and we all went to that church together you know and it was it's such a that's another uh hindsight being 20 20 thing you see how the lord is able to bring these seeds together into one place at a certain time to hear the word of god and we went there when i was pretty young so i would have been you know this would have been you know i guess 93 or so something along that lines i'm not really good with dates when it comes to remembrance but i would have been in third grade and we started going to this delta assembly of god church was a assembly of god denomination and and uh by the grace of god to have a church to go to and everything and i remember being just such a a nervous child and i was always very socially awkward with people and we would go into the church service and at the time they hadn't built a new building yet but they had uh they had the little building that they used that was in the middle of town and chris sister kristen you might remember that how small that was and and they would have the song services and things and then they would release the children to go to sunday school and you went downstairs basically it was like a kind of a dungeon area it was so dark and damp and dank and but i just remember i used to be so scared of of being around people that i would uh because brother jesse's mom taught a lot of the sunday schools for the children down there and it wasn't her in particular it was just being around people and being nervous i would go and hide in the bathroom and i would stay in the bathroom for the whole sunday school sometimes and just sit in the bathroom stall close the door and just sit there the whole time and just being like just such a nervous wreck and you know it's amazing now the lord has me up in front of people ministering the gospel and you know it but the lord you know that he takes the the weak things of this world to to confound the strong and the the base things to confound you know the things that the world calls great so i'm thankful for that and you know so we went to church and you know uh by the grace of the lord you know from a young age uh you know i felt you know i believed in god as much as i could because i was raised up that way my you know you know parents no parents perfect no person is perfect but my parents i believe did the best they could and you know we went to church and you know tried to serve the lord the best we could and uh you know from there i didn't know at the time you know when you're that young you know there's you know the age differences seem a lot greater at the time when you're really young so i didn't really know maybe brother jesse or brother cam and simon as well because they would have been well ahead in sunday school classes maybe in a different sunday school or something like that but we came to know each other much better later on but uh you know and i remember during that period they moved over to the new church that they had built the assembly of god and i don't remember the date but i remember i was probably 13 14 years old when i really gave my heart to the lord i remember being in the service and i don't remember who was preaching i know it was a visiting minister i think they were having revival meetings and i just remember having that tug on my heart that i really wanted to serve the lord and i really what you know you become aware of of your sins you know you become aware of what you are and that you need a savior you know you that line of accountability where there becomes a revelation to you of wow i need a savior you know it's one thing when you're a child and everything's just ooh i just do whatever i want i'm a child and and then you you become to that realization like lord there is a heaven there is a hell there there is right and there is wrong and there is there is more you you start to maybe don't even have a full revelation of you come to grasp with your own mortality as it were where you start to realize this life that i have is going to end and what happens at the end of it and the lord by his grace gave me a desire i remember being in the service and just you know they they did the simple thing then it's like if you'd like to give your heart to the lord just raise your hand while you had your head bowed and i remember raising my hand and and i remember i remember something like even my dad grabbing my hand and probably knowing that i had raised my hand and probably being rejoicing in that and i remember giving my heart to the lord and you know you did the best you could when you're a child you know and you know i remember trying you know reading my bible and praying as much as i could and that i knew as much as i knew and you know for what the revelation i had and so as time went on you serve the lord you get to high school and you know you start to do things you're going through school and i was always the nerdy geeky one i always you know i called myself i was i was the king of the nerds as it were because my uh my my senior year in high school i was president of the band president of the show choir and president of the national honor society so i had the nerd trifecta going on you know and uh so and uh but you know it's something you know how the lord you the lord uh he's so sovereign in his ways and and uh you think you have your life planned out you know from a young even from being young i suppose and uh again i kind of it's kind of fortuitous i guess i would say or or i believe of the lord that i've been reading your book brother jesse because you in the beginning of the book you talked about how as christians we we take a real uh heart it we really take to heart real true romance and the real idea of the romantic like of the the husband and a wife in a real true relationship in that way because there's something in us that you don't even explain and you can't even know until the revelation comes but there's something in you that's yearning for that in the spiritual even in the natural and even as a young person i remember having that desire of i wanted to get married and have children and have an awesome family you know that that was my desire was i always said lord i want to find someone i wanted to get married young i wanted to have children young because my maybe part of it was because my parents did my parents were my parents got married in january of 1983 when they were 18 and 19 years old and i was born that december so they had me very very young you know and and i always thought to myself like lord i always wanted that for myself that was always my personal desire was lord i wanted to get married i want to have children young said lord i want to be really young so i could play sports with them or do whatever else would be young with them you know and and the lord you know had other plans for me so but i i you know going through that but that was always in my mind and i and when i became a christian you know i started to realize like lord if i'm going to get married i need to marry a christian woman you know i want to marry someone and you know you don't have maybe the revelation at the time without the holy ghost or really having a full revelation of the truth of this hour how deep that really needs to go you know you just think when i was young that young maybe just getting into high school and starting to think that way as those changes are coming on and you're thinking about like oh i'd like to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend if you get married you know you start oh i would just like to have someone that's you know kind of in the church that seems to be a christian and i would just say to all the young people out there that may be getting to that point it goes deeper than just seeing someone in church it goes deeper than even just someone that may come to church seemingly faithfully or whatever but you make sure that that person is baptized and filled with the holy ghost because because it goes beyond just someone that would come to church or profess a christian christian life but it's got to be someone that's that's in that body it's got to be someone that's been baptized with the same baptism that you've received and if you haven't received it you need to receive it you know so i would just encourage and we have so many little young ones here and and ones that are even coming to those ages is you know don't don't just think you know when i was young we didn't i didn't know i could say by the grace of god i didn't know any i truly didn't know any better because i i only knew as much as our denomination taught you know was i believed in salvation and i and to be honest uh you know brother jesse would i'm sure agreed to this you know test testimony that to us the holy ghost was nothing more than just something i mean you know we talk about third person in a trinity but the trinity is such an evil concept anyway that it truly takes away a revelation of what the holy ghost is that it is god himself dwelling in his people but you're not taught that in denomination they don't have a concept of that you're just you know to them it's just a power you know at the very least i could say praise the lord that we were at least in a pentecostal church that at least believed in a power of god and didn't believe in just a dead letter or something along that lines but they took it definitely the wrong way you know and and were going well it was just basically a power the holy ghost comes on you speak in tongues and maybe you could do some miracles and maybe get slain in the spirit or wherever it was but that was about as far as it really went as far as they would understand that so i i so my understanding was lord i just i wanted a christian wife and you know and uh you know we'd go to the we'd go to the youth conventions and all the different things that you go to and oh my brothers and sisters looking back on it now i say lord thank you for your grace and mercy because oh my it's they you know brothers and sisters those of you that uh that maybe have been in the denominational ranks or if you've been blessed to not have seen that oh my it's nothing but idolatry it's nothing but frivolous and uh and uh and it's really and if i could almost use a term if i could say it this way it's almost it's spiritual debauchery because it's it because they're they're drunk but they're not even drunk with with the wine or the the the stimulation of revelation but they're just they're it's uh it's it's a looking back on it now i was even thinking as i was kind of getting ready to come to service and i started thinking back to a specific youth convention that i went to and i remember brother jesse you remember at the end of the youth conventions they would always do like a big concert at the end of the convention i remember this year i don't remember who it was i think it was like skillet or something like one of those one of those silly things and i remember being up there and seeing the people down because we were where we were sitting at was kind of like in the higher there's a huge stadium and i remember sitting up there and looking down below and they people were doing like weird dances and and it was just so strange and i even i remember seeing something along that like that lines later and it was just nothing but like a spirituality like kind of a rave what they would call a rave where they do drugs and get in there and do all kinds of crazy things and they were doing those things and you start to see my lord it's nothing but a brother it's nothing but a feast of baal poor there's nothing you start to see what it is i say oh my lord have mercy thank you lord for sparing me and for allowing me you know not to get too deep into those things and and uh and you know i remember at that time going through this and saying lord i really you know i had so many plans made for my own life you know growing up from a young child i wanted to be a fighter pilot that was my life's goal you know i had a i had a very short period of time in my life maybe when i was like 12 13 years old where i thought i want to be an architect and then i came back to my senses and said that's just really boring and i want to i still want to be a fighter pilot you know that and i but that was always my dream i think you know i always wanted to be in a i always wanted to be in a fighter jet blasting 2000 miles an hour and turning nine g's and and up there flying and soaring and and i did everything in my power once i started learning i you know i started i started being physically active i started i started doing uh 200 push-ups a day 200 sit-ups a day and running two and a half three miles a day because i was like i need to pass this physical fitness test to get into the air force academy and learn all these things i needed to be good in school and by the grace of the lord i've always been good at that i was really i didn't enjoy school but the lord let me be good at it so i i didn't you know by his grace i was able to do that and and i had this thing in my mind of lord i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna get married i'm gonna be a fighter pilot and then when i get done with that i'm gonna get out of being in the military if i've been in the military for 20 years i'm going to i'm going to get out of the military and i'm going to fly passenger jets and make a bunch of money that was always that was i had a plan i had it laid out for me in my mind of what i was going to do because i that's just the way i was i you know and and brother brain and my you know brother branham i believe even told her sister they said you always cross bridges before you get to him and that's how we do sometimes is we always have it all set up but i praise the lord for his disrupting power because he has a way of he has a way of disrupting your life you know i think i think about think about the apostle paul and how paul no doubt had his life already mapped out for himself he was going to be a great man amongst the pharisees he had already risen through the ranks he had done all these taught under gamalia and and was raising through the ranks and was well respected and had all these i am gonna i'm gonna be zealous for my god for jehovah i'm gonna be zealous for jehovah within the ranks of the pharisees and even pulling them to prison he said hauling the saints off to prison with letters from damascus to haul him off the prison i mean he had a plan but praise god for the holy ghost that pillar of fire came and struck him down and disrupted his life for the better and so and i can say each one of us have that testimony of how god came and disrupted your life you thought you had something planned out or you thought you had it all together and then here comes god like a like a bowling ball to just knock over everything down and you know what he does you know i started to come to a revelation and and forgive me brother jesse if maybe this doesn't sound quite as right as maybe you teach it but this is the way at least the lord showed it to me i always wondered at that scripture where it said they said i lay now in zion uh uh stumbling stone in a rock of a fence and said whoever falls in it will she shall be broken but on whomsoever shall fall shall be ground a powder and i always wondered at that scripture and the lord seemed to speak to me of of how that if we don't fall upon that rock you will fall upon that rock and you will be broken but god binds the brokenhearted he puts the pieces back together but but if you wait and that stone falls upon you that judgment is going to be that's going to be a rough one and so i find that when the lord comes through and causes you to fall upon that rock you become a broken individual you become broken but i praise the lord that he's allowed me he allowed me to fall upon that rock and that even though i was broken he bound me back up he's made me whole in him and so i had all these plans and and i don't i really don't want to go long because we went so long yesterday but i'm just i guess this is the way the lord's leading me to go so but i had all these plans in my life and i had a i even had a girl that i knew i was sure to marry and she was in the church you know i i you know she was the only only girl for the longest time i had asked to date and i was so scared that i did it by a letter i wrote a letter and i and and but she rejected me you know and and i was really really sad about that i was really depressed about that and at that at that time as well my parents had my parents had gotten divorced and uh you know i was i want to say i was a sophomore in high school for maybe a freshman i'm like i said dates i'm always i'm really rough with dates and specific timings but my parents my parents got divorced and at that time that that girl had rejected me and i went through i was really just down and depressed and i that summer i had gone and lived with my aunt and uncle and my dad as he had moved out and gone up there to live in michigan just for the summer and went through high school and different things and and i kind of poured myself into you know uh trying to get ready to go to the air force academy so i had started to do those ex physical things and exercise i started trying to get you know in my first cup my first year or so in high school i didn't really do anything because i was such a nervous person didn't really want to get involved in anything and then i was like i found out that in order to be go into the air force academy they want to see a record of of things that you've done in school like being involved in things so i started i went out for track even though i couldn't run and i i've run like they put me in the 100 meter dash and and i was running like 13 seconds because i'm just i'm bottom heavy and i'm not built to run i'm just it's not the way i was built and and but i did those things just because i knew i needed to do it i started trying to get involved and uh and it was really interesting because you see how the lord will allow things to come along and and you'll build them up in a certain way thinking that this has got to be it this has got to be it because my between my junior and senior year high school the girl that i was sure i was going to marry we actually uh saw each other again at sam and sam and rachel's wedding and she came along and she wrote a little letter to me and was like i'm sorry i rejected you you're actually a really great guy you want to date or whatever and i was like yeah i was so happy you know and and and so we went through that period and and kind of you know doing whatever it was and i was so awkward i didn't even know how to date so i had with the world called dating i was just like oh this is great i don't know what i'm doing and i was still so nervous and all these things and uh and you know i i just say this to glo to give glory to god you know me being such an awkward person and so nervous he spared me from a lot of things brothers sisters because if it wasn't for the fact that when it came to social engagements of any kind whether it be interpersonal or otherwise i was so nervous that you know in high school and things you know people do a lot of things you know especially in this age but even back then i guess now sister kristen would think like we've been out of high school almost like 20 years now right and my lord like 20 plus years and 20 plus years ago things were even so different back then the way we acted you know it may not have been righteous but it definitely didn't seem as insane as it is today and uh he just goes to show the the condition of the world right now but you know i was so nervous i couldn't even bring myself to hold her hand you know and the lord used that to spare me from a lot of things but uh you know i i you know i thought i had but i tell you what even though i that part made me really nervous i was so rejoicing in myself because i thought i had it all now i was like cool my dream girl was going to marry me for sure because you know i was already in my mind i was like we're already married we're having children she's gonna you're going to the you're going to go with me when i'm in the air force and this is i'm going to go be a fighter pilot and my dreams are coming to life you know i was so positive about it and then i remember uh right at the end of that school year uh everything just started to fall apart and this would have been in 2002 and uh she broke up with me and i was depressed i was so down and and and i was like well you know okay i guess this is what's i guess this is happening and i you know didn't take to the rejection well and i was so down and you know you're immature at that age anyway and and it's even compounded by the fact that i was so awkward and didn't know how to do social interactions and and uh and then and then on top of that i received a letter from the air force saying that they rejected me from the air force academy and uh and because my eyesight was bad and i had really terrible eyesight at the time i had i think it was like something like 2200 20 over 200 eyesight like from here from me to you brother amen i wouldn't be able to i could only i would i would know you because i know your shape but you would just be a big blob you know my eyesight was that bad and uh oh brothers and sisters i was so depressed i was so all my dreams just got shattered and uh yeah and uh so i i'm i'll now reverse a little bit so during that time in the interim time there i as i'm getting older into high school i start to know brother cam and brother simon a little bit better and brother jesse and jesse was always so involved in so many extracurriculars at the time that i didn't really maybe know him as well at the time and uh and brother cam and brother simon were a little bit older than me but we always got along so well and and and them two also kind of being a little bit older kind of really dealt with more of the youth in the in the church that we were going to and so we got to know each other really well and fellowshipped a lot and i was really blessed by that we kind of had our little group that we fellowshipped with there at the assembly of god church and i just thought i had it all together at the time you know and and uh we fellowshipped in all those things and tried to serve the lord best we could and uh you know i remember all of a sudden now at this time that sort of in 2001 brother simon stopped going to the church i didn't think anything of it because i was so busy you're so busy with your own life and i wasn't at the time as close with brother simon because the age difference was a little bit more he was quite a bit older and so i you know brother simon had stopped going to the church and i know i think and correct me if i'm wrong brother jesse but i think even before the met you come to the message you kind of left the assembly of god there so you had already kind of moved on and i didn't hadn't known brother jesse as well but i knew he had kind of moved on to another church i think it was in toledo or something if i remember right something along those lines and and then brother simon had kind of just kind of quietly just disappeared and i remember and i remember i'll always remember this because i remember uh this would have been in the summer so during this time now brother simon had already kind of left i didn't really think much of it didn't really ask anything about it and nobody really talked about it and uh and now i'm going through this situation where right before the end of the school year my girl of my dreams broke up with me and the air force rejected me from the air force academy and so i was like oh my all my dreams were gone i was just shattered and i had no plan i had no backup plan as far as you because i was like this is what's going to happen with my life and i had no idea what i was going to do so i just chose the first thing i could think of it was i was like well after high school you go to college so i'll go to bowling green state university because i knew a couple people a couple friends from high school that didn't go to my church but that was they were my closest friends outside of really the church there that i would uh was with and it was actually two brothers one was older than me by a grade and one was younger than me by a grade and we all got along really well and always hung out a lot and i was like well i'll just go to i'll go to college there because they gave me kind of a little mini scholarship like like a couple like 1500 or something and i was just so depressed i didn't care i really didn't i was just i'm going to go to college and i guess i'm just going to go all my dreams were shattered and i always remember right before like during the summer i was fellowshipping with brother cam you know we hang out all the time and brother simon hadn't been there anymore i'd see him every once in a while but i i just didn't think anything of it i remember being in brother cam's red f-150 that if you know over the cam you know at the time it was still looking pretty good it's not not so good anymore but it was looking pretty good at the time and i remember brother cam was dropping me off at my house and i remember asking him i said i said where is simon i just remember asking him that evening and i was like where where forever and he just looked at me says oh you know he uh yeah he's in some cult now and he believes he he believes in some creature about you know eve and the serpent and all these things and i didn't think anything of it i didn't know and i remember looking at him and i just remember kind of shrugging my shoulder said oh well i just said oh well i said i you know i hope like i hope things get better for him you know i i didn't know you know i didn't know i knew only what i knew you know and brother cam at the same time also knew only what he knew and uh and around and i know that was the time that brother jesse you know uh brother simon and brother jesse had come to the revealed word of this hour and the lord had begun revealing it and and so i went off i worked that summer at worthington industries worthington steel actually worked i got a summer job there and worked all summer and then i went off to college to bowling green which obviously wasn't that far away but i lived in the dorms there with uh with the older brother of the two friends that i had i lived with him because he had already been going there and uh oh my i was just i was in such a depressed state i just didn't i didn't care about uh school i didn't care about what i was doing because all my dreams were gone i was brokenhearted from that girl and and broken-hearted from my my dream of being a fighter pilot being shattered and i was just completely just wandering i was just aimless you know i went to the classes and uh and everything and i uh so i just you know wasn't really going to church either because i just kind of that we didn't have a church that i knew of right there and i just i just kind of stayed in the dorm played video games went to classes played some basketball when i'd go to the rec center and that was about it and i was i really and i say that because the lord has a way of breaking you and he has a way of getting you into position to receive what you need to receive he has a way of getting you to the spot where you can receive it and some of us it requires being more broken than others because of the natures that we have or the conditions that we are in but he knows how to do it and i give glory to god for all that i i just i have glory in my tribulations i'll glory in the things that i've gone through and i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ and the things that he's done you know even with all of my failures and i've failed so many times but i remember just being so down and depressed and sad and this would have been in uh september either late september early october of 2002 and i remember being in the dorm and i remember sitting there one night and just sitting there and and again you know i i give glory to the lord through all of this because you know many people in those situations might go out and party go out and drink and and just go out and do all kinds of things because they're they more social but i was so awkward and i knew enough about god to knew it was wrong that he kept me from those things even if i had wanted to do him i'd be so socially awkward i couldn't bring myself to go to a party yeah i never went to any amazingly and i and give glory to god all through high school i never went to a prom i never went to a homecoming because i just was too awkward and doing it and then the girlfriend that i had i was so ex i remember being so excited because i was going to go to my senior prom with the girl of my dreams and then she broke up with me a few weeks before that so the lord it just i give glory to god because it's all him and and uh but anyway and if you know and and i don't say that to condemn anybody because if you had done those things you know praise the lord for forgiveness and for his blood you know i just i say it for me because you know the lord made me in a way and you you start to realize the weaknesses of your flesh and i know in myself that in many ways i have an addictive personality that in my flesh i've have to struggle with because i've seen it and this is maybe jumping forward in time but i've seen it even in something as simple as food where i if there's something that i like i could eat it because there was a time brothers and sisters like just four or five years ago i was almost 300 pounds because i was just so addicted to food and i would just eat and eat and if any time i would get down if i would get sad or down that became my comfort blanket and i would go and eat i would go eat 25 30 worth of wendy's or mcdonald's at a time and just pound it down and and and i only say that to give glory to god because he helped me to lose weight and get healthier and and all those things and and but i i the lord will reveal to you you know maybe the thorn in your flesh are the weaknesses that you have because each one of us you think about the fourth 6 000 years of breeding that's gone in through the wickedness of the flesh that's gone in and all the traits that are handed down through generations that you have to struggle with that's in this flesh and lord knows by the holy ghost we can overcome this flesh but but the flesh is always with you and struggling against it so you have to know your enemy know your enemy you know many times we like to we like to just oh it's just nothing it's just nothing it's just that no know know the weaknesses that the that are in your life and the things that you have to fortify brother brandon even said that there's those that punch that the devil has that you need to fortify those positions and i know by the grace of god he spared me because i believe if he would have let me get into drugs or drinking or all these some of these different things i'd probably be dead already because i just know knowing the weakness of my flesh i would have been the person that probably would have killed himself by alcohol poisoning just because i like the taste of something i might have downed like five bottles of alcohol and died you know and i glory i say glory to god for sparing me from so much so much and and you know and that's why we give these testimonies because my testimony doesn't fit the circumstances for everybody and god i believe has pulled ones out of every single walk of life every circumstance because when we get there at the white throne because the saints shall judge the earth and when when someone would come up at the white throne and would say well i had this problem and i had that problem god will be able to point to brother jesse and say come here jesse smith and you'd be able to testify yes you had that problem but i can testify that the blood of jesus christ was able to overcome your problem so you don't have an excuse see and god will have ones that had every problem every circumstance every issue god will have one i believe that out of every one of those circumstances because there won't be one with an excuse because the blood of jesus christ is not slack to save so i i just give glory to the lord in those things and so anyway i was so down and sad and and things in college and i remember the one night and uh sitting there in the dorm and just thinking man you know i haven't i haven't talked to brother cam i haven't talked to can in a while i've been you know i've been in college for like a month a month and a half i hadn't talked to cam in a while because i just been in my own little shell just kind of really sad and and down i was like well i'll just give him a call you know i haven't talked to him in a while and and this was this was believe it or not this was before the age of cell phones being really widely available you know so i had we had the landline in the dorm i didn't have a cell phone at the time and uh and i think maybe brother cam cam had at the time maybe just the original flip phone you know and everything and and i remember i called him and i'll never forget the word i said hey cam how's it going man and he's like he's like dude you'll never believe i just got re-baptized in the name of jesus christ and and and the testimony on that that you it was all god because if you know anything and i don't know if brother cam's ever given his testimony or anything but uh just uh like a slight aside on that a very just a slight aside on that but brother cam you know when brother jesse and brother simon came to the knowledge of this word brother cam fought it he fought it solid for a year and and i mean like and when i mean fight i mean almost physically too in some points you know and it but that's how brothers are even in the natural brothers in the natural could get that way with each other you know i didn't have brothers but i have two sisters and i know even us would fight physically sometimes because that's just you that's your blood you know that's your kin yes they say so things are a little bit different sometimes you you don't hold back the punches physically even literally you know when you're with family but uh i you know he had fought it for a year and then when the lord brought that revelation and turned him around in an instant he had been going and trying to to go back all the people that he had chased away he had been going and trying to make it right and telling him hey this is the truth this is the truth this is the truth and that the the glor the grace of god for me that he had been trying to get in touch with me even though i didn't know much he had never said much to me about it because he had told me what i told you like oh he's just involved in this little thing and that was all he ever said but he had been trying to get a hold of me but he didn't have my phone number at the at the college and nobody knew it and he's and and he was trying to he had been trying to get in touch with me and god put it on my heart anointed me to call him at that season for that time and so i say glory to god he works on both ends he's able to bring those two together just when you you know you're not even looking and i wasn't looking for anything but so i you know he says this and i'm you know my interest is kind of pizza i'm like what do you mean i didn't you know i was like well he's like he's like brother he's like everything that simon was talking about that is the truth it is the word of god it is the truth and everything i was like oh okay and and uh you know the lord had been moving you know during this period of about i'd say two solid years two and a half solid years really beginning with uh and really even be on that maybe say three solid years beginning with brother craig booer and and different ones from there that kind of that chain reaction of how it extended out and over to brother simon and brother jesse and then to brother cam and and then to me and and whatnot and so he says yeah me and in this guy i didn't know him uh scott overmeyer are gonna be we're coming down because uh betsy brother jesse's sister was also going to bowling green as uh at the time and she was across on the other side of campus and um and he's like he's like we're coming down and we're going to give a bible study to betsy if you want to come you can and i was like all right i'll be there and so i we went i went there showed up walked in there and we were in uh in betsy's dorm room and and uh cam and and brother cam and scott were there and they didn't know anything they didn't know anything they gave they gave a bible study on on the baptism in the name of jesus christ and the serpent see and i think they used a total between the two of them like four or five scriptures it was like just a couple scriptures for each one but i tell you what brothers and sisters when the word when that light strikes the seed you can't you cannot help it it when it's the season for that seed to spring to life all the devil's in hell it doesn't matter you see you think your testimony doesn't mean anything because you think you can't say it in the right way or you you don't have all the intellectual knowledge you just share christ with them you just share the truth with them and if they're ordained to life and all the devils in hell that will pierce through all the all the layers of muck and grime just like that lily that's buried underneath the that underneath all the water underneath all the muck and grime but that light can penetrate down to that seed and make it grow because i tell you what they share just a few scriptures because they didn't they know nothing brother cam had just been baptized like right before or maybe he he had just been baptized right before that maybe a couple days before he didn't have time to know anything but he was given what he had and he that that spirit that was on him to testify of it and and and when that hit me i couldn't help but say my it's like my eyes were opened it's like wow this is this is true baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ something as simple as that to see what you've never seen before the lord could just open your eyes the scales fall off your eyes as it were praise the lord and so i went from there rejoicing and i went and and uh you know over the we went to uh i think that was sometime during the week and then we went to a bible study uh that they were having up there in florida ohio that uh brother craig booer was doing at the time and they would do the bibles what they would do is do the bible studies on the on the fri on the saturdays and then they would go down to lima on sundays for the church services and so i went up there and uh you know just had reason having these things in my mind and i'll be honest you know even though i've been in the church for years and years i really didn't know much you know i i didn't know much and i think you'd probably testify to that too i mean you could be in the church for years and years they don't i hate to you know it sounds like you're just maybe making fun or poking at something but the truth of the matter is brothers and sisters those denominations they can't teach you anything because they have nothing to give there's no life to partake of of there because it's dead it is complete god has left those moves you know and and god can work through that to an extent but in order to receive everything that he has we've got to come up higher you know and and so even for all those years you know i knew certain things here and there but i didn't really know anything and and i to to the to the fact of the matter is i had never even been baptized in the church at assembly of god i was never baptized in the name of father son holy ghost and uh and and so i remember i go to the to the bible study there and i remember sitting there before the before the bible study just sitting in there kind of reading my bible and uh i i don't have a lot of what you call supernatural experiences in the in like what we like that per that manifest in the natural but i remember sitting in there and uh just sitting there reading my bible kind of bent over you know on a chair how you'd be kind of bent over reading your bible and i remember a voice in my right ear so real that i felt the air on my ear whisper my name and literally just said randy just like that like audible i felt air on my ear and i remember i turned i heard that and i turned around and you know uh brother brooks's son jojo when he would have been really young there at the time he was sitting there was nobody behind me number one nobody there really knew me number two there was nobody behind me and i looked i remember turning around and looking and seeing jojo brother joseph one of brother isaiah brooks's young children he was really young he looked at me like what are you looking at you know and i remember what is this you know and uh i really believe that was just the lord calling me even audibly calling me and confirming and uh and and so we went through the uh had the service i don't even remember the service in particularly but i remember just being convinced after the service just like lord you know after that experiences like lord i gotta get baptized i gotta do this you know and i'm because i remember hearing if you know you're baptized you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and i was like lord that's what i want i want to make a rapture you know i started hearing these things about how do you make a rapture you have to receive the holy ghost you know how do you receive the holy ghost repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gifts of the holy and i remember just thinking lord okay this is what i got to do and uh and so i was like lord i'm gonna get baptized after the service there and and and after the service you know and you know as soon as you start to make these decisions the devil's right there to resist he is right there to resist you at every turn and i think about brother mj i heard i heard how you had a flat tire on the way here was it was it was it you had a flat tire or somebody or someone yeah and you see you know you see how the devil as soon as you start to make a move for god how how when you start to make a move towards truth that devil is going to resist you and you know there's going to be people that are going to sit there and say oh it's the other way god's trying to keep you from something i tell you what you you continue with the lord and you'll see what god will do because he'll vindicate it he will vindicate it to be the truth he'll vindicate it in this word he will show you truth he'll show you truth on the inward parts i tell you what he will show you he will expose the devil and i remember that's when the trials really started to begin the mental battles because right after that service you know and again i don't say any of these things to to lay anything on someone or make make someone out to be a bad person or or any of those things because i believe there's grace for all but everybody has their part to play in their times and seasons but i remember you know looking back on it now the whole time i had been at the college there i had never been reached out to by anybody from the church i had never been reached out to anybody but i remember as soon as i went to that service right after the service i received a call from our pastor's wife and she came in when she was telling me this is a this is a bad thing don't get baptized that way don't do this this is a this is a this is a cult that you're getting involved in this is a thing this isn't of god and all these things and i remember and i remember thinking by the grace of god and i did and i tell you i tell you the grace of god to to a to a believer to a son or daughter a god because i didn't know even though i'd been in the church i really didn't have a true knowledge because you can't have a true knowledge of god without the holy ghost because you can't to because when the scripture says he says depart from ye that work iniquity i never knew you when you understand that knowing it goes beyond it's not a carnal knowing it's not an intellectual knowing but it's a knowledge as of between a husband and a wife it's a knowledge of nature it's a knowledge of the true nature of god and you cannot know the nature of god without receiving the nature of god because what is the who knows the mind of god except the mind of god the spirit of god you cannot know those things and i say it had to be the grace of god because i even look back on it now to even have the insight to think this thought that god gave me that it had to be the holy ghost leading me because i wouldn't have known but i remember hanging up from that phone call and thinking if if people are fighting it this much then it has to be the truth and and and don't get me wrong i fought my battles i fought a lot of mind battles even after that and i fought and fought and fought and struggled because you wrestle with your salvation and you wrestle with those things and i thought and i remember and i remember hanging up that phone after she did that and i said i said i got to get baptized because the lord dropped that in my heart and said you know how how if they're fighting it this hard and but they're going they they're you know i'm they're trying to push me deeper into the word but it's being fought this hard it's got to be true you know and i and i so by the grace of god uh again time frames i don't know but within the next day or so uh we went and i was baptized in that little river that was over by florida ohio by brother isaiah and uh and baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and and and from there you know you start to fight battles you know the battle doesn't begin until you really start to try to serve the lord according to the truth and fought a lot of battles mentally i'm you know uh at college there and was still really even then fighting with depression and uh you pray for me because that's uh that's the thing that i've had to fight i've had to fight that you know and i know i'm in good company because i know even elijah fought that i know even even jonah fought that you know after after he preached great sermons and all of nineveh had repented even so much that they said they put sackcloth on the animals and there goes there goes jonah even afterwards so depressed he said lord just let me die so i said lord i'm in good company but you just pray for me because it's something you know i've had to fight all my life really and uh you know i i don't mind you know i i people may say oh you're showing weakness and things but you know what i don't even i have why do i why should i have pride you know why why should i have i have nothing to have pride in the same blood that saves me is the same blood that saved you it's the same christ that died for you as the same one that died for me and you know i want i want all my sins to go before me when i come to the jordan if i tarry that long i believe by the grace of god he's giving me a revelation i'm destined for a rapture i'm destined for a body change but if i were if i were to go before that time and pass i want my sins to go before me i have no problem saying you pray for me on certain things that i maybe struggle with or something i i want to be open and transparent before you you know it's and there's a fine line to be there because we don't we don't just go delve into the things oh this is what i and try to go into detail we don't give glory to the devil that way you know there's a very fine line we confess our faults i don't want to confess my sins to you those are for god but i'll confess my faults to you and you pray for me i'll pray for you and you know if we could have true divine holy ghost love in our hearts we could truly confess our faults and have love enough one for another not to condemn a brother or sister but to pray really pray one for another so i believe i believe in that and i know brother jesse believes in that because we're here to be honest and sincere you know praise the lord for his deliverance that he's given me from depression and from from fighting with the addictions to food and different things i've had to fight with i give glory to god in that because that's a testimony that someone else might hear and take heart and say if he could do it for him he could do it for me you know and i'm not perfect you know as paul had said in the he said i don't say these things as though i've already attained he said but this one thing i do that i press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus so you pray for me i'll pray for you so you know we i you know and i struggled you know i served the lord we we came in you know go started going to brother isaiah brooks's church and and even i remember having fellowship with brother jesse there coming over to akron and fellowshipping and things at that time and just you know the lord you didn't see what you had until hindsight goes by and you see the move that god did you know when you're in when you're in it when you're swept up in it you know sister wendy coming along in those times and different ones coming along and you know you thank the lord for his mercy and grace and keeping us from so much and so much of the different you know even we learn different politics and different things that goes on and he spared us from so much and allowed us just to grow sheltered he truly you know i believe the devil probably almost looked at all of us probably like jobs and said how can i do anything with him because he got a hedge of protection around him you know and he truly had a hedge about us you know and you know we have our struggles and our battles and you look back and see how immature and foolish you were in certain things but that's what maturing's all about it's because becoming above those things and overcoming so um you know but i i don't want to keep us too much longer but i just want to go through and and maybe just even since i came to the knowledge of this truth you know just to just to show you know just because you come to the knowledge of it doesn't mean that you're not going to go through struggles and trials doesn't mean that you might not even backslide because i backslid you know i served the lord there uh you know by the grace of god as best i could you know and the lord really blessed and we were rejoicing in the holy ghost and and the knowledge of the truth and serving him as best as we could and you know in uh in the year in 2007 was a time uh you know the lord had called brother isaiah to to go to des moines iowa to leave the church there in lima and go to des moines and uh during that time too in the in the year prior to that i had been uh starting to kind of uh court a sister from the church here actually at brother jesse's and uh and i think deep down i really believe deep down i knew that it wasn't supposed to be that way because i had been struggling with other certain things about it and even looking back on it now may not have been the things that i i needed to struggle with but uh you know i had my own ideas on certain things and i had my own thoughts and and things and and you know when you're a child you know paul said i speak as a child i thought as a child i acted as a child you know and and we even spoke on this a little bit yesterday but what's one of those things as a child sometimes when the lord says no you throw a little bit of a fit and uh you know i been the sis this uh sister at the time i've been talking to the lord had kinda it's like no i i don't think it's it's the thing to do and and then i kind of started to fight that depression thing again and and uh i did feel like the lord had called me at the time when brother isaiah had moved over to des moines i kind of felt a pull like i was supposed to go help him because he didn't really have anybody out there to help and i prayed about it and at that time too i just kind of felt like i needed a change in my life and you know i don't know looking back i don't know if that was necessarily god or not i i can be perfectly honest and say i don't know what was in that i felt you know i felt you know i've been trying to find work in different jobs i'd worked all kinds of different jobs and at the time i was working uh iron working i was an iron worker and a lot of the brothers now are still iron workers you know brother dave and brother bart over at brother cam's church they're still iron workers you know and i had gotten in i was one of the first ones to get into that you know at the time and and been working that job and my body was breaking down really fast i had carpal tunnel in both my hands i was miserable at the job i enjoyed the work itself but it made me physically miserable because i would wake up and my hands would be clenched shut they were so tight and i couldn't like i would sleep and my arms would go numb all the time and and i was just i was such in a place i was like lord what am i supposed to do i i i'm trying to find a job and i don't know where to go or what to do and uh and then brother brother isaiah brother brooks is getting ready to leave and i'm like lord what do i do i just don't know and and then i was like well maybe it's time to move on to something else and maybe you should go over and like move out to iowa with brother brother brooks and help out there and do something new and and uh and then i had this other poll from my dad because at the time my parents were divorced and my dad had moved out to denver colorado and he kind of put a pull on me too he said if you want you can come live with me you don't have to pay for nothing you don't need anything you know i have everything for you you know and he didn't believe the the truth that we believe you know i had witnessed to him a little bit and i remember witnessing to him and by his by god's grace he was able to recognize enough that he recognized the baptism uh because i remember specifically you know uh and you know lord i say lord forgive me for having this attitude but you know my family was always loud and boisterous and my parents would get into arguments and things and and uh uh you know my mom she's she's passed on now she passed away in 2012 but my uh i remember having an argument with them like and it was just it was a legitimate argument it wasn't it wasn't and i'd say that at all you know just confession it was an argument over the word of god and my my mom was saying this isn't right and this and that because at the time i had left college and uh and had gone back and lived with them and was working and just trying to find my way and all these different things and as far as the natural trying to find my way with work and things and had lived with them and and i remember just saying and kind of getting into it and like no this is the truth and all these things and and i remember i had kind of witnessed some of the things in the word as much as they would listen to my parents and the baptism in the name of jesus christ and i remember having that discussion and said i said and you can't say anything about this baptism because it's right in the word i remember looking at my dad and saying that right and he's like he's like yeah he's like i can't say anything against it you know and and so i pray you pray for him you know i believe i believe he'll he'll come around and you know he's actually been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i just you know maybe sometimes i think maybe he hasn't fully repented of some things because i don't he doesn't have a revelation of sanctification and and certain things of that but you know i believe it you know the lord gave him enough grace to see that so that's one thing i say praise the lord for and um but anyway you know all those things and he had pulled on me and and even knowing i knew you know you know deep down in your heart what maybe is right and wrong but i had been trying to find a job in des moines to maybe i would could go over there and live and help and it didn't seem like it was going that way and so looking back at it now i chose the easy path which wasn't the right one you know and i went to where my dad was thinking that i would be able to just i would be able to overcome everything because uh you know i'm a christian and i have this truth in the holy ghost and you know thinking more of myself than maybe i ought to have at the time and not realizing that i was going to be fighting so many things and i went there and i i just be honest with you brothers and sisters i just backslid you know i i was just i just you know for a while i went to a church that was out there and uh and ministered the word with them and and the brothers were really sweet and sincere and uh and then just got to a place because of the situation that i'd had with that sister that i had been courting uh just it just that depression spirit really got me and i and i know it put me into a place of uh just real depression i stopped going to the church and and i was just i really i didn't enjoy the job i was working i was working at target it was the only job i could find i was try i tried to go back to college when i was out there with my dad living with my dad and i couldn't get into that i quit after half a semester again and um just it wasn't my heart wasn't in it and i'd go into the church and brother uriah you know brother uriah he was actually going to that church at the time and he was out there and but i was just such an in a place you know where i was just down i was really down i was in a dark place uh mentally and just really just really couldn't dig myself out of it so much so that even my dad confessed to me afterwards he said he used to just look at my look at me and he'd just say he just look at me and think like i don't know what i can do to help him because he said he could see i was just so down and no matter what he would do he couldn't get me out of it even in his way that he would and and and you know i just didn't talk to anybody for probably the space of two years at least two years i didn't talk to anybody like brother cam or simon or any of these ones i was just i was ashamed of myself i was depressed you know and even and then i give glory to god because i was even testifying in the back right before service to brother jesse there were many times i wanted to get on those dating sites and find a woman and just run off with her and do whatever and the lord made me so awkward i just couldn't do it he i couldn't do it it because and also i knew too much you know i knew too much i knew the truth of the word and and that this word was truth and the message of the hour the truth of it you know what once it's been if it's truly been revealed and if you've truly received it and you've truly been sealed away you can't get away from it it doesn't matter that's why i read the scripture in the beginning he drew with bands of love you can't once you've been latched brothers and sisters by this word once you've been once he's once he's gotten his hands on you and you've truly given it to him in your heart yes you know i believe brother brahm said a man could be totally insane yet filled with the holy ghost because it because that heart you know and that's why you know no matter what situations a person and you believe for that person because i've been there in a place where i could tell you i was i was totally insane because because i tell you i sat there and it's just confession because i i'm not ashamed of it because it was what god delivered me from brother i used to sit there and play video games for 12 to 16 hours a day on my computer and just waste away my life waste away and i would be angry and upset and just depressed and i knew it was wrong but i just i at that point i had given up on myself i said lord i just i i don't care i just i'm so miserable i don't want anything to do with this i just lord i'd just rather you kill me i'd cry and ask the lord to kill me because i knew i couldn't do it myself i knew too much i knew too much to kill myself you know and and i hope this is all right brother jesse i'm just trying to be transparent you know and because i trust if someone's out there and if you listen to this little video or something god is still there for you god is able to reach down and we sing that song when he reached out his hand for me i was in the deepest depths of despair i knew the truth of this word you know i i knew that it was true and yet i'd found that i was just you know because maybe throwing my own childish fit you know didn't want to maybe submit fully to the lord in certain things here and there you know and and so uh i went through that for a couple years and i hadn't talked to anybody and just to show you how sovereign god will be when he comes and when when when he can turn a life around and how he can do it in an instant i remember i was sitting in the apartment that we lived in and the lord had started to work on me you know and he had been starting to work on me again and just started i started when he starts to do that he just starts bringing things to remember it's little by little you know it's just like remembering the former times you know i think of it almost in a way of like a samson you know and brother branham talked about how you'd be grinding in that mill that's kind of where i was i was just grinding in the mill you know and you start to reminisce on man i remember how the lord used to do this i remember how the lord you know used to do that and and and but he i t he can do it again he can do it again praise the lord and uh i remember just sitting there and i was too ashamed to talk to anybody because i was just uh i was i knew you know where i was and and and i was just ashamed of myself you know and but i remember getting on facebook i made a fake account just a fake no-name account so i could find people and kind of spy on them because i didn't want to talk to him but i just i i desired the fellowship but i was so ashamed i couldn't reach out you know the devil how he works how he was he the devil he's you look back and you're like lord i have mercy that's so silly but but you know that's how the devil works it's just the reality of the situation and i remember being being on there and and brother simon has a facebook thing and i know you know i i don't like facebook i don't like any of those things really but if the lord leads you to do it and you can do it righteously i believe it can be a tool because god uses it as a tool for me definitely 99.9 evil so if the lord better be sure you better be filled with the holy ghost and know what what's going on because there ain't nothing but wickedness on there anyway it's all evil but i remember getting on there and looking on brother simon's little thing and brother simon didn't even post very much but every once in a blue moon they'd say and i remember seeing a post they had just had a revival meeting at the church and he had made a little post that said just something as simple as like powerful meetings this weekend i just like never seen the spirit of the lord move like this or something along that lines i don't remember what it was and it's just like the lord flipped the switch and i remember the very thought that that the lord dropped in my heart was i started thinking about my life and what i was just wasting it and the lord just spoke that you're going to miss a rapture for this and right at that moment the repentance was done and i just remember just just crying out to the lord and saying oh god forgive me you know i just lord like that's he turned it around that is repentance turning it around and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye i could say he turned me around and i remember just that thought you're gonna miss a rapture for this filth for this for this this stuff that you know is wrong that you just that because because you think god's not powerful enough to overcome it and because you're ashamed you're so prideful you know shame is pride people don't realize that but shame actually comes from pride because shame is a thing when you're too prideful to admit that you're wrong but you know you're wrong but and you're not willing to admit it openly and that's why i don't want to be ashamed i don't want to be ashamed of that and so i said lord forgive me and i and and in that moment he restored he restored in a moment and and i say praise be to god for that and i remember reaching out and reaching out to brother simon in different ones and just apologizing and repenting say i'm so sorry i ignored you for this period of time and and went back to that you know and then the sovereign grace of god you know to to show how how he works and how how he does things you know i i went back you know and uh in my heart i had i felt lord i felt a pull to go to iowa to help brother brooks because that was the original poll i felt and it's you know uh you always say he he he's always right where you left him you'll find him right where you left him and i remember coming back to that point and being like lord i chose the wrong path i chose the easy one i chose the one that i thought was going to be easy because it was more certain i knew going with my dad i wasn't going to have to worry about financial things or living and all these things but going out to iowa i didn't have a job i didn't necessarily have a place to be here anything like that it was more uncertain and i remember coming back to that place and said lord i'm gonna go back to this brother the church that was there in denver and i say lord i'm gonna go and i'm gonna stay there as long as you would have me and then lord but i believe you called me to iowa but i don't know when you're going to do it but i'm going to try to be faithful to help this brother out because i'd left them it was a really small church smaller than this even maybe like 10 12 people and i remember going back to the brother and and just apologized and said brother forgive me you know for just abandoning you and because i didn't talk to him i just kind of disappeared you know and uh and he's just you know he's a he's a sweet brother he's like oh that's all right brother that all is well and and and he uh but he was closed up the church he was actually leaving that weekend to go back to north carolina where he came from just to show you the sovereign the grace of god and how he he even lined it up just right so i was like lord okay i know that you've called me to go back to iowa and so i started going to this other church that was there in denver and and i don't want to really get too much into that but the details of that but i'll tell you this i knew there was something wrong with the church even though they confessed this message there was something in my spirit that knew there was something kind of wrong and uh but i couldn't put my finger on it because i didn't know a lot about the different things at the time and uh to show you how god is gracious you know i i had a job and it's almost as if the lord put me in a spot to give me a test again because it's almost like the lord you know like a school master you know because the holy ghost is your tutor and it's almost like the holy ghost came right back and said okay i gave you this test before and you chose the easy path now let's let's see can you pass the test again because i was living with my dad and and during this time as the lord was bringing me through he gave me the best job i ever had i had this job working for a company uh that i was doing mechanical work for this company and and doing things the lord had blessed me in this job gave me favor with the people there was moving me up in the job they are as a mechanic they had bought me a toolbox with all these tools spent a lot of money to buy me tools to learn how to do the job i've basically been an apprentice to some of the older guys and i remember i said lord i'm gonna i'm gonna go as long as you tell me to and when you tell me to leave i'm gonna leave and it came to a point where all those things that i couldn't put my finger on at that church the lord kind of exposed it in one service and i kind of found out they were kind of a perugia what we call perugia ministry in in certain things and i still don't even know all the details of it i just know what it was and the lord kind of expounded on that to me and really made it plain like yeah this is it and he revealed it and i said lord it's time to go and at the time i'd had a dream and and the lord kind of used it whether you know and i know the lord works in dreams and things and i remember having a dream of uh this dream and i you know brother brother stanley barnes and the lord kind of uses him sometimes and i guess like lord will show him maybe meanings of certain things like that that's what i had been told at least from brother isaiah brooke so i i felt led to tell him my dream and say maybe if the lord shows you something you can help me if the lord shows something to you and just the sovereignty of god of how he things worked he the the lord these things happen this service happened and things came to light and i was like lord have mercy my eyes were opened to what was going on i said lord i think maybe it's time for me to leave that very same after that service brother barnes brother stanley barnes called me back and he had no idea about any of this i just told him a dream that i had that seemed to have some kind of significance because there was a couple dreams that i had in this period of time after the lord restored me that that actually some things have come to pass and i believe some things are yet to come to pass and so much that i share a little piece of one with you um i had a dream that had to do with the cam but the cam's church and in the dream the church physically flipped and it was in a time that they actually were physically flipping the church to go from where they're at now when they faced one way to completely facing the other way and the lord was showing me certain things and after that service brother stanley barnes calls me back and just starts talking and he gets to a point where he's kind of talking about the dream and different things and and in part of the dream i'll just share it with you i feel like to share this little piece of it with you and it wasn't anything particular thing but i was in a dream where i was in a house and there was a bunch of women in the house all dressed in white brides all women that were dressed in white and and some things that happened there and and uh brother brother barnes had told me he said brother and i remember the way he said it too he said brother he said you'll come to a place to realize that not everybody that says they believed this message really believed this message and i and i was just lord and that was the lord right to the heart of the matter without him knowing i said brother you don't even know what just happened to me and that was a confirmation to me of lord it's time to move and the lord put me in that test with that job again because brothers and sisters i tell you i was nervous because this was the best job i ever had these people treated me so well but i remember i had told the lord i said lord if you if you will show me if this is the time i said lord i will put in my two weeks notice because that was on a sunday obviously for service i said i will put in my two weeks notice tomorrow and i will leave and he showed me and i and i went to work the next day and i took my boss aside i said i said look i appreciate everything you've ever done i said but the lord's calling me to leave and i gotta go and i said so i gotta put in my two weeks notice for you and i'm just thinking they're gonna be upset they'd invested all this money into me and he looked at me he said he said you know what he said you got to do what god tells you to do and i and and he he left he said he said and you know what he said you have my phone number he said if for some reason it doesn't work out he said you call me and he said and you'll have a job he said i said oh man it just humbled me so much of how the lord would just he just the lord is faithful to his children and so you know i you know i i'm grateful i don't know what time it is brother i don't want to keep us too long it's getting late um but he's faithful he's faithful you know and and and i'm going to share this other part of this testimony and i and i pray you take it in the way that it's meant well before i even get to that i find out later that even the how the lord will blind you to certain things for a season just to show you down the road how he how he kept you and had his hand on you because before i had even left lima sister karen sanders who many of you know had actually prophesied over me that i had totally forgotten but the lord through her had already said before this was back in 2007 before i even left that i was going to go through a dark valley in my life but that the lord would have his hand upon me and bring me out the other side and i had forgotten it and it wasn't until i'd come out on the other side that the lord had had brought that back to remembrance of different brothers and and sister karen and and different ones and to me and and i just give glory to god because he had a purpose in it you know to bring me to a deeper relationship with him to a deeper understanding and a deeper love because i love the lord more than i ever have you know more than i ever could have loved him you know and yes do i wish that maybe i made the right decision the first time absolutely i don't joy in making the wrong decisions but i glory in the fact that he's able to turn even the permissive will of god to his perfect will and to show it and to use it and and he i love the lord for that because just even when the devil thinks he's got everything wrapped up god can take the most wicked thing and turn it around for your good and god gets joy god gets joy in that he gets glory in that because even now in satan's eden god's able to take these living stones each one of you and to prove the devil wrong right in his playground and so i give glory to god for that and um and i i just thank him for that and and and what he's done for me and and i just want to back up because this one part of the the scripture that or a scripture i guess my testimony is kind of is part of scripture because we're all part of the word right but a part of my testimony that also encouraged me this is and forget lord forgive me for not telling in the right order but going back to leaving denver and going back to iowa the thing that really started it was i had listened been listening to a message sirs is this the sign of the end that brother branham preached and in that in that message brother branham talks about moving because he's getting ready to move to arizona and he says in that message he says i don't know where i'm going i don't know what i'm doing he says all i know is i feel like i'm like abraham just trying to follow the will of the lord and follow him wherever he would lead and i remember at this time of changing when the lord had restored me i was feeling that way and i remember reading that or hearing that and having that same feeling like lord i feel like abraham like you're calling me to leave i have no idea what i'm going to do or what i'm going to go and and the vindication came because then i had gone i had heard that and then i had gone on to the voice of god website where they have where they'll put up quotes and things sometimes and i remember going through their archives of different little things that they had and just randomly clicking on some different ones and when i clicked on the one to show the quote it was that exact same quote from that exact same message that confirmed it to me and that's where i that's where i kind of felt that's where i made that promise to the lord i said lord then i will give my two weeks notice to that to the work and everything and uh so i i did that and then the lord comes and confirms it by revealing that church what was going on there and then coming back with the dream and he just confirmation on confirmation to really embolden me and give really gave me grace to do that and so uh now i know there's a lot i don't want to wear you out i trust i'm not wearing any out but i want to go a little farther with this just to give glory to god for what he did and and this this the reason i say this next part is because i don't want anybody to think any ill of anybody or anything because i'm going to say something that some the devil could try to use certain things but i know it was god and because it was for me i know it was for me and the lord told me it was for me uh and so i decided okay lord i'm packing up everything i have and i'm moving to iowa i had no job i had a thousand dollars in the bank account maybe i had a little jeep liberty that i packed literally everything i owned into including my mattress so much so that when i was driving i had to drive like this because my mattress was over my head and the only thing i couldn't take with me was my dresser because it was just too big and my frame for my bed but i had everything else and i drove out there and i remember telling brother isaiah brooks i said brother so the lord told me to come out there and i remember the lord the lord told him that he said i said brother do you have a place for me to stay or anything i could stay and the lord told him that to that i wasn't to stay with him and i remember thinking my you know thing okay and i i didn't know you know and and lord forgive me i could have probably maybe asked someone else or found something else but i just remember feeling like oh lord okay but i knew here's the thing though but the devil couldn't take away from me even trying to use that you know the devil would try to use that and say oh you're not meant to go but i knew what the lord had told me so i said lord i i that that's not about that it's about me fulfilling the word of god no matter what it is on the other side and so i slept in a walmart parking lot for like a week you know and uh three it might have been less than a week but it was close to a week and it was in the summer too so it wasn't it wasn't cold it wasn't it wasn't comfortable um but brother brooks allowed me to keep my stuff at his house i would put in the garage and i slept in my jeep and and right when i got there it was around uh fourth of july it's and it's really amazing to me how the lord has used the fourth of july in my life a lot that period of time because i've experienced that actually even more recently in my life the fourth of july but uh the fourth of july they had some meetings at a church up there in minnesota and i heard about it so i went up there with them and had a wonderful time in the lord and and uh was i drove i'd ridden up there with brother brother brooks and and uh on the way back i guess the lord had laid it on someone's heart they'd heard about what the lord had done for me and how they called me to go out there and and they gave me like a thousand dollars or fifteen hundred dollars that led on their heart and i just remember weeping and just crying and said lord like he's just so merciful to me and i don't deserve any of it you know i'm the i'm the least among anybody you know and uh i just i rejoice so grateful to that and then the lord soon after the lord put on brother brooks's heart at the time they were staying in uh the church they they had was in a little office building that had a little out room a little extra office room and brother brooks allowed me to stay in there so i stayed in there for a couple weeks while i found a job and the lord allowed me to do that and but the reason i say that part and the reason i bring that was because the lord used sister karen again and the lord because i expressed it i remember talking on the phone with sister karen and uh and the lord spoke to her and and she spoke it back to me and said the lord had told her this and and i found it to be the truth because how the lord used it in my life and said that the lord allowed that to prove to me that it was he that had called me out there and that it wasn't any man that was doing the work you know that it wasn't any man that had drawn me out there or or you know to establish me in that place to show that it wasn't it wasn't because of the kindness of a man that they had prosecuted me to pull me over there or wasn't anything but god had done the work and that regardless of what it was the lord had stuck me through that and so i just rejoice in the lord for his grace you know and then so uh you know he gave me he gave me a job working at a landscape supply company and i wasn't making hardly any i was making decent i was making like 11.50 an hour which is pretty good for me i was feeling pretty good about that and i the lord gave me an apartment that i could walk to work so i didn't have to you know to deal with car stuff as much and and uh the lord just really blessed me blessed me in that way allowed me to pay off some debts and things that i had even though i wasn't making a lot of money you know i had some debts that were kind of left over for some stuff and allowed me at 11.50 an hour to pay off debts you know i was i was working so hard to pay off debts i applied for a credit card just because they said if you get this credit card we'll give you 300 after you spend a hundred dollars and as soon as i spent the hundred dollars and got the 300 i canceled it and cut up the card and used it to pay off some debts i said praise the lord for the free offers you know and i i see it's like well you know not abusing this world but using it rather i was trying to use it to my advantage and the lord just really blessed me that way and so trying to so it kind of come into the end here you know just at the end of how the lord kind of led me to my wife and uh and things and you know again i come to the place like lord i want to get married and and trying to find out the will of the lord for that and uh and i remember i remember hearing a story and maybe it seems like it and lord forgive me if i was being even immature in this way but i remember hearing a story just in passing of probably hearsay from someone else about a sister that had wanted to get married so bad that she prayed and prayed and prayed and lord put it on her heart that she she bought a suit that would match exactly what she desired in a husband and she put that in her closet and prayed over it and things like that and i and as silly as that sounds that just kind of struck in my mind and i remember walking through a mall walking through the mall when malls were still a thing before the time that we live in now you know and walking through them all and just thinking i remember seeing uh i think it was that store forever 21 and they sold a lot of women stuff there but they actually sold long skirts there at the time and i remember seeing those and that came to my mind i said lord i said lord maybe it's silly but i went in there and i bought i thought about it i said lord i'm gonna buy this skirt i bought a skirt and i prayed to her i said lord i said lord whoever my wife is is going to fit this skirt just perfectly and i just put it in my closet i crumpled it up really small and stuffed it in the closet so if someone went in the closet they didn't think brother randy had a skirt for some random reason and i hit it and i and i just left it and then and that was all it was for a while i left it in there for it was probably at least a year or more and that may be silly and i don't encourage anyone to even do that but just i just did it you know and it was maybe my desperation looking for something maybe to latch onto in faith and just praying and you know and and trying and i had and i had tried different times throughout the the years even to like make moves to like see a sister or something that i thought well maybe the lord would lead that way and i'd get shut down here and lead this way and i'd get shut down there and even the parents would just shut me down sometimes and i'm like lord i don't know what's happening here and and then and then in 2011 my wife moved back to iowa and was staying with her parents and uh i just been praying and praying and i kind of left it alone left it alone and i kind of the lord i i'm not really perceptive when it comes to social things but i didn't even find i didn't even find out until after the fact you know because the church there in des moines you might know is pretty small and there's really nobody else that was there of my age that i could marry except for her and she had just really started serving the lord and really you know she had gone through some different times and the lord was working in her life and she was coming through and i had kind of maybe felt a little bit of a pull in that direction but i would kind of just put it off because i was like no i don't i can't be it that can't be this and that and uh and i'd kind of really push it off push it off push it off and then um i kind of went and then finally i was like all right i kind of we started talking a little bit just just talking and not even really seriously in a way but i was just kind of very very kind of like on the outskirts like lord let's see maybe maybe maybe not i don't know you know how it is you know you're just you really want to be sure you want to be positive you know you really want to have the mind of the lord and uh and so i was like well lord i said i'm just going to give her the test you know you know because i could see that the lord had been working in her life and i knew that she was serving the lord you know so that was the first thing first and foremost i'd seen the change the lord had made in her and and i could see you know and i remember thinking looking at the family i remember thinking in my heart of when you want to decide on a wife look at the mother because the scripture says as is the the daughter is so the as the mother is so is the daughter and i was looking at that character and i really appreciated her mother's character because i could see that she had such a heart for her children and she was a real mother to her children and had such a a heart for her children to serve god and how she really desired that and still does you know has that heart and such a motherly desire to to see her children serve god and i was like lord that's that you know that would be a good mother to children you know to have that kind of uh attitude and everything and and so i said well lord i'm just gonna i'm gonna go and and and do it i said lord i'm gonna give her the skirt i thought because i kind of forgot about it and i said lord i'm just gonna do it i said lord i'm gonna step out in faith and maybe it sounds silly to you but it's just where i was desperation-wise and uh again i'm not encouraging anybody to do these things this is my testimony of what the lord did for me so you know you follow your pastor you follow the leader of the holy ghost in your life okay because not every i i'll be the first to tell you not everything i do is always expedient or the smartest thing you know i i don't set myself to be of the best example but uh but i i said laura i guess you know i remembered it because i kind of forgot it slipped out of my memory i said oh yeah i have that skirt and i had prayed over that i said all right lord i said this may be crazy but i'm gonna do it and so i remember i texted her you know at this point we have cell phones now and i said i said after service i just have something to give you and and she said okay and she was kind of confused i'm sure and i gave it to her i said i said i have this skirt to give you i said when you get home tried on and tell me you know how it fit and and uh and i said i'd ask the lord i said it'll fit it'll fit perfectly it'll fit just right you know if it's of him and and i remember i called her afterwards i said so how was it and she said yeah it fit just right and everything and and i was like i said i said lord if i said if i'm going to do this i have to do it if i'm going to honor it i said that's what my thought was i said i told her i told her right there you know we'd only been really kind of talking to each other for six days and so people think i was crazy but i i said i i just i believe i believe if the lord shows you something in faith then you go by faith you know and so i i told her right there i said i said you may think i'm crazy and if you want to run away that's fine i said but i'm going to marry you i said because i said and i told i explained to her the testimony of it and you want to know what the crazy thing was she said okay she said okay i can believe that and and i i was shocked you know but it had to be god because i don't think anybody and i come to find out later that that the lord had been working on her heart the whole time and she had had a really pull towards me and i didn't even know it because i was too socially enough to even see any signs that she might have thought that way about me you know or even had those desires and and to see how the lord works on both ends and so but anyway i say that part of it to get to the part of how the lord really just confirmed it to me because now you if you ever do anything for the lord in faith the devil is going to be there to resist he is going to be right there to resist all the way and i tell you brothers and sisters as soon as that happened you know the lord the lord i had bought a ring and everything i was like i'm going to i'm going to do this. i told her that over the phone like i believe we're going to get married i really do believe that i didn't ask her at that point i just said i believe that i wasn't she didn't think now she didn't think it was going to happen as fast as it did but i was ready i had already been ready i purchased not only that i had already purchased a ring before all this and i purchased the ring not knowing her ring size or anything and um but i it she didn't know it but um so i had uh prepared and i said lord you open up a window and i'm gonna do i'm gonna ask her and so uh it was really kind of interesting because we had gone out with her family her and i and her family had gone out to eat some frozen yogurt after the service one night on a wednesday and she had to work the next morning and uh her family you know was kind of like okay we want to make sure you're home kind of early because you kind of have to get up early in the morning and i told her i didn't want to i didn't want to propose to her in the parking lot of a frozen yogurt place and i had no other place thought of because i don't plan far enough ahead for these things brothers and sisters i don't plan at all a lot of times and i just knew i was like lord this i just felt led that it was the time though and so i said well come with me back to the church i got something i have to do there real quick and she's like okay and she told me she after the fact she told me she was actually kind of frustrated because she's like she's like we only have a little bit of time to fellowship together and and hang out together a little bit and and you're gonna waste half of it driving over the church back again and and she's like and so she got out of the car and i knelt down and asked her to marry me and and she was so shocked the only word she could say was are you serious and i said brazil and she and then she said yes of course and i and i knew it was god just you know only god can do something like that to lead i mean because we i tell people i and i use it as a testimony for people that i work with and when they asked me about my wife i said yeah i said i said i proposed to her after we we dated and we weren't even dating according what the world calls it because we don't do that but i said we we courted her day i said i said i dated my wife for nine days before i proposed to her and they look at me like what in the world i said i said hey i said when the lord tells you to do something you do it and i tell him i said it's in the lord it was one of the best decisions i ever made because my wife has been faithful my wife have been by my side and she's been supportive of me and she's been she's been and i again i go back to the book brother jesse that you read uh that you wrote how it like she's been my correction you know she's been there to help to help push me on when when the devil's fighting me and i'm there to uplift her and it's always amazing to me and i've expressed even this to her of how it's amazing how the lord will work in that of how when i'm up she might be down and i can lift her up and then at times when i'm down she'll be up and she can lift me up and how the lord always brings a balance like that and so you know we pray i did that and and at that and uh well again i skip things and forgive me for skipping things but because the real testimony of the whole thing comes you know the devil really started fighting me after i told her these things of like i'm i'm i really believe we're going to get married because then i expressed to her those things and now the devil's fighting like did you really pray that prayer over that skirt and it's amazing how the devil will try to make you not even believe what's actually happened and it's amazing how how wicked the devil is in that because the dead and that you'll find the devil will do this in your life for anything that you have need of or are fighting with if you have need of something the devil will fight you and fight you and fight you to get to the blessing and then when you get to the blessing he'll try to tell you the blessing never happened and it's so interesting he'll fight you to keep you from the blessing because he knows the blessing's there but then when the blessings happen he'll try to he'll try to convince you that it didn't happen and and i find that's how the devil at least was working with me he's like oh you didn't pray this prayer and these things and i'm really battling in my mind because you know i was like lord this is a big decision but i believe you've led me this way but and i remember you know but i was like before i propose so i'm backing up a little bit again so forgive me i know it's jumbled i'm not a very good public speaker so forgive me but i remember thinking like lord i i want to ask her parents first i want to do this right like i told her what my intentions are i told sister lindsay i told her what my intentions were but i want to tell her parents before i actually make the move because i want to do it right you know i want to do this right i want to make sure they understand what's going on because i'm sure it might be a shock to them that i plan on doing this so early and so i had texted uh tech or maybe he left a voice message one of the two her father and uh sent a message to him or something and just said hey if you have opportunity i would really like to get together with you and sister kim who are my my father-in-law's brother dan and sister kim i said i really like to get together with you guys to discuss something and i know you know they they're intelligent enough can read enough into it that they probably know what's going to happen in that conversation maybe but at the same time i'm just like well we'll see what happens and um so but they didn't answer and and i just be honest with you i could feel my faith you know you when you get into the anointing and you have things happen and things happen you know your faith comes to a certain level sometimes and and maybe you'll be in a certain place where you're ready to receive it but then as time goes on that devil tries to wear on you and maybe can wear away and tries to remove faith from the situation and i know just me being the the person that i am you know in the age that we live in such an intellectual age you start to overthink things and i know my brain is just going and going did you really mean that did you really hear this did you really pray that did you really and i remember getting down before the lord and praying earnestly and crying before the lord that day because i knew myself and i knew the faith that i had was at that level and i remember praying before the lord because they weren't answering it was like half the day and i knew they had had to have gotten the message but they weren't answering me and i'm thinking are they going to reject me lord if if and i remember praying before the lord i said lord i know i have the faith right now that you've given me to do this. i said but lord if i'm not able to go move forward with it i said i i don't know if i will have the faith to do it if it lasts another week because you know how it is you just you sometimes you're just you haven't grasped it as much as you ought to you know and lord forgive i say lord i believe but help my own belief you know sometimes you go through those those periods and um i remember getting down and praying and i prayed for probably a solid hour and i cried i i cried tears i said lord just help me you know to to make the right decision and if this is the right thing and and if you'll do it you'll vindicate it for me just to help me i said lord i don't i don't want to ask for more vindication because you vindicated so much but maybe if you just vindicate it for me and i and i and i got i was really tired after i prayed and i was like i'm going to take a nap and we'll see we'll just see what happens you know i took a nap and i when i woke up the thing that woke me up was a text message from her father or i think my yeah from her father saying oh yeah we could if you want to come over right now we can talk and so and come to find out the lord worked on that end too because they had been out uh her parents had been out doing yard work and uh gotten the text message and they kind of knew what the text message was about but they were kind of putting it off and avoiding it and ignoring it because they were kind of you know they loved their daughter and they kind of knew what it was probably going to be about but they're kind of hesitant because hey here comes this guy in nine days he's gonna maybe do the propose and and uh they had confidence in me but at the same time as a parent you know you could understand how much of a faith that was you know my goodness but during the time after i prayed the lord had worked on her mother's heart to go back to her husband and say hey we need to get together with him and the lord moved even on their end to get so the lord heard my prayer and he's just so merciful to me like in all my ups and downs and everything he's so good to me and i don't deserve the least of his mercies but his his mercies are renewed every morning and thank the lord for it you know so so i i talked with them and they gave their blessing on and then we went and you know uh proposed and everything and and the lord is blessed and uh you know i uh you know and in closing i'll just tell one last little testimony you know you pray for us because you know we're we're looking to have children you know and uh i believe you know i believe you may be in a similar situation to you brother amen and you know my wife's had four miscarriages so far you know and none of them made it very very long you know they've and i'm and i'm just again being transparent so you know what you can maybe pray for us on you know and uh you know uh but just to give one last little testimony you know the lord's really blessed us and uh he's been so gracious to us you know when we first got married we were both working because i wasn't making a lot of money i was working at a factory and uh you know we didn't have any children yet so i was like well she's working at the hospital she was a receptionist at the hospital and it was good it was you know nice and everything it was pretty easy work for her to do and she was close to work and her mom had got blessed her with that job or she the lord the lord just to give you a testimony on that side when she was looking for a job the lord had given her such favor with the people there through her mom at the hospital that they actually created the position that she worked in specifically to give her a job and so it was just a blessing on that end and so i was working at this factory and uh you know i uh right after we had gotten engaged i had my hand almost chopped off my hand like a guillotine almost and chopped it all the way down to the bone and severed all the nerves and ligaments and everything and i had to have like six or seven hours of surgery um and that's another little mini testimony because uh you know by the grace of god i didn't lose my hand and just to show you even the grace of god in that moment i remember when it happened you know you think of how you'd react in a moment something like that so traumatic i remember the thing hit me and i knew it was bad from the instant it happened i mean it's just a shock to your system you know it's your body goes into shock and just pain and i never even looked at it i just grabbed it and i i remember just screaming and but i the holy ghost how it'll do things for you know because i remember being even amazed looking back at it i remember getting down on my knees in that moment and saying lord i remember just praying to the lord i said lord i said lord just give me grace to endure this and and my hand is literally half off like i never looked at it because i remember the one thing and i thank the lord for this i remember thinking if you look at it it's going to be a lot worse because i could and forgive me if it seems gruesome but i could in the moment before i grabbed it i could feel it slopping around because it had chopped everything and i remember just thinking lord going down on my knees in that moment and just praying and saying lord lord if this is part of what it takes for me to make a rapture just give me the grace to endure it and i know that's nothing but the grace of god because that's not a normal human action in that moment you know and the lord blessed because when we went to the doctor they had you know had to wait for the ambulance and everything and they came and they wrapped it up as best they could went to the doctor and when the doctor came in you know your ligaments here my fingers were sticking straight out because there was no bottom ligament to curl my fingers in and i couldn't move them because they had all gone up into my wrist and so they had put an oximeter to test your oxygen levels in my fingers because it had so severed everything i found out afterwards all of the blood vessels and everything that supplies blood to the fingers was cut the only thing that was supplying anything was the top little bit of skin that's on your hand and you know that ain't much there and so the doctor was actually pretty shocked to find when he put the oximeter on my fingers it was almost completely normal oxygen readings and they hadn't turned blue they hadn't any of those things and it was just the grace of god you know and and even something this small that maybe you don't think much of but i do remember going in for the surgery they put got ready to put me under and the my my dad's name is jeff and my name is randall or randy people call me randy the doctor that did my surgery was named jeff and my main nurse that did the dispersion was named randy i just thought you know i and i remember thinking about that even when i went into surgeries like the lord doesn't do anything by accident you know and i that's why i'm encouraged because i believe my my dad's coming you know the lord puts little things like that for me as little nuggets and little crumbs of encouragement and um you know from that moment i remember you know the lord by his grace they saved the hand and you could see i i can't maybe don't have the full use of it yet but i know it's coming because i've had i've had brothers that have had a brother that's had a dream about it i know i've had a dream about it playing the guitar fully because i played guitar and everything and by his grace and i know the healing's coming because he's he's he's vindicated that through different testimonies that people have given so you just pray for me that the lord will bring my faith to the place where i can receive it and you'll you'll all know when it happens because i'll be up here playing guitar and it's going to be it's going to be a it's going to be a testimony i'll give to the lord but during that time this will just be the last little bit as we close um you know i was working at that factory i was really blessed by it but though it seemed like in that moment when that happened things kind of turned and at the job they kind of treated me a little bit rough even after this injury happened and and i remember thinking like you know i don't i don't know you know they you know they hadn't really treated me as well as i thought they maybe should have during that period when i was recovering because i went back to work after two weeks after that and i couldn't really work work but they had me do they had me brother they brother and sister they had me in a room i worked in a factory so it's all manual labor and i couldn't do anything like that yet because i hadn't been cleared because my hand was in the cast and stuff to you know the surgery and so they put me in a room i remember they put me in a room and they lost it as it locked me in the room but i had to stay in that room for eight hours a night and watch videos safety videos and stuff all night long and i remember just thinking like why are they doing this to me it was like i mean it sounds it was it was kind of like torture i was exhausted i had to watch i had nothing else to do they you know i couldn't do anything else i wasn't allowed to they wouldn't let me in so much that the one time i got on my phone one time to text my wife because i was bored i had nothing to do i got on my phone one time to text my wife and a supervisor just happened to be looking through the window and they wrote me up for it and i remember in the room with them and i was like why i was like you guys have me in there i can't do anything i've watched all the videos 10 times i was like what do you want me to do you know and i was so i was really kind of frustrated and and and so the lord kind of my dad was an air traffic controller it was like hey they're having a bid an open bid to put in for air traffic controlling and i was so desperate at the time because i was kind of miserable at the job now because they had treated me this way and i put in for it not thinking i would ever get it because there were so many people that applied but god gave me the job you know he gave me the job and uh allowed me to get that job went to the air traffic control academy in oklahoma city and you know allowed me to excel i was top of my class there and because i was top of my class i had first choice of places that i could go when you graduate from there you either graduate from there you don't have a job so the lord allowed me to graduate from that thing it's like a four-month program and i had two choices i could either go to albuquerque new mexico i could go to dallas fort worth and i chose dallas fort worth because it was more money and i didn't know much about albuquerque i didn't really know much about any of them to be honest and uh you know i went down there and i knew that there was a church there but i didn't know where it was and uh but everything was happening so fast i didn't really even have time or even the mind it wasn't even in my mind to really look for the church at the time because everything was happening by the time you were done with the academy you had like a week to find a place to live get down there and get ready for work so i was just scrambling all over the place you know and uh but by the grace of god the grace of god to do it he put us our apartment was less than five minutes from the church that we go to now and so i just say praise god he opens he makes the way where there doesn't appear to be a way you know and so he's in you know he's just blessed us he's brought us farther he's brought me farther into the lord than i ever thought i deserved he's revealed his word to me he's filled me with the spirit and and uh like just giving me a hope of of a hope and a faith of a rapture and a resurrection you know that i believe he's given to to each one of us you know that he's given us that opportunity and so that's just kind of my testimony you know i hope it's an encouragement you know just remember like if you think you're in a spot where get your god can't god can't speak to you or god you're too far gone if you even have that little bit of desire there's god for you to have if there's if there's a desire still in your heart to serve god then there's a god out there who can receive you so don't ever think you've gone too far you know even if you come even if you've come to this message to this truth and then you've fallen away of some sort or fallen into hard hard place spiritually god is still there his blood is still on the mercy seat he's still there to receive you if you got a heart to repent come to real repentance and give it up to the lord and he is faithful and just and he will receive you i hope i hope that's all right for you tonight and i hope that's an encouragement to you because i've been there you know there's maybe not a lot of people i hear a lot of testimonies about people who can say well i grew up in this word and i grew up in this i didn't grow up in it and even after it was revealed to me i backslid for a season but you know what god is faithful he is more than able he's given brothers and sisters even naturally he's blessed me far and above anything that i could have ever thought and spiritually it's so far beyond that i can't even comprehend and i'm not worthy of it i'm not a good steward of it even naturally or spiritually i i hope pray for me that i'm a better steward of the things of god even when it comes to the word and even the natural things but i pray that the lord you know i thank the lord that he's at least given me a revelation of his mercy and grace that you can come back to him and repent and he's he's faithful and he's just to receive you don't ever lose sight of that and i know brother jesse even mentioned that yesterday it's that continual repenting we've lost that in this age people have become so hard and they've either become so hard to it and numb to it that they just don't care or they become so puffed up in their knowledge of the word that they just think that everything can just go by but god desires truth on the inward parts he desires a a a humble and contrite heart he won't despise so as we'd all stand i'll just invite your pastor back to close the service uh you know i know we kept you along again tonight but uh you know it's the first time i've ever given my testimony live so i you know i guess it was a long one i probably went maybe into too much detail but i i just want to give glory to the lord jesus you know he brought he brought me out of the miry clay he brought me from these things he brought me out of of of the trials and temptations and the things that i've struggled with and and he's still bringing me out to this day and one of these glorious days when he calls my name and i answer in this body's change he's going to bring us out for the last time he's going to bring us out of this old body of flesh in a moment we're going to cast off this mortal body and and be clothed upon with an eternal one by his grace so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and then we'll have if you have need of prayer we'll pray for you you know this may not have been a normal type of service but you know what god's still here because his word said he's still here and so we'll uh you know we're not we're not like those in the pentecostal ranks you know that me and brother jesse grew up in where we think that you have to be emotional to receive something from god or it has to be a super what we call hyped up service that you have to receive something from god there was a time where we maybe believed that when we were in pentecost and and i didn't say this necessarily but i remember that they would beat me literally beat you on the back and try to get you to speak in tongues and i remember pretending to speak in tongues thinking that was the way to get to god and i could be and i'll be honest and tell you i never spoke in tongues because i just faked it and did what they thought what i thought i should do but you know what not all the scripture says not do all speak with tongues well you know why paul said it because it's a rhetorical question because a rhetorical question means the answer is obvious no not all speak with tongues not all have every gift but i say i receive the gift of the holy ghost that leaves and what is it it leads you and guides you into all truth and he shall lead you and guide you into all truth he'll show you things that are and he'll show you things to come and he's doing it right now we're seeing it fulfilled before our very eyes we're seeing modern events made clear by prophecy even now so praise the lord for that heavenly father we just give you glory and praise and honor lord you are high and lifted up father your name is worthy to be praised the the matchless name of the lord jesus christ lord the world would try to split you into three persons many things would try to uplift ministers or ministries and different people up to different positions but lord we know that the scripture says that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall proclaim that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father lord you've only taken one vessel and exalted into that place and that was jesus christ [Music] lord filled with the spirit of jesus [Music] lord i can testify as i have over there lord i've had my skills i've had my trials we could ever have thought of lord you deserve all the poor you deserve all the praise lord and i and i'm not ashamed of my testimony in the gospel of christ father because i can glory in the fact that through all [Music] lord not to glory in them but lord just to remember your faith but let us always be in remembrance of your lord that grace just bless each other for their patience bless each and every one lord if there be someone that this testimony of god has broken maybe not in the right [Music] lord if they've got a desire in their heart to after righteousness serve be filled lord we're hungering for more of you lord even i've got my hands raised i'll raise him to your lord i desire more of you lord i don't have enough of you lord the more i get of you the more i realize i don't have enough of you more because it's just the more truth i receive the lord the more i realize your perfection in holiness is just beyond anything i can come to in myself [Music] lord but as we talked about the beginning lord even though that scripture is real and cast it off as little responding won't let us not cast it off that way but then when we've been drawn by
