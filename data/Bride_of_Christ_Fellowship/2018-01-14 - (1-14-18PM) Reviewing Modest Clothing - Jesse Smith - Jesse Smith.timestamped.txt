[10:21] let's take our Bibles that stand tonight
[10:23] I promise I'm gonna keep it shorter on
[10:25] the song end here amen let's go to first
[10:28] Timothy 2:9 I want to just review I just
[10:31] call this reviewing modest clothing I
[10:35] just want to review this like I said
[10:36] I've just been felt burdened to go this
[10:37] direction and write a book on it so
[10:42] we're working on that and like I said I
[10:45] gave about three hours to read this book
[10:47] yesterday morning really good book I
[10:49] really enjoyed it
[10:51] there's only 71 75 pages or something
[10:54] like that
[10:55] Wow I could read through a book in one
[10:58] day who knew trouble is I'm choosing to
[11:00] loan books I got two smaller shorter
[11:02] books I just got so enthralled in it and
[11:05] it was just saying everything I'm saying
[11:07] except we have the message to really
[11:09] light these things up like I said we
[11:11] have even more Scripture but they do it
[11:14] like I said a really good job on
[11:15] scripture first Timothy 2:9 and who here
[11:24] has watched my long dresses in the Bible
[11:26] vide who's watched it okay everybody
[11:28] okay
[11:28] most people okay answer who's watched my
[11:32] for guidelines for Bible modesty okay
[11:34] what's almost okay alright so I will go
[11:37] over that tonight by God's grace I
[11:39] appreciate I know Adam has been really
[11:41] expressing some thanks for the videos
[11:44] that really encouraged me brother thank
[11:46] you so much and I appreciate that and I
[11:50] hope they're a blessing I was thing
[11:52] about this morning like wow if anyone in
[11:53] the church ever moves in and they don't
[11:55] nothing about the message I've got 50
[11:56] videos at each of them I could sit but
[11:59] I'd probably better to sit with them in
[12:01] a Bible study but it's like I can't get
[12:02] to it
[12:03] there's a lot of teaching there so we're
[12:05] grateful for that but the master
[12:07] teaching put your roots down amen and he
[12:09] said it makes you settled in the Word of
[12:10] God so we were grateful for God's
[12:12] settling power first Timothy 2:9 all
[12:19] right
[12:20] in like manner also that women adorn
[12:23] themselves in modest apparel with
[12:24] shamefacedness and sobriety not with
[12:28] broided hair now that means golden I've
[12:30] rooted up the Romans around the Romans
[12:33] have but gold things a grease in their
[12:35] hair there's some pictures of that and
[12:37] then also it meant expensive so they
[12:41] would pay a lot of money to make their
[12:43] hair bride it or something like that and
[12:47] some some people ask me does that mean
[12:49] you can't braid your hair no this means
[12:50] some type of expensive hairstyle or
[12:53] adding gold to it or something that the
[12:56] women would go above and beyond brother
[12:58] Graham said that too it's not a braided
[13:00] hair broided hair or of gold or pearls
[13:03] or costly array but which becometh women
[13:06] professing godliness with good works and
[13:08] let's go to revelation 113 we'll just
[13:11] read that then we'll have you be seated
[13:13] by God's grace
[13:16] [Music]
[13:25] like I said we'll try try to do a Bible
[13:27] study on this and make it a nice short
[13:33] strong powerful shot amen
[13:36] nice inoculation tonight I'll just make
[13:38] it ah ha ha our quick shot of an octal a
[13:41] tion of God's love amen
[13:42] revelation 1:13 let's read that together
[13:44] 1 2 3 and in the midst of the seven
[13:48] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[13:50] Man clothed with a garment down to the
[13:53] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[13:55] golden girl even God has blessed see the
[13:57] Reavers work may be seated
[13:59] god bless you now you can switch over
[14:01] when you're ready let's look at modesty
[14:06] I pulled up this PowerPoint from 2015
[14:12] and I use this on the videos as well I
[14:14] just gave ideas or just giving some
[14:17] basic ideas about how to cover the body
[14:19] and I think this is both I think both
[14:22] these bodies are man bodies that's why
[14:23] the woman looks just the bigger than you
[14:25] know they're supposed to be man bodies
[14:27] you know I apologize I don't mean to do
[14:29] that but just so you know this
[14:32] represents the Lord Jesus of the
[14:33] scripture we just read in a garment down
[14:35] to the feet and then you know we
[14:37] encourage sisters you know I'm going to
[14:38] show how if you least cover to the knees
[14:40] that's godly but we just feel like the
[14:42] Holy Spirit is calling us to cover more
[14:44] there's a lot of reasons behind that
[14:46] like if a sister bends over or if she
[14:48] sits a certain way if the skirt just
[14:50] goes past the knee then it exposes a
[14:52] little bit of the thigh so we just as we
[14:55] said in the video we just encourage
[14:56] sisters to and brothers to brothers to
[14:58] to wear as long as garments as possible
[15:01] praise God so this is from 2015 but I'm
[15:03] just going to pull out a few things I'm
[15:05] going to show you some other things some
[15:09] other visuals I mean what I mean by that
[15:11] so I got 15,000 five over five fifteen
[15:14] thousand five hundred words right now by
[15:16] God's grace I got intro chapter one two
[15:18] and three all done so I'm really excited
[15:20] I feel like he knows a man like I feel
[15:23] like I'm getting somewhere you know I
[15:24] feel feel good about that and I feel I
[15:26] was talking about John you know I said
[15:28] we're talking about this and I said even
[15:30] if it helps one soul it'll be a
[15:32] tremendous blessing but I know to help
[15:34] more than that and the reason I know
[15:36] that is because this mess
[15:37] is on fire around the world here it's
[15:40] dying because it's been this country has
[15:42] been harvested over and over and over
[15:44] and over to where there's not many
[15:46] there's not many left it's gleaning over
[15:47] here but it's on fire in China it's on
[15:50] fire in South America it's on fire other
[15:52] places too so that's where I see a lot
[15:55] of our videos get picked up and over
[15:57] overseas I got a lot of questions from
[15:58] overseas so a lot of testimonies from
[16:01] overseas and Bob ley South Africa
[16:03] different places I can't think of them
[16:05] all so I felt like if God Terry's God
[16:07] can use a teaching like this or videos
[16:09] or books or something like that to
[16:12] minister to the people who are hungry
[16:14] and thirsty for the Word of God do you
[16:15] remember how you felt when you first
[16:16] read the church age book things and
[16:18] remember how you felt and I was it was
[16:20] exciting every page I don't know you
[16:21] might remember oh man and it was just
[16:23] and so much understanding came
[16:26] especially on the Godhead the book of
[16:28] life water baptism it almost answered
[16:30] every question I had and that's what I
[16:32] want this to be I'm trying to pull
[16:33] quotes from other Branum scriptures I
[16:35] want to be something where people can go
[16:38] and find truth and that's why I want to
[16:41] be so I want to be the perfect will of
[16:42] God
[16:43] now modest has two definitions not
[16:48] revealing emphasizing the figure and
[16:50] dressing as to avoid indecency
[16:51] especially to avoid sexual attention now
[16:55] in the book I start off by showing and I
[16:58] got a little sorry this is this should
[17:00] be skipped out of here I start by
[17:02] showing as Christians we can prove the
[17:03] perfect will of God that's in Romans 12
[17:06] verse 1 present your bodies a living
[17:08] sacrifice unto God proving the perfect
[17:11] will of God so we can that's what I want
[17:13] to emphasize in this book like we're not
[17:15] guessing people should dress this way
[17:18] this is God's perfect will this is what
[17:21] God requires and I want you to know
[17:24] there's two kinds of nakedness
[17:26] in the scripture and so let's read these
[17:28] here we're familiar with Genesis 2 and 3
[17:32] where Adam and Eve sinned and they are
[17:33] completely naked
[17:34] there are no clothes on them at all but
[17:37] the Bible cause there's another kind of
[17:38] nakedness John 21 7 let's read that and
[17:41] then we'll read the other ones too I
[17:42] think there'll be a help to you
[17:43] I think they'll help you understand it a
[17:47] little bit better it's really helping me
[17:49] to review these things
[17:52] and I hope it be a blessing tonight John
[17:55] 21-7 remember this is after Jesus rose
[17:58] from the dead the disciples say ah Peter
[18:01] said I go fish it I'll just go back to
[18:03] my previous lifestyle you know to me he
[18:05] said there's a little quietness not
[18:07] quite sure what to do
[18:08] I'll just go back to fishing which you
[18:10] know Jesus worked with him Jesus you
[18:11] know eventually fill him with the Holy
[18:13] Ghost but nothing bad necessarily but
[18:19] Jesus was on the shore and he told the
[18:21] casting out on the other side and then
[18:22] he pulled up a multitude of fishes in
[18:24] verse 6 and verse 7 therefore that
[18:26] disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter
[18:27] it is the Lord now in Simon Peter heard
[18:31] that it was the Lord he Girt his
[18:32] Fisher's Co unto him for he was naked
[18:35] and did cast himself into the sea so
[18:39] this is a different nakedness the
[18:40] fishers coat was the outer garment so
[18:43] they must have had a special outer
[18:44] garment they wore when they went fishing
[18:47] but underneath every Jew wore a tunic
[18:51] underneath ok we'll go through that a
[18:53] little bit so when he the Bible said he
[18:55] was naked he wasn't completely naked he
[18:57] had that long shirt like tunic on and it
[19:00] was just a thinner layer of clothing ok
[19:03] but notice when he went to see the Lord
[19:06] what he do put on more clothes so nobody
[19:09] can say no this is a New Testament you
[19:10] know this is he's risen no you know they
[19:12] couldn't say oh well the high priests of
[19:14] the Old Testament
[19:15] that's just Old Testament you can't say
[19:17] that because now Christ the true high
[19:19] priest hey Corey
[19:21] there is an high priest the high priest
[19:23] of our profession amen now he's risen
[19:25] and Peter knows he's gonna meet the Lord
[19:28] he puts on more clothes amen
[19:31] so I think I think thank you so you can
[19:33] see that and I think that would help
[19:35] people see that when you approach the
[19:38] Lord you've got to be wholly covered you
[19:40] got to be covered the right way ok go to
[19:42] Saul in 1st Samuel 1924 and I know a lot
[19:48] of this is reviewed by church we need to
[19:49] review it I'll be honest when I met back
[19:52] I forgot a lot of this stuff just
[19:53] because I'm on preaching on other things
[19:54] you know I forget why do I and it was
[19:57] good reminder this is why I have my
[19:58] girls and when my girls and my son asked
[20:00] me questions I can answer them this is
[20:02] why we do it it's to please the Lord
[20:05] first add me on 1924 now remember saw a
[20:12] saw was trying to kill David so he sent
[20:14] messengers I think two times and they
[20:16] they started prophesying so Saul's like
[20:17] I'm going myself I'm gonna kill myself
[20:19] and then when he got there he got under
[20:21] that anointing and he started
[20:22] prophesying 1924 First Samuel 1924 and
[20:29] he stripped off his clothes also and
[20:31] prophesied before Samuel in the like
[20:33] manner and lay down naked all that day
[20:35] and all that night wherefore they say is
[20:37] saw also among the prophets now see this
[20:40] is the same idea with Peter
[20:42] he took off as an outer garment okay he
[20:45] wasn't completely naked from what I can
[20:47] see because that wouldn't make any sense
[20:49] why would God ask Aaron to put on
[20:52] clothes to come into his presence but
[20:54] then Saul can take off his clothes it
[20:57] just doesn't seem to make any sense
[20:59] so what happened is that same thing kind
[21:01] of like with David as we'll get to next
[21:02] let's go to 2nd samuel 6:14 david took
[21:07] off his outer kingly garments and then
[21:10] he just had on an ephod which was a
[21:15] long-sleeve shirt like garment that a
[21:18] priest would wear and it kind of covered
[21:20] the shoulders and it kind of went down
[21:22] I'm not sure how far it went down but it
[21:25] was worn on top of the undergarment
[21:28] second Samuel 6:14 some people say that
[21:33] David danced naked before the Lord and
[21:35] that's wrong that's a misunderstanding
[21:36] of the scripture first samuel was our
[21:41] second samuel 6:14 and David danced
[21:49] before the Lord with all of his might
[21:50] and David was girded with a linen ephod
[21:53] he fought again covers his shoulder has
[21:55] special shoulder coverings and then it's
[21:58] a long shirt I'm not sure how long but
[22:00] he was clothed he was leaping and
[22:03] dancing before the Lord and member
[22:05] Michael makes fun of him and then she
[22:07] gets barren because she made fun of a
[22:09] Holy Ghost person dance in the spirit
[22:11] that's fine just love if I feel free to
[22:13] dance you know how Olivia don't make fun
[22:15] of me because I want to worship Jesus
[22:16] amen that's how we
[22:18] we have such a Liberty and a joy in his
[22:20] presence in his presence is fullness of
[22:22] joy amen so see there's two kinds of
[22:26] nakedness the scripture says the first
[22:28] kind is just completely naked no clothes
[22:31] at all the second kind is you have just
[22:35] the under layer on which we would call
[22:36] like a underwear layer for ourselves
[22:38] it's under the outer garment and it's a
[22:41] tunic now I'm not gonna spend we're not
[22:44] gonna read all these but Christ owns us
[22:47] and we are here so he makes the clothing
[22:49] rules the Bible said we're bought with
[22:51] the price the precious blood of Jesus
[22:53] you are not your own right
[22:55] we are Christ and then I like how Jesus
[22:58] says why do you call me Lord and don't
[22:59] do the things that I say amen and I like
[23:03] this the Bible says all manner of
[23:04] holiness let's read that first Peter
[23:05] 1:15 first Peter 1:15 I'm gonna try that
[23:11] I said speed us up a little bit first
[23:13] Peter 1:15 I know this is a lot of
[23:16] review about I just want to emphasize
[23:17] some important thoughts now let's
[23:24] actually let's go up and read 14 as
[23:26] obedient children not fashioning
[23:27] yourselves according to the former lusts
[23:29] in your ignorance we used to have former
[23:31] lusts and we used to fashion or conform
[23:34] our lives to our previous lusts and
[23:36] that's why we should have look at today
[23:37] is my life conforming more to worldly
[23:41] lusts or is my life becoming more
[23:43] dedicated to Christ
[23:45] am i crucifying the flesh more or am i
[23:48] feeding the flesh more that's what Peter
[23:51] saying we don't fashion we don't conform
[23:53] our lives to the world we can form our
[23:55] lives to Christ okay now verse 15 but as
[24:01] he which hath called you is holy so be
[24:03] holy in all manner of conversation now
[24:05] that means conversation conduct and
[24:09] behavior so that covers everything all
[24:12] matter of conversation that word
[24:14] conversation just not words
[24:15] it's behavior conduct standard of life
[24:18] it's everything so Peter says in every
[24:21] area of your life you must be holy which
[24:23] means you must be separate from the
[24:24] world can I let me inject a thought here
[24:27] let's go to 1st Corinthians 9 I just
[24:29] this was my chapter to read this morning
[24:30] I was so blessed
[24:32] I thought my I gotta share this with the
[24:33] church I just thought it meant a lot to
[24:34] me I just thought it meant a lot
[24:37] first Corinthians 9 now this chapter
[24:40] Paul tells the Corinthians he said look
[24:43] I have power to be married but I'm not I
[24:45] have power to work I'm sorry power to
[24:48] take tithes and offerings but I don't
[24:50] some people do I do I'm thankful I can
[24:52] do it by God's grace when I need it and
[24:55] thankfully I can give a lot too I'm very
[24:57] thankful for that by the grace of Lord
[24:59] but he talks about anyone who goes to
[25:02] war gets paid he doesn't go on offer
[25:05] nothing and then he says thou shalt not
[25:08] muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn
[25:11] and does God care for oxen does God care
[25:14] for oxen yes does God care for those of
[25:17] you who are laboring for the gospel yes
[25:19] whatever you're doing God cares now look
[25:23] at verse 10 this is powerful or say if
[25:25] he it off together for our sakes for our
[25:27] sakes no doubt this is written can you
[25:30] believe that that was from Deuteronomy
[25:32] 22 Deuteronomy 22 is written for who New
[25:37] Testament believers isn't that striking
[25:40] the the Jewish mind reads that oh yeah I
[25:43] got to feed my ox when he's treading out
[25:44] the corn but God said Paul said he
[25:47] didn't write that for their sakes for
[25:48] the actual ox the physical ox he wrote
[25:51] it for us spiritual oxes they uh slavers
[25:55] in the gospel he wrote it for our sakes
[25:58] see that's why you can't make blanket
[26:00] statements like oh we don't under the
[26:02] Old Testament anymore we don't need that
[26:03] you can't make blanket statements like
[26:05] that you've got to see how does the Holy
[26:07] Spirit interpret the Word of God and you
[26:10] and you've whatever question is we've
[26:11] got to take that back to the word and is
[26:13] this something Jesus teaches Genesis to
[26:15] Revelation is this the law magnified
[26:18] look that closer examine closer so we
[26:21] can see the unseen things is this the
[26:23] law magnified so see I love that that is
[26:26] such a powerful statement this was
[26:28] written for our sakes not for theirs now
[26:31] you know the rest of it he says if I
[26:33] won't to me if I don't preach the gospel
[26:34] and then he says I make myself a servant
[26:39] all in verse 19 and then to the
[26:42] Jews I became as a Jew to them that are
[26:44] under law I kind of became as under the
[26:46] law to them without the law I became as
[26:48] without the law that he might gain them
[26:51] to the week he became weak he would
[26:53] became all things to all men that he
[26:54] might save some so whatever situation he
[26:56] was in he would try to use wisdom to win
[26:59] those souls he would try to think what
[27:02] does a weak person think like I've got a
[27:04] minister
[27:04] what does it you think about this how
[27:07] can I administer to the Jew is that how
[27:09] you feel if I'm talking to a an older
[27:12] dad or older grandpa would think how
[27:15] could a God give me wisdom how to
[27:17] minister to an older grandfather from a
[27:19] previous generation you know he was a he
[27:22] was born after World War two or
[27:23] something you know the baby boomers age
[27:25] give me wisdom for the baby boomers age
[27:27] or if I'm talking to millennial I want a
[27:29] lord give me wisdom to talk to
[27:30] millennial you see we need wisdom for
[27:34] whatever situation we're in now and then
[27:37] at this illustration I mentioned this
[27:39] morning verses 24 to 27 he talks about
[27:41] athletes how they must keep their body
[27:44] to bring it under subjection they must
[27:47] beat in other words they must go to the
[27:49] boxing ring every morning and beat up
[27:51] your body why because in verse 27 he
[27:57] says lest by any means when i have
[27:58] preached to others i myself should be a
[28:00] castaway do you see that if we don't
[28:03] make our body suffer it's possible we
[28:06] could be cast away because we would be
[28:08] living according to what the flesh and
[28:11] when you cater to the flesh when you sow
[28:13] to the flesh you reap to the flesh but
[28:15] when you sow to the spirit you reap to
[28:18] the spirit that's why I've got to make
[28:20] sure I watch how much sugar I eat I
[28:22] gotta make sure that I exercise too
[28:24] twice a week I've got to take care of
[28:26] this body I've got to make sure I fast a
[28:28] couple times a week or however much I
[28:31] feel that of the Lord our lives as we
[28:34] said as we said we shouldn't be
[28:36] conforming to Laodicea we should be
[28:38] conforming to Christ like Paul and I
[28:42] know it's did you ever notice this I
[28:43] notice in my Bible and then chapter 10
[28:45] he says more were brethren I would not
[28:47] that he should be ignorant how that our
[28:49] fathers under the cloud and all passed
[28:50] through the sea and he goes through all
[28:52] this
[28:53] of Israel basically saying they didn't
[28:55] bring their flesh under subjection so
[28:58] they were cast away and you see that can
[29:02] you see that in Laodicea people that
[29:04] follow the messages they get excited
[29:05] bout the message if they don't keep
[29:07] their flesh under control what's gonna
[29:08] happen they're gonna strain because
[29:11] they're catering to their flesh more
[29:13] than the Holy Spirit so I saw that
[29:16] connection this morning and that was
[29:17] that really jumped off the pages to me I
[29:19] thought I gotta share that sometime
[29:20] today with the Saints I don't know when
[29:22] but I'm gonna sneak that in there
[29:23] somewhere
[29:24] Paul said if I don't beat myself up I
[29:27] could be cast away I could be lost
[29:28] because that's what Israel was right
[29:30] they did not inherit the promised land
[29:32] because they didn't have dedication they
[29:36] didn't have what do they call it's the
[29:38] word I'm looking for discipline
[29:40] they have discipline over their human
[29:42] bodies that's right amen all right now I
[29:51] just want to lay that in there all
[29:52] manner of holiness so we have to
[29:53] practice holiness we've got to starve
[29:56] ourselves sometimes I don't know I'm
[29:57] talking about
[29:57] you've got to literally starve yourself
[29:59] you've got a fast you've got to draw
[30:01] closer to God you got to make efforts to
[30:04] be more spiritual at times than just
[30:06] carnal because we're carnal way too much
[30:09] yeah that's why I've got to put myself
[30:12] through that rigor I've got to put
[30:13] myself through the fastenings I got to
[30:15] put myself through that to make sure I
[30:17] don't get worldly because remember we're
[30:19] being fashioned either way all right now
[30:21] like I said some of these have to go
[30:23] through but I was just showing how God's
[30:24] Word transcends all generations the
[30:27] Bible's the Word of God forever so on
[30:29] having Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[30:30] today and forever I'm the Lord God I
[30:32] change not you know all these scriptures
[30:33] we can quote right off which is great
[30:35] we'd love to do that now
[30:38] Philippians 3:16 let's read that again
[30:40] and that goes along with the clothing
[30:42] standard it's kind of hot in here
[30:48] Malachi can you open that window buddy
[30:52] put the ends 316th
[31:00] it's better hot than cold better hot
[31:03] than cold I'd rather be preaching in
[31:04] here than out there right now yeah just
[31:09] all right Saints come on everybody sit
[31:12] real all sisters sit really close
[31:14] together all the brothers sit really
[31:15] close
[31:17] flippy in 3:16 nevertheless we're in 2
[31:21] we have already attained let us walk by
[31:22] the same rule that it's mind the same
[31:24] thing that word rule and the Greek is
[31:26] the word canon and canada is what they
[31:29] call the scripture they call it the
[31:31] Canon and Canon is the carpenter's
[31:33] measuring tape let us all walk by the
[31:38] same measuring tape and brother BAM said
[31:41] we need a clothesline religion right we
[31:43] need to make sure we know what's on the
[31:45] clothesline what's going up there what
[31:46] kind of clothes are people wear you know
[31:47] we need to know is this long enough is
[31:49] this is this holy enough God has one
[31:53] standard to judge everything and that's
[31:55] his word that is the Canon so we are all
[31:58] walked by one standard and God gives us
[32:00] and this is what was revealed to me I
[32:03] was writing the book we have the same
[32:05] clothing standard from Genesis 3:21 to
[32:07] Revelation 22:20 honey the same standard
[32:11] God never changed it this is one of
[32:14] those it's like unchanging things you
[32:17] know about grace and all these things
[32:18] God always had Grace on Abraham and
[32:20] everything that's the Covenant you know
[32:21] all these things that go unchanging you
[32:23] know sin and holiness and all these
[32:25] things the clothing standard never
[32:27] changes all the way through it's so
[32:29] beautiful
[32:30] all right now what I want to do is what
[32:37] I did is Iowa you know I had an hour in
[32:39] there I kind of went through and
[32:40] highlighted in my my outline real quick
[32:42] I just want out what I'll do is I'll do
[32:44] this I just kind of want I'll just go
[32:49] through each chapter a little bit so you
[32:50] can see what's gonna be like by God's
[32:53] grace okay
[32:54] so actually I was in start with the
[32:56] introduction in the introduction I start
[32:59] with how I went to Verizon store when I
[33:01] got my new phone and the first question
[33:03] they asked me when I got in there was
[33:04] not about my phone the woman said our
[33:07] long dress is part of your religion I
[33:09] see all your daughter's wearing them
[33:11] and I was so excited I mean honestly my
[33:14] face I smell like praise God only had
[33:17] three dollars with nothing I'd care at
[33:19] the three youngest months I think three
[33:20] youngest ones and it's so bless me this
[33:23] is a woman you know she's a black woman
[33:25] had hair done she must have straightened
[33:26] her hair is really long and curly and
[33:28] she had such respect she was so polite
[33:30] for me I thought thank you for asking me
[33:32] that and the girls were there I just
[33:34] started talking about Jesus all the even
[33:35] more after that
[33:36] it just opened up a great conversation I
[33:39] said no but I said I'm sorry yes it is
[33:41] Deuteronomy 22:5 says we don't wear the
[33:43] same garments men and women and it
[33:45] opened up a great conversation about how
[33:47] many kids we had and raising kids and
[33:49] how the Bible teaches us to raise our
[33:51] kids it was really special but I just
[33:55] admired I admired this woman out of her
[33:57] she's probably a sinner you know I mean
[33:58] but I admired her because she was so
[34:00] respectful and I said later she had the
[34:02] courage to ask me about clothing most
[34:04] people don't which I'm the same way
[34:06] that's what I put an introduction I'm
[34:07] nervous I'm timid I don't ask people
[34:09] their religious beliefs you know unless
[34:12] I feel really moved by the Holy Spirit
[34:14] so I so admired that woman and and I
[34:18] brought off the others thought from
[34:20] Romans 2:4 let's go there just so you
[34:22] can read it again I'd like you to read
[34:23] us to keep these things in your heart
[34:26] how many know if you hear it on Sunday
[34:28] sometimes you hear in your heart
[34:29] throughout the week oh I heard just
[34:31] heard the preacher preached at Romans
[34:33] 2:4 just and this is what I thought I
[34:41] just thought about this scripture or
[34:43] that despiseth out of the riches of His
[34:45] goodness and forbearance and
[34:46] longsuffering not knowing that the
[34:48] goodness of God leads us to repentance
[34:50] and in my heart I thought boy this this
[34:52] woman really wants to know she's so kind
[34:55] she really wants to note I thought God
[34:58] give me mercy to show it with goodness
[35:00] let me show how your goodness is what
[35:04] makes us put on more clothes
[35:05] it's your goodness because without him
[35:08] we're shameful we're naked but when God
[35:12] tells us how to dress and we it'll be
[35:14] God's goodness O God is going to cover
[35:16] us God's gonna get all the attention off
[35:18] us who we can't save anybody he's gonna
[35:20] use our clothes to get the attention off
[35:22] of us to point to God amen
[35:24] it is the goodness of God that'll lead
[35:27] us to repentance it's God goodness
[35:29] that'll cover our old tattoos that we
[35:31] used to get or you take out our
[35:32] piercings that we used to have or you
[35:34] know it's God's goodness that will do it
[35:36] because it it takes away the attention
[35:39] off us it is a life that's sanctified to
[35:42] Christ it's a life that fully points to
[35:44] Jesus amen
[35:47] now chapter one I kind of go like this I
[35:50] kind of start with the Word of God is
[35:51] the foundation of this book in our lives
[35:53] and spend up quite a few words on that
[35:57] and then God requires holiness just
[36:00] trying to think of any kind of
[36:01] highlighted things that might think
[36:03] might have helped you I already covered
[36:05] that and then going how do we become
[36:07] holy through obedience repentance and
[36:09] the preaching of the word legalism or
[36:12] love and I just want to say that again
[36:14] remember legalism is excessive adherence
[36:17] to the law or the word so if you add
[36:20] something on to the word now you're
[36:22] legalist okay so that's that's how you
[36:28] know what legalism because the example
[36:30] was in Paul Paul tried to inject Paul
[36:33] notice that the Jewish teachers were
[36:35] trying to inject circumcision back into
[36:36] the law and it wasn't required for
[36:38] Gentiles and so the Bible called it
[36:40] legalism and the Paul said that you have
[36:43] left grace because you've gone back to
[36:46] the law okay so we don't want to do that
[36:50] but what the Bible says we have to say
[36:52] now let's go to proverbs 35 and 6 but if
[36:55] it's been a while since you read this I
[36:56] think you'll be happy to read us
[36:58] proverbs 35 and 6 and I appreciate
[37:03] everybody being patient with me I know a
[37:04] lot of these things are familiar but but
[37:06] let's just enjoy them if we can like I
[37:07] said let's take an inoculation remember
[37:09] these things every word of God is pure
[37:13] he's a shield unto them that put their
[37:16] trust in him
[37:17] add thou not to his words lest he
[37:21] reprove thee and thou be found a liar
[37:24] look God is gonna call all these people
[37:27] on the day of judgment if they don't
[37:28] repent God's gonna call them liars now
[37:30] remember the false do we looked at this
[37:32] morning the false Jews says their
[37:33] original holy gospel Christian and
[37:35] they're lying so at some point where do
[37:37] they do
[37:37] they might
[37:38] add or take away from the Word of God
[37:39] and a lot of churches do it with
[37:42] clothing they they take away the
[37:44] clothing or they take away the
[37:46] requirements for clothing that's what
[37:47] most churches do I don't know many that
[37:49] add clothing do you like you gotta wear
[37:52] it now I guess I guess the women that
[37:53] wear the hats maybe I'm sorry the caps
[37:56] rather caps
[37:57] what is it done okay yeah yeah make it
[38:01] legalism yeah
[38:03] yeah yeah where they make it yeah had
[38:05] only yeah right so if they say you have
[38:09] to do that to be saved now they just
[38:10] added another line there like we say if
[38:16] you are saved
[38:17] you'll do what God says to do because
[38:20] you you do works because you are saved
[38:23] you'll find the truth if you are saved
[38:25] that's right
[38:27] so I don't want God to call me a liar I
[38:28] just want to say what the Bible says in
[38:30] regards to modesty so it's not legalism
[38:33] because I'm not we're not teaching
[38:34] anything excessive it's love now that we
[38:37] show our holiness is beautiful I think a
[38:38] few paragraphs on that the Bible said
[38:41] worship the Lord in the beauty of
[38:42] holiness now remember that holiness is
[38:44] all manner of conduct life everything
[38:46] dress everything worship in the beauty
[38:50] of holiness now I pointed out here let
[38:51] me see what I pointed out oh did you
[38:54] know this go to John 14 31 I've been so
[38:58] surprised by this John 14 31 now I think
[39:01] we all know it but I hadn't seen it in
[39:03] scripture in a while John 14 31 let's go
[39:06] there who'd like to read that for me
[39:09] John 14:30 Adam okay thank you
[39:12] whatever you ready amen it been so long
[39:29] since I read that Jesus said I love the
[39:31] father so Jesus he kept every command
[39:35] right how do you keep every command by
[39:37] love it wasn't a legalist like oh this
[39:40] is extra it was I'm gonna keep
[39:42] everything the father said because I
[39:44] love him
[39:45] that was just fresh to me I hadn't seen
[39:47] in a while so Jesus is the very epitome
[39:49] of beauty because of his care
[39:52] because he had no physical beauty that
[39:54] we would desire him but it was his
[39:56] character his beautiful character and
[39:57] that was based upon obedience by love
[40:00] now the next section we go through the
[40:02] two terms modesty and holiness but I
[40:05] think those are pretty familiar to us
[40:06] modesty we went over that not drawing
[40:09] attention yourself holiness means
[40:11] purification separation from the world
[40:14] the beginning of modest : let's go to
[40:17] Genesis 3:7 just to remind us here how
[40:21] am i doing I got 20 minutes well maybe I
[40:23] better I'll probably go a little bit
[40:26] faster then we can go back I thought
[40:29] about keep preaching a whole series on
[40:31] modesty and going a little slower
[40:32] through this so I may do that we'll see
[40:35] but but just I spend all my time on this
[40:37] yesterday so I've got to preach it
[40:38] that's what's fresh to me right now so
[40:40] pardon me Genesis 3:7 okay man okay how
[40:46] about Genesis 3:7 sir okay aprons in the
[40:57] Hebrew is loin covering so it's like a
[40:59] bikini bottom I could say like that I
[41:01] don't know what else to say oh it's like
[41:03] a towel wrapped around your private
[41:05] parts that's all was so when they hid
[41:08] behind the bush they just covered their
[41:10] loins that's all they covered I don't
[41:12] know if he was going like this for
[41:13] upper-body I don't know but it's a loins
[41:15] are only the reproductive area so the
[41:20] first people to dress immodest where
[41:22] Adam and Eve right and then God came in
[41:25] verse 21 we like to read that verse 21
[41:29] Lydia okay so God comes and gave them
[41:40] the coats of skin now coats let me go to
[41:43] that I forget the actual word let me go
[41:44] to that coats so here's Adam and Eve
[41:49] Eric could add me just covers something
[41:51] like this a loin covering okay it was
[41:54] the reproductive parts the air around
[41:56] the hips
[41:57] that was a nakedness that God covers
[41:59] with coats of skins
[42:00] I think the shoulder should be covered
[42:02] too now so I got and I got
[42:03] or doctored on that I got more scripture
[42:06] so coats means a long shirt like
[42:09] garments I've tried to grow an
[42:10] understanding in the last two years
[42:13] because even though this is history I
[42:15] might not get to but the American women
[42:18] when they first started going to the
[42:19] beaches they wore dresses past their
[42:22] knees and then long-sleeve shirts long
[42:25] sleeve and as the 1800s went on in 1900
[42:29] it went like this it was like a slow to
[42:33] wear now they can wear hardly anything I
[42:37] don't even like saying the terms you
[42:38] know like I don't even like saying it
[42:40] but that is literal history and the
[42:43] gentleman is so just it's it's so
[42:45] shocking they go like this just slowly
[42:48] inch by inches said every season every
[42:51] new swimming season they took off a few
[42:52] more inches inch by inch
[42:55] so from 18 I think it was 1890 they said
[42:58] when they first took up the sleeves from
[43:00] 1890 to 1960 they went from this all the
[43:04] way to almost nothing
[43:05] 70 years can you imagine that 70 years
[43:09] and you could in 70 years Satan could
[43:13] strip almost every woman in America
[43:14] almost and isn't this is that sad at one
[43:18] time I heard a preacher say he said how
[43:20] can a woman get out there in a bikini
[43:21] and stand out in front of all these
[43:23] people and yet let it yeah if you took
[43:25] that same woman put her in her house and
[43:27] a stranger walked in and she was in her
[43:28] underwear she would be all covered up
[43:30] you see the hypocrisy in that I thought
[43:33] boy what a striking thought that is is
[43:35] that true like a woman if stranger was
[43:38] in there she didn't know it she'd cover
[43:40] up she'd go get her robe on and cover up
[43:41] but yet outside at the beach she's
[43:43] letting every man look at every part of
[43:44] her form
[43:46] that's called a demon of deception
[43:49] a demon of lust and a demon of deception
[43:51] you're blind and literally naked and you
[43:53] don't even know it spiritually and
[43:56] physically so I just thought I'd show
[43:59] that now these are the areas in the
[44:01] Bible there's different body parts oh I
[44:05] forgot legs yeah I'm sorry members my
[44:07] picture I must got the wrong one sorry
[44:11] I'm my fault there on that one
[44:17] oh I must add a different one yeah this
[44:19] sweat mint is that okay is that okay
[44:21] there's nothing bad on there is it okay
[44:22] all right if you and in the book it was
[44:26] real to me I was writing the book in
[44:27] Daniel to God gives us a breakdown of
[44:30] the five parts of the body with the
[44:31] image it was so it was striking like oh
[44:35] there it is God divides a man into five
[44:38] parts so head I don't have head up your
[44:41] heads the other part a head I would say
[44:43] the collarbone so and then this will be
[44:45] the porosity the shoulders are included
[44:47] in the breast okay so this would be the
[44:49] breast I've got to move my lines up a
[44:51] little bit gonna move my standard up
[44:54] because I didn't have any scripture at
[44:56] that time I didn't understand now my
[44:58] wife and I we always cover our shoulders
[45:00] you never see me walk around with no
[45:01] shirt on you don't do that stuff so head
[45:06] one breast
[45:08] - belly three loins for thighs but I
[45:13] said five or six there must be six I
[45:16] said five must be six yeah there must be
[45:17] soon or no I'm sorry the belly and loins
[45:20] was one on the the statue of Daniel I
[45:23] think right no I don't know how to look
[45:25] it up I'm sorry anyways you understand
[45:27] all the body parts must be covered I
[45:29] think it's five forgive me maybe it was
[45:33] breast in the belly that's gonna bug me
[45:34] so forgive me okay anyways so God chose
[45:40] to cover the entire body
[45:43] okay now I'm quickly moved here so I
[45:49] show the beginning of a modest clothing
[45:51] in Genesis 3 and then I jumped to the
[45:53] days of Noah how they were sexy dress
[45:56] women and how that spirit is on people
[45:59] today I do because Jesus prophesied I
[46:02] just talked about how lust is such a
[46:04] temptation for people to marry outside
[46:06] the faith our spiritual eyes should see
[46:09] that the daughters of men are drawing
[46:11] away sons of God today just by physical
[46:13] outward attraction and the cause for em
[46:16] modesty is demon powers demon possession
[46:18] will cause people to take clothes off
[46:20] demon possession I can't it's hard to
[46:22] imagine but I was so possessed with
[46:23] demons when I was in high school
[46:25] I take off my shirt in front of
[46:27] everybody I'd swim in front of everybody
[46:28] and my wife and I could say the same on
[46:30] that you know we just swear you just
[46:31] what was it two possessed with demons
[46:34] yeah
[46:35] not frothing at the mouth but religious
[46:37] demons and that is the worst kind
[46:40] is that right Church and then the
[46:44] dangers are to dangers I've seen it in
[46:46] modesty the first one is you're guilty
[46:48] of causing others to stumble and you
[46:49] will go you'll answer to Christ for that
[46:51] because the Bible said you sin against
[46:52] Christ when you cause people to stumble
[46:54] so a woman or man that presents himself
[46:56] and people lust after them they're
[46:58] guilty they've sinned against Christ and
[47:00] have to answer for that
[47:01] the second one is your taking captive to
[47:05] the will of evil spirits so you get
[47:07] addicted to it right the so many women
[47:09] addicted to immoral clothing so you get
[47:13] addicted to the spirit of immodesty okay
[47:16] and then I never told this story can I
[47:21] tell you a little story from my life I
[47:22] put this story in here at the end okay I
[47:24] was eight years old so bear with me I'm
[47:26] in second grade acacia how are you eight
[47:28] okay sounds acacia sage I was living in
[47:31] Delta which is a small farm town we
[47:34] moved to Liberty center my second grade
[47:37] year and I start making friendships well
[47:40] over the winter I think it was in the
[47:41] winter we moved and so in the spring of
[47:43] that year I went to my friend's house
[47:45] and I'll never forget it this same set
[47:48] number that we are indication when I
[47:52] think we're eating like a snack before
[47:54] bed and his brother has a teeth his
[47:55] brother's a teenager you put MTV on at
[47:57] the top of it the TV was up there and we
[48:00] watched MTV and I saw videos I had never
[48:03] seen in my life before and I was
[48:05] literally under like this other class I
[48:07] never saw women dance like that I never
[48:10] saw clothes like that and I could not
[48:12] get those pictures out of my mind I went
[48:15] home and it wasn't just a week or two
[48:17] later and never anyone ever used to
[48:20] watch The Cosby Show Neverland okay we
[48:22] watched it religiously we were religious
[48:24] we're religious in some wrong ways too
[48:26] but every Thursday night I think was
[48:28] Cosby night I don't know if that was
[48:29] right night it's Tuesday or Thursday and
[48:31] I never miss Cosby night but after that
[48:36] after seeing that MTV ice
[48:39] cosby night my entire family was
[48:40] watching cosby and i was in the room and
[48:43] I was drawing bikini dressed women on
[48:46] baseball cards because when I was
[48:48] younger that's all I loved was baseball
[48:49] cards so I mixed the spirit of lust that
[48:52] I saw there with the only thing I knew
[48:54] was baseball cards and church in the
[48:57] middle of Cosme my mom walks in and said
[48:59] Jessie what are you doing and I was
[49:01] caught red-handed
[49:02] and there's this new church I'm eight
[49:04] years old and I've already got the
[49:06] spirit of lust on me eight years old
[49:09] just by seeing women dance and were
[49:11] showing their bellies and that was in
[49:13] the early 90s and that wasn't as bad as
[49:15] it is now and that spirit of lust stayed
[49:20] on me for years for years that's all I
[49:23] could think about and my mom didn't
[49:25] embarrass me she took the cards away but
[49:26] I kept thinking about it
[49:28] introduced me into pornography on the
[49:30] Internet I got addicted to that and it
[49:33] stayed over to college I would go to
[49:35] college and you could check out laptops
[49:36] the University of Akron
[49:38] I remember that brother bang or not and
[49:40] you could go study anywhere in the well
[49:42] I would go in there and I would you know
[49:43] do tobacco to tobacco and I'd go on
[49:45] pornography sites and then try to get a
[49:46] little bit of homework done it was awful
[49:48] and then when I came this message this
[49:50] message sent me free and I've not gone
[49:53] back so that maybe was 2002 or 2003
[49:56] I haven't been attracted to any of that
[49:58] because of all the preaching praying see
[50:01] if we want to get delivered by BAM said
[50:02] you got to dig out if you want to be if
[50:04] you were to be empty nice that you got
[50:05] to dig out or or empty up so you can go
[50:07] up hey man you gotta unpack so you can
[50:09] go up praise God and so because all the
[50:12] preaching and all these things I've
[50:13] never gone back to that and God did it
[50:16] before I got married which I'm so
[50:17] thankful because I've seen I've talked
[50:19] to couples where pornography and I just
[50:21] talked about it over in Iowa where
[50:23] pornography is destroying marriages and
[50:27] I'm so thankful Jesus Christ deliver me
[50:28] but I want to show this in the book that
[50:30] had happened at eight years old the
[50:34] spirit of lust jumped on me and God
[50:36] finally delivered me when I'm 22 or 23
[50:38] by the grace of God so that's the second
[50:42] danger being taken captive
[50:44] I was taken captive by the devil at his
[50:47] will because I yielded to his will never
[50:50] understand that
[50:52] all right so I show all the scriptures
[50:53] for that okay there's the conclusion
[50:55] chapter one nope that's done it that's
[50:59] what I'm working on right now I better I
[51:01] got 10 minutes here just bear with me is
[51:05] that story helpful for children keep our
[51:07] parents keep your children away as far
[51:09] as possibly you can or your nieces or
[51:12] nephews keep them as far away from even
[51:14] seeing that as possible now chapter two
[51:18] I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on
[51:20] this
[51:21] I think I'll preach I think bang and bow
[51:24] we're here when I preached a message I
[51:25] call this chapter how to apply Old
[51:27] Testament scripture to the New Testament
[51:29] so before I can prove to everyone or
[51:31] whoever reads this book before I can
[51:33] prove that all these Old Testament
[51:35] Scriptures help us learn how to dress
[51:36] they have to know that you can use Old
[51:38] Testament scripture at times to develop
[51:41] New Testament doctrine so my wife I was
[51:43] talking to wife and she said you know I
[51:44] don't encourage you to put that before
[51:45] you actually teach on clothes I thought
[51:47] okay I like that that's a good idea
[51:49] so I was showing how scripture asks the
[51:51] Old Testament scripture has to be
[51:52] rightly divided like ceremonial laws for
[51:55] the priests are no longer the fact but
[51:57] they're still types and shadows and we
[51:58] can go through laws that are not in
[52:00] effect but there are many more laws that
[52:02] are still in effect
[52:03] there's allegorical truths you know the
[52:05] allegory of the bond the bond son or the
[52:08] I'm sorry the bond woman and the free
[52:09] woman
[52:09] that's the allegory of the law and grace
[52:11] so there's allegories we can learn from
[52:13] and then there's direct direct prophecy
[52:15] from the Old Testament that we must
[52:16] learn from now skipping ahead also
[52:20] there's this principle of you must have
[52:21] two or three witnesses to prety doctrine
[52:24] you can't just pull one scripture you
[52:26] got to have two or three witnesses from
[52:27] the scripture right every word must be
[52:30] established in the mouth of two or three
[52:31] witnesses and then I show how we're not
[52:33] under the law we're not under the law
[52:35] but we must the Bible says we must
[52:37] fulfill the righteousness of the law let
[52:39] me know that Romans 8 for we the laws
[52:43] righteous and through the holy spirit we
[52:45] fulfill the righteousness in other words
[52:47] we do what is holy by the leadership of
[52:49] the Holy Spirit not by our own efforts
[52:51] anymore it's not it's not me it's Christ
[52:55] in me the hope of glory there's no
[52:57] longer Jessie that lives there's no
[52:59] longer Paul that lives it's Christ that
[53:01] lives within me praise God I live by the
[53:03] faith of Jesus Christ
[53:05] and I covered the blanket statements I
[53:07] mentioned that earlier
[53:08] how you can own but I do sure you can
[53:10] make blanket statements like no person
[53:12] was baptized in title sponsor Holy Ghost
[53:14] God never asks one woman to cut her hair
[53:15] I never caught himself three persons God
[53:18] never caught a woman to be apostle the
[53:19] pastas never asked anybody to invite
[53:22] Jesus into their heart
[53:23] all these blanket statements that we can
[53:25] make that are true and then I close the
[53:27] chapter with abominations all these
[53:29] abominations are still abominations in
[53:31] the New Testament there's justifying sin
[53:33] homosexuality idolatry sacrificing
[53:36] children witchcraft cross-dressing
[53:37] worshiping with a wicked heart diverse
[53:40] weights and measure which is extortion
[53:41] and seven abominations of proverbs this
[53:45] is six I preached a whole sermon on that
[53:47] before so I'm gonna skip past that I
[53:48] know to everybody take a deep breath
[53:50] ready wake up I'm sorry if I put you to
[53:52] sleep I don't mean it I'm just trying to
[53:54] show you what I've done and then Jesus
[53:56] said I come to magnify the law so I
[53:58] showed that thought and then I brought
[54:00] the conclusion okay
[54:02] that's chapter two that was five
[54:07] thousand words okay chapter three let's
[54:12] go back to the slideshow so chapter
[54:14] three I just show these things right
[54:16] here there's four guidelines for modest
[54:18] clothing and this was revealed to me as
[54:20] I studied the first one has cover all
[54:22] areas of nakedness and that was remember
[54:24] we divided the human into five parts we
[54:26] must cover from I say the collarbone and
[54:29] shoulders cover down as far as we can go
[54:31] as far as we can go like I told my wife
[54:34] I'm never gonna ask you to wear more
[54:36] modest clothes than what I wear because
[54:39] I gotta be the leader I've got to be the
[54:40] example and I'm always covering my body
[54:43] as much as I can I'm never gonna ask her
[54:45] to do something I'm not willing to do
[54:46] because that might look like a hypocrite
[54:49] so that's applies to me too the second
[54:52] thing is what wear one layer of thick
[54:54] clothing or multiple layers of thinner
[54:56] clothing and this is seen of the coats
[54:59] the coats of Genesis 3:21 what animal
[55:03] did God probably sacrifice who knows
[55:04] would a sheep or a lamb and have you
[55:07] ever seen lamb skin boots they're really
[55:09] thick lansky lamb skin is not thin its
[55:13] thick so if Adam Eve only had one layer
[55:16] on it was a thick layer and you were not
[55:18] as
[55:19] seen their form you know we went out to
[55:20] see their clothes when other words were
[55:22] loose you know they you would not have
[55:23] been able to see the full outline of
[55:25] their body but the but later as we wore
[55:29] as go to the New Testament reading they
[55:31] always had an undergarment and an outer
[55:33] garment and then even a girdle on top of
[55:35] that like a belt they had a belt on top
[55:37] of the outer garment as well so they
[55:39] could gird up the loins and that's what
[55:42] that's what the Almanac says the Almanac
[55:43] says the Jewish women their clothes
[55:45] dragged against the ground and it was so
[55:48] long that when they need to do work or
[55:51] move around they would take the bottom
[55:53] of their robe and tuck it into their
[55:54] girl like that but they were still
[55:57] covering up almost everything that's how
[56:00] long their skirts were that's
[56:03] interesting I thought wow that's really
[56:04] good the third thing is something we all
[56:06] believe gender specific clothing men
[56:08] wear men's clothes women wear women's
[56:10] clothing I got a whole lot more on that
[56:12] I don't have time to show and then the
[56:15] last thing is actually loose and flowing
[56:19] clothing but I just put it like this on
[56:20] the video we need to wear clothes like
[56:22] Jesus's heavenly garments so those are
[56:25] four easy guidelines how many think they
[56:27] could remember those if somebody asked
[56:28] him I think you can remember you can
[56:30] remember four points about this or four
[56:31] points about that you can remember four
[56:33] points about God's clothes or point
[56:35] people to the this chapter let me close
[56:38] with this let's see make sure I got
[56:42] everything that I wanted to do for today
[56:47] okay with the shoulders I want to make
[56:49] sure I say about the shoulders I feel
[56:50] kind of corrected on that because the
[56:52] tunic was a t-shirt like garment so that
[56:55] would have covered a t-shirt of course
[56:56] would cover the shoulders and then the
[57:01] high priests always cover the shoulders
[57:03] they had a robe on and then the ephod
[57:05] the ephod was a special garment on top
[57:08] of their other garment and it literally
[57:10] says to cover the shoulders and memmer
[57:13] they even had to wear breeches so that
[57:15] these big long robes and under that they
[57:17] had to wear shorts that went down to
[57:19] their knees or breeches so when they
[57:20] walked up the ladder or since they
[57:23] ladder the steps to the goat or the
[57:25] brazen altar nobody could see under
[57:27] their skirts I was there under their
[57:29] robes which were called skirts so
[57:32] I'd cover their nakedness here and he
[57:34] also covered any nakedness here that's
[57:36] the point I'm trying to make if he had
[57:39] to cover his loins and up or his thighs
[57:42] enough and his shoulders then we know we
[57:44] should cover that today as well and of
[57:47] course here's another thing there's no
[57:49] scripture that says we can expose our
[57:53] shoulders and if there is please show to
[57:55] me I have not found one there's 75 bible
[57:58] scriptures on shoulders not one of them
[58:00] ever shows a person with their shoulders
[58:02] uncovered and God says that's good
[58:04] there's nothing so there's no witnesses
[58:06] for shoulders being exposed okay just so
[58:09] everybody knows all right okay some of
[58:20] these are pretty important go to
[58:22] Jeremiah 13 22 let's read it hope you're
[58:33] being blessed tonight amen hope you hope
[58:34] it's okay I'm gonna try to finish here
[58:36] like I said maybe go a few minutes over
[58:38] five okay just a few Jeremiah 13 22 now
[58:47] this is interesting we don't believe
[58:49] that you know if a woman shows her heels
[58:52] she's naked but I think in the context
[58:55] of this you'll understand what I'm
[58:56] talking about
[58:57] if thou saying that heart wherefore come
[59:00] these things upon me or the greatness of
[59:02] thy Nick what are thy skirts uncovered
[59:04] and thy heels made bare so some people
[59:08] have said oh if a woman shows her heels
[59:10] its nakedness why don't necessarily
[59:12] believe that but I think what it's
[59:15] saying is that when you uncover the
[59:17] skirt that means to take off it actually
[59:19] means to take off the robe so God was
[59:21] pulling back their shame and so along
[59:23] with that you would see not only the the
[59:26] legs but also the heels down to the
[59:27] heels because the Bible said women must
[59:30] wash each other's feet so it can't be
[59:32] sin to show heels if you're washing
[59:33] somebody's feet because you got to take
[59:35] their shoe off okay so but that's just
[59:38] an interesting scripture I saw one
[59:40] Almanac that said you know some women
[59:42] think they she even cover their heels
[59:43] but we know we can understand what it
[59:46] says
[59:46] we never see God anywhere else asking
[59:48] any one or all of us to cover our heels
[59:51] and also think about Jesus Jesus wash
[59:53] his disciples feet I mean the heels were
[59:55] right there so it's you have to take
[59:57] this in in context
[1:00:00] okay Isaiah 47 let's go there Isaiah 47
[1:00:03] I just want to know that was in the
[1:00:05] Bible that shocked me I've never seen
[1:00:06] that before I was like wow interesting
[1:00:08] but we know it feet washing we'd have to
[1:00:11] show the feet or the heels
[1:00:13] Isaiah 47 this is where we believe we
[1:00:17] this is Bible proof you cannot show your
[1:00:20] thigh you cannot wear a miniskirt and
[1:00:22] show your thigh or wear shorts and show
[1:00:23] your thigh and say you're covered by
[1:00:26] you're covered know when you're soon as
[1:00:29] you show anything above your knees it's
[1:00:30] the nakedness and that's the scripture
[1:00:34] okay the virgin daughter daughter of
[1:00:36] Babylon verse 2 she's under judgment
[1:00:38] take the millstones and grind me I'll
[1:00:40] uncover thy locks make bear thy leg see
[1:00:44] uncover the thigh pass over the rivers
[1:00:47] eye nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy
[1:00:50] shame shall be seen I will take
[1:00:51] vengeance and I would not meet thee as a
[1:00:53] man face of God's bringing judgment upon
[1:00:57] this woman and he says he says you're
[1:00:59] not to make bear the leg and uncover the
[1:01:02] thigh all right does that help by God's
[1:01:05] grace
[1:01:05] anytime you show the thigh and that's
[1:01:08] this is why I feel like we should cover
[1:01:10] much of the leg because the leg is not
[1:01:11] the same as the thigh the leg is from
[1:01:13] the knee down that's the leg so we got
[1:01:17] to be careful how much other leg we show
[1:01:19] like I said if someone what if her
[1:01:20] sister walks in here and her skirt goes
[1:01:23] past her knee praise the Lord but you
[1:01:24] better be careful very careful when you
[1:01:27] sit down or if you bend down in the back
[1:01:29] sometimes it exposes your legs and you
[1:01:31] don't want to cause anybody to stumble
[1:01:33] now I believe this too if you're not
[1:01:36] trying to have caused somebody to
[1:01:37] stumble and you cover yourself let's say
[1:01:39] you cover all the way if a man wants to
[1:01:42] lust after you there's nothing you can
[1:01:43] do but because the Bible says into the
[1:01:45] pure all things are pure if your heart
[1:01:48] is pure it's not on you if somebody
[1:01:50] lusts after you if you covered yourself
[1:01:52] fully because the Bible said God will
[1:01:54] not destroy the righteous with the
[1:01:56] wicked amen
[1:01:57] the heart if you are doing your
[1:02:00] our God will do his part you can't if
[1:02:04] somebody wants a lust they're just going
[1:02:06] to lust but we've got to be careful not
[1:02:09] to give them a asian of stumbling all
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:13] now here's something to uncover thy
[1:02:15] locks the nakedness so there's something
[1:02:20] with hair that I don't even understand
[1:02:22] yet and I'm off to like with broided
[1:02:24] hair I don't understand everything okay
[1:02:27] but I know there was ways that people
[1:02:29] could present their hair if they were
[1:02:30] royalty or if they were rich there's
[1:02:33] ways they could present their hair and
[1:02:36] there would not be godly especially if
[1:02:38] there was a lot of money or time to kind
[1:02:42] of make their hair look fancy in other
[1:02:45] words it was a spirit of pride that's
[1:02:47] what I'm trying to say there's a lot of
[1:02:49] pride involved there and even with the
[1:02:52] issue of a veil I just wanted has ever
[1:02:54] never studied that in the scripture when
[1:02:56] Tamar dressed like a harlot remembering
[1:02:58] what she did she put on a veil which is
[1:03:01] interesting because earlier in the book
[1:03:04] of Genesis Rebecca went to see Isaac and
[1:03:06] when she saw Isaac she put on a veil so
[1:03:09] there must have been some veils that
[1:03:12] pertain to harlots and some veils that
[1:03:13] pertain to virgins I don't know I'm just
[1:03:16] saying we've got to be yeah this is what
[1:03:18] I'm saying - we've got to grow to
[1:03:19] understand some of these things as well
[1:03:20] do I think we're covered now fully yes
[1:03:22] but there's going to be questions come
[1:03:24] up because I get them all the time on
[1:03:26] YouTube there's any questions that we
[1:03:27] don't have answers for so the thing to
[1:03:30] do is just say I don't know we'll take
[1:03:32] it back to the word and we'll rightly
[1:03:33] divide the word okay I just want you to
[1:03:36] know there's even though with the locks
[1:03:37] I don't I don't understand that right
[1:03:39] now but I know the Bible said her hair
[1:03:41] is given her for a covering we know that
[1:03:43] I just don't understand everything yes
[1:03:46] and I don't know if I will understand
[1:03:47] everything ty gets a new body so by the
[1:03:50] God's grace okay so the rest of the
[1:03:53] chapter I devote to the four kinds of
[1:03:56] clothing I'm trying to finish your bear
[1:03:58] with me okay so at the
[1:04:04] just list these clothes are not
[1:04:06] acceptable to God miniskirts women in
[1:04:09] pants sundresses because they're too
[1:04:11] short and they love times they show the
[1:04:14] shoulders high slit skirts low-cut
[1:04:16] dresses shorts short shorts
[1:04:19] skinny jeans halter or tube tops sheer
[1:04:22] blouses and every kind of swimsuit
[1:04:24] almost every kind of swimsuit in bikini
[1:04:26] that make it pretty clear alright last
[1:04:31] thing let me show you these pictures I
[1:04:32] was really really blown away now just so
[1:04:37] you know women have women and men have
[1:04:39] voice had separate garments there's
[1:04:41] George Washington and there's Martha men
[1:04:43] and women always wear suffer garments
[1:04:45] always I can show that next time we
[1:04:47] teach on this I can show all the way
[1:04:49] from I think it's 2,000 BC before Christ
[1:04:52] I can show you pictures or murals men
[1:04:55] and women always dust your dress
[1:04:57] different all the way down to today
[1:04:58] and now today's only time work now we
[1:05:00] can dress however we want no you can't
[1:05:02] its babble its confusion it's a state of
[1:05:06] confusion so see there's always been
[1:05:09] standards and I just pull these up from
[1:05:12] Martha Washington today I made this a
[1:05:14] few years ago
[1:05:15] there's Marcia Washington look how much
[1:05:17] she covered of herself around the 1920s
[1:05:20] the flappers what they do they start
[1:05:22] wearing short skirts they cut their hair
[1:05:23] and start wearing makeup I started
[1:05:25] wearing high heels the 1920s just
[1:05:28] brought such a huge degradation to our
[1:05:30] country it was awful
[1:05:32] and then the seventies brought about
[1:05:34] women and I'm sorry 60s brought about
[1:05:36] women in pants okay
[1:05:43] okay
[1:05:44] oh yeah George and Martha Kent okay now
[1:05:48] the book that I read if you'd like to
[1:05:50] copy this I could buy your copy I think
[1:05:52] it's fantastic it examines modesty
[1:05:55] through the changes in swimwear did you
[1:05:57] know bathing suits started in 350 BC
[1:05:59] with the Greeks and they would they
[1:06:03] would bathe naked but they started with
[1:06:04] costumes then they got to naked and
[1:06:06] maokai and lydia show me this when they
[1:06:07] studied rome when we did world history
[1:06:09] at home they showed me how romans always
[1:06:11] bathe naked all their athletes would
[1:06:13] perform naked can you imagine that look
[1:06:16] at those women the tennis women look at
[1:06:18] the
[1:06:18] track-and-field men and women they're
[1:06:20] almost back to where they started and
[1:06:22] that's where it started in ancient
[1:06:24] Greece and ancient Rome that spirit of
[1:06:27] sports and everything like that and now
[1:06:30] it disappeared for years and then it
[1:06:34] reappeared in the 1700s in England and
[1:06:36] Sicily was the place where they first
[1:06:38] saw bikinis Sicily that's what the
[1:06:41] history says but in the 1800's it
[1:06:43] started getting popular to go to the
[1:06:44] beaches and at first there are strict
[1:06:48] segregation women on this side men on
[1:06:50] this side then that standard came down
[1:06:53] when that center came down they started
[1:06:55] introducing garments for athletic
[1:06:58] movement so they want to be more active
[1:06:59] they want to they want to play games and
[1:07:02] beach volleyball yeah this isn't that
[1:07:04] late 1800s church and then law started
[1:07:07] to change to allow in modesty on beaches
[1:07:10] because if at first it was indecent
[1:07:13] exposure on the beach but then they said
[1:07:15] well if they're exercised and it's okay
[1:07:17] and that's that see the double standard
[1:07:19] their Beach is no longer
[1:07:21] we're considered a place for indecent
[1:07:23] exposure and then from the 1890s is when
[1:07:27] the short the long sleeves for women
[1:07:29] started coming up inch by inch and then
[1:07:31] if you fast-forward 70 years
[1:07:33] it's shortening the sleeves all the way
[1:07:35] to a bikini that barely today barely has
[1:07:38] any material to it now here's the
[1:07:42] picture and this is a the two policemen
[1:07:46] arresting this woman in this woman look
[1:07:48] they got short shorts on that was their
[1:07:49] swimming gear I covered this one because
[1:07:51] it was kind of a bad shot you know kind
[1:07:52] of like on the back side and I thought
[1:07:54] that's the the cop has to physically
[1:07:56] throw her into the paddy wagon for
[1:07:59] indecent exposure she they weren't on
[1:08:02] the beach this is out this is out not on
[1:08:04] the beach so they must I don't know if
[1:08:06] they took it off once they got to the
[1:08:07] beach I don't know but they got arrested
[1:08:09] in 1922 in Chicago it's fact
[1:08:12] for wearing short shorts and I have
[1:08:16] history to where a woman could have been
[1:08:18] killed in the 1600s for wearing pants in
[1:08:21] England she could have been killed the
[1:08:23] death penalty was involved now I don't
[1:08:28] think we should go back to the death
[1:08:29] penalty but I do think we should go back
[1:08:30] to fines
[1:08:32] I do think we should do that and here's
[1:08:35] the last picture of us in our feet and
[1:08:36] then as they started relaxed look now
[1:08:38] she can wear a tank top and now they
[1:08:41] measure this sign was from 30s
[1:08:45] thus the bottom of the the the swimwear
[1:08:48] had to be had to be less than six inches
[1:08:51] from the knee see how they just slowly
[1:08:54] inch by inch and they hired they these
[1:08:57] are these are called beach officials it
[1:09:00] used to be some old man's job to measure
[1:09:02] swimsuits can you believe that as a
[1:09:05] 1930s and think about how the revival
[1:09:09] there's no more revival in America I
[1:09:10] mean look how it happened slowly so
[1:09:13] that's why we've got to watch our lives
[1:09:15] what's it been 50 53 years since the
[1:09:19] Prophet left the scene we've got to
[1:09:21] watch our lives what will it be like if
[1:09:23] God Terry's 70 years after the Prophet
[1:09:26] left the scene what will it be like
[1:09:29] we have transgender homosexual on the
[1:09:32] rise what will it be like in a few more
[1:09:36] years it's shocking to think about it
[1:09:39] it's shocking but as we know we're the
[1:09:44] generation praise God we're the
[1:09:46] generation that lives the Word of God
[1:09:48] were the examples you are the light of
[1:09:51] the world
[1:09:52] praise God hope this was a blessing than
[1:09:55] I did enjoy it I didn't get to
[1:09:57] everything that I mean there they this
[1:09:58] guy goes through the nineteen hundreds
[1:10:00] every ten years he shows how history
[1:10:02] pulls history how they just kept going
[1:10:03] up further and further further and
[1:10:05] further further it's powerful I mean I I
[1:10:07] was just like drawn in this and there's
[1:10:09] so many more things I didn't get to but
[1:10:13] Lord willing we'll get maybes next
[1:10:14] Sunday night so hope you love the Lord
[1:10:16] tonight hope it's a nice refresher like
[1:10:19] I said if you have any questions feel
[1:10:20] free to email me I guess I don't have
[1:10:22] every answer I think as we as we search
[1:10:25] the Scriptures and we apply all these
[1:10:26] rules that we have the rules of in the
[1:10:29] mouth of two or three witnesses the
[1:10:31] rules of rightly dividing the word
[1:10:32] looking for two or three witnesses I
[1:10:34] think as we apply those rules I think
[1:10:35] we'll find that that God His Word is
[1:10:38] true his standard for clothing is
[1:10:41] unchanging Amen I think we'll find that
[1:10:43] standard by God's grace that's just bow
[1:10:45] our heads and
[1:10:45] prayer Heavenly Father thank you for
[1:10:49] this time lord I went a few minutes over
[1:10:51] Lord and thank you Lord that the people
[1:10:53] were patient with me bless them for
[1:10:54] their patience I hope something was said
[1:10:56] tonight that helped them order not thank
[1:10:59] you how you're helping me grow Lord and
[1:11:00] my understanding or as I read through
[1:11:03] these things with the shoulders Lord and
[1:11:05] the history or the shocking history how
[1:11:08] people used to care the majority of
[1:11:11] Americans used to care about modesty

[1:11:16] help us to care about holiness help us
[1:11:19] to care Lord about our our outward
[1:11:22] appearance Lord and everything we do

[1:11:28] our sisters we know our sisters nor
[1:11:30] they're easily noticeable more than men
[1:11:32] dear God but then our brothers have such
[1:11:35] a reverence lord I might say like this a
[1:11:39] sobriety they're so sober they're so
[1:11:42] serious
[1:11:43] they're so aware of your presence
[1:11:46] through dear God that people will see
[1:11:49] this kind of Christian character on us

[1:11:55] character speaks holiness help us Jesus
[1:11:59] tonight Lord help us in our homes Lord
[1:12:03] to keep not as clothing as much as
[1:12:06] possible help these children to as they
[1:12:08] grow to see the truth and have answers
[1:12:11] for their questions the Lord you've
[1:12:13] divided the body in such a way Lord God
[1:12:15] and you bought our bodies so if you
[1:12:18] divide it and tell us to cover that and
[1:12:20] leave it unchanged throughout the entire
[1:12:22] Bible Lord will obey that just like
[1:12:27] Jesus said I love the father we love you
[1:12:30] Father and we're going to keep your
[1:12:32] commands use this Lord God may you give

[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:16:16] one of the important parts like trying
[1:16:18] to close at this all the saints and
[1:16:21] white robes have these robes that Jesus
[1:16:23] have on they go down to their feet so if
[1:16:25] we're gonna spend eternity covering all
[1:16:27] of our body why don't we start right now
[1:16:28] by God's grace I didn't think that's so
[1:16:31] beautiful
[1:16:32] if Jesus dresses modestly if Jesus
[1:16:35] doesn't go around showing off his big
[1:16:36] muscles and his toned thighs then why
[1:16:39] should we we shouldn't
[1:16:41] he's the example and let let it be done
[1:16:44] on earth as it is in heaven
[1:16:46] praise the Lord now how many Muslim
[1:16:48] would know most of all most of us don't
[1:16:50] need help with modest clothing we need
[1:16:52] help with a modest mindset help me not
[1:16:56] to do my will help me to have humility
[1:17:00] help me not to draw attention to myself
[1:17:02] how many would say amen to that
[1:17:04] I appreciate look out if you look around
[1:17:06] everybody's dressed modestly oh it's so
[1:17:08] fantastic I love it praise God I love
[1:17:11] coming here because I know my eyes are
[1:17:12] gonna be safe hey I just love it thank
[1:17:15] God for that but I think if we're honest
[1:17:17] as we go let's just pray this lord help
[1:17:19] me to have a modest spirit which means
[1:17:23] we think little of ourselves
[1:17:25] right and we don't draw attention to
[1:17:27] ourselves we only point others to Jesus
[1:17:29] Christ let's pray that as we go how many
[1:17:32] would say pray for me brother Jes for
[1:17:33] that that's my prayer father in heaven
[1:17:36] as were dismissed we're grateful bless
[1:17:38] your people for their hunger for the
[1:17:40] word their dedication to the word oh I
[1:17:42] love it Lord I'm so blessed to see their
[1:17:44] souls love your word I could never get
[1:17:50] enough of your word your God it's so
[1:17:52] glorious has changed my life
[1:17:56] delivered me from pornography when the
[1:17:59] other churches couldn't do it because
[1:18:00] they were preaching the word of the hour
[1:18:02] thank you lord
[1:18:04] I can see how my life was tainted by the
[1:18:10] spirit of lust through an honest evil
[1:18:13] Lord
[1:18:14] Yury need me you brought me back and now
[1:18:17] Lord you're using me and my wife and my
[1:18:19] children as vessels examples of Jesus I
[1:18:28] don't want to come before you naked
[1:18:30] physically or spiritually in orders we
[1:18:37] are closing your father as I said you
[1:18:39] saw the hands Bob give us honesty in our
[1:18:42] spirits which is not thinking very much
[1:18:47] of ourselves when we think about our
[1:18:53] brothers and sisters within ourselves we
[1:18:57] think about our neighbor or than we
[1:18:59] think about ourselves we think about
[1:19:01] Christ so much we just want to obey
[1:19:04] everything he says we want to pray all
[1:19:06] the time talk to Jesus give us that kind
[1:19:10] of hosting
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:15] in greater rided upon our souls right
[1:19:18] now Jesus right that meek and quiet
[1:19:22] spirit for our sisters and that strong
[1:19:24] loving leadership of brothers ride it
[1:19:27] upon our hearts are fresh let us grow in
[1:19:30] these areas more than character thinking
[1:19:43] that we can all grow together we can all
[1:19:46] learn together
[1:19:47] pray for strength from this week should
[1:19:49] you tarry to protect us and I divine
[1:19:52] nail-scarred and protect us Lord because
[1:19:56] we're in the palm Jesus Christ
[1:19:59] [Music]
