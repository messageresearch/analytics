[4:27] amen god bless you as being seated
[4:28] praise god
[4:31] so have your bibles ready i want to look
[4:33] at
[4:34] i'm just going to be preaching a little
[4:35] bit out of the chapter i don't know has
[4:36] anybody read chapter one out of the book
[4:38] it's okay if you haven't that's why i've
[4:40] been preaching it you know but if you
[4:42] haven't read chapter one it's just on
[4:43] the godhead and i'm slowly going through
[4:45] this but let's have your bibles ready
[4:47] uh church we kind of looked at all the
[4:49] eight eight reasons we could have said
[4:51] nine right we could have said nine
[4:52] reasons why
[4:54] uh the trinity is a false doctrine and
[4:57] it's a uh it's leaven from
[5:00] uh from the miserable woman right the
[5:02] evil woman who hid leaven in god's uh
[5:04] unleavened bread we'd say then it became
[5:06] leavened the whole thing was impacted by
[5:09] the leaven
[5:10] of the lie of the devil he changed who
[5:13] god was and ultimately church we know
[5:15] that breaks the first commandment right
[5:17] as soon as you touch god as soon as you
[5:19] start talking about god and you change
[5:21] it you break the first commandment then
[5:24] you know gets in the second commandment
[5:25] and third commandment those first three
[5:27] about god
[5:28] and so we want no other gods before us
[5:30] we don't want to speak anything evil in
[5:31] the name of the lord we want to honor
[5:32] the hollow name of jesus
[5:34] remember they did that awful threefold
[5:36] blasphemy remember they changed his name
[5:39] they blasphemed his name the saints in
[5:41] heaven
[5:42] and uh the eternal city they blasphemed
[5:44] all three of those of course through the
[5:46] roman catholic church
[5:47] uh so let's be thankful that we know god
[5:50] in truth how many can be thankful for
[5:51] that tonight
[5:52] what a blessing to know god so after
[5:54] this section in the book where i went
[5:56] through the eight reasons why the
[5:57] trinity's wrong then i show
[5:59] how it is clearly taught in the bible
[6:02] and the first part is that god manifests
[6:04] himself in three ways
[6:06] that's the key word manifest
[6:08] or form those are the two words the
[6:10] bible uses manifest or form he changes
[6:13] manifestation or he changes forms we've
[6:16] got some readers back there haven't you
[6:18] ready to lydia acacia maokai all right
[6:20] sure would you like to read sister would
[6:21] that be okay all right thank you
[6:24] i appreciate that usually i just you
[6:25] know pick up the kids but jose can you
[6:27] read tonight brother
[6:30] okay
[6:31] no it's okay
[6:33] i appreciate brother
[6:35] thank you sir
[6:37] so
[6:38] that's god's plan now god has many
[6:40] manifestations but in redeeming mankind
[6:43] he uses father son holy ghost because
[6:45] that's the name that is baptized right
[6:47] jesus said baptize them
[6:48] in the name so we're to be immersed
[6:51] or we're to be uh publicly identified in
[6:53] these three manifestations so three of
[6:55] the manifestations are crucial for
[6:57] redemption
[6:58] right you man can't be redeemed without
[7:00] a father in heaven without a god with us
[7:04] right and then without a god in us man
[7:06] can't fully be redeemed and brought back
[7:09] to the original condition like he was in
[7:12] eden praise god we need all three of
[7:14] those amen and so that's what we got by
[7:16] the grace of the lord so the bible says
[7:18] he manifests
[7:20] uh
[7:21] at least 11 times the word manifest is
[7:24] used in connection to jesus so we're
[7:26] going through all them through all 11 of
[7:28] them tonight because i don't know if
[7:29] you'll do it if you read the book or not
[7:32] okay so i want to make sure i teach it
[7:34] especially for our young ones they need
[7:35] to know this truth so that nothing can
[7:38] shake them right if they get a
[7:39] revelation not for me tonight if they
[7:41] get a revelation from the father tonight
[7:43] the gates of hell will never take it
[7:44] over them right they'll never be
[7:46] overtaken by the gates of hell
[7:48] man flesh and blood cannot give a
[7:50] revelation but as the children meditate
[7:52] on the word as even adults meditate on
[7:54] the word god will quicken that thought
[7:56] to us it'll be revealed to us it'll be
[7:58] made known and then god gets all the
[8:00] credit i don't get any credit god gets
[8:02] all the credit
[8:03] amen because i can't say well you're
[8:05] going to leave with this revelation i
[8:06] can't say that it's whatever god is
[8:08] willing to drop in our hearts tonight
[8:10] praise god and you never know when it's
[8:12] going to be that moment praise god
[8:14] so let's uh get your bibles here
[8:17] in case she's going to do oh yeah we
[8:18] never read our text do we
[8:20] oh that's a
[8:21] you have to forgive me i'm really tired
[8:23] i got up at 3 30 this morning i couldn't
[8:24] go back to bed so i'm just exhausted
[8:26] today
[8:27] so let's yeah let's let me read the text
[8:29] that their hearts might be comforted
[8:31] being knit together in love and unto all
[8:32] the riches of the full assurance of
[8:33] understanding to acknowledgement of the
[8:35] mystery of god and of the father and of
[8:37] christ okay so we acknowledge the
[8:39] mystery
[8:40] okay why don't we stand though for the
[8:42] reading of the word right did so we
[8:44] didn't read the word we're standing okay
[8:46] so let's stand and let's just read john
[8:48] 1 31 you pull it up there john 1 31
[8:52] let's go through all 11 times
[8:54] we'll just stand for the first one
[9:02] john 1 31. let's all read that together
[9:05] ready one two three and i knew him not
[9:08] but that he should be manifest to israel
[9:12] therefore am i come baptizing with water
[9:15] may god has blessed the reading of his
[9:17] word you may be seated here
[9:19] sorry i got my little order mixed up
[9:21] here
[9:23] i survived the first day at work with
[9:24] the children so that's good i survived
[9:26] so i say praise the lord for that
[9:29] so here's the first one
[9:31] uh
[9:32] john didn't know him right but he was
[9:34] manifest to israel
[9:37] all right so the manifestation that he
[9:39] christ should be manifest to israel john
[9:42] came baptizing with water in other words
[9:44] god sent a forerunner before the first
[9:47] coming of christ and we know god sent a
[9:49] forerunner named william branham to
[9:51] foreign the second coming of jesus
[9:53] christ
[9:54] both men have the spirit of elijah
[9:56] brother jose i got a video remind me i
[9:57] got a video to share with you about uh
[9:59] the cloud
[10:00] there's a brother down in south carolina
[10:02] that preached it it is the most
[10:04] phenomenal sermon i've heard on the
[10:05] cloud he starts with science and shows
[10:07] all there's three sermons on it
[10:09] it's it's tremendous so i gotta share
[10:11] with you remind me afterwards
[10:13] uh but and again god vindicating brother
[10:16] branham god vindicated brother branham
[10:18] no science can put that cloud
[10:20] that many miles high in the sky it was
[10:22] just it was it was not science it wasn't
[10:24] a thor rocket it's impossible it was god
[10:28] god forming that cloud to vindicate thus
[10:31] saith the lord
[10:33] that thus saith the lord was on the way
[10:35] praise god jesus had to descend in a
[10:36] cloud right the mighty angel come down
[10:38] clothed with the cloud
[10:40] oh hallelujah just it's just a refresher
[10:43] about
[10:44] how how powerfully we've been visited by
[10:47] the holy spirit in this hour amen all
[10:50] right so john 14 21 saints
[10:54] here's number two
[10:57] all right so olivia can you read that
[10:58] you got that john 14
[11:12] 21. wow so jesus is going to come
[11:15] manifest himself to anyone right that
[11:18] love him
[11:19] he will show himself so church you don't
[11:21] have to worry about the pressure's not
[11:22] on you all the time right god can use us
[11:24] to love people but really if someone
[11:26] really loves jesus christ jesus christ
[11:28] will come and make himself known to them
[11:31] amen
[11:32] okay next uh malachi why don't you get
[11:34] uh john 17 6.
[11:36] let's just flip through these you'll see
[11:38] it it's a beautiful beautiful subject go
[11:40] ahead okay
[11:51] amen now look at that church this is at
[11:52] the end of jesus life and he tells the
[11:54] father i've manifested thy name to them
[11:58] and what did these disciples do that
[11:59] we're doing too we're keeping the word
[12:01] i'm going to keep in the word tonight
[12:03] amen you're in the house of god you're
[12:05] believing the word of god you are
[12:06] keeping the word praise god see and so
[12:08] that's who jesus disciples are that's
[12:10] who jesus manifests himself to those
[12:13] that keep the word
[12:14] okay next acacia can you get uh
[12:17] first corinthians 12 7. now this also is
[12:20] with the holy ghost
[12:21] being a manifestation of god
[12:31] yes this actually doesn't refer to jesus
[12:33] right this refers to the holy ghost in
[12:34] believer so i actually put that in the
[12:37] wrong place in the book so that's kind
[12:38] of a little simple mistake there but i
[12:40] think the people will see that it's a
[12:42] manifestation
[12:43] of the holy spirit oh no i'm sorry i
[12:45] wrote it's 11 times it refers
[12:48] oh no i made a mistake yeah it's 11
[12:49] times in connection to jesus this is
[12:51] really to the holy ghost see i did make
[12:52] a mistake there but so church so you can
[12:55] see when the holy ghost does something
[12:57] through our lives whether it's
[12:58] witnessing or miracle
[13:00] or repentance any manifestation
[13:04] it's god showing himself that he's in
[13:06] our lives so that's why we rejoice when
[13:08] someone put the testimony up here that
[13:10] someone got healed or saved or delivered
[13:13] or god answered some prayer that's why
[13:15] we rejoice church it's further proof
[13:17] that these signs follow them that
[13:19] believe praise god see it's jesus it's
[13:22] god manifesting and you and i
[13:24] he shows up god appears in us that's why
[13:27] the children want to grow up and they
[13:28] want to seek after god and god will do
[13:30] works in their lives great works
[13:32] right healing or deliverance or miracles
[13:35] or
[13:36] wisdom or knowledge all these great
[13:38] things that can flow
[13:40] as we yield ourselves to god that proves
[13:42] the holy spirit's manifesting or
[13:44] appearing in your life amen amen thank
[13:48] god all right go to first timothy 3 16
[13:51] we're familiar with this one we could
[13:52] probably quote this but great is the
[13:54] mystery of
[13:56] godliness god was manifest in the
[13:59] flesh justified in the look how fast you
[14:02] are scene of angels preached unto the
[14:04] gentiles believed on the world and
[14:06] received up into glory
[14:10] all right
[14:11] now this is quite the scripture because
[14:13] brother graham says this is godliness
[14:15] restored to man so this scripture is all
[14:17] about jesus what does this have to do
[14:19] with godliness being restored to man it
[14:22] could only be restored to man through
[14:24] the death and resurrection of jesus
[14:27] that's what that is right because we see
[14:29] he was justifying the spirit scene of
[14:31] angels preaching the gentiles and recede
[14:33] up into glory
[14:35] so in other words the holy ghost
[14:36] couldn't be sent
[14:38] until jesus was glorified amen that's
[14:40] what john 7 says so this is beautiful
[14:43] how it connects to uh
[14:45] the statue of a perfect man jesus christ
[14:47] slowly anointing us with more and more
[14:49] anointing restoring godliness to man but
[14:53] it could only happen through jesus
[14:54] christ dying
[14:56] being buried and resurrecting and
[14:58] ascending to heaven thank god he's
[15:00] restoring godliness in our lives amen
[15:03] hallelujah next one second timothy 1 10.
[15:08] i'd love to hear those bible pages
[15:09] turning ii timothy 1 10.
[15:14] sister who would you want to read that
[15:14] when you get that
[15:16] thank you
[15:17] but it's not made manifest by the
[15:20] appearing of our savior jesus christ who
[15:22] has abolished the death and have brought
[15:24] life and
[15:27] amen praise god
[15:29] so this holy calling in christ jesus now
[15:32] manifests by the appearing of our savior
[15:34] jesus christ
[15:35] okay now paul was writing that he's
[15:37] saying by manifest by the appearing so
[15:39] he means when jesus was most recently at
[15:41] his first coming right that's what he
[15:43] means so again a manifestation by jesus
[15:46] christ we know the holy calling because
[15:48] jesus was manifest he showed himself he
[15:52] appeared to us so in the very beautiful
[15:54] scripture there and he brought it life
[15:56] and immortality to light through the
[15:58] gospel the good news how do you believe
[16:01] our church is all about good news
[16:03] amen but to tell the the good news we
[16:05] got to tell the bad news first right the
[16:07] destruction of america the destruction
[16:08] of the world the mark of the beast but
[16:10] after hearing all that the false church
[16:12] then we can tell you that there's a real
[16:14] church praise god there's real victory
[16:16] there's healing there's deliverance
[16:18] there's power in the name of jesus
[16:20] christ
[16:21] the good news amen you don't have to
[16:23] live in a dead old church you can come
[16:24] and be alive in christ jesus today like
[16:27] brother mj can recognize right we get
[16:29] all these new people in there and they
[16:31] if they're honest they can recognize
[16:33] there's something different it's the
[16:34] word of god it's the presence of the
[16:36] holy ghost praise god like we saw on
[16:38] saturday night right with our visitors
[16:40] many of them coming up for prayer
[16:41] weren't that beautiful just to recognize
[16:43] the presence of the holy ghost praise
[16:44] god hallelujah that's what's here
[16:46] tonight it's even here tonight the
[16:48] presence of jesus christ amen
[16:50] all right first peter 1 20.
[16:55] first peter 1 20. let's get haven you
[16:57] can read off the screen hon would that
[16:58] be okay
[17:00] thank you
[17:10] great job david i kind of feel like it's
[17:12] a bible study
[17:13] i want to cheer for you so look paul or
[17:16] peter calls this the last times
[17:18] now times must mean the last 2 000 years
[17:20] right
[17:21] so he or maybe he was just thinking of
[17:24] his his own human flesh that those were
[17:26] the last times there were no doubt last
[17:28] times for that generation
[17:30] they weren't going to live very long
[17:31] right but we can see jesus was
[17:34] manifested in these last times for you
[17:36] praise god okay first john 1 verse 2.
[17:42] i've been reading through this book this
[17:44] week this is just a power packed
[17:46] this is a revelation-packed book
[17:48] especially chapter three
[17:50] you got kane there is of the wicked one
[17:53] um
[17:54] and then you got no murder has eternal
[17:56] life i mean you have some just a major
[17:59] uh doctrine clinching scriptures in
[18:01] there just laying the uh putting the
[18:03] nail in all the way right putting the
[18:06] nail through and just
[18:07] solving the problem right solving the
[18:09] issue just with scriptures right there
[18:11] first john 1 verse 2
[18:13] for the life the life was manifested and
[18:15] we have seen it okay so who saw it john
[18:17] saw john saw the life of god manifested
[18:20] in a man
[18:22] and bear witness and show unto you that
[18:24] eternal life which was with the father
[18:26] and was manifested unto us can you
[18:28] imagine that when they touched jesus
[18:30] they were touching eternal life on the
[18:32] inside
[18:33] right the body wasn't didn't have
[18:35] eternal life yet but they were touching
[18:37] eternal life's form
[18:39] right they were touching eternal life
[18:41] manifestation can you imagine touching
[18:42] that and the fullness of eternal life
[18:44] was in that man
[18:45] what a what a privilege what an honor
[18:48] we've not only touched it we've seen it
[18:50] and then he says later he says we've
[18:52] handled it with our own hands
[18:55] a wha what uh what an experience no
[18:57] wonder church no wonder that these men
[18:59] will be right around the throne of jesus
[19:02] because they had the privilege
[19:03] to live and die for jesus all except
[19:07] john right all except john they died as
[19:09] martyrs but they got to handle eternal
[19:12] life
[19:13] do you think they care that all their
[19:15] mistakes are in the in the gospels do
[19:17] you think peter cared that his denials
[19:19] were in there no because later he got
[19:21] the holy ghost praise god and then it
[19:23] wiped all that away then he got power to
[19:25] overcome praise god and church he got to
[19:28] handle eternal life in a man
[19:31] hallelujah with he's handled with his
[19:33] own hands
[19:35] okay first john 3 verse 5. so chapter 3
[19:39] verse 5.
[19:41] let's go back if we can to malachi first
[19:43] john 3 5. that'd be okay man okay
[19:53] amen wonderful so why was he shown why
[19:56] did he appear why was he manifested to
[19:59] take away your sin you ought to say
[20:00] praise the lord amen praise the lord
[20:03] amen
[20:04] he he appeared to get rid of my sin
[20:07] that's part of the reason he came praise
[20:08] god was to set us free from our sin
[20:11] problem amen
[20:13] hallelujah chapter three verse eight
[20:15] lydia can get that three verse eight uh
[20:17] this is a beautiful scripture
[20:28] all right so see he destroyed satan's
[20:30] works he took away all your sin that's
[20:33] why he appeared
[20:34] to defeat satan and to set you free amen
[20:38] all right first john 4 9
[20:41] last one and do you believe that we've
[20:43] already gone over all 11. that fast
[20:45] first john 4 9. but see the bible uses
[20:48] it over and over and that's a revelation
[20:49] the holy spirit showed me that's the key
[20:51] word manifest or form all the time god
[20:54] uses it all the time in connection to
[20:56] jesus christ
[20:57] first john 4 9 sister who would you like
[20:59] to read that that'd be okay thank
[21:07] amen
[21:09] amen praise god that was god's love
[21:12] manifested with jesus christ
[21:14] and we live through him
[21:16] how many living through the words in
[21:18] this book here tonight i'm thankful for
[21:19] the red letters i thank god for the red
[21:21] letters amen
[21:22] see we're living through him through his
[21:25] word right because his body's not here
[21:27] thank god his spirits here praise god
[21:30] his spirit is here to back up the word
[21:31] hallelujah
[21:33] okay so church you've been you've seen
[21:35] all 11 or 10 verses that call 10 verses
[21:39] that call jesus the manifestation of god
[21:42] all right there's 11. now the next one
[21:44] is a different word the word form so can
[21:47] you pull up philippians 2 6 acacia
[21:49] philippians 2 6. this word in the greek
[21:52] form means the form by which a person or
[21:54] thing strikes the vision
[21:56] the external appearance
[21:59] all right so jesus came in the
[22:01] manifestation of god or we could say he
[22:03] came as the form of god the external
[22:05] appearance who being in the external
[22:08] appearance of god thought it not robbery
[22:10] to be equal with god
[22:13] okay now church just i'm going to put
[22:15] something in here i don't consider
[22:16] myself equal with god
[22:18] okay i have a i have a portion of
[22:20] eternal life in my soul that's equal
[22:22] with god but i don't have i'm not equal
[22:25] with god in the mind or the flesh and
[22:27] even the soul either because remember
[22:29] jesus had the holy ghost without measure
[22:31] but the bible says we have the holy
[22:33] ghost with measure
[22:35] so even the eternal life inside of us
[22:37] isn't as much we'd say power or as or
[22:40] authority as jesus's holy ghost measure
[22:42] amen praise god so we got to be real
[22:45] careful with that scripture
[22:46] right don't don't ever think well i'm
[22:48] equal with god i'm god no you're not
[22:50] you're a manifestation you're a uh
[22:53] you're an offspring of god you're a
[22:55] child of god but you're not god
[22:58] praise god a lot of churches get into
[22:59] trouble with that one with this
[23:01] scripture well i'm equal with god why
[23:03] can't i speak it well you can't always
[23:05] do that recently i've seen churches try
[23:07] to do that they tried to speak healing
[23:09] and then people have died in their
[23:10] church
[23:11] i mean maybe i'll tell a story once the
[23:13] live stream is over but people that we
[23:15] love and people that we know
[23:16] they just try to speak speak speak
[23:18] and then it don't come to pass well why
[23:20] is that because they're not equal with
[23:22] god
[23:23] they they should have stopped and said
[23:25] lord is it your will to heal the person
[23:28] now it's okay brother man says okay just
[23:30] to speak the word all the time
[23:32] but church it may not work out the way
[23:34] we're speaking because we don't know the
[23:36] ultimate will of god
[23:38] right you can speak it all you want you
[23:40] can speak anything all you want
[23:42] but you're not god and that doesn't mean
[23:44] it's going to come to pass so it's best
[23:46] to wait until you know it's god doing it
[23:48] praise god it's best to hope in god and
[23:50] hope in the mercy of god and speak what
[23:53] you want to happen but always say if the
[23:55] lord is willing
[23:57] or if it be the will of the lord does
[23:59] that make sense
[24:00] all right i want you to know that
[24:01] because we like i said i know i love
[24:03] beautiful people i love quoting you know
[24:05] speaking the word but then it don't come
[24:07] to pass
[24:08] okay
[24:10] so we just want to be aware of that and
[24:11] even i'm sure i'm sure i've done the
[24:13] same thing i'm sure i've spoken
[24:14] something and it didn't happen
[24:16] but as long as i didn't say thus saith
[24:17] the lord i'm fine
[24:19] right i was just speaking hope
[24:21] okay and of course you and i wouldn't
[24:23] speak in the in the name of the lord
[24:25] unless we absolutely knew it was going
[24:26] to happen
[24:27] okay
[24:29] all right so god father son holy ghost
[24:31] god manifesting god manifests as a
[24:33] father right son
[24:35] and holy ghost
[24:37] all right so let's look at a few of
[24:39] these here by the grace of the lord
[24:41] so three manifestations don't make three
[24:45] persons
[24:46] okay because this today i was manifested
[24:49] as teacher at school brother jose now
[24:51] manifested as pastor and brother
[24:53] and friend
[24:55] but i'm not the pastor to the kids at
[24:56] school
[24:58] that's a different manifestation
[25:00] right that doesn't so those three
[25:02] manifestations teacher pastor friend
[25:05] that don't make three persons
[25:06] i'm still the same person right that's
[25:08] pretty simple for us to understand right
[25:11] so we must understand god we must use
[25:14] god's words and god's words are manifest
[25:17] and form
[25:18] those are god's words okay
[25:22] all right so god
[25:24] manifests as a father when he created us
[25:27] and then he puts that knowledge inside
[25:29] of us
[25:30] that's malachi 2 10. can you put malachi
[25:32] 210 in case you can read that for us
[25:34] malachi 2 10.
[25:38] church the bible says the father created
[25:40] you and then the bible said the father
[25:42] created all things by jesus christ so
[25:44] the father was the invisible spirit and
[25:47] jesus christ was the word at the
[25:48] beginning
[25:49] all right so casey go ahead
[26:02] all right great job everybody look up
[26:03] there see the father
[26:05] father create us one god one father so
[26:08] god above us manifested himself through
[26:11] creation so church every time we look
[26:13] outside and see the beautiful sunsets
[26:14] and the the moon the last few days it's
[26:16] coming up to a full moon pretty soon i
[26:18] think
[26:18] it's the it's we're seeing the father
[26:20] manifested right
[26:22] because the bible said the father
[26:23] created us
[26:25] the father did this the invisible spirit
[26:28] but he did it through the word through
[26:30] his son amen
[26:32] all right
[26:33] so that's how god is manifested to us
[26:36] remember the bible said in romans 1 and
[26:38] 2
[26:39] that there will be no excuse on the day
[26:41] of judgment because of creation and god
[26:43] manifesting himself in here and i
[26:45] thought of the third thing the soul
[26:46] thirst
[26:48] so there's three reasons no men are
[26:49] without excuse everybody has a holy
[26:51] thirst for god
[26:53] right everybody can see god that created
[26:55] you all these nerves and and cells and
[26:58] trillions of cells everybody can see god
[27:00] did this god put a conscience in you
[27:01] right that's part of it and also all the
[27:04] beautiful creation outside which we
[27:06] ought to be thankful for this beautiful
[27:07] weather today praise god
[27:08] all right so those three so there's
[27:10] three mouth of two or three witnesses
[27:12] let every word be established there'll
[27:14] be no excuses on the day of judgment for
[27:16] any person in any country and any any uh
[27:18] uh any space in the entire world any
[27:22] continent right
[27:23] there without excuse because god showed
[27:25] them his power praise god and they all
[27:27] thirst for god
[27:30] all right so that means church said that
[27:32] just means like a heathen aborigine or
[27:34] someone who never they always lived in
[27:36] the wilderness that means every one of
[27:38] them has a thirst to leave that jungle
[27:40] to go find god
[27:42] do you hear me
[27:44] if they have a holy thirst and there's
[27:45] nothing holy around them then that means
[27:47] all of them want to leave their their
[27:49] primitive
[27:51] uh jungle life and they want to go find
[27:53] god but they either got to turn that
[27:55] they either got to satisfy that holy
[27:56] thirst or they got to hush that holy
[27:58] thirst aren't you glad church that god
[28:00] put that inside everybody that wants to
[28:02] know god
[28:03] can know god and if they if they if they
[28:05] don't leave and they still want to know
[28:06] god they can see jesus in a dream praise
[28:09] god hallelujah he'll come to them in a
[28:11] dream he'll manifest himself because he
[28:13] cannot be limited he cannot be stopped
[28:16] amen
[28:17] his eyes search the world looking for
[28:19] someone he can show himself powerful in
[28:21] praise god
[28:23] see even if they won't leave the jungle
[28:25] god jesus will still come to them
[28:27] because there's no excuses there's
[28:28] always a holy thirst in every person
[28:31] okay so that's how the father's
[28:33] manifested the son is manifested as we
[28:35] already read god manifests in the flesh
[28:38] in first timothy 3 16.
[28:42] remember god could not die in the spirit
[28:45] form so god had to be manifest or appear
[28:49] in flesh and jesus christ died he paid
[28:53] the price
[28:54] remission of sins only comes through the
[28:56] blood hallelujah
[29:00] and to do this god sent himself a once
[29:02] for all sin sacrifice that's in hebrews
[29:06] 10 10. you believe hebrews 10 10
[29:08] in other words church god only needed
[29:10] one sacrifice god was so perfect so
[29:12] strong he didn't need a thousand
[29:15] sacrifices or even ten sacrifices he
[29:17] just needed one sacrifice and that was
[29:20] the perfect sacrifice
[29:22] by the which we will i'm sorry which
[29:25] will we are sanctified through the
[29:26] offering of the body of jesus christ
[29:29] once and for all praise god
[29:32] see we're sanctified that means we're
[29:34] set apart by one offering believing in
[29:36] that one offering sanctifies us in other
[29:39] words it sets us apart i don't i don't
[29:41] think that's referring to the second
[29:42] work of grace i think that's just
[29:44] referring to that sacrifice when you
[29:46] believe in it it separates you from the
[29:48] world it separates you totally far apart
[29:51] from anything like that because now
[29:53] you're a believer now you got the
[29:55] anointing on you now you've got the love
[29:57] of jesus christ on you now you thirst
[29:59] for holiness praise god
[30:01] amen through one sacrifice
[30:04] god in flesh
[30:06] and that's what he's called he's called
[30:07] immanuel pull up matthew 1 23. what do
[30:10] you call this god or what do you call
[30:11] this manifestation emmanuel not a second
[30:14] person with us but church it's god with
[30:17] us
[30:19] uh
[30:20] matthew 1
[30:21] a virgin shall conceive well bring forth
[30:23] the son they shall call his name
[30:25] emmanuel which being interpreted as
[30:27] second person with us did i read that
[30:29] right can you believe these people do
[30:31] that brother jose we laugh don't we how
[30:33] can they it ain't a second person it's
[30:36] god with us amen
[30:38] god just changed his mask i think i left
[30:39] a mask in my room i should have break
[30:41] out those masks from the other the bible
[30:43] study the other night god just changed
[30:45] his mass god put on a mask and come down
[30:47] and lived in his creative son and it's
[30:51] his only begotten son there'll never be
[30:53] another son like that one amen
[30:56] there'll never be another a holy sinless
[30:58] son like that one that will die on the
[31:00] cross he was the one and only the only
[31:03] begotten son of the father
[31:05] and you know one of those preachers one
[31:07] of those prosperity preachers remember i
[31:08] preached on false prophets in the winter
[31:10] time did you know some of them i'll just
[31:12] name it remember paula white
[31:14] she had a preacher come on her show and
[31:16] said that jesus wasn't the only begotten
[31:19] sons because we're begotten and she just
[31:21] sat there and said amen can you imagine
[31:23] that's like having no wisdom that's like
[31:25] having no discernment the bible said
[31:28] jesus was the only begotten of the
[31:29] father in other words the only virgin
[31:32] born son that was taken to the cross to
[31:35] pay the penalty for our sins and raise
[31:37] with our forgiveness fully purchased
[31:40] amen
[31:42] but a false prophetess like her who
[31:44] pretends to speak in tongues and
[31:45] pretends to send angels from from africa
[31:48] and south america to america and win the
[31:51] election for trump which it failed
[31:53] right the very same person does that
[31:55] says oh yeah jesus isn't the only
[31:57] begotten word begotten too that's a lie
[32:00] see the holy spirit will always pick up
[32:01] that lie thank god that we can discern
[32:04] truth and we can judge the right
[32:05] teaching
[32:07] amen
[32:10] so god above us god with us and now it's
[32:13] god in us
[32:14] as we already read first corinthians 12
[32:16] 7 this manifestation of the spirit is
[32:19] given to every man every believer to
[32:22] profit with all
[32:24] all right
[32:25] so that's that's really uh the most
[32:27] important scripture there first
[32:28] corinthians 12 7 the holy ghost is god
[32:31] appearing in us
[32:36] all right
[32:39] remember the holy ghost is literally god
[32:41] the father not a third person he's
[32:44] literally the same person the holy ghost
[32:46] and god the father are one and the same
[32:51] all right
[32:52] now go to uh if you've got your bible go
[32:55] to joel 2 27.
[32:57] i want you to see this this was a good
[32:58] thought that i put in the book as well
[33:00] that the i felt like the lord just just
[33:02] a simple little thought joel 2 27 28 29
[33:06] i'm not going to read the whole thing
[33:07] but look on the day of
[33:09] pentecost what spirit did god promise to
[33:12] send the third person
[33:17] okay go to 28
[33:21] yes
[33:23] okay so let's look at joel 2 28. does
[33:25] god say i'm in a poll i'm going to pour
[33:27] out a third person spirit now remember
[33:30] if the trinity's right these are
[33:31] separate persons that means they have
[33:33] separate spirits
[33:34] right the father is a separate
[33:36] personality jesus has a separate
[33:38] personality the holy ghost has a
[33:39] separate personality
[33:41] now the catholics will say the third
[33:42] person was poured out on the day of
[33:44] pentecost right but what jesus or what
[33:47] does the bible say the bible says it
[33:48] should come to pass i'll pour out my
[33:51] spirit upon all flesh
[33:53] praise god not a third person spirit
[33:55] but my spirit and remember jesus kept
[33:58] calling this holy spirit the promise of
[34:00] my father
[34:02] the promise of my father
[34:05] and then paul said in first or second
[34:07] corinthians 6
[34:09] he said god has said i will dwell in
[34:11] them i will walk in them i will receive
[34:13] them and i'll be a father unto them so
[34:17] god said i'm pouring out my spirit and
[34:19] then god said i will walk in them not a
[34:21] second person not a third person i
[34:24] myself the one person will walk in them
[34:26] church we are on the right side today
[34:28] praise god we are on the side of the
[34:30] bible today we don't add any words when
[34:33] the bible said god lives in us that's
[34:35] what we say god lives in us
[34:37] not a second person not a third person
[34:39] the one person of god lives in our souls
[34:42] amen if we're born again if not prove me
[34:45] show me a scripture where it says a
[34:47] third person lives inside of me you'll
[34:49] never find it trust me church you don't
[34:50] have to do it
[34:51] i want you to read your bible but you
[34:52] have to go searching for i've already
[34:54] done the searching for you the bible
[34:55] never says a third person lives inside
[34:57] of you the bible never says the second
[34:59] person lives inside of you the bible
[35:01] said god the father will live in you
[35:03] talk in you walk in you flow through you
[35:06] and anoint you it's the one person of
[35:08] god living inside of you
[35:10] amen
[35:12] now you can search all you want but i'm
[35:13] telling you you don't have to you're
[35:14] never going to find three persons in
[35:15] there
[35:17] thank god
[35:18] see church our our faith is rock solid
[35:21] jose knows that all the time he's been
[35:22] the message all the time we've been in
[35:24] the message this is rock solid nobody
[35:26] can even come close
[35:28] the only thing they can say
[35:30] is what we'll do probably next wednesday
[35:32] night because i want to go through uh
[35:35] the only thing they can say is well let
[35:37] us make man in our image and
[35:39] we're going to make our bow the plural
[35:41] pronouns that's all they can say well
[35:43] see
[35:44] that has to be three persons no it
[35:46] doesn't
[35:48] you cannot limit god
[35:50] right
[35:51] you cannot say well let us us
[35:54] it has to be
[35:56] two persons there no it doesn't
[35:58] that's with your human pee brain
[36:01] understanding right which we all have
[36:03] pea brains without the revelation of god
[36:05] right we're all tiny brain we're we're
[36:07] all just human we all fall short i
[36:09] forget to pray i forget to have
[36:10] everybody stand and read the text
[36:12] tonight you know
[36:13] we're just all human we all make
[36:15] mistakes but god's word is perfect this
[36:17] is the complete record of almighty god
[36:19] and not one word can change not one word
[36:22] fails amen
[36:24] so god can say let us and that still
[36:26] don't mean two persons
[36:28] us doesn't have to mean two persons
[36:31] it means two manifestations
[36:34] hallelujah
[36:35] because that's what the bible says right
[36:38] god was manifest in the flesh
[36:40] so that's what the word the word is
[36:42] manifest or appeared
[36:43] so god can have multiple appearances
[36:46] that can use plural pronouns and still
[36:49] not be separate persons because the
[36:51] bible doesn't say that
[36:53] all right
[36:54] now let's go to this thought i'm going
[36:56] to change thoughts now how many have
[36:57] ever were how many have ever heard the
[36:59] word modalism
[37:02] okay so trinitarians will call us
[37:04] modalists
[37:06] and while the definition is okay
[37:09] uh
[37:10] the actual word of the definition the
[37:11] dictionary the teaching of modalism is
[37:14] wrong
[37:15] so if somebody said are you a modalist
[37:17] i'd say no because the bible doesn't say
[37:19] all christians need to be modalists
[37:22] right
[37:23] so we
[37:24] i don't even use the word oneness
[37:26] i just say we believe god is one person
[37:28] because that's what the bible said his
[37:29] person
[37:33] because there's a lot of oneness people
[37:34] that believe tongues are the evidence of
[37:36] the holy ghost right we'll get to that
[37:38] in just a moment
[37:40] now uh modalism
[37:42] here's what it means in the dictionary
[37:46] it means that the doctrine that the
[37:48] three persons of the trinity represent
[37:50] only three modes or aspects of the
[37:53] divine revelation
[37:54] not distinct
[37:56] and co-equal persons in the divine
[37:59] nature so that's a good definition right
[38:01] we don't believe in co-equal persons
[38:04] okay
[38:05] we believe that the uh the three
[38:08] uh three manifestations are just three
[38:11] modes or manifestations of the one
[38:14] person
[38:15] okay
[38:16] so that the definition agrees with
[38:18] scripture but when you study it
[38:21] uh modalism which now remember modalism
[38:23] was declared a heresy in the fourth
[38:26] century at the council of nicaea
[38:28] so remember remember the nicene council
[38:30] 325 a.d
[38:32] constantine brought all these preachers
[38:34] in there he tried to get them all to
[38:36] come in one was arianism and one was
[38:38] modalism well they determined there that
[38:40] modalism was heresy
[38:43] so to say god just changed his mode you
[38:45] know
[38:47] they said that's heresy so modalism just
[38:49] became a bad word since then now again
[38:53] modalism has a lot of truth in it but
[38:55] it's not not all truth so we don't call
[38:57] ourselves a modalist we call ourselves
[38:59] holy ghost-filled christians that follow
[39:01] the prophetic ministry god gave to
[39:03] brother william branham at least that's
[39:05] what i tell people
[39:06] right we had somebody who asked me the
[39:08] other day and i told him that i said i
[39:09] followed the message of god gave to
[39:11] william branham the baptism holy ghost
[39:13] all the signs wonders and miracles are
[39:14] restored and all the mysteries of god
[39:16] are finished praise god
[39:19] who was that i can't remember now all
[39:21] right sorry
[39:22] okay so what's wrong with modalism
[39:24] here's what here's where modalism goes
[39:26] wrong
[39:27] they say
[39:29] that the father son holy ghost are
[39:31] identical in every way well that's not
[39:33] true
[39:36] because jesus says
[39:38] well the holy spirit and father are
[39:40] identical right the holy spirit and
[39:41] father are identical they're totally
[39:43] identical
[39:45] right because the holy ghost is just the
[39:46] father dwelling in your soul
[39:48] right
[39:49] and the holy ghost is invisible did you
[39:51] see the holy ghost when it flew into
[39:52] your soul no it's invisible is the
[39:55] father invisible yes
[39:57] so see the holy ghost and father one of
[39:59] the same but jesus
[40:01] was different right the father and son
[40:03] are not identical
[40:06] because of many reasons okay
[40:09] but the first i'll say it like this the
[40:11] father and son are not identical in
[40:13] their substance
[40:16] because the the son has he had flesh and
[40:19] flesh and blood
[40:20] the father never has flesh and blood
[40:23] never he will always be invisible whom
[40:25] no man can see nor can see remember we
[40:27] read that a few weeks ago for the sunday
[40:29] school two sundays ago
[40:31] no man has seen god nor can see god so
[40:33] god does not have flesh and blood but he
[40:36] made flesh and blood for his image to
[40:38] take it to the cross
[40:39] pay for our sins
[40:42] okay but now church let me say this the
[40:44] father and son are identical by nature
[40:47] there's that word or character
[40:50] did jesus ever sin no
[40:52] did the father ever sin no
[40:55] so they're identical in nature but
[40:57] different in substance
[40:59] amen
[41:00] see church i know we're splitting hairs
[41:02] but listen we got to do that because
[41:03] that's what satan does he gets in these
[41:05] little thoughts and
[41:07] he'll say well they're the same in
[41:08] substance and nature no they're not not
[41:10] the father not the father son father and
[41:12] son are different substance different
[41:14] nature i'm sorry same nature
[41:16] different substance see we have to go
[41:18] down there because the devil tries to
[41:20] squeeze a little bit of leaven in there
[41:22] he tries to hide a little eleven there
[41:24] in that in that dough right
[41:26] so we've got to go down to the very
[41:28] basics of the faith and we have to be
[41:31] able to rightly divide the word of truth
[41:33] but i'm glad we got the holy ghost here
[41:34] to rightly divide the word of truth to
[41:36] us
[41:38] see
[41:39] so modalism says there are all three are
[41:41] identical all three modes are identical
[41:43] that's not true
[41:45] they're identical by
[41:47] nature but not by substance
[41:50] okay
[41:53] all right
[41:55] and second
[42:00] okay i put a little thought in there i'm
[42:01] not sure i put that thought in there
[42:03] that may have been a mistake too and
[42:05] second
[42:06] modalism says the father suffered with
[42:08] jesus
[42:11] that's not true
[42:14] the bible said it please the lord to
[42:17] bruise satan i'm sorry to bruise jesus
[42:19] sorry
[42:20] that's an idea let's go let's read it
[42:21] isaiah 53 i don't have it but it just
[42:24] came in my heart
[42:26] it pleased so god was pleased
[42:29] now not in a way we think oh he was
[42:30] happy his son was dying
[42:32] not that kind of way but in a divine way
[42:35] in other words my plan is being
[42:37] fulfilled my son is obedient
[42:40] isaiah
[42:41] 53
[42:43] i'm gonna have to just search for it
[42:44] real quick it won't be very hard to find
[42:52] ten all right
[42:56] yes thank you sweetie great job all
[42:58] right first time yeah i was looking at
[43:00] the bottom of the verse i thought but
[43:01] it's at the top of the verse okay verse
[43:02] 10 yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[43:05] does that sound like he's being punished
[43:08] who could punish god the father
[43:11] who can make god suffer church nobody
[43:14] now we dramatize it right like brother
[43:16] ram dramatized it like the father was so
[43:18] hurt he had to turn away
[43:20] but that's brother bran that's that's
[43:21] him dramatizing okay
[43:24] just like when brother brown would
[43:25] dramatize how jesus uh had headaches and
[43:28] things that's not in the scripture
[43:30] there's no scripture that says jesus had
[43:32] a headache it's something brother man
[43:33] read out of a book
[43:35] it was a historical fiction book it was
[43:37] the prince of the house of david there
[43:38] it is that's not in the bible but
[43:41] brother ram dramatizes so we can we can
[43:43] feel like well jesus knows that when we
[43:45] get headaches he knows what we feel like
[43:47] so he'll heal us that's true
[43:49] but you'll never find that in scripture
[43:51] where jesus had a headache
[43:53] right you'll find where daniel suffered
[43:54] because the visions you'll find that
[43:56] but you won't find jesus suffering with
[43:58] a headache well brother i'm dramatized
[44:00] like the father had to now the father
[44:02] did have to turn away right because the
[44:03] father had to forsake jesus because
[44:05] jesus said my god my god why have you
[44:07] forsaken me
[44:09] so the father had to forsake him but the
[44:11] father didn't suffer
[44:13] because he doesn't have a physical body
[44:16] and god doesn't battle god doesn't have
[44:18] mind battles like we have oh i'm so sad
[44:21] for my son church god don't have my mind
[44:23] battles
[44:24] right
[44:25] see but modalism says all three suffered
[44:28] that's not true
[44:31] see
[44:32] and i had to go look that up but see
[44:34] that proves we're not modalists we're
[44:36] just holding ghostfield saints i mean
[44:38] i'm just one of them sister i'm just one
[44:39] of those holy ghost things what are you
[44:41] i'm one of them holy ghostfield saints
[44:43] i'm i'm i'm in the one of them church
[44:46] right
[44:47] right i'm not a modalist i'm not a
[44:48] trinitarian i'm a holy ghost-filled
[44:51] saint that believes everything the bible
[44:52] says about the godhead
[44:55] you're a good audience church i'm almost
[44:56] just give me 10 minutes here i'll be
[44:57] done
[44:59] if not probably going to pass out
[45:00] because i'm so tired here
[45:02] jose's going to have to pack me out to
[45:03] the van here
[45:05] no remember so jesus became a curse and
[45:07] god cannot be cursed god cannot curse
[45:10] himself
[45:13] now there is one more mystery brother
[45:14] jose there's one more mystery i'm going
[45:16] to share it with us here tonight jesus
[45:18] was the bible said the father sealed
[45:20] jesus his soul with the holy ghost
[45:22] now how then could he remove it that's a
[45:24] great mystery
[45:26] but he could
[45:28] because god cannot curse his own spirit
[45:32] unless this thought just came to me
[45:34] unless just the flesh was cursed
[45:37] that might be it
[45:39] but god god is a spirit he can't curse
[45:42] his own spirit in jesus
[45:44] so maybe he just put the curse on the
[45:45] flesh i don't know that's something left
[45:47] to talk about
[45:49] i'm looking for more revelation on that
[45:51] it's either that either god put the
[45:52] curse just on the body
[45:54] or he had to remove his spirit his
[45:56] spirit from jesus's soul
[46:00] which jesus never sinned jesus never had
[46:01] any unbelief so his soul wouldn't be
[46:03] lost
[46:04] although his soul did have to descend to
[46:06] hell for us
[46:07] so that's interesting that's a great
[46:09] that's a deep teaching there's some more
[46:10] deep things we can get into with with
[46:12] what happened to jesus's body soul and
[46:14] spirit right
[46:15] but the bible said plainly christ was
[46:18] made a curse for us
[46:20] he was made a curse he was cursed for us
[46:23] right
[46:24] the bible said god hath made him to be
[46:27] sin for us
[46:29] but didn't say which part
[46:32] i didn't say his soul was
[46:34] well i'm sorry his soul wasn't offering
[46:36] for sin yeah we're in isaiah 53.
[46:38] okay so that might open it up a little
[46:40] bit more maybe he had to remove the the
[46:41] seal from his soul
[46:44] his soul was made a offering for sin
[46:46] that was in verse 10 too okay good job
[46:49] yep so
[46:51] there i'm not sure yeah that's a great
[46:53] question there it's a great mystery we
[46:54] have to pray about that one the father
[46:56] could not curse himself because you
[46:57] cannot curse god if he's blessed right
[47:00] he he is the blessed and only potentate
[47:03] amen the immortal invisible the king of
[47:06] kings the holy king eternal praise god
[47:09] okay
[47:11] so see knowing all that jesus had to be
[47:13] cursed for us
[47:14] knowing all that modalism fails because
[47:17] the father did not suffer the father
[47:19] doesn't suffer the father doesn't get
[47:21] scared he doesn't get uh
[47:23] he doesn't worry like we he doesn't have
[47:25] mind battles like we have he does the
[47:28] father does not suffer the church said
[47:31] so see that's why motivism fails
[47:34] because they take it to such an uh such
[47:36] an
[47:36] extreme so let me say this born-again
[47:39] christians we don't need labels for our
[47:41] beliefs because they don't have labels
[47:44] in the book of acts they weren't arguing
[47:46] about modalism or trinitarianism in the
[47:48] book of acts so we don't need it right
[47:51] we just call ourselves holy ghost-filled
[47:53] christians and the bible said jesus will
[47:55] guide us into all truth
[47:58] amen
[48:00] now we're not oneness either
[48:03] because oneness has the same idea
[48:05] someone is teachers teach all three are
[48:07] the same and all three suffered but yet
[48:10] it's one person
[48:12] so see they have a lot of truth too
[48:14] but every one of this teacher is a
[48:15] little different that's what and they
[48:17] have they have a church they have a
[48:19] denomination called oneness did you know
[48:20] that you can go join the denomination of
[48:23] oneness it's a denomination
[48:26] is the bride ever going to be
[48:27] denominated what do you think
[48:28] no
[48:29] so see that's why we don't want to be a
[48:31] part of any of the denominational titles
[48:33] either
[48:35] right we just want to have the name mrs
[48:38] lord jesus christ amen
[48:40] i just want to be a holy ghost-filled
[48:42] saint i'm on my way to heaven i'm
[48:44] shouting the victory i'm a rapture
[48:46] sinking holy ghost-filled saying praise
[48:48] god that's all i am amen i'm one of
[48:50] those and my heart is turned uh my i'm a
[48:54] heart of the children and my heart is
[48:55] turned back to the pentecostal fathers
[48:58] hallelujah praise god
[49:01] now but they got five million people in
[49:03] their denomination i looked it up i put
[49:05] that in the book
[49:07] it's called the oneness united
[49:09] pentecostal church injure international
[49:12] five million people brother jose is that
[49:14] what your family family's in are they in
[49:15] the oneness
[49:17] upc
[49:20] okay not one that's okay okay well
[49:22] that's a big church right that's a five
[49:24] million people
[49:26] i don't know if there's five million the
[49:27] message and on the earth or not
[49:31] oh they say three okay that's a probably
[49:32] good estimate
[49:34] and shrinking right yeah because the
[49:35] fewer and fewer that be there find it
[49:38] sadly
[49:40] but their major error is with making
[49:43] tongues the evidence has nothing to do
[49:45] with
[49:46] uh godhead they have a few things wrong
[49:48] on the godhead right
[49:51] but they're major heirs saying you got
[49:52] to speak in tongues you got to get the
[49:54] gift before the
[49:57] all right so giver
[49:57] so silly i can't believe people believe
[49:59] that
[50:00] you've got to have the gift
[50:02] in order uh before the giver uh so silly
[50:05] so silly but don't believe it church
[50:07] just let's stand on the promises of god
[50:09] amen
[50:10] let's keep standing on the promises of
[50:11] god
[50:12] now let's start on
[50:15] let's start on the plural pronouns and
[50:17] then we'll finish then
[50:19] uh next week
[50:22] okay so get your bibles let's go to uh
[50:26] john 14 23 let's read john 14 23.
[50:32] so we know the bible never says god is
[50:34] three persons right
[50:36] and if you have father son holy ghost
[50:38] the holy ghost conceived jesus in the
[50:40] womb and jesus called the father father
[50:43] so that reduces it down to two persons
[50:46] if you're a trinitarian and if you
[50:47] actually actually you're honest with
[50:49] yourself in the bible
[50:51] but the bible never says god's two
[50:53] persons so the father and son now that
[50:55] we have left we have the father holy
[50:57] ghost left and son there so now we only
[51:00] have two persons left if we actually
[51:01] have honesty about the bible
[51:04] but since the bible never says god's two
[51:06] persons god must be one person
[51:10] so you must always look at plural
[51:11] pronouns or possessive determiners
[51:15] as
[51:16] uh they're just ways god can show
[51:19] jesus's flesh
[51:21] versus jesus's holy ghost anointing
[51:25] all right
[51:27] god never said i'm two persons okay
[51:30] john 14 23
[51:31] if a man loved me he will keep my words
[51:33] and my father will love him and we
[51:37] we so now we have let us i'll get to let
[51:38] us later
[51:40] we have led us in genesis 1 26. now we
[51:42] have we
[51:43] father and son saying we
[51:45] will come unto him
[51:46] and make our abode
[51:49] our with him so we have we an hour
[51:52] sounds like more than one person
[51:55] right but is it does the bible say
[51:57] there's two persons
[52:00] no so it can't be two persons
[52:13] so that's john 14 23. so we have we and
[52:17] hour and church let me just be honest
[52:19] that's hard for me to understand i'm
[52:21] just being honest when i wrote this
[52:23] chapter it was a hard chapter to write
[52:26] but all i can say is that god never
[52:29] calls himself two persons that's when it
[52:31] all boils down to it
[52:34] but see we can't ignore these scriptures
[52:36] and say oh they're not in the bible
[52:37] sisterhood don't ask me that question
[52:40] sister sister virtue don't ask me that
[52:42] question
[52:43] right nature please don't ask me
[52:45] no we gotta look we gotta take every
[52:47] question they can give us
[52:49] right the little girls and
[52:51] the little boys eventually when zion and
[52:53] james get older
[52:55] and the big boys like malachi
[52:57] we gotta take questions right we can't
[53:00] be afraid of them
[53:03] okay
[53:04] all right go to john 17 21 now we see us
[53:07] we have we our and now let's see us
[53:10] another let us
[53:17] john 17 21 that they all may be one as
[53:19] thou father art and me and i in thee
[53:22] that they also may be one in
[53:25] us
[53:26] us okay
[53:29] so we
[53:30] is a plural pronoun
[53:33] and our is a positive determiner oh you
[53:36] know what i think i just got the
[53:37] revelation before
[53:39] uh before service i was up here praying
[53:42] i was actually writing with lydia in the
[53:43] car
[53:44] what is a noun it's a
[53:46] person
[53:47] place or
[53:50] thing
[53:53] so see a noun doesn't have to be a
[53:56] person it can be a thing
[53:58] and what was jesus he wasn't a separate
[54:00] person
[54:01] he was a manifestation or a thing
[54:05] right because the bible calls the holy
[54:07] ghost it
[54:09] the bible says when the when it when it
[54:11] fell upon them it
[54:13] right it didn't say person
[54:15] right it's a manifestation
[54:17] it
[54:19] thing
[54:20] it's something right it's something
[54:23] so a noun does it there it is a noun
[54:25] doesn't mean a person it can be a thing
[54:27] as well or a manifestation praise god
[54:29] amen
[54:30] now i wish i would have wrote that in
[54:32] the book but i didn't amen because that
[54:33] just came today
[54:35] see because a noun doesn't always mean
[54:37] person person place
[54:39] or thing or sometimes animal they say we
[54:41] know god is no animal
[54:43] right
[54:44] so it has to be a thing
[54:47] a manifestation
[54:49] all right now that's just my thought
[54:51] that just came today so i hope that's
[54:53] fresh i hope that i believe that's from
[54:54] the lord i could be wrong but i feel
[54:56] that was fresh
[54:59] so
[55:00] if god is not two or three persons why
[55:02] does he use plural pronouns like us and
[55:06] we
[55:06] and positive determiners like our
[55:10] the best answer i can say in the book is
[55:12] because jesus was both fully human and
[55:15] fully divine yet his human side was not
[55:18] totally divine
[55:20] okay
[55:22] therefore he had to use a separate
[55:24] pronoun for the part of him that was not
[55:26] divine
[55:28] you always had to show the difference
[55:29] between the divine the divine part and
[55:31] the human part
[55:34] so it had to be a thing that was not god
[55:38] amen praise god
[55:40] the body was a thing it wasn't a
[55:43] separate person it was the same person
[55:45] but a different appearance a different
[55:47] thing than the invisible person
[55:50] okay
[55:51] that's that's pretty deep i understand
[55:53] that that's even deep for me of course i
[55:55] mean i'm not very deep person but i'm
[55:57] just saying it's it's hard to understand
[56:01] all right
[56:02] so his body was mortal but god was
[56:06] immortal so let's do some opposites here
[56:08] okay so let's do some opposites jesus
[56:10] was tempted in his human will but god
[56:12] was
[56:14] not
[56:14] tempted so we need different
[56:17] we need different nouns right
[56:19] because this is god's image but god's
[56:21] image can now be tempted
[56:23] god's image
[56:25] is now mortal but god's not god's
[56:27] immortal
[56:29] let's keep doing some opposites
[56:31] jesus died but the father
[56:34] cannot die
[56:36] right
[56:37] jesus is a human
[56:39] flesh body but god is a
[56:42] spirit
[56:43] good good good opposites here
[56:46] we're getting down to some first grade
[56:47] teaching here
[56:49] we're talking about opposites today
[56:51] up down high low mad sad all these
[56:54] opposites
[56:55] so see
[56:56] because of these opposites we needed a
[56:59] separate pronoun
[57:02] to name the thing that's different than
[57:04] the holy person
[57:06] praise god
[57:08] yet jesus was not co-equal with the
[57:11] father
[57:12] because his flesh was not
[57:14] eternal right it wasn't perfect it
[57:16] wasn't divine
[57:18] jesus was not a co-equal separate person
[57:20] from the father he was the image of the
[57:22] father
[57:24] he was the father's it the father's
[57:27] thing the father's manifestation
[57:30] okay i know that sounds a little strange
[57:31] but
[57:32] it wasn't a separate person
[57:35] it was the image of his person
[57:39] and so jesus church
[57:40] he was a a manifestation unlike any
[57:45] others
[57:46] is my mic on okay
[57:49] there never was a manifestation like
[57:51] jesus and church there never will be
[57:55] even melchizedek
[57:57] was kind of like jesus but not really
[58:00] because melchizedek didn't come through
[58:01] a mother's womb
[58:04] he wasn't a little baby melchizedek hey
[58:06] little milk has it god bless you little
[58:08] guy you're so handsome
[58:10] no god just picked up that that that
[58:13] dust and made a body right you talked
[58:15] about that a while ago
[58:17] well think about the burning bush
[58:20] was that the same as jesus no jesus
[58:22] wasn't a fire he was a man
[58:25] right
[58:26] think about the rock and the wilderness
[58:27] where all that water poured out was that
[58:28] like jesus well no jesus wasn't a rock
[58:31] now living water flows out of jesus
[58:33] right
[58:33] thank god amen praise god hallelujah
[58:38] but the voice coming out of the burning
[58:40] bush well no jesus had a body and the
[58:42] voice just had fire
[58:44] so any man the angel the lord no that's
[58:46] angel wings yeah
[58:49] you know shine like the sun jesus body
[58:51] didn't sound like the sun unless he was
[58:52] transfigured right
[58:55] so see all these manifestations were
[58:57] totally different they all could go back
[58:58] to being god
[58:59] but this man stayed the same he stayed
[59:02] human
[59:03] and he came through a woman and he could
[59:05] die the other manifestations couldn't
[59:07] die
[59:09] this is the only one that could die and
[59:12] did die and die church in your place
[59:14] amen
[59:16] freely died in your place
[59:19] so this is why as i close
[59:22] this is why god has to use
[59:25] plural pronouns
[59:27] because this manifestation of jesus body
[59:29] is so much different than all
[59:32] the other manifestations how about the
[59:34] whirlwind god spoken to whirlwind to job
[59:38] was that like jesus no jesus wasn't a
[59:39] whirlwind
[59:40] he didn't get it the bible said he had
[59:42] no beauty we desire him people like to
[59:44] see whirlwinds i like to see whirlwinds
[59:45] they're they're pretty amazing right
[59:46] they're just amazing feats of nature but
[59:49] jesus body he was just there and
[59:52] you look at him and he's just a man just
[59:54] just a boring man
[59:56] until he started preaching
[59:59] until he started praying for the sick
[1:00:00] and calling for the dead to be raised
[1:00:02] amen he's just like a regular human no
[1:00:04] beauty not
[1:00:06] nothing
[1:00:09] and so see church let me close with this
[1:00:12] the reason god needs plural pronouns is
[1:00:14] because the truth is somewhere between
[1:00:17] these two extremes of father and son
[1:00:20] are two separate
[1:00:21] persons
[1:00:23] and the father and son are totally
[1:00:24] identical we need an in-between
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:30] so that's why we have to have plural
[1:00:32] pronouns
[1:00:33] because the truth is in the middle of
[1:00:35] the road
[1:00:37] right it's not on the extreme
[1:00:39] father and son are completely one it's
[1:00:41] not on the other extreme
[1:00:43] uh father and son
[1:00:45] have no oneness at all well they do have
[1:00:47] some oneness by the nature
[1:00:50] okay
[1:00:53] so two co-equal persons and then total
[1:00:55] oneness the truth is right in the middle
[1:00:57] it's not total oneness and it's not two
[1:00:59] separate persons it's right in the
[1:01:01] middle so god had to use plural pronouns
[1:01:04] to show the difference between jesus's
[1:01:06] humanity and jesus's deity which was god
[1:01:12] so in other words church the body of
[1:01:14] jesus did not create itself
[1:01:16] did you catch that jesus was not his own
[1:01:19] father
[1:01:20] jesus's body like your body everybody
[1:01:23] tap your body
[1:01:24] your body didn't make itself either
[1:01:27] right you didn't make yourself
[1:01:29] your parents made you right right
[1:01:31] through the act of
[1:01:32] the act of nature
[1:01:35] well same thing with jesus jesus didn't
[1:01:37] make himself
[1:01:39] the father made him the holy ghost made
[1:01:41] him amen
[1:01:42] same thing
[1:01:45] so see there's not the total oneness
[1:01:47] that jesus made his own body he didn't
[1:01:49] his father made the body or the holy
[1:01:51] ghost made the body
[1:01:53] so we have to have some place in the
[1:01:55] middle where we can show the difference
[1:01:57] between the father
[1:01:58] and the son
[1:02:01] okay
[1:02:02] i've often heard this statement it's
[1:02:03] true god is not one
[1:02:05] like your finger
[1:02:07] so that so that's that total oneness god
[1:02:09] is not totally one like your finger's
[1:02:11] one
[1:02:12] no
[1:02:14] because the body of jesus did not create
[1:02:16] itself
[1:02:17] right the body of jesus was not
[1:02:19] identical to the father
[1:02:21] it could die it could it could get sick
[1:02:24] right it could
[1:02:25] uh it could be tempted but god can never
[1:02:28] be tempted
[1:02:30] all right
[1:02:31] so god and christ are one but not
[1:02:35] but not like the trinity says and not
[1:02:37] like the oneness people say they're only
[1:02:40] one the way the bible says they're one
[1:02:43] and that's in their sinless holy nature
[1:02:47] praise god
[1:02:49] the father is the invisible spirit the
[1:02:52] son is the human temple of the father
[1:02:55] so church we are going to be the group
[1:02:57] remember the mark of the beast is going
[1:02:58] to come down to trinitarianism as well
[1:03:00] if you're a church and don't believe the
[1:03:01] trinity you're gonna have to take the
[1:03:02] mark of the beast but god will spare us
[1:03:04] from that we believe
[1:03:05] by the grace of god
[1:03:07] it's such a serious subject but church
[1:03:10] this subject proves that we will only
[1:03:12] use the pure words of god and we will
[1:03:14] not use satanic words can i say it like
[1:03:16] that because that really that's really
[1:03:18] what it boils down to if we're not using
[1:03:20] god's pure words we're using satan's
[1:03:23] perverted words
[1:03:25] let's stand to our feet
[1:03:29] every word of god is pure
[1:03:34] musicians can come
[1:03:36] that's what separates us from all other
[1:03:38] churches we only use the pure words of
[1:03:40] god to understand the godhead
[1:03:43] god changes manifestation god changes
[1:03:46] form
[1:03:47] yes i believe let us
[1:03:49] yes come and make our abode with us i
[1:03:51] believe that we will i believe we
[1:03:54] but i do not add anything outside the
[1:03:57] bible to that i must understand us we
[1:04:00] are using the bible only and i've been
[1:04:04] happy to do it these last
[1:04:06] night 20 years here 19 years
[1:04:09] very happy to do it 2001. oh yes 20
[1:04:11] years now okay maybe 20 years in
[1:04:13] november praise god finally at the 20
[1:04:15] mark brother jose
[1:04:17] praise god
[1:04:19] and that's what we've done we've stood
[1:04:20] here for 20 years some of us longer
[1:04:23] and we've stood on just the word of god
[1:04:25] and church we're happy to keep standing
[1:04:28] on it by the grace of god
[1:04:31] this will manifest who's the children of
[1:04:33] god and who's not
[1:04:35] those who keep the word only or those
[1:04:38] who add to the word so it proves we're
[1:04:40] the seed of god
[1:04:42] amen let's put our heads here for word
[1:04:43] of prayer
[1:04:46] church i hope this helped you tonight i
[1:04:47] know it was more teaching a little bit
[1:04:49] of preaching but i just want to
[1:04:51] encourage you that this bible is exactly
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:55] and we have the pure revelation of the
[1:04:57] godhead
[1:04:59] and let me just say like this church
[1:05:00] with our heads bound we're never going
[1:05:02] to convince some of these hell-bound
[1:05:04] trinitarians do you understand what i
[1:05:05] mean
[1:05:06] they are their serpentine
[1:05:09] many of them are serpentine few people
[1:05:11] are going to find it
[1:05:13] we'll never convince like like brother
[1:05:15] said you can't argue with the evil
[1:05:16] spirit
[1:05:19] but i'm preaching these things to
[1:05:20] strengthen your heart the bible calls it
[1:05:22] establishing your heart say hey okay
[1:05:25] establishing your hearts and truth
[1:05:27] praise god
[1:05:29] so that you have an answer
[1:05:32] so if anybody ever asks you you can say
[1:05:33] well my pastor can talk to my pastor
[1:05:35] about it you may not remember church i
[1:05:37] may not remember that's why i wrote the
[1:05:38] book so i could go back and remember but
[1:05:40] i was saying
[1:05:42] i can't remember everything
[1:05:46] this is what separates us
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:06:02] let me
[1:06:06] god bless the live streamers
