[33:48] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[33:52] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[33:55] with God but made himself of no
[33:58] reputation and took upon him the form of
[34:01] a servant and was made in the likeness
[34:04] of men let's have a word of Prayer you

[35:34] real quick on modalism maybe we'll get
[35:36] to that I don't know if we'll get to
[35:37] that but that's a good thought
[35:46] to kind of see how Paul uses the
[35:48] scripture
[35:50] yeah okay here we go all right so we're
[35:52] ready to go by God's grace

[36:23] down there in Tennessee okay oh it's
[36:26] Rach okay praise God yeah I thought all
[36:29] your families up here is that right but
[36:30] okay I thought so before I forget I've
[36:33] been reading this book a pilgrim church
[36:35] it's written by eh broad back I don't
[36:38] know much about him but
[36:40] if you like a copy let me know also I
[36:43] there's a map Oh history there just like
[36:46] the one we got out there in the
[36:48] fellowship room I'm gonna make an order
[36:50] of those if you want one let me know if
[36:52] you'll use it they're really nice I like
[36:55] to be able to give our church or small
[36:57] church so if I get books I like you I
[36:59] like to offer them to you so if you want
[37:01] a book let me know I only read the first
[37:04] two chapters
[37:05] it's beautiful just see in the history
[37:08] and they go right along with the anti
[37:11] Nicean council books that brother Graham
[37:15] used there they're very similar in their
[37:17] history they kind of they must pull from
[37:19] the same historians and so
[37:22] they're really really great I just
[37:24] finished yesterday the Pergamos chapter
[37:27] I physicists Myrna Pergamos and we're
[37:30] almost halfway through that chapter by
[37:32] God's grace
[37:33] so really really wonderful
[37:36] testimonies and just amazing to see how
[37:40] God protected the little seed the little
[37:42] bride the little flock he just protected
[37:44] her all down through the aged and
[37:45] thankful that we're part of them praise
[37:48] God hallelujah
[37:49] so let's look here at chapter 2 now
[37:53] as I was saying Lord willing I think on
[37:58] last Sunday if I'm not mistaken the
[38:01] whole book of Philippians can almost be
[38:03] summarized like a
[38:04] sermon for your mind like a message
[38:08] about keeping your mind in the things of
[38:11] God like burl Ram says the greatest
[38:13] battle ever fought and so we'll get to
[38:16] that Lord willing but in verse 1 I'm
[38:18] just gonna review this real quick Paul
[38:20] asked are there if there's five things
[38:21] in Christ are these five things in
[38:24] Christ and of course we all know the
[38:26] answer is yes and when they're defined
[38:29] we would say this is their encouragement
[38:31] in Christ is their refreshment I just
[38:34] got a text from a brother in North
[38:36] Carolina this morning's I just want to
[38:38] appreciate your me tell you I appreciate
[38:40] your ministry he said it's like
[38:41] refreshing Living Waters I said well
[38:44] thank you brother I said which sermons a
[38:47] particular because I just kind of want
[38:49] to know like which one was I mean to me
[38:51] they're all refreshing them and he said
[38:53] this mystery series we've been doing on
[38:54] all the mysteries and he said all the
[38:57] sermons about proving all things and
[38:59] showing how jeffersonville's too far off
[39:03] and leaning the sign is too far off yet
[39:05] we're right down the middle so I thank
[39:07] the Lord those are all sermons so it's
[39:08] encouraging when people just out of
[39:10] nowhere well text you to say thanks for
[39:12] being a refreshing blessing to me so I
[39:15] know there's consolation in Christ amen
[39:18] comfort is there any goodwill in Christ
[39:20] is there any joint participation where
[39:23] we get to participate with one another
[39:25] and encourage one another love each
[39:26] other back and forth is there any bowels
[39:29] of love of Christ intense feelings of
[39:32] love for each other is there any pity on
[39:35] each other for Christ of course there is
[39:38] he says if there's any of this
[39:41] then he said fulfill my joy or fill me
[39:44] up to the top provide me with some joy
[39:47] because all of this is available in
[39:49] Christ make me happy make my joy befall
[39:54] by doing this by all of us having the
[39:57] same mind right with the same love one
[40:01] Accord one month that should remind us
[40:03] of the day of Pentecost they had one
[40:05] cook one of course in other words Paul
[40:07] saying act like the day of Pentecost
[40:10] everybody have one passion of court
[40:13] means passion it means desire everybody
[40:16] has one desire one Accord if there's
[40:19] anything good in Christ which we know
[40:21] there everything good about Christ
[40:23] everything's good in Christ but if
[40:25] there's any of this in Christ he said
[40:28] make me joyful by keeping the same mind
[40:31] now how'd they get there they prayed
[40:32] together they worshiped together right
[40:34] they they fellowship in the upper room
[40:36] that's how they got their praise not by
[40:38] staying in one Accord right one mind
[40:40] that's how they got there by being with
[40:42] each other and notice there's just I
[40:44] just want to say that you know Paul sang
[40:47] to do it for his sake right in other
[40:49] words live for other people praise God
[40:51] it is and so we would live you know in
[40:55] this case they were living to make the
[40:56] prophet happy right living to provide
[40:59] him joy that's what all of it and that
[41:02] should make us happy how many know that
[41:04] when you serve other people it actually
[41:05] makes you happy to see a life of service
[41:09] a life of serving other people not only
[41:12] makes you them happy but you happy
[41:14] praise God
[41:16] hallelujah
[41:18] was he living for yourself doesn't make
[41:21] you happy it doesn't make doesn't bring
[41:24] any fulfillment all right there's no
[41:25] contentment right godliness without can
[41:28] I'm sorry godliness with contentment is
[41:30] great gain the Bible says so see when
[41:33] you find your place and your position in
[41:35] Christ you're content because you're
[41:37] happy see because you're serving other
[41:40] people you can see the you can see the
[41:42] encouragement praise God let's go back
[41:45] in you can see how you refresh other
[41:47] people other people refresh you right
[41:49] you can see how you participated you
[41:52] have good friendship and fellowship with
[41:54] people your happiest feelings are with
[41:56] the saints of God amen
[41:59] oh that's beautiful praise God you log
[42:01] the resin we long to be with one another
[42:03] to worship the Lord together we should
[42:06] long to do that oh
[42:08] how many like that by God's grace oh
[42:10] that's beautiful remember Paul is just
[42:13] church he's riding to this church of
[42:15] Lydia right this is the church eleven
[42:17] years later this is the Church of the
[42:19] jailer praise God this is the Church of
[42:22] the woman who had the demon cast offer
[42:24] the witchcraft demon this is the church
[42:27] he's writing to people that had seen
[42:30] multiple miracles and God has opened
[42:32] their heart and know tremendous things
[42:35] that these we haven't even seen as far
[42:37] as like a jail being shaken and broken
[42:39] up things maybe we haven't seen but yeah
[42:42] his goal for them was that everybody
[42:44] would be in one Accord we live to make
[42:47] each other happy praise God we live to
[42:51] build up each other's happiness and joy
[42:53] in this life amen
[42:55] it's a great value and this is what I
[42:58] come to see right now this is a great
[43:00] value just to have a peaceful life in
[43:02] this hour
[43:03] so go to first Timothy 2 in your Bibles
[43:06] I'm just reminded of this simple
[43:07] scripture
[43:09] it's just such a great blessing to have
[43:12] peace because so many people you see it
[43:15] through their you know their social
[43:16] media posts or you see it when you talk
[43:17] to them so many people do not have peace
[43:20] they're living in torment under demon
[43:22] torment because they fail to take the
[43:25] Word of God but to me I can see it's a
[43:28] great blessing that we as believer can
[43:31] live in the peace of God amen for the
[43:34] world can't have it jesus said I leave
[43:36] you my joy the world won't receive it
[43:39] but I'm leaving it for you amen so we
[43:41] are the people the one group on this
[43:43] earth that can live in the joy of the
[43:46] Lord
[43:47] first Timothy 2:1 I
[43:51] exhort therefore that first of all
[43:54] supplications prayers intercessions and
[43:56] giving of thanks be made for all men for
[43:59] kings and for all that are in authority
[44:02] that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
[44:04] life in all godliness and honesty for
[44:08] this is good and acceptable in the sight
[44:11] of God our Savior
[44:13] who will have all men to be saved and to
[44:16] come unto the knowledge of the truth
[44:20] praise God so just a reminder here this
[44:24] was Paul's prayer that he told Timothy
[44:27] to pray in Ephesus remember Ephesus was
[44:30] a very filthy City as a Roman province
[44:32] they adopted all the same
[44:35] habits of Rome
[44:37] so wicked well yet he's telling them
[44:40] that pray for your leaders right pray
[44:43] for them so we can lead a quiet and
[44:46] peaceable life in all godliness and
[44:49] honesty oh what a we should be so happy
[44:52] searching if we can live a life of peace
[44:55] if we can live a life of honesty and
[44:58] godliness we should be the happiest
[45:00] people praise God because so many people
[45:03] do not have that peace there's political
[45:05] unrest right in many nations
[45:08] you're the leaders are so corrupt now of
[45:10] course many of ours are too but at least
[45:12] we can live quiet and peaceable lives at
[45:15] least they're not interrupting you know
[45:16] our income and our food supply and all
[45:19] these things now it may come down to
[45:21] that of course right before the rapture
[45:23] and the squeeze it may come down to that
[45:24] but at least right now church we can
[45:27] look in our lives and we should praying
[45:29] for our leaders and thank God that we
[45:32] have a quiet peaceful godly honest life
[45:36] because this is good and acceptable in
[45:38] the sight of God amen that's what I'm
[45:42] learning right now just learning you
[45:43] know John Graham I still talk once a
[45:45] month and he always asked me every month
[45:47] he's like what are you learning about
[45:49] that what a good man
[45:52] and you know some boats I have a hard
[45:54] time like you talking about doctrine or
[45:56] what am i learning in my life and and
[45:59] recently we're supposed to talk last
[46:01] night forget the holiday I'm gonna Lord
[46:03] willing share this with him I'm learning
[46:05] just the value of having a peace and
[46:08] quiet quiet life
[46:10] just living a godly life because think
[46:13] about that you know we sang Battle Hymn
[46:15] of the Republic but their life in that
[46:18] time was not a life of peace it was war
[46:20] it was civil unrest and civil war can
[46:24] you imagine going to war nor itself
[46:27] against her family
[46:29] it just that's a life I don't want to
[46:32] live right I wouldn't want have to kill
[46:34] my cousins right we wouldn't have to
[46:37] kill fellow Americans but yet they had
[46:39] to the men had to go unless they had
[46:41] some reason they couldn't go and can you
[46:44] imagine how that was the age of the
[46:45] Philadelphia age you know anything of a
[46:47] man right that was the age that they
[46:49] delivered well we find ourselves here
[46:52] and we and we got to be encouraged that
[46:55] God has blessed us and giving us the
[46:58] blessings of this life thank God it's
[47:02] good and acceptable in the sight of God
[47:04] our Savior now say like this just as
[47:07] much as they fought against slavery
[47:08] physically we ought to fight against the
[47:11] slavery of sin spiritually Amen praise
[47:15] God we got to fight against getting in
[47:17] bad habits right we're gonna fight
[47:19] against temptations right we got to
[47:21] fight against greed and anger and lust
[47:23] and all these things we ought to fight
[47:25] against that just as fiercely because we
[47:28] have a greater anointing we have the
[47:30] Eagle anointing
[47:31] amen oh thank the Lord praise God
[47:37] thank the Lord amen
[47:40] see we're living to make others joyful
[47:44] praise God that's what Paul's teaching
[47:47] is here in the scripture now I'm gonna
[47:48] move back in my Bible to Philippians the
[47:51] church I pray more that prayed for
[47:53] President Trump more than I prayed for
[47:55] any other leader I think that's I think
[47:58] why I think it's because we're coming
[47:59] down to the end now
[48:01] you know I'm paying a little more
[48:04] attention in the politics because I
[48:06] brother Bram said watch and pray I still
[48:08] pray but then I'm watching I'm looking
[48:10] when one of these churches going to
[48:12] unite with the government because my dad
[48:14] tells this this is how the temptation
[48:15] comes now it may not come in our day we
[48:18] may all have to have funeral services
[48:20] for one another humanity pets but it may
[48:23] not come in our day it may come in the
[48:24] next generation after us but we want to
[48:27] watch and be ready praise God and we
[48:30] want to leave a testimony that we fought
[48:33] for righteousness we believed in
[48:35] holiness and so I found myself you know
[48:38] watching these things and I would just
[48:41] even think another day I'm just thankful
[48:42] that God had President Trump win the
[48:44] election can you imagine if Hillary
[48:46] Clinton was the president right now
[48:47] I really would have imagined that and
[48:51] you see her husband's uh his name's
[48:53] getting thrown around for maybe being
[48:54] arrested with that Feinstein guy what's
[48:57] his name I forget my there's just a lot
[48:59] of corruption there is a lot of
[49:01] corruption
[49:02] I'm sure there's a lot of corruption in
[49:04] every in every leader maybe but I just
[49:08] thank the Lord then at least I can turn
[49:10] on like I watched your President Trump
[49:11] speech on Friday night for a little bit
[49:13] at least he could said at least he said
[49:16] thank God and God bless america god
[49:18] bless the USA and at least he fights for
[49:21] a little bit of religious freedom and
[49:22] thank God he stands for Israel you know
[49:24] I think I'm just saying as the time goes
[49:26] on I look at that scripture and Timothy
[49:28] I'm just thankful for God's mercy for
[49:31] this country praise God I
[49:36] think the Lord for it how the new you
[49:39] down
[49:42] here we look in the scripture verse to
[49:45] fulfill my joy so make me joyful in
[49:48] other words live for me the prophet says
[49:51] live for me that everybody will have the
[49:53] same mind and one Accord
[49:56] now let's flip through some of these
[49:58] scriptures here I'm gonna pull up my
[50:01] Bible here on my computer I
[50:07] thought was so striking
[50:11] ten times Paul refers to the minds let's
[50:15] just read them quickly
[50:17] Paul focuses on the mind this is the the
[50:20] letter of the believers to keep their
[50:23] minds United around the gospel of Jesus
[50:28] only let your conversation 127 be has it
[50:33] become at the gospel of Christ that
[50:34] wherever I come and see you or else I be
[50:36] absent I may hear your affairs and you
[50:39] stand fast in one sphere with one mind
[50:41] striving together for the faith of the
[50:44] gospel that means a content so it could
[50:46] be a sports contest it could be a battle
[50:49] so we can either see ourselves as a
[50:50] sports team or as a military assembly
[50:53] praise God with one mind or to fight
[50:56] together or work together for the faith
[51:00] of the gospel praise God now 2 verse 2
[51:03] that was in our text
[51:05] fulfill my joy that ye be like-minded
[51:07] having the same love one Accord one mind
[51:12] amen praise God oh thank you lord verse
[51:16] 3 let nothing be done through strife or
[51:18] vainglory but in lowliness of mine
[51:21] oh my the greatest battle ever fought
[51:23] hallelujah praise God and each esteem
[51:26] other better than themselves
[51:29] verse 5 let this mind be in you which
[51:33] was in Christ Jesus so Paul you know he
[51:36] knows they got the Holy Ghost into the
[51:38] soul but he said let this mind be in you
[51:41] get your minds united together you've
[51:44] got a church for 11 years right we've
[51:46] had ours for 14 they had their church
[51:48] when you wrote this for 11 years he said
[51:50] we you need to have your mind united a
[51:52] church will manifest the love of God
[51:55] best when their minds are all focused on
[51:58] the same thing the gospel of Jesus
[52:00] Christ
[52:01] now 3:15 is the next mind Scripture
[52:08] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[52:11] be thus minded then if any I'm sorry and
[52:15] if anything ye be otherwise minded God
[52:19] shall even reveal you
[52:22] praise God let's keep the mind that we
[52:25] have and if God's gonna reveal anything
[52:27] else to us he'll do it raise God in
[52:30] other words God will show us the next
[52:31] step what should we focus on right now
[52:33] and then once we got that once we get
[52:36] that then he says if there's anything
[52:38] else that we need to focus on he'll
[52:40] reveal that to us as well praise God I
[52:43] love the scripture verse 16 nevertheless
[52:47] we're - we have already attained let us
[52:50] walk by the same rule let us mind the
[52:53] same thing just so you know I'll get
[52:56] there a little bit in a few weeks here
[52:58] but rule means Canon it means a
[53:01] measuring stick a carpenter's line
[53:04] so Paul said everybody should have the
[53:06] same ruler right everybody should judge
[53:09] things let's judge President Trump by
[53:12] the same ruler we judged Barack Obama
[53:14] Amen Church right let's judge our lives
[53:18] by the same ruler that we judge other
[53:21] churches by Amen let's judge our church
[53:24] just like we do the Catholics right
[53:27] let's all judge one another by the same
[53:30] word of God aim ahead cuz that's how it
[53:33] is we all have the same ruler right we
[53:36] can judge everything the same by God's
[53:38] Word because that's how Jesus is gonna
[53:40] judge it on the day of judgment he's all
[53:42] gonna judge us by the same rule the same
[53:45] measuring stick
[53:48] so we're there shouldn't be many
[53:50] surprises on that day now there may be
[53:52] some surprise to us but there should be
[53:53] no surprises about our own lives because
[53:56] we've got a great measuring stick laying
[53:58] right in front of us all the time amen
[54:00] on our tablets on our phones in our
[54:03] hands we've got the measuring stick
[54:04] right here we should be constantly
[54:06] looking and examining us am i measuring
[54:09] up to God's standard for my life
[54:13] don't you love this I love the Word of
[54:16] God man this is so contrary to most
[54:19] churches right most churches that oh
[54:21] you're making the gospel a clothesline
[54:24] gospel or you're making the gospel rules
[54:26] the Bible just said it right there its
[54:28] rules right it's rule you you have to
[54:31] have to have a standard
[54:33] judge everything by praise God it's holy
[54:36] rules and if you love God you want to
[54:38] obey the rules amen ah
[54:42] thank you lord thank you Jesus
[54:45] 3:19
[54:46] whose end is destruction whose God is
[54:49] their belly whose glory is their shame
[54:52] who mind earthly things
[54:55] so we know how we know we know what this
[54:58] is the people Paul says their God is
[55:00] their own belly and they're enemies of
[55:04] the cross so how do you become an enemy
[55:06] of the cross you own to serve yourself
[55:07] all the time you don't take the mind of
[55:10] the church right the mind of God's bride
[55:12] now the Bride of Christ let's talk about
[55:14] the denominational Church I've talked
[55:16] about the Bride of Christ you take the
[55:18] mind of the bride of Jesus Christ and
[55:20] you try to serve everybody in the church
[55:23] glory
[55:25] he said but this the shame of the world
[55:28] is to mine and meditate on earthly
[55:31] things
[55:33] this mind just means to understand or to
[55:37] let your opinions direct your thoughts
[55:39] to the world that's what it means
[55:41] all's they think about is the world I
[55:43] don't think about the church
[55:46] right now next one we have
[55:50] 319 yep that's the sinners mind for two
[55:54] for two I beseech
[55:56] you you Dyess I'm not sure how if I said
[55:59] it right and beseech Cintiq II that they
[56:02] be of the same mind in the Lord so the
[56:05] last chapter of the fourth chapter he
[56:06] starts getting down to individuals
[56:09] imagine having your name called on the
[56:13] on the letter that they read and then
[56:15] it's gonna be there for all eternity
[56:16] well at least for the next 2,000 years
[56:19] right but it's on the record nice so
[56:21] deep Paul knew these two women never got
[56:24] a I've never got along too well I don't
[56:27] want that to be me I don't want my name
[56:28] to be on that letter praise God I would
[56:31] have the same thoughts I don't have the
[56:33] same thoughts as Christ I want to be in
[56:36] one accord with the Saints I don't want
[56:38] to be known for having a disagreement
[56:40] with another brother in the church
[56:42] right or sister
[56:47] he said be of the same mind in the Lord
[56:50] now of course this means one of them was
[56:53] probably in sin right or maybe both of
[56:54] them are in sin
[56:56] we all know there's people in churches
[56:58] right that have the wrong mind and so
[57:00] we'll never be in one accord with them
[57:02] right because they love the things of
[57:04] the world right we would never like a
[57:06] sinner is in our church we wouldn't have
[57:07] the same mind as them Paul's not saying
[57:10] oh it's okay to think like sinners you
[57:12] know or backslidden people in the church
[57:14] no he's talking about people that are in
[57:17] sin and they need to get their thoughts
[57:19] off worldly things and get them on the
[57:21] things of God amen ah
[57:26] thank the Lord
[57:31] now 7 for 7 just a nice isn't it nice to
[57:35] see this same thing it's beautiful to
[57:38] see themes as Paul's writing his theme
[57:40] of this church it wasn't like gifts
[57:41] write gifts was like Corinthians and get
[57:44] their lives cleaned up and get the
[57:45] leaven out of the church but their
[57:47] church struggle with being of the same
[57:48] mind
[57:50] yet they were probably more mature right
[57:53] they were probably more mature than the
[57:54] corinthian church because he doesn't
[57:56] have to deal with the gifts doesn't have
[57:57] to deal with you know
[58:00] you know sinful lusts like he did with
[58:02] the first corinthians or with the
[58:04] corinthians and the first two letters
[58:07] 4:7 and the peace of God which passes
[58:11] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[58:12] and minds through Christ Jesus
[58:16] I like that church let's take our
[58:18] thoughts through Christ let's run our
[58:21] thoughts through Christ first before we
[58:23] think about them right before we
[58:25] meditate on let's run all of our
[58:27] thoughts through the word praise God and
[58:29] then we'll have peace amen
[58:33] see the peace of God will come as we
[58:35] take all of our thoughts through the
[58:37] word through the word
[58:45] that's why I believe there's grace for
[58:47] people today even
[58:50] think about this church I think I'm not
[58:52] too sure this before but the Jews the
[58:55] blinded Jews are going to be saved
[58:56] they're gonna be given white robes the
[58:58] fifth seal tells us that well are they
[59:01] accepting the blood of Jesus right now
[59:03] no no
[59:05] right that they're blinded to it so they
[59:09] are not they're not accepting the blood
[59:12] right now but when they die where do
[59:14] they go under the altar the martyrs
[59:17] altar where there's blood there's blood
[59:19] on the altar
[59:20] praise God so if they live if they just
[59:24] live true to everything that they know
[59:27] then the blood of Christ will make a way
[59:29] for them amen and yet if you ask them
[59:33] they deny Christ and say no he's got the
[59:35] Messiah they deny him but the Bible says
[59:38] if you say that he's not the Messiah
[59:40] you're Antichrist right is that what
[59:42] first John says first Johnson who is he
[59:45] that the Antichrist the man that says
[59:47] Christ has not come in the flesh oh my
[59:51] and that power that just struck me
[59:53] sister Wendy I didn't even think about
[59:54] that beforehand
[59:56] anybody who says Christ is not coming
[59:58] the flesh is Antichrist and yet the
[1:00:02] blood of Jesus Christ will pardon amen
[1:00:05] and a wink at that ignorant right it'll
[1:00:07] look past the ignorance because God has
[1:00:10] put a blinding on them and the blood of
[1:00:12] Christ will still speak for there may
[1:00:15] man oh my thank God
[1:00:18] that's why the same thing will happen on
[1:00:20] the day of judgement the sheep and the
[1:00:23] goats there will be some that will be
[1:00:25] surprised when did we see you Jesus
[1:00:28] they'll be Hindus Muslims of there are
[1:00:30] all kinds of people as long and all
[1:00:32] different religions some heathen some
[1:00:34] atheists that can still be saved by the
[1:00:38] blood of Jesus because they did good to
[1:00:41] those on earth who represented the blood
[1:00:43] of Jesus amen because they had the Holy
[1:00:46] Spirit which represents the light if the
[1:00:48] life it's the literal light of the blood
[1:00:51] of Jesus Christ
[1:00:53] so they're not under the blood but they
[1:00:56] respect the blood they do good to the
[1:00:59] blood
[1:01:01] Oh
[1:01:03] not sure where that came from I thank
[1:01:05] the Lord that's why I believe there's
[1:01:07] hope for like Donald Trump
[1:01:10] he still owns casino shirts where
[1:01:13] they're strippers and all these things
[1:01:14] he still owns those things but there's
[1:01:17] hope if he'll repent praise God if
[1:01:20] you'll do good there's hope right
[1:01:22] there's hope for the Jew that will deny
[1:01:24] Christ there's hope for them if they
[1:01:26] live all that they know I believe that
[1:01:29] with all my heart
[1:01:31] if those Jews can do it if they God will
[1:01:33] immerse one of them got to be merciful
[1:01:35] to anyone because he's not a respecter
[1:01:37] of persons praise God
[1:01:41] now we did seven the peace will keep
[1:01:44] your hearts and minds through Christ
[1:01:47] Jesus now go to 8 here's the last one oh
[1:01:50] yeah okay so finally brother once our
[1:01:52] things are true what sort of things are
[1:01:53] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:01:55] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:01:57] things are lovely what are things of
[1:01:58] good report if there be any virtue if
[1:02:00] there be any praise think on these
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:06] this letter that he writes
[1:02:10] remember church don't forget chapter 1
[1:02:12] he's saying had the same mind same month
[1:02:14] same month and he ends by this is how
[1:02:17] you do it there's eight different things
[1:02:19] on that page on that scripture that that
[1:02:21] scripture verse eight there's eight
[1:02:22] different things you can meditate upon
[1:02:24] and meditate on those and it will make
[1:02:27] you new it'll make you live in the peace
[1:02:29] of God how many one live in the peace of
[1:02:31] God Hey amen
[1:02:33] ever God wants us to live a life of
[1:02:35] peace honesty good report right
[1:02:39] godliness this is how we do it we choose
[1:02:41] to think about the right things the
[1:02:44] lovely things
[1:02:47] okay so is that helpful I hope you get
[1:02:51] to see how Paul he writes the letter to
[1:02:53] this this is Philippi in this mature
[1:02:54] church but his whole desire all aim is
[1:02:58] focused on the spirit the spirit of man
[1:03:00] the human spirit and as far as we know
[1:03:03] this is the last thing you ever said to
[1:03:05] them as far as I know by history now I
[1:03:06] could learn more later right in the read
[1:03:08] that book I might learn more later but
[1:03:10] his last words we're to have the same
[1:03:13] mind think about the same thing I have
[1:03:16] one Accord that
[1:03:19] means whatever you're thinking about so
[1:03:22] you should be the same thing I'm
[1:03:22] thinking about
[1:03:23] are you think about the same thing I am
[1:03:25] are you am I thinking about the same
[1:03:28] thing you are yeah if your thing about
[1:03:30] Christ right that's that's his that's
[1:03:34] his message his message is everybody
[1:03:37] needs to think about the same thing all
[1:03:39] all day every day Jesus
[1:03:41] how can I honor Jesus with my finances
[1:03:44] praise God how can I honor Jesus
[1:03:48] in every area right with my family with
[1:03:52] my friends on the job how can I honor
[1:03:54] Jesus how can I glorify it like Paul so
[1:03:56] how can I magnify Jesus with my body in
[1:03:59] this life he said I could magnify him
[1:04:02] through death or I could magnify him
[1:04:04] through life the way to do it is
[1:04:06] everybody thinks the same thing praise
[1:04:09] God so am i outside of scripture if I
[1:04:12] preach everybody needs to have the same
[1:04:14] mind in our church you need to think
[1:04:16] about the same thing I you in my own
[1:04:19] scripture by saying that no there's a
[1:04:21] long something about Christ ready
[1:04:24] mystify breeches said sister Wendy this
[1:04:27] week think about
[1:04:29] godliness or you think about the water
[1:04:33] baptism
[1:04:35] think about the God in well as long as
[1:04:37] it's director the Lord right
[1:04:41] did you know Church from George
[1:04:45] Washington to Lincoln the president's
[1:04:47] called for over a thousand days of
[1:04:50] prayer and fasting do you know that
[1:04:51] brother I read that in the book they can
[1:04:54] go back and look at the records of all
[1:04:55] the presents they would have a day
[1:04:57] instead of like a holiday it'd be like a
[1:04:59] day of mourning and they would pray and
[1:05:01] fast for their sins for a thousand days
[1:05:04] that doesn't that sounded like what I'm
[1:05:06] talking about every like the presidents
[1:05:08] are saying everybody needs the repent on
[1:05:11] this day think about repenting and
[1:05:13] confessing your sins
[1:05:15] and Paul he's saying the same thing
[1:05:19] everybody needs to think about the same
[1:05:21] thing the gospel hey the good news of
[1:05:24] Jesus Christ amen
[1:05:27] I'm convicted by that I need to call
[1:05:29] more fasting days I need to call more in
[1:05:32] my office robear says the highest office
[1:05:34] in the world is a preacher now I'm not
[1:05:35] exalting myself above a present because
[1:05:37] I I couldn't match their intelligence
[1:05:39] I'm just not very smart but
[1:05:41] it's the highest office because you hold
[1:05:44] the words of eternal life and so I need
[1:05:47] to look at my life and say mine we need
[1:05:48] to we're gonna get our minds together we
[1:05:51] need to all be thinking about the same
[1:05:53] thing and that will produce unity right
[1:05:55] that will produce godly lives that will
[1:05:58] produce the kind of church that Jesus
[1:06:01] once
[1:06:02] well how do you know that because that's
[1:06:04] what he says in the next few verses here
[1:06:05] and uh Philippians chapter 2
[1:06:09] so let's go to verse 3
[1:06:13] make me joyful by all things about the
[1:06:17] same thing I
[1:06:19] start doing that sister when you I might
[1:06:20] eat Sunday I say listen everybody listen
[1:06:22] to me you need to think about this this
[1:06:24] week I'm I started doing crazy things
[1:06:27] like that maybe but it's really not
[1:06:29] crazy right I should I should seek the
[1:06:31] Lord and see if I should do that you
[1:06:33] need to think about the Statue of
[1:06:34] riverman this week or you didn't think
[1:06:36] about the unveiling of God or the
[1:06:38] masterpiece of God
[1:06:40] cuz we all need to think about the same
[1:06:42] thing the Word of God
[1:06:45] see there's some truth behind this I
[1:06:47] there's truth around all wanting to be
[1:06:50] in one Accord and thinking about the
[1:06:52] same thing announce that it shouldn't go
[1:06:53] to the other legal side you know
[1:06:55] shouldn't go to the manmade organization
[1:06:57] side but if we really love God which
[1:07:00] probably we do then we should be
[1:07:02] interested in getting our thoughts all
[1:07:04] on the same thing if we're Christians
[1:07:06] because that's what Paul says that's
[1:07:08] what Paul says
[1:07:10] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:07:12] vainglory I have the Greek definitions
[1:07:14] up here
[1:07:17] but in lowliness of mind let
[1:07:21] each esteem other better
[1:07:24] than themselves so strife is contention
[1:07:27] it's electioneering for office so like
[1:07:30] politics right like Biden versus Trump
[1:07:34] that's what they're there now it can be
[1:07:37] done in a good way right but it can be
[1:07:39] wrong too this is the simple way
[1:07:41] electioneering for office desires to put
[1:07:44] oneself forward
[1:07:46] so in other words I'm going to I'm going
[1:07:49] to
[1:07:49] campaign I'm gonna exalt myself Paul
[1:07:52] said let nothing be done through strife
[1:07:54] campaigning putting yourself forward or
[1:07:58] vainglory empty pride vain opinion or
[1:08:02] airs
[1:08:03] in other words don't have a great
[1:08:05] opinion of yourself right
[1:08:09] now remember in the first chapter Paul
[1:08:12] said some preachers they build their
[1:08:15] entire ministry on strife I
[1:08:18] don't want that to be my testimony
[1:08:22] he said some indeed preach Christ even
[1:08:25] of envy and strife
[1:08:27] their whole ministry is that they use it
[1:08:30] to end the other people right and then
[1:08:34] have stripe against other people trying
[1:08:36] to make themselves like brother Graham
[1:08:38] said the Methodists are all trying to
[1:08:40] get the Baptist in their church right
[1:08:41] the Baptist's are all trying to get the
[1:08:44] Pentecostals and prevents the
[1:08:45] Pentecostals are trying to get them all
[1:08:49] their whole ministries are built upon
[1:08:52] strife
[1:08:54] that's why I don't I don't try to
[1:08:56] proselyte and draw anybody to our
[1:08:57] churches I just say go go whatever
[1:08:59] church you feel that of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:01] to go to right that's what we're not
[1:09:03] supposed to do that and some of good
[1:09:06] will we want to have a church we wanted
[1:09:08] to preach Christ of good will
[1:09:13] want to build our lives and our ministry
[1:09:16] on the good will of God I want to start
[1:09:19] showing you a few things here with the
[1:09:20] Greek
[1:09:21] see strife workers Paul tells us are not
[1:09:24] born again
[1:09:26] so anyone that's purposely trying to
[1:09:29] exalt themselves and
[1:09:31] you know compete in a local church or
[1:09:34] church versus church there it's
[1:09:36] impossible they can't be born again
[1:09:38] because the Bible said they that work
[1:09:40] strike do not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:09:42] and the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] jesus said the kingdom of God is within
[1:09:48] you
[1:09:50] see Paul is saying this is not the
[1:09:53] testimony of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:55] this is not her testimony she
[1:09:59] doesn't work according to strife or
[1:10:02] vainglory
[1:10:03] pride electioneering
[1:10:08] but they esteem others better than
[1:10:11] themselves
[1:10:13] okay so see we got a look at all these
[1:10:17] words and see how Paul uses them all
[1:10:19] throughout his letters and then that
[1:10:21] brings us to this conclusion people that
[1:10:23] work stripe and vainglory that can't be
[1:10:25] born again
[1:10:27] now verse 3 Paul also pleads for no Paul
[1:10:32] please for no strike he said take a
[1:10:34] lowliness of mind
[1:10:36] mind set right
[1:10:39] he said
[1:10:40] but in lowliness of mine
[1:10:45] we own it if we all would have one
[1:10:47] Accord you must have lowliness of mind
[1:10:53] what's that mean now I want to start
[1:10:56] showing you some Greek here as well go
[1:10:57] forward now this is copied and pasted it
[1:11:00] from the lexicon on the table software
[1:11:03] now Church see they'll have one Greek
[1:11:06] word right this is a Greek word when it
[1:11:08] can be used in this case is used in
[1:11:09] three different ways well yeah well I'm
[1:11:14] sorry three times humility and then it's
[1:11:16] these are the three times and then it's
[1:11:18] loneliness of mind one time that's the
[1:11:20] authorized version there isn't it's
[1:11:23] usually translated as humility so
[1:11:26] loneliness or a humble mind right humble
[1:11:29] mind and then church as you see the
[1:11:31] lexicon it gives many different
[1:11:33] definitions now and I'll say like this
[1:11:36] you have to sift through the definitions
[1:11:38] to see which one fits the context okay
[1:11:42] so this means if you have a lowliness of
[1:11:45] mind you have a humble opinion of
[1:11:47] yourself
[1:11:48] you have a deep sense of your littleness
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] how many realized sometimes morally
[1:11:57] you're pretty little sometimes you
[1:12:01] disappoint yourself and you make
[1:12:03] decisions and you act in a way it's not
[1:12:06] pleasing to God how many could say amen
[1:12:07] to that amen yeah I have a I have a deep
[1:12:11] sense of how I will disobey God's Word
[1:12:14] of time at times
[1:12:17] I realize how morally little I am if I'm
[1:12:21] not constantly praying if I'm not
[1:12:23] constantly meditating on the word and
[1:12:26] studying I my moral ability is very
[1:12:29] little
[1:12:30] right if I don't study and pray and
[1:12:33] worship God in my house if I don't stay
[1:12:35] close to God I'll do things that will
[1:12:37] embarrass me so
[1:12:39] here this is what he calls a lowliness
[1:12:42] of mind
[1:12:43] he said be a one accord and in lowliness
[1:12:47] of mine in this humble attitude in other
[1:12:50] words like I better change my thinking
[1:12:52] because if not I'm gonna stumble and
[1:12:53] fall I better humble myself I need to
[1:12:57] have a humble mind because I know if I
[1:12:58] don't say close to God I'm gonna
[1:13:00] embarrass myself
[1:13:02] in other words I don't want to bring
[1:13:04] reproach upon Jesus Christ I
[1:13:07] realize if I'm not if I'm not actively
[1:13:10] thinking about it I'm gonna reproach the
[1:13:13] gospel that I claim to believe in
[1:13:17] other words I'm gonna bring shame on the
[1:13:20] message that I tell everybody I believe
[1:13:24] so you have to take a lowliness of mind
[1:13:26] say Oh God I realize I could stumble
[1:13:31] right here help me god
[1:13:33] help me it's a lowliness of mind
[1:13:37] that was verse 3 see don't let don't be
[1:13:40] don't do anything through strife
[1:13:41] vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[1:13:45] with this idea that
[1:13:48] I'm not careful I'm gonna fall short of
[1:13:50] God's glory
[1:13:52] he says esteem others better than
[1:13:55] yourselves
[1:13:57] here let me just give you an example
[1:13:59] here I thought I put up here
[1:14:01] here I want to show you that the lexicon
[1:14:03] is not the absolute real quick so if a
[1:14:06] preacher says now they might say
[1:14:08] sometimes it might be true they say see
[1:14:10] it's in the Greek that's the actual
[1:14:12] definition that may work on some of them
[1:14:14] and not all of them okay so the word
[1:14:17] spirit like Holy Spirit that's the Greek
[1:14:20] word church it has 12 different words or
[1:14:22] phrases that can be translated to
[1:14:25] 12 different ones
[1:14:28] plus it's got 21 miscellaneous you
[1:14:32] like they you know sometimes sometimes
[1:14:34] I'll use this fear word for like the
[1:14:36] mind like or evil spirit or the human
[1:14:39] spirit or the spirit of Christ it's got
[1:14:42] to be very careful how you interpret
[1:14:44] things
[1:14:45] right oh
[1:14:49] my people get in trouble sometimes using
[1:14:53] the wrong Greek definitions or Hebrew
[1:14:54] definitions they'll say I got it out of
[1:14:56] the Hebrew well which which one which
[1:14:58] definition of the Hebrew which one that
[1:15:01] doesn't just because you use one of the
[1:15:02] definitions doesn't mean it's the right
[1:15:04] one
[1:15:06] right here because here's an exact so
[1:15:08] yeah here's an example with spirit
[1:15:10] there's four definitions just for the
[1:15:12] word spirit like Holy Spirit and the
[1:15:14] last one says he's the third person of
[1:15:17] the Trinity
[1:15:20] so is the lexicon the absolute no the
[1:15:25] lexicon was written by a man as well
[1:15:27] right
[1:15:29] so there's a man took his ideas and said
[1:15:33] well one of these definitions are for
[1:15:34] him there's these 21 different words or
[1:15:36] phrases and here's four definitions that
[1:15:39] they often take and one of them says the
[1:15:42] Holy Spirit's the third person of the
[1:15:44] Trinity
[1:15:46] so see somebody could say see it didn't
[1:15:48] date Greek he's the third person but
[1:15:51] what is the rest of the Bible saying
[1:15:54] see Church that's why knowing books and
[1:15:57] intellectualism isn't enough you've got
[1:16:00] to have a revelation of God's truth
[1:16:02] about what is actually the truth they
[1:16:04] men
[1:16:06] so let's say like this you have to
[1:16:08] filter the Greek through the rest of the
[1:16:11] word amen you got to filter the Greek
[1:16:14] and Hebrew definitions through the word
[1:16:16] because there's no other word that says
[1:16:18] God is three persons not only says he's
[1:16:21] one person
[1:16:23] so see even as a minister I have to take
[1:16:26] every definition and make sure it
[1:16:28] filters through the filter I got a port
[1:16:31] through here and make sure filters
[1:16:32] through the Word of God as well
[1:16:44] verse three let nothing be done through
[1:16:47] strife or vainglory now what did I
[1:16:48] highlight here oh yeah let's look at
[1:16:50] this next part esteeming others better
[1:16:53] than himself see how program says this
[1:16:54] book is eternal I could preach all day
[1:16:56] on just one half of a verse I could just
[1:17:00] go down that thought of lowliness in
[1:17:02] mind I could just take that look how we
[1:17:04] need have a deep sense of our sinfulness
[1:17:06] in our flesh and our body and if we
[1:17:10] don't we'll exonerol think oh we can
[1:17:13] handle the temptation and will fall and
[1:17:15] embarrass ourselves
[1:17:16] you could take a whole sermon on that
[1:17:20] but see that's why the work thank God
[1:17:22] thank God the words eternal I preach now
[1:17:25] for what since 2000 for 16 years for 16
[1:17:29] years I don't even feel like I scratch
[1:17:30] the surface of it I haven't but I want
[1:17:33] to go deeper I want to know God more
[1:17:34] praise God and the way to do that is
[1:17:37] through the word because the spirit will
[1:17:39] always been decayed the word amen
[1:17:42] so with this humble lowliness of mind
[1:17:46] and I think how important it is how many
[1:17:49] message churches do you know how many
[1:17:51] churches in general where they really
[1:17:53] have this lowliness of mind where they
[1:17:56] come to church and they they want to
[1:17:58] think like all the other believers they
[1:18:00] want to be united and they realize they
[1:18:02] got to be so careful how they live their
[1:18:04] lives they don't call it they don't
[1:18:05] cause somebody to stumble and they they
[1:18:08] don't bring reproach upon the message or
[1:18:10] Jesus Christ how many people come to
[1:18:11] church like that
[1:18:14] I don't think it's that many a
[1:18:19] church sometimes it's our fault right
[1:18:23] but that's why that's why we sing right
[1:18:25] that's to get our minds off those other
[1:18:27] things that's why we enjoy the specials
[1:18:29] and to get our minds off of our thoughts
[1:18:31] and and try to bring ourselves to a spot
[1:18:33] of humility where at that moment once
[1:18:36] we're humility then we can have the Holy
[1:18:39] Spirit bring us the directions for our
[1:18:41] lives and how to active the next step
[1:18:45] right what he's going to reveal next to
[1:18:46] us because we got to get all these other
[1:18:48] things out of our mind right and come
[1:18:50] down to a humble say let's have to
[1:18:52] humble ourselves in order to receive
[1:18:55] God's Word because the way up is down a
[1:19:00] lowliness of mind
[1:19:03] and so that's how God designed it come
[1:19:06] to the house of God leave your home
[1:19:08] right live streaming's good but it's not
[1:19:10] a permanent solution right you need to
[1:19:12] get a way out of your home because
[1:19:14] you're gonna find other jobs in your
[1:19:15] home or fall asleep on your comfortable
[1:19:17] couch
[1:19:18] we're gonna go get a smoothie or
[1:19:21] something like that or a popsicle during
[1:19:23] the service I hope they didn't do that
[1:19:26] [Laughter]
[1:19:30] they need food sometimes but I'm just
[1:19:33] you understanding we gotta we gotta
[1:19:36] leave our homes right
[1:19:38] Martha or Mary had to leave her cleaning
[1:19:41] job or dusting does this need dusted I
[1:19:43] haven't dusted it for a while it's
[1:19:45] actually pretty good
[1:19:47] leave your dusting job right and just
[1:19:50] drive somebody drive so far god unless
[1:19:53] you got reward you for that well justice
[1:19:56] he wants us to leave all of our home
[1:19:58] behind thinking Oh everything about that
[1:20:01] just for one day out of the week amen
[1:20:06] and that's just like a small portion of
[1:20:09] the day leave all that behind and come
[1:20:11] here and get our minds humbled
[1:20:14] instead of prideful I can do it I'm
[1:20:16] gonna provide for myself and I'll do
[1:20:18] this I'm gonna do it and get past that
[1:20:21] and and get down to a humble state you
[1:20:24] just meditate on the things of God how
[1:20:26] can I serve and love my local church
[1:20:28] family
[1:20:30] or if God's calling me to do mission
[1:20:32] work how can I do that
[1:20:34] but we got to get out of our car or work
[1:20:37] mindset and life or just busyness
[1:20:41] mindset business mindset home business
[1:20:44] or whatever business and get into the
[1:20:46] lowliness of mind of a Christian
[1:20:50] and when you do this you esteem others
[1:20:55] more important than yourselves
[1:21:00] that's why I church I like to offer you
[1:21:02] these books I bought myself a book I
[1:21:04] want to offer you one right I bought you
[1:21:08] those Perry green but remember that last
[1:21:09] year about you I've ever gave everybody
[1:21:11] those Jason to Mars books and everything
[1:21:13] like that I want to I want to remember
[1:21:16] if I'm doing this for myself I need to
[1:21:18] do that for the people who con to write
[1:21:22] I'm happy to do that I love do that but
[1:21:25] I gotta get the right mindset right I
[1:21:27] gotta have a lowliness of mind
[1:21:30] I'm not better than anybody I'm nothing
[1:21:33] I get weak I fail I fall short of God's
[1:21:37] glory how could I help God's people
[1:21:40] today that's not fair what can I do to
[1:21:44] strengthen Diane's faith today
[1:21:46] what can I do to raise Lydia's fate
[1:21:48] today what can I do that's a servant's
[1:21:51] attitude
[1:21:56] now look at the Greek here for a steam
[1:21:59] better steam better
[1:22:01] now there's a lot of definitions to have
[1:22:05] or hold over one yeah maybe so see I
[1:22:08] I'll show you how I made bold the ones
[1:22:10] that I felt fit the context of the
[1:22:12] scripture better esteeming others better
[1:22:14] than yourself to stand out to rise above
[1:22:17] over top now that that could be yeah you
[1:22:19] know you want people to rise above
[1:22:20] yourself that could be it too
[1:22:22] but to be above superior see what I
[1:22:25] think all that person such a
[1:22:27] their needs are way more important than
[1:22:30] mine they're such a wonderful servant to
[1:22:33] the Lord I want to serve them I'm the
[1:22:35] least of the like Paulsen I'm the least
[1:22:37] of the Apostles
[1:22:39] I'm the lowest of the Apostles yet he
[1:22:42] was probably the greatest
[1:22:43] but he called himself the least
[1:22:47] to excel to be severe that person excels
[1:22:50] me and their walk with the Lord their
[1:22:52] needs are so important they're those
[1:22:55] needs are better they're more important
[1:22:57] than my needs
[1:22:58] this is what the lowliness of mind is I
[1:23:03] I can fall short I can make all kinds of
[1:23:06] mistakes but I'm gonna cling to God on
[1:23:10] this Sunday morning this whole Sunday
[1:23:12] I'm going to cling to and try not to
[1:23:14] cause anybody stumble and then try to
[1:23:16] see how I
[1:23:18] can meet the needs of others who are
[1:23:21] more important than me Paul said that's
[1:23:23] the kind of mindset we want to have when
[1:23:25] we come to church mothers do it all the
[1:23:27] time mothers you got those children you
[1:23:29] always put the needs of the children
[1:23:30] above yourselves don't you
[1:23:32] right thank God for mothers I
[1:23:36] mean they're pretty good at their like
[1:23:38] pros ethic
[1:23:40] because you know as soon as the child
[1:23:43] needs something they go do it you know
[1:23:45] they don't really think about their own
[1:23:46] needs they go do it
[1:23:49] but it but it's something that we all
[1:23:51] need to do in our church right we all
[1:23:53] need to have a loneliness of mind and
[1:23:55] see how we can serve other people and
[1:23:57] make their needs more important than
[1:23:59] ours
[1:24:05] how many would say that's a pretty good
[1:24:07] challenge to every church I would say
[1:24:09] that's a great challenge for any message
[1:24:11] Church denominational huh my where
[1:24:13] everybody had one thought and the
[1:24:15] thought is how can I serve people that
[1:24:18] are more important than me
[1:24:21] most people come to church say I want
[1:24:23] something from God I want something I
[1:24:26] want something don't get me wrong he's
[1:24:28] going to be blessed right but most
[1:24:30] people come to church like that what am
[1:24:31] I going to get out give me something on
[1:24:33] but Paul says we have one Accord and how
[1:24:36] can I give to other people
[1:24:44] it's not done through strife or pride or
[1:24:47] vainglory something through a lowliness
[1:24:50] of mind
[1:24:51] first form well finally we're getting on
[1:24:53] verse 3 go that's it oh that's a tough
[1:24:55] verse right
[1:24:57] for our flesh right in our mind
[1:25:00] verse 4 look not every man on his own
[1:25:03] things so this is how you do it so if we
[1:25:06] want lowliness of mind this is how you
[1:25:08] do it you got to turn your eyes
[1:25:11] and when you do that Jesus will tell you
[1:25:13] now look at somebody else right first
[1:25:17] you gotta look on him and see oh look on
[1:25:19] I'm so lowly Wow I don't look at you I
[1:25:22] must humble but then he'll point you
[1:25:24] once you got that right mindset now
[1:25:27] he'll point you down to look at other
[1:25:29] people yes Lord I can go help sister
[1:25:32] so-and-so yeah Lord I'll be happy to see
[1:25:34] if I can try to encourage
[1:25:36] brother so-and-so
[1:25:39] he said look not every man on his own
[1:25:42] things but every man also on the things
[1:25:44] of others
[1:25:50] so just caring for people's general
[1:25:53] needs a member Wednesday night we looked
[1:25:54] at that on the statute perfect man
[1:25:55] brotherly kindness is all about how you
[1:25:57] treat your local church
[1:25:59] how do you treat your brother in Christ
[1:26:01] right forgive them
[1:26:03] 490 times in a day oh
[1:26:06] mercy lord help us Jesus Oh
[1:26:11] as far as I don't know once it against
[1:26:13] me 490 times in one day I don't think
[1:26:16] anybody ever has so hopefully I haven't
[1:26:18] done that to you but if I do I hope you
[1:26:19] have enough grace to forgive me
[1:26:21] this is the love of Jesus Christ how
[1:26:26] many need more that love
[1:26:27] absolutely this is this is the the best
[1:26:31] way he can try to help us to understand
[1:26:33] how great is his love will even 490
[1:26:36] times in one day if you sit against me
[1:26:37] the love of God would still have grace
[1:26:40] to forgive you
[1:26:43] because you care about other people's
[1:26:45] needs once you get out of your si like
[1:26:48] this your high high mindedness there it
[1:26:50] is high mindedness about talk about
[1:26:51] high-minded Eddie hi - oh hi - you're
[1:26:56] thinking only about you but if God could
[1:26:58] just get us to low minded can you just
[1:27:01] get us to low lowliness of mind or we
[1:27:04] can start thinking about other people
[1:27:07] caring for their needs
[1:27:09] that's my turkey you know you can get a
[1:27:12] joy just by opening the door for
[1:27:13] somebody off right after church just
[1:27:15] open the door be nice for someone you
[1:27:17] see they drop something pick it up for
[1:27:19] them or if they look thirsty out in the
[1:27:21] parking lot go get a water for
[1:27:24] that's okay because brother a man wants
[1:27:26] to buy those for the church so just so
[1:27:28] you know thank you very mad if you're
[1:27:30] watching buddy praise God I just it's
[1:27:32] just a ministry he wants to do he wants
[1:27:33] to buy water for the church that's nice
[1:27:37] yeah amen - amen
[1:27:40] but you understand like that's just a
[1:27:43] simple thing caring for other people
[1:27:45] instead of thinking about me me me
[1:27:47] thinking about you you you and you and
[1:27:51] you
[1:27:53] holiness of mind
[1:28:00] and I'll say like this church lets you
[1:28:02] know even use your words just use your
[1:28:04] words to build somebody up just tell
[1:28:06] them something nice like oh I appreciate
[1:28:07] that song today or I appreciate oh yeah
[1:28:10] I appreciate your testimony you know or
[1:28:12] appreciate when you did this and thanks
[1:28:15] for doing that just try to lift people
[1:28:16] up praise God it's most time we just get
[1:28:19] torn down by the world right they just
[1:28:21] they try to make fun of us tear us down
[1:28:24] you know we should come here and trying
[1:28:27] to build each other up praise God
[1:28:29] comfort one another you don't strengthen
[1:28:31] one another it refreshed one another
[1:28:33] praise God build each other up care for
[1:28:37] them
[1:28:38] that's why you're not trying to clap
[1:28:40] when you you know when people make big
[1:28:42] sacrifices they drive three nap hours
[1:28:43] and they drive two hours let's clap for
[1:28:45] those people that's it let's encourage
[1:28:47] them cuz it's a sacrifice praise God
[1:28:50] uh-huh and we want to look on we want to
[1:28:54] get our minds off other people I'm sorry
[1:28:57] we want to get our minds off ourselves
[1:28:58] rather and look at other people we look
[1:29:01] to Christ
[1:29:02] looking unto Jesus the author of our
[1:29:05] finisher our faith he humbles us and
[1:29:07] gives us a low innocent mind that we can
[1:29:09] look at other people now a lot of
[1:29:12] churches since most people are lost a
[1:29:14] lot of churches will never achieve this
[1:29:15] I want our church to achieve this
[1:29:22] I'm resting on this I know you are too
[1:29:26] I'm resting I'm resting on Paul's gospel
[1:29:29] right this is what we're this is we
[1:29:33] anchor our souls on this this is what
[1:29:34] our church needs to become all the time
[1:29:37] it's easy to earn special meanings right
[1:29:39] but what you want we're gonna become
[1:29:41] every Sunday we want to be in this kind
[1:29:43] of church
[1:29:44] lowliness to mind
[1:29:47] so here's a good example with lowliness
[1:29:50] not sure here's gonna grab up looking
[1:29:54] Dex let me go to the next slide here no
[1:29:56] yeah
[1:29:58] army
[1:30:01] so looking so there's a you know there's
[1:30:04] two words
[1:30:06] I'm not sure oh yes mark is used twice
[1:30:09] and then there's three three times it's
[1:30:11] used like that
[1:30:13] and so look at he says therefore looking
[1:30:17] upon esteeming others looking on them
[1:30:20] having a regard for a thing so in other
[1:30:22] words caring for them when you look at
[1:30:24] someone looking to care how can I
[1:30:26] encourage them how can i strengthen them
[1:30:28] today
[1:30:32] looking unto
[1:30:34] every man on his own things I'm sorry I
[1:30:38] looking not every man on his own things
[1:30:40] but every man also on the things of
[1:30:42] others
[1:30:48] so let's Regis review real quick these
[1:30:50] scriptures the first floor Oh all
[1:30:52] Christians need to be like minded now
[1:30:55] it's not an option right it wasn't an
[1:30:56] option did Paul say well some of you can
[1:30:58] think alike and others can think
[1:31:00] whatever they want to think about no the
[1:31:03] church should come under the leadership
[1:31:05] when we all come under leadership of the
[1:31:07] Holy Spirit we all think about the same
[1:31:08] things with the same love and what a
[1:31:11] core one mind thinking there are
[1:31:12] servants to the local church members
[1:31:15] is that what you got out of the first
[1:31:17] four verses that's what I got out
[1:31:19] because remember he's writing to a local
[1:31:22] church right a local church in Philippi
[1:31:25] eleven years after he started it he only
[1:31:27] got a few days maybe with that maybe a
[1:31:29] week not very long
[1:31:33] and he's just pleading with them
[1:31:35] everybody needs to think about the same
[1:31:37] thing serving one another
[1:31:41] in church you know I don't feel bad
[1:31:43] going slow on this you know what cuz I
[1:31:45] know this is the age of self-love
[1:31:47] Paul said they're gonna be lovers of
[1:31:50] their own selves and lovers of pleasures
[1:31:54] more than God we need to slow down on
[1:31:56] our busy lives amen and get our minds
[1:31:59] off of ourselves stop loving ourselves
[1:32:02] so much it's art eleven other people
[1:32:04] praise God that's my I see it in my life
[1:32:08] Church I'm sure you do too I want to get
[1:32:11] my eyes on other people on how I can be
[1:32:13] a half to them I do enough loving myself
[1:32:16] right I take care of myself and I do
[1:32:19] that I do enough of that we want to see
[1:32:21] how we can love other people praise God
[1:32:23] and
[1:32:25] I know that's one thing I need to grow
[1:32:27] in I need to grow and loving more having
[1:32:30] this lowliness of mind and constantly
[1:32:32] loving other people
[1:32:36] so in verse 6 now finding the verse 6
[1:32:39] okay I'm about out of our good praise
[1:32:42] God that seems about right you know
[1:32:44] Wednesday's been going so fast but that
[1:32:46] this this seems about right about our
[1:32:48] now verse 6 who
[1:32:51] I'm sorry nice coupon
[1:32:56] yeah I'm sorry I skipped it
[1:33:02] I'm sorry
[1:33:07] yeah verse 5 sorry yeah yeah forgive me
[1:33:12] first time so I'm gonna give you a
[1:33:15] screenshot this is a screenshot of the
[1:33:17] Greek so each word as a line has a Greek
[1:33:20] word for it or words so verse 5 he said
[1:33:24] let this mind be in you
[1:33:27] so how do we all have the same mind how
[1:33:30] do we look on other people take the mind
[1:33:33] of Christ
[1:33:34] let us take the word of they take the
[1:33:37] word mind right take word thoughts in
[1:33:40] other words read your Bible praise God
[1:33:42] right that's that's the only way I know
[1:33:45] to get out of my thoughts and get them
[1:33:47] on to God's thoughts or listen to a
[1:33:49] sermon while I'm washing dishes or
[1:33:51] mowing or whatever I'm doing
[1:33:53] get the mind of the word praise God
[1:33:56] that's what I love this book this book
[1:33:58] says it shows how the first Church of
[1:34:01] Rome started all the corruption but they
[1:34:04] says ad anywhere just the plain Bible
[1:34:07] was whoever this Bible was it always
[1:34:10] started revivals Amen because just the
[1:34:14] plain word of God just laying there and
[1:34:17] somebody meditating on it and believing
[1:34:20] it will cause to come down and annoy and
[1:34:22] inspire that person to believe it and
[1:34:25] show that it's real praise God so no
[1:34:28] matter how many people they killed as
[1:34:29] long as somebody had a real copy of this
[1:34:32] and it was those actual words of God and
[1:34:35] decided and wanted to know if it was
[1:34:37] real and what did they believe it wasn't
[1:34:40] a serve god as long as somebody had the
[1:34:42] word God was there amen and God would
[1:34:45] start a revival and God would do great
[1:34:47] things as long as they had his word
[1:34:51] and Turkey you know as as they killed
[1:34:56] the 68 million right
[1:34:57] Smuckers glorious Reformation as they
[1:35:00] killed the 68 9oz it was doing was
[1:35:03] planting seeds praise God and they would
[1:35:06] die then those seeds would be brought
[1:35:08] forth right and it would produce more
[1:35:09] and more and more praise God in other
[1:35:12] words they couldn't stop the gospel just
[1:35:14] like Jesus died and the Bible said he
[1:35:16] would see his seed praise God amen he
[1:35:19] would see his offspring the same thing
[1:35:21] with Christianity the more they kill the
[1:35:23] more they kept growing amen and
[1:35:25] expanding because the life the family of
[1:35:28] God had to move on
[1:35:33] thank you Jesus how do you get this
[1:35:36] loneliness of mind how do you start
[1:35:39] looking at other people let this mind be
[1:35:41] in you
[1:35:43] which was also in Christ Jesus so we
[1:35:47] can't say well it's impossible for me to
[1:35:49] think like that it's impossible for me
[1:35:52] to have the mind of Christ no it's not
[1:35:54] because Christ did it he had a mind that
[1:35:58] thought about the word only the word
[1:36:01] because this mind first was in Christ
[1:36:04] Jesus
[1:36:05] meditating constantly on the Word of God
[1:36:08] and notice you have to let it you can't
[1:36:11] force I'm sorry guys that gonna force
[1:36:13] you you gotta let it you're free more
[1:36:15] agency you have to let this mind be in
[1:36:18] you you gotta let this scriptures these
[1:36:21] scriptural thoughts you gotta let them
[1:36:23] come into your mind open the door and
[1:36:25] let it come into your mind
[1:36:26] that's right
[1:36:29] okay so
[1:36:31] mine
[1:36:33] has all those definitions be minded mine
[1:36:36] regard all these definitions let this
[1:36:38] mine now here's the here's the
[1:36:41] definitions to have understanding be
[1:36:43] wise other words let the understanding
[1:36:45] of Christ that it be in you let the
[1:36:47] wisdom of Christ come come into you let
[1:36:49] the mind of Christ being you the same
[1:36:51] mind agree together cherish the same
[1:36:54] hues harmonious direct your mind to a
[1:36:57] thing so let this mind let your mind be
[1:37:00] directed to see to strive for to seek
[1:37:03] ones interest or advantage
[1:37:06] so let the interests of Christ's mind be
[1:37:10] in you
[1:37:11] what would Christ be interested in doing
[1:37:13] if he was in your life or if he was
[1:37:16] walking in your shoes what would he do
[1:37:18] that's what we must do let this mind be
[1:37:21] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:37:24] his interests his desires
[1:37:29] okay now I'm gonna go back I thought I
[1:37:31] was going back
[1:37:34] so verse six
[1:37:38] lost my spots I was using my Bible
[1:37:41] good example
[1:37:45] verse 5 let this mind be in you which
[1:37:47] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[1:37:49] the form of God thought it not robbery
[1:37:52] to be equal with God
[1:37:56] so we get the first four verses so this
[1:38:00] is what the first four verses said all
[1:38:01] Christians need to think the same way to
[1:38:03] serve each other right so we get cert
[1:38:06] this mind of a servant by letting Christ
[1:38:08] mindset rule ours and Jesus modeled this
[1:38:12] for us so
[1:38:15] we're going to have to look at the life
[1:38:18] of Jesus Christ
[1:38:20] and see how he got his mind in the right
[1:38:24] position and then that will give us the
[1:38:28] right understanding that'll show us how
[1:38:29] to get our minds there right and this is
[1:38:31] the greatest battle ever fault
[1:38:39] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:38:41] Christ Jesus
[1:38:43] alright
[1:38:45] let's reverse is six to eight who being
[1:38:48] in the form of God thought it not
[1:38:49] robbery to be equal with God but made
[1:38:51] himself of no reputation and took upon
[1:38:53] him the form of a servant and was made
[1:38:56] in the likeness of men and being found
[1:38:59] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[1:39:01] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:39:06] death of the cross
[1:39:11] this is the mind that was in Christ
[1:39:15] willing to die even though he didn't
[1:39:18] want to right
[1:39:21] willing to accept death and not just an
[1:39:24] easy death the most difficult cruel
[1:39:26] death imaginable
[1:39:28] this was the mind that was in Christ
[1:39:31] I'll suffer any legs to do God's will
[1:39:35] to give my life as a sacrifice for
[1:39:38] others he said let this mind be in you
[1:39:41] which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:39:44] now Lord willing I think I'm gonna stop
[1:39:46] there cuz I want to get into the Godhead
[1:39:47] here tonight
[1:39:49] so let me stop there musicians if you'll
[1:39:52] come let's stand to our feet praise God
[1:39:58] and I was tell my wife to since I got a
[1:40:00] song me and preach I better or my
[1:40:03] sermons though
[1:40:04] so I can have some voice left for
[1:40:06] tonight praise God oh
[1:40:08] thank you Jesus praise God do you love
[1:40:11] that word church you love that word well
[1:40:13] I just I love I don't know something
[1:40:15] about it I love going verse by verse and
[1:40:18] trying to catch the same mind that Paul
[1:40:21] wrote it with
[1:40:22] it's beautiful I can see how the church
[1:40:26] in Philippi is very similar to our
[1:40:28] church
[1:40:31] since we're still here we must still
[1:40:34] need
[1:40:35] loneliness to mind
[1:40:36] since we're still here if we were
[1:40:39] perfect we'd be gone right if God was
[1:40:41] finished with us he would take us home
[1:40:43] but because he's not finished with us we
[1:40:46] still need to have one mind one Accord
[1:40:50] nothing through strife or vainglory
[1:40:53] the lowliness of mind
[1:40:55] esteeming others better than ourselves
[1:40:59] display that turn your eyes upon Jesus
[1:41:01] that's play that here
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:12] there's something very beautiful about
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:42:20] [Music]

[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:45:03] [Applause]
