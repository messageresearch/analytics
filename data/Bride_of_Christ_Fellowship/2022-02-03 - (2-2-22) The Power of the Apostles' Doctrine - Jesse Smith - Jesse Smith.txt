TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you brother austin i appreciate you uh sharing that acts 5 verse 18. i was telling my wife that testimony you know brother austin told me about it the other night or monday rather i was telling my wife i thought what a good example of he just heard the word preached on sunday and then he went home and acted on it and i was like that's what we all need to do that's what i need to do more there's such a beautiful brother childlike faith just thanking god that i can suffer like paul like we said on sunday paul had his portion to suffer with christ he counted his sufferings a a blessing and then in the moment where he's thanking god i get to suffer god heals him right in that moment it's just amazing thank god for his grace hallelujah acts 5 19. acts chapter 5 verse 19. i will be mindful the time tonight i think i was mindful last wednesday i think i did i think i might have surprised everybody but uh just tried to be really cautious the time so lord willing we'll try to do that again tonight acts 5 verse 19. now just as some background this is i believe the second time or perhaps the third time i have to look it up but this was either the second or third time the apostles had been arrested after the day of pentecost and i believe the first time they were just beaten and let go but nobody the first time they were just questioned in chapter four yes and then they were beaten if i'm not mistaken in here in chapter 5 a phenomenon i'm not mistaken will they get arrested again and let's look at verse 19. and again i'd like to look at tonight the power of the apostles doctrine so just standing with jesus's teachings is so important as we said because if you align with the doctrine if you align with the teaching god's power will flow through you in other words if you obey god's word his power flows through you like we saw with you brother with that testimony acts 5 verse 19. uh let's read 19 and 20 together and then i'll read 21 myself because it's a little bit longer verse 19 let's begin on three one two three but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life they're in prison it's a second or third time and this time the angel comes opens the door and says i'm setting you free to do what to go preach to the people the word of god look at verse 21 i'll read that and when they had heard that they entered in the temple early in the morning and they did they did what they taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called this council together in all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought i'm sorry this is the second persecution yes i'm sorry so they're beaten after this yeah they're beaten after this at the end of the chapter so forgive me the first time they're arrested i think they just stayed a night in prison this time though they're beaten so let's have a word of prayer if we can't hear tonight by god's grace heavenly father lord we we've read your word thank you for this beautiful testimony god of childlike faith lord of the power of god flowing through our brother's life we give you thanks and praise for that thank you for healing him lord god we know you're the ever-present help in time of trouble we know you're here to meet every need lord god and if we'll just lord receive each word with faith and believe the word of god we know all things are possible to them that believe we've made many requests known unto you tonight lord god and we know you heard those prayers encourage us strengthen us here tonight lord and may we receive our portion of the word of god lord may those that need milk may they get the milk may those that need meat may they get the meat of the word of god because lord we need your grace we need your strength so father let your holy spirit minister now to each and every need help me to get out of your way and lord may jesus christ be magnified here tonight and it's in his holy name we pray and the church said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god okay so we'll like to look here tonight i just want to look at uh the subject of doctrine again but i want to look at the power of the apostles doctrine so we saw the last three services about the power of jesus's doctrine and tonight lord willing we'll look at the apostles doctrine so have your bible there in acts chapter 2. let's go we're in five but let's go back to acts chapter 2. now we know in verse 4 the baptism of the holy ghost fell on believer souls for the first time and the bible said they went around declaring the wonderful works of the lord so when you're born again church you will praise the lord you will praise the lord or you'll tell somebody about god's wonderful works when you're born again you'll be unashamed to do it praise god because that's what happened on the day of pentecost we know in other times they spoke in tongues other times they prophesied other times they magnified god they just glorified god when you're born again something uh will happen to you and you will glorify the lord in a strong bold liberating spiritual manner praise god the world will look at you and say jesse's drunk or they look at you say austin's drunk the world will look at us and say we're drunk but we're what we're what's happened is that we're taking full control by the holy ghost praise god god has full control in our lives amen at that moment and then we're going to battle of course the rest of our lives how many how many battle in the rest of your life to stay drunk on the holy spirit praise god in your mind now in your mind because in your soul it's always there god's seal there but to keep your mind transformed by the word of the lord that's a great battle great struggle but that's the great battle we're fighting amen that's what we're earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints praise god and lord willing out there in this message i'll get to just a few simple examples some of you might be familiar with some of these but uh battles that you know sometimes our church our battles will take years to overcome and if you've been serving the lord long enough you know what i'm talking about you may struggle with something for more than a week you might struggle with something for more than a month you might struggle with something for more than six months it might be a year it might be two years it might be three years it might be a decade but if you keep trusting god if you keep serving god god is going to bring the victory to you praise god unless that unless some something is you know laid there to keep you humble or something if it's not for that purpose god is doing it to allow you to learn how to obey learn how to trust learn how to lean upon his everlasting arms and learn to know that god has a season for everything just like a natural season this is a season for salt right as you see the salt on the roads it's a season for snowball fights that's what the season's for you know hot chocolate that's what the season's for but there's a time and season for everything god works the same way there's a time and season of your life for everything praise god like i look at some of the sermons i preached down there's no way i could have preached them 10 years ago there's no way because i hadn't experienced some of these things or i hadn't gone through them i hadn't read that in the bible or the holy spirit hadn't revealed that to me like that and so we we trust god that his time is the right time amen and he's going to make everything beautiful in his own time now you can switch over here honey i do have just a few slides here to show now in acts chapter 2 verse 4 they get the holy ghost and then the god starts blessing them by winning new souls and in verse 42 uh the bible says this and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers okay and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things in common if that's the way the church started how many know that's the way the church is going to finish right because god is alpha and omega that means the first letter of the alphabet the last letter god through all of it praise god and the bible does talk about god restoring at the end time god will restore all things praise god at the end time through the spirit of elijah which is brother brahm's message right and that points us back where to the bible amen and so if if that if this is how they acted when they first got born again that's the way we should act today so anyone that's baptized like our fresh baptisms here you know austin alina we should see them do this which they're doing they're continuing steadfastly in my teaching from the bible right and also our fellowship that's why it's important that we fellowship on sundays and go to church you know go out to eat together and you know meet up when we can on wednesday night we'll fellowship after church here just maybe for a few minutes you must do that you must continue in the doctrine the teaching and the fellowship and we have all things in common hopefully most of us are debt-free now by god's grace right except for our mortgages or something like that you know it's gonna be a while for me to get debt free from that unless god sends a miracle but see we got all things in common right working on a car or working on that by god's grace god's working on that it be the right time god's working on these things it makes all thing in common right and breaking a bread washing feet prayers communion we have all these things in common so i can clearly see how our church just looks like that church amen now the amount of miracles that's different depending on the number of people and also the gifts that are in the church we clearly see that there's gifts of healing in the church because people have been healed in the church there's gifts of deliverance in the church because we've been delivered a mind battle some of us have been delivered from mind battles praise god there's all these wonderful gifts in the church praise god that god wants to use that has been there's been wisdom given to us there's been knowledge given to us praise god we've heard a tongue right hallelujah we've heard interpretations about 11 years ago we've heard them so when god wants to send them we want to be able to receive them praise god and that if we want more we should pray for more and then we should live like we want more praise god live close to god see now i do want to say this i do believe there's miracles that apostles that they will do that will be greater than all the other miracles because there's something that if the apostle has the highest calling in the bible they would have to have some type of higher gift some type of higher ability and you find that's the case who had who had greater gifts than and miracles than peter and paul right who we can't find anybody outside of christ that had greater miracles than that peter would walk by and his shadow would you know god would use his shadow to bring healing to people who's ever heard of that you know in our day one time i heard perry green say that that they would do that in india we would go there to india i think even south south america or some sort south africa they would have prayer lines and they would just want his shadow to strike them and he said some of the people got healed when i listened to his testimony because there was such faith so see and what he knew he went to many places to start churches amen i believe he did do some work of an apostle to start some churches but these men that god commissions to go into a darkness you know where they've never heard the gospel of christ god gives them power god gives them anointing god gives them doctrine god gives them signs miracles and wonders to prove that jesus is raised from the dead not just talk about it but prove it my good friend maxwell lee it's been a year since he preached for us i think it was 2013 or 2014. he's a missionary and a pastor he says he's walked into houses before in south south america and bodies were levitating off the ground in satanic worship and he said i rebuke in the spirit of jesus christ and the bodies would fall down to the ground he said he was walking he was leaving that house and he said a demon-possessed person came running at him and he just kept walking and the holy spirit threw that person up against the wall and he just walked right and left the house that's his own testimony and this man is like five two now he looks strong but he's no great man and he said before he was leaving there was one more person that was coming to get him and the man fell directly at his feet and just like with brother ram fell directly at his feet and the man couldn't even move a demon-possessed man that was going to hurt him so that he's an apostle he goes places other people don't go i just think that's an important thought that we need to remember that that we if we have a calling in life we must be obedient and also if god's given you calling he's going to give you the power to back it up amen praise god if god's called you to a ministry he's going to give you the strength to do it praise god and god will not fail praise god it's impossible so they were baptized with the holy ghost instantly they said let's fellowship let's learn the word of god let's have all things in common these were the group this was the three thousand group that were just baptized okay now we read acts 5 be for our text rather and the angel said go stand and speak in the temple all the words of this life they went and taught and then they got arrested they said don't teach in jesus name in verse 29 but peter said we ought to obey god rather than man amen praise god always obey god amen no matter what man says don't listen to man if they're speaking against god's word go with god's word obey god's word and god will back you up that's right it's such a beautiful story now earlier actually in chapter 4 verse 20 peter said we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard and that should be our testimony as well we should talk about jesus and the things we've seen jesus do and the things we've heard jesus do tell others what you've seen jesus do testify to others about how god has done miracles for you how he showed up for you when he didn't have food or you didn't have money and god showed up and did something for you amen the angel thought teaching the people was so important that he broke them out of jail amen the angel of the lord praise god and that's because jesus said go and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father son holy ghost which is the lord jesus christ so look they were trying to lock them up the evil men were trying to lock them up and because jesus said go teach the angel broke them out and said go teach the angel was just repeating what jesus said amen every true messenger from an angel every messenger that's really a messenger really an angel will will line up with what jesus christ said amen that's what jesus said the holy ghost will do he'll bring you in remembrance of my words and he'll teach you what to say in that hour praise god let's learn what to say in this hour this is important hour for you brother austin and lena says selena so let's learn let's learn now what the holy spirit wants you to say on the next call amen follow the leading of the lord what does the lord leading you say if it's if it's if it's from the lord it'll be with the word of god so this is in the in the battle of the hour this is the battle trial so this is the moment lord i'm here to listen i'm here to learn teach me what i must say because you don't want to speak the devil's language you don't want to speak death the bible said life is in the power of the tongue as well amen speak life amen like when uh bang's dad had that stroke the his church came in to pray for them and to die but we came in to pray to live amen that we are speaking the words of this life and that was my whole revelation the whole time was life and death is in the power of the tongue so speak life it's going to be all right amen hallelujah jesus christ is going to show up he's going to make a way he's our waymaker our miracle worker our promise keeper amen he's the light of the darkness amen speak god's word speak life because the angel thought so much about their doctrine i'm breaking them out of prison so other people can be taught the gospel of jesus christ amen hallelujah the bible said they filled there go down to verse 28 acts 5 28 why were they so upset these pharisees were so upset because the apostles were doing miracles in the name of jesus and also they were teaching in the name of jesus verse 28 saying did we not straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold you filled jerusalem with your doctrine see and intend to bring this man's blood upon us what were they filling it with doctrine did they have the holy ghost yes or no church yes so you mean a holy ghost-filled man will have miracles and teach doctrine that's exactly what the apostles had amen hallelujah but today there's a move even amongst message people and especially the charismatics it's all about power god will sort out our doctrines when we get to heaven that's a lie the real apostles have doctrine and they have the word of god as well so do real pastors too and real evangelists amen and real teachers and all the fivefold ministry praise god all prophets minor prophets of course see so that means church the apostles were just teaching and then these signs followed them because jesus said these signs follow them that believe amen when you're a believer the signs just follow you see so they'd go teach they'd pray for the sick god would heal god do something great they would just constantly teach constantly talk about jesus teach others about christ and then when the need came up they'd pray or they they speak the word of god and god would do miracles amen it's that simple go fill jerusalem with the doctrine don't feel akron with the word of god amen hallelujah the angel of the lord commanded them to teach god's doctrine so the angel lord would do the same thing today tell us to teach doctrine now go to acts 13 verse 11 and 12. the power of the apostles doctrine it was so powerful the angels broke them out of jail to go teach the people the doctrine and they filled the whole city with it i'm getting ready to go do another run on the of those postcards one of those postcards from 2018 we sent out 2 500 postcards brother and guess how many people come to church too hey but i'm glad they got to hear the word of god amen because what if that was me i'd want a chance to hear the word of god too and the thing was one of them knew about brother brandon but just never come back we think she had some type of mental trouble but i offered brother i basically begged her to come back to church i begged both of them to come back to church but you know if the holy spirit's in your heart no one's got to beg you to come to church hallelujah but i wanted to know that we loved her and we wanted to see her again both of them so i'm getting ready to do that again i believe akron deserves a chance to hear the gospel hey maybe we'll put your testimony on there buddy we'll put that testament on the back of that card jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's let's pray about that praise god acts 13 11 and 12. now in this case brother and sisters uh there's a deputy and paul's trying to witness to him but an evil sorcerer tries to stop him from hearing paul's preaching right so someone's the devil's trying to stop somebody from hearing the word of god and look at verse 11. and now behold actually let's read verse 10 and verse 9 sorry then saul who was also called paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him and said o full of all subtility and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord and now behold the hand the lord is upon me and thou shalt be blind not seeing the son for a season and immediately therefore him a miss and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand so paul called down darkness on this man and he couldn't see for a little season and look what the deputy says in verse 12 then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord these are major miracles signs and wonders right only we've only seen apostles do these things right i've never met anybody that's called down blindness on anybody have you sister beatrice have you heard anybody call blindness on anybody in ghana have you ever heard that yeah i haven't either i'm just curious you know because that's a different part of the world you know think about that the power what what would you have you have to see visions or something oh god's going to bring down a veil of darkness a mess of darkness on this sinner this devil worshiper and he called it down and the deputies i'm astonished at this doctrine i'm astonishing this teaching the teaching is that god will fight for any soul who wants to hear the word of god amen that's the doctrine amen hallelujah in other words do anything do as much as you can to get the message to everyone you feel loved to give it to see because some people are just not going to receive it in fact most people are not going to receive the gospel so fight and pray with everything you've got to get the gospel to those that you think will hear it he was astonished at the doctrine and remember look at that church both jesus and the apostles had astonishing power and doctrine vindicated by supernatural power they said the same thing about jesus what is this new doctrine he casts out devils praise god same thing about paul he's calling down blindness he's casting out devils what kind of doctrine is this it's authority it's following the leading of the lord praise god i've only cast out one devil really here in america that i've seen face to face but i think we did six over five of them over there and uh guyana south america that's because in america most people first of all they're not humble enough to admit they got a devil or the devil keeps them from coming to church or they got a religious devil and they won't they won't confess because america is a backslidden nation but we know the one thing is true the blood of jesus christ will set the captive free if they want to be free they can be free praise god any person who wants to be free can be free that's the story that you remember the story of the maniac brother he was he lit there was a man in jesus day he was called the maniac of gattera and he lived he was a man he was totally naked demon-possessed and he lived among uh he lived among the tombs he slept in the graveyard in other words well jesus said i jesus got on a boat and he crossed the boat to go get to that man because brother branham and the bible says he had need to go to that man in other words jesus heard that man crying for deliverance even though he's demon-possessed jesus heard him crying over the space of that lake and so jesus traveled over there and the first thing the man did he run to him and worshiped him and then jesus rebuked those demons and the demons left and they went in the pigs and the pigs run off into the water but the idea is if someone wants to be delivered god will cross all heaven and earth to deliver them amen praise god amen jesus got on the boat and crossed the boat just to go pray the prayer of faith to deliver that man and the man was set free and the bible said as soon as he did that he got his clothes on and he sat at the feet of jesus and said can i follow you and jesus said no you need to stay here and preach amen jesus jesus forbid him to be a missionary that wasn't his calling i wonder if he was a pastor i wonder if he's an evangelist or a teacher or something like that or a prophet but jesus said no you can't can imagine you jesus delivers you and he says you can't come with him yet he invited the rich young ruler he said come follow me remember to tell the rich young come follow me but not the maniac interesting see god's got a different plan for every life may god just help us to see what's your plan for my life and help me to obey it amen hallelujah see it's not cocky or it's not it's not cookie cutter that's what i meant to say it's not a cookie cutter gospel like we saw with the joshua series every ministry is different in some ways they're not all exactly the same but god vindicates doctrine with power praise god now let's go to romans 6 verse 16 and 17. so it's the next book this will all go in order tonight and i'll try to watch my i never set a timer so here let me set one okay okay thank you buddy i appreciate that good can you tell because of that okay because the live stream good good okay wonderful buddy thank you i do want to be cautious of the time austin i didn't get a lot of sleep and i don't want anybody to get caught in the any cold rain in case the weather changes romans 6 16. know you not that to whom you yield your servant your i'm sorry yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness well see that's what that's what every sinner does right they yield to the devils telling them oh just lie about this right they yield to it oh just steal this it's okay just steal this or just go on your phone on that pornography website just go on that right they yield to that and they listen to that rather than fighting that off but the bible says we have mighty weapons of warfare amen it's not like we don't have weapons to fight back we shouldn't be slaves to say we can't be pushovers with satan we got to fight back we've got the sword of the word but see that's why they get in bondage and get addicted to sin because they let the devil talk him into it but you and i are not that way how do we overcome by verse 17 but god be thanked that ye were were the servants of sin but ye have what obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you hallelujah brother jesse how did you get free from all those addictions everything i obeyed the doctrine from my heart amen i opened up my heart and said jesus i'll do anything you tell me you've forgiven me just tell me what to do and i'll do it praise god i became a servant of righteousness instead of a servant of sin whoever you yield to that's your boss right that's your master that's your god right man like the bible said false preachers their god is their belly right that's really their god but satan must be behind that somehow they're worshipping themselves see it's yielding from your heart so first you got to have the right heart you got to love god you got to trust god and know that he's faithful and then if you love god you'll obey the doctrine you obey the teaching from the heart and you'll be a servant to christ instead of a servant of the devil thank god we're servants of christ here amen hallelujah but you got obey from the heart that's why a lot of message people they don't they don't get the holy ghost because they start obeying by legalism or they start obeying by well my i just got to work at it till i get it instead of love right love well i love the lord so much that lord you're gonna help me to overcome this help me surrender this because i love you that's the way to grow in god amen now well i'm gonna do this just so people don't think i'm backslidden people don't think i'm worldly that's not why you do it that becomes legalistic that person will not enter the kingdom of god amen you got to do it because it's from the heart it's because you love god you appreciate god you thank him for the cross amen everything about jesus you love amen and you become a servant to jesus all right uh romans 16 17. go chapter 16 verse 17. now hear what paul says you should do to false teachers so preachers that preach false doctrine here's what we need to do 16 and 17. maybe i'll get some readers back there hey how about it lydia and uh where's haven is having back there oh she's in there okay malachi and lydia yeah maybe austin and lena maybe all right romans 16 17. you want to read that sisterlina roman 16 17. salute one another with the holy kiss the churches of christ with you now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause the vision of offensive contract amen yeah praise god verse 18 for they are such serve not our lord jesus christ now church can the bible be any any clear anyone who preaches a false doctrine which people are saying dr no matter even in the message paul says avoid them and mark them that cause divisions by their false doctrine because they don't serve christ they serve the devil of food or whatever they serve the devil of self-love right they're worshiping themselves so false doctrine is a true sign they're not a real believer that's the real sign but see people they say well as long as they're in miracles they might be off on a few teaching things that's okay no they need to be right on the teaching and they need to have miracles amen you gotta have both praise god so it's the authority of the word of god that we stand on when we when we preach on doctrine because there's power in doctrine there there's power if you obey if they obey the doctrine they wouldn't worship their belly they'd worship the god that made their belly amen they would trust god who made them to provide for their stomach rather than worshiping their own their selves or their own situation being selfish or however you can interpret this of their god being their belly by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple see it's always with their slick words that's how they deceive people but really they're after your money that's what these false preachers are after they preach false doctrine so they can get after your money like you see all the ones on tv or they got infomercials on their youtube channel they'll have a little segment that's kind of about the bible and they'll say now here's three dvds and you can order it for a small donation of 79.99 they're after i mean those dvds they cost 50 cents to make think of all the money they're making they're trying to fill their bank accounts rather than trying to get filled with the holy ghost amen they're serving their own buildings amen and they're teaching false doctrine to begin with see so how do you treat them sister lena read it in verse 17 mark them i'm sorry avoid yes mark them and avoid them that's fine that's fine if people want to avoid you that's fine too but listen you got a right to avoid them as well people don't like us because maybe of our stand on the gospel or stand on the truth they might avoid us but guess what i'm going to avoid them too because they're preaching false doctrine and all my doctrines backed up right here by the bible praise god and i can prove it to you i got all the videos i got the books i got everything to prove it's the bible praise god it's god's word that we're standing on amen it's god's truth amen and god's truth keeps marching on amen hallelujah like brother man i said if a man loved you he come corrected well where's all the people that love me see the emotion if i'm wrong somebody come correct me but see they don't come because they don't love me because i'm right i thought they didn't brother branham too they couldn't correct him either amen see that they're afraid like i said they got spies watching us or something like that why aren't the spies come talk to me like a man man to man or even woman to man my wife will sit there with you if a sis for somebody's watching a woman's spy come talk to me about it because we know what the holy spirit has revealed we know what the bible says it's not our word it's god's word amen hallelujah well i'm starting to get zealous here by god's grace but see we we know the false doctrines uh uh are are from false teachers who worship themselves all right hopefully everybody can see that by god's grace now i want you to notice now now this is a whole different thought here now go to the next book first corinthians 14 6 first corinthians 14 6. and lydia why don't you read that first corinthians 14 6. now this is kind of off the false teachers for a moment because i'm just going in order to make it simple on you for reading your bible me too lydia go ahead first corinthians 14 6. amen never to catch yet the early church had lots of this i'm sorry this church the corinthian church had a lot of gift of tongues but did you see what the tongues give a tongue could come and give us any of these everybody say revelation can you say that revelation that's what serpents see this serpent seed is not a doctrine it's not a it's not a how-to right it's a revelation right the godhead is not a how-to it's a revelation right like jesus said about the the doctrine he talked about all the doctrines remember we went through that last week last wednesday night went through all jesus doctrines there with marriage and anger and all these things how to control your anger how to overcome lustful thoughts all that remember how to be blessed the beatitudes but the holy spirit can give a revelation everybody's saying knowledge ready knowledge everybody say prophesying ready prophesying and last one everybody say doctrine doctrine so a tongue could give any of those so see we have to hunger and thirst for the gifts to move right and then a gift a tongue would give us a doctrine can you imagine a tongue could come and say this is how to do this this is how you should fast or pray this is how you should know this situation this is how you should overcome your depression you know you'll give a doctrine on how to do it okay teach you something that you didn't know before it could also give you a revelation right see the holy spirit wants to give all these prophet signs revelations doctrines knowledge he wants to give all these things to us and but we've got to be hungry for them and we've got to be open to receiving them all right now go to verse 26 in the same chapter paul compliments them and brother branham does compliment them also the corinthian church in the church age book and brother brahm said it was good every one of them had these different uh revelations and tongues and interpretations so malachi can you read that first corinthians 14 26 please amen edify means building up so whatever you bring to church no he says when you all come together when everybody comes to church he said everyone in this church has a psalm everybody has a song to sing right every now and then we'll get a song special we appreciate that i appreciate brother amen bringing songs every week right i brought three songs a night or four songs and i just wrote my heart everybody has a psalm everybody has a doctrine see you can god can reveal a doctrine to you and you can bring it to church hallelujah the next one a tongue a revelation and interpretations but all things are to build up the body of christ all things are to be done here tonight to make you stronger praise god every word every song everything we teach should make you stronger in the word of god if you'll believe it but there's that that's that big if right if we'll apply it to our lives if we'll look in the mirror and not forget what we were when we looked in the mirror right remember what we are as we leave the building tonight praise god remember that we're christians we're servants of christ and we're learning from christ and we do what christ tells us to do amen now i did i read this one on sunday so i'm not going to go over this but remember all those out five outside the fivefold ministry are tossed like spiritual children and they're easily deceived easily deceived okay and i see i'll be getting on to that and more in the future i've been watching just recent you know church services from different places and people are just easily deceived they'll believe anything like one guy bless his heart my goodness i've texted him and talked to him a little bit uh he said the scripture uh before the mount transfiguration where uh the bible says some of you standing here will not taste death do you see the lord's coming remember that scripture that man actually interpreted that as saint john is still alive today can you believe that that would make him older than methuselah who was 900 what 79 there's people that look they read the bible and they teach this false doctrine and they say the reason he's still alive is so he can come and teach us the book of revelation well too late we've already had elijah come and open the seals with thus saith the lord amen and he said he said john's hiding out in some cave in turkey for 2000 years well that means he hasn't gone to church so he's breaking the word there because the bible says gather more as you see that day approaching all right and jesus said jesus never said you need john to teach you he said when the comforter comes he'll show you all things amen it's the holy ghost this is a man even that says he believes in brother branham but he thinks we need john to come back and reveal the book of revelation well i'm sorry you haven't been listening to brother branham too much lately you missed the whole point of the seals were to break the seals off the book so now we can understand the symbols now we can understand the revelations and now we can be under the anointing praise god of the eagle at the end time so we can fly above the world we can watch and pray and be ready for the rapture with prophetic revelation amen all right go to first timothy chapter one now from what i've read and heard first timothy is paul's letter to timothy to help the church at ephesus which is really going to be very interesting lord willing if we ever preach this book on lord willing i may start colossians on sunday just because we'll have two services i may do colossians on sunday because i've been studying on that book but anyways remember remember what ephesus was about church remember that remember when paul left he said i'm leaving you he said i warned you for three years that wolves are going to enter in and not spare the flock well here paul names some of the wolves in the in the church of ephesus right it's just a beautiful mind you're putting those together it's beautiful now we see what paul was warning about they're going to preach that you can't eat me or your brothers you can't marry and all these lies from hell they're going to bring in all these lies and corrupt the church all right give me 10 minutes here that's what's happened 30 minutes maokai 40. okay well all right praise god all right so let's finish this page we'll finish this today page right guys so paul is writing this uh telling the young preacher timothy here's how you stand against liars that bring false doctrine first timothy 1 verse 3 and i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou might has charged some that they teach what no other doctrine see why church can you can you understand this see why it's dangerous sometimes to say well i might not have the right doctrine but i got the right spirit can you see how that might be danger can anybody see how that might be dangerous that could also that can be taken the wrong way and say well i just don't want to study it i don't want to cause problems so i'm just going to act real loving what if paul would have done that with some of those liars in the church they would have kept spreading their false doctrine all over the church and the bible said it would have overthrown the faith of some can you imagine if i overthrow this i mean like last week i was getting into jesus whipping with the cords you know what if i overthrew this you know i'd throw it over and everything would fall on the floor paul said that's what happens when you have false teachers they overthrow your faith in other words you're not standing on faith anymore you've fallen from grace amen doctrine is so important paul said teach no other doctrine amen why because i got it from christ's amen and anything away from christ is antichrist and it's okay we don't have the same doctrine no it's not i mean it might be okay for you but i i believe i can have the right doctrine and the right spirit because that's what paul had and i got the same holy spirit paul had praise god because it directs me to the word here's what they were doing in verse four neither give heed to fables see just lies just conspiracy theories right fables cinderella stories right they gave heed to fables and endless genealogies right which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so do now uh i'm going to stop right there but this this no doctrine paul says no other doctrine it goes perfectly with galatians 1 which said if you change the gospel you're preaching another gospel it's another jesus and any man that changes is cursed see that to change one word to change one doctrine is to be cursed so church let's not take it lightly paul says teach no other doctrine he says to change anything you're cursed now what's interesting is i haven't heard any preacher lately preach out of first timothy chapter one you know why because that would make them change their doctrine and make them uncomfortable that make them have to say oh you know i'm sorry i said that about doctrine and doctrine not being important all those things they'd have to repent of that but you know what it takes you know you know what it takes to repent a lot of humility and that's what a lot of people don't have today because this is the day of pride i'm rich and increased with goods i got a big church i i don't have any nothing and the bible says you're blind miserable naked wretched and don't even know it now small church is going to have false doctrine too i'm just not not just because we're small or anything like that that god's helped us but it's the it's the attitude of the preacher it's the experience of the preacher has that preacher met the holy spirit praise god amen and if he has then jesus said the holy spirit will teach you all things amen and he will reveal she'll show you all truth praise god and isn't the bible truth isn't this true should we believe that it'll guide you into more truth it'll take you deeper in the word and you want to make a foolish statement like that where oh doctrine doesn't matter i just want the right spirit well if you had the holy spirit you'd have the right doctrine because the holy spirit wrote the doctrine amen hallelujah oh thank you jesus let's go to well yeah the bible says sound doctrine so let me find that scripture it's in first timothy chapter one actually let's read verse five because i want austin and elena see this too what is the purpose of commandments look at verse five now the end of the commandment or the purpose of the commandment is what so you obey the commandments so you'll have charity out of a pure heart so what's the purpose of all these doctrines and commands so you and i will have pure hearts and will be full of god's love that's what obeying the word of god does it makes us love each other more with pure hearts that means i won't just you know smile at beatrice but then sudden when i leave talk bad about her you know i just want to smile my kids while i'm here but then be angry and cuss at him at home some wicked stuff like that but no i'm i'm loving at church and i'm loving at home too hey man now i'm definitely more tired at home always a lot more energetic behind the pulpit just just just my children can tell you but i try to be loving and if i make a mistake i try to say sorry this is the whole point of a commandment so you'll have a pure heart and you'll have your heart full of love amen and a good conscience and a faith unfaint so real faith real faith when you love god you have a pure heart and you have real faith i don't know how god's gonna answer but god's gonna answer amen i know it because he's faithful and i'll say it like this he may not do what i want but i'll love him anyway no like job said though he slay me yet i'll trust him amen that if i die if i'm slain then it was god's will to take me home that's real faith ah that's the whole purpose of the commandment now look at verse 10. now here we get into some other things that are false doctrine the first is whoremongering which is any person who has lots of sexual activity just lots of sexual activity outside of marriage verse 10 for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind homosexual men stealers i'll have to look that one up i don't know what that one is men's steelers i'll look up in just a moment uh liars we know what liars are for perjured persons if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine so now you know a doctrine of the devil is homosexuality's okay that's a doctrine of the devil right there paul just said it sleeping around with all these different people having kids by all these different women that's from hell that's a doctrine of the devil whoremonger let me look this up men's dealers men's steelers is a slave dealer a kidnapper oh my ah what do they call that trafficking human trafficking doctrine of a devil get them hooked on drugs you can make them sex slaves right one who unjustly reduces free men to slavery and steals the slaves of others and sells them that's human trafficking right there doctrines of devils perjured persons persian means a false swear okay so someone who lies like uh publicly or something like that okay so we see it doctrines of devils but see we anything that's contrary to healthy now sound doctor means good health right and that means the condition of your heart is in good health spiritually so when you obey sound doctrine you have a good heart you want to obey christ you want to love him and serve him from your heart when you've got false doctrine now you have a corrupt heart and you your your bellies in this case your belly's your god or your your sexual drive is your god right or uh selling people as slaves as your god making money through human trafficking is your god see but sound doctrine will take you away from that amen hallelujah all right so let's uh finish this one okay first timothy 5 17. first timothy 5 17. why don't case you want to read that for me you got it can you do it is that okay or lydia lydia what do you want do you want to get that okay linda why don't you get it first timothy 5 17 yeah i'm sorry case you're my fault so in a real holy ghostville church the saints are going to give honor to elders that's someone who's older in the lord like sister beatrice it can mean by your years but it can also mean as a pastor because elder means overseer so elder has two meanings it's either someone who's older in the lord they serve god more or it's a preacher or leader of the church so if the elders rule well that's speaking of preachers they're counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in the word and what well then why is doctrine such a bad word around the message because people don't want to obey the word because they're trying to build message kingdoms rather than building real christians see there's my time that's okay we'll just do one more scripture so see church it's it's different than what we think right remember first corinthians 12 who gets more honor is it the public people or the behind behind-the-scenes people the bible said the behind-the-scenes people get more honor god has given them more honor but he said for those public figures who are laboring and doctrine the word he said they deserve double honor because they're laboring and teaching the truth to people that their hearts will be pure praise god that they will that charity love will rule their lives and they'll obey the word of god from their heart and not as a legalistic thing but because they love christ they want to obey the commands and paul said those kind of men deserve double honor well who would you honor who do you have to honor you have to honor your boss right i gotta honor my boss i gotta honor the well imagine double that honor i'm just gonna since beatrice is here i'm gonna use her as an example tonight so beatrice has to honor her boss right but she should give double honor to the elders in the church right like in ghana me too of course you know i'm an elder here but think about the honor you give to the world well the church of god should be above that twice as much twice as much if you're growing in doctrine and growing in understanding and growing obedience you should give double honor to that but remember not worship only give jesus worship amen honor just means respect respect them like i just put a video out about this today when i look at this there's no virtue in it i just put that video out it's actually doing pretty good but the point is an image is not evil it's only evil if you bow down and worship it right like i told that man i said i don't know how many times i've been singing and i look over there at that and it just really humbles me and i'm like it's almost like the reality of heaven strikes me i don't know if that ever happened to you but sometimes i go so long you know i just have mind battles but then when i see jesus and i look at his humble face like that it makes me want to cry or something because i think oh that man's he's in heaven right now but he's got white hair right he's got fire in his eyes you know he's standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks in other words he's standing with us praise god amen but you don't bow down and worship it we give honor to men but we give all the worship to christ and not pictures of christ jesus christ the holy ghost praise god amen all right let me finish with this last one first timothy 6 1. so what do you think doctrine's important or not what do you what is it what was it what does everybody think here yeah give them double honor no other doctrine sound doctrine because if not they're worshiping their bellies and they will miss the kingdom of god if they don't have the sound doctrine and they don't obey it first timothy 6 1 i wrote on here servants who dishonor masters blasphemed doctrine now look at that and false doctrine preachers are proud that's what we'll see in these verses that as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed now church i i haven't said this too much but listen paul lived in rome and church there were slaves in rome he lived in the roman society we don't have slaves in america but we used to have slaves in america notice paul never said break up the slavery system now i'm not for slavery but i'm saying look at the wisdom paul uses paul says if you're a slave he said give honor to your master right and then if you do you'll honor god but if you dishonor your master you blaspheme christ can you imagine it we all hate slavery we all hate it right but paul was not led of the lord to abolish slavery he knew that god would abolish it in god's own time he could have abolished it he could have said all slaves rebuke your masters and go free in jesus name but he didn't i'm not for slavery i know someone might spice this because there are devils out there i'm not but i mean people preachers talk about all the time paul never abolished it but he said you honor your master and that will show that the that christ is not blasphemed in other words you may cry and how can you honor a heavenly god you can't you have to honor heavenly i'm sorry you have to honor earthly people and that proves you honor the one you can't see amen if you can't love the ones you can see if you can't honor the ones you can't see then you can't honor the one you can't see praise god if i can't love austin there's no way i can love god because i can actually see austin i can't see god but if i love him that proves i love god if i love all of you that proves i love god amen i'm not for slavery but paul never felt led of the lord to get rid of it he said stay as a he said count your masters worthy of all honor that you don't blaspheme the doctrine of christ that's quite a statement and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort look he's saying teach this teach the slaves to serve well and honor their masters that's why i feel like i'm a slave to the bank because i'm trying to pay off this house i just got to be a happy slave i got to respect pnc you know yes sir i'll send you that money on the first of the month or whatever but this was serious this was real serious a lot more serious than i mean right now with pnc verse three if any man teach otherwise what does paul say and consent not to our wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he's a proud knowing nothing donating about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmising perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdrawal thyself well i'm getting richer i must be serving god better that's not always the case that's not always the case natural gain is not proof of spiritual gain amen obedience from the heart is truth of spiritual gain a pure heart is proof of a spiritual gain hallelujah charity love that flows out of your heart that's proof of spiritual gain amen not more money but it's can you love the people that god has placed you around can you honor your masters can i honor my principle right it's cool can you honor your teacher right nature can you honor these other ones that are maybe higher position than you are and manifest the spirit of christ to everyone in your life see any man that says you don't obey this doctrine paul said he's proud he's a deceived preacher he doesn't even know what he's talking about see the trouble is the message people don't read the bible more than they listen to tapes they listen to more tapes in the bible when brother brahm said they asked him how do i fall in love with god what brother adam say read your bible and pray did you say go listen to a tape no i'm not against listening to tapes i listen to tapes but how do you fall in love with god he didn't say listen to the bible he said read the bible and the church said hallelujah he didn't say you want to fall more in love with god read all my books he didn't say that he said read your bible and pray but yes are we going to read brother bran's books yes are we going to listen to tapes yes but see if message people ignore this they ignore the very mind of god then they miss the doctrines of paul and that's why they dishonor real preachers they dishonor the doctrine they just they disrespect the word of god because they're not doing what god said god said live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god amen let's stand to our feet i better stop right there because i could keep going
