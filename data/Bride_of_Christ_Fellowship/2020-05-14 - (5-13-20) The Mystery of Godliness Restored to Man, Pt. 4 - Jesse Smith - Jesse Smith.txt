[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I think one time I sang preachings how I fight my battles and I think my wife kind of joke didn't said that only applies to you Jessie you know that's how I didn't sing that verse tonight so write what I meant when I sang it was that preaching God's Word to the church helps us all fight our battles not that everyone's a preacher so I'm sure everybody understood that so thank the Lord let's um take our Bibles here tonight let's go to the first Timothy chapter 3 16 I like to continue on the mystery of godliness restored to man and then we'll read our memory verse from Isaiah 12 first Timothy 3 verse 16 I'll read it myself and then we'll read our memory verse together first Timothy 3:16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so we'd say this is a mystery that's even greater perhaps than others as we saw with Israel's blindness is a mystery and the jew and gentiles composed one church that's a mystery that's known to a lot of churches but this one in particular is called a great history just like the bride mystery and or willing we'll get to that eventually here in the next few months we'll see by the grace the Lord as we're preaching through all the mysteries defined in the Bible without controversy great is the mystery of godliness let's go to isaiah 12 verse 2 isaiah 12 verse 2 to down to 5 by god's grace alright let's read out on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my son he also has become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall you say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things this is not in all the earth let's have a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God hear my need is again for my family remember their gene have any father we love you we thank you Lord God for your mercy and grace this is how we fight our battles this is how we drive away temptations and evil spirits and Satan has an imposter lion who roars seeking whom he may devour getting in the holy spirit singing worshiping we know even from David's time drives away evil spirits so in jesus christ's name a this worship and this praise and the sincere love and devotion and the expression of our praise to you may drive away the enemy lord in this home and in there Lord God may your your presence bring fullness of joy Lord God for the joy of the Lord is our strength let us be strong in the faith able to stand against all the wiles of the enemy Lord so we thank you Lord anoint this word we've heard tonight and Lord let us receive it and give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name Church said Amen god bless you little worm here by God's grace would like to continue on the mystery of godliness restore to man brother Branham our prophet specifically calls this the mystery of godliness being restored to man in sirs is this the end time December 30th 1962 so that's where we get this doctrine from of course it's from the Bible first but then God's prophet preached it and pointed to it and then taught on it eventually with the statue of a perfect man and with all his other teachings and revelations you know the more I meditate and think about this subject the more I realized that it's one of the greatest mysteries because most churches have it all mixed up they don't even understand you know what genuine faith is compared to the gift of faith or the fruit of faith Lord willing we'll get to that tonight and I wonder how many of us understand that I trust that through this preaching you'll be able to understand it because church there's a difference between saving faith intellectual faith the gift of faith and the fruit of faith I trust that all of us will be able to grasp this and you know we know a lot of the principles of it but as far as looking at the scripture and being able to understand and to be able to grasp what the scriptures are saying I trust that the Holy Spirit what was to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord tonight when a grow go deeper here in this thought real quick it's going to really quick review because it's been a few weeks you know I felt Letta Lord to preach on the different things I trust those thoughts from that last weekend we're blessing about Deborah you know I thought it was beautiful the scripture how it says the time of Judges was the time when everybody did what they want so what did God raise up a mother alright children want to do whatever they want so what has God raised up he raised a mother to get him in line for he's God I thought that's just a beautiful thought it's so true as children you know we're born in this world right we come to the world speaking lies right as the book of Job says and so what God gives you is a godly mother to set you in order so praise God now remember well let's remember godliness is being loyal it's being reverent devoted it's being like God and Jesus said you can attain godliness the confusion is how much effort is required to obtain it and is it attainable and the answer is yes and it's attainable by all your effort and then we showed clearly from the scripture that yours we are all saved by grace through faith that's a total gift no man can boast but then based upon the love that we have if we continue to love God and surrender to God then we grow in love for God and then that love empowers our faith and that faith works so our effort doesn't save us but our effort is our appreciation for what God has done for us and so that must be clearly understood we're saved by grace alone then we saw there's two kinds of godliness there's the first godliness which is before you're born again it's the sixth stage on Peters a burger man or Wilin will be preaching on that of coming soon and then we looked at mature godliness is what which which is what Paul spoke of and really mature godliness is just a very fruitful experienced devoted Christian it's after years of service to the Lord you produce the fruit of we'd say a fruitful Christian life and that's being godly mature godliness Paul wrote about it often ok then Lord willing and after that just going over in the first three parts just to kind of refresh my memory as well and yours too like we said we took a few weeks off then we looked at how each of these attributes of a statue perfect man is a crossroad where we must reject something in our flesh or some temptation from the enemy and accept God's portion of His divine nature because when Peter says were partakers of the divine nature we looked at faith how faith comes it's needed to please God and we saw different examples of when it came like the woman who washed jesus feet Zacchaeus then we saw how Peter had to preach the the bad news first he indicted them on the day of Pentecost then preached the good news that Jesus died for them I'm thankful for that news I'm glad I've received the good news praise God now tonight Lord willing we're going to start by looking at the different kinds of faith and again church this is a picture this in your mind this is the first step of eight steps right on the statutory man and I think we'd all agree that most churches don't even understand the first step as far as the fullness of it they a lot of them believe we're saved of course we're not saved by works we're saved by grace through faith they'll accept that part of faith but then they'll confuse it you know with intellectual faith they'll confuse it with the gift of faith and they'll confuse it with the fruit of faith you know because nominal church is all the time we'll talk we'll talk about aw what such fruits of the spirit and they're not even born again how can you how can you have fruit when you don't even have the seed of God's life and that seeds not been quickened so you see especially the fruit of faith is thrown around all the time people say oh they got real fruits of the Holy Spirit will do they is their seed quickened and have they served God faithfully and with maturity and real loyalty to every word of God becoming more humble and then they're producing this mature fruit of faith after years and years of service so see church I hope it started to open up to you how deep and how how great this revelation is you know the Bible says the Holy Spirit searches the deep things of God so I hope the church can catch that that you know preaching on faith is not a light thing preaching on faith is a very important thing is something we need to grow in something we need to understand is that the gift is that the fruit is it my saving faith I need to get past my intellectual faith so it's a very faith is a very important subject it's a crucial subject and so let's start tonight with justification by faith I just want to reiterate go through some scriptures here because I've known also you know people have made it known to me that you know they're listening now to our services the different places in the country and before around the world and some of them are just fresh to the message and fresh to the Word of God and so and even our children know we have these numerous children in our church and they need to hear them they need to understand it and church is good if you're if you're been the message a while it's good it's so good to examine your foundation right anybody who owns a home you gotta make sure you got a good foundation make sure it's not leaking make sure it's a it's gonna last so it's always good to go back and look at that faith foundation praise God so justification by faith at the moment a person is saved and forgiven they're justified in the sight of God now Paul devotes many chapters and we're not going to spend all the time on that and read all of it but Romans chapters three four and five are devoted to faith and then Galatians chapters two and three are just devoted to faith then you know we see the power of faith in Hebrews 11 now that's kind of a different angle we could take because some of those are the gift of faith by God's grace so the word justification means to show one to be righteous to declare one to be just so this is a judicial term right it would be used in the the Greek language to say someone is just there's nothing there's no wrong against them now Paul this is judicial also because Paul says we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ Church every time we hear that it should it should wake us up if we're a little bit sleepy it should stir us up it should strengthen us if we're a little tired it should make us tighten up our belt of truth to remember that everything we've heard we got to give an account for we've got to stand before the judgment seat of Christ and Christ is gonna he's not gonna pull any punches he's not gonna treat us better because you know we're the Laodicean bride he doesn't favor anybody he's impartial he's full of love but he's impartial he's just and so we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ and we should desperately want Christ to look at us and declare us justified forgiving righteous not unrighteous but righteous just like if you want the judge in a natural court god forbid you have to go to the natural court as we talked about judges on Sunday but you'd want to judge to examine your case and hopefully if you're innocent and really innocent the judge would declare you just you're innocent you're righteous you're not guilty and so we should want same thing here as we stand before the Lord on that great day now I'm just going to briefly go over Romans three it explains how sinful men and women can be righteous it first describes man's hopeless situation in verses 10 to 12 there's none righteous no not one think about that that applies to Paul Paul was writing applies the brother branham any well-known preacher you and I there's none righteous no not one they're all together gone out of the way they've all become unprofitable there's nothing to do with good no not one and then in verse 19 to 31 he says where all the world is guilty before God because all men have sinned and fall come short of the glory of God so we are unable to be justified by our human efforts to keep the law will always fail so it's through Christ's blood that there is righteousness of God without the law amen thank God Jesus Christ blood made a way that we could be righteous because we couldn't obey all the lost commands it wasn't in US God is offering this to all the Bible said I love it the righteousness of God is unto all and upon all that believe do you believe tonight if you believe in Jesus Christ his death burial resurrection and what is what his blood means and represents and the Bible said you are justified his righteousness is upon you all hallelujah so by God's own design genuine belief or trust in Christ's sacrifice is required for salvation Paul says it plainly and he said were justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ it's a free gift praise God he declares us righteous as a free gift nothing you and I can do to earn it it's amazing race because Christ was a propitiation through faith in his blood so see we have to we have to have trust trust in the blood of Jesus Christ and the Bible said the blood is declared his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God he said to declare this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then there's no none of us will be able to boast because it's not our blood that's that's on the mercy seat it's the blood of Jesus Christ his blood is there for us it stands to cover our sins and Paul said if you believe in that you're justified freely that's beautiful praise God no man will boast you won't boast because the law or by your works he's an a but by the law of faith amen what are you gonna be able to say why should God forgive you because I believe in Jesus Christ I put my trust in Jesus Christ blood and when I when I trusted in it then I obeyed what His Spirit said praise God I trusted his blood I trusted his work and then I trusted his word if I trusted his plan for salvation Church can't we trust his plan for our lives as well of course that's the whole point of the blood is that the life would come upon the believer now the just one justifies the unjust he declares the unrighteous righteous no man can brag about his own righteousness because we have none praise God amen only Christ has righteousness so Romans 4:3 says were justified the same way Abraham was and that beautiful we can we can know that we're the friend of God just like Abraham because Abraham was called the friend of God because God forgave him because abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness he believed God and he just started acting upon it what was the first command that God gave him separate yourself leave your family so what'd he do he obeyed did he know every detail about it no could he tell you where his final destination is I know I can tell you Sarah white where I'll end up could he tell you that no the Bible said he went out not knowing where he went children you don't know we're gonna end up you might end up in Africa you might end up in Montana you might end up in Florida who knows where you'll end up you don't know all the details but you can obey God's Word and if you obey God's Word even in a young life then God sees you just as guilty as Abraham praise God because it's all by the same faith trust in the blood of Jesus Christ it paid for your sins and set your sins away your sins are remitted by trusting in Jesus Christ's sacrifice abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness God counts your simple humble faith as righteousness Romans the.45 says but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness do you believe God justifies the ungodly do you believe God saves the sinner oh yeah because I was one of them praise God and he cleaned up my life and set me on the right path praise God we believe that he he justifies the unjust David a thousand years before Christ foretold this blessedness he discs as the blessedness of the man whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered molested as the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin amen oh God thank you Jesus we say we're sorry we're trusted he his blood paid for my sins he imputes our sins upon Christ and Christ's righteousness is imputed or given unto us the Bible said Christ was delivered for our offenses but raised for our justification for he's God other he went to the cross with our fences upon him but then he raised with our justification praise God our total substitute our propitiation and then in Romans 5 he says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God with our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God so see Church we gotta stand in grace we can't stand in legalism right we can't stand the law likes one day I'm saved next day I'm not we have to stand in grace I'm standing in the grace of God the unmerited favor of God we must have the awareness that because I believe in the blood of Jesus Christ I am in God's grace I can say truly I see God's favor in my life I see it and I want to treat that favor with humility I want to recognize that and be appreciative of that and show more devotion to God and more love to God because I can see that I'm standing in grace I can see that I'm not at war with God but I've got peace with God Paul when he first got saved member he was kicking against the pricks he was warring against God but afterwards he had peace with God amen there our Lord Jesus Christ children you could have that too you can have peace with God we don't have to feel like we're at war with God we want to please him and we have that you know tension and desired constant pleas and but it shouldn't be a war if we've got faith with God or faith in the blood of Jesus Christ we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ so the word peace is you're exempt from the rage and a havoc of war you are not in a rate God is not raging in war against you he's not in hatred against you you have peace with God you're exempt from the war from God's wrath you're exempt from that because you believe in his son's death and resurrection praise God the Bible said God looks at us like pitiful children the scripture says that in Psalms 103 13 he pities us that's that we should pity our children when we see him make a mistake and we shouldn't call names and belittle them but we should you know of course correct them but we should have pity on them and know they're just a little fella they're just a little one they're gonna make mistakes we got to be there to encourage them and to help them the best we can because that's how God sees us as a father that pities his children they understand a father understands his little children can't do it so he's got to help him out he's got to be patient he's got to be loving so it is with our Heavenly Father he pities us he's patient with us He loves us we have peace with our Father amen and then the Bible says when you're justified you have no charges before God who shall lay any charge of God's elect because it is God that justified what sin can Satan bring up that the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't cover there is none there's no sin that the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't cover praise God thank God the Bible said Jesus entered into heaven to appear in the presence of God for himself No to appear for you and I children he appears there for us he's there for us there even now is he serving himself is he living for himself no he's there for us praise God he's there for Jean that we can pray for Jean he's there for bangs dad right who is dead he's there for that purpose he's there serving us as a high priest as a mediator as a lawyer he's there in the presence of God for us and he's able to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them amen that's why he's living that's why he's there for us to give us life to to forgive our accounts to clear our sinful accounts and to wipe them clean to wash them white as snow and to put his righteousness upon us that we'll have peace and not war with God the trouble is we war with that black dog right that's the trouble that's the real war we got right and then the thoughts that Satan injects into our minds you know we we battle those we have war against those but if we're truly justified we do not have war with God we have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ now let's look a little bit at Galatians 2 chapters 2 and 3 Paul again addresses justification by face saying no flesh can be justified by the law in the sight of God justification by faith is for Jew and Gentile being foretold for the Gentiles in Genesis 12:3 this is such a beautiful scripture let's read Genesis 2 3 or 12 3 I will bless them that bless thee and curse and the curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed did you catch that did anybody hear the word justification in that scripture no it just bless bless bless bless yet Paul uses that scripture to say that God foretold that I'm going to justify the Gentiles so we can understand then that God sees justification as a blessing right because he didn't say the word you don't say the j-word you didn't even say the r-word righteousness he just says bless him through Abraham I'm gonna bless everybody and so God's blessings is his forgiveness and then of course the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes later Habakkuk 600 years before Christ said that the just shall live by his faith his substance we must live by the substance of God's Spirit the trust of God's Spirit the the God sphere brings us trust right we must live by that and trust that we're not at war with God but we have peace with God and that's where you see a lot of people get discouraged in their walk with God because they don't live by faith we've got to live by faith the revelation or the trust that we have that we're at peace with God and God's trying to help us he's trying to pick us up right he's trying to he pities us he's trying to put a blanket on our sleeping daughter right don't get mad at the daughter falls asleep we have pity on her right the child falls down to you you stole them no you pick them up right John makes a mistake you try to correct it and try to help them out trying to show pity on them it's so beautiful God hid justification in the word blessing all the earth will be blessed all the earth can be justified by faith in Jesus Christ of course we know not many will see this law though of Moses served as a schoolmaster or tutor to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith so the laws works works works works works condemned condemned condemned condemned condemned but faith is grace grace grace grace grace amen love love love love love favor favor favor favor even though you don't deserve it you're studying together they're gonna get it so a favor favor favor so that law that constant condemnation taught was to point us to Christ where we don't have to feel condemned all the time we should feel the thirst of God in our soul member David said my soul thirsts we should understand a thirst and not condemnation we're thirsty for more of God and we don't want to lose out on any opportunity to do God's will we want to constantly be doing what God's called us to do but not under condemnation but under justification praise God that were righteous that were we're God's children that were we have God's favor we're at peace with God we're justified by faith now the last section of this is what brother Branham preached one works is faith expressed some say the book of James brings confusion to the faith versus works debate because James 2:24 says a man is justified I'm sorry you see how that by works a man is justified and not by faith alone so just looking at that scripture it could be confusing so some argue that faith alone is not enough to save a sinner because James writes a man is justified by works and not by faith alone but if you read James 2 in context he's rebuking dead faith so faith that's not alive right meaning a faith confession intellectual human faith that has no action behind it no love - it doesn't have any life to it so empty words without action is really an absence of faith it's not real genuine faith and the exam James Gibbs is a Christian who who sees another Christian whose cold and hungry and says I hope you get food and hope you get warm but doesn't do anything to help him out he said but a real faith filled Christian will give food and clothing to that starving cold Christian so as brother Graham taught us James and Paul perfectly agree right they have to agree because real faith does work the Bible says faith works by love so when you have that right definition that's why I believe that was such a revelation the Lord gave me a couple years ago faith worketh by love the first thing gotta have is love you know love the goodness of God the goodness of God leads you to repentance you love what Jesus did you love how he took your place you love how he shed his blood although it breaks your heart but you because you love you believe and then because you believe you act you obey you work for the kingdom of God so it's important to again point that out that basically James is saying it's through works a man is justified in other words he means it's through love that causes faith to work and not just be a human confession of human intellectual faith praise God everybody catching that by God's grace all right beautiful [Applause] all right now I want to move into I want to maybe I get to a couple more parts here I'm gonna do okay let me go about half hour more I wanna look at intellectual human faith briefly so every human being possesses intellectual human faith now this is different from God's saving faith or the divine faith we'd say it's different than the gift of faith God's saving faith as part of the divine nature right so it's a further anointing of the Holy Spirit the faith is the first anointing of the Holy Spirit as you get more and more of God's divine nature and this is the same faith Jesus Christ possesses it's Christ's faith that is added to the Christian as a gift just as Peter said each character quality must be added to the believer add to your faith virtue so you must be added right must be imparted or given remember Paul said he lived by Christ's supernatural faith so see Church even a foolish virgin all anyone who saved is living by the faith of Jesus Christ because it's Christ's spirit it's that initial anointing when you're saved you'll get justified and you live by genuine faith Galatians 2:20 Paul says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me that ought to make you feel pretty good you got baptized you're serving God all these years you're living not by your faith by Christ's faith amen hallelujah thank you Jesus his own faith said Paul recognize that it's his faith living in me it's what I've received not my faith it's his faith because with his human faith right he persecuted Christians he drugged them to jail but with Christ faith he himself was jailed for preaching the gospel so human faith is just the ability to acknowledge truth it's not saving faith it's just intellectual human faith to just acknowledge that's the truth and that's proven in Hebrews 10 CH 1 six and 27 now listen this is a really good scripture for if we sin willfully after we received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries so see it's plainly stated in Hebrews intellectual human faith is just acknowledging the truth just saying oh ah that's right I believe that anybody can do that because that's given to everybody but if you do despite that or if you do contrary to what you know the truth is then that is unbelief and that's worthy of hell because you're not living for the truth I'm so glad we can live for the truth jesus said thy Word is truth this word is 100% truth praise God we live for that so intellectual human faith just says well that's the truth but it doesn't accept it it doesn't love it it doesn't act upon it with faith working remember when Nicodemus came to Jesus in John 3 he admitted that all the the Sanhedrin Council had human faith right he said rabbi we know you're a teacher come from God because no man can do those miracles except God be with him see they all had intellectual faith they knew that this man this young rabbi was different because he did things that had never been done before open the eyes of the blind and so forth and church even Muslims you know this even Muslims say Jesus is a prophet even they can acknowledge the truth but they say Muhammad is the last and greatest prophet but they say Jesus is a prophet they recognize that a lot of them know some New Testament Scriptures well where do they fail they fail on the blood that's right they don't accept the blood so then they don't accept real spiritual divine faith see they don't have that trust in the blood of Jesus Christ they're actually hoping that Allah Allah will save them after they die and the only guarantee they haves if they're a martyr which is a selfish way to die for them to you know kill blow themselves up with a bomb or real crash a plane that's the that's in their religion that's the only guarantee they have of eternal life but thank God we have the guarantee of eternal life now we have peace with God we're justified by faith God remits all of our sins through the blood of Jesus Christ amen so see human faith acknowledging truth is not enough for salvation it requires repentance from sin because if you love God's righteousness you'll hate the Antichrist spirit if you love the Spirit of God you'll hate the Antichrist spear so repentance from sin automatically comes when you genuinely have real faith in Jesus Christ blood and then there's this thought just so we can see clearly the men and the Pharisee sanhedrin of Jesus day they had human faith right intellectual human faith and then church even angels have intellectual faith the member James 2:19 now believe us that there's one God thou doest well the Devils also believe in tremble see angels fallen angels now demons have the intellectual capacity to believe in Christ and can even sense his holy presence and tremble at it but yet they disobeyed Christ or we'd say they disobeyed a Michaels command in heaven I don't believe Michael was Christ Michael Michael may have been a pre figure of Christ but I don't believe personally Michael was Christ and I preached on that before but and then in Luke 434 an unclean devil was crying out to Jesus he said I know thee who thou art the Holy One of God so see they both they have intellectual faith and we'd save in Supernatural because they're supernatural beings right but Jude 1:6 says the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day so see many of them are already reserved they're awaiting judgment yet they have intellectual faith yet they tremble the presence of God you see it's so important and this is what separates our message from denominations and non denominations that believe just regular false Christian doctrine we can see how there's a human faith but that's not sufficient for salvation there has to be a repentance and a reception of God's Spirit a smaller portion of God's Spirit which is faith its Christ's own faith and then you get virtue and all these other attributes of the Holy Spirit - - you get capped off and seal with the Holy Spirit that's what separates us that we can distinguish the numerous types of faith and that's not the pat ourselves on the back it's just to say we are one of those in Revelation 10 that have heard the prophecy again the open books been taken and it's been preaching this book prophesied all around the world we're just blessed to be able to have her to praise God and receive it and eating it and becoming that word okay so I got a few more minutes here let me check my timer here okay about 20 more minutes let's try to get the the gift of faith turning you got your Bibles here I'll have some readers here I kind of wanted to go through those other subjects a little quicker I want to spend a little more time well the next 20 minutes on the gift of faith Lord willing children how remember how many how many gifts of the Spirit are there I'm very good now I guess in the Holy Spirit praise God there's nine gifts of the Holy Spirit there's wisdom and well and this is the order wisdom so brother man tells us wisdom is the most important gift of all wisdom knowledge faith healing miracles prophecy discerning of spirits diverse kinds of tongues and interpretations and tongues okay so now we're showing a different kind of faith this is not saving faith this is a gift of faith all right and of course this is listed in 1st Corinthians 12:1 - 11 here's what the word gift means in the Greek it's favored with which one receives without any merit of his own it's grace or gifts denoting extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians and 1/8 and abling them to serve the Church of Christ Wow so saving faith is different that's Christ's own faith to believe and trust in God and trust in the blood of Jesus Christ but the gift of faith is a special ability you have that gives you an extraordinary power and you have it so you can serve others alright okay so let's have a Lydia mark 11:23 maokai first corinthians 13 - now I will try to be try to be able to define the gift of faith in maybe more biblical words that were familiar with like I said a supernatural ability but through these scriptures I want to give it a definition that you and I can start to understand so Lydia mark 11:23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and show that down his heart but shall believe that those things when she says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says amen and then Acacia listen Milka Milka first Corinthians 13 - so I'm going to commit and though I have the gift of prophecy prophecy and I understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing okay so based upon these scriptures I hope you caught the key word was mountain right faith are the words of faith and mountain were the key words rather the gift of faith I think a good Bible definition is power to remove obstacles figuratively described as mountains by speaking God's word at his leading okay so I think that's a little bit better you know we just talked about the gift of faith if we define it it's a lot easier oh it's mountain-moving ability right I think it's a good way to say don't you if there's an obstacle in your way and and God God gives you the supernatural ability to speak to that mountain and watch it move now I gave that testimony that's what we did church with Lee bang and who is dad I was on the phone with brother amen and I just remember looking out towards the west now if I was looking east I said I speak against that mount in the name of Jesus Christ and I didn't remember exactly what I say Amen might remember better I didn't know if I said come out of the hospital or just get well or get his full strength back when I just spoke to the mountain of a heart trouble and commanded it to move and by God's grace weathervane says it's a miracle so bang was telling me on Sunday after church too that the doctors at one point had told him that they have the option of unplugging the breathing machine so basically saying they could let his dad die but we kept believing we kept speaking God's Word there's life in the in the power of the tongue praise God when God leads us to do it and so now man can rejoice and who can rejoice in what van calls a miracle so thank God for that okay so defining the gift of faith is now this supernatural ability to get under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and that is leading speak God's Word and then obstacles are removed mountains are taken out of the way now two examples are really clear Asia can you get X 14 eight I'm gonna start with the first example application read the second the first example is the Roman centurion in Matthew chapter 8 1 to 13 and what a beautiful example he the Centurion comes to Christ for healing of a sick servant he was suffering from paralysis at least according to the Greek Jesus agreed he said I'll come to your house heal the servant but the Centurion said he only needed to speak the word only for the servant to be healed Jesus marvel that is great faith and said as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee the Centurions great faith in Christ spoken from his anointed heart to Christ cause the Savior to speak the word moving the mountain of paralysis in the self-same our praise God okay that's one clear example right of mountain-moving faith Jesus and speak it and then the Syrians that you speak it I've got faith in your word that's what we should say I've got faith in God's Word amen that's one clear example so can anybody see that turn as you get older and you're under the anointing of the Holy Spirit you may do that you just speak to a problem and it'll move the problem will remove I've seen like we said we've seen that numerous cases with the two women that couldn't have babies Tom Atkinson and now bangs father just speaking the word and obstacles move mountains move that's God power behind his word amen so acacia can you read Acts fourteen eight let's look at Paul he was in Lystra which is modern-day Turkey and he operates a gift of faith I never walked through the next scripture the same heart Paul speak who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed that scripture said with a loud voice stand up right on my feet and he leaped and walked amen how could Paul tell a man who's never walked before to get up and walk how could he do that he had to have super powers right well he did he had a gift that's what Hollywood is busy trying to impersonate with Avengers and spider-man and Batman and Superman they're just trying to impersonate the gifts of the Holy Spirit and they're doing an awful job of it because they give Satan all the glory but Paul had that power Paul stood stand up in the name of Jesus Christ and he leaped up and walked oh it's glorious hallelujah so Paul's gift of faith operated on a crippled man who never walked impotent his feet see it was through mountain-moving faith that allowed the man's obstacle his crippled NISS to move all because paul spoke the word and the gift of faith operated praise God like I said Church we start seeing the dead in Christ rise we're gonna be able to speak God's Word we're gonna have such faith it all things are possible to them that believe will be under such an anointing we're thankful we can get under that anointing a little bit of that anointing today thank God but also gonna take is more of God's Spirit praise God the time and season of the rapture okay so a little more on this so the gift of faith is different from saving faith because the gift is always in a person's life even before they're saved and that's where our children that's why what my children know you've got a gift laying in your life and it can operate even before you're saved because gifts the Bible said the gifts and callings of God are without repentance so God places the gift or the supernatural ability in your human spirit right you can't go in to your soul because if you're lost and God curses in himself it's gotta go in your human spirit won't go in your body it's you don't have any ability in your body it's ask me a spiritual power it has to be in your human spirit so even before a person is saved they already have a gift whether it's faith or wisdom or speaking in tongues or interpretation and prophecy one of those nine gifts is laying in every person's life because the Bible said the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man not some to every man to profit withal as first grampians 12 7 and all these worketh that one in the self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so we can't we can't bargain with God for the gift we want we just got to understand and observe and get under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and see what God does through us now many times search gets don't operate because the people don't pray long enough that's scriptural remember Jude said praying in the Holy Ghost building up your most holy faith if someone in our church doesn't know their gifts may God help you to pray more because as you pray that the Holy Spirit anoints you more and then God can use you then you'll see the gift of God whether it's speaking of obstacles and mountains move whether it's laying hands on the sick recovery or dreaming and prophesying foretelling things to come but it's through prayer in the Holy Spirit that God builds up your faith praise God and builds up the anointing on on your life that then God can use you now some states have our Saints rather have multiple gifts like Paul remember we showed he had all the five preaching gifts three of them are clearly proven by Scripture meaning and by history had to have the other ones but Paul Paul prophesied of the rapture he had a gift of healing spoken tongues and had the gift of faith because he spoke that word right there to the crippled man it's right there just four out of the nine imagine we can look back at that list and no doubt he had discernment right he could judge between the spirits no doubt about that miracles healing knowledge oh if anybody had knowledge or than a word of understanding hadn't been Paul praise God's all right so hopefully church by God's grace that get after the holy spirit lays in your human spirit so your body lays sin right thus in nature that's Romans 7:18 2:23 Paul said sin is in my members so your body is sin your human mind gets a gift and it's supernatural ability or your soul gets the Holy Ghost see oh praise God it's the life of Christ Christ in you the hope of glory so the the complete anointing of the Holy Spirit you're in your nature you get a new nature praise God see each part has something in it sin sin gift seal his nature and then this nature guides all the other ones so that so let me say this the nature of your words to each other is seen I'm sorry how you what you speak and how you treat each other we can see what nature's in you praise God because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh okay that's why it's so important to have the Holy Ghost you have God's divine nature all right so I got eight minutes here let me finish with this thought here gifts are given to every person Romans 11:29 the gifts and callings of God are without repentance Church think about that you have a built-in component you have a built-in superpower you do you have a built-in superpower but you gotta learn to use it fairies guys gotta learn to operate it that's what I think happened with with I see that in my life I stay under that anointing stander the word keep that meditate on that word and God can use me to speak that speak God's word learning trying to learn how to stay under that channel another way to say it is like a tail it's like God giving you that money right because the TL is like Jesus described he gave everybody everybody got tail in the parable Matthew 25:14 2:30 everybody got a talent these were very valuable talents we looked at that a couple times just like faith is so valuable and Jesus Christ is the one that gives it to us he gives us something very valuable very valuable it's a superpower that you have and God will use it as your yielded to him this just kind of came to my mind member God Balaam knew God would meet with him if he just made those sacrifices and children I should encourage us God will meet with you if you just make the right sacrifices study pray repent humble yourself be kind of another all throughout the day think about God's Spirit think about God moving think about God used me too is there anybody sick is there anybody hurting like I thought it was a good testimony one of my daughters woke up or no one of my daughter's couldn't fall asleep and was really discouraged she was like shaking in the night and then one of my other daughters kind of woke up and just the testimony was just went over calmly prayed and then the daughter that was shaken just felt the victory fell all that nervousness leave and they went right to bed by God's grace oh that's a good testimony it's a good testimony just just being uh the Bible said be instant in season out of season speed oh it's just constantly humble how can I help how can I be a blessing how can I do something for the kingdom of God now let me close with this there are six in the book Lord willing if it comes out there are six examples of how people can have divine gifts and still be lost because gifts are given to you before before you even repent their give they're putting your human spirit we're gonna get you have a superpower the first is bail the Bible said he went to the mist of Darkness forever Balaam did so think about that that's what hell's like that's what that prison-house it's like a misty darkness yet he prophesied a star would come out of Jacob that the wise men followed yet he prophesied of that yet he went into a trance many times it could see God showing him things he he could see the God he couldn't curse in Israel because Israel is blessed so that's one Balaam I'm looking - a second judas iscariot he did miracles like all the other eleven but he went to his own place the 70 disciples that were sent out memory sent his twelve out two by two then he said I was seventy more they came back they rejoiced but Luke 10 1 - 20 and then Mark 9 and john 6:66 suggest that they all left because his preaching was too hard if they left Christ they left salvation they left the word they could have been lost so that was the next one fourth is Matthew seven where many will say Lord Lord have we not prophesied cast out devils these are workers of iniquity in fact all these are workers of nicholae it said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you depart from me never knew you said you did not do the will of God a fifth example is Hebrews 6:1 - 12 a group taste of the heavenly gifts and powers but yet are still lost that's because after experience than the power of God they get slothful and fall away they're unwilling to repent they crucify Christ put him to an open shame which is public disgrace with their sinful lives and they crucify Christ afresh again uses I'm sorry the Hebrews writer uses botany life again to compare them to thorns just as Jesus called this workers of iniquity tears which are poisonous now he caused him thorns the Hebrews writer calls and thorns in Hebrews chapter 6 absence either I see how they're absent of the fruits of the Holy Spirit's thorns never had any good fruit to begin with so they didn't have the fruit of faith you know when they cast on the devil that wasn't the fruit of faith that was a gift of faith yet many churches are confused at all what great fruits we see from their ministries their healing the sick and guess that's not a fruit that's a gift and lastly sixth in 1st Corinthians thirteen one two three it specifically mentions the gift of faith though I could have all faith that move mountains have not charity I'm nothing so see you learn faith is a supernatural powerful gift sorry about it day always fights my father got silenced it moves obstacles but exercising the gift without God's love is spiritual bankruptcy so even though you can operate the gift without faith in your soul you're nothing anyway so see this proves church and children love is the only true and acceptable motivation for trying to do God a service because love empowers faith and then faith does the works of God whether they're supernatural or just works of obedience praise God god bless you we'll stop right there next time Lord willing we'll look at the fruit of faith which is the rarest kind so let's ask our musician here my son real quick I'm going to silence this lab real quick praise God what a wonderful word of God to hear tonight are you justified by faith as Jesus Christ declared you righteous if not let's make that choice tonight we shouldn't be at war with God we should have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ we all have intellectual faith let's make sure our faith is the saving

may they repent and love for Jesus Christ leave their sins behind we justified be declared righteous and live by Jesus's own faith after trusting in Jesus's death burial resurrection may they live by his faith begin to grow in grace how much of you you haven't repented I pray you will repent tell God you're a great sinner and you want a new heart a new life you're sorry for every sin you've ever done and you want to serve Him now for the rest of your days if you prayed that let me know how baptized your fights we're to baptize you in the name of your Savior we want to justify God I pray you raise our faith that the church pray let our faith be build up that the gift of faith move amongst god help us to soul a flea survey that will see the fruit of faith in our lives but in test of faith

faith strengthened our prayer lives the strength in our walk with your bolted thankful to know these things that help us to act upon bless your people tonight father's a rest of their home we prepare
