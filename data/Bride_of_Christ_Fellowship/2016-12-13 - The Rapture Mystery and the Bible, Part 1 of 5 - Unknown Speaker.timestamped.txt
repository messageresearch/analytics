[0:04] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:09] this video is to share the Bible
[0:11] revelations about the mysterious endtime
[0:13] event known as the rapture st. Paul
[0:16] specifically called the rapture a
[0:18] mystery in first Corinthians 15 verse 51
[0:21] and reveal a part of the mystery saying
[0:24] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[0:27] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[0:31] thankfully the Bible promise that all
[0:33] the mysteries of God would be revealed
[0:36] in the end times which includes the
[0:38] rapture mystery as revelation 10 verse 7
[0:41] said that the mystery of God would be
[0:43] finished or revealed and then the
[0:45] revelation will be taken and prophesied
[0:47] before many peoples and nations and
[0:50] tongues and kings according to
[0:52] revelation 10 verse 11
[0:56] the word rapture and it's to Bible names
[1:00] the literal word rapture is not used in
[1:03] the King James version of the Bible but
[1:05] many Christians still use the word we
[1:07] choose to use the word rapture because
[1:09] its definition is fully supported in
[1:11] Scripture and it gives us a common term
[1:13] to use with believers and unbelievers in
[1:16] the Bible the rapture is called two
[1:18] things first the caught up experience to
[1:22] meet the Lord Jesus in the air second
[1:24] the first resurrection we will briefly
[1:27] teach about these two names first the
[1:30] rapture is called the caught up
[1:32] experience which comes from st. Paul who
[1:34] used the words caught up to meet the
[1:36] Lord in the air in first Thessalonians 4
[1:39] verse 17 and that is what we mean when
[1:42] we say rapture for it is the catching up
[1:44] or caught up experience or ascension of
[1:47] the dead and living Christians into
[1:50] heaven right before the great
[1:51] tribulation period and the end of the
[1:53] world second the raptures call the first
[1:57] resurrection in Revelation chapter 20
[2:00] verse 5 because there is also a second
[2:03] resurrection according to Christ Jesus
[2:05] and scripture
[2:10] direction or rapture is Christ seizing
[2:13] away his bride ur wife the Holy Ghost
[2:15] filled Saints before worldwide
[2:17] destruction and then Christ allows them
[2:19] to live and reign with him for a
[2:21] thousand years in the Millennium the
[2:24] Bride of Christ includes the dead in
[2:26] Christ or those holy ghost filled
[2:28] Christians who died and slept in Christ
[2:30] over the past two thousand years and it
[2:33] includes the living holy ghost filled
[2:35] Christians who will never have to taste
[2:37] death the dead in Christ will be
[2:39] resurrected in incorruptible or perfect
[2:42] bodies and the living saints will
[2:44] experience a body change into
[2:46] incorruptible bodies and live eternally
[2:49] without end with Christ the rest of the
[2:53] entire world population who denied
[2:55] Christ as unbelievers along with those
[2:58] foolish virgin Christians who did not
[3:00] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:02] will have to die during the Tribulation
[3:04] Period or Battle of Armageddon and they
[3:07] will miss the Thousand Year millennial
[3:09] reign with Christ they will not live
[3:11] during the 1000 year millennial reign
[3:13] because the lives they chose to live
[3:15] during their time on earth were not fit
[3:17] to rule and reign with Christ this is
[3:19] true because revelation 20 verse 5 said
[3:22] the rest of the Dead lived not again
[3:24] until the thousand years were finished
[3:27] the rest of the world population and
[3:29] foolish virgin Christian will remain in
[3:31] the graves according to Jesus in John 5
[3:34] verse 28 and will be resurrected for
[3:37] their day of judgement at the great
[3:39] white throne which is called the second
[3:41] resurrection and was spoken of by Christ
[3:43] in Matthew 25 verses 31 to 46 in
[3:47] Revelation chapter 20 verses 11 through
[3:49] 15
[3:53] understanding the rapture in order to
[3:57] understand the rapture and fully share
[3:58] the revelations about the rapture
[4:00] mystery we will answer the following
[4:02] questions briefly and then teach the
[4:04] scriptural truths more in-depth
[4:06] immediately afterwards what is the
[4:08] rapture who is the rapture for when will
[4:12] the rapture occur where will the rapture
[4:14] take place at why will the rapture occur
[4:17] how will the rapture be done what is the
[4:22] rapture the rapture is the resurrection
[4:24] and ascension of the dead in Christ
[4:27] first the Christians who have died
[4:29] during the last two thousand years
[4:31] followed by the body change and
[4:33] ascension of the Living Holy Ghost ville
[4:35] Christians into the sky to meet Jesus at
[4:38] a secret return to seize away his people
[4:41] from the earth before the Great
[4:43] Tribulation Period who is the rapture
[4:47] for the rapture is for Jesus's bride or
[4:50] wife which are the holy ghost filled
[4:53] Christians who have loved and faithfully
[4:55] served Jesus Christ over the past two
[4:57] thousand years including the dead and
[4:59] the living Jesus called this group the
[5:02] wise virgin in Matthew 25 verses 12 13
[5:05] all sinners and foolish virgin
[5:08] Christians Christians who are not born
[5:10] again of the Holy Ghost will be left
[5:12] behind and going to the Great
[5:13] Tribulation Period or Jacob's trouble
[5:16] when will the rapture occur the rapture
[5:20] will occur at an unknown day in our but
[5:23] the Bible and Jesus described the
[5:24] conditions times and seasons that must
[5:27] be met before the rapture can occur the
[5:30] Bible teaches the rapture will occur
[5:31] before the Great Tribulation Period true
[5:34] Christians will love his appearing
[5:35] according to second Timothy 4 verse 8
[5:37] true Christians will watch and pray as
[5:40] Jesus commanded and be ready for the
[5:42] rapture where will the rapture take
[5:45] place at the rapture will be a universal
[5:48] event meaning it will take place on a
[5:50] global scale and believers will not have
[5:53] to be in one physical location in order
[5:55] to be a part of the rapture holy ghost
[5:57] filled believers might be working at the
[5:59] time of the rapture or sleeping in their
[6:01] beds on the other side of the world but
[6:04] it doesn't matter
[6:05] if they have the oil of the baptism of
[6:07] the Holy Ghost or the wedding garment of
[6:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost they will
[6:11] be ready for the rapture and Jesus will
[6:13] call them to the air to meet the rest of
[6:15] the Saints in the sky why will the
[6:19] rapture occur the rapture will occur
[6:22] because Jesus Christ desires to take his
[6:24] Gentile bride to their wedding in the
[6:27] sky and then to their wedding supper in
[6:29] heaven Christ wants to receive his
[6:31] people unto himself and rescue his wife
[6:33] from the Great Tribulation Period that
[6:35] is coming up on the earth to judge and
[6:37] torment the unbelievers as pilgrims and
[6:40] strangers on this earth the holy ghost
[6:42] filled bride wants to leave this world
[6:43] and ever be with the Lord according to
[6:46] 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 17 how will
[6:51] the rapture be done the rapture we done
[6:53] by the power and authority of Jesus
[6:55] Christ himself through his own shout
[6:57] voice and Trump the same Holy Spirit
[7:01] that quickened Jesus's own body and his
[7:03] resurrection from the dead and raptured
[7:05] his body twice will come upon the dead
[7:08] in Christ and the living saints and
[7:10] translate them in a moment in the
[7:11] twinkling an eye to the air to meet
[7:14] Jesus in the sky a corner of first
[7:16] Corinthians 15 52
