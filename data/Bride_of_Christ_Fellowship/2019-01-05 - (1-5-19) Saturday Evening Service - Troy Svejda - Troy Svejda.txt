it's good to see each and every one of you here this evening I praise the Lord I know he'll have something special for you tonight amen amen that's one thing about the Lord he knows he gave us a promise he said that wherever two or three are gathered in my name and he was looking down on through the future when he said that amen because he news the end from the beginning so he gave out that promise knowing that he'd be able to fulfill that promise amen so he said he prophesied he promised that wherever two or three are gathered in my name all the way on down through history I will come right there in the midst of them and think about whenever he comes he heals when he comes he delivers and it comes accessory whoever will open their hearts to him he will come he has a blessing for you tonight amen if you'll just open your heart for me it's possible because he promised it amen amen so as we turn our Bibles to the book of first Corinthians chapter four I got a message from the smart this evening that you know everyone swell yeah your preach a sermon you just really struggle to put a title to it you know and you know what the sermon is but to put a title there's just so many different things you could call it will call this tithes and offerings but in reality it goes a lot deeper than that for a secondary tile I guess we call it forsaking all amen so 1st Corinthians chapter 4 we'll start with the sixth verse and going down to the tenth verse it says and these things brethren this is Paul speaking I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollo's for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against the other for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou dis not receive now if thou dis receive it why does thou glory if thou has not received it think about that everything that we have we cannot glory in it because we know where we got everything that we own we got it from the Lord Himself amen now ye are full now year rich you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God that she did reign that we also might reign with you for I think that God hath set for us set forth us the Apostles last as were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle under the world and angels and men and we are fools for Christ's sake but you're wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong you're honorable but we are despised a man one more scripture will go over to the book of Genesis chapter 12 Genesis 12 and we'll read the first two the third verse and then we'll power has a word of Prayer Genesis 12 verse 1 and it says now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation I'll bless thee and I will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I'll bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed hey missus bar has an order prayer Heavenly Father we just wanted to invite you into this room just now Lord according to a promise that you gave us two thousand years ago that you said Lord in your word when you spoke that promise that wherever two or three are gathered in your name Lord that you come right there in the midst of them and lorda we just want to thank you for coming into this room this tonight Lord though we know that look if there be any needs upon the hearts of the believers father that we pray Lord that you carefully consider those needs according to your promise and according to the blood that you shed for us and lord I pray father if there be any questions upon the hearts of the people tonight father that may be through the preaching of the word that you would just answer those questions and be a blessing under the people father because Lord every time you speak we are blessed and we love your word father and so we just turned the service over into your hands lord have thine own way just now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen okay man you can be seated amen our father Abraham he was the father of the faith amen and you know there's one thing about Abraham is he had such a strong belief you know anybody that has had a few experiences with the Lord they begin to get to this place in the Lord where they just believe they've seen God do so much that they just begin to believe that God could do anything you know and that's just a really good place to be a man you know eyes flying over here from Des Moines Iowa and we went to Atlanta first and we flew from a land up to Cleveland and there was a lady sitting now when we got to Atlanta we were looking at our boarding passes for the next leg of the flight and my son and I were going to be separated from each other they weren't gonna be sitting next to each other and I really was you know to be sitting with my son so so we went up and it's just right before boarding we went up to the lowly gate agent the ticket agent there and but the gate and and I asked lady yes I know it's kind of late to be asking this because there's people are lined up for boarding and I said you know and there's a full flight and I was like my son I would like to sit next to each other is there something you can do and she looked and she moved somebody else to give us and completely we were gonna be in 3438 and she moved us up to the row 15 so that we could sit next to her and there was three seats there there's me and my son and then someone else and so we we we get up to get on the plane and we were walking towards our row and there's a an elderly lady there and she's sitting there and and she looked up and she moved for us so we can get in and sit next to the window there and and she set back down and and I told her she asked what we were doing and I Ohio and I told her you know we're come here to preach and and she she said you know normally I hate to travel alone you know I just every time I fly I always have a companion with me and and I was scared to fly by myself so at home I just got down on my knees I was asking Lord Lord just gifts let me have someone really nice sit next on the way and right before we got on the Lord the agent moved someone away from her and put us in that spot and that lady had a relationship with the Lord she had a need she had a desire upon her heart that she wanted to she didn't get to have a travel companion so she prayed that the Lord would give her a travel companion and so it's Lord somehow saw fit to have me be her travel companion for that leg of the trip amen I just it was just it reminds me of that whenever we have a need of something and you and you've seen God do something for you in the past it just gives you a certain faith to know that God will do something for you in the future amen and the same thing with Abraham here you know I really don't know what Abraham's early life was like I don't know why it is when God first called him that there's something that struck on his heart that says I have to answer this call I have to go and go with what this call is calling yonas call said get thee out of thy father's house get the away from my father's kindred don't go and follow in your father's way don't go and worship at your father's simple don't go and do all those things but I want you to separate yourself from your father's household and go into a land that I will show you and there I will bless you and so Abraham had to forsake all that he knew all that was familiar to him all that he was used to all that he had and he had seen in times past where men would grow old and they would die and they give an inheritance to their sons and so Abraham you know in the pattern of life is that he'd have the inheritance of his father his father's land his father's people his his extended family his answer his uncles his cousins you know there would be that support group you know that you would have him you worship and his father's temple you know and all those things but he left all of that behind to follow this voice that promised him another inheritance so he gave up on his own father's inheritance and received a new father by the name of Jehovah and he left that behind he forsook all forsaking all and went into the promised land amen amen what a what a you know there's it's just us human nature that you know when people come in to Christianity when people come to Christ a lot of times it's just human nature that they like to come halfway they want to come halfway you know they want to hold on to this over here and then go into Christ and see how close to Christ they can get while still holding on to something back over here amen but but the reality is is Christ asks us to forsake all he asks us to leave our past behind and go and move into the Lord Jesus Christ amen and to make that clean separation that the things you know like when they left Egypt they are leaving Egypt behind they went through the Red Sea and God purpose we took him through a way that they couldn't go back amen because God says you know I could lead him up through the other way over here where they might go through war but I'm afraid they'll get scared and try to go back so I'm gonna take him through the wilderness and right up to the Red Sea and he parts the Red Sea and goes through they couldn't go back he had a clean break away from Egypt and so is a soweth when if God has ever called you let me tell you that's a blessing if God ever speaks to your heart that's a blessing yo there's a lot of people out this heart on this earth have never heard anything amen there's a lot of people in the if you were out tone you said has God ever spoken to you they'd laugh in your face there are people that say I don't believe there is such a creature as this God I don't believe there is such a being as this God and you know there's a lot of people who say those things you know and they'll say oh god I have all kinds of things they believe about God but if you are sitting here in this room tonight and you as some time in the past have felt the very first time you felt God call and call your heart and call you a fake come be my son to come be my daughter let me tell you that is a blessing knowing everybody has received that amen and when you if you ever once receive that call that pole on your heart to come then let me tell you answer that quickly don't let that pass you by because that is a blessing well the Bible is full of examples there are not just not just examples from thousands of years ago that can never happen again but the Bible is full examples of people that heard that call upon their heart and they answered it and look at the things that they did they saw the Dead come back to life a man they saw people that get healed and delivered a man they saw sees past a man there's people that didn't even die they walked right up into glory like Enoch you know there's just the Bible is full of testimonies of things that people have experienced because when God called them they answered that call and it calls for forsaking all this path calls for forsaking all amen you know when abraham when he he gave up his father's inheritance everything that he could have maybe naturally expected in life he gave all that up and he followed this call to go into this land the land that jehovah showed him amen and jehovah became his father and Jehovah you know in John 1:12 says but as many as received him to them he gave the power to become the sons and daughters of God amen now you think you know it right now if any one of you went up to your mom or your dad and you said oh oh you know I wish that you would you know I need this or I need that you know you hear stories you know we need to learn so hard times Lois Imani or you know your you know your your parents you know most the times will help you upon life's road if you have a hard need or something you're in rough battle your parents can help you out amen but how much more so is it that the God Himself says I will give you the Holy Ghost if you ask amen amen so now let's turn over to Genesis chapter 14 Genesis chapter 14 you know as Abraham as he went into this promised land he just kept having more and more experiences with Jehovah amen and his faith would go higher and higher and higher amen a sword of Genesis chapter 14 verse verse 17 how he is familiar with the story of the Battle of the Kings amen now if you remember Abraham and his and his nephew lot they go into the Promised Land amen lot goes and looks at the looks at the land of Sodom and decides to go off and live in the land of Sodom where Abraham is staying up on the hill with Jehovah amen a lot chose his place and Abraham chose his place and so as as as law is living there in Sodom there was all sudden there was a war that went on Amen and Sodom ended up being on the losing side of that war and and the conquering our armies took all Sodom all their goods and went through their houses that took all their gold all their silver all their cattle everything that they had and and took even took lot as a prisoner to be a slave amen and they took him and they started going back to where that army had come from and lot was now a prisoner amen and you know Abraham is up on the hill having experiences with Jehovah amen he is he is now is no longer Abraham or a he's no longer Abram of Terah but now he is Abram of the Most High God amen he is now becoming a son of God amen not just a son of Terah but behavor is now up there on the hill he's becoming a son of God amen you know someone asked me a long time ago you know they told me that they they were chastising me for for believing in predestination you know and they just you know they just couldn't have it and and then so I just sighs we were sitting there at a coffee shop and I asked him I says well when do you think Abraham was saved you know was do you think the Abraham was saved when he met Melchizedek or perhaps do you think that maybe he was saved you know when he crossed over the River Jordan or was he saved when he gave ties on to Melchizedek or was he saved when he got received the call back there in her end or good know Abraham what point in his Abraham's life was he saying God had chosen Abraham before the foundation of the world amen and God knew exactly is waiting on down through history of every generation until there was a blend of qualities that was just right he needed a man like Abraham to be the father of the faith amen God knew exactly who Abraham was gonna be you know exactly what kind of person he was gonna be and he was just waiting for time for the for all the things that he had put in the human to come to a special blend so he could have a special man that he could put his hand upon and use a manual Eve God you know God did the same thing with you amen he's done the same thing with you amen so Abraham is up here on the hill a man and he's he's been following this Jehovah amen he's becoming more like this Java man and now he's getting that he has an opportunity to display the attributes of Jehovah down on the inside his head nephew as beings there's been taken away as as a slave going down going down into the enemy territory and was he do he goes off after him to safe his cousin the safe his nephew amen so verse 17 it says and the king of Sodom this is Genesis 14 17 and the king of saw it and went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chalmer and of the Kings are with him in the valley of shaveh which is the king's Dale I watch this and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth now I wonder if Abraham knew that before before this moment in time I wonder if Abraham knew this or if this was the first time Abraham began to realize here's this man Melchizedek he has no father no mother no beginning of days no end of life he sitting there speaking to him he says blessed are you of the Most High God none of Terah not Abram of Terah but Abram of the Most High God blessed are you you are the possessor of heaven and earth now I don't know about you but that would do something for me you know it has done something for me possessor of heaven on earth Amen all things were his Amen he was cut from one is he had he had rejected all of his past he laid everything down and now there's a patient has come to him he's Italy's that has his audience with Java a man has his audience with God in the flesh and God in the flesh is telling them you are the possessor of heaven on earth you are my son you this is your inheritance amen he gave up everything to follow me and now I am beginning to reveal unto you your inheritance hey man what is he doing he begins to act like Christ he goes down saves lot now after the battle is over remember what happened now after the battles or what happened Abraham and all the kings that he saved he saved all their household goods and all their gold and their silver and he brought it back and they try to offer something to him now let's go down to the end of the chapter here's I'm just building something up here real quick as they met there let's go down to we'll just read down the neck Mercer verse 20 and blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all so if something about this visitation that caused Abraham to pay his tithing there's something about this visitation that caused Abraham to give tithes on milk a Tzadik a man will get that into later on amen and the king of Sodom sent Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself he's trying to give Abraham a reward and Abraham said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand under the Lord and to the Most High God the possessor of heaven and earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latch it and I will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say I have made Abraham rich save only that we'll just operate there I I don't want to take anything from you because I don't want you to have any opportunity to say that I have made Abraham rich I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah God is my provider everything that I have has come from Jehovah everything that I want everything that I desire he is the possessor of heaven earth I am now of I am now have his inheritance that he has made me a possessor of heaven and earth they meant everywhere I go every old footsteps I go everywhere I go is mine everything if I want something I asked the Lord he gives it to me amen and so now he so so when the kings of saw him says comes up to give him an offering to give him something he says I don't want anything to do with it I've rejected all this treasure of her I've rejected all the treasure of my father I've heard no I'm rejecting all the treasure of Sodom I don't want any part of it why because I have one father that is God amen I have one that want one this that has called me one that has saved me and that is the one that'll lift my hand - he is my source he is my deliverer he is my comforter he is the one that has given my daily bread he is the one that heals me when I'm sick he's the one that delivers me he's the one that keeps me and he is the only one that gives me anything that I have need of amen Abraham knew where he stood a man be good for all of us to know where we stand he meant let me tell you if you have something need of you know ask him Amen ask him the more we ask him the more we receive and it raises our faith in Him blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth what an inheritance you know we have a supernatural inheritance as we when we were called when that call first came across your life maybe we didn't know it at that time what God was gonna call us unto but God has not called us just to live a natural life on this earth Amen you know we are sons and daughters of Abraham yes amen we have an inheritance for us now if Abraham could separate himself from all the from the world and all the things of the world and go into the land that God showed him and what did that do it caused a visitation it caused a visitation you know all of us are do a visitation when you reject the world and the things of the world it should cause a visitation every single one of us is do a visitation to where when you get away from the world the things of the world you separate yourself and you and you get alone with God you are doing cetacean it's got to happen why it's got happened that's what we call being filled with the Holy Ghost we're caught you where there is a calling that that once you once you're called God wants to fill you with himself he wants to deliver he wants to keep you he wants to be with he wants to walk with you he wants you to be his temple amen to walk with day in and day out yeah amen let's turn over in her Bibles to mark chapter 10 mark Chen there's this there's a story of the rich young ruler and this this first versed in this and this story is just amazing to me when you read mark 10:17 let's read it it says and when he Jesus was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life now any one of us if we were to see that happen we would look at that man we say that man is gonna be a real good Christian think about it running he came running to the Lord Jesus Christ it came running to the Lord Jesus Christ we'd all put our hands over heart like oh my I know what's getting ready to happen when a man comes running to the altar we know what's gonna happen we think oh praise God another one saved now let's watch he kneeled to the Lord Jesus Christ and he asked him he said good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life you know anytime you ask the Lord Jesus Christ a question like this you know that he'll answer you amen so so this man asked the Lord Jesus Christ how do i inherit eternal life so well now what he's doing answer a ment he asked in all good honesty he asked this question and good honest faith amen and he when he went to the Lord he asked him how can I inherit eternal life so this man is now do an answer so what does the Lord Jesus do he has to contact his spirit he this man ran to the word he ran to the word he asked the word what can I do to inherit eternal life now the word is gonna respond back the word has to go down into his heart down into his soul and discern and find out where the problem is say well what problem was there this man didn't have eternal life that was the problem amen he should have eternal life amen this man was a child of Abraham amen he was living in the promised land amen he should have eternal life he shouldn't hate being a hair of the land amen he should have eternal life but he comes running up to the word he comes running up to Melchizedek he comes running up to Jesus Christ amen and it says good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life now the eternal life himself has to answer back and tell him what the problem is amen so he sold no Street on further Jesus Jean and Jesus said unto verse 18 why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and thy mother amen but you know for all that this didn't answer his question Jesus is discerning his sphere here discern his spirit it didn't answer it didn't give them any peace didn't give me a rest and the worst when he says and he answer he said to a master all these things I have observed from my youth and then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him now look the word has discerned where the trouble was yes the word where the problem was the word discerned it as answering back and says one thing thou lackest man if you lacked just one thing wouldn't that be a blessing to know what it was amen one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and now shall have treasure in heaven and come take up that cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions the word discerned that this man could not forsake all he couldn't do it now his father Abraham forsook all his father Abraham went before and told the testified under the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah and I will not take anything from you from the world or the things of the world lest the world should say that I have made you rich but I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah amen and what do what God say God has swung back to him in Genesis 51 I am nice exceeding great reward amen the word know when when now let's go back to Genesis let's just read that real quick we're on a hurry are we amen amen injustice 14 22 it says and Abra's said no ada was speaking to the king of Sodom he says an abram said to the king of sodom i have lift my hand unto jehovah unto the Lord and the Most High God the possessor of heaven and earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet and that I will not take anything the design lest you should say I have made a more rich let's go to the next chapter 15 verse 1 it says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision so what got the word Salwa abram said and now the word is responding amen they said said it to Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward my he had met the possessor of heaven and earth the possessor of heaven earth is responding back to him he says I am thine I everything I have is yours you know now Abraham is beginning to realize the longer has he just the son of Terah but he has become again being given power to become a son of God and so to all those that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and this day to them the God gives the power to become the sons and daughters of God amen so this rich young ruler what'd he do he went away sad for he had great possessions he wouldn't do what his father Abraham did his father Abraham forsook everything lifted his hand up to Jehovah but here comes the rich young ruler who was a son of Abraham living in the promised land of Abraham but he would not do the acts of his father Abraham the acts of his father Abraham he would not - Amen no now let's now now think about it number whomever's the story of Zacchaeus now Zacchaeus also received a similar visitation just like this rich young ruler a man Zacchaeus was up in the tree amen and that Lord Jesus Christ is walking by he's hiding himself in the leaves and all sudden Jesus looks up and it calls him by name knows what his name is a man knows that kiss was a Jew was a son of Abraham he was living in the promised land and and the word comes and walks by his way the word looks up as that kiss and says that kiyose come down I must eat with you this night and and Zacchaeus runs down out of the tree receives Jesus Christ into his own house and with joy receives the word and now look when where what Zacchaeus say he said Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor now why is it that the rich young ruler had to give up everything Bizet kiyose only had to give half why is that because that Kia said are already given up everything the moment that Zacchaeus received the Lord Jesus Christ at the table look the word knew in his heart this man has given up all this man gave up all I think about it that it wasn't a problem for Zacchaeus everything got the word already had discerned that the Zacchaeus being a rich man they meant that Zacchaeus a businessman there's the word already had discerned that the word had possession of all Zacchaeus amen the word had possession of all of Zacchaeus but when the rich young ruler ramped to the word the word discerned that he couldn't get possession of zakian of the rich young ruler amen so the word called out the problem in the rich young ruler what was that kiss there was no problem Amen or lady put it this way Zacchaeus answered his own word problem heed what he if I have taken anything from anyone I will restore to him fourfold amen Zacchaeus immediately upon meeting the word gave up all what was what what was that kiss doing he's testifying I like my father Abraham and lifting my hand to Jehovah he had received a visitation of the word in his house amen and the word responded back and the word and Zacchaeus were in communion one with the other and Zacchaeus laid everything down and proved that he was a son of Abraham by doing the acts of Abraham Amen now remember her act you know Abraham went to save his brother or to save his nephew he was showing that Christ was in his life so does every single one of us when we receive that call of God in our lives we must come to the place where we start displaying the Lord Jesus Christ on the inside amen but we can only do that when we forsake all they meant now people they can they can do what the rich young ruler did come running to the altar they can kneel before the Lord they can say oh good master they can sing the songs but if they do not forsake all it cannot be a son of Abraham can't do it amen they cannot be as a received inheritance of their father amen amen you know there's something about that visit know what why do we pay our tithing let's go back to the subject of tithing why do we pay our tithing there's something about that visitation that Abraham had when he he'd followed Jehovah he'd received the call of Jehovah but at the very point that he entered into the promised land Eve went where Jehovah told him to go and then he received a visitation of Jehovah in the flesh amen and yeah that is a blessing this is like the culmination think about it think about it if all think about was when you when did you first receive Christ think back to when you first received Christ you when you when you first receive Christ you didn't necessarily know all that the Lord was gonna do in your life amen will neither did Abraham a man but he just knew I'm gonna follow this call I'm gonna follow this call let me tell you one night when I received the Lord Jesus Christ I didn't know that see all to see the healings I've seen I didn't know I would see all the deliverances that I've seen I didn't know I get to see Jesus Christ in action like I've seen him amen I didn't know all that but you know I've received visitations of Christ I've seen him I've I felt his presence I've I've come into the room I've had a meet me in my car I've had a meet me at the church I've had a meet me everywhere I go I've had a meet me at work amen I've had him meet me while I'm listening to tapes I've had him meet me when I'm singing the songs and there's been visitation after visitation after visitation why because the word is coming to his son amen the word is coming to his son so does he deal with you there's something about it that when Abraham came into the promised land that he received a visitation and when he received this visitation it just caused him to give up all the to give a token to show that he had surrendered all he gave up his tithe until the milk isn't so now so when the when he gave a tithe in the milk so now when the children of Israel 400 years later going to the promised land God Institute's this into the law itself of tithes and offerings let's go to the numbers chapter 4 numbers chapter 18 numbers 18 verse 20 what the the now remember when the children of Israel went into the Promised Land they went into the Promised Land as twelve tribes amen and they were sons of Abraham and they've been in Egypt for hundred years but that promise of God that that land of Israel would belong to the sons of Abraham that promise still lived amen so what the shirt of Israel were doing when they went into the back to the promised land after leaving Egypt as they're entering back into the inheritance that been given unto their father Abraham amen they were doing inheritance they were they were doing inheritance but they so that God owed them an inheritance because why because God has to fulfill his word amen remember when remember when God told Abraham he said he met him at the tent and he led him out of the tent door he says look up into the sky Abraham count the stars if you can as many as the stars are out there are to be as many as your children and he gave that land unto Abraham's children go down to the the beach or to the desert and count the grains of the sand social ABI is like into your children and I'll give your children that land as an inheritance it's yours Abraham it belongs to you and to your family to your seed after you and 400 years in Egypt couldn't take away their inheritance from them amen so now here in numbers chapter 20 or Numbers chapter 18 they're getting ready to go back into the promised land they're getting ready to to regain their inheritance all twelve tribes to get regain the inheritance that that was due unto them that was owed to them from Jehovah himself but then he come to numbers 1820 and the Lord spake unto Aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land that's amazing now think about Aaron was a son of Abraham he was doing inheritance and now God is speaking to him and says you're not getting your inheritance my and the Lord spake unto Aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them I am thy part and 9 inheritance among the children of Israel verse 21 and behold I have given the children of Levi all the tents in Israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation my so God took the aaron and his sons and the Levites and all their sons and God you know God likes to reserve a tenth unto himself a man so what'd he do he took a tenth I basically almost a tenth of the children of Israel and reserve them unto himself all the sons of Aaron and all the and all of the tribe of Levi and God reserved them unto himself and says you're not going to inheritance but I am your inheritance that was a tithing of the people unto God amen and then he says but I will give you an inheritance a tenth of all the increase of the children of Israel tenth of all they produce will come unto you and that will be your reward now who gave the tithing unto the Levites and to the sons of Aaron it wasn't that the children of Israel gave it to him Jehovah gave it to them amen they were doing inheritance of the land but when they've got into the land God told no you are not to have an inheritance among slant but I am going to give you the tithing as your inheritance and I will be your portion and I will take care of you amen so it wasn't that the children of Israel gave the tithing to the priests is that God had already given the tithing to the priests and so the children of Israel are just being faithful to do to make manifest what God had already done when they pay their Titan those are the same thing with us when we pay our tithing it's not us giving the tenth of our income unto the ministry but no we're just giving that God already gave our tithing to the Ministry but he and we're holding on to it and we are just being faithful to manifest what God has already done amen hey man let's keep reading last couple verses here neither must the tongue of Israel hits forth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity and it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations that among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance amen they become fools for Christ a man like we read in the beginning we are fools but we are poor but you are rich amen we are despised of all men amen amen as Paul said I think that God has sent the Apostles as last amen amen so think about you know the visitors what are the ministers do they have a right to as we call you know the American dream you know to go and do this do that but instead they take of their time to minister unto the people amen amen amen let's turn over to Ephesians chapter 4 now before we go into pieces chapter 4 you know God has always had a dwelling place he's always had a place where he would meet the people he always had a way to communicate to his people amen so you know you know in the Garden of Eden he had a place where he would meet his daughter a man in the tabernacle a wilderness he had a place that he would meet them amen you know and when the temple was built he had a place where he could visit with the people a many knowing when when Jesus Christ was born on the earth he was that place where the people were to meet God amen amen it was and Jesus Christ was filled with the Holy Ghost amen he was the Holy Ghost he was the Spirit of God brooding over the earth again amen brooding over the people again amen and so but when I when the wind you know and what he do he drew twelve disciples to himself amen and they followed him everywhere they went everywhere Jesus went they kept they followed him they followed three and a half years they followed him or they doing their fault when they recognized that the Spirit of God was within this man amen that he was the son of the Living God and they were following it because of the revelation that they received amen and then all sudden one day to their astonishment that this man that they followed that they knew was the Son of the Living God they knew was the promise of the Scriptures be fulfilled that one day this man was lifted up on a cross and was crucified and died and was taken away from the depository of the Holy Spirit on the earth was taken and nailed to a tree and crucified amen and and and so and so it was he he goes is putting in the tomb he is resurrected he starts appearing I may in appearances and making appearances amen and visitation after visitation and and now and all sudden there and they have joy again because they realize their Lord and Savior has raised from the dead and he was not he did not just die and never to come back but he raised back again amen and as he is ministering to him he says wait here in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you weigh right here in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen and as they watched amen and they watched as Jesus ascended up into the heavens and he was concealed away by a cloud a man there standing there looking up into the heavens and all sudden two angels appear and the two angels appear and they say why are you looking up into the heavens you know go why are you look he will return in the same way that he left but go and be obedient to everything that he told you to do amen answer or they go and they go and they waited in Jerusalem until they were in dude with power from on high you know a lot of Christians they'll wait until their endued with power from on low but it's important that we be endued with power from on high a man I think we all know what be to be is to be endued with power from down low I mean that's when you're acting your own ideas your own thinking your own thoughts your own ways but when you're one sindoor with power from on high now your longer thinking your thoughts but you have subjected yourself you've lifted your hand unto Jehovah you're no longer walking in your path but you like Zacchaeus have given up all Amen you have now forsaken all and now you're doing the same thing your father Abraham did and you're testifying that I too am living in the promised land and I am a son or a daughter of Abraham and an heir according to the promise Amen praise God that is our inheritance amen when we forsake all then that inheritance is do unto us amen but now if we do not forsake all that inheritance is not do unto us but all of us must take up our cross and follow Jesus amen so as the disciples were waiting there there waiting there in Jerusalem and all sudden they were endued with power from on high amen and the Bible says that when Jesus Christ ascended let's read here in Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians 4:8 now wherefore he saith that when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive isn't that great isn't that wonderful that he led captivity captive he did that for you he did that for me amen he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men now he did this as he was ascending he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men now let's go down to verse 11 what are some of these gifts he gave unto us now if we if we have gifts remember we have an inheritance a man it's one thing about sons and daughters of Abraham as they want to know exactly what their inheritance is amen because if there's an inheritance of God's giving me something I want to have it amen I want to have it I want to obtain it I want to know exactly what it is I want to revere it and I want to love it amen amen so what we'll so what were some of the gifts he gave and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now why'd he give these gifts verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ amen wouldn't we like you would you like to be perfected amen so would I we want to be sons and daughters of Abraham and we have to forsake all to get there amen so as our Lord Jesus Christ was ascending he led captivity captive he threw some gifts back among men and now the Holy Spirit that left when Jesus left returned back upon the heads of the apostles and that Holy Spirit is still descending upon men it's still filling min every ever since then that Holy Spirit has been going on filling and filling and filling men and women with the Holy Ghost amen amen and he is getting he is given a ministry a fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints well what does that ministry to do to make us enter into the full inheritance that's due unto the sons of God to lead us into the perfection of the Saints to give us everything that we have need of on this life's journey amen to show us exactly what we own what we possess what is do unto us a make us one thing that one thing that is true about about mankind is we'll go back to our own natural ways if God does not give us a supernatural vision without a vision the people perish so God has given a fivefold ministry to keep the supernatural vision before the eyes of the people so that the people could always have in their eyesight to know this is the direction walking in it this is the way to go walking in it amen and that ministry is supported by the ties that you get amen and it's not that you give your ties to the ministry God already gave the ties to the ministry but when you bring forth now tithes means 10% that's what the word tithes means is 1/10 as 10% amen and when you give your tithing to the ministry you are fulfilling your doing the same thing Abraham did when he received the visitation amen that's one thing that that's one thing about men and women is when they receive a visitation of the Lord Jesus Christ and when the love of God fills their hearts and makes them a giving people amen you see it and when it happened to Abraham he gave a tenth of all what happened to Zacchaeus he says behold I give a half that I own to the poor Amen if I have wronged a by or restore him fourfold it's one thing you know if you go to a really church service where the where the spirit is there and a manatee or rejoicing and when you walk out of that church service you just feel all scoured out and you just my you just love your brother you love your sister you love anything you love them all why because the Holy Spirit and you have become one amen the blessings of the Holy Ghost are fun it causes you to love one another amen when you love one another you're giving people man amen amen amen now let's turn over to Malachi chapter 3 now Kai 3 verse 8 and says will a man Rob God now you wouldn't think that was even possible you know I mean for you even if I went and I struck to you I told you I want you to go Rob God many people will say I don't even know how you would ever do that amen but the scripture says here will a man Rob God and it says yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee entice and offerings you are cursed with the curse for you robbed me even this whole nation bringing all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith Lord of Hosts if I'm not open unto you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it now why is he saying because when people really withhold their tithing they're testifying that they don't trust God as their provider amen they're also testifying that they have not forsaken all and they're testifying that are not sons and daughters of Abraham because they're not doing what their father Abraham did yeah amen and verse 11 it says and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes that he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground you know Satan is going about like a roaring lion right now seeking whom he may devour he's been by your house he's been by your house this week Satan like a roaring lion has come by your house this week seeking whom could devour amen he the same is faithful to do what he is do his work amen he does not call in sick amen he is always doing what his work is amen he is a roaring devourer roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but the Bible says here that when you pay your ties and you pay bring your tithes into the storehouse that he will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes what a blessing amen so when you see the devour coming by your household when you see Satan come by your household and devouring something check out your checkbook look and see if you've paid your ties and if you haven't call it before the Lord say Lord I obeyed your word and look what the Devourer is doing right amen because what why because we have an ability to call God on the scene to answer his word why because as a member of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ whenever we see a promise in the word we have the ability to take that promise up to the Lord in prayer and the Bible says that Jesus Christ right now is standing at the altar waiting to make intercession for us based upon his confession based upon our confession says in Hebrews that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself entered in with the blood of his own sacrifice and he's standing there right now waiting to make intercession for us based upon what our confession is so when we confess his word and say lord I see the devourer devouring something in my life I've checked out my life I can't find any unconfessed sin I've paid my tithing and I need you to rebuke the Devourer for my sakes and then he can intercede for you based upon his own word amen that's what the Lord does I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine casts their fruits before the time in the field amen and all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delights and delightsome land Lord amen what a promise what a promise you know God has a high interest in his bride even sometimes I don't know if we realize how much they God watches over us to perform his work just waiting for us to take some portion of his word of his word and to bring it before him in prayer and say Lord I have a need right now for you to answer your scripture I am a son of daughter of Abraham is the power of forsaking all amen that's why we have to check up constantly faithfully Lord have I been obedient to your word lord have I done everything you told me to do Lord have I left anything off Lord have I been obedient Lord am I doing what your ministry says for me to do Lori am i doing what your word says for me to do and checking up Lord I want to be faithful to what you say why because there's blessings in that there's blessings and being faithful there's blessings in being obedient to the word amen try it watch it watch it when you be obedient to the word watch what God will do in your life amen amen now let's turn over to Deuteronomy chapter 12 I don't have too many scriptures left here but I just want to turn to a couple more here this may not be a shout and message but but it's good anyhow amen amen Deuteronomy chapter 12 will read the tenth verse there I actually I'd recommend reading this whole chapter when you go home it's a wonderful chapter but we'll read the tenth and we'll end up going on down to the nineteenth first I just wanna spend some time in these ten verses here Deuteronomy 12:10 and it says but when you go over Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit when he giveth you rest from your enemies round about so that you should dwell in safety there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall you bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your ties and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which you have vowed unto the Lord and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God ye and your sons and your daughters and your men's service and your maidservants and the Levite has within your gates for as much as he has no part know nor inheritance with you you know to me this sounds like a church service you're gonna leave your house you're gonna go on to the place where God puts his name there and you're going to take your Levite with you you're gonna meet there Amen and you're gonna rejoice before the Lord and you're gonna bring your tithing there to me that sounds like a church service amen amen and God wants you to go and your church go to church amen amen that's not the guys put his name in this building but God has put his name in his bride amen and God has put his name in his bride and he's told them together the more as they see the Day approaching amen and and was he also as done he's given a fivefold ministry to minister unto his bride so that they can come to perfection and he wants them to gather together with this mystery and around a local gift that God has given to him amen now if God if you are living in a town if you're living in a certain region it's in if God says that when he ascended up on high he gave gifts unto men if you do not have one of those gifts Amen if you don't know where one of those gifts are then then you ought to at least find out where that gift is why because if you do not have a pastor then you're missing something amen why because when God was ascending when Christ was ascending he gave that gift back to you amen if you don't have that gift if you have a Levi if you don't have a pastor that you can call your own then you're missing something that God gave to you amen and when you find that gift when you find that pastor that pastor that ministry is to lead you is there for your perfection is there to lead you into amen and so what do you do when you find such a such a ministry you take all of your daughters and your sons and your wife and your tithing and you leave your house you go to where they gather you find that ministry that has the Spirit of God that is is identified by the Spirit of God and you bring your tithing unto that ministry amen and you rejoice there and sing unto Jehovah then that sounds like a church service amen yes now let's keep reading verse 13 take heed be careful watch out take heed to thyself that that offer not thy burnt offering in every place that thou seest be careful watch out but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of the tribes there thou shall offer thy burnt offerings and there they shall do all that I command thee be careful watch out where do you pay your tithe you have to be careful where you pay your tithe you have to be careful where you bring your offerings amen now let's go to verse 17 we'll skip down to 17 thou mayst not you shouldn't do it don't do it thou may us not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of the oil or the first things of thy herds or LifeLock nor any of thy vow shall vow us nor thy free will offerings or heave offerings of thine hand don't do it don't eat it at your own home so if you take care tithe money and you use it to order Domino's Pizza you're in disobedience to this verse amen if you take that that 10 percent of your increase and you take that and you use it for something there in your household or use it for your own benefit then you're in disobedience to this first right here yes amen verse 18 but thou must eat them before the Lord thy God where is the LORD thy God where is he had he said two thousand years ago he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be right there in the midst of them I'll be right there wherever two or three are gathered they're right there and in God when he ascended up on high he gave gifts unto men he gave you a pastor it gave you a ministry it's good to find out no matter where you are find that pastor find that ministry and support him why because we want a healthy ministry amen why do we give our tithe because the ministry needs to be healthy now the tithing goes on to the fivefold ministry amen I don't you know it's not there to pay for the rent it's not there to pay for the lights it's not there to pay for all the insurance policies it's there to support the fivefold ministry the offerings are to go for all the other needs of the church amen amen and and we want a healthy ministry why why because because our brother Jesse here has a right had a right to the American Dream had a right to develop a career had a right to to go up higher and higher and whatever career that he has anyway I know he's a teacher you know and he could have gone up higher and higher or wherever he could have maybe been a principal he could have done many things like ranches but he's been careful to watch the time that he has and I watched this man use man's diligent with his time he is diligent with his time and he sacrifices and he gives out and he goes and he visits the six and he does everything that the Bible says a pastor ought to do he's been faithful with his calling amen he's been faithful with his coin and that ministry should be supported and should be supported with the tithing amen and we went why because God already gave the tithing to the ministry we're just manifesting it when we put it in the offering plate and if we hold it back then we're robbing God because God gave something to the ministry and you stole it amen that's what we do when we don't pay our tithing now let's finish verse 18 there it says but thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose thou and thy son and my daughter and thy manservant and I maid servant and that the leet and the Levite as within I gates and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God and all that that put us thy hands unto amen verse 19 take heed be careful watch out take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as they live us upon the earth be careful watch out make sure you remember that I feel as a tenth it doesn't mean 9% it doesn't mean 8% it doesn't mean take you know a couple percent off over here a couple percent off over here no if God has given you a ministry if God has given you a pastor that will faithfully search out the word and find out what it is that God has a need for the local body for the perfecting of the Saints then that ties goes to that ministry amen amen amen you know and then people say well I'm just gonna I'm just gonna all stay at home and I'm not gonna leave my gate and I'm just gonna stay at home and I'm gonna mail my tithe check off over to this church a thousand miles away and you know but that's not what the Bible said the Bible says I remember what why do we sit they say they're back in verse let me find it real quick here I will go back to let's go back to numbers real quick I'm just in closing here oh I'm sorry no it wasn't Deuteronomy twelfth dorami twelve six I found I couldn't find you there Deuteronomy 12 verse five watch watch this what says about leaving your house it says bun to the place which the Lord shall choose out of all of your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek you should look under his habitation and thither thou shalt come you got to go somewhere amen and for six and thither he shall bring and so verse five and thinner thou shalt come verse six and thither thou shalt bring that's going on verse seven and there you shall eat you got to leave your house and there you shall eat and there you shall rejoice amen we're going to church amen well I'll just stay at home we're not just mailing off our tithe check over here off over there but we are going to church we're gonna rejoice before the Lord our God and we're gonna find out you know every time we come into this room we have to keep that scripture where Jesus said wherever two or three are gathered together I'll be right there in the midst ISM you know we think oh you know it's just just a natural building with sometimes some of us tend to supernatural eyes everything and I think well this this natural building doesn't mean anything you know or it's just a natural place all right I meet God in my home in the spirit you know but but God has designed this little place here to be the place where we gather together you know the Bible says iron sharpens iron but it only sharpens iron with the context amen and we have to come and contact one with the other amen and if God has given you a gift which he said he did when he was ascended up on high he gave you a gift of the fivefold ministry amen all of us have to find ministry and stay there honor at love at cherish bring our Titan unto it come to church with it we rejoice rejoice rejoice day in day in day out bring her like a fire into the church as part of our duty as part what are we doing we're testifying that were sons and daughters of Abraham because we're being obedient to this do the same thing he did amen amen why we want a healthy church a healthy ministry amen amen a swear our children can be raised in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord amen a healthy place that that when we go to the grocery store and the Lord smoothes upon your heart to go and witness to someone that you can say come I want you to come over to this church I want you to bring you over here why because this is where the Word of God is preached and we have a healthy ministry there and you can see the Word of God in action amen why because because everything is operating a well-oiled machine just the way God designed it amen we want a healthy ministry Amen because I you I you I've seen the churches to where there's you know or where there's the the tithing doesn't come in or the people don't invite people to church the people don't go out and minister the people don't go out and witness themselves you know and the church dwindles down in numbers the pastor isn't supported the people aren't praying and what do you have if you were ever to witnesses someone where would you bring them amen but we want to have a healthy ministry a healthy place to where we can bring the unbeliever amen why so the unbeliever can come and have their needs taken care of amen amen let's just stand a hey man you know we may not have a natural land like the share of Israel did that is our inheritance but we do have an inheritance the Lord Jesus Christ has given us his spirit it is our inheritance amen hey man we may sometimes think of pain or ties as just a natural tradition thing that is optional but there's something about that visitation with Melchizedek that caused Abraham to pay our tithing amen if we ever once meet the Lord Jesus Christ it'll cause us to do the same things it'll cause us to love one another it cause us to cherish our pastor not second-guess our pastor no I think I wish our past or do this or do that but to find out why God gave you such a bastard amen amen to love your pastor to care for him to watch out over to make sure that we have a healthy ministry amen amen let's just power has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I I just maybe it was just a maybe a sermon not quite what we're used to Laura but Lord this has been on my heart these last several months Lord to preach this message Lord and I pray father for this local church this local assembly father that you who Lord have have called a man by the name of brother Jesse Lohr Neve your daenam to be a pastor over this church Lord Lord and all of us Lord if we were to be honest with ourselves we'd say if we were to ask one another do we want to have a healthy church or not we look down in our hearts we would say yes have a healthy church if we're gonna have a place to where if we can go out and witness Lord if you'd grass to be able to win our neighbor or our co-worker or mother or father our children our nephew our aunt or uncle to Christ that we have a place that we could take them a place where the Holy Spirit is familiar with a place where the Holy Spirit has there's a well-beaten passed from heaven to the sanctuary where God comes and answers our prayers stay in a day out so where are the people come and they say when they come to church when they come in the door they say I know that God is gonna meet us here this morning because he never fails to answer his word where you said Lord where two or three are gathered combining who would be right here in the sense we know if that Scripture is true and no matter what if even if the service seems like a dry service maybe our old mental selves if we're tired for weary we can look to that scripture and know that no matter how we feel in our own bodies that that scripture remains true and that the promise that he will not withhold from us are brought his promise and lord I just pray father the Lord that the people who have respects under this place and respects on your ministry to treat her right Laura that you might be that you might rebuke the Devourer for their sakes I pray Lord that if they're meeting me here there's been a dilatory Lord to be obedient to your word Lord that you would give them the witness back Lord when that when they're obedient to your word that you would show them that you would reveal to them that you are rebuking the Devourer for their sins in obedience just like what's your word said lord I just thank you for those people Lord for being so attentive to your word this this evening I pray Lord that for the service tomorrow Lord we're looking for something special lord I just pray thought you'd meet us here again in the morning and we thank you Lord for all things the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Jesse if you come amen god bless you Saints appreciate you how many children of Abraham do have in the church today I know that's one way I know that I met Melchizedek is because boys given ten percent of my income to the Lord I really appreciate that word don't you preach appreciate that word tonight that's good Lord Rama Claus amen ladies got I've never heard it brought at that angle that's a really good angle start there with Abraham that was a really wonderful wonderful message we thank the Lord for that and now can you just switch over Lydia can you switch over real quick here just to my iPad you know just the last is interesting the brother told me that God's been dealing with him for this thought for our church for a few months and so two months ago I put out a video called ties in the Bible last month I put out part two last week I put out part one of the home church increasing your church attendance by part two I just put out this morning about having a pastor every Christian needs to have a pastor and the five benefits of the five preaching ministry I did tell him that you know so it's just you know God's timing is perfect so I just thought it was important to share that and I've had people call me you're a son of perdition believing in paying ties like I'm not the Bible says that God has ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the Gospels 1st Corinthians 9 13 and 14 so no matter what people say a child of Abraham knows he's doing the works of Abraham he or she is doing the works of a race and so a person who's met Melchizedek acts like Abraham he met Melchizedek and that's what he did once you meet God then you willingly you understand that it's God is the one who's giving me a hundred percent God gives me a hundred percent and just asked me to give up ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or whatever you can be so I appreciate that and the good thoughts there what a blessing by the grace you know and church I find this I love what the brother said there about the Bible says proof me if I won't pour open if we know some heaven I think you know when we go through hard times that that's what God is doing he's he's encouraging us okay we need to call out to me I want to hear I want to hear more of your prayers [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what these meanwhile have forsaken so much I think a bang and Wendy and Karis amen Jose or they have forsaken everything family friends I've tried to

promise of God or the same God the same situation how can awful situation or you just take that same attitude of faith the Lord your word says I could prove you and you said if I pay my cause and

it buy it's all by grace I love what our brother said there I actually used that quote on Wednesday night of course he didn't know that but brother our brother said Abraham was a special man you said he was a special blend he took this and this and this and brought it all down to produce Abraham I use that same quote on Wednesday night God adds this one and that one that one and he has a special ring to your testimony and God knew he was going to form you to be this type of personality and to be this type of overcomer do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good that's what makes his overcomers when we're presented with evil and good we overcome the evil with the good thank the Lord I'm glad I'm a special blend God had to form this together that together my grandparents my parents to bring me down I'm a special blend I'm a special kind of believer I'm not to make believer I'm not an unbeliever I'm a real believer praise God how do you know I do the works of Abraham [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what a blessing to be in the house we appreciate the word and the worship what a wonderful time in his presence father in heaven we just bow our heads Lord God we we know you're the one who made the promises for God as our brother said Lord as Abraham's natural so we know [Music] we're not promised
