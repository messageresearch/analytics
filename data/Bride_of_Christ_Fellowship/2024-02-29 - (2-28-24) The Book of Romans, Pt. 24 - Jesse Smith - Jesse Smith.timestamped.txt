[33:31] in a special way tonight Lord we're not
[33:32] gathered here in vain Lord God we ask
[33:34] that the Holy Spirit would speak to us
[33:35] here tonight Lord
[33:37] God just bless us as we read Thy Word in
[33:40] Jesus Christ's name
[33:42] amen amen praise God let's go to Romans
[33:44] chapter nine I'd like to pick up there
[33:46] and try to finish Romans n9ine here
[33:49] tonight by God's
[33:55] grace
[33:59] by God's grace we'll focus on verse uh
[34:01] 32 but let's read just Romans 9:32 here
[34:10] tonight and just reminder you know we
[34:12] have brother Simon coming I believe it's
[34:14] March 10th or 11th let me just check
[34:16] real quick we're quickly getting into
[34:18] March Yeah March 10th and then brother
[34:20] uh Diggs I was texting him today he
[34:22] should be coming on March 24th by God's
[34:25] grace we have communion on March 31st
[34:27] the Lord's Supper there so those are
[34:29] kind of three important dates here
[34:30] coming up for March brother cam asked me
[34:33] to preach uh and so I told him either
[34:35] March 10th I'd probably go over to
[34:36] Napoleon or March 24th depending on how
[34:38] that works out I know they have a youth
[34:40] meeting on the 23rd so um I'm going to
[34:43] try to go to brother cams maybe on March
[34:44] 10th we'll kind of see how that goes
[34:48] um sure we look forward to seeing the
[34:50] Saints there in Theo by God's
[34:52] grace so uh Romans 9:32 we'll just read
[34:55] that one verse and we'll have you be
[34:56] seated here by the grace of the
[34:59] Lord last night I put out a video um I
[35:02] kind of been preaching on it numerous
[35:04] times but I was working on that video um
[35:05] the dangers of leaving the message is
[35:07] showing how if people reject the truth
[35:09] the only thing that's left for them is
[35:11] the evil spirits right because the Bible
[35:13] says you uh if you give heed to a
[35:16] seducing Spirit it means to take on that
[35:18] spirit so to turn down the truth is to
[35:22] take heed or accept or Harbor an evil
[35:25] spirit so what a what a privilege we
[35:28] have church to be clean in the sight of
[35:29] Christ tonight amen we don't want to
[35:31] take that for granted uh we're so
[35:33] thankful for the truth that sets us free
[35:36] Hallelujah so let's read Romans
[35:40] 9:32 let's read that on three one two
[35:42] three wherefore because they sought it
[35:46] not by faith but as it were by The Works
[35:49] of the law for they stumbled at that
[35:53] stumbling Stone amen may God add his
[35:55] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[35:56] may be
[36:04] seated Hallelujah we'll preach the word
[36:07] of God here tonight look at more on
[36:08] Romans got a couple nice feedback from
[36:11] this weekend and last few services so
[36:12] I'm thankful the Lord has been helping
[36:14] people uh through these sermons here by
[36:17] the grace of God we'll try to finish
[36:19] here Romans 9ine and U um then Lord
[36:22] willing we'll look at I just want to add
[36:24] a few different thoughts you know Sunday
[36:25] was kind of Sunday was so unique right
[36:27] we had no musicians other than 10 finger
[36:31] musicians that can
[36:33] clap um and I actually I had a thought I
[36:36] was just a similar thought I was going
[36:37] to share I never got to it I kind of
[36:38] skipped over it forgot it so I'll preach
[36:41] a little bit on that tonight by God's
[36:42] grace but is it nice to have Malachi
[36:44] back there by God's grace and good to
[36:46] see brother the amen I know his gift is
[36:48] such a tremendous blessing to us all and
[36:51] um we're so thankful to to have
[36:53] musicians praise God we're so blessed it
[36:55] kind of took me back to when we first
[36:56] first started the
[36:57] church I was like my one day one day
[37:00] we'll have a musician one
[37:01] day and we're thankful for all these
[37:03] days that we're blessed to have faithful
[37:05] musicians by God's grace so I want to
[37:08] back up though to Romans 9:28 and I'll
[37:10] kind of preach through this last few
[37:12] verses here share a few thoughts that
[37:14] the Lord put on my heart and some of
[37:16] them I didn't get to on
[37:18] Sunday because I just forgot about
[37:24] them okay so Romans 9:28 the Bible says
[37:28] for he will finish the work and cut it
[37:30] short in righteousness because a short
[37:32] work will the Lord make upon the Earth
[37:36] and so I want to take a few thoughts out
[37:37] of here you know on Sunday I showed how
[37:39] the
[37:40] timeline uh is divided up you know for
[37:43] in 6,000 years we have 6,000 years of
[37:45] human history each of the 2,000 year
[37:48] chunks those three chunks God did
[37:50] something major and we know in this last
[37:52] chunk God sent a prophet with the spirit
[37:55] of Elijah a son of man Ministry and then
[37:59] uh to forun the coming of Christ the
[38:02] physical coming of Christ The Rapture
[38:04] Hallelujah and so you know I'm just
[38:06] watching I'm sure you are watching the
[38:08] government and I'm watching especially
[38:10] United States government to see when
[38:12] will they legalize Christian persecution
[38:14] that's what I'm watching you know with
[38:16] each passing year and week and month I'm
[38:18] just watching that and I feel like when
[38:21] I see the United States government uh
[38:23] sanctioning uh Christian persecution
[38:26] then we know the raptures on by God's
[38:27] grace it'll be very short time uh by the
[38:30] grace of God and you know one way they
[38:32] are persecuting people you know I don't
[38:34] know if you've seen but they they
[38:35] specifically targeted you know anyone
[38:38] that would be a pro conservative right
[38:41] um they made they've made thousands of
[38:43] arrests of people that just visited the
[38:45] capital on January 6
[38:48] 2021 and I showed you the video the one
[38:50] time you know they uh they made all the
[38:52] pro-conservative people out to be
[38:54] pro-christian
[38:55] um and uh they were so they were making
[38:58] Christians the bad guys on January 6th
[39:00] and so forth and then you know of course
[39:03] they're they're using uh different
[39:04] cities that are are are liberal run
[39:08] they're they're weaponizing the the
[39:10] judge the courts and the judges against
[39:12] anyone who's conservative trying to
[39:13] strip all their property thank God we
[39:16] live in a pretty conservative state by
[39:18] God's grace but there's people that live
[39:20] in you know liberal areas like
[39:22] California and you know DC and and New
[39:26] York they're getting literally
[39:28] persecuted right so we see it it's
[39:30] starting to slowly creep out we're
[39:31] starting to see that persecution and
[39:33] don't forget brother brand said thus
[39:34] sayith the Lord the same persecution
[39:37] that was in the Roman government is
[39:38] coming to the United States so I just
[39:40] want to we we as we look at this verse
[39:43] remember that it's to us it seems like a
[39:46] very slow thing right to us it might
[39:47] seem like it's long far off but uh the
[39:50] Bible calls it a short work 6,000 years
[39:54] is a short work to a timeless God an
[39:57] eternal God 6,000 years is a very small
[40:00] amount of
[40:01] time right and so the Bible says here
[40:04] God is going to finish this work he's
[40:06] going to cut it short in righteousness
[40:08] in other words there's going to be a
[40:10] very uh small group of people that will
[40:12] live righteously hallelujah it's a short
[40:15] amount of time there's a small amount of
[40:17] people that are actually living
[40:19] righteously on the earth
[40:21] Hallelujah God's going to make it a
[40:23] short work you know we've just had 2,000
[40:25] years of the gospel uh preached right
[40:28] but that's a very short time that's like
[40:30] two days right because a day with the
[40:32] Lord is as a thousand years with man
[40:34] think about that just been two days what
[40:36] were you doing two days ago on Monday
[40:38] can you think of that well we're
[40:39] enjoying some sunshine right right I was
[40:42] outside I was outside playing with my my
[40:44] little boys Z were playing football
[40:45] outside and tackling each other rolling
[40:47] around the grass that was just two days
[40:49] ago look look at the change today within
[40:51] two days but that's what God is like
[40:53] that the day of Pentecost was just two
[40:56] days days ago in the mind of God just
[40:58] two days ago that's how short it was
[41:02] right and so you know in some ways we we
[41:04] we feel like time is going so slow my
[41:06] it's been almost 60 years since brother
[41:07] BR went off the scene he had all these
[41:09] warnings about judgment you know
[41:11] judgment to the West Coast All These
[41:13] Warnings about the coming of the Lord
[41:14] and to us it feels like a long time but
[41:17] the Bible says it's a short work so we
[41:19] got to take our minds and remember
[41:21] everything's working out just as God
[41:23] said it Hallelujah in other words the
[41:25] end will be here before before we
[41:26] realize it made me think of all the
[41:28] heroes of the faith this week I thought
[41:30] of all the heroes that have been down
[41:31] through the church ages even you know
[41:33] Martin Luther John Wesley all these
[41:35] Heroes down through the church ages
[41:36] Martin and Columba all these Heroes
[41:39] their lives have come and gone and we
[41:41] just read about them right in our minds
[41:43] in our imaginations we think my what it
[41:45] would have been like to live like that
[41:47] what were their lives like and church it
[41:49] it ought to make us you know to redeem
[41:51] the time because the days are evil right
[41:55] if God carries pretty soon you know our
[41:57] lives will just be a story it'll be a
[41:58] story in somebody's in somebody's mind
[42:01] probably just our family members right
[42:03] because we're not we're not a brother
[42:04] brandom we're not a Billy Graham or
[42:06] we're not anything like that you know
[42:08] we're gonna we're going to have our
[42:09] lives as a testimony in some family
[42:11] members
[42:12] mind and so we must remember God's going
[42:15] to make it a short work on the earth you
[42:18] know time moves quickly right as we get
[42:21] older time moves faster I was talking
[42:23] with a parent today it's almost the end
[42:24] of the school year already we're coming
[42:26] up on the end of the air feels like it
[42:27] just started right so sometimes it feels
[42:30] like it moves slow you know but
[42:32] sometimes it moves feels like it moves
[42:34] quickly but here in God's eyes we get
[42:37] this idea God is going to cut it short
[42:40] God is looking for someone righteous and
[42:42] I love that that's what Abraham prayed
[42:43] for God if there's 50 if there's 40 if
[42:46] there's 30 if there's 20 and finally God
[42:49] if there's 10 have mercy if there's 10
[42:52] and God said I'll have mercy if there's
[42:54] 10 my but but yet God couldn't find 10
[42:58] righteous people in Sodom he only found
[43:02] uh four right but then one of them
[43:03] wasn't righteous as it turned out there
[43:05] was only three righteous people in that
[43:08] entire city well I look around here I
[43:10] see I see well aran's got a pretty good
[43:12] amount by God's grace right we got more
[43:14] than three Hallelujah let's continue to
[43:16] be the righteous Hallelujah let's
[43:18] continue to sigh and cry for the
[43:19] Abominations done in the city Hallelujah
[43:22] now Jesus also said in Matthew 24:21 we
[43:25] get the same idea for then shall be
[43:27] Great Tribulation such as not since the
[43:29] beginning of the world to this time no
[43:31] nor ever shall be that's speaking of the
[43:33] tribulation period the seven-year
[43:35] tribulation and except those days should
[43:37] be shortened there should no flesh be
[43:40] saved but for the elect sake those days
[43:43] will be
[43:45] shortened so we know there must be some
[43:47] elect there'll be some uh Jewish right
[43:49] there'll be some Jewish uh Believers
[43:51] that will receive the Holy Ghost they're
[43:53] no doubt the elect I believe there will
[43:54] be even foolish virgins of the Jews I
[43:57] believe there'll be some foolish virgin
[43:58] Christians brother Ram says they'll be
[44:00] saved but they'll have to give their
[44:02] lives of course right because they will
[44:04] not take the mark of the beast so notice
[44:06] we have two verses there then uh from
[44:08] Romans here and from Jesus in Matthew 24
[44:12] that the the days are going to be cut
[44:14] short right the people are going to act
[44:16] and feel like the the time is going to
[44:18] keep moving on but God said I'm going to
[44:20] cut it short in righteousness so that
[44:22] somebody could be saved Hallelujah by
[44:26] so time is moving we'd say swiftly by go
[44:30] swiftly by God's grace pardon me now
[44:33] going back to Romans 9:29 and as Isaiah
[44:35] said before except the Lord of Sabbath
[44:38] that means the Lord of hosts had left us
[44:40] a seed we had been as Sodom and B uh and
[44:45] been made like unto gamorra so here we
[44:48] see God's longsuffering is magnified
[44:52] right and we could all say Amen to that
[44:54] if it hadn't been for God who who left
[44:56] us the word of God if it hadn't been God
[44:59] who who' had mercy on us right we would
[45:02] have all been just all Filthy Sinners
[45:04] right and so I love this God uh you know
[45:07] God gets all the credit
[45:09] Hallelujah you know I heard a couple uh
[45:12] um heard a couple more people say they
[45:13] were the greatest of all time I went
[45:15] over some uh you know I heard a preacher
[45:18] you know I went back and listen to that
[45:19] the preacher who said we have the
[45:20] greatest young people of all time and
[45:23] you know uh you know people
[45:26] people want to uh try to compliment
[45:29] people they want to make them feel good
[45:31] but that's not the way to make people
[45:32] feel good is by flattering them you know
[45:35] that's not the way the Bible said
[45:37] flattering words worketh ruin the Bible
[45:39] says that's that will actually ruin a
[45:41] person by telling them how great they
[45:43] are all the time right now we know
[45:46] people sometimes want to have some roses
[45:48] right brother said I'd rather give them
[45:49] a rose now rather than later when
[45:50] they're dead you know uh we understand
[45:52] that that's a that's a that's a
[45:55] principle as well too we want to tell
[45:56] people how much we appreciate them but
[45:59] see when it comes down to it you know
[46:01] the Bible says here with with with
[46:02] Israel it's God who left them a seed
[46:06] it's God who gave them another chance
[46:08] right it's God who gave us a seed and we
[46:11] know the real seed is the Holy Ghost
[46:13] hallelujah amen except God had given us
[46:16] the Holy Ghost we had all been lost
[46:18] praise
[46:19] God we've been made like unto Sodom and
[46:22] Gomorrah if it wasn't for the seed of
[46:24] God hallelujah if it wasn't for the word
[46:26] of God we'd all be lost Hallelujah so we
[46:29] see God's grace again magnified
[46:32] Hallelujah we all been Wicked or in
[46:34] other words abominable Sinners praise
[46:37] God if it wasn't for God's mercy would
[46:39] akan even have a message church right
[46:42] like brother Steve prayed brother Steve
[46:43] said I prayed for 15 years God would
[46:45] raise up a message church amen if it
[46:48] wasn't for God right there'd be no seed
[46:49] in acon Hallelujah but God was merciful
[46:52] praise God and of course you know I love
[46:55] you know the Ephesians chapter 2 that
[46:57] great phrase but God we were dead in
[47:00] sins and TR transgressions but God moved
[47:02] on this scene Hallelujah but God changed
[47:05] my life Hallelujah God changed your life
[47:08] amen we were all dead and sins and
[47:11] transgressions Hallelujah it wasn't for
[47:13] God we'd all been like Sodom and
[47:15] Gomorrah but God left us a seed God sent
[47:18] you the message God sent you the Bible
[47:20] Hallelujah God sent you the word of God
[47:22] God Gave You Grace God Gave You mercy
[47:25] God gave you chance after chance after
[47:27] chance it was God who did it hallelujah
[47:30] amen except God had moved on the scene
[47:32] I'd have been like Sodom and gomorah
[47:35] amen and God of course you know Paul is
[47:37] applying this of course to Israel but we
[47:40] know the same is for uh the Gentile
[47:42] because we'd already read it there how
[47:44] God said you were not my people but now
[47:47] you're my people hallelujah you are not
[47:49] my children but now you're my children
[47:51] amen hallelujah like we had nothing to
[47:53] do with it it was God's mercy and God
[47:55] Grace Hallelujah and we're going to see
[47:57] in two chapters God there's a re one of
[48:00] the reasons God does it is to make
[48:01] Israel jealous right that's one reason
[48:04] God did that was to make Israel jealous
[48:07] in other words Israel like a blind
[48:09] Jewish Israeli illegalist would look at
[48:11] the the the Christians and see the
[48:13] liberty of the Christianity and the
[48:15] power of Christianity and they would be
[48:18] jealous right because we have freedom
[48:20] Joy power love we have all these great
[48:23] blessings so church we should live in
[48:25] such a life where people should be
[48:27] jealous of our Lives amen I know they
[48:30] are I I know like I've told you before I
[48:31] know people have told me well I wish my
[48:33] family was like yours or I wish we had a
[48:36] church like yours I've had people tell
[48:37] me that right so I know there's some
[48:39] spiritual jealousy well that might be a
[48:41] good thing right it might stir them up
[48:44] or something like that right you know
[48:47] we've had people like we remember Sister
[48:49] Connie she moved all the way up here
[48:50] because she wanted to be a part of the
[48:51] church to believe this now of course
[48:53] then you know things change but think
[48:55] about about that I mean people would
[48:57] would travel and go great distances I
[48:59] drove three hours one way because I
[49:01] wanted a spiritual walk like brother
[49:03] Brooks had every Sunday that's six hours
[49:06] Hallelujah right it's that it's that
[49:08] desire to be like Christ hallelujah
[49:11] amen and so God is gracious God is
[49:14] longsuffering God has given us the
[49:16] greatest thing that ever was a
[49:18] relationship with Christ Hallelujah a
[49:21] spiritual position as a Christian is the
[49:23] greatest thing we could ask for praise
[49:25] God God and church remember whatever we
[49:27] do now is what will be later praise God
[49:30] just like Samuel he was a prophet uh
[49:32] before death he was a prophet after
[49:34] death amen let's be a real saint of God
[49:37] now and God will have many blessings for
[49:39] us later as well praise God let's make
[49:41] our calling election sure praise God
[49:43] Amen verse 30 Romans 9:30 what shall we
[49:47] say then that the Gentiles which follow
[49:49] not after righteousness have attained to
[49:52] righteousness even the righteousness
[49:54] which is of faith
[49:56] so we in other words we weren't
[49:57] following after it we were we were
[49:59] Sinners the Gentiles were but God left
[50:02] us a seed and God let us achieve
[50:05] something that we weren't even looking
[50:07] for Hallelujah right that just that just
[50:11] that just screams God's mercy that's
[50:13] just to me that just shouts God is
[50:15] gracious God gives you something a
[50:17] reward you weren't even really looking
[50:19] for praise God Hallelujah by and we
[50:22] looked we of course we finished with
[50:23] that on Sunday morning Hal
[50:26] you've attained God's righteousness in
[50:28] other words in heaven God sees your
[50:30] righteousness because it's Jesus's
[50:32] righteousness he shared with us right
[50:35] you have attained it's something you can
[50:37] say I've I've attained that I've
[50:39] attained it by faith Hallelujah God's
[50:42] given me his righteousness he shared his
[50:44] righteousness with me but like Paul said
[50:46] I'm pressing for the attainment of the
[50:49] first resurrection that's what I'm
[50:51] pressing towards
[50:53] Hallelujah and so see we didn't follow
[50:55] after the
[50:56] righteousness uh of the law like the
[50:59] like the Jews did or Israel did uh we
[51:02] didn't have the law of Moses and it's a
[51:04] it's a shame we didn't because Paul said
[51:06] the law was a good thing right but but
[51:09] trying to uh trying to fulfill the law
[51:11] with our flesh was impossible right but
[51:15] see now we attain righteousness because
[51:17] it's God's Gift I'm looking forward to
[51:19] preaching chapter 10 chapter 10's really
[51:21] beautiful but I'll just let me just uh
[51:24] share a little early by God's grace the
[51:26] Bible said uh you know the gospel is so
[51:30] simple he said the word of God is nigh
[51:32] to you even in your
[51:34] lips Hallelujah you don't have to ascend
[51:37] up to heaven to get it you don't got to
[51:39] descend down to the The Depths to get it
[51:41] the Bible said the word is in your mouth
[51:44] and church that's that's how simple
[51:46] faith is I believe it praise God well if
[51:48] God promised it I believe it praise God
[51:51] I'm speaking of the righteousness of God
[51:53] I'm speaking of faith I'm speaking of
[51:54] the fact I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm
[51:56] filled with the Holy Ghost all these
[51:58] blessings God has given to us just speak
[52:00] the word hallelujah amen all these
[52:02] Needful Things that that are so
[52:04] important to the Christian walk having
[52:06] faith being justified Sanctified being
[52:09] filled with the holy spirit all these
[52:10] things are just freely given to us and
[52:13] it's by faith Hallelujah just believing
[52:16] it knowing what God Said is true
[52:18] Hallelujah God will back up his word
[52:21] amen now I'm just that's a beautiful
[52:23] part of chapter 10 by God's grace
[52:25] now Romans 9:31 but Israel which
[52:28] followed after the law of righteousness
[52:31] hath not attained to that law of
[52:32] righteousness why wherefore why why
[52:36] not because they sought they sought it
[52:38] not by faith but as it were by The Works
[52:42] of the law for they stumbled at The
[52:46] Stumbling Stone Hallelujah now you and I
[52:50] when we come to Christ Christ was not a
[52:52] stumbling Stone Christ was a stepping
[52:54] stone
[52:55] right cuz Paul he said I'm the
[52:58] foundation he said let every man take
[53:00] heat how he builds upon the foundation
[53:02] so when we come to the gospel the gospel
[53:04] became a stepping stone for us in other
[53:07] words we found our position in the body
[53:09] of Christ as leot and Saints right of
[53:11] the seven Church ages we find our
[53:13] position and we can go a step higher in
[53:16] God hallelujah but the Jews stumbled
[53:19] over the gospel they stumbled over
[53:22] Christ and the Bible tells us why
[53:25] because they didn't seek it by Faith by
[53:29] which is trust or Assurance it's a
[53:32] spiritual transaction praise God faith
[53:35] is a substance hallelujah how many have
[53:38] the substance of Faith tonight it's
[53:40] something like it's inside of me
[53:42] Hallelujah yeah do I battle you know my
[53:44] flesh and my mind yes but if I can just
[53:46] get past that if I can just talk it over
[53:48] with Jesus a little bit then I can feel
[53:50] that I have faith inside of my soul
[53:53] hallelujah amen see they sought it by
[53:57] works so they were trying to work their
[53:59] way into feeling God's righteousness and
[54:02] that will never
[54:04] work you'll because you'll never have
[54:06] enough works to feel righteous now I'm
[54:08] talking about the righteousness of
[54:10] Salvation Hallelujah I'm not talking
[54:12] about you know our daily righteousness
[54:14] that we should strive for in other words
[54:15] doing what's right right I'm talking
[54:18] about righteousness by faith Israel
[54:20] stumbled at that it was it was too
[54:23] simple for them but now of course
[54:25] there's a reason Hallelujah there's a
[54:27] reason they stumbled at it let's go to
[54:29] Matthew chapter
[54:33] 15 why was Jesus a stumbling Stone let's
[54:36] review this just briefly here by God's
[54:42] grace verse three of course they're
[54:44] talking about washing hands why don't
[54:45] they follow uh the the traditions of the
[54:47] elders verse three but he answered and
[54:49] said unto them why do you transgress the
[54:50] Commandment of God by your tradition for
[54:54] God commanded saying honor thy father
[54:56] and and mother and he that curses father
[54:59] mother let him die the
[55:02] death okay going down to verse 7 ye
[55:04] Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of
[55:06] you saying this people draws nine to me
[55:08] with their mouth and honor honth me with
[55:11] their lips but their heart is far from
[55:13] me but in vain they do worship me
[55:15] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[55:18] of men now this is why as message
[55:20] Believers we should be so thankful that
[55:22] everything we believe is in the Bible
[55:24] praise God
[55:26] right and that's why I have questions
[55:27] answers on Sunday night I want to know
[55:29] what's on the people's heart and I want
[55:31] to know if I'm wrong I want somebody to
[55:32] correct me by God's grace right because
[55:35] here's the point I want to get to
[55:36] tonight I don't want to become a
[55:38] Pharisee right it's it's very easy for
[55:42] for for people to fall into Pharisee
[55:44] religion especially in the message right
[55:47] it's very easy and I put this on my
[55:49] podcast this morning when I put up the
[55:51] podcast you know I used to say this you
[55:52] know uh We call we call our our
[55:55] following the message right well some
[55:56] people somebody came up with this and
[55:58] they called it this is the mess age have
[56:00] you ever heard that before mess age and
[56:03] I used to say that years ago but now I
[56:04] don't because I've kind of matured past
[56:06] that because I've realized every age is
[56:09] a mess age because there's very few
[56:12] people actually
[56:13] saved and preachers would use it to bash
[56:16] other message churches and church I
[56:18] don't need to bash them they already
[56:19] they're they're already bashed right I
[56:21] mean they're already disobedient to
[56:23] God uh I feel like people have used that
[56:26] um this is a mess age to kind of just
[56:28] blast the overall age I don't want you
[56:29] to be discouraged I want to be I want
[56:31] you to be encouraged by God's grace
[56:33] Hallelujah I want you to be The Shining
[56:35] Light I want you to be the city on a
[56:37] hill that cannot be hidden praise God we
[56:40] don't judge ourselves by other churches
[56:42] you know the Bible says you can follow
[56:43] other churches in other words get some
[56:44] inspiration but let's let's strive to be
[56:47] like the early church Hallelujah that's
[56:48] what we've always tried to do amen we've
[56:50] always tried to strive to be like that
[56:52] early church to be the example Temple
[56:55] praise God to be a city on a hill that
[56:58] cannot be hidden and not to go into
[57:00] Pharisee
[57:02] religion and I'm talk and even cam you
[57:04] know shared a testimony with me that uh
[57:06] at their Church you know cam recently
[57:08] preached and he said the Holy Ghost fell
[57:09] when he was just trying to he's just
[57:11] trying to labor on it's not by works
[57:13] it's not by works it's not by works and
[57:15] they got a nice breakthrough so I kind
[57:16] of want to bring a little bit of that
[57:17] inspiration here tonight hallelujah it's
[57:20] just that it's that reality that it's by
[57:23] Grace amen it's by grace through faith
[57:26] Hallelujah and sometimes we we we
[57:28] there's two remember there's two kinds
[57:30] of righteousness I preached on it last
[57:31] month there's a righteousness that we're
[57:33] given by grace in other words in the
[57:35] standing of God we're the we get we
[57:38] already are the children of God
[57:40] hallelujah and see that ought to raise
[57:42] our faith for whatever trial we're going
[57:45] through in life Hallelujah to know that
[57:47] I already have the righteousness of
[57:49] Christ now in my daily walk yes I want
[57:51] to live a righteous life but remember
[57:53] church as soon as you confess and say
[57:55] sorry and you're trying to draw n to God
[57:58] and resist Satan then you're back you're
[58:00] back at a perfect condition Hallelujah
[58:03] you're you're free from sin
[58:08] Hallelujah but but you know this people
[58:10] you know this is why they stumbled at
[58:13] Christ because he was against their
[58:16] Traditions
[58:18] right and I'm just going to name a few
[58:20] you know I named them before but I I've
[58:21] come across some new CH new uh uh
[58:24] Pharisee mess is Traditions I didn't
[58:25] hear about anymore now I've already said
[58:27] these to you before um short sleeves on
[58:30] men used to be like in some Churches
[58:31] that's sin you cannot wear short sleeves
[58:33] now show me that in the Bible right
[58:35] right but it becomes such a legalistic
[58:38] thing it becomes a Pharisee religion
[58:41] here's one you know some people said to
[58:43] I don't know maybe I share this with you
[58:44] or not I don't know but it was a sin for
[58:46] women to to wear shoes that show their
[58:48] toes some Churches have that legalism
[58:51] women cannot show their toes in the
[58:54] church
[58:57] uh it just it's it's crazy it's crazy I
[59:01] mean that's all they wore in the in the
[59:03] Bible is
[59:06] Sandals
[59:07] right but it it's a you know it's a
[59:10] man-made thing well we're more
[59:13] holy
[59:15] right uh one of them that qu it's I
[59:18] don't know if I shared this one before
[59:19] but a lot of M churches say women cannot
[59:22] wear skirts that have zippers in the
[59:23] front
[59:25] because it's too much like jeans it's
[59:27] like a man's clothing and they will they
[59:30] will preach it like it's you're wearing
[59:33] men's clothes if your skirt has a zipper
[59:35] in the front I'm like where is that in
[59:37] the Bible can somebody show me that in
[59:38] the
[59:40] Bible and and just because well it kind
[59:42] of looks like jeans and I can't tell if
[59:44] it's a man or woman well look
[59:46] harder look at the hair
[59:49] then I mean where does the bible say a
[59:52] zipper is is a Abomination the sight of
[59:55] God you see it's to build their own
[59:58] righteousness one church I even listen I
[1:00:00] heard the preacher say this he said if a
[1:00:02] man uh if if a man gets a cup of coffee
[1:00:05] served to him from any other woman other
[1:00:07] than his wife it's like potentially
[1:00:09] adultery it just what where is this
[1:00:14] where what about Jesus remember all
[1:00:16] those women fed him and they just fed
[1:00:17] him you know
[1:00:20] they where where where do people get
[1:00:22] these things right here's a new one I
[1:00:25] never knew this before uh men wearing
[1:00:28] pink clothes to church is a sin that's
[1:00:31] what people have said lately now I knew
[1:00:33] brother BR makes he says pink a couple
[1:00:35] times he was talking about how men they
[1:00:36] they wear pink suede shoes and he says
[1:00:39] what kind of man would wear something
[1:00:41] like
[1:00:42] that right and so I can see you know I
[1:00:45] knew that and so that's why you know
[1:00:46] that's that's always been in the back of
[1:00:48] my mind right so I've never you've never
[1:00:49] seen me wear pink when I'm preaching and
[1:00:51] I challenge you go check just because of
[1:00:54] it was a question in my mind but where
[1:00:56] where is that in the Bible the church
[1:01:00] say you see now for me if there's any
[1:01:04] question well I'm just going to leave it
[1:01:06] alone right but I you can't preach it as
[1:01:08] a Bible Doctrine we're talking about the
[1:01:11] righteousness of Christ here
[1:01:13] tonight right keep your mind on the
[1:01:15] Bible right because we here's all these
[1:01:17] ideas now what's the Bible say and see
[1:01:20] see how phariseeism can so easily get
[1:01:23] into a real good church
[1:01:25] it can just slip well there's one quote
[1:01:27] well yeah there's lots of quotes I just
[1:01:30] found a quote this week where brother
[1:01:31] man said Sinners will burn in hell
[1:01:33] eternally brother BR said they'll burn
[1:01:35] in hell
[1:01:36] eternally but then you know he he he
[1:01:39] gets the Revelation later right he's
[1:01:41] he's growing he let's let him be a man
[1:01:43] let's let's let him grow in Grace and
[1:01:45] knowledge of the Lord
[1:01:47] hallelujah remember Church don't forget
[1:01:50] Martin Luther wrote some things that
[1:01:51] cause some people to burn down Jewish
[1:01:53] synagogues
[1:01:55] right some of his mistakes that he
[1:01:58] made right and yet he's one of the most
[1:02:01] famous Christians and had some of the
[1:02:03] greatest impact ever on the the church
[1:02:05] the New Testament Church people say it's
[1:02:07] so hard to measure his impact because
[1:02:10] being justified by grace through faith
[1:02:12] was such an amazing Revelation where' he
[1:02:15] get it the book of Romans amen
[1:02:17] hallelujah and then of course there's
[1:02:19] there's two I put out this or the last
[1:02:21] few weeks uh the brothers from Ghana
[1:02:23] emailed me this they said Flatt top
[1:02:25] haircuts that's a sin and that that
[1:02:29] that's become legalism in some
[1:02:31] Churches and so I went and looked it up
[1:02:33] brother Ram condemned it eight times I
[1:02:36] think I preach it here a couple weeks
[1:02:37] ago but then the last two they asked him
[1:02:39] directly is it sin he said no brother he
[1:02:41] said you just wait till you're my age he
[1:02:42] said then you'll have a flat top because
[1:02:43] you'll lose all your
[1:02:45] hair but he says no brother that's not
[1:02:47] sin I just say things like that okay so
[1:02:51] that's what he said I just say things
[1:02:53] like that now here's Here's my thought
[1:02:55] brother ROM saw all these rich people
[1:02:56] what was the trends what were the trends
[1:02:58] of the day you know haircuts and or you
[1:03:00] know flat tops like you know some of the
[1:03:02] famous guys I don't know Elvis haircuts
[1:03:05] and so whatever is kind of trending he
[1:03:07] just blasts right but when it comes down
[1:03:10] to it he says I don't have any scripture
[1:03:12] for that as long as he cuts his hair
[1:03:14] he's all right and the church said but
[1:03:17] that has become legalism in some some
[1:03:19] American churches too not not just those
[1:03:21] brothers from Africa that email me right
[1:03:24] the other one is floor dancing did you
[1:03:26] see that video I put out brother R says
[1:03:28] I don't believe in floor dancing and
[1:03:30] some Churches have have read made that
[1:03:32] quote Into You Can't Dance by The Altar
[1:03:36] and the word altar is not even in the
[1:03:39] quote but somebody's mind just made okay
[1:03:42] floor dancing must mean you can't dance
[1:03:44] by the
[1:03:45] altar it's not even in the quote if you
[1:03:47] read the quote brother's talking about a
[1:03:49] man a man can't hug up on a woman and if
[1:03:52] if if she hugs up on him and and her
[1:03:54] body parts such his body parts he'll
[1:03:56] have Sensations right which is sexual I
[1:03:58] mean Temptation right that's true that's
[1:04:00] true but that's what brother ramom is
[1:04:02] calling floor dances now when does that
[1:04:04] ever happen at any message Church you
[1:04:06] know where a man is hugging a woman
[1:04:08] Let's Dance right can you picture it if
[1:04:10] I'm married to my wife and I'm you were
[1:04:12] not going to dance like that in the
[1:04:13] church but how can how can that happen
[1:04:17] people are trying to what establish
[1:04:20] their own
[1:04:22] righteousness pink shoes
[1:04:25] shoes that you show your toes short
[1:04:28] sleeves is a sin they're trying to
[1:04:30] establish their own righteousness and
[1:04:33] I'll say another one this I know this
[1:04:34] one made me really unpopular but
[1:04:36] ministers have to marry virgins that
[1:04:37] made me really
[1:04:39] unpopular but that is those men those
[1:04:42] churches they're establishing their own
[1:04:44] righteousness and there's no Bible for
[1:04:46] it right because if you apply that you
[1:04:48] got to apply all all the requirements
[1:04:51] and then St Paul wasn't a prophet then
[1:04:53] because he had had eye trouble and a a a
[1:04:56] priest can't have a eye blemish well
[1:04:58] then you kick Paul out of it well now
[1:05:00] you lost almost all the New Testament
[1:05:02] you don't have much left you don't have
[1:05:04] modesty left because that's the only
[1:05:05] Bible verse on modesty is 1 Timothy
[1:05:08] 2:9 see what see what this
[1:05:11] is and that's what Jesus that that's
[1:05:14] what he he was preaching get back to the
[1:05:15] word back but they had they buil up
[1:05:17] their own traditions of men he said then
[1:05:19] in vain you worship
[1:05:21] me and then Jesus became a stumbling
[1:05:24] Stone because Jesus was saying get back
[1:05:26] to the word back to the word it's only
[1:05:29] the word you must keep God's commands
[1:05:32] not man's commands Hallelujah now I've
[1:05:34] always told you this if I if you want my
[1:05:36] opinion I'll give you my opinion on
[1:05:38] something right so that's my opinion I
[1:05:40] won't wear pink when I preach but I've
[1:05:41] worn pink to school on Valentine's Day I
[1:05:43] have one pink shirt and I wear that pink
[1:05:45] shirt on Valentine's Day because that's
[1:05:48] the color for Valentine's Day you know
[1:05:51] it just doesn't it doesn't condemn me
[1:05:53] right right but I can't find any Bible
[1:05:55] for
[1:05:57] that so this is what you know this is
[1:06:00] some of the thoughts I had that can
[1:06:01] relate to us because it does relate to
[1:06:04] churches like ours if we're not careful
[1:06:07] we establish our own
[1:06:09] righteousness okay but we must
[1:06:12] understand that God's righteousness
[1:06:13] comes by Grace it's a gift of
[1:06:17] God like that song I didn't earn it I
[1:06:20] don't deserve it right still you give
[1:06:24] yourself away oh the precious love of
[1:06:26] God Amen see that that's that's where
[1:06:29] righteousness comes from it's the gift
[1:06:30] of God and we must seek God's
[1:06:33] righteousness by faith in other words if
[1:06:35] God said it then I believe it praise God
[1:06:38] hallelujah but see people stumble
[1:06:40] because they create their own doctrines
[1:06:43] of
[1:06:44] men
[1:06:46] right and what they've done is they've
[1:06:48] added their own ideas and they and they
[1:06:51] take out the word of God and God said
[1:06:53] I'm going to to call you a liar on the
[1:06:55] day of judgment if you do that if you
[1:06:57] add any word Proverbs 35 and6 if you add
[1:06:59] anything or take anything away I'm
[1:07:01] calling you a liar that's why I put on
[1:07:03] that video anybody who adds three
[1:07:05] persons or anyone who takes out modesty
[1:07:07] God's Gonna you have a lying Spirit on
[1:07:09] you they're Anointed with a lying Spirit
[1:07:11] may God help us to have the spirit of
[1:07:13] truth
[1:07:14] hallelujah right or the spe of erir er
[1:07:17] means an evil spirit that'll take you in
[1:07:19] the wrong direction may we stay on the
[1:07:22] straight and narrow path Hallelujah
[1:07:24] because Jesus is the way the straight
[1:07:26] way Hallelujah the way the truth and the
[1:07:30] life so see Israel stumbled at this
[1:07:33] because they had their own traditions of
[1:07:36] men and we must not
[1:07:38] become uh message
[1:07:42] Pharisees
[1:07:45] Hallelujah like I told you you know last
[1:07:47] week uh I emailed a brother who's an
[1:07:50] internet Prophet you know
[1:07:51] and um
[1:07:54] and he he called me he calls me a
[1:07:55] Pharisee he says thee Pharisees from
[1:07:57] akan Ohio that's what he calls
[1:07:59] me and I email back I said brother
[1:08:01] you're the faracy because you've created
[1:08:03] your own traditions of men he doesn't go
[1:08:05] to church he don't have a pastor he
[1:08:07] preaches you can't wear pink men can't
[1:08:09] wear
[1:08:10] pink he said thus sayith the Lord you
[1:08:12] have to take down brother Ram's picture
[1:08:14] in your church because it's uh it's now
[1:08:17] uh it's now wrong in the sight of God
[1:08:18] now where is that in the Bible see it's
[1:08:21] and then you know he'll make all these
[1:08:22] ballpark prophecies where there so
[1:08:24] General anything can be the
[1:08:25] interpretation of
[1:08:27] it well that's easy to see right but I
[1:08:30] caught him in some in some some
[1:08:31] prophecies that failed I called him and
[1:08:33] that's why I waited I waited until I got
[1:08:35] it and then I emailed it and now he just
[1:08:37] calls me a Pharisee but really he's the
[1:08:40] Pharisee because he's creating his own
[1:08:42] traditions of
[1:08:44] men
[1:08:46] right and he says I have a double
[1:08:48] portion of brother Adam's anointing well
[1:08:51] brother Adam's anointing made him go to
[1:08:52] church every time the doors were open
[1:08:54] and if your anointing makes you miss
[1:08:56] church then you don't got the double
[1:08:58] anointing and I said if you look at the
[1:09:01] Bible the double anointing is it's
[1:09:02] double Miracles Elijah did eight Elisha
[1:09:05] did 16 I said you better get started
[1:09:07] pretty soon on raising cripples from the
[1:09:10] other wheelchairs because brother R had
[1:09:12] a lot of
[1:09:13] those and uh children that had crooked
[1:09:16] eyes a lot of them went straight you
[1:09:18] better get started on that because
[1:09:19] that's the Bible interpretation of the
[1:09:20] double
[1:09:21] anointed Hallelujah
[1:09:25] and you know people can call me whatever
[1:09:27] they want but by their fruits Jesus said
[1:09:29] you're known
[1:09:33] Hallelujah and so we see this is what
[1:09:36] Israel stumbled they stumbled because
[1:09:39] Jesus showed them in the word where they
[1:09:41] were wrong and they didn't want to
[1:09:42] change their
[1:09:43] ways that's
[1:09:46] right now go to Matthew 23 this is just
[1:09:50] uh my last scripture here uh in this
[1:09:53] section here then we'll finish up the
[1:09:54] chapter I want to just close with a few
[1:09:56] things here by God's
[1:09:59] grace and church that's how I want to be
[1:10:01] I want to constantly examine my heart to
[1:10:03] make sure I'm not becoming
[1:10:06] prideful you I just read in I read was
[1:10:08] reading this week in Isaiah 28 and three
[1:10:10] times God told Israel you have a crown
[1:10:12] of Pride on right and that's where he
[1:10:14] said I've come in your sanctuary and
[1:10:16] it's full of
[1:10:17] vomit he said but how is how does the
[1:10:20] word of God come line upon line precept
[1:10:22] upon precept amen
[1:10:24] here a little there a little hallelujah
[1:10:27] amen and the Bible said we should not
[1:10:29] have the crown of Pride I think the
[1:10:31] Bible said to be the crown of the
[1:10:32] anointing or Crown of Glory that must be
[1:10:34] upon us because remember the Bible says
[1:10:36] the anointing breaks every yoke if you
[1:10:39] feel yolked up or you feel like you're
[1:10:40] addicted to something or struggling you
[1:10:42] know what you need you need the presence
[1:10:44] of God Amen because that will break
[1:10:46] every anointing Amen in other words just
[1:10:48] get in the joy of Jesus and all the
[1:10:50] anointing of Satan will be Broken
[1:10:52] Hallelujah how many know that's true by
[1:10:54] God's grace oh my happens in my life
[1:10:56] happens in so many people's lives just
[1:10:58] get in the prince of God uh and all your
[1:11:01] troubles vanish hearts are mended in the
[1:11:03] presence of the king hallelujah
[1:11:07] amen now uh Matthew
[1:11:10] 23 of course this is the rebuke Jesus
[1:11:13] gives eight woses to the Pharisees and
[1:11:16] woe uh is a grief eight
[1:11:20] griefs right eight judgments against
[1:11:23] them
[1:11:24] but notice in verse 1 231 then Jesus I'm
[1:11:28] sorry then spake Jesus to the multitude
[1:11:29] and to his disciples saying the scribes
[1:11:31] and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat
[1:11:32] right so the Pharisees will sit in the
[1:11:34] seat of brother
[1:11:35] brandham right for our day we got to
[1:11:37] bring this to our day they
[1:11:40] say they're brother braham's converts
[1:11:43] now so do I so again by your fruits you
[1:11:47] are known now these brothers some of
[1:11:49] these uh like I told you the goat
[1:11:51] preachers and everything like that now I
[1:11:52] respect them I just call them that
[1:11:53] because because they call themselves the
[1:11:54] greatest of all time but they they've
[1:11:56] been preaching that you know uh young
[1:11:58] preachers should come to them uh if they
[1:12:00] have questionable doctrines and run it
[1:12:02] through the elders and that is biblical
[1:12:05] remember the Bible said they took all
[1:12:06] the questions of the book of Acts to the
[1:12:07] elders but my question is what happens
[1:12:09] when the elders get a little prideful
[1:12:11] who's going to correct
[1:12:14] them right what happens when the elders
[1:12:17] start saying no such thing as uh uh
[1:12:20] there's no interracial marriage like
[1:12:22] they say what happens when the Elders
[1:12:23] break the word of God then who's going
[1:12:25] to correct them or the elders start
[1:12:28] saying I'm the greatest of all time
[1:12:29] we're the greatest what who's going to
[1:12:31] correct them are they open to correction
[1:12:34] is there going to be an Elders group to
[1:12:35] correct the
[1:12:37] elders see I mean they got some good
[1:12:39] ideas you know we should go to the uh
[1:12:42] more advanced ministers but what happens
[1:12:44] when they get some leaven in their
[1:12:47] midst see I I like the scripture I want
[1:12:50] the scripture by God's I'll follow the
[1:12:51] scriptural pattern if someone's been
[1:12:53] preaching longer than I've been alive
[1:12:55] well praise God I mean I wouldn't
[1:12:56] respect that what happens when they get
[1:12:58] off the word of God who's going to
[1:13:00] correct
[1:13:04] them verse two I'm sorry verse three all
[1:13:08] therefore whato they bid You observe
[1:13:10] that observe and do but do not ye after
[1:13:12] their works for they say and do not
[1:13:14] here's a clear sign of a Pharisee they
[1:13:16] say they tell you what to do but they
[1:13:18] don't do it
[1:13:21] themselves Hallelujah
[1:13:23] they tell you you do this but you don't
[1:13:25] see them he's going to say it later they
[1:13:26] don't even lift a finger to help you
[1:13:28] out mean you can't even lift a finger
[1:13:31] and text
[1:13:32] me right you can't lift the finger and
[1:13:36] call me see they won't do
[1:13:40] anything this is the sign of a Pharisee
[1:13:43] remember these are the same guys that
[1:13:45] got upset if Jesus healed on a
[1:13:49] Sunday same guys
[1:13:52] uh that that that just they they they
[1:13:54] they purposely tried to find wrong with
[1:13:57] Jesus they got mad about miracles oh
[1:14:00] yeah the one the other one too I was
[1:14:01] thinking on the way here Jesus said uh
[1:14:04] destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in
[1:14:06] three days and they got all mad because
[1:14:08] Jesus said and Jesus said there's going
[1:14:10] to come a time not one stone will be
[1:14:12] left upon that Temple and they got mad
[1:14:15] and they brought that accusation at his
[1:14:17] trial because they love their building
[1:14:19] so much see again Pharisees don't come
[1:14:22] against my property don't come against
[1:14:24] my building right don't come don't come
[1:14:27] against us we're the elders we know all
[1:14:29] about it we sit in the prophet's
[1:14:34] seat Paul says they went at it the wrong
[1:14:37] way they tried to seek their own
[1:14:39] righteousness they tried to create their
[1:14:41] own righteousness rather than the
[1:14:43] righteousness of Christ you know why
[1:14:45] you're righteous because you believe in
[1:14:46] the
[1:14:47] cross in the church
[1:14:49] said
[1:14:51] Hallelujah you know why you're right
[1:14:53] righteous because you believe Jesus died
[1:14:55] for you that's why you're
[1:14:57] righteous well brother just I did that
[1:14:59] no stop right there stop right there the
[1:15:01] cross is enough Hallelujah cross is
[1:15:03] enough for me well let me tell you
[1:15:05] brother Austin I've done this no brother
[1:15:06] just no no the cross made me righteous
[1:15:11] Hallelujah the cross may be righteous
[1:15:13] remember the Bible said Abraham was
[1:15:14] righteous before he got the circumcision
[1:15:16] well that means us we're righteous when
[1:15:18] we're
[1:15:18] Justified hallelujah we're righteous
[1:15:21] before we're Sanctified in the sight of
[1:15:23] God we're righteous before we get the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost we are righteous God declares
[1:15:26] us righteous before we get the
[1:15:29] circumcision Hallelujah That's The Power
[1:15:31] of
[1:15:33] justification amen verse three for they
[1:15:36] bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be
[1:15:37] born and lay them on men's shoulders but
[1:15:39] they themselves will not move them with
[1:15:41] one of their fingers they put all these
[1:15:44] burdens on everybody else you pray but
[1:15:46] I'm not going to pray you do all that
[1:15:49] I'm not going to do nothing I'm just
[1:15:51] going to sit back now in their case they
[1:15:53] they just sat back and had the nice long
[1:15:54] robes on and greet everybody in the
[1:15:57] marketplace and yes they've had their
[1:15:59] meetings and they would be there on the
[1:16:01] Sabbath but they put all the burdens on
[1:16:03] everybody
[1:16:04] else and wouldn't even lift a finger to
[1:16:07] do anything to help
[1:16:09] anybody right but all their Works they
[1:16:12] do to be seen of men they make broad
[1:16:14] their feries and enlarge the borders of
[1:16:17] their garments so they just you know
[1:16:18] outwardly they just tried to look as
[1:16:20] holy as
[1:16:22] possible and they only do things to be
[1:16:24] seen a men okay so where's the secret
[1:16:26] Works they didn't have secret prayer
[1:16:27] they didn't have secret fasting they
[1:16:29] didn't have secret giving everything was
[1:16:31] done out in the open so everybody could
[1:16:33] see it that's why church it's a good
[1:16:35] idea don't tell everybody if you're
[1:16:37] fasting right don't tell everybody if
[1:16:39] you're giving to the poor don't tell
[1:16:41] everybody all those things right try to
[1:16:43] keep some of that secret don't let your
[1:16:45] right hand know what your left hand's
[1:16:46] doing and the church
[1:16:48] said and they love the uppermost rooms
[1:16:51] at Fe at feast and the Chiefs seats in
[1:16:53] the
[1:16:54] synagogues and greetings in the markets
[1:16:56] to be called a men Rabbi Rabbi uh the

[1:17:17] times to him I'm just a brother I'm just
[1:17:19] I'm a just call me brother but these
[1:17:21] people love to be seen at all the big
[1:17:25] events
[1:17:26] right that's why sometimes Church look
[1:17:28] at the big events look at the big
[1:17:30] meetings who are the people being seen
[1:17:33] now the bi Jesus said try to sit lower
[1:17:36] and wait for people to let you come up
[1:17:38] to the front but don't put yourself up
[1:17:40] front right make people look for you at
[1:17:43] the at the big occasion right Hallelujah
[1:17:46] just hide away and don't don't try to be
[1:17:49] noticed we could use some more of that
[1:17:51] in the message right
[1:17:55] Hallelujah be not called a rabbi for one
[1:17:59] is your master even Christ and all ye
[1:18:00] are Brethren and call no man your father

[1:18:34] be a superintendent because I'll forget
[1:18:35] everybody's name for sure is the world I

[1:19:42] verse 13 church he goes through some of
[1:19:43] the harshest words in the entire Bible
[1:19:47] he says you make your converts twofold
[1:19:49] the sons of Hell than you are these are
[1:19:51] some of the harshest words in scripture
[1:19:54] you're making them as double demon
[1:19:56] possessed than you are isn't that what
[1:19:59] we see like a lot of modern young people
[1:20:02] today I mean look at that you know
[1:20:04] they're n it's just it's hard to imagine
[1:20:07] you know the language and the things
[1:20:08] they watch and the things they see it's
[1:20:10] twice as wicked as their
[1:20:11] parents
[1:20:13] right maybe maybe more than that and
[1:20:16] they're fil they're filled with demons
[1:20:17] from such a younger age than their than
[1:20:19] their parents were Hallelujah but this
[1:20:22] is the religious
[1:20:24] realm he calls them Hypocrites yeah
[1:20:28] that's in verse 15 he said you make them
[1:20:30] twofold more the child of Hell than
[1:20:33] yourselves he calls him in verse 19 you
[1:20:35] fools and
[1:20:37] blind and then he gives eight
[1:20:40] woses let's read 23 and then I'm going
[1:20:42] to move on here he says woe unto you
[1:20:44] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[1:20:46] pay tith the m and Anis and c kumin and
[1:20:50] have omitted the wayer matters of the
[1:20:51] law judgment mercy and Faith these ought
[1:20:55] you have done and not left the other
[1:20:57] undone so they overdid it on their
[1:20:59] tithes and offerings right they overdid
[1:21:01] it on that they focused so much on tith
[1:21:03] and offerings money people right money
[1:21:05] hungry
[1:21:06] people now church I don't preach on ties
[1:21:08] and offerings too much if I do too much
[1:21:10] somebody let me know I try not to we got
[1:21:12] we have a wonderful faithful Church
[1:21:14] regarding those things but they spent
[1:21:16] look they spent all this time on
[1:21:18] money money money money they left out
[1:21:21] judgment Mercy and what's the other one
[1:21:23] I always forget one of
[1:21:25] those faith I always forget one see
[1:21:29] Works they were all works right tithes
[1:21:31] offerings works works works works works
[1:21:34] they were trying to seek God's favor
[1:21:35] through works now we we should do those
[1:21:37] things out of the love of God but we got
[1:21:40] to keep our balance in the word of
[1:21:42] God let's not leave out judgment mercy
[1:21:47] and Faith let's judge things the right
[1:21:48] way let's have mercy Hallelujah let's
[1:21:51] have faith in the word of God God
[1:21:54] hallelujah
[1:21:58] amen and Jesus also says they strained
[1:22:00] at a gat and swallowed a
[1:22:03] camel right so they got so focused on
[1:22:05] the little things that they basically
[1:22:07] swallowed up they had a big loss because
[1:22:09] they focus on such small minute details
[1:22:12] they made big huge errors because they
[1:22:15] went too far on things right and we got
[1:22:17] to be careful not to go too far on
[1:22:19] certain teachings right want to try to
[1:22:21] find a balance in the word of
[1:22:23] God all
[1:22:25] right
[1:22:28] now that was Romans 932 Romans 9:33 as
[1:22:32] it is written behold I lay in Zion a
[1:22:34] stumbling stone and rock of off fence
[1:22:37] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:22:40] be ashamed and the church said I believe
[1:22:43] on Jesus I'm not ashamed of what I
[1:22:45] believe Hallelujah there's no shame for
[1:22:47] me there's no condemnation for me
[1:22:49] there's no shame for me Hallelujah
[1:22:52] there's no no separation from the love
[1:22:53] of God for me this is what the word of
[1:22:55] God says
[1:22:56] hallelujah oh it's beautiful thank you
[1:23:00] Jesus now I'm closing with this here I I
[1:23:02] said all that to get down to this I
[1:23:04] meant to preach this on Sunday but
[1:23:06] Sunday I was just you know just uh you
[1:23:09] know overwhelmed with with no musicians
[1:23:11] and I always feel insufficient that's
[1:23:13] why and I am but I was just so you know
[1:23:17] I was just so overwhelmed with that wow
[1:23:18] when was the last time this
[1:23:21] happened and and you know I just felt
[1:23:23] like I wore myself out but by God's
[1:23:25] grace I got some good sleep but it made
[1:23:26] me think you know it made me think of
[1:23:28] wow with no musicians and no music it's
[1:23:30] like the beginning of the
[1:23:32] Gospel the day of
[1:23:34] Pentecost right or the early
[1:23:37] church remember church when Jesus the
[1:23:40] night he was arrested remember what he
[1:23:41] did after communion the Bible said they
[1:23:43] sang some hymns and then they went out
[1:23:45] to
[1:23:47] pray they didn't have any electric
[1:23:49] guitars right they didn't have any
[1:23:51] electric keyboards
[1:23:53] they didn't have any drum sets they
[1:23:54] could sit down Peter's like hey let me
[1:23:56] sit down on the drums and let me play
[1:23:57] Let me let me play a little tune here
[1:23:58] you know they just sang they just did
[1:24:02] Acappella and they sang some of the
[1:24:04] Psalms that David wrote right in
[1:24:06] preparation for the prayer in the Garden
[1:24:08] of Gethsemane a lot of it was AC
[1:24:11] cappella do you think one of the guys
[1:24:13] were doing the beat box in the
[1:24:14] background he's like hey James can you
[1:24:15] handle the beat box
[1:24:19] here no no like let's lift our voice in
[1:24:24] unity to god let's sing a song Just
[1:24:27] Right From The Heart
[1:24:30] Hallelujah that's what it reminded me of
[1:24:33] and then it was so you know fitting too
[1:24:34] I was just preaching right through the
[1:24:36] Bible verse by verse from Romans chapter
[1:24:39] n did you know that's how the early
[1:24:41] churches were Colossians 4:15 says
[1:24:45] salute the Brethren which are in leoda
[1:24:47] and Nas and the church which is in his
[1:24:49] house they were sitting in someone's
[1:24:51] house just read reading the Bible
[1:24:53] reading the letters of Paul and when
[1:24:55] this epistle is read among you cuse that
[1:24:58] it be read also in church of leans and
[1:25:01] that you likewise read the epistle from
[1:25:03] Leo DEA imagine they didn't have a
[1:25:07] Pulpit like this they'd step out kind of
[1:25:08] like at my house remember we had house
[1:25:09] or church church in my house last year
[1:25:11] when the we had the big that that big
[1:25:12] freeze you
[1:25:14] know the brother would just walk up and
[1:25:16] say you know they'd have their prayer
[1:25:17] whatever sing you say okay we're going
[1:25:19] to read the word of go we're going to
[1:25:20] preach our sermon today I'm just going
[1:25:21] to read Paul letter they unroll the
[1:25:24] scroll uh to the Saints in Ephesus in
[1:25:28] Christ Jesus blessed be the God and
[1:25:29] father of our Lord Jesus Christ and that
[1:25:32] was that was a service reading the word
[1:25:34] of God no fog
[1:25:38] machines no lights no turning up the
[1:25:41] volume or turning it down no live
[1:25:43] stream right it was just the Simplicity
[1:25:47] of the
[1:25:48] Gospel the word of God the Saints in one
[1:25:52] place Hallelujah one place and one
[1:25:54] Accord
[1:25:55] Hallelujah that's all that's all that
[1:25:57] was
[1:25:59] required gather together more you see
[1:26:01] that day approaching gather lift up the
[1:26:03] prayers lift up read the word of
[1:26:06] God so preaching through a book of the
[1:26:08] Bible that actually most resembles the
[1:26:11] early church right because that's the
[1:26:13] only word they had remember they didn't
[1:26:15] have the full New Testament they just
[1:26:16] had a few Scrolls that they could glean
[1:26:18] on every
[1:26:19] week of course there was preachers that
[1:26:21] would take that and then preach off of
[1:26:22] that no doubt about that but Church our
[1:26:25] hearts it just reminded me that our
[1:26:27] hearts are being turned back to the
[1:26:28] apostolic
[1:26:30] fathers amen so I was thinking all this
[1:26:32] on Sunday morning no instruments no
[1:26:35] worship I'm sorry no no no uh no
[1:26:37] instruments no electricity that's the
[1:26:39] word I'm looking
[1:26:40] for and I'm preaching verse by verse and
[1:26:43] think about that church that was enough
[1:26:45] to keep them even in the face of death
[1:26:49] penalties being arrested that would keep
[1:26:51] them that' be be enough you remember
[1:26:53] this I told you remember brother Keith
[1:26:55] Randol remember him him and his Pastor
[1:26:57] brother CLM who passed away they went
[1:26:59] and preach in Pakistan one time and the
[1:27:01] Muslim population is so violent there
[1:27:05] that in their services they could only
[1:27:07] whisper when they sang and no
[1:27:08] instruments and when they preached they
[1:27:10] had to whisper because there's Muslims
[1:27:12] on both sides above and under and if
[1:27:15] they find out their worshiping they get
[1:27:16] arrested and taken off to
[1:27:19] jail so imagine if your church service
[1:27:21] was this
[1:27:23] I
[1:27:26] Choose You couldn't even say
[1:27:29] Amen or else you're going to jail and
[1:27:32] they that's why I respect those Brothers
[1:27:33] they have they put their lives on the
[1:27:35] line that's no
[1:27:37] joke that's why no matter what we
[1:27:39] believe you know I might differ I might
[1:27:40] have some different doctrines I respect
[1:27:42] those
[1:27:43] brothers because I don't know how I
[1:27:45] could preach that quiet
[1:27:47] brother right how could I don't know how
[1:27:51] I could do it to be
[1:27:53] something but that's that's a kind of
[1:27:56] that that and that's more like the early
[1:27:59] church imagine all you could do is
[1:28:01] whisper and pray you couldn't scream or
[1:28:03] shout like we love to hear people scream
[1:28:04] and shout and I like I love to dance
[1:28:06] around this church I love the tambourine
[1:28:08] when we break it out too but those
[1:28:10] places you can't even have a tambourine
[1:28:12] and look the enemy could say well see
[1:28:13] you're not a real believer see you're
[1:28:15] not a real believer you're afraid to
[1:28:17] worship well am I who are you going to
[1:28:23] believe the devil or the word of God
[1:28:27] going to be the word of God see because
[1:28:29] we know the scripture sometimes the
[1:28:30] church is under great persecution
[1:28:32] sometimes they had
[1:28:33] rest so you have to see where do I find
[1:28:36] myself in the plan of
[1:28:38] God do they have any less Faith than we
[1:28:41] have I would say they they might have
[1:28:43] some more faith than I
[1:28:46] have because I really have to pray to go
[1:28:48] preach over there they live in it and
[1:28:50] they can't escape it yet they keep their
[1:28:53] faith strong we just reading the word of
[1:28:56] God whispering they don't get to dance
[1:28:59] they don't get to shout they don't get
[1:29:00] the praise of the Lord but but can God
[1:29:03] still move in a situation like that
[1:29:07] absolutely absolutely church we all know
[1:29:10] this is Leia if we're not careful we
[1:29:13] become spoiled and I'm talking about
[1:29:15] myself you know I'm talking about Sunday
[1:29:17] you I I don't have electricity I don't
[1:29:19] have any
[1:29:20] musicians and this was a thought I was
[1:29:23] encouraging myself with 1 Thessalonians
[1:29:25] 5:26 greet all the Brethren with a holy
[1:29:28] kiss no wonder they'd kiss each other on
[1:29:30] the neck brother Austin they could die
[1:29:34] no wonder they're happy to see each
[1:29:36] other they're surrounded by demon
[1:29:39] anointed Violent Men that'll kill them
[1:29:41] no wonder they'd hug on the neck and
[1:29:43] kiss them on the
[1:29:44] neck I charge you by the Lord that this
[1:29:47] epistle be read unto unto all the holy
[1:29:49] Brethren the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:29:51] Christ be be with you amen so think
[1:29:54] about that we have wonderful sermons but
[1:29:56] there was no third pole sermons in those
[1:29:58] days there was no seven seal servant yet
[1:30:01] the book hadn't even been written
[1:30:03] yet yet God could Supply them abundantly
[1:30:07] just by reading the word and the
[1:30:09] inspiration of the Holy Spirit coming
[1:30:12] off the epistle Hallelujah just coming
[1:30:14] off the plain word of God that ought
[1:30:16] encourage us we can just remember Church
[1:30:18] open our Bibles and God can speak to us
[1:30:20] right there
[1:30:22] in the security of our home the warmth
[1:30:24] of our home the privacy of our home God
[1:30:27] can speak to us right there in the midst
[1:30:29] of that God is able to do that in fact
[1:30:32] that's how the early church was
[1:30:34] built God meeting with the individuals
[1:30:37] in these home Gatherings these little
[1:30:40] gather these Upper Room Gatherings
[1:30:42] Hallelujah no instruments no shouting no
[1:30:44] dancing no running no clapping sometimes
[1:30:48] right if there's persecution
[1:30:50] on
[1:30:53] remember brother Bram called This Book
[1:30:54] of Romans he said Paul couldn't go into
[1:30:57] those great deep messages that he did to
[1:30:59] the Ephesians they did to those Romans
[1:31:01] to teach them the Deep things because
[1:31:02] they wasn't able to take it and church
[1:31:05] if you can receive these sermons on
[1:31:06] Romans that proves you can receive the
[1:31:08] Deep things of God that God has loved
[1:31:11] you so much God's opened your eyes to
[1:31:13] receive the deeper things of God
[1:31:16] hallelujah like predestination right we
[1:31:18] saw that in chapter eight there
[1:31:20] Hallelujah oh my about Abraham walking
[1:31:24] we walk as Father Abraham walked these
[1:31:26] great deep things of God hallelujah
[1:31:28] justification how about Romans 7
[1:31:31] deep uh when I sin brother Austin it's
[1:31:33] not me it's sin that dwells within me
[1:31:37] how about that that's pretty deep isn't
[1:31:38] it don't let yourself get beat up don't
[1:31:40] get the don't let the devil accuse you
[1:31:42] well look what you did look what you did
[1:31:43] you can say it wasn't
[1:31:46] me wrong person sorry what do it me
[1:31:51] Hallelujah it wasn't me it was the sin
[1:31:54] that dwell Within Me praise God you can
[1:31:57] you can quote that scripture
[1:32:00] Hallelujah these great deep things of
[1:32:02] God and see then you can move on and you
[1:32:05] can remember I'm an adopted daughter of
[1:32:08] God I'm an adopted son of
[1:32:11] God I've got Authority I've got power
[1:32:15] Hallelujah I've got favor with God God
[1:32:17] favors my prayers amen God hears my
[1:32:20] prayers
[1:32:23] I love this quote this will be my last
[1:32:25] quote here brother R uses this
[1:32:28] one well maybe I'll do two here last two
[1:32:34] quotes brother BR said I was reading the
[1:32:36] other day in broadbent's Pilgrim Church
[1:32:38] I have that book I used it to write uh
[1:32:40] chapter 7 in my uh 2021 book he says in
[1:32:44] the early church they never had any
[1:32:45] ornaments never even had an altar so
[1:32:47] brother was reading in the early church
[1:32:49] they wouldn't even have an altar in the
[1:32:51] church church he said because the pagans
[1:32:54] that got converted they used to fall
[1:32:56] prostrate at the altar right they used
[1:32:59] to set up altars they would sacrifice
[1:33:01] animals at the altars right and so when
[1:33:04] they came to Christ just even think of
[1:33:05] laying down at any altar that was such a
[1:33:08] mind battle they they couldn't even have
[1:33:09] an altar in the church now now me that
[1:33:11] doesn't bother me right it probably
[1:33:13] doesn't bother you whether you kneel at
[1:33:15] your chair or kneel here because as
[1:33:17] Sinners we didn't bow I didn't bow down
[1:33:19] to the TV and be like I'm going to
[1:33:20] worship you TV but I was right you
[1:33:25] didn't bow down at the theater and say I
[1:33:26] worship you theater I wor so this
[1:33:29] doesn't bother us but brother Ram says
[1:33:31] in those days that was Pagan worship you
[1:33:34] had an altar you bowed down to so the
[1:33:36] early church didn't have any altars in
[1:33:38] it that's why it's not a sin to have it
[1:33:40] if it doesn't hurt your conscience
[1:33:41] there's no sin in having an
[1:33:46] altar he said they used to fall and
[1:33:49] prostrate at the
[1:33:50] altar he said they just had a plain
[1:33:52] little old building where they sat on a
[1:33:54] slab of rocks and you got a nice cushion
[1:33:57] seat there now they're getting kind of
[1:33:58] old right we've been here we've been
[1:34:00] here since 2015 these chairs are about
[1:34:02] about eight years old now right eight
[1:34:04] years nine years
[1:34:06] old maybe they're not as soft as they
[1:34:08] used to be but he said they used to sit
[1:34:10] on old slabber rocks they raised up
[1:34:13] their hands after some godly man gave a
[1:34:16] message and they raised up their hands
[1:34:18] and praise God they love the after
[1:34:21] effect of the Holy Spirit bathing
[1:34:23] through them
[1:34:26] Hallelujah a man preach and then they
[1:34:28] would stand up and sing with no
[1:34:30] instruments and they love to feel the
[1:34:32] Holy Spirit bathe them in his
[1:34:34] presence Hallelujah this this encouraged
[1:34:37] me on Sunday Hallelujah I didn't get to
[1:34:40] preach it but encouraged
[1:34:42] me God can visit us in any
[1:34:46] condition right it all depends if all
[1:34:50] depends is my heart in a condition where
[1:34:52] God can visit me am I trusting in my
[1:34:54] righteousness or am I trusting in the
[1:34:56] righteousness of
[1:34:58] Christ that's how the early church was
[1:35:00] set up meeting our homes they didn't
[1:35:03] have Al they did not have
[1:35:05] altars they just had preaching prayer
[1:35:08] and then the afterwards worship he
[1:35:12] says that was that early church in the
[1:35:14] times of irus and Martin so forth right
[1:35:17] after the death of the Lord Jesus when
[1:35:19] the church going on before in
[1:35:21] Catholicism oh that's what we love and
[1:35:24] the church
[1:35:26] said brother Ram closes the service uh
[1:35:29] in Jeffersonville in Humble thyself he
[1:35:31] said let's close our eyes and just sing
[1:35:33] that in the spirit now till we meet till
[1:35:35] we meet till we meet at jesus' feet till
[1:35:37] we meet till we meet God be with you
[1:35:40] till we meet
[1:35:43] again he said we're just children God's
[1:35:45] children let's hum it then they hum the
[1:35:48] song that's what we're going to do
[1:35:49] tonight I'm going to tell mus musicians
[1:35:52] don't come up
[1:35:54] tonight because I want to get back some
[1:35:56] of that reverence that I was uh Desiring
[1:35:58] you know I would like to get back some
[1:35:59] of this reverence of the early church
[1:36:01] and just try to feel just try to feel
[1:36:04] the presence of God without without
[1:36:06] anything with just a humble Heart of
[1:36:09] Worship because that's what the early
[1:36:11] church did
[1:36:14] Hallelujah the early church didn't need
[1:36:16] anything else they didn't need anything
[1:36:17] extra now we we love it we appreciate it
[1:36:20] they didn't have to have this didn't
[1:36:20] have to have any anything like this they
[1:36:23] just would hear the word of God and
[1:36:25] worship and they could feel the after
[1:36:27] effects of the Holy Ghost who wants to
[1:36:30] feel the after effects of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:32] I do I want to feel God I want to come
[1:36:35] to church and I want to know God heard
[1:36:37] our worship here tonight we heard the
[1:36:39] word of God the word of God is changing
[1:36:41] my life amen like the Potter amen and
