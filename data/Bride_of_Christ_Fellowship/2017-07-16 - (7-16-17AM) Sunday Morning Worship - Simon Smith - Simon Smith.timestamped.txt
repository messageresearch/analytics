[39:20] [Applause]
[39:42] my
[39:45] fate yeah the
[39:48] last day of work before it went I made
[39:50] sure I went to my favorite Mexican
[39:52] restaurant eat
[39:54] my chimichanga that was my favorite meal
[39:56] I drank a baby I think it might be my
[39:59] last supper here America I didn't know
[40:01] what's gonna happen I was absolutely
[40:03] terrified flying
[40:05] out all the way there by myself to meet
[40:08] someone I've never met before there and
[40:11] then of course to be there
[40:13] we
[40:15] want my faith hungry the Lord blessed a
[40:17] space dining another trip in two more
[40:19] months we're heading the end of
[40:21] September back for a lot more work
[40:23] tremendously blessed from working my
[40:26] view
[40:30] some of the slides we gots gracing me in
[40:32] here here thank you thank you Jesus
[40:35] let's let's go to Scripture by God's
[40:38] grace we've
[41:11] been drinking Matthew 13
[41:14] thank
[41:22] you Jesus 13
[41:24] verse
[41:28] 18 now this is the interpretation of the
[41:32] parable that Jesus gave other 7 parables
[41:35] so
[41:37] just know this
[41:46] thought King me and why God you 7
[41:48] parables 7
[41:51] you deal with the Gentile as far as
[41:53] completion the Gentile Church ages but
[41:58] notice this is the very first one the
[42:01] very first parable and Jesus Christ is
[42:04] not given in parable form alone but he
[42:06] gives the interpretation so
[42:08] this is the key to being a highly
[42:11] productive fruitful
[42:13] Christian amen verse 18 Matthew 13 verse
[42:17] 18 he here
[42:19] you either
[42:20] they're more the perilous or when
[42:23] any one heareth the word of the kingdom
[42:24] and understandeth it not then cometh the
[42:27] wicked one to Kent and catcheth away
[42:28] that which was sown in his heart this is
[42:31] he which received seed by the way side
[42:34] but he receives a seed into stony places
[42:36] the same is he that heareth the word and
[42:38] anon with joy received it yeah he had
[42:42] not root in himself but who were for a
[42:44] while for what tribulation and
[42:46] persecution arises because of the word
[42:48] by and by he is offended and he also
[42:50] that received seed among the thorns is
[42:52] he that heareth the word and the cares
[42:55] of this world and the deceitfulness of
[42:56] riches and choke the word and become
[42:58] unfruitful he become unfruitful but he
[43:01] either receive a seed in the good ground
[43:03] as he hears the word and understandeth
[43:06] it which also beareth fruit bringeth
[43:10] forth some
[43:11] a hundredfold some sixty praise
[43:25] Lord just my lips for God ignored this
[43:27] is your work what
[43:41] we
[43:43] just love you so much
[43:50] CC God Jesus Christ put this parable
[43:53] first and it shows what how to be hey
[43:59] that doesn't matter about anything else
[44:02] then what bringing forth fruit in your
[44:04] life still
[44:17] alive that all gonna be doing was sowing
[44:19] seed what we do this so see their
[44:24] spiritual farmers each one of us has we
[44:26] go into the world all we do is submit
[44:29] amen look what Jesus John 6 John
[44:37] 6 verse 63 and he's just got done
[44:39] screeching drink of my blood am I very
[44:43] very hard servant he never explained his
[44:47] parables this whole thing Harold he
[44:49] never explained any of it but look what
[44:51] he says here in John 6:63
[44:53] he says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[44:56] so we need this spirit to quicken things
[44:59] right yeah we go that takes the
[45:02] spiritual clicking the body for rapture
[45:04] he says the flesh profiteth nothing the
[45:06] words that I speak unto you they are
[45:08] spirit and they are life see so notice
[45:12] what the words are spirit and those
[45:14] words are the spirit that quickeneth and
[45:17] he speaking these things to the
[45:19] Pharisees and Sadducees early on the
[45:21] chapter but because there was nothing to
[45:23] quicken with in them he
[45:28] spoke the truer of God yes the Spirit of
[45:32] God speaking the words which was speared
[45:34] and it had the power every word he spoke
[45:36] at powered acquitted that's right and
[45:40] he was speaking these things but because
[45:42] he was speaking to the wrong seed there
[45:44] was actually nothing for these words the
[45:46] words carry the spirit that spirit to
[45:48] quicken absolutely nothing sorry but it
[45:50] put the disciples were the exact same
[45:52] word the
[45:54] same word that carried that spirit of
[45:57] Bob with it and it was able to hold that
[45:59] hey I don't think I understand this how
[46:02] they said with a heart sank and Peter
[46:04] said where else can we go for holes the
[46:06] words of eternal life so anyhow
[46:09] as we continue all here we have good
[46:11] time
[46:14] and now what is what is I'm trying to
[46:18] find my position I'll say like this in
[46:19] the body John
[46:22] [Applause]
[46:26] grams administered others
[46:28] you know finding your place I'm trying
[46:30] to find my position as well maybe this
[46:32] is a path I'm trying to go down amen so
[46:35] I wanted to go through this is this is
[46:36] what we're called to do things as we get
[46:39] ourselves clean or keep our hearts clean
[46:41] in that see that words the plan of their
[46:43] hearts continues to grow and prosper and
[46:46] bring forth fruit where
[46:49] to go what what did Jesus say he says in
[46:50] Matthew 28:18 Jesus came has picked them
[46:53] all power is given to me in heaven and
[46:54] earth no he therefore and teach all
[46:56] nations baptizing them in the name of
[46:57] the Father Son Holy Ghost so we know
[46:59] that is what the Lord Jesus Christ to me
[47:01] a mad where Jesus Christ may
[47:05] be reading you something here
[47:08] now
[47:10] if he says also teaching
[47:13] them to observe all things whatsoever
[47:14] commanded you and lo I'm with you always
[47:15] even unto the end of the world Amen
[47:17] that's right you bet but he says he said
[47:19] we must go he therefore and teach all
[47:20] nations teach and then baptized yeah
[47:24] then in mark 16:15 he says he said I'm
[47:27] going throughout the world and preach
[47:29] the gospel to every creature and if he
[47:31] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[47:34] saved a mad absolute so that's what we
[47:37] did I had nothing else to do I don't
[47:39] know what else to do I'm going only by
[47:41] faith twenty some hour flight from the
[47:44] Lord said he's already been there and
[47:45] then or that area you want to do by I
[47:47] guess he was by airport it's lovely this
[47:49] very nice yes
[47:52] very big but also as we go here to
[47:54] second Corinthians 15 5:18 says and all
[47:58] things are of God who has reconciled us
[48:00] to himself by Jesus Christ see so once
[48:04] we been reconciled to Jesus Christ he
[48:07] says that he has given to us the
[48:09] Ministry of reconciliation now the
[48:12] movement back joint backs for Jesus
[48:14] Christ he says now we have a ministry as
[48:16] well yes what does your ministry is to
[48:19] get others reconciled back to crime yeah
[48:22] thanks God to wit that God was in Christ
[48:25] he says reconciling the world unto
[48:27] himself not imputing their trespasses
[48:30] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[48:32] word of reconciliation
[48:33] what are you used for the reconciliation
[48:35] the Word of God the same seed that same
[48:39] a Bible text that same quote or however
[48:42] you want to bring it we use that and
[48:44] bring people to reconcile them back to
[48:46] Jesus Christ because what they're lost
[48:47] just like we were for some of us
[48:50] pregnant fornicators alcoholics and
[48:53] abusers and all these things he says now
[48:55] that we are ambassadors for Christ as
[48:58] though
[49:01] God did beseech you by us we pray you in
[49:04] Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God a
[49:07] head so
[49:10] I was we jumped on the plane by God's
[49:12] grace we started Detroit flew to Boston
[49:14] sat there for a couple hours and we
[49:15] headed out to Dubai and I arrived late
[49:20] one night and he I had no idea what I
[49:24] was going into I have no idea what I'm
[49:27] even doing I just ain't God I have no
[49:29] idea what
[49:32] I was doing okay I just flew out there I
[49:34] find myself amongst
[49:37] a group of believers here this
[49:41] is sister diamond wonderful tie sister
[49:43] there she was actually the lives in the
[49:46] house that we're living she's
[49:47] Pentecostal to the core sister
[49:52] Helen old school Pentecostal I mean old
[49:55] school and brother James
[50:00] he's Pentecostal as well now here I find
[50:03] myself your sister Esther hold
[50:12] of messages and now she's interpret over
[50:15] 10 or 11 by herself and push them out by
[50:19] the help of a church in Canada and she
[50:22] actually just started printing two more
[50:23] out and Thailand this month buy your own
[50:26] money she's
[50:28] interpreting the word for Thailand's
[50:30] God's just working too slow and then of
[50:33] course there's me my face okay so
[50:37] I find myself here its own that it's a
[50:39] pretty nice house decent decent areas a
[50:41] gated community thank God I'm sure the
[50:43] Lord had mercy on me knowing I was just
[50:46] the Nuvi rookie so there's brother James
[50:49] like we said good brother he's from
[50:51] Taiwan had
[50:54] the pasta and then there's sister Helen
[50:57] she's very Pentecostal
[50:59] so
[51:01] the Lord set me up to fly right into
[51:03] what I use it was used to back when I
[51:06] was in denominating right right and all
[51:08] these women these Pentecostal women that
[51:12] I know or that I got to meet here they
[51:14] all want to meet one of the ministers or
[51:17] our ministers and they like controlling
[51:19] everything that spirit of domination is
[51:23] on on these things absolutely and then
[51:27] when we had a couple rough issues will
[51:28] tell you about them and of course sister
[51:32] diamond as soon as I got there they
[51:34] wanted me to pray for her
[51:35] she's actually going through a
[51:36] separation with her husband her son's
[51:38] looking there and since I left healing
[51:40] she's had to move out of the house and
[51:41] go somewhere else by God's grace so
[51:45] keep them in the prayer of another all
[51:49] these names obviously dying sister
[51:50] diamond sister Esther
[51:54] sister Helen these are all just their
[51:56] English names okay that's that's their
[51:58] real names I couldn't pronounce their
[51:59] names so they just pick names and that's
[52:01] what we call them and
[52:04] then of course I want brother Ron downs
[52:05] here by the grace of God he's the
[52:07] brother that three years ago he was
[52:09] praying and he said her voice said have
[52:13] you considered my bride in Thailand and
[52:16] he's from Philippines he doesn't know
[52:18] tightly in language he doesn't know
[52:20] anything about time they had to be like
[52:22] what so he married a woman a sister
[52:25] chromatid from Philippines they live in
[52:26] Canada you marry one and they went for a
[52:28] two-week vacation they stayed a week in
[52:31] the Philippines and then for some reason
[52:33] he just said let's go to Thailand they
[52:36] went for Thailand for one week and
[52:38] somehow he made one connection with
[52:40] somebody and then he's been there twice
[52:42] before the third time and you invited me
[52:45] and about four months ago I just pulled
[52:49] my pastor I said man I'd love to go
[52:52] full-time ministry whatever and do
[52:54] something more for goddess that'd be a
[52:56] lolicon and the very next day the
[53:00] very next day for the rod text me says
[53:01] you want to come Tizen opens right
[53:06] [Music]
[53:07] so I said I told him I said brother I'll
[53:10] pray and Lord show with me Thailand in
[53:12] two weeks I'll go the first week he
[53:15] showed me tiling in twice but I got had
[53:17] that third one and then it was another
[53:18] whole other week and then on that Friday
[53:20] he showed me tiling twice then
[53:24] did the met that night he texts me said
[53:26] did you get the fourth third one I said
[53:28] brother I got four I'm going with here
[53:31] we are we're in the market here right
[53:33] the first party here now this is the
[53:35] native food is called Duran absolutely
[53:38] fruit it's not the best
[53:43] well my tissue so
[53:49] anyhow here's a little message team here
[53:51] brother Ron Albanian sister that's Kurt
[53:53] he's a lawyer we brother odd and we'll
[53:56] be able to speak every service one time
[53:58] and she had to do it twice the
[54:00] interpreter so by God's grace and of
[54:03] course anyone that knows me you
[54:06] know the Lord is not going to send me to
[54:07] Thailand without living with the dog oh
[54:10] that's the house dog right there the
[54:12] representation and
[54:19] the Lord sent me there and every night I
[54:21] get home from preaching you're teaching
[54:22] me whatever what we did and they have a
[54:24] son
[54:26] would let them out and I play with at
[54:30] home amen
[54:32] now here's some of the things we counter
[54:35] here this is a form of bathroom waste
[54:40] thing you actually stand on these and
[54:43] then you squat down and do business and
[54:45] then you take that and you scoop and put
[54:47] water in there I didn't
[54:50] think God I walked in I didn't know what
[54:52] I was looking at and I walked out it
[54:54] even know what it was I think and it
[54:55] explained to me by God's grace no going
[55:00] into our first meeting the sister Esther
[55:03] she was in the school of prophets
[55:06] Pentecostal
[55:08] prophets back in her earlier years so
[55:11] she had connections to almost every
[55:14] island minister there wasn't she has
[55:17] connections everywhere and we were able
[55:20] to preach and message searches no I'm
[55:23] sorry I know there's only one message
[55:24] urgently and I'm going to it and their
[55:26] way out way out but we went to all these
[55:29] were Pentecostal churches and these
[55:32] ministers let us speak just awful curve
[55:36] of knowing her and her testimony not
[55:39] even knowing what we were reading so we
[55:41] had to be very wise on what we probably
[55:43] it be very smooth the wise and the
[55:45] servant but channel is a tough yes
[55:48] sir so brother rise up here now teaching
[55:50] for the first time I can't remember this
[55:52] pastor thing
[55:53] we brought a couple things and
[55:56] then we took a little break we went and
[55:59] ate lunch and then they hadn't even come
[56:00] back into psychics interest so there I
[56:03] am teaching site of service in this loop
[56:05] this little house here there's mostly
[56:08] pretty much almost no a/c and also your
[56:11] you don't wear any shoes and anything
[56:13] buildings but the roads the streets are
[56:15] so filthy take your shoes off before you
[56:18] enter anything that's
[56:20] just common courtesy however and now
[56:22] this time I wanted to bring something
[56:24] with a little bit of deeper meat a
[56:27] little bit more something else and I
[56:30] wanted to catch their attention you know
[56:31] well I don't I don't want these people
[56:33] to think that we're just coming here
[56:35] throwing sprays some kind of weird
[56:36] doctor I want to bring it so looks
[56:39] professional like we made in the Word of
[56:41] God you know we're talking about and I
[56:43] was able to bring about a year ago for
[56:46] the Jesse or two years ago Jesse came
[56:49] upon a sermon and he brought a big chart
[56:51] and he had showed the four types of
[56:53] believers before off forward all the way
[56:55] through show this is this all the way
[56:58] through and I was able to draw that
[56:59] little chart out and he was and there
[57:00] was a couple ministers a couple of
[57:02] sisters they were all taking pictures in
[57:04] that charter so
[57:06] I was able to get a hold of their mind
[57:07] you know I really draw lamb in so but at
[57:11] the end and we were able to hit Malachi
[57:13] 4 because we don't want to just hit a
[57:16] little something we want to actually be
[57:17] able to like see who's going to receive
[57:20] I
[57:23] did about transfiguration Bible study
[57:25] showed them to that and at the end one
[57:30] of the his ministers underneath him went
[57:31] up and disagreed and drew a chalk drew
[57:33] on the whiteboard and showed his his
[57:35] scriptures showing that John the Baptist
[57:36] fulfilled Malachi 4:5 well I asked for a
[57:39] remodel can I have your bottle and they
[57:41] said absolutely so I went there and I
[57:42] did part of the mouth Transfiguration
[57:44] again showing that John the Baptist said
[57:46] he says he said the Pharisees asked him
[57:49] he says are you that Elijah and John the
[57:51] Baptist said no I am NOT that property
[57:54] men yeah but even though they were
[57:57] disagreement everything
[58:00] ended well and then just good spirited
[58:02] everything's fine so
[58:05] a good time that's the pastor right
[58:07] there by God's grace and of course over
[58:10] there if you're not a pastor you're
[58:12] pretty much a nobody so they had to
[58:13] introduce me in cast aside and
[58:19] just do Bible say all they did it pretty
[58:21] much Saints the first prime three or
[58:23] four services I just did Bible studies
[58:25] but what what's the difference between a
[58:27] Bible study and a preaching it's the
[58:30] same word it's the same seed and it
[58:33] carries what the Saints you're am sorry
[58:35] but it all depends on what round is
[58:37] going on yes cause we're doing is
[58:40] rolling out see I'm adding simple
[58:43] absolutely
[58:44] yeah we are and this is the brother that
[58:47] had a issue with us they're in the back
[58:50] wonderful brother sweetheart
[58:51] disagreement
[58:54] now this is our second meeting here went
[58:57] into one another of Pentecostal area
[58:59] this is the second floor of their
[59:01] building sister diamond was leading
[59:03] songs and worship for us and one thing
[59:06] about the Pentecostal sings they worship
[59:08] and the name brick whenever
[59:13] we're not teaching or preaching mister
[59:15] we were going to the Pentecostal prayer
[59:18] readings and the Pentecostal worship
[59:21] services and then we offer ours they
[59:25] know they don't have the word like we
[59:26] have things and where were the words
[59:28] were that was put on the word all they
[59:31] have pretty much to tell us you they
[59:33] have seen any worship and they pray
[59:36] every time we were left we had to say a
[59:38] prayer every time we came in and we say
[59:40] a prayer whenever there was a little
[59:41] tiny something went wrong or somebody
[59:44] this was that we said a prayer and
[59:47] that's where I think the message is very
[59:48] very liking I'm liking myself is that
[59:51] everything must be done in prayer hey
[59:53] they meant so they were leading here now
[59:55] worship and
[59:58] then brother Ryan goes up and teaches
[1:00:00] first on sister Esther's interpreting by
[1:00:03] God's grace and then
[1:00:06] I went up and talked now remember I
[1:00:08] didn't I didn't know all these pictures
[1:00:09] I don't even know where being taken they
[1:00:12] were sent to me after I got home I was
[1:00:13] like look I can actually I went through
[1:00:17] we started teaching
[1:00:19] continually teaching by the Word of God
[1:00:21] and
[1:00:23] at
[1:00:24] the end they wanted prayer you prayed
[1:00:27] over everyone pretty much everyone
[1:00:29] favors create over one wheel to pray
[1:00:30] over but something happened which I
[1:00:33] didn't understand a sister had come up
[1:00:35] to me to dispute something about the
[1:00:36] Godhead and I was able to bring her to
[1:00:39] three or four or five scriptures I said
[1:00:41] you let me see what you had so I don't
[1:00:43] have anything like that I said well you
[1:00:45] believe the Word of God are your gonna
[1:00:46] believe your own ideas and she says well
[1:00:48] do the Word of God so but then
[1:00:50] afterwards now we're sitting there
[1:00:52] English speaking afterwards she went up
[1:00:54] and grabbed the microphone I remember
[1:00:57] we're in the Pentecostal ranks she
[1:00:59] grabbed the microphone and started
[1:01:00] speaking in Thai and it's pretty much
[1:01:03] what from what we found out from
[1:01:04] suppressor that she went up and said
[1:01:06] these brothers are teaching false
[1:01:08] doctrine don't believe but anything they
[1:01:09] said they're false and done it is out of
[1:01:12] the DA and then she had had another one
[1:01:13] sister take a picture of her while she's
[1:01:15] up front she posted on Facebook it made
[1:01:17] it look like she was actually organizing
[1:01:19] the whole meeting and that she was the
[1:01:21] one greeting them service so there's a
[1:01:23] lot of things
[1:01:25] that went on a lot of issues those
[1:01:29] things God we spread the seed a mentor
[1:01:33] of God a bet
[1:01:35] but everything what ended well there's
[1:01:37] no hard feelings whatever so now by the
[1:01:42] grace of God we continued on there was
[1:01:44] one or two very interested in what we
[1:01:47] had to say and when we go back we'll be
[1:01:49] able to make contact with them by God's
[1:01:50] grace again and then as we went down
[1:01:52] back to the first floor there's a
[1:01:55] husband and wife right here that we're
[1:01:57] walking by and sister Esther started
[1:01:59] moving to see to that and we real to
[1:02:02] testify
[1:02:03] while Jesus Christ them and here's two
[1:02:06] of the books each one of these books has
[1:02:09] three message sermons in it the sister
[1:02:11] Esther interpreted and for the ron's
[1:02:14] church up in Canada paid five thousand
[1:02:16] dollars to have like two or three
[1:02:17] thousand copies made and that's what Ron
[1:02:20] brought from Canada and we're able to
[1:02:21] pass out to everyone everyone that's
[1:02:24] said in these meetings that we went
[1:02:25] through that's one or two of those
[1:02:27] so they're worth our excuse so
[1:02:31] wherever the witness this husband in
[1:02:32] this fight and even so
[1:02:39] then directly after this service just
[1:02:41] the diamond wanted me to go pray for her
[1:02:44] mother so he went in drove a long way
[1:02:47] sir I came here for long well don't this
[1:02:50] and everything so the Hanley's are so
[1:02:52] tight the cars and there's mopeds
[1:02:55] and bicycles everywhere weaving and
[1:02:58] bobbing you justice it's pretty insane
[1:03:00] to drive in there it's almost like
[1:03:01] there's no laws so
[1:03:04] we be able afraid over this sister here
[1:03:06] by God's grace maybe
[1:03:09] no specifically taken then a day or two
[1:03:12] later or however was we went to our
[1:03:14] meeting and this was a house meet and a
[1:03:18] lot of these women like to be ministers
[1:03:20] or want to be ministers or want to hear
[1:03:23] more about the Word of God they're
[1:03:25] always trying to find something so we're
[1:03:26] able to witness to a lot of sisters here
[1:03:28] by God's grace and then we really hit
[1:03:31] baptism and
[1:03:33] if you see this is right here her her
[1:03:36] and I believe her we're so intrigued by
[1:03:40] the what we were teaching that you'll
[1:03:42] see in about three or four more services
[1:03:45] maybe two or three more services you'll
[1:03:47] see that they actually drove this is
[1:03:49] like below Bangkok and then about an
[1:03:53] hour below Bangkok we drove in another
[1:03:55] service about two hours north and they
[1:03:58] drove from there all the way there to
[1:03:59] here is a second time a bed so and this
[1:04:03] is John really interested in baptism and
[1:04:05] that her office her mom or cantilever
[1:04:08] Robert discours true but she came to
[1:04:12] another service we're
[1:04:15] able to teach there I had a lot of
[1:04:17] questions everybody out of course one
[1:04:19] prayer events we pray or each one and
[1:04:22] they went sister with really really
[1:04:24] short here and come up to me and she
[1:04:26] healed right below me where I was
[1:04:27] sitting if I see him she's like brother
[1:04:29] Simon when I go in the cause and pray I
[1:04:32] get no peace I know my answers I got in
[1:04:35] prayer and I looked at her and I said I
[1:04:37] you have to be honest you know this is
[1:04:39] my only I'll ever beat at this location
[1:04:42] probably this sister right here I just I
[1:04:44] said since you got Laker air girl I I
[1:04:47] said I said you hit you have to have
[1:04:49] that glory shining down and I gave him
[1:04:52] the scripture in first Corinthians 11 or
[1:04:53] however and it's just like oh okay I'll
[1:04:55] read it so you just have to hit you get
[1:04:58] one shot I mean I realize you know of
[1:04:59] course in life the same thing but here
[1:05:01] it seems like it's over I was more over
[1:05:04] emphasized in my heart right I was
[1:05:07] serious it was all business when you got
[1:05:09] their vote on whether on teaching didn't
[1:05:12] have any problems in this one but they
[1:05:15] were thoroughly blessed by what we're
[1:05:16] bringing by God's grace I'm
[1:05:19] very well to share the Word of God now
[1:05:21] obviously when we're doing
[1:05:22] interpretation I will speak and then I
[1:05:25] have to wait for sister Esther to bring
[1:05:26] the interpretation so if you have to be
[1:05:28] the most efficient with your words and
[1:05:31] and and that little pause in between
[1:05:34] really helps you out because you're
[1:05:35] thinking okay what is the very most
[1:05:38] important thing I have to study right
[1:05:40] here sorry the thing okay so I say it
[1:05:42] and then she's like what's this so
[1:05:46] it was really a lot more simpler for me
[1:05:48] have
[1:05:50] a slower guy I
[1:05:53] pray God was able to use it not believe
[1:05:55] he did so yes you'll see the results
[1:05:57] later on by the grace of God so
[1:05:59] then one of our days off we we went to
[1:06:04] their prayer and worship service here
[1:06:05] and saints of God the power guy came
[1:06:07] down hit me while we were singing they
[1:06:09] have this song I never heard it before I
[1:06:10] mean I was singing it and they had an
[1:06:12] English like it scene and it was just
[1:06:14] now
[1:06:24] sister Dimond are they to find out her
[1:06:28] parents are very very wealthy they owned
[1:06:30] a huge plot of land way out in the rice
[1:06:35] paddy fields area which is pretty much
[1:06:37] everywhere but you go out about two and
[1:06:39] a half maybe maybe I want to half drive
[1:06:41] and we got lost for about an hour
[1:06:43] because she hasn't been up there for so
[1:06:45] long and
[1:06:47] this is one of her family's houses and
[1:06:50] these
[1:06:52] are Buddhists here
[1:06:54] and they actually work her fields so
[1:06:59] but she felt led to bring us to her
[1:07:00] workers and we got to a whip they never
[1:07:03] even heard about Jesus Christ before and
[1:07:05] also sister diamonds family are straight
[1:07:07] Buddhists we went to the her temple in
[1:07:10] fact she's like the first one to come
[1:07:12] out as a Christian they have I'm
[1:07:14] something they have to have probably a 2
[1:07:16] or 3 million dollar I mean American
[1:07:18] money Buddhist temple they drove us
[1:07:21] right through the whole complex and this
[1:07:22] temple is is out in the middle of
[1:07:24] nowhere and it is huge and then she
[1:07:27] actually has her Prada land and she's
[1:07:29] part of her land she's gonna set up a
[1:07:31] church right I stood moot his temple so
[1:07:34] there could be a pray for her she may
[1:07:35] have some Wars but the Buddhists are
[1:07:37] very docile they're not like Muslims
[1:07:40] kill you they'll just okay listen to you
[1:07:43] be done so sister Esther wanted me to
[1:07:47] give my testimony this
[1:07:49] family that's the wife the husband and
[1:07:51] son and I was able to where did I bring
[1:07:54] that I bring doctrine no I brought about
[1:07:57] how my grandpa prayed over my grandma
[1:07:59] and raised from the dead my mom had
[1:08:02] cancer and God raised her up and healed
[1:08:05] her the things that God has done in my
[1:08:08] life and that's what I shared them
[1:08:10] because it's the gospel not a word but
[1:08:13] an action but indeed they bet absolutely
[1:08:16] so we're able to do that and
[1:08:19] as is right before I gave my testimony I
[1:08:22] had set my phone down because I just
[1:08:24] taking pictures of the house I set it
[1:08:25] down and it started recording and my
[1:08:28] entire testimony that I'm giving them I
[1:08:30] actually recorded on accident even my
[1:08:32] wife he was her witness or whatever
[1:08:33] later on so there we all were sitting
[1:08:36] there with no shoes on just be Reverend
[1:08:39] testimony
[1:08:41] and the husband did not receive it the
[1:08:44] child the son did not receive it but the
[1:08:48] wife wanted prayers she's like I've
[1:08:49] never heard this before I'd like to you
[1:08:51] guys that pray over me and she had a
[1:08:53] little in her leg and and I was going to
[1:08:55] lay my hands on her one of the
[1:08:57] Pentecostal sisters runs up in the front
[1:09:00] of me and she starts praying and shaking
[1:09:04] her old-school Pentecostal style and
[1:09:08] does your little thing and then she's
[1:09:11] okay pastor Simon now you've been
[1:09:13] praised so she wanted to get hers in
[1:09:15] first see so you see the dominating
[1:09:17] female spirit right and that's what
[1:09:19] we're dealing with it the entire time
[1:09:21] just a little here a little there had
[1:09:24] some issues but so we prayed over the
[1:09:27] sister and we're able to give her the
[1:09:29] books translated books by God's grace to
[1:09:32] her and she
[1:09:35] seemed very happy so we're
[1:09:38] driving through town and
[1:09:41] we hit a restroom break so we all have
[1:09:44] pull it she pulled over and they just
[1:09:45] when they do you terms think a lot of
[1:09:47] traffic they do whatever they just do
[1:09:48] your job no matter what there's like six
[1:09:50] lane highway and one car will just do a
[1:09:53] u-turn and everything stops and they let
[1:09:54] him go there's no road rage no nothing
[1:09:56] it's interesting we
[1:09:59] stopped and we all went to this little
[1:10:00] Mandy's these are all like shops teacher
[1:10:02] like garages for their shops we went to
[1:10:05] the back of the bathroom and sister
[1:10:07] Esther is a witnessing machine she went
[1:10:09] and actually started witnessing this
[1:10:10] Buddhist man the owner of the shop and
[1:10:13] he asked prayer for his business because
[1:10:15] it's slow so we're able to pray for him
[1:10:17] we're able to witness about Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] gave him the message books and just we
[1:10:22] just sowed seed you know there's
[1:10:23] something greater we have Jesus Christ
[1:10:26] from masters you can be reconciled in
[1:10:28] Jesus Christ right now we're able to
[1:10:30] tell them that sister
[1:10:32] Diana missus restroom to Tran reporters
[1:10:35] and then we had two sister Esther wants
[1:10:39] us to meet as many pastors and ministers
[1:10:42] as we could over there so we had another
[1:10:44] meeting with two ministers right here's
[1:10:47] a pastor and there's no pastor to
[1:10:50] get with them and just
[1:10:53] fellowship make friends because you
[1:10:54] never know if you get invitation or not
[1:10:56] so we will do that by God's grace we
[1:11:00] made friends but we don't so
[1:11:05] then after that I believe we went to
[1:11:07] another prayer meeting and
[1:11:10] of course it's woman let the women are
[1:11:13] very in charge over there and seek you
[1:11:15] many men ministers the bigger names are
[1:11:18] men but the women just easily have
[1:11:21] we went to another meeting and the woman
[1:11:26] was leading and I said right next to
[1:11:27] this lady she's are here over here she
[1:11:29] said pastor Simon what do you want to
[1:11:30] pray for because we all went around in a
[1:11:32] request and then we just about an hour
[1:11:34] 45 minute prayer me just pray just pray
[1:11:37] these people are sincere they
[1:11:39] they want God they want more although
[1:11:41] they just don't know who he really is
[1:11:42] and they don't have the truth so but
[1:11:46] when I she said she asked you what if
[1:11:47] she we pray for and I said sister we
[1:11:50] need to pray for revelation more than
[1:11:53] anything else well
[1:11:58] directly across me from it was a young
[1:12:00] sister and she was looking at me and
[1:12:03] then we prayed in reports on their
[1:12:04] prayers and directly after the head lady
[1:12:07] left this sister right there in the pain
[1:12:09] she comes right up to me says pastor
[1:12:12] Simon what is discrimination you're
[1:12:14] talking about but she speaks very good
[1:12:16] English and I said sister what and as I
[1:12:19] started breaking down baptism I start
[1:12:21] breaking down a couple of mysteries and
[1:12:23] she was so bubbly and getting me just
[1:12:26] like oh she said wow this is amazing
[1:12:28] this is tremendous wow I wish I could
[1:12:31] have some more so we continue to teach
[1:12:33] her food of course half an hour show her
[1:12:36] things and she's like how can we meet
[1:12:38] again I think we said absolutely so
[1:12:39] about a day later maybe day and a half
[1:12:41] later we're able to meet up with you
[1:12:44] again at McDonald's and we did another
[1:12:46] miniature Bible study with your and she
[1:12:47] was just like I've never heard this
[1:12:50] before but of all those people that
[1:12:52] rumor is practical people that look
[1:12:54] prayer room all those people that was
[1:12:56] the one that seed hit right there and we
[1:12:58] just by the word revelation so
[1:13:10] brother ride was able to have a third
[1:13:12] follow-up and what brother on the side
[1:13:15] he was English air hair dress Godhead
[1:13:19] serpents
[1:13:20] and
[1:13:25] now she's gonna wear skirts and dresses
[1:13:27] and all those things sister - is there
[1:13:30] done and as soon as we get back I
[1:13:31] guarantee I'm gonna that's my number
[1:13:33] right they're going after that girl
[1:13:35] right there she's Winston to her
[1:13:37] boyfriend now and trying to beat him to
[1:13:40] get rebaptised and that was our first a
[1:13:43] little strike a gold little gold nugget
[1:13:45] bomber digging through people so so
[1:13:49] now set their diamond she was the one
[1:13:53] that drove us everywhere but as she's
[1:13:56] hearing our doctrine going forward she
[1:13:57] kind of shied away from us and she
[1:14:01] didn't want to drive us anymore but the
[1:14:03] Lord Jesus Christ has a she's always got
[1:14:05] a way for us so sister Esther had
[1:14:09] another buddy named sister job and this
[1:14:13] is the precious lady right here she
[1:14:17] is so she's so responsible she's such a
[1:14:20] good witness to God God and those things
[1:14:23] that the Benny Hinn ministry actually
[1:14:27] gave her one of their vehicles so
[1:14:31] me and brother Ron and suggester Babel
[1:14:33] drive around many his vehicles the rest
[1:14:36] of the means amen
[1:14:43] so she actually works for one of the
[1:14:45] outreaches on the he
[1:14:51] provided the vehicle so her name is
[1:14:53] sister Chuck and she's a very very sweet
[1:14:56] lady and as now she has a student our
[1:14:58] services that she's driving driving us
[1:15:00] around and she uh she's hearing these
[1:15:03] things and and we went for a long drive
[1:15:06] and as to the next meeting that what I'm
[1:15:08] going to show you a place at least and
[1:15:10] and she kept asking sister Esther asked
[1:15:13] for assignment about the hair why you
[1:15:15] guys do here and she's seeing a
[1:15:17] difference between sister essence and
[1:15:19] sister Helen the Dominator they bed and
[1:15:22] she says my father are women about the
[1:15:24] preach and this his dress would shoot a
[1:15:26] question back to me the back seat and I
[1:15:28] turned my Bible and I give it up towards
[1:15:30] this rest area and then she said well
[1:15:32] why what this is dress and I think I've
[1:15:33] I wanna turn that scripture and she
[1:15:36] actually believes what we teach now hey
[1:15:38] I don't know if she's fully understands
[1:15:40] it but she says I believe you guys were
[1:15:42] right hey we're able to be a lighter her
[1:15:47] as well as and saints of God actually
[1:15:50] will quit this this is Pastor TJ's we
[1:15:52] drove two hours on the middle of nowhere
[1:15:54] to go sister Esther had arranged the
[1:15:57] meeting here between us and this passion
[1:16:00] I don't have a picture of him he's a
[1:16:01] little guy like me very energetic I mean
[1:16:03] he's just like Palestinian just speak
[1:16:06] tremendous English but as soon as we
[1:16:08] walked into his church I could tell his
[1:16:11] wife didn't like us right off and he
[1:16:13] wouldn't let us preach so he drove all
[1:16:15] that way perhaps our no reason so
[1:16:19] we did the prayer meeting we did the
[1:16:22] worship service with them and everything
[1:16:24] and that was it so we had to find a
[1:16:26] place to stay and he drove us out of the
[1:16:29] middle of the jungles and this is the
[1:16:31] jungle area there's wild elephants out
[1:16:33] here there's all kinds of stuff we lived
[1:16:36] we stayed out and well can't see but
[1:16:38] there's little little buildings down
[1:16:40] this way and it's almost like a jungle
[1:16:42] or waste this is one of the most
[1:16:43] beautiful places I've ever seen in my
[1:16:45] entire life if you want to see a better
[1:16:48] picture I probably add one of my other
[1:16:49] so
[1:16:51] anyhow she was not arrested was not
[1:16:53] satisfied with us not getting to preach
[1:16:55] so she arranged a fellowship that night
[1:16:57] there at night after school resort place
[1:17:00] with pastor TJ and so
[1:17:03] we're getting there and he's very
[1:17:04] suspicious of us which pastor ought to
[1:17:06] write I respect that respect important
[1:17:09] that even my sister Astros brother Simon
[1:17:11] give him your testimony so I even my
[1:17:15] testimony and this and this and one of
[1:17:17] my last things the lord digitally last
[1:17:19] year was he raised up that man that fell
[1:17:20] from that the scaffolding he's his
[1:17:23] fracture fractured saw blood on his
[1:17:25] brain and God raised him up that day and
[1:17:29] then the next day as well and here
[1:17:31] brother TJ the same thing had happened
[1:17:33] to him he had slipped on ceramic because
[1:17:35] all the floors over there all tile
[1:17:37] ceramic to keep clean and easy to keep
[1:17:39] clean he slipped slipped fell hit his
[1:17:42] head and fractured her skull and blood
[1:17:43] on his brain and God raised him up and
[1:17:46] when I need my testimony that I had the
[1:17:49] same wonders and works as he did he said
[1:17:51] man if I'd have known that on a heading
[1:17:52] preach a lady but
[1:17:55] now we have a imitation amen when we get
[1:17:59] back to now we are allowed to go back
[1:18:00] and preach in the church so we've got so
[1:18:03] sister Esther was labeled by the leading
[1:18:05] and lower court that helped a bad God is
[1:18:08] faithful here I want to put a little
[1:18:10] attention on this next year thinks
[1:18:14] of God these are we went at nighttime
[1:18:16] two minutes here this is in the ghettos
[1:18:18] of the slum area of Thailand of Bangkok
[1:18:22] okay well this year's pastor Rashad
[1:18:25] sorry I'm sweet but this is throwing you
[1:18:28] near right there this is his something
[1:18:32] that's his son-in-law there's
[1:18:34] two brothers there that married his
[1:18:36] daughters okay I've got a costal we're
[1:18:41] able to teach there are on top first I

[1:19:08] able to beat this brother right here
[1:19:09] brother Edward John he
[1:19:13] is a messy believer from
[1:19:16] Pakistan his master that was under very
[1:19:20] coffee he had to exceed the Muslims so
[1:19:24] ruthless only they threatened to kill
[1:19:27] him where was that so his pastor fled
[1:19:29] and brother Edward John took over the
[1:19:31] ministry he was printing out message
[1:19:33] books this and this and the Muslims one
[1:19:36] day come to his house and said we're

[1:19:39] wife and daughter if you don't quit stop
[1:19:41] these bring these messages he fled to
[1:19:45] Thailand and now he's a he is a illegal
[1:19:49] I mean you're any illegal you cannot
[1:19:52] work you
[1:19:54] cannot eat and if you get picked up by
[1:19:57] the police without a valid visa you'll
[1:20:00] get thrown the IBC attempted in the
[1:20:02] detention centre international attention
[1:20:04] on the river and now you're a prisoner
[1:20:06] these
[1:20:08] brothers now we got to meet him and and
[1:20:12] he was praying for two years or for six
[1:20:15] months or a year or two months to do
[1:20:16] whatever was Wow they got it was send a
[1:20:18] Canadian because Canadians can sponsor
[1:20:21] people from overseas and bring them to
[1:20:24] Manetti watching legal in the US and
[1:20:26] here brother Ron is a convenient and
[1:20:28] they're just the church now just started
[1:20:30] getting him working on suits called
[1:20:32] sponsorship they're trying now to pull
[1:20:34] him out of there get him creaking that
[1:20:36] talk Kyle and either language so he
[1:20:40] keeps praying but I think I believe real
[1:20:42] cherish your support yet but
[1:20:46] they live in the south it's very
[1:20:48] probably because they they cannot be
[1:20:50] exposed to the police no
[1:20:55] brother
[1:20:58] Rashad and there's two son walls Feroz
[1:21:00] and be near their
[1:21:05] wonderful brothers this
[1:21:12] is going to be news wife and daughter
[1:21:17] these are in detention center in prison
[1:21:20] for being Christians right
[1:21:23] now so those are in there that's whether
[1:21:26] rashan's
[1:21:29] daughter they're
[1:21:31] in prison brother feroz's wife and son
[1:21:35] child are in prison as well and
[1:21:39] here's four more of their church family
[1:21:42] that are going through them so that
[1:21:45] church family there were eight people in
[1:21:47] prison for being Christians because
[1:21:51] they're from Pakistan they got thrown in
[1:21:52] there so keep them in prayer they
[1:21:57] they are in here texting me almost every
[1:21:59] day so brothers please I'm praying to
[1:22:01] get God can't release my my wife and my
[1:22:03] child there's two or three there's
[1:22:08] two or three there are children in there
[1:22:10] now it says here
[1:22:19] as the system s truth report thousands
[1:22:22] of Pakistani Christians are forced to
[1:22:24] flee Pakistan due to religious
[1:22:25] persecution death threats often for
[1:22:28] refusing to convert to Islam or
[1:22:30] accusation of blasphemy and offense
[1:22:32] which carried the death penalty and can
[1:22:34] mean and can mean the victim is lynched
[1:22:37] by a Muslim law group ma long before
[1:22:40] goes to court so maybe this is the real
[1:22:43] real issue he says so they flee to time
[1:22:47] in because it's easy cutting tourist
[1:22:50] visas visas to travel there on arrival
[1:22:53] they sued Liu soon learn there are no
[1:22:55] help for them as they are viewed as
[1:22:57] simply illegal immigrant refugee is not
[1:23:00] a term that Thailand recognizes Pakistan
[1:23:04] Christians are prevented from working to
[1:23:06] support their families as a result they
[1:23:08] were going hungry due to the language
[1:23:09] barrier and lack of - they're being
[1:23:11] turned away when they see metal medical
[1:23:13] attention and treatment for the children
[1:23:15] their suffering this is it is not a
[1:23:17] living just a mere resistance beat down
[1:23:22] by unbearable stress but is still
[1:23:23] preferable to lives of persecution in
[1:23:27] Pakistan so
[1:23:29] there is actually no hope good things if
[1:23:32] they're sent to the IEDC the detention
[1:23:35] center or cough or whatever it's $1,600
[1:23:39] a us to freedom and it's only a two-year
[1:23:42] release and
[1:23:46] he
[1:23:52] says and
[1:23:53] because the Pakistan government is so
[1:23:56] weary of the huge number of refugees
[1:23:58] raids are carried out at dawn very late
[1:24:01] in the night doors
[1:24:03] kicked in leaving Christians terrified
[1:24:05] to venture outside for any reason
[1:24:06] fearful
[1:24:08] of further raids they asked their
[1:24:09] friends to padlock them into their small
[1:24:11] cramped living spaces from the outside
[1:24:14] to give the appearance of places on ID
[1:24:16] type a very dangerous choice for these
[1:24:19] slum like buildings where the high risk
[1:24:20] for the fire is high risk for fires
[1:24:23] higher but they feel they feel content
[1:24:25] compelled to make that decision so it's
[1:24:29] very very right
[1:24:32] now they're over 2 for you Pakistani
[1:24:34] Christians including women and children
[1:24:36] in the IDC in Thailand their daily
[1:24:39] ration through his small bottle rice and
[1:24:41] cucumber soup boiled cucumber in water
[1:24:44] there
[1:24:46] is not even a quarter what that is not
[1:24:47] even a quarter with the small children
[1:24:48] need in order to survive some
[1:24:53] everyday things
[1:24:57] of God if you pray tonight when you pray
[1:25:00] tonight remember
[1:25:02] it too then there are bonds as all the
[1:25:05] wisdoms and then we suffer adversity of
[1:25:08] being yourselves also in the body why
[1:25:12] because it's going to come here you
[1:25:13] better
[1:25:17] be sowing seed pray for them because
[1:25:20] dumb brothers right there prank boss to
[1:25:26] have jobs they
[1:25:28] pray they make videos on YouTube post
[1:25:31] them and try to get the message they do
[1:25:33] everything they can trying to please God
[1:25:35] pieces
[1:25:40] for whether one member suffer all the
[1:25:43] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:25:46] honoured all members rejoice with the
[1:25:48] things of God we are so blessed I got
[1:25:59] a first taste I told my Ron maybe first
[1:26:01] thing first thing when we get back I
[1:26:04] want to go to the prison where we can
[1:26:06] meet their family and there's a fence
[1:26:09] and your a lot of creaks through the
[1:26:11] fence so we took a church offering up
[1:26:14] from our church and be able to send them
[1:26:16] some money and they sent back pictures
[1:26:18] of all the food they thought they were
[1:26:19] going to bring to the jail because a lot
[1:26:21] to bring food to the jail for them but
[1:26:23] they have to be careful how you
[1:26:24] distribute because other prisoners will
[1:26:26] go crazy they'll even take the food or
[1:26:30] milk from the children when we're
[1:26:33] dealing with with Satan's Kingdom now
[1:26:38] the only the best way I see they get
[1:26:39] released from prayer I'm sorry from the
[1:26:43] Peter therefore was kept in prison but
[1:26:45] freer was made without ceasing of the
[1:26:48] church bunch of God and
[1:26:51] we know that's how the first prison
[1:26:53] break took place was it was a bet he
[1:27:00] said when they were concerned the thing
[1:27:01] he came to the house of Mary John who's
[1:27:03] seen her surname was mark where many
[1:27:05] were gathered together there praying
[1:27:08] still even after he was released know
[1:27:11] what
[1:27:13] that was a too depressing but it's
[1:27:15] something they wanted to share it was a
[1:27:17] very important my heart changed my
[1:27:20] entire outlook of things
[1:27:22] and
[1:27:28] then one of our last services we drove
[1:27:29] about two hours I wanted to bangle in
[1:27:33] smaller
[1:27:35] Tigers way out there and we met this
[1:27:37] little patch through the pond a year
[1:27:40] before this she had a God gave him was
[1:27:42] billion while he's awake and segovia
[1:27:44] pastors Allen Bentley your obedience at
[1:27:48] the minute he went to started his pastor
[1:27:49] and the pastor out here he's a very
[1:27:51] small church very very good brother very
[1:27:54] humble we
[1:27:56] arrived late because I think he got lost
[1:27:57] a little bit and we found out there was
[1:28:00] his birthday I said Nepal I said what if
[1:28:04] you don't reverted you get something
[1:28:05] nice to eat or something this that he's
[1:28:07] a brother he desires nothing he says but
[1:28:09] you so
[1:28:17] Saturday night brother rod went up and
[1:28:19] just hard and talking the bestie good
[1:28:21] and he said brothers come back increase
[1:28:23] tomorrow morning Sunday service so
[1:28:27] notice how they got that gold curtain I
[1:28:30] mean our old church and our church means
[1:28:32] have a burger teacher didn't miss coat
[1:28:34] oh yeah they got a curtain when
[1:28:39] did Sunday second service the
[1:28:43] bond was joined everything we're saying
[1:28:45] a lot of questions being asked so after
[1:28:50] Ron's first service each of lunch and
[1:28:52] there's a roast I'm going to do we want
[1:28:54] you through the next sir so
[1:28:57] it's like right after kubu boom right
[1:28:58] together so I taught on a certain
[1:29:01] subject afterwards
[1:29:03] and they said brother Simon's now
[1:29:05] explained everything we wanted to
[1:29:07] baptism we wanted to all these things so
[1:29:10] I had to go in and explain the
[1:29:12] difference between proximately goes
[1:29:13] baptism or Jesus Christ and the parish
[1:29:15] agrees 45
[1:29:19] minutes to get the
[1:29:22] people with we're even even all day this
[1:29:24] does this hot it I mean we got eight
[1:29:27] people they wanted everyone wanted
[1:29:29] prayer of course create
[1:29:31] over everyone listening
[1:29:34] to God there was eight people willing to
[1:29:36] baptize in
[1:29:39] the name of Jesus Christ that were
[1:29:41] previously baptized pop song viewers
[1:29:43] that's all the difference these
[1:29:49] all won in the prayer baptizing now this
[1:29:51] lady right here this is my new
[1:29:53] grandmother Jesus he's like 80 some
[1:29:55] years old had 11 or 12 children well
[1:29:58] that lady right there in the green is
[1:30:01] the mother of this lady and then that
[1:30:05] lady is
[1:30:07] the mother of this so we had three
[1:30:10] generations of women and they all got
[1:30:14] baptized husband
[1:30:21] it is like when you get baptized name of
[1:30:23] Jesus Christ is the only man to have bad
[1:30:25] times Lord
[1:30:27] so we finally struck a main vein of the
[1:30:31] seat of God all
[1:30:35] we did we did was so see that
[1:30:54] meeting way back before she showed up
[1:30:57] her mom and then this other sister and
[1:30:59] she and up getting baptized immediately
[1:31:01] as a vet Wow he's Lord so everybody's
[1:31:04] excited happy they saw the new
[1:31:07] revelation after the
[1:31:16] and then we had to find a place for
[1:31:18] baptism well there was another resort a
[1:31:21] third world country resort okay which it
[1:31:23] looks pretty nice and uh so we're
[1:31:26] praying and sister sister
[1:31:29] JA our driver was calling him talking
[1:31:32] lady and she said nope you guys but I do
[1:31:34] have a pond you
[1:31:37] know whatever could be up there and
[1:31:39] brilliant upon says the drivers come
[1:31:42] here quick we started praying and
[1:31:43] brother and sister Jaya's kept talking
[1:31:47] and I'm praying and by the end of the
[1:31:48] prayer five minutes the ladies is okay
[1:31:50] you can baptize it
[1:31:56] they said 50 bucks I said I'll pay for
[1:31:58] everybody they said no you're not they
[1:32:00] each wanted to pay for each one
[1:32:02] themselves saints
[1:32:06] of God that's not a beggar mentality so
[1:32:16] we got to do the bachelor side brother
[1:32:17] get baptized he come up rejoicing by the
[1:32:20] grace of God everybody
[1:32:23] was excited they seemed like they
[1:32:25] understand and now they know they had
[1:32:27] the promise of the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:28] Ghost hey and they were very pleased all
[1:32:37] and the one man that was baptized we're
[1:32:40] walking out there also we're soaked
[1:32:42] we're all walking out and the
[1:32:46] man who was baptized sees another man
[1:32:48] sitting at the table and a table nearby
[1:32:50] and they know each other they actually
[1:32:52] didn't work with them hooked other and
[1:32:53] from what I could hear if you the
[1:32:55] interpretation is the this brother right
[1:32:57] here well
[1:33:00] this okay but other than externally but
[1:33:03] he's told the brother the baptizing was
[1:33:05] I didn't know you were a Christian
[1:33:07] these are Buddhists this
[1:33:11] man this man Buddhist and their two
[1:33:14] wives of Buddhist as well
[1:33:18] and we got to lead them to repentance in
[1:33:22] the name of Jesus Christ we let him
[1:33:26] through the sinner's prayer we've
[1:33:28] told him about baptism I mean
[1:33:33] the husband wife all hold their hands
[1:33:34] together and pray that
[1:33:38] [Applause]
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:40] went really well everybody's
[1:33:58] praying believing God and we stumbled
[1:34:01] their real reverent so
[1:34:23] we're going to lead them the
[1:34:27] Buddhist to repentance
[1:34:30] they want to accept Jesus Christ as our
[1:34:31] Savior I kept
[1:34:35] telling us he goes I don't want to go to
[1:34:36] hell because I don't want to go to hell
[1:34:38] visas and I don't want my wife to go to
[1:34:39] hell I don't my mother years ago though
[1:34:40] so he was actually pretty much all put
[1:34:44] them all on the spot
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:26] Center
[1:35:29] about that was jumping back to River now
[1:35:38] these pictures I didn't even know any
[1:35:40] these are taken so last night receive
[1:35:42] these a meditation
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:50] there
[1:36:56] you go you're good you're able to
[1:36:58] witness them Buddhist then
[1:37:07] their wives and they had children
[1:37:09] swimming in the pool as well because
[1:37:10] they're just they're entertaining of
[1:37:12] children who's able to get in there he
[1:37:15] was one of the cut-up kind of guys like
[1:37:17] me but I got an else over with them we
[1:37:19] got right in his face is that this can't
[1:37:21] be a joke and he's he's so look just
[1:37:22] like right now I'll look right and
[1:37:25] what kind of military on so you went
[1:37:28] down the name Jesus Christ his wife went
[1:37:30] down buried
[1:37:33] they know Jesus Christ as well bed the
[1:37:37] other buddies other body tattooed up he
[1:37:39] went down and they were Jews Christ
[1:37:41] absolutely
[1:37:43] wonderful and
[1:37:45] then his wife went down as well and as
[1:37:48] we got done with these four Buddhist
[1:37:49] converts to other ladies where they're
[1:37:52] watching by the pool and they
[1:37:57] said wow we're Christians too but we've
[1:38:00] never been baptized so they want to get
[1:38:03] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:38:04] explained it to them as well so since I
[1:38:07] got in one day we had 14 baptisms hey
[1:38:10] Matt are you just out with thing and the
[1:38:13] Lord really bless we will to lead them
[1:38:16] off by the grace of going into this
[1:38:18] explain it to him they
[1:38:20] were all baptized and
[1:38:26] I just put this in here because all
[1:38:27] Philip did was that you just baptize
[1:38:29] them that was it that's right a bad
[1:38:32] didn't teach him anything else more to
[1:38:33] do this this he just went gonna baptize
[1:38:35] babies Christ because what not was
[1:38:37] promised now the rest of the workers on
[1:38:38] Jesus Christ amen yes now what's the
[1:38:42] strange thing to happen now is that that
[1:38:44] old grandma lady and her daughter and
[1:38:47] then her daughter it
[1:38:51] turns out that
[1:38:53] she's a doctor that's
[1:38:56] her daughter oh that's rude or she's a
[1:38:59] doctor that's her husband right next
[1:39:01] door and that's their granddaughter
[1:39:02] there they're a doctor she's a doctor I
[1:39:06] don't know he does but they live in a
[1:39:08] mansion they were so impressed by our
[1:39:10] teachings and blessed by the baptisms
[1:39:13] and they seen the movie hand of God move
[1:39:14] they invited us to come to their house
[1:39:16] and they
[1:39:19] there their house their living room is
[1:39:21] bigger than this building and it's about
[1:39:22] 12 12 15 feet up so
[1:39:26] we were able to witness them the husband
[1:39:28] was not able to come to meetings but he
[1:39:29] said he wanted to be baptized just to
[1:39:32] give you an idea that's their living
[1:39:35] room but
[1:39:39] they invite us over as when agreement
[1:39:41] they write us over because they want us
[1:39:43] to pray they're so wealthy they've built
[1:39:46] their own prayer building and
[1:39:49] their house is a mansion and you go down
[1:39:51] the steps on the side of our house there
[1:39:53] you go or Oh sidewalk then you go up the
[1:39:55] steps and there's their prayer building
[1:39:57] and
[1:39:59] their prayer green building is
[1:40:01] absolutely huge as well it's probably
[1:40:05] the building is quite half the size of
[1:40:07] this building with huge vaulted ceilings
[1:40:09] and everything I have a video of it
[1:40:12] actually that's the video of it goes
[1:40:13] down nominal so I won't pray so
[1:40:19] that was pretty much that was
[1:40:26] what we did by the grace of God the very
[1:40:28] last day they took us out and literally
[1:40:30] assumed your children pick up little
[1:40:32] things we
[1:40:35] left to faithful warriors behind sister
[1:40:38] Esther sister job fighting it out in the
[1:40:40] devil's Kingdom now
[1:40:45] Thailand is 99% Buddhist and there's
[1:40:49] less than 1% Christian so the fields are
[1:40:53] white for
[1:40:54] harvest right absolutely
[1:40:57] right and right
[1:41:01] now by playing those things that I'm
[1:41:02] gonna go as much as I can we're
[1:41:09] gonna just press on like that
[1:41:13] there's
[1:41:14] another brother that's no message that
[1:41:16] comes in swinging by the one that one
[1:41:17] sister Esther and
[1:41:20] he was able already to do a follow-up
[1:41:22] study with all all of our probably 10 or
[1:41:25] 12 people that believe this word so far
[1:41:27] sister Esther took pictures and they're
[1:41:29] all they're already feeding off the
[1:41:31] message again the
[1:41:33] Bible says what some some plant others
[1:41:37] water but they're just absolutely
[1:41:42] so it feels good to actually get out and
[1:41:45] do something weird actually trying to do
[1:41:47] something for the Lord and just put
[1:41:48] yourself in harm's way and in the way
[1:41:50] yes there's Chris right there I have
[1:41:54] explained in the pulse water but God
[1:41:56] gave you three so he did so then neither
[1:41:58] is he that planteth anything neither he
[1:42:01] the water but God that giveth the
[1:42:03] increase need
[1:42:06] the planet leave the water so
[1:42:10] thanks God I hope you keep this this
[1:42:13] ministry Italian in prayer please always
[1:42:17] keep them in the people in prison and
[1:42:19] prayer it's I'm sure it's rough for them
[1:42:22] we're leaving their polling right now to
[1:42:25] send $1,600 per version of their family
[1:42:28] which is eat eat time is hard but
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:39] it's just me well they just mean I don't
[1:42:41] know what to do actually it's it really
[1:42:44] seemed like a hopeless situation of
[1:42:45] things outside things Jesus Christ all
[1:42:48] things change
[1:42:53] the government's policies anyhow
[1:43:01] this power has posed a blessing Saint
[1:43:03] said your
[1:43:07] honey father Lord Jesus we used up in
[1:43:08] order to think it over for this day God
[1:43:11] we hope here of the presented Lord just
[1:43:12] the way you allowed us to articulate
[1:43:14] would've ignored be a part you
[1:43:18] know there's so much going on or just we
[1:43:20] pray for those Pakistanis the ones that
[1:43:23] are the prison right now

[1:44:41] last before Dean back and
[1:44:44] I am I know it seems a God of feeling
[1:44:47] pushing your heart attack all to do
[1:44:49] anything the ministry just go because of
[1:44:51] God absolutely
[1:44:55] the fivefold ministry is just sowing the
[1:44:57] seed but Saints God each one of us has a
[1:44:59] ministry individually I only as souls
[1:45:02] that we want and witnessed to me them
[1:45:04] push harder than ever had right
[1:45:20] there's
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:27] [Applause]
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:39] nothing more important in winning souls
[1:45:40] there's
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:53] something for us to do well there's a
[1:45:55] price to do what
[1:45:58] we can do right now is pray we can pray
[1:46:01] for the future trip opposed to make here
[1:46:04] we
[1:46:05] can pray for the families that have
[1:46:07] relatives
[1:46:09] in prison obvious things like I said we
[1:46:12] can't relate to that we can't relate to
[1:46:13] having a wife and a child in prison the
[1:46:17] kid was
[1:46:19] can't wait we can pray they can enter no
[1:46:22] burden seekers 13 said that we can
[1:46:25] adjourn and
[1:46:26] try to feel for them and then from here
[1:46:29] we can do something about the grace of
[1:46:30] trying to help them out perhaps the
[1:46:33] thing to offering or something like that
[1:46:34] it definitely want to help support
[1:46:36] mother Simon I don't want to help
[1:46:37] support the other side to
[1:46:42] make an impact you know I think it's so
[1:46:46] often in America we just get focused on
[1:46:47] ourselves
[1:46:48] when
[1:46:51] we have a presentation like this for
[1:46:53] able to see that we should be interested
[1:46:56] in other people should get our eyes off
[1:46:57] ourselves and say our problem very very
[1:47:00] small we have very small problems
[1:47:02] compared to these people overseas so I
[1:47:07] like if you would let's
[1:47:10] just see that song little as much from
[1:47:12] Gaza

[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:51:16] far as those
[1:51:20] I think we pray to learn that this time
[1:51:23] that God would change the government do
[1:51:26] something because God is greater man
[1:51:28] he's the one in control there's a
[1:51:31] purpose for this trial than know why God
[1:51:33] allows these things to be in person
[1:51:34] language there's a purpose behind we can
[1:51:37] stand within the prayer we
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] are also blessed to
[1:51:47] live here but we're more blessed to know
[1:51:49] Jesus Christ and
[1:51:52] we're so blessed Lord to be able to hear
[1:51:54] these words today Lord no
[1:51:57] doubt today was a divine meeting for God
[1:51:59] to hear how your hand is moving there
