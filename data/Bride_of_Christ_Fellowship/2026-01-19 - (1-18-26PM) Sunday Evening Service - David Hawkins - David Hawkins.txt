We have a we can we can meet in peace in his name and and not and not have to suffer the persecution you know other other countries still go through it you know and and and uh saints and other other places abroad especially India right now and and different places and just being being persecuted can't even meet publicly you know and here we have we have we could meet every day of the week if we wanted to and and and people uh you know have a hard time coming once a week and many People don't have any desire to come at all. But thank the Lord we have a place where the Lord has set his name. Amen. Under under the revealed word. Not only do we have the freedom to go to church, but to we still have the freedom to preach the revealed word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we might not have that liberty forever across the pulpit. Amen. But but thank the Lord. While we have it, let's take advantage of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's uh before we read this here from Isaiah, let's bow our heads and ask the Lord to help us tonight. [snorts] Lord Jesus, thank you so much for your mercies, Lord, and your grace. And uh we we sure need it, Lord. Every day, every hour, Lord, we need thee. As the song says, I need thee. Oh, I need thee, Lord. Lord, no matter where we go, Lord, when we're in the house, we need you, Lord. When we when we go to Walmart, we need you, Lord. There's so much evil around that no matter where you go, you just run into evil here and evil there and just wickedness, Lord. And we thank you for bringing us out of wickedness, Father, out of sin. And Lord, we pray that you continue to be gracious to us. And may your presence be about us, guard our hearts, Lord, always. And and may we be fully clothed with the armor of light upon us, Father. And taking the sword of the spirit, the word, and the shield of faith that we can quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Amen. We thank you, Lord. And we ask now that you'd encourage [snorts] us, build us up in your scripture, Lord, in your word, and teach us. May everything fall exactly into place, Lord, how your spirit intends. May you have full work and full uh authority here this evening, Father, or this afternoon. Uh just desiring that your name to be glorified, Father, [snorts] and uh that we would leave here better and closer to the Lord and and uh with more fervor to serve you than ever before, Lord God. We just pray you'd renew us in our spirit, Lord. And uh and give us grace. Help us to be gracious, Lord. For freely we've received mercy. Help us to freely give it also, Lord. &gt;&gt; We ask this, Lord, for your mercy. Uh we thank you for your mercy. We ask this for your glory and uh pray you'd bless your people for they belong to you. Father, we all are the work of your hands. You're called out your chosen people. Lord, we thank you for that and uh we just desire to serve you better. We ask you to help us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Amen. [snorts] We'll be reading from uh Isaiah 55 and starting at verse nine here. &gt;&gt; Amen. We sure appreciate the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh verse nine, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returnneeth not thither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it bring forth fruit, or bringeth bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sewer, and bread to the eater. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I send it. Amen. May the Lord bless his word. You can be seated. [snorts] Amen. We I I always enjoy reading this scripture because it it gives us courage and faith in the word of the Lord that everything the Lord has spoken. Amen. and uh purposed. It's for a reason. It's to accomplish something. Amen. Just the the same way that he [snorts] he created the rain and the dew um and and the the precipitation, you know, to water the earth, you know, the Lord put in place uh systems and and uh seasons and times and everything in the earth. Um but he also established heavenly seasons and spiritual you know times and [snorts] um events that would unfold in their seasons and and he sent his word always to to accomplish something. Amen. Always he revealed his word to somebody on the earth um as a witness and it was always to prepare for something or or to to share something with God's people. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So he says so shall my word be. Just like the like he sends the rain upon the earth uh in its season to bring forth the seeds that have been laying there. Uh so he sends forth his word. Amen. To to to us to bring forth uh his fruit in his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So praise the Lord. Um he he always has a a set time in his mind uh for his word to be fulfilled, revealed. And that's our our our title again is the time for revelation. The Lord always has a time um that that it's always in the right time. Amen. to reveal his word, to send his word to his people &gt;&gt; upon the earth. Praise the Lord. Amen. Um, but he always speaks in order for something to be accomplished. Amen. And, uh, I want to read Luke chapter 18 here and, uh, starting at the 31st verse, it says, "Then he took unto him the 12." Jesus did took unto him the 12 and said unto them, "Behold, uh, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished." And he he's telling them very specifically um what they are preparing to do and what is about to happen [snorts] that all things that were written by the prophets that remember they spake and and wrote by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost as they were moved by the Holy Ghost [snorts] for he verse 32 he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles. He shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on and he and they shall scourge him and put him to death. He he he used very plain language here. Amen. And the third day he shall rise again. &gt;&gt; So he told them in detail the things that were to be. Amen. The things that were coming. But look what we find in the 34th verse here. They understood none of these things. And this saying was hid from them. Neither knew they the things which were spoken. Amen. So even though Jesus was plainly telling them, I'm going to be crucified. I'm going to be killed. I'm going to be delivered up to the Gentiles. And according to the scriptures, they're going to put the Son of Man to death. &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe they, you know, of course, it was hid from them. So maybe they just thought that he was speaking in parables or or something or um they just couldn't grasp um what exactly he was saying that he was going to die. But he also tells them that he on the third day he's going to rise again. He also tells them I'm I'm going to raise again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and they had heard him say before destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again. Amen. and but they just they didn't understand it because it wasn't yet time for them to receive it. Amen. But it was for a purpose. Uh [snorts] it may be that if they would have all understood it was going to happen, maybe they would have tried to uh do something on their own to to change it to to prevent him from dying or something and the Lord couldn't allow that because it had to happen. We you know, we don't know. But it was hid from them. That's what we do know. They they just couldn't. They understood none of these things. the scripture says. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And then uh let's go to Luke chapter 24 here [clears throat] and we'll start in the first verse. Praise the Lord. This is the the resurrection here. [snorts] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sephiler, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sephiler. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed, Amen. thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. So they came being the first day of the week, this was the the third day since he had been crucified. [snorts] Uh they came and didn't find him and were perplexed. But remember, if the if it wasn't hid from them what Jesus had said, then they would have known when they went there. We shouldn't find him in there because he said he would raise again the third day. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it surprised them. It perplexed them. They didn't understand. It was still hid from them. Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And then uh verse five. Uh so then there was angels that appeared to them, two two men in shining garments. And as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?" Amen. &gt;&gt; He is not here, but is risen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, "The son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again." And they remembered his words. Amen. So the the angels had to come and bring to remembrance the things that Jesus has said. Amen. His words. &gt;&gt; Amen. How he told them he's I'm going to be put to death according to the scripture and and on the third day I'll raise again according to the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So uh and and they returned verse 9 from the sephiler and told all these things unto the 11 and to all the rest. It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed to to them as idol tales and they believed them not. &gt;&gt; Amen. is that's amazing that they knowing what Jesus had already said and and seeing the fulfillment of it, they still couldn't believe that that it had happened because we know it was hid from them. Amen. Their their their eyes were holding. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if it wouldn't have been, then then they would have seen right away. Ah yes, that that that must be because that's exactly what he said would happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But it but it was hid from them. Amen. And it's hard for us to understand, but until the Lord allows something to be revealed, then it'll be revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then arose Peter and ran to the sephiler and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. Amen. So he was still he was still wondering about all this. He didn't understand any of these things. And [snorts] behold, two of them uh went that same day to a village called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs. [clears throat] And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass that while they communed together in reason, Jesus himself drew near and went with him. Amen. There's uh this is one of my favorite stories, I think, in the New Testament. And and there's so much to glean just from the from the road to Emmas here. And there there's so much. We'll try to try to just stay on track here, but you could probably get a a hundred different sermons out of just this passage, brother. You know, and um there's a lot there. But praise the Lord. Um and it came to pass. Yes. Uh Jesus himself drew near and went with them. Amen. I love that. Jesus himself, he he came to where they were communing about him. &gt;&gt; But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. So to them, it was a stranger. They didn't they didn't recognize him because their eyes were actually holding. [snorts] And he said unto them, "What manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad?" [snorts] And the one of them whose name was Cleopus uh answering said unto him, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem? Hast thou not known the things which are come to pass in these days?" Amen. If anybody knew, this stranger knew. Amen. He said, "But you don't know what's happened." And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet, mighty indeed and word before God and all the people." See, they they still there's still something in their heart, still believed on him, even though they didn't understand it, right? &gt;&gt; But something in there, they still knew he was a prophet. And this was still their testimony about Jesus. Amen. That they didn't understand. Um but they knew he was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people [snorts] and how the chief priests and el and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him. [snorts] But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Amen. They they kn they knew it was the third day, but they they had forgotten what Jesus said would happen on the third day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus told them plainly what would happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But yay uh and and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sephiler. And when they found not his body uh they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive. Amen. And certain of them which were with us went to the sephiler and found it even as the women had said. But him they saw not. Praise the Lord. Is it's again it's hard for us to understand that like why are they so surprised? Why are they astonished? Why do they doubt? Why do they wonder, &gt;&gt; you know, but but you got to remember it was hid from them. There was you could put it this way, there was a veil over their eyes until the time uh that Jesus wanted to be revealed. &gt;&gt; Um but then he said unto them, verse 25, "Oh fools." Amen. I I didn't realize this until just in the office this morning. We heard God call somebody a fool. remember because because he laid up his treasures on earth and not in heaven. And [snorts] um I didn't even realize that until just a little bit ago. And but Jesus calls them fools because he says and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. &gt;&gt; So remember, not only did Jesus uh blatantly expound what was going to happen, but also all the law and the prophets foretold of it as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; In types and shadows. [snorts] Um but but it was all speaking of him. [snorts] Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory? [snorts] And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them all the scriptures, the things concerning himself. Amen. That's that's my desire when we come to church. Amen. That that he'll expound to us all the scriptures concerning himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what we want, Lord. Amen. Grant it. And and when and they drew nigh unto the village uh thither they went and he made as though he would have gone further. Amen. But they constrained him, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent." And he went in to tarry with them. [clears throat] And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them, he took bread and blessed it, and broke it and gave it to them. Amen. And their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight. Amen. Don't you you just want Jesus to terry with you and and stay with you until you understand. Amen. Just just be patient with us, Lord, until our eyes are opened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us. He He understands. He knoweth our frame. Amen. He He remembers that we are but dust. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just just t with us, Lord, and open our eyes. Amen. And they said one to another, "Didn't not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way? And when he opened us the scriptures?" Amen. I I love that. And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered there gathered together and them that were with them, saying, "The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon." And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and say saith unto them, peace be unto you. Amen. But they were terrified and afrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit. They they just they thought they were seeing things. I mean after hearing uh the women had come back telling them that the seelicore was empty and then angels told him he was risen and then the two disciples um had just told them he is risen indeed. Amen. and appeared to Simon and Cleopus and then um not only so what the Lord Jesus himself had told them it would happen. Amen. But but now they were terrified and afrighted and and didn't believe what they were seeing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, just open our eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only believe. Lord, help our unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he said unto them. Verse 38, why are you troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Amen. Why do we get so troubled, brothers and sisters, seeing the the things that are happening in the world. Amen. Seeing the the manifestation of prophecies and uh from the things that have been told from the beginning that we we we ought to be expecting. But when we see things in the in the news and and politics and [snorts] and and government and world events and they they scare people, you know, even even message believers, it it scares them sometimes. It sometimes it almost baffles me how they how worked up people get. believers get get worked up over things that are happening like like we didn't know it was going to come. Amen. But but he said, "Why are you troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?" Amen. Thoughts come up and and and they they make people anxious and troubled and and they they begin to worry and fear. [snorts] Amen. Uh with with things happening all over the world and people don't know what's happening. They don't know what to believe. They don't know what's going to happen next. You know, people are lying to them in the media and and all over and they they just thoughts arise in their hearts. Amen. Even believers. Amen. But they but they need to they need to get reggrounded. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the word and and and and realize in whom they have believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But but remember um the things we see happening and and and um a lot of people are stumbling because of how they see people falling away from the message. But remember the scripture says that they shall not come except there be a falling away first. Amen. So Jesus also tells us through the scripture, you know, through his servants that these things are to be. Amen. They will happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And don't let it surprise us. Amen. Let let not your heart be troubled. Amen. Don't let don't let thoughts arise in your heart, &gt;&gt; you know, doubtful thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But in this day, amen, the the the revelation of Jesus Christ is unveiled. Amen. This is the the the time for revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the day when the son of man is revealed. Praise the Lord. We saw it through through the message he gave to brother Brandham. Amen. For us, the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. Through the through the church ages and through the seals. Amen. The the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. That is the that is the revealing of the son of man. Amen. Praise God. So uh and and again a lot of people I I talk to and and um people we all know I'm sure and and probably have struggled with ourselves seeing people fall away um that have they were in the message you know 10 years 20 years 30 years 50 years even and and more &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden they just drop away and it really hurts a lot of people. It's it's it's hard to see, you know, and I'm I'm sure all of us know people dear to us and or know of people that that um we never would have thought would have fallen away from the message. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Um and and and they do. Amen. And and it's a hard thing, but remember, it was told that it would happen that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; The day cannot come except the there be a falling away first. Amen. And that man of sin be revealed. Amen. Which we know to be the the Antichrist, but that's a whole another message. And I I'll leave that one to brother Jesse. Praise the Lord. He's he's good at getting into all the deep things. Amen. Praise the Lord. But don't let your heart be troubled. Amen. All the the thoughts that when you when you see on the news something happening, you think what's going to h you know what's going to happen? Thoughts arise in your heart. Don't let that happen. You know, cast down the imaginations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just think the thoughts of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We know these things must happen, brothers and sisters. But but we know there's going to be a resurrection, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord sent a prophet and told us the things that are to be. Amen. He he he told us, "Don't be surprised when things when these things happen. The world will be totally insane, you know, and uh and and and told us how it would be." And it's exactly the way the Lord told him it would be. That's exactly how it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, continuing on verse 39, excuse me. Jesus said, um, "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me have." And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not for joy and wondered oh now they believed not for joy. Amen. It just they were just so so it was it seemed too good to be true. Amen. And wondered. He said unto them, "Have you hear any meat?" And he and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of an honeycomb. And he took it and did eat before them. And just to to prove he said, "Does a does a spirit eat meat and drink?" you know, um, [snorts] &gt;&gt; but he was just to to prove to them. &gt;&gt; And see, he he bears with us sometimes in our in our &gt;&gt; lack of understanding, you know. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. He's he's a he's a our teacher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes I'm sure Brother Jesse knows. I hear from my sister Shai. She's a teacher there at the at the at a school there. And and [snorts] um you got to be patient. From what I've heard, I'm not I have never taught in a school, but but according to what I hear, sometimes you got to be really patient until they catch on to a concept. Now, she teaches, I think, uh, kindergarteners and preschoolers and um, and so you got to be really patient and and and let them catch on. You have to let something be revealed to them. Is that right? Amen. Be patient with them, Lord. Be patient with us, Lord. Just sir, &gt;&gt; and and and help us to be help us to be ready to receive it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Always learning. Amen. Here a little and there a little &gt;&gt; from glory to glory. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Um and he said unto them, "These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me." &gt;&gt; Now, see, this was the time for that to be revealed. Amen. This was the time for that revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The the time of fulfillment. Remember when Jesus was reading from uh Isaiah the prophet in the in the temple and um he he told them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and they they didn't appreciate that being being told in their in their temple because they didn't realize who was in front of them but he told them plainly. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it was hid from them. Amen. They were blinded. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um then verse 45. Then he opened their understanding. Praise the Lord. That's what we want. Amen. &gt;&gt; That they might understand the scriptures. Amen. &gt;&gt; There. And and said unto them, thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I thank the Lord for the word that we have and for for hearing it through a prophet that he gave it directly to him. But I I wonder sometimes like it would have been so neat to hear Jesus himself on the earth, you know, in the flesh preaching this straight from the scriptures because he wrote them. You know, you know, we know it is Jesus himself in the Holy Ghost that reveals that to his prophets and to to his ministers. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it just would have been, you know what I'm what I'm saying. It just would have been something to hear Jesus uh you know in in in the flesh there just opening these things going from Moses and the law and the prophets. you know, he he was he's the expert on the on the subject. Amen. &gt;&gt; It would have been wonderful to just to just hear and and glean all of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And rise from the dead the third day. And then verse 47, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my father upon you. Amen. We know that's the Holy Ghost. Uh, but ter ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high. And he led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and blessed them. And it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. Amen. And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That would have been the most wonderful experience of their lives. Amen. One of them, you know, &gt;&gt; just just to to witness this, to be there and and um but now he's made us witnesses of the power of his resurrection in us. That's that's glorious, too. Amen. What a glorious time we live in to to see the full revelation of the son of man. Amen. The revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. And um I I I wanted to notice some things about this this whole um uh passage we just read here that remember uh from the time they went to the sephilic that these were God's chosen people. These were his group. I just I have some bullet points here that I I was I was thinking as I was reading over these things. Um they were God's chosen people. The ones he had called out his chosen his true church, right? uh even though they hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet, but they were his his church. Amen. And they found themselves seeking the living amongst the dead. Amen. And uh you'll never find the the life the power of the living God. Amen. In in a in a the place of the dead. Amen. And the in the tombs and burial grounds of of dead creeds and denominations and dogmas and and and man-made letter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. But they but God's people were were uh seeking the living among the dead. And then the angels, the messengers um that met them brought to their remembrance the words of Jesus and then preached to them that Jesus was still alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the angel's message reminded them of what Jesus promised he would do. But then remember Jesus came himself and proved it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He [clears throat] and he vindicated it by his presence. Is that right? and showed up himself. Amen. Is this starting to sound familiar? Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Jesus revealed himself in the scriptures. Uh and then right after he revealed himself, he led his little chosen group um out of the religious city and and and then he led them to a certain place and then a rapture took place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And then uh this is this is a a bonus one I had here. Amen. That they returned to Jerusalem and were continually in the temple. Amen. and praising and blessing God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That after the rapture had taken place. Praise the Lord. But if you think about that in in in our day, Amen. God always uh reveals himself through the scripture. You know, scripture has to interpret scripture. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But but God has a program. These things happen. Um God is the same. He likes to do things his way. Amen. His way is a perfect way. And he he hides them from the wise and prudent and reveals them unto babes such as we'll learn. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hiding himself in simplicity and then revealing himself in the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you think about in in in our time that um God's chosen people, Amen. the church, they were they began to to seek the living amongst the dead. you know, they were scattered in in different denominations and and systems and and um then it took an angel messenger, amen, to bring to remembrance the the words of Jesus and to preach that Jesus Christ was still alive, the same yesterday, today and forever. Amen. And then uh and then Jesus came himself when he was preaching uh and and vindicated by his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know in our day the Lord vindicated it by his visible presence in the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and he proved that he himself was doing the revealing. Amen. It was the work of the Lord Jesus Christ on our brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And uh and Jesus revealed himself in the scripture, right? The revelation, remember the the seals, the the church ages, it wasn't anything outside of the scripture. &gt;&gt; It had to be something in that was already hidden in the scripture. just [applause] magnified. Amen. Made known. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But it couldn't come that remember the mystery of God couldn't be finished until the appointed time. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a time for revelation. Praise God. That's our our title by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Um the time for revelation and and and our day was the time. It wasn't to be revealed until the time of the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But that's God's program. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh and then after the revelation of Jesus Christ, Amen. Um when God calls out his chosen group around himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then a rapture takes place. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So that's what we're looking for. Amen. The the program of God. I just thought that was some really neat things in there as I was reading that. I was like, "Praise the Lord." That's exactly the way God likes to work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is evident in the scripture. Praise God. So often [snorts] often if history repeats itself, often it's the Lord's program uh being revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So uh Romans 16 uh and verses 25- 27 here. Praise the Lord. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for revelation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's we can't we can never give ourselves revelation. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We can never um be hol make ourselves holy enough to have all revelation, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can never you can't buy revelation. You can't acquire revelation by by um by laboring with your hands. You know, we we labor to enter into rest and then the Lord reveals things to us. But we can't we can't work um you know enough to just gain revelation. It's not something you can seek and uh and uh physically like u you it's not a u you know you don't have to take a grand journey through all the mountains and the and you don't have to climb to the top of Mount Everest to gain the the the enlightenment of you know what I'm saying but but it's has to be the Lord uh taking taking uh opening your eyes to it. Amen. Because remember, he had told them plainly what was going to happen, but it was still hid from them &gt;&gt; until he opened it to them in the scriptures and revealed himself to them. Amen. In the time that he wanted it to be done, &gt;&gt; then it was going to be hid until the time of revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, revelation is is is only the grace of God. That's how that's what brings revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So in Romans 16 verse 25, now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began. Amen. And now just a a note here. or me and brother Jesse were just talking about people there there's people out there that believe Paul was a liar that believe that his uh epistles were false that he was he was not a real um follower of Christ and uh they discount his teaching but uh that's we know that's the furthest thing from the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh like like me and brother Jesse were talking that uh he said if any man preaches another gospel even an angel from heaven let him be a cursed. Amen. Praise the Lord. We we and we're resting on that. Why? Because brother uh Brandham preached the same gospel that was delivered to Paul. Amen. The faith that was once delivered to the saints, he preached the same thing and we're resting on that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, um and and you know, Peter also another thing we had mentioned earlier was that Peter said that um some of the things that Paul wrote are hard to be understood, but he said, "But those that wrestle with them are unlearned." Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you if you can't take what Paul said, then you can't take what Peter said either. So then what do you have? You know, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, uh, continuing on, but now, verse 26, but now is made manifest. Amen. But now is made manifest. and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God made known to all nations for the obedience of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen. I say amen. To God be all the glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; This mystery he's talking about here um which was was then made manifest. Amen. It was the time then for that revelation um by the scriptures and the prophets. He says, um, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith. &gt;&gt; It was for the obedience of faith. The the mystery here, the the whole mystery of God wasn't finished yet, but this mystery was Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen. The mystery of the gospel. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh, but this was the time for that to be made manifest. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The mystery of the gospel. And then um [clears throat] we find he he talks a little bit more about this here in Colossians the first chapter and starting at verse 23 he says if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof I Paul made a minister and then and it wasn't by his own making himself a minister by his what he made himself was a Pharisee. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But God made him a minister of the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If he would have stayed what he made himself, he would have still been a Pharisee. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise God. Anyway, uh um who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ uh in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church. [clears throat] Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it was through through every age, to every messenger. Amen. to every apostle, the dispensation of God given to them for you, for God's people, God's elect. Amen. Praise the Lord, to fulfill the word of God. That's what it's all for. Praise God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Even the mystery. And now he's talking about the mystery here. The mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery. Amen. the real riches like we heard this morning. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That is the the mystery Paul is talking about here that remember the whole mystery of God hadn't been finished yet. That wasn't to come until this last day. Amen. But the the mystery that was then was in part the revelation of Jesus Christ because it was Christ in you, the Holy Ghost. Amen. The hope of glory. Amen. The the down payment for the resurrection, the earnest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; But this was this was the time for that revelation. Amen. God always has a time and a season. He knew exactly when it would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he coordinated it. No one has to help the Lord. I mean, we're his servants. He uses us to fulfill his word. Amen. He uses his prophets to bring his word and and and his servants to fulfill it. Amen. But God doesn't need anyone to remind him and to help him fulfill his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; As soon as it leaves the lips of God, it's as good as as done as fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes it won't be fulfilled until its season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, uh and and that at that time, remember, uh this was the the time that it was fulfilled that the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Amen. The Gentiles. Praise God. That's us. Praise the Lord. Like Cornelius, we heard this morning God made away that and and and they were the Jews were astonished. They were or they marveled rather that that he it was also sent to the Gentiles. Amen. &gt;&gt; That the gospel was preached to them and they believed it. Not only it was preached to them, but that they believed it and received it and they also received the gift of the Holy Ghost. They said and and remember and they spoke with tongues as well as we. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The same Holy Ghost, not not a different one for Jews and Gentiles. Amen. because now there's neither Jew nor Greek, you know, um nor bond nor free, but we're all baptized by one spirit into one body. Amen. Praise God. I'm so grateful he made a way for us to be in it, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The people who walked in darkness had seen a great light. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was fulfilled in its season. Amen. When the great light was come. Amen. &gt;&gt; When when Jesus came. Amen. Praise God. And uh then we find here uh we're going to read a little bit from Luke chapter 1 here. We find this right before the birth of John the Baptist. Um this is when an angel had appeared to Zachcharias uh in the temple here. And um he and and Elizabeth, it says they were devout. They they walked in the commandments of God blameless. Um and so this angel is appearing to Zacharias. They had been they had prayed unto the Lord. Um because Elizabeth, his wife, was barren. and she had never had children. And um that was a very hard thing for the the women back then. It was it was looked down on in society when someone was barren. And um &gt;&gt; they thought about it just very differently back then. And so they had no doubt probably prayed countless times for the Lord to open her womb. &gt;&gt; But now there's a an angel that appears to Zachcharias as he's fulfilling his priestly duty here. And uh verse 13 of Luke 1 says, "But the angel said unto him, fear not, Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful your prayer is heard? Amen. &gt;&gt; And thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and call his name John, and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb. Amen. In other words, don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. Amen. That's a that's another uh another message. Praise the Lord. Another another sermon for another day. Praise the Lord. But &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. Hallelujah. And um and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias. Amen. That's what it is. Amen. to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. And Zachchariah said unto the angel, "Whereby shall I know this? For I am old, an old man, and my wife wellstricken in years." Amen. This this thing he had prayed for uh you know, he and Elizabeth probably probably sincerely prayed before God always. Well, we know they did because God heard their prayer and uh now it was to be answered. And now that he heard it, and then he uh he had a hard time believing it. He said, "But my wife is old." And and and the way brother Brandham talks about it is the difference between him and Mary. Um because remember, she said, "How can these things be um no one no virgin had ever conceived before?" And so she was curious what she was supposed to do, you know, and um and how the word of the Lord would be fulfilled. But in this case, um especially being a priest here, um Zecharias had the example of of Abraham. Amen. and Sarah &gt;&gt; how he had opened her womb and and Hannah he had opened her womb and um and he still he had a hard time believing it and um it's kind of amazes me his question here um he said how shall I know this um as if an angel didn't just come and tell him that it was going to be amen &gt;&gt; but sometimes our our human minds are just foolish that way you know &gt;&gt; sometimes we're we're slow to believe uh all the things that have been spoken &gt;&gt; but thank the Lord He's gracious with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and bears with us a little in our in our folly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But look what the angel tells him. And he says, "And the angel answered answering said unto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings. And behold, thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season." Amen. So this he he told them what was to come to pass and then he tells them um that they'll be fulfilled in their season. There was a time that had to come in order for them to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um every prophecy has has its season to be fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; To everything there's a season. Amen. And um and like we like we said when we open here from Isaiah, the Lord sends his word to accomplish whatsoever he pleases, what he what he desires it to perform. Amen. To accomplish. He like he sends the rain in its season and the and fall comes in its season. Um winter comes in season, spring and summer. Just like he's established those seasons, so has he established spiritual seasons at times for his word to come to pass. Amen. And unfold exactly as he wanted it to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't you believe he he preserves his own word? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But John couldn't come and be born um until the season, right? Until right before Jesus had come. uh because he was appointed to be a forerunner. Amen. The forerunner of Jesus. So he had to come right at the right time. Amen. The the he was not that light, but he he came to bear witness of the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they so they had to come just at the right time. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in due time. Praise God. And um in Habach here, I want to read Habach uh chapter 2 starting at verse two. And uh you know, John couldn't come in Abraham's day. He he couldn't come in in Noah's day, you know. Um but he had to come in John's day. Is that right? The the the appointed time for that scripture to be fulfilled. Praise the Lord. Amen. Everything in in the season and timing of the Lord. Amen. Now, Habach chapter 2 and verse two. Um, and the Lord answered me and said, "Write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it." Now, the the vision he saw uh I believe was of the Babylonian invasion there in um verse three says, "For the vision is yet for an appointed time." So, it hadn't happened yet, but the Lord showed him the things that were going to come to pass. Amen. That's what what visions are. Amen. And it's it's this it's the prophecy, the spirit of prophecy. It's the testimony of Jesus Christ. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So the the vision is yet for an appointed time. Amen. But at the end it shall speak and not lie, though it tar. Wait for it because it will surely come and not tarry. In other words, it won't be delayed. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be right on time. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it is yet for an appointed time. And notice he said, "At the end it shall speak." Amen. There's there's always a voice behind the vision and and a voice behind the sign. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's it's it's the voice of God that that speaks to his prophets revealing things. Amen. &gt;&gt; But they can only come to pass in their season. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think you understand what I'm what I'm saying here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. But and also remember um in the time of Daniel, Amen. that uh he had seen the the vision there and the angel told him to shut up the words and and to seal the book even to the time of the end. &gt;&gt; So the the book that Daniel was to seal until the time of the end was was a sealed book, right? And that's exactly what it was until the time of the end. Then the things uh which he he saw were to be hidden until then. Until that time. Amen. when the when we know the lamb would take the book at the appointed time and loose the seals on it and open it. Praise God. And reveal the whole plan of redemption that had been from the beginning. Amen. The the whole revelation of himself, Jesus Christ, the righteous. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And um it it wasn't to it was not to happen before. It was not to happen after. It was exactly in the time God wanted it to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God is never late. and and and he's never in the wrong time. He's always in the right time. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And of course, we we hear this scripture often uh in Revelation 10:7. [clears throat] But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants, the prophets. Amen. the this the book that that uh we saw Daniel was to to seal until the time of the end um it had to be sealed until this time. Amen. Until it was time for the mystery to be finished and unveiled. Amen. Praise the Lord. That which was hid from the beginning. Praise God. Amen. And this is that's the time we're living in now. Amen. The the days of the voice of the seventh angel. The voice the shout has gone forth. Amen. The voice is has gone forth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And but remember, it's not just because, you know, it's it's not just for no reason, but it's to somebody. &gt;&gt; It's to accomplish something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's it's to a a an elected Amen. to to Christ's bride. Amen. To pull her out &gt;&gt; and and and to make her ready. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; To make ready a people for the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And revelation can only come to you personally if you are prepared to receive it. Is that right? Amen. You've got to be ready to receive it. Amen. You you you uh I'd say like this. You can't catch nothing if you ain't fishing. Amen. Praise God. You can only you can only catch if you're casting for it. Amen. You're not going to catch anything by sitting and staring at the water. Amen. Praise God. But it can only come in in the Lord's season. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just want to be ready for it. Like Jesus said uh in in the parable here of the seed uh in Luke 8 [clears throat] and uh verses 5-15 here uh Jesus says in this parable that a sewer went out to sew his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns And the thorns sprang up uh with it and choked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit and hundfold. And when he had said these things, watch this is kind of a a strange seems to be a strange place for this, but when he had said these things, he cried, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that sound familiar? Praise the Lord. It was the same the same Lord Jesus in in Revelation that said, "He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And um and his disciples asked him, saying, "What might this parable be?" And he said, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables, seeing uh that seeing they might see and hearing they might not understand." Now, the parable is this. Thank the Lord. He he opens his word to us. Amen. He gives a parable. He gives a a a teaching. He hides something in simplicity, but then he reveals it in the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank the Lord. He He said, "The parable is this. This is what it means." Praise God. I'm going to I'm going to share my secret with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You're grateful for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; The parable is this. The seed is the word of God. See, it's it's that simple. Sometimes it it takes the the almighty God to reveal something so simple. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are they that hear. Then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy, and these have no root uh which for a while believe, and in the time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life. Amen. And and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they which is which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience. Amen. Praise God. Lord, help us to have an honest and good heart. Amen. uh tilled up, you know, the the hard ground broken up, tender before the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. With with good nutrients. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a of a good honest and good heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it's got to be tilled up, you know, before it can receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but it has to be that way in order to receive the the seed of the word. Amen. Praise the Lord. That word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee. Praise God. Amen. and let us keep the seed of the word in there. Praise the Lord. Don't let any anything take it away. Amen. And uh in the book of Acts here in chapter 8 and verse 26, um [clears throat] we read here a a story with Philip here. And I think this is a really amazing story. It just amazes me when I read it. It's just it's amazing. Praise the Lord. And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philillip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went, and behold, a man of Ethiopia and unic of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, uh, who had the charge of of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, [clears throat] was returning, and sitting in his chariot, uh, read Isaas the prophet or Isaiah the prophet. Then the spirit said unto Philillip, "Go near and join thyself to this chariot." Notice this is one thing I find so amazing about this is that the Lord put it on Philip's heart spoke to him clearly and the spirit told him to go join to this chariot just for this one man this one brother who was reading the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; For one person the Lord sent Philillip there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [clears throat] And the spirit said unto Philip, "Go near, join thyself to this chariot." And Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet uh Isaiah and said, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" Amen. And he said, "How can I except some man should guide me?" Amen. How can how can we understand all these things except someone should guide us? Amen. That's what prophets are for, brothers and sisters. The word of the Lord comes to the prophets. Amen. Surely I'll do nothing except I declare it to my servants the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; And uh so he said, "How can I accept someone should guide me?" Amen. Thank the Lord we have the Holy Spirit to guide us through the scriptures. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And he desired Philip that he should come up and sit with him. And uh notice his attitude here, the Unix attitude. He uh when Philip asked him, "Do you understand what you're reading?" He didn't say, "What do you mean do I understand?" Of course, I understand. You know, or that's not any of your business, you know. He said he said, "No, how can I?" He was honest. He said, "How can I except someone should guide me?" And then he wanted him to come up there with him. He said, "Well, maybe you can explain it to me." Amen. And the place of the scripture which he read was this. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. And like a lamb done before his sheer, so he opened he not his mouth. And his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. And who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. And the unic answered Philillip and said, I pray thee, uh, of whom speaketh the prophet this, of himself or of some other man? Amen. He he he didn't yet understand what the scripture was saying, but that's why the Lord sent a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; A God- sent man, a man sent from God to open the scripture. Is that right? Praise the Lord. Then I love this. This is I love this verse here. Amen. I love all of it, but you know what I mean. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then 35. Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what it's all for. Amen. To to preach unto you Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's what I'm trying to do by the help of the Lord. Preach unto you Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the main thing. Like we're here this morning. &gt;&gt; Don't miss the main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. preached unto him Jesus. Hallelujah. And um that's what the Lord sent him to do just to one man. Amen. And as they went their way, they came under certain water. And the unic said, "See, here is water. What do hinder me to be baptized?" And Philip said, "If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayaest?" And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God." Amen. What a glorious confession. Praise the Lord. What a what a glorious decision thou has made. Amen. Praise the Lord. And you know, I was thinking that that, you know, we don't have to only confess it when we're saved. Amen. We can confess it all the time. I still believe it. &gt;&gt; I I still believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. What a what a glorious confession that is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the unic. And he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the spirit of the Lord caught away Philillip that the unic saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing. Hallelujah. [clears throat] So the Lord sent Philillip specifically to this brother to preach to him Jesus. Amen. But notice the condition when Philip found him, he was he was already in the scripture. Amen. He already had the book open before him searching the scriptures. Amen. And and and he was found reading. Amen. Found searching. Praise the Lord. And in the right attitude. Amen. Saying, "I don't understand, but how can I understand except someone teach me?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "Come, come up in my chariot. Maybe you can show me. Maybe you can teach me. What does this mean?" Hallelujah. He was He wanted to learn. Amen. &gt;&gt; God re That's That's who God reveals himself unto. Babe, such as we'll learn. Praise the Lord. He didn't say, "No, he said uh it's none of your business." You know, I of course I understand what I'm reading. You know, praise the Lord. But he was he he desired to know. He wanted to know. Amen. And uh that's how revelation comes to people who are who are seeking for it and who are already in the scripture. Amen. How can the Lord reveal you something reveal to you something in the scripture if you're not in the scripture? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I I I pray he helps me get more into the scripture and and open my understanding more. How can I understand except he reveal it to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Except he opens my eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes, you know, sometimes he waits to show us things, you know, and and um we might have something on the shelf for years and years or months or um and you know, it's just something maybe that's been a question and we don't understand. Said, "Lord, I believe this. I just I don't fully understand maybe." And and uh I know I have. You know, I I've had things I didn't understand and just put it on the shelf, you know. Um but sometimes the Lord waits until a certain time in your life where it will help you the most &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God's sake and then he reveals it to you. Amen. And often often at least in in my experience, brother, maybe maybe yours as well, usually it'll come with more revelation with other revelations. Amen. One thing will open more things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. at least in my life things I I didn't quite understand. Um, and then when the Lord showed me and and and opened my understanding, then it it it was like a domino effect. Well, now I understand this and and that makes sense because of this, you know, and then you see it through the scripture and you see it. You see the Lord confirm it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes he waits until just the appointed time when you need it the most, not realizing it. You don't know that, but he knows it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's it's it's the time for revelation. the the revelation in its due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We uh if we wait on the Lord, he'll give us that spiritual food. It's spiritual food in due season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Always at the right time. Thank the Lord. Um and in Psalm [clears throat] 145 and uh verses 15-19 it says the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their meat in due season. Hallelujah. Uh all creation waits on the Lord uh including us. We wait on him. Uh he feeds the birds of the air, you know, the beasts of the field. He he provides them meat, food, you know, and um and and so do we. We we rely on the Lord to to give us our daily bread and to give us spiritual bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And he he gives them their meat in due season. Praise the Lord. Thou openest thine hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing. Hallelujah. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him. He also will hear their cry and will save them. Amen. What did Jesus say? Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You're you're blessed just for hungering and thirst for thirsting for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. We're we're going to wind this down here if you'd stand to your feet. Praise God. Aren't you grateful how the Lord uh has a a time in our lives and and and and throughout history, you know, in our day, in our age, and in our personal life, times and seasons that he he reveals things exactly when they need to be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. In order that his purpose might be accomplished and and that his people might be helped and edified, Amen. And that his plan will be revealed. Amen. To those that he loves. Amen. Praise the Lord. He He desires to to share all his his secrets with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; With whom he loves, his his bride. Amen. His wife. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Aren't you you glad he gives us spiritual meat in due season? Spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows all things. He's He knew the end from the beginning. Amen. It was all all according to his fornowledge. He predestined these things and and and appointed times and seasons. Praise the Lord for his word. So shall my word be. He said that goeth forth out of my mouth and shall accomplish that whereto I send it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And you know if if faith comes by hearing the word, Amen. then then uh rapturing faith must also come from the word. Amen. And remember brothers and sisters like uh like we were saying, remember the unic? He was already in the word. Amen. Already searching the scriptures and the Lord, that's why the Lord could send him a man with with a a message that could teach him the scripture because he was in the scripture. &gt;&gt; How are we going to catch a revelation of of a rapture if we're not in the word, brothers and sisters? It's a word revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's feasting on the word to make a word body. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the the rapturing faith also comes by the word. Amen. But it's going to be at an appointed time. Amen. and it'll be it'll be made manifest unto us. Hallelujah. The Lord knows all things, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll we'll we'll wind it down right there. And there's a I know there's a much more we could we could say on this here, but I I trust the Lord has helped get the uh the point across here that that there's a time for revelation, a time for things to come to pass. And remember, we are we are in a time of there's turmoil, there's insanity, &gt;&gt; there's um There's unknown things, you know, just crazy things, you know, and unsuities and men's hearts failing them for fear and and and and all these things and in diverse places and you know, you don't know what's the truth in the in the news anyway. We know what the truth is, but you never know who's telling you the truth, you know, on the global scheme of things. But what Jesus say, why are you troubled? Why do thoughts arise in your heart? Amen. Uh and like we heard this morning, don't you know your heavenly father knows what you have need of? Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that he that chose you will take care of you? Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't he didn't bring us this far like the song says to leave us. &gt;&gt; He didn't teach us to swim to let us drown. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't build his home in us in us in us just to move away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He didn't pick us up to let us down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad? He He's got a a purpose for us. He He already knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he sent his word for us. It wasn't just because he felt like talking, because he felt like saying something. Amen. No, he said it specifically to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order that they might be drawn unto himself, pulled out um and and ready for the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let us receive that word. Amen. In in our hearts. Amen. As we bow our heads, Lord, how we love you, Father. We appreciate you.
