[0:03] sorry children you know what you know we
[0:04] normally do the studies but it kind of
[0:06] felt like since i didn't get to preach a
[0:07] whole sermon i couldn't
[0:10] i want to preach a full sermon
[0:12] second timothy 3 13 second timothy 3 13.
[0:15] i like to look at the mighty men again i
[0:16] thought i was done with this but then i
[0:18] heard a sermon i was listening to
[0:19] invisible union and then i was listening
[0:21] to another
[0:22] and i just felt kind of inspired to
[0:25] preach maybe one or two more sermons on
[0:27] mighty
[0:28] men second timothy 3 13 2nd timothy 3
[0:32] 13.
[0:47] second timothy 3 13.
[0:56] so verse 13 gives us the prophecy of the
[0:58] age we're living in it's the most
[0:59] deceptive age
[1:01] right as we saw even this morning are we
[1:02] live nothing
[1:03] okay so as we saw this morning people
[1:05] can sit in any church and think
[1:06] everything is saying or everything is
[1:08] okay they're all secure
[1:10] and uh people can be so deceived that
[1:12] they won't even move when the holy
[1:13] spirit's moving on them may god help us
[1:15] to be sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:17] when the holy spirit moves on us we'll
[1:19] respond
[1:21] that's a great that's a great attribute
[1:23] to have that's a sensitivity to the holy
[1:25] spirit that we praise god
[1:27] verse 13 says by evil men and seducers
[1:29] shall act worse and worse deceiving and
[1:31] being deceived but continue thou the
[1:33] things which thou hast learned
[1:35] and has been assured of
[1:39] think about what you've learned in the
[1:40] gospel of jesus christ what have you
[1:41] learned and what are you certain of
[1:44] see because this is the only way to
[1:46] overcome deception
[1:48] okay this is what paul gives us here
[1:50] knowing of whom thou hast learned them
[1:52] you learn them from paul you learn them
[1:54] from the prophet today it's from brother
[1:55] branham praise god pointing us to the
[1:57] word
[2:00] verse 15
[2:01] and that from a child timothy thou has
[2:04] known the holy scriptures which are able
[2:07] to make the wise or i would say mighty
[2:10] that's kind of where i'm getting this
[2:11] thought for the mighty men and women
[2:13] their scriptures make the wise unto
[2:15] deliverance or salvation
[2:18] through faith which is in christ jesus
[2:22] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[2:24] god and is profitable for doctrine for
[2:26] reproof for correction for instruction
[2:29] in righteousness let's read verse 17
[2:30] together ready one two three that the
[2:32] man of god may be perfect thoroughly
[2:35] furnished unto all good works that god
[2:38] has blessings to remove his word you may
[2:40] be seated praise god
[2:43] what kind of feels good to be free here
[2:44] tonight my god's going to have to worry
[2:46] about anything if i say something wrong
[2:48] i'll just i won't put it on the live
[2:49] stream
[2:50] you know wednesday night i did speak on
[2:52] some personal things related to beliefs
[2:54] i had about the message so i did not
[2:55] make that sermon public i didn't want to
[2:57] offend people
[2:59] um but if you'd like to
[3:00] hear it let me know i still have a link
[3:02] to it by god's grace i was kind of
[3:04] making uh
[3:05] doctrinal stands you know where i stand
[3:07] on certain things regarding the greater
[3:08] works and the double portion and
[3:11] uh son of god son of man david so i just
[3:14] kind of felt like
[3:16] i think i'll keep that in-house you know
[3:18] by god's grace but if anyone would like
[3:19] to listen to that again or you didn't
[3:20] get a chance to listen to it you could
[3:22] certainly do that
[3:23] um
[3:24] i guess i was really enthused i was
[3:26] under a was under a strong
[3:28] burden to you know
[3:30] show where i stood with the word of god
[3:32] on some of these so i hope that was a
[3:33] blessing
[3:35] more winning wednesday i'll preach a
[3:36] second part to that son of man son of
[3:38] god instead of david
[3:40] so i did a lot of preachers i'm going to
[3:41] preach i'm sorry i did a lot of
[3:42] teachings i'm going to preach kind of
[3:43] tonight my god the lord will help me
[3:46] here by god's grace so uh the purpose of
[3:48] this series part five we want to
[3:49] increase our faith in god uh so he can
[3:52] work mightily in our lives and as we saw
[3:54] the might will come from the inspired
[3:57] word of god praise god uh in an age of
[4:00] deception
[4:01] the strength that we need to pull from
[4:03] will be the written word of god the holy
[4:06] spirit directing us to the word praise
[4:07] god
[4:08] to speak the word of god because the
[4:10] word of god is mighty it's the mighty
[4:12] weapon
[4:13] uh tim or paul told the corinthians it's
[4:15] mighty for the pulling down of
[4:17] strongholds praise god hallelujah no oh
[4:21] yeah i have slides i'm sorry did i tell
[4:22] you that my phone
[4:24] um
[4:25] so david's mighty men if you look at it
[4:27] were mighty because they never lost a
[4:29] battle they might have lost a few men in
[4:30] there but as far as i understand they
[4:33] never lost the battle as far as somebody
[4:35] correct me if i'm wrong here my second
[4:36] memory okay
[4:39] i couldn't find one in the scripture
[4:40] where they lost a battle they were
[4:42] mighty men
[4:44] and so neither do we have to lose a
[4:45] battle and what i mean by a battle is a
[4:48] calculated attack of the enemy it may
[4:50] last five minutes may last five hours
[4:53] may last five days
[4:55] but we don't have to lose that battle
[4:57] praise god
[4:58] we can win that battle praise god
[5:01] it may be a spirit of fear or spirit of
[5:03] depression that was trying to come upon
[5:05] us
[5:06] right or a spirit of sickness that might
[5:08] come upon us
[5:09] well we might even get sick a little bit
[5:11] but that don't mean we lost the battle
[5:12] praise god
[5:14] we didn't give up and forsake the lord
[5:16] and quit well i'm giving up and i'm done
[5:18] with it you know we never lost the
[5:20] battle praise god amen
[5:22] we might struggle we might battle praise
[5:24] god we might fight we might feel weak
[5:27] but we never lost praise god as long as
[5:29] we keep faith in god's word we never
[5:31] lost we never have to say i was defeated
[5:33] we can still say with god's help all
[5:35] things are possible praise
[5:38] we don't have to so i'm looking like
[5:39] that you know we always hear that quote
[5:41] my man says when the bride knows who she
[5:42] is she'll be an invincible army i
[5:44] believe we are that praise god
[5:47] not going to be we are praise god
[5:50] if i was invincible brother william i
[5:52] would have already left praise god
[5:53] that's right the devil already would
[5:55] have defeated me and made me quit and
[5:58] give up and i would have ran back to the
[5:59] pentecostal church or the chapel or
[6:01] something like that but by god's grace
[6:03] the word of god makes us invincible
[6:05] praise god
[6:07] mighty to the pulling down of
[6:09] strongholds
[6:12] i mean invincible like he's never going
[6:13] to get me off the course
[6:16] he might he definitely gets punches on
[6:18] me every day definitely he'll punch me
[6:20] but that doesn't mean i lost the battle
[6:24] i'm still standing here
[6:26] i still got the sharpest most active
[6:29] living weapon god's ever given to man
[6:31] that's his
[6:32] word hallelujah praise god
[6:36] i might get some uh pains i might get
[6:38] some scars no doubt i get some scars
[6:42] you get you get struggles
[6:45] you feel frustrated
[6:47] you feel weak hopeless helpless
[6:50] but you never quit you never lose the
[6:53] full battle praise god
[6:55] so i think that quote is for now i think
[6:57] the bride's always been invincible
[6:59] praise god amen no matter what they did
[7:02] in the first church age second third
[7:03] with constantine they were still
[7:05] invincible praise god
[7:08] when they saw them asunder they were
[7:09] still invincible because they never
[7:11] stopped fighting for truth amen
[7:14] hallelujah amen that's what i'm talking
[7:16] about the battle for truth the battle to
[7:18] keep your testimony the battle to never
[7:21] give in to the enemy praise god
[7:23] the battle to never say uh i give up or
[7:26] i quit or it's not true or maybe i was
[7:29] wrong well i'm always wrong the bible's
[7:31] always right though
[7:33] not the devil tell me i'm wrong i do get
[7:35] wrong sometimes but the word is never
[7:37] wrong jesus says never lie his word is
[7:40] true his word is the present truth this
[7:42] revelation is right it's thus saith the
[7:44] lord and we've got the mighty weapons of
[7:46] god's word and we're not going anywhere
[7:48] praise god god's word cannot be moved
[7:50] this finger cannot be shaken but it
[7:53] cannot
[7:56] be i'm standing as a soldier in the
[8:00] kingdom of god
[8:01] [Applause]
[8:03] i look at the mighty men i see you and i
[8:06] brothers that can't be moved sisters
[8:08] children that can't be moved they're not
[8:10] moving they're still battling we're
[8:12] still
[8:13] driving out to amrit
[8:15] we're still driving driving out the
[8:17] philistines hallelujah and the hittites
[8:20] and each one we're still driving them
[8:21] out i haven't quit
[8:23] i haven't given up the land i haven't
[8:25] given up uh my possessions praise god
[8:27] i'm still fighting for my possessions
[8:31] i'll keep fighting for yours too
[8:33] you just keep fighting for mine
[8:35] in other words keep praying for me
[8:36] praise god i'll keep praying for you
[8:38] hallelujah we won't give up praise god
[8:41] we might lose a few uh we might get a
[8:44] few hits on us or something like that
[8:46] not feel like we lost but we've never
[8:49] lost the battle yet praise god because
[8:51] i'm still standing you're still standing
[8:53] praise god amen amen hallelujah
[8:58] i just thought this was an interesting
[9:00] prayer brother man prayed for men to be
[9:02] mighty in the land
[9:04] he's actually talking about the uh
[9:08] businessmen's association christmas
[9:09] christian businessmen association before
[9:12] the seals we consecrate our lives to you
[9:14] as i've asked my brothers and sisters
[9:16] here to do so i do myself oh god i lay
[9:19] myself on the rock like the eagles he's
[9:20] not about the eagle how his beat gets
[9:22] filmed over
[9:24] and he's got to beat that beak
[9:26] now i've never seen it but i heard a
[9:27] preacher said he used to have a pet bird
[9:29] and the pet bird his beak would grow
[9:31] like that and he had to beat his beak to
[9:33] get all the all the crust off there
[9:35] so i thought that's a good that's a real
[9:36] life example praise god he had a pet
[9:39] bird growing up and the bird would have
[9:40] to smack its beak until it broke off all
[9:42] the extra whatever it was you know
[9:45] cartilage or whatever it was whatever
[9:46] that whatever the nail this thing is
[9:48] there uh
[9:50] the mineral in your body
[9:52] but what i'm saying see like a lather on
[9:54] the rock
[9:55] he said oh god with every prayer i know
[9:57] how beat everything ungodly away from me
[10:00] lord amen
[10:01] that's our prayer praise god i pray that
[10:04] you'll mold me until i can reflect your
[10:06] life granted lord help me be true and
[10:08] honest let me want to beat your hearts
[10:10] help me to always be strong and brave
[10:12] amen
[10:13] help me father to carry the word to the
[10:15] unmissionary lands of the world granite

[10:19] association may it live and may it
[10:21] prosper and go on and see the coming of
[10:23] the lord and get many souls ready praise

[10:37] jesus christ amen
[10:39] when he becomes a rapturous bride
[10:42] he said give us men of honor men of
[10:44] integrity men that's great men now later
[10:46] he said don't call anybody great but we
[10:48] know what he's saying in god's eyes
[10:50] right
[10:51] who spend their own living take off
[10:53] their time now here's how he says how
[10:55] this is why they're honorable men they
[10:57] spend their own money
[10:59] they take off their time to bring the
[11:01] gospel
[11:02] support ministers to come in and spread
[11:04] the word god we love them and we pray
[11:07] that they'll be mighty in the land and
[11:09] used in your hand praise god mighty men
[11:12] among us praise god
[11:13] we want mighty men mighty women children
[11:16] everyone can be mighty in the lord
[11:17] praise god
[11:18] as we've seen with our children get some
[11:19] of these testimonies recently by god's
[11:21] grace it's been wonderful
[11:23] to see that
[11:24] so just a good i just thought this was a
[11:26] good quote that helped you to see how
[11:27] can we be mighty let's be honest
[11:29] praise god let's be strong and brave
[11:31] amen let's tell the truth praise god
[11:33] let's if we got to use let's use our own
[11:35] money praise god
[11:37] let's use our own money to support the
[11:38] gospel let's use our own time let's
[11:41] invest more time in the things of god
[11:43] amen amen see and god use us help us to
[11:46] be mighty in this area and in in your
[11:49] hand by god's grace amen amen
[11:52] now remember god's mighty power was
[11:54] constantly working in paul mightily
[11:56] right he had the baptism holy ghost now
[11:59] so god mightily empowered paul to labor
[12:02] and strive to preach
[12:05] so he was striving with him that's what
[12:06] i thought this morning was really
[12:07] striving
[12:08] i was really striving just to pull one
[12:10] person up i mean striving i was you
[12:12] don't sweat that fast but i was sweating
[12:14] within 20 minutes i was trying to preach
[12:16] so hard
[12:17] without shouting here you know without
[12:19] spinning or something like that trying
[12:20] to be real good pulpit managers that's
[12:23] right
[12:24] you don't have many but uh
[12:27] he said i am empowered and i'm striving
[12:30] to preach the people to teach them and
[12:33] to warn every man praise god
[12:36] hallelujah this was how god worked
[12:38] mightily in him you see church when
[12:41] you're laboring for somebody you're
[12:42] praying for somebody that's god mightily
[12:45] working in you praise god you want to
[12:47] witness for someone or you want to see
[12:48] someone heal and you just devote a
[12:50] little extra time a little extra prayer
[12:52] or get on your knees or you lift their
[12:54] name up to god
[12:55] whenever you're working with others and
[12:57] trying to get christ more in their lives
[12:59] be a blessing in them that's the mighty
[13:01] work of god working in you praise god
[13:04] this is not limited to preachers praise
[13:06] god because eternal life is living for
[13:08] others amen amen
[13:10] this was paul's commission to live for
[13:12] others to preach and what's not
[13:14] everybody's commission to preach but
[13:16] when you give of yourself praise god
[13:18] when you give up your time when you give
[13:20] up your money and you witness or you do
[13:22] something to try to encourage someone to
[13:24] come to christ it's god working in you
[13:26] mightily to be a blessing to someone
[13:28] else praise god
[13:30] hallelujah
[13:32] it cannot be limited just there
[13:35] for preaching in other words if you
[13:36] don't preach you can still have the
[13:38] mighty power of god work through you
[13:39] praise god
[13:41] and so preachers i know even myself
[13:43] sometimes i disappoint myself why is the
[13:45] power of god working more through me
[13:46] right i just want to be humble
[13:48] i can be more humble i can be more
[13:50] dedicated praise god
[13:52] i can be more consecrated but when i see
[13:55] the spirit of god striving in me to warn
[13:58] teach or preach i know it's like paul
[14:00] it's god's spirit working mightily in me
[14:03] praise god
[14:04] because i'm not a lover of self i'm not
[14:06] a lovers of pleasures i'm the lover of
[14:08] god amen
[14:09] you are you praise god we're lovers of
[14:11] god we're lovers of the word we love god
[14:14] we keep his commands amen amen
[14:19] now here's our text this was paul's
[14:22] command how to overcome in the age of
[14:24] the greatest deception it's not the
[14:26] darkest age the dark horse rider proved
[14:28] that that was the darkest age during the
[14:30] dark ages about a thousand years my
[14:32] brother called satan's uh eden if i'm
[14:34] not mistaken or saints millennium there
[14:36] it is
[14:37] it's like the pope's millennium
[14:38] basically that's right uh satan's
[14:40] millennium
[14:42] 900 some years of dark ages
[14:44] that was the darkest time
[14:46] jezebel religion that's right complete
[14:49] jezebel religion but in our day it's the
[14:52] most deceptive day according to paul
[14:54] and jesus where he said uh because
[14:57] iniquity abound the love of god shall
[14:58] wax cold so we less love today it's very
[15:01] hard to find real christian love today
[15:03] that's why church we gotta just pour it
[15:04] out on each other praise god we gotta we
[15:06] gotta just be willing to show love even
[15:08] if we don't get love back we gotta show
[15:09] love praise god
[15:11] you gotta just smile and take it praise
[15:13] god
[15:14] just show it up amen be different praise
[15:16] god
[15:18] now i'm gonna just break this down a
[15:19] little bit here so we see the warning of
[15:22] deception
[15:24] people are gonna think they're saved
[15:25] when they're not
[15:27] right
[15:28] people are going to think they're
[15:29] sanctified when they're not how about
[15:32] this one for this morning people are
[15:33] going to be filled with the holy ghost
[15:35] when they're not they think they are but
[15:37] they're not
[15:38] see but paul says
[15:41] continue this is the age of deception so
[15:44] continue
[15:45] in what you've learned
[15:47] see how learning is a good thing as
[15:48] aggression
[15:49] if you don't learn in church something's
[15:51] wrong with you
[15:52] or something's wrong with me hopefully
[15:54] there's nothing wrong with any of us
[15:55] hopefully we're writing god's perfect
[15:56] will
[15:57] but if we're not learning something's
[15:59] wrong somewhere either the preacher or
[16:02] yourself
[16:03] we should be learning praise god i'm
[16:05] constantly learning like the mighty man
[16:06] that's been all new to me praise god
[16:09] something i've never really preached
[16:10] before praise god that's why i go to
[16:11] those new books like colossians and
[16:13] ephesians philippians i love i always
[16:15] learn something new in there wow never
[16:16] do this look at that
[16:18] constantly learning and it's such an
[16:19] encouragement to me praise god to see
[16:21] how this is christians of old this is
[16:23] how they overcame and if they overcame i
[16:26] could overcome greatness
[16:28] amen
[16:29] if they only had 10 years left if they
[16:31] gave everything they got to the
[16:32] earthquake cave then i'll give
[16:33] everything i got to the tribulation cup
[16:36] praise god because i don't know the day
[16:37] of the hour
[16:39] i just had a friend i see him uh a
[16:42] couple of times a month

[17:38] faithful husband
[17:40] i said god loves a faithful dad like you
[17:42] men to your children and your
[17:43] grandchildren

[17:47] i said half the country has fallen away
[17:49] and we still got half that you know
[17:50] conservative you know i said we're a
[17:52] part of that good half you know
[17:54] and i just we went on talking

[18:09] life
[18:11] saturday morning i got a text that he
[18:12] passed away
[18:14] when i left his house the thought came
[18:16] to me
[18:17] you were talking to him like he was
[18:19] gonna die
[18:21] i just brushed it off
[18:23] i just brushed it off like oh no no
[18:26] it's like i was building him up like i
[18:28] said i said god saw all your sacrifices
[18:30] you made for your children god saw all
[18:32] that you did for your wife and your
[18:34] children
[18:35] and he's a catholic guy
[18:37] but i said god saw all that and god
[18:39] loves a faithful father because god is a
[18:41] father
[18:43] then two days later i get the news that
[18:44] he passed away
[18:45] church we're not guaranteed anything in
[18:47] this life
[18:48] you can see somebody a few days they
[18:50] could be gone
[18:52] right
[18:54] i'm not sure how i got on that
[18:56] but the point i want to make is that
[18:59] you know the bible said continuing the
[19:01] things i was learned i'm not sure how i
[19:03] got them
[19:04] i guess i just want to say let's be
[19:06] ready to go at any time by god's grace
[19:08] ready
[19:15] but that was a great reminder to me lord
[19:17] help me to be ready i want you to always
[19:19] give help me to be faithful praise god
[19:21] because i never know the man says when
[19:23] god's going to pull our card and say
[19:24] time to come home son
[19:26] got to come home
[19:28] so we'll go to his funeral hopefully
[19:29] this week and i'll be able to you know
[19:30] talk to his widow and maybe oh yeah i
[19:33] gave his son both my books before i give
[19:34] him his son both my books three sons and
[19:36] a daughter
[19:39] but just uh
[19:40] let's be always ready serving the lord
[19:42] praise god redeeming the time for the
[19:44] days are evil
[19:45] so it's a time of deception but continue
[19:48] in what you've learned i love this what
[19:50] you've been assured of that's right
[19:51] there's a lot of things you know when we
[19:53] do the kids bible studies that i say i
[19:55] don't know
[19:56] right there's a lot of questions we have
[19:58] how's this going to work out can that
[19:59] person be saved i don't know
[20:01] but paul tells us
[20:03] what you've learned and what you know is
[20:05] certain you keep doing that praise god
[20:08] amen in other words if you know the lord
[20:09] jesus christ baptism is right you keep

[20:26] and then the resurrection was the
[20:28] greatest weekend those are the greatest

[20:45] there to this age of deception praise
[20:47] god
[20:48] don't let him down continue in them
[20:52] see what he says
[20:54] no and you learn them from the prophet
[20:55] of god
[20:56] but everyone tells that thus says the
[20:58] lord well that's enough for me praise
[20:59] god you've got the word of god in the
[21:01] back he's got thus saith the lord and
[21:02] the word to back it up praise god

[21:07] was trained by his mother and his
[21:08] grandmother see how you mothers are so
[21:10] important where's all the mothers and
[21:11] grandmas
[21:12] so important
[21:16] had his mother not enough numbers that
[21:17] was a green
[21:18] his god god had his timothy's mother and
[21:20] grandmother train him up so he would be
[21:23] the most like-minded as the prophet of
[21:25] god that's right
[21:27] i like
[21:29] mom and that
[21:30] i see two i would see a mom and grandma
[21:31] team back there amen
[21:35] mom and grandma teamed up
[21:37] and just planted these scriptures in his
[21:39] heart and his soul in his mind just
[21:41] planting them this is the word this is
[21:44] the holy scripture if you if you believe
[21:46] this you'll be saying timothy praise god
[21:50] just scripture after scripture lay it in
[21:52] there week after week memory verse after
[21:54] memory verse sermon after sermon just
[21:57] lay it in there
[21:58] you've been assured of it you've learned
[22:00] it you know it's right praise god it's
[22:02] the holy scriptures it will make you
[22:04] wise in other words this scripture will

[22:11] you whole praise god amen
[22:14] amen
[22:15] the holy scriptures

[22:22] learn from your mom
[22:23] or your grandmother amen do you say
[22:26] anything about the preachers in here no
[22:28] i'm sure the preacher did a good job i'm
[22:29] sure
[22:30] but he says the holy child you've known
[22:32] this as a child
[22:34] you planted these scriptures in your
[22:36] halloween
[22:38] like i said our hope doesn't rest on a
[22:40] preacher our hope doesn't rest on the
[22:41] tape our hope has an anchor in heaven
[22:43] praise god
[22:45] it's behind the veil it's our hope is a
[22:48] person
[22:50] it's not a thing it's a person it's
[22:52] jesus christ the amen amen
[22:55] amen
[22:57] so continue in them what you've learned
[23:00] and you can be assured of
[23:01] continuing that
[23:03] amen uncertain we'll just put that on
[23:05] the shelf praise god that's right
[23:07] and yes your shelf is going to get full
[23:08] sometimes if you've lived in this if you
[23:10] if you live in the same place for more
[23:12] than a year your shelves are going to
[23:13] get full pretty fast
[23:15] all right when i first got my calls i'm
[23:16] like crazy oh man i got so much room in
[23:18] here now it's overflowing
[23:20] time to go to goodwill praise god
[23:23] but you know it's true like that's how
[23:24] it is with god too right you know god
[23:26] i've all you learned so much about god
[23:28] but then there's like well i wonder
[23:29] about this
[23:31] and then all the girls ask me this one
[23:32] this one this one and now my shelf is
[23:34] full there's all
[23:37] it's okay god will take him down a new
[23:39] season praise god amen
[23:40] i'd rather be filling myself with
[23:42] thoughts about god than other things
[23:43] than women is that right
[23:46] see it's continuing in what you've
[23:48] learned things that you're certain of
[23:50] holy scriptures and your faith is in
[23:53] jesus christ so this is how we'll
[23:55] overcome in this age the holy scriptures
[23:57] that you're taught that you'll learn
[23:59] that you know work keep believing those
[24:01] amen
[24:03] continue with those praise god
[24:05] one what i've always just said this
[24:07] thing brother william this ain't even a
[24:09] sermon or it ain't even a scripture one
[24:11] of the brotherhood of sermons called be
[24:12] certain of god
[24:13] 1959.
[24:15] i've been in trouble you know numerous
[24:17] times where like uh i'm fearful right
[24:20] okay i'll just be fearful like is this
[24:22] going to happen how's it going
[24:24] and i will just quote the title of that
[24:25] sermon
[24:27] i'll just preach it to myself like that
[24:28] song says i'm going to preach to the
[24:29] word he's already
[24:31] song
[24:33] when i'm afraid like when i was afraid i
[24:35] would i missed my flight and i wouldn't
[24:36] be
[24:37] able to see my family on time i just
[24:39] start recording that that sermon title
[24:40] it ain't even a verse
[24:42] i say be certain of god be certain of
[24:43] god and somehow at the last moment i
[24:45] make the flight by god's brain
[24:48] or something that would seem really uh
[24:50] really impossible it'll work out
[24:53] now of course you could take that back
[24:54] to the scripture
[24:56] because all the scripture says you can
[24:58] be certain of god's prophets
[25:00] maybe he's any scripture he's faithful
[25:02] you know god is faithful
[25:03] anything is possible with god you know
[25:05] is anything too hard for the lord from
[25:06] genesis you can use that anything
[25:09] but the point i'm making is that as we
[25:11] battle to be mighty we've got to look
[25:13] back to the holy scriptures and it will
[25:16] it will make us wise to overcome our
[25:18] battles right now it will make us wise
[25:21] to go in the rapture and a wise to make
[25:23] us be a part of the millennium praise
[25:24] god and the future of brexit amen amen
[25:28] amen
[25:29] most people don't most churches don't
[25:31] realize about the millennium they don't
[25:32] even realize it they only realize about
[25:34] the future home
[25:35] you know we have such understanding so
[25:37] may god help us to continue in the
[25:39] things that we know of and we are
[25:41] certain of praise god amen
[25:43] what's been given to us thus saith the
[25:45] lord with the scripture
[25:47] praise god amen
[25:49] now paul after this he goes into this
[25:51] thought all scripture is given by
[25:53] inspiration of god and is profitable for
[25:56] doctrine to teach you
[25:58] also reprove as we said this morning
[26:00] like a rebuke right
[26:02] find your faults
[26:04] right
[26:05] so you know preachers have a delicate
[26:07] balance you've got to preach and find
[26:08] thoughts with people but not make it
[26:10] personal
[26:11] you know why because when i'm like this
[26:13] i've got three fingers pointing back at
[26:14] me
[26:16] and if you follow me around enough i'm
[26:17] gonna make mistakes right
[26:20] so i i've gotta lay out false
[26:24] and brotherhood even says a preacher
[26:25] looks at what the people are lacking but
[26:27] man says and tells them to start there
[26:29] and give them what they can uh receive
[26:31] to help them
[26:32] he says start with their their weak
[26:34] points he says that's right
[26:36] preachers should be able to see the
[26:37] church and say how can we get more
[26:39] spiritual how can we
[26:40] improve our services praise god amen
[26:44] so the word teaches us
[26:47] it convinces us or convicts us
[26:50] finds our faults it corrects us which
[26:53] restores us to the right mindset
[26:56] and it gives us instruction to be more
[26:59] pure in our lives
[27:01] amen
[27:04] scripture does this now were you
[27:05] counting church that's like five that's
[27:08] four things i think in that scripture
[27:09] right
[27:10] uh doctrine reproof correction
[27:13] instruction yeah so there's four wars
[27:15] number deliverance earthly number praise
[27:16] god so scripture helps you in those four
[27:18] ways on earth that the man of god may be
[27:21] perfect or fitted
[27:23] so imagine a warrior with all the armor
[27:26] that fits
[27:27] not like david and saul whereas saul's
[27:29] like take my armor that didn't fit him
[27:31] amen what fit him was the sling praise
[27:34] god
[27:35] he knew how to use that by god's grace
[27:37] amen that's what fit him praise god and
[27:39] that's all he needed glory david was
[27:42] thoroughly furnished praise god unto the
[27:44] work of slain goliath amen
[27:48] he didn't need all the saul's fittings
[27:49] and off saw his clothing and saw his
[27:51] armor he didn't need all that
[27:53] denominational armor praise god he had
[27:55] the armor and the weapons that god had
[27:57] already proved to him amen god had
[27:59] already proved these are right he's
[28:01] learned how to use your praise god like
[28:03] the verse says continue david and what
[28:05] you've learned what you know that works
[28:07] david was assured the slain worth amen
[28:10] he see the word praise god and that's
[28:12] how we are denominationalism creed don't
[28:15] work but the living word of god works
[28:19] it changes lives amen
[28:22] amen it slays giants praise god it moves
[28:25] mountains praise god
[28:28] it brings down strongholds amen
[28:31] hallelujah
[28:33] here's some more complexes amen
[28:35] right
[28:38] takes away dissolves all of our doubts
[28:40] amen
[28:42] praise god amen
[28:45] see
[28:47] the scripture here makes us fitted
[28:52] truly that's an interesting word
[28:53] throughly used to be thoroughly but
[28:55] throughly furnished
[28:57] which means perfectly supplied to every
[29:00] good work
[29:01] so anything god wants me to do it the
[29:04] scripture i must first be taught the
[29:06] scripture of doctrine i must be shown my
[29:09] faults glory i must be restored to a
[29:11] right mind i must have a pure life and
[29:14] then if i've got all those praise god
[29:16] then i am fitted and i'm supplied to do
[29:19] every good thing god wants me to do
[29:21] praise god
[29:23] i'm invincible like that you're
[29:26] invincible if you let the scripture be
[29:29] your weapon and let it teach you correct
[29:31] you praise god believe it praise god let
[29:34] the scripture shape your life hallelujah
[29:37] amen amen
[29:39] [Music]
[29:40] i'm trying not to teach i'm trying to
[29:41] preach
[29:44] that's right so faith in the holy
[29:46] scriptures makes you mighty
[29:48] or wise unto salvation
[29:51] see makes you mighty not foolish as we
[29:55] heard this morning
[29:56] not o fools slow to believe why don't
[29:59] you believe the message why don't you
[30:00] believe the bible
[30:01] no we're wise we believe the bible
[30:04] praise god we've got faith in the word
[30:06] of god i believe when i open up the word
[30:08] of god god's gonna pour something out to
[30:10] me and give you understanding praise god
[30:12] amen hallelujah i believe if i keep
[30:14] preaching this we'll see more lives
[30:16] change for the good amen
[30:19] praise god more people will know jesus
[30:21] christ and him crucified if i just
[30:24] opened up this book and preached all
[30:26] that it says amen amen amen
[30:32] see it's faith
[30:34] in the holy scripture that's been
[30:35] revealed to us praise god hallelujah
[30:38] amen it makes us wise
[30:40] know that we can conquer
[30:42] jesus we can overcome yes
[30:45] we can win the battle
[30:48] we can finish the race amen
[30:50] we can win the war
[30:52] we can defeat the fires again
[30:55] we can be victorious amen amen
[30:58] hallelujah amen
[31:00] thank you jesus i love this those women
[31:02] were training them up from a child it's
[31:04] like they knew he was going to be a
[31:06] mighty man
[31:07] or you're not like other boys
[31:09] you're special
[31:10] like they said this morning we want to
[31:12] be special for god all right we're going
[31:13] to be used by god one of the wise
[31:15] virgins that's what i mean we're all
[31:16] special about it but god's grace
[31:19] but he trained him up put these
[31:20] scriptures in his heart
[31:22] well then paul says my i see
[31:24] i see the faith that's in you timothy i
[31:25] see it in your mother and your
[31:26] grandmother

[31:48] word of god amen
[31:50] it says everywhere you see it's all you

[32:04] anytime you need it you just pull it
[32:06] down and use it praise god amen it's

[32:29] i'm gonna have to take this with you
[32:30] that was a good one visible union that's
[32:31] a good one there praise god
[32:35] i may preach on that later by god's
[32:36] grace
[32:38] now
[32:39] to see faith in the scriptures now we'll
[32:40] look at different topics here
[32:42] and just give you some scriptures you
[32:43] can fight with i'll tell them hey man
[32:45] you know sometimes i get so busy just in
[32:47] my life and
[32:48] paying the bills and cleaning the house
[32:50] and
[32:52] doing up teaching and
[32:54] all i got to do all the things that i do
[32:55] is a man
[32:56] a family
[32:58] sometimes when trials come i actually
[32:59] forget to quote the word of god
[33:02] and like god has to have one of my kids
[33:03] encourage me or my wife or kind like
[33:05] wake me up that's right yeah i gotta
[33:06] fight here okay yeah you know
[33:09] i'm human praise god
[33:11] we all get busy and
[33:13] and i just reminded that this week that
[33:14] you know when tribes come or things what
[33:17] we need to do is write to the word of
[33:18] god
[33:19] praise god
[33:22] so see your faith will make you overcome
[33:24] uh will make you mighty to overcome fear
[33:28] and you can use these scriptures i was
[33:30] quoting this
[33:32] this morning while we were watching that
[33:33] video i didn't watch this video too much
[33:35] i was all nervous i was quoting this i
[33:36] said lord you're with me even though i
[33:38] walk through the valley of shadow of
[33:39] death you're with me i'll fear no evil
[33:41] yeah i'm all nervous who am i am i going
[33:43] to offend somebody am i going to i said
[33:45] lord you're with me right here praise me
[33:47] i was quoting that
[33:48] your rod and your staff you're coming so
[33:50] this is a scripture when we're afraid
[33:52] let the holy spirit bring this to our
[33:54] hearts
[33:55] yea though i walk through the valley of
[33:57] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[34:00] amen think about that you're in a valley
[34:03] right of the shadow of death so
[34:06] death is looming over you
[34:08] and death shadows upon you
[34:12] and david says even in that
[34:14] i won't be afraid praise god that takes
[34:16] some real anointing right there that guy
[34:18] was anointed man that's why he could say
[34:20] that praise god
[34:22] for thou art with me
[34:24] and i rod and thy stab they comfort so
[34:26] he's like a shepherd
[34:28] so dave recognizes i'm like a sheep
[34:30] praise god i'm in the valley but the
[34:33] shepherd's right here with me praise god
[34:35] that's why he's not afraid i can feel
[34:38] the shepherd's hand i can feel his step
[34:40] i can feel this rod i know he's right
[34:43] here with me praise god so there's no
[34:45] reason for me to fear my protectors here
[34:48] praise god i can overcome fear because
[34:50] jesus is here praise god
[34:52] amen
[34:55] it's a comfort to know
[34:57] where i can feel his ride in his staff

[35:01] gotta hold me back amen you gotta attack
[35:03] me on the back
[35:05] i'm gonna go a little slow
[35:06] that's a comfort to me where god keeps
[35:08] me alive right now amen
[35:12] so when we're afraid may the holy spirit
[35:14] bring us this i will fear no evil for
[35:16] thou art with me
[35:18] your rod and your staff they comfort me
[35:22] lord let your presence comfort me in the
[35:25] midst of the valley of shadow of fear
[35:27] the phrase
[35:28] in the midst of fear comfort me praise
[35:31] god so i forget about my fear and all i
[35:33] can think about is that he's with me
[35:36] i knew that david did praise god
[35:40] this one my mom taught me from a young
[35:41] age that god has not given us a spirit
[35:43] of fear
[35:44] god will not send you that box of
[35:46] rattlesnakes
[35:48] praise god
[35:49] god will not send that deliverer to
[35:51] knock on your door praise god god does
[35:53] not give the spirit of fear now he
[35:55] allows it praise god he allows those
[35:56] temptations to come but what he's trying
[35:58] to get inside your house praise god
[36:00] because after you hear the knock on the
[36:02] door he's trying to get power in there
[36:04] loving there and a sound line so that
[36:07] when you open the door and you see
[36:08] something fearful you'll be able to slam
[36:10] the door and you'll be able to dwell in
[36:12] your house in peace and safety and
[36:15] strength with no fear that's what god
[36:17] gives us not a spirit of fear but a
[36:19] spirit of power amen amen
[36:21] hallelujah amen
[36:24] thank god amen amen god didn't send this
[36:26] to me i don't have to have it praise god
[36:31] he didn't want this for me
[36:33] yesterday he tested me with it sure did
[36:35] but he already gave me the power to
[36:37] overcome it amen hallelujah amen why
[36:40] because he's with me
[36:42] amen
[36:43] wherever i walk the shepherd is with me
[36:48] he's got power he's got love he got a
[36:50] sound mind for me he has all these
[36:51] things for me if i'll just take them
[36:53] from them
[36:54] just receive his gifts praise god
[36:58] this one i was reading the scripture
[37:00] this was a blessing too
[37:03] faith in the holy scriptures make you
[37:04] mighty to overcome
[37:06] many afflictions
[37:08] and we were we were speaking a few
[37:10] months ago but amen
[37:11] seem like you've been through numerous
[37:12] affections
[37:14] just distresses right and this scripture
[37:16] just reminded me of you
[37:19] and this is what i think brother desmond
[37:20] bryant i think might have mentioned this
[37:21] one here about being contrite
[37:23] the lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[37:25] broken heart
[37:27] the church when you're broken god's not
[37:29] far from you god's right there with his
[37:31] man
[37:32] god sees you
[37:34] remember the bible said jesus won't even
[37:36] break a bruise read praise god
[37:39] we'll see like a plant that's got a
[37:40] broken leaf on it we'll just rip it off
[37:42] you know that's not jesus
[37:45] he won't even
[37:46] break a bruised reed
[37:49] be so gentle
[37:50] see
[37:51] so the lord is so close when our hearts
[37:53] are broken and he saves those who are of
[37:56] a contrite and a repentant spirit praise
[37:59] god
[37:59] amen so forgive me lord forgive me i'm
[38:02] broken i've sinned against you i've made
[38:04] some mistake
[38:05] i i've done wrong lord god forgive me
[38:08] i repent and right there the bible said
[38:11] god's right there with you praise god
[38:12] amen
[38:13] let me say like this whether you feel it
[38:15] or not the bible says the lord is praise
[38:18] god
[38:19] and all scripture is god breathed amen
[38:22] our scriptures inspired god's writing
[38:24] their church and we don't even see it
[38:26] but god opened our eyes so we can see
[38:28] the king is in the camp amen amen
[38:38] it says many are the distresses
[38:41] of who
[38:43] denominations
[38:46] the backsiders
[38:48] the workers of iniquity
[38:51] god lets the righteous
[38:53] go through many afflictions
[38:57] these are not related to sin this is
[38:58] just what god allows you to learn
[39:01] in other words god let us get distressed
[39:03] and it wasn't anything we did
[39:06] it was just god allowed it to test us
[39:10] say because look what's next
[39:13] many you have many distresses in this
[39:15] life but the lord delivers them out of
[39:18] some of them amen is that right no
[39:22] god delivers from all of them praise god
[39:26] until it's your time to go home god's
[39:28] gonna deliver you from all of them
[39:30] praise god
[39:30] [Applause]
[39:32] your distresses
[39:33] your times of
[39:34] uh of
[39:35] fear
[39:37] times are broken
[39:39] god's right
[39:40] there i say like this sometimes i think
[39:43] god has to break us that fellowship with
[39:44] us sometimes
[39:46] we get so busy
[39:48] maybe we're not talking to god like we
[39:50] ought to
[39:51] so sometimes god will have to break us
[39:53] just to have some fellowship with us
[39:59] where you really cry out to god lord i
[40:00] need you lord i gotta have something
[40:02] praise god it's life and death
[40:08] amen let's be honest
[40:11] what percentage of our prayers are 100
[40:12] percent sincere
[40:14] see we just it just is a cycle we go
[40:16] through it's normal it's a cycle
[40:18] right
[40:19] where we have to that's why paul said
[40:20] die daily in other words have revival
[40:22] every day
[40:24] at some point during the day we should
[40:25] pray a real sincere prayer
[40:29] if not it's just insincere
[40:33] and so perhaps god will allow us many
[40:35] distresses
[40:38] to show us
[40:39] that we need him praise god which will
[40:41] draw us closer to him and then i've
[40:43] tried remember brother
[40:46] and i said we'll just see just see
[40:48] try it
[40:50] see every
[40:51] that's how it comes across pulpits every
[40:53] time you're sick any problem just speak
[40:55] and speak it like it's going to go away
[40:56] but the bible says many are the
[40:58] afflictions
[41:00] and it's preached like you don't have to
[41:01] have any afflictions we're the bride
[41:03] you're the queen of heaven and you're
[41:04] perfect and all these things like that
[41:06] but the bible says
[41:08] the holy scripture says that i if i'm
[41:10] righteous i'm gonna have many distresses
[41:12] but that's okay it's gonna draw me
[41:14] closer to god god is actually closer to
[41:17] me praise god and then god will come
[41:19] around and deliver me from all my
[41:21] distresses
[41:23] amen you see that process i really
[41:25] believe that prosperity thing is
[41:26] slipping into the messes churches
[41:29] because you never hear about well what's
[41:30] god's will for the situation it's just
[41:32] like speaking speaking promises probably
[41:34] that's true
[41:38] but here the bible says many are the
[41:40] afflictions of the righteous
[41:41] but church god will deliver you out of
[41:43] them all amen
[41:45] let's say this together say god will
[41:46] deliver me ready god will deliver me
[41:48] from them all ready from them amen god
[41:51] will deliver you church
[41:53] from the lord hasn't he done it praise
[41:54] god
[41:55] has he done thus far praise god
[41:58] delivered us from our afflictions our
[42:00] mistakes oh yes our secret sins our
[42:03] presumption of senses from the jim great
[42:05] shot that was so beautiful masterpiece
[42:06] message yes
[42:08] we thought i would say it's like
[42:09] masterpiece theater here
[42:10] god sent us the best preachers to give
[42:12] us exactly right down to our lives it's
[42:14] beautiful
[42:16] the lord delivereth them out of them all
[42:18] praise god in other words you're a
[42:19] mighty man you're mighty women you get
[42:22] delivered you've overcome you don't lose
[42:24] you get victory you win praise god amen
[42:27] i win by the grace of god amen amen we
[42:30] have to fight
[42:31] there's going to be afflictions there's
[42:33] going to be distresses but i win
[42:36] because the lord is not to me
[42:39] i could have went on my own but somebody
[42:40] else greater than me is here praise
[42:43] hallelujah that's jesus
[42:46] revenge
[42:48] faith in the scriptures makes you
[42:49] overcome revenge
[42:52] well i'm going to get her back
[42:54] she said that way too loud
[43:00] dearly beloved avenge not yourself don't
[43:02] get back at people
[43:04] but rather give place unto wrath
[43:07] for it's written vengeance is mine i
[43:09] will obey
[43:12] god's the one who's going to pay
[43:13] somebody back
[43:15] you don't have to pay anybody back with
[43:16] evil
[43:19] god will pay them back with you
[43:22] therefore if your enemy hunger
[43:30] if he thirsts give him drink for in so
[43:33] doing thou shall keep coals of fire
[43:36] on his head it just
[43:38] according to the bible it just burns
[43:40] them up
[43:41] burns him up you know when i was a
[43:43] sinner i had a christian friend and he
[43:44] would always do good to me i'd laugh and
[43:46] make fun of him and that's what it did
[43:47] to me it kind of burned my head up
[43:49] because i knew i was wrong in other
[43:50] words conviction came upon me
[43:53] right when someone's good to you and
[43:55] you're not good to them
[43:57] that burns conviction on your head yeah
[44:00] praise god yeah
[44:02] my mom taught me this one too you
[44:04] haven't quoted as much as the uh spirit
[44:06] of fear but it's so true
[44:08] be not overcome of evil but overcome
[44:12] evil with good
[44:14] right god works all things to our good
[44:17] praise god and we should always be good
[44:20] to everybody praise the lord amen
[44:22] someone's done us wrong
[44:24] say i'm not going to pay them back god's
[44:26] going to pay them back
[44:28] but even like i pray church even as we
[44:30] pray for our politicians i pray first
[44:32] help them to repent of their murderous
[44:33] ways amen
[44:35] that's my first prayer
[44:37] and if they can't be saved then god
[44:38] bring them down
[44:40] but vengeance is mine the lord will
[44:42] repay
[44:44] praise god amen
[44:45] overcome evil with good
[44:48] faith in the holy scriptures makes you
[44:50] overcome lust
[44:52] right like jesus said lust of the eyes
[44:54] if you look on a woman you've already
[44:56] committed adultery with her already in
[44:58] your heart
[44:59] and look what he says here if your right
[45:01] eye offends it offensively pluck it out
[45:03] cast it from the for it's profitable for
[45:05] thee that one of thy members should
[45:08] perish and not thy whole body should be
[45:09] cast into hell
[45:11] what is scripture
[45:13] here's one i use a lot i will set no
[45:15] wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the
[45:17] work of them that turn aside it shall
[45:19] not cleave to me praise god amen that's
[45:22] not going to be a part of me that's not
[45:23] going to be bothering me that weight is
[45:25] not going to be on me praise god but
[45:27] i'll do like paul said in hebrews 12.
[45:29] i'll lay aside these weights amen we'll
[45:32] lay aside the weights that easily
[45:34] present us and run the race with
[45:35] perseverance amen amen
[45:39] these are scriptures we need to quote
[45:41] scriptures i'll set the wicked thing
[45:43] before my eyes
[45:44] my heart will be pure i didn't put this
[45:46] one on there but jesus said blessed are
[45:48] the pure in heart for they shall see god
[45:51] how many want to see god
[45:53] i want to see him on the good side
[45:54] praise god i don't see him with mercy
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] and so that's the scripture lord created
[46:01] i love that one too psalm 51 created me
[46:03] a clean heart
[46:04] i'll just play that song
[46:06] i just go because when i come before the
[46:08] lord and i failed or something i just
[46:10] but psalm 51 created me a clean heart
[46:13] right because we all have we all have
[46:15] ink uh unclean hearts at times right
[46:17] sure
[46:18] that's been a great scripture i wish you
[46:19] would put that one on there but that's
[46:20] been a real help to me created me a
[46:22] clean art you know what god does it

[46:32] impatience that's right when you've got
[46:34] to have something now

[46:49] for him that waiteth for him
[46:52] amen
[46:54] man can't hear it man can't see it man

[46:59] for those who are waiting now on god to
[47:02] fulfill his word amen amen hallelujah
[47:05] amen amen
[47:07] you can't imagine
[47:08] it and we'd like to talk about it praise
[47:11] god
[47:12] we know he'll do exceedingly abundantly
[47:14] but none of us can even come close to
[47:16] imagining what god is going to do as we
[47:19] wait upon his coming praise god
[47:22] it is so great
[47:26] it hasn't entered into man's mind
[47:28] we can't see it with our eyes we can't
[47:30] hear it like
[47:32] that sermon really laid out what god's
[47:33] going to do
[47:34] you won't do it
[47:37] it's something god has put deep in his
[47:39] heart praise god yes it's something god
[47:41] has saved hallelujah for the right time
[47:44] in season amen
[47:46] like brother i'm trying to explain about

[47:49] of that table will be miles long
[47:51] and we'll look across the table in the
[47:53] saints we neighborhood will be sitting

[47:58] see all the heroes of the faith praise
[48:00] god like the hymn of heaven we see the
[48:02] heroes of the faith and then jesus will
[48:04] come and give us communion
[48:07] he'll step out and he'll start serving
[48:09] communion if you imagine the bread
[48:11] and the wine
[48:13] he'll start serving us like we try to
[48:16] hear it we try to see it we try to
[48:18] imagine it but church is going to be
[48:20] beyond that
[48:22] she said i will not drink this wine
[48:25] or this cup with you until i drink a new
[48:28] in my father's kingdom
[48:30] you imagine he's waiting two thousand
[48:31] years now time does nothing to jesus but
[48:33] he's waiting 2 000 years to drink of
[48:34] that communion

[48:38] until
[48:40] i'm in my father's kingdom with my
[48:42] people

[49:10] word come to pass i'm just speaking his
[49:11] word i'm just believing it i'm just
[49:13] applying it to my daily life praise god
[49:15] and it's making me wise under the
[49:17] rapture praise god amen amen amen
[49:21] either way i'm waiting
[49:23] i'm not trying to be a prophet i'm not
[49:25] trying to be something i'm not i'm
[49:27] waiting on god i'm being i'm being
[49:30] assured i'm learning the things that i
[49:32] need to do and be assured of praise god

[49:39] need in order to be ready for the coming
[49:41] of the lord praise god and it's assuring
[49:43] me a certain future with christ amen
[49:45] amen
[49:47] lord
[49:49] oh my see when i preach like this i wear
[49:50] on my voice faster
[49:52] that's why sometimes it's easier to
[49:53] teach
[49:55] but then wait upon the lord shall renew
[49:57] their strength amen they shall mount it
[49:59] with wigs as eagles that's right they
[50:02] shall run and not be weary oh yes
[50:05] they shall walk and not be faked
[50:07] see one time the pastor asked me he said
[50:09] have you ever felt like quitting i said
[50:11] well one time and then god sent me
[50:12] brother amen and sisterhood you know and
[50:14] then

[50:44] i know he's worth waiting for praise god
[50:47] amen amen
[50:51] and remember we read this a few weeks
[50:53] ago the eyes of the lord run to and fro
[50:55] he's trying to find the mighty man
[50:57] his eyes are going all over the earth
[51:01] all around the sphere of the earth
[51:03] to show himself strong in behalf of them
[51:07] whose heart is perfect that means that
[51:09] peace
[51:10] god's looking for somebody who has peace
[51:12] in their heart
[51:14] that he can show his strength in
[51:16] that's what he's looking for today
[51:19] lord help my heart to be at peace tell
[51:21] me not to be moved by events that happen

[51:47] your faith in the scriptures will make
[51:48] you mighty to overcome
[51:50] any insufficiency of your basic needs
[51:53] just to just have faith in god's word
[51:56] just have faith in the holy scriptures
[51:57] how do you believe that
[52:00] paul says i know how to be a base i know
[52:02] how to be humbled and i know how to have
[52:04] increase with finances
[52:06] i know how that little much
[52:08] everywhere in all things i'm instructed
[52:10] both to be full and to be hungry so
[52:12] there's times god will struck me this is
[52:14] a time of less
[52:16] you're not going to eat as much
[52:17] this is a time you're going to have to
[52:18] be full and have plenty of food
[52:21] both to abound here you're having a
[52:23] season of increase but then you're going
[52:25] to have a season to suffer
[52:30] now why aren't the prosperity people
[52:31] preaching this
[52:33] you see what i'm saying they just
[52:35] they only take
[52:36] they only take this and they apply it to
[52:38] a football game or they apply to the
[52:40] stock market
[52:42] they don't apply it to it's actually
[52:44] written to help people who don't have
[52:46] enough food
[52:48] we don't have enough clothes
[52:50] that's what it's actually written for in
[52:52] other words i can make it with less
[52:54] because christ is in me he's mighty in
[52:57] me praise god
[53:00] that's what it's actually for
[53:04] but it's used the wrong way
[53:07] so i told you this in football we'd
[53:08] always write this we write philippians 4
[53:10] 13 on our wristbands
[53:12] yeah i can do anything i can score
[53:13] touchdowns i can tackle people
[53:15] ridiculous
[53:17] and then i mix it up i'd be like is it 3
[53:19] 14 or 4 13. i'd be like that every
[53:22] friday what one is that where's it at
[53:23] the bible i can't find that i'll just do
[53:25] 4 13 or i'll just do 3 14. we were so
[53:27] carmen
[53:28] we wanted god's blessing but we didn't
[53:30] want to love god we didn't want to keep
[53:31] his commands
[53:34] right
[53:36] now when you go down further six verses
[53:37] later i love this
[53:40] church when you have less or you have
[53:42] little this is the scripture to quote my
[53:44] god
[53:45] not another god
[53:47] my god shall supply all my needs
[53:51] praise god
[53:52] according to his riches in glory by
[53:56] christ jesus
[53:57] amen
[53:59] my god will supply whatever i have need
[54:01] of
[54:04] you know i was listening to a podcast
[54:05] last week
[54:06] and talked about the famines in africa
[54:08] which we've we've sent some relief
[54:12] and a a a
[54:13] listener wrote in and said is god cursed
[54:15] africa
[54:16] the preacher is like no
[54:18] it's just a season i know that was a
[54:20] good answer
[54:21] because he says look at europe and
[54:23] africa from just a hundred years ago
[54:26] it was flip flop europe had famines and
[54:28] diseases
[54:31] but yet their church was on fire mm-hmm
[54:33] john wesley yeah 100 so now it's
[54:36] 300.
[54:37] okay sorry
[54:38] now it's flipped
[54:41] europe has no revival at all
[54:44] they hardly have any churches there
[54:47] they're spiritually dead but yet africa
[54:49] their numbers are rising all the time
[54:53] yet with family yet with less yet with
[54:55] struggles
[54:57] see that's true
[54:59] so the natural thing with paul his
[55:01] natural needs whether he had food or not
[55:03] wasn't an indicator of how he was close
[55:05] to god or not it was a season of tests
[55:08] it was showing him that the strength of
[55:10] christ is perfect in every situation
[55:12] amen amen
[55:14] hallelujah amen
[55:16] whether you have little oh yes or
[55:17] whether you have much
[55:21] i thought that was one of the wisest
[55:23] answers i've heard in a long time
[55:25] which one would you rather be in a dead
[55:27] place where you have all this kind of
[55:28] food with no revival or would you be in
[55:30] a place where they're suffering but
[55:31] there's revival
[55:40] and your stomach hurts waiting on god to
[55:43] supply food all right that's real that's
[55:45] real revival right there praise god
[55:47] because that's what paul had praise god
[55:49] amen
[55:50] there's going to be seasons where i've
[55:51] got food seasons where i have less
[55:54] but i can do all things through christ
[55:57] who strengthens me praise god
[56:00] that's real faith church amen
[56:02] that's real faith
[56:05] and these scriptures church will make
[56:06] you wise unto salvation amen
[56:10] or wise when you struggle or when you
[56:12] suffer or you have hard times
[56:14] these scriptures will make you wise in
[56:16] the difficult times
[56:17] it'll prepare you for heaven that's what
[56:19] i'm saying amen
[56:21] to prepare you for those pearly gates
[56:23] amen to the streets of gold and the
[56:25] transparent city it'll prepare you to
[56:27] live in that holy city because for god
[56:30] all things are possible and my god will
[56:32] give you everything you need praise god
[56:35] if you didn't give it then it wasn't it
[56:37] wasn't god's will then
[56:39] but he's going to give you everything
[56:40] that you have need of amen praise god
[56:44] everything i need of my god shall supply
[56:47] and breathe

[59:13] or a couple weeks ago
[59:14] i preached about mighty men the next day
[59:16] i'm complaining about inflation
[59:19] i felt like the holy spirit said you
[59:20] fool
[59:21] you just preach something mighty man
[59:22] that's right and i'd ask god for you
[59:26] that's a shame church i'm ashamed i'm
[59:28] still ashamed of that
[59:29] i gotta give up a few uh luxuries in
[59:32] life
[59:34] i felt like the holy spirit rebuked me
[59:36] on that that's foolish don't complain
[59:38] about that
[59:40] humble yourself and that's what i found
[59:42] i found god humbling me amen and that's
[59:45] not a bad thing that's a good thing
[59:48] in other words mr beatrice i know how to
[59:50] be a base

[59:57] oh god
[59:58] send a bonding blessing send the
[1:00:00] increase
[1:00:01] but there's times where god's not going
[1:00:03] to send the abound
[1:00:04] it's going to be a season of a base
[1:00:12] so he's going to let he's going to let
[1:00:13] you
[1:00:14] lack some things he's going to say just
[1:00:16] be content so that we may boldly say the
[1:00:19] lord is my helper amen
[1:00:21] i will not fear what man shall do
[1:00:24] so man is affecting things that you
[1:00:26] don't have like like today
[1:00:28] our president and
[1:00:30] all the government you know they're
[1:00:31] affecting through inflation things that
[1:00:33] we don't have but we don't complain
[1:00:35] we're content and say the lord is my
[1:00:37] helper i will not fear what man or
[1:00:40] governments will do to me amen is that
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:44] i'm giving you scripture church i need
[1:00:45] these scriptures praise god i'm giving
[1:00:47] them to you because i'm the one who
[1:00:48] needs them too we all need them anyway
[1:00:51] when we're insufficient when we lust
[1:00:53] when we have fear right when we have all
[1:00:55] these issues there's scriptures we can
[1:00:57] go to
[1:00:58] there's certain weapons we can take out
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:01] of our armory praise god and take him
[1:01:04] and fight the enemy and drive him back
[1:01:06] and say i will conquer in jesus name
[1:01:08] praise god amen
[1:01:13] thank you jesus amen glory

[1:01:25] i feel like
[1:01:26] god don't care about me god doesn't care
[1:01:28] about me
[1:01:30] humble yourselves therefore to the
[1:01:32] mighty hand of god that he may exalt you
[1:01:34] in due time casting all your care on him
[1:01:37] for he cares for you amen
[1:01:39] do you feel like no god doesn't see me
[1:01:42] no peter says god does care for you
[1:01:44] that's right
[1:01:45] if it feels like he's not it's because
[1:01:46] he's trying to humble you
[1:01:49] humble yourself remember you've got to
[1:01:50] make that choice
[1:01:51] god can make the situations come to your
[1:01:53] life
[1:01:54] but you can either choose to be prideful
[1:01:55] in those situations or you can accept
[1:01:57] the humility
[1:01:58] humble yourself that's something god
[1:02:00] can't do god can bring you to a
[1:02:02] situation where he wants you to be
[1:02:03] humble but he can't force you to be
[1:02:04] humble we've got to humble ourselves
[1:02:07] that's right
[1:02:08] because he cares for us
[1:02:11] he's going to allow many distresses
[1:02:12] brother austin
[1:02:14] lydia he's going to give us many
[1:02:15] afflictions

[1:03:23] he'd have to delete these out of the
[1:03:24] bible thank god it's not a digital bible

[1:03:29] to somehow take invisible ink and just

[1:06:30] church why do we have one heart here how
[1:06:32] come we don't have divisions here we're
[1:06:33] arguing and fussing and people want to
[1:06:35] have a different pastor why don't we
[1:06:36] have division here because
[1:06:38] god's with you
[1:06:40] because this god is doing you good so
[1:06:43] most churches have divisions in fights
[1:06:45] like that right
[1:06:46] now you stop if you want to talk to
[1:06:48] somebody about that talk to brother jim
[1:06:49] about that

[1:06:57] love of jesus christ
[1:07:00] see god you see we have one heart here
[1:07:02] why for
[1:07:03] the good of us
[1:07:06] we have one heart so we'll be a real
[1:07:09] example of christianity this is what a
[1:07:11] unified church looks like that's right
[1:07:14] we're not divided like that song says
[1:07:16] we're not divided all one body we one in
[1:07:19] hope and doctrine one in charity amen
[1:07:22] our christian soldiers amen

[1:07:38] it's easy and when it's hard who's going
[1:07:39] to do it
[1:07:41] i like doing it i thank god i can do it
[1:07:43] but it's for us and our children that's
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:47] if there's another generation
[1:07:50] and i'll make an everlasting covenant
[1:07:51] with them that i will not turn away from
[1:07:54] them
[1:07:55] to do them good that's right but i'll
[1:07:57] put my fear in their hearts
[1:07:59] that they shall not depart from it so

[1:14:29] whole heart and soul he did it with the
[1:14:31] soul of jesus christ
[1:14:34] praise god amen so god said to my soul
[1:14:37] i'll place the jews back but he said to
[1:14:39] to redeem the gentile bride he said i'll
[1:14:41] give my son soul as an offering for sin
[1:14:44] that's right
[1:14:46] jesus christ he gave the soul
[1:14:49] for you and i in other words he gave
[1:14:51] everything he had oh my
[1:14:53] god didn't spare any of his strength
[1:14:54] amen god didn't spare any of his love
[1:14:57] god did not spare anything when he
[1:14:59] brought you to himself when he wanted to
[1:15:01] show you his covenant and his promises
[1:15:03] he spared no expense he gave the
[1:15:05] greatest thing you could do the son i
[1:15:07] saw the soul of his son he offered that
[1:15:09] as a sacrifice for your sins that's how
[1:15:12] much god loves you praise god amen amen
[1:15:18] it pleased the lord to bruise his son
[1:15:21] he hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[1:15:23] make his soul an offering for sin
[1:15:26] but jesus would see his seed his
[1:15:28] spiritual offspring
[1:15:30] verse 11 he shall see the travail of his
[1:15:32] soul and shall be satisfied god saw
[1:15:34] jesus on the cross that satisfied his
[1:15:36] wrath
[1:15:37] by his knowledge on my righteous servant
[1:15:39] he'll justify many that means declare
[1:15:41] you righteous amen amen
[1:15:43] even though
[1:15:44] you did everything wrong and jesus did
[1:15:45] nothing wrong
[1:15:46] it's a perfect substitution the divine
[1:15:50] substitution my servant my son because
[1:15:53] he made his soul offering for sin he
[1:15:55] gave his own soul as offering for sin he
[1:15:57] shall justify many people amen
[1:16:00] for he shall bear their iniquities
[1:16:03] jesus took the punishment of your
[1:16:05] iniquities
[1:16:08] your lawlessness
[1:16:10] jesus paid for our lawlessness
[1:16:14] and he paid for with all of his soul
[1:16:17] and the church said
[1:16:18] amen god just don't leave these verses
[1:16:21] in here for another there's something to
[1:16:22] it
[1:16:23] he gave that's that's why paul said i
[1:16:25] wish i could be cursed that my brother
[1:16:26] might be saying same thing substitution
[1:16:28] there it is right there right
[1:16:30] substitution
[1:16:31] i wish they could take my place and i
[1:16:33] could take their place
[1:16:36] he so loved them he wished i could give
[1:16:37] my soul that's exactly what jesus did
[1:16:39] because he so loved the world he gave
[1:16:41] his soul as an offering for sin praise
[1:16:43] god oh no better sacrifice can be made
[1:16:46] amen than the sweet sinless soul of
[1:16:48] jesus christ the holy soul jesus being
[1:16:50] offered as a sacrifice for you and i and
[1:16:52] now he's justified you he took your
[1:16:54] iniquities away he's released your sins
[1:16:57] your pardon you're forgiven
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:04] amen so you could be a mighty woman
[1:17:06] today
[1:17:08] and not let these temptations make you
[1:17:10] fall
[1:17:12] to make you a mighty man
[1:17:14] where you can go through the most
[1:17:15] difficult seasons of your life
[1:17:17] and still say i can make it through this
[1:17:19] season because i can do all things i can
[1:17:22] make it through all seasons through
[1:17:23] christ who strengthens
[1:17:24] your name
[1:17:26] praise
[1:17:29] i'm god
[1:17:30] done i think
[1:17:32] i just get lost in heavenly places don't
[1:17:33] even ask me what time it is
[1:17:36] oh my lord have mercy
[1:17:39] i thought there's no way this would even
[1:17:41] take me half an hour to preach right
[1:17:42] there's the holy spirit
[1:17:45] i'll close with this one
[1:17:47] we'll close this and i'll maybe preach
[1:17:49] it wednesday we'll kind of see how the
[1:17:50] lord directs i would like to finish that
[1:17:52] son of man son of god son david
[1:17:55] oh yeah i'm sorry here's more about our
[1:17:57] covenant now the god of peace that
[1:17:58] brought again the dead from the dead our
[1:18:00] lord jesus that great shepherd and the
[1:18:01] sheep through the blood of the
[1:18:02] everlasting covenant what does this
[1:18:03] covenant do it makes you perfect in
[1:18:05] every good work amen to do his will in
[1:18:08] other words god wants you to do the
[1:18:09] perfect will of god the blood of christ
[1:18:11] made a way for it
[1:18:13] think about that you don't have to slip
[1:18:14] into the permissible of god like jonah
[1:18:18] right
[1:18:18] you don't have to do that like like
[1:18:20] moses moses missed out on the prophet
[1:18:22] because of his pride
[1:18:24] and anger and rebellion we don't have to
[1:18:26] do that because our covenant is a
[1:18:28] greater covenant
[1:18:32] the blood makes you perfect in every
[1:18:33] good work to do god's will
[1:18:35] work it in you that which is well
[1:18:37] pleasing insight through jesus christ to
[1:18:39] whom we glory forever and ever amen amen
[1:18:46] there's a reason i'm going through these
[1:18:47] here
[1:18:49] well you know what where am i okay
[1:18:54] romans 4 6
[1:18:56] are we still in god knows where i am
[1:18:59] yeah yeah when i feel unseen by god okay
[1:19:01] i put these in here for a purpose when
[1:19:02] you feel unseen by god the bible says
[1:19:05] even as david describes the blessedness
[1:19:06] of this man whom unto whom god imputeth
[1:19:09] righteousness without works
[1:19:11] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:19:13] are forgiven whose sins are covered
[1:19:16] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:19:17] not impute sin
[1:19:22] we want to be blessed church on this
[1:19:23] life but really the greatest blessing we
[1:19:24] can have is for the holy spirit to say
[1:19:27] william
[1:19:28] i'm not imputing your sin unto you amen
[1:19:31] that'd be the greatest blessing we could
[1:19:32] have amen in this earth amen
[1:19:34] i will not impute your sin unto you amen
[1:19:37] i will remit it amen praise god amen
[1:19:40] that's the greatest blessing i could
[1:19:41] have amen amen
[1:19:43] without works without works yes
[1:19:46] you're justified and forgiven without
[1:19:48] any words amen it's a gift of grace
[1:19:51] praise god
[1:19:54] and he received the sign of circumcision
[1:19:56] a seal of the righteousness of the faith
[1:19:58] which he had yet being uncircumcised in
[1:20:01] other words this faith was already
[1:20:02] inside of him but time was going to
[1:20:04] bring it out amen amen in other words i
[1:20:06] wanted for 19 years i got done this
[1:20:08] morning oh but after that 19th year oh
[1:20:11] the holy spirit started to deal with me
[1:20:12] and the faith that was set was in there
[1:20:15] the whole time and finally come out the
[1:20:17] the light of the sun finally shone on it
[1:20:20] the waters of the spirit finally fell on
[1:20:22] it and now the righteousness that i
[1:20:23] always had now it can be seen by others
[1:20:26] praise god amen
[1:20:27] same thing for you
[1:20:29] you couldn't come forth till the right
[1:20:30] time in season that righteousness was
[1:20:33] always inside you i know you were
[1:20:34] walking to church in the snow man
[1:20:36] this guy was
[1:20:38] walking alone to church in the snow
[1:20:41] hallelujah
[1:20:43] yeah i i can see the righteous of god in
[1:20:44] you
[1:20:47] each one of us it manifested at
[1:20:49] different times
[1:20:51] but that righteousness was already in
[1:20:52] you the whole time
[1:20:54] that that potential
[1:20:56] the potential to serve god that's right
[1:21:00] and the bible says
[1:21:03] you had it yet being uncircumcised like
[1:21:06] like abraham he hadn't had the covenant
[1:21:08] yet but yet god saw god foresaw god knew
[1:21:10] you would accept it
[1:21:12] that abraham might be the father of all
[1:21:14] them that believe though they not yet be
[1:21:16] circumcised that that righteousness
[1:21:18] might be imputed unto them also speaking
[1:21:21] to the gentiles yes
[1:21:23] just as abraham already had this
[1:21:25] righteousness before the covenant came
[1:21:27] so did you you already had the
[1:21:28] righteousness it just you didn't know
[1:21:30] about it yet until the word of god came
[1:21:31] to you amen
[1:21:34] because faith comes by hearing
[1:21:36] hearing by the word of god
