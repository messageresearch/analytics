this morning amen amen believe we're gonna do a baby dedication here by God's grace I think the Graham family like to dedicate baby Leah so we're gonna take a moment and have a little dedication or prayer by the grace of the Lord I was looking up the scripture real quick our dedication scripture generally it's Luke 18 15 so I'll read it by God's grace is says and they brought unto Him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God amen praise God well so we'll invite the Graham family if they'll just come up here by the grace of Lord we'll just have a dedication or prayer and dedicate Leah's life to the Lord amen is less than with another fruit of their union here baby Leah very thankful what's her memories are very thankful God has been gracious especially with all those treatments this release has got as God to go through God has been with her strengthening her and keeping her helping brother John and the family really do a wonderful job by the grace of the Lord so I'd like to dedicate her now and she's gonna hand her to me here I've tried to be very gentle six babies of my own so I tried to be very careful great job passers get to do - beautiful that's just how work prayer Heavenly Father Lord I hold in my hands Lord this fruit to the Union our brother John and sister Lisa Lord thank you for their family thank you for their lives thank you for their testimony Lord Jesus they love you Lord God

believe nothing doubting it shall be given so bless the life of this beautiful child Lord let the family continue to grow in grace and knowledge of you Lord as this child Lord is the love of the home your prophet said bringing so much joy to the home Lord God let the joy of the Holy Spirit or you yeah maybe a song too [Music] so as as you all know John I have a mismatch in our platelets it's kind of like the the the red blood cell disorder where they have to give the rhogam shot so with our platelets mismatching whenever our children are conceived if they are have John's blood my body rejects it and thinks it's like a foreign cancer and tries to kill off the platelets so thankfully before two months before Hannah I had needed to receive treatment with Hannah so she was 18 18 weeks in the womb they came out with our treatment protocol from New York and they said that what I needed to do was go through transfusions starting at 20 weeks clear until 37 weeks and then I would deliver by c-section so Hannah okay and I didn't know what to expect about God was gracious and helped us to get through that whenever we then were pregnant with Ava I knew what to expect and honestly I had severe anxiety knowing what was coming and what hard things I was going to have to endure so being pregnant for me is not really a joy um I can kind of say that kind of humbly I wish it was but it's really really hard and the life is a joy but going through it is not I wish it was so when I see many moms so happy it's hard for me because I don't feel I think joy a lot because the suffering that you have to go through and just to put it in perspective just imagine if all week long you felt awful like as terrible headache and aching all throughout your body and then you feel good for one day and then you go back to that that's how the pregnancy is many times I couldn't get out of bed right directly because the varicose veins that I have I'd have to get a bed and actually just fall to the ground and crawl because the pain in my legs would be so bit unbearable but God was gracious with the I didn't have so much of that and I was I had more wisdom to and was able to do some supplements and hose and that would compress my legs and help me quite a bit so he's very thing for that but when I was having the hardest time with Ava and I was just crying on the way to treatment and I'm like Laura I don't want go through this again and I had like I don't know like seven or eight weeks left and just crying in the car because I'd have to leave my family like at 3 p.m. in the afternoon I wouldn't see them till the next day because I had good treatments overnight was like 15 hours of treatment the Lord brought a song to me over the radio and it was by a carry job and it says I am NOT alone and that just became my song for Ava that I don't I was starting to feel very very overwhelmed I just started seeing that song I am NOT alone you will go before me and you will never leave me and I would just sing that song because that kind of became my song with with Eve I would just sing that whenever I feel very overwhelmed very overcome with grief at the pain I'm just gonna have to go through of course they wouldn't even she was just such a joy and pleasantly just Pleasant so I knew what with Leah the same thing would happen and so though my prayer for this pregnant for her and for that pregnancy was that I wouldn't have to go to the transfusions again he saw it fit that I would I would go through that again and he also gave me another song with her I just kind of praise the Lord other song I need something else to encourage me in this battle because it's really hard when there's no other believers that you know that I've gone through this you can't relate and talk to many people because there's no believers that I know who has had to go through this like we've had and I said Lord I know I'm not alone no you're with me I know that you're gonna bring me through this like you brought me through it with everyone I wish you would take this pain away I wish I would have to go through it and the Lord gave me this song and I just I feel I feel like I need to sing it it's by Natalie grant it says it's more than anything so you can look it up and listen to it read it yourself I know if you want to you could wave your hand spare me this heartache and change your plan I know when you said that you could take my pain away but even if you don't pray tell me what the healer more than healing help me want to save you're more than saving tell me what the giver more than giving Oh help me want you cheese's more than anything you know more than anyone that my flesh is weak and you know I give anything for a remedy I'll ask a thousand more times to set me free to day hey but even if you don't I pray he help me want the healer more than healing help me want to save you're more than saving how me want the giver more than giving oh how me want you Jesus more than anything oh how me want you cheese more than anything [Applause] appreciate the testimonies and the songs and how many know God is so faithful praise the Lord thankful for God's faithfulness let's stand our feet here I will just sing a song and get into the Word of God we have of course a fellowship right afterwards a carrion everybody's welcome to stay I just want to make sure I thank the mothers and everybody who cooked by God's grace sometimes they go unnoticed and unthanked but if you bought food or made food we just want to say thank you by God's grace thank you for all the work you do we really appreciate that by the grace of the Lord amen praise God let's sing that song I give myself away no we'll get right into the Word of God I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can hear I am oh here I am here I stand Lord my life is in your hands Lord I'm longing to see your desires review in me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away hey I give myself away so you take my heart we'll take my heart my life as a living sacrifice oh my dreams are my plants lord I place them in your hands I give myself away I give myself away so you can't use me I give myself away [Music] I give myself away so you and use me a man prays now let's take our Bibles this morning and ascend our feet I just want to read one scripture sort of 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 I like to take a different thought this morning we've been dealing with the church ages would like to take a different dot and look at the spirit of fear this morning the spirit of fear 2nd Timothy 1 verse 7 kind of had this thought on my heart for a while I'm just kind of waiting on the Lord and I just feel like I should preach it this morning praise the Lord 2nd Timothy 1:7 2nd Timothy 1:7 let's read this if we can together 1 2 3 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind you ever need on your heart let's make it known to Lord let's bow our heads as we pray Heavenly Father Lord we love you Jesus we give ourselves away Lord God take our lives our plans our dreams our ambitions Lord let us be a living sacrifice Lord God unto thee thank you for the songs Lord from the saints the testimonies we appreciate that the little dedication Lord God how wonderful you are how real you are to us Lord God and we thank you for your constant presence in our lives Lord you promised to be with us to the end of the age and you've kept your promise Lord God how gracious you are how we love you Lord God how we can sing your praises Lord God with a pure heart with the thankful heart Lord bless this reading of thy word Lord as we look at the spirit of fear and dear God I just pray you give us grace to get out of your way completely that you might be completely glorified and Lord you're accomplished or your purpose this morning would be completely accomplished Lord God as we want to yield to thy spirit Lord we thank you for your love and mercy and your grace and thy sweet presence we give you glory in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless use me and see you there praise the Lord I want to thank the Lord again for our visitors we have sister Helen with us and brother Johnny and sister Sarah and their family [Applause] it's great to have fellowship with the Saints and look forward to our fellowship afterwards by the grace of the Lord I've had this thought of the spirit of fear on my heart for a few weeks now and just kind of waiting on the Lord for the right timing and yesterday's I studied I just kind of felt like I got into a little channel this is a huge subject as you know fear has over 700 scriptures in the Bible on fear and afraid so I didn't touch the surface of those what I did is I spent most of my time going through quotes about fear and faith and perfect love casting out all fear and scriptures about fear I'm sorry in quotes about fear and the greatness of the challenge of fear so I want to look at those this morning and just ask God to guide me and as you know your faith will determine the direction of the service amen how many know that by God's grace no one ever leaves here disappointed when they pull on the Lord you know so we don't pull on a man we pulled on the Lord the Holy Spirit as the Holy Spirit works through the man amen so we like to look at this thought here that God gives not the spirit of fear the word fear and Webster's means frighten it means to expect with alarm fear to expect alarm to be timid so that's what fear means it's a frightening it's afraid to expect an alarm to expect something bad to happen that's fear in the in the Webster's now the definition we appreciate is to have a reverential awe of God that's the definition that we live by because the whole duty of man is to what fear God and keep his commands that's the whole duty of man but the RAM says that and the book of Ecclesiastes says that Solomon says that in chapter 12 that's the whole duty of man is to fear God and keep his Commandments we must have a reverence toward the Lord Jesus Christ amen and God and so we know there's many kinds of fear if you do a google search and look up phobias one article said there's 322 phobias that are medically listed one of them is a fear of preaching which I thought was kind of funny number the fifth top fear is claustrophobia you know being in a tight space the number one fear did you know anybody know it is arachnophobia the fear of spiders they know that that is the number one fear at least medically proven clinically you know arachnophobia interesting but there's many kinds of fears and we all can relate to fear whether it's the good fear of God or the bad fear battling fear and so we want to take a few scriptures and look at this thought I'm just going to hit the top of it and I felt led to go down one vein I kind of found a quote some series of quotes I kind of liked I think I'll just go down that vein by the grace of the Lord with godly fear we know it's comanded right and we know it has great advantages advantages because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a person can't even have any wisdom in God until they first have a reverential awe of God in his power and that's why God created nature that's what the Bible says God created nature for signs and seasons and that people would stand in awe of his creation and his majesty and they'd have to realize there's something greater than me there's something greater than humanity and reverential fear is a great advantage and I would go as far as saying that our fear many times should make us tremble before God because the Bible says we should work out our own salvation with fear and trembling I believe there is a spiritual holy fear that when it comes to the believer it's a reverent fear of God's holiness and it causes us to fear God and also tremble at his presence we've all heard I've seen people tremble at rock-and-roll stars or actors and actresses and people shake when they get to meet their most famous athlete or something like that that's the wrong kind of fear Amen s it's they ought to have that kind of Revere and respect for God Almighty that's a perverted fear but we ought to have that fear because the Bible said even demons believe and tremble at God's Word so sinners and unbelievers and make believers that have this perverted fear that that fear things a man more than God have a perverted fear and they need to understand the fear of the Lord aren't you glad you have the fear of the Lord aren't you glad when you came to Christ you respected him you had great reverence toward him you you knew that he has power as Jesus said don't fear a man that has can take away your body but jesus said fear God who has power over the body and soul and can destroy the body and soul in hell I mean you know that scripture in Matthew chapter 10 thank God that we had that fear that we know God is my Creator and and God is ultimately in control my life all of my steps are ordered of the Lord and God brought me in my life to this situation for a purpose God is not the author of confusion God didn't bring a event in your life to confuse you he brought an event in your life to perfect.you amen glory to get you to need him as I was thinking on the drive over here I was thinking of how the Bible said Jesus had a need to go by Samaria he had a need to go by and bring freedom to the woman at the well but she needed to go through five husbands and living with one she needed to go through this immoral life in order to see her need for a savior amen there's something about her life that she had to go through that we No maybe all the reasons God will explain it and we're sure that God will explain it one day in heaven amen for program said that's what the hidden manna is brother Branham said that the hidden manna he said is Jesus answering all of our unanswered questions for ages an attorney to come he said that's the hidden manna he reveals it to us in a private personal way just like the manna was hidden in the Ark of the Covenant praise God under the mercy seat so one day he'll show us all the reasons but we trust God and we know that God is in control and we fear God he's so great and we reverence his power in his glory amen and we want to look at just real quickly first John 4:18 we read 2nd Timothy 1:7 how God does not give the spirit of fear God doesn't send the spirit of fear to anyone God doesn't want anyone to live in fear and as our sister said anxiety that's another good word no we wouldn't hear more common today you don't say well I have a fear attack I have a anxiety attack and and if people battle anxiety that's no different than somebody struggling with cigarettes or any other thing it's a it's a battle they must overcome we that's what we are ultimately at the end what are we Church we are overcomers we're conquerors that's all Christ asked us to be is overcome and conquer whatever trials he and his wisdom allows to come into our lives that's all we have to do is overcome what he's placed in my life he never allowed homelessness or to come into my life or he never allowed different things to come into my life but what he has allowed to come into my life he's asked me to take his grace and his power and overcome that amen and so that's how it is for your life God has orchestrated those events in your life and allowed you the grace to be an overcomer and the Bible said in Revelation 21 that if you overcome you inherit all things praise God you inherit all the rewards for all the church ages how great how merciful is God to give us a Sevenfold reward just by overcoming the age that we live in amen how merciful is God and we say complete reward amen now first John 4:18 there's no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love and I just want to I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time on this one I just want to drop this thought we can usually tell the difference between reverential fear and unholy fear because unfold unholy fear has torment I mean oh it's like to be tormented to just go through constant torment constant pain or constant trials are constant accusation or or constant guilt is they might know what we're talking about this morning a torment something that you just can't seem to to overcome and and get the victory but the Bible said the spirit of fear always brings torment and God does not give the spirit of fear God may allow torment but that's not directly from God amen he Allah he may allow it to come and God as little creators as we are little craters God lets us choose many times the atmosphere that we live in because he wants us to be the right kind of creator he wants us to be children of his fatherhood and he wants to see us take his word live his word and live above all the temptations of the world remember 2nd Peter chapter 2 says that lot was vexed daily by what he saw and what he heard the word vex means torment let me know that lot chose lot could have lived out you know in the wilderness but he chose to live in a more rich area for the sake of physical blessings but yet the place he chose to live in it daily tormented him because of the things that he saw and things that he heard I'm convinced in this hour later sia most people's torment comes from there compromising on God's Word and allowing themselves to see the wrong thing and to hear the wrong thing I'm convinced we saw a Wednesday night the just shall live by faith but there'll be very few who are even saved because jesus said few there be that find it church we're some of the most blessed people in the world amen to know what we know as we said on Wednesday how can I know what I know and not be happy all right how can we know the Word of God and the revelations of the Bible revealed to us today through God's prophet how can we not be happy knowing what we know praise God but I'm convinced in this hour as you talk with others and your fellowship and you see different people from different churches and you meet people and different things you see many times the very tormenting or the very trouble they're going through is self-inflicted now maybe like the what's different is the man who was born blind remember Jesus sciples asked him is this because he his sin as parents and Jesus said neither this is not upon them but I've allowed this God has allowed this for God's glory but charts in most cases you know we know it's people you know when they get torment and they get in a real rut we'd say or they get in a real bad situation many times is because of their own mistakes because the Bible said lot the lust of the man carries his own lust carries them away in James chapter one right when a man is in sins he's drawn away by his own lust so it's something inside the man or a woman that's lusting and and lust means of forbidden craving so they have a forbidden craving that they should have they should have crucified that desire or that craving they should have starved that desire but instead they keep feeding that desire I mean know what we're talking about and so lot was like that lot could have lived you know we know he couldn't live by Abraham because they couldn't have enough room for their their cattle but he could have lived outside of Sodom but he chose he chose to live in Sodom and because of that everything he saw and heard every day tormented him daily and I think sometimes technology goes a long way of hurting us if we can't handle it people daily tormented by the things they see in here but they're the one allowing it we must not forget we're kings on this earth we are supposed to reign over sin we should tell sin where to go we should tell sin that if not now it's not gonna happen it's not ever gonna happen amen lorry we should have bonus how many what bonus but fear has torment and compromise and sin is from their own lusts and it brings upon the person constant torment by their own mistakes by their own submission to sin rather than submitting to Christ and being a living sacrifice amen presenting their body as a living sacrifice how many living sacrifice how many woke up this morning and maybe your flesh want to do something but you brought it under subjection amen or you wanted to give somebody a piece of your mind or something are you wanting to say something or do something but you had to crucify that it's a constant battle but we're glad to do it because we're just taking up a cross like our Savior took up amen we're happy to do it because no man can even follow Christ unless they take up their cross daily and follow him Christian's don't take any days off amen glory from taking up their cross they constantly crucify the lusts of the flesh and the affections thereof they will not live lives in torment God will give them a way out if they desire way out the Bible said God has to make a way out amen in fact the Bible says there's no situation where God will not give you a victory or a way out from your temptation amen or a way out from your fear or a way out from your torment in every case God has an open door amen hallelujah God has a door cracked open err God has a window cracked err God has some form of escape hallelujah he's got some route to escape he's got a safety plan for every temptation at school yours got have safety plans and we plan for fires and tornadoes and floods and now active shooters and every time we got to have a plan and and now our new strategy we've gone through so many strategy since I've been teaching 13 years about dealing with our new strategy is called sheep and Shepherds so if an active shooter comes in I like this one this is my favorite one so far I can really relate to this one paster the newest one is sheep and Shepherd so then the last year I had to teach the children I'm like the shepherd and you're like the Sheep and wolves can come in with guns and knives and you have to kind of say these things kind of broad you know they're six years old and then the kindergarten teachers have to give it to the fire row but that's the society we live in it's just like the days of Noah violence filled the earth but that's the new approach we have a safety plan and the plan is the Sheep must follow the voice of the shepherd and I'm happy to say Christ is the great Shepherd amen but you're Danes natural pastures and so forth but that's this fivefold ministry but we tell them in every situation there's not a cut and dry answer for example if an intruder comes by the window well then you don't go to the window you go out the door if it shooter goes to the door then you don't go to the door you go out the window if you're surrounded there's a different you know you got to fight back that's the new one you got to fight back fight the devil you got to fight the devil with all you got amen you got a kickin car and gum him to death you have to do everything you can to overcome the devil but the ideas now you follow the voice of your Shepherd and you do whatever it takes to stay alive amen there's not a cut and dry you have to use wisdom and find the way out isn't that just like God's mercy in this hour the same temptation let's say lust or greed or let's say anger or in this case fear it may come in a different channel one day comes by your phone a fearful video or a fearful report of a news report and maybe the next time they come by your neighbor did you hear this about so and so it comes a different channel but God's grace promise there always be a way of escape amen listen to the voice of the shepherd listen to what he's saying use wisdom of the Holy Spirit there's a way out if you're willing to look for it don't give in be strong amen be very courageous amen for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest a man like Joshua Haven brother have said Josh - it could be fearless because he said as I was with Moses so shall I be with you amen now I would have reached us later by the one time today but brother have said Joshua's job was harder than Moses is even the placing the people in the land so doesn't that help us out a little bit coming out of Egypt coming out of the world is that's wonderful job but actually positionally placing the people in the promised land but RAM said was a harder job so Joshua really had to stay true to the promise of God how many understand what we're talking about you and I need to be placed positionally today in the promised land some people were right we might wonder what's our position or what are we called to do don't worry there's a God that will position you amen there's a God that will place you you're already supposed to be seen in heavenly places but then for another position we'd say what's your will what's God's will for your life and so forth God will show it to you but this is a harder work it's gonna take more consecration but God's grace is there for us the Spirit of God will raise a standard against the enemy that comes in like a flood we just got a call out for mercy we've got to ask God for His wisdom amen hallelujah now I want to look at a few more things here God does not give the spirit of fear so God will not torment he'll allow a sinner to go through torment or he may allow some trials to draw the person back to repentance but God does not give the spirit of fear I want them to be scared I want Kevin to be scared I want I don't Jose to have an anxiety attack that's not God's desire we allow it by the things we see in here we allow it by the things we believe we allow it by sin and compromise but God does not give the spirit of fear what God gives is the spirit of boldness can I say like that that's what God gives now I want to go back to 2nd Timothy 1 though I want to read some of these scriptures because they were just such a blessing to me this morning our text was 2nd Timothy 1:7 but I want to read right before that Timothy was crying to see Paul that's how bad he wanted to see him you everson want to see us ain't that bad that's the real book that's the real Christian love that's what verse 4 says mindful of thy tears now verse 5 when I call it to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in the which 12 first and my grandmother Lois and my mother Eunice and I'm also persuaded that in the awesome Paul recognizes that Timothy got his faith handed down to him from his grandmother mother and then he got it he's a third generation believer but they're also children of God they're not grandchildren but they're children of God amen so who does Paul give credit for Timothy's faith his grandmother his mother mother's you see how important your labor is for God I heard a preacher was it a preacher or YouTube video this week I was listening to a sermon I forget which one it was but they were just saying that as mothers and fathers we need to see children we have to have a vision because without a vision of the people perish so as parents and I have six children I understand we can all have discouragement in parenting but I heard this preacher say he said you've got to see your children the vision has to be that when they grow up that's how you see them as you go daily life I'm raising this child in one day she's gonna be this she's gonna be that they're gonna be solid they're gonna be able to be a believer you always got to have the vision before you how many believe in having a vision amen you got to keep that vision or else you'll be discouraged and so Paul's recognizing you have great faith Timothy you're my son in the gospel but that faith was first and your grandmother and mother thank God for a godly grandmother thank God for a godly mother honey thankful for a godly father and grandfather hey man I'm thankful you know my grandpa gars used to sit us down and he would preach to us about what God did in his life his wife died in a hospital in Wauseon Oh Ohio the same one Hospital my mom was healed of cancer and the wife died they took her down to the bottom level he told me this he sat me down he tells us numerous times he said he called their pastor and told them the doctors don't embalmer they brought the pastor and they prayed for her cold body and within five minutes she started getting warm they kept praying and then she come back to life and lived about 20 more years after that by the grace of the Lord and he would sit down and make sure he told us this and this these type of things are to be passed down member God told Joshua and judges in the days of judges remember the days the judges they didn't pass down the testimonies of faith that were in their lives I remember that they weren't a generation they forgot to tell the testimonies of the previous generation you and I must continue to keep the testimonies of God on our lips we must pass them on to the next generation we must have a vision that the Lord tarries the next generation will know about Christ in my life amen they must know that and we must have a vision of the next faith the next generation that's coming up who would have thought we saw brother branham's sons on Wednesday we just waved at him Billy Paul and Joseph we just waved at him on Wednesday I was too scared to want to stop them I'm just seven there's fear again there's there fear I'm preaching on fear today because I was ashamed not like scared like what are they gonna say to me but I'm just a shame like Here I am I'm nobody and here's brother BAM sense but I heard them say I heard them or another brother talking about it and we met brother Mark who knows well Joseph and he's talking about Joseph's sons and grandchildren the prophets son already has grandchildren look at these how generations are just passing church we might be here a while we better make sure we keep the testimonies of Christ upon our lips we must make sure we pass it down to the next generation look at Timothy's faith it came from his grandmother his mother it went into him you got to believe that your faith will go into your son your daughter and your grandchildren if God tears that's the kind of faith I have amen that's the kind of faith that we need to have by the grace of the Lord Paul's recognizing this in Timothy this was first in your grandmother member in the second Timothy in chapter 2 he tells them that your grandmother and mother is the one that taught you the Holy Scriptures and taught you to a salvation see how important your Bible studies are at home mother's you see how important that is your morning Bible study you're eating in Bible study mothers that's so important because Timothy was taught the Holy Scriptures by his mother and grandmother can we read that real quick just a minute here I think it's chapter 2 at the end of the chapter no chapter 3 verse 15 yeah that's right in verse 13 he said they're gonna have more and more deceivers but Paul thanks God that Timothy was taught the scriptures from a child bring them to Sunday School bring them when do you screw up now Wednesday night bring them to youth group bring them to the house of God let them sit here and hear the Word of God let the next generation hear the promises of God I've had people tell me well I'm too scared to have more children because they're gonna grow up and Laodicea that's fear talking that's not faith talking that's fear if you take that mindset well then people might want to leave the earth altogether and their lives are something like if you're scared for them overcoming are you even overcoming but I'm overcoming amen I'm more than a conqueror there's no fear in faith and the just shall live by faith amen glory look at verse 15 and that from a child how did Timothy know the scriptures from a child the faith of his grandmother and the faith of his mother now it's known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus how many appreciate that by God's grace let's go back to chapter 1 I just want to make sure I lay that in there that was kind of stirring on my heart this morning it's not my notes I just kind of read that I thought I like this preached on that a little bit by God's grace so you can see the power of faith the power of daily prayers the power of a vision for your family and the vision for your children and grandchildren you have to have a godly vision verse 6 wherefore I put the in remembrance that I'll stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands so Paul saw gifting Timothy's life and he laid hands and he's we prayed for that gift in his life and he's saying stir up that gift I'm gonna stir that gift that's up inside of thee for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind so apparently Paul's riding this letter saying Timothy don't be fearful stir your gift up in other words make your gift operate how many want to see their faith operate more but Rand says like a muscle if you don't exercise you're gonna get weak in faith he said the problem is in America and I can find the quotes I don't have in front of me he said the problem is we eat do we get off that and we don't exercise our faith he said whenever you hear preach you should try to exercise your faith and speak that faith out that night or the next morning don't just come in here and here and get bigger and bigger and bigger but start exercise and use that strength and speak the word amen hurry hallelujah we got to be spiritually strong and exercise and pray for this thing if you don't feel I could pray anyway if you don't be like a read your Bible if you don't think it'll happen just pray anyway amen exercise your faith if you don't you'll get weaker in faith and then what takes over fear because fear is the opposite of faith they cannot exist at the same time perfect love casts out all fear amen the disciples had some faith on that boat when they're crossing the lake a Jenner Sarah I believe it if you say like that because Jesus said why do you doubt why you're fearful o ye of little faith they had enough glory they had enough faith to go wake up Christ amen they had enough faith to recognize there's somebody on this boat I might not have the faith but there's somebody on this boat that has faith to do it amen and if you're at the faith to do it they call it brother so-and-so call up sister so and so that shows you do have faith to call somebody and pray and contact God and ask God to come on the scene amen they had enough faith out of the ouya oh ye of little faith they had enough faith to recognize Christ and we should have that much faith we can recognize Christ in our myths bringing the songs bringing the the worship bringing the preaching we should recognize Christ in our myths amen now I'm not done with that I want to keep going so Paul says stir up your gift and then God didn't give you the spirit of fear Timothy now look the profits no longer with them the profit is going to die this is the profits last letter second Timothy the Prophet is going to die he said I fought a good fight and now what is he saying you're the next generation Timothy you're the next generation stir up the gift of God in you have faith be strong have the spirit have a sound mind power and love oh I want to be full of power I want to be full of love I want my mind to be sound right on the Word of God this is not some unsound doctrine we went our mind centered on sound doctrine amen right out of the Word of God for heaven earth shall pass away but my word will never pass away amen glory he says beaver say I love this this is always reminds me brother branham be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner so Paul said don't be ashamed of the prophet of the hour not ashamed a brother Brennan he's a true prophet of God amen nor of our Lord Jesus of course he's our Savior our God but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according the power of God so Paul's telling him you have to in order to endure the afflictions of the righteous you have to have the power of God so can we just say it can we just say that you're gonna have afflictions can you just say that pair you're gonna you're going to have afflictions you're gonna have tribulations but he said be strong and let the power of God it be in your life so that you can overcome the afflictions and tribulations remember Jesus told the thyroids here in church age fear not none of those things that will come upon you they'll cast you into prison and all those things and brother Mannis said it's like a mother that before she lays down her child for bed and before she leaves the room at night times she whispers this way brother man said this is his illustration of Christ's love she whispers little Johnny or Timmy was this case Timothy little Timothy I'm gonna shut the lights off now don't be scared I'm just in the other room I've got it like I heard a joke one time it's kind of a funny joke I think but a boy was asking a mother you know a boy was asking his mom mom can you stay with me - I fall asleep and he just wouldn't fall asleep and the mother is left and said I got to go to sleep I gotta go sleep with Daddy so I gotta leave you here and the boy said why is daddy's such a scaredy cat she's like I gotta leave you I gotta sleep with Daddy well why is daddy such a scaredy cat I thought that was kind of funny and that's not why the mom you know that's like the story buddy I'm told that's not why the mom left but the mom knows the child has to get victory over fear there's nothing to fear when the child is full of love amen you give that child a good kiss on the cheek and a hug prayer right there in their bed then they feel they should feel the love of God amen how many times did my children said daddy I feel the spirit of fear I'm scared of this can you pray with me before bed we've done it so many times and I just rebuke that spirit of fear in the name of Jesus Christ there's nothing be afraid other nothing like this we actually haven't had it in a few months now by God's grace Oh Mary thank you know sometimes children see things they shouldn't see or know where they you know just how it is that they're you know out here in Laodicea but we have power over that he said you have the power of love and a sound mind amen glory verse 9 who has saved us and called us with an holy calling that's how I teaching the the kids the other night you have a holy colony everyone's called to holiness that's your calling live holy the Bible second Peter ones that you're called to virtue I'd only want to be strong for Christ you actually called to be strong you can't say well I can't be as strong as brother so-and-so or sister Sohn so you can be as strong as God made you to be strong don't limit yourself by comparing yourself to somebody else let me be as strong as Christ wants me to be praise God let me be strong in the faith that may be a testimony to others let me be a source of strength a source of virtue because Christ has called me to virtue let me be a brave testimony let me be a brave Christian for Christ Jesus amen hey man glory hi we're not called according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which he has given us in Christ Jesus before the world began then I'll encourage you God had a purpose for your life before the world ever began now don't be scared of it now don't be scared of it but just trust him he has a purpose for your life it was written before the foundation world I'm trying to get down to okay let's keep on but now is made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel where and who I'm appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles see that's where a a preacher could have more than one gift teacher apostle and we know he was a pastor in Ephesus so Paul a preacher could have more than one gift in the fivefold ministry that's your scripture right there that's the blessing verse 12 for the the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I believed and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which is which I have committed unto him against that day let me just stop their moment here Paul said it's because of Christ that I will suffer what's he gonna do he's gonna suffer martyred him he's gonna suffer death he's gonna have his head chopped off in a few days or weeks or whatever this is the last letter and his words are I'm suffering for these things for the gospel nevertheless I'm not ashamed to die for Christ for I know whom I have believed Paul met Christ face-to-face can I say it like that he met him as a light on the road to Damascus and then he went to Arabia and the Bible said Jesus Christ Himself gave me the revelation of the gospel if anybody changes their curse he had vision after vision after vision meeting after meeting with that pillar of fire Jesus Christ so he tells Paul don't be scared don't be scared and I'm not scared to die because I know who I am I know where I got the revelation from I know where I've heard from I've heard from God himself amen and Paul tells Timothy that's what you must remember remember who you've heard from you've not heard from a man you've not heard from a church you've heard from the throne of God a man you've heard thus saith the Lord you've heard from God's Word and that's what our souls must anchor in amen you know who you believe you know who you heard the Word of God from amen that's right that's what Paul says what is this is where it all comes down to I'm going to die and don't let fear come upon you and I'm fine with my destiny I'm fine with God's plan for my life to die as a martyr because I know who I believed amen hallelujah I know who made me the promise and I knows tell me these things it's got all mighty it's God's plan for my life amen for I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day Christ has persuaded me that all my hopes and dreams and everything that I've wondered about that he he will hold it that he will take care of it I've committed to his hand should I do am I called to do more missionary work am I called to do this or that all the questions anything that was a question in his mind he committed all that to Christ I am in Christ's hands and Christ will take care of me hey man now I want to watch this look at here's where the baptism the Holy Ghost is so important look at verse 13 and 14 this is why we got to be born again if you're not born again you don't have stability like you need to have that's why brother man preach that message why are the people at church people so tossed about he stay because they don't live in the holiest of Holies that means they're not born again right they live out in the outer court they serve God just in the flesh they just made me go to church but they're not really committed in their mind their minds may be little transformed but they're not fully born-again the soul so they're kind of tossed all the time but Paul is gonna die he's telling Timothy be sound and verse 13 hold fast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus so you have to hold the word you've heard from the prophet of God in faith and in love not in fear you catch that he just said God doesn't give you the spirit of fear hold the word I've said unto you in faith and in love glory remember my words in faith in love verse 14 that good thing which was committed unto thee what the gospel keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us amen how is Paul gonna keep how is Paul gonna help the next generation to see the gospel and power of Christ he's got to keep it by the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his heart hey man the Prophet won't be there before he can go ask questions or go visit Paul anymore the prophets going off the scene he's got to hold fast the truth of the gospel with power and love and a sound mind by the Holy Ghost in his soul that's the only way he'll hold fast the Word of God hey man and then you know the chapter he ends the chapter by saying everybody's left me you're one of the few preachers actually believe the message all of asia's turned away and he names those people that have fallen away he name he calls them out by name in the letter now see Paul's not telling Timothy to be a pushover he's saying hold these things with power don't be fearful you're gonna be all alone with no more profit you're me all by yourself but he said remember what you heard and hold fast this by faith and love I think we can all see that by the grace of Lord go to uh let's go to acts 4:31 I think you familiar with this one I preached on this numerous times I think when the Holy Ghost fell the second time in the book of Acts member there in a prayer meeting up in upper room and the Bible said God shook the place and bowed and said Lord you know if they shake this place but shake us shake our lives shake our lives up so we can have more yielding to the Holy Spirit right shake our lives ups our lives can get back in order show us your power show us your love right oh my lord shake up my life so my only desire is to please you praise the Lord x4 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God with boldness Paul told Timothy don't be ashamed of me don't be ashamed of the Lord don't be ashamed of the message right hold they'll hold that in your heart with faith and love by the power of the Holy Spirit amen aren't you glad for the anchoring power of Christ you got to have that if not you'll be tossed to and fro the Bible said you'll be a like a man who's unstable in all his ways double minded well one day it's right one day it's wrong one day it's back and forth we need faith and love and a holding fast by the seal of God in our souls in other words say Lord plan it so deep it goes down to my soul amen let it go past the flesh let it go past my mind let it go into the soul where I can't explain it but I know it's a presence I know it's a substance in my soul amen it's part of my nature my nature is the Holy Spirit my nature has faith my nature has hope and love and that's my nature let it go all the way down to the soul praise God hey man where I'm anchored in Christ Hebrews 13:5 let your conversation be without covetousness never say oh I wish I had this wish I did like this so it's like somebody else and be content with such things as you have for he has set who's he God for God has said for the reason we can be content and not covet things of the world is for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee I don't have this we say oh I don't have this I need this I need this and God saying you have me praise God I mean that's just a simple the simple gospel so remember many times we just make it too difficult sometimes we make it too difficult seek ye first the kingdom of God and what's the promise everything else to be added unto you that's why we put God's Word his house the message we put God's word above everything else and then everything else we need will be added how many witness to that I'm an absolute witness of that by the grace of God I've tried to put God first and everything no compromise with the word first and everything I've needed God has provided by His grace verse six so that we say so when we remember I'll never leave there forsake thee we may say how boldly now with fear so that we may say boldly the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me aim God does not give the spirit of fear being anxious and and nervous and frightened and expecting wrong all the time God does not give that spirit and what's the problem we sometimes covet or we're discontented I wish I need that it's got to happen it's God we're so discontented but we got to be content that Christ is with us amen we must be content that he said I will never leave thee I will never forsake thee how many believe that boldly and boldly say it not like well I'm just saying it because the preacher said it I'm just saying it because the Bible said but having a conviction it's something I believe it's from my heart it's from my soul and you can say the Lord is my helpful I will not fear what man shall do unto me Amen I will not fear if I lose my job I will not fear if this family forsakes me I will not fear if this doesn't come through like it's supposed to come through I will trust in God because God said I will leave thee nor forsake thee hey man so again it's gotta be opposites faith and fear how to be opposites because love casts out all fear and herein fear the Bible said you have not fear man but the boldly say the Lord is with me how many really think this is an important message I do because we go through trials all the time and Satan tries to con constantly bombard us with fear constantly there are so many examples you when I go for a run a dog will bark at me and I get all nervous I'm fearful I must be a for a fearful person I'm not really proud of that but a little dog a Bart get me out of that I'm in my zone I'm trying to pray and trying to sing you know it happens in everything like when Haven got cut on the on the the cheek there you know she fell had to go the ER in that moment as a father I'm watching I'm holding my daughter's cheek and had a major puncture wound in it which had required six stitches and I'm seeing you know just to be a little bit graphic but feeling the blood pour out in that moment that's the moment where we need to have faith and I caught myself just I honestly God knows how I caught myself like all nervous like honey honey honey cuz I don't like blood I don't I'm not doctored brother Jesse I'm not a doctor I'm not like that thank God we have them amen glory cuz I don't I don't handle that thing I don't handle pain well you know some like sometimes like that but something overcame me brother Simon I just got there we're talking about the Lord and what God is doing and something just came over me and Simon looked at her Simon was so calm this time I said just you're gonna be alright just just cover it you're gonna be alright don't don't be scared and Simon said these words Simon said Haven God protected you and instead of your eye getting hit God protected you and let your cheek it hit instead because she could have lost an eye on the way the hospital my wife said she drive along taking Haven to emergency room there and havens only words or the word she was saying was mommy I'm so blessed she said god allowed my eye not to be lost and he just let me get hit in the cheek so all the way there and set up being overcome with fear what do we have to do we have to overcome that with faith and then brother Simon the next day record his testimony and he's seen three people die in front of him and God has raised all them up three of them on the job site I just put the video on our YouTube page if you want to watch it in the last five years he's seen three people fall and die or at work they have pretty those sometimes the people don't follow the law so you know so they fully fall off a scaffolding and things like that he's seen three people die with no pulse and they've all come back to the glory of God so see he was tested God let him go through those tests and he said when it first happened he got nervous when the first man died but the second third time he said God allowed him to take control of the situation because faith doesn't stand back and say hello faith has hair on his chest faith has got big muscles the man said face says shut up and sit down I'm telling you what to do so the third time it happened brother Simon told everybody what to do call 9-1-1 do all this pray for a pray form and then a man later come back and said that God totally healed the person he was dead no pulse and came back to life huh me no God's a healer today I thought that might encourage your faith I didn't plan on saying that just kind of come out the Lord is my helper a helper I will not fear what man or can I add this what the devil will do to me because if God allowed the devil to do it then it's got allowed it we've got to overcome Damon first John 4:16 now read this earlier and we have known and believed that one God I'm sorry believe the love that God hath to us God his love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so are you living in love is that what you're that's our testimony that's always saying I'm walking by faith living in love I am covered Hardy walking that way today the Bible says we are to walk in love and there's no fear in love here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment so what is perfect love do it makes you be bold as you approach the day of judgment not bold like well I'm gonna tell God all about but bold like I know where I stand with God I had been in God's presence and I know where I stand with God isn't that a powerful testimony Church that's what the Bible says about love we're gonna read that if you got you got a chance today 1st John 4:17 here and as our love made perfect so when love gets completed that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world amen the only way we can be in this road as he is in that world is to live from our soul because that's where the seal of God is that's where the Holy Ghost is amen go or you see that that's my brother Graham can tell testimonies of people dying and they say oh this is this you know this is a sad party life I forget the man I forget Paul Blair oh no no that's not Paul there but Paul Rader I think might even Paul Rader I got the few mixed up they asked him they said you're gonna die now are you scared or is this the worst time your life he said no this is the greatest time in my life because in five minutes I'm dying but in five minutes I'll be in the presence of Christ is that bold or fearful about the day of judgement that's bold see because you've been in God's presence that's where I was gonna go at the end you the reason you don't fear other people and other things and you know you don't fear the boss or fear the pastor you don't fear a preacher you don't fear anybody because you've been in the presence of somebody greater than a preacher or a boss or a pastor you've been the president of Jesus Christ amen that was my punchline I was gonna hit the end but that's all right God come on live it earlier by the grace of the Lord you understand that by God's grace that's why you don't fear that's why you need to pray if you possibly can before our trial comes I've got an important meeting I'm gonna make sure you pray because if you get in his presence then you won't fear that presence you might feel a little anxiety but how many times have I had meetings how many times have I had situations waiting for emails or people or people attacked me or different things like that and how many times that if we just pray beforehand we can actually go into the meeting or we can go into that that situation have confidence going into it with a smile on your face and knowing that Christ is with me he said he'd never leave me or forsake me how many want him with you that's that's what it's all about praise God that's what it's all about that he is with me as the scripture said we may say boldly the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do to me let me find a place to close here my I never got to really what I want to get to but that's okay he's anybody pulling out their exhibit pone and that's I have to wonder about that anymore but if I missed it forgive me I tried to stay right with the Word of God the first appearance of fear there's 700 scriptures the first one is Genesis 3:10 where Adam and Eve is sin and it says and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid so the very first instance of fear is Adam and Eve being fearful of the voice of God before God could talk to them and they weren't afraid so when some we know when someone sins and when someone commits a trespass against the Lord it brings a fear to the voice that they once loved that's why people be scared coming to church were scared talking to a pastor or scared talk and anybody who's got the Word of God you know that's I'm gonna hold them accountable because if they're living in sin they don't have confidence with God they have fear of that they have a fear because fear a torment so what does Adam Eve do they go hide themselves right in the bushes and they hide away it's the very first instance of fear so sin brought fear to hide from the voice they once loved oh my god help us to always be open to hearing that loving voice of Christ may we not run from that voice but may we draw closer to that voice the last appearance of fear for something for some reason not just an alpha an Omega because there are 700 scriptures I just I thought well I wonder what the first and last scriptures are the last Scripture and I think we need to look at this one revelation 21:8 but the fearful the unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death you know people can go to hell and burn because of once in fear did you know that and it's the first one listed church and what's the major disease isn't it still heart disease brother Scott that kills people do you know I thought I looked up a few years ago on the internet and I thought heart disease and the Bible said that it may be men's with their hearts failing for fear jesus said that perplexity of times and roars and rumors of wars suicide in America is at the highest rate it's ever been Time magazine just put a new article about a preacher put on the interface book last night I saw the anti antidepressant they called it because all the antidepressant drugs are not working why because those drugs are not the Spirit of God and drugs are not going to help so much it's gonna be the Holy Ghost is going to help because Jesus said I am your peace I know you're gonna have trouble but I'm leaving you my peace praise the Lord so they think they got a new drug to help all this epidemic they're not going to be able to these days must be like the days of Noah and we have to shine the light and we have to receive the love of God with faith and love and stand there and boldly say the Lord is with me we have to stand the midst of all this and be lights to others that we might bring others to Christ hey man but Church the very first sin listed that will not inherit that city is fear fear afraid timid fear and I just want to look at a few scriptures remember with godly fear you can say people preaching fire brimstone will save people job 123 says that brother Branham says that we need if we need a fire brimstone religion sometimes Jude 1:23 save them through fear the Bible says pulling them out of the fire there's times people need to hear fire and brimstone messages but I want to say a few things when people take the mark of the beast when this tribulation starts and they sell out and take that mark they sell out because of fear of losing their money and food buy and sell people will go to hell and burn because they love food and their money more than the gospel of Jesus Christ more than being able to stand up against that beast now that all of our visitor hell knows it but the Beast is actually the spirit behind the Roman Catholic Church they're sweet people but that beast sits on seven hills and Rome sits on seven hills I don't know if you knew that but we could take you through the scripture on that the people and there are sweet but the doctrines are idolatry and they worship Mary and they do all these awful they pray to dead Saints and there's nothing in the Bible about that it's it's full of unclean spirits the Bible said but we could take you through that it's what I want you to know I'm not preaching on people I'm preaching against that spirit and this is the spirit of fear I'm gonna lose all my bank account and brother Branham said they'll compromise in order to have some public ministry he said preachers will compromise so they can't least have a church still and have some type of public ministry fear the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of God and will have their names I'm sorry Burton the lake of fire that's serious Church the Bible said he that denies me before men shall be denied before the Holy Angels in Luke 12 nine fearful they're more afraid of a man or government than they are of God fearful that was our only sin remember the rich young ruler he only had one sin what was it you love money Jesus had ghosts everything your ghost so everything all the other Commandments he kept so once and keep somebody from being say there's one thing they won't surrender that's why we got to surrender everything amen let Christ in every area of your life every situation let Christ and everything don't hold on to sin get rid of it flee from it burn it get as far away from yourself as possible amen that you might be saved amen glory did you ever think of that not remember adulterers and fornicators will go to hell and one one one article I read online said they're afraid to be single they're afraid to be single even after a person gets divorced they're scared to be single again they got a marry second third for time because of fear oh I don't want to be alone and that's always the card they pull and I'm not trying to be critical but that's always the card they pull oh I don't want to be alone and yes you feel sorry for them we feel sorry it's got to be hard to be alone but we must remember Jesus said I'll never leave you alone we must keep the commands the commands are more important than feelings and ideas the commands God's Word is what's most important amen adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God fornicators will not jesus said it's like a parable where God the Father invites everybody to the marriage of his son and the Bible said they said the suppers ready in Luke 14 verse 18 and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first set of them I have bought a piece of ground and they must have needs go and see it I pray thou have me excused he was more fearful about his ground I don't know something with his ground the pressure of his ground and money in the future was more important than the marriage of Christ the next thing and another said I bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them he's more fearful about maybe getting behind on his farming than he is to go to the rapture with Christ Jesus another said I've married a wife so see a lot of these motivations can be fear all I'm gonna lose my wife I'm gonna lose my husband Jesus if you're not willing to forsake everything and follow me you're not worthy of me everything must be for sucking in order to obey the commands of God because the commands are God's love and God's protection God's commands are his protection to us we believe that they keep us safe God's commands ours love to us people say well God's not a bunch of rules well it is a rule God has rules and commands that protect us just like you have rules at your house you have rules so you don't burn yourself at the stove you have rules you have to follow so you don't hurt somebody at work right I just talked about the rules I have to follow in case there's intruders rules protect you if you follow them that's what God's Word is it is the rule that leads us to eternal life amen man-made rules are called legalism they're things that the Bible does not say there are additions to the Word of God yes we don't have man-made rules but we do have the rules of God's Word and there's a scripture that proves that flipping in 3:16 we're not gonna read it but the Bible said let's all keep the same rule the Bible says that there's one rule and that's love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul mind and strength let me try to close here I'm having a tough time closing I'm so enjoying this I hope you're enjoying it by God's grace I can I can't even scratch the surface on fear it's so much so see the the fear of losing life the fear of losing a relationship the fear of losing money and all these things the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of God fear is contagious look at Deuteronomy 20 verse 8 fear is contagious just like love is contagious we all know demons you know that you like to gather each other around and get help and everything like that we've read quotes about that before but Simon read some quotes last time on that Deuteronomy 20 verse 8 it's contagious fear is contagious but so is faith look at Deuteronomy verse 8 Moses talking about the law of warfare and the shall speak further under the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted let him go and return into his house less his brother's heart faint as well as his heart God said if I'm gonna have an army I can have no fear in my army amen praise God because if I sense a little if we sense a little fear and so and so a little fear and so and so that fear will jump on somebody else right so God told Moses if somebody else is scared get him out because he's gonna make his brother scared a little leaven leavens the whole church the whole army remember judges chapter 7 verse 3 God told Gideon he said the first thing you do he said he had a listen Church he had a he had a new church of 32,000 people in his church can you imagine a church like that and he's pastor of a church with 32,000 people I'm just typing that you know and the very first sermon remember when he preaches a few years ago this is beautiful we preached the whole books a whole life and get in I felt it was beautiful his very first sermon was coming out and he come out and said he could have said like this he could said thus saith the Lord whoever's fearful go ahead and leave our camp that's his first sermon as a new pastor first sermon let's get all the PR and you know how many left twenty-two thousand twenty-two thousand out of the thirty-two thousand left he's left with ten thousand and then he had to slim him down a little more a little more till he only had three hundred the very first thing God said was I don't want fearful people in my army I need people of faith because fear is contagious it will paralyze you I've never been so scared to get paralyzed as a brother have said unbelief he said paralyzes your faith he says you don't know how to pray don't know sure what to do all these things God's army does not have room for fear if fear is continued to be fed and believed then what you fear will come upon you so it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy that's the words we use in education if students say well I can't learn this I can't learn that it's self-fulfilling prophecy it's even in its science science knows that say like education knows it the words you say produce the result because power power in the tongue is life and death in the power right and the tongue life and destined power of the tongue forgiveme job 3:25 said for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me Joe feared one day he loses children Joe feared one day he loses health Joe fear one day he lose all his money and that's what happened the Bible said it actually happened to him he said because I fear Him other Bram said that in perfect faith you want to look it up job said Joe fear what he feared came upon them but yet church looking and all this the cow gracious God is God looked down from heaven and said Satan there's a perfect man because God was looking at his end result God was looking at what job was going to become after the trial God was looking at what he was through the blood aren't you glad Christ looks at you through his own blood and there's no sin and Christ's blood it's only his righteousness amen and he sees us through his blood amen and that's what God so the situation job allowed this because he had fear he just meditate on the fear too much it come to pass but yet God said I know he'll go through this trial and he'll be better at the end amen he'll learn from this situation I just have to close with one or two quotes here I'm already going to hour-and-a-half I got a close here the program says this in 19:53 talking about israel he said the first thing we want to find out is that this has been the greatest thing that I found him on Christian people throughout the entire world has been a fear they're always afraid my brother Adam says this over this is the vein I hid I just looked in great fear in one sentence there was like 84 hits I went through all the quotes maybe half of them said this but Ram said of all my traveling around the world the greatest thing I find the hinners of the church is fear when they should have faith but fear has gripped ahold he said when a little sickness strikes they're afraid many I wonder sometimes and now I'm along with you but now when I'm trying to do tonight and this week is to try to drive that fear away by God's Word amen he says one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody's scared to death what's gonna happen who he said why Jesus even said when the fearful sights come he said lift up your head and rejoice for your redemptions nigh when these things begin to happen hallelujah amen the greatest thing I find against the church deny is fear so who's your greatest battle most of times we gonna fight yourself fear coming into your own mind yeah I know Jesse Smith is my worst enemy but along with that is the spirit of fear trying to get onto my flesh the sin nature that's inside of me making Jesse Smith the flesh fearful the greatest thing against the church against us tonight is fear everybody scared to death about some what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy carefree just like these fellows signing up here and the brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing to harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ God has promised he said God has called you by election he has said his church in order Jesus that no man can come to me except the father draws him you never come to God because you wanted to you come because Christ called you could we just go back to that for a moment on Wednesday night brother Graham said you had nothing to do with your salvation it is not Jesus plus your works it is Jesus only amen and that's our brother Brahim is trying to drive the fear away from the people you're not the one that came to this God called you to this amen God culture to the word God called you to the truth and he said be not afraid I'm with you always fear not what man can do but boldly say the Lord is my helper Christ is with me Amen hallelujah amen jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him you can never come to God because you wanted to he said God called you and he that comes to me I'll no eyes cast out I'll give him eternal life not just lasting for one week one revival to another but everlasting eternal life and raise him up at the last day and program says this quote if that doesn't take the wind out of Satan sails I don't know what does praise God these simple scriptures we just read over and forget sometimes these scriptures will take the wind out of Satan's sails in other words they'll take the fear out of your life the fear out of your thinking the fear out of anything that's bothering you the love of Christ and the confidence that he's with you and called you and ordained you before the foundation world that will take all the winds on a satan sails hey man that's John 6:39 and this is the Father's will which he has sent me that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing Church Christ is not going to lose you if he called you and he invited you to this he's not going to lose you just trust and obey amen I should lose nothing but shall raise it up against the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see it the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day let's say into our feet here I better stop because I'm just going to keep going all day there's only one service I feel like I could preach all day because still got the good anointing on me I feel strong now we didn't get to there so much I I hardly touched the surface but I want to just close with these last few things Psalms 23:4 yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil why David for thou art with me what are we holding on to today Church the promise of God that he's with us the God that called us for newest that saved us by grace the just shall live by faith by his faith the gift of his faith to us now Jesse Smith kimbos William Branham can't boast you put the preacher name in there nobody can boast about salvation it was Jesus only and the God that called you will keep you if we just surrender to his will how many want to surrender to his will programs that maybe troubles coming in we know as we look ahead and see the great stormy tides of death yonder as David of old said I'll fear no evil thou art with me he said we thank thee we adore thee seeing the souls come to thee as a vindication of your presence and he goes to Elijah he says I always thought of him as a great big man tall maybe skinny and we see that he was a fearless man when the Spirit of God was upon him he did not worry about what anyone thought about him or what the world had to say as long as the Spirit of God was on him and you know I kind of believe that's just about the attitude of the church now or anytime or anybody so this is anytime or anybody's here sickness nothing bothers you as long as the Spirit of God is near you and you know it let a person be so ever so sick and let the Holy Spirit come into the room and anoint that person and you'll see a change person in a few moments does everybody believe that what will change the situation the spirit of God because God is love let's bow our heads have a word of Prayer here we just want to take a few moments here and we want to pray a little bit talk to the Lord I don't know why I felt so impressed to preach on fear I'd really like to get the church age done but there's a purpose the RAM said fear is the greatest hindrance to your life how many want to be free from hindrance of fear would you just raise your hands I can see okay let me pray for you let's let's pray and ask God's presence here to minister to us well Rams a Christian he's not a triad it's an O so it's something that's real when brother Graham prayed he said this may every fear and every dread every nervousness everything be away from the human mind just now that your spirit could come in here and give us the greatest climax we've ever had in any meeting let's pray Heavenly Father I preached your word Lord God I sent your presence Lord God Lord as your prophet said you are trying so hard to push your way into our lives Lord God in many times Lord as we said the beginning it's our own sin it's our own mistakes or our own decisions that keep your spirit away dear God and Lord I just asked now Lord you see the hands Lord you see those that maybe could have raised their hands maybe you see those who maybe struggle with fear anxiety or did I know different ones who struggle with it all the time and they that's their battle they'll get victory and it comes back the victory comes back Lord you've allowed us all battles I don't know the extent Lord God of the people's trials but you do and father we ask now Lord as we sing here in worship that we could get in your holy presence and in that presence Lord would drive off fear away the love of God would come down as your prophet said about Elijah he was fearless as long as he could sense your presence this Samson the same thing for all these Bible characters Lord God but Lord today were the characters where the Bible characters Lord God that need your spirit we're the characters that need freedom from fear freedom from anxiety we don't want to expect evil we want to expect good hallelujah I'll just play that spirit of Living God fall fresh on me Lord you hear my prayer Lord it's a humble prayer I'm sincere I preachers and citizen seers I know how to do I've tried to have no showmanship for Jesus the only thing he lacked was showmanship dear God try to preach your word Jesus Lord we know your people are sheep and sheep need reminders we need to be stirred up from time to time Lord stir us up Lord God that will hold on to the gospel with faith and love by the Holy Ghost that's inside of us Lord come Lord if we're being tossed about it for not us tables we need to be father may we pray Lord may each one of us pray until we feel your love that the love would drive away that feared your God and then we know well I've seen the friends of somebody greater than my boss but then my disbelieving spouse or whoever it is my cousin or disbelieving cousin whoever it is Lord we've stood in the Friends of somebody greater who you the God of heaven the great God and Savior our Lord Jesus Christ father let your presence come now as we sing in worship Lord God that we would not fear but we walk out of here free

out demons and God is my witness there in that eyes of that woman who just even possess God is my witness all fear vanished and that's what we must open our minds to the Word of God that the Holy
