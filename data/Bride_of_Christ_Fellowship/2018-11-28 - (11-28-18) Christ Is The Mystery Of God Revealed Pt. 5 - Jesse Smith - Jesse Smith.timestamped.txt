[34:11] Colossians chapter 1 I like to preach a

[34:15] reveal and I think this will be the
[34:16] final part and then we'll start get back
[34:19] and other messages Lord willing next
[34:21] week next Wednesday
[34:24] caution chapter 1
[34:40] like to start there 17 the Bible says
[34:54] and he is before all things and by him
[34:56] all things consist
[34:58] and he is the head of the body the
[35:01] church who is the beginning the
[35:03] firstborn from the dead that in all
[35:04] things he might have the preeminence for
[35:08] please the father that in him should
[35:11] awfulness dwell and having made peace
[35:14] through the blood of his cross by him to
[35:17] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[35:21] I say whether they be things in earth or
[35:24] things in heaven and you that were
[35:26] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[35:29] mind by wicked works yet now hath he
[35:33] reconciled glory in the body of his
[35:37] flesh through death to present you holy
[35:39] and unblameable and Unruh provable in
[35:42] his sight if you continue in the faith
[35:46] grounded and settled and be not moved
[35:49] away from the hope of the gospel which
[35:51] ye have heard and which was preached to
[35:53] every creature which is under heaven
[35:54] where of i paul and made a minister who
[35:59] now rejoice in my sufferings for you and
[36:01] fill up that which is behind of the
[36:03] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[36:05] his body sake which is the church where
[36:08] of I am made a minister according to the
[36:11] dispensation of God which is given to me
[36:14] for you to fulfill the Word of God even
[36:18] the mystery which hath been hid from
[36:20] ages and from generations but now is
[36:23] made manifest to his Saints now we know
[36:25] this mystery who was hid for 4,000 years
[36:29] to whom God made known or would make
[36:33] known what is the riches of the glory of
[36:35] this mystery among the gentiles which is
[36:38] christ in you the hope of glory whom we
[36:42] preach warning every man and teaching
[36:44] every man in all wisdom that we may
[36:47] present every man
[36:48] perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I
[36:50] also labor striving according to his
[36:54] working which worketh in me mightily hey
[36:58] men they God has blessed things of
[37:00] reading of his word may be seated praise
[37:01] God what a chapter huh what a way to end
[37:07] a chapter alright
[37:09] we'd like to finish this part here this
[37:11] part five here with this look at the
[37:14] stature I'm sorry no such crisis a
[37:16] mystery of God revealed we've looked at
[37:19] numerous parts of this but the main
[37:21] focus has been predestination and
[37:24] revelation and I think tonight we'll
[37:27] just look at a little bit more of each
[37:29] one and then it finishes with
[37:30] preeminence whether random ends this
[37:33] message with preeminence so I think
[37:35] we'll finish with that tonight by the
[37:37] grace of the Lord now I'd like to look
[37:41] at a few scriptures let's go brother
[37:43] branham quotes Matthew 11:25 so let's go
[37:45] there Matthew 11:25 we'll start a little
[37:48] more with revelation Matthew 11:25 now
[38:00] we ended Sunday night by looking at how
[38:04] everybody who is around the message
[38:07] necessarily doesn't really have the
[38:09] revelation of the message they have an
[38:13] intellectual understanding because their
[38:17] life and the fruits of their life
[38:19] expresses if they have the revelation or
[38:22] not whether someone would commit
[38:24] adultery or someone would almost commit
[38:27] adultery and flirt with other women yet
[38:31] they're married or if it's if it's women
[38:33] flirting with men or we saw perhaps how
[38:36] how people will let the TV in as we
[38:39] looked at or as we mentioned they're on
[38:41] Sunday night and and they'll just let
[38:42] the world back in they they kept the
[38:44] world out for so long but but then they
[38:46] let the world back in which is the lust
[38:49] of the eyes and the know the private
[38:52] life and it's that pride saying well III
[38:55] can still be in the message or I can
[38:57] still be a believer and I can still
[38:59] partake a worldly things well that's a
[39:01] diss
[39:02] section you can't you cannot flirt with
[39:03] the world and still be married to Jesus
[39:06] Jesus is not going to come back and
[39:09] rapture a church who's flirting with the
[39:11] world he's God he's that you wouldn't
[39:15] marry somebody like that right you
[39:17] wouldn't marry a flirter who would flirt
[39:19] with other people and so we see we ended
[39:24] with that people's lives eventually
[39:26] we'll prove Jesus said it's it's it's
[39:29] not difficult a tree is known by its
[39:32] fruit and it may take a long time to see
[39:35] people's fruit but pretty soon you're
[39:37] gonna see the fruit of their life amen
[39:38] and so we want our fruit to be godly
[39:41] fruit we want it to be christ-like fruit
[39:44] day men and brother have said see God
[39:47] holds the key to this revelation of
[39:50] Christ himself schools of theology can
[39:54] never find it jesus said so and brother
[39:56] man have said let's if you want to read
[39:58] it now he said Matthew 11:25 so I'm
[40:02] going to read that here and at that time
[40:04] jesus answered us and I thank thee O
[40:06] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[40:08] thou has hid these things from the wise
[40:10] and prudent and has to reveal them unto
[40:13] babes even so father for it seemed good
[40:17] in thy sight amen
[40:21] if you really love Jesus Christ and I
[40:25] mean really love him if he's really the
[40:28] love of your life then God sees you as a
[40:31] little babe he sees you as a little
[40:35] child but see if not if not if we really
[40:39] if there's something around the message
[40:42] but don't really love Jesus with all
[40:44] their hearts that God sees them as a
[40:46] stuffed shirt they just think they're
[40:48] better than other churches are better
[40:49] than other people
[40:50] as we said pride makes them say well
[40:52] well I can compromise on God's Word God
[40:55] really doesn't care and they'll make an
[40:57] excuse and say well if the thief on the
[40:59] cross wait at the end I'll make it too
[41:01] but that's the wrong idea the thief on
[41:04] the cross that was his only chance we
[41:07] might say and he made the most of that
[41:09] chance and he said the word is the word
[41:12] is right the word is pure the word is
[41:14] true
[41:15] and he judged the word right but when we
[41:18] flirt with the world and when people
[41:19] flirt with the world they're judging
[41:21] that the word is not right they're
[41:23] judging that the word doesn't really
[41:25] mean what it says it goes back to the
[41:27] Garden of Eden right where the serpent
[41:29] saying all that you'll you'll not surely
[41:33] die the words not really like that so
[41:36] see the thief on the cross is something
[41:37] totally different that was his first
[41:39] chance that was his only chance and he
[41:42] judged the word right amen and so God
[41:45] either sees us as a child or he sees us
[41:49] as a stuffed shirt someone who's
[41:51] self-proclaimed wise or a self-made wise
[41:54] person or a self-made righteous or
[41:57] religious person amen but remember what
[42:01] James chapter 1 says let's read it there
[42:03] since we just read that one let's go to
[42:05] James chapter 1 I believe it's verse 27
[42:10] Hebrews and James here's how to know if
[42:15] your hearts pure verse 26
[42:18] If any man among you seem to be
[42:20] religious and Brian's not his tongue but
[42:22] deceiveth his own heart this man's
[42:25] religion is in vain so if someone can't
[42:28] stop gossiping or can't stop cussing or
[42:31] can't stop criticizing or they can't
[42:33] tame their tongue the Bible said their
[42:35] religion is in vain
[42:37] how many know the Bible says let off the
[42:39] words of your mouth be full of grace how
[42:42] we know the Bible says that ministering
[42:45] grace to the hearer praise God verse 27
[42:49] pure religion and undefiled before God
[42:51] and the father is this to visit the
[42:54] fatherless and widows in their
[42:55] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[42:57] from the world
[42:59] amen hallelujah so we see that's what
[43:03] the revelation produces the revelation
[43:06] produces a spotless life because
[43:09] remember the people said Jesus's wife is
[43:11] without spot or blemish because she's
[43:13] lost in the waters of the word amen
[43:17] hallelujah well him says see the look at
[43:19] them pharisees the sadducees Herodians
[43:22] whatever they're great organizations
[43:24] jesus said you're blind leading
[43:26] the blind he said and if they're all
[43:29] leading the blind won't they all fall in
[43:31] the ditch both the leader and the blind
[43:35] to the leader will fall with the blind
[43:37] because he's blind also they both fall
[43:41] into the ditch and so see their lives
[43:43] fall into sin they fall into unbelief
[43:47] that they fall into the ways of Satan
[43:49] into the powers of darkness rather than
[43:52] the powers of God amen
[43:55] they fall into the ditch of false
[43:57] religion parmie sobra have said there's
[44:02] no school there's no theologian there's
[44:04] no teachings of the Bible among any
[44:06] school that knows anything about it they
[44:08] cannot know nothing about it
[44:10] it's impossible for eleventh know
[44:12] anything about it God has hidden the
[44:13] senses of knowing him from the very
[44:15] elected teachers and everything else
[44:17] aren't you glad Church if you tried to
[44:20] pay a hundred thousand dollars to go get
[44:21] a doctor degree you would never catch
[44:24] the message that's being preached to you
[44:26] for free tonight
[44:28] because Jesus said it's hid from the
[44:31] eyes of the wise and prudent I feel bad
[44:34] for those men and women theology they
[44:36] pay a hundred thousand dollars or 89 you
[44:38] know fit twenty-five thousand dollars a
[44:40] year to get a school of theology and
[44:42] they're not even getting what we're
[44:44] getting tonight amen because we're
[44:47] getting the true Word of God the true
[44:49] revelation God doesn't give Jesus said
[44:52] God doesn't give it through the schools
[44:54] he only you get it from the Heavenly
[44:56] Father praise God amen
[44:59] but brother Han says see it's he said
[45:01] it's a personal individual affair with
[45:05] the person that Christ is revealed to
[45:07] them and if you say he's been revealed
[45:10] to me and then the life that Christ
[45:12] produced here in the Bible that same
[45:14] life isn't him does not produce itself
[45:17] in you then you've got the wrong
[45:18] revelation amen so if we got the right
[45:22] revelation it produces the same life of
[45:25] Jesus Christ now I know this is a lot of
[45:28] familiar things here but like I said I
[45:30] want to get you the same thoughts
[45:31] brother Branham said so you can hold
[45:33] them in your heart now
[45:37] he says by lack of this revelation so by
[45:40] the lack of revelation of the true
[45:42] message is why we have so many different
[45:44] divisions among us and so much mockery
[45:49] so much division among us is because the
[45:52] people lack that revelation they lack
[45:54] the revelation the teachers he says to
[45:57] see why are there divisions in our
[45:59] church at times why do other message
[46:01] churches have divisions it's because
[46:03] people don't have the revelation Amen
[46:06] because the revelation will not make you
[46:09] divided over sin for silly things the
[46:12] revelation of God will make you unite
[46:15] with other believers Amen hallelujah so
[46:20] perhaps that that's why we have
[46:21] divisions and mockery there's so much
[46:24] pretend religion is because there's a
[46:26] lack of revelation now I want to just
[46:32] read one more thing here where brother
[46:34] Branham says about Revelation and I'm
[46:36] skipping to the church ages book the
[46:39] brother banner says the importance of
[46:41] revelation by the spirit to a true
[46:44] believer can never be overemphasized
[46:48] revelation means more to you than you
[46:52] realize how many can say amen to that
[46:54] hallelujah I can never preach too much
[46:58] on how much we need more revelation you
[47:01] might yawn I might even yawn but I can
[47:05] preach on we need revelation we need God
[47:07] I could preach on that month after month
[47:09] year after year and I could never
[47:12] overemphasize it because revelation is
[47:15] God's will made known to you and that is
[47:20] what God wants God wants you and I to
[47:22] know his will and not only know it but
[47:25] he wants us to do it Damon and carry it
[47:28] out program says you can never
[47:31] overemphasize Revelation now he says
[47:37] this now then
[47:42] how Cain and he had a commandment but he
[47:45] didn't tell for the Revelator or didn't
[47:47] have a revelation so brother and said
[47:49] Cain couldn't get such a revelation like
[47:51] Abel had so he couldn't offer the right
[47:53] sacrifice it was a revelation from God
[47:56] that made the difference and gave Abel
[47:58] eternal life amen
[48:01] so that's how we'll be today Church the
[48:04] people who really live the message today
[48:06] will offer the right sacrifice what God
[48:10] really wants because they've got the
[48:12] right revelation some people would just
[48:15] be never able to really give the right
[48:18] sacrifice that God once because they
[48:20] don't have the revelation of it they
[48:22] hear preach I can preach it brother
[48:24] Keith Randolph brother Joe Adams
[48:26] whether cadre digs they can all preach
[48:28] the revelation to us or everyone else
[48:31] but only the elect will catch it only
[48:34] the ones that really have the the
[48:37] revelation of God will act upon it and
[48:39] do the will of God pigment Omaha that's
[48:43] right church it's so true and so we have
[48:47] to make sure our life looks just like
[48:49] Christ cuz Cain when he heard the the
[48:53] truth about the revelation he couldn't
[48:56] work it up to go off her blood and see
[49:00] that's what we've got it we've got to be
[49:02] able to have the revelation and not just
[49:05] know about it but we've got to work we
[49:07] got work it up but we just got to
[49:09] surrender ourselves right and do what
[49:12] God's Word actually says if we're not
[49:15] born again we got to find somewhere in
[49:17] the church or somewhere in our home to
[49:19] get alone with God and cry out to God
[49:21] until we get baptized with the Holy
[49:23] Ghost ain't ahead you just got to get a
[49:26] deal it praise God you just got to find
[49:29] that that that sacred place where you're
[49:32] fully cleaned out you're fully emptied
[49:34] out and then God can trust you with his
[49:36] word and then he can pour his Holy
[49:38] Spirit in your soul amen
[49:40] and then the way you'll know is what's
[49:42] your life after that that's how you know
[49:46] but see Cain couldn't get himself to
[49:48] offer that right sacrifice but Abel
[49:53] could able to offer the blood
[49:56] now what to read this I felt like God
[49:59] brought this story to me
[50:01] today I wasn't really planning on
[50:03] preaching it but it came to me you see
[50:08] the Bible says God or Christ came to
[50:11] seek and save that which was lost we
[50:15] were all lost in sin but God came to
[50:18] find us and we all remember the story of
[50:22] the Eagle right that was hatched in the
[50:24] chicken yard right we all remember that
[50:26] story and at some point in our life you
[50:31] know we were we were we wanted to be a
[50:34] Christian but we were around the wrong
[50:36] group
[50:37] praise God most of us I know I was for
[50:42] sure I was in many different churches
[50:44] where I thought they were egos but they
[50:46] were not but only those only the babes
[50:53] will the father reveal the revelation to
[50:56] and it's because they're the only ones
[50:59] that are truly Eagles right now one read
[51:04] this story this was from 2011 I don't
[51:06] know I've saved this on my on my
[51:08] Evernote I never preached it till
[51:10] tonight so it's been sitting there seven
[51:12] years and here it is today there is a a
[51:17] girl in New York and a little family New
[51:23] York it was her last name was white it
[51:25] was the white family and they had a
[51:27] little um they had a little baby girl
[51:30] and on August 4th 1987 I was almost 7
[51:34] years old these parents in New York took
[51:36] their little daughter her name was
[51:39] Carlina and they took her to a hospital
[51:42] because she had a fever at Harlem so
[51:45] Harlem's hospital they took her to the
[51:47] emergency room the the nurses took her
[51:51] back to be tested and in a couple hours
[51:54] they kept asking for the baby to come
[51:56] back and the baby never came back the
[51:59] baby had vanished and the mother said
[52:04] though she said I lost my daughter and
[52:07] she cried out to God and said a big part
[52:09] of
[52:09] my heart was just ripped away and they
[52:12] never found the baby that was in Harlem
[52:14] in 1987 they never found the baby but
[52:18] what had happened there was a sort of
[52:21] crazy woman who dressed up like a nurse
[52:23] and she could never have a baby and she
[52:25] would constantly walk in the hospital
[52:27] and she she was able somehow to sneak
[52:31] her way past the nurse's office and and
[52:35] she took that baby Carlino white and
[52:38] drove her from New York I believe down
[52:41] to Alabama if I'm not mistaken or
[52:45] Atlanta I'm sorry Atlanta and so for 23
[52:51] years the mother and father just were
[52:54] heart wrenched and and the baby was
[52:56] never found and and they never they
[52:58] never knew what happened to their
[53:00] daughter
[53:00] Carlina and they they went through all
[53:02] the government agencies no sign of her
[53:04] anywhere
[53:05] they had a sketch drawn of or what she
[53:07] might be and all these things well this
[53:10] whole time
[53:11] Carlina was growing up actually
[53:14] Connecticut first and then later Atlanta
[53:16] and her name given by her the woman who
[53:20] stole her was looks like nedra and so
[53:24] for 23 years
[53:25] this false mother raised this daughter
[53:29] Oh might has a happy ending Church I
[53:32] don't sad but it has that beheading a
[53:35] lot of them note but this one does and
[53:38] by the time you know as nedra grew up
[53:41] she just noticed and she look at the
[53:43] pictures the family pictures you know
[53:45] she'd be up on the wall there and she
[53:46] she'd see her mother no single single
[53:48] mother and she had a brother and then
[53:50] her picture and she always wondered how
[53:52] come my picture doesn't look like
[53:53] there's a face doesn't look like them
[53:56] I'm a different complexion I was a black
[53:58] woman she said I don't look anything
[54:00] like my mother and my brother and she
[54:03] said all these years you know my mom was
[54:04] kind to me but never had any heartfelt
[54:07] connection to me and she said you know
[54:11] growing up you know the the the brother
[54:15] which really wasn't her brother would
[54:17] get the love from the mother but she
[54:18] wouldn't and then when she was six
[54:22] you know she was fornicating and had a
[54:25] baby and she tried to get a driver's
[54:28] license so she could drive the baby well
[54:30] she went to her mother in there in
[54:32] Atlanta and said uh could I have my
[54:33] social security card and she didn't have
[54:35] one but she had some type of form so she
[54:37] took it to the Social Security office
[54:39] and took it there and said no that's a
[54:42] forgery you might get under arrest for
[54:45] that and so she left it and she said
[54:46] bother who cares bother with don't
[54:48] bother with it so she didn't never got a
[54:50] car and then she said there was no
[54:55] paperwork to follow up as there was no
[54:57] birth certificate no social social
[54:59] security card she was not able to get a
[55:02] driver's license and she saw no
[55:04] resemblance so she just grew suspicious
[55:08] and then all of a sudden she said I just
[55:12] had a feeling
[55:14] and I felt different people were raising
[55:18] me then should have been raising so she
[55:20] had all these signs all these years I
[55:22] don't feel love I don't look like them
[55:24] I don't really act like them they have
[55:26] really no proof that I'm one of them
[55:28] and she said all of a sudden she had a
[55:31] feeling and then she had it she had this
[55:34] feeling well I'm gonna look on websites
[55:36] and see if anyone was missing a child
[55:40] about my age so she went to the year of
[55:43] her birth and she spotted a photo of a
[55:47] baby and then put it next to a composite
[55:50] picture of her and she said that's me
[55:53] praise God
[55:55] so she took matters in their own hands
[55:57] she seated a mouth swab and sending in
[56:00] for the DNA with the DNA of the baby
[56:02] that they had the blood work and it
[56:04] matched and 23 years later she got
[56:08] reunited with her parents in Harlem now
[56:13] I'm I saying that I'm saying that
[56:16] because that's just like you and I
[56:18] praise God you and I I know I went into
[56:22] that I got saved but I never really felt
[56:24] like I was in the right place how come I
[56:28] want more of the weird when I'm going to
[56:30] church people who cuss and swear and
[56:32] want to go to movies that want to
[56:34] fornicate with women
[56:36] and they want to do all these evil
[56:37] things and they want to do rock and roll
[56:39] go to parties and drink it even before I
[56:41] knew the message I didn't want to go to
[56:44] parties like these guys they'd party on
[56:46] Saturday night and then come to church
[56:47] on Sunday morning in the college group
[56:50] and talk about being hungover
[56:51] and how come I was never comfortable
[56:53] with that how come they could do drugs
[56:55] and go so far but I could never go that
[56:57] far and then pretty soon it came to me I
[57:01] wasn't one of them I realized I was like
[57:05] that Eagle in the chicken yard amen
[57:08] I was predestinated there's something
[57:11] else amen hallelujah and I started
[57:15] searching and thank God my brother saw
[57:17] him and started searching he started
[57:19] searching there's got to be more to this
[57:20] and pretty soon he realized that he
[57:24] wasn't a denominational person but what
[57:26] he was what we were was true children of
[57:29] God our picture of every picture in
[57:33] God's photo album doesn't look like the
[57:35] foolish virgin it doesn't look like
[57:37] denominations it doesn't look like the
[57:40] mother harlot it looks like the life of
[57:42] Jesus amen
[57:43] we never looked like that we didn't act
[57:47] like that we don't feel comfortable like
[57:49] that see there's always something deep
[57:51] down inside of us that knew that God's
[57:54] Word is true and thank God that that
[57:57] hunger started searching right started
[58:00] hungry for more of God and thank God
[58:02] that he said his voice of his heavenly
[58:05] eagle mother right to make the Eagle
[58:08] scream so we could hear the Word of God
[58:10] respond to it and recognize who we are
[58:13] and come to our position in Christ amen
[58:16] amen
[58:18] hallelujah her exact words she said was
[58:22] this I'm so happy at the same time it's
[58:25] a funny feeling because everything's
[58:26] brand new it's like being born again and
[58:32] that's what the message is the message
[58:34] reveals who you are you're not just a
[58:37] church member
[58:38] you're not just somebody trying to be
[58:39] religious you are a child of God amen
[58:42] and you're supposed to act just like God
[58:45] amen you're supposed act just like God
[58:47] son Jesus and you're supposed to be men
[58:50] are you Jesus amen and it's like I'm
[58:53] born again oh thank God I am born again
[58:57] amen oh that's beautiful I just had to
[59:01] preach that tonight amen the deep calls
[59:03] to the deep and this is why there's so
[59:08] much division even the message or any
[59:10] church you go to is because there's a
[59:12] lack of revelation in other words people
[59:17] haven't received the love of the truth
[59:20] they don't really love the truth they
[59:22] can recognize it and intellectually say
[59:24] well that looks right but they don't
[59:26] actually love it they don't want to do
[59:29] the will of God amen
[59:31] now brother Branham quotes
[59:37] Ephesians chapter one which is why put
[59:39] on Facebook this morning verse what's
[59:41] read Ephesians 1 verse 1 Paul an apostle
[59:47] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[59:49] the Saints which are Ephesus and to the
[59:52] faithful in Christ Jesus program says
[59:55] how do you get into Jesus Christ by
[59:57] joining church no by a birth by one
[1:00:00] spirit first Corinthians 12 says were
[1:00:02] all baptized into one body amen so the
[1:00:07] faithful are in Christ Jesus is that
[1:00:11] right so much so that the next verse
[1:00:15] I'm sorry verse 4 according as he has
[1:00:18] chosen us in him so verse 1 says the
[1:00:22] faithful are in Christ and then verse 4
[1:00:25] says how you were in Christ you were
[1:00:27] chosen in his mind amen
[1:00:30] and because as we said on Sunday because
[1:00:32] he foreknew you would love him he chose
[1:00:35] you there he knew you there you were in
[1:00:38] him already but then you had to be
[1:00:40] manifest in a flesh body and then you
[1:00:42] had to say yes Lord since I was in you
[1:00:45] come live in me praise God amen
[1:00:48] it's you in Christ and it's Christ in
[1:00:51] you praise God
[1:00:52] amen it's both Christ is in me and I'm
[1:00:57] in Christ hallelujah
[1:00:59] that's exactly right because remember
[1:01:01] the mystery is Christ in you
[1:01:03] the hope of glory but you know it's more
[1:01:05] mysterious to us is how we were in him
[1:01:08] that's more mysterious it's wonderful to
[1:01:11] see Christ in us and Christ living his
[1:01:13] life and and helping us live a life of
[1:01:15] pure from the world but it's even more
[1:01:18] mysterious to think that I was in him
[1:01:20] before the foundation of the world oh
[1:01:22] thank you Jesus glory well Ram said what
[1:01:28] is the new birth
[1:01:29] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:32] personally to you not you join the
[1:01:36] church you shook a hand you've done
[1:01:37] something different you said a Creed you
[1:01:39] promised to live by Khoda rules but
[1:01:41] Christ the Bible he's the word that was
[1:01:43] revealed to you no matter what anybody
[1:01:45] says what takes place
[1:01:47] it's Christ no matter what a pastor
[1:01:49] priest whatever might be its Christ in
[1:01:51] you and that is the revelation that the
[1:01:54] church was built upon amen you like that
[1:01:58] what is the revelation what is the Holy
[1:02:01] Ghost he says the revelation of Jesus
[1:02:03] Christ personally to you amen
[1:02:06] I says it again what is it it's Christ
[1:02:10] being revealed and he is the word and
[1:02:12] when the word is revealed is expresses
[1:02:15] himself that was God's purpose for Jesus
[1:02:17] Christ who were express himself to take
[1:02:19] his own laws and live by his own laws Oh
[1:02:23] glory and fulfills law by death and if a
[1:02:29] man says he's born again and try to take
[1:02:32] try to place these promises of Christ in
[1:02:34] the last days to some other age making
[1:02:37] him Christ yesterday but not today then
[1:02:39] that man or that person has in a
[1:02:41] delusion by Satan amen now Church we've
[1:02:46] got it we got to make sure this doesn't
[1:02:48] get to us and for example how does get
[1:02:51] to us it gets to us when we don't have
[1:02:52] faith to believe for Supernatural right
[1:02:56] like we can all pray like on Sunday we
[1:02:59] prayed for supernatural but we've really
[1:03:01] got to believe it's going to happen and
[1:03:03] that takes a revelation because mother
[1:03:05] and said you can't accept your healing
[1:03:08] until God reveals that you're healed so
[1:03:11] we've got to ask God and seek God for
[1:03:13] revelation what is your will show me
[1:03:16] your will let it be revealed to me
[1:03:17] show me perfect faith so I can have it
[1:03:21] amen that's right
[1:03:27] but RAM said it's Christ expressing
[1:03:31] himself in the individual whether he's
[1:03:33] intellectual whether he don't know his
[1:03:35] ABCs praise the Lord
[1:03:39] he says the new birth is Christ is a
[1:03:43] revelation God has revealed to you this
[1:03:47] great mystery and that's a new birth he
[1:03:52] says now what are you going to do when
[1:03:54] you get all that group together where
[1:03:56] the revelation is perfectly in harmony
[1:03:59] and God expressing it through his word
[1:04:02] by the same actions the same things that
[1:04:05] he did making the word manifest oh if
[1:04:08] the church only knew its position it
[1:04:10] will one day then the rapture will go
[1:04:13] when it knows what it is I don't know if
[1:04:18] you caught that I hope you did but when
[1:04:19] the the Holy Spirit is flowing in
[1:04:22] harmony with every single person when
[1:04:25] everybody's obeying all the Word of God
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] not just some people but everybody in
[1:04:31] the church everybody the bride of Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ is in a harmony with the Holy
[1:04:35] Spirit and letting God's Spirit have his
[1:04:38] way in their life he said then they're
[1:04:40] gonna get together and then the rapture
[1:04:42] is gonna go out of there yeah when we
[1:04:47] all want the same thing when Christ is
[1:04:49] all we want well we're all bang Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ then the rapture is gonna go
[1:04:56] hallelujah so may I just say Lord I will
[1:05:00] do my part until everybody else does
[1:05:02] their part now can you be patient wait
[1:05:05] to everybody else gets their part that's
[1:05:08] what we need to do and we'd have a
[1:05:09] burden to go send brother Simon or send
[1:05:11] a missionary brother cragger whoever we
[1:05:13] can send go find them go ahead and let
[1:05:17] those people find the Christ that we
[1:05:19] love let them experience Christ's love
[1:05:21] and may they give Christ preeminence
[1:05:26] when this great revelation the reveal
[1:05:29] mystery is made known to you then you
[1:05:32] denounce all the things in the world
[1:05:36] let's go to first John 3:1 that he'll
[1:05:38] keep pulling up first John 3:1 now I
[1:05:47] hope you see this here and I'm sure we
[1:05:51] can all testify to it I think maybe
[1:05:54] sister Connie or sister Beatrice maybe
[1:05:57] serve the Lord the longest here but
[1:05:58] hopefully I'll get a good hearty Amen
[1:06:00] from them in a little bit here but
[1:06:02] longer you serve Jesus Christ the more
[1:06:06] hope that you'll possess and the more
[1:06:10] you'll purify yourself the longer you
[1:06:12] serve Jesus Christ that's what the Bible
[1:06:15] says first John 3:1 what we hold what
[1:06:17] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[1:06:19] upon us that we should be called the
[1:06:22] sons of God therefore the world knoweth
[1:06:25] not because it knew him not beloved now
[1:06:29] are we the sons of God and it doth not
[1:06:31] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:06:34] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:06:36] like him for we shall see him as he is
[1:06:38] now here it is and every man that had
[1:06:41] this hope in himself purify himself even
[1:06:46] as he is pure so if you have the hope to
[1:06:51] see Jesus and have a body like his body
[1:06:54] the Bible said you'll purify yourself as
[1:06:59] we showed on Sunday of all the people
[1:07:01] that have come to our church and I
[1:07:03] preached you and I prayed for and you
[1:07:05] have prayed for and you have you've
[1:07:06] tried to help a witness to you and I
[1:07:09] cannot make them purify themselves nor
[1:07:12] can they make you purify yourself it has
[1:07:15] to be you choosing by the revelation of
[1:07:18] God to purify yourself it's an
[1:07:21] individual choice it's an individual
[1:07:23] conviction it's an individual affair how
[1:07:27] I'd like to just help how do I like just
[1:07:30] push a button and everybody in here
[1:07:31] would be in one at one corridor the Holy
[1:07:33] Spirit and everybody will do click
[1:07:35] everything I preached or everything the
[1:07:36] preach is free click everybody does it
[1:07:38] Oh that'd be glorious
[1:07:41] but that's not the way God set it up
[1:07:44] because God wanted to give everybody
[1:07:45] free moral agency God want to give
[1:07:48] everybody a chance God didn't want to
[1:07:51] force people to love him but God knows
[1:07:53] the true elect will love him and they
[1:07:56] will give him preeminence and they will
[1:07:58] get in harmony with the holy spirit you
[1:08:01] see if you have this hope that you're
[1:08:05] gonna see Jesus you'll purify yourself
[1:08:07] you won't allow yourself to get more
[1:08:09] worldly or allow yourself to get more
[1:08:12] defeated and more discouraged and more
[1:08:14] depressed or more doubtful or all these
[1:08:17] things you won't allow yourself you'll
[1:08:19] say Oh God's called me too high on that
[1:08:21] forgive me Lord purify my heart I'm
[1:08:24] coming back bring me back to my first
[1:08:26] love a man from Africa texted me
[1:08:29] yesterday or was it Monday and he said
[1:08:31] how do you keep your first love brother
[1:08:33] Jes I said well you gotta Jesus said you
[1:08:34] got to go back to your first works he
[1:08:37] said I used to be so on fire for the
[1:08:38] message I lost it I said then you've got
[1:08:41] to put God first you're doing something
[1:08:43] now that you used to not do and I said
[1:08:47] for me it was getting up early I've got
[1:08:49] to get up earlier to make sure I spend
[1:08:50] more time with God so I can read and
[1:08:53] study and pray and I said that's how I
[1:08:55] got my first love back and he said
[1:08:57] praise the Lord hallelujah god bless you
[1:08:58] Pastor he said see just he just he was
[1:09:02] at first so kind of like a young
[1:09:04] Christian and now he's starting to feel
[1:09:06] that love fall away and so God if that's
[1:09:09] God and say Lord reveal to me how I got
[1:09:13] to get my first love back yes see hope
[1:09:18] produces purity now where does Hope come
[1:09:21] from go back to Roman's 5 here's where
[1:09:24] hope comes from Romans 5 verse 1 so if
[1:09:30] you have real hope you purify your own
[1:09:33] self
[1:09:35] now the preaching of the pastor the
[1:09:37] preaching of the advantages will help ya
[1:09:39] but it's really it's you choosing to
[1:09:41] believe that preaching and then you
[1:09:43] purify yourself verse 1 therefore being
[1:09:47] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:09:48] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:09:51] whom also we have access by faith into
[1:09:53] this grace
[1:09:54] we're and we stand and rejoice in the
[1:09:57] hope of the glory of God and not only so
[1:10:00] but we glory in tribulations also
[1:10:02] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:10:04] patience and patience experience and
[1:10:08] experience hope and hope maketh not
[1:10:14] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[1:10:16] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:10:18] which is given unto us again so we just
[1:10:22] read that if you have hope you'll purify
[1:10:25] yourself well with this hope come from
[1:10:27] it comes from tribulation and then
[1:10:30] patience and then you can experience and
[1:10:33] then you get home and then you can
[1:10:35] purify yourself amen hallelujah so we
[1:10:39] should go back and say thank God for
[1:10:41] tribulations because this trial is going
[1:10:44] to produce eventually after time it's
[1:10:46] going to produce Hulk and then it's
[1:10:48] going to produce me purifying myself not
[1:10:52] getting more worldly not flirting with
[1:10:54] the world but getting more pure getting
[1:10:56] more sincere and if that's the case the
[1:10:59] longer you serve God the more hope you
[1:11:02] should have and the more purity you
[1:11:03] should have well glory I don't know yeah
[1:11:07] because you've gone through more trials
[1:11:11] you've got you have more experience more
[1:11:13] patience yeah at least you ought to
[1:11:16] right then you should have real hope
[1:11:19] then she have more of a purity with
[1:11:22] Christ praise God now program tells us
[1:11:31] the message will be mocked and scorned
[1:11:34] he said Jesus was called Beelzebub
[1:11:36] Paul said heresy part but Griffith told
[1:11:39] Paul you're in heresy and he said the
[1:11:41] way you call heresy is the way I worship
[1:11:44] the God of my father's so brother Adam
[1:11:47] tells us the message will always be
[1:11:49] scorned mocked it'll always be called
[1:11:51] heresy did you know when I was in the
[1:11:55] denomination and I first came in the
[1:11:56] message my turn interion friends gave me
[1:11:59] some reading they gave me a chapter on
[1:12:01] the journeys and this pastor said you
[1:12:03] read this and you understand the Trinity
[1:12:05] well I read it he's like 20 pages
[1:12:08] at the end of the chapter it literally
[1:12:11] says and I can show it to you next
[1:12:12] Sunday if you won it literally says it
[1:12:15] finishes like this some something along
[1:12:17] these lines
[1:12:18] since the doctrine of the Trinity cannot
[1:12:20] be proven by scripture alone we have to
[1:12:24] just accept it and then it quotes at a
[1:12:27] church father who said try to understand
[1:12:30] it you'll lose your mind try to deny it
[1:12:34] you'll lose your soul so when I'm
[1:12:37] thinking this is what the guy told me
[1:12:39] this is gonna be proof for the Trinity
[1:12:40] the proof is fear scare tactic if you
[1:12:46] don't follow along with our with our
[1:12:48] denomination with our belief you're
[1:12:51] gonna lose your soul if you go against
[1:12:53] the Trinity you're gonna lose your soul
[1:12:55] even though there's no specific
[1:12:56] scripture for it you're gonna go to hell
[1:12:59] if you don't receive it does that sound
[1:13:01] like God's loving spirit or does that
[1:13:03] sound like the devil oh and I knew I
[1:13:07] said my how could God use fear and no
[1:13:12] scriptural backing to try to get me
[1:13:13] saved and I said the opposite must be
[1:13:18] true those who don't add to the Word of
[1:13:23] God those who just believe the Word of
[1:13:25] God about God have the revelation of God
[1:13:28] and God will save them amen it's the
[1:13:32] action the opposite you lose your soul
[1:13:34] if you add to the Word of God and you
[1:13:36] don't repent but how I've been mocked
[1:13:44] how I've been how I've been forsaken I
[1:13:47] can say that for sure
[1:13:48] I've been forsaken by all my friends
[1:13:51] before head but like Jesus said now I
[1:13:53] got a hundred times more friends that's
[1:13:57] exactly right I know I could go to at
[1:14:00] this time I could go to Napoleon
[1:14:02] I could go to Lima I could go to album
[1:14:05] Pennsylvania any church that I preached
[1:14:08] for I go to North Carolina any church
[1:14:09] I'd preach more if I said can my family
[1:14:11] of nine stay at your house just for one
[1:14:13] night
[1:14:13] I know I know they'd say yes that's what
[1:14:17] Jesus said those who forsake the wave
[1:14:20] will have a hundredfold
[1:14:22] in this life and in the life to come hey
[1:14:25] man how do you know because every time
[1:14:28] you know every time I have a baby
[1:14:30] somebody will send me a gift like the
[1:14:31] Albion church sent us a big huge gift
[1:14:34] after we had that seventh baby I don't
[1:14:37] ever even see them anymore but because
[1:14:39] of their love they just send blessings
[1:14:42] you see Jesus is not lying if we forsake
[1:14:46] everything God will give us a hundred
[1:14:48] times more amen hallelujah that's
[1:14:55] exactly right so let them call me a
[1:14:58] heretic let them call me a cult member
[1:15:00] let them call me a fanatic one thing's
[1:15:03] for sure I am a fanatic for Jesus Christ
[1:15:05] in this Bible and I'm not an occult
[1:15:08] I'm in the Church of the Living God amen
[1:15:12] hallelujah
[1:15:15] that's exactly right but RAM said it's
[1:15:19] Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in
[1:15:22] you that he has the preeminence that he
[1:15:26] might express his words and anything
[1:15:30] that he's promised in these last days he
[1:15:32] can bring it to pass through his body as
[1:15:34] he's working it's just exactly the Word
[1:15:37] of God made manifest we had a guest
[1:15:40] speaker at our school come in on Tuesday
[1:15:43] morning we had a meeting before school
[1:15:44] at 8:10 a.m. and she was talking about
[1:15:49] diversity she's like you don't have to
[1:15:51] agree with everybody but you got to be
[1:15:53] respectful and I'm like yeah that's true
[1:15:55] and the example she leaves she said she
[1:15:58] said obviously she's a nice black woman
[1:16:00] real sweet woman she said she said I'm
[1:16:02] black I go to church and she said I
[1:16:04] never wear slacks and all the women are
[1:16:06] like and I'm like and she said yeah I'm
[1:16:14] that you'll never see me in pants she
[1:16:15] said just my conviction to wear pants
[1:16:17] I'm started to wear skirts sorry not to
[1:16:19] wear pants and then she said like me she
[1:16:21] said I don't ever put up a Christmas
[1:16:23] tree no everybody's like and I'm like
[1:16:26] whoo and she said I don't even celebrate
[1:16:30] Halloween I'm like what what's going on
[1:16:34] here
[1:16:35] so afterwards I walk up I said I want to
[1:16:37] thank you her name was was her name now
[1:16:40] I can't remember I have to look it up
[1:16:42] it's AMA that was texting her and I said
[1:16:44] I just want to thank you for sharing
[1:16:45] that I said that's exactly how I feel I
[1:16:47] said my wife and daughters never wear
[1:16:49] pants and she said what she said are you
[1:16:52] a Christian
[1:16:52] she said what are you I said I don't
[1:16:54] take any name I said as I literally said
[1:16:56] this I said I'm a Christian baptized
[1:16:58] with the Holy Ghost and she said glory
[1:16:59] to God right there in the flybridge on
[1:17:02] Tuesday ha ha ha and she said I've got
[1:17:06] to come to your church she said I said
[1:17:08] all right let's see if she comes they
[1:17:10] all tell me that you know only a few who
[1:17:13] come like that Donnie girl last year
[1:17:14] came that was nice to her Danny girl
[1:17:16] that black girl came last year that was
[1:17:18] really sweet of her we had that in
[1:17:19] common - that is a different woman but
[1:17:24] see she recognized that and she saw that
[1:17:29] truth there and so she's letting you
[1:17:32] know in her life she's letting Christ
[1:17:34] have preeminence in her life and I I
[1:17:37] feel like this church that's gotta God
[1:17:39] brings people into your life God brings
[1:17:42] people into my life to let them know
[1:17:43] that there's truth out there and if
[1:17:46] they're really hungry and I gave her my
[1:17:48] ID text her our church website and
[1:17:50] everything like that
[1:17:50] I said they're really hungry and they
[1:17:52] really can sense the presence of God
[1:17:54] then they'll grab ahold of the hook
[1:17:56] praise God
[1:17:57] but if they're not ordained of God then
[1:18:00] that they'll just recognize that but see
[1:18:03] God places these peoples in our lives
[1:18:05] that's the same thing that happened like
[1:18:07] with vane you know how Bank came in the
[1:18:09] message I was sitting at a computer in a
[1:18:11] University of Akron computer lab and
[1:18:14] here was not banging but it was his
[1:18:16] friend Devon and I'm doing clip R I'm
[1:18:19] copying and pasting clipart about the
[1:18:20] cross and I'm making a Bible said I
[1:18:22] should have been studying but I said I
[1:18:24] was studying the Word of God and I put
[1:18:27] all these clip parts of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:18:28] doing a Bible study on the Godhead and
[1:18:30] the divine looks over he looks at me he
[1:18:33] kind of gets in my personal space I
[1:18:34] don't even know him from Adam you know
[1:18:36] he says hey cool what are you doing over
[1:18:38] there
[1:18:38] you got you you serve Jesus I'm like
[1:18:42] yeah you want to come to a Bible study
[1:18:44] if you're heard about the water bats and
[1:18:45] he's like yeah I like to come to Bible
[1:18:46] study so he comes
[1:18:49] he got baptized he invited vague hey
[1:18:51] he's like man you got to come this Bible
[1:18:52] study he got baptized and so all these
[1:18:55] people started getting baptized were
[1:18:57] slowly one by one they started falling
[1:18:59] away but the elect of God caught it
[1:19:02] God had a way to get them there and God
[1:19:05] had something to hold them there that's
[1:19:07] the anchor of his word amen so same
[1:19:11] thing with this woman this woman's
[1:19:12] already heard more about God with the
[1:19:15] the Halloween the Christmas trees and
[1:19:17] the the Holy Ghost and the the the
[1:19:21] clothing she said why do your women why
[1:19:23] do you do the clothing I said because at
[1:19:24] deuteronomy 22:5 she said would she's
[1:19:28] already heard more about the message
[1:19:30] than d'von heard all's Devon heard was
[1:19:33] water baptism and he went to come SOC
[1:19:36] Church it comes out to God's
[1:19:38] predestination she's already heard more
[1:19:41] than what Devon heard and that brought
[1:19:43] in bang and members of his family into
[1:19:45] the church God wanted to save them God
[1:19:48] wanted to pull those rainbow trout out
[1:19:50] of the Akron rivers and God did it and
[1:19:53] so he must keep fishing we must keep
[1:19:55] sharing the gospel and all that the
[1:19:58] father has given me will come but we've
[1:19:59] got to open up our mouths you know I was
[1:20:01] having a mind battle should I go talk to
[1:20:03] the woman I almost walked out and I said
[1:20:04] no I better go talk to her because this
[1:20:07] is gonna be the last time I was gonna
[1:20:08] see her I knew it was the last time I
[1:20:09] saw at least better let her know and
[1:20:11] know I mean everybody was tired it was
[1:20:13] Tuesday we just got off Thanksgiving
[1:20:14] break nobody was interacting with her
[1:20:16] talk at all you know I'm like well I
[1:20:19] guess I'm better and something just
[1:20:22] moved me to do that hopefully she'll
[1:20:24] come maybe Sunday we'll see I'll send
[1:20:26] another Texas see if she'll come if not
[1:20:27] that's okay because I've already shared
[1:20:29] more with her than what I've even shared
[1:20:31] with Devon and bang at the beginning and
[1:20:33] so see God wants us to hold that message
[1:20:37] out there and not back away and not be
[1:20:41] scared to share it and not call
[1:20:43] ourselves a denomination but call
[1:20:45] ourselves Holy Ghost filled Christians
[1:20:47] see because Christ has the preeminence
[1:20:51] now let me close with this here give me
[1:20:53] about 15-20 minutes here
[1:21:00] close of this thought let me make sure I
[1:21:04] got a right thing here okay
[1:21:08] no you remember the threefold mystery
[1:21:10] but have said the whole plan of God is a
[1:21:13] three-fold mystery the first God wanted
[1:21:16] to express himself as a son and have
[1:21:19] preeminence and his son that parts
[1:21:21] completed part one is done we're on part
[1:21:24] two part two is God wants to get
[1:21:27] preeminence in his bride the bride for
[1:21:31] his son Jesus the third part is that
[1:21:34] Jesus and his bride back to the Garden
[1:21:37] of Eden we'd say the Millennium or the
[1:21:39] New Jerusalem so here's our brother
[1:21:44] branham ends the Sermon on the crisis
[1:21:47] the mystery of God revealed he said this
[1:21:50] is God's great mystery of love expressed
[1:21:54] that God and man became one see the
[1:21:58] whole thing is God and man one God and
[1:22:05] man was one there and God and man is one
[1:22:08] here what is it being filled with his
[1:22:10] spirit him having the preeminence --is
[1:22:13] that was God's achievement
[1:22:17] that's God's purpose to do that that he
[1:22:20] might be in Christ and Christ in us and
[1:22:22] all of us together one the Holy Spirit
[1:22:26] same thing it reviewed at the Christ
[1:22:28] reveals it here the supernatural created
[1:22:32] power
[1:22:33] oh thank you Lord but may have said it
[1:22:38] is not a group although we want everyone
[1:22:40] in this church to be safe filled with
[1:22:41] the Holy Ghost it may be but brother
[1:22:43] have said it's not a group it's a
[1:22:45] personal vindication of the of a
[1:22:48] pregnant out of God feel what the Holy
[1:22:52] Ghost
[1:22:53] so surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:22:55] about anything else I don't envy my wife
[1:22:58] when I see you're pregnant I don't
[1:22:59] really envy her it's got to be very
[1:23:01] uncomfortable it looks extremely
[1:23:04] uncomfortable but spiritually that's
[1:23:08] what you and I are we are spiritually
[1:23:12] pregnant Christians how many can say
[1:23:13] amen to that

[1:23:21] life of God is growing in you Amen I
[1:23:24] don't know yet and it's slowly over time

[1:23:36] off my wife my wife half the card I
[1:23:37] think there's three trimesters is that
[1:23:39] right is that right three trimesters in
[1:23:42] pregnancy I think so I could be wrong
[1:23:45] Sarah okay thank you in that striking
[1:23:48] you got to go through three trimesters
[1:23:49] until you get the birth
[1:23:54] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:23:57] of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:24:00] God's life God's Spirit is working in
[1:24:04] you changing you it's growing the Bible
[1:24:08] says growing Grace and the knowledge of
[1:24:10] the Lord you're growing and it's all
[1:24:14] pointing to something it's like this
[1:24:16] unknown day an hour of of a birth life
[1:24:19] is going to come you don't know you
[1:24:21] can't make it come there's all these
[1:24:22] ideas how you can make it come that's
[1:24:24] like people today well I gotta be at the
[1:24:26] altar or I gotta be crying or if I'm not
[1:24:29] speaking in tongues I didn't get it or
[1:24:30] if I'm not shouting if I'm not dancing I
[1:24:33] didn't get it
[1:24:33] they've got all these different ideas
[1:24:35] and they've got to just forget about
[1:24:36] that and just say I'm just gonna wait
[1:24:39] and in God's time God will do it I'll be
[1:24:41] born again
[1:24:42] I don't know when there's a life because
[1:24:44] I know what it's like not to have a life
[1:24:46] there I'll recognize new life amen
[1:24:49] identity huh we don't tell God how it's
[1:24:53] done we don't tell where God is done we
[1:24:55] just say God do it in my life bring
[1:24:59] forth this life in me let me produce new
[1:25:04] life hey man
[1:25:06] Laurie Levin says you're pregnant out of
[1:25:10] God filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:12] so surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:25:15] about anything else it's the Holy Spirit
[1:25:18] living his life pulsating through him
[1:25:21] showing the personal vindication of the
[1:25:23] word itself expressing itself to the
[1:25:26] people and to the world
[1:25:31] he goes back to this pregnant for this
[1:25:33] pregnant thought he said the pregnant
[1:25:35] person with the seed of God the word in
[1:25:39] their manifesting itself so surrendered
[1:25:41] to the will of God that the word and the
[1:25:43] word alone manifests itself in this
[1:25:46] person the prisoner to an individual a
[1:25:49] man you and I are to manifest the word
[1:25:53] and the word alone how many like these
[1:25:56] quotes from mother brand I don't know
[1:25:58] his briefs like this but I think I think
[1:25:59] you like it I love it I love how he puts
[1:26:02] it you know the prophet of God because
[1:26:04] it all lines up with the Bible but Ram
[1:26:08] said now my church he says know your
[1:26:10] church as my church or denomination has
[1:26:12] nothing to do with it it's an individual
[1:26:14] one person now listen he says is all
[1:26:17] hell is against this teaching all hell
[1:26:21] is against this truth but it is the
[1:26:24] truth amen
[1:26:26] I didn't know yeah tonight Church it's
[1:26:29] hard to believe but all of hell is
[1:26:31] against you receiving more revelation of
[1:26:34] Christ amen
[1:26:35] in other words Satan is going to do
[1:26:37] everything you can do to try to persuade
[1:26:40] you not to hear from God not to receive
[1:26:42] from God but you've got to deny that
[1:26:45] you've got the you got to put aside that
[1:26:48] unbelief or the tiredness or fear or or
[1:26:51] or revenge or whatever's on your harder
[1:26:54] or greed or whatever it is you've got to
[1:26:56] push beyond that and say God forgive me
[1:26:58] of that help me to get this out of my
[1:27:00] mind and help me to hear from heaven
[1:27:02] tonight amen it has to be that way go to
[1:27:09] 2nd Timothy I just got a scripture on my
[1:27:12] heart he said all hell is against this
[1:27:17] truth look at 12 I'm sorry
[1:27:24] Timothy 3:12 I didn't tell you the
[1:27:26] chapter second Timothy 3:12 yay all that

[1:27:51] friends you suffer persecution it's
[1:27:58] happened to me verse 13 but here it is
[1:28:01] this is my program can say all hell is
[1:28:04] against this teaching but evil men and
[1:28:10] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[1:28:12] deceiving and being deceived to see
[1:28:19] there it is right there
[1:28:19] are we gonna have less deceivers or more
[1:28:23] deceivers more well that proves it right
[1:28:25] there all hell is against this truth
[1:28:28] because there gonna be more people that
[1:28:30] are more deceptive to make it sound like
[1:28:33] the messenger make it sound like it's
[1:28:35] good but it's actually a lie
[1:28:37] evil seducers wax worse and worse
[1:28:41] praise God go to Matthew 24 Matthew 24
[1:28:53] all hell is against the message now we
[1:29:00] know Matthew 24 24 hopefully you got it
[1:29:02] memorized in your heart I went I've been
[1:29:05] listening to Christ the mystery and also
[1:29:07] anoint when's the end times such
[1:29:08] powerful messages verse 24 for there
[1:29:11] shall arise false Christ's and false
[1:29:14] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:29:17] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:29:19] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:29:21] elect amen now there's another
[1:29:26] I want to look for real quick there it
[1:29:33] is go down to verse 12 and because
[1:29:39] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:29:41] shall wax cold but he that shall endure
[1:29:45] unto the end shall be saved what is
[1:29:48] Satan trying to do today tonight what is
[1:29:51] Satan trying to do all hell is trying to
[1:29:54] get you to stop loving God he wants to
[1:29:58] he wants to kind of decrease your love
[1:30:01] valve right God's trying to get your
[1:30:04] love valve all the way open so your love
[1:30:06] for God can just flow out but Satan's
[1:30:10] trying to turn down your love valve
[1:30:14] decrease love praise the Lord Church
[1:30:19] when you can find somebody who really
[1:30:20] loves you despite if they if they make a
[1:30:24] mistake
[1:30:25] maybe yet you still love them now you
[1:30:27] found a real Christian right there
[1:30:30] someone that can really love you because
[1:30:33] all hell is gonna try to take all your
[1:30:35] love away for other people are you with
[1:30:39] me all hell's against the message it's
[1:30:43] trying to take away your love for God
[1:30:45] and your love for other people
[1:30:47] amen and then it's gonna try it now it's
[1:30:53] going to always do that it's always
[1:30:54] gonna give you a perverted love where
[1:30:56] you'll now love other things more than
[1:30:58] God and more than God's people and more
[1:31:00] than the word you'll fall in love with a
[1:31:03] presence on social media you'll fall in
[1:31:06] love with movies you'll fall in love
[1:31:07] with movie stars fall in love with
[1:31:11] someone other than your husband or wife
[1:31:12] right that's what Satan is trying to do
[1:31:15] we must look and see what do we love
[1:31:18] because all of Hell is against the
[1:31:21] message of the hour didn't Jesus say
[1:31:26] though
[1:31:26] revelation shall overcome all the gates
[1:31:29] of hell the gates of hell what the gates
[1:31:34] of hell that the gates of hell are the
[1:31:37] strongest demonic powers right because
[1:31:40] the judges sat in the gates in the Bible
[1:31:44] so the Bible says the gates of Hell will
[1:31:48] not prevail against you the very
[1:31:51] strongest of demons amen are you a
[1:31:53] theater ticket the very strongest of
[1:31:56] demons will try to come against you but
[1:31:59] if you've got the revelation of who
[1:32:01] Jesus really is he is the Messiah he is
[1:32:06] God's promised one he is the mighty God
[1:32:09] the everlasting father the Prince of my
[1:32:12] peace amen
[1:32:13] he's the one that gives me my peace amen
[1:32:16] he's the Prince of my peace when you
[1:32:19] have the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:32:21] really is then the strongest demons
[1:32:24] cannot overcome you a name I don't care
[1:32:28] what temptation they put in front of you
[1:32:30] on your phone or on this computer screen
[1:32:32] or writing your president kaler web
[1:32:34] temptation they will not overcome you
[1:32:36] because you know that not only do you
[1:32:38] know Christ but Christ is and you praise
[1:32:41] God amen so how you going to compromise
[1:32:44] on Christ when Christ is inside of you
[1:32:47] you can't amen hallelujah all hell's
[1:32:53] against his teaching I didn't even put
[1:32:55] this on a quote and hang it up in my
[1:32:56] house or something like that because
[1:32:58] when I get down I got to remember the
[1:33:00] reason this is so hard is because all
[1:33:01] hell is fighting me I've got a bigger
[1:33:04] battle than the the Baptists and
[1:33:06] Presbyterians I've got a bigger battle
[1:33:09] than the Catholics course they're all
[1:33:10] full of a cage of unclean and hateful
[1:33:11] bird they're the ones battling us I've
[1:33:15] got to remember the reason this is so
[1:33:17] hard
[1:33:17] is because all of the hell is against me
[1:33:20] but I must remember that because Christ
[1:33:22] is in me I'm more than a conqueror in
[1:33:24] Christ Jesus and actually go from
[1:33:26] tribulation to patients to experience to
[1:33:30] hope and that sure make me purify myself
[1:33:33] and get ready for Jesus's appearing amen
[1:33:37] because he's revealed himself to me he's
[1:33:40] husband he's my lord he's my god he's my
[1:33:43] Savior and I'm preparing myself because
[1:33:46] I'm gonna live eternally with him
[1:33:51] hallelujah amen
[1:33:55] thank you Jesus
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:58] but man says see flesh and blood never
[1:34:01] really revealed to Peter but upon this
[1:34:03] revelation the called out group I'll
[1:34:05] build my church in the hem oh thank you
[1:34:10] Lord and all the gates of Hell will
[1:34:12] never be able to withstand it all the
[1:34:16] council that word gate means councils
[1:34:18] all the councils of all those demon
[1:34:20] powers that spiritual wickedness in high
[1:34:23] places think about a church those demons
[1:34:26] that are holding back your prayers right
[1:34:30] demons were holding back Daniels prayers
[1:34:33] until Michael Cain and then hold that
[1:34:36] demon off so then the other word could
[1:34:38] come down and deliver the answer to his
[1:34:39] prayers amen
[1:34:43] even though those demons up there you've
[1:34:46] still got confidence you know you're
[1:34:48] fighting spiritual things you know you
[1:34:50] have some prayer you felt like God heard
[1:34:52] you you felt like you had a revelation
[1:34:54] that God was going to do something or or
[1:34:56] help you in some way you don't give up
[1:34:59] because you know you had an experience
[1:35:00] with God God revealed it to you and
[1:35:03] you're just waiting for the time when
[1:35:05] the gates of hell's come crashing down
[1:35:07] oh yeah that's what I'm just waiting for
[1:35:11] see my loved ones safe to see this
[1:35:13] church have a real book of Acts and
[1:35:15] experience with more people so we can
[1:35:17] see more of God in our myths and we can
[1:35:20] be the fulfillment of the latter rain ha
[1:35:23] ha I enjoy what we have now but I'm
[1:35:27] looking for more in the latter rain
[1:35:29] praise God and I pray and I've cried out
[1:35:32] to God I've confessed that I've cried
[1:35:34] I've wept I've asked God for all that
[1:35:36] and I'm just waiting until it's the time
[1:35:39] for God to do it
[1:35:40] and while I'm waiting I'm not going to
[1:35:42] give up because I know there's battles
[1:35:44] going on up there but greater is He
[1:35:46] that's in me than he that's in the world
[1:35:48] amen I'm building my church
[1:35:54] in them the church is being built in you
[1:35:58] tonight can you say amen to that I am
[1:36:02] the church that's the brother James
[1:36:03] browning told me before we started the
[1:36:05] church I said what what advice do you
[1:36:06] give me before I start the church he
[1:36:08] said you are the church he said you
[1:36:11] can't expect anyone else to do anything
[1:36:12] you know they will God's with them but
[1:36:15] you said you've got to be the church so
[1:36:16] I found that to be true I am the church
[1:36:19] and it's a revelation to me no one's got
[1:36:22] to beg me to come to church and some
[1:36:24] lead and preach or pray no one's got to
[1:36:26] beg that to me because it's a revelation
[1:36:28] it's what God called me to do amen
[1:36:32] that's what we were praying for our
[1:36:34] sister you know on Sunday and I'm sure
[1:36:36] we all desire prayer for that we all
[1:36:38] desire revelation we all want to know
[1:36:40] what God has called us to do and then we
[1:36:42] can do it but we need to know what he's
[1:36:44] called us to do and once it's clear then
[1:36:47] there's no more doubts amen
[1:36:49] hallelujah then there's no more
[1:36:52] uncertain sounds there there's no more
[1:36:54] wondering about it God once we're
[1:36:56] convinced then we're concerned about it
[1:37:00] amen hallelujah I'm convinced God's
[1:37:04] called me to Akron that's why I'm
[1:37:06] concerned about every service amen
[1:37:09] I hope you are too once you're convinced
[1:37:13] it's God's revelation then you're
[1:37:15] concerned about it then you want to do
[1:37:17] something about every time the Saints
[1:37:19] gather and every day you want to pray
[1:37:21] for the different Saints in the church
[1:37:22] you want to have a desire you want to
[1:37:24] see God in our myths you want to see
[1:37:26] more of Jesus Christ amen
[1:37:28] because the church is in you amen let me
[1:37:32] close with this verb and says not one
[1:37:36] hair of your heads or Paris Jesus says
[1:37:37] you are mine I'll raise you up in the
[1:37:39] last day I'll give you eternal life and
[1:37:41] raise them up at the last day there it
[1:37:43] is the revelation not them but him an
[1:37:46] individual not a group and individual an
[1:37:50] individual all hell is against it but
[1:37:53] it's mystery is only revealed to his
[1:37:55] beloved bride that's the only one that
[1:37:57] could see it hey man let's stand to our
[1:38:01] feet here let me just try to finish up
[1:38:03] here I'm read this quote one more time
[1:38:06] the whole thing is God and man 1 the
[1:38:10] whole point of this sermon for our
[1:38:14] sermon from brother branham a member of
[1:38:17] church remember the first sermon I
[1:38:18] preached is brother Branham said this
[1:38:20] sermon will tell you why I've done
[1:38:22] everything I've done in the tabernacle
[1:38:24] for all these 33 years this sermon tells
[1:38:28] us so everything brother man did the
[1:38:30] tabernacle was to try to make God in man
[1:38:33] 1 not separate now I'll do this and God
[1:38:38] you can do that but for a man to do
[1:38:40] exactly what God wanted him to do the
[1:38:43] whole purpose is God and man becoming
[1:38:47] one so we can do what God wants us to do
[1:38:51] I'm gonna read this again what is it
[1:38:54] being filled with the spirit him having
[1:38:57] the preeminence that was God's
[1:38:59] achievement that's God's purpose to do
[1:39:03] that that he might be in Christ in
[1:39:06] Christ in us and all of us together 1
[1:39:11] now no wonder Church what does the word
[1:39:14] preeminence mean it means the first
[1:39:16] place if you look it up in the Hebrew
[1:39:17] I'm sorry the Greek first place
[1:39:20] all's God wants to achieve tonight until
[1:39:24] the rapture is first place in your life
[1:39:27] that's why I got up at 4:45 this morning
[1:39:29] I got a busy day I've got to give him
[1:39:32] first place if I sleep in I'm not gonna
[1:39:35] have time to get in first place I'm
[1:39:37] brushing my teeth and eating my
[1:39:38] breakfast is gonna be first place I've
[1:39:41] got to put him first place above
[1:39:44] everything else and that's my way for me
[1:39:47] to get back to my first love it's the
[1:39:50] sacrifice of my energy my time and I got
[1:39:55] to put in purse God has to have
[1:39:56] preeminence in our hearts and lives now
[1:39:59] how you come to the pulpit seeking
[1:40:03] first the kingdom of God Jesus said seek

[1:41:48] thirsting for life 1960 brother man
[1:41:52] who's talking about people who try to
[1:41:53] satisfy the longing of God with
[1:41:56] something else because they longed for
[1:41:58] God they try to fill it they try do
[1:42:00] something else to make themselves feel
[1:42:01] like they've done good

[1:42:07] thirsting in you have you given over to
[1:42:09] the enemy to the things of the world
[1:42:11] have you just tried to satisfy that say
[1:42:13] well I'll go downtown and buy new
[1:42:16] clothes and that fits perfectly with the
[1:42:18] scripture but I'm talking about people
[1:42:19] who just go buy new clothes he says that
[1:42:23] isn't it you maybe you need new clothes
[1:42:28] that's legitimate but when you just make
[1:42:31] that your idol of how you just must be
[1:42:33] so and span all the time you heard
[1:42:36] that but maybe it's your home maybe it's
[1:42:41] something else that's taking the place
[1:42:42] of that first thing that thirst and
[1:42:44] calling it ought to be God God is that
[1:42:47] satisfying portion over have said many
[1:42:53] people try to everything and span
[1:42:55] [Music]
[1:42:57] program said it becomes an idol
[1:42:59] everything's got to be perfect
[1:43:00] their lives have to so look perfect and
[1:43:03] Church all's that is if we're not
[1:43:04] careful that's just a Pharisee spirit
[1:43:06] I'm not saying live loose or live dirty
[1:43:09] or anything like that but if we're not
[1:43:11] careful just looking and span
[1:43:13] trying to be perfect with brand-new
[1:43:15] clothes and look nice all the time hairs
[1:43:17] all combed and all gelled up and if that
[1:43:20] takes more preeminence if that's more
[1:43:23] important than reading our Bible pray
[1:43:25] worshiping God really hungry after God
[1:43:27] that we missed it we missed it that
[1:43:32] comedian Idol brother Ram says making
[1:43:34] sure everything's so and span you
[1:43:40] know I talked to a friend one time and
[1:43:41] he said he spent two or three hours just
[1:43:45] trying on different clothes to make sure
[1:43:47] everything was perfect before he stepped
[1:43:50] out the door
[1:43:53] there's what was that that was a lot of
[1:43:56] pride and ego and also fear the person
[1:44:00] confessed me they had like a complex
[1:44:02] they were fearful if they stepped
[1:44:03] outside in public and they didn't look
[1:44:06] perfect spickens bed and nice and
[1:44:09] fashions and match you know contrasting
[1:44:11] colors on all complimentary colors they
[1:44:14] would almost go crazy they would shake
[1:44:15] it and threw my back in the house I just
[1:44:20] think if we thought about that with our
[1:44:21] spiritual garments we really washed our
[1:44:24] robes and made them white in the blood
[1:44:26] of that's the kindest nickens man we
[1:44:29] need ain't a head this could be an idols
[1:44:38] well Jesus says why do we worry about
[1:44:40] food and drink and clothes all these
[1:44:42] things God will provide he said he's a
[1:44:44] father but seek first the kingdom of God
[1:44:47] and Rodan said this is the whole point
[1:44:51] of God's whole plan is have preeminence
[1:44:55] 1st place in your life and anyone who
[1:45:02] falls away for the message it's because
[1:45:03] the word was not first a lot of people
[1:45:07] are now are falling away because brother
[1:45:08] Brad was first and not God they're
[1:45:12] following the way they always put
[1:45:13] brother branham first like every word he
[1:45:15] said is thusly the Lord they find out
[1:45:17] he's a man he makes mistakes
[1:45:19] so they lose confidence then they attack
[1:45:21] him and they make him all kinds of they
[1:45:23] make him things that he's not even
[1:45:27] Church Christ Jesus has to be number one
[1:45:30] in our lives and that's for everything
[1:45:35] with your finances with your
[1:45:37] relationships he's gotta be number one
[1:45:39] there he's my number one with with
[1:45:41] everything with this service he's got to
[1:45:43] be 1st place he has to be the very first
[1:45:47] most important thing about this is
[1:45:48] Christ Jesus the word
[1:45:51] and when everybody gets in harmony
[1:45:55] Christ really has number one and
[1:45:57] everybody's hard life that was you know
[1:45:59] a train wreck sure hallelujah thank the
[1:46:06] Lord thank the Lord that's all he wants
[1:46:11] the whole thing is God and man 1 so I've
[1:46:15] given you a brief review of Christ the
[1:46:17] mystery of God revealed have you enjoyed
[1:46:18] it he focuses on revelation being born
[1:46:23] again and predestination this is all
[1:46:27] God's very plan and you can have 1st
[1:46:30] place in your life let's just bow our
[1:46:33] heads there's anything in your life that
[1:46:35] you're not giving God first place why

[1:46:42] maybe my free time I want to put your
[1:46:46] first in my relationship with my friends

[1:46:53] praying over myself or your for your
[1:46:56] help it on my job I'm not putting you

[1:47:09] conversations I'm I'm saying things I

[1:47:13] god help those individuals Lord see our
[1:47:17] hands raised here God we want you to be
[1:47:19] first place this is the whole purpose of
[1:47:24] God is to have preeminence as Colossians
[1:47:28] 1:18 said in all things Lord may you
[1:47:32] teach us may we continue to grow as
[1:47:34] pregnant Christians may we continue to
[1:47:36] grow so you have more and more
[1:47:38] preeminence in our lives granted your
[1:47:41] juices
[1:47:44] Lord we talked about the birth as a type
[1:47:46] of the Holy Ghost but Lord now we can
[1:47:48] tight talk it as a type of the rapture
[1:47:51] where new life is brought forth where
[1:47:54] where our old life is swallowed up where
[1:47:57] death is swallowed up in life amen
[1:48:00] oh yeah Laurie as we see the birth pains
[1:48:04] of the earth and the squeeze and Israel
[1:48:07] we see all these things the Roman
[1:48:08] Catholic Church and its birth pains Lord
[1:48:11] for us to bring forth Jesus Christ in a
[1:48:14] rapture dear God hallelujah thank you
[1:48:21] lord have first place dear God thank you
[1:48:26] that we can hear your word tonight as
[1:48:29] simple it is is Lord this is deep
[1:48:30] because it goes down deep to our
[1:48:32] priorities are you really our first
[1:48:35] priority thank you Lord for reminding us
[1:48:40] of this may we put you first in all
[1:48:42] things in our clothes and our food and
[1:48:46] our daily activities may we put you
[1:48:49] first and everything in Jesus Christ day
[1:48:52] the church said let's thank the Lord for
[1:48:54] the word of God tonight thank you Jesus
[1:48:56] thank you Lord thank you this is the
[1:49:03] whole thing God's great achievement that
[1:49:06] he might have the preeminence is in his
[1:49:09] people they're filled with the Holy
[1:49:11] Spirit Oh hallelujah
[1:49:15] I love how God has hidden simplicity
[1:49:18] don't you it could be some some deep
[1:49:21] mysterious thing but it boils down to
[1:49:23] who's first
[1:49:24] think about that church the foolish
[1:49:26] virgin had Jesus second the wise version
[1:49:31] had him first because they got born
[1:49:33] again ha ha ha and then I knew yeah they
[1:49:37] were still virgin the foolish version
[1:49:39] but Christ wasn't number 1 we're more
[1:49:42] than anything else I've got to make sure
[1:49:44] I'm born to get that's why he called him
[1:49:47] foolish there was something just a
[1:49:50] little more important and so Christ
[1:49:52] instead of number 1 Christ became second
[1:49:55] and the second most important thing
[1:49:58] actually became more important and the
[1:50:02] priority list got all mixed up how many
[1:50:08] want Christ to be at the top of the list
[1:50:09] [Music]
