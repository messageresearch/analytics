[0:01] ii timothy 4 verse 3. i like to preach
[0:04] on part 2 of the power of the apostles
[0:07] doctrine the power of the apostles
[0:10] doctrine
[0:11] it's though overall it's part 5 in our
[0:13] doctrine series but
[0:15] i'm just you know giving them little
[0:16] different titles there
[0:18] the power of the apostles doctrine
[0:20] second timothy four verse three
[0:39] before we read this you'll recall that
[0:41] god's prophet brother branham would use
[0:44] this scripture
[0:46] when he would ordain preachers
[0:51] so he would read of course verses 1 and
[0:53] 2 preach the word
[0:55] be instant in season out of season
[0:59] reprove rebrook i'm sorry rebuke rather
[1:02] exhort with all long suffering and
[1:05] doctrine we've been looking at doctrine
[1:06] the importance the necessity of doctrine
[1:11] verse three let's read that together one
[1:14] two three for the time will come when
[1:16] they will not endure sound doctrine but
[1:20] after their own lusts shall they heap to
[1:22] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:27] so we know the end time will be a time
[1:29] when very few people will have sound
[1:31] doctrine that word sound means healthy
[1:34] they'll be very in other words there'll
[1:35] be many unhealthy churches because of
[1:37] the unhealthy spiritual things they
[1:39] allow and they teach
[1:42] but paul told timothy you must be a
[1:44] sound doctrine church
[1:46] now if you go to the previous chapter go
[1:48] to second timothy 3
[1:50] and we'll read verse
[1:53] 10
[1:55] and this is the main section lord
[1:56] willing will preach on as we we're kind
[1:58] of going to build to this text here
[2:01] uh we're going to preach some other
[2:02] scriptures to try to get to this point
[2:04] here
[2:05] and we'll try to
[2:06] uh focus on second timothy here but ii
[2:09] timothy 3 10.
[2:14] as we saw with jesus jesus said everyone
[2:17] knew my doctrine the night he was
[2:20] arrested he said i was daily teaching i
[2:22] was daily giving doctrine
[2:24] the world has heard me he didn't hide
[2:26] his doctrine
[2:28] he shared a doctrine
[2:30] he said the way you'll know my doctrine
[2:31] is if you obey it and then god will
[2:33] bless it god will vindicate that my
[2:35] doctrine was right
[2:37] and we see paul saying the same thing
[2:38] look at verse 10.
[2:40] let's read that verse 10 1 2 3 but thou
[2:43] has fully known my doctrine manner of
[2:46] life purpose
[2:48] faith long-suffering charity and
[2:51] patience praise god paul was known for
[2:55] his doctrine it was christ doctrine
[2:58] let's have one more word of prayer if
[2:59] you have a need on your heart let's just
[3:00] make it known unto god whether raising
[3:01] hand or praying in your own heart
[3:03] heavenly father we thank you again for
[3:05] this opportunity lord let the holy
[3:06] spirit fall on each person today
[3:08] hallelujah lord let each person have a
[3:10] personal revival let it start in them
[3:12] lord god so the rest of their family the
[3:15] rest of their friends the rest of their
[3:16] co-workers the rest of their classmates
[3:18] lord those who are in school can see the
[3:21] revival in each person's life we pray
[3:23] hallelujah we know it's the bride's
[3:25] revival it's the individual's revival
[3:28] that your prophet started lord and it
[3:29] continues to burn today it burns in our
[3:32] hearts it burns in our our spirits lord
[3:34] god we thank you for that lord jesus and
[3:37] may lord your holy spirit have
[3:38] preeminence today meet every need lord
[3:40] god guide me and direct me by the holy
[3:42] spirit help me to be a united vessel
[3:44] that your word can be declared in jesus
[3:46] christ's name and the saint said amen
[3:48] amen god bless you as you're being
[3:50] seated praise god
[3:53] so i have some
[3:55] slides here and some quotes and
[3:56] scriptures i'd like to show here
[3:59] by god's grace
[4:04] and i'm going to try not to preach two
[4:05] hours like last sunday okay so
[4:08] uh we have two services today so i am
[4:10] going to try to watch my time here
[4:11] but you know once you start preaching we
[4:13] just start getting heavenly places and
[4:15] and it's just hard to get out of that
[4:17] for me it wants it maybe uh it's hard
[4:19] once i get in it i don't i don't like to
[4:21] leave it
[4:22] but
[4:23] looking forward to the bible studies
[4:25] here today with the kids tonight
[4:27] and again again adults can ask any
[4:29] questions they want so austin aline and
[4:31] i talked about that you can ask any
[4:32] question you want we'll have a certain
[4:34] direction but you can interrupt at any
[4:36] time and just raise your hand and say
[4:38] what about this or what about that we'll
[4:39] do the best we can
[4:40] to answer those questions praise god
[4:43] we're looking at part five and we did
[4:44] recognize brother bang thank you again
[4:46] brother bang
[4:48] i'll regret our text i want to just
[4:50] really briefly review uh doctrine you
[4:52] know uh two sundays ago we were kind of
[4:55] snowed in and so i started this series
[4:58] uh over the live stream and and you were
[5:01] not with me uh so i haven't really
[5:03] showed these these slides but uh
[5:06] doctrine is the same as teaching
[5:09] and brother brahm said every man he said
[5:12] every preacher has a doctrine whether he
[5:13] admits it or not brother braham said you
[5:15] cannot have a ministry without having
[5:17] doctor
[5:18] because at some point you're teaching
[5:20] the people what to do
[5:22] you're teaching them how to be uh saved
[5:25] how to be filled with the holy ghost how
[5:26] to be healed right you're teaching them
[5:29] how to
[5:30] or how to find uh how to recognize your
[5:33] day and its message
[5:35] praise god how to do that praise god
[5:37] you're teaching them how to do something
[5:39] how can i overcome amen these are all
[5:41] doctrinal thoughts
[5:43] anything that's teaching you how to do
[5:45] something
[5:47] is a doctrinal message
[5:49] and brother brahm said i don't have the
[5:51] exact quote in front of me it's in my
[5:52] book um
[5:54] but brother and said the antichrist
[5:56] church will not receive true bride
[5:57] doctrine
[6:00] so we would expect the true bride to
[6:02] have true doctrine
[6:03] her doctrine would be bible doctrine but
[6:06] the antichrist group will have signs
[6:08] wonders and miracles just like the bride
[6:10] but they'll have false doctrine
[6:12] so that will be the separation
[6:15] because the the workers of iniquity say
[6:18] jesus we had prophesied we spoke in
[6:20] tongues we had many wonderful works we
[6:22] cast out devils but he said i never knew
[6:24] you you worker of iniquity
[6:27] you worked false doctrine you lived in
[6:29] false doctrine you propagated false
[6:31] doctrine amen but those who are saved
[6:34] did the will of my father which is in
[6:36] heaven amen
[6:37] and as brother adam said the evidence of
[6:39] the holy ghost is all god's children can
[6:41] be taught of god
[6:43] all god's children learn god's doctrine
[6:45] learn god's ways and therefore obey god
[6:48] and act just like their father because
[6:50] they're children of the heavenly father
[6:52] amen i'm just starting to get excited
[6:54] already
[6:55] now uh i don't want to get too fast
[6:57] though so
[6:58] doctrine in the greek
[7:00] there's three greek words
[7:02] that refer to doctrine and teaching and
[7:04] i can't pronounce these didascalia
[7:07] 21 mentions in the new testament didasco
[7:10] 91 mentions in new testament i call them
[7:12] hits because that's what uh the table
[7:14] software calls them and uh
[7:17] the word taut
[7:19] is didachi i never say that right 30. so
[7:22] there's 158 new testament uses
[7:26] and then there are other greek words for
[7:28] doc there's a few other for doctrine and
[7:30] teaching those are the main ones that i
[7:31] could find
[7:32] okay so let's look at their greek
[7:33] definition just so you understand that
[7:35] they're it's all uh it's all overlapping
[7:39] they're the same thing because dida
[7:41] scalia means teaching precepts
[7:43] instruction
[7:45] doctrine dadasco is to instruct so see
[7:47] the overlap of instruction
[7:49] to be a teacher impart instruction
[7:51] instill doctrine to one and then didachi
[7:54] is teaching instruction so the greek
[7:56] meanings are essentially the same
[7:58] so any any preacher that got up and said
[8:00] i'm going to teach today on this or i'm
[8:02] going to
[8:02] tell you how to do this they're actually
[8:04] offering doctrine they're offering
[8:07] instruction and every preacher has
[8:09] doctrine as brother brahm taught us amen
[8:12] but we have sound doctrine praise god
[8:14] our church has sound doctrine healthy
[8:17] doctrine praise god
[8:19] it's directing us to to live holy it's
[8:21] directing us to live righteously praise
[8:23] god in this present sinful world
[8:26] amen
[8:28] and now i just gave an example uh
[8:30] compare how much the bible uses doctrine
[8:33] and teaching versus latter rain which we
[8:35] all want to be in the latter rain right
[8:36] that's the rapturing faith brother brand
[8:38] tells us
[8:39] latter reign has nine mentions in the
[8:40] bible
[8:41] uh doctrine and teaching have
[8:44] almost 300
[8:46] so which was which one does god place
[8:48] emphasis on god places more emphasis on
[8:51] doctrine and teaching because that's
[8:52] what you need for your everyday life
[8:55] praise god
[8:56] only the saints who live to the rapture
[8:58] really need that scripture about latter
[9:00] rain right
[9:02] that's that's the other ones need to
[9:04] know about it but really the only ones
[9:06] who who need that scripture about it are
[9:08] those who that will live to receive that
[9:10] praise god and we hope for that group
[9:12] amen
[9:13] but we may not be for no man knows the
[9:15] dare of the hour
[9:16] praise god and no man thought no man
[9:18] around brother brown thought it'd ever
[9:19] get to 2022 but here we are praise god
[9:22] and so we'll just keep marching on we'll
[9:24] keep serving the lord we'll keep we'll
[9:26] be about the father's business amen
[9:28] we'll work till jesus comes amen we
[9:30] won't get tired of this 11th hour praise
[9:32] god it's just one hour amen church you
[9:34] can work a little longer amen there's
[9:37] just one more hour till midnight praise
[9:39] god just keep laboring just keep working
[9:41] amen god will bless you praise god
[9:44] so the conclusion is those who love
[9:46] god's doctrine all 300 or so verses
[9:49] and teaching will be ready for the
[9:51] latter reign
[9:53] praise god that must be the conclusion
[9:55] because it was so important praise god
[9:58] now i want to just look at a few
[9:59] thoughts here before i get down to these
[10:01] second timothy verses that i'm going to
[10:03] try to be laboring on
[10:05] so your daily life reveals
[10:08] your doctrinal beliefs in other words
[10:11] the life that a person lives reveals
[10:14] their teaching
[10:15] your life reveals what you've accepted
[10:18] your life reveals what you really
[10:20] believe amen right because the pharisees
[10:23] were hypocrites they said one thing but
[10:25] they did another thing
[10:27] their life revealed what they really
[10:29] believed about doctrine
[10:31] praise god
[10:32] the fact that they hated jesus doctrine
[10:34] shows that they were very corrupt people
[10:36] praise god and jesus said outwardly
[10:38] you're beautiful but inwardly you're
[10:40] full of dead men's bones
[10:43] right they prayed long prayers on
[10:44] purpose to try to impress people
[10:47] right they they went into widows houses
[10:49] to try to get their inheritance money
[10:52] they were just wicked people on the
[10:54] inside they didn't like jesus miracles
[10:57] they didn't like the supernatural
[10:59] didn't like women kissing jesus feet and
[11:02] weeping for repentance they didn't like
[11:04] see people being saved but we like all
[11:06] that amen
[11:07] we like healings praise god we like
[11:09] salvation we like people weeping their
[11:11] way to jesus amen hallelujah
[11:16] you see your daily life reveals
[11:19] your doctrinal beliefs now let me just
[11:21] show a few examples of what i'm talking
[11:23] about
[11:24] now adam clarke was a baptist
[11:26] i'm sorry was a methodist preacher in
[11:28] the man age
[11:30] right it's about a little after the time
[11:31] of john wesley so he would have come
[11:34] after john wesley and these these men of
[11:36] that day had tremendous
[11:38] commentaries
[11:39] now um
[11:42] in titus 2 verse 1. i'm just going to
[11:43] read it real quick
[11:46] it says but speak thou the things which
[11:48] become sound doctrine
[11:50] so we're supposed to constantly talk
[11:52] sound doctrine
[11:54] right and paul was of course writing
[11:55] that uh to titus
[11:57] now adam clark says about this
[12:02] this is a conclusion drawn from the
[12:04] preceding chapter the judaizing teachers
[12:07] were only taught a false doctrine but
[12:09] they led an unholy life
[12:12] titus was to act directly opposite amen
[12:16] so see the jews that titus was battling
[12:18] there
[12:19] they taught wrong and they lived wrong
[12:22] but paul tells titus you do the opposite
[12:24] amen
[12:25] you teach right and live right amen
[12:28] hallelujah
[12:29] he must teach a sacred doctrine and the
[12:32] things which become it he must proclaim
[12:34] the truth and illustrate the truth the
[12:36] people must not only be well instructed
[12:39] they must be holy in their lives as well
[12:43] principle and practice must go hand in
[12:45] hand amen in other words i must practice
[12:48] what i preach
[12:50] if i don't i'm a liar i'm a hypocrite
[12:52] amen is that right but if i practice
[12:55] what i preach then i'm a man of sound
[12:57] doctrine i'm a holy man i'm a righteous
[12:59] man i'm a man that god wants to use amen
[13:03] hallelujah
[13:04] now don't be discouraged if people say
[13:06] well why are you reading from other
[13:08] preachers
[13:09] brother branham was the one
[13:11] who said that these men had the
[13:13] greatest sermons and the greatest
[13:15] writings ever
[13:17] i didn't say that brother branham said
[13:19] that
[13:20] he said in the days of john wesley the
[13:22] preaching of the word was never
[13:25] greater
[13:26] the preaching of the word
[13:29] now how come you don't hear people say
[13:30] this because they like to worship
[13:31] william branham that's why
[13:33] but look how humble william branham was
[13:36] i thought you believed every quote well
[13:38] then why don't you believe this
[13:40] there's no greater preaching ever than
[13:42] william branham that's a lie
[13:44] brother brandon even said the previous
[13:47] age because the man's wisdom had greater
[13:49] preaching
[13:51] not greater revelation but somehow
[13:53] greater preaching i can't explain it but
[13:55] that's what he said
[13:57] as satan raised up hordes of free
[13:59] thinkers as the originators of communism
[14:02] arose up as liberal theologians spread
[14:04] their filthy wares god raised up mighty
[14:07] warriors of faith and the greatest works
[14:10] of christian literature and teaching and
[14:14] preaching came from this era
[14:16] not the second greatest and the church
[14:18] said
[14:21] never has its preachers and teachers
[14:23] been matched and never will they be
[14:27] that's a hard pill for branham
[14:29] worshipers to swallow
[14:31] we honor brother branham but we're not
[14:33] random worshippers
[14:34] random worshipers say every word on the
[14:36] tape is thus saith the lord that's a lie
[14:38] from satan
[14:40] brotherham said there's mix-ups on the
[14:42] tapes he said but he said the tapes
[14:45] point us to the absolute which is jesus
[14:47] christ the word of god
[14:49] amen brother man prayed made the
[14:52] absolute of this entire congregation he
[14:54] said may they look away from me or
[14:56] servant and may they look to jesus
[14:58] christ
[14:59] who is the absolute and may they make
[15:01] jesus christ be their absolute and all
[15:03] their faith in god's word
[15:06] amen
[15:08] the spurgeons parkers mclarens edwards
[15:11] bunions mueller's brainerds barns
[15:13] bishops all came from this area they
[15:15] preached taught and wrote the word they
[15:17] glorified his name so adam clark was one
[15:19] of the preachers of this era
[15:22] praise god that's a hard pill for some
[15:24] people to swallow but brother branham
[15:27] said if you have any light in you he
[15:28] said you'll see the truth that's in the
[15:30] church age book
[15:32] how come they don't preach those because
[15:33] they don't like those
[15:35] hallelujah
[15:37] now church i kind of ended last week's
[15:40] message with this this thought
[15:43] because we live in a three-part
[15:46] room
[15:47] i'm sorry a three-part house you have a
[15:50] body mind and soul
[15:53] we constantly battle
[15:55] the sin that lays in our body
[15:57] and even though our soul believes every
[15:59] word of god our soul has never sinned
[16:01] we've been through that out of first
[16:02] john chapter 3
[16:04] the seed of god cannot sin yet we
[16:06] continue to sin at times because we we
[16:09] we don't choose the influence of the
[16:11] spirit of god in our souls and we get
[16:14] selfish or or we uh
[16:16] we choose to obey the lust of the flesh
[16:18] or the lust of the eyes or the pride of
[16:21] life and we sin every day
[16:24] and many times as things we knew was
[16:27] wrong to begin with
[16:31] praise god
[16:33] so
[16:34] in other words what i'm saying is you
[16:35] can be a holy ghost-filled saint but
[16:37] then battle a certain sin for years and
[16:40] years and years you'll get victory off
[16:42] and on over right
[16:44] you won't be a slave to it but every
[16:46] like the bible said satan will come back
[16:48] for another season
[16:49] a season of hard battles praise god
[16:52] and we're not excusing sin
[16:54] but we're looking at the reality of
[16:56] being a christian the reality of living
[16:58] a christian life is you have a seed of
[17:00] god inside of you that cannot sin but
[17:03] then you have a flesh body who is your
[17:05] worst enemy praise god
[17:07] you live in a part where you live in a
[17:09] body where a being where you part of you
[17:11] is your worst enemy but part of you is
[17:14] your your victory praise god
[17:16] hallelujah the spirit of god inside of
[17:18] you is your greatest source of strength
[17:20] but then your body is your greatest
[17:21] source of failure
[17:26] so as with doctrine what i mean is that
[17:28] we can all recognize true doctrine
[17:31] true i know i should be doing this but
[17:33] then we still fall short anyway
[17:36] but i want to teach this so you don't
[17:37] quit the christian fight and you don't
[17:39] let satan put guilt over on you
[17:43] because this is something every believer
[17:45] has battled down through the ages
[17:48] you are not alone your experience is no
[17:50] different than anybody else
[17:52] there's no temptation that's given
[17:54] except what's common to man
[17:56] right
[17:58] there's someone in the bible that you
[17:59] can look to who you that person can
[18:01] understand what you're going through now
[18:03] praise god
[18:04] and just as that person was never alone
[18:07] you're not alone either praise god the
[18:09] holy spirit is here praise god god's
[18:11] spirit is here he's i'm here to help you
[18:14] encourage you strengthen you praise god
[18:16] and help you be an overcomer amen
[18:18] even if it takes you years to surrender
[18:22] i don't know i'm going to prove it here
[18:23] by the word of god
[18:24] amen
[18:27] you'll battle spirits off and on you'll
[18:29] get victory for a while but then you'll
[18:31] give in
[18:33] and you'll feel so condemned well i'm
[18:34] here to tell you there's no condemnation
[18:37] to them that are in christ jesus amen
[18:40] who walk after the spirit and not the
[18:42] flesh
[18:43] hallelujah
[18:45] amen
[18:49] now i'm going to
[18:51] skip past this because that was my
[18:52] outline
[18:54] paul delivered the high calling in other
[18:57] words paul delivered the exact way to
[19:00] live
[19:01] by sound doctrine
[19:03] but he himself and every believer was
[19:06] constantly struggling to live it
[19:09] that's our daily struggle
[19:11] which of you have ever made it through a
[19:12] day where you didn't sin that whole day
[19:14] probably none of you
[19:16] right and if by the end you got there
[19:18] then you got prideful saying look what i
[19:20] did and then you just sinned just ruined
[19:22] your whole
[19:22] day right
[19:27] and i'm going to show you some quotes
[19:29] some of these you'll be familiar with
[19:30] from brother branham
[19:32] so this means paul would have committed
[19:35] sins he knew were wrong just like we see
[19:37] in brother branham's life and our lives
[19:41] because paul said i count not myself to
[19:44] have apprehended i'm not perfect in
[19:45] other words
[19:46] i haven't apprehended i don't have
[19:48] everything under control i haven't
[19:50] grasped every every concept i haven't
[19:52] grasped every power of god
[19:56] does he sound like he's prideful or
[19:57] humble
[19:58] what do we got today a bunch of message
[19:59] people i'm the bride i never did it in
[20:01] the first place i'm so holy and they're
[20:03] so lazy
[20:05] they don't reach out to the poor they
[20:06] don't pray like they ought to they don't
[20:08] vote they don't do nothing
[20:10] they just go to church and talk and be
[20:12] prideful that's all they do and feed
[20:13] their bodies and get get unhealthy
[20:16] they don't fast they don't they don't
[20:17] read their bibles nothing they just
[20:19] press play
[20:21] and they just hear what they want to
[20:23] hear
[20:24] see
[20:27] paul was humble and yet i would put his
[20:29] miracles against anybody alive today i
[20:31] would say paul's would be greater than
[20:33] all theirs
[20:35] because he said i labored more
[20:36] abundantly than all the other apostles
[20:38] too
[20:39] that means peter james john paul labored
[20:42] more than all of them
[20:47] he said but this one thing i do i forget
[20:49] glory those things that are behind
[20:51] church forget your past amen
[20:53] and reach for those things which are
[20:55] before you amen
[20:57] because i press towards the mark for the
[20:59] prize of the high calling of god in
[21:02] christ jesus let us therefore as many as
[21:04] be perfect or complete be thus minded
[21:08] and if any
[21:09] if anything ye be otherwise minded god
[21:12] shall even reveal this unto you so see
[21:16] paul knew he had the revelation of jesus
[21:18] he said if anybody changes anything it's
[21:20] cursed
[21:22] but he said i've not i've apprehended
[21:24] everything i'm not the master of of
[21:26] everything i
[21:27] i don't know at all i'm not a no-no but
[21:30] i'm pressed i'm forgetting the past i'm
[21:32] confessing my sins amen leaving them in
[21:34] the past and i'm pressing forward toward
[21:37] the mark of the high calling amen
[21:40] glory we should have the same attitude
[21:43] confess your sins and move on and press
[21:47] towards a life that's worthy of the
[21:49] gospel
[21:50] you'll never get perfection as far as
[21:52] sinless life here in this body you'd
[21:55] only get that until you get a new body
[21:57] praise god
[21:58] when you get a new body then you'll
[22:00] never sin praise god
[22:02] in other words we're always going to sin
[22:03] here so don't dwell on that confess it
[22:05] or try to overcome it praise god but
[22:07] keep pressing toward a more holy life a
[22:10] more obedient life keep grasping let
[22:12] that be your goal let not not more money
[22:15] or not more luster
[22:16] make obedience your goal praise god
[22:19] reach for that grasp for that like paul
[22:22] said i'm pressing towards the mark of
[22:24] the prize of the high calling of god in
[22:27] christ jesus
[22:30] because john says if any of you say you
[22:32] have no sin you're a liar
[22:35] but then he says the next two chapters
[22:37] later
[22:38] he said if you've got the seed of god
[22:39] you don't commit sin
[22:42] what does that mean your soul doesn't
[22:43] sin because it's anointed you have the
[22:45] holy ghost nature you have a portion or
[22:48] measure of god's spirit in your soul and
[22:50] that spirit cannot sin
[22:54] but we sin in our minds
[22:56] we think the wrong thing and then we sit
[22:58] in our flesh
[22:59] right by obeying the lust of the flesh
[23:03] right
[23:07] now let me just give you a visual maybe
[23:09] this will help you i was trying to think
[23:11] how can i help the people
[23:13] paul gave us the high calling right
[23:16] now there's a road how many know there's
[23:18] a narrow road
[23:19] but how many know sometimes you're not
[23:21] always driving the middle of the road
[23:24] praise god
[23:25] like peter where was peter in the middle
[23:28] of the road when he was saying i'm not
[23:29] going to eat with those gentiles those
[23:31] dirty
[23:32] whatever they are i don't know what he
[23:33] said
[23:34] but was paul living in the middle of the
[23:36] road no
[23:38] because paul after peter peter was not
[23:40] living in the middle road because paul
[23:42] had come by and stick his finger under
[23:43] his nose and said you're to be blamed
[23:48] so where was peter
[23:50] so i'll just use an example so there's
[23:52] times in our lives where we're
[23:53] completely obedient right to the word of
[23:55] god we're living right in the middle of
[23:57] the road
[23:58] but then paul said
[24:00] he hasn't apprehended anything there was
[24:02] times i'm going to show you he made sins
[24:04] he did things that he hated
[24:07] he gave into the flesh brother austin
[24:10] and he said oh wretched man that i am
[24:11] how can a man that's born again filled
[24:13] with the holy ghost be wretched because
[24:15] he gave into his flesh
[24:17] and he said i'm i'm not always as strong
[24:18] as i want to be
[24:20] sometimes i make mistakes so same thing
[24:22] you could put peter out here too
[24:23] sometimes peter made a little mistake
[24:25] but was he still on the road yes he was
[24:27] still on the road
[24:28] god did not throw him off into the ditch
[24:30] like we believe people out here that
[24:32] that leave the message and and uh
[24:34] blasting the message we believe they're
[24:35] out there they're drowning you know
[24:36] they're they're they're lost
[24:38] if they blaspheme the word of god
[24:40] if they call the the ministry of brother
[24:42] branham a ministry of the devil they
[24:44] blast him the holy ghost
[24:48] right
[24:50] so here paul he's trying to stay in the
[24:54] middle of the road
[24:55] how many are trying to stay in the
[24:56] middle of the road
[24:58] let's say he got off but then god brings
[25:00] him back closer you know this is our
[25:02] desire as we go further down the road we
[25:04] want to be in the middle of the road
[25:07] we want to be complete obedience to the
[25:09] word of god
[25:12] does everybody understand what i'm
[25:13] saying now
[25:16] we make little missteps we get or can i
[25:18] say like this we get a little unbalance
[25:20] in our doctrine
[25:22] right
[25:24] so peter has a good example
[25:26] if i had more time i would put peter up
[25:28] there
[25:28] peter would have got off a little bit on
[25:30] that idea with not eating with gentiles
[25:33] paul straightened him out
[25:35] praise god
[25:37] now i won't just use this idea here i
[25:38] just want to use this idea
[25:41] now brother austin here's that scripture
[25:42] i want to show you and everybody paul's
[25:45] writing in romans 7 he says we know the
[25:47] law is spiritual like you only a
[25:49] spiritual being can obey these things
[25:52] but i am carnal i'm sold under sin so in
[25:55] other words i'm a slave to sin in my
[25:57] flesh
[25:58] for that which i do i allow not
[26:01] for what i would that i do not but what
[26:04] i hate that i do
[26:06] so paul is saying because i have sin
[26:09] trapped in my body
[26:10] i hate it but yet sometimes i obey
[26:13] the the sin of my body i give in and i
[26:16] sin against the lord
[26:19] if then i do that which i would not i
[26:21] don't want to do it i consent unto the
[26:23] law that it's good now then it is no
[26:25] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[26:28] in me
[26:29] now look here he separates the soul from
[26:32] his flesh amen
[26:34] so paul says i do things that i hate but
[26:36] it's really not my soul it's my my
[26:39] spirit and my flesh that do it
[26:42] amen may god help us to find that
[26:44] balance praise god
[26:49] for i know that in me that is in my
[26:51] flesh he never said soul soul is only
[26:53] the good thing that's the holy ghost
[26:55] dwelt no good thing there's nothing good
[26:58] in your flesh
[26:59] for to will is present with me but how
[27:01] to perform
[27:02] that which is good i find not
[27:05] so paul constantly wanted to get his
[27:06] flesh to obey the word of god but he
[27:08] couldn't find it how can i get this
[27:09] thing to obey god's word all the time he
[27:11] couldn't find it
[27:13] but that's how god wanted it praise god
[27:14] god wanted you to fight praise god god
[27:17] wanted you to trust him for every
[27:19] victory all the time every day 24 7 365
[27:23] days a year god wants you to learn to
[27:26] lean upon him like jesus did
[27:31] for the good that i would i do not but
[27:33] the evil which i don't want to do that i
[27:36] do so but austin there's gonna sister
[27:38] lena there's gonna be times we don't
[27:40] wanna do sin but anyways we'll give in
[27:43] because we're weak in that moment we get
[27:45] off the very center of god's will now
[27:48] we're not we're still on the right road
[27:49] we're still saved
[27:51] for if i do that i would not it is no
[27:53] more i that do it but sin that dwelt in
[27:55] me i find then a law that when i would
[27:58] do good evil is present with me isn't
[28:00] that true
[28:01] you want to do something good you want
[28:02] to overcome but then right there is the
[28:04] flesh right there
[28:06] i want you to say this i want you to act
[28:07] on this i want you to go buy this i want
[28:09] you to do that
[28:10] say that
[28:14] for i delight in the law of god after
[28:16] the inward man but i see another law in
[28:18] my memory so he has two laws
[28:20] the law of god and the law of sin
[28:23] warren against the law of my mind and
[28:25] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[28:27] sin which is in my members so listen
[28:29] george every time
[28:31] we sin we've actually
[28:32] come under captivity to sin
[28:36] we've been a very we're a temporary
[28:38] prisoner to sin
[28:40] now not demon possessed
[28:42] right but we the paul says i came into
[28:45] captivity i got caught in a trap
[28:47] the church said
[28:49] paul said riches are traps
[28:51] they're snares
[28:53] right so is pride so it's fear so is
[28:56] depression so all these things are
[28:59] trapped satan
[29:01] sets out there and sometimes we
[29:02] purposely walk into him and the church
[29:04] said
[29:05] sometimes we perk we shouldn't do it we
[29:07] know it's wrong
[29:09] but we purposely will walk into it we
[29:12] purposely put ourselves into captivity
[29:15] and we sin on purpose
[29:19] now look what paul calls himself a man
[29:21] who had more revelation than any of us
[29:23] could ever have what does he call
[29:25] himself i'm the bride i'm a big somebody
[29:29] i'm so holy i never did in the first
[29:31] place he said o wretched man that i am
[29:35] who shall deliver me from the body of
[29:37] this death
[29:38] i thank god through jesus christ our
[29:41] lord so then with the mind i serve
[29:43] myself serve the law of god but with the
[29:45] flesh the law of sin
[29:47] praise god
[29:50] so can everybody see this
[29:53] the longer we live the more we should
[29:55] recognize yes we have god inside of us
[29:57] but we've got to yield to that
[30:00] and if we don't yield to that we
[30:02] purposely
[30:03] uh let the devil we purposely walk into
[30:06] his traps
[30:09] and we become
[30:10] trapped in that and we have to repen to
[30:12] get out of that trap
[30:15] if not we'll be a slave to that and
[30:16] we'll keep going down the wrong road
[30:20] i trust everybody's hearing me by god's
[30:22] grace
[30:23] now this is romans 7 but never be
[30:26] discouraged because romans 8 is a
[30:27] powerful chapter
[30:29] paul paul begins it by saying there is
[30:31] there therefore no condemnation of them
[30:34] that are in christ jesus remember
[30:35] there's no chapter of divisions when
[30:36] paul wrote this so paul's saying oh
[30:38] wretched man that i am but then he says
[30:40] but when i walk in the spirit there's no
[30:42] condemnation to me praise god
[30:44] and they said who shall separate me from
[30:47] the love of god shall death persecution
[30:49] principles he said nothing shall
[30:52] separate us from the love of god which
[30:54] is in christ jesus amen hallelujah
[30:58] it's god's love that save me it's god
[31:00] though that's going to keep me praise
[31:01] god it's god's love that's going to take
[31:03] me home amen
[31:05] hallelujah
[31:11] so that's the attitude we got to have
[31:16] now church listen we are not workers of
[31:18] iniquity because they're lost
[31:20] their souls are lost they're not sealed
[31:21] by the holy ghost
[31:23] but we do need forgiven of our
[31:26] iniquities
[31:28] for if brother branham i forgot to
[31:30] change that i should for brother branham
[31:33] committed thousands of sins a year
[31:36] like brother brahm said he did how many
[31:38] of those
[31:39] did he know were wrong
[31:41] now let me get to this quote here so i
[31:42] can show it to you
[31:46] okay let's read this
[31:48] brother ram said he made thousands of
[31:49] sins in a year thousands
[31:52] i have no holiness to present to him
[31:56] what i'm trusting in is oh his grace and
[31:58] i have in my heart i'm unmerited at
[32:00] nothing i could do to deserve it
[32:04] but by grace he called me invited me to
[32:06] come and i looked at him and he took the
[32:08] desire away from me i make thousands of
[32:10] mistakes in a much in a month in a year
[32:12] surely i do but when i see i'm wrong i
[32:14] say god i didn't mean to do it you know
[32:16] my heart i didn't mean to do that i was
[32:18] trapped and that snared into that i
[32:20] became captive into that
[32:22] i didn't mean to do it you forgive me
[32:24] lord if i'd done wrong to my brother i
[32:26] said brother forgive me i didn't mean to
[32:27] do that certainly god knows my heart oh
[32:29] there you are there is the blood
[32:31] sacrifice there's the power of the
[32:33] gospel you imagine a thousand sins a
[32:36] year but the power of the gospel
[32:38] forgives every single one praise god
[32:40] that and that not just you but me all of
[32:42] us amen the blood of jesus christ wipes
[32:45] all these thousands ten thousands
[32:47] hundreds of thousands millions of sins
[32:49] away that's the power of the gospel amen
[32:52] that's good news to me hallelujah
[32:55] the blood of jesus christ
[32:58] there is the power of the gospel that
[33:00] holy church moving on despite my
[33:02] thousands of mistakes every year i'm
[33:04] just forgetting it i'm moving on i'm
[33:06] moving on the grace of god i'm more than
[33:08] a conqueror in christ jesus amen
[33:13] because i have two laws inside of me
[33:15] right
[33:17] not because something you've done
[33:19] is something you had nothing to do with
[33:21] he said that's the atonement amen now
[33:24] let's go back
[33:27] now do you understand this
[33:29] if brother branham had thousands now
[33:31] i'll go on the small number
[33:33] thousands would be at least two right so
[33:35] two thousand
[33:37] if he had two thousand sins a year how
[33:39] many of those do you think were new
[33:41] temptations he never knew before
[33:46] how many times have you said to me like
[33:47] oh i didn't realize that was a sin
[33:51] how many honest people do we have here
[33:52] today
[33:54] everybody's honest
[33:56] do you think all all two thousand
[33:59] oh i didn't know that
[34:01] should not do that that's new to me i
[34:02] didn't know that was a sin
[34:05] and we're all reading our bibles every
[34:06] day and praying praise god
[34:09] we're all listening to sermons and
[34:10] praising god in our homes oh there's 2
[34:13] 000 things you didn't know this year
[34:16] when you commit a sin and you know it's
[34:17] wrong that's called iniquity
[34:20] but the bible says paul says let
[34:23] everyone that nameth the name of christ
[34:25] depart from iniquity
[34:27] see workers of iniquity never depart
[34:29] they continue doing those wicked things
[34:31] all the time but we're gonna get tempted
[34:34] we're gonna fall off we're gonna we're
[34:35] gonna we're gonna do things we know are
[34:36] wrong iniquities but then the grace of
[34:38] god is gonna bring us back into
[34:40] obedience we're not gonna continue doing
[34:42] that we're gonna get victory for a
[34:44] season stumble a little bit a righteous
[34:46] man falls seven times but he raises up
[34:48] amen
[34:50] he's gonna get back on the path but the
[34:52] work of iniquity continues in that and
[34:54] leaves the path and then they blaspheme
[34:56] the path
[34:58] and say that that's not the real way the
[35:00] church should be run that's not a true
[35:01] church they're a false church
[35:03] while they live under the anointing at
[35:04] times but then they also live under the
[35:06] ho or the unholy anointing as well
[35:10] all right
[35:12] this is why we did this memory verse
[35:13] children
[35:15] bless the lord o my soul
[35:17] forget not all of his benefits
[35:20] you know when i got my job i was very
[35:21] thankful for insurance i got insurance
[35:23] for my kids you know dental health all
[35:25] these things but let me tell you there's
[35:27] no benefits and insurance like god's
[35:28] benefits and insurance
[35:31] so actually when i became a christian i
[35:33] actually got the best benefits package
[35:34] i've ever got in my life
[35:36] and here it is right here praise god
[35:38] amen
[35:40] he gives to all children i'm going to
[35:41] forgive you
[35:42] all not some not a tenth not eighty
[35:46] percent not half a hundred percent of
[35:48] your iniquities amen
[35:51] things you knew were wrong i'm forgiving
[35:53] you of all your purposeful
[35:54] transgressions not some of them all of
[35:57] them praise god
[36:00] see how god's benefits are way better
[36:01] than ours brother bang i'll go to the
[36:03] doctor i still gotta do a 15 co-payer
[36:05] now it's 30 copay
[36:07] they don't forgive all of my debt
[36:09] but god said i forgive it all right i
[36:12] praise god i'm forgiven you have to pay
[36:14] nothing amen just trust in the sacrifice
[36:17] just trust my eternal assurance policy
[36:20] amen
[36:21] hallelujah
[36:23] i'm forgiving all your iniquities
[36:26] and i'm going to heal all thy diseases
[36:30] in one way or another praise god
[36:33] whether by death or whether by a
[36:36] supernatural miracle quickly or divine
[36:39] healing takes weeks months years however
[36:41] long i heal all diseases
[36:45] and i redeem your life your life won't
[36:47] be for destruction your life will be for
[36:50] victory
[36:51] your life will be for glorification of
[36:53] god almighty amen hallelujah not
[36:56] destruction
[36:58] but glorification of god's kingdom amen
[37:01] and then god cross
[37:05] your life god places a crown upon your
[37:08] life it's a crown of loving kindness
[37:11] and tender mercies
[37:14] so what do you have to do with that
[37:15] crown anyway
[37:16] is it your loving kindness that you're
[37:18] crowned with well look what i did no
[37:20] we're actually jesus shares his crown
[37:22] we're actually wearing what he's done
[37:26] it's his loving kindness you're wearing
[37:28] it
[37:29] it's his mercy that you go along i'm a
[37:31] i'm a king of his mercy i'm a king of
[37:34] god's loving kindness amen that's what i
[37:36] am that's what you are praise god god
[37:38] crowns your life with that everybody
[37:40] looks and see wow they have god's mercy
[37:42] on them amen god loves them amen that's
[37:45] what your life is crowned with what an
[37:48] insurance policy that's god's eternal
[37:50] policy
[37:52] amen
[37:56] see he's got to put that in there
[37:58] because you have iniquities all the way
[37:59] up to you die or get a body change
[38:02] i'm gonna say this about my grandpa my
[38:03] grandpa
[38:04] was a wonderful man of god he was
[38:06] probably only sanctified
[38:08] he prayed for numerous people and they
[38:10] raised from the dead even his own life
[38:14] at the end of his life my mom said
[38:16] he would whistle at some of the nurses
[38:18] because they were they were they were a
[38:20] sexy dress or something like that
[38:22] now i hope he repented of that
[38:24] but i want you to see that's an example
[38:26] of an 80-something-year-old man who saw
[38:28] the miracles he saw some of us he
[38:30] probably saw greater miracles than i've
[38:31] ever seen
[38:34] but there he's still battling what
[38:36] he's still battling that flesh i'm
[38:38] trusting he was saved i trust he made it
[38:40] right before he went over
[38:42] i never seen a man shout like him cry
[38:44] like him praise like jesus i can still
[38:46] hear him singing when i go to church in
[38:47] the back of my head i can still hear him
[38:48] sing this is my story
[38:52] thank you jesus you'll have this spanish
[38:54] accent
[38:55] this is my song
[38:58] he told me all these testimonies about
[39:00] god doing reckless things
[39:02] one time he was on the highway on 77
[39:04] south
[39:05] and he said he swerved out of his lane
[39:07] and was going head on to a
[39:10] 18-wheel truck and he just shout out
[39:11] jesus and a minute later he woke up on
[39:14] the side of the road and his car was in
[39:16] perfect condition
[39:18] and his wife was passed out as well and
[39:20] they're caught nothing was wrong with
[39:22] their car
[39:24] now that's his and his wife's testimony
[39:26] my my grandfather and grandmother
[39:28] they're both passed on now but church
[39:30] don't tell me that god can't do great
[39:32] miracles like that if god can translate
[39:34] phillip amen
[39:36] if god can translate philip from one
[39:37] city to another can't god translate
[39:39] somebody from the side of the from on
[39:41] the road to the side of the road
[39:43] hallelujah
[39:47] but after all those years
[39:49] he's doing things he know he shouldn't
[39:50] done
[39:51] but i believe in this
[39:53] the blood of jesus christ forgives all
[39:55] our iniquities
[39:56] and i trust the holy spirit brought him
[39:58] to conviction of that even as a 80 some
[40:01] year old man
[40:02] how many want god's grace to cover you
[40:04] all the days of your life
[40:06] how many want an insurance policy from
[40:08] god that lasts from salvation all the
[40:10] way to death
[40:12] i do
[40:14] and of course we never support that
[40:15] right we never support
[40:17] lusting after women
[40:19] but that's the fact of his life
[40:22] we could see mighty miracles but then we
[40:24] could also see the human side the sinful
[40:26] side
[40:28] sin inside of his members
[40:32] here's the point if brother ram said i
[40:34] sin thousands of times a year if you
[40:36] just do 2000 that means you sin almost
[40:39] five and a half times a day
[40:42] so can you relate to that
[40:43] yeah i could relate to that
[40:45] i got mad five times or i lustful
[40:48] thoughts or i had selfish thoughts or i
[40:50] was pride critical thoughts five times
[40:52] oh yeah
[40:54] probably right
[41:00] and then romans
[41:01] paul repeats this in romans the same
[41:04] idea
[41:05] even as david described the blessedness
[41:07] of the man whom god imputed
[41:10] righteousness without works
[41:13] god said i'm just going to make you
[41:14] righteous not because of what you did
[41:16] but because of what i did
[41:18] praise god you just repented and
[41:21] accepted that's all you did was repent
[41:22] and believe
[41:23] and i'm gonna give you jesus
[41:25] righteousness and i'm gonna take your
[41:27] iniquity on on christ
[41:30] and god said blessed are they whose
[41:32] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[41:36] are covered you don't think peter knew
[41:38] he was doing wrong when he separated
[41:40] from the gentiles
[41:42] of course he knew because he'd already
[41:44] met cornelius he'd already eaten with
[41:46] cornelius he stayed there certain days
[41:49] he already said the holy ghost fell on
[41:50] them
[41:51] but years later months later however
[41:53] long it was he got trapped in a trap of
[41:56] the devil
[41:58] and the jewish people convinced him well
[41:59] i'm not going to eat with them anymore
[42:01] maybe they are
[42:02] still living in sin
[42:04] and yet he was a man of god yet he was a
[42:06] prophet
[42:10] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[42:12] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[42:14] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[42:16] not impute sin
[42:18] oh that's the kind of blessed i want to
[42:19] be praise god
[42:21] don't bless me with
[42:22] billions of dollars don't bless me as a
[42:24] ceo bless me with the fact that all my
[42:27] sins are forgiven
[42:28] that's what i want to be blessed with
[42:30] amen
[42:31] hallelujah
[42:34] so there's a quote again
[42:38] and there's there's numerous quotes like
[42:40] this so don't say well he's just using
[42:41] one quote there's numerous quotes like
[42:43] this
[42:47] now let's look at this the it seems to
[42:50] me now it seems to me this the sin
[42:52] brother branham battled most during his
[42:54] life was the critical
[42:56] spirit because he plainly says it in
[42:59] 1954.
[43:02] he'd already been preaching 21 years
[43:06] 21 years i've only been preaching with
[43:09] 2000
[43:11] i gotta do my math now
[43:13] 18 years
[43:15] 18 years he's already been preaching
[43:18] 20 some years
[43:22] 21 years
[43:24] and then he has to repent for calling
[43:26] the church members ricky and regetta
[43:29] and admits he's wrong
[43:32] and then in 1963 he says he lost the
[43:34] feeling for the people wanted to quit
[43:35] going to churches
[43:44] paul had to learn contentment and
[43:46] remember this is one of his not the last
[43:47] letter but one of his last letters
[43:48] before his martyrdom we know second
[43:50] timothy was the last letter
[43:52] but paul said he's talking about the the
[43:55] rejoicing of the philippians and their
[43:57] giving to paul he said not that i speak
[43:59] in respect of want
[44:01] for i have learned in whatever state i
[44:03] am therewith to be content i know how to
[44:06] be humble to based i know how to abound
[44:08] and have lots of natural things
[44:10] everywhere and in all things i'm
[44:12] instructed there is he's taught by the
[44:13] holy spirit
[44:14] both to be full and to be hungry both to
[44:17] abound and to suffer need
[44:20] amen like brother austin was telling me
[44:22] and like we preached on last week when
[44:24] we suffer we have to say thank you lord
[44:26] for allowing me to suffer
[44:28] you're helping me to sup to learn to
[44:30] suffer like you did
[44:32] because we must be partakers of his
[44:34] suffering
[44:35] paul said i've learned both amen i can
[44:37] learn to suffer but i can learn to have
[44:39] abundance but in every state no matter
[44:42] where i am i've learned to be content i
[44:45] can be happy in christ no matter what
[44:47] season i'm going through
[44:49] that's all we need to be praise god
[44:53] so could paul learn yes paul could learn
[44:58] so this means he had to battle being
[45:00] discontent if he learned contentment
[45:02] then he would have battled
[45:03] discontentment
[45:06] some people i'll be honest some people
[45:07] in the message almost worship brother
[45:09] branham and paul like the alpha prophet
[45:11] and the omega prophet
[45:13] they're almost like they're almost like
[45:14] well show me where uh brother ram was
[45:16] ever corrected after the seals show me
[45:18] where paul was ever corrected after he
[45:20] got the revelation well of course the
[45:21] bible don't record everything like that
[45:24] but he's still a man he still said i'm a
[45:27] wretched man that i am
[45:30] what do you think they became after the
[45:32] seals brother man became deity
[45:35] it's foolish
[45:37] he said put all he he said in the in the
[45:39] seventh seal right after the seals were
[45:41] finished brother man said uh he said he
[45:43] said you forget anything about me said
[45:45] put all this grace on jesus christ he
[45:47] said i'm a sinner say by grace amen he
[45:50] said not fit to live and he said none of
[45:52] us are amen
[45:54] he said none of us are fit to live
[45:57] in other words the opening of the seals
[45:59] was all done by the orchestration of
[46:01] jesus christ amen and brother man was
[46:03] just the vessel that he used
[46:06] praise god
[46:12] see that's it's that deity spirit right
[46:13] if they won't worship the tapes then uh
[46:16] like like the fog jeffersonville
[46:18] movement then that deity spirit will get
[46:19] him to worship brother branham and paul
[46:21] after the seals
[46:23] it's just it's ridiculous
[46:25] but you know if they if they love that
[46:27] spirit that's why they get it
[46:32] now here's where he says it church now
[46:34] look i did preparations years ago in
[46:36] that other sanctuary if i'm bringing it
[46:37] back it's like eight years later i'm
[46:39] bringing it back
[46:42] brother branham went to the pulpit
[46:43] brother vang
[46:44] knowing he had a critical spirit
[46:48] and he says i want the church one more
[46:49] thing
[46:50] before or ask the church one more thing
[46:52] before i get to my place scriptures that
[46:54] is that you'll pray for me i've
[46:56] developed a critical spirit in other
[46:58] words i've got trapped into a trap of
[47:01] the enemy and i have i'm trapped in the
[47:04] trap of a critical spirit
[47:06] right like we saw trapped
[47:08] and it what it helps me does it help him
[47:11] haunts him
[47:13] church if you're a real child of god
[47:15] your sins will haunt you too
[47:18] in other words you'll feel bad
[47:19] you won't be condemned but you'll know
[47:21] i'm not i'm not in the middle of the
[47:22] road there it is right there and the
[47:24] church said
[47:26] he's going to the pulpit brother bang to
[47:28] preach the word of god he said pray for
[47:30] me
[47:31] i've got i've developed this
[47:33] i fed this black dog oh there it is my
[47:35] goodness
[47:36] hallelujah i fed the black dog more than
[47:39] the white dog in this in this area of my
[47:40] life
[47:44] i told my wife yesterday the first time
[47:45] something happened now and i was sitting
[47:46] in the yard i told her she reminded me
[47:48] and i told her about it i said honey
[47:49] i've got to a place till i become
[47:50] critical people i don't want to be whose
[47:52] job is it's not mine and god is the one
[47:54] to criticize
[47:56] not me and then if you read the rest of
[47:57] this quote he goes and shows four
[47:59] examples of the people he was critical
[48:01] of
[48:03] he said every time he saw the voice
[48:04] healing magazine he was critical every
[48:06] time he has heard this preacher critical
[48:08] criticize criticize tear down tear down
[48:10] he said pray for me i'm haunted by this
[48:13] and he'd been preaching since 1933
[48:17] 21 years and the church said
[48:21] did you think he do you think he um he
[48:23] never knew a critical spirit was wrong
[48:25] do you think that's what happened
[48:27] or do you think he knew a critical
[48:29] spirit was wrong what do you think
[48:30] church
[48:33] of course he knew it was wrong
[48:35] of course he knew it was wrong to
[48:36] criticize people
[48:38] of course we know it's wrong when we do
[48:40] sins
[48:42] this is supposed to help you church
[48:44] this is going to help you if you really
[48:45] receive this
[48:47] you realize i need the blood for every
[48:49] day every hour i need it all the time
[48:51] because sometimes i'll fall i walk right
[48:53] into the trap because the devil was
[48:55] watching me and he set that trap i
[48:56] walked right into it i knew i should not
[48:58] have done it but if i say i'm sorry god
[49:00] will forgive me amen and i can forget
[49:02] those things of the past amen and i can
[49:04] press on toward the mark of the high
[49:06] calling of god in christ jesus
[49:08] it's going to help us praise god
[49:11] don't tell me brother didn't know what a
[49:12] critical spirit was
[49:14] he'd been preaching for 21 years
[49:17] and he's been criticized this whole
[49:18] ministry there it is right there he's
[49:20] been criticized
[49:21] you don't think he knew what a critical
[49:22] spirit was
[49:24] i'm trying to show you that we
[49:27] we don't sin in our souls but our mind
[49:30] and body sin
[49:32] right and it's called iniquity because
[49:34] we know better but the blood of jesus
[49:36] forgives all iniquity
[49:42] now here's the ricky and ricketta quote
[49:45] it takes the love of god to dash out
[49:47] there on the front line and stand in the
[49:50] gap for the people so what's that mean
[49:52] if there's a gap between the preacher
[49:54] and the people that means the people are
[49:55] lost
[49:56] that means the people have a gap between
[49:58] the preacher and them so brother man
[50:01] said it takes the love of god to stand
[50:02] between people that are being
[50:03] disobedient to stand in the gap and try
[50:06] to unite them to a holy god
[50:08] that's what standing the gap is i'm
[50:10] trying to unite them there's a gap
[50:12] between god and the people it takes
[50:14] god's love amen
[50:15] it takes god's love to go to people that
[50:17] are sinners amen
[50:20] that's going to help you praise god
[50:22] if you when you go to people that are
[50:24] sinners or trapped in their sin that's
[50:25] the love of god moving you to do that
[50:28] i'm trying not to spit on people here
[50:30] guys guys
[50:34] now look what he says and these rickeys
[50:35] and requettas that have so sassed the
[50:38] words
[50:39] and i've called them ricky ricketta god
[50:41] give me to understand
[50:43] i shouldn't do that
[50:45] because that's many of them are still
[50:48] his children
[50:51] he's name-calling god's children when
[50:53] they're not yet in the condition of
[50:55] being saved
[50:59] they can't help because they act so much
[51:01] different some of these old cold former
[51:03] churches have got them that spirit upon
[51:05] them and they're in much in prison as
[51:07] israel was in prison just as much as
[51:08] moses went down to deliver them from
[51:10] slavery human beings that love jesus
[51:12] christ would serve him if they only know
[51:14] what to serve him by i think we can all
[51:17] relate to that oh if only if i had only
[51:19] just known the message sooner i would
[51:21] have obeyed it praise god amen
[51:24] hallelujah same for you same for me if i
[51:26] only got a chance to hear i'd receive it
[51:28] hallelujah
[51:32] and they're in bondage under
[51:34] denominationalism that tells them don't
[51:36] do this and you don't do that
[51:39] but the call of god must come whoever
[51:41] wants the march towards the promised
[51:42] land let it march
[51:44] we're on our road to the promised land
[51:46] amen let them come march we're on a road
[51:48] to meet christ at the end time and i
[51:50] wanted to bring this to you so that you
[51:51] would see and show you that the mistake
[51:53] that a man can get yet being sincere so
[51:56] brother and preach this sermon stand in
[51:58] the gap again this kind of review for
[51:59] some of you
[52:01] to show that he developed a sinful
[52:03] complex
[52:05] because god had to correct him on his
[52:06] attitude
[52:07] his critical attitude toward the people
[52:09] that were in denominations and weren't
[52:11] living the right way
[52:15] and he lost his compassion can we all
[52:18] say can everybody say compassion can we
[52:19] compassion
[52:21] he lost his compassion for sinners
[52:24] have you ever done that
[52:27] have you ever thought well they deserve
[52:29] i thought that about government leaders
[52:31] because they're murderers
[52:33] but i've got to say god forgive me i
[52:34] don't want to judge them i want to pray
[52:36] for them
[52:38] they murder all these babies
[52:40] if they don't repent no doubt they're
[52:41] going to hell
[52:42] but i don't want to have a critical
[52:44] spirit toward them with no hope or
[52:45] anything
[52:46] i want to i want to have a feeling to
[52:48] for them that i can still pray for them
[52:54] so brother ram says i want to preach a
[52:56] sermon so you can know that even men
[52:57] like me prophets can make mistakes
[53:00] and yet know better
[53:04] something's got to change and mean now
[53:06] look he's at the pulpit again preaching
[53:09] i'm the only preacher in here brother
[53:11] sergey are you preacher brother
[53:12] okay pray so you and i can relate to
[53:14] this okay and it's okay if you can't
[53:15] relate to it it's okay but sometimes
[53:17] church we got to come up here and we're
[53:19] battling complexes
[53:21] we're battling spirits
[53:24] in our own lives
[53:25] if brother ram did it you think sergey
[53:27] and i are
[53:28] are void from that we don't have to deal
[53:29] with that
[53:31] of course we do
[53:34] he said before brother man said before i
[53:36] go out to the other churches outside of
[53:37] jeffersonville in my heart if i go out
[53:39] there feeling the way i do now i still
[53:42] feel they ought to have heard the
[53:43] message they ought to have done it and i
[53:45] don't have the feeling for the people
[53:46] that i should have until i can get that
[53:48] feeling there's no need in me going
[53:50] because i'd be a hypocrite
[53:52] look what his attitude was they should
[53:54] have already received it so i'm not
[53:55] going to go to them
[53:57] now what about our attitude
[53:58] my family member hasn't received the
[54:00] message yet why are they gave them a
[54:01] book
[54:02] why are you already pray for them
[54:06] don't feel that way don't lose the
[54:07] feeling don't lose the feeling
[54:09] of the people
[54:10] don't lose your compassion
[54:12] that's actually a snare of the enemy
[54:16] right
[54:19] they should have heard it by now how
[54:20] could they were raised in it or you know
[54:24] i've told them how many times i gave
[54:26] them this i gave that
[54:28] don't lose your compassion as a
[54:30] christian
[54:32] and all these years i've tried to serve
[54:34] them with a true heart and i won't go
[54:35] out there being a hypocrite i got to
[54:37] feel that that it isn't ricky and
[54:39] ricketta's out there in the churches it
[54:41] isn't this bunch it's god's children
[54:42] that's in bondage
[54:45] that i must go until i can feel that way
[54:48] i'll just have to loaf around preach
[54:50] some conventions and things but wait
[54:53] so brother bran wanted to feel that the
[54:54] complex left him before he went
[54:57] praise god don't we want to feel victory
[54:59] before we try to do something for god
[55:02] i want to know i'm delivered first
[55:03] before i start trying to do something
[55:05] i want to know my feeling has changed my
[55:07] attitude has changed
[55:09] praise god
[55:11] god bless you each one and we hope to
[55:13] see you again real soon until then will
[55:14] you do me this one favor oh what do you
[55:16] want a prophet of god
[55:18] both here and on tapes also pray that
[55:20] god will place into my heart
[55:23] that's something that i lost out there
[55:26] in that complex
[55:28] it's so easy to build a complex
[55:34] will you pray that god will place it in
[55:35] there now the only way god god can't
[55:37] force it in there oh there we go
[55:40] so in other words he's saying pray for
[55:42] me that i will surrender my complex
[55:46] and that i will receive that compassion
[55:48] back in my heart because god's not gonna
[55:50] force you to do anything
[55:52] he's not gonna force you to obey he's
[55:54] not gonna force you to disobey that's
[55:55] the beauty of free more agency
[55:59] amen praise god hallelujah
[56:02] in other words pray for me that i'll
[56:04] repent of my complex and god's love can
[56:06] come back into my heart where it should
[56:08] be and i know it should be
[56:11] so is this a new sin to brother branham
[56:13] the critical spirit complex or is this
[56:15] an older thing he's fought for years
[56:18] hmm
[56:20] sounds like he's known about it for
[56:21] years
[56:24] oh bro jess i would never do that okay
[56:25] well let me watch your life for a few
[56:27] days
[56:28] let me go back and uh
[56:30] let me reference when we had that
[56:32] conversation about five years ago
[56:34] and you're still struggling with that
[56:35] same thing just like me
[56:37] right just like all of us amen we're
[56:38] human praise god
[56:42] brother iran was prone
[56:44] to battle a critical spirit
[56:46] what about those that are prone and
[56:48] brother the preacher will know it those
[56:50] that are prone to battle depression
[56:53] those that are prone to battle lust
[56:56] that's just that's that's their battle
[56:58] they got to overcome that battle how
[57:00] about lying those that are prone they
[57:02] don't tell the truth they exaggerated a
[57:03] lot
[57:09] we'll get victory for a while feel real
[57:11] good but then a trap will be set
[57:13] and we know it's wrong
[57:15] and sometimes we walk right in that
[57:19] it's so hard to build a complex no
[57:22] it's so easy
[57:24] to build a complex
[57:27] see we're not constantly checking up our
[57:29] lives with the word of god
[57:31] daily repenting and the church said
[57:34] repenting at every service i just know
[57:36] when is it going to get done i enjoyed
[57:38] it but when can we move on
[57:41] you shouldn't move on from the word take
[57:43] the word with you amen
[57:44] don't move on from the word take the
[57:46] word with you praise god
[57:48] keep your life clean
[57:50] it's so easy
[57:52] to fall into a trap of the enemy
[57:55] isn't it
[57:56] i can say amen to that
[57:58] it's so easy it's not hard it's easy
[58:02] see now look church everybody battles in
[58:04] these three errors you might battle more
[58:06] in the lust of the flesh the flesh wants
[58:08] something
[58:10] you might battle with the lust of the
[58:11] eyes the eyes want to
[58:13] go do that
[58:14] the pride of life so where is brother
[58:15] brown the pride of life if you're
[58:16] criticizing others if you're if you
[58:19] expect them to repent on your timetable
[58:20] rather than god's that's pride
[58:23] come on church
[58:26] you're going to battle you and i are
[58:28] going to battle on one of these errors
[58:29] i'm not going to walk around and say
[58:30] brother bang which one do you battle but
[58:32] amen which one sister brother sister
[58:34] nina brother which one you battle no you
[58:36] know
[58:38] take 10 seconds now and think about what
[58:40] did you struggle with yesterday where
[58:42] does it fall under here
[58:44] sometimes it's all three
[58:47] praise god
[58:49] amen
[58:50] let's not act like we're holy rollers
[58:52] around here and
[58:53] never make a mistake never sin
[58:56] that's a liar
[58:58] sometimes you'll battle it for years
[59:02] but my god's grace is sufficient
[59:04] your god's grace is sufficient in your
[59:07] weakness
[59:08] hallelujah
[59:11] in other words you know the doctrine's
[59:12] right but you still disobey it
[59:17] not in every area but just maybe one or
[59:19] two little areas
[59:24] i appreciate an honest church don't you
[59:28] i appreciate honest preachers
[59:31] brother bran was i'm sorry brother
[59:32] abraham not really brother abraham was
[59:34] over 75 god told him don't you leave
[59:37] canaan and he left when a famine came
[59:40] do you think he knew better church what
[59:41] do you think did you do
[59:43] when abraham lied twice about sarah do
[59:44] you think he knew better or not dude
[59:45] what do you think
[59:47] or is that new oh i shouldn't lie about
[59:48] my wife
[59:51] do you think so
[59:52] or was that iniquity was that a new
[59:54] thing or was that iniquity
[59:57] thank god he forgives all our iniquities
[1:00:00] praise god
[1:00:01] if he forgave abraham's amen then he
[1:00:04] forgives me and mine because i'm a child
[1:00:06] of abraham
[1:00:07] your children of abraham by faith in
[1:00:09] jesus amen
[1:00:12] if you forgive abraham's sins you're
[1:00:13] going to forgive your sins too
[1:00:16] we have a better covenant with better
[1:00:17] promises
[1:00:19] david fell to it he did all the will of
[1:00:21] god the bible said he only fell with the
[1:00:23] area of bathsheba but the bible still
[1:00:25] says adultery murder and pride when he
[1:00:27] numbered the people
[1:00:30] you don't think he knew better than the
[1:00:32] number of people of course he did that's
[1:00:33] why god killed what was it 23 000 or was
[1:00:35] it 70 something so it might have been 70
[1:00:37] 000 do you remember
[1:00:39] okay it was in second samuel he numbered
[1:00:42] the people in his life and 20 or 50 80
[1:00:44] some 70 000 some huge number of people
[1:00:47] died
[1:00:50] because he got the pride of life
[1:00:54] the iniquity of pride that he fell into
[1:00:57] this is to encourage you
[1:00:59] i hope everybody's encouraged
[1:01:03] just face it you're going to commit
[1:01:04] iniquities
[1:01:05] and if you don't please come tell me the
[1:01:07] secret like what is the secret
[1:01:09] because if anybody needs to know it's
[1:01:10] the preacher
[1:01:12] well i know there is no secret
[1:01:14] the secret is you've got two laws in you
[1:01:16] and you're not perfect and you need a
[1:01:18] savior
[1:01:19] and god wants you to grow in the
[1:01:21] knowledge and the grace of the lord
[1:01:22] jesus christ
[1:01:25] god wants you to forget the things that
[1:01:27] are behind you and press on toward the
[1:01:29] mark of the high calling of god in
[1:01:31] christ jesus
[1:01:35] you can't say david knew better
[1:01:37] abraham knew better brother branham knew
[1:01:39] better brother jesse knows better all of
[1:01:42] our brothers and sisters here we know
[1:01:44] better
[1:01:45] these aren't new things
[1:01:49] i shouldn't yell my children i shouldn't
[1:01:52] i shouldn't do that
[1:01:54] hey i shouldn't i shouldn't go to that
[1:01:56] website i shouldn't look at that
[1:01:58] you know better
[1:02:00] i shouldn't say that
[1:02:02] you knew better
[1:02:06] now a real holy ghost-filled saying will
[1:02:08] only go so far so i'm not given a
[1:02:09] license for sin
[1:02:12] you can only go so far if you're really
[1:02:13] born again if not get born again
[1:02:17] that's what brother man said the holy
[1:02:18] ghost keeps you from major sins
[1:02:20] he said you'll do minor ones but you
[1:02:22] won't do major ones
[1:02:24] that's right
[1:02:27] now here's kind of where i wanted to get
[1:02:28] to let's see yeah so get your bibles
[1:02:30] here second timothy 3 1.
[1:02:33] that's all what i wanted to see i
[1:02:34] thought i'd preach all that on wednesday
[1:02:36] night see
[1:02:38] i just i always underestimate how much
[1:02:40] preaching i have
[1:02:41] second timothy 3 1.
[1:02:54] let me look at the rest of my notes yeah
[1:02:55] i got a lot so i have to skip some
[1:03:01] okay ii timothy 3 1. what i'll do is
[1:03:04] i'll just preach this and i'll bring it
[1:03:05] down to close because it's almost 12 now
[1:03:07] i've almost had an hour and a half to
[1:03:08] preach to you
[1:03:10] what's going on here
[1:03:12] somebody's messing with that clock
[1:03:14] trustees you go investigate everybody
[1:03:16] somebody mess with that clock
[1:03:18] somebody's cutting off my preaching time
[1:03:23] i should say please go check no
[1:03:25] it's not i'm just joking second timothy
[1:03:27] 3 1.
[1:03:30] now this is an absolute rebuke for
[1:03:33] laodicea
[1:03:35] this is an absolute
[1:03:37] rebuke on the sin loving churches
[1:03:41] of laodicea because it's the last days
[1:03:45] verse one know this also then the last
[1:03:46] days perilous or dangerous times shall
[1:03:49] come it also means fierce times aren't
[1:03:51] we living in a fierce time
[1:03:53] you can say one thing and people will
[1:03:55] fiercely
[1:03:56] oh man that was fierce
[1:03:59] just for saying i love jesus
[1:04:02] they'll fiercely oppose you
[1:04:04] oh you're against homosexuality
[1:04:07] but
[1:04:08] fears
[1:04:12] you believe in paying ties
[1:04:15] they'll blow you up
[1:04:18] you believe brother braham can be
[1:04:19] corrected
[1:04:20] but he said no over and over again i
[1:04:22] could be corrected i want to be
[1:04:24] corrected
[1:04:26] fierce times we're living in
[1:04:27] that's okay we got a strong god
[1:04:29] and don't forget he gave us six pieces
[1:04:32] of armor amen
[1:04:34] god would not put us in this awful
[1:04:37] perilous troublesome fierce times
[1:04:38] without giving us protection amen
[1:04:41] hallelujah the sword of the spirit amen
[1:04:44] all the other six pieces the armor of
[1:04:46] god you're equipped with so saints don't
[1:04:48] worry don't run stand in that evil day
[1:04:51] stand against the wiles of the enemy
[1:04:54] they think they're fierce but i'll tell
[1:04:55] you really you're more fierce
[1:04:59] who's more fierce the devil or god amen
[1:05:02] you're more fierce amen
[1:05:05] hallelujah when you stand on god's word
[1:05:11] who's more dangerous the devil are you
[1:05:12] you're more dangerous
[1:05:14] because you've got god's word
[1:05:16] just got to use it
[1:05:18] glory
[1:05:21] now look at this next slide here
[1:05:23] i got two lists so here's
[1:05:26] verses one uh
[1:05:32] i went to the wrong chapter that's why i
[1:05:34] was having trouble one to five verses
[1:05:36] one to five and then here's verses
[1:05:41] 10
[1:05:43] 10 and 11.
[1:05:45] so one to five in the same chapter so
[1:05:47] we're going to look at here's what the
[1:05:49] last days or fierce dangerous times look
[1:05:51] like but here's paul's example so this
[1:05:54] is a contrast between evil and good
[1:05:58] how do we overcome all this evil the
[1:06:00] last days paul tells us have paul's
[1:06:02] doctrine
[1:06:06] observe his manner of life
[1:06:08] his purpose his faith his long suffering
[1:06:11] his charity his patience that long
[1:06:12] suffering you can suffer a long time
[1:06:14] somebody won't repent that's okay i can
[1:06:16] suffer a long time with them
[1:06:20] patience
[1:06:22] so look at this list we don't have to
[1:06:23] read it but i'll read it quickly self
[1:06:25] love
[1:06:26] we have to make sure we don't love
[1:06:27] ourselves
[1:06:29] praise god
[1:06:30] we gotta take care of ourselves like
[1:06:32] brother said you gotta take care of
[1:06:33] god's man
[1:06:34] take care of god's woman don't wear her
[1:06:36] out don't wear them out
[1:06:38] but don't love yourself
[1:06:41] covetous they want everything boasters
[1:06:43] braggers
[1:06:45] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:06:48] unthankful they never say thank you
[1:06:50] unholy without natural fiction they
[1:06:53] don't love children that's why they love
[1:06:54] abortions right they don't love natural
[1:06:56] men and women marriages
[1:06:58] truce breakers they break their
[1:06:59] covenants false accusers incontinent
[1:07:02] fierce despisers those that are good
[1:07:04] traders heady high-minded lovers of
[1:07:06] pleasures more lovers of god having a
[1:07:08] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:07:10] there where's the power paul it's in my
[1:07:12] doctrine
[1:07:14] hallelujah
[1:07:17] that's what jesus said
[1:07:19] jesus was known for his power and his
[1:07:21] doctrine praise god
[1:07:23] what new doctrine is this jesus you walk
[1:07:25] into a synagogue you teach and you cast
[1:07:27] out devils what new doctrine is this
[1:07:29] this is the kingdom of god amen
[1:07:31] that's our doctrine praise god
[1:07:34] the kingdom or rulership of god but also
[1:07:37] you have a question buddy
[1:07:43] uh like worship like uh
[1:07:46] it all it's all in the motivation so
[1:07:48] like if you're working out to stay
[1:07:49] healthy well if you're looking at the
[1:07:50] mirror and saying oh man look at
[1:07:54] that i think this is my best side you
[1:07:57] know
[1:07:59] that that's where it's become sinful but
[1:08:00] if you're eating right and uh you know
[1:08:02] trying to drink water and all those good
[1:08:04] things and that's not worshiping you
[1:08:06] that's saying lord i want to keep this
[1:08:08] body healthy so i'm not sick so i can
[1:08:10] serve you better
[1:08:12] right that's kind of how i
[1:08:14] you got to look at the motivation is it
[1:08:15] for me to get attention or is it for me
[1:08:17] to serve god
[1:08:19] that's a very quick answer but i'm sure
[1:08:21] we could give more
[1:08:23] that's a great question brother
[1:08:28] so paul how are you going to overcome
[1:08:30] this he said verse 10 but you have known
[1:08:33] my doctrine
[1:08:35] see doctrine doesn't allow this
[1:08:37] doctrine doesn't teach self-love that's
[1:08:39] what the that's what the prosperity
[1:08:40] gospel is all about see i could i could
[1:08:42] preach a sermon on all these
[1:08:44] all false doctrines
[1:08:46] and how they're all in the not the
[1:08:48] nominal churches
[1:08:50] self-love lovers of pleasures more and
[1:08:52] over to god in the next chapter paul
[1:08:54] said they're ever learning but never
[1:08:55] able to come to knowledge of truth but
[1:08:57] brother sergey knows it they can learn
[1:08:58] hebrew words they can learn greek
[1:09:00] language but they can never come to the
[1:09:02] fact that the lord jesus christ is the
[1:09:04] name of god
[1:09:05] how do they miss that amen
[1:09:07] they'll go to greek and hebrew to prove
[1:09:09] three persons which is three gods
[1:09:11] right or they'll go to greek and hebrews
[1:09:13] say women can preach which is the
[1:09:14] jezebel spirit the demonic antichrist
[1:09:17] spirit ruling over the churches
[1:09:19] hiding behind a beautiful woman with
[1:09:20] high heels on
[1:09:22] and paint all over her face it's from
[1:09:23] hell
[1:09:25] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:09:27] god they won't endure they won't put up
[1:09:29] with sound doctrine they'll close their
[1:09:31] ears say don't preach it i don't want to
[1:09:32] hear i don't want to hear it
[1:09:33] and they're the ones that shouldn't be
[1:09:35] heard
[1:09:36] they're the ones that should close their
[1:09:37] preachers their churches
[1:09:40] because they're preaching doctrines of
[1:09:41] devils
[1:09:44] so paul how are you different than the
[1:09:45] perilous times the last days my doctrine
[1:09:48] made me different
[1:09:49] they all had miracles they all had the
[1:09:51] anointing the anointed ones at the end
[1:09:53] times i thank god for the anointing but
[1:09:55] i got more of anointing just to do
[1:09:56] miracles i got anointing to have the
[1:09:58] manner of life the purpose the doctrine
[1:10:01] that paul had
[1:10:02] amen
[1:10:03] hallelujah
[1:10:06] faith long suffering charity patience
[1:10:11] and then god delivered me from all my
[1:10:12] trials oh thank you jesus and look at
[1:10:15] verse 12. i didn't get to verse 12.
[1:10:18] yeah all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:10:20] will suffer persecution
[1:10:22] so get ready for it if you're living
[1:10:24] right you're gonna have to suffer
[1:10:26] you haven't yet already
[1:10:29] verse 13 but evil men and seducers so
[1:10:31] false teachers are going to get worse
[1:10:33] yes
[1:10:34] they're actually get worse with their
[1:10:36] false doctrine
[1:10:38] deceiving and being deceived
[1:10:42] seeing as long as they love that false
[1:10:44] evil spirit you can never convince them
[1:10:46] anyway
[1:10:47] you can't convince them you can't
[1:10:49] they'll never hear soundness they'll
[1:10:51] never hear this is healthy this is this
[1:10:53] is true i can see this
[1:10:54] they'll never until they until they
[1:10:56] repent of loving that lie
[1:10:59] and that spirit that goes with it
[1:11:00] they'll never see the truth but that's
[1:11:02] fine paul said you know my life
[1:11:05] you know my doctrine
[1:11:08] you know the doctrine unto godliness
[1:11:12] that's what that's what the false
[1:11:13] churches don't have they don't have
[1:11:14] godly lives
[1:11:17] right like my one friend
[1:11:19] he loves god but he was so off he told
[1:11:21] four-year-olds that they can do greater
[1:11:23] miracles in jesus because greater work
[1:11:25] shall these shall these do because i go
[1:11:27] to my father that's a that's a total
[1:11:29] false understanding of that scripture
[1:11:31] jesus meant more works
[1:11:34] not greater who's going to do greater
[1:11:36] than jesus nobody can do greater than
[1:11:37] jesus
[1:11:38] nobody's greater than jesus
[1:11:40] i love jesus jesus you're greater than
[1:11:42] everybody amen amen
[1:11:45] hallelujah
[1:11:46] and the same guy teaches a few weeks
[1:11:48] later that's okay to watch black panther
[1:11:51] now i've never watched it but i heard a
[1:11:52] preacher say they do demonic ceremonies
[1:11:55] on that they bury people in sand and
[1:11:57] they have a cult they have occult
[1:11:59] sessions right there
