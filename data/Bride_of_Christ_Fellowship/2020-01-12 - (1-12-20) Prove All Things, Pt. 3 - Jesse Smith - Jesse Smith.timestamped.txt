[38:41] in Jesus Christ the church said he must
[38:46] remain standing to take our Bibles here
[38:47] let's go to our memory verse Matthew
[38:49] chapter 5 here verse 3 Matthew 5 verse 3
[39:15] we'll go three to twelve by God's grace
[39:29] remember psalm 119 verse 19 says thy
[39:32] word have I sorry 19:11 thy word have I
[39:35] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[39:37] against thee let's recruit these
[39:40] together as we as we can by God's grace
[39:43] Matthew 5:3
[39:45] 2:12 let's begin on three one two three
[39:50] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[39:53] theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed
[39:56] are they that mourn for they shall be
[39:59] comforted blessed are the meek for they
[40:02] shall inherit the earth
[40:04] blessed are they which do hunger and
[40:07] thirst after righteousness for they
[40:10] shall be filled
[40:11] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[40:14] obtain mercy blessed are the pure in
[40:17] heart for they shall see God blessed are
[40:21] the peacemakers for they shall be called
[40:24] the children of God blessed are they
[40:27] which are
[40:27] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[40:30] theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed
[40:33] are ye when men shall revile you and
[40:36] persecute you and say all manner of evil
[40:39] against you falsely for my sake
[40:42] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[40:45] is your reward in heaven for so
[40:48] persecuted they the prophets which were
[40:51] before you praise God let's read one
[40:53] more scripture if you go to first
[40:54] Thessalonians 5 verse 21 let's read that
[40:57] again I'd like to preach again on prove
[40:59] all things this morning part 3 verse
[41:03] essence 5:21 so we said last Sunday this
[41:11] is right after Paul's text on the
[41:14] rapture and encouraging the Saints that
[41:18] they will not taste of the wrath of God
[41:21] but they've passed from death they pass
[41:23] from wrath and death unto life and he
[41:25] tells them these last parting words in
[41:27] this letter Matthew I'm sorry 1st
[41:30] Thessalonians 5:21 let's read that on
[41:32] three one two three
[41:33] prove all things hold fast that which is
[41:37] good may God add his blessings agree of
[41:39] his work may be seated
[41:53] I'd like to take as said a few more
[41:55] sermons on this and kind of prove why
[42:01] you know we follow brother Branham and
[42:03] kind of answer maybe questions that
[42:06] you've heard I know I've heard a lot and
[42:10] so I'd like to continue look at these
[42:12] things you can switch over I do have
[42:13] some slides to show I just want to
[42:16] remind you of a few things here you know
[42:22] the Bible says Jesus said the Holy Ghost
[42:24] will bring all things to your
[42:25] remembrance as you have need of it and
[42:27] so we were thankful for that and some of
[42:30] these things I'm just encouraged as we
[42:32] are reminded of them the Lord is so
[42:35] merciful you know again I made this
[42:41] video a few years ago and why believe
[42:43] brother bran is and I guess you could
[42:45] say is still a prophet like Samuel still
[42:47] was a prophet even after he passed away
[42:49] but as far as in the land the living we
[42:52] would say he was a prophet because he's
[42:54] no longer in the land of the living
[42:56] David speaks of that the land of the
[42:58] living so I made that video you know
[43:01] three prophecies a brother Branham and I
[43:02] found five you know I'm sure there's
[43:04] more but there's at least five
[43:07] requirements for a genuine prophet live
[43:10] a godly life of holiness Paul talked
[43:12] about that remember he was trying to
[43:14] prove to the Corinthians that he was a
[43:15] real man of God he started the church
[43:17] but then wolves had came in and tried to
[43:20] persuade them that Paul maybe wasn't a
[43:23] faithful man of God but he went through
[43:25] his list of all the things that he did
[43:27] he said you know other preachers can
[43:29] have wives he said I could have a wife
[43:31] but I don't have one
[43:33] he said other preachers you know take
[43:35] the tithes and offerings he said I don't
[43:37] do that and he goes through all the
[43:39] reasons why he lived such a godly life
[43:42] of holiness and it was to to make sure
[43:46] that he was not a shipwreck praise God
[43:48] he said he had to beat his body and
[43:50] bring it under subjection so Paul
[43:53] realized in his experience to keep
[43:56] himself pure he had to sacrifice more
[43:59] and I think we can gain a great lesson
[44:01] from that that we've got to be able to
[44:02] sacrifice to keep our sincerity before
[44:05] God because as time goes on our bodies
[44:08] get more tired our minds get more tired
[44:10] we're prone to be lazy if we're if we're
[44:14] not sacrificing praise God if we just
[44:19] give and it's we don't feel the pain of
[44:21] it then there's no sacrifice we have to
[44:24] feel the pain of sacrifice that was the
[44:26] power of animal sacrifices because they
[44:30] would raise these animals upright and
[44:32] they would love these animals but then
[44:34] to see the firstborn that you know the
[44:37] firstborn lamb at the Passover the
[44:38] firstborn lamb the most precious lamb
[44:41] the one that you loved the longest to
[44:43] see that one died a year old to see that
[44:47] one die and give its life would have
[44:49] such an impact on the owner and the
[44:52] family and so that was the power the
[44:54] animal
[44:55] it would it could cleanse the flesh but
[44:57] it can never purge the conscience praise
[45:00] God so the sinner would offer would
[45:02] offer the sacrifice they would feel bad
[45:04] they know they'd be forgiven in their
[45:06] flesh but their conscience would still
[45:08] be plagued knowing that they they they
[45:13] left feeling the same way towards sin as
[45:15] when they came but we've got a greater
[45:18] power than that amen thank the Hun we've
[45:22] got to let the presence of the Holy
[45:24] Spirit be dear to us praise God
[45:26] that we don't we don't we won't see the
[45:28] animal sacrifice but we've got a we got
[45:31] experience the the spirit of Jesus
[45:34] praise God the spirit of God sacrifice
[45:36] his Holy Spirit to renew our minds
[45:39] praise God and to renew our walk with
[45:42] the Lord so Paul had this way of
[45:45] holiness about him proving that he was a
[45:48] genuine prophet but also he taught the
[45:52] Word of God in his purity Paul said if
[45:54] anyone teach anything other than what I
[45:56] first teach or taught rather let him be
[45:59] a curse in Galatians 1 and every
[46:02] preacher should have converts to Christ
[46:04] as fruit of their ministry praise God
[46:07] you know I just had somebody call me
[46:10] yesterday I didn't get a chance to come
[46:12] back but a couple years ago when I
[46:13] preached out Minnesota a sister came out
[46:16] for prayer afterwards I remember her
[46:18] name but I don't want to say it because
[46:19] you know people might talk but she
[46:23] called me yesterday left me a voicemail
[46:24] saying you know of all the preachers she
[46:26] said you stand out to me you know I
[46:28] appreciate my pastors she said but you
[46:29] stand out to me as a real man of God she
[46:31] said can you call me back and I got a
[46:33] question for you
[46:34] so I haven't really caught her back
[46:36] because I I want her to ask her past her
[46:37] first you know before she calls me but
[46:40] you know she still remembers the
[46:42] ministry from three or four years ago
[46:43] that the Holy Spirit brought there and
[46:48] that that's fruit of our ministry you
[46:50] know our lives your life my life should
[46:54] speak and influence others praise God
[46:57] you know we're in the age of the you put
[46:59] YouTube age where you know what they
[47:00] call themselves you don't youtubers call
[47:02] them some creators if they call
[47:05] themselves influencers
[47:08] and Bella Bram preached a message
[47:09] influence hey before they call
[47:12] themselves that Amen that's what we are
[47:14] we're creators were minor creators and
[47:18] were minor influencers amen
[47:20] praise God they're just stealing it from
[47:22] us cuz we are the original ones I'm
[47:25] talking about believers praise God every
[47:27] believer was a minor creator praise God
[47:29] was a minor influencer and that's what
[47:33] our lives are to be if we're supposed to
[47:34] have fruit to it we should be able to
[47:36] look back at our lives and say my the
[47:38] Lord has used me to influence that
[47:39] person the Lord has used me to help that
[47:42] person and those are fruit to your
[47:44] ministry praise God and then also
[47:46] prophets now this is genuinely a prophet
[47:49] requirement not not most of us but
[47:53] prophets reveal the secrets that were
[47:55] previously hidden praise God and that's
[47:58] one thing brother Branham ministry has
[48:00] clearly done and we're beginning to that
[48:03] more as we go to the believe this side
[48:04] right now we're on the Jeffersonville
[48:07] kind of false teachings but we'll go
[48:10] Lord willing we'll go to the believe the
[48:12] sign ones after that and that's one that
[48:14] they really fall off and they really
[48:16] miss that one a lot of course the
[48:19] Jefferson bill will follow a lot of
[48:20] these but they'll actually exalt brother
[48:24] Branham above where he should be exalted
[48:25] because they he doesn't deserve any
[48:27] exaltation he deserves honor every
[48:30] person deserves honor but Paul said
[48:33] honor all men and were to give them
[48:35] honor which means respect in the fear of
[48:37] the Lord in other words we don't exalt
[48:40] we should prefer others above ourselves
[48:42] right we shouldn't say oh I'm better
[48:45] than that preacher or I'm better than
[48:46] that sister no we should we should
[48:48] prefer them above ourselves that's
[48:50] giving them honor praise God
[48:53] but not worship and not exaltation and
[48:57] they should have the anointing of the
[48:59] Holy Ghost for Supernatural signs and
[49:01] prophecy so I kind of put signs miracles
[49:04] and wonders and prophecies as one I
[49:06] think just to save room I think on that
[49:08] study but brother Branham meets all
[49:10] those requirements praise God
[49:12] that's why I know he's a genuine prophet
[49:14] of God now I added this list a couple
[49:18] weeks ago I actually forgot the seven
[49:20] seals I put that on there
[49:21] totally that was one of the major
[49:23] secrets that his his ministry revealed
[49:26] all these mysteries all these uh all
[49:29] these truths that were lost are now
[49:33] restored by the Ministry of God's profit
[49:37] you know this morning I was just looking
[49:39] at Baptist ministers and different ones
[49:41] I used to follow and they still they
[49:44] still don't believe that Jews can be
[49:46] saved like right now they though they
[49:49] believe Jews will be saved 144,000 but
[49:51] they don't see it now why don't they see
[49:52] it because they don't have the
[49:53] revelation of the fifth seal because God
[49:57] has got to show that that the souls
[50:00] under the altar who quiet cry out for
[50:02] revenge and do not have robes of eternal
[50:04] life those have to be Jews because
[50:06] Christians have eternal life now and
[50:09] don't call out for revenge that's a
[50:11] great mystery that they miss and so all
[50:14] these truths are lost and God had to
[50:17] send his prophet to come in and finish
[50:19] all the mysteries of God amen
[50:21] hallelujah thank the Lord so this is why
[50:27] I believe because he met all the
[50:29] requirements praise God but as I showed
[50:34] has been showing the last few weeks and
[50:35] over the course of my whole ministry
[50:37] I've always been who showed how brother
[50:38] man's a man just like I'm a man just
[50:40] like you're a human you know his
[50:42] mistakes and mine and anyone we have at
[50:45] least three causes we could have our own
[50:47] personal opinions and me wrong we can
[50:50] just say an honest mistake we can just
[50:52] make an honest genuine human mistake but
[50:56] in wrong but it's not a sin other than
[51:00] being wrong or we can have personal sins
[51:02] where we actually purposely sin right
[51:05] and that's what we showed on Wednesday
[51:08] night hopefully got the chance to listen
[51:09] that program purposely sin he purposely
[51:11] lied to the IRS he knew what he was
[51:14] doing you know and he admits that and so
[51:18] you can put these you know at least in
[51:21] his mistakes in at least one of these
[51:23] categories but remember Church you don't
[51:26] we're not we're not making program look
[51:28] bad we're not trying to do that but just
[51:30] trying to show that he was man and he
[51:32] was fallible but with thus saith the
[51:36] Lord I still believe he was infallible
[51:39] like st. Paul like Moses like Isaiah
[51:43] right like Haggai and Zechariah any true
[51:46] prophet of God is infallible with thus
[51:48] saith the Lord and so I'm I was reminded
[51:52] of 2nd Timothy 1 verse 8 I don't have it
[51:54] up here but be thou therefore I'm sorry
[51:57] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[51:59] testimony of our Lord
[52:01] so that's Christ nor of me his prisoner
[52:07] praise God so Paul says don't be ashamed
[52:10] of my testimony now I've said this
[52:12] before but imagine you know you're in
[52:16] Jerusalem and you're worse when you're a
[52:17] Christian in the days of Paul and you
[52:19] talk to maybe your neighbor and you find
[52:21] out they find out oh you're one of those
[52:23] Christians and you know there are
[52:26] staunch Jew and they kind of corn you
[52:29] and say oh how can you be a Christian
[52:31] when Paul you know he he used to try to
[52:33] eat just to take some of you guys to
[52:35] jail and now he's on your side and he
[52:37] was that were there when Steven was mark
[52:40] how can you be a Christian some of your
[52:43] own followers you know kill people and
[52:45] were put their death and so Paul's
[52:48] saying don't be ashamed of my testimony
[52:51] and you'd have to have the wisdom of the
[52:53] Holy Spirit to tell your neighbor yeah
[52:56] Paul was he had a made bad decisions he
[53:01] made mistakes but the but the grace of
[53:03] God has extended the Paul I'm a him in
[53:06] the same grace that extended Paul is the
[53:08] same grace that saved me amen glory he
[53:13] said don't be ashamed of me and my
[53:16] testimony as his prisoner praise God as
[53:21] I said last Sunday you know I kind of
[53:24] went through that list of other
[53:26] preachers you know that that the
[53:29] believers who made mistakes
[53:31] you know how John saw the vision of the
[53:34] the dove but yet he doubted the Messiah
[53:36] and Peter denied Christ before the Holy
[53:41] Ghost but after the Holy Ghost he didn't
[53:42] want to eat with Gentiles and kind of it
[53:44] was discriminatory
[53:47] and that there's so many more things
[53:50] that that people did but you had to be
[53:52] able to look past that and realize God
[53:55] allowed that to humble that person and
[53:58] God allowed that so we wouldn't exalt a
[54:01] man we wouldn't exalt flesh above what
[54:04] we're supposed to right we wouldn't give
[54:06] extra honor to people so so God allows
[54:10] brother brand to make mistakes to show
[54:13] that he's not God just like you and I
[54:17] make mistakes and so these are the
[54:20] purposes here or at least the causes
[54:23] rather of the mistakes that the brother
[54:25] man makes and and I let me just show
[54:27] those from Wednesday I don't know if
[54:29] everybody got a chance to listen to it
[54:30] but I just want to go show those quotes
[54:32] real quick about exaggeration but a man
[54:35] admitted that he he would exaggerate
[54:37] yeah hear this he said so now I want you
[54:40] listen the last two nights I'll say this
[54:42] may God help me not to exaggerate but
[54:44] just be as honest as I believe from my
[54:46] heart he praised and said God helped me
[54:49] not to exaggerate he's I'm not very good
[54:52] at making or estimating crowds because I
[54:53] usually exaggerate on it so brother man
[54:58] realized he had this human behavior
[55:02] where he'd often exaggerate and he asked
[55:05] God to help him not to exaggerate and so
[55:12] you've got to keep this in mind you know
[55:13] as you as you listen and as we grow but
[55:17] there's a fresh thought I just want to
[55:19] bring out a little more of a thought I
[55:20] had this morning and as I read this I
[55:22] started crying at my computer I just put
[55:24] my hands in my my face in my hands
[55:27] rather started crying just about how the
[55:30] Bible says we will be judged by what we
[55:33] knew in church the reason I'm starting
[55:36] crying because we know so much we have
[55:39] to make sure we're faithful with what
[55:41] God has made known to us praise God we
[55:45] will be judged by what we know and what
[55:48] we did with what we know and here's the
[55:52] scripture that was kind of tugging on my
[55:55] heart this morning and that servant
[55:57] which knew his Lord's will now we know
[56:00] all
[56:01] about the rapture and the Bible said she
[56:05] hath made herself ready praise God but
[56:10] see the though that those that knew his
[56:12] will and didn't prepare themselves for
[56:14] the rapture neither did according to his
[56:16] Will shall be beaten with many stripes
[56:20] but he that knew not and did things
[56:24] worthy of stripes shall be beaten with
[56:27] few stripes for whom sever much is given
[56:32] of him shall be the much required to
[56:36] whom men have committed much of him they
[56:39] will ask the more what uh what a
[56:42] striking thought and this thought kind
[56:45] of came to me how notice there's some
[56:47] that know God's will and their son that
[56:50] don't know God's will now don't don't
[56:53] let that stumble you because the reason
[56:58] they knew God's will was because of
[57:01] God's desire and I believe this the
[57:04] reason they knew God's will or didn't
[57:06] know God's will because because of their
[57:08] desire because Jesus said you have not
[57:10] because you ask not amen praise God see
[57:16] you and I will have no excuses because
[57:19] Paul said he's made known unto us the
[57:23] mystery of his will God's will for our
[57:26] lives is no mystery the mystery has been
[57:29] revealed amen his will is his word from
[57:33] him tells us amen
[57:34] so all these doctrines all these
[57:36] prophecies all these teachings that God
[57:38] has made known to us it's the will of
[57:40] God amen they known to us we know his
[57:43] will we won't be able to stand there and
[57:45] say we didn't know the will of God we
[57:47] know the will of God now your individual
[57:50] walk with God is determined by how meet
[57:53] you can be did you hear me
[57:57] your individual will God's individual
[58:00] will for your life is determined with
[58:02] how much you can humble yourself go to
[58:05] Psalm 25 I'll prove that by the word
[58:08] this was a fresh thought I was reading a
[58:10] book by a Charles Swindell this week
[58:12] I've been
[58:14] it's kind of different I've just been
[58:15] led to start at the back and work my way
[58:17] forward because I wanted it's called the
[58:19] mystery of God's will and I just found
[58:21] some good scriptures in there so Psalms
[58:23] 25 and I found a good scripture about
[58:29] doing God's will and it's only to be
[58:31] done by humbling ourselves Oh glory
[58:39] now I'm gonna skip around here so bear
[58:43] with me if you would go to oma there's
[58:52] just so many good ok let's go to verse 5
[58:54] so I'm twenty five five well let's go to
[58:58] verse four I didn't wasn't planning on
[58:59] preaching this it show me thy ways o
[59:01] Lord teach me thy past so see God wants
[59:03] you to ask to know his will show it to
[59:06] me Lord we got to come to church show me
[59:09] your will and I'll do it
[59:10] verse five lead me in thy truth and
[59:14] teach me for thou art the god of my
[59:17] salvation on the dua way of the day so
[59:22] see David saying I'm waiting for you to
[59:24] fulfill your word I wait for you to
[59:27] reveal your will for my life
[59:29] now he says remember O Lord my tender
[59:32] mercies than thy loving-kindness for
[59:33] they have been been ever of old I'm
[59:38] gonna skip down to nine now here's where
[59:40] I was saying if you really want to know
[59:41] you're in God's perfect will for your
[59:43] life you we have to humble ourselves
[59:45] because look at verse nine the meek will
[59:48] he guide in judgment not the proud
[59:50] because the proud will won't wait on God
[59:52] long enough they'll try to jump through
[59:55] their own conclusions and run up to
[59:56] riches or or sensuality or cares of the
[59:59] world or they'll shrink away and in fear
[1:00:02] and doubt and unbelief but he said the
[1:00:05] meek will he guide in judgment and the
[1:00:08] meek will he teach his way and head
[1:00:10] glory amen all the paths of the Lord are
[1:00:15] mercy and truth under such as keep his
[1:00:17] covenant and his testimonies look good
[1:00:20] let's go to verse 12 what man is he that
[1:00:22] feareth the Lord him shall he teach in
[1:00:24] the way that he shall choose
[1:00:27] seize the man who fears God he's taught
[1:00:30] God's Way now go down uh verse 13 his
[1:00:35] sole sword well at ease and his seed
[1:00:37] shall inherit the earth the secret of
[1:00:41] the Lord is with them that fear Him amen
[1:00:44] look up here church the mystery of his
[1:00:47] will you want to know the mystery of
[1:00:49] God's will the Bible said the secret
[1:00:51] Lord is with them that fear God and He
[1:00:54] will show them his covenant praise God
[1:00:58] now if you just remember I'm gonna turn
[1:01:02] to Matthew 11 the Bible says he shows it
[1:01:06] to the meek and look at Matthew 11 come
[1:01:09] unto you me verse 28 all either labor
[1:01:11] and heavy laden I will give you rest
[1:01:12] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:01:15] for I am meek and lowly in heart a man
[1:01:19] if you want to know God's will if you
[1:01:22] want to know what you're supposed to do
[1:01:23] for God you must become meek because the
[1:01:26] one who's going to teach you is meek
[1:01:29] doesn't brother man say that's why we
[1:01:31] love God so much because he's so great
[1:01:33] he humbled himself praise God if we want
[1:01:41] to know that we're doing God's will we
[1:01:43] would know the mystery of God's will the
[1:01:45] full Ministry of God's will for our life
[1:01:46] we must humble ourselves and fear God
[1:01:50] humble ourselves and come before the
[1:01:52] meek one and then he said then you'll
[1:01:57] find rest for your souls there's that
[1:01:59] peace David was talking about for a soul
[1:02:01] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:02:05] light are you thankful for a light
[1:02:07] burden on this earth there's a whole lot
[1:02:09] other burdens you could bear that would
[1:02:10] be a lot heavier praise God but he give
[1:02:13] us a light burden amen thank God now
[1:02:17] notice revelation 20 says the dead were
[1:02:23] judged out of those things that were
[1:02:24] written the books according to their
[1:02:26] works and then he says it again in verse
[1:02:28] 13 they were judged every man according
[1:02:30] to their works so God is watching the
[1:02:33] works that we do once once God gives
[1:02:37] someone information or it's a revelation
[1:02:39] in this case then he
[1:02:40] watching what you do with the revelation
[1:02:43] because you can have all the mysteries
[1:02:45] and not yet have charity and they profit
[1:02:49] you nothing unless you have charity
[1:02:51] praise God because Peter said this he
[1:02:56] opened his mouth in Cornelius house and
[1:02:58] I said God is no respecter of persons
[1:03:01] God doesn't love Americans more than he
[1:03:04] loves Asians God doesn't love Americans
[1:03:07] more than he loves Africans Amen right
[1:03:10] or Europeans or whenever God is not a
[1:03:13] respecter of persons amen but in every
[1:03:18] nation he that feareth him and worketh
[1:03:20] righteousness is accepted with him amen
[1:03:23] not just some nations but every nation
[1:03:26] praise God
[1:03:27] and look what gee member Jesus in our
[1:03:29] memory verse he said blessed are they
[1:03:31] which do hunger and thirst for
[1:03:32] righteousness for they might be filled
[1:03:35] no they shall be filled so Jesus
[1:03:39] promises in any nation if anyone hungers
[1:03:42] and thirsts after the true God they
[1:03:45] shall be filled
[1:03:47] amen so see were judged by what we know
[1:03:53] and then God promises now look at this
[1:03:57] this is in the days of King ASA but ASA
[1:04:01] trusted in God or man one time and
[1:04:04] though he got he didn't rely upon the
[1:04:06] Lord so he got chasing because God said
[1:04:08] remember when you did rely upon the Lord
[1:04:10] and he delivered them the the Ethiopians
[1:04:12] in your hands look what he says for the
[1:04:14] eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[1:04:16] throughout the whole earth to show
[1:04:18] himself strong in the behalf of those
[1:04:21] whose heart is perfect toward him Amen
[1:04:25] God is searching all the earth saying is
[1:04:28] there anybody that wants to know me is
[1:04:32] there anybody that wants to do
[1:04:33] righteousness God that I am searching
[1:04:35] the earth for anyone to be a witness
[1:04:38] anyone who's hungry and thirsty I'll
[1:04:40] lead them out guide them if they can
[1:04:42] just humble themselves that the Bible
[1:04:47] says he searches the whole earth Peter
[1:04:49] said every nation anyone who fears God
[1:04:52] will be accepted of him
[1:04:56] so see let's go back to that parable
[1:04:58] Luke 12 there's some servants that knew
[1:05:01] God's will because they wanted to know
[1:05:03] it and some of them were born into it
[1:05:06] like if you're born the message you just
[1:05:08] had you're born into it but we were I
[1:05:11] wasn't born in it but God knew I would
[1:05:15] want it praise God
[1:05:16] so he made away he knew I would hunger
[1:05:19] and thirst for righteousness so he made
[1:05:21] a way that I could be philony how did he
[1:05:24] Leah because he his eyes were going
[1:05:26] around the whole live is there anyone
[1:05:28] that fears me is anyone that loves me is
[1:05:30] there anyone and of course he knew who
[1:05:32] was he was searching about and he
[1:05:34] predestinated that they would receive
[1:05:35] his word
[1:05:38] Lucas Psalms 96 13 says the same thing
[1:05:40] before the Lord for he cometh for that
[1:05:43] he come to judge the earth he shall
[1:05:45] judge the world with righteousness and
[1:05:48] the people with his truth every nation
[1:05:51] knows truth because he appointed a day
[1:05:55] in which he will judge the world in
[1:05:57] righteousness by that man whom he hath
[1:06:01] ordained who is that man Paul tells us
[1:06:03] that man he said God so judge the
[1:06:05] secrets of men by the man Jesus Christ
[1:06:08] according to my gospel praise God amen
[1:06:12] every nation is going to be judged by
[1:06:15] Jesus Christ because he is the truth
[1:06:18] amen
[1:06:19] and God was searching God will be able
[1:06:22] to say I searched though every nation
[1:06:24] I searched Australia the Aborigines I
[1:06:26] searched the deep jungles of Africa
[1:06:29] I saw the jungles of South America I
[1:06:31] searched all those tribes looking for
[1:06:34] someone who was hungry for righteousness
[1:06:36] amen that's what the Word of God says
[1:06:38] and they're judged by what they knew now
[1:06:44] remember the Bible says I'm going to
[1:06:46] skip down to verse
[1:06:47] yeah there's no respect to persons all
[1:06:49] have sinned verse 14 for when the
[1:06:53] Gentiles which had not the law see so
[1:06:55] ever talk about these Aborigines or
[1:06:57] people that never heard of God when they
[1:06:58] do by nature that things contain the law
[1:07:01] these having not the law are a law unto
[1:07:04] themselves
[1:07:05] which show the work of the
[1:07:08] all written in their hearts amen
[1:07:10] hallelujah Church that means the ten
[1:07:12] commandments are written in every
[1:07:14] human's heart amen
[1:07:17] it says right there they don't have a
[1:07:19] law but there are lots of themselves
[1:07:21] because the law is written in their
[1:07:24] hearts amen hallelujah show me any
[1:07:28] civilization where murder and rape is
[1:07:30] okay it's not you know it's not and see
[1:07:36] God wrote in their hearts and their
[1:07:39] conscience also bears witness with it
[1:07:43] and that's and that's where Paul gets to
[1:07:46] this scripture he's gonna judge
[1:07:47] everybody by Jesus Christ because Jesus
[1:07:49] Christ is the truth and the truth is the
[1:07:51] law and that law was written in their
[1:07:54] hearts amen was it the Mayans that did
[1:08:00] all those human sacrifices I believe in
[1:08:02] South America was that the Mayans I
[1:08:04] believe it was doing there's another one
[1:08:06] too what was it Aztecs so they had he
[1:08:09] had human sacrifices and they had him
[1:08:11] often and the leaders could just
[1:08:13] sacrifice anybody they want but the
[1:08:15] Bible says here that that wasn't always
[1:08:18] the case
[1:08:19] there was at some point in that Aztec
[1:08:22] civilization they knew it was wrong but
[1:08:26] if they keep running and keep going past
[1:08:28] it and don't want to believe the truth
[1:08:29] then the Bible said God will give them
[1:08:31] over to a lie but the law of God was
[1:08:37] written in their hearts and not to
[1:08:39] answer on the day of judgment because
[1:08:41] God put a conscience in every man he's a
[1:08:43] minor God he minor creator he's a minor
[1:08:46] influencer amen and we either use that
[1:08:49] influence influence for God's glory or
[1:08:51] for human selfishness or gain because
[1:08:55] remember the Bible said the wrath of God
[1:08:56] is revealed from heaven against all
[1:08:58] ungodliness and unrighteousness who hold
[1:09:00] the truth in unrighteousness because
[1:09:02] that which may be known of God is
[1:09:04] manifest in them
[1:09:05] God has two witnesses against all man if
[1:09:10] they won't serve Him the first one is in
[1:09:13] him for God has showed it unto them so a
[1:09:16] human looks at themselves and were
[1:09:18] judged by what we know but everybody
[1:09:20] knows there has
[1:09:21] God because every person can see the
[1:09:24] creative powers of God working in their
[1:09:26] body when was the last time you told
[1:09:29] your heart make sure you pump today
[1:09:30] don't forget it
[1:09:31] I need that oxygen oxygenated blood when
[1:09:34] was last time you told your heart to do
[1:09:35] that you didn't it just does it well his
[1:09:40] last time you told your eyes and all the
[1:09:42] muscles in there to catch the light and
[1:09:44] make sure they could arrange it and
[1:09:46] understand the right way you did it it
[1:09:49] was all autonomous right it was already
[1:09:51] built in and so see God has built-in to
[1:09:54] everybody a manifestation of his glory
[1:09:56] and a manifestation of his presence and
[1:09:59] there's no man who's without excuse
[1:10:02] praise God because the Bible says they
[1:10:04] are without excuse the second one so God
[1:10:08] first he puts himself in every puts a
[1:10:10] creative power in every human and then
[1:10:13] second he is seen by what is clearly
[1:10:16] seen in the creation so a man can't look
[1:10:19] at the Setting Sun a man can't look at a
[1:10:22] waterfall a man can't look at the Stars
[1:10:25] and the planets and the rotation and
[1:10:28] eclipses man cannot look at that and not
[1:10:31] confess there's a God they may limit lie
[1:10:34] about it later on down the road but at
[1:10:36] some point when they look up and they
[1:10:38] see the Sun and they can't look anymore
[1:10:39] they know it's God's creation I'm not
[1:10:43] being judged by what they know at church
[1:10:46] so Louise we got to be careful that's
[1:10:48] God to help us to live what we know so I
[1:10:52] want to just lay that foundation that
[1:10:54] was a fresh thought to me because some
[1:10:56] of them don't know the commands of God
[1:10:57] and it's because they don't ask for it
[1:11:01] because the Bible said ask and you shall
[1:11:04] receive and God puts that hunger program
[1:11:09] called the holy thirst God puts that
[1:11:11] holy thirst in every soul to win a
[1:11:13] thirst and know God and know the truth
[1:11:14] and no righteousness does this help pray
[1:11:16] this is help church every soul thirst to
[1:11:20] know righteous what is true what is
[1:11:21] righteous they know there are some God
[1:11:23] out there and they either stay either
[1:11:26] hush that holy thirst or they they they
[1:11:29] keep crying out and they try to bring
[1:11:31] satisfaction to that holy thirst and if
[1:11:34] they
[1:11:35] they'll find Jesus Christ aren't you
[1:11:37] glad you found him amen
[1:11:38] yeah so good I found him and he found me
[1:11:42] praise the Lord now I want to continue
[1:11:46] on this I just thought I would lay that
[1:11:47] groundwork there because it was
[1:11:49] important to me to say some of those
[1:11:50] things so we we started that on
[1:11:59] Wednesday there's I have at least seven
[1:12:01] I could probably do a lot more
[1:12:03] I just didn't write them all down
[1:12:04] there's at least seven wrong things that
[1:12:07] the Jeffersonville movement is saying
[1:12:08] the first one I think is the most evil
[1:12:11] is not every word brother Adam said is
[1:12:14] thus saith the Lord here's the exact
[1:12:17] quote the the leader says Amen I believe
[1:12:20] everything but Aram says is thus saith
[1:12:22] the Lord I believe everything the
[1:12:23] Prophet says that is the truth of God to
[1:12:25] mean you whether we want to accept it or
[1:12:27] not look at the pressure that puts on
[1:12:29] people
[1:12:29] well you better accept it or not or
[1:12:31] you're going to be lost if you don't
[1:12:33] make every word they'll say the Lord
[1:12:34] then you're not you're not even saved
[1:12:35] look at the pressure behind that that's
[1:12:38] not right okay I'm gonna skip I did have
[1:12:42] the recording there but yeah for some
[1:12:44] reason I don't have I don't have a good
[1:12:45] understanding of how to do the audio now
[1:12:49] let me just review these real quick
[1:12:50] there's a give at least 18 statements
[1:12:53] that prove he's fallible he's a man I
[1:12:55] want to go over them quickly because
[1:12:56] you'll run across them you've probably
[1:12:58] run across them as you listen to the
[1:12:59] tapes so these two cannot be thus saith
[1:13:03] the Lord because God does not lie so
[1:13:06] here's what I was mentioning but Memphis
[1:13:09] that I make thousands of mistakes in
[1:13:11] each month in each year surely I do but
[1:13:14] when I see I'm wrong I say God I didn't
[1:13:16] mean to do it you know my heart I didn't
[1:13:18] mean to do that I was trapped for that I
[1:13:19] didn't mean to do it you forgive me Lord
[1:13:21] now let's say thousands let's just say
[1:13:23] as he says thousands rights that's more
[1:13:25] than 1,000 let's just say 2,000 you used
[1:13:30] to send 2,000 times in one year how many
[1:13:33] times is that well 2,000 one year
[1:13:35] divided by each day is about five six
[1:13:38] sins a year or six ends a day
[1:13:41] now how many evil thoughts do you have
[1:13:43] per day now how about the
[1:13:46] does literally like birds flying over
[1:13:48] and you shoo them away I'm know about
[1:13:49] the ones you actually entertain so see
[1:13:53] this is why I can look at brotherman and
[1:13:55] I can respect him because he was honest
[1:13:56] he might have forgot a lot of things he
[1:13:59] might exaggerate it but I can respect
[1:14:02] him because that's the reality
[1:14:03] some days I probably more evil thoughts
[1:14:04] than that right
[1:14:06] I thought thousands I said on Wednesday
[1:14:11] I think occasion Lydia when tried to
[1:14:12] figure out that number how many were
[1:14:14] sins would that be in a day five evil
[1:14:18] thoughts that you entertain Oh me back
[1:14:20] it you know yeah then you gotta cast it
[1:14:21] out Oh forgive me Lord I didn't mean to
[1:14:23] think that oh this person so evil I'll
[1:14:25] just get back at them Oh God forgive me
[1:14:27] I didn't mean to do that
[1:14:28] I didn't mean to think that help me Lord
[1:14:29] Jesus but see in each mistake in each
[1:14:34] word that he would say maybe that would
[1:14:36] be wrong and what that wasn't thus saith
[1:14:39] the Lord because the Lord does not lie
[1:14:43] now I've read the a few of these quickly
[1:14:46] on Wednesday as I close but I want to
[1:14:48] show you the whole quotes is that okay I
[1:14:49] want to show you the whole quotes I
[1:14:51] think it'll help you to understand this
[1:14:55] so there's four predictions that cannot
[1:14:59] be thus say at the Lord and here they
[1:15:02] are 1977 death by gunshot Martin Luther
[1:15:06] King jr. Movement and Billy Paul was the
[1:15:09] promise Joseph so let's go through the
[1:15:11] quotes you can see it now Bertram says
[1:15:13] two things left are those seven great
[1:15:16] prophecies that is for cars to be on the
[1:15:18] road with remote control looking like a
[1:15:19] egg only you won't drive it it controls
[1:15:21] itself and then there will be a great
[1:15:23] woman rise up because America is a
[1:15:25] woman's nation it'll be great women rise
[1:15:27] up be President or something like that
[1:15:29] in the nation and then there will come a
[1:15:30] total annihilation that entire nation
[1:15:33] will be wiped out
[1:15:35] and I predict now this is not the Lord
[1:15:37] saying this now I don't know how that
[1:15:40] the family members of our own can say
[1:15:42] everywhere does thus saith the Lord when
[1:15:44] he says this is not the Lord I believe
[1:15:49] everywhere does us a look well then what
[1:15:51] you don't believe him
[1:15:52] he's saying it's not the Lord that shows
[1:15:57] us a spirit it's an evil spirit
[1:16:00] because if the man is humble if brother
[1:16:03] has humble enough to say this is not the
[1:16:05] Lord this is me if he's humble enough to
[1:16:07] say that and you won't admit it
[1:16:08] something's wrong with your mother
[1:16:10] you've got an evil spirit on you he's
[1:16:12] remember an evil spirit well not you
[1:16:14] trying to reason with it you try to show
[1:16:16] it truth it will not accept it because
[1:16:18] it's hanging on to something else and I
[1:16:20] think it's the love of money because
[1:16:23] it's either women love of money or
[1:16:24] popularity what could be popularity too
[1:16:26] but I think behind all that is either
[1:16:28] popularity or money because the love of
[1:16:32] money is the root of all evil why would
[1:16:35] this family why would the family members
[1:16:37] say every word is done because it puts a
[1:16:39] binding on them they've got to stay with
[1:16:41] the tapes and they got they gotta stay
[1:16:43] with the family members it binds them
[1:16:47] doesn't it
[1:16:53] he says this is not the Lord but I
[1:16:58] predicted in
[1:16:59] 19:33 that the world would meet total
[1:17:01] annihilation before sister Karen lived
[1:17:03] through this she sister Karen saw people
[1:17:07] that knew this quote and they run up
[1:17:09] their credit card bills oh I would have
[1:17:11] to pay it because it's gonna happen
[1:17:13] before 77 I remember you and Loras told
[1:17:16] me that see now that was evil then they
[1:17:19] do that because the real Christian
[1:17:21] doesn't want to steal money a real
[1:17:24] Christian wants to pay their dues off or
[1:17:26] their debts off that shows it was the
[1:17:29] wrong spirit to start with selfishness
[1:17:32] so I didn't know then that that they had
[1:17:35] something that could annihilate it like
[1:17:37] they got now but I seen that nation
[1:17:38] total annihilation
[1:17:39] just stumps of trees and things like
[1:17:41] that left so Graham is saying I only saw
[1:17:44] tree stumps left before 1977 and as I
[1:17:48] said on Wednesday night although the
[1:17:49] jeffersonville people have to do is go
[1:17:51] outside and if they find one tree that's
[1:17:53] not a stone and it's a full grown then
[1:17:55] they have to recognize that what's in
[1:17:56] the state the Lord so look the trees are
[1:18:00] witnessing against them amen ah see God
[1:18:03] God's Word will stand true when God
[1:18:06] speaks something it's going to happen
[1:18:08] you can rest your soul on it praise God
[1:18:10] but as humans we can make our own ideas
[1:18:12] and our predictions and that's okay
[1:18:15] but let's not hang on then let's hang on
[1:18:17] thus saith the Lord because he says this
[1:18:20] is not of the Lord he says it again in
[1:18:24] another way in the church age book and
[1:18:26] here's what stumbles to believe the sign
[1:18:27] people my butt wraps I sincerely believe
[1:18:29] maintain as a privacy of the word along
[1:18:31] with divine inspiration
[1:18:33] see the guy he says it in there 1979 -
[1:18:37] still didn't say they'll say the Lord
[1:18:38] cookie says I predict I do not prophesy
[1:18:40] that they'll all come to pass by night
[1:18:43] by 1977 and so he slides this divine
[1:18:47] inspiration because Marvin was inspired
[1:18:49] he was inspired when he saw the visions
[1:18:52] and he had made he made two calculations
[1:18:54] I'm gonna show you in just a moment he
[1:18:56] made two calculations that he thought
[1:18:58] lined up perfectly with 1977 now did he
[1:19:01] have divine inspiration on some of these
[1:19:03] things yes on some of them but not all
[1:19:05] of them but he didn't save us saith the
[1:19:08] Lord he just said I feel I'm inspired at
[1:19:11] church how many times have you and I
[1:19:12] said
[1:19:12] God's leading us to do something and
[1:19:14] that maybe wasn't God how many times
[1:19:16] have we had dreams and the Lord showed
[1:19:18] me this the Lord showed me that and it
[1:19:20] turned out not to be the Lord see any
[1:19:23] honest person could admit we do the same
[1:19:25] thing because we're just trying to be
[1:19:28] spiritual church we're just trying to
[1:19:29] figure out God's will we got to sweat it
[1:19:31] out and what am I supposed to do Lord
[1:19:33] and and so and what is it it's all
[1:19:35] testing us God's putting us through the
[1:19:37] fire to test us to make our faith more
[1:19:39] sure because when all these 1977 people
[1:19:44] fell away what it thin down the crowd it
[1:19:47] kept the pyramid going more narrow and
[1:19:50] more narrow thinning it out thinning it
[1:19:52] out thinning it out until whoever's left
[1:19:54] is gonna be the real bride of Jesus
[1:19:56] Christ because Christ is gonna sit
[1:19:58] himself right on top of that church amen
[1:20:00] I think that's gonna be a very small
[1:20:03] group and their ministry is going to
[1:20:05] match the Ministry of Christ the word
[1:20:07] perfectly because their hearts are going
[1:20:10] to be turned back to the Apostolic
[1:20:12] fathers the Word of God hey man see they
[1:20:15] love money they love vacations they
[1:20:18] loved all that mourn they loved Christ
[1:20:19] to begin with looking for an easy way
[1:20:22] out sorry God brings all his saints
[1:20:26] along the same way praise God the
[1:20:28] hardship of fires fiery
[1:20:31] tests and trials of our faith amen more
[1:20:33] precious than gold
[1:20:36] well that burns them up that believe the
[1:20:39] signs of divine inspiration it ought to
[1:20:42] terminate now we still have the world
[1:20:44] systems right I still got to go get my
[1:20:47] Social Security card for the babies yeah
[1:20:49] I still gotta get I still gotta pay
[1:20:51] taxes yeah they're they're still here so
[1:20:55] how is this thus saith the LORD it's not
[1:21:00] but you know better because you don't
[1:21:02] worship brother Brandon nor even either
[1:21:06] do I
[1:21:06] amen now what's the cause of this 1977
[1:21:10] air it's his personal opinion and yet
[1:21:12] this does not disqualify him from being
[1:21:14] a prophet because this prediction was
[1:21:16] not spoken in the name of the Lord now
[1:21:20] look as a student of the word brother
[1:21:22] Ram was looking at dates and numbers
[1:21:23] when he made the 1977 predict
[1:21:26] miscalculated these and he tells you
[1:21:28] this he tells you this in Daniel 70
[1:21:31] weeks 1961
[1:21:32] here's his to miscalculations he thought
[1:21:35] the Gentiles would only get 1954 years
[1:21:38] to hear the gospel because that's how
[1:21:41] long Moses got before Christ King
[1:21:43] so Moses gave the law about 1954 years
[1:21:48] before Christ
[1:21:49] so Graham saw that in the in the the the
[1:21:52] genealogy the lineage and Oh if the Jews
[1:21:55] got 1954 years then that's what the
[1:21:58] Gentiles will get so see he was just
[1:22:01] trying to be spiritual just like you
[1:22:04] tried to figure out when the rapture is
[1:22:06] just like me trying to figure out when
[1:22:09] will the church's unite with the
[1:22:10] president when will they all try to
[1:22:13] figure it out
[1:22:14] mercy 2nd 1977 was actually the 70th
[1:22:20] jubilee 70 times 70 so he found that in
[1:22:26] the genie out at the numbers so he saw
[1:22:28] these two witnesses he's the one
[1:22:30] divinely inspired I'm not gonna prophesy
[1:22:32] see the Holy Spirit kept him from doing
[1:22:34] that David raised God because he had two
[1:22:39] witnesses he thought oh this will like
[1:22:41] this would be perfect and you should
[1:22:44] hear him if you haven't listened to that
[1:22:45] Daniel seven weeks ago listen to that
[1:22:46] writer and he ends the sermon in the
[1:22:48] last hour talking about 1977 go listen
[1:22:51] that he's so convinced because he saw
[1:22:55] these two numbers line up he thought oh
[1:22:57] it's got to happen before 77 you say
[1:23:02] where's that in the Bible well yeah
[1:23:03] that's definitely the Bible John 21 the
[1:23:07] Bible said a saying or prediction went
[1:23:09] out that John would not die because he'd
[1:23:15] see the Lord's second coming John died
[1:23:19] and Jesus had still not returned see
[1:23:23] they had a prediction and it was
[1:23:24] time-stamped to the end of John's life
[1:23:27] just like the 1977 prediction was
[1:23:31] time-stamped see but Jose Christians are
[1:23:35] always trying to get a little insight on
[1:23:36] when is the rapture going to take place
[1:23:39] oh it's been going all the time amen if
[1:23:42] you and I would have been live at that
[1:23:44] time for the Amen we would have camped
[1:23:45] right around John's Church because oh I
[1:23:48] heard him say Jesus said you know I'm
[1:23:52] not tested taste death till he sees me
[1:23:54] coming in his kingdom
[1:23:55] oh you know it church you would have
[1:23:58] done the same thing because what we
[1:24:02] don't want to miss it we want to be
[1:24:04] ready
[1:24:05] we're sincere so we would have moved
[1:24:08] from church well we would have followed
[1:24:10] John if he would have went to Ephesus or
[1:24:11] Patmos hurry we would have found him
[1:24:14] around the whole time because we thought
[1:24:16] we heard we thought we knew that John
[1:24:19] was going to see the Lord's coming so I
[1:24:21] want to be where John is so the same
[1:24:26] thing repeats in our day where BAM
[1:24:28] thinks he sees it he gives out a date
[1:24:29] and so everybody just wants to maybe say
[1:24:32] hey I want to be ready for that day I'll
[1:24:34] do everything I can to be ready for that
[1:24:35] day but then the prediction comes and
[1:24:38] goes and God's people are left wondering
[1:24:40] scratching their heads the whole time as
[1:24:42] gods like you should have just stayed
[1:24:43] with us say at the Lord it's a good test
[1:24:46] for you you're learning to trust me
[1:24:49] don't trust in men don't make your own
[1:24:51] ideas it's okay to try to to try to
[1:24:53] predict and things like that but you
[1:24:55] only hang yourself on thus sayeth the
[1:24:57] Lord amen
[1:24:59] Andy how many times you better have to
[1:25:01] have to say how many times the brother I
[1:25:02] have to say that it's not me it's not
[1:25:04] I'm sorry's not gonna say the Lord it's
[1:25:05] just me it's not it's not the Lord I'm
[1:25:07] just predicting how many times has he
[1:25:09] got to say that to people catch it but
[1:25:11] would it be hard absolutely absolutely
[1:25:15] here's this here's the second one
[1:25:19] this is insulted our person now which is
[1:25:21] a very challenging sermon can I just say
[1:25:26] like that because at the end sister
[1:25:27] Karen this is the Brendan knows at the
[1:25:29] end brother branham still thinks time
[1:25:31] might be over for people to be saved if
[1:25:33] you listen to the breech brother that
[1:25:36] makes it sound like this is a March of
[1:25:37] 63 right before the seals he makes it
[1:25:39] sound like when Jesus looses the seals
[1:25:41] there's no more redemption because he's
[1:25:43] taking the book everyone's still not
[1:25:46] sure
[1:25:48] mercy goodness eight months later
[1:25:52] but I'm still not sure he said mercy
[1:25:54] might be over and you can hear him cry
[1:25:56] out he cries out for the salvation of
[1:25:58] Joseph and Sarah and Rebecca and he's
[1:26:01] like crying and you can hear the people
[1:26:03] the barren tabernacle crying oh God
[1:26:05] mercy but then thinks time still but
[1:26:08] then thinks time might be over and we
[1:26:10] might be in the third pole which is
[1:26:11] preaching to the eternal lost this into
[1:26:15] a church if you haven't done that so he
[1:26:17] tells this dream this is challenging
[1:26:20] sermon because brother Brad was growing
[1:26:22] and understanding now does he fix it he
[1:26:24] fixes it in the next year in August of
[1:26:26] 64 nasan brother Graham is time and over
[1:26:29] and he said no he said he said it could
[1:26:31] have been my fault he said no he said
[1:26:33] don't never think that don't you ever
[1:26:35] get that in your mind was just a year
[1:26:37] ago you told us it might be over
[1:26:38] are you a checked a year ago forever
[1:26:46] you're making a sound like because he
[1:26:48] was just look he was open for more
[1:26:49] revelation so he says some sister he
[1:26:56] said look he's saying all keeps dripping
[1:26:58] with blood he's singing that song it's
[1:26:59] dripping with blood it's this Holy Ghost
[1:27:02] gospel it's dripping with blood time all
[1:27:04] the martyrs he said yes they keep
[1:27:06] dripping with blood yes sir it'll do it
[1:27:08] someday but I'm late I'm waiting that
[1:27:11] hour when it's finished some sister had
[1:27:15] a dream she said to me and said I seen
[1:27:17] them that church fixed away is going to
[1:27:20] kill me secretly sometime when I'm
[1:27:24] getting out of my car going in be fired
[1:27:26] on but said then the spirit said not at
[1:27:29] this time but it will come later
[1:27:32] look brother I'm never disagreed with
[1:27:35] this he said uh-huh listen to it he
[1:27:39] agrees with the dream it says Oh huh the
[1:27:42] boat rammed I have a gun shot secretly
[1:27:43] no he died of a car accident but I
[1:27:47] thought the spirit said it wasn't the
[1:27:50] Holy Spirit it was a dream where the
[1:27:53] sister thought it was the Holy Spirit
[1:27:54] but it wasn't the Holy Spirit but
[1:27:57] brother I'm never cruxit on the tape and
[1:27:58] on the tape it makes it sound like
[1:27:59] uh-huh uh-huh the spirit said later
[1:28:03] uh-huh
[1:28:05] is that the state the Lord no no it's
[1:28:10] just like oh I felt letting the Holy
[1:28:11] Spirit to do this and you find out you
[1:28:13] weren't letting the Holy Spirit to do
[1:28:14] that
[1:28:14] it wasn't the Spirit of God leading you
[1:28:17] not all dreams are from God dreams are
[1:28:19] like the male some of you get good mail
[1:28:21] somebody get junk mail somebody get some
[1:28:24] junky dreams I get him to I don't like
[1:28:28] him
[1:28:30] but see this dream was not thus saith
[1:28:33] the Lord
[1:28:34] but if you say about everywhere program
[1:28:36] says thus saith Lord well then he must
[1:28:37] have died from a gunshot wound and not a
[1:28:38] car accident there's some conspiracy
[1:28:40] spirit theory here we better go back to
[1:28:41] a Texas and figure out what happened
[1:28:44] there it's time to open that
[1:28:45] investigation back up right because
[1:28:49] everything every words that saith the
[1:28:50] Lord it's gonna come later uh-huh god
[1:28:55] forbid I compromise on anything I know
[1:28:57] nothing but Jesus Christ him crucified
[1:28:59] we're living a horrible day sinners has
[1:29:02] did this yep there they stone Stephen
[1:29:03] they cut they had John's head cut off
[1:29:05] she did I don't know what we'll give
[1:29:07] ours but it'll be something look he says
[1:29:09] I don't know he just says the spirit and
[1:29:11] he says huh huh but he says I don't know
[1:29:15] but it'll be some day no it'll be all
[1:29:19] right notice now Church the same thing I
[1:29:26] don't have the quotes today but I'll
[1:29:27] show you this those are the same words
[1:29:29] he said maybe where'd he say yeah I
[1:29:32] don't know those are the same words he
[1:29:34] says when he said the Holy Spirit told
[1:29:36] him Joseph was a prophet he said he said
[1:29:38] it's my prayer at least or he said I
[1:29:41] hope he's a prophet brother Graham says
[1:29:44] the Holy Spirit struck him when he was
[1:29:46] dedicating to son Joseph and said Joseph
[1:29:48] my son you're a prophet I wrote a says I
[1:29:51] hope so at least that's my prayer I hope
[1:29:54] the same thing see we attribute things
[1:29:59] to the Holy Spirit which arch how do you
[1:30:02] know by their fruits you shall know it
[1:30:05] it will come to pass
[1:30:08] if it's thus saith the Lord it'll come
[1:30:11] to pass and that's why those return
[1:30:12] ministry people are still hanging on for
[1:30:14] buh-bam to rise from the dead because
[1:30:15] they know some of these things haven't
[1:30:17] come to pass but they believe they are
[1:30:19] listen Church the thus saith the Lord
[1:30:21] are going to come to pass but there's
[1:30:23] going to be no return ministry above the
[1:30:25] rim the ministry is in the bride the
[1:30:29] Living bride whose only ass right now
[1:30:31] praise God that's the only living
[1:30:33] ministry is the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:35] because the spirit and the bride say
[1:30:37] come
[1:30:38] amen that's how it is I don't know how
[1:30:47] we'll give ours well you just got a
[1:30:48] dream where the spirit said you to go
[1:30:50] die by gunshot he says I don't know but
[1:30:53] it sounds like uh-huh sounds like uh huh
[1:30:56] see so not every word is thus saith the
[1:30:58] Lord so the cause of this air well it's
[1:31:02] perhaps of both a personal opinion and
[1:31:04] honest mistake every man and woman
[1:31:05] probably holds dreams or ideas about the
[1:31:07] future they think it are from the Lord's
[1:31:10] Holy Spirit when in reality they're not
[1:31:11] it could have been an honest mistake in
[1:31:13] which program did not pray enough about
[1:31:15] the sisters dream before publicly
[1:31:16] repeating it and we've all done that yet
[1:31:21] this is not disqualified from being a
[1:31:22] prophet because it was not shared with
[1:31:24] us saith the Lord so perhaps also now
[1:31:29] here's a Bible example David was
[1:31:32] convinced Saul was gonna kill him
[1:31:34] someday so he left Israel and escaped to
[1:31:39] the Philistine land did you know he said
[1:31:42] that the Bible records that saw never
[1:31:48] saw David's life after he saw how David
[1:31:52] had mercy on him and could have killed
[1:31:53] him and just cut off the little clothes
[1:31:56] from his skirt they called it a skirt
[1:31:58] into long robes the Bible said Saul said
[1:32:01] oh you valued my life my soul has been
[1:32:03] precious he said I'll net all no longer
[1:32:05] go after David but Dave was convinced
[1:32:06] he's going to kill me he's going to kill
[1:32:08] me he's gonna kill me same thing here
[1:32:10] but Rama thought I might die by gunshot
[1:32:12] might die by gunshot what was in the
[1:32:15] case
[1:32:17] praise God David was convinced he was so
[1:32:20] convinced whether Amen he left the
[1:32:22] country
[1:32:23] now that's convinced that's convinced
[1:32:27] and concerned sister Wendy you're so
[1:32:31] convinced you lead the nation and you go
[1:32:34] to your sworn enemy because you're so
[1:32:38] scared you're gonna die this way but yet
[1:32:41] church you had nothing to worry about
[1:32:42] the whole time but he was so worried I'm
[1:32:44] gonna die I was gonna kill me and he had
[1:32:47] even King yet he forgot about the
[1:32:49] prophecy of the Prophet uh help us not
[1:32:54] to forget about the prophecies for
[1:32:56] Christ's bride in the rapture amen
[1:32:58] let's not forget that and get to scourge
[1:33:00] amen let's be encouraged by the grace of
[1:33:03] God like I had a dream one time where I
[1:33:08] found my dad dead in a rocking chair I
[1:33:10] woke up from that dream and I cursed
[1:33:13] that dream in the name of Jesus so I'm
[1:33:15] not gonna find my dad dead in the
[1:33:17] rocking chair and somebody had a dream
[1:33:19] they called me a few weeks ago said
[1:33:20] brother Jesse I hate to tell you this he
[1:33:21] said I had a dream of you you died in a
[1:33:23] very I'm not gonna give the details
[1:33:25] because my tuner listened but they died
[1:33:27] in this dishonourable way and everything
[1:33:28] like that I said brother I'm gonna curse
[1:33:30] that dream in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:32] I'm not gonna be like David and you know
[1:33:34] he's the wave godly man and I was you
[1:33:37] know better but I'm just saying I want
[1:33:38] to learn from that example I'm not gonna
[1:33:41] run and I'm not gonna live in fear I'm a
[1:33:44] living faith amen
[1:33:45] but if felt what's it take me whatever
[1:33:47] way you want to take me so--but I'll
[1:33:48] trust in God because he's kept me this
[1:33:51] far and he won't let me go and toast my
[1:33:53] time to go praise God
[1:33:54] I curse that because I don't believe
[1:33:58] that he shook me up a little bit was
[1:34:04] last time somebody called you and said I
[1:34:05] had a dream about you dying I sure
[1:34:08] didn't I sure didn't like that but I
[1:34:10] sure got that I sure got the
[1:34:11] understanding I got the assurance that I
[1:34:13] all things will work together for my
[1:34:15] good to them to love the Lord and I
[1:34:17] appreciate something that I honestly do
[1:34:18] I appreciate the person for calling me
[1:34:19] up because they were honest like if I
[1:34:21] had a dream about somebody I wouldn't go
[1:34:23] tell them the dream because it might be
[1:34:24] from God it might be here's the next one
[1:34:29] Martin Luther King jr. this was this was
[1:34:32] a pretty harsh prophecy I'm sorry this
[1:34:34] is a pretty harsh prediction I'm sorry
[1:34:36] friction but that's all about Martin
[1:34:38] Luther King jr. this is in July 63 but
[1:34:40] this man if I can only speak to him
[1:34:42] leading those precious people under the
[1:34:44] name of religion into a death trap where
[1:34:45] he's gonna kill thousands times down of
[1:34:48] them program makes it sound like Martin
[1:34:50] Luther King jr. which we're gonna have a
[1:34:51] holiday for him pretty soon who's gonna
[1:34:54] kill thousands of them by leading them
[1:34:56] into a death trap now look what he says
[1:35:00] next Church I'll tell you this is you
[1:35:02] really need we really need God's grace
[1:35:04] here brace yourself for this quote here
[1:35:07] there the next one one thing I pray
[1:35:10] brother Martin Luther King will
[1:35:12] certainly wake up what good would it be
[1:35:14] if you went to a school a million of you
[1:35:17] laying yonder dead what good just to go
[1:35:20] to school just the same I'm gonna skip
[1:35:22] down just like Hitler did over in
[1:35:25] Germany led them right into a death trap
[1:35:28] so brother Branham is comparing Martin
[1:35:31] Luther King jr. to Hitler they he thinks
[1:35:35] they're both gonna lead people into a
[1:35:37] death trap
[1:35:39] let them write them precious Germans and
[1:35:42] they laid by the means or bins piled up
[1:35:45] on top of one another
[1:35:46] look.we says this is what I was saying
[1:35:48] this is the tough one and that's exactly
[1:35:50] the same thing but BAM says as Hitler
[1:35:53] had millions of Germans killed Martin
[1:35:55] Luther gene Judith ur King jr. was gonna
[1:35:58] lead millions of african-americans to
[1:36:00] death and he says remember I'm on tape
[1:36:08] after maybe after I'm gone that's
[1:36:10] exactly what's going to happen then
[1:36:13] precious people will die down there like
[1:36:15] fly start a revolutionary both white and
[1:36:17] color will fight again so Batman was
[1:36:19] saying a civil war is gonna break out
[1:36:21] white against black in southern America
[1:36:23] and he says listen I'm on tape talk
[1:36:28] about boldness but here's what I'm gonna
[1:36:33] say it now just so you got it he lived
[1:36:35] through two world wars Church brother
[1:36:37] murder bro brother man wasn't you know
[1:36:38] unaware of death
[1:36:40] he saw it in the papers every day can
[1:36:42] you imagine World War one of course he's
[1:36:44] a little boy World War two he saw the
[1:36:45] the millions died he's he's surrounded
[1:36:48] by death surrounded by wars so wouldn't
[1:36:51] be maybe a surprising thing for him to
[1:36:53] say something like this because he was
[1:36:55] surrounded by wars his whole life heroes
[1:37:00] killed on this or do you just announce
[1:37:02] that there would be this happening now I
[1:37:03] see I've always asked you to be careful
[1:37:05] what you're listening to see there's so
[1:37:08] much of it that's just the human side
[1:37:10] but always if there's something that
[1:37:12] goes forth it will speak it how much
[1:37:14] always its thus saith the Lord even
[1:37:20] divisions or anything
[1:37:22] the visions on the platform is so you're
[1:37:24] doing that yourself it isn't God it's
[1:37:26] you
[1:37:26] God doesn't produce that vision you do
[1:37:27] it yourself by your faith and divine
[1:37:29] gift here's what I said on Wednesday I
[1:37:32] about fell over when I listen to this
[1:37:33] quote I was driving some glad I didn't
[1:37:35] fall over said I'm in a very bad
[1:37:37] situation like the woman that touched
[1:37:41] Jesus's garment he didn't know who she
[1:37:44] was or what was wrong with her but she
[1:37:46] did that herself
[1:37:48] now see that wasn't thus sayeth the Lord
[1:37:52] when Jesus said who touched me it was
[1:37:57] thus saith the Lord when Jesus spoke
[1:37:59] back and told her that her faith had
[1:38:01] saved her but see you have to watch so I
[1:38:08] made this statement a few weeks ago we
[1:38:09] all amend it I remember I said every
[1:38:11] word jesus said was thus saith the Lord
[1:38:13] and we all amend it I amended numerous
[1:38:17] times in the sermon but here program
[1:38:19] says when Jesus said who touched me
[1:38:21] that wasn't the Lord because think about
[1:38:24] it the Lord knew know who touched him
[1:38:26] the Lord knew the Holy Spirit knew so
[1:38:32] this is teaching me even quite a bit
[1:38:34] here
[1:38:34] I'm not sure what to say I said on
[1:38:38] Wednesday was every word though jesus
[1:38:41] said pleasing to God yes because he said
[1:38:43] I always do that which pleases the
[1:38:45] father but not every word jesus said was
[1:38:49] a prophecy because remember Jesus flesh
[1:38:52] did not know all things he didn't know
[1:38:55] the day or the hour not even the Angels
[1:38:58] know the day or the hour I mean brother
[1:39:00] Jose let me throw a new one at you yet
[1:39:01] but on your shock vest here but Ranson
[1:39:04] when you get your theophanies it's a
[1:39:05] word body and you know all things well
[1:39:07] is that exactly right
[1:39:08] do you know the day in the hour of the
[1:39:10] rapture once you die I don't know but I
[1:39:12] know this the angels don't know and they
[1:39:14] got the Alpha knees and the church said
[1:39:21] so I don't know I don't think of the AH
[1:39:25] phanie then would know everything
[1:39:26] because then if we know everything what
[1:39:27] do we need Jesus for but man says the
[1:39:29] hidden manna is Jesus answering all of
[1:39:31] our questions throughout all eternity so
[1:39:35] see we got to take every quote back to
[1:39:37] the word praise the Lord hoo-boy quite a
[1:39:47] message this morning that yeah the more
[1:39:50] I listen to this the more Wow
[1:39:52] God is he what is he doing he's refining
[1:39:54] her faith and I'll say like this he's
[1:39:57] teaching us to rely upon the Holy Spirit
[1:40:00] yes we thank God for the tapes we listen
[1:40:02] to the tapes yes we thank God for the
[1:40:04] Papo ministry but listen Church you're
[1:40:05] not gonna get there because of me you
[1:40:07] and I are not gonna get to the rapture
[1:40:09] because of my gift for anything I got
[1:40:10] you're gonna get there because you love
[1:40:12] the Holy Spirit and you want the truth
[1:40:14] from the Holy Spirit amen because
[1:40:16] another man's revelation cannot get you
[1:40:18] there you must have the revelation and
[1:40:20] the greatest revelation you can have is
[1:40:22] that you're bored again amen hallelujah
[1:40:25] that you have the love of God sorry in
[1:40:28] your heart and there's air in your heart
[1:40:30] you can be patient waiting on these the
[1:40:32] state the Lord's and all these
[1:40:33] predictions whether these going to come
[1:40:34] to pass
[1:40:35] I can be patient because charity has
[1:40:37] long-suffering I'm not giving up if if
[1:40:42] Trump doesn't get reelected I'm not
[1:40:44] giving up him if something happens to
[1:40:45] Israel I'm not giving up why cuz I've
[1:40:47] got charity and charity suffereth long
[1:40:51] even though I don't understand every
[1:40:53] word sister Karen even though I don't
[1:40:54] understand every prophecy of prediction
[1:40:55] I can wait upon the Lord because I've
[1:40:57] got charity my soul and the love of God
[1:41:01] in my soul can wait upon the Lord until
[1:41:03] he fulfills his word I'd say that threw
[1:41:08] me for a loop
[1:41:08] that wasn't thus saith the Lord who
[1:41:11] touched me that wasn't thus saith the
[1:41:13] Lord I know so they asked him did you
[1:41:19] prophesy no I was just talking about
[1:41:22] Martin Luther King on this great
[1:41:24] disaster they're having down the South
[1:41:25] now see Church we weren't living in
[1:41:27] those days but there was a lot of riots
[1:41:28] there was people killed
[1:41:30] did you know they shot bullets through
[1:41:32] Martin Luther King Jr's house they threw
[1:41:35] the gasoline pop bottle bombs and
[1:41:38] exploded him right outside of his house
[1:41:40] there's all kinds of violence against
[1:41:43] Blacks so programs read this in the
[1:41:47] newspaper he saw all the world war and
[1:41:49] he seen the vision of America destroyed
[1:41:51] he said I'm on tape just listen it's
[1:41:54] gonna happen he thought he saw the same
[1:41:56] signs down south the racial evils he saw
[1:42:00] the same thing as it was in Germany the
[1:42:02] racial evils and he thought oh it's just
[1:42:04] like that it's gonna be a repeat he said
[1:42:07] listen I'm on tape but they asked him a
[1:42:09] month later he said no that wasn't us
[1:42:10] saith the Lord he said we're all one
[1:42:15] blood see we're all creatures of the
[1:42:18] almighty you see there shouldn't be any
[1:42:19] differences in us it's inspired the
[1:42:21] wrong thing the civil rights movement
[1:42:24] see see them people and that's the
[1:42:27] reason I say that not that there's any
[1:42:28] prophecy concerning it but yet he said
[1:42:31] I'm on tape he said and you'll know
[1:42:33] afterwards he said that I just read you
[1:42:35] that see we got to let him be a man
[1:42:39] he thinks he's guessing he thinks it's
[1:42:41] gonna be that's what's gonna happen I
[1:42:45] have nothing on it from the Lord and you
[1:42:47] be sure now if I
[1:42:48] anything from the Lord like that to tell
[1:42:50] you I'm speaking now but when he speaks
[1:42:51] I say it's not me it's thus saith the
[1:42:54] Lord and I can't say it until he tells
[1:42:56] me I could be altogether wrong and I
[1:42:58] thought about Martin Luther King jr. I
[1:43:00] don't know I can't say that's just my
[1:43:01] opinion well what does Jefferson bill
[1:43:03] gonna do with that quote back here he
[1:43:06] said that's exactly the jefferson bill
[1:43:07] every word is das saith the lord so
[1:43:09] that's exactly going to happen and it
[1:43:12] hasn't happened were they gonna do with
[1:43:13] that well they'll say all you know God
[1:43:15] will help us to understand it we believe
[1:43:16] it anyway
[1:43:17] really okay believe whatever you want
[1:43:22] you can you can believe that if you want
[1:43:24] but I'm not gonna believe that so what's
[1:43:29] the cause of this air as a personal
[1:43:31] opinion but that doesn't disqualify him
[1:43:33] from being a prophet because it wasn't
[1:43:35] spoken with us say at the Lord we're
[1:43:37] called brother Branham was well
[1:43:38] acquainted with wars and uprising he
[1:43:40] lived during the first two world wars
[1:43:41] born in 1909 it seems his observations
[1:43:45] from his travels in the South States
[1:43:46] made him think of civil war was a
[1:43:48] possibility all humans including
[1:43:52] prophets are open their own opinions
[1:43:54] this opinion was not a prophecy is more
[1:43:56] like a warning against the uprising that
[1:43:58] would lead to a violent revolution
[1:44:01] Colossians 1:28 says Christians must
[1:44:03] offer warnings to all men when needed
[1:44:06] does that help by God's grace I was
[1:44:10] trying to show you just you know I was
[1:44:12] shocked when he said listen I'm this is
[1:44:13] on tape see we gotta be we just gotta be
[1:44:20] real sharp praise God we've got to be
[1:44:22] real straight with the Word of God
[1:44:25] we've got to know exactly what the word
[1:44:27] says so this is the one I'm you know I
[1:44:31] started writing the script I'm gonna
[1:44:32] make a video and share it with just
[1:44:33] Joseph and Billy Paul if they'll watch
[1:44:35] it I'm gonna email it the voice of God
[1:44:37] because they won't talk to me about it
[1:44:38] anymore they won't email me about it
[1:44:40] anymore they said we don't want to argue
[1:44:41] I said I'm not arguing I just want to
[1:44:43] talk about it they won't return my
[1:44:44] emails anymore so what can I do so but
[1:44:49] if every word is thus saith the Lord
[1:44:50] then Billy Paul is the real Joseph well
[1:44:54] then who is Joseph I don't know there
[1:44:58] to Josephson the old doesn't there's
[1:44:59] only one so who is he I don't know he
[1:45:04] said my little boy this is a 1951
[1:45:06] I forgot the 9 there sorry it's not 151
[1:45:09] it's 1951 little boy that's now he's
[1:45:13] soon to be 16 that's Billy Paul Billy
[1:45:14] Paul's 15 he said about a week after
[1:45:16] that I said daddy I want to be a
[1:45:17] Christian I want to serve Him
[1:45:18] my Joseph was right with me and I didn't
[1:45:20] even know it
[1:45:21] in 1946 Melbourne was praying in
[1:45:24] Minnesota in a hotel room and the Holy
[1:45:26] Spirit said you're gonna have a son
[1:45:27] named him Joseph so here we are five
[1:45:30] years later five years later he just had
[1:45:34] Sarah born Sarah wasn't a boy Sarah was
[1:45:38] a girl so boban thinks well okay well if
[1:45:43] this is a girl then I've already got my
[1:45:44] Joseph with me already I didn't even
[1:45:46] know it but yet four years after this he
[1:45:50] had a Joseph now if you listened
[1:45:58] what sermon is at 1965 brother Brennan
[1:46:02] tells his story about Joseph and brother
[1:46:04] Graham makes it sound like he never
[1:46:05] wavered on it
[1:46:09] Levin tells his story and the preacher a
[1:46:13] preacher made fun of him and said oh
[1:46:14] it's Sarah Oh Sarah was born not Joseph
[1:46:18] oh you met and Josephine but Ram said
[1:46:20] that man died because he mocked for the
[1:46:22] branham's prophecy but if brother when
[1:46:25] brother and tells the story he never
[1:46:27] says anything about how he doubted this
[1:46:30] who this was gonna be why because he was
[1:46:34] a man he wasn't perfect he fell short of
[1:46:39] the glory of God sometimes row bran
[1:46:41] would reveal his mistakes
[1:46:42] other times he just didn't think in
[1:46:43] minute which was okay when it was last
[1:46:46] time you told all your mistakes
[1:46:47] everybody publicly remember I said that
[1:46:50] a few weeks ago I would like to come up
[1:46:52] here and just admit all your mistakes
[1:46:53] this past week we didn't like to do that
[1:46:54] I don't think I get any takers on that
[1:46:59] see the little baby I thought would be
[1:47:01] Joseph is a little girl and I called her
[1:47:03] Sarah I'm thankful for her I love her
[1:47:06] with all my heart so this is the first
[1:47:07] one I'm going to bring to the on the
[1:47:09] video I've already written it out I'm
[1:47:10] about halfway done with the script I
[1:47:11] hope to record
[1:47:12] I want to record yesterday I just have
[1:47:13] time so I want to record it maybe next
[1:47:16] Saturday how in the world can you say
[1:47:19] this is thus saith the Lord because that
[1:47:21] means Billy Paul is the real Joseph
[1:47:23] well who's Joseph is that he's an
[1:47:24] imposter right if it's I say the Lord
[1:47:27] this is the save Lord then he's somebody
[1:47:30] else I don't know and that means really
[1:47:33] pause I'm a prophet but then Browne also
[1:47:35] said the Billy Paul's not called to
[1:47:36] preach anymore it's not gonna be a
[1:47:38] prophet if he's not a caught if she's
[1:47:39] not allowed to preach what have you made
[1:47:43] this now what have they made this if
[1:47:45] everywhere does that say the Lord and
[1:47:47] you know there's quotes but Ram said he
[1:47:49] prayed that Billy Paul would be a
[1:47:50] preacher in a prophet he said lord I
[1:47:53] believe you're gonna make Billy Paul
[1:47:54] prophet and a preacher someday you know
[1:47:57] program said Rebecca would take his
[1:47:59] place
[1:48:01] did you know program said Sarah would
[1:48:03] take his place one day seeing the
[1:48:05] visions and praying for the sick did
[1:48:07] never do that not that I've seen I've
[1:48:09] got a quote program said may double may
[1:48:12] God double x double every gift I have
[1:48:15] and give it to Joseph is that the said
[1:48:17] the Lord I email guy on YouTube one of
[1:48:20] the guys from Jeffersonville I said if
[1:48:21] this is the say the Lord then come tell
[1:48:23] me when Joseph Branham is discerning
[1:48:25] people because I want to get in the
[1:48:26] prayer line because we're gonna have
[1:48:27] double x double all the answers to
[1:48:29] prayer and he said oh you're a man of
[1:48:32] misunderstanding I said no I'm just
[1:48:34] saying what the tape say right double x
[1:48:39] double okay well if a couple of people
[1:48:42] raised from the dead then I should see
[1:48:44] double with Joseph raising from the dead
[1:48:46] I asked two of Joseph Brennan's closest
[1:48:52] childhood friends I said can you prove
[1:48:54] me any proof as the Prophet has he ever
[1:48:56] said they'll say Lord they both said no
[1:48:58] they said the only thing they had was
[1:49:00] that one employee a voice of God
[1:49:02] got up from a morning and opened his
[1:49:05] email and I guess he was looking at
[1:49:07] something evil on the internet the night
[1:49:08] before and he got an email from Joseph
[1:49:11] Branham and this is when all around
[1:49:12] voice of God and he said what were you
[1:49:14] doing last night on the internet so that
[1:49:17] could be it could be a gift to
[1:49:18] discernment or if he was on the voice of
[1:49:21] God's internet server he can check what
[1:49:24] websites they go to
[1:49:25] and then it wouldn't be a gift of
[1:49:26] discernment right Church I don't know
[1:49:33] but Brennan said double times double so
[1:49:36] see his human desires and prayers
[1:49:38] weren't let's say at the Lord it was
[1:49:41] thus at the Lord when he said thus saith
[1:49:43] of the Lord Amen man I hope it's helping
[1:49:48] you Church I hope it's helping you but
[1:49:50] Ranas misinterpretation ability Paul as
[1:49:52] his promise Joseph was both the honest
[1:49:53] mistake and his personal opinion
[1:49:55] he never said Billy Paul's my Joseph
[1:49:57] thus saith Lord he never said that
[1:49:58] brother rogram was simply trying to
[1:50:00] understand the meaning of the Lord's
[1:50:02] promised him about a son named Joseph
[1:50:04] while waiting for the promise to come to
[1:50:06] pass let's give you a bible example oh
[1:50:11] that's easy
[1:50:11] genesis 16 abraham's and sarah tried to
[1:50:14] figure out god's promise for abram to
[1:50:16] have seen come from his own bowels how
[1:50:19] is this promise gonna come about oh
[1:50:21] listen to abraham you take hagar then
[1:50:24] you'll have seed from your body
[1:50:26] yes we figured out we did it we figured
[1:50:28] out god's word God don't do it would
[1:50:29] like that God doesn't ask you to figure
[1:50:32] it out God doesn't ask me to figure it
[1:50:34] out God figures it out God brings it the
[1:50:37] pass and what it produced a wild man
[1:50:40] Ishmael see we can't let our personal
[1:50:44] opinions try to bring the promise of God
[1:50:48] to pass no let me go just five more
[1:50:54] minutes oh I'm so timer here I know you
[1:50:56] I've been about hour and a half give me
[1:50:58] about five more minutes
[1:50:59] more willing on Wednesday we'll look at
[1:51:02] a few more of these now these are all
[1:51:04] doctrinal statements because what I mean
[1:51:06] by dr. blood Ram will say something and
[1:51:08] then he'll quote a scripture and he'll
[1:51:11] try to teach something but then they're
[1:51:13] actually he changes it later or he
[1:51:15] admits he's later wrong so how many know
[1:51:18] that Bob Arum said Jesus is not on the
[1:51:20] throne in heaven right now I mean no he
[1:51:21] said that I've heard preachers preach
[1:51:22] that it was a couple of years ago at a
[1:51:24] convention and Wendy went to I listened
[1:51:26] to it and the brother he's a real famous
[1:51:28] preacher I love him I'm his friend on
[1:51:30] Facebook he's a wonderful brother but he
[1:51:32] said he said Saints he said Jesus ain't
[1:51:35] in heaven right now Jesus is on earth
[1:51:37] and the place erupted
[1:51:39] I'm thinking man are you serious brother
[1:51:42] that's okay I make mistakes too
[1:51:45] but he's quoting this we're brother Ram
[1:51:48] said Jesus is not in heaven anymore he's
[1:51:50] on the throne of your heart which it's
[1:51:52] true he's on the throne of your heart as
[1:51:54] the seal of the Holy Ghost but he's
[1:51:56] still in heaven Amen praise God he then
[1:52:00] his corporal body is still in heaven
[1:52:03] hallelujah his corporal body still in
[1:52:09] heaven but yet his spirit can be in each
[1:52:12] and every one of our souls at the same
[1:52:14] time as a throne of God but seabird ran
[1:52:18] thought it's kind of kind of me too when
[1:52:20] I study sometimes I think I'll get oh
[1:52:21] that's a good thought oh yeah yeah I see
[1:52:23] that but I didn't set it out all the way
[1:52:24] I gotta come by and fix it later let's
[1:52:29] see the quote well dad said where's his
[1:52:31] throne today now this is right after the
[1:52:33] church ages this is a couple of days
[1:52:36] before that the Holy Ghost came down and
[1:52:39] did the seven the seven shadows for the
[1:52:42] seven Church ages on the back wall of
[1:52:44] the brand tabernacle remember brother
[1:52:47] never was there he's seen it brother
[1:52:48] never was there he said well where's the
[1:52:52] throne today now brother Neville if I
[1:52:53] passed over who asked me Wow where's his
[1:52:55] throne today I think I'll get to it now
[1:52:56] where's his throne at now if he's not on
[1:52:59] his throne now he isn't on his throne
[1:53:01] now no sir where's his throne at now in
[1:53:08] the heart so this is where the brother
[1:53:11] got it from which he's studying the
[1:53:13] message you know I found it while I was
[1:53:14] studying the message and when I preached
[1:53:15] that revelation series the remm said
[1:53:19] he's not on his throne now he's in the
[1:53:22] heart
[1:53:22] oh my two years later he said he sits on
[1:53:27] the throne of God tonight and it must
[1:53:30] remain there for by his stripes
[1:53:32] he's the sacrifice the sacrifice is on
[1:53:35] the altar see he fixes it if not then if
[1:53:41] everyone
[1:53:42] I'll say the Lord well no he's not on
[1:53:44] the throne wait wait yeah he is no he's
[1:53:47] not
[1:53:48] yeah is see how you have quotes fighting
[1:53:50] against each other God is not the author
[1:53:52] of confusion so how do you know it'll
[1:53:55] just we've got the word to know praise
[1:53:57] God we prove all things by the word of
[1:54:00] God hallelujah that's why God gave you
[1:54:02] the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[1:54:04] would discern the truth because he is
[1:54:06] the Spirit of Truth that's how you know
[1:54:09] that's what the brothers told us that
[1:54:10] voice and God member Jose they told us
[1:54:12] well if we got to make every word us say
[1:54:15] the Lord because we're not sure which
[1:54:16] ones or not
[1:54:17] and I said that I said well that's why
[1:54:18] God gave us all he goes to rightly
[1:54:20] divide the word of truth and they just
[1:54:22] said okay went on to something else see
[1:54:26] that they don't want to hear it they
[1:54:28] want to believe because they're their
[1:54:29] money's invested into it their 401ks
[1:54:32] their income everything since they got
[1:54:34] to keep the money coming might be all
[1:54:38] about money are they sincere absolutely
[1:54:41] are they nice hardly we could be hard to
[1:54:44] be treated any nicer hospitality now
[1:54:48] that did they give us the I think they
[1:54:49] offered us water to I mean never gave us
[1:54:51] a water and they were Lord you know
[1:54:52] there's a reward for that well see you
[1:54:56] can't make every word that I say floor
[1:54:58] because they contradict each other he's
[1:54:59] on his throne by the Amen no he's not
[1:55:01] he's not on his throne he's not on
[1:55:03] strong weight yeah yeah yes no he's not
[1:55:06] yeah yes no he's not
[1:55:08] and now who you gonna believe I'm gonna
[1:55:12] believe the word praise God
[1:55:15] I believe the Lord see and then he says
[1:55:21] later he says the Bible said he's a high
[1:55:23] priest right now a high priest sitting
[1:55:25] at the right hand the majesty of God to
[1:55:28] make intercessions upon our confession
[1:55:30] right now now here's was that here's was
[1:55:34] his doctrine he said the first throne
[1:55:37] was in heaven which this sounds pretty
[1:55:38] good first orders in heaven
[1:55:41] judgment-seat second throne was in
[1:55:42] Christ third as in man because no ground
[1:55:44] liked numerology right he liked biblical
[1:55:46] numerology so do i but this was his
[1:55:48] teaching it was that he's gonna make
[1:55:49] this doctrine see it was in heaven than
[1:55:52] it was in Christ and now it's in the
[1:55:53] heart of man now that's true
[1:55:55] but it doesn't mean heavens empty heaven
[1:55:59] still has the corporal body of Jesus
[1:56:01] Christ amen
[1:56:02] all right so see you just honest mistake
[1:56:07] in church I never found brother I'm
[1:56:09] repeating that doctrine after that every
[1:56:12] time afterwards every time I type in
[1:56:13] throne and the body of Christ he's
[1:56:15] always in heaven still he's always in
[1:56:16] heaven still just a one-time thing
[1:56:20] see he thought there was a three-step
[1:56:22] progression changing from the throne in
[1:56:25] heaven to the throne Jesus body found a
[1:56:26] throne the believers heart leavers can
[1:56:28] see the progression of God dwelling
[1:56:29] among them today when he draws within
[1:56:31] men but that doesn't mean Jesus bodies
[1:56:33] not on the heavenly throne this is a
[1:56:37] wonderful example of God correcting his
[1:56:39] prophet on doctrine and this shows how
[1:56:44] brother Branham can grow in grace and
[1:56:46] knowledge of the Lord what a perfect
[1:56:49] example he thought oh he's not on it
[1:56:51] anymore but then God straightens him out
[1:56:53] later and says no he is seated on the
[1:56:55] throne right now
[1:56:58] preachers must grow an understanding
[1:57:00] just like every other believer believer
[1:57:02] brother Branham was constantly growing
[1:57:04] in wisdom and understanding
[1:57:05] Apollo screw in revelation after meeting
[1:57:08] with Aquila and Priscilla in acts 18 26
[1:57:12] Peter was corrected about his by pause
[1:57:14] dr. enough separating from the eating
[1:57:16] with Gentiles and Galatians 2 this was
[1:57:19] the spirit of discrimination the spirit
[1:57:21] of pride may be spirit division
[1:57:22] something related Peter urges all of us
[1:57:25] to grow in our knowledge of the Lord do
[1:57:27] you want to be stagnant in your
[1:57:28] understanding or do you want to grow in
[1:57:29] your understanding of Christ I want to
[1:57:31] grow I'm gonna go good brother branham
[1:57:33] grow yeah
[1:57:34] can you grow absolutely I can grow let's
[1:57:39] stand to our feet we'll stop right there
[1:57:40] I actually that was my last kind of ran
[1:57:42] out of time for the quotes because you
[1:57:45] know church I want to take a little bit
[1:57:46] time and I want you to see the quotes I
[1:57:48] want you to see them so that you
[1:57:51] understand so understand like this we
[1:57:54] accept God's prophet but we've got to
[1:57:57] remember brother Branham is not aren't
[1:57:59] really the interpreter right the Holy
[1:58:03] Spirit is the interpreter
[1:58:06] does a profit reveal yes but not every
[1:58:09] word brother branham said interprets the
[1:58:11] Bible the Holy Spirit is the interpreter
[1:58:15] the Holy Spirit directs us back to the
[1:58:17] word by God's grace I wanted you to see
[1:58:22] him now as I said I want to I'll get to
[1:58:24] the other ones here I got a whole bunch
[1:58:28] brother Brahim says the Holy Ghost is
[1:58:30] the third person of the Trinity I got a
[1:58:35] quote brother am said it doesn't even
[1:58:36] matter how you're baptized Lord Jesus
[1:58:37] Christ if I almost don't even matter he
[1:58:39] said honey no why you guys get upset
[1:58:41] upset about he says when other times
[1:58:43] he's blasting it like you're gonna be
[1:58:44] rebaptised what which one is it it's the
[1:58:49] word it's the word this is the one he
[1:58:56] said they're seven weeks from Pentecost
[1:58:58] atonement that was it was four months
[1:58:59] four times four so it was 16 weeks not
[1:59:01] seven weeks and brother BAM said it's a
[1:59:03] mix-up on the tape
[1:59:05] he said but remember if there's a mix-up
[1:59:07] look in the Bible and this one by the
[1:59:09] Amen I were talking about earlier this
[1:59:10] year we had a preacher coming here and
[1:59:12] said oh well the new birth is different
[1:59:14] from the baptism remember that program
[1:59:18] does say that but then later on after
[1:59:22] the seals he said no it's all one in the
[1:59:24] same thing his brother branham his
[1:59:31] brother branham fallible Church yes is
[1:59:34] the Holy Ghost fallible no no the Holy
[1:59:38] Ghost is not fallible is the Holy Ghost
[1:59:40] infallible absolutely and that's what
[1:59:44] we're supposed to have in our souls and
[1:59:46] bodiham said it's like a little buzzer
[1:59:48] brother amen
[1:59:48] whenever you hear something wrong like
[1:59:50] when I heard these quotes so Oh
[1:59:52] literally when I heard that cord about
[1:59:54] brother Ram or Jesus not being on the
[1:59:56] throne a couple years ago it went the
[1:59:58] buzzer went off because what if I would
[2:00:02] preach that sister Wendy Jesus is not in
[2:00:05] heaven right now he's in you speak the
[2:00:07] word whatever you want have it right now
[2:00:09] what if I said that and what if she
[2:00:13] spoke it and then it come to pass
[2:00:14] would she have any confidence in me
[2:00:15] after that probably not
[2:00:18] and we got to be careful that sometimes
[2:00:21] happens at those special meetings or
[2:00:23] wherever there's a lot of excitement we
[2:00:25] got to be careful Church can you just
[2:00:30] speak the word well no you only speak it
[2:00:31] if he tells you to speak it
[2:00:34] don't ask according to your lust but ask
[2:00:37] according to the will of God musicians
[2:00:39] if you'll come by God's grace why you
[2:00:44] given that buzzer to protect your life
[2:00:48] but you don't go on this far side as
[2:00:51] we're seeing in Indiana we're seeing
[2:00:53] this far side go and they're just
[2:00:55] hanging their soul on every word on the
[2:00:57] tape I'm sorry I'm not doing that the
[2:01:02] tapes point me back to the Word of God
[2:01:05] and every word in here is thus saith the
[2:01:09] Lord that God allowed it and it's true
[2:01:12] right it's a true event of something
[2:01:14] that happened if it's not prophecy it's
[2:01:15] a true thing it's real but in other
[2:01:18] sizes we don't need brother Branham
[2:01:20] anymore well then you're leaving out
[2:01:21] water baptism in Jesus Christ's name
[2:01:23] you're leaving out casting out Devils
[2:01:25] and miracles you're leaving out this
[2:01:26] original scene you're leaving out God as
[2:01:28] was just one person so it's not either
[2:01:30] side it's right and with God's side in
[2:01:33] the Bible it's right in the middle of
[2:01:34] the road praise God let's just bow our
[2:01:42] heads here for a moment by the grace of
[2:01:43] the Lord and this this quote just comes
[2:01:48] to me you know we at our house we're
[2:01:49] listening through the seven seals right
[2:01:51] now we're in the breach but there's a
[2:01:53] quote in God hiding himself and
[2:01:55] simplicity brother Branham said the
[2:01:56] church we either going to one side of
[2:01:57] the it'll go into fanaticism where
[2:01:59] everything has to be emotion or I felt I
[2:02:01] felt that I felt it or I'll go on the
[2:02:03] side of cold intellectualism a church
[2:02:06] you and I know we're not we're not going
[2:02:08] on the side of fanaticism we're more
[2:02:12] tempted to go on the side of
[2:02:13] intellectualism my brother has had the
[2:02:16] bride of Jesus Christ has the
[2:02:19] understanding uses her mind to look to
[2:02:24] the word to discern the word but she's
[2:02:26] also got a real warmth in her heart
[2:02:28] with the emotion for the Holy Spirit
[2:02:30] how many want a warm heart here today
[2:02:33] where you feel the warm you feel the
[2:02:35] anointing but it's under control by the
[2:02:38] wisdom in your heart how many want that
[2:02:39] by God's grace let me pray for you that
[2:02:43] God will help you to grow in grace you
[2:02:44] pray for me that we will grow together
[2:02:46] in Grace and knowledge of the Lord and
[2:02:49] keep a warm heart for Jesus Christ and
[2:02:53] you don't get scared about the anointing
[2:02:55] you don't get scared but the anointing
[2:02:56] is under control to the Holy Spirit in
[2:02:59] your soul
[2:03:01] let's pray together Heavenly Father we
[2:03:04] love you today we thank you Lord that
[2:03:06] you're here to prove all things we honor
[2:03:09] your prophet we still believe he's a
[2:03:11] problem you always believe that but Lord
[2:03:14] we're showing father how the Bible is
[2:03:19] the absolute how every word of yours is
[2:03:23] the same to the holiday hallelujah thank
[2:03:26] you Lord and no flesh shall glory in
[2:03:30] your presence teach us plainly help us
[2:03:34] to grow in knowledge and understanding

[2:03:39] gave us through the leadership of God
[2:03:42] but let us also be open to the anointing
[2:03:45] of the Holy Spirit to feel warm in our
[2:03:48] heart and feel your holiness to feel the
[2:03:51] anointing are in our minds and our
[2:03:52] bodies give us the middle-of-the-road

[2:03:58] starchy but let us be on fire for you
[2:04:01] Lord keeping the great belts I'll
[2:04:04] believe it when it's proved by the word
[2:04:06] I'll believe it when the Lord reveals it
[2:04:08] to me yeah hallelujah

[2:04:15] yourself to your people
[2:04:16] and then let them take the time to go
[2:04:19] back to the Bible the fruit to believe
[2:04:21] that it's right
[2:04:23] or Paul said whether we are an angel and
[2:04:27] anything in the word its curse so we've
[2:04:30] got to take everything back to the word
[2:04:32] to agree with it and help me Lord help
[2:04:36] every preacher in the fivefold ministry
[2:04:38] help us as we witness not to say things
[2:04:41] what I believe I was guilty
[2:04:43] I was almost guilty what about Hillary
[2:04:45] Clinton becoming president Lord forgive
[2:04:47] me I never prophesied but I sure made it
[2:04:50] sound like it was gonna be that's my
[2:04:52] human mistake you're gonna just kind of
[2:04:56] predicted just want to be ready to your
[2:04:58] company or we've all got it dear god

[2:05:15] moon help us to be humble help us to be

[2:07:47] ladies doc no church that's a reality to
[2:07:50] me you know the reason I haven't
[2:07:52] preached those false doctrines because I
[2:07:54] was in his presence praise God
[2:07:56] are you with me I come across all those
[2:07:58] quotes reason I don't preach some of
[2:08:01] those things is because I got in his
[2:08:02] presence and as his presence is where he
[2:08:05] reveals the truth because he directs us
[2:08:07] to the word always to be ventured the
[2:08:14] people don't get this presence enough so
[2:08:16] they'll just say whatever but we're all
[2:08:19] guilty but that's why I appreciate the
[2:08:22] present it'll direct me away from my
[2:08:27] thoughts and directly to the word that's
[2:08:34] the beauty of spending time with the law
[2:08:36] how many enjoy spending time with the
[2:08:37] look my brother's saying about it

[2:08:53] helps you to kind of step over them so

[2:08:57] present that's right and stumble over
[2:09:01] that 1977 sister care
