TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's why we're here tonight because he's fighting for us amen let's take our bibles go to joshua chapter 17. like to continue on this series here and uh preach the word of god to you tonight to be a help to you a blessing by the grace of the lord joshua 17. just want to encourage you and your position in the lord praise god and i trust some things have been said the last few services that have been helped to you i know i've been really blessed and encouraged especially knowing that other people are listening to and being helped and feed on that that always encourages me as well but i've had a better week of prayer this week so i thank the lord for that and i think it was just you know hearing one thing what really helped me was hearing brother vang situation that just really moved me like wow it's starting to get a little serious for some of us you know so that really helped me and um let's just be uh really sensitive to the holy spirit praise god and uh we don't know all that's going to happen but one thing we do know that's going to happen is we're going to show the love of jesus christ to this world that's how they'll know they're my disciples that we love one another praise god and then we will love jesus christ with all of our hearts we'll love one another that's our main desire praise god to manifest the love of christ joshua chapter 17 let's just read let's start at verse 14. i'm gonna kind of build to 14 and try to just you know finish the chapter there towards the end of this hour-long sermon hopefully it'll be by god's grace joshua 17 this is one of those beautiful thoughts that i hope the holy spirit can help me to relate to i remember i was telling you oh there's some beautiful thoughts later in the chat later in the book i thought it was one sunday you know last wednesday i hope this is another beautiful never seen it this in depth before and that proves to me that the holy ghost is revealing more truth because he's guiding us into all truth i never had these thoughts to this year so i just believe it's god giving us further revelation so i'm trusting that so let's read 14. i just want you to look at the attitude here uh we have a complaint from the children of this is five to seven years after they've already been in the land you know overcame jericho overcome ai the five kings uh judah already had the land ephraim had the land well manasseh has a little complaint they're complaining because of the battle and joshua has to encourage them and he has to speak the word to them praise god you'll see how it kind of goes here tonight so let let me read this just for the sake of time and then we'll read our memory verse for brother stephen together let me just read this myself here so the word of god says joshua 17 14 and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a great people for as much as the lord hath bless me hitherto so manasseh feels like i don't have enough you need to give me another portion verse 15 and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get up or get the up to the wood country and cut down thyself there in the land of the parasites and the giants if mount eve from be too narrow for the look at verse 16. now we finally get to the bottom of this why they're complaining it's fear fear is causing them to complain at church the same thing happens with us but let's read verse or let me read 16 and the children of joseph said the hill's not enough for us and all canines that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron so now we see the real reason why they're saying more land they don't want to go to the land that was already given to them because they're afraid of the chariots of iron ever have that where god's calling you to something and you just a little afraid to take the possession a little afraid to possess or possess the promises of god that's how they'd gotten after five to seven years they kind of lost that initial confidence that they could defeat any foe and they are of the valley of jezreel okay if we do one let's go to remember verse philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. we'll read this one together philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. praise god let's read verses two and three together and just trust the lord to write this upon the fleshy tables of our hearts here ready on three one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mine let each esteem other better than themselves praise god let's have one more prayer if you ever need on your heart let's just make another god here heavenly father we don't come here in former fashion but we come by faith and lord through the holy spirit of truth oh god we thank you god we pray you meet every need lord you saw the hands that are up lord i just pray to speak to people hear present and also listening dear god in the name of jesus christ just anoint us for this service the purpose of this service lord god i've studied i've done what i can do lord i prayed i'm all like god just lord to go above and beyond my efforts because my efforts the lord are are just mine when i pray you do something supernatural or speak your word to your people lord give them the desire of their heart i pray in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated there uh we have slides here so you can hold them up here part 23 on joshua there's only 24 captors so we're coming down here close to the end i'm just checking to see if there's anything urgent here on the phone okay okay so part three i'm going to turn back to joshua so uh we're trying to do about 45 minutes and then uh hopefully we can finish around eight or so by god's grace so we're looking at here joshua again and and uh we're looking at chapter 17. we finished 16 there on sunday and begin looking at 17 and again i want to say sunday what a what a wonderful job everybody did pulling on the word of god i think i preached two hours and it felt like an hour it even felt less than that so uh thank you for pulling on the word of god that's what makes being a pastor a real blessing the people love the word of god they can say amen they can clap they can smile they can enjoy the word of god so thank you for your your love for the word of god that's what separates us church from everybody else is our love for the word we have preeminence for the word of god more so than anyone else that ought to be what separates us praise god so joshua chapter 17. now we got there the uh the outline there's 17. here's the outline again i think i'll just review it real briefly here and then we'll start getting down to the major thoughts i'd like to minister on here tonight so verses one and two give the a lot of the half tribe of manasseh and and then verses three to six that's kind of what we ended on on sunday morning i should say sunday morning sunday first service because it wasn't morning it was afternoon uh the daughters of zahala fahad uh received their inheritance and we found our sisters can receive all the blessings of god amen all the rights for our sisters they can receive them same for our brothers praise god all of our brothers now i just thought about that just now but the ram said stephen wasn't a preacher but yet it looked like he preached in acts chapter 7. remember that right before he was stoned they bring him to the council and he sounds like a preacher he starts with abraham and he goes all down through comes up through david and solomon and he says you stiff-necked men how often you rest or how often you resist the holy ghost and then they stone him it's a whole chapter of basically church history right and there he is he's not a preacher but he's expounding all the word of god and he's discerning their spirits right he's discerning judging that they're resisting the holy spirit in other words they're keeping the holy spirit instead of accepting the holy spirit praise god so there you have like this this liberty of god right the liberty of god to let sisters speak the word of god at times in certain ways just not behind the pulpit and brothers they might not be called behind the pulpit but they can truly speak the word of god amen many again many of god's blessings are going to come through speaking the word of god hallelujah by opening your mouth and letting the re the living rivers of water flow from your mouth that's what jesus said when you get the holy ghost that water will flow freely praise god now of course not every day of your life you know but when you get under the anointing you confess your sins and you get under prayer and under the anointing that it's very likely the waters of life are ready to flow from the lips of your mouth praise god amen so that's what happened to stephen at a young age i believe in philanthropy he was 25 when they uh when they martyred him if i'm not mistaken i wrote it in the book i did the history in the book it's in the book i just showed how stephen had one or two years of mystery and yet jesus stood up to honor him when he came into his his kingdom praise god and whereas john had over 70 years of ministry what the what didn't jesus say both get the same reward praise god amen hallelujah so it doesn't matter how long it don't matter how long we got to serve god we got to serve god all the days of our life and we'll expect the same reward praise god because we're all laboring in the vineyard whether it's in the heatness or the heat rather than bait or the end of the day no matter how long we labor whether it's one hour or whether it's eight hours or 12 hours no matter how long we labor jesus gives the same reward praise god i want to be thankful for that praise god forget the reward of eternal life amen thank god now struck i never really thought about steven until just now in that way with uh this this thought here uh with brothers being able to speak the word of god as well and there may not be preachers because it don't matter uh you can still speak for god at any time amen now the borders here of manasseh are described in verses 7 to 13 and you stop you see rivers you see seas uh you see uh different towns they go through it's a unique boundary here of the half tribe of nasa very unique boundary okay just as we saw all the other boundaries none of them were the same they were all unique and they all required uh different boundaries now um i'm sorry that was just one of my notes never got to that thought but let me just go to this thought okay just i'm just going to review this remember paul said he had finished his court at the end of his life so he had he had walked in all the land god had called him to amen and that was only two years after saying he not yet attained so see god makes all things beautiful in his time in season now we know last week we went through all his ministries he no doubt had all five preaching gifts no doubt about it as far as i'm concerned from the bible and the quotes in history it seems to me no doubt about it um now his vocations he was a faithful tent maker and in his day god called him not to take anything from that specific church he was at now remember he did take things from other churches right but there were some times in the month of corinthians he didn't take anything he was just a master temp maker he was able to make a tent by the way and that you'd sleep it would handle all the weather you sleep in it and you feel like this is going to last forever he was he was such a good tent maker he must because he was faithful just as he was faithful with the word he was faithful with his job and may god help us to do the same amen be faithful with the word be faithful with our occupations as well be the best worker you can be praise god i got my next uh i got my next uh what do they call it like a grading for me coming up last time i got the highest score i'm hoping to get the highest score this year but it's coming up in a couple weeks here so i'm gonna strive to get the highest grade i can on this one to be the best teacher i can be uh but that's how paul was he was a expert tap maker in common with aquila right now his vo his locations was led by the holy spirit remember he tried to go to asia one time and the holy spirit said not now he said go down to macedonia remember that he got the macedonian mission remember there was one time he had to leave i forget which church he was we had a little church so he could go to jerusalem and be there by the by the festival time because he had a vow to keep you see he was led by the holy spirit on his locations as well he was one that didn't stay in one place very long but then you have other people that stayed in certain places for their whole life they got gotta just call them to be there other people called to travel now don't get jealous if you like to travel but you know god's not called you to travel don't get jealous right and if you if god's called you to travel don't complain about traveling and it's hard to travel in copenhagen but uh it's starting to open up a little bit in fact i saw an article today it's so it's so funny they said oh uh they all the airlines expect to be open by 2024 huh that's when the next presidential election is going to be makes sense doesn't it get they're going to try to cheat again and get their own candidate in again just like they did last time interesting that they say that but see church we can't complain what god has called us to be sometimes i wish i traveled more but i've learned to be content right it will whatever state god's called me to be in may god help me be content praise god and same with you and i whatever god's called us to be in each area of our life we should show contentment by the holy spirit not complain not and others right we just read be kind to others praise god right have one mind don't be jealous of other preachers don't be muslim other brothers other sisters be thankful for what you have because godliness with contentment is a great spiritual attainment amen that's a great mountain you can possess amen being content with what you have praise god and living a holy life that's a great achievement that's a great giant to slaughter amen hallelujah thank god now just so you know i'm going to say this i'll mention again all these are in my book in chapter 11. i tried to simmer it down or what's it called not silver evaporated down what's in another word distill it down i tried this what was it condensed that's the word thank you that's a hundred dollar word right there if you want to get that going to kent state university right there you try to condense it down and i found i could be wrong five is the number of grace but i could be wrong brother i thought there was five errors that we have everyone has to be responsible for in life and i could be wrong i'm just saying i try to condense it down to uh the areas so the next one was gifts of the spirit now paul said i speak with tongues more than you all well no doubt this guy would encourage church if anybody needed encouragement it would fall we went through his list right of beatings and trials and sufferings and if anybody needed to speak with tongues it would fall right and you need it just ask god for i talked to numerous people they just needed god to encourage them to speak in tongues and god let them now i ask and i don't get to so you keep asking i'm asking too amen just keep asking but if anybody needed a just strength to keep going it would have been paul so god let him speak with tongues god let him prophesy uh god let him do discern spirits right he descended the spirit of that man that was trying to get uh that he called the son of the devil that he called blind elimus elimus he discerned that spirit so i believe if i studied it out i could probably find that he had at least eight of the nine gifts of the holy spirit i don't know that we have a scripture where he interpreted tongues but i wouldn't put it past him would you i wouldn't if he had all the preaching gifts and if if martin luther had all nine spiritual gifts what about paul so i believe we could probably prove it if we just took the time the thought just came to me so i didn't really study it out yet but i believe we can find that don't you no doubt if anybody had wisdom it was paul right here if anybody had a word of knowledge to point him to the word of god it would have been paul right miracles right here we go here we go americans uh divine healing praise god uh all these gifts of the holy spirit i believe we'd find them in this man of god except maybe interpretation and then relationships this is an area where he had a special gift he didn't really desire wife right and paul said to each man his own gift right and so that's what we're given here in the scripture uh it seems to me there's around five maybe less maybe more uh areas church that you and i must attain to at the end of our lives we want to say i walked in the course that god had me to walk right now he was faithful in all these preaching gifts as we said along with every other heir of his life now how many like art everyone like nature likes did you have art today in at school yeah all right good we had music uh how many like art though oh i just had this idea after i preached sunday mo uh the first service remember i put all these in chapter five so if you want to go read that list i don't have the audio ready yet but if you want to read that you can read it now i already preached it you know a year ago maybe but i just thought wouldn't it be interesting just to give us a little visual this is brazil right but let's just have just have a let's just pretend that we're christians right and we're trying to take the land there is a time and season let's pretend this is your land okay there we go mercy i just want to just want to give you a visual so i thought i'd be an artist tonight actually i drew that tonight at or today at school i was at school i had my break just pretend you are joshua and you are possessing your land you've got to go in the land and it doesn't really matter the order that these are in but there's something about you church that you want thus saith the lord for your relationships you just don't want any relationship you want to be thus saith the lord that god put these relationships together or lack thereof like paul right and church is something you have to battle for i don't know you have to battle sometimes in relationships to keep peace right to show forgiveness in your relationships and you've got to possess that land it's something you've got to conquer i can't do it for you you can't do it for me god has called you to possess that land that's right right and then when you possess that then you want to possess ministries that god has given to you and that can be almsgiving that can be giving of clothes like tabitha right she had a clothes mystery a music ministry right a song special ministry all these different ministries god has given to you a witnessing ministry robertson orphanage ministry is he said that's of the lord and you've got to possess that it may be a great amount of possession and maybe a lot of battles but church if you want if you want to be a real holy ghost field state you don't have a choice you've got to possess the land amen that's why church you won't be satisfied until you possess all these things cause that's what paul said paul says i'm not alive but i'm pressing towards the next goal i'm pressing toward the next land that i can possess i'm forgetting the losses in the past right i'm forgetting those things which are behind me but there's something about a christian you won't feel settled brother william you won't feel settled until every era you know you finish your course amen he's driven out every enemy he's driven out every giant praise god that's why you keep coming back to church right that's why you keep reading your bible praying studying the word of god listen to brother branham where you listen to some of my sermons or some of the visitors we've had here you can't feel settled you can't feel at peace until you possess all the promises of god amen and then church you got to press in you got to find the right vocation a lot of brothers struggle with that somebody somebody emailed me from i forget which state it was this week he's like i'm having such trouble with my job and he was worried about you know should he go back to school and get a biology degree with that contract the word of god i said no i said i know saints have got degrees i've got two degrees i could get it i could've got a lot more if i wanted to i could because it's school work right it's just learning it says there's nothing really hard about getting a degree but he was trying to say is god in that well yes god is in that because god needs an overcomer in the universities right god's got to have somebody that i stood there i heard all their lies i cast that down and i still passed the course and i told the professor about it or he read my he read my paper about it right and i took a stand for it and i really expressed christ to those people amen while the other people were cussing in the class or smoking after class or something like that i was reading my bible i was i was i was living a holy life and things like that god needs a witness in every area praise god so i told that man i said don't feel bad about that in fact when i told you this maybe when i came in the message a lot of my friends left because i heard brother brahm say education's wrong well i mean it is but i didn't feel allowed to do that right and so i stayed in education and now church a lot of my friends and family look at me and say well well you got one of the best jobs because you have all this time with your family in the church so i said thank you lord i'm glad i felt letting us in right and i see some of my family and friends they work endless hours they don't get any family time they don't get any vacations i get vacations all the time right but that's a lot that's why i just felt led of the lord to do that praise god and god has vindicated i told the one brother on the email i said i had so many families tell me that i was the answer to their prayers they wanted their children to have a good teacher in the beginning and it was a christian teacher and god used me to answer their prayer so this is just a humble thing just a just trying to find god's will for your life and then the gifts of the holy spirit that's one that we all can grow closer and right we all want to know god help me to help me to know my gifts and then help me to be faithful with them as well and that's where you know we really need to the bible said follow charity right but then covet gifts so that's one thing i i need i need the holy spirit to keep reminding me that's something we should pray for so every now and then we should just pray for that god we want to see gifts in church right a few months ago we prayed for our little daughters they would be prophets right here we pray that that uh he'll god pour out his spirit upon all flesh right i think i know i remember naomi was here i know my children were here when we prayed that prayer for the daughters like philip's daughters right we want daughters that prophesy praise god we want sons that prophesy hallelujah we want them to feel the premise of god as well amen let's see that's one that's one we can press into and can i say it like this with location one reason paul never felt like he arrived because he had to get to a place he had to get to rome because the holy spirit had been telling him you've got to go to rome you got to go to rome right every city where i don't it's witness that you must go up the road so that was one that's interesting i put in that last place because i must have been led by the lord there but paul's last ground that he possessed was going to rome and testifying to the leaders enrolled that jesus christ is alive and resurrected amen i wonder what his last words were before he was beheaded right there in rome right there in front of all those men remember remember the book of philippians he witnessed to every guard that was there in the jail so i imagine he was witnessing the whole time before his head got chopped off too just witnessing just manifesting and that was the very last and he could feel it he could feel when he wrote that last letter to timothy i finished my course i've done exactly what god's called me to do i possess the locations i possess the gifts in my life the vocations my ministry my relationships i've stayed pure i've done all these things i'm ready to be offered and i'm ready for the crowd amen hallelujah he's an overcomer church praise god how many want to be overcomers so i hope i hope next time church you think about your life you'll picture something like this because this is what came to my mind brother am i like i need to draw that in there that's that's me i'm possessing the land i possess these possess these i really feel like uh yeah maybe there may be more vocations or gifts or even ministries like one day i want to be a missionary if the lord be willing so i feel like there's more area for me to possess praise god i'm not attained i'm forgetting the things in the past i'm saying god forgive me my favorite in the past i'm going to go forward with you in the name of the lord jesus amen so let's possess our land church now here's one thing that's different from you and i we will attain the perfect will of god church now don't the foolish virgins have all these two don't they have them oh but do they really possess god's perfect will for their lives now think about lot and abraham did lot really possess he was foolish virgin did he really possess the perfect will of god for his life no because he lost his wife right he lost family members to sodom he lived a life daily vexed can you imagine being tormented every day who wants to live in torment the bible says the word devil means torment praise god who wants to live in torments that proves he never defeated some of those giants in his life right he let those giants live in his home the angels didn't want to go into his house brother he said we'd rather sleep on the streets i've never wanted to sleep in the street okay i stepped outside twice when i was in college on the florida beaches that was enough for me i don't want to go out to the streets but these angels said i'd rather sleep on the streets than walk in that man's house what was in that man's house well we know his women daughters that eventually wanted to sleep with him right there must have been something there must that was the end result but there must have been something laying in their spirits that would want to do that you understand that that that the incest the manifest had to start somewhere inside of their hearts or spirits no one angels didn't want to go in there right so see lot never possessed these things he never got to the perfect will of god like abraham where god convinced abraham amen and come right to his tent door hallelujah and visit him and say this time next year i'll visit you and sarah according to the time of life amen and you're going to possess the promise that i'm the land i promise to you for 25 years you're going to possess it in the right time in seas today man glory praise god he's going to possess that relationship of being a father to isaac's son amen he's got she's got to change some locations right because remember went up to uh the other king abimelech he had had to go to some locations he had to change sometimes but see he was in the perfect will of god that's one thing we should have that denominations won't we should have the perfect will of god because we know how to present our bodies a living sacrifice unto god and we know how to have our minds transformed amen if not you need to pull more on the word of god that's how you get your mind transformed you're going to go listen to brother dixon's friday night sermon again praise god under the influence i know you're right that's what i need to at times right we all need that we have to transform our mind out of carnal thinking into holy ghost thinking and then we possess these things remember let's go to ephesians 4 here this is one difference between the wise and foolish virgin the y spends her time redeeming it i just want to rehearse this i know it's i know it's something i've preached in the past can preach it a couple of times ago he was here we preached on the wise and foolish i just want to reiterate to you your use of time is what's most important because you will spend time in the areas god has called you into and then you will overcome in those areas how many can say amen to that see the foolish virgin will never possess the land in fact lot moved away from abraham right he left he forgot about the promised son he left that and he didn't spend his time on the right things if he would he would have lived in peace like abraham does god want us to live continue the life of torment i don't believe so i don't believe son we're supposed to stir up our pure minds by way of remembrance right walking in love imitating the father all right ephesians 4. well you know what i'm sorry might not be four might be five yeah i'm sorry after five five five verse fourteen where for he saith awake thou that sleepless and arise from the dead in christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly that means exactly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will the lord is so wise virgins will understand god's will proved it with god by spending time with god by being renewed in prayer with god having a renewed life by hearing the word wise virgins will know exactly what they did and they'll know they did it right before the lord but foolish versions will have questions i didn't really possess that why did this happen in my life why did i lose that why why how come i was tormented all these times because they didn't follow the revealed word of god their day all right does that make sense everybody understand okay now verse 18 kind of tells us why be and be not drunk with mine wearing his ex but be filled with the spirit see they didn't walk according to the feeling of the holy spirit they didn't stay filled with the holy spirit in their mind they never had in their soul right but they didn't keep it in their minds either okay foolish virgin now that's what foolish version would be would do they would not redeem their time and i've seen it like i told you i tell you all about all my friends that are not in the message and the same thing is true they spend all this time watching movies like we talk with tucker or the football game like we talked about on sunday with that preacher they spend that would be six hours if they watch the browns game and the buckeyes game six hours of wasted time they could have been in prayer they could have been in the bible they could have been in a bible study or something like that but where were we in the house of god amen redeeming the time because we know the days are evil we know the beast system is on the move but that means if they're on the move we're on the move too amen hallelujah jesus is going to rescue us from the beast system hallelujah amen hallelujah we're not ordained unto wrath but we're ordained to salvation paul said that's what i put in that texas foreigner so i'd like to share with you about the beast and the roman catholic church and the united states government and their role together that's what i said in the text but i haven't heard back so see that's one thing that separates us church we know the perfect will of god so that means church you know it was god's will where are you located it was god's will to give you those gifts and you were faithful those gifts it was god's will that you had this job or that job or stayed at home that's a real job you know it was god's will to do the ministries god called you to do you know it was god's will to be in the relationships that you were in because they didn't go against the word of god amen and the church said but see foolish virgins have all questions they haven't possessed these they haven't possessed the perfect will of god yes they get married yes they have ministries yeah they go to church and exercise gifts but they haven't possessed the perfect will of god for all those does that make sense they have all these things but they don't do god's perfect will for them right all right i hope that's simple there by god's grace now let me lay this in here go to uh romans 8 15. we'll just read these down malachi lydia can you get your bibles ready uh malachi romans 8 23 lydia galatians 4 7. brother jose can you get first john 3 2 do you like reading brother jose first john 3 2. can you get that one i just want to lay this in here without having to preach a whole sermon on it church i believe if you are born again you are in the process of being adopted the full adoption doesn't take place to get the new body that's what the bible says and if you're adopted then that means you have the rights of the father the you have the inheritance of the father praise god right that's what it means doesn't mean you're a beggar a child is not a beggar right a child is a heir praise god a child is a possessor praise the lord lydia doesn't have to sign papers to drive the car here when she's you know you have to make a deal with me and give me money to drive the car she's my daughter now if you take my car i might say am i no i'm just kidding my neighbors caught him i have to pay me some money to borrow my car maokai and lydia don't have to ask me to go in the fridge they know they can go in the fridge now don't touch my stuff though but you understand their family praise god and so are we that's why brother abraham says our name on the check is good just as good as god's amen when we ask according to his will right we shouldn't ask for a mercedes right i don't think we should ask for that we shouldn't ask for you know mansions and things like that why would we want to mention here we want the mansion over there praise god we don't want to get this confused i don't want my mansion here i want my mansion over there praise god you know we have a place to live and if god gives you something that's different we talk about that but we want to set our sights on things above praise god set your affections on things of love but yet we have authority as children of god yeah i'm reading romans 8 15 and then malachi you do romans 8 23 now for we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear so we don't live in fear like slaves but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father so if you're born again you've already got this spirit of adoption amen and you cry out to god you know god's your father amen so you're growing in that relationship right with how to act around your father how to how to have confidence in your father how to treat your father your girl he's not a stranger he's your father amen amen i'm the children's father i'm around them all the time they know how to approach me when they need something when they want something well i'd say victoria really knows how to cuddle up to with me in the morning and ask me for honey toast she knows how to do that real good she knows how to butter daddy up you know she'll probably ask me tomorrow morning if i got it if i got it i'll do it but see if you've got the spirit of god you're already adopted now the doctrine is not finished but you've got the spirit of it and that's what's most important amen right like brother said by the spirit of uh michelangelo i do art but by the spirit of jesus christ i live like christ amen because i got the spirit of it amen hallelujah now romans 8 23 this says the fullness of adoption comes when we get the glorified all right nice job malcolm see we earlier it says we have the spirit but then it says when we get a new body that's when we are fully adopted all right galatians 4 7 please lydia galatians 4 7. now this whole chapter verses 1 to 7 is about adoption it doesn't say the word adoption but it talks about leaving the law as a slave and coming into grace and now you're adopted by the baptism of the holy ghost so can you read actually literally 6 and roof 697 amen praise god let's say this let's say i'm an heir of god ready i'm an heir of god and if you need something ask the lord from it but be willing to be be happy even if he says no right or would be happy even if he says wait on it brother jess praise god you should be happy make your request because you are sons that's why he gave you the holy ghost you were predestinated to be sons because he foresaw you choose him so he gives you the holy ghost because you are sons and that's what the bible tells us amen you're not a servant you're not a slave you're a heir of god you're a possessor of god's blessings amen and then first john 3 2 brother joseph now are we the son of god and he does not just appear but we know that when he shall appear hey man great job jose i feel like giving him claps i'll give him two claps it's been a while since we've done that for him john said we are beloved we are now everybody say now now we are now the sons of god amen but we'll be totally adopted when we see jesus face to face but now we are the sons of god and now we can ask the father for what we have in need of and we can also be happy if he says no or wait or yes i'll do it right now we can be happy because we have a relationship with god we trust him we love him and we know he loves us amen we're not slaves under the law we're not trying to earn salvation we're already saved we got the spirit of god amen we are his children praise god we are possessing the land in other words if we're born again we're already in the land praise god and if there's a battle there's something we must face we must go up against it remember we won't drive out every day tonight praise god there will be some left on there some troubles we still have but the majority of them we should drive out by the grace of god because that's what joshua did he had a few failures he had a few mistakes but when god looked at his life he done everything god asked him to do when god looked at abraham's life it said he staggered out the promise of god church let's be strong in praise giving god glory because he's our father amen he'll look past your faults he's going to look past those and just say that's my daughter that's my son they confess their sin they moved on they kept possessing the land and they got the purple they got they found my perfect will for every area of their life amen hallelujah so what am i saying i'm saying you're born and you are adopted amen you're adopted you're growing in the adoption but you are god's child and so you must do what the father tells you to do praise god that's what i told my brothers in that little minister's meeting i said i'm an adopted pastor when i speak the word of god god speaks to his people god gives them just what they need right and that's the proof the proof is you're still living on the things of god the proof is you still rejoice in the house of god amen that's the proof of it the proof is that you're still here you're still believing i i haven't preached false doctrine if i made a mistake i'm sure someone would let me know but that's the proof of i'm speaking god's word you're god's children you're receiving god's word you're you're groaning in it and you're thankful for it and you're growing closer to god all the time amen just i'm just trying to show the sims and blessing of it praise god i'm receiving word from god i'm preaching it to you it's feeding your soul you're moving on in god your lives are growing closer to god all the time amen or is your life growing more like the beast system which one is it these churches are either going one way or the other the foolish birds are going to have some things that they're not faithful and they let the cares of the world slipping right that's what jesus said but the bride should be fruitful bringing forth more fruit some 30 some 60 some 100 she's got a good ground she got an honest heart praise god but the bullish person won't have all that don't be fully honest they won't have the fruit of the spirit like a real christian will have that's right church that's that's what i can see in the scripture now let's get just look at a few quotes there's no way i have time to get all these here now brother is praying and count down and he says uh he says uh where can i pick this up i was praying he said thank you for giving us good rest he said lord place us position where we need to be at this hour how many would say that's your prayer too i believe i'm out i believe i'm at where i need to be at this hour pastor fathering teaching i believe i'm right where god wants me to be because i've laid it all before him i said god just do whatever you want my life i want to obey all the word of god for we must be at the right place for it to happen and we want to be lord if it's a housewife behind the table if it's a factory man with a wrench in his hand and a testimony if it's the minister and the pulpit or the deacon or trustee or the child at school see that children raise your hand if you go to school here all right there you go amen the teenager in the discussion at the class how many zoom discussions is lydia malcolm this week you won lydia's got one too so they've got zoom discussions in class whatever it is lord let us be there at the right time amen amen wasn't joshua there at the right time gotta have that mercy 400 years right and then joshua came at the right time same thing for you you'll be at the right time right you for your position in life you'll be there right when god wants you to be there he said for we know you promised it it's going to happen because you said so why it's our faith is built there how do we have faith built in god now this is a different i think this is adoption part four man said that's just my church alone i got a right to or whatever i want to do this is my tabernacle i'm telling you now i believe that people are safe he's talking about denominations yes sir i truly believe it but oh how much more is it to walk when you know where you're walking church that's what makes us different we know where we're walking amen we're walking where the apostles have tried amen hallelujah that's what i feel like when we go to those churches i feel like paul going in those uh synagogues of the jews amen i'm walking there i'm bringing caring the word just waiting for them an opportunity to speak praise god see we know we're walking denominations don't know where they're walking god's going to profit or not they can't even walk in the prophetic right they can't walk into those things they'll well a pastor i'll marry this person a second time i'll marry this person the third time they don't understand their relationships they don't even know where they're walking but the bible says one man one wife until death amen that's just one example see they look at this church isn't this what they do this is what you did before you got the holy ghost you staggered stumbled along but he said let's stand in the light and walk in the light and know which way you're headed the lord be with you and church what what is the light unto your path thy word that's what we've got we've got word amen we've got thus saith the lord on the word of god amen so we can walk the right path where denominations can't they're stumbling and bumbling along they don't have thus they hate the lord on the word so they someone in this doctrine they stumble to that one they just stay in their creed keep someone around never move on in things of god oh i should have i should have heard a few more shots from that one hallelujah right because we are not stumbling along we know where we're walking we know where we're heading amen and if each one of you in here now has not been positioning place you might say well i'm nothing but a housewife well brother brad i've never done a thing in my life i'm not a preacher well maybe god brought you here to raise a family of children out of that family of children may come another family of children that would be a preacher that'll send a million souls to christ you had to be here you're here for a purpose did you know that see wherever you are in the line what is god interested in god is interested in so saved amen and so you may save souls or maybe your children or maybe everybody saves souls you have a plan in this hallelujah the shepherd's going after them he's leaving the 99 to get the one amen remember he said in the parable he sent those three out and he said go out one more time and make sure my house is filled amen your life and your your calling in life is to get more people saved to make sure the house of god is filled that's the greatest thing you can do praise god you're here for a purpose amen what if my mom would have been here we would have three less preachers right think about that what if my mom would not have been here would you not have a pastor in akron right but was her part important she wanted a preacher was her part important oh yeah praise god i think about you buddy what if you weren't here see everybody has such an important role male or female young or old everybody plays a part god is so great he has a purpose for every single person amen they're all practicing his sight praise god and each one's going to play a role in getting people saved for the glory of god well you say all i ever done was harold the cold the old clods or working the field i think out in the evening didn't know how to make my kids a living i looked at the poor little fellows no shoes on i've set and cried i got old buggy and me and molly just went to church he said don't worry brother you just keep loving you loving him he's got a purpose for you so also to his farm and take my wife to church he said don't worry god had a purpose for you just stay right where you are just go on you might not never preach a sermon but you might be the great grandfather of one that will do it amen praise god did you know that god credited now look what he uses glory he says levi so in other words he uses foreknowledge don't worry about you know being like anybody else just be yourself because you are playing a part church in god finishing the temple of god amen filling the heavenly temple the marriage supper you you're doing your part to make sure every seed is filled at that glorious supper amen hallelujah or to fill outside the holy city in the new jerusalem amen praise god one of the other praise god but what does brother adam say he said don't worry about it because levi paid tithes and he's the loins of abraham when melchizedek met him how many knows that see when he was in the loins in the seat of his great-grandfather the bible claimed from kazakh so in other words church don't worry about what you see trust that god has and god knows your life is going to speak through other people's lives amen god knows your life has an importance it's going to make an impact people are watching how you live and all the obedient acts you do now will bless the future generations if they have some amen hallelujah that's what he tells us whether a factory worker housewife preacher whatever you are be faithful in your life be faithful in your position god will use it greatly in the future think about if you ever thought about that when when moses left egypt think about 400 years of all those families that didn't get to go into exodus were those people just wasted lives no they were instilling in the next generation keep praying keep crying out to god keep being faithful and finally the redeemer came amen god needed all those prayers from all 400 years remember i heard all their cries i need each and every one of them then i'm going to send moses down there to pass it on to the next generation and look what kind of faith moses's mom had she's like i won't let the government touch my son i'd rather put him in the hands of god amen that faith was built in generation after generation may god raise our faith amen it's a generation of praying and god is faithful he's gonna answer he's gonna deliver us for so many generations they just talked about it but one day brother it wasn't talk it was science amen hallelujah the rapture may not come in our generation that's fine let's be faithful with it so the next generation if it does come they'll be ready because our lives push them on to higher heights amen glory to god greater depths and greater love of god hallelujah and if i pass on malachi and lydia connotation can stand there with faith i know dad believed him and what he he didn't have the privilege to to to miss death but we may have that privilege and i'm gonna live like he lived amen hey i could i could i'll tell my children now hey if i really wanted more money i could go to a second job i could do that i could go get a second job i'd go start third job i'd have two jobs i forgot about pastor and teacher see but what would that tell my children i would tell my children that the world's more important than them than the word of god i could skip church and say well i got to work instead and you wouldn't have a preacher on wednesday night i could do that see my life is preaching a different message to them amen money's not the most important thing seek ye first the kingdom of god and then everything else gets added unto you praise god that's the lesson they learn to take the land you put god first amen now providence says by foreign knowledge god pre-existed he was self-existent now god he said what's he going to say there's nothing lost knowing that he knows this attribute him would project something out there younger than he could save then when he did that by four hours he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it so before the world made god foresaw all those who accept it he said he said he's and he said to save that the only way i can do it will be become thou myself and be made flesh and take the cinnamon upon him and die from that i might be the one that's worshiped because he's the god the object of worship amen so he saw i i know jesse's going to believe i know william's going to believe i know all those saints in that are going to believe so i'm going to make a way for them to be saved amen and i know i'm the only one that can take all their sins so i'm going to make i'm going to predestinate the events of their lives so they can be saved they can possess the land they can overcome through my grace and they can they can know me in the power of my resurrection and the fellowship of my sufferings then you come down and take it upon himself in christ he said you see what i mean he said he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved that's right do you see what i mean by four knowledge the infinite god know it all they saw the lamb save the land before the foundation or put your name on the look of life and he said your name on there and he said that the antichrist would be so religious so good look at the pope right look at that look at all all these religious people they're so good that's fine such a smart man such a religious man he would deceive the very elected if it was possible but it is an impossible because their names were for ordained before the foundation world by election he chose them by predestination they know where they're going amen see because we're walking in the perfect will of god not the foolish virgin where they don't know where they're going but we are possessing the bible promised land that we should possess because it's given to us without saith the lord now who could doubt that brother graham says who could not death he said because that's what paul said church when we got things paul said we can say the same thing who can doubt that because that's the bible that's jesus christ revelation to paul and paul said if you change it one word you're cursed amen so those tape people that say well the pastor don't have to preach so much you just change one word of it and now you curse because you can't say well he preached less now the bible said more he said go to the world preach the gospel to more amen finish the great commission he never said preach less he said be infinite preach in season and honesties in amen and you think you don't think religious people could see that but some of them can't because they got the wrong spirit he said that's what he tells church that the church posits before the foundation of the world when god in his labor pain was bringing forth you know knowing that you would knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or be that he placed you positionally then he talks about you being filled with the holy ghost how many left the garlic lands of egypt how are you left got in egypt you come through sanitation baptize the promised land amen praise god greet out the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed to the day of your redemption then god having free destiny in the church said and all the peoples there'll be millions times millions that will walk very religious and be deceived the only ones that will not be deceived were those that came over into the promised land who before the foundation world had their names put on the lamb's book of life and has come over into the promised land and church we're enjoying church tonight amen we enjoy the land amen we enjoy conquering we enjoy overcoming we enjoy knowing we've got the saint the lord amen we enjoy knowing we're in the perfect will of god with the perfect revelation of god's word nominations don't care they can preach preach whatever they want but we need more than that we need thus saith the lord let's get past that one man's praying for the people he said fill them with the holy ghost give them eternal life call them out set them in the ministry give them special jobs in the great vineyard of god i don't want a special job i do if it's a little housewife see that special they'll know it's where to put her if it's a man in the office or in the plant you just know where to put him to do the best work see god knew there's something that you can do that's the best job that can be done praise god man on the street on the farm you know just where to put him thou knowest all things in the place positioning where to place him so father we pray that by the works of the holy spirit this night you'll place them in your kingdom many that raise their hands and god saw you when you raise your hand tonight so church what is this what is this all about possessing the spiritual land this is a lesson where to learn joshua is a lesson to learn from the school master of the law we're looking now at the law of joshua right that was right to the law started right moses started the law just a few years after that 38 years after the the law came they win the promised land so we're looking at the law and saying wow if they just obey the law they would possess natural land and that's a lesson for it right it's a great lesson that we're learning now notice church the law was a school master what is the lesson now remember church judah possessed 112 cities but the bible said if you don't obey the land will vomit out the inhabitants remember there was three years of famine in the days of david because of saul's bloody ways so because he didn't live right in the natural land the land suffered and the people suffered immature character in the land led much suffering and church this grieved the heart of god it greeted the heart of god to see that he brought his people in here and they turn their backs on right after joshua dies they go make idols it green god to have to send judge after judge because they just backside right after the the last judge died and god finally got sped up with it and he kicked him out of the land see the the lesson was they had immature character god was showing immature character will not treat the land the promises of god the right way amen david sinned in the land and the sword never left his house or the land well he had uh bathsheba and then slew uriah he never recovered after that see it was a lesson for us we need more than just supernatural thank god for supernatural david had supernatural he had dance and he had shout he had all these things but he needed something more than that he needed an anchor amen so when the temptation come he would still keep the word of god instead of despising the word of god he needed an anchor to obey the word of god but because he didn't have that anchor he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost he and his family and the land suffer the lesson is immaturity with great things doesn't get you very far he bloodied his own house and bloodied the land it never left his house children killing children step children killing other children never left this house so what's the lesson satan pulls one of these old testament tricks he said bow down now and i'll give you all these kingdoms he tries to pull on these old
