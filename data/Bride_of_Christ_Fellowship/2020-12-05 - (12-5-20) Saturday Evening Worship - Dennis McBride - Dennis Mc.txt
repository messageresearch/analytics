people lord that were living yesterday they're not alive today so being that we're still here that means there's a purpose in it lord we pray that you would help us just to humble ourselves with each passing day father so that your eternal purpose may be fulfilled in our lives and we realize in our hearts by the understanding that you've been giving to us lord god that nothing can stop that purpose whatever you've purposed to do within any life father god is going to be accomplished because your word can't faint so god we thank you for that lord thank you for revealing yourself to us it's such a comfort in this time with everything going the way that it is all around us lord one of the most dangerous times that the earth has ever had but yet by your grace lord god we're being kept you're keeping us in our right minds father god you're keeping us in your grace you're keeping us in your truth it's all about your mighty hand it's nothing that we can do for ourselves it's only you lord god that's keeping us being that we realize that father we look to you for everything father we commit ourselves to [Music] we thank you for granting us travel and mercies to be able to come and be with your portion of your bride that's here inaccurate father it's been a long time lord god but you have times and seasons that you do things father as we go about our lives on a day-to-day basis lord we don't know what's on tomorrow but lord the only thing that we can do is embrace the day that we're living in lord and just pray and ask that your will be done and that's what we're asking right now father that your will be done i come with no selfish motives and objectives lord i just want to be used and be over help by your grace so lord again thank you for every soul that's here may you help your people father god every child every adult lord you know how to minister to your people you are a father please lord you see us lord god you know all about us lord we know exactly what we need god my family lord you're watching over them right now i've already prayed father god i trust in you give everything to me thank you for my family will bless them keep them straight in the lord by your grace lord abroad around the world we're into different time zones and different places lord but lord everybody's within your sight you're watching every movement lord you're controlling everything god we love you bless your word tonight lord let it be understood i pray father even amongst the children may something be said father that a lord be able to anchor within their souls you're able to do that father you're able to take this word father and bring it down to their levels and give their little hearts understanding and strength you are the almighty god we ask you all these things father in your name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen praise the lord amen sister wendy god bless you sister amen he called their name adam so i call you sister jesse praise the lord it's good to see you sister it's been a while and when i actually admit i told brother jesse i missed you we were actually in the same service and i saw you but i didn't get a chance to greet you on that night and it had been years before since i saw you and you you went somewhere i went somewhere i was like man i ain't even get a chance to speak to sister women amen it's good to see you sister thank god for brother amen that's right right amen brother jesse said brother amen he's a wonderful brother or you know song conduct i said did he say amen and i didn't get a chance to ask him again but in the room i was like what a name praise the lord amen you hear your name all the time in church praise the lord amen brother bang good to see you my brother man you got a family and everything god bless you sister god bless you amen the last time i he was in route to go and capture his wife amen so everything has come full circle that was the will of the lord so hey man it's good to see all of you and then man brother jesse's family all of your children it's a wonderful family man just watching the children seeing how they are just seeing the blessing of god on their lives man that's a blessing i'm not just saying that it's just you can see that the influence of god so yeah amen they'll realize the benefits of it when they get older and the lord deal with their hearts amen and they won't be able to thank their parents enough amen all right i don't want to keep you standing long uh children don't uh i get excited sometimes my voice may raise some don't get afraid hey man just uh just notice brother mcbride just expressing himself brother jesse you know us sometimes the anointing of god is kind of flows in a certain way and you just kind of get lost you know you don't mean to you know kind of strongly emphasize certain things but it's just like you want it to be out of your control and then sometimes when it's going on it's like man excuse me i didn't mean that but then you get right back into it again amen so we just want god to have his way tonight amen so uh let's not keep you standing much longer here let's let's turn to psalms chapter 20. i really don't know how it's going to go this particular subject here this is my first time ministering on this subject but it was something that's been on my heart for a little while now so we just look to god to bring it out in whatever way he sees fit yes sir so psalms 20. i want to start in verse 6. it says now now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand it says some some trust in chariots and some in horses we will remember the name of the lord our god they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright save lord let the king hear us when we call amen amen let's pray heavenly father lord please help us we ask this in jesus christ's holy and precious name amen praise the lord all right so now is it okay thank you that's convenient okay so um i want to take my time tonight but i don't want to i don't want to keep you terribly long because i know we have service tomorrow morning and but at the same time i don't want to get in god's way um this opening scripture here i'm going to kind of take some turns as we walk through this particular subject but i want to go to verse 7 again of chapter 20 of psalms it says some trust in chariots and some in horses and i want to emphasize that all right because as with all of the scripture you know this is actually god expressing himself through his servant okay so it's not this is not just a man's words it's actually god himself and he's expressing himself right and he's expressing what he sees amongst mankind the different influences and the mindsets and things that nature man so it's the holy spirit just kind of slows you down sometimes and draws your attention to something because it's something that he wants to express so in this part of the scripture he says some trust in chariots and some in horses that's a true statement even today you know people uh people trust in many different things many people trust in the wrong things hey amen and i want to kind of bring that as a focus tonight because in verse 8 it says in this paul verse 8 it says they are brought down and fall there's a consequence when you place your trust in the wrong thing okay so there's a lot going on in the world today uh and there's a lot going on around what god is doing in this hour so as a subject tonight i want to deal with a false sense of security a false sense of security praise god as i was meditating on this particular subject uh it's a lot beginning to come to me because how satan operates this is the thing that he always tries to bring about within anyone that he's trying to pull to his side he tries to give them a false sense of security amen and as an example of that let's go to genesis chapter 3. i have a lot of content here i'm just looking for the leading of the lord on which direction to go so i'm not even going to try to get through all of it i just want to go and stop however he leads me so in genesis chapter 3 starting at verse 4. watch this now i'm talking about a false sense of security it says in verse 4 of genesis chapter 3 it says and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now god obviously said you will die if you eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil correct amen it was communicated to her because she in turn told satan those exact things right but now notice how satan comes in and within her and he tries to lessen the he tries to take her mind and water down the consequences of yielding to what it is he was trying to impress upon her we understand that right he came in and his objective was in her mind to make her feel comforted and secure and by passing the word of god and yielding and accepting and partaking in what he was offering to her watch because his first word says ye shall not surely die so now that's the consequence that's the thing that hey i can't do this because this will be what happens to me and how many i'm listen sin would not be prevalent within the world today if people did not yield to this very same mindset any sin the enemy has to first convince the individual that there is no consequence or it won't be as bad as you think because when a person feels like that they feel a little more at ease yielding themselves to things that are not right see so he first comes to the mind just like the prophet taught us that's what the greatest battle ever thought is right and in that mind he reasons this is the purpose of the reasoning is to cause the person no matter who they are to yield to feel like oh it's okay if i go ahead and do this there's nothing's gonna happen watch verse 5 says for god doth noted in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food notice it had already happened this verse right here shows something saints at the reception right and at the reception and the acceptance of satan's reasonings she opened up her mind and she accepted she considered a prophet told us all you have to do is stop for a moment i need to remember nelly sanders yes yes sir the enemy knew remember we've been taught that satan studies us we weren't always saints of god worshiping god singing praises to god trying to yield ourselves to him and die to the things that we won't always like that we had our past lives how many realized satan was there those demon powers were there from the beginning right so everything that we've ever done they they were the ones that made us do it right amen we yielded ourselves to evil spirits and it caused us to live lives contrary to god's word so satan studies us and many times look the issues that we deal with the spiritual issues many times they are repeat issues because he knew if i got you on at one time more than likely i can get you with the same thing again amen so here it is now when you open up your reasonings when you open up your understanding when you when you consider or receive what satan is bringing to your mind a spirit comes in right then satan hadn't touched her right but all of a sudden in verse six what happened since now you see her thoughts beginning to change when nellie sanders stopped for a moment the devil knew she loved that music she loved to dance so when he saw her coming up the road when she turned on that road he had the dj to put on a song that would draw her because he knew her past he knew how to hook her you understand and as she continued to walk up she should never have come up that road when god delivers us from anything since the best thing for us to do is stay as far away from it as we can don't even go by don't touch it don't flip that channel no way near it don't turn that radio station nowhere near it don't go nowhere near that location where you know these things are that were enticing to your spirit she traveled up that road satan had a strategy now she got by the club that song was playing she was outside on the road and she stopped for a moment brother branham said as soon as she she was in the same position that eve is in right here she stopped for a moment and she listened to the music and right then that spirit came inside of her because she went from the road to the stairs and from the stairs to the dance floor how that devil was on the inside of her now leading her good eve just listened he hadn't touched her it was just the it was the grasp of his words that ended on the inside now she had received the spirit of the devil now her mind her thoughts are perceived now what was bad she began to see as being good that's the only way a person can sin that's right right satan has to be able to come in and people don't realize the power of words and what you see certain things ain't even worth listening to yes sir it's not because you're dealing with demons things you can't see listen when the devil enters inside of a person you don't feel nothing in your flesh right you can't you can't detect it like that right but yet it's there the woman when nelly shannon came to herself by the grace of god she ran to brother branham's house opened up the door brother branham prayed for and that bat like spirit came up out of her where did it come in that right on that road when she listened to that music yes sir if eve could see what was going on she would immediately have cut it off but somehow she was blind to be able to see what was happening and we understand god had a great plan that he was unfolding but we're just analyzing this part for the sake of discernment i'm talking about a false sense of security the devil made her watch verse six and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to make and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat without fear how did she get to this point saints it was through reasoning power [Music] and the reception of the spirit satan's tactics and the first thing you did is made her feel relieved and okay with the devil's knowledge yielding to his actions and the bible says on she took and ate the fruit thereof and did even gave also onto her husband with her and he did it adam willfully saying the scripture lets us know and it's for reasons that only god could bring out in these last days through his prophet he loved his wife and all of it was a plan it was speaking of greater things to come it was a love story praise the lord but nonetheless though he made her feel secure that it was okay to go ahead and partake in that but look at how he did it he just walked he worked with her in her thoughts when you talk about a a false sense of security there's an actual definition that goes along with that that i looked up to my surprise and what it means is this change when you look up a false sense of security it says this to have the illusion of safety and security in a situation that actually poses risk or danger it makes a person feel safe when really there is no safety it's danger but they feel secure they feel confident they feel all right they feel protected wouldn't satan want people to feel that way because see he's the master of illusion you see he wants as many people to follow him as possible so if he can get you to follow him without realizing that's what you're doing he's successful that's how that's why the world is in the conditioning it is today people have have taken on a false sense of security and they think they're all right why don't you come to church see you know god is able to help you bless you sir ah i'm okay i got to work and you know you know uh god is in my heart and you know uh you know we got to go to church churches everywhere the church is in my home all these reasonings and examples that the devil gives to individuals that they don't even realize is coming from a devil that's one thing saying i'm not we're not exempt from this when evil spirits are dealing with us it's not that we're seeing these spirits and we oh that's the devil and whatever whatever many times it's after we've been used and god brings it to our attention and he then leads us to repent many times evil spirits come and we don't realize it and we're operating under a bad anointing a wrong spirit and the holy ghost has to stop us and make us realize hold on do you realize what spirit you are of those two brothers they were just trying to help christ coming from a place and christ was being rejected and they said should we call down fire upon them i believe it was james and john shall we call down fire upon him from heaven as as elijah did and christ was the one that was being persecuted and rejected and he turned and looked at them and said you don't know what spirit you are those two men trying to stand for the word didn't realize they had become anointed by a devil you see how this thing operates without the holy ghost saints wing we ain't got no chance if god don't come and help us we don't know we can't we can't help ourselves keep ourselves we'll be all messed up it's only by the grace of god as me and brother jesse was fellowshipping on last night we touched upon that one part where peter just you're just trying to be over help because he loved christ but he was in a carnal frame of mind that was controlled in many ways by satan here he is telling the lord lord you don't have to go up and die like that and all these things happen to you and whatever no lord forbid from that to happen to you and jesus turned around because he was god he realized that voice something ain't right and he looked at peter he said get thee behind me satan but when you read peter's words none of us would have ever detected that that was the devil because of what he was saying it sounded like the loving words of a friend but yet it was satan himself trying to prevent the word from coming to pass but jesus being who he is he looked ratted and called it right out get me behind me satan so a false sense of security is is to have the illusion all right so now what does illusion mean all right it's following me here i'm just trying to lay a foundation all right because these are things that we deal with in everyday life like i said we're not exempt from it an illusion is a thing that is or like or or is likely to be wrongly perceived or interpreted by the senses it's a deceptive appearance or impression a false idea or belief for satan likes to create illusions within people's spirits in their minds to cause them to feel okay with accepting something that's contrary to god's word now notice this i want to touch upon this real quickly here because this struck me as i read it saints all right we want to go to uh lord have mercy let's go to romans chapter 10 and verse 13. this is a bible truth here but i want to show you express to you how it was that the lord showed it to me on this day romans 10 starting at verse 13. or rather we're just going to read verse 13. watch what it says here now it says in verse 13 of romans 10 4 whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved can we say amen to that that's right amen amen praise the lord the bible says that whosoever call upon the name of the lord shall be saved there are many people that proclaim christianity that read that scripture and believe it as we do but it's a twist to it now let's go by the grace of god to matthew chapter 7. remember that now romans 10 and 13 amen those that call whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall shall be said can we say shell they don't say maybe willy they don't say they don't say mighty say shell that's sure but watch this matthew amen matthew chapter what did i say matthew chapter 7 i want to start at verse 15 it says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but intimately they are ravening wolves it says ye say i'm sorry ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs and thistles it says even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but the but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit it says a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire now notice in verse 20 remember now in romans 10 and 13 whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved but notice what it says in verse 20 i mean verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven so they were calling upon the name of the lord y'all see that right jesus speaking himself the same one that spoke romans 10 13 is now speaking him in matthew 7 and he said all that said unto me lord lord shall not watch this amen but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven watch so you have to have something something that accompanies you saying lord lord you have to have something else that accompanies your calling upon the name of the lord you just can't call upon the name of the lord and say what the bible says whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved no sir your life got to be worthy of the gospel you have to have a life that accompanies that matches your confession if you calling him lord i mean he's your ruler that means he controls your life isn't that the right sense watch this though not everyone that said unto me lord lost an enemy to the kingdom of heaven but he do do with the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name watch this i'm talking about a false sense of security look at the reasons that they begin to present forth to the lord yeah you called upon his name amen and look he anointed you he said look they said haven't we prophesied in your name he didn't deny it yes you prophesied in my name praise the lord and in thy name have cast out devils in whose name in christ's name and in thy name done many many wonderful works they were people that had testimonies people that would stand up in meetings amen and give testimony of the power of god and what he did in their lives things that people sit back and look at and say oh my praise god that's a holy man of god it might even be a sister that gets up and give a testimony of something god did amen right but look i'm talking about a false sense of security many people feel as though because god moved at a certain time in a certain way that that testifies over some sort of seal that they're okay all around to the end when they know full well their lives don't match that word lord have mercy see i told you guys i get excited but look you see you see this yes how you see they they prophesied they cast out devils many wonderful works were done operated in gifts and everything and the devil made them take that as a security and a sign that they were all right with god he said depart from me i never knew you how did they feel otherwise what made them believe otherwise it was the same tricks of the devil that he used on eve came to their minds through reasoning and twisted things up in such a way and it made them feel all right yeah i know my life ain't right here and there but look at how the lord is moving i believe i'm his child see and they and they were able to carry on in that way trusting in what trusting in how they saw the lord move in their lives but yet they didn't align themselves with the word that's what anointed ones in the end time was all about yes god being able to rain down his blessings powers and gifts and everything upon a people brother branham said those two men spoke in tongues under the same anointing that's right but then god let him take a little closer look he wanted to shake their hand and look in their eyes and talk to him a little bit and all of a sudden the holy ghost began to reveal this man is a true christian but this man right here he got two different women in his life but operating under the same power calling upon the name of the lord felt secure was in a service feeling comforted do you see the devil will always do that somehow or another he'll make you feel like you're an exception of some kind somehow like you're special or something like you ain't got to fully line up with the word you ain't got to throw it up and that way let it cause a person to let down and and feel okay with going to church operating in a gift and then going home and doing things that they know they shouldn't be doing that same god that spoke to you there warns you in your heart not to do that no more and you ignore him i don't know why i'm saying these things in this way but per adventure might be somebody you know the lord knows yes but you under you see you see what i'm saying that's how the devil operates he makes people feel okay he he lessens the he he lessens in their minds he lessens the consequence upon themselves and notice this is something also i noticed in ecclesiastes saints ecclesiastes chapter eight [Music] ecclesiastes chapter eight starting at well just one verse we're actually starting at verse eleven ecclesiastes eight in verse eleven it says how many guys say amen always up there all right praise the lord because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil because when you do wrong nothing happens right away and the more look like brother branham told us god made every man with that sense within him you know right from wrong but what happens is the devil through his reasonings cause people to feel secure it in that i'm gonna say it like this in his decision because it's not theirs they yield themselves to the devil's mind and then they begin to walk according to his will right right and as they go to walk according to his will to get into it or do whatever it is that it is you got to bypass that first time i was listening to the prophet recently and he was saying how a mother might come into a child and that child might have been smoking and the mother might ask the child child have you been smoking he says now in your heart immediately that little buzzer goes over and said don't you lie little child he said but immediately the devil comes in and he begins to make that child try to cover it up to try to shun judgment for that time he don't want to get spanked or chastised or whatever the case might be so the devil leads that child to try to cover up the smell of the cigarette in their mouths and then tell the mother no i wasn't smoking mama he said the next time it's easier for that child to do it again once you bypass it that's how it operates the devil now causes you to feel secure because you did it and you were able to get away with it see anything happen and the devil can't say see you all right but didn't you enjoy that you can go and do it again and he tries to make them more deceptive with it cover up their tracks more so that's exactly what happens lord have mercy i'm gonna make a statement that's not popular but yet i there's many things that exist within the bride right that's why we ain't gone yet god's working with each one of us yes sir these besetting sins these wastes that hold us down and hold us back keeps us from thriving and really progressing and moving forward in the things of god all right but him being our father see he loves us and the devil calls is that the mesa be misinterpreted god begins to bring correctional chastise and people get upset with the word and the minister knowing full well that's in your life why are you getting upset with me i ain't the one doing the wrong i ain't know nothing about your life but the devil want to blind them to be able to recognize god in their midst cause him not to be able to see the love of god yes there's things i've had to deal with in my own home with my children as they were coming up it's one thing i tried to make sure i emphasized and i said now why do you think the lord allowed this to be found out about you realizing because he loved you it's his grace to you because he sees the enemy had a grip and he came to loose you but in that little mind it can't grab certain things at that time so they hear you but they don't hear you you understand what i'm saying but this is how the devil operates saints so when you have a false sense of security the devil creates an illusion that you're okay when you're not okay the things we just read are not saints the people we just read about that christ gave the example of in matthew 7 they operated by the power of god in many different things but the devil calls them to misinterpret what was really going on because now even though they had things in their lives that wasn't right he made them feel like they were still okay god still loves you and he does but he hates the sins and the bible is true when it says that no adulterer no whoremonger and all these things you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven that's right the devil will never emphasize that he'll make it seem he'll make you not even people throw those scriptures away all day long for the sake of feeling okay and comforted and not feeling the conviction of the word anytime they hear anything that's pertaining to that when they know they're wrong in their lives they want to say you're judging me no i'm not judging you that's just a discernment of the holy ghost coming to help you in your life right now i'm not judging you but at the same time you are being judged jesus said i don't judge you he said you have one that judge you even the word that i speak unto you they shall judge you in that day that's right like we were talking about last night brother the voice of many waters what people don't realize it's christ and his bride walking around and like we were talking about brother people that that just are so normal and average and whatever people look right over the living word do you realize that's how christ was the bible says he had no beauty that we should desire him he walked past people all day long in the markets they bumped into the lord jesus christ god himself and didn't even realize it okay when you're dealing with the word trust because the bible says some trusting chariots some in horses that means that's where their confidence was the word trust means firm belief in the in the reliability truth ability or strength of someone or something the bible says some trusting horses summon chariots they relied upon it amen yes it was uh they had confidence in the ability of it so now what satan does saints as he comes and he tries to remove our confidence off of the word of god and place our confidence onto his word can we say amen to that amen he tries to remove our confidence off of the word of god and place our confidence in his word this is the reason why we have so many things that are taking place right now in regards to the falling away from the word how many realize that has to happen amen except they're coming falling away first but how does that falling away take place it's exactly what i'm talking about right now the devil comes in and he begins to reason with a person's mind and he begins to minister his gospel how many understand that yes sin begins to minister his gospel and his interpretation that he wants us to receive praise the lord amen and at the reception of that word it causes people to put down the word of god and to turn to error praise the lord all right to turn to actual error saints let me read to you this right here turn me to chronicle second chronicles chapter 26. second chronicles chapter 26 starting at verse 16. it says but when he was when he was strong talking about isaiah when he was strong his heart was lifted up in his destruct to his destruction notice that now because when you have a false sense of security there's one thing that that several things that that come along with that right and this is one of them right here in order for you to begin to walk away from the word of god or take a stand against the word of god first you have to you have to first be lifted up in your own heart now how many realize that's that's a characteristic of satan that's what happened in heaven first before all these things took place upon the earth he had a thought it dominated him it consumed him he wanted to be like god right yeah so he wasn't able to accept god's program the way that it was he wanted to be more than what he was made for isn't that something yes and one thing that happened to him in his heart he became lifted up he began to think more of himself than what he actually was now right here this happened to isaiah and the bible says it plainly it says his heart was lifted up to his destruction satan's heart was lifted up to his casting out from heaven as well his destruction is coming right but when his heart was lifted up he got cast out of heaven because god he don't play with that it goes on to say for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord and to burn incense upon the altar of incense and as a writer the heart the priests went in after him and with and with him four score priests of the lord that were valiant men it says and they withstood as i the king and said unto him it appertained of not unto theesiah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests of the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thy honor from the lord god but notice aziah had another spirit on him there was something that happened in the unseen realm that assad didn't even he didn't even realize what was going on with him himself he didn't realize he was being anointed of a devil but now he rushes into the temple of god to try to do a service to god that wasn't ordained for him to do god already had an order that was already in place he was well acquainted with it but because he was anointed by that spirit the devil gave him a false sense of security i don't care listen you're the king you can do anything you want to do if you what what think about it what sense did it make why was he so fixed on having to go burn incense what was the big deal with that you know the devil all he wants us to do all day long is go contrary to god's word somehow nice right this was just the way in which god knew that he would fall by then it didn't make no sense king you the king what why you want to go burn incense and offer that seemingly small thing look at what happened to him praise the lord it says in verse 19 then isaiah was rough and had a sensor in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priest the leprosy even rolls up in his forehead before the priest in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar you see that the devil made him feel comforted and okay made him not even think about the consequence don't let that marinate a little bit yeah the devil in his mind reasoned with him i wish the bible would have somehow let that be like written this was a conversation satan had with his eye then we would have known the faults but we can see by his actions that it had to be in this line now he's been persuaded now he's in action now he's fixed on doing what he feels to do go contrary to the word of god and stand to be argumentative with the priest the men that god ordained it had the anointing of god upon him and was standing by the spirit of the lord trying to stop him from destroying himself how many people are doing that in this hour the same spirit of god here in his bride trying to keep people from going forward any father you're going forward to your own destruction and god's ministry is healed to us by his spirit cried out and what the they're getting wrong they're getting upset as isaiah did and as soon as he got upset the bible said the leprosy began to form right there in his forehead his fall had began yes right there yes it was a trick of the devil that he fell for i don't know what his thoughts were at that time but you can only imagine from that point his decline was rapid yes he was done yeah yes see he he he he immediately was taken out physically but whenever somebody takes a stand against god in this hour against god's truth this same thing happened but in a spiritual sense yes they begin to go down they begin to die spiritually because they were fighting against the lord and his christ the grace of god trying to help trying to stop please don't do that you're going wrong you're going the wrong way that's not of me verse 20 and as a ride a chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leperous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence it says yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him and isaiah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the king's house judging the people of the lord i mean judging the people of the land but branham says this here in a message called influence he says now we find out when you get lifted up right then you're on your road down see when you lift yourself up as we work through this particular subject that's a common thing i kept seeing is self proclamations yes i mean hope okay thessalonians chapter five starting at verse one it says but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the lord that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say notice who's saying it now it's a false sense of security for when they shall say peace and safety what made them say that the bible says it was them but it was a devil it wasn't god giving them that assurance it was a devil giving them that assurance like it gave me eve you shall not surely die it's peace and safety you can do however you want to do and whatever you want to do you can push your own agenda to whatever degree and limit all is well you're okay sudden destruction is not coming to you see you made that decision you did that and look you you're just fine listen to this now a person might make a decision that's contrary to the word and choose a lifestyle and an avenue to go by that's contrary that's wrong obviously but they can still go about their live streams and actually seemingly be blessed their job status might get better their income might get better whatever the case might be if they're a minister they might gain a large following huh and they might take that as signs of being the blessings of god it says when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape so with a woman getting ready to have a child right unless it's a uh already scheduled c-section right nobody knows the minute the second or the hour that child is gonna actually come out i have five the doctors actually thought they knew what they were doing because of their past experience they came my wife came in oh you're okay you're not but uh so many centimeters or whatever you you know we got time you can send us home and as soon as we got home and i pulled in my driveway my wife water broke she was in the house telling me the baby was coming i said now why that doctor told us to go home he the doctor i was supposed to be able to trust in him right he's supposed to know what he doing my wife said a baby coming i said no it hang i said that's why i said no it's not they don't come with me in the house by myself we got to get to the hospital i'll be unfainted police saw i called 9-1-1 and i remember when i called 9-1-1 they gonna charge me extra money so i hung the phone up i want the ambulance to come they gonna charge me more money but because i dialed 9-1-1 they traced the call and they were knocking at my door and i was trying to get my wife to the car he said somebody called 9-1-1 i said yes sir it was me my wife having a baby he said come on got in the car he counted his lights he followed him she had the baby baby 10 minutes later now that doc that i thought you knew what you was talking about man you almost put me in a bind that see that man has limitations they think they know when they don't know we are so prone and subject to error we don't know nothing the bible says that right when a person thinks they know anything they don't know nothing as they ought to as of yet that's true that's bible when they shall say peace and safety watch they just said peace and safety but the bible says sudden destruction comes right i thought it was peace and safety what gave you that illusion what made you think everything was alright and that you could say it was peace and safety that wasn't the lord's word see they didn't realize they were in danger how many understand now watch this this is what the prophet goes on to say about this and isaiah ought to have taken that heed the warning of the priest now remember we call on him or we call him watch how he says this now talking about isaiah he says remember now he says we call him today a christian that god has blessed josiah was a blessed man god blessed his kingdom he blessed all of his efforts he had a thriving kingdom under his rule he saw a hand of god in many ways satisfying and increasing him in all sorts of things but because he saw god blessing him in such a way he began to feel secure that he was all right that he was above the word of god how many people fall for that same trap just because god did so many things and you got so many tests who cares you got to go along with god all the way into the end humbly submissively when a person has a false sense of security what comes along with that also is arrogance because the devil has convinced them that you're okay and that you're right and they go forth boldly to do whatever it is in their heart to do that was put in there by satan they're carrying out as christ said to the pharisees you of your father the devil and his lusts ye do so satan has lusts and people carry those lusts out as they yield to him so when you see a person that's lusting after the wrong things of the world that's not them they don't realize that though that's evil spirits controlling them from the inside pushing them driving them and again they only get to that place when they're able to feel like there's nothing that's going to happen to them somehow they're special god and them got a special relationship and and and everything gonna be all the rights you know i'm like the thief on the cross sees he was there and the lord took him right in ci you don't know how god gonna do so don't judge me isn't that something watch he was a man that was blessed by god but he did not want to stand correction how many realize the bible says as many as the lord loves he chastens them amen yazar didn't know that was the love of god coming to him through the priests he was just so fixed on having his own way and doing his own thing the devil blinded him from what was really happening if he would have just stopped and said you know what you're absolutely right i'm out of order this i'm the king but i ain't a priest god didn't ordain me to do that watch how he goes on to say this no matter how much the word said it what it was so he didn't want to understand that again with all the false doctrines and things that are breaking out all around the message now this is the exact thing that's happening they don't want to hear what the word really has to say they reason against it they shut it down they call it not of god and all of that he says this is again the message of influence it's in 1963 november the 11th this is part b it says watch this now and that's what's the matter with our peoples around the world today today around the world that they think that god will let them get by with something contrary to his word he'll never do it we must come back to correction and stand correction by the word and because of his arrogance talking about isaiah and because of his arrogance his arrogant way of acting he says he paid no attention to what this minister had to say he would do what he wanted to do just think now just stop in that mind just stop in in your mind a minute on that point he says how can a child now listen how he says this now how can a child face a father and mother that's godly how could a teenager look in the face of a godly old mother with her hair turning grave and say to this teenager honey mother has raised you different and you see back down through life what's done was done for mother meaning how god dealt with her and helped her and blessed her right all right he says don't do that and turn and not talking about the child and turn arrogant the child and turn arrogant and say take your religion and go i'll do what i want to do how many young people have i seen as they come up and as they reach certain ages the devil gets in their minds and makes them feel so secure in their thoughts they got it all figured out but you ain't went nowhere and did nothing yet you understand the whole world and how everything goes together nobody can't tell you got it i know i know i know i got it i know i'm gonna be all right all i need to do is reach 18 you'll see i got it all together i got a plan everything already waiting for me just just stand back and watch mom and daddy i'm gonna show you something not realizing god as with those priests to isaiah god is in those parents trying to guide and direct that child in the right way away from death and destruction and into the ways of life and peace and comfort in the true sense of the word amen but he reached those ages and the devil get in that mind that unconverted mind and somehow he begins to work with those thoughts and they just think they got everything together they don't want to hear nothing from nobody that's not in line with what they want to do already not knowing what's giving you those thoughts to want to do that in that way god will have you be obedient to your parents just to show you trying to rub against the grain shows it's evidence what kind of the spirit that is as i didn't know that was a devil on him it just made him want to go contrary and brother branham is bringing this example out saying that teenage daughter tell their mother take your religion and go out do what i want to do didn't brother branham's own daughter go through that phase right disobedient showing herself trying to find herself but at the same time being deceived about the thing there and caused her to do all kind of things that was hurtful to her parents and then yet in that way in that time and that in that same situation god came down through his prophet and said now even though she's acting like that this is how we need to handle her she needs a friend right now so you can't respond and allow yourself to get into your feelings you gotta humble yourself and yield yourself to god and allow god to work through you because this is how he's going to combat the devil not coming with all kind of strong words and things of that nature but this is how god is going to work against the devil you become her friend you be a friend to her because if she don't get it in you the double gonna give her a friend somewhere else and hot boy i mean i'm a dad now i got some children there now i don't know what it is about children they somehow trust in other children young adults trusting other young adults over their parents this young adult ain't got a job they ain't been no way in life ain't experiencing them but somehow they got wisdom that excels their parents in the eyes of that child that's the truth and it's the wrong influence why the devil the devil has made them feel secure through the words of someone else and it causes them to work against the very words of god that he's speaking through the ones that actually love them want the best for them amen he says what's the outcome of that teenager what happens to them it's gone they're lost spiritually morally many times physically and mentally they are completely cut off from mercy he says well then that would be a horrible thing for a teenage boy or girl watch how he says these saints then think about a man or a woman down in the ministry or a christian that calls himself a child of god and look into the commandments of god and turn their back and say my denomination don't believe it like that by their proclamation they're stating where their confidence is where their trust is they're relying upon they got confidence in what my church teaches now when it's the truth that's right but what's truth everybody says they have truth but there's only one truth and those that are fortunate by the grace of god to be a part of that they really have it they say they have it and they really have it the other ones say they have it and they don't have it at all they have a false sense of security is what they have yes they can look into the word and see things that are not right that don't line up but instead of them lining up with the word they try to make the word conform to their belief and they begin to twist the word in all kinds of ways every denomination has some truth in it every false doctrine that surrounds this message has some truth in it but it's the part they get off on that's the part that produces death so they can say many things right but it's the part that's wrong that's the danger praise the lord lord have mercy on the saints he says but isaiah didn't want to do that after god had blessed him the way that he had and yet he didn't feel like like that he could that he would do that he didn't think god would do him like that it says he thought he was going he was going to go on do it anyhow because he felt he was secure but while he was it kind of it kind of made him feel angry at those men too that was telling him the word of the lord and when he did he rushed in anyhow and we find out that in his face come leprosy and he was a level until he died he had never he that he he had never could go to the house of the lord anymore no more he died a leper after he had seen the hand of god and how he had been so good to him and done the things he had yet that man died isolated a leper now weak he says now can we do that we've seen many things but don't you never think that we're so secure that god can't put judgment upon us but when you're under an illusion you're deceived isn't that right and when you're deceived this means deception means something that deceives or misleads intellectually whenever somebody gets off of the word of god they're being deceived or led astray intellectually in the mind satan working with those thoughts amen he studies the message how many realize satan is a scholar of the message how many realize that yes he just don't come in in many cases and just says something that's totally off the wall to some he does but to me he don't he'll he'll come right into the message as he did and he'll learn the lingo amen and then he begins to put together things in his own twists and turns amen this little dot the bible says doctrines of devils using the word of god using the message of god twist it up in his own way and hand it off to somebody that's willing to stop for a moment and entertain it first it comes in as a thought then it becomes a word then it becomes a doctrine then it becomes a movement what is it saints the tears are being bundled when god was in heaven saying do you realize he knew every movement of the devil he saw every he heard every conversation he had with every angel and he remained on his throne the devil was not far away talking to the angels he had them gathering together speaking against the lord amen him contrary to the program of god and god was sitting right on his throne heard every single word and didn't move you want to know why it had to happen you don't think god hear the conversations of the many that are out there that turn against his word even those that are still amongst the message churches that hadn't left yet but they're having conversations about it god knows about any bit of it and he sits and he he's allowing every bit of it to happen every angel that came that third part every one of them had to come out every one of them had to fall god was there in the garden of eden eve had to fall he could have stopped it why didn't he something had to play all the way out god allowed certain things to come in to capture the minds of men in certain ways like i said to bundle them together nathan and corey had the riser after the fact amen god saw he he saw the renown he saw them congregating together going around gaining influence and popularity amongst the people waited until they had more influence and waited until their influence came to a climax and everybody that was caught up in the men amen the devil came in and made them feel secure a false sense of security to rise up against god's prophet isn't that right to their own destruction they thought they had something but that evil spirit moved amongst that whole group and all of them came with a dark cloud over them in a spirit room and none of them could see the darkness they thought they were walking in the light that's right state of their case you ain't the only holy one god speaks to all of us moses said i never said i was the only one i know god deal with his people but because you're coming to me and the way you coming to me let's let's have this thing prove let's let let's let god judge this case let me know what showdown is coming right now people are saying all sorts of things boastfully under a false sense of security deceived when that leprosy rose up in his eyes forehead oh it took all the air to that brother his arrogance was gone he was like a little child here come paul galloping down to go and try to gather up more christians and persecute him and whatever when that light knocked him down he was like a feeble person amen no more strength than that brother no more strong words scrounging around for help i've been blinded yes y'all had to knock the confidence out of that's the that that won't be the case with they'll go right on that showdown going to come yes hey man that showdown at mount zion all right hey man it ain't gonna be it's not gonna be like god like like i told you so so it's just gonna be god manifesting his word in the way that he choose he chooses to and it's gonna be a final witness to those that god purposely see it then it'll be wrapped up right to be gone but right now god is letting everything take its course everything that's moving right now supposed to move in the exact way that is moving the devil has to come in and make people feel secure in their falseness in their sin in their in their deception because when that time comes that he that is filthy be filthy still let him that is righteous to be righteous still it'll be a wrap and we're approaching that time now i thank god thanks for helping us in the way that he has yes to help our eyes to be open how many how many are grateful for that amen allowing us not to be amongst the deceived number and that's because of predestination it's because of who you always were i had to come you had to come we came from different parts of the world different walks of life but yet we were always a part of the same body we were always kin folk amen amen we're just now coming to realize who our real brothers and sisters are it's not the blood brother or sister it's the body of christ the mystical body of christ me and brother jesse as he said i don't know he said it's been seven years it's been quite some time since i've been here i remember the idiot she used to run from uh but no matter how much time passes it don't matter you know what it's like it's so refreshing it's refreshing to be able to come in contact with another brother or sister amen in the faith that you can fellowship with with around the true unadulterated word that's able to accept christ as he is and not try to change him up until whatever kind of christ didn't paul said one come preaching another jesus in his day how was it another jesus it was the same word of god change twisted turn different perspective he said in history if somebody coming preaching another jesus he said i fear unless you might bear with him i'm going to realize this message is christ it's the revealed word isn't that right it's the revelation of the word of god so if one come preaching another message that's not the message that god sent amen yes paul told his saints i fear unless you might bear how you you might consider what they're saying don't go on those sites those sites that are out there people preaching against god's word don't you ever don't don't entertain that don't listen to it for a moment you're dealing with spirits as i listen to the to those that have turned away from the word and i hear how it happened they opened up they did the same thing eve did they listen to the serpent it's the hiss of the serpent you know when brother branham said if a bird ever if if a snake ever catches the eye of a bird he said he becomes hypnotized he becomes locked in so the less he begins to flap his rings real hard and break that trance and get away it'll stand there hypnotized trans locked in all the way until it gets into that serpent's mouth the devil wants you to go out there and try to listen to the things that are out there and whatever especially because he knows where you are people getting caught up they getting captured in their thoughts stay away from it praise the lord amen ain't no point in giving no entertainment to it when you know that you standing in the truth stay with that true feed upon the word of god and you go according to how god leads you if he needs you to see something whatever then that's him leading you but i'm just saying because we're dealing with spirits and how spirits enter into people you want to be careful with that you will have unnecessary mind battles because of the presentation see sitting is very slick he's a minister now the bible say he transforms himself into an angel of light and his ministers transform themselves into ministers of righteousness you don't think that thing exists amongst this message right that scripture exists now today satan's words is under the skies wolves and sheep's clothing doing what trying to give a false sense of security yes trying to make people conflicted and venturing off in their thoughts well i wonder if this is let me think let me look this up it's a devil leading yes praise the lord this is the reality of what we're dealing with this is the real war paul said when he fought he didn't fight as one that was beaten in the air he wasn't fighting against flesh and blood hidden things that ain't make no difference you ain't fighting people we fighting devils he said we're also not against flesh and blood right but against spiritual wickedness where in high places we realize that right i ain't never seen the devil in my life with my own eyes we lord did that for my grades out you know i don't know what i might not be ready to see brother brandon can look at him in all kind of forms and shapes and whatever and that brother's staying like a solid soldier boy and they might make me haul or something i don't know but the lord knows what we can bear amen even though i can't see it you can see it because you see it when it expresses itself through human flesh so you understand saints strange subject it just came to me in a certain way you know there's so many things more i can say but i'ma cut it off right here you know uh we're in a time of the pandemic i read an article just the other day where uh you know people getting such a uproar about the mask and whatever don't even really see they're trusting in god yes wear a mask don't let that be your your abs don't don't don't don't don't don't don't put too much emphasis in that because that ain't really helping nobody like that if god don't keep you you ain't gonna be kept that's right we follow the rules that are set before us but at the same time god is the one you know we've got testimonies saints have had covered and whatever and it's had no real effect upon them by the grace of god whether you wear a mask or don't wear a mask it's like it ain't really keeping you like that but the world that's all they got right these natural means of trying to keep themselves and protect themselves these natural ways you understand what i'm saying that's why it's overemphasized to the point to where there was a um a business owner that wrote a letter uh to people that were protesting mass now i'm all for mass i wear them anywhere that i'm supposed to wear them and all that all right i don't go against the law of the rules or whatever i want to abide you know i just put my trust in god but anyway this business owner wrote a letter and they said to people that protest mass if you come into my establishment without a mask on i take that as a threat a threat against my life and i will respond accordingly they posted it on their business door i've seen people get into fights and all kind of stuff man what is it it's a false sense of security you know as people just don't trust in god so the devil got to give him a substitute hey man we're in a pandemic but this pandemic was supposed to happen how many realize that it's a plague it's something that god allowed to sweep upon the face of the earth it's because of the sins that's been prevailing in the earth amen they rejected god's prophet isn't that right they've rejected the word of god pus put christ out so now all these things are raining down by the hand of god and it's more to come not just to cover there's going to be worse things to come but i thank god that we are his people and that he's helped us to be able to gain a relationship with him to where we can trust him do everything you're supposed to do be law-abiding citizens be real examples to people but at the same time in your heart and in your mind you know god you're the only one that keeps me if you get it he'll bring you through it if you haven't gotten it you gotta trust and believe that you ain't gotta get it you ain't gotta get it just because it's here you ain't got to be a part of the statistics praise god but either way god got everything under control amen all is well to the bride amen god bless you saints i feel like i've taken up enough time i feel led to stop right here amen amen i thank god for you i thank god for being here um just keep me in prayer and we have service tomorrow i just want to be led of god so just pray for me and and i believe god will give us what we stand in need appreciate each one of you and let us all just stand together if anybody desires prayer amen you are more than welcome to come up or you can stay where you are because we're going to pray anyway and man faith can touch god from anywhere you come up here that your faith got to be here amen your faith got to be released to god because the hand of a minister can't do nothing if your faith is not there ain't nothing going to move when your faith is there things will start shaking amen so let's bow heavenly father oh lord very undeserving of anything that you do for us lord none of us are stand here and boast [Music] make any boast in the flesh god we see our failures we see our frailties and i know for myself i'm disappointed in myself because i don't i don't feel that i'm giving you what you deserve so i pray that you'll be merciful to me lord god in that way and help me to die more to yield more to humble myself more to you this is not for a show ministering is not a competition a true minister of god in his heart all he wants is for your will to be done he wouldn't even do it unless you feel led to do it he's not trying to be popular he's not trying to do anything to get any glory to himself lord all he wants is your will to be done there are certain things lord god that's hard to master [Music] certain things we feel ourselves saying lord we wouldn't say within ourselves but i find lord that within my own life father i can see and relate to many things your prophet said he said himself that many things that he says he said it against us all but it's you screaming out and crying out against certain things lord and that's a blessing just to be able to have that [Music] so lord never let us get in your way these are your children lord you are the partner we are the clay you know exactly how to shape us and mold us we don't know you said in your word father that the clay can't look to the potter and say what make us that far be it from us lord god to have that mind father just have your way you know what's best we just want you to have your way it's a wonderful presence in here right now father these are your children lord they love you lord god you love us help us lord jesus we don't want to abide in anything that's wrong father we want to die [Music] lord we're not bastard children father we receive correction [Music] we don't throw it away father god we don't shun it lord we accept it but we embrace it because you know better than us father we don't want our own way we don't want our own mind we don't want to have the mind of a devil lord leading us down wrong thoughts of understandings of your word father god we don't want that lord we don't know what's best for ourselves father god you know what's best you our father you want to be led lord continue to lead us your people father god you've been doing it all this time and we believe in trust you will continue to do it lord we don't want our trust to be in horses or chariots or any of men's ability father we want our trust to be in the lord our god our trust shall be in the lord and lord as we've read tonight there are many that are calling upon your name and you said those that call upon the name of the lord shall be saved but we realize the twist that was within your word our lives must match our confessions lord it's not enough to see you come and move in a powerful way to speak or to heal or deliver or to work a certain miracle of some sort that's not enough we can't be secure in that [Music] we can't have security in seeing the works of god around us lord we gotta be able to see the work of god in us as you said in your word is you that that's here lord both to will and to do of your good pleasure your prophet taught us lord that the holy ghost is christ in you living his own life through you taking our thoughts bringing it in line lord taking our lives bringing it in line lord so we can have the same testimony as those as those in antioch father god they were called christians they didn't call themselves that it's because the life of christ your life was so dominating within their souls until their actions and their words and their characteristics were so much like you [Music] and that was the world's testimony of what they saw in them it's not we proclaim ourselves to [Music] those that had a false sense of security they made many proclamations catholic church lord she says that she's not a widow and shall see no sorrow oh god in the land of cna's lord you said in your word father and that's why you sent us our prophet in this hour to help to break that spirit off of us lord because the spirit of laodicea is to say i am rich and increased for goods and have need of nothing it's a false sense of security because in your words you said little do you know that you're a miserable blind naked and ratchet and don't know it blind [Applause] lord that's a spirit upon this age feel insecure where they shouldn't feel secure but all we can say is thank you lord thank you father for sending your angel to us come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins so you should not receive of her place thank you for calling us out of the systems lord calling us out of the world calling us unto yourself we're grateful jesus forgive us of our sins forgive us of our iniquities lord give us strength we pray continue straight father to be able to walk with you lord bless this assembly lord every every saint that's here even those that are not here lord keep them by your grace father god continually lord you know their battles you know where they are they're right where they need to be you're giving them the nutrients of your word lord god and they're receiving that word father and that they're being nourished they're being made strong and healthy through the reception of your word father down into their souls lord god and the life of that word lord god is giving them all the all that they stand in need of all the the nutrients and the blessings of your word begins to flow through their minds and their hearts and every part of their body you're gaining full control over your bride father god you're gaining that preeminence lord that was your desire father god and it's happening it's been happening lord and all we can just say father is thank you we commit ourselves to you lord have your way keep every saint save father we pray by your grace in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we ask all these things let the church say [Music] thank you lord thank you lord thank you i just want to thank you lord thank you lord thank you [Music] oh i just [Music] [Music] school that's true with my friends [Music] your friends [Music] save my soul [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] hey

thoughts you know i wrote these down we must be where the true sign of god's blessing is a life of righteousness amen not of iniquity remember we preach the series on the mystery of iniquity iniquity doesn't do the will of god iniquity is lawlessness and i wrote this down we know what a false sense of security is now but by grace a true sense of security is like paul he said i fought a good fight i've ran the race i know there's a crown of righteousness that awaits me i've done the will of god i've not lived in iniquity i have obeyed i've lived in christ's righteousness praise god what a what a true sense of security that is as he goes to martyrdom as he goes to beheading he says i know there's a crowd of righteousness i've got a real sense of security how many want a sense of security like that amen let's pray together heavenly father that's the kind of sense of security we want if anyone here has a false sense please correct us rebuke us now because you rebuke and chasten all that you love may we receive it lord as a child of god [Music] because we want to get to the end of our road lord whether it's the rapture or the grave we want to say like paul said i've got a real sense of security [Music] [Music] my common sense is one day closer today lord help us [Music] that's what i want more than anything lord is that true sense of security [Music] so help me lord help each person here [Music] straightened out [Music] is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh um [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] this
