have a little prayer time right now for those live streaming uh uh our family is only family here right now um so I think we just might as well pray for a little bit and sing a few songs by God's grace because most of the ministry will be going to the live streamers also my voice is quite tired so I'd like to maybe just pray a little bit and uh kind of take it easy on my voice a little bit so kind of like a prayer meeting tonight we'll begin with and maybe sing a few songs and we'll preach the word of God tonight by the grace of the Lord uh so Mal can turn on the music just a little bit it's a little bit here so we have numerous prayer requests I wrote down uh things that I could think to pray for so I'd like to uh read the list here little more that's good thank you so I'd like to read the list and then we'll just uh enter into Prayer by God's grace and pray for each one of these uh first I'd like to pray for um the little seven-year-old in my class Kylie she has her last round

cancer will not come back also I'd like to pray for the anniversary meetings coming up uh next Wednesday Lord willing so let's keep that in prayer also uh any lost loved ones I thought we can always pray for lost loved ones Jose and Christopher I haven't heard from Jose I'm not sure how Christopher is doing let's keep them in Prayer by God's grace I thought you know since we've been preaching on uh marriages and so forth we can pray for the married couples and uh singles in the church as well and the young children as they're growing up that God will teach them wisdom through these messages and help them to make the right decisions that the Lord carries that their marriages will be blessed because of the word of God also we'll pray for those who left the message that God will soften their hearts and they'll soften their hearts to the word of the Lord and I thought we could pray for Israel as well just because the Bible instructs us to do that so we'll do that tonight by God's grace children did anybody have any prayer requests I forgot maybe Joey anyone else have any requests anything I forgotten okay all right praise God let's just bow our heads and let's pray for a

be an encouragement to everyone Lord for those that are married Lord may they quickly correct us and bring us back lord to a focus of love and respect and submission Lord God for those that are may we pray for those who are in those marriage relationships and we take these words as Preparatory words Lord examining our hearts and lives be ready and watching Lord God for what you would do next in the lives of the singles and also these young children Lord God as they're growing up Lord some of them are just maybe five years away maybe less maybe more or potentially being in courtship Lord God and

home praise God let's take our Bibles tonight by God's grace thank you Lord let's open Ephesians chapter 5 tonight Lord willing I'd like to speak on uh marriage and family part four uh and the reason is because I'm not going to be preaching for about two weeks uh because this Sunday I'm out next Wednesday we have the anniversary meeting starting and then this about that Sunday I'm still not preaching so I won't be preaching for two more Wednesdays so I thought I'd like to finish what we started on Sunday we had the women's five needs so I want to look at the needs of the husband tonight by God's grace needs of the husband so we want to look at that by God's grace so Ephesians 5 verse 22 is where we'll start Ephesians 5:22 I really believe this is applicable for everyone as we were praying earlier I don't know if everybody heard the prayers but it just kind of was uh made real to my heart um no matter if you're single or married these things can help us out extremely well uh if you're married they help you learn to serve your spouse better learn to love your spouse better and help you to see what or how your spouse can love you better and you can communicate that to your spouse because a lot of times the reason marriages are struggle is because they don't people don't communicate the way they should they keep things in and they don't talk about things and uh sermons like this when you bring out the word and the quotes of the Prophet it helps you to really see how we're supposed to live our lives and hopefully that will cause couples to talk about it but even the young ones and the single ones you know for the young ones there might be a few few years off being married but this will plant the teaching in their heart uh that they'll need later on if Lord should carry and they do get married for the singles it's very helpful uh because they can prepare their hearts and for everybody it's helpful because we can pray for each other doesn't the Bible say we should pray for each other absolutely pray for all the saints so we want to do that by God's grace so Ephesians 5:22 there these are all extremely helpful for us all by God's grace so I want to read 22 down to 24 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything let's bow our heads word of prayer here by God's grace let's ask God to speak to us through Thy word you you know your heart just make a known God God sees all the needs Heavenly Father you see Lord our heads bowed you see Lord those that are here Lord and those live streaming we thank you Lord for all the saints that are hungry to hear your word tonight speak to us Lord these are important messages Lord we know they are because a Christian must Express the love of Christ in their home Lord what good is it to do to come and just love people at the church if we're not loving people at home that we live with Lord we should live such a Godly life before everyone Lord especially in the home Lord that we can reverence one another truly honor one another make it a reality Lord may you become so real to us in our homes Lord and on our jobs and when we have family time lord may you become so real that we are careful what we say careful how we treat each other because we're recognizing you're there Lord and also you're the one who created these uh family members these spouses lord they're your creation as well Lord most importantly so father help us tonight teach us through thy Spirit Lord this Thy word help me to be faithful witness in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen God bless you being and see there praise the Lord so we like to look at uh the needs of the husband tonight by God's [Music] grace like to finish uh the thoughts from Sunday I really appreciate everybody's patience on Sunday it was really really great to finish that for me and I do have the the quotes I want to show everybody the quotes I just find it really helpful don't you do doesn't it help you to see brother bram's quotes you know and then see the scriptures and talk about it so it's very very helpful by God's grace so I'm just going to review just real quick um not much at all hopefully just a couple minutes so this is part four I want to look at the needs of the husband uh so on Sun On Sunday it was the needs of the the wife so I was really preaching at the brother so tonight I want to tell those sisters all right know those that are live streaming so forth uh really take these things to Heart uh and talk to your husbands and see you know what do they need most uh of these needs um just like you know the brother should have should have heard Sunday and they should have went home and talked to their wives and said you know honey how can I love you better uh how can I meet more your needs what do you need what do you need more for me do you need more time or conversation or what do you need from me so let's just review real quick uh from Sunday uh there's five major needs of a woman and these we all have quotes for all these but I'm not going to take time to go through the quotes if you want them I can send send them to you I think two people requested the quotes from Sunday so that was really nice and I sent those to two families there by God's grace so um now remember this is from a a Christian uh counselor who's counseled a thousand couples and uh I wouldn't preach this unless it was in the Bible right I wouldn't preach it unless brother brandom said it okay so brother brandom said all these and we saw them on Sunday okay so here's the woman's needs uh she has need of affection brother Brandon said to hug your wife he said kiss her uh uh when he would pray for his wife he would have she he'd be rubbing her back or have his her back rather and have his hand on her back and praying for her while he wash dishes or whatever he would do to help out she needs affection she needs hugs and and kisses and all those things like that okay she really needs that okay number two is openness and honesty the Bible the Bible condemns all line and uh we all know it's in us to want to hide our sins because of what Adam and Eve did as soon as they make a sin they go hide instead of run to God but David said I've not hid my sin remember that and then he could be forgiven then God can heal the person or forgive the person if they don't hide their sin but a woman especially needs a husband to be open about the future plans and what he's thinking and to toally honest why does she need that because she's got to have the mind of her husband because the bride has to have the mind of Christ amen that's why she needs to know the plans of the brothers she she needs to know what what his thinking is and he's my head so I don't have any thought but his right so she needs to know that and he needs to pray the man needs to seek God like we said with Ezra and different examples in the scripture they need to seek God for the will of God for their family and then share that with their wives after praying and being led to the Lord it has to be done she needs to know what he's thinking he's always got to tell the truth if not he becomes untrustworthy and uh leader got to be trustworthy we've been looking at that at school at school we're teaching on American heroes and they Define what's a hero someone who's trustworthy responsible someone who lives their life for others that's in our textbook which is really nice it's eternal life is living for others amen so that's what a man needs to be brother BR said a man needs to be a hero he said be a hero he said be always be that Gallant boyfriend right so that's what we need a men to be need men to be that okay brother yeah uh the the the counselor said conversation brother Ram said that he said How's your wife going to know you love her unless you don't sit down and talk to her about it he said if you got a disagree me he said sit down talk about it try to understand one another and we know women are more uh linguistic you know more conversational so men need to understand that men you know might get tired of talking but they need to make time and talk to their wives just like brother brandom said sit down and understand he said especially when they get to their menopause time he said that's when the women really need your attention Okay when they can stop having children their their hormones start changing their body start changing brother R said that's a time you need to really be in love really got to be a gentleman he said gotta make sure she's your sweetheart at that time amen all right now the last two are kind of well I guess the last one is most obvious but yeah family commitment this is where she needs a woman needs a husband to be the spiritual leader of the home he's got to have family altar brother brand said the man's got to start the family altar he's got to be the one praying he's got to lead his wife in prayer he's got to teach the children and we showed scripture on Sunday about that God told Moses to tell the men to teach the children talk about the word all the time while they're sitting up while they're rising down while they're sitting down at the table uh put the scriptures on their foreheads on their doorpost talk about the word everywhere and she needs a man that's committed to her family he's needs he needs to be there to train the children uh to teach the children uh he needs to be there to love his wife of course and be committed to the family you can't just say I don't want to spend time with my family I gotta go do what I want to do brother R said God first family second and you last so if we believe that is scriptural which I believe it is God is first family's next because the man's got to serve the family he can't get all caught up in his hobbies and hish what he wants to do his selfish desires he's got to put that last and he has to have family before that he's got to be committed to the family okay last but not least financial support uh a woman needs a man that will work hard brother M said he told uh Hope's father you know that he would work till his hands bleed in order to provide a good home and a good life for Hope and and Charlie said yeah I know you'll do that you know you certainly do that he said just treat her right and love her and don't mistreat her and he said I'll do my best to work hard and to love her and always be faithful to her amen okay so those those are pretty obvious so these are this this is what a woman needs and if a man does this they'll always be sweethearts like the Bible said the Bible said they should always be ravished or intoxicated or basically in love they should always have that honeymoon type of feeling that's the scripture that's Proverbs Chapter 5 that that is scripture they should always be in love okay now let's look at that's that's my review that was five minutes so that was real short okay so let's go to the the the five needs of a man so so I hope our sisters listening tonight and those here uh can really benefit from this as well by God's grace now I got the order up here like this here's the five order um I'm not going to go through this in this order though I'm gonna I'm going to go with respect and or submission first then I think I'm G do uh companionship domestic support I'm gonna end with these two physical intimacy and physical attractiveness okay this is what a man needs here okay now and remember like like the author said this is what I want to do when I I finally get to preach to you in June on a Sunday uh I want to have the the couples take a few minutes after the service after prayer time and I want to have them take a few minutes and go through these and kind of rank them and see what's their most important need so the man might say well maybe this is my most important need or maybe that's my most important need um but I'm gonna say this for for brothers uh for brothers I think that's the number one need that all Brothers had because that's what Paul said Paul said wives submit to your husbands that's the first thing he mentioned right there so the most important thing I think to a man if we could call it by scripture would be submission a woman who's in subjection a woman who will follow the man and not try to lead the man that's what I believe is the most important uh aspect of it now a lot of men might say you know physical intimacy because of how they're built you know their passions and things like that but I really feel like scripturally we can make a strong case that submission is the most important thing that a man needs from his wife okay all right so let's go through these you got your Bibles ready Mal already got your Bibles ready okay all righta sorry I don't want people to read unless they're comfortable but I know Malachi and I will read by God's grace anybody else can read if they want okay let's start with respect or submission now the author actually calls it admiration okay so I could have put that word up here as well admiration a man needs to be admired which in this case I believe the Bible word would be a better word would be submission he needs uh submission and respect he's got to be respected U because that's how God made him now here's the scriptures let's read each of these by God's grace Mali can you get first Peter 36 please and I'll read Ephesians 5 22 and 24 again okay I believe this is right out of the scripture this this this counselor you know he counsel these couples he's a Christian and uh he teaches these and I think the Bible already taught him before he figured it out and I think brother Brandon taught it before he figured it out as well I really believe that for all my heart so we're just teaching what the Bible said and what the prophet said because they both agreed okay 522 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord now notice your own husbands uh you know sometimes I've seen this I've seen it you know I'm not going to no one here in this church that I know of but I've seen other marriages where a husband will get jealous of their wife because uh the wife is listening to another another husband more now that husband might be a pastor or preacher or might just be a close friend of the family and sometimes uh I've seen that where uh husband and wife you know they're divided because the wife actually respects and submits more to another man who's not even her husband okay that's real dangerous because the Bible said that she is to submit to her own husband as unto God okay and so women need to if they're doing that they need to repent of that and submit to their own husbands okay now verse 24 uh therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything so that means everything now I got a quote for you later so listen I got a quote where brother Ram said the wife doesn't have to obey the husband if he tells her to break the word word so I want you to know that the scripture says in everything but that means everything the word says because if a husband says honey you need to steal this or honey you need to miss church honey you need to stop reading your Bible brother Bram said you can tell that woman can say no yeah now there might be repercussions where the man might get upset and he might leave her but brother R gives us a scripture for that okay so while the Bible says in everything what Paul means of course is everything that's Christian everything that's the word okay because we cannot forsake Christ in the word in order to please husband or wife if they're contrary one to another you understand that but in a Christian relationship they should all be in harmony the husband should not be contrary to Christ and the wife should not be be contrary to Christ they should all be in unison and so if that's the case it's easy for the woman to submit to the husband because it's as if she's submitting unto Christ okay so you read 1 Peter 3:6 and Lydia can you get Proverbs 31:12 okay to share the Bible okay that's fine so Malachi 1 Peter 3:6 even as Sarah oyed Abraham Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid of any amazement okay so we can see that Sarah was the example Peter gave she called Abraham Lord she called her him my ruler okay and she submitted she obeyed Abraham If Abraham said we're going here yes honey yes Lord yes honey yes my ruler uh she just obeyed and the Bible said she's in the Hall of Fame of Faith because of that and the Bible said Christian women should be the daughters of Sarah they should obey their husbands they should let the husbands Rule and the husbands should lead by example of the Holy Spirit okay lady can you turn to Proverbs 31:12 got it okay thank you can read it whenever you're ready she will do him good and not evil all the days of life okay she will do him good and not evil see that's that's respect right that's respect that's submission that's admiration that's a man's first need a man's got to have respect he's got to have admiration he's got to have submission and a real Holy Ghost filled wife will do that she'll do good to her husband all the days of her life if she makes a mistake of course you'll repent just like a man might make a mistake he might not love his wife right right one time well he should repent of that praise God he should be a Christian and then they're not hold to our account anymore if we confess that they're under the blood of Jesus and Jesus don't see any more okay all right thank you now I'm going to read Genesis 3:16 let's turn there if you got your Bibles Genesis 3:16 and we'll read it by the grace of the Lord and then Malachi can get 1 Corinthians 11 1-3 11 1-3 that okay all right Genesis 3:16 I'm read that one this is right after the fall and unto the woman God said or he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so obviously you know this is God commanding Eve on how to honor her husband because she her desire wasn't to Adam at first her desire was to The Serpent and right after they partook of the fruit now the serpent already got to an offspring he said to you and your Offspring I'm putting enity between you The Serpent and your seed and her seed so as soon as they partake of the fruit they have Offspring they have children so the fruit had to be adultery we know that's the scripture okay so uh verse 16 said now Eve your desire has to be to your husband because it wasn't at first it was to The Serpent and he shall rule over you so God said the man's going to rule over because you were deceived in the transgression and that's in 1 Timothy 2 I believe verse 11 I'm not mistaken okay so Malachi can you read 1 Corinthians 11 1-3 go ahead whenever you write followers of me even as I also of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I deliver them to you I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God Amen okay so there's the submission aspect woman is under the man man is under Christ and Christ is under God okay remember God is the invisible Spirit Christ is the visible image of the invisible God the son okay now why don't since we have time I'm sure we have time tonight let's go to 1 Timothy 2 let's read that again so everybody can see this by the grace of the Lord 1 Timothy 2 and let's read that about how Eve fell it was Eve was the one that knew what she was doing 1 Timothy 2 verse 11 1 Timothy 21 let the the woman learn in Silence with all subjection okay so all submission so see the woman's called to be all submissive and learn in silence okay now that don't mean she can't say Amen it just means she can't start teaching others right that that doesn't mean she can't prophecy prophesy because a woman can have all nine gifts of the Spirit if God gives one of them or all man or woman can have any of the nine gifts of the Spirit so this is in the aspect of teaching because look at verse 12 this is what it's talking about but I suffer not a woman to teach that's what they mean by silent a woman's supposed to learn not teach she's supposed to learn in silence uh nor to assert authority over the man but to be in silence so as far as leadership she's a silent she's a silent figure she's not the leader the man's the leader the man's The Voice the man is the one teaching and she is below now why is that Paul because verse 13 for Adam was first formed then Eve so man was formed first that's God's plan and Adam was not deceived okay so Adam was not tricked by the serpent uh when it came down to handling the word of God Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression not withstanding she should be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness and sobriety brother bam tried to clear this up and he said he said this doesn't mean a woman's got to have a baby to be saved he said that's not what it means it just means her role is to Bear children and so she's saved as long as she lived lives a Godly Christian Life which is to give uh children to her husband to have faith look at that it says faith charity what's charity Divine love right and Holiness with sobriety so living a sober life not living a a a foolish life or life of drunkenness or drugs or anything like that but a life of so sobriety and and sincerity okay all right now here's some quotes now here you got the quotes invisible Union brother R said notice that's committed To Her Sacred virtue sacred Womanhood and then sacred motherhood honor her husband she's got those three sacred commitments that a woman's supposed to do supposed to honor her husband okay now here's a quite here's a strong quote you probably heard it before is your life for the gospel well said I was preaching the other night somewhere about women to obey their husband obey yeah that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago now he's being sarcastic but it's actually you know true in many Mar mares of course but they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know so they're not going to obey so most American women aren't going to obey their husbands but the Christian Ones Will that's what Jesus said but as long as you don't do it look what brother said don't never try to call yourself a Christian because you're not now look at that brother said A woman can't even be a Christian if she don't obey her husband now it's got to work both ways so a man can't even be a Christian if he don't love his wife okay okay right because God's not a respector of persons so if she won't obey her husband she's probably not even a Christian if a man won't love his wife he's probably not a Christian yet it's got to work both ways but man said I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God because that's Ephesians chapter 5 right okay that's a pretty stinging one right there that's a stinger right there he said don't call call yourself a Christian if you don't obey your husband okay all right next one it is I be not afraid he's talking about how women should have a dainty Spirit an obedient Spirit he said now Sarah Sarah was a little different from some of our modern sisters today don't it make you kind of feel bad when you know Men start talking and women come out and butt right in and it's kind of rude look at that said a woman's supposed to be submissive a woman's supposed to wait a woman's supposed to let the man talk and brother BR even brings it down to conversation we're having conversation when a woman butts in and interrupts the man that's a rude thing to do that's not a submissive Spirit okay so sister that one can help us all out by God's grace but um that's what he said now he said don't it just seem rude but little Sarah was a little Pentecostal sister that stayed back to take care of her business okay so he's telling the story of Genesis 18 right where Abraham meets the three visitors I don't you remember that and Sarah stayed back in the tent and she was just fixing brother Bram said that's how submissive she was she didn't go there and try to interrupt the four men talking and try to boss them around or you know be rude she just let the brothers talk and she went and served them in behind the tent can everybody see that by God's grace and remember Sarah's the example Peter said Sarah is the mother of the daugh the Christian daughters sisters should try to look at their lives and uh model after Sarah so it's kind of rude for sisters to to interrupt and men and start talking and cut them off in the middle of the sentence and they should stay back and let the men lead right that's what they should do now here's the quote I told you this is a stinger for uh men that tell their wives to do things that are outside the work here's what they ask brother brand brother brandom the Bible tells us that a wife should obey her husband I'm a Christian and my husband is a sinner he persecutes me in every way that he can and for me not to go to church and read my Bible and denies the word what should I do remember the Bible said let them obey in everything right but you got to balance it out with the other scripture now look this look look what he says what should you do now listen you're supposed to obey your husband that's the word now if he tells you and refuses you to read the Bible or go to church or something like that you don't have to obey that amen because why brother Brandon he that won't forsake his father mother husband wife whatever it is follow me he's not worthy than me that's awesome Amen I love that that's what Jesus said if you can't forsake your father your mother your husband your wife your mother-in-law father-in-law for my sake he said you're not worthy of me so if a man or woman if a man says you can't read your Bible you can't go to Church the woman says honey I love you so much but that that's causing me to break the word I can't I can't break the word or if a woman says hubby you can't go to church and you can't read the Bible stop paying ties all these things you say darling I love you but you cannot uh tell me what to do and you can't you can't tell me to break the word of God right you got to forsake anything in order to obey God's word all right that's a stinger but that's that's true that's very true now here's a good one too now this is a a real challenge for Brothers now we got another challenge for the brothers okay now brother is talking about how Paul said this is a mystery how the women should be in respect to their husbands even the second place I believe in the entire Bible thinking man's filter I listened to that last week what a beautiful message that is if you haven't enjoyed that you'd really like it he said the woman seeing she reverence her husband reverence husband now look here's for the brothers then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a Son of God I like that amen see a man supposed to get a man says you need to respect me you need to respect me you need to submit to me but in in all reality the man has to live a respectful life and then she can respect him right if he doesn't live a reverent life it's hard for her to have reverence for him if he don't live a reverent life because that's what brother R says next look what he says next and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of wow but when it is a man that is a reverend man Reverend clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the women children and all should respect that servant of God with reverence this is what he needs he needs respect and submission and admiration that's what a man needs first he's a woman that will submit but at the same time the man's got to love and a man has to be a real Godly example Church it don't mean he's perfect it just means he's Perfect by the blood okay he's perfect through repentance sisters he's not going to be perfect by his every action but he'll be perfect through repentance and the blood of Jesus Christ okay that's really important that we get to that quote that was real good quote I got God's grace so see a man a man can demand respect and well I I command you to respect me but if he lives a respectful life it's a lot easier for her to respect him if he lives the right kind of life okay now I want to say share this quote too I don't have it in front of me but I know it's in questions answers part four 1964 brother brandom said Remember When Rebecca was getting a little worldly right there before she met George okay brother brandom had to sit down and say ma he said I know I become common to you but you got to trust me I've got the word of the lord we got to treat her like a friend and a buddy remember that quote okay so I want I just want you just to listen to that sisters that and brothers there's going to be a time when no matter how Godly you live you're going to become common to each other because that's what happened to brother Brandon I honestly don't know a man that was more holy in the Holy Spirit by Holy Spirit habits than brother Brandon just by his life and by his testimony I don't know a man that in this world you know these days that live such a Godly holy life okay but even he lived such a life to God but even he became common to his wife so that's what I'm saying here you got to take this quote you know and got to balance it out got to understand it as well that even no matter how Godly you live there's going to be times where you get common to each other you got to say Lord help me to have that reverence back for my wife and H or husband okay we gotta pray for that and usually that happens a few years after you get married you know they lose the the the sincerity lose the uh the love they lose the submission maybe a little bit and they need God to restore it so let's keep that in mind let's pray God help us not to become common one to another help me not to become common to my spouse okay now look what brother says next I read like this you must be born again then we'll move on to the next need and you woman that take another man in your arm I talk about you know adultery you're marred you marred that mold that you were taken from remember that women when you act like a man you're out of your place so see that's why we said we can't have sisters interruped men and trying to rule the conversation they need to submit and just be humble okay when you act like a man you're out of your place and when a man here when a man gets to be a too and he's a baby and this and that the other he's out of his place so when a man's too babyish and too whiy and things like that he's not a man anymore so see sisters got to be submissive and then men got to be more manly so women got to act like a women and men got to act like a man see he's boss you gotta let a man be the boss he's the ruler so Brothers you got to be the ruler you gotta learn to make decisions right gotta learn to Le pray first and then make decisions ask your wife what she feels then pray about what she said and then ask see what God says see what God puts on your heart that's the way to do it now I don't mean a floor mat okay sisters are not floor mats not at all in the kingdom of God I just said a ruler a helpmate not to kick women around no the Bible said God said in creation you should rule over you not to be a big boss but to be a helpmate part of you she's sweet and kind and tender you should lead her around what word is that church sweetly a man should lead a rifle around sweetly yet he's the boss yet he's the ruler she's not a doormat she's a she's a jewel she's a M and you should treat her sweetly that's what the Bible says too and kind and tender see Brothers got to be tender to their wives what brother R said you should lead her around sweetly because she's part of you you go to mistreating her then you're mistreating yourself because she's a part of you and a man mentally right won't do that so if a man does that won't repent he's not mentally right got a wrong Spirit on it can everybody say Amen to that amen all right all right here's need number two this is a really short one but let's read it out of the scripture okay so Malachi Malachi get um Genesis 268 okay some of you maybe never seen these before now what does recreational companionship means it just means a man needs a companion when he wants to kind of relax or do something uh maybe that's just uh for for relaxation purposes he needs his wife to be with him he needs his wife to be able to enjoy what he enjoys even if she doesn't he needs like her as a buddy to come along and do things together with that he likes to do okay the example brother brand gave was hunting he took his wife hunting okay at least well not outside the Wilderness but at least into a cabin okay so I'm going to show that example okay so here's the scripture now we already read these these two scriptures Ephesians 5:22 and 24 explain that she should submit in everything so if a man as his wife to be a part of his hobby or some Recreation let's go camping or or uh uh let's go shoot some bow and arrow or let's go do something let's go do this or that let's go for a walk the woman should respect that and should be his best best friend be His companion be his buddy a man needs that okay now I'm going to read this one and then Malachai go and read this one because I don't know if you ever seen this one before Genesis 268 and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that ABC King of the Philistines looked out at a window and saw behold Isaac was okay now didn't know the story there Isaac did the same thing Abraham did they both lied and they said oh my wife isn't my wife she's my sister but after Isaac lied the King was looking out and watching you know Isaac and Rebecca interact and what the Bible say they were sporting if you look it up it just means being playful being joking okay so Isaac is just treating his wife you know playfully i' imagine maybe he's hugging her maybe I don't know tickling her I don't you know I don't know what kind of you know I'm not sure what to say but they're being they're sporting maybe he was kind of kissing her hugging her from behind or I'm not sure what you know I'm not sure exactly what was going on but they were sporting and he could tell oh they're not brother and sister they're lovers because they're spending time together doing fun things together doing pleasurable things together so that's a scripture for this a man needs that a man needs a buddy so his wife needs to learn to joke around and do things with him okay even hobby type of playful recreational things okay that's what a woman needs to do now it can't be sinful for example uh you know for the young people I would say this uh well I used to have a bad habit of playing video games well that would be sin to do that that'd be sin to ask my wife to play these these bad video games right now I don't play them anymore I haven't since a long time ago since even before I uh got the Holy Ghost I haven't played him for a long long time okay so this is not saying you know a woman needs to sin with her husband we already went through that if a husband asks a wife to sin she can say no that doesn't lead me to be like Christ I'm gonna pray for you okay but notice Isaac was sporting Isaac was being playful Isaac needed a companion he was just being lovey dovey whatever you want to say he just needed a buddy and so ack says oh they're not brother sister they're married okay and then Isaac you know confesses and the same thing kind of happen that did with Abraham okay now let's go to song I'll read this one here this is a nice one here uh chapter 711 711 song of Solon 711 now in this case uh Solomon and the shulamite that was his wife in this in this book uh he asked her to go on a walk and go down to the gardens now I think we can all see that can we that would be something recreational right oh let's go for a walk at the gardens my wife and I one time went a couple times with the Stan hu you ever a Stan hu those beautiful garden that was just something recreational that she wanted to do and I wanted to do it oh boy the smells they are so great you know this time of year when the weather's nice it could be a recreational thing now my recreational thing I like to go to Parks when I can with my wife or take her out just to a restaurant nice quiet atmosphere just kind of do that together um we don't much time to do walking anymore like we used to but we used to like to go to parks and it was just so wonderful perhaps as L gets older and can babysit you know we can go do some more walking in the park my wife and I I just like being in nature you know so that's my that's my Recreation I just like to go out of nature you know and do that now let's read the scripture here's what so what Solomon does with his wife okay 711 come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us Lodge in The Villages now remember Solomon's the king so he says let's just go get away let's do some Recreation let's get out of the regular Palace life and let's go out to the Villages let's go out to the fields okay verse 12 let us get up early to The Vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear in the pomegranate Bud forth there will I give thee my loves okay so it's kind of like that romance kind of thing oh let's get out of our regular routine we're always in the palace Ro doing everything in the P let's get out there let's go on a little vacation let's go on a little get getaway right let's out the villages let's see how the The Vineyards are doing let's see how the garden's doing and there we'll hug and we'll kiss and we'll have romance and things like that there I'll give you my loves okay there's nothing wrong with that that's the Bible said the marriage bed is undefiled and those kind of things they the couple should always be in love the Bible says that they should always be ravished with with each other's love husband's to love and the wife is to submit okay so can everybody see that that a man needs that a man needs a wife that will join him in what he likes to do if he likes to go Sport and you know play around or whatever more or if he likes to just you know go for walks or whatever he likes to do he needs his wife to go along now here's a quote where brother Bram took his wife on their honeymoon he said he didn't have enough money to take a honeymoon and a hunting trip so he combined them and he kind of makes a joke about it because I you know most sisters wouldn't want to go hunting for the honeymoon right so brother man makes a joke he couldn't do both so he just comine them sometime ago I kind of took advantage of a little trip I just got married I see my wife sitting there looking at me and we just got married and I was going to take her on a little honeymoon we saved up a few nickels and was going to go to Niagara Falls and I thought while I was that close to the ader onac I might as well get a little hunting in so I took her with me hunting okay now most you know the story brother brand got lost remember and it started snowing he thought he was going to die and so he was looking up he said Lord you know let me touch that that electric pole he used to he used to check the wires on his job and he finally caught it and that wire guided him all the way back down the mountain and took him down to his wife and uh where they were waiting there okay so here's an example where the wife says okay I'll go hunting with you hubby I'm not interested in hunting but I'll do it with you because I love you okay a man needs that okay sister so if your husband needs to let off the pressure and go for a drive or he likes to go drive or he likes to you know work on uh you know refinishing desks or you know woodwork or something you should support him in his hobby okay as long as it's a Godly thing to do all right so there's the second need so submission and then he needs a companion he needs a companion that will be with him wherever he goes and whatever he wants to do okay the third thing he needs is domestic support and so let's read this let's read Titus 2 so Malachi Titus 2 or Lydia Titus 2 4-6 and I'll read psalms 1139 a man needs uh support in the home because he's normally got to be the bread winner normally like if he's sick then of course brother said the wife can go out and get a job if he's sick and can't work and that'd be really unfortunate but sometimes God allows that okay so Malachi Titus 24 to6 whenever you're ready May teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be disree chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not Blas thank you now look that's serious the Bible said the word is blasphemed if a woman doesn't love her children love her husband and then keep the home a woman is called to be The Keeper of the home according to the Holy Scripture okay here's another one let's go to Psalms 1139 this a good scripture here Psalms 1139 he maketh the baren woman to keep house is that nice and to be a joyful mother of children praise ye the Lord look at that holy spirit says praise the Lord the woman that once couldn't have children now she's a joyful mom and now she loves be keeping the home is that is that sweet I love that Hallelujah same thing Titus said right or Paul said to Titus keep the home teach the children love the husband same thing this is what a man needs a man needs a woman that will keep the home train the children and love her husband here's where brother ad says it talks about how women should not be in politics and guess you know it's too late you know we got you know most women W won't repent of that but the real ones will uh she ain't got no business over any Authority in the church either but the M said her place is a man's Queen at home that's her place outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the truth I know that sounds oldfashioned but I'm responsible I know that after my going away from this Earth them tapes and them books will be living on and many of you young children will find the days to come that this is exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord now I just showed you two scriptures right it just showed you two scriptures where the Bible said she's keeper the home she should be happy and joyful in the home because that's her place all right now look brother Ram's gone and what did he speak in the name of the Lord yes did he tell us the Bible truth yes he did but most churches say oh women just have children send them off to the daycare and you go work and make money that's wrong that's wrong the woman needs a stay at home take care of those children now like I said there are situations even brother Bram saw where a man sick and a woman's got to go eat I'm sorry got to go work so they can eat right and make the money but in most cases the man needs to work woman needs to stay at home and guide the children and guide the home okay here's another quote he was the pass this way Womanhood is broke the backbone of the nation is broke when women get to a place that our American women are today it's a disgrace the way our American women act I got a clipping out of the paper I believe it was about 60% of the boys that went over seon the last war was divorced from the wives before they came back their wives running off with somebody else and the defense plants working okay so that was in World War II now that's a lot of that is historically accurate I have I have books that say a lot of the women went to work in the uh factories when the men went to World War II which is fact that's factual I don't know about the divorce rate I don't know if that's factual but that's when the first time women started wearing pants and it was okay you know for them of course it wasn't okay for God so brother Bram said notice after they started working they started leaving their husbands why because they had money they could do whatever they want they were being they were becoming like a man and they were having the spirit of a man they took the dominating female Spirit But A Woman's Place is at home with her children now if the husband's sick and she has to work that's different but a man's I'm sorry but a woman's place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves that she's out of her place amen that's the word of God on of two place in the scripture all right this quote I read on Sunday there's no one that can console or Comfort a person when they're tired like the wife and a man shouldn't confide in anyone like they do their wife now remember confide means to tell the secrets so a man needs to tell his wife his secrets about his plans right like we said that's openness and honesty brother Bram said that brother Braham said a husband needs to confide in his wife he said a man needs a woman that when he come home and he's tired and weary can sit down and she can talk to you and she can do more with you than anybody else see he needs a woman that can create a nice atmosphere in the home so when he comes home he's out at Leo to Sea and all those battles and everything and he can come home to a holy atmosphere yes amen all right here's the last one for this one thirsting for Life greatest thing God gave a man outside of Salvation was a wife she was to comfort him to help him to bless him to console him and to be a real companion to him today they degrad it moralized I'm going to skip right there okay now number four and five Le is four and five okay um all right I think I'll read both of these here now he needs a physical intimacy now most of the adults know what we're talking about most of the children don't but um I'm I'm going to just call it that I'm just going to call it physical intimacy okay or brother bam calls it passions or he calls it family relations that's what brother Bram calls it so uh that's important now let's go to 1 Corinthians 7 I'm going to read this for us by God's grace this is what uh man needs okay verse 1-9 now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband this is the way to avoid fornicating is to get married according to Paul but the husband Render unto the wife du benevolence that means kindness and love and likewise also the wife un the husband the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife so when the woman wants to have family relations the man should say yes when the man wants to have family relations the woman should say yes verse five defraud now that means Rob def fraud ye not don't Rob one the other except it be with consent for a time that you may give yourselves a fasting in prayer and come together again that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency okay so Paul tells these Christians uh don't Rob each other of that physical relationship okay the only reason you should do it or not the only reason you should not or tell each other not to come together is because of prayer and fasting of course you know woman hurts cycle of life that the time where she's uh having that she's unclean of course like the Bible said so they wouldn't come together during that time but see the Bible says a they're tempted when they don't come together so they've really got to make sure they have family relations and have the physical intimacy so they don't get tempted because they have these desires verse six but I speak this by permission and not of commandment for I would that all men were even as myself but every man hath his proper gift of God one after this manner another after that I say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as I so Paul says you should try to live single if you can but like we said on Sunday what would happened if everybody would obeyed that we would have had no Offspring okay had no children to raise now verse nine but if they cannot contain let them marry for it's better to marry than to burn okay it's better to marry than to burn like he said in verse two to avoid fornication get married now verse uh okay now that's okay that's something else okay now in verse 10 and on it gets on the reasons why they can separate remember couples can separate for any reason but they cannot remarry for any reason it can only remarry if a spouse dies or if uh the wife didn't confess fornication beforehand okay those the only reasons they can marry and have a living spouse okay but of course if the spouse died and their with widow or widower yeah then then they're free from the law of that marriage partner okay now here's a quote let's go through a few quotes here they ask brother brandom should a saved wife refuse herself to her husband if he's a sinner in other words should um should a Christian woman not give her body to her own husband even if he's if he's a sinner said no sir no sir that's your husband you'll drive him farther away from God than ever by doing that see that's right brother or that's right brother sister you married him he's yours and you're his okay so a woman really don't have she don't have any right to deny her husband of those physical intimacy and the same thing for the husband he can't deny his wife the physical intimacy that drives them away from God why because God put those desires inside of them to have those kind of relationships right the physical relationship God plants that desire a man or woman so they're supposed to meet meet their needs right that's what that's what the Bible says so they don't commit fornication okay next one said respect her like you always respect her don't pay any attention to these some of these sexy books now what are we talking about we're talking about pornography magazines brother BR tells them don't pay attention to pornography magazines don't look at that stuff don't look at it on your phone don't look at it at all and things that you read about and all this stuff and everything like that get that filthy stuff out of your mind he says so a Christian doesn't learn about you know uh physical intimacy by reading dirty things what they should do is read the book of Song of Solomon that's what they should do uh to learn about uh you know uh having better family relations or something like that the Bible said not let one dirty conversation come among you when you profess Holiness treat that little lady like she's your little sweetheart if she's 60 years old you just be the same you be the Gallant boyfriend remember you are don't try try none of these new things I know that as a you just be a husband a genuine brother a genuine Christian he's talking about don't try none of these sexual magazines don't look at those sexual magazines they can't teach you nothing really many of them pervert most of them all of them pervert your mind so we're have to look at them now he's still talking on this in the same quote and you women live the right way to your husband and you husbands live the right way to your wives be real real nice and respect one another and your family relations so that's your physical intimacy and so forth like that let it just be as reverently and godly and agreed with you among everything as it should be don't never push and shove and be dirty and vulgar okay now what was that movie that came out uh 50 Shades of Gray that thing was so popular but that was all evil what was that movie about from what I've read now of course I would never read that book I'd never see it but I would read Internet articles it was like a big huge thing uh you know the top top box office thing and so when I read about it it was that as a man that liked to uh hurt hurt hurt his lovers or something like that physically hurt them and all kinds of things like that it was awful it's evil okay and uh and Christians were saying oh it's a good story because he starts out you know pushing and shoving and doing evil stuff and then he's changed because of her and I thought that's that's wickedness the Bible says put no evil thing before your eyes nothing praise the Lord I'll set no wickedness before my eyes that's what David said okay so what does brother Braham say you have to agree how you do family relations so as a husband and wife you got to talk about that you enjoy our family relations if not how can we make it better uh whatever more but don't push and shove and be vulgar and dirty and evil like that be reverent when those things happen be reverent okay that's what brother Ram said right that's what the prophet said I'm just saying what he said all right now look what he says he this the same quote he said understand and talk to your wife if one nature is to you another nature talk to her about so if a man's really high passion nature with family relations he should talk to his wife about that they should try to understand well how can we do this in a Godly manner how can we do this where everybody's respected everybody's reverenced how can we do this in a Godly way they should talk about it and he said always remember you're of a royal family he said I'm a son of a king I'm the son of the king my wife's a daughter of of a king how would I treat that King's Daughter praise God that's what men and women need to remember in their family relations in their homes they can't just treat their husband wife any way they want they got to remember this is God's daughter this is God's son I need treat them with Godly respect and reverence amen okay last one here then we'll we'll try to close by God's grace physical attractiveness now uh like I said this might be uh higher on some men's list than other ones but I think it is in the scripture because the Bible talk about the beauty of wives and so forth so let's look at this a man needs a woman that he's attracted to okay now let me say this some women can't help it like if they get hormone trouble or uh other troubles sometimes they can't control their physical appearance because they get problems like that well that's not what we're talking about we're talking about women that can help their image or they can't help their body and they can eat healthy you know find a way to exercise and find a way to stay attractive because a man likes uh an attractive uh spouse right now the same should work for the the man right if the woman needs an attractive spouse he should take care of himself he shouldn't let himself go and you know and not care about how he looks and they need to they need to meet the needs of the other one okay now remember there is a little profit to those kind of things remember there's a little profit to exercise Paul said so it's okay to exercise a little but it shouldn't be above spiritual exercise which is godliness and Holiness okay but there is a little bit of um benefit to that remember brother Bram got a lot of exercise church because he used to walk a lot right hunting and walking all the brothers that hunted with him they all say he walked more than they did because of his feet you know the way you know he had to he got shot when he was younger and things like that had trouble with his muscles but his feet were formed in such a way where he could walk more than the other brothers so he's a very uh fit man for his age because he' walk a lot okay so he F he found a way to exercise and he probably wasn't purposely doing it you know like we might but most of us aren't prophets and most of us don't go hunting for weeks on on end right okay so let's read some of the scriptures in here Malachi can you get song of Solomons uh 47 and I'll get Genesis 2:22 okay so Malachi can you read that when you're ready song Salomon 4:7 I at Genesis [Music] 2:22 whatever you're ready th Fair my love there's no spot in okay yeah so Solomon looks at his wife and says you're Fair there's no spot in you okay so a man needs to look at his wife and say you're beautiful I think you're beautiful and she needs to do her best to stay as beautiful as she can for his sake because he needs that needs a beautiful attractive spous okay now also in the song of Salon remember there's a part where she goes through and she describes the husband salon and she describes how he's beautiful in every way too that's a type of Christ right we tell Christ he's beautiful and everything like that but also you know that's why we said a woman might need an attractive spouse as well she might want him just to take care of himself and treat himself uh well by God's grace okay now Genesis 2:22 this is a more uh kind of between the line scripture and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he woman and brought her unto the man okay so I read this because uh God brought woman out of man and then brought the woman right to the man and I imagine Adam looked at her brother said he looked at her and she was the most beautiful thing on the earth that's what brother Bram said so God gave the first man a beautiful wife and so every man wants his wife to be beautiful and every wife is beautiful uh in the eyes of their husband if he's a Christian man yes okay now Genesis 12:11 I just want to read this here this is about or Sarah and Abraham Genesis 121 and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sarah his wife behold I I know that thou a fair woman to look upon we'll just stop right there okay so see Abraham chose a beautiful wife okay men like Beauty right they want to be attracted to the woman that they marry so she needs to remain beautiful right as best as she can just like a man might want to if his wife wants remain strong remain uh take care of himself don't mistreat his body okay Proverbs 11:22 I'll get that one and and Lydia get Proverbs 6:25 okay you do the last one Lydia I'll do Proverbs 11:22 hope you're enjoying this by God's grace I really enjoy this tonight it's a real good topic to just kind of teach the scriptures on and show what brother Ram said now this scripture just shows the balance how you can a woman can be attractive but then because of her lifestyle she can be ugly okay uh as a jewel of gold and a swine snout so is a fair woman without I'm sorry which is without discretion so this just goes to show you can have outward Beauty a wife or a woman or anybody or man but in this case a woman a woman can be outwardly beautiful but if she's a evil character uh that beauty is just like a ring a gold ring and a in a snout or and the snout of a pig or schine right which it really isn't beautiful at all it's really gross and nasty and disgusting so it is is a beautiful woman that's not a Godly woman okay and brother Bram said a man that has his mind taken through a thinking man's filter the Bible he won't look at these strip teas teases and think they're beautiful because he knows they're miserable wretched snap swine like this so all these Hollywood women all these cheerleaders for the sports teams and things like that uh all these musicians and singers and everything like that that that the world thinks are beautiful they are a bunch of swine that got a gold ring around their snout praise God and a real Christian thinks that way if his mind is passed through the thinking man's filter the Bible Glory okay now or LD can you get 625 must not after her beauty inine heart neither let her take with with her eyelids okay so see what is what is Solon warned his son here Solomon warns his son that a woman has Beauty and you can't lust after it in your heart and be careful she'll take you with her eyes so look there's a way a woman can look at a a man in a lustful way right trying to draw him in okay that can be used in a bad way this is a bad way but it can also be used in a good way right in a marriage where a woman can be beautiful in a marriage and can send signals to her husband about you know the physical attractiveness and things like that and that's what the Bible talks about being ravished with the love of your spouse okay so see that can be used in a good way or that can be used in a bad way so sisters use it in the good way use it in the good way be attractive to your husband and give him the only looks that you would give you know to your husband only you wouldn't give to another man okay that's important all right now let's look at a few quotes here they asked brother brand is it wrong for a woman to curl her her hair he said I'm he said I don't care just keep it long he said I can't back that up with scripture I haven't got he said if you haven't got pretty curly hair and you're a woman and you want to look pretty for your husband or boyfriend or something like that I can't tell you curing your hair or what tinting it or something I have nothing to say about that that's up to you you just ask the Lord what to do and he'll tell you because I'm trying to explain things by scripture see what brother Brown say he say sisters if you want to curl your hair if you want to be pretty that's okay that's all right ask God about it see what God says right because it's in a woman to want to be pretty right women want to be pretty that's God made them that way brother ra said I have no I have no scripture that says a woman can't curl her hair he said just keep it long don't cut it right don't cut it it's okay to look pretty for your boyfriend it's okay to look pretty for your husband nothing wrong with that just make sure you pray about it first okay pray about it first especially if it's boyfriend and girlfriend or if you're courting especially pray about it then uh if it's before the engagement because you don't want to try to bring lust into the relationship right you don't want to bring that in okay here's where he says this about Eve Adam was a strong fine handsome looking man and Eve was one of the most beautiful women the Earth ever seen I can see them sitting there after God woke him up and see him sitting there by her side your beautiful figure beautiful hair hanging down her eyes is blue Sparkle with the stars of Heaven she never had to wear any of that here manicure no that's a wrong work or what you put on your lips and things like that she was pretty to begin with see that's the way Eve was she didn't e any of that makeup or anything like that she was already beautiful okay and that's the way a real Christian woman is without all that stuff she's already beautiful in God's eyes and the Man's eyes if he's a godly man all right now look what brother BR says here now this is the balance it out because women aren't supposed to be like Hollywood but he said pretty is as pretty does okay so a woman if they if they act pretty they'll be pretty right they got to act Godly and dainty and holy now he said he's talking about makeup he said if you'll add a little acts 224 mix it up all together and a little John 3 316 it'll be anything that maxor maxor ever to try to fix so instead of putting makeup and all these makeup brands on your face he said put acts 24 and John 3:16 on your face he said your husband will love you more everybody else will and I'm sure God will you see there's a balance to it a woman can't try to want to be pretty so much that she starts acting worldly she's got to have the anointing of the Holy Ghost on her face have the anointing of the Holy Ghost on her character and then the man will think a real Christian man will think she's beautiful all right now here's I want to bring this down for the Sisters to try to understand a Brother's Temptation here with his eyes okay brother tells us a marriage and divorce he said some of you women put on these nasty clothes and get out there and throw yourself before man and Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her already in his heart then who's the guilty the man or you now really both are guilty if a woman throws herself out there and shows off her body whatever more you know her body and the man lust they're both guilty right they're both guilty because she displayed too much and he didn't turn that he didn't cast down that evil thought they're both guilty but brother is making a statement he said the woman especially is guilty because he's a male made so he could take this act see and you're the female that ought to refuse so see female ought to refuse trying to be a lust object and shall to cover herself but again there's quotes Jesus said if a man looks in lust Jesus said he's guilty of adultery so both are guilty if a woman is dressing in mildy if a woman's dressing modestly and a man lust after her she's not guilty she's not because she didn't do anything wrong it's the man that's lustful and that's where a woman that dresses modesty she got to make sure her eyes and her looks aren't causing Brothers to lust right got to make sure she's holy and godly and not giving looks and having any lustful spirits on her and so forth but I want the sisters that know this those that are live streaming and those here A man is made to want to reproduce brother tells us that so it's a woman's duty to try to uh not cause any temptation to him okay that's her Duty and that's by dressing modestly and not flirting uh not sending any signals or anything like that now of course if they're married then yes they can sport like we saw with Isaac they could they can joke around they can be buddies and things like that they can love and romance and all kinds of things like that okay now here's another quote why we're not denomination and this is I think this is the last one we have this is the last one then we'll close boy one ill- Fame woman can send more people to Hell than all the bootleg joints you can put in a city that's right watch her go down the street with her clothes all stripped down don't care who the man is if he's a healthy normal man listen when he looks at that woman he's bound to have something to pass over him he's bound after something Passover him now just be honest he says see a man can't help it when a woman throws herself out like that he can't help it he's made to reproduce so he has something pass over him and you know what it is it's called dopamine for those of you who are uh scientists or no anatomy and physiology and I got I'm going to preach a whole sermon on just lust and pornography and things like that Lord willing as part of our marriage series a man as soon as he sees it these hormones start kicking in and dopamine goes in through through whole through his body and then the science says he's got a choice at that moment once he feels this dopamine go through him he's got a choice and it goes up to his frontal cortex this is his thinking right here it's decision making it starts the back here in the bottom of his I forget the name of it now it starts back in the bottom of his central nervous system and it shoots up all the way up to the FR frontal nervous or FR frontal cortex and he's got to make decision is he going to act upon that dopamine and try to have a sexual encounter or not and that's what he's got to decided every time church almost every time a man sees a woman like that that passes through him and he's got to make a decision am I gonna act upon this sexual reproduction am I going to go try to make a contact with this woman or not now most men what do they do they don't do the physical what do they do the spiritual fornication that's what most men do without the holy ghost or maybe those that are struggling with the Holy Ghost they they fall short of the glory of God everyone understand that brother B said I don't care I've had the Holy Ghost for years you can't look at a woman and her half dressed and not something pass over you I carry a little cross in my car many of you seen it so I hope that helps out our sisters pray for your husbands pray for your uh spouses pray for them because a man has he has a real challenge in that area just like a woman has a real challenge in the area of uh we talked about it on Sunday kind of like Assurance right she's always needs a reassurance she needs to be assured she needs affection she needs that love uh she need to be reassured okay well a man he has a a very hard battle with the physical part so man's got to be strong here uh in his human spirit and he's got to cast down when he feels that dopamine C uh pass through his body he's got to be able to say in the name of Jesus cast that lust devil down right I cast that lustful thought down in the name of Jesus or if he starts entertaining it said forgive me real quick Lord forgive me oh God I cast that evil thought I won't think of that God forgive me in my lust and then Jesus forgives him okay but it takes the real power of God all right let's stand to our feet by God's grace we'll stop right there I really hope that helps our sisters here tonight and of course the brothers as well by the grace of the Lord like I said we will uh we'll teach a whole message on that on the battle that a man has there's a book that came out a few years ago actually when I was in college it called it was called Every Man's Battle and of course then they made another book called every woman's battle uh but every man's battle was about the man's battle with uh the passion the physical intimacy passion that's in his members okay just in his body okay okay and it was a it from what I remember it was a good book from what I read I just can't remember much of it but brother bam tells us this is something we just have to be honest this is inside of a man and he's got to get victory over it okay that's why he needs a a spouse that will have family relations when he needs it that's why he needs a spouse that will be attractive to him uh and that's an important part of being a man there by God's grace okay let me turn it off by the grace of the Lord okay let's bow our heads tonight by God's grace let's have a word of Prayer I trust something was said tonight church that was a real blessing to you to help you out a long life's journey here like I said these are things that you know we don't often preach on in the 10 years I've been pastoring I think I've preached maybe two or three series on the family and marriage and I know we could use it you know probably more often um and like I said it does help the singles it does help the young people because it's it's instruction and righteousness that's what it is it's keeping the word of God it's preparation for those who are not in it it's also correction for those who are in marriages and these things are very important so let's have word of prayer and then we'll just sing a few songs and be dismissed dear heavenly father we bow our heads Lord we're thankful for tonight Lord thank you for these teachings of this scripture lord it's wonderful to see these things in the Bible it's wonderful to see the quotes Lord that we have Lord it was amazing to me when I first started studying this see how much your Prophet did say about these things so Lord we can't ignore it if your Prophet took time to say these things and teach on these things and people ask them questions about it it definitely meant a lot to them Lord so it meant something to your Prophet to tell us Lord we can see these all through the Bible Lord God we can see them all through the scripture so Lord I pray a special prayer tonight for the the wives that they'd be able to meet the needs of their husbands Lord I believe most of the sisters in our church that are married I believe most of them live stream are here here tonight so God I just pray these things would be a help Lord if they have questions Lord perhaps they can ask their husbands at home and then they don't have the answer they could ask me Lord i' be happy to help marriages Lord we Sur certainly want to strengthen them dear God we don't want to Satan coming in to tempt anyone because of uh incont because of uh that scripture I can't remember this the actual word there Lord God in continency I believe it was there God where where couples aren't having the time they need together Lord and we just pray again for the men that they'll meet the needs of their wives Lord because Lord this is the reason you put those needs inside of the women you put these needs inside of a man as your Prophet said a man's made to do that he can't help it A Woman's made to be like this way she can't help it she needs someone to love her and hug her and be affectionate Lord we're made this way so help us God to meet each other's needs especially those of us who are married Lord those of us who have vowed we gave a vow we promised you Lord that we would meet the needs of our spouse so help us to do that now in Godly humility Godly respects as we said Lord we believe the marriages that are right on this Earth will be a part of the marriage supper of the land dear God how's a marriage couple going to be part of the marriage supp of the Lamb if they're not living the right kind of life here on Earth dear God help the families and
