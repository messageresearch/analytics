to time you know and I really appreciate brother Troy and God used him tremendously when I've been on a few I mean some of us we went to God together and God used him in a great way in Guyana and years later people still remember his sermons that he preached because it was not his thought it was God's thought and and then I'll never forget at Napoleon when brother Troy preached that message on water baptism and a man in a cane came up and got prayed for and was healed there and the next day he didn't need the cane any and he still has names brother Phillips so always remember how God used brother Troy in such a tremendous way about the power in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad there's power in the name of Jesus brother lives the life supports brother Brooks there last time brother Brooks was here he said brother Jessie said I don't know what I'd do without brother Troy he said I can't find one thing wrong with his life he just loves the Lord serves God he's so

things about him by God's grace and we're so thankful for last night's service and also looking forward to today by the grace of the Lord Malachi let's see I've never been as homesick before amen as

the air and the sweet sweet by-and-by amen in a moment and a tweak leaving and I will be changed from this mortal body amen into a glorified body amen amen looking forward to other sights a man let's just stand in honor of the word of the Lord I got a I'm excited about today's message Amen it's not my message it's the lord's message a menace paul once said he said you don't have anything unless you first received it amen and if you have something that's because you received it you didn't get it yourself God gave it to you amen and that's what we're that's what we're looking for this morning as for God to give us something amen a man who mean how many knows he's able a man he's able he made an appointment with us he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be right there in the Mississippi Oh amen he is a man of his word he's a God of his word amen so let's open our Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 we'll read the fourth and the fifth verse actually read the first verse then we'll go to the fourth and fifth and from there we'll go to Psalms 139 I love the Psalms Amen let's uh start with the first verse and it says relationships chapter three I says and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest the title my message is sworn is the book of life the story of life amen amen verse three says remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore shall not watch I will come unto thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come unto thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy a man fifth verse says and he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I'll confess his name before the father and before his angels amen I will not blot his name out of the book of life amen they walked with him and they were worthy what a testimony amen now scored of Psalms 139 a man will read the thirteenth through the eighteenth verse a man who says verse 13 for thou hast possessed my reigns thou hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee and when I was in seat made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them if I should count them there more than number than the sand and when I awake I am still with thee a master's power has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just pray or the smart at you just give a special blessing of the people are gathered here today Lord not knowing what each person has gone through over the last few days Lord or what what manner of life they're going through right now or those struggles or trials of life father though I pray that right now your great Holy Spirit would give every single one of them a place of rest father Laura de as when you come Lord you heal when you come you deliver when you come you set free or when you come you bring comfort because you are they come for your father Laurent I pray there right now your spirit would be our comfort and upon us all as we listen to your word lower the we all leave again leave from here today Lord knowing that you have been here Lord and that you have ministered personally dete one of us in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we say Amen hey man you could be seated hey man our God is a good god amen and I just want to thank him for being so faithful to come into this room and meet us day after day service after service every time we come and gather here he's never missed an appointment Amen he said he said that I'll meet you there Amen if you gather two or three my name I'll be right there don't you worry don't you fear that that word will go on down all the way through history to the very end of the age where we are now amen amen so I want to preach a smart a message called the book of life the story of life God has a book amen yes hey man he's testified of it all throughout the Bible you know Moses talked about it David talked about it talked about in the New Testament and Jesus spoke about it throughout all the there's been this testimony that God has a book Amen you know and when I think about that that you know it's but the Bible says that that book was there from the foundation of the world so you know we you know as humans you know we we have a lot of books that we've written you know there's authors all over the world that are busy writing right now there's people probably writing trying to create some new thought some new book right now someone somewhere in this world is sitting down on a computer somewhere probably trying to draw thoughts out of their mind and put them on paper amen so they can express to the people what is on their mind there's been many good books and written there's been many bad books have been written as then books that should never have been written whether there has been books there be a comfort to many people but one thing's for sure that if there's any book that has written God wrote the first one amen and when you think about God as being an author God is really the only one that really knows how to write a book amen everybody else is really just playing around hey man we can try to do our things we can try and do this we can never really compare until unless he comes down and puts a seal on it himself amen you know when a when a man has a book that he wants to write you know he he first has to have an idea in his mind of what he wants to write about amen and so and what an author does he has this great thought he has a thought it starts off with a thought in his mind he had wants to get that thought expressed he wants to express it to the people and so when an author he he starts to write his book he has to you know he has to he kind of breaks it out of the thought and then you know if it's gonna be a chapter book he has to take that thought and express it out over so many chapters you know if he can break that thought and you know ten or twelve different things and he'll put ten or twelve different chapters to it and then oh you don't know and I'll put that each leave a little portion of the thought in each chapter there's no break that out and he'll just start going methodically you know down through through through and and breaking the thought out more and more and more and when he takes the book to the publisher to be published she has to have a title for his book payment and that title he wants to pick just the right title because it has to be not just a tireless descriptive of what's on the inside of the book has to be an accurate reflection of what's on the inside of the book so if you went to the library to get a book of recipes and you saw my hundred best recipes in the open happiness about World War two then you know that the the title the book did not properly Express what was on on the inside of the book amen because every book that you pick up when you when you when you finish reading that book you should be able to say within your own self now I see why he put this title on that book amen amen because when you're done with it you should be able to have a clear sometimes you know you're looking like well why would he title at that or why would he title at this but once you get to the very end now that the glory of that book has been expressed to you as you have experienced this book now you can go back and take all the way back to the building now I see now I understand that's why he put this title up on this book amen amen so so God as an author he had this book and he wanted to title it life amen amen and now if anybody you know we might have some idea in our life of our in our mind of what life really is but truly God is only the only one that really knows what life is amen you know God is see if God is gonna write a book about life he's gonna have the best idea of anybody what life really is a manual you take this world and us and it's an amazing creation of God you know there's there's life literally everywhere on this planet amen you go you to the deepest depths of the ocean and there's life you go out to the desert and it looks all barren but if you look closely there's something there there's something living there in the middle of the desert if you go up to the Arctic places where it's cold and and barren and almost nothing can grow and yet you still you see something darting here or darting there because there's life in the coldest places there's life in the lowest places you go up to the up into the air and you'll see life flying through the air or even even a little bits of algae or plant matter floating in the you know floating off the horizons you know and there's literally life everywhere all the plants and they're giving off their pollen and this whole this whole creation down to the ocean water you take it in the examiner ether microscopy see little micro zones grow there in the water and there is literally life everywhere on this planet this planet has been completely filled completely filled with life and they go off to the moon and they go off to Mars and they're looking with their microscopes trying to find life somewhere and they can't find it because God has for some reason endued this list planting here to be filled with life because he wanted this plant to be an expression of his life amen amen so in God row his book he he said I'm gonna sit down I'm gonna express my thoughts about life I'm gonna Express I have attributes within me I have these attributes of life within me and I want to get them down I want to write them down and I'm gonna express it and put it in a book I'm gonna call it life but you know you know when you when a man writes a book you know he he gets out of his high flowery language he wants to impress the people you know and he gets the how deep his thinking is and everything you know but when you when you open the book of life it's different because when you open the book of life Oh what is this this is the book that's gonna describe God's life and when you go and take the book off and you open it up and there's no flowery language there's no big high ideas or things written by man but it's just names in there amen so God the Almighty God who the man that knows more about life the person the person that knows more about life than anybody here on the earth when he went to go write about one of the greatest subjects that there has ever been about the very life of God he just started writing Adam Moses amen and he's kept writing David's you know these are the thoughts these are my attributes that are gonna describe my life amen they're gonna describe Who I am they're gonna describe my great thinking they're gonna describe what I had in my mind before before the foundation of the world before there was ever a thought before there was ever anything that there was God and he had a thought in his mind about life amen and there was two things that God did before the foundation of the world amen was he he wrote a book and he called it life amen and then they put that he filled that book with names in it brother Bram said the only thing in that book is names amen and he filled that that's what first thing he did for the foundation world the second thing he did for the foundation of the world as they took any stool lamp for those names Amen that if any of those names would ever fall short of the glory of God that there will be a blood sacrifice a man before one speck of time before one blade of grass before one thing ever grew on this earth before one animal ever put one foot in front of the other there was a book of life describing God's life on the earth amen and not only that but there was a blood sacrifice for those names in case any of them would ever by chance by somehow fall short of the glory of God there was already a sacrifice laid there a man before one speck of time think about our God has made this thing so sure because his life is going to be expressed upon the earth it's going to happen it has to happen it cannot fail God is going to express his life on the earth no matter what he's gonna make it happen he's going to get it done amen and I just think I would think about all of the things that we go through in life or the or the troubles or the or the heartaches or why did this happen or why did that happen and you think but all along your name is sitting there testifying throughout all the ages that there will be a man they'll come upon this earth there will be a woman they'll come upon this earth and when she gets her is she is going to describe my life amen amen and God has done made the end plain from the beginning I have a quote here brother Bram's I wanted to read from the message identification it says there in paragraph 52 or 51 says then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God wasn't as an object of worship and the only thing was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed two words and the word was made fan of manifest Amen amen what is it it's all God becoming tangible tangible God be made tangible you can feel him you can see him you can see his expression Amen God what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God what a statement you are a part of God amen and Jesus came to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he came to redeem God's thoughts God's thoughts of you God's thoughts of you God's thoughts of you God had these thoughts and he had these thoughts and he was going to make sure these thoughts were redeemed amen amen the Jesus came to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he came to redeem and then as soon as it strikes them they see it because the life is in their Amen so as they they have a name they have an expression you know we we have our children and we try to give them the names to the best of our ability but God is the one that really gives the true name amen amen and God has we want why because God has a perfect idea he knows the end from the beginning we name our children based on the the vision has given to us of our children's life but God is the one that knows the end from the beginning and he is the one that has truly given our name and a name is so much more than just a few letters out of the English alphabet amen amen but a name is something that God has given us your characteristic it's your it's your it's your it's it's who you are it's what today he took that name and he put it upon the Lamb's Book of Life this is who they are this is what they will be this is what their their nature will be this is what they will describe this is how they this is how they will express my life upon the earth amen so when we came we were born of our natural parents and we will inbound our life trying to express life amen and we tried and we try and we tried and we failed miserably didn't we amen we tried to express life we all of us when we were 5 years old we tried it when we were 10 years old we tried it we were 15 we tried we tried and tried and tried all of us yet from the littlest child in here all the way up is trying to express life a man just like all of every blade of grass out there trying to express life only but we have been made in the image of nature of God trying to express life but ultimately we cannot do it until the wife of God comes down on the inside hey man all of our trying is vain all of our trying is vain until God first takes his life and places it down on the inside amen amen brother Brian he said the only way that you can actually be a Christian the only way only one way or the only way that you can actually be a Christian is for Christ who is the mystery for is for Christ to identify himself in you hey man we can try to do our things to be a Christian but oh I way you know ultimately you know there's only one mass everyone's saved yes that's Jesus Christ amen he is the only begotten of the Father right Amen you know Galatians 3:16 says that the promise was to one seed but the promise was to one that's Christ is John 3:16 Galatians 3:16 the promise was to one that is to Christ so the only way we can be saved is how is to be found in him amen that's the only way we could be saved is because there's only one man to save that's Christ amen but if you can ever get yourself in there ever get yourself in there and have him identify you by expressing his life through you amen there you will find your salvation outside of that were lost a man outside of the life of Christ down on the inside we're lost if we cannot get to a place where we can honestly say without knowing that we're without without any lie on the inside without lying that I am testifying of the life of Christ by his acts down on the inside of my life they were lost amen that's a puts a lot of pressure on us a man but there's one way you get the pressure off a man is to allow yourself to submit yourself underneath the Holy Ghost that's when your works finish amen amen so when so when an author go back to the author you know when when you like say you have a bookshelf at home it has fold books and you say there's some in there these you've read some that you haven't read but there's always guarantee you could be a couple books in there that you really love amen you know that these are just books I just I just love this book you know and it's just something about it there was just everyone saw you just fine book that you just I just you just love this book you know and and so and so when you have somewhere over at your house you you you you you're gonna walk line so here they see your bookshelf you know they look at all the books that you on there that you have and they listen oh you know I see you like to read you know and tell me about these books of yours and use and you can only really testify about the books that you got you read a mint if there's a book on there on that shelf that you have not personally read yourself you've never actually cracked open the cover you've never looked down on the inside then you know nothing about that book amen but if there is a book on that shelf that you have read from cover to cover amen you start at the beginning you read all the way through the end amen and you read it you enjoyed it and I don't if you're like me when I read a book I don't see the pages Isis there's a movie going on in my head you know when I'm reading a book I don't even see the words on the pages I'm just it's like I'm in a trance you know I'm watching a movie in my mind you know and and what was i I'm experiencing the glory of that book amen though all the glory from the beginning in the end I am now entering into whatever that author had in his mind when he started writing I am entering into that thought and whatever the glory of that book is I am entering into the glory of that look because each book has its own particular glory amen and Yolen and the book of life is the same thing it has the glory of God amen and so when you have someone of your house and they say what's your favorite book and you say oh this one right here and this is my favorite book and you can begin you begin to get excited because you want to because there's something about someone when it loves a book they want to express it to the people oh this is this is a great book you know this is the author I really like how he laid this out and you you start entering in and now you are putting yourself side-by-side of the author amen amen in your and you're in agreement with what he said and in agreement with what he wrote and you can get excited about what he wrote because you like the thought you liked the expression Amen when you start starting express it to someone over your house you know you say oh this is a great book I love this book because he goes right here and he starts here he goes up and down and over you know I all through and through and then by the end as a great end you know spoiler for you but you must read this book it's a great book you know and what are you doing you're expressing the glory of the book hey man why because you yourself have experienced it from glory under glory from glory and the glory as it went higher and higher and higher up until the very climax at the end amen amen it's the same thing with Christians until we have experienced the the actual the glory of God the Bible said that we would be partakers of the glory of God amen we will be partakers of his glory my and the only way we can really be partakers of his glorious to experience his book amen from cover to cover to know the fullness of life the know the fullness of what life is capable of to know the fullness of what cutt life can do amen where's where you going and it's just like you know when you try to explain the baptism of the Holy Ghost to someone who has never experienced it I can to try to express the glory of it to you and I hope my words get across to you I wish you would read the same book that I'm reading amen because I let me tell you you got to read this book it's called life I want you to experience life with like just like this book has more glory in it than any book that I have ever heard any book that I've ever read this book has more glory nego from the beginning to the end I loved it through and through from the cover to cover I loved every little bit of it why because I've seen the glory that is on the inside amen amen and that's how we get to know the glory of God amen when we begin to have our own testimony our own expression of what we've seen the life of Christ do down on the inside of our soul amen now we know that we have entered into the glory of God amen let me challenge you come get me your testimonies amen come tell me about what the life of Christ is done down on the inside of your life Amen come get me I challenge you give me your testimonies tell me all about it tell me about how Christ down has placed his life down on the inside of you come tell me about how you've gone to the hurt and it'll only amen and you've had Christ speak out of your mouth before a man come tell me about the times that you've gone sent all pray for your brother I'll pray for your sister all that you're in with you and your burdens a and here can I help you can I can I give you something to help you appalling life's journey amen can I give you a little something because when Christ Jesus Christ came where who is the fullness of the Godhead bodily when he came and expressed the life of God he came and He healed he delivered a man he set the captives free amen he went to those that were brokenhearted a man he bound up their broken heart a many part in the balm a man and he and he healed them and he delivered them a man like the woman that that all the eyes were on Jesus in the tabernacle the one day on the Sabbath and they're wondering will this man heal on the Sabbath and he went from and he went and he took the woman he says woman thy sins are forgiven you and she was bound up you know and he says rise up and be made whole and she's and a woman who has been bound up and tangled up in her mind for for eighteen years all sons straighten up hey man of the crooked back was may strike her her shoulders went back and she stood up like a young woman once again a man in the life of Christ left Christ and when tryin to thy woman and she'll son she said she she stood up and she was made whole and then the priests wept only says there are six days for a man to work and you ought not to be healing on the Sabbath day and and Jesus looked at him and with anger and said this you each one of you who lead your ox to the watering hole this morning I can see it in my mind I could see you untying the knot and opening the gate and taking your oxen and leading them on down to the watering hole Amen why so he could be free from his thirst and this woman who was bound with this with this with this thing in her body and this daughter of Abraham who's who who set who's who gave this children in this land this daughter of Abraham was living in the land but couldn't enjoy the land I have set her free on the Sabbath amen amen taught not to this daughter of Abraham be set free on the Sabbath day what was he doing expressing life and that Saint was that that was the glory that was down on the inside of him a man was that she was excused the book was cracked open to that woman yes hey men yes the book of life was being cracked open to her she was seeing the glory down on the inside amen that there was our life down on the inside of that man and now that life is coming into you hey man now that life is now knocking on your door hey man will you let him in will you receive and will you receive the Holy Ghost a man each one of us you know we've we've been given the the gospel pattern repent of your sins amen be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus o'clock Christ and you will be a candidate for the fulfillment of the entire Word of God hey man you make a date for the baptism of the Holy Ghost where God takes his life and fills you with his life hey man then you now are the expression just like Christ was the expression of life on this earth now you are to express that same life you are now the expression of the life of God on this earth you yes that's why we're here amen if we miss that Saints we miss everything yes amen if we miss expressing the life of Christ on this earth we miss the entire purpose for why we're here the whole purpose of all the trees and the grass and the oceans and the mountains and everything was so that God could have people that he could commune with on the earth and so that they could enter in and be joined with him flesh of his flesh and bone with his bones and he could walk with him day after day in communion with them and if we miss that purpose Saints we miss the whole purpose for which we were put here on the earth day in day out day in day out we cannot MIT fail to miss that purpose we cannot fail we have to we have to we have to have that purpose played out day by day on the inside of our lives amen that's why we're here amen if we miss that Saints we miss everything hey man I think of Adam you know except as he was there and he was given that attribute of life and he was by the the and Adam and Eve there and it was by miss placing the word they misplaced that one word and they lost the they lost their ability to express life on the earth amen amen they lost their ability to express life on the earth maybe that's not that they still couldn't try they still had their they had their children they had their walk they talked to God and all those things but still it was not according to the pattern because it's not according to how what God had down in the book from the before the foundation of the world that these men and women will express my life perfectly amen they will be expressing my life on the earth amen but Christ has come to redeem back amen to redeem back our purpose for what we were gone God before the foundation of the world wrote our names not just some English letters I love it he wrote our names our attributes everything about God has a purpose our portion of God's own life there we're here on the earth to express each one of us amen if you're named beyond the Lamb's Book of Life then you have a portion of God the same God that created the heavens in the earth the same God that created the trees and the hills that we enjoy the same God that created our families and all this that we love and enjoy that same God has placed a little bit of himself down on the inside of you and you're the only one that can express that I cannot express your part for you amen amen I can't express the part of God that was given to you to express I can't do that for you you have to do that and you can only do it by the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen that's the only way so only hope it's only hope we have is the never failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives a man as I said yes say you know brother Branham he was given that that promise by the Lord where the Lord he says and a voice entered into the room and said to me don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything because the never-failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you everywhere you go a man I think my would I have a promise like that you do ever promise just like that amen for I will be with you even in you until the end of the age amen that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost he's leading us into eternal life Amon is leading us to express our portion of the book of life our portion of God's life on the earth amen and God is miraculous that's why I brother Brown said that the true church will write a book of Acts behind it amen because it'll be the acts of the Holy Spirit leadership in the church and every member of the local body expressing expressing expressing that they're their part of the book of life amen amen amen you know Jesus never went to a funeral amen he was full of life amen he went to a grave once and there was a stone block in it so he told him roll away the stone and a man named Lazarus walked out a man one time there the the he went by the funeral procession and there had the body on the bier there you know and and he touched it and and the guy jumped up and was alive again why because he was full of life amen and he is the same yesterday today and forever amen you know brother brandy said the three full purpose of Christ the mystery you know you remember from Christ the mystery of God was revealed the three full purpose was one to reveal the mystery of God himself to the people through Jesus Christ three full purpose of Christ on the revelation of Jesus Christ amen to reveal the mystery of God Himself what God is a mystery who can understand him who can understand who can understand how great God is a man who can understand how how marvelously is when I think about like you know the DNA and and you know how marvelous you know and you know everything is still obeying the Word of God you know you know you and God spoke a tree into existence at the beginning and that tree gave forth a seed and that seed had that on the inside of it the DNA that was created by God you know it's amazing the O's week as they you know they they have a I think it's called SETI it's search for extraterrestrial intelligence you ever heard of it and they have satellite dishes that are scanning the heavens and they're looking they're waiting to receive a some type of radio transmission from some type of intelligence out there on another planet because they believe that there's extraterrestrial life out there and they're scanning all the radio waves from the other neighboring stars and planets waiting they if they could receive some some type of a radio pattern that could not be explained away by a random chance that had to have an intelligence behind them that they'll say that they found life outside Hertz Amen there they've been scanning the heavens now for probably 20-30 years there was waiting waiting waiting for that signal to come across and yet but if they took a microscope hey man if they went down to one of these DNA sequencers you know and and looked at the DNA they'd find that there is a signature down on the inside of these seats down on the insides of these plants there's a signature of an extraterrestrial intelligence a man who wrote his his and wrote his signature on every little bit DNA all over the world amen that's even this pulpit here well it is part of a tree that was still was obeying the Word of God from the beginning when it was growing Amen every generation of tree going on down down down down down still obeying the Word of God still obeying the Word of God sylvain the Word of God when God spoke it out amen amen and so are we we ought to be still obeying the Word of God still obeying the Word of God amen in every generation coming on down teach this to your children and to your children's children and to their children after them that we are obeying the Word of God amen amen so the threefold purpose was to reveal the mystery of God himself to the people through Jesus Christ the second full purpose was that Christ might have the preeminence and his bride that he that Christ might live in the people in the bride and to express himself through her amen the whole one of the major everybody knows about almost everybody in the world knows about Jesus Christ amen but do they know about his bride my Amen but do they know about his bride who is the holder of his life Amen what was was it she is expressing God's life that is one of the purposes for what she gained the warrant of the entire purpose of one of the you know these three fold purposes they're they're amazing to me because the first one is Christ the second one is Christ in us my war the whole purpose of everything that we see here was so that Christ might reveal himself through his bride amen so they'd say he might have the preeminence in his bride that he might live in the people and express himself through her a man I think about you know you know it did you know I think about the types of Christ I think about them a lot because you know when you think of like Joseph Joseph went through some rough stuff a mint a man he was sold into slavery yes that's not an easy thing to have happen have your brothers take you and throw you in a pit and then you know you think of you trying you down there wonder if they're gonna kill you or what they're gonna do and then I pick you up and they sell you as a slave a slave all the dreams you had of having a wife and a family and and raising and having your own piece of land where you can live are all just - wait an instant that is now you are a slave now you've become a slave and he's going away and why is he going through that because he was a type of Christ he was experiencing that because Christ was sold by his brother everything he experienced when he was sold for twenty pieces of silver because Christ was being sold for 30 pieces why why why was he put in prison there with the butler on the one side and the baker on the one side because he was a type of Christ Christ was revealing himself through Joseph amen amen all the things that he went through all that was because he was a type of Christ amen it kind of helps us we'll understand a little bit better of why we are going through some of the things that we go through amen because Christ is being expressed through us he is expressing his life it's a great story it's a great drama a man where Christ is beginning to reveal himself amen through his bride amen amen think about think about David you know when he when he went up on the hill of Jerusalem was weeping over the city as he was rejected he was he had been anointed by God to be king amen but then his own people his own brethren his own children they excommunicated from the city and he went up the hill weeping and wailing because he was rejected over his King his he loved his lambs amen he loved his lambs God had given him a new set of lambs his people his children - - to reign over and to see that they were safe and worship with the God of heaven and now he was rejected and was unable to lead them anymore weeping and wailing why was he going through it because the same thing that would happen to Jesus Christ he was expressing the life of Christ down on the inside amen one thing I really loves I the story of Jonah who I think about Jonah I can relate to him yeah when God says go and do this and you go and do this I think oh my you know you could be as critical as you want oh man he should have listened to the word of the Lord anything oh look those don't be too critical Jonah No amen amen because you should have wished and listened to I should have listened to the will of the Lord amen hey man is now I could think Jonah's going down to Tarsus as he takes the boat when the Lord told him to go to Nineveh and he took the boat and went to Tarsus and he's thinking why am I such a disobedient prophet and why can't I be like Elijah why can't I be like Moses why can't I be like Enoch why can't I be like all these men that I've read about and every time God tells me to do this and all sudden it's just something rises up and I go and do this he's beating himself up in his mind he knows that he's guilty he knows he's going contrary to what God told him and he doesn't me he's like I don't know why am I doing this why am I doing this and yet the whole time through he's in his obedience he's being a perfect type of Christ hey man where Jesus in the self even spoke of it he said just like Jonah was in the belly of wael three days and three nights social the Son of Man be in the belly of the earth amen amen and the most disobedient prophet and the most in the midst of his most disobedient act was typing out the most obedient thing that was ever gonna be done on the face of the earth a minute it gives me a little bit of hope about my own self amen it gives me a little bit of hope a little bit of assurance that maybe maybe some base on my foolish nature it's maybe someone will come to good somehow amen amen that's that's our hope amen that's our hope a man's a guy who'll get some use amen Psalms 139 we read there how great is his the sum of his thoughts towards me amen let me let me I want to find that and read that once more amen a man says in verse 16 of the 1:39 ER said the eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are those are those unto me O God how great is the sum of them Amy I'd like to say that we have not expressed all thus the sum of his thoughts we have not yet expressed the fullness of his thoughts towards us Amen I'd like to - to even express even further than this that even at the point of the rapture we still will not have fulfilled all of his thoughts towards us amen amen even when we when we when we enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and we enter into his courts with praise we will still not I've expressed all of his thoughts that he has towards us amen because we will live and reign with him throughout all eternity and we'll be continually expressing the thoughts of the internal God and the some of his thoughts how great you know I can't express those thoughts for you right only you can do that and he wrote it in a book before the foundation of the world the sum of his thoughts towards you and he compass it and all in just one name that he is preserved and given to and that name is the sum of his thoughts towards you the sum of his thoughts towards you he has thoughts and he is determined that you will fulfill every single one of those thoughts amen that's why the blood had to come because he will not let us past away into oblivion did for our soul to disintegrate because we have to express his thoughts because he reserved his thoughts from before the foundation of the world for you to express Amen and you must express them by the leadership of the Holy Ghost and all the power of heaven on earth is behind you to make sure that the thoughts that God has for you from before the foundation of the world are expressed through your life all of heaven is behind you express your thoughts so don't you worry don't you fear to do anywhere to go anywhere or do anything because a never-failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you everywhere you go why because his thoughts will not fail the sum of his size how how great they are towards you how we marvel how great the mountains are we marvel at how beautiful the ocean is and we marvel about the the fields and seeing the deer go through the fields and the and just the Marvel of the the fog in the morning and and the beauty of his creation but greater than that is the sum of his thoughts just for you greater than all that is the sum of his thoughts that he is placed in you to express amen and we will express them throughout all of eternity amen though I wouldn't miss it for the world amen I want you catch the meaning that I wouldn't miss it for the world this world is not worth us missing amen I wouldn't miss it for the world Amen because his thoughts towards us are beautiful they're perfect their entire their complete Amen there is a sum of them and he has given them to you to express amen and he's Annie Annie and he not only do you write our names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but he also slew the lamb just a case any one of those names we ever fall short of the glory of God he put the blood there to make sure that we could express the fullness of his glory amen amen the third fold purpose was to restore back Eden his kingdom back to its right position that fell by sin through Adam amen when the communion was lost amen the threefold purpose amen and Wow and we will see those purposes completely fulfilled amen completely think about it we get to be the audience not just the audience but the participants to see this expressed to the people they men a man you know you think about when Jesus stood there and he said when he gave that verse and he said be ye perfect as my father in heaven is perfect amen think about that be perfect I want you to be perfect just like my father is had perfect now how can we fulfill that well I think about all like the Ten Commandments you know you know to me you know we we think you know we grow up thinking of the Ten Commandments of house shalt not do this thou should not do that thou shalt not do this you should not murder you shall not lie you should not commit adultery all those things but let me tell you that for the Briar Christ those aren't just Commandments those are invitations amen those are invitations you don't have to be a liar you don't have to be an adulterer amen those aren't just Commandments you don't have to be a liar you'll have to be known for you don't have to be a murderer you don't have to have a wicked imagination you don't have to have all these things why because I have I have poured out my blood for your name amen I now have my thoughts words you are perfect day men and these aren't just Commandments it's not just the law these are just commands but these are invitations come it's not just a commandment I want you to be perfect it's an invitation come be perfect come be may complete come be made whole I want you to be filled with my Holy Ghost I want you to be filled with my mind I want you to have my thoughts I want you to have my being down on the inside I want you to live and move in me and have your being amen why because my thoughts towards you are perfect and I want you to be my bride and next express me down on the earth amen hey all power in heaven and earth is behind us to see that we fulfill that how great is the sum of his thoughts towards us amen amen amen brother Barry said when we were planted in Christ Jesus in the inexhaustible fountain of life everything that we have need of is in us then we just have to drink out drink and push out drink and push out drink and push out we are pushing out the life of Christ that Christ the inexhaustible fountain of life we were planted in him as a planting before the Lord as a tree before the Lord amen and we just drink from that well drink from that well drink from that well and we push out fruit push out fruit push out fruit why because we were planted in Christ Jesus Amen it's our inheritance amen as far as our destination amen amen that's why when when when the Bible talks about the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he doesn't talk about the sprinkling of the Holy Ghost hey man he doesn't talk about the the the partial Holy Ghost amen he doesn't talk about the speck of the Holy Ghost he talks about when you are II talked about baptism amen he talks about being baptized that's the description of the Holy Ghost you are immersed in the Holy Ghost amen you are baptized with the Holy Ghost you are filled with the Holy Ghost amen you're you're not sprinkled but you are immersed in you are your the baptism oils is a consuming fire amen these are the descriptions of what the Holy Ghost is hey man it's just not a little thing it's just not a little sprinkling but it's a baptism an immersion a consuming fire amen amen filled with the Holy Ghost and we have to and it's not just oh that's just a neat thing you know you know like we call the we call the Holy Spirit a duck you know we'd say he's like a duck amen or we say the Holy Spirit it's like an olive branch you know all these different throw they're different different descriptions of the of the Holy Ghost you know but really the Holy Ghost is we say he's like oil payment but really he's not oil he's not tough he's God amen and weird to be filled with God himself amen weird to be filled with Christ himself a man is like the like I said yesterday brother Bram and the questions and answers they said to him what is this pillar of fire that that follows you around that you talk about in the meetings what is this pillar of fire that you talked about and bro Graham says it's God amen and that pillar fire is not just for me but it's for every believer a man I'd say that whole that pillar fire is here tonight amen he is is here to express himself here to - to - to reveal himself in the people I meant why just waiting you know there's been times to where we're going down the road where he has such experiences with the Holy Spirit in your car to where you just wonder can the people driving around you see this a man because the glory of God is so great and you just wonder how can they miss what's going on on the inside of this car Amen because the glory of God has been given to us to experience amen to give it to us to express a man so like I said those Commandments they're not they're not Commandments to us to the bride their invitations amen you don't have to be a liar you don't have to do this you don't have to be a murder there had come don't be a murderer don't do this don't be a liar don't be an old daughter come be made clean be made whole the immersed in my Holy Ghost be immersed in my life amen we got to draw from the sameness if he is the same yesterday today and forever Amen what he did back there he healed he delivered he set the captives free then we got to draw from that sameness draw from that sameness draw from that sameness why because he is the same a man he is the same right here for you amen the same for you amen amen amen oh my let's sell it over to Hebrews chapter 13 as we come towards closing here I'm sorry Hebrews chapter 3 we'll start with the last verse that we'll go on into chapter 4 and it says Hebrews 3:19 it says so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief amen now as talking about the children of Israel amen now let's go to verse 4 or chapter 4 verse 1 so they could not enter in because of unbelief verse chapter 4 verse 1 says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left of a left us of entering into his rest that any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word being the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and then they heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world amen so there is a rest for us to enter into amen amen and if we miss that rest we miss everything if you cannot come and give me your testimony about how Christ the life of Christ is on the inside of you something that Christ has done for you then tell me don't don't don't don't miss it don't know that if there is a promise that has been given to you of having the life of Christ on the inside a living moving life of Christ that expresses itself through you a leadership of the Holy Ghost that is given to you to live out your portion of God's life on the earth don't miss that amen if you don't have the testimony of that in your life if you can't come and give me your testimony of that then cry out to the Lord Lord I want you to live inside of me amen I want you to as Jesus said the foxes have holes the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head amen but now we have the opportunity to give Christ a landing spot he meant to give Christ a place a man where he can come down and live and well then move in us and have his beam in us amen and express what he has always wanted to express is his himself living in the people a man that has been the purpose of what he has wanted from the beginning a man when you look at those three full purposes every single one is there for our purpose it's for us to beat live and commune with him on the earth that has been his whole purpose for the last six thousand years of this earth amen amen he is the same yesterday today and forever amen as we said in the book there is a glory for every book and for the book of life there is a glory amen and it was given to us to express that glory that we could be excited about it amen amen you know you can't really be a proper witness of Jesus Christ until you've experienced it a man I remember once when I was a when I was a teenager I went witnessing door to door with the denominational Church I went to and I didn't have the Holy Ghost I didn't have a testimony that was not easy amen because you can memorize all the scriptures you want to you can do you can save to leave through Romans Road you can do all the things that you want to do and though this you just repeat this prayer verbatim after me and you can call yourself a Christian but let me tell you what until you have the life of Christ down on the inside you cannot be a witness of Christ amen every single one of us in this room ought to strive and strive and strive until we have something that God has given us down on the inside of life that we can identify and say that is the life of Christ on the inside of me amen Christ is experiencing expressing his life down on the inside of me and now I have becoming a new creature in Christ amen amen not the man I once was but Christ has changed me amen amen or amen otherwise as I as I as I I think the brother said something about preaching about water baptism you know I appreciate all back called bearing false witness of your baptism took that from Scripture we read there about them when they came out as though they came out of the Red Sea Paul said that when the sugar of Israel went through left Egypt and they went through the Red Sea Paul said that they were baptized unto Moses amen think about Dayton and Cora were baptized unto Moses Nathan and Cora when they when they walked through the Red Sea they are testifying we will follow Moses everywhere he goes we will listen to every word he says everything he tells us to do we will obey that's what they were testifying when they followed Moses through the Red Sea and they are baptized unto Moses when they went amen and so what happened when they got to those side of the Red Sea they said well we don't want to necessarily don't know if everything Moses said is really what we should be following I don't know if Moses really is a true prophet of God there might be other people that we can listen to but still I have a word for the day that is better than Moses is word for the day amen amen and we have something else that we should go listen to this over here listen let let's bless rise up leaders so we can go back to Egypt because it really it was a lot easier when we were living in Egypt and then living out here hey man we really enjoyed the the sins of Egypt better than living out here in the desert with this man who says he has the word of the Lord they were bearing false witness of the baptism of the Red Sea amen and so as every Christian when they when they go down into the waters of baptism and they are immersed in the water and they come back up they come back up and they are testifying I will follow the Lord Jesus Christ everywhere he goes I am taking his name upon my forehead amen everything that he says he everything that the Holy Spirit does I will love amen everything that the Holy Spirit does I will say yes and amen to it if the Holy Spirit is in it I will say Amen to it everything that the Holy Spirit does on the earth I am gonna love it and obey it and follow it amen amen and that's what the Christians do once they are baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ you follow what the acts of the Holy Spirit are in the church when you see the Holy Spirit acting you love it you obey don't speak against it don't say thing a contrary to it but wherever the holy spirit does love that love that love it love it love it why because the Holy Spirit is drawing you from the Red Sea drawing into the River Jordan why so he can give you his inheritance a man so you can live and the fruit of the land amen he's drawing you don't don't bear false witness of your baptism amen don't bear false witness of a if you were if you were called out that you were separate if you're called out and went into the water and testified and when you rose up the I am dead to the things of the past and I am Alive to the things of Christ amen then you follow that every single day until you are sealed with the Holy Ghost amen because that's what your baptism you were testifying a man jesus said that when there are two or three gathered on the earth amen and whatever they bind on the earth I will bind it in the heavens amen God took Dathan and Cora's baptism seriously they meant God took Gaither Cora's baptism seriously that's why they were judged the way they were judged because they are bearing false witness of their baptism yes we don't take baptism lightly amen amen when you're lying I say it to the children here as you as you are learning about baptism we don't take this lightly we make a decision that that's you know what I I'm going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I am going to put the things of the flesh behind me I'm gonna live live the things of the gospel in my life I'm gonna live that way through the rest of my life amen if I do anything wrong I'm gonna anything contrary to the gospel Lord Jesus Christ I'm gonna repent of it amen and ask for God's forgiveness why because I'm not going to bear false witness of my baptism amen because God takes your baptism seriously what's a two in the water what they bind on the earth he says I'll bind in the heavens amen amen amen amen just in case any of us would ever fall short of the glory of God he made the blood sacrifice for us amen amen first Corinthians 2:9 says i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him a man like I said they're not these are not come in the Ten Commandments not Commandments to us they're invitations amen that we have a chance to express the life of Lord Jesus Christ down on the inside we have an opportunity a man to have a new life in Christ an opportunity to walk day by day it's an invitation come walk with me Jesus Christ is beckoning come walk with me day and Dale I have a walk for you I have a walk for you I want you to come walk with me amen I want you to pray to me when you rise up in the morning a man I want you to read my word and love it amen I want I want to I want to be able to use you you know it's just like in this city you know as I asked him to brother high people were in the city he said give me a hundred thousand one hundred fifty thousand you know or whatever it is you know but guarantee there's somebody in the city is praying amen somebody in this city is praying to the same God that you worship the same God that you serve there's somebody in the city that has broken heart a man there's somebody in the city that is bound up payment there's somebody to sit in the city is in captivity or in prison a man and Jesus stood there in the tent and Tabernacle said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me he hath anointed me to bind up the brokenhearted he has anointed me just set at liberty those that are bound and in prison amen and he's good knowing me to preach the gospel unto the meek and the depressed amen amen the spirit Lord God was upon him so when the spirit of the God comes upon you what does he do the same thing we draw from the same Nostromo sameness why because he is the same yesterday today and forever and he will be the same inside of you amen and so whatever the Spirit anointed Jesus Christ to do there you know the Spirit comes upon you and he'll live out the same thing you now preach the gospel to the depressed amen you will bind up the brokenhearted amen amen and if you yourself become brokenhearted or depressed the blood of greece's Christ is there to not to judge you but to bury you up amen amen amen God as good as any Saints a man how great is the sum of his thoughts towards us amen you know uh you know brother Branham when he was when he was preaching one time he went to Chicago and he he took a text and he took four texts for the sermon in his preaching he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision a man and men started getting up and walking up because they didn't believe the gospel that brother Brian was preaching amen but he got that from Saint Paul because Saint Paul said Oh King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and he described the vision to him Amen so so so st. Paul had a vision from the Lord yes amen he had a vision of the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ told him things that he should do amen and he was expressed in the King Agrippa I was not disobedient to other vision that was given to me on the road to Damascus I have fulfilled that vision faithfully constantly faithfully costly as far as brother Bram doing when he stood there up in Chicago he said God has given me a vision a meant he says an angel came down he was in the tree said you don't smoke don't drink don't ever defy your body in any way he says you'll be sent with a healing ministry of healing amen amen and I even Kings will be able to stand before you amen if you will be sincere and when you pray amen and if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand in the way of your prayer not even cancer amen and he's told people of Chicago Iowa's not disobedient to the heavenly vision amen so what is the Bride of Christ do we have a vision amen now we might not have seen a vision like brother Branham or like st. Paul but we have caught the revelation amen we've caught the revelation of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that we that she will write a book of Acts behind her and she will have the living moving breathing Holy Spirit down on the inside a man it will be the same Christ living in her the hope of glory amen amen and we are not we have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision hey there'll be our testimony amen that we have a vision just like st. Paul just like brother Branham that we have a heavenly vision and we have not been disobedient to it amen if you have been disobedient to you they ought to repent Amen why because if you have if you're not fulfilling that heavenly vision the new you're bearing false witness of the prism where when you were baptized Amen but what when you repent there's grace for them amen we repent there's mercy there's the loving-kindness there's the tender mercies of the Most High God amen the tender mercies of Jehovah a medicine God good to us amen the only way that you can actually be a Christian is
